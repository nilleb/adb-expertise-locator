As a\nresult of population growth, urbanization, and industrial activities,\nthe indiscriminate discharge of untreated municipal and industrial\nwastewater and solid waste exceeds the absorptive capacity of the\nriver system, and the Pasig River has become seriously polluted.\nThe  riverbanks  are  characterized  by  low  grade,  blighted  urban\ndevelopment, including extensive squatter settlements, depressed\nresidential  areas,  and  large  tracts  of  derelict  industrial  land.  To\nrestore  the  environment  and  realize  the  full  socioeconomic\ndevelopment potential of the Pasig River and the adjacent urban\nareas, it is necessary to rehabilitate the river system, restore water\nquality, limit and control wastewater discharges, and promote urban\nrenewal along the riverbanks.\nClassification Primary: Environment\nSecondary: Human Development\nEnvironmental Category B. An initial environmental examination was completed\nAssessment and its summary is attached as an appendix.\nThe Sector Development Program\nObjectives and The  SDP  objective  is  to  promote  policy  reforms  and  physical\nScope improvements to enhance the water quality of the Pasig River, its\ntributaries, and esteros, to Class C standard by 2014. Class C\nstandard river water is capable of sustaining aquatic life, is suitable\nfor secondary contact sports, and after treatment, may be used for\nindustrial processes. The SDP will promote the implementation of\nan integrated package of policy reforms and investments contained\nin the Pasig River Development Plan (PRDP). The components\ninclude measures to improve water quality, and actions to promote\nurban  renewal  and  redevelopment  along  the  riverbanks.  These\nactivities  will  bring  about  improvements  in  living  conditions  and\npublic health standards for riverside communities. The components\ninclude measures to (i) establish and develop 10-meter (m) wide", "iii\nenvironmental preservation areas (EPAs) along the riverbanks, (ii)\nupgrade infrastructure and provide municipal services and facilities\nin urban renewal areas adjacent to EPAs, (iii) introduce a septic\ntank maintenance service and provide a septage treatment facility\nto  reduce  the  volume  of  untreated  municipal  wastewater  being\ndischarged into the river, and (iv) eliminate the illegal dumping of\nmunicipal solid waste into the river system.\nPolicy Framework The agreed policy framework includes (i) approving, adopting, and\nand Actions implementing  the  first  phase  of  the  PRDP  from  2000-2004;  (ii)\nproviding sanitation services in addition to the targets set in the\nMetropolitan Manila Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS)\nconcession  agreements;  (iii)  establishing  for  Metro  Manila  a\nwastewater  discharge  permit  system  with  a  progressive  tariff\nstructure;  (iv)  improving  domestic  solid  waste  management  for\nriverside barangays; (v) establishing EPAs along the riverbanks and\nundertaking  urban  renewal  in  adjacent  areas;  (vi)  reviewing,\nstrengthening,  and  unifying  the  environmental  regulations  and\ndischarge standards; (vii) strengthening the water quality monitoring\nand  enforcement  capability  and  capacity;  (viii)  enhancing  public\nawareness  of  environmental  issues;  and  (ix)  strengthening  the\ninstitutional  capacity  of  agencies  concerned  with  environmental\nmanagement.\nCapacity Building A TA will develop the capacity of the Pasig River Rehabilitation\nCommission,  the  Metro  Manila  Development  Authority  (MMDA),\nand beneficiary local government units (LGUs) to implement the\nPRDP.\nThe Investment The  investment  Project  includes  urban  renewal  covering  the\nProject establishment  of  EPAs  along  the  riverbanks  and  infrastructure\nimprovements for adjacent urban renewal areas. This will involve\nthe relocation of approximately 10,000 squatter families currently\nliving within EPAs and the redevelopment of the vacated areas as\nriverside parks and promenades.\nUrban  renewal  will  support  the  upgrading  of  approximately  500\nhectares  (ha)  of  depressed  urban  residential  areas  at  different\nlocations along the river. This will benefit about 80,000 low-income\nfamilies. Two high priority, pilot areas of low-income, depressed\nhousing \u2014 Sta. Ana, Manila and Barangay Santolan, Pasig \u2014 with\nabout  3,400  families,  were  identified  and  feasibility  studies\ndeveloped.  Upgrading  will  include  the  provision  of  basic\ninfrastructure,  community  facilities,  riverbank  improvements,  and\nland titling.\nThe  sanitation  component  will  include  the  procurement  of  36\nvacuum trucks for septic tank maintenance and the construction of\na  septage  treatment  plant.  The  sanitation  service  will  provide\ncoverage for about 185,000 households that are targeted to have\nzero sanitation coverage under the MWSS concession agreement.", "iv\nFor project implementation, consulting services will be provided to\nstrengthen project management capabilities, and help with project\ncoordination  and  implementation.  The  consultants  will  help  to\nprepare the contract for the design, procurement, construction, and\noperation  of  the  sanitation  facilities,  including  septic  tank\nmaintenance service and septage treatment plant.\nSocial and Through the SDP, the living conditions of about 10,000 squatter\nEnvironmental families (about 55,000 people) living in deprived conditions within\nMeasures EPAs will be improved by providing purpose-built and fully serviced\naccommodation at a variety of resettlement sites at in-city and near-\nto-town locations. A further 80,000 families (about 440,000 people)\nliving in urban renewal areas will benefit from upgrading, including\nthe provision of basic municipal services, essential infrastructure,\nand security of tenure. Pasig River water quality will be improved by\nreducing  the  discharge  of  polluted  municipal  and  industrial\nwastewater to the river system, and reducing the amount of solid\nwaste  being  dumped.  About  185,000  households  (1.0  million\npeople) will directly benefit from the sanitation service. The entire\npopulation of Metro Manila (about 10 million people) will indirectly\nbenefit  from  improved  environmental  conditions  and  a  cleaner,\ngreener, and healthier Pasig River basin.\nBenefits Benefits derive mainly from water quality improvements in the Pasig\nRiver,  and  improvements  in  environmental  quality  along  the\nriverbanks and adjacent urban areas. The benefits are generated\njointly  by  the  Project  and  other  projects  and  programs.  The\neconomic analysis assessed the incremental impact of the Project\non water quality and the urban environment, taking into account\nattributable improvements. The base case results in an economic\ninternal rate of return of 16 percent, which remained satisfactory\nwhen subjected to sensitivity analysis.\nThe Policy Loan\nLoan Amount and The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a loan of $100\nTerms million from its ordinary capital resources to support the necessary\npolicy reforms. The Borrower will be the Republic of the Philippines.\nThe loan will have a maturity of 15 years, including a grace period\nof 3 years, with interest determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s pool-\nbased  variable  lending  rate  system  for  US  dollar  loans  and  a\ncommitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum.\nProgram Period The  program  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  two  tranches.  The  first\nand Tranching tranche of $40 million will be released upon loan effectiveness. The\nsecond tranche of $60 million is expected to be released after 12\nmonths, subject to the conditions of release being fulfilled.\nExecuting Department  of  Finance  and  the  Pasig  River  Rehabilitation\nAgencies Commission (PRRC).", "v\nProcurement The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange\ncosts of items produced and procured in ADB member countries,\nexcluding  listed  ineligible  items,  and  imports  financed  by  other\nbilateral and multilateral funding agencies.\nCounterpart Funds The  Government  will  ensure  that  sufficient  counterpart  funds\ngenerated  from  the  loan  proceeds  are  available  to  support  the\npolicy reforms to be initiated under the SDP and implementation of\nthe project components. Any remaining funds will be used, first, to\nfinance local currency costs of other ADB-financed projects, and\nsecond, for general development purposes.\nThe Investment Loan\nLoan Amount and ADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $75  million  from  its  ordinary  capital\nTerms resources to finance the foreign exchange and part of the local\ncurrency  costs  of  the  investment  component  of  the  SDP.  The\nBorrower will be the Republic of the Philippines. The loan will have\na maturity of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years, with\ninterest determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based variable\nlending rate system for US dollar loans and a commitment charge\nof 0.75 percent per annum.\nCofinancing Cofinancing grants are being negotiated for capacity building and\ntechnical  studies.  The  Danish  International  Development\nAssistance (Danida) and the United States Trade and Development\nAgency have indicated interest in financing capacity building for\nPRRC,  a  community-based  environmental  awareness  program,\nlivelihood program, further development of the mathematical model\nfor  water  quality  monitoring,  toxic  and  hazardous  waste\nmanagement study, and an industrial location strategy study.\nImplementation The PRRC will be the Executing Agency responsible for overall\nArrangements and program  coordination,  monitoring,  implementation,  and  capacity\nExecuting Agency building. It has established a project management office for this\npurpose.  The  PRRC  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the\nsanitation component, including the development of the septage\ntreatment  facility  and  the  septic  tank  cleaning  service.  The\nDepartment of Environment and Natural Resources, in conjunction\nwith the Laguna Lake Development Authority, will monitor water\nquality and enforce environmental regulations and standards. The\nHousing  and  Urban  Development  Coordinating  Council,  in\ncollaboration with the National Housing Authority, and the LGUs will\nbe  responsible  for  development  of  squatter  relocation  sites  and\nrelocation  of  families  from  EPAs.  MMDA  and  the  LGUs  will  be\nresponsible for implementing urban renewal, including community\nconsultation, preparation activities, and provision of infrastructure\nand basic municipal services.", "vi\nProcurement and Procurement  of  goods  and  services  shall  be  subject  to  the\nConsultant provisions of ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Contracts for the\nServices sanitation and septage facilities will be awarded on the basis of\ninternational competitive bidding.  Civil  works  contracts  for  EPAs\nand urban renewal areas, less than $3 million equivalent, will be\nawarded on the basis of local competitive bidding, in accordance\nwith procedures acceptable to ADB. Consultants will be recruited in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants or\nother procedures acceptable to ADB for the selection of domestic\nconsultants.\nTime Frame The investment component of the SDP will be implemented over\nfive years with completion expected by 31 July 2005.\nTechnical Assistance ADB will provide a $1 million technical assistance financed on a\ngrant basis from the Asian Currency Crisis Support Facility, funded\nby the Government of Japan. The TA will provide capacity building\nfor the PRRC, MMDA, and the LGUs.\nRisks and Safeguards The  principal  risks  include  (i)  a  possible  lack  of  Government\ncommitment to implement and sustain the policy reform agenda and\ninadequate provision of Government counterpart funds, (ii) a legal\nchallenge  by  the  MWSS  concessionaires  asserting  that  the\nConcession  Agreement  confers  upon  them  exclusive  rights  to\nprovide  and  operate  sanitation  services,  (iii)  failure  to  enforce\nenvironmental  standards  and  regulations,  (iv)  reluctance  of  the\nprivate  sector  to  reduce  the  volume  and  improve  the  quality  of\nindustrial wastewater discharges, (v) resistance of squatters and\nother slum dwellers to relocate from EPAs to resettlement areas,\nand (vi) inadequate institutional capacity to effectively implement\nthe  SDP  and  operate  and  manage  the  facilities.  Specific\narrangements to minimize these risks are incorporated in the SDP\ndesign.  The  Government  has  shown  strong  commitment  to  the\nPasig River rehabilitation, identifying it as a flagship project. The\nOffice of the Government Corporate Counsel has issued a legal\nopinion stating that under the Concession Agreement the provision\nof sanitation services is not an exclusive right granted to the MWSS\nconcessionaires.  The  policy  loan  will  be  released  in  tranches\nagainst the achievement of predetermined policy objectives, and\nthe Government has agreed that adequate counterpart funds will be\nallocated for the Project. The investment loan is expected to restore\nthe  environment,  improve  living  conditions,  raise  public  health\nstandards, and deliver essential infrastructure and basic municipal\nservices  for  the  riverside  communities.  Extensive  consultations\nwere  undertaken  with  affected  communities,  including\nnongovernment organizations and community groups. In general,\npeople are willing to relocate provided that there are employment\nopportunities and access to transport, education, and other social\nservices.  Through  the  SDP,  it  is  proposed  to  give  people  an\nelement of choice for relocation, including a range of in-city and\nnear-to-town  sites  that  will  be  developed  with  a  full  range  of", "vii\nservices  and  facilities.  Actual  relocation  will  be  preceded  by  a\nperiod of community preparation, and assistance will be provided\nfor livelihood skills training and job placement.

INTRODUCTION\n2. In recent years, the Philippines has experienced a remarkable pace of urbanization,\nparticularly affecting Metro Manila. The rapid urban growth is driven by high population growth\nand an influx of rural migrants attracted by the economic opportunities available in expanding\ncities.  For  Metro  Manila,  population  growth  has  far  outstripped  the  rate  at  which  basic\ninfrastructure and essential municipal services have been provided. The result is a severely\novercrowded, congested, and environmentally degraded city that is beset with traffic problems;\nair  and  water  pollution;  and  inadequate  sanitation,  sewerage,  drainage,  and  solid  waste\nmanagement facilities. Ineffective land management and development control policies, and\ninappropriate land use zoning have resulted in an incompatible mix of industrial, commercial,\nand  residential  activities,  interspersed  with  a  proliferation  of  slum  areas  and  squatter\nsettlements. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has already provided assistance1 to tackle air\npollution problems in Metro Manila, and as part of an integrated environmental management\npackage is now focusing on the problems of water quality management.\n3. In the urban areas, particularly Metro Manila, economic growth, industrial operations,\ncommercial  activity,  and  rising  living  standards  have  led  to  a  massive  increase  in  water\nconsumption.  As  a  consequence,  the  volume  of  wastewater  has  also  risen  dramatically.\nBecause wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal facilities are extremely limited in Metro\nManila, most of the polluted wastewater is discharged, untreated, to the public drainage system\nand ultimately enters natural water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and the sea, causing pollution\nand  environmental  damage.  In  Metro  Manila,  the  Pasig  River  system  has  been  severely\ndamaged  by  the  discharge  of  polluted  wastewater.  The  volume  of  pollution  discharge  far\nexceeds  the  assimilative  capacity  of  the  river,  and  water  quality  is  below  all  the  basic\nenvironmental standards set for the river. The Government has acknowledged this problem and\nthrough  the  Philippine  National  Development  Plan,2  and  the  Philippine  Medium-Term\nDevelopment Plan3 is focusing greater attention on environmental concerns as a development\nissue. For future development, the Government plans to initiate a sustainable development\nprocess that respects the environment. The SDP is a prototype aimed at supporting the first\nphase of a long-term river environmental management and rehabilitation program.\n4. The Government recognizes the historic, cultural, and economic importance of the Pasig\nRiver system to Metro Manila and the country. Over the years, the river system has become\nheavily polluted through the uncontrolled and indiscriminate discharge of untreated industrial\nand municipal wastewater and solid waste. The Government has set a high priority on restoring\n                                                          \n1\nLoan 1663-PHI: Metro Manila Air Quality Improvement Sector Development Program, for $200 million, approved\non 16 December 1998.\n2\nNational Economic and Development Authority. 1998.

ADB provided TA4 to help the Government to (i) update and\nrefine the comprehensive 15-year Pasig River Development Plan (PRDP), divided into three,\nfive-year phases; and (ii) identify an integrated investment project to support the first five-year\nphase. The results of the TA and ADB missions show that to substantially reduce pollution due\nto the discharge of untreated wastewater, it is necessary to (i) improve the physical facilities for\nthe collection, treatment, and disposal of municipal wastewater, industrial wastewater, and\ndomestic solid waste; (ii) redevelop the urban areas in the vicinity of the riverbanks; and (iii)\nstrengthen the institutional capacity of the Government agencies responsible for environmental\nmonitoring and enforcement.\n5. The achievement of sustainable improvements in Pasig River water quality and the\nencouragement of urban renewal will require the Government to adopt and implement a policy\nreform agenda. Accordingly, an outline policy framework was developed during fact-finding,\naimed  at  (i)  approving  and  adopting  the  PRDP,  (ii)  expanding  and  advancing  sanitation\ncoverage targets, (iii) introducing the polluter pays principle to Metro Manila, (iv) introducing\ncommunity-based solid waste management, (v) establishing environmental preservation areas\n(EPAs) along the riverbanks, (vi) strengthening environmental standards and regulations, (vii)\nstrengthening  water  quality  monitoring  and  enforcement  capability,  (viii)  enhancing  public\nawareness  of  environmental  issues,  and  (ix)  strengthening  the  institutional  capacity  of\nenvironmental management agencies. This policy framework was further developed and refined\nduring loan appraisal. It also became clear during fact-finding that, to support implementation of\nthe policy agenda and physical improvements, adoption of ADB\u2019s SDP modality would be the\nappropriate approach. Consequently, the proposed SDP will comprise the program loan linked\nto the implementation of the policy reform agenda and the investment loan to support the\nimplementation of physical components and institutional capacity building.\n6. At the request of the Government, ADB fielded the Appraisal Mission5 in July 1999. The\nMission was to reach an agreement on the Pasig River rehabilitation program, including the\npolicy reform agenda, the proposed loans and components, cost estimates, financing plan,\ninstitutional arrangements, and other aspects. The Mission focused on further developing the\nSDP and resolving outstanding issues, including firming up (i) the policy dialogue, (ii) sanitation\ncoverage targets, (iii) resettlement plan, (iv) local government participation, (v) loan size and\nconditions for tranche releases for the policy loan, and (vi) size and scope of the investment\nloan.  A  memorandum  of  understanding  was  signed  by  the  Government  and  ADB  on  10\nSeptember 1999; it set out the understandings and agreements reached by the Mission and\nGovernment representatives. The SDP was formulated using the findings of ADB missions;\ninformation provided by the Government; discussions with other funding agencies, bilateral\nfinancing  agencies,  and  private  sector  representatives;  dialogue  with  beneficiaries  and\nnongovernment organizations (NGOs); and the results of the TA. The program framework is\npresented in Appendix 1.\n                                                          \n4\nTA 2803-PHI: Pasig River Environmental Management and Rehabilitation Project, for $800,000, approved on 29\nMay 1997.

Economic Development Challenges\n7. The  National  Statistics  Coordination  Board\u2019s  published  population  census  statistics6\nshow that the national population grew from 60.7 million in 1990 to 68.6 million in 1995,\nrepresenting an annual average growth of 2.3 percent over the intercensus period. Over the\nsame period, the Metro Manila (National Capital Region) population grew from 7.8 million to 9.5\nmillion, representing an average annual growth of 3.3 percent. The population density of Metro\nManila rose from about 12,500 persons per square kilometer (km2) to almost 15,000 (Metro\nManila\u2019s land area is 636 km2). The census population projections estimate that by 1999 the\nnational population would be 74.7 million and will reach 84.2 million by 2005, representing an\naverage annual growth rate of about 2.1 percent. The Metro Manila population was estimated at\n10.2 million in 1999 and is forecast to reach 11.3 million by 2005, representing an annual\naverage growth rate of about 1.8 percent; a considerable slowdown in growth rate from that\nexperienced in previous years.\n8. The country\u2019s development potential rests on its well-educated population and abundant\nnatural resources. The Government\u2019s long-term development goal is to transform the country\nfrom an agriculture- and natural resource-based economy to an industrialized economy. This is\nto be achieved with steady growth in per capita income, elimination of poverty, and reduction of\nsocial and economic inequities. The Government\u2019s growth targets, consistent with this long-term\ngoal, visualize gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the range of 4.7 percent for the period\n1999-2004. The Government also aims to significantly reduce poverty from the 1997 level of 32\npercent to about 25 percent by 2004.\n9. The major long-term challenges faced by the economy include rapid population growth;\nthe high incidence of poverty, social and economic inequalities, low productivity, degradation of\nnatural resources, deteriorating environment, and intense international competition. To tackle\nthese problems, the Government\u2019s economic planning and long-term development strategy set\nout in the Philippine National Development Plan and the Medium-Term Philippine Development\nPlan, 1999-2004 has adopted the concept of sustainable development. The Government has\nconfirmed its commitment to sustainable development by emphasizing that future economic\ngrowth  should  be  compatible  with  environmental  protection  and  consistent  with  the\nenvironment\u2019s carrying capacity.\n2. Recent Economic Performance\n10. The Asian currency crisis affected the Philippine peso and interrupted a phase of steady\neconomic growth since the early 1990s. This growth was accompanied by a decline in inflation\nfrom  18.7  percent  in  1991  to  5.1  percent  in  1997.  In  1996,  prudent  fiscal  management,\nmanageable  expenditure  programs,  and  improved  revenue  collection  performance  by  the\nBureau of Customs, Bureau of Internal Revenue, and Bureau of the Treasury, which together\ncollected 95 percent of the total national revenues, enabled the Government to achieve a\nbudget surplus of P6.3 billion. In the second half of 1997, the Asian financial crisis struck and\naffected  several  countries  in  the  region,  including  the  Philippines.  In  July  1997  the  peso\nexchange rate was allowed to float and depreciated from about P26 to the dollar to P46 in\n                                                          \n6\nNational Statistical Coordination Board. 1997. 1997 Philippine Statistical Year Book.

Nevertheless,  for  1997,  total\nrevenue collection increased by 15 percent due mainly to the privatization revenues of P9.4\nbillion, an increase of 67 percent over the previous year. Through good fiscal management, the\nexpected increase in expenditures due to the inflationary effects of the crisis were limited to 16\npercent and the Government was able to register a budget surplus of P1.6 billion for 1997. The\nGovernment felt the full impact of the Asian financial crisis in 1998, with increased inflation,\nnegative economic growth, and a sharp rise in unemployment. The economic difficulties have\nbeen further aggravated by the impact of the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon, which probably had\na more severe detrimental impact on the economy than the Asian currency crisis. Due to\nprolonged  drought  followed  by  unseasonal  rainfall,  the  performance  of  the  agriculture  and\nfisheries sectors contracted by over 11 percent in 1998, posting the worst performance in 30\nyears. The El Ni\u00f1o episode cut the country\u2019s rice output by 30 percent and corn production by\n40 percent. During 1998, GDP contracted by 0.5 percent, inflation averaged 9.7 percent, and\nunemployment rose from 9 percent to 10.3 percent. Interest payments rose by 28 percent from\nP78 billion in 1997 to P100 billion in 1998, mainly as a result of currency devaluation. Operation\nand maintenance expenditures increased by 24 percent due to price escalation. During the\nyear, Government revenues from Bureau of Customs and Bureau of the Treasury declined by\n20 percent and 36 percent, as a result of the slowdown in industrial activity. Income from\nprivatization declined by 82 percent, reflecting reduced Government activity and the prevailing\nweakness in the commercial and property sectors. The Government\u2019s overall fiscal performance\nresulted in a budget deficit of P50 billion in 1998.\n11. Following the negative growth recorded in 1998, the Philippine economy started to\nrecover in 1999 and GDP grew by 3.2 percent. The recovery was supported by a revival in\nagriculture, which grew by over 6 percent, due to favorable weather conditions. The service\nsector remained resilient throughout the crisis period and grew by 4 percent in 1999. However,\nthe industry sector remained weak and posted a growth rate of only 0.5 percent in 1999. The\nlingering  effects  of  weak  domestic  demand  and  low  investment  are  major  concerns  for  a\nsustained recovery. In 1999 the budget deficit was P111 billion, due to poor revenue collection\nand increased expenditure. The Government is expected to record budget deficits for the next\ntwo or three years.\n3. Economic Prospects\n12. Given the ongoing economic adjustments in the region, it is difficult to make a definitive\nassessment of the country\u2019s economic prospects. However, the Philippine economy is expected\nto  recover  to  its  precrisis  sustained  growth  path  in  the  medium  term.  The  exchange  rate\nadjustment  should  improve  the  international  competitiveness  of  Philippine  exports.  The\nadjustment should also discourage further expansion of the bubble created by the rapid growth\nof foreign currency bank credits used for real estate investments. Over the long term, the\neconomy may become more efficient, as a result of the adjustments brought about by the\ncurrency crisis.\n13. In  the  short  term,  the  pace  of  economic  recovery  will  largely  depend  on  prudent\nmacroeconomic  management  and  exogenous  factors  such  as  weather  conditions  and  the\nregional economic environment. The Government faces the difficult task of maintaining crucial\npublic investment without creating a large deficit. The concomitant problem of financing the\ndeficit must be done in a manner that will prevent a rise in interest rates that could exacerbate\nthe difficulties of the corporate and banking sectors. The Government is, therefore, proposing to\nundertake  a  combination  of  external  and  domestic  borrowing,  including  borrowing  from\nmultilateral institutions. On the other hand, monetary policy must balance the need to control", "5\ninflation with the credit needs of the economy. The Government will also have to take measures\nto ameliorate the social impact of the crisis and prevent a rise in poverty.\n14. The long-term effects on the environment of the Asian financial crisis and the abnormal\nweather are difficult to assess at this stage, but are likely to be detrimental. The financial crisis\nhas forced more people into poverty, reversing recent trends of poverty reduction, and resulting\nin increases in the incidence of joblessness, squatting, and migration to the cities from the rural\nareas. This will put further pressure on already overstretched housing, water, sanitation, and\nother municipal services. Also, Government agencies and private sector entities are feeling the\nstrains of the financial crisis and are cutting back on expenditure.\nB. Sector Description and Recent Performance\n1. Environmental Overview\n15. The  sector  may  be  defined  as  the  urban  environment,  with  specific  reference  to\nwastewater management and urban renewal for Metro Manila. Sector indicators are given in\nAppendix 2. According to the Philippine National Development Plan, the Philippine environment\nis classified by the following types of ecosystems: (i) uplands and forests comprising 45 percent\nof the country\u2019s land area and supporting about 30 percent of the people; (ii) coastal and marine\nareas comprising about 80 percent of the country\u2019s territory; (iii) urban areas inhabited by more\nthan half the nation\u2019s population; (iv) agriculture and croplands occupying almost 10 million\nhectares  (ha),  about  34  percent  of  the  country\u2019s  land  area;  and  (v)  freshwater  systems\ncomprising 384 major rivers and 59 lakes. The Pasig River is part of the freshwater ecosystem\nand has an impact on each of the other ecosystem types. The river is part of the Laguna Lake\ncatchment basin, which is the nation\u2019s largest freshwater lake. The basin includes extensive\nupland and forest areas, as well as substantial agricultural lands. The river discharges into the\ncoastal marine ecosystem at Manila Bay and passes through the densely developed heart of\nMetro Manila, the country\u2019s largest and most significant urban area.\n16. Pollution of freshwater ecosystems is a major environmental problem. Four of Metro\nManila\u2019s six rivers, including the Pasig River, are biologically dead. Water quality monitoring\nshows that the pollution concentrations exceed the levels required to meet the water quality\nstandards designated by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) for the\nriver. The main sources of water pollution are domestic wastewater, industrial wastewater,\nsurface water runoff from urban areas, and chemicals from agricultural fertilizer and pesticides.\nMajor  lakes  in  the  country,  particularly  Laguna  Lake,  Lake  Danao,  and  Lake  Lanao  are\nthreatened by siltation from soil erosion and pollution from agricultural, industrial, and urban\nactivities. Eutrophication is a common phenomenon due to discharges of untreated domestic\nand industrial sewage, and surface water runoff from agricultural land and urban areas.\n17. Urban decay is also a growing environmental problem. Metro Manila accounts for about\n14 percent of the total Philippine population and approximately 30 percent of the nation\u2019s urban\npopulation. Rapid urbanization has brought with it a proliferation of informal, unserviced, and\novercrowded settlements. The absence of effective land use planning and urban management\nhas resulted in the deterioration of cities, particularly Metro Manila, as human habitats. The\nmetropolis is now beset with problems including traffic congestion; dilapidated road network;\ninsufficient public transport; inadequate water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management\nservices; drainage and flood control problems; air pollution; and water pollution.", "6\n2. The Pasig River System\n18. The Pasig River is a major river of national significance in the historic, cultural, and\ncommercial  life  of  the  Philippines.  The  river  is  an  important  navigation  route  for  barges\ntransporting bulk goods and materials between factories located along the riverbanks and ships\nanchored in Manila Bay. The river also provides an important drainage and flood protection\nfunction for Metro Manila. In the past, the Pasig River was an important transport route for\npeople and a major recreational amenity. The Pasig River system is a complex waterway\nnetwork comprising the Pasig, Marikina, and San Juan rivers and numerous small streams\n(esteros) and drainage canals. The Pasig River is the main outlet from Laguna Lake and the\nriver system flows to Manila Bay through approximately 27 km of flat, coastal plain and the\nhighly urbanized and densely developed part of Metro Manila. The San Juan River, which drains\nmost of Quezon City and the municipality of San Juan, joins the Pasig River about 9 km\nupstream from Manila Bay. The Marikina River, which rises in the Sierra Madre mountains, joins\nthe Pasig River about 19 km upstream from Manila Bay. The total catchment basin area for\nLaguna Lake, Pasig River, and all the tributaries covers about 4,150 km2. The SDP area is\ndefined as the most densely populated part of the river basin within Metro Manila, comprising\nabout 215 km2, or about 5 percent of the drainage basin land area, including the Pasig River,\nMarikina River downstream from Marikina Bridge, and the San Juan River. The river is tidal, and\nthe flow is subject to wide seasonal variations, with high flows reaching 275 cubic meters per\nsecond (m3/sec) occurring between October and November, and low flows dropping to 12\nm3/sec between April and May. The highest flows occur during the rainy season, when large\nparts of the urban area are susceptible to frequent flooding, particularly in the vicinity of the\nriverbanks. Low river flows occur during the dry season when high tides at Manila Bay cause\nthe normal river flow to reverse direction, and polluted water drains back into Laguna Lake. The\nSDP  area  includes  the  administrative  districts  of  11  Metro  Manila  local  government  units\n(LGUs), including 8 cities7 and 3 municipalities.8\n3. Water Quality Standards\n19. The Pasig, San Juan, and Marikina rivers are designated as Class C water by DENR.\nDENR Administrative Order (AO) 34 defines Class C waters as suitable for the propagation and\ngrowth of fish and other aquatic resources; recreational use for secondary contact sports like\nboating;  and  after  treatment,  for  industrial  water  supply  for  manufacturing  processes.  The\nprincipal water quality criteria for Class C water are dissolved oxygen (DO), 5 milligrams per liter\n(mg/l), minimum; biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), 10 mg/l, maximum; and total coliforms,\n5,000 most probable number per 100 milliliters (MPN/100 ml), maximum. Currently, the Pasig\nRiver does not meet these water quality standards. Over the years, the river system has\nbecome polluted and environmentally degraded through the indiscriminate and direct discharge\nof untreated wastewater from industrial and municipal sources and the dumping of solid wastes.\nThe worst environmental conditions occur during the dry season, when the river flow is at its\nlowest and consists mainly of wastewater discharges. At these times, the river takes on the\nappearance and smell of raw sewage. Water quality monitoring shows that during low flow,\nBOD reaches 120 mg/l, 12 times higher than the permitted level for Class C water; DO drops to\nzero; and total coliforms exceed the MPN/100 ml standard by up to several thousand degrees.\n                                                          \n7\nThe cities are Caloocan, Makati, Mandaluyong, Manila, Marikina, Pasay, Pasig, and Quezon.\n8\nThe municipalities are Pateros, San Juan, and Taguig.", "7\n4. Assimilative Capacity\n20. The river\u2019s assimilative capacity represents the amount of BOD load that it can absorb\nand remain within the Class C standards set by AO 34 for BOD and DO. The assimilative\ncapacity is affected by several factors including the (i) distribution of BOD loading along the\nriver; (ii) river flow, which varies seasonally, the lowest assimilative capacity occurs when river\nflow is at its lowest; (iii) water temperature, which varies seasonally \u2014 as the temperature\nincreases  the  DO  level  decreases;  and  (iv)  the  reaeration  capacity  of  the  river,  which  is\ndetermined by the physical characteristics, rivers with fast and turbulent stream flow have higher\nreaeration  capacity  than  slow-flowing  rivers  such  as  the  Pasig.  DENR  has  developed  a\ncomputer simulation model to predict river water quality. Through this model, the assimilative\ncapacity of the Pasig River for BOD is estimated at 200 tons per day (t/d). If the total daily\ndischarge of BOD to the river is kept below this level, it is predicted that the Class C water\nquality parameters for BOD and DO will be met. However, the river water quality is well below\nClass C standard, and there is some concern that the true assimilative capacity of the Pasig\nRiver may be considerably lower than 200 t/d of BOD.\n5. Pollution Loading and Targets\n21. The current BOD loading entering the Pasig River is estimated at 242 t/d, which is 21\npercent above the river\u2019s estimated maximum assimilative capacity. The principal sources of\nthis pollution load are domestic wastewater, contributing 168 t/d of BOD; industrial wastewater,\ncontributing 69 t/d of BOD; and solid waste, contributing 5 t/d of BOD. Without any sewerage or\nsanitation interventions, the pollution load entering the river is expected to increase to 269 t/d in\n2005, 308 t/d in 2010, and 359 t/d in 2015. All of this increase is expected to come from\ndomestic  sewage  because  the  total  BOD  load  due  to  industrial  wastewater  is  forecast  to\ndecrease from 69 t/d in 2000 to 51 t/d in 2015, and BOD load due to solid waste will be\neliminated by 2005. The planned activities for providing sewerage and sanitation services under\nthe Metropolitan Manila Waterworks and Sewerage Systems (MWSS) concession agreements\nwill enable the environmental condition of the Pasig River to remain unchanged compared with\nthe present situation. In other words, the pollution control interventions planned by MWSS will\nnot be sufficient to restore Class C water quality to the Pasig River, but will only cancel out the\nexpected increase in pollution from population growth and greater water consumption within the\nriver basin catchment area.\n6. Urban Conditions in the Pasig River Basin\n22. The urban areas adjacent to the Pasig River have a number of distinct environmental\ncharacteristics. Near the lower reaches of the river around Intramuros, San Nicholas, Binondo,\nQuiapo, and San Miguel lies the historic core and traditional business and commercial center of\nMetro Manila. Problems in this area include dilapidated buildings, severe traffic congestion,\ninadequate  infrastructure,  riverbank  squatters,  and  polluted  esteros.  Further  to  the  east,\nbetween Malaca\u00f1ang Palace and Sta. Ana race course, the dominant land use is industrial;\nmuch of the industry is obsolete. Depressed, low-income housing and squatter settlements are\ninterspersed among the industries. The upstream section of the river to the Napindan Channel,\nnear Laguna Lake, including the San Juan and Marikina rivers, is characterized by mixed land\ndevelopment, covering industrial, commercial, and residential uses. Environmental problems\nalong this stretch of river arise mainly from large industrial operations and squatter housing\nareas. The riverbanks contain substantial areas of housing for the urban poor in the form of\nestablished housing where land title has been determined, and informal housing occupied by\nsquatters located in and over water courses and along riverbank easement areas. Common", "8\nproblems include unacceptable living conditions, dilapidated structures, exposure to flood risk,\nfire hazards, and inadequate sanitation and public health facilities. The structure of the industrial\neconomy in the area appears to be changing, and many factories are closing down or relocating\nto sites outside Metro Manila. This has resulted in a proliferation of derelict and underutilized\nindustrial sites such as the former Marcelo Steel Works and the Benguet Foundry in the Sta.\nAna area. The changing nature of the industry sector is resulting in the blighting of urban land\nthat could be redeveloped for more intensive, higher economic order land uses.\n7. Institutional Framework\na. The Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission\n23. The institutional arrangements for the Pasig River rehabilitation are potentially complex\nbecause many central and local government agencies have responsibilities for different aspects\nof  environmental  management;  urban  renewal;  and  the  development,  management,  and\nmaintenance of the Pasig River system. To resolve this, the Government has created the Pasig\nRiver Rehabilitation Commission (PRRC) to be the executing agency responsible for all aspects\nof  river  rehabilitation,  including  coordination  with  the  various  implementing  agencies.  The\nGovernment created the PRRC in January 1999 through Executive Order (EO) 54, as amended\nby EO 65. The PRRC was created to ensure that the waterway is rehabilitated to its historically\npristine condition conducive to transport, recreation, and tourism.\n24. The PRRC is headed by the secretary, Department of Budget and Management as\nchairperson. The cochair is the chairperson, Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA), and\nthe secretaries or heads of the following Departments and agencies are members: DENR;\nDepartment  of  Finance;  Department  of  the  Interior  and  Local  Government;  Department  of\nNational  Defense;  Department  of  Public  Works  and  Highways;  Department  of  Tourism;\nDepartment of Trade and Industry; Department of Transport and Communications; Housing and\nUrban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC); Office of the Executive Secretary, Office of\nthe President; and three representatives of the private sector, appointed by the President.\n25. To achieve its mandate of rehabilitating the Pasig River, the PRRC has powers and\nfunctions to (i) prepare an updated and integrated master plan for the rehabilitation of the Pasig\nRiver, taking into account its potential for transport, recreation, and tourism; (ii) ensure that the\neasements provided for in the Civil Code and other related laws are observed, including all the\nesteros and waterways that drain into the Pasig River; (iii) integrate and coordinate all programs\nrelated to the rehabilitation of the Pasig River such as, but not limited to, the PRDP (PD No.\n274, Proclamation No. 704, Series of 1995) and the Pasig River Environmental Management\nand Rehabilitation Sector Development Program;9 (iv) abate the dumping of untreated industrial\nwastewater and sewage into the river, including all acts and omissions in violation of the\nPollution  Control  Law  and  other  related  laws;  (v)  relocate  settlers,  squatters,  and  other\nunauthorized or unlawful occupants along the riverbanks; (vi) undertake civil works such as\ndredging, clearing of structures, and cleaning the river and all esteros and waterways that drain\ninto  it;  (vii)  submit  regular  reports  to  the  Office  of  the  President  on  the  status  of  the\nGovernment\u2019s efforts in rehabilitating and developing the Pasig River; and (viii) coordinate with\nall Government agencies and offices, including the LGUs, regarding the necessary measures to\nimplement EO 54.\n                                                          \n9\nADB\u2019s proposed SDP loan is specifically mentioned in EO 54.", "9\n26. The initial requirements of the PRRC was financed from contingency funds. Also, the\nPasig  River  Development  Council,  the  Presidential  Task  Force  on  the  Pasig  River\nRehabilitation, and the River Rehabilitation Secretariat were abolished by EO 54. The functions,\nequipment, and logistics of the abolished units were transferred to the PRRC, and all funds\nreceived by the abolished agencies that were contributed for the Pasig River rehabilitation were\ntransferred to the PRRC. The PRRC\u2019s implementing rules and regulations are in place, and it\nhas set up five working committees to be responsible for various aspects of river rehabilitation.\nThey include (i) environmental management committee under the leadership of DENR; (ii)\nhousing and resettlement committee under the leadership of HUDCC; (iii) riverbanks, transport,\nand tourism development committee under the leadership of MMDA; (iv) flood control committee\nunder the leadership of DPWH; and (v) information and advocacy committee, also under the\nleadership of MMDA.\n27. The PRRC has also created a project management office (PMO) to provide technical,\nadministrative,  and  logistical  support,  and  serve  as  the  link  between  the  PRRC  and  the\ncommittees.  The  PMO  is  headed  by  an  executive  director  assisted  by  deputy  executive\ndirectors for finance and operations. The functions of the executive director are to provide full-\ntime assistance to PRRC\u2019s chairperson and cochair in the following: (i) administering and\nsupervising personnel; (ii) coordinating and overseeing the Pasig River rehabilitation efforts\nthrough the PMO and committees; (iii) reorienting, evaluating, and integrating plans, programs,\nand projects for Pasig River rehabilitation for submission to, and approval of, the PRRC; (iv)\nmonitoring the activities of the committees; (v) establishing linkages between the PRRC and the\nvarious committees; (vi) recommending policy guidelines and directions to the PRRC for Pasig\nRiver system rehabilitation; and (vii) preparing reports and performing other functions and duties\ndetermined by the PRRC. As the PRRC is newly created, it has not yet established a track\nrecord,  but  the  early  signs  are  that  it  is  highly  committed  and  professional  with  strong\nleadership, a strong mandate, and adequate resources to discharge its duties and obligations.\nThere is a high degree of confidence in its ability to effectively execute the SDP and coordinate\nthe implementation activities of other agencies. The PRRC\u2019s organizational structure is given in\nAppendix 3.\n28. The  PRRC  shall  maintain  the  following  linkages  with  other  agencies:  (i)  National\nEconomic and Development Authority, on planning through the submission of the master plan,\ndevelopment plans, and investment programs for integration into the Philippine Medium-Term\nDevelopment  Plan  and  Public  Investment  Program,  and  clearance  by  the  Investment\nCoordinating Committee; (ii) HUDCC, MMDA, National Housing Authority (NHA), and the LGUs\non  preparation  and  implementation  of  the  Pasig  River  land  use  plan  and  riverbanks\ndevelopment, with particular reference to the establishment of EPAs, including the relocation of\nsquatters and development of the vacated areas for beneficial environmental use and the\nupgrading  of  adjacent  urban  renewal  areas;  and  (iii)  DENR,  Laguna  Lake  Development\nAuthority (LLDA), and the LGUs on the coordination and implementation of plans to monitor and\nenforce environmental standards and pollution control measures.\nb. Other Agencies\n29. Effective water quality management is compounded by the number of central and local\ngovernment  agencies  involved  in  various  aspects  of  environmental  monitoring  and\nmanagement.  DENR  has  nationwide  responsibility  for  issuing  environmental  compliance\ncertificates for projects, monitoring effluent discharges, enforcing compliance with environmental\nregulations and standards, and ensuring, through its Environmental Management Bureau and\nNational Capital Region office, that environmental monitoring and enforcement are undertaken", "10\nwithin Metro Manila. The LLDA has responsibility for environmental monitoring and enforcement\nwithin the Laguna Lake drainage basin, which includes Metro Manila. LLDA differs from DENR\nin that it has the authority to impose, collect, and retain pollution discharge fees and fines from\npolluters  not  in  compliance  with  regulations.  MMDA  is  responsible  for  development  and\nimplementation of policies for physical framework planning, zoning, land use planning, and solid\nwaste disposal, and has been involved in removing solid waste from the Pasig River. MMDA\nalso oversees metropolitan-wide policies, such as establishment and maintenance of riverbank\neasements for EPAs, which are approved by the Metro Manila Mayors\u2019 Council and managed\nby  the  LGUs.  MWSS  is  responsible  for  providing  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  sewerage\nservices throughout its service area, including all the LGUs within Metro Manila. MWSS has\nprivatized its operation and has entered into concession agreements with two private sector\noperators  for  the  operation,  management,  maintenance,  and  further  development  of  water\nsupply  and  sewerage  services  for  Metro  Manila.  HUDCC  is  responsible  for  the  planning,\ncoordination, and management of housing for the urban poor and for providing resettlement\nsites for the squatter families that have to be relocated from the riverbanks and esteros. The\nimplementation of resettlement schemes is done by NHA, an agency of HUDCC, in consultation\nand cooperation with the affected LGUs. DPWH is responsible for engineering works on the\nriver channel, such as the construction and repair of revetments, river walls, and channel\ndredging.\n30. The LGUs play an important, though largely untapped, role in rehabilitating the Pasig\nRiver system. In general, local governments are responsible for the community preparation of\nsquatter families to be relocated, physical improvements in the areas vacated by squatters,\nurban upgrading and renewal of areas adjacent to the river, and organizing community-based\nsolid waste collection programs. Inclusion and involvement of the concerned LGUs in the Pasig\nRiver rehabilitation program is critical to its success, and supports the ongoing process of\ndecentralization  in  the  shelter  and  urban  development  sectors.  The  city  of  Manila  has\nsucceeded in relocating squatters and establishing successful riverside parks with community\nfacilities. Other LGUs, such as the cities of Makati and Mandaluyong, are currently involved in\nin-city  relocation  of  squatter  residents  to  local  social  housing  projects.  Marikina  City  has\nimplemented a highly successful relocation of about 5,000 squatter families from the banks of\nthe Marikina River to an in-city resettlement site and has redeveloped the vacated area into a\nriverside park.\nC. Constraints and Issues\n31. Monitoring  and  enforcement  of  environmental  regulations  and  effluent  discharge\nstandards  have  been  inadequate  and  hampered  by  a  lack  of  institutional  capacity  and\ninsufficient information about pollution sources. Effective water quality management involves (i)\nformulating and implementing environmental management policies, plans, and programs; (ii)\nissuing consistent environmental regulations and effluent standards for wastewater discharges\nthat are monitorable and enforceable; (iii) setting pollution absorption limits for river segments\nand monitoring the ambient water quality of the river system; (iv) identifying, measuring, and\nmonitoring point and nonpoint sources of pollution entering the river system; and (v) enforcing\nenvironmental regulations and effluent discharge standards on a regular and consistent basis.\n32. The existing deficiencies in the institutional capacity for environmental management of\nthe  Pasig  River  system  indicates  inadequate  investment  and  budgetary  support  by  the\nGovernment. For example, the 1999 budget for the Environmental Management Bureau was\nonly P68 million for the whole country. Of this, only a very small amount was allocated for\nenvironmental management activities in the Pasig River basin. The Government is determined", "11\nto succeed in rehabilitating the Pasig River system and maintaining the improved water quality\nstandards, and is committing substantial levels of investment and resources to be appropriately\nallocated through annual budgets to the concerned agencies. The costs of effective wastewater\nmanagement and pollution control arise from the monitoring and enforcement costs incurred by\nthe responsible Government environmental management agencies, and the costs incurred by\nenterprises to abate pollution and meet regulations and standards.\n33. Most residential and commercial properties in Metro Manila use individual septic tanks\nfor domestic sewage disposal, and only 10 percent of properties are connected to sewers. It is\nestimated that the Pasig River catchment basin currently contains about 1 million septic tanks,\nand this number is forecast to reach about 1.25 million by 2015. To maintain operational\nefficiency, septic tanks need to be desludged at intervals of two to seven years depending on\ntank design and usage. Septic tanks that are full of sludge provide no detention time for\nsewage, and suspended solids (SS) are unable to settle. Consequently, the discharged effluent\nretains high levels of SS, BOD, and fecal bacteria. In practice, septic tanks in Metro Manila are\nrarely  desludged,  and  it  is  estimated  that  only  about  15  percent  of  tanks  are  properly\nmaintained. To tackle this problem effectively, it is necessary to empty septic tanks on a regular\nbasis and treat the collected septage. The maintained septic tanks are serviced mainly by\nprivate contractors none of whom have treatment facilities for the collected septage. It is likely\nthat most private contractors dispose of collected septage directly into water courses, the Pasig\nRiver,  or  the  sea  without  treatment,  causing  considerable  pollution,  nuisance,  and\nenvironmental damage. The private contractors should be regulated and monitored to ensure\nproper septage treatment and disposal. The private contractors will be allowed to use the\nseptage treatment facility proposed under the SDP, but will be required to pay the appropriate\ndischarge and treatment fee based on the volume of septage delivered to the plant.\n34. The MWSS concession agreement with private sector operators sets time-bound service\ncoverage targets for water supply, sanitation, and sewerage. In this context, sanitation means\nseptic tank maintenance. The water supply targets are set to reach about 95 percent by 2006,\nand be sustained at that level throughout the concession period until 2021. The sewerage and\nsanitation targets are much lower and are to be achieved much later. Some areas will not\nreceive sanitation coverage throughout the concession period; most will not begin to receive\nsewerage coverage until after 2006. The high level of water supply coverage, increasing urban\npopulation, and rising per capita water consumption will lead to an increase in the volume of\nuntreated municipal sewage being discharged to the public system, and ultimately, the Pasig\nRiver, unless effective sanitation coverage is introduced over a wider area at an earlier date\nthan envisaged in the concession agreements. Under the terms of the concession agreement,\nthe concessionaires are not obliged to advance or increase the sanitation coverage targets.\nAlso, the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC), Department of Justice, has\nissued a legal opinion10 stating that the provision of sanitation services is not an exclusive right\ngranted  to  the  MWSS  concessionaires  under  the  Concession  Agreement.  The  MWSS\nconcession operators\u2019 time-bound service coverage targets for water, sewerage, and sanitation\nare given in Appendix 4.\n35. It  is  further  estimated  that  there  are  up  to  10,000  industrial  and  commercial\nestablishments in the Pasig River basin, of which about 2,000, including 400 along the Pasig\nRiver banks, are discharging untreated wastewater into the Pasig River system. To reduce\n                                                          \n10\nOpinion No. 206, Series of 1999, Opinion on whether the provision of sanitation services is an exclusive right\ngranted to the MWSS concessionaires, under the Concession Agreement, 20 October 1999.", "12\npollution  due  to  industrial  wastewater,  it  is  necessary  to  bring  these  establishments  into\ncompliance with environmental regulations and discharge standards.\n36. To establish EPAs along the riverbanks, it is necessary to relocate squatter families\nliving within the easement areas and develop EPAs for parks and other beneficial environmental\nuses. To promote urban renewal, it is necessary to initiate slum upgrading in poorly serviced\nareas adjacent to EPAs.\nD. Government Objectives and Strategy\n37. Environmental  degradation  and  its  impact  on  the  population  and  economic  growth\ncontinue to be a major challenge for the Government. All major environmental concerns such as\nwater and air pollution, degraded forests and watersheds, and deterioration of marine and\ncoastal resources are exacerbated by increased population pressure and intensified economic\nactivities. To address these environmental concerns and to meet its international commitment to\nsustainable development, the Government adopted Philippine Agenda 21 in September 1996 as\nits national action plan to integrate environmental considerations into social and economic\ndevelopment decision making.\n38. The Government recognizes that to address its environmental problems, the country\nneeds not only increased financial investment for environmental rehabilitation and improvement,\nbut  also  far-ranging  policy  reforms  and  enforcement  measures  for  a  more  effective\nenvironmental  management  system.  The  major  issues  to  be  addressed  in  environmental\nmanagement  include  (i)  rationalizing  the  environmental  regulations  and  standards,  (ii)\nstrengthening the institutional structure for environmental management at the national and local\nlevels, (iii) developing institutional capacity and capability for environmental monitoring and\nenforcement, (iv) introducing market-based instruments for pollution control, (v) introducing\ndemand-management techniques for power and water supply, (vi) undertaking environmental\nawareness and education programs, and (vii) introducing the polluter pays principle on a wider\nscale.\n39. The 1998 National Development Plan provides guidance on economic and social policy\nreforms within the overall objectives for economic, social, and cultural transformation of the\ncountry envisaged in the Philippine 2000 concept. The key objectives of the Government\u2019s\ndevelopment strategy are to reduce poverty, improve health and education, and protect the\nenvironment.  The  strategy  recognizes  the  need  for  sustained  high  economic  growth  as  a\nnecessary condition for poverty reduction and stresses the need for better access by the poor to\n(i) publicly provided services and facilities such as health care, education, and sanitation; (ii)\ninfrastructure facilities such as water, electricity, and roads; and (iii) economic assets like land.\n40. The Government initiated the rehabilitation of Pasig River in 1989, with a grant from the\nDanish International Development Assistance (Danida). Danida provided assistance to develop\nthe capability and capacity of DENR, initiate water quality monitoring for the Pasig River, build a\ndatabase of polluting industries, develop and calibrate a mathematical model for water quality\nmanagement, and prepare the Pasig River Rehabilitation Program, with the primary objective of\nrehabilitating the Pasig River system to Class C water quality. Danida also provided some\nlimited assistance with squatter relocation for people living on stilted housing over the water, but\nnot on a large-scale basis. DENR set up the River Rehabilitation Secretariat to coordinate and\nmonitor implementation of the program, promote public awareness, and upgrade water quality in\nthe river. However, due to the Government\u2019s resource and capacity constraints, only modest", "13\nprogress  has  been  made  in  achieving  the  Rehabilitation  Program  objectives.  Danida  is\ncontinuing to support the Secretariat\u2019s activities, which have been transferred to the PRRC.\nE. External Assistance to the Sector\n41. Official external assistance to the Philippines is provided by ADB, the World Bank, and\nother  multilateral  funding  sources,  including  the  United  Nations  system,  the  European\nCommission, and bilateral agencies from Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Japan, and\nthe United States. Japan accounts for 53 percent of total commitments, and the World Bank and\nADB for 23 and 22 percent, respectively.\n42. DPWH, with assistance from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC),11 is\npreparing  the  Pasig-Marikina  River  Channel  Improvement  Project,  aimed  at  repairing,\nrehabilitating,  and  improving  the  revetments,  parapet  walls,  and  drainage  works;  and\nundertaking selective channel dredging from the mouth of the Pasig River at Manila Bay,\nupstream  to  Marikina  Bridge  on  the  Marikina  River.  The  JBIC-funded  project  is  aimed  at\nimproving  the  flood  control  and  drainage  characteristics  of  the  Pasig  River,  and  is\ncomplementary to the proposed SDP, which is aimed at improving water quality and promoting\nurban renewal.\n43. JBIC is processing the Environmental Infrastructure Credit Support Program, Phase II.\nThe program is a \u00a520.5 billion loan facility, channeled through the Development Bank of the\nPhilippines to support investments that reduce industrial pollution, thereby improving industrial\nefficiency and environmental quality. The target sectors are industry, mining, and services.\nEligible projects include pollution control, efficient use of natural resources, improvement of\noccupational health and safety, enhancement of environmental management systems, and\nenvironmental infrastructure under build-operate-transfer arrangements.\n44. The Manila Second Sewerage Project, funded through a $57 million World Bank loan,\nhas prepared a feasibility study and program for septage collection and disposal. The first phase\nof the program was approved in 1998. The facilities to be provided include (i) improvements to\nthe central sewerage system, (ii) construction of septage loading stations on the Pasig River to\ntransport  untreated  septage  by  barge  for  ocean  dumping,  (iii)  improvements  to  the  Ayala\nsewage treatment plant, and (iv) expansion of the Dagat-Dagatan sewage treatment plant.\nThese sewerage and septage management facilities are included in the overall sewerage and\nsanitation  targets  of  the  MWSS  concession  operators.  The  septage  management  facilities\nproposed  under  the  SDP  are  complementary  and  will  increase  the  sanitation  coverage,\nparticularly  for  the  urban  poor  living  in  riverside  communities.  The  Japan  International\nCooperation Agency financed the preparation of a sewerage master plan for MWSS in 1996.\nThe master plan contains recommendations for the MWSS service area up to 2015.\nF. ADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n45. Environmental degradation in the country has been an ADB concern for many years. In\nthe  past,  the  Bank\u2019s  lending  was  mainly  focused  on  restoration  and  rehabilitation  of  the\ncountry\u2019s forests and fisheries resources. In the area of urban environment, ADB made its first\nloan for Manila environmental improvement in 1980.12 Since then, however, no new loans were\n                                                          \n11\nThis support was initially from the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, which on 1 October 1999, was merged\nwith the Export-Import Bank of Japan to form JBIC.\n12\nLoan 457-PHI: Manila Sewerage Project, for $42.8 million, approved on 24 June 1980.", "14\nmade specifically for urban environmental improvement until the recent Metro Manila Air Quality\nImprovement Sector Development Program. This lengthy lending gap was partly attributable to\nthe  economic  and  political  situation  in  the  1980s  and  early  1990s  that  did  not  allow  the\nGovernment to give high priority to the problems of urban pollution and environmental concerns.\nADB has also approved 20 TAs for environmental improvement in the country.\n46. Under ADB\u2019s country assistance plan, 1999-2001, the policy support program for the\nPhilippines  will  focus  on  (i)  involving  the  private  sector  in  infrastructure  provision;13  (ii)\ndeveloping  domestic  capital  markets;  (iii)  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  decentralization\nprogram; (iv) capacity building for key national agencies and LGUs; (v) sustainable natural\nresource management, conservation, and regulation of air and water pollution; (vi) assistance\nfor the social sectors, including health, education, sanitation, and water supply; and (vii) poverty\nreduction and the promotion of socioeconomic equity.\n47. For the environment sector, ADB will take a more systematic approach to help the\nGovernment address the environmental concerns arising from the sustainable development\npolicies stipulated in Philippine Agenda 21. In particular, emphasis will be placed on supporting\nthe reform initiatives needed to establish a more effective legal and institutional system for\nenvironmental management. In its lending operations, ADB will support resource mobilization\nand help the Government in its efforts to tackle the serious problems of urban environmental\npollution.  Initially,  lending  for  pollution  control  will  focus  on  Metro  Manila\u2019s  environmental\nproblems where improvements in environmental management and pollution control are urgently\nneeded  and  are  warranted  as  a  national  priority.  ADB  will  also  focus  on  improving  the\neffectiveness of the overall environmental management system through TA and promoting the\nparticipation of all stakeholders with environmental concerns.\n48. In urban development, ADB will continue to support the Government\u2019s urban sector\npolicy reforms. This will include support for the decentralization policy through institutional\nstrengthening and capacity building for LGUs. Further privatization of water supply operations\nwill be encouraged, with concomitant reform of sector policies and strengthening of regulations,\nas well as public-private partnerships for the delivery and management of essential urban\ninfrastructure facilities and municipal services. ADB-assisted projects will also encourage fair\nlabor practices, and attention will be given to urban environmental management. Environmental\naspects will be incorporated into integrated urban environmental management and components\nthat  interact  with  each  other,  such  as  water  supply,  sanitation,  drainage,  and  solid  waste\nmanagement, and will be considered in a comprehensive and holistic way. Poverty reduction\nand community participation in project design and implementation will be a prime focus of\nattention in project formulation. ADB will provide capacity-building assistance for LGUs and\nservice delivery agencies through lending and TA programs. ADB also seeks cofinancing to\nprovide institutional development support for its integrated urban development projects.\nG. Lessons Learned\n49. The SDP will be ADB\u2019s first experience with wastewater environmental management and\nriver rehabilitation in urban areas in the Philippines. However, from ADB\u2019s recent experience\nwith a similar project14 in Shanghai, People\u2019s Republic of China, it is well recognized that to be\neffective, environmental management must be supported at the highest levels of government\nand operate within the framework of a strong policy agenda. The policy agenda should be\n                                                          \n13\nLoan 7154/1696-PHI: Maynilad Water Services, Inc., for $171 million, approved on 14 September 1999.\n14\nLoan 1692-PRC: Suzhou Creek Rehabilitation Project, for $300 million, approved on 29 June 1999.", "15\nfounded on the basic principle that the producers of pollution should pay proportionately for\nprotecting the environment, and be required to provide effective waste treatment and disposal\nmeasures. Well-developed institutions with adequate capability, capacity, and resources are\nalso essential to monitor wastewater discharges and enforce environmental regulations and\nstandards.  Environmental  regulations  and  standards  that  are  appropriate,  transparent,\nmonitorable, and enforceable are also necessary if the policy agenda is to be effective, and the\nenvironmental management agencies are able to operate. It is important also to raise public\nawareness of environmental issues, particularly for the benefits that accrue to civil society, as a\nresult of creating and maintaining a clean, green, and healthy urban environment.\nIV. THE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\nA. Rationale\n50. As the Philippine economy recovers from the Asian financial crisis, the Government is\nindicating its strong commitment to economic development and growth that incorporates sound\nenvironmental  management  practices.  Public  sector  policymakers  are  required  to  give\nenvironmental  concerns  a  high  priority  in  the  planning,  design,  and  implementation  of\ndevelopment projects. Consequently, it is incumbent upon the private sector to also follow the\nprinciples of sustainable development, and ensure that economic development is not achieved\nat the cost of resource depletion and environmental degradation as frequently happened in the\npast.\n51. To address the environmental problems facing Metro Manila, particularly for wastewater\nmanagement, urban renewal, and sustainable rehabilitation of Pasig River water quality, it is\nnecessary to implement an integrated set of policy reforms covering institutional, regulatory,\ntechnical, and financial aspects of environmental management, and initiate a series of specific\ninterventions  aimed  at  relocating  squatters,  establishing  EPAs,  promoting  urban  renewal,\nintroducing regular septic tank maintenance, providing septage treatment and disposal capacity,\nand supporting institutional capacity building.\n52. The policy reforms are far-reaching, and require strong Government commitment to\nachieve and sustain them. The physical interventions are needed to support the policy agenda\nand make a significant contribution to environmental management and river rehabilitation. For\nthese reasons, the SDP modality is appropriate. The proposed SDP includes a program loan to\nsupport  policy  reforms  and  an  investment  loan  to  support  sector  investment  in  public\ninfrastructure and capacity building.\n53. The costs to be borne by the Government for Pasig River environmental management\nand rehabilitation are estimated at $750 million equivalent from 2000 to 2004. These costs will\narise from (i) implementation of the first phase of PRDP, estimated at $300 million, covering\nurban  renewal  ($55  million),  establishment  of  EPAs,  including  relocation  of  about  10,000\nsquatter families ($65 million), sewerage and sewage treatment ($100 million), sanitation ($30\nmillion), industrial waste management ($30 million), and solid waste disposal ($20 million),\nwhich will be supported, in part, by the SDP with respect to sanitation, establishment of EPAs,\nand urban renewal; (ii) the provision of housing, resettlement, and livelihood development for\nabout 50,000 additional squatter families living along riverbanks, creeks, and esteros in other\nparts of the Pasig River drainage basin ($350 million); and (iii) flood control and drainage\nprojects, including revetments, river walls, and channel dredging along the Pasig, Marikina, and\nSan Juan rivers ($100 million). Also, the DENR and LLDA will incur substantial costs to develop,", "16\nimplement, and administer a better environmental monitoring, management, and enforcement\nprogram for Metro Manila, based on enhanced environmental regulations and standards.\n54. In addition, substantial costs will be incurred by industrial and commercial enterprises to\nabate  wastewater  pollution  and  come  into  compliance  with  environmental  regulations  and\ndischarge standards. Although a complete demand analysis has not been completed, it is\nestimated that the total cost of installing adequate on-site wastewater treatment facilities for\nindustrial and commercial enterprises discharging waste into the Pasig River basin is about\nP10.0 billion, equivalent to $250 million. Enterprises may be able to internalize these costs\nthrough productivity gains and operational benefits, and achieve the desired environmental\nstandards  by  introducing  clean  production  technology,  waste  minimization  and  resource\nrecovery methods, and on-site industrial wastewater treatment facilities. The environmental\nmanagement authorities should also encourage enterprises to adopt more environment-friendly\nbehavior and practices by providing incentives to enterprises that achieve wastewater pollution\ncontrol  benefits  from  process  changes  and  the  introduction  of  technology  that  reduces  or\neliminates  industrial  wastewater  pollution  in  addition  to  end-of-pipe  wastewater  treatment\nsystems.\n55. The rationale for the SDP is to strengthen the environmental management policies for\nurban  areas;  develop  the  wastewater  management  and  pollution  control,  monitoring,  and\nenforcement  capacities  of  the  concerned  national  and  local  government  agencies;  and\nrehabilitate  the  Pasig  River,  its  tributaries,  and  esteros  to  achieve  a  clean  and  green\nenvironment  for  the  river  basin.  The  aim  is  to  restore  water  quality  and  create  an  urban\nenvironment for Metro Manila that makes it a clean, pleasant, and attractive place to live, work,\nand conduct business. The water quality improvements will be sustained by ensuring that\ncredible  monitoring  and  enforcement  mechanisms  are  put  in  place.  This  will  be  achieved\nthrough the adoption of a long-term policy reform agenda and implementation of the first phase\nof the PRDP for river system rehabilitation.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n56. The sector objectives are to improve environmental management of the Pasig River\nbasin  within  Metro  Manila,  particularly  for  wastewater  management  and  to  promote  urban\nrenewal. The specific purpose is to restore and sustain Class C water quality standard for the\nPasig River, establish EPAs along the riverbanks, and upgrade adjacent urban renewal areas.\n57. The policy reform agenda will cover (i) adopting and implementing Phase 1 of the PRDP,\n(ii) providing sanitation services in addition to the MWSS concession agreement targets, (iii)\nestablishing a wastewater discharge permit system for Metro Manila, (iv) improving domestic\nsolid waste management for riverside communities, (v) establishing EPAs along the riverbanks,\n(vi) strengthening environmental regulations and discharge standards, (vii) strengthening water\nquality  monitoring,  (viii)  enhancing  public  awareness,  and  (ix)  strengthening  institutional\ncapability and capacity.\n58. The first five-year phase, 2000-2004, of the PRDP will be implemented to initiate water\nquality  improvements,  commence  urban  renewal  along  the  riverbanks,  and  improve  living\nconditions and public health standards for riverside communities. This will be achieved by (i)\nrelocating squatters from the riverbanks and developing EPAs; (ii) upgrading infrastructure and\nmunicipal services in adjacent urban renewal areas; (iii) introducing septic tank cleaning service\nand septage treatment plants to reduce the volume and concentration of untreated municipal\nsewage being discharged into the river; (iv) improving the quality of industrial wastewater before", "17\nit is discharged into the river through improved environmental monitoring and enforcement, and\nthe introduction of a wastewater discharge permit system to Metro Manila; (v) eliminating the\nillegal dumping of municipal solid waste into the river system; and (vi) providing consulting\nservices  to  provide  project  implementation  assistance.  TA  for  institutional  strengthening,\ncapacity building, community involvement, and stakeholder participation will be provided.\nC. Policy Framework and Actions\n59. To bring about the stated sector objectives and achieve sustainable water quality and\nenvironmental  management  improvements  for  the  Pasig  River  basin,  the  Government  has\nrecognized the need to identify and implement a program of policy reforms. Consequently, a\npolicy framework and time-bound action plan were agreed to; they create the institutional,\nfinancial, and regulatory conditions necessary to successfully implement the PRDP and sustain\nthe  environmental  improvements  thus  gained.  The  major  policy  priorities  and  time-bound\nactions are applicable throughout Metro Manila, and are described in the policy letter and set\nout in the policy matrix attached as Appendix 5.\n1. Adopt and Implement the PRDP\n60. Approval, adoption, and implementation of the first phase of the PRDP will provide the\nplanning framework for improving water quality in the Pasig River, promoting urban renewal,\nand improving living conditions and public health standards for riverside communities. The\nPRDP  is  a  result  of  extensive  discussions  among  Government  agencies,  LGUs,  utility\ncompanies, industrialists, the private sector, and the NGOs involved in the effort to rehabilitate\nthe Pasig River, and was developed with ADB assistance through TA 2803 (footnote 4). The\nPRDP  builds  on  the  plans  and  proposals  developed  over  recent  years,  and  provides  a\ncomprehensive  and  integrated  framework  for  their  implementation.  It  is  complementary  to\nexisting plans and proposals, including LGU land use plans and community-led initiatives. The\nPRDP recommends policy guidelines, strategies, an implementation schedule, and a framework\nfor sustainable development aimed at rehabilitating the Pasig River. It includes strategies for (i)\nphysical development framework implementation, (ii) sanitation and septage management, (iii)\nindustrial wastewater management, and (iv) institutional strengthening and capacity building.\nSpecific  urban  renewal  and  environmental  upgrading  components  were  identified,  and\nimplementation will result in improved water quality, better living conditions, and higher public\nhealth  standards  for  riverside  residents.  The  PRRC  and  the  Metro  Manila  Council  have\nreviewed, approved, and adopted the first phase of the PRDP.\n2. Provide Additional Sanitation Services\n61. The MWSS concession agreements with private sector operators set time-bound service\ncoverage targets for water supply, sewerage, and sanitation. Compared with water supply\ntargets, the planned coverage for sewerage and sanitation are much lower and are to be\nachieved much later. Most areas will not begin to receive sewerage coverage until after 2006.\nSome areas will not receive sanitation coverage throughout the concession period, even though\n90 percent of Metro Manila is served by septic tanks. OGCC has issued an opinion that the\nprovision of sanitation services is not an exclusive right of the concessionaires under the terms\nof the MWSS Concession Agreement. In view of this, the Government\u2019s policy for sanitation is\nto (i) ensure that the concession operators meet the time-bound service coverage targets set\nout in the concession agreements, and (ii) enable the PRRC to provide additional sanitation\ncoverage and deliver services at an earlier date than specified in the concession agreements for\nareas that have low or zero sanitation coverage. By 2005 the SDP investment Project will", "18\nprovide septic tank maintenance services for about 185,000 households in areas scheduled for\nzero sanitation coverage under the MWSS Concession Agreement.\n3. Establish a Wastewater Discharge Permit System for Metro Manila\n62. Without  adequate  monitoring  and  enforcement  of  environmental  regulations  and\nstandards,  industrial  activities  will  produce  industrial  wastewater  pollution  that  jeopardizes\neconomic growth, adversely affects human health, and degrades the environment. Within the\nPasig River system, industrial wastewater is estimated to account for 35 percent of the BOD\npollution load entering the river. Existing industries continue to pollute the Pasig River due to old\nand inefficient plant facilities and equipment; a lack of understanding of the need for wastewater\nmanagement and pollution reduction; noncompliance with effluent discharge standards; poor\ndetection; weak enforcement of environmental regulations and standards; and apathy among\naffected communities. Government attempts to solve the problem have been through traditional\ncommand and control approaches that rely on setting standards and controls, and monitoring\nand enforcing compliance. This approach includes a system of fines that assigns weights to a\nnumber of pollution factors, but the value of the fines have been eroded by inflation and do not\nadequately  reflect  the  environmental  damage  caused  by  polluters.  Noncompliance  with\nenvironmental discharge standards results in a maximum penalty of P5,000 per day (about\n$125) regardless of facility size, and the probability of being detected and fined is low. As a\nresult, many firms choose to risk being caught and fined rather than invest in wastewater\ntreatment facilities, as the penalties are much lower than the cost of installing pollution control\ndevices. The consequence of poor environmental monitoring and enforcement is the continued\nviolation  of  pollution  discharge  regulations  and  a  degraded  environment.  The  policy  is  to\nestablish, for Metro Manila, a wastewater discharge permit system with a progressive tariff\nstructure based on the volume of wastewater discharged and the concentration of pollution\nloading for enterprises discharging effluents to the public system. Initially, the permits will not be\ntradable because the discharge permit system is a relatively new concept for the Philippines,\nand the institutional capacity to effectively operate and manage a tradable wastewater permit\nsystem needs further development and strengthening. The wastewater discharge permit system\nwill be similar to that successfully introduced by LLDA in the area around Laguna Lake outside\nMetro Manila. The DENR will issue an administrative order authorizing a system of wastewater\ndischarge permits and fees for Metro Manila.\n4. Solid Waste Management\n63. Illegal  dumping  of  solid  waste  in  the  Pasig  River  system  can  be  attributed  to  the\ninadequate household waste collection system, widespread lack of discipline and awareness of\nproper waste management practices among riverside communities, poor access to the interior\nof communities for effective waste collection, and uncoordinated and irregular scheduling of\nsolid waste collection vehicles. The Government\u2019s policy is to improve domestic solid waste\ncollection and recycling by riverside barangays, and aim for a target of zero pollution caused by\nsolid waste in the river. To achieve this, MMDA and the LGUs will mobilize the barangays along\nthe river and use the services of relevant NGOs that have had experience with implementing\ncommunity-based solid waste management projects through the Sagip Pasig Movement.15\n                                                          \n15\nSagip Pasig means Save the Pasig.", "19\n5. Establish Environmental Preservation Areas\n64. Establishing 10 m wide EPAs along the riverbanks is a policy priority and is critical to\nimproving  access  to  the  river  for  public  use,  safety,  and  maintenance;  rehabilitating  the\nriverbank environment; and promoting urban renewal adjacent to the river. The creation of EPAs\nalong all major rivers and esteros in Metro Manila will require the relocation of about 60,000\nsquatter families currently living in deprived conditions along the riverbanks and over the water.\nThe relocation of squatter families living within the EPA zones is the first step to improving\npublic health standards and quality of life for urban poor families currently living in inadequate,\nunserviced squatter shanties in dangerous locations along the riverbanks. The Government has\nalready embarked on a program of relocation and early relocatees included families living in stilt\nhouses over the water. Under the first phase of the PRDP, approximately 10,000 squatter\nfamilies currently living within the designated EPAs along the main Pasig River will be relocated.\n6. Strengthen Environmental Standards and Regulations\n65. In  some  cases  the  environmental  regulations  and  standards  are  outdated  and\nincompatible  with  modern  development  and  pollution  control  practices.  It  is  necessary,\ntherefore,  to  review,  strengthen,  modernize,  and  unify  the  environmental  management\nregulations and pollution discharge standards for wastewater discharges for new and existing\ndevelopment  within  the  Pasig  River  system.  This  will  require  modern,  appropriate,\nimplementable,  and  enforceable  environmental  standards  and  regulations,  as  well  as\nappropriate market-based instruments for pollution control, to be developed for residential,\ncommercial, institutional, and industrial development. It is also necessary to streamline the\nreview and approval procedures for the issuance of environmental compliance certificates, and\nthe monitoring and enforcement procedures for wastewater discharge permits. Also, the private\nseptic tank cleaning companies will be subjected to stronger regulation to ensure that the\ncollected septage is properly treated and disposed of, which is presently not the case. The\nPRRC has formed an interagency working group consisting of DENR, Department of Health,\nHUDCC, Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board, LLDA, and MMDA among other sector\nrepresentatives  to  review,  modify,  and  unify  the  various  standards  and  regulations  being\nadopted by different agencies.\n7. Strengthen Water Quality Monitoring and Enforcement\n66. To  adequately  monitor,  manage,  and  control  the  volume  and  concentration  of\nwastewater effluents discharged to the Pasig River system, the existing water monitoring and\npollution control enforcement system must be reformed and expanded. A first step will be to\nincrease  the  number  of  monitoring  stations  and  frequency  of  water  quality  sampling,  and\nimprove the analysis of collected data. The Government has requested Danida to provide\nparallel cofinancing for capacity building assistance for the PMO and support for community\nawareness, livelihood activities, water quality monitoring, and industrial pollution data base. The\nNorwegian  Government  is  also  considering  financing  the  provision  of  equipment  for  water\nquality monitoring stations in Laguna Lake and the Pasig River. Other steps to strengthen water\nquality monitoring and enforcement include regular semiannual and frequent random monitoring\nof holders of wastewater discharge permits. Monitoring will be done to ensure that the volume\nand BOD concentration of the discharged effluents conform with the limits set in the discharge\npermit. Enterprises participating in the discharge permit scheme will also be required to prepare\nand  submit  quarterly  self-assessment  reports  on  wastewater  discharge  volumes  and\nconcentrations, and show that the operations are in compliance with the discharge permit and\nthe environmental regulations and standards.", "20\n8. Enhance Public Awareness of Environmental Issues\n67. An important requirement for rehabilitating the Pasig River is the support of the general\npublic and of various special interest groups, such as industry groups and NGOs. The majority\nof city residents are not fully aware of the detrimental impact that poor water quality and a\ndegraded urban environment can have on their health, and the high cost that is imposed on the\neconomy as a whole. To successfully implement many of the required policy reforms and\nmeasures, the full support of the public, Government agencies, media, the private sector, and\nNGOs must be mobilized. Public support and understanding is also needed of the benefits that\nwill  arise  from  the  adoption  and  enforcement  of  strict  environmental  regulations.  The\nGovernment has recognized the vital importance of establishing an effective public awareness\nprogram  to  introduce  the  necessary  wastewater  management  policies  and  urban  renewal\nactivities. Continuous monitoring of the impact of various awareness campaigns will be carried\nout to identify their effectiveness and provide important feedback for further programs. The\nAdvocacy Committee of the PRRC will act as the focal point for the design, coordination, and\nimplementation of public awareness-raising campaigns. PRRC staff will receive training in the\nmanagement  and  implementation  of  awareness-raising  campaigns,  and  the  design  and\nimplementation of impact assessment programs.\n9. Institutional Strengthening\n68. There  is  a  direct  relationship  between  inadequate  water  quality  monitoring  and\nmanagement, and the limited capacity of the responsible government, private sector, and civil\nsociety organizations. The Government is giving high priority to improving the environmental\nmanagement of the Pasig River basin; to achieve this it is necessary to have strong, capable\nenvironmental management agencies.\nD.  Capacity Building\n69. The  agencies  responsible  for  environmental  management  in  the  Pasig  River  basin\ninclude the PRRC, DENR, and LLDA; each has limited capacity to monitor conditions and\nenforce environmental regulations and standards. A capacity-building program is needed for\nhuman resource development and training, and to provide additional equipment. The PRRC will\nprepare and implement plans to strengthen the ability of institutions to identify, quantify, and\nmonitor pollution services; enforce regulations and standards; and impose and collect fees for\nwastewater discharge permits. The following capacity-building activities are proposed.\n1. Technical Assistance\n70. To enhance sustainability and support the implementation of the actions required under\nthe policy reform agenda, the Government has asked ADB to provide TA for capacity building to\nhelp (i) the PRRC, through the PMO, to effectively coordinate with the funding sources and\nconcerned agencies implementing the various development programs under the PRRP; (ii)\nMMDA to coordinate the plans and programs of the national agencies and LGUs within the\nPasig  River  basin;  and  (iii)  the  LGUs  within  the  Pasig  River  catchment  to  prepare\ncomprehensive development and zoning plans for the areas adjacent to the river and in the\ndevelopment of proposals for urban renewal.", "21\n2. Bilateral Assistance\n71. The Mission has undertaken discussions with potential cofinanciers and identified the\npossibility of parallel cofinancing on a grant basis being provided by Danida and the United\nStates Trade and Development Agency for capacity-building activities and technical studies.\na. Proposed Danida Assistance\n72. The Danida support will be targeted at developing the capacity of the PMO to collect,\nanalyze, and dispense the information and data needed to better enable the PRRC to discharge\nits responsibilities for overall river rehabilitation. Care will be taken to avoid overlap with ADB\u2019s\nproposed TA, which will focus specifically on developing the PMO\u2019s capability and capacity to\nimplement  the  Project.  In  addition  to  capacity  building,  Danida  will  provide  support  for  (i)\ncommunity awareness of environmental issues; (ii) development of community-based livelihood\nactivities; (iii) continued support for the development and refinement of the mathematical model\nfor Pasig River water quality monitoring; and (iv) development of industrial pollution data bank,\nto assist with industrial pollution control. The Danida assistance is estimated at DKr 16 million\n($2.2 million equivalent).16 Capacity-building services will be provided over a period of about 2\nyears.\nb. US-TDA Assistance\ni. Toxic and Hazardous Waste Management\n73. The  study  will  assess  the  need  for  a  regional  toxic  and  hazardous  waste  (THW)\nmanagement  facility  for  Metro  Manila.  This  will  include  an  evaluation  and  assessment  of\nownership  and  operational  conditions,  deficiencies,  and  issues  relating  to  institutional\ncapabilities, regulations, enforcement, and compliance. The study will provide an assessment of\nthe characteristics of THW generated in Metro Manila, and the level of public awareness of\nTHW issues. The assistance will also focus on the review and evaluation of modalities for\nprivate  sector  participation,  and  prepare  draft  documentation  and  action  plans  for  facility\ndevelopment, process, and siting for the first phase of the THW facility. The study will also cover\nthe revenue potential of THW. The cost of the study is estimated at $500,000.\nii. Industrial Location Strategy Study\n74. The study will prepare an industrial relocation strategy for industries situated along the\nPasig  River  to  fulfill  the  Government\u2019s  objective  of  reducing  river  pollution  from  industrial\nsources. This will include advice to the Government on the constraints to relocation, impact on\nemployment  in  Metro  Manila,  the  mechanisms  and  incentives  required  to  overcome  these\nconstraints, and the resultant propensity for industries to relocate. The assistance will (i) prepare\na baseline profile of industrial establishments located in the Pasig River basin; (ii) carry out a\nstudy of the oil industry with a view to relocating and redeveloping existing sites; (iii) determine\nthe  major  constraints  to  relocation  and  devise  a  method  for  assessing  the  willingness  of\nindustries to relocate; (v) identify appropriate policy tools and other mechanisms to help with\nindustrial relocation; (vi) identify the demand and potential for relocation into the proposed\nindustrial cluster areas, including the potential for the private sector to satisfy that demand; and\n(vii) formulate a comprehensive industrial relocation strategy for the Pasig River system. The\ncost of the study is estimated at $500,000.\n                                                          \n16\nDKr = Danish kroner.", "22\nE. The Investment Project\n1. Objectives and Scope\n75. The main objective of the investment Project is to provide resources to support the\nimplementation  of  public  sector  components  necessary  to  improve  the  environmental\nmanagement  of  the  Pasig  River  basin  within  Metro  Manila,  particularly  for  wastewater\nmanagement, and to promote urban renewal.\n76. For the first phase of urban renewal, EPAs will be established along the Pasig River\nbanks, and about 10,000 squatter families will be relocated to in-city, medium-rise apartment\nbuildings and near-to-town house and lot schemes. Also, about 500 ha of low-income slum\nhousing, adjacent to the EPAs, will be upgraded including regularization of tenure and provision\nof basic services. It is expected that about 80,000 families will benefit from upgrading. The\nremoval of squatters and urban upgrading is expected to remove a further 5 t/d of BOD loading\nfrom the river. A summary of the components follows and a detailed description is given in\nAppendix 6.\n77. To improve water quality, a sanitation service, comprising a septage treatment and\ndisposal facility, and a septic tank cleaning service consisting of a fleet of vacuum tanker\nvehicles will be provided. The fleet will operate a two-shift system and be able to empty an\naverage of four septic tanks per truck per day. The fleet will be operational for 260 days per\nyear, and clean about 37,000 septic tanks annually. With an average desludging frequency of\nfive years, this service would handle about 185,000 septic tanks and benefit about 1.0 million\npeople. The septage collection service will reduce the current pollution load to the Pasig River\nby 16 tons of BOD per day, and in conjunction with the other sewerage and sanitation service\nbeing provided by MWSS concessionaires, will enable Class C standard water quality to be\nachieved and sustained for the Pasig River.\n2. Components\na. Sanitation\n78. The proposed sanitation services cover the collection of septage from septic tanks, and\nthe treatment and disposal of the collected septage.\ni. Collection Service\n79. The septage collection service will add to the overall sanitation coverage in the Pasig\nRiver basin through the provision of 20 vacuum trucks with 10 m3 capacity and 16 vacuum\ntrucks with 6 m3 capacity to service Makati, Mandaluyong, Pateros, San Juan, and Taguig, local\ngovernment areas covered by the MWSS east concession that are targeted to receive zero\nsanitation coverage throughout the life of the concession agreement. By providing this service,\nthe majority of septic tanks in the affected communities will operate more efficiently, thus\nsignificantly reducing the discharge of sludge and fecal material with high BOD loading into the\nstorm drainage system, and ultimately the Pasig River.\nii. Septage Treatment Plant\n80. The overall sanitation coverage will also be improved through the provision of a septage\ntreatment plant with a capacity of 600 m3 per day. The plant will provide treatment for collected", "23\nseptage and will include (i) receiving facilities for septage haulers; (ii) preliminary treatment,\nincluding mechanical screens and holding tanks with thickener mechanisms allowing septage to\nthicken prior to dewatering; (iii) septage dewatering equipment; and (iv) chemical stabilization.\nThe  treated  liquid  effluent  will  meet  DENR  discharge  standards  and  will  be  suitable  for\ndischarge to public drainage systems. Pathogens will be removed from the residual sludge\ncake, which will be stable and suitable for use as soil conditioner. The design, construction,\noperation, and maintenance of the plant, and the procurement and operation of the vacuum\ntrucks will be contracted through competitive and transparent bidding conducted in accordance\nwith procedures acceptable to ADB. The sanitation services operating agreement will also be on\nterms and conditions acceptable to ADB.\nb. Environmental Preservation Areas\n81. Through the Project, the PRRC aims to establish parks, walkways, and greenbelts for\nabout 23 km of 10 m wide EPAs along the Pasig River banks. This will include the relocation of\napproximately  10,000  squatter  families  currently  living  in  depressed  conditions  along  the\nriverbanks within the designated EPAs, and the development of EPAs. About 9,260 squatter\nfamilies will be relocated to low-income sites-and-services housing projects near Metro Manila.\nEach relocated family will have one lot of 30 m2 and a core house with connections to water,\nsanitation, and electricity services. The principal relocation site is at Rodriguez, Rizal, about 30\nminutes from Cubao, Quezon City by public transport. To give relocatees an element of choice,\nalternative sites are being identified in Cavite province. About 240 families will be relocated to\nfive-storey, medium-rise, walk-up, apartment buildings within Metro Manila. The remaining 500\nfamilies will choose not to participate in the socialized housing scheme and will make their own\narrangement for housing. The housing and apartment building projects will include a full range\nof community amenities, including schools, health centers, multipurpose halls, day-care centers,\nlivelihood opportunities, and recreation facilities. The housing projects and apartment buildings\nwill be developed by NHA and HUDCC through joint ventures with the private sector.\nc. Urban Renewal Areas\n82. Urban renewal areas, adjacent to EPAs, will be upgraded through the provision of basic\ninfrastructure and essential municipal services, to improve living conditions and raise public\nhealth standards. The entire urban renewal program will cover about 500 ha of depressed,\npoorly  serviced,  low-income  housing  areas,  and  will  benefit  about  80,000  families.  The\nupgrading  and  urban  renewal  will  be  carried  out  by  participating  LGUs  and  MMDA,  in\nconsultation with DENR, and will cover (i) the registration of all unregistered land; (ii) provision\nof basic infrastructure such as water, sanitation, drainage, roads, and community services and\nfacilities, including flood prevention programs and solid waste management systems; and (iii)\ncommunity-based  livelihood  schemes.  Under  TA  2803  (footnote  4),  two  pilot  areas  were\nidentified, and feasibility studies prepared for them, as follows:\n(i)  Punta, Sta. Ana, Manila is home to 800 families on 5 ha of Government-owned\nland known as the DPWH Compound, adjacent to the Pasig River. It is proposed\nto undertake comprehensive urban upgrading to include land titling, provision of\nbasic infrastructure, community facilities, and riverbank improvements.\n(ii)  Barangay Santolan, Pasig City comprises 17 ha of land with about 2,600 families\nadjacent to the Marikina River. The land is partly in public and partly private\nownership. It is proposed to undertake land titling, infrastructure improvements,\nflood prevention, and livelihood schemes.", "24\nd. Project Implementation Assistance\n83. Project implementation assistance will be provided to the PMO to strengthen project\nmanagement  capabilities;  help  with  project  coordination  and  implementation,  particularly\ninteragency coordination and the interface between the environment and urban management;\nand provide assistance for finalizing the sanitation component and preparing the necessary\ncontract documentation. Specific assistance to the PMO will include (i) coordination, monitoring,\nand implementation of the Project; (ii) assistance to HUDCC, MMDA, NHA, and the LGUs in the\nimplementation and management of EPAs and urban renewal components; and (iii) provision of\nspecialist technical advice and assistance. Assistance will also be given to refine and further\ndevelop the feasibility study for the sanitation component, particularly site identification and\nselection  for  the  septage  treatment  plant;  wastewater  engineering  aspects;  preparation  of\ndocumentation  for  the  design,  procurement,  construction,  and  operation  contracts;  and\nprequalification of contractors, bid evaluation, and overall project management. The consulting\nservices for project implementation assistance will be provided over a period of three and a half\nyears and will require 54 person-months of international consulting and 102 person-months of\ndomestic consulting. The outline terms of reference for the project implementation assistance\nare given in Appendix 7.\n3. Cost Estimates\n84. The investment Project is estimated to cost $150.0 million equivalent, comprising $50.0\nmillion in foreign exchange (33 percent) and $100.0 million (67 percent) equivalent in local\ncurrency costs. The cost estimates are summarized in Table 1. Detailed cost estimates are\ngiven in Appendix 8. The base cost estimates are in July 1999 prices, and include provision for\ninterest and other charges during construction.\nTable 1.

The Government has asked ADB to provide a loan of $75 million for the investment\ncomponent; this represents 50 percent of the investment cost. The proceeds of the loan will be\nused to finance the entire foreign exchange component of the Project, including the interest\nduring construction and a portion of the local currency cost equivalent to $25.0 million. The\nprovision of local currency cost financing is considered warranted from the overall program\nviewpoint  to  ensure  that  sufficient  and  timely  funding  is  available  for  consulting  services,\ncapacity  building,  and  procurement,  thereby  minimizing  risks  of  implementation  delay  and", "25\nensuring  appropriate  capacity-building  activities  and  timely  project  completion.  Country\nconsiderations justify the provision of local currency cost financing. Concerted efforts have been\nmade  to  maintain  domestic  investment  at  levels  to  sustain  growth,  but  the  country  faces\npersistent pressure on the budget, arising from the currency crisis. For the balance of local\ncurrency costs, amounting to $75 million equivalent, the Government, through the PRRC, will\nprovide grants amounting to $69.5 million equivalent, and the LGUs will provide $5.5 million\nequivalent. The financing plan is summarized in Table 2, and details are presented in Appendix\n9.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total Percentage\nExchange Currency\nADB 50.0 25.0 75.0 50\nNational Government 0.0 69.5 69.5 46\nLocal Government 0.0 5.5 5.5 4\nTotal 50.0 100.0 150.0 100\nF. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environment\n86. Both the policy and investment loan elements of the SDP are expected to have a\nconsiderable beneficial impact on the environment and public health over the medium to long\nterm. The SDP was designed in consultation with central and local government agencies,\nNGOs, community groups, people\u2019s organizations, affected persons, and civil society in general,\nand is expected to benefit all residents of Metro Manila. These groups will participate in SDP\nimplementation.\n87. Through the sanitation component, the establishment and related development of EPAs\nalong the riverbanks, and improvements in the urban renewal areas, it is envisaged that the\nSDP will have a significant beneficial impact on the Pasig River and riverside communities in\nparticular, and the urban environment of Metro Manila in general. In view of the small size of the\nworks undertaken in EPAs and the urban renewal areas, potential negative impacts due to\nconstruction activities will be minimal and readily mitigated.\n88. Specific attention has been devoted to the relocation of affected persons living in EPAs.\nResettlement  is  a  highly  consultative,  iterative  process  to  be  implemented  in  a  flexible,\nresponsive manner, in accordance with the detailed resettlement plan prepared by the PRRC.\nAlthough  the  relocation  sites  will  experience  a  change  in  land  use,  none  includes  any\nenvironmentally  sensitive  areas,  and  the  developments  are  designed  to  minimize  adverse\nimpacts on the surrounding environment. Although site development is spread over a relatively\nwide area, the works are small in scale and adverse environmental impacts during construction\ncan be readily mitigated.\n89. The septage treatment plant is environmentally sensitive with respect to its location and\ndesign. Careful attention will be given to minimizing adverse environmental impacts arising from\nits operation, and the disposal of treated liquid effluents and stabilized biosolids. Furthermore,\nthe selected site will be subjected to a full environmental siting study in accordance with ADB\nprocedures and the preparation of an environmental impact statement in accordance with the", "26\nrequirements of DENR. Overall, the SDP is classified as Environmental Category B, and the\nsummary initial environmental examination is given in Appendix 10.\n2. Social Analysis\n90. SDP beneficiaries include both direct and indirect beneficiaries. Direct beneficiaries are\n(i) the 10,000 families relocated from squatter shanties to fully serviced permanent housing with\nsecurity of tenure, (ii) the approximately 80,000 families living in substandard conditions who will\nbenefit from urban renewal, and (iii) the approximately 185,000 households in the sanitation\nservice  area  that  will  benefit  from  septic  tank  cleaning.  The  indirect  beneficiaries  are  the\nresident population of Metro Manila who will benefit from overall environmental improvements, a\ncleaner Pasig River, and greater access to the river. Achievement of water quality Class C on\nthe Pasig River will improve health standards and reduce the incidence of waterborne and\nsanitation-related diseases. Living conditions and health standards for people relocated from\nEPAs  will  improve  considerably.  This  will  particularly  benefit  women  who  are  severely\ndisadvantaged  by  poor  living  conditions  and  health  standards.  Establishment  of  EPAs  will\nprovide parks and open space, improve access to the river, and reduce the illegal dumping of\nsolid waste and discharge of wastewater from riverside communities. Overall, the Pasig River\nand  its  surroundings  will  be  more  visually  attractive,  safe,  and  accessible  to  the  whole\npopulation  of  Metro  Manila.  The  improvements  will  enable  the  areas  to  be  used  for  both\nrecreational and commercial purposes, providing opportunities for income-generating activities.\nUpgrading in the urban renewal areas will benefit the poor communities outside EPAs. There\nwill be a greater sense of security in acquiring land and permanency of residence. This will\nreduce stress and enhance opportunities to invest in shelter improvement. Living conditions of\nthe families will be improved through access to better sanitation and facilities. Septage and\ndomestic wastewater treatment will improve sanitation and reduce the discharge of pollutants to\nthe Pasig River. There will be an overall health benefit for the beneficiaries within the serviced\narea due to reduced potential for waterborne diseases and nuisance of odors. The PRRC,\nthrough HUDCC and NHA, and with ADB assistance has prepared a detailed resettlement plan\nin close consultation with affected communities, NGOs, LGUs, and other stakeholders. The\nresettlement plan is in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines, and is available to the public. The\nsummary resettlement plan is attached as Appendix 11.\nV. THE PROPOSED LOANS\nA. The Policy Loan\n1. Amount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds\n91. It is proposed that ADB support the Government\u2019s policy reform agenda by providing a\nloan of $100 million from its ordinary capital resources. The loan will have a maturity of 15\nyears, including a grace period of 3 years, with interest determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s\npool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar loans and a commitment charge of 0.75\npercent per annum. The Borrower will be the Republic of the Philippines.\n2. Implementation Arrangements and Executing Agencies\n92. The Department of Finance and the PRRC will be the Executing Agencies for the policy\nloan. The PRRC will be responsible for ensuring that the tranche release conditions are met.", "27\n3. Procurement and Disbursement\n93. The policy loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of items\nproduced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding listed ineligible items (Appendix\n12), and imports financed under other official development assistance. The Borrower will certify\nthat (i) in case the proceeds of the loan will finance imports already made, the value of eligible\nimports in the period concerned exceeds the amount of the requested withdrawal, or (ii) in case\nthe proceeds of the loan will finance items to be imported, the value of eligible imports in the\nimmediately preceding one-year period is equal to or greater than the amount of the requested\nwithdrawal plus all other amounts expected to be withdrawn during the succeeding one-year\nperiod.\n4. Counterpart Funds\n94. The Government will ensure that the counterpart funds are used to support the reforms\nto be initiated or implemented under the SDP, and will, in particular, be used to support the\nimplementation of the SDP works. The Borrower will make available, as part of its budgetary\nallocation throughout Program implementation, a total matching commitment of at least $75\nmillion equivalent.\n5. Monitoring and Tranching\n95. The loan will be disbursed in two tranches. The first tranche of $40 million will be\nreleased  upon  loan  effectiveness.  For  the  SDP  to  be  effective,  it  is  essential  that  the\nGovernment initiate certain administrative and policy actions in advance of the first tranche\nrelease to demonstrate its commitment to the policy reform agenda. In recognition of this, the\nGovernment has completed the following: (i) the PRRC has reviewed and approved the first\nphase of the PRDP, submitted the plan to the Metro Manila Council, and issued a statement\nadopting the first phase of the PRDP; (ii) the Metro Manila Council has adopted the first phase\nof the PRDP; (iii) the PRRC has advised ADB that (a) the Government\u2019s policy for sanitation is\nfor the PRRC to provide additional sanitation coverage, (b) discussions on the tariff structure\nand charging mechanism have been initiated, (c) a legal opinion has been obtained from OGCC\nindicating  that  the  provision  of  sanitation  services  is  not  an  exclusive  right  of  the  MWSS\nconcessionaires,  and  (d)  satisfactory  arrangements  have  been  made  with  MWSS  and  the\nconcessionaires  regarding  the  sanitation  component;  (iv)  the  detailed  and  comprehensive\nresettlement plan has been prepared in consultation with the affected communities, and made\navailable to the public; and (v) an initial information, education, and advocacy plan has been\nprepared for the campaign to enhance public awareness of environmental issues.\n96. ADB will undertake an interim review of the SDP prior to the release of the second\ntranche. The second tranche, comprising the balance of the policy loan of $60 million, is\nexpected  to  be  released  within  12  months  of  the  effective  date,  provided  that  (i)  the\nimplementation of Phase 1 of the PRDP shall have been commenced by the preparation of\ntime-bound  development  plans  for  the  EPAs  and  two  pilot  urban  renewal  areas;  the\nimplementation  of  the  Resettlement  Action  Plan,  substantially  in  accordance  with  the\nimplementation schedule set forth therein; the submission to ADB of satisfactory drafts of the\nfollowing documents for additional sanitation and septage services: (a) a feasibility study, (b) an\nenvironmental siting study, (c) invitations and instructions to bid, and (d) contracts for the\ndesign, procurement, and operation of the sanitation facilities, the design and construction of the\nseptage treatment plant on a full turnkey basis, and its subsequent operation; (ii) the PRRC\ncharter shall have been amended to authorize the PRRC to contract for additional sanitation", "28\nand  septage  services  and  set  an  appropriate  tariff  structure  therefore;  (iii)  a  DENR\nadministrative order shall have been issued introducing a system for wastewater discharge\npermits and permit fees, which permit fees shall be utilized to strengthen pollution monitoring\nand  enforcement  of  environmental  standards  and  regulations  pertaining  to  the  wastewater\ndischarge; (iv) the MMDA shall have, jointly with each of any four LGUs (Makati, Mandaluyong,\nManila, Marikina, Pasay, Pasig, Quezon, Pateros, San Juan and Taguig), (a) developed and\nsubmitted for the approval of the PRRC a time-bound action plan for mobilizing communities\nalong the Pasig River to improve domestic solid waste collection and garbage recycling, (b)\nreviewed the land use plans and zoning classifications for riverside land, and (c) developed\nupdated plans and classifications that will allow for the development of the EPAs along the\nriverside and mitigate the continued pollution of the Pasig River; (v) the interagency working\ngroup  shall  have  reviewed  the  existing  environmental  standards  and  regulations  affecting\nwastewater discharge into the Pasig River and, if determined necessary, developed new and\nappropriate  environmental  regulations,  and  initiated  the  development  of  environmental\nstandards relating to wastewater discharge into the Pasig River by existing and new residential,\ncommercial, institutional and industrial developments; (vi) the PRRC, DENR, and LLDA shall\nhave developed, and the PRRC shall have approved, a time-bound action plan for the operation\nof monitoring stations to ensure frequent monitoring and regular sampling of the water quality of\nthe Pasig River; and (vii) the PRRC, DENR, and LLDA shall have developed, approved, and\ncommenced the implementation of a time-bound action plan to strengthen their capability and\ncapacity to identify, quantify, and monitor pollution sources, enforce environmental standards\nand regulations, and impose and collect fees for wastewater discharge permits.\nB. The Investment Loan\n1. Amount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds\n97. It is proposed that ADB provide an investment loan of $75 million from its ordinary\ncapital resources to finance the entire foreign exchange costs of the SDP and part of the local\ncurrency costs. The loan will carry an interest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s\npool-based variable lending rate for US dollar loans, and a commitment charge of 0.75 percent.\nThe  loan  will  have  a  maturity  of  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  which  is\nequivalent to the implementation period of the investment components to be financed. The\nBorrower will be the Republic of the Philippines. The Government will make the loan proceeds\navailable to the Executing Agency through budgetary allocations.\n2. Implementation Arrangements and Executing Agency\na. Project Management\n98. The PRRC will be the project Executing Agency, responsible for overall management,\ncoordination and monitoring of project implementation. The PRRC established the PMO to\nmonitor  the  day-to-day  progress  of  implementation  of  the  policy  reforms  and  coordinate\nimplementation of the various components of the investment Project. To perform these tasks,\nthe  PMO  will  initiate  project  management  mechanisms  and  procedures  for  the  regular\nmonitoring of implementation and problem-solving.\n99. For the policy reform measures, the PRRC will ensure that the first phase of the PRDP is\nadopted and will be in charge of the establishment, development, and protection of EPAs along\nthe  riverbanks.  The  PRRC,  in  coordination  with  DENR  and  LLDA,  will  be  responsible  for\nreviewing, rationalizing, and strengthening the environmental regulations and effluent discharge\nstandards from industrial, commercial, institutional, and residential establishments. DENR and", "29\nLLDA  will  introduce  the  polluter  pays  principle  to  Metro  Manila,  and  will  set  the  effluent\ndischarge  permit  fees,  assess  and  monitor  industrial  and  commercial  enterprises,  issue\ndischarge permits, and collect fees.\n100. HUDCC and NHA will be responsible for developing the housing and apartment building\nprojects, and the LGUs will be responsible for community consultation, providing assistance with\nsquatter relocation and community preparation, and development of the areas vacated by the\nsquatters.\n101. The LGUs and MMDA will be responsible for implementing upgrading in the urban\nrenewal areas with assistance as necessary from the PMO. LGU responsibility will include\ncommunity consultation to prioritize project areas and components, and reach an agreement\nwith communities on cost-sharing arrangements. The LGUs will also be responsible for project\npreparation activities for the provision of infrastructure and basic community services in the\nurban renewal areas.\nb. Implementation Schedule\n102. The Project will be implemented over a period of five years, from 2000 to 2005, in\naccordance  with  the  implementation  schedule  given  in  Appendix  13.  This  schedule  is\nconsidered  appropriate  and  achievable  because  the  PRRC  has  overall  responsibility,  and\nimplementation  of  specific  components  will  be  undertaken  by  experienced  implementing\nagencies.\n3. Procurement\n103. Procurement  of  goods  and  services  shall  be  subject  to  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement.  Contracts  for  the  sanitation  and  septage  facilities,  including\ncontracts for the lease and operation thereof, will be awarded on the basis of international\ncompetitive bidding. Bidders shall be prequalified before bidding but shall not be required to\nobtain a Philippine Contractor\u2019s Accreditation Board License as a condition for prequalification,\nbidding, or award of contract. Civil works contracts for EPAs and urban renewal areas, all of\nwhich are expected to cost less than the equivalent of $3 million, will be awarded on the basis of\nlocal  competitive  bidding  among  prequalified  contractors  in  accordance  with  the  standard\nprocurement procedures of the Borrower acceptable to ADB, provided that the apartment units\nin the medium-rise apartment buildings and the housing units will be procured in bulk from\nlicensed private developers. Indicative contract packages for procurement are given in Appendix\n14.\n4. Consulting Services\n104. Services of international and domestic consultants will be required to assist with project\nimplementation and to review, refine, and further develop the feasibility study for the sanitation\ncomponent. The consultants will be selected by the PRRC. All consultants to be financed from\nthe proceeds of the ADB loan will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic\nconsultants.\n5. Flow of Funds\n105. The Department of Finance, as the representative of the Borrower, will pass on the\nproceeds of the investment loan to the PRRC through budgetary allocations. The PRRC will", "30\nallocate, as budgetary allocations, appropriate amounts from the loan funds to the various\nImplementing Agencies, which are members of the PRRC, including MMDA for the urban\nrenewal  components,  DENR/LLDA  for  water  quality  monitoring,  and  HUDCC/NHA  for\nresettlement.\n6. Imprest Account\n106. To facilitate disbursement for small items of equipment, public awareness campaigns,\nand training activities, an imprest account, with a ceiling of $300,000, will be established after\nloan  effectiveness  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement Handbook.  The  imprest\naccount  will  be  operated  by  the  PRRC.  Disbursement  from  the  imprest  account  will  be\nsupported  by  appropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related  documentation.  Individual\npayments reimbursed or liquidated under the statement of expenditures procedures will not\nexceed $50,000 equivalent.\n7. Anticorruption\n107. During project processing ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to Government\nofficials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was recently added to\nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, particularly the need for bidders, suppliers, and contractors\nto observe the highest standards of ethics in the procurement and execution of ADB-financed\ncontracts, and the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. Similarly, the anticorruption\nprovisions added to ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants were also discussed. The\nability of PRRC and the Implementing Agencies to prevent potentially corrupt practices will be\nenhanced  through  the  introduction  of  appropriate  project  management  and  monitoring\nprocedures  developed  through  the  capacity  building  provided  by  project  implementation\nassistance and TA.\n8. Project Reviews\n108. ADB and the Government will undertake periodic reviews during project implementation.\nThe  reviews  will  include  evaluations  of  the  project  scope,  implementation  arrangements,\nresettlement, consultation with affected persons, achievement of scheduled targets, progress on\nthe agenda for policy reform, and capacity-building measures.\n9. Reports\n109. The PRRC will submit reports to ADB concerning the use of the loan proceeds and\ninformation concerning the administration and financial management of the Project. The reports\nwill include (i) quarterly progress reports on project implementation, (ii) annual reports, and (iii) a\nproject completion report to be submitted not later than six months after project completion.\nProgress reports will cover the areas of (i) policy reform, (ii) environmental management and\nwater quality monitoring, (iii) resettlement, (iv) achievement of sanitation improvements, and (v)\ncapacity building.\n10. Accounts and Audit\n110. It was explained to the PRRC that compliance with ADB\u2019s revised guidelines, introduced\nin 1998, for the submission of project reports, audited accounts, and financial statements is\nmandatory and will be strictly enforced by ADB. In particular, the following consequences for\nnoncompliance were highlighted: (i) suspension of disbursements, new contract awards, and", "31\nreplenishment of the imprest account if compliance is delayed by more than 6 months; and (ii)\nsuspension of the loan if compliance is delayed by more than 12 months.\n11. Project Performance Monitoring System\n111. The PRRC will integrate the project performance monitoring system (PPMS) into the\nproject management information system, and with the assistance of consultants, will develop\ncomprehensive PPMS procedures to systematically generate input and output data for each\nproject  component.  The  PPMS  will  also  generate  socioeconomic  data  and  environmental\nindicators to measure project impacts. The PRRC will refine the PPMS framework, confirm\nachievable  goals,  firm  up  monitoring  and  recording  arrangements,  and  establish  reporting\nsystems and procedures for initiating remedial action. The PPMS design will be flexible for\nproject design, schedules, activities, and development impacts, and enables the adoption of\nappropriate remedial actions. To ensure that project impacts are monitored and reported in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s requirements, the PRRC will monitor and assess activities, and include\nthe results in the quarterly reports to ADB on the physical implementation and financial aspects\nof the Project. The PRRC will be responsible for monitoring socioeconomic indicators. The\nservices of a specialist social sciences organization will be retained to survey and record the\neffects of the resettlement program, changes in land use and property values along the Pasig\nRiver, increased tourism, levels of private sector investment, and related improvements. Other\nindicators will also be monitored, including the incidence of waterborne and environment-related\ndiseases, and degree of beneficiary satisfaction with general living conditions and quality of life\nin the project area. The beneficiaries\u2019 awareness about project components and activities, and\nknowledge of good practice on environment-related behavior will be recorded. Internal and\nexternal  resettlement  indicators  are  built  into  the  resettlement  plan,  including  delivery  of\nresettlement entitlements, and restoration of incomes and quality of life for the people affected.\nThe PPMS will be designed with flexibility to address remedial actions that may be required to\nenhance the achievement of project objectives.\nVI.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objective and Scope\n112. The TA will provide capacity building for the PRRC, MMDA, and the LGUs. Capacity\nbuilding  for  the  PRRC  to  support  the  PMO  in  (i)  realizing  the  policy  reform  agenda;  (ii)\nstrengthening the forward planning capabilities of the PRRC; (iii) strengthening the project\nevaluation, appraisal, approval, and implementation capabilities; (iv) effectively coordinating with\nother funding sources, and national and local government agencies implementing the various\nparts of the PRDP; (v) identifying potential funding and cost recovery mechanisms for the\nimplementation of approved programs and projects under the PRDP; (vi) establishing and\nmaking operational a system to monitor and report the SDP activities; and (vii) developing\nprocedures for contract tendering, bid evaluation, and award.\n113. Capacity building for MMDA will provide assistance with (i) coordinating the plans and\nprograms  of  national  and  local  government  agencies  within  the  Pasig  River  basin;  (ii)\ndeveloping the systems and staff capabilities to enforce the establishment and retention of\nEPAs  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  ordinances  and  regulations;  (iii)  strengthening  the\nplanning and coordination capabilities of MMDA\u2019s planning staff; (iv) developing a system for\nconsolidating plans and programs prepared by national and local government organizations and\nthe private sector for the Pasig River basin; and (v) establishing a system for monitoring\ndevelopment activities within the Pasig River basin.", "32\n114. LGU capacity building will focus on helping the LGUs identify urban renewal areas with\npotential  for  economic  enterprises,  commercial  and  residential  activities,  and  community\nrevitalization  zones  for  urban  poor  communities.  Assistance  will  be  given  for  (i)  preparing\ncomprehensive  development  and  zoning  plans  for  the  areas  adjacent  to  the  river,  and\ndeveloping proposals for urban renewal; (ii) defining the areas to be affected by the PRDP; and\n(iii) preparing zoning and development plans for these areas.\n115. The TA will help to develop and establish mechanisms to motivate the community to\nbecome  involved  with  local  NGOs  and  LGUs  in  revitalizing  the  urban  renewal  areas\neconomically  and  physically,  by  encouraging  enterprises,  introducing  poverty  reduction\nmeasures, and initiating environmental upgrading.\nB. Cost Estimates, Financing, and Implementation\n116. The cost of the TA is estimated at $1.43 million equivalent, comprising $695,000 in\nforeign exchange costs and $735,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will provide $1.0\nmillion, to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $305,000 equivalent of the local currency\ncost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Asian Currency Crisis Support Facility,\nfunded by the Government of Japan. The balance of the local currency cost, equivalent to\n$430,000, will be met by the PRRC through payments in kind, through the provision of office\naccommodation,  counterpart  staff,  surveys,  and  logistical  support.  The  PRRC  will  be  the\nExecuting Agency for the TA, which will be conducted over 12 months and be completed by\nJune 2001. The outline terms of reference for the TA are given in Appendix 15.\nVII. BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA. Expected Impacts\n1. Economic Analysis\n117. The polluted condition of the Pasig River degrades the environment of Metro Manila. It is\nunsightly  and  malodorous,  poses  health  risks,  and  acts  as  a  constraint  to  socioeconomic\ndevelopment of the surrounding urban areas. Improving water quality and the environment\nalong the banks of the Pasig River are high Government priorities.\n118. The economic analysis was prepared for the SDP as a whole, because the primary\nbenefits derive from (i) water quality improvements in the Pasig River; and (ii) the improvements\nin environmental quality along the riverbanks and adjacent urban areas. These benefits are\ngenerated jointly by the SDP and by other projects and programs. The economic analysis\nassesses the incremental impact of the SDP on water quality and the urban environment, taking\ninto account attributable improvements.\n119. SDP beneficiaries are the residents of Metro Manila who will benefit from the cleaner\nand sweeter smelling river running thought the center of the city. Specifically, they will benefit\nfrom improved river water quality and environmental enhancement along the riverbanks, also\nthrough better access to the river, economic development, and recreational opportunities. In\naddition,  families  relocated  from  the  riverbanks  will  benefit  from  healthier  and  safer  living\nconditions, security of tenure, improved water supply, better sanitation facilities, and other basic\nservices,  less  contact  with  contaminated  water,  and  reduced  risk  from  flooding.  Similarly,\nalthough not relocated, families in the urban renewal areas will benefit from improved services\nsuch as water, sanitation, roads, lighting, security of tenure, and better access to the river.", "33\n120. The household survey undertaken through TA 2803 (footnote 4) showed that residents\ngive high priority to environmental improvements to enhance their quality of life. Demand for\nsanitation has been assessed for Metro Manila, based on improving the combined sanitation\nand sewerage coverage to 60 percent by 2003, 80 percent by 2011, and 85 percent by 2016.\nAffordability analysis is also based on the household survey. The cost of housing for the\nresettled communities can be afforded by the poorest 5 percent of families, assuming that 25\npercent of income is available for housing and special provisions have been made to provide\nrent assistance to the lowest income families. The risks to affordability are that the current\nincome level of families is not sustained after relocating, however, the risks are considered to be\nrelatively low because livelihood enhancement programs have been built into the resettlement\nplans.\n121. The  SDP  components  represent  the  most  cost-effective  options.  Alternatives  were\nconsidered for sanitation and urban renewal, and were found to be higher cost options, with\nimplementation difficulties. For the resettlement, housing will be procured from the private sector\nthrough a competitive bidding system, enabling the Government to take advantage of the\ncurrent weakness in the property market.\n122. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for the SDP and subjected to\nsensitivity analysis. Three benefit streams were valued, including (i) the willingness of Metro\nManila residents to pay for environmental improvements ensuing from the SDP, (ii) the benefits\nto communities resettled from the riverside, and (iii) the benefits of urban renewal to local\nresidents. However, some important benefits could not be valued, including the effect of the\nSDP as a catalyst for further environmental improvements and in removing constraints to future\neconomic growth.\n123. The  base  case  results  in  an  EIRR  of  16.0  percent,  which  exceeds  the  assumed\neconomic cost of capital of 10 percent. Under the worst case sensitivity test, where costs\nincrease by 10 percent and benefits decrease by 20 percent, the EIRR falls to 11.0 percent, but\nremains above the economic opportunity cost of capital. Due to considerable indirect benefits\nthat result from urban environmental improvements, project benefits are understated, and the\ntrue EIRR is likely to be higher. The detailed economic analysis is given in Appendix 16.\n2. Financial Analysis\n124. The financial evaluation carried out for the sanitation component evaluates financial\nperformance and pricing of services under three scenarios. For each scenario, the evaluation\nassumes that the required financial internal rate of return (FIRR) should be at least equal to the\nweighted average cost of capital for the scenario. In effect, the scenarios set the required FIRR,\nand the analysis calculates the required sanitation fee per household to deliver that rate of\nreturn. The first scenario assumes that Government will finance the septage collection and\ntreatment operations, and the revenues from sanitation fees will be sufficient to cover operation\nand maintenance costs and debt service payments. This sets the lowest effective FIRR at 2.68\npercent. The second scenario evaluates similar financial performance objectives but assumes\nthat the capital investment finance will be secured from an existing finance facility offered by a\nGovernment finance institution for environmental projects. Under this scenario, the terms of\nfinancing were assumed to be 11 percent interest with loan financing of 80 percent of the SDP\ncost. This produced an effective FIRR of 8.8 percent. The third scenario assumes that the\nfacilities are to be operated on full commercial terms and that investment decisions are made\nrelative to maximum potential yields on available market instruments in the country, such as\nhigh yield bonds, mutual funds, and time deposits, giving the highest effective FIRR of 18", "34\npercent.  The  evaluation  is  centered  on  determining  the  price  of  service  to  attain  the\nperformance  objectives  or  hurdle  rates  under  the  three  stated  scenarios.  In  this  way,  the\nGovernment  is  presented  with  policy  options  for  the  implementation  of  the  sanitation\ncomponent.  It  also  allows  the  evaluation  of  cost  recovery  options  against  affordability\nconsiderations under each scenario.\n125. Capital costs include all expenditures related to the construction of the component,\nincluding land, civil works, equipment and materials, consulting services, and physical and price\ncontingencies.  Capital  costs  were  recorded  for  the  year  they  are  to  be  incurred.  Interest\npayments and depreciation were excluded from the evaluation. Operation and maintenance\ncosts for the septage collection service were assumed to be 8 percent of capital cost for\nequipment. Operation and maintenance costs for the septage treatment plant were assumed to\nbe 5 percent of the capital cost of civil works, equipment, and materials.\n126. Under the performance objectives of the first scenario, the combined price of cleaning\none septic tank and treating the sludge would be P1,858 in 1999 prices. For full commercial\noperation, the price of collection and treatment services would be P4,861. Currently, private\ncompanies offer a septic tank emptying service charge about P2,600 per septic tank. However,\nthe collected septage is disposed of without treatment; this is environmentally unacceptable.\nTable 3 shows the pricing and affordability indicators for each septic tank served. The detailed\nfinancial analysis is given in Appendix 17.\nTable 3. Pricing for the Sanitation Service\n(P per septic tank served)\nService Price of Service\nScenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3\nSeptage Collection 503 581 771\nSeptage Treatment 1,355 2,116 4,090\nTotal 1,858 2,697 4,861\n3. Environmental Impact\n127. The initial environmental examination was carried out by consultants in 1998 under TA\n2803 (footnote 4), and will be submitted to DENR for an environmental compliance certificate,\nwhen  the  selection  of  individual  sites  for  project  components  has  been  finalized.  The\nestablishment of EPAs along the river frontage is necessary to ensure safety, provide access for\nemergency and maintenance purposes, and provide recreational amenities. The relocation of\nsquatters from the EPAs will bring about considerable environmental improvements for the river\nand riverbanks, and will result in substantially improved living conditions for the relocatees at\npurpose-built, fully serviced resettlement sites. The development of the urban renewal areas will\nintroduce basic infrastructure and essential municipal services into depressed areas, and result\nin improved living conditions, higher public health standards, and a better environment. The\nintroduction of sanitation services into areas with zero coverage will reduce the discharge of\nBOD to the river system and raise public health standards in the affected areas. The negative\nenvironmental impacts of the SDP are mostly temporary, related to the construction phase.\nThese negative impacts will be easily mitigated through appropriate engineering design and\nadequate construction management and supervision. In general, the environmental impacts of\nthe SDP are positive. The establishment of EPAs and development of urban renewal areas will\nprovide open space, parks, and green areas along the river frontage. The relocation of squatters", "35\nand improvement of infrastructure is expected to reduce the direct discharge of sewage and\nsolid waste to the Pasig River.\n4. Impact on Poverty\n128. The Philippines defines the poverty threshold as the minimum income needed by a\nfamily to obtain privately provided food and basic services. Based on this threshold, which\nvaries regionally, the national incidence of poverty declined from 44 percent in 1985 to about 32\npercent in 1997, but rose sharply to about 38 percent in 1998 as a result of the Asian financial\ncrisis. These figures fail to capture the scope and scale of Metro Manila\u2019s urban deprivation,\nwhere the incidence of urban poverty was estimated at about 18 percent in 1997, but about 35\npercent of the urban population are squatters and slum dwellers living in unserviced or poorly\nserviced communities. The rate of job creation has not matched population growth, contributing\nto downward pressure on real wages, unemployment, underemployment, and poverty. It is\nestimated that Metro Manila had an unemployment rate of 14.5 percent in 1997, higher than the\nnational rate, which was estimated at about 10 percent.\n129. For  the  project  area  the  poverty  impact,  social  assessment,  and  affordability  were\ndetermined through an affordability analysis based on the household survey, undertaken in\n1997, under TA 2803 (footnote 4). The survey included households located in poor riverside\ncommunities at Quiapo, and barangays 900 and 905. Since the riverbank communities that are\nresettled will pay for housing at the resettlement sites, the analysis focuses on the ability of\nfamilies to pay the rent or amortization set out in the resettlement program prepared by HUDCC,\nthrough  NHA,  for  the  PRRC.  In  1999,  the  monthly  household  income  among  riverside\ncommunities was P2,560 for the lowest 5th percentile, ranging to P22,950 per month for the\n95th percentile. The mean household monthly income was P8,350. The poverty threshold for\nMetro Manila is about P7,500 per month and about 35 percent of households affected by the\nproject are living below the poverty line, which is almost twice the rate of poverty for Metro\nManila as a whole. The lowest cost housing option is a lot with a core house at a choice of\nlocations. For the first five years, families can rent; then in the sixth year, families are offered an\noption to purchase at a set amortization rate. The monthly rents in year one are set at P400,\nrising each year at P200 per month. From year six onward, rents will increase at 10 percent per\nyear. The amortization rate is set at P1,385 for the first 10 years, rising to P2,243 for the\nremaining 15 years. For the poorest 20 percent of families, 25 percent of income is assumed to\nbe available for housing. This is equivalent to P640 per month, which exceeds the monthly\nrequirement for rent from the first year onward. For the remaining 80 percent of families, 20\npercent is assumed to be available for housing, and the rents are within the affordability range.\nThe affordability analysis shows that the rents will be affordable in the first five years, even to\nthe poorest 5 percent of families, as the amount available in 2003 exceeds the proposed rent of\nP1,200. In the sixth year, either rent or amortization will also be affordable to all income groups.\n130. Qualitative evidence also indicates that the rental and purchase options are affordable.\nThe experience of NHA shows that, when offered a choice, people usually select the more\ndesirable housing option, even if it is not the least expensive, though at first they may have\nindicated that it was not affordable. Also, in surveys, people tend to understate income and\noverstate  expenditures,  and  evidence  of  this  shows  in  the  widespread  ownership  of\nnonessential items like televisions and electrical appliances. Also, discussion groups held under\nTA 2803 (footnote 4) and recent market evidence suggest that rents paid in the squatter\nsettlements along the riverbanks are approximately P500 per month for a small room, which is\nhigher than the first year rental cost for a house at the resettlement site.", "36\n131. The risks to affordability are that the incomes and livelihood of residents are reduced as\na result of relocation, and that the livelihood program is not successful in raising the incomes of\nthe poorest families. Given that incomes are likely to be understated, and the rents are lower in\nthe early years to allow families to adjust to their new location, the risks are considered to be\nlow. The poverty impact assessment is given in Appendix 18.\nB.  Risks and Safeguards\n132. There is a risk that the SDP will not receive sufficient support from the Government and\nthat adequate counterpart funds will not be available. The high level of visible support from the\nGovernment, which has adopted the Pasig River rehabilitation as a key priority, suggests that\nsuch risk is small. The creation of the PRRC and adoption of the PRDP, ahead of program\nimplementation requirements, further suggests a high level of support and commitment to the\nSDP.\n133. A second risk concerns the possible lack of enforcement of environmental regulations\nand standards, and the shortage of qualified and experienced environmental management and\nmonitoring staff. Lack of enforcement in the past has resulted in many polluting industries and\nbusinesses  not  being  brought  into  compliance.  Major  efforts  are  needed  to  ensure  that\nadequate enforcement is properly undertaken, supervised, and reported, and that such activities\nare supervised and strengthened under the direction and guidance of the PRRC.\n134. A third area of risk is that the Government will meet opposition to implementing the\nproposed sanitation component from the MWSS concessionaires because they believe that the\nConcession Agreement gives them exclusive rights to provide sanitation services. The OGCC\nhas issued a legal opinion stating that the concessionaires do not have exclusive rights to\nsanitation services. However, the concessionaires could challenge this opinion. The PRRC has\ninitiated a process of detailed consultation with DPWH, MWSS, and the concessionaires to\nexplain the Government\u2019s policy to rehabilitate the Pasig River, and seek the concessionaire\u2019s\nsupport.  The  PRRC  has  indicated  that  the  concessionaires  have  expressed  willingness  to\nsupport the Government\u2019s policy, but so far, no formal agreement has been reached. Delays in\nthe implementation of the sanitation component would impact on the success of the program.\n135. Financial analysis of the proposed septage treatment plant indicates that the facility is\nfinancially viable and will generate a reasonable rate of return. Capacity-building assistance will\nbe provided to the DENR, PRRC, LLDA, and MMDA to support the enforcement of regulations,\nreview of investment plans for the disposal of septage and municipal wastewater for Metro\nManila, and undertake discussions with MWSS. Implementation of the PRDP is expected to\nmeet opposition from time to time, but given that the proposals have been discussed in detail\nwith all affected parties and stakeholders, it is considered realistic and achievable. In particular,\nall interested NGOs and civil society groups have fully supported PRDP implementation.\n136. The reluctance of squatters to relocate is the major risk attached to the urban renewal\ncomponent. To address this risk, particular attention has been given to the full participation of\naffected communities in the design and implementation of the resettlement plan. Relocation will\nbe kept to a minimum, and a choice of relocation options will be given to affected families at a\nvariety  of  in-city  apartment  buildings  and  close-to-town  house  and  lot  developments.\nResettlement will include the provision of social services, employment, and income-generating\nschemes.  The  resettlement  sites  will  be  developed  with  basic  infrastructure  facilities  and", "37\nmunicipal services. Given that resettlement has been discussed in detail with all affected parties\nand stakeholders, and will be undertaken under comprehensive community-based resettlement\naction plans developed in consultation with affected communities, it is considered to be realistic\nand achievable.\nVIII. ASSURANCES\nA. Specific Assurances\n137. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  The policies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of the Program Loan\nAgreement, as described in the development policy letter, will continue in effect\nfor the duration of the program loan period, and the Government will promptly\nadopt the other policies and take the other actions included in the Program, as\nspecified in the development policy letter and Program Loan Agreement, and\nensure that such policies and actions continue in effect for the duration of the\nprogram loan period.\n(ii)  The Government will ensure that sufficient budgetary allocations are made to the\nPRRC and the Implementing Agencies in a timely manner for the efficient and\ntimely  implementation  of  the  investment  Project.

In  particular,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  all\nnecessary measures to protect and improve the environment, health, and safety\nare undertaken; appropriate environmental protection controls and safety devices\nare included in the design and implementation of all civil works and development\nactivities; and facilities and civil works provided under the investment Project are\noperated and maintained in accordance with environmental guidelines of ADB\nand the Government.\n(vi)  The Government will acquire, in a timely manner and with due process of law, all\nland, properties, property rights, rights-of-way, easements, and leases as are\nrequired for implementation of the investment Project.", "38\n(vii)  The Government will ensure that the relocation of the squatter families from the\nPasig River banks is undertaken strictly in accordance with the Resettlement\nPlan  and  with  due  process  of  law.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  no\ninvoluntary  resettlement,  relocation,  or  movement  is  undertaken  under  the\ninvestment Project in relation to formal dwellers, commercial establishments, and\nsmall businesses along the Pasig River banks.\n(viii)  The Government will ensure that after the relocation of the squatter families, the\nEPAs,  thus  vacated,  are  promptly  developed  into  parks,  walkways,  and\ngreenbelts, and that the EPAs are not reoccupied.\n(ix)  The Government will, together with ADB, undertake periodic reviews during SDP\nimplementation to evaluate the scope, implementation arrangements, progress of\nresettlement and its impact on the affected persons, achievement of scheduled\ntargets,  progress  on  the  agenda  for  policy  reform,  and  capacity-building\nmeasures.\nB. Conditions for Disbursement\n138. No  disbursement  will  be  made  for  the  sanitation  and  septage  components  of  the\ninvestment Project until\n(i)  a feasibility study; an environmental siting study; invitations to bid; instructions to\nbidders;  and  a  draft  contract  or  contracts  for  the  design,  construction,\nprocurement,  construction,  lease,  and  operation  of  the  septic  tank  emptying\nservice and septage treatment plant, all in form and substance acceptable to\nADB, are completed; and\n(ii)  a contract or contracts for the design, construction, commissioning, lease, and\noperation  of  the  sanitation  and  septage  facilities,  all  in  form  and  substance\nacceptable to ADB, are duly executed, delivered, and become effective, and ADB\nreceives a legal opinion in form and substance acceptable to ADB, from counsel\nacceptable to ADB, on such matters as ADB may reasonably require.\nC.

The Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission (PRRC) was established on 6 January 1999\nthrough Executive Order No. 54, Series of 1999 (EO 54) to ensure that the waterway system,\nincluding the Pasig, Marikina, and San Juan rivers and the smaller streams and esteros, is\nrehabilitated to its historically pristine condition conducive to transport, recreation, and tourism.\nOn 19 January 1999, EO 65 was issued, amending EO 54 and designating additional members\nof the PRRC. To enable the PRRC to discharge its duties, EO 54 authorized P10 million to be\ngenerated  out  of  the  contingency  funds  for  its  initial  requirements.  Also,  the  Pasig  River\nDevelopment Council, the Presidential Task Force on Pasig River Rehabilitation, and the River\nRehabilitation  Secretariat  were  abolished  and  the  functions,  equipment,  and  logistics  were\ntransferred to the PRRC. Any funds received by the abolished agencies, contributed for the\nrehabilitation  of  the  Pasig  River,  were  transferred  to  the  PRRC.  Figure  A3  presents  the\norganizational structure of the PRRC.\n2. The  membership  of  the  PRRC,  based  on  EO  54  and  EO  65,  is  composed  of  (i)\nsecretary, Department of Budget and Management (DBM), as chairperson, (ii) chairperson,\nMetro Manila Development Authority (MMDA), as cochair, and (iii) secretaries and heads of the\nfollowing agencies: Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR); Department of\nthe Interior and Local Government (DILG); Department of National Defense (DND); Department\nof  Finance  (DOF);  Department  of  Tourism  (DOT);  Department  of  Transport  and\nCommunications (DOTC); Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH); Department of\nTrade and Industry (DTI); Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC);\nOffice of the Executive Secretary, Office of the President (OESOP); and three representatives\nfrom the private sector, appointed by the President.\n3. The  PRRC  has  the  following  powers  and  functions  to  achieve  its  mandate  of\nrehabilitating the Pasig River system: (i) prepare an updated and integrated master plan for the\nrehabilitation of the Pasig River system, taking into account its potential for transportation,\nrecreation, and tourism; (ii) ensure that the easements provided for in the Civil Code and other\nlaws are observed, including all the esteros and waterways that drain into the Pasig River; (iii)\nintegrate and coordinate all programs related to the rehabilitation of the Pasig River, such as,\nbut not limited to, the Pasig River Development Program (PD No. 274, Proclamation No. 704,\nSeries of 1995), and the Pasig River Environmental Management and Rehabilitation Sector\nDevelopment Program;1 (iv) abate the dumping of untreated industrial wastewater and sewage\ninto the river, including all acts and omissions in violation of the Pollution Control Law and other\nrelated laws; (v) relocate settlers, squatters, and other unauthorized or unlawful occupants\nalong  its  banks;  (vi)  undertake  civil  works  for  the  purpose  such  as  dredging,  clearing  of\nstructures, cleaning of the rivers and all the esteros and waterways that drains into it; (vii)\nsubmit regular reports to the Office of the President on the status of the Government\u2019s efforts on\nthe rehabilitation and development of the Pasig River; and (viii) coordinate with all Government\nagencies  and  offices,  including  local  government  units  (LGUs)  regarding  the  necessary\nmeasures to implement EO 54.\n4. The implementing rules and regulations for the PRRC include\n(i)  Proceedings. The PRRC will hold regular monthly meetings and such special\nmeetings as may be needed, upon the call of the chairperson or cochair.

Sanitation\n1. The major source of pollution in the Pasig River is municipal wastewater. The current\ncoverage of sewerage in the Pasig River basin is about 10 percent, and for sanitation (septic\ntank  emptying)  is  about  15  percent.  Privatization  of  Metropolitan  Manila  Waterworks  and\nSewerage  System  (MWSS)  operations  provides  new  opportunities,  but  the  commitment  to\nexpanding sanitation services is limited, and the benefits from the sewerage program will not be\nrealized until after 2006. The low assimilative capacity of the river and expected increase in\nwastewater generation indicate that even if the MWSS sewerage and sanitation targets are met,\nthe objective of achieving Class C water quality for the river will not be achieved. The sanitation\ncomponent will close this gap and increase the provision of sanitation services in the next five\nyears.  The  objectives  are  to  (i)  provide  a  septage  management  program  for  Makati,\nMandaluyong, Pateros, San Juan, and Taguig, local government units (LGUs) that are not\ncovered by the MWSS sanitation program; and (ii) provide a septage treatment facility.\n1. Septic Tank Emptying\n2. The MWSS sanitation targets for Makati, Mandaluyong, Pateros, San Juan, and Taguig\nare zero coverage throughout the concession period. The area contains about 230,000 septic\ntanks, the majority of which are not desludged regularly. Projections for the growth of septic\ntank numbers in the Pasig River basin are as shown in Table A6.1.\nTable A6.1: Septic Tank Projections in the Pasig River Basin\nLGUs 1993 1998 2000 2005 2010 2015\nNo. No. No. No. No. No.\nManila 79,234 82,792 78,926 79,333 79,740 80,147\nPasay 71,897 75,879 78,675 82,111 85,547 88,983\nQuezon City 327,988 332,823 337,068 359,617 382,165 404,714\nCaloocan 143,142 146,593 149,985 164,692 179,398 194,105\nMandaluyong 49,907 50,049 50,106 51,589 53,072 54,555\nMakati 89,158 91,672 92,678 96,280 99,882 103,484\nMarikina 66,783 68,139 70,476 78,444 86,411 94,379\nPasig 79,527 84,250 90,139 101,129 112,119 123,109\nPateros 10,139 10,948 11,272 12,420 13,567 14,715\nSan Juan 24,585 25,059 25,248 26,001 26,754 27,507\nTaguig 52,839 51,952 51,597 56,948 62,299 67,650\n     Total 995,199 1,020,156 1,036,170 1,108,564 1,180,954 1,253,348\n     Project LGU Total 226,628 229,680 230,901 243,238 255,574 267,911\nNote: Local government units (LGUs) shown in bold type are those with zero sanitation coverage under the MWSS\nconcession agreements and are the focus of the septage collection service.\n3. The sanitation component aims to provide 36 vacuum trucks for septic tank emptying.\nTo provide for flexible operations, 20 trucks will have a capacity of 10 cubic meters (m3) and 16\ntrucks will have a capacity of 6 m3. The fleet will work a two-shift system and service an average\nof four septic tanks per truck per day. The fleet will operate for 260 days per year, emptying\n37,000 septic tanks annually. The average desludging frequency for septic tanks is five years,\nand the service will cover 185,000 septic tanks in one complete five-year cycle. The service will\ndirectly benefit about 1.0 million people and will reduce the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)\npollution load to the Pasig River by about 16 tons per day (t/d).", "61 Appendix 6, page 2\n2. Septic Treatment and Disposal Facility\n4. The septage collected from the septic tanks is a partially stabilized organic sludge that\ncontains  pathogenic  organisms  and  requires  further  treatment  before  final  disposal  to  the\nenvironment. Metro Manila has little septage treatment capacity and most septage collected is\ndischarged, untreated, to rivers, esteros, open land, or the sea, causing environmental damage\nand nuisance. To treat and dispose the septage collected, a septage treatment plant (STP) will\nbe constructed, with a capacity of 600 m3/d.\n5. The sanitation component design characteristics are shown in Table A6.2.\nTable A6.2.

The STP will treat septage collected from the service area. As MWSS sewerage and\nsewage treatment facilities are introduced, the use of septic tanks will be phased out. However,\nbased on the MWSS installation targets for sewerage, it is expected that the STP will be needed\nat least until 2021.\n7. The STP will provide the following septage treatment processes:\n(i)  Stabilization.  stabilization  of  partially  stabilized  septage  through  biological\ndigestion (either aerobic or anaerobic) and chemical stabilization using lime;\n(ii)  Dewatering. to produce a solidified end product suitable for handling with earth-\nmoving equipment; and\n(iii)  Pathogen  Reduction.  septage  contains  pathogenic  organisms  that  must  be\ninactivated during the treatment process.\n8. To provide this level of treatment, the STP will comprise the following\n(i)  Receiving Facilities. Septage will be delivered in vacuum trucks, and receiving\nfacilities for the simultaneous unloading of 8 trucks will be provided. Septage", "62 Appendix 6, page 3\nunloading will be by gravity to sealed connection points to avoid odor release; the\nseptage will flow by gravity to the screening station.\n(ii)  Preliminary Treatment. Preliminary treatment will include mechanical screens\nto  remove  large  objects,  rags,  and  other  stringy  materials,  and  aerated  grit\nchambers to remove hard, abrasive materials. The pretreated septage will pass\nto a pump station wet well, and two heavy-duty diaphragm pumps will pump\nseptage to one of two septage holding tanks, each with capacity to store one\nday\u2019s  sludge  volume.  The  holding  tanks  will  be  equipped  with  thickener\nmechanisms to allow the septage to thicken prior to dewatering.\n(iii)  Septage Dewatering. Thickened sludge will be withdrawn from the septage\nholding tanks by two sludge pumps and pumped to one of two centrifuges. A\nconditioning polymer will be added to the septage prior to separation of the liquid\nand solid materials in the centrifuge. The solids concentration of the sludge cake\nshould achieve about 20 percent. The liquid centrate will discharge from the\ncentrifuges and flow to a wastewater treatment facility. The sludge cake will be\ncollected from the centrifuges by a system of screw conveyors.\n(iv)  Chemical  Stabilization.  The  dewatered  sludge  cake  will  be  mixed  with\nquicklime  to  raise  the  pH.  The  heat  generated  from  the  chemical  reaction,\ncoupled with the high pH, reduces the pathogens in the sludge.\n(v)  Liquid  Waste  Treatment.  The  liquid  centrate  will  be  high  in  BOD  and  an\nactivated sludge process will be used to achieve an effluent that conforms to the\nrequirements of DENR Administrative Order No. 35. The treated liquid effluent\nwill be discharged to the environment via the public drainage system.\n(vi)  Odor Control. All process equipment will be located in buildings and all storage\ntanks will be covered. A ventilation system will be provided to extract air from the\ncontrolled areas to keep them under negative pressure at all times. The collected\ngases will be discharged through a soil filter.\n9. The biosolids will be disposed of by land application, which benefits the land by recycling\nnutrients and reduces the need for chemical fertilizers. Potential sites could be agricultural lands\nsurrounding Manila and land areas damaged by the volcanic eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. The land\narea required for the STP is about 5 hectares (ha), including an adequate buffer zone, which will\nbe landscaped.\nB.  Environmental Preservation Areas\n10. For the Pasig River system, the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) provided\na directive (MMDA No. 3 series of 1996) to all LGUs with river frontage to adopt a uniform 10\nmeter (m) easement along the river system, including its tributaries, to ensure (i) on-shore\nsafety, (ii) access for emergency and maintenance purposes, and (iii) a pleasant riverside\nenvironment.\n11. Development  plans  for  the  Pasig  River  banks  are  contained  in  the  Physical\nDevelopment  Framework  Plan,  1996-2016,  prepared  by  MMDA.  This  plan  identified  the\neasements as environmental preservation areas (EPAs), and depressed areas adjacent to the\nEPAs as urban renewal areas. It is estimated that about 10,000 families live in the designated\nEPAs. These families are living in dangerous conditions and are constantly exposed to (i)\nfrequent inundation by flood waters, (ii) fire hazard, and (iii) major public health risks due to", "63 Appendix 6, page 4\nunsanitary living conditions and exposure to waterborne diseases. Under the Project, it is\nproposed to rehouse squatter families at purpose-built resettlement sites and develop urban\nrenewal areas to provide basic infrastructure and municipal services to improve living conditions\nand raise public health standards.\n1. Relocation\n12. Approximately  10,000  squatter  families  living  within  EPAs  will  be  relocated.  The\nrelocation comprises (i) the development of low-income housing projects near Metro Manila with\nfully serviced housing lots; a core house; water, sanitation, and electricity connections; and\naccess to a full range of community amenities including schools, health center, multipurpose hall,\nday-care center, livelihood opportunities, and recreation facilities; and (ii) apartments in medium-\nrise buildings on various sites within Metro Manila. Both housing options will be developed by the\nHousing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC), through the National Housing\nAuthority (NHA), in joint ventures with the private sector. Relocatees will choose their housing\noption based on individual preference, affordability, and willingness to pay. The units will be\noffered for rent for the first five years with an option to buy thereafter.\na. Apartments in Medium-Rise Buildings\n13. Apartments will be developed by the private sector in joint venture with NHA. The five-\nstorey walk-up units will provide 25 m2 fully serviced apartments. About 240 families are expected\nto  opt  for  this  alternative.  A  number  of  sites  have  been  identified,  including  C5-MRB\nCondominium in Taguig.\nb. Sites and Services with Core housing\n14. Fully serviced row houses will be provided at resettlement sites near Metro Manila, for\nabout 9,260 families. Several potential sites have been identified, including the principal site at\nRodriguez, Rizal, near Quezon City, to which most relocatees are likely to move. The dwelling\nunits consist of a core house with a 20 m2 floor area on a 30 m2 plot.\n2. Development of EPAs\n15. The EPAs will be developed as riverside parks. The areas for each LGU are indicated in\nTable A6.3.\nTable A6.3.

Urban Renewal Areas\n 16. Six  potential  urban  renewal  areas,  adjacent  to  the  EPAs,  have  been  identified  for\nupgrading with basic infrastructure and municipal services to improve living conditions and raise\npublic health standards. The areas are located at San Nicolas, Binondo, Quiapo, Intramuros,\nSta. Ana, and Santolan. Within these districts, a number of priority areas have been considered,\nincluding  Barangay  905,  Punta,  Sta.  Ana  (City  of  Manila);  Vulcan  Estate,  Punta,  Sta.

Introduction\n1. The initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared by consultants as part of the\nsector development program (SDP) feasibility study under the project preparation technical\nassistance.1 The IEE will be submitted to the Environment Management Bureau (EMB) for\nissuance of an environmental compliance certificate (ECC) when the identification and selection\nof sites for project components have been finalized. Although the site location for the septage\ntreatment plant (STP) has not been finalized, site selection guidelines are indicated in the IEE,\nincluding  the  necessary  measures  needed  to  minimize  potential  adverse  environmental\nimpacts. When the site location is finalized, and the STP feasibility study is refined, the Pasig\nRiver Rehabilitation Commission (PRRC), the Executing Agency, will prepare an environmental\nsiting study for review by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and EMB.\nB. Existing Environmental Considerations\n1. Physical Environment\na. Environmental Preservation Areas\n2. Regulations in the Civil Code provide for the establishment of easements along the river\nfrontage to ensure safety, and access for emergency and maintenance purposes. Almost the\nentire frontage of the Pasig River and its tributaries is occupied by slum and squatter colonies.\nThe squatter houses often protrude into and obstruct the river channels. The slum extends\ninward covering public and private properties. The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority\n(MMDA)  confirmed  through  MMDA  Resolution  No.  3  of  1996,  its  intention  to  enforce  the\nestablishment of a 10-meter wide environmental preservation area (EPA) along both banks of\nthe river, and to provide recreational amenities. The designated EPAs and adjacent areas are\nsubject to flooding, and because of inefficient solid waste collection in the upstream portions,\nconsiderable volumes of solid waste, silt, and other materials are carried into the houses. When\nthe floodwaters recede, the solid wastes are deposited and left to decompose on the walkways\nconnecting the houses and under the stilted housing structures.  In some sections of the Pasig\nRiver, especially in Manila and Makati, flooding is also caused by high tides. In areas where\nslums have not developed, adjacent private property owners have encroached into the EPAs. In\nmany cases, private property owners have fenced the illegally acquired EPA land to prevent\nsquatters from moving in. The soil is black, caused by decaying solid wastes and other organic\nmaterials. The air quality is poor due to the odor of decaying organic materials and smoke from\ndomestic cooking fires burning wood and other scavenged materials. The groundwater and\nsurface water quality are poor and highly polluted from the decaying solid wastes as well as\ninfiltration from the Pasig River.\nb. Urban Renewal Areas\n3. The urban renewal areas cover about 500 hectares (ha) of private and public land at\ndifferent locations along the Pasig River and its tributaries. These areas are extensions of the\n                  \n1\nTA 2803-PHI: Pasig River Environmental Management and Rehabilitation Project, for $800,000, approved on 29\nMay 1997. The TA was completed in April 1998.", "71 Appendix 10, page 2\nslum colonies located in EPAs along the river frontage and are not provided with basic urban\nservices. As a result, the environment is unsanitary due to inadequate excreta disposal, and the\nair quality is poor, caused by the odor generated by decaying solid wastes. While the inland\nareas are not as flood prone as the river frontage land, the drainage systems are informal and\ninadequate, and the water flowing in the open drainage system is highly polluted.\n4. The resettlement areas at Rodriguez and at other locations outside Metro Manila are\ngreen-field sites, occupying about 50 hectares of land zoned for residential use. The existing\nland use is mainly low-grade grazing and agricultural land.\nc. Sanitation\n5. The sanitation service area covers residential, commercial, and institutional areas in the\nPasig River watershed. The service area does not have a sewerage system. The drainage\nsystem serves as a combined sewer system draining the effluent from septic tanks. The water\nin the drainage system is septic. Foul odors are emitted from drainage service holes, especially\nduring the dry season when the dilution rate is low and the warm weather stimulates rapid\nbacterial activity. The groundwater in the service area has been polluted by salt water intrusion\ndue  to  the  overextraction  of  groundwater  for  domestic  and  industrial  uses.  The  sanitation\ncondition in Pasig River watershed is discussed in paras. 32-34 of the main text.\n2. Biological Environment\na.      Environmental Preservation Areas\n6. The terrestrial flora in the area are few and limited to ornamental plants and vegetables\ngrown  in  small  pots.  The  terrestrial  fauna  are  mostly  composed  of  insects,  rodents,  and\ndomestic animals. The aquatic life in the river is limited to surface breathing fish that survive in\nanaerobic conditions as well as insect larvae. During heavy rain, floating aquatic plants such as\nwater lilies and hyacinth are washed out into the area. There are no endangered species of flora\nor fauna in the area.\n  b. Urban Renewal Areas\n7. The ecology in the urban renewal areas is similar to that in the EPAs. There are no\nendangered species of flora or fauna.\nc. Sanitation\n8. In high- and middle-income residential areas, residents have gardens with lawns and\nornamental  plants.  In  low-income  areas  the  conditions  are  similar  to  the  proposed  urban\nrenewal  areas.  However,  in  commercial  and  institutional  areas,  almost  the  entire  area  is\ncovered with concrete and asphalt. The fauna are typical of urban centers, primarily domestic\nanimals and other life forms such as rats, cockroaches, flies, and mosquitoes that thrive on\nurban wastes.", "72 Appendix 10, page 3\n3. Sociocultural Environment\na. Environmental Preservation Areas\n9. Because the slums are largely illegal settlements, there are few provisions for basic\nurban  infrastructure.  There  is  inadequate  water  supply,  sanitation  services,  solid  waste\ncollection, drainage, and street lighting. Public primary schools have been built at the edges of\nslum areas. The local barangay hall serves as a multipurpose center, accommodating the local\nlaw enforcement authority (known as the barangay tanod), health clinic for visiting nurses and\ndoctors, and local social hall. Household incomes are largely below the average income level\nand a significant number are below the poverty level.\nb. Urban Renewal Areas\n10. The social conditions in the proposed urban renewal area are similar to conditions in the\nEPAs, however, the income levels are generally higher.\nc. Sanitation\n11. The socioeconomic conditions in the sanitation service area are described in para. 22 of\nthe main text.\nC. Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n1. Environmental Preservation Areas\n12. The  negative  environmental  impacts  of  the  development  of  EPAs  are  related  to\nconstruction  activities;  these  are  temporary  and  short-term.  The  negative  impacts  during\nconstruction are related to dust, noise, and traffic congestion. A detailed resettlement plan has\nbeen prepared to mitigate the social impact of the relocation of approximately 10,000 squatter\nfamilies, and is summarized in Appendix 11. In general the long-term environmental impact of\nEPAs  is  positive.  EPAs  will  provide  open  space,  parks,  and  green  areas  along  the  river\nfrontage. The relocation of the squatter families is expected to reduce the daily sewage and\nsolid waste discharges to the Pasig River by 1,800 m3 and 12 tons, respectively.\n2. Urban Renewal Areas\n13. The negative environmental impacts of the urban renewal component are mostly related\nto  construction  activities;  these  are  temporary  and  short-term  in  nature.  The  negative\nenvironmental  impacts  are  from  noise,  dust,  and  traffic  congestion.  The  long-term\nsocioeconomic impacts are positive with the development and provision of basic urban services\nand infrastructure to the area, issuance of land titles to families to secure their tenure to the\nland,  and  improvement  of  economic  activities  that  normally  go  with  improvement  in\ninfrastructure and services. The long-term impact on the environment will also be positive with\nthe reduction of the sewage and solid wastes discharge to the Pasig River and its tributaries\nestimated at 2 t/d of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD).", "73 Appendix 10, page 4\n3. Sanitation\n14. The negative impacts of the septic desludging operation are odor, nuisance, and noise.\nThese negative impacts are minimized by specially designed trucks with high-capacity, positive-\ndisplacement pumps and flexible pipe connections. The high-capacity positive-displacement\npump will minimize the time required to empty a septic tank, and reduce the volume of dilution\nwater needed to attain the desired slurry consistency. The special pipe coupling will reduce, if\nnot eliminate, the risk of spillage and the volume of water needed to flush the equipment and\npipes. The tanks are also especially designed for the job and will eliminate spillage during\nhauling. The septage treatment process design uses a physico-chemical treatment process to\nreduce the potential odor problem during treatment. The addition of lime will fix the malodorous\nhydrogen sulfide (this gives the rotten egg odor to decomposing organic matter). The physico-\nchemical treatment plant will be totally enclosed. Air vented from the plant will be scrubbed by\nan activated carbon filter. The supernatant will be treated in a conventional activated sludge\nwastewater treatment plant prior to discharge to the environment. The dried sludge will be used\nfor soil conditioning.\n15. For site selection, the STP should be located 100 m from the nearest residential area\nand will have a minimum area of 5 ha. The building and superstructure required to treat 600 m3\nper day of septage is estimated at 5,000 m2. A 20 m  buffer zone, planted with tropical trees, will\nbe  provided  around  the  STP.  Also,  the  parking  space  estimated  at  6,000  m2  will  provide\nadditional buffer zone. The entire STP site will be enclosed by a 2-m high fence.\nD. Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n16. During construction, the Executing Agency\u2019s (EA) project management office (PMO) will\nretain  four  safety  and  environmental  professionals.  One  of  the  safety  and  environmental\nprofessionals will serve as team leader and will report directly to the PMO\u2019s executive director.\nAt any time during the construction, one safety and environmental professional will be on the\njob. In addition, any contractor with a contract of more than P100 million will be required to hire\nand field one safety and environmental professional. The contractors\u2019 safety and environmental\nprofessional  will  maintain  a  construction  field  book  noting  all  safety  and  environmental\nconcerns, especially those that have been identified in the IEE report. The PMO\u2019s safety and\nenvironmental professional will note in the log book any deficiencies and measures required to\nimprove the implementation of the mitigation measures in addition to reports to the PMO\u2019s\nexecutive director.\n17. The PMO\u2019s safety and environmental officer will measure the noise level and dust level\nat the construction site at least once per working shift at random time intervals. The EA will\npurchase a noise meter and dust sampler prior to the execution of the contract.\n18. The sanitation component will include the provision of laboratory facilities at the STP\nsite. The laboratory will be capable of analyzing for BOD, chemical oxygen demand (COD),\nsuspended solids, total nitrogen, phosphates, sulfates, hydrogen sulfide, color, pH, temperature,\nand turbidity. The laboratory will be also equipped to measure Escherichia coli most probable\nnumber (MPN). Two licensed chemists will be hired to monitor the quality of the STP effluent\nand sludge. The effluent quality will be measured every four hours during start-up of the\nprocess, once a day during the first six months of operation, and once a week thereafter. Once\nevery six months the laboratory will send samples of the sludge to a reputable laboratory for", "74 Appendix 10, page 5\nanalysis of heavy metals and intractable chemicals that could affect the uses of the sludge. The\nheavy  metals  and  intractable  chemicals  analysis  will  preferably  include  measurements  for\nmercury,  cadmium,  lead,  chromium,  chlorinated  organic  compounds,  and  pesticides.  The\nsanitation services provider will collate and submit the monitoring results to ADB annually along\nwith the permits and notices from the relevant Government agency.\nE. Findings and Recommendations\n19. The negative environmental impacts of the SDP are temporary and reversible, mostly\nrelated to the construction activities. The long-term negative environmental impacts are related\nto the resettlement of the families living in the proposed EPAs and those families that could not\nbe accommodated in the urban renewal project. The other long-term impacts of the SDP on the\nenvironment  are  positive,  mostly  related  to  the  (i)  reduction  of  sewage  and  solid  wastes\ndischarges to the Pasig River from the residential, commercial, and institutional establishments\nin the watershed; (ii) improvement of the river flow regime with the removal of obstructions\ncaused by the squatter settlements; (iii) provision of parks, green areas, and other urban\namenities in approximately 23 km EPA; (iv) provision of basic urban infrastructure including\nthose related to health and environment to the blighted areas adjacent to the EPAs through the\nurban renewal subproject; and (v) reduction and elimination of high risk from floods and fire in\nheavily populated slums.\nF. Conclusion\n20. The SDP\u2019s negative environmental impacts are mostly short term and reversible, related\nto the construction activities in the development of the EPAs and basic infrastructure for urban\nrenewal. The long-term environmental impacts of the SDP are mostly positive in terms of\nreducing the organic load to the Pasig River and its tributaries, improving health of the residents\nnear  the  river,  and  provision  of  more  parks  and  green  areas.  As  the  SDP\u2019s  long-term\nenvironmental impacts are mostly positive, a detailed environmental impact assessment is not\nrequired.", "75 Appendix 11, page 1\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN\nA. Introduction\n1. The  summary  resettlement  plan  is  based  on  the  Resettlement  Action  Plan  (RAP)\nprepared for squatters living within the 10 meter wide environmental preservation areas (EPAs)\nalong the banks of the Pasig River. The RAP was prepared by the Housing and Resettlement\nCommittee  (HRC)  of  the  Pasig  River  Rehabilitation  Commission  (PRRC)  through  a  highly\nconsultative process with affected communities, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), local\ngovernment units (LGUs), and other stakeholders. Only informal settlers living within EPAs will\nbe affected by resettlement under the first phase of the Pasig River Development Plan (PRDP).\nB. Scope of Resettlement\n2. In 1997, the National Housing Authority (NHA) and the Department of Environment and\nNatural Resources (DENR), in coordination with local government units (LGUs), conducted a\ncensus of households and tagging of structures within the EPAs, and registered 8,286 informal\nhouseholds, however, the 1999 census validation check indicated 10,000 households within the\nEPAs, as indicated in Table A11.1. This increase may be attributed to some underrecording in\nthe 1997 census and new arrivals.\nTable A11.1. 1997 Census of Households within EPAs\nLocal Government Units Affected Households\n(LGUs) 1997 Survey May 1999 Validation Survey\nManila 2,272 3,580\nMandaluyong 486 516\nPasig 537 572\nMakati 1,166 1,236\nPateros 924 984\nSan Juan 576 611\nTaguig 467 497\nQuezon City 1,858 2,004\nTotal 8,286 10,000\nC. Socioeconomic Information\n3. In 1997, a socioeconomic survey was carried out through interviews and 6,154 (75\npercent) households responded, while 2,082 (25 percent) households were either not available\nduring the census or refused to be interviewed. The total population of the surveyed households\nis about 26,600 people, giving an average of 4.3 persons per household in the EPAs. The\nsurvey shows that 63 percent of households are the owners or co-owners of the housing\nstructure, 23 percent are renters, and 14 percent live rent-free. The survey shows that 8,766\npersons (33 percent) are employed, equivalent to 1.4 employed persons per household. The\nhousehold income data appears to be unreliable and has probably been understated in many\ncases. About 20 percent of households that participated in the survey declined to answer\nquestions about income, 5 percent indicated income below P2,000 per month; 30 percent were\nin the range P2,001-P4,000 per month and 21 percent of households had incomes ranging from\nP4,001 to P6,000; 9 percent have incomes in the range of P6,001 to P8,000; 5 percent range", "76 Appendix 11, page 2\nfrom P8,001 to P10,000; and 10 percent have income in excess of P10,000. The average\nhousehold expenditure is about P6,850 per month.\nD. Resettlement Policies and Objectives\n4. The objective of the RAP is to facilitate the orderly and peaceful relocation of about\n10,000 informal households currently occupying the 10-m wide EPAs along both banks of the\nPasig River. The objective is to ensure that the affected persons (APs) are relocated to secure\nand affordable socialized housing projects within or near Metro Manila. The purpose is to give\nthe APs a stake in the formal housing sector and thus remove them from squatting. The guiding\nprinciple is to ensure that APs will be at least as well-off after relocation as they are in their\npresent condition. To ensure this, a full range of mitigation measures are available to help APs\nto overcome the potentially adverse effects of moving from their current location.\nE. Community Consultation and Participation\n5. The Philippine Constitution requires community consultation and the participation of all\nFilipinos in development projects, and this approach has been institutionalized in the Local\nGovernment Code.\nF. Redress of Grievances\n6. The HRC has created an Awards and Arbitration Committee (AAC) in each sending LGU\nto determine qualified beneficiaries for resettlement, arbitrate in matters of claims and disputes,\nand safeguard the rights of the APs. The procedures for grievance redress were developed to\ndetermine the qualified beneficiaries living in the EPAs. Through the RAP, the procedures are\nexpanded to cover the actual implementation of the RAP and to ensure that post-relocation\nproblems are properly addressed and satisfactorily resolved. Also, during the actual relocation\nand after relocation, grievances and problems may be brought to the NHA, Site Management\nOffice for resolution and may ultimately be elevated to the HRC if satisfactory resolution is not\nachieved at the site level.\nG. The Resettlement Scheme\n7. The general approach to resettlement is to provide all affected families with the option of\nan  affordable  socialized  housing  package.  The  housing  package  options  comprise  (i)  an\napartment in a five-storey medium-rise building at a location within Metro Manila; (ii) a house\nand lot package at fully developed and serviced sites at a choice of locations near to Metro\nManila; or (iii) a serviced housing lot upon which the resettlers will construct their own house.\nThe specific resettlement sites are given in Table A11.2.\nTable A11.2.

Objectives and Scope\n1. The objective of the technical assistance (TA) is to build the capacity of the Pasig River\nRehabilitation Commission (PRRC), the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA), and the\nbeneficiary  local  government  units  (LGUs)  to  execute  and  implement  the  Pasig  River\nDevelopment Plan (PRDP) from 1999-2014. The TA will help the PRRC, MMDA, and LGUs to\n(i) implement the targets set out in the policy reform action plan; and (ii) develop and implement\nenvironmental management, rehabilitation, and urban renewal plans for the Pasig River, its\nbanks,  and  the  immediate  environs.  The  TA  will  ensure  that  the  PRDP  (i)  is  efficiently\ncoordinated, phased, and sequenced; (ii) is implemented effectively; and (iii) maximizes the\npotential  social,  environmental,  economic,  and  financial  development  benefits  of  the  river\ncleanup.\n2. Capacity building for the PRRC will focus on the project management office (PMO) and\nsupport  (i)  realization  of  the  policy  reform  agenda;  (ii)  strengthening  the  forward  planning\ncapabilities of the PRRC; (iii) strengthening the project evaluation, appraisal, approval, and\nimplementation capabilities; (iv) coordinating effectively with the financing agencies and national\nand local government agencies implementing the various development programs under the\nPRDP; (v) identifying potential funding and cost recovery mechanisms for utilization in the\nimplementation of approved programs and projects; (vi) establishing and operationalizing a\nsystem for monitoring and reporting on project and program activities; and (vi) developing\nprocedures for contract tendering, bid evaluation, and award.\n3. Capacity building for MMDA will focus on helping (i) coordinate the plans and programs\nof national and local government agencies within the Pasig River basin, (ii) develop the systems\nand staff capabilities to enforce the observance of the easement and retention of environmental\npreservation areas (EPAs) in accordance with the relevant MMDA ordinances and regulations,\n(iii) strengthen planning and coordination capabilities of MMDA planning staff, (iv) develop a\nsystem  to  consolidate  plans  and  programs  prepared  by  national  and  local  government\norganizations and the private sector for the Pasig River basin, and (v) establish a system for\nmonitoring development activities within the Pasig River basin.\n4. Capacity building for the LGUs within the Pasig River basin will focus on (i) preparing\ncomprehensive development and zoning plans for the areas adjacent to the river and in the\ndevelopment of proposals for urban renewal; (ii) defining the extent of areas likely to be affected\nby the Pasig River Rehabilitation Program; (iii) preparing zoning and development plans for\nthese areas; and (iv) helping LGUs identify areas with potential for urban renewal, either as\neconomic enterprise zones (high growth commercial or mixed commercial and residential areas)\nor community revitalization zones (urban poor communities).\n5. For these areas, assistance will be provided to establish mechanisms to motivate the\ncommunity to become involved with local nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and LGUs in\nrevitalizing these areas economically, (such as through encouraging enterprise and poverty\nreduction measures) and physically (e.g., through environmental upgrading).\nB. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n6. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,430,000 equivalent, including $695,000 in\nforeign  exchange  costs  and  $735,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  The  Asian", "85 Appendix 15, page 2\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will provide $1.0 million to finance the entire foreign exchange costs\nand $305,000 equivalent of the local currency costs on a grant basis from the Asian Currency\nCrisis Support Facility (ACCSF), funded by the Government of Japan. If this is not approved, the\nTA will be funded from the ADB-funded TA program. The Government will contribute $430,000\nin local currency costs. Table A15 shows the detailed cost estimates and financing plan for the\nTA.\nC. Implementation Arrangements\n7. The Executing Agency for the TA will be the PRRC, working in close collaboration with\nMMDA and the participating LGUs, which will also be the beneficiaries of the TA.\n8. To perform the services, 24 person-months of international consulting and 56 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting are needed. The international consultants will comprise an urban\nplanner, 11 person-months; a municipal engineer, 4 person-months; an industrial wastewater\nengineer,  2  person-months;  a  financial  analyst,  4  person-months;  an  urban  economist,  2\nperson-months; and a legal/privatization adviser, 1 person-months. The domestic consultants\nwill include a town planner (12 person-months), community development specialist (10 person-\nmonths), municipal engineer (10 person-months), economist (6 person-months), a legal adviser\n(2 person-months), a training specialist (10 person-months), and sanitary engineer (6 person-\nmonths).

The polluted condition of the Pasig River degrades the environment of Metro Manila. It is\nunsightly  and  malodorous,  poses  health  risks,  and  acts  as  a  constraint  to  socioeconomic\ndevelopment of the surrounding urban areas. Improving water quality and the environment\nalong the banks of the river is a Government priority.\nB. Approach and Project Rationale\n2. The economic analysis was made for the Project as a whole as the primary project\nbenefits are (i) improved water quality of the Pasig River, and (ii) improved environmental\nquality of the riverbanks and adjacent areas. These benefits are generated jointly by project\ncomponents and by other projects and policies outside the project scope.\nC.  Situation With and Without the Project\n3. River pollution comes from three main sources: solid waste, industrial wastewater, and\ndomestic wastewater, of which domestic wastewater is the largest pollution source. The Project\nwill reduce the pollution load in the Pasig River from each of the three sources, with the greatest\nimpact  on  reducing  domestic  wastewater.  However,  it  is  expected  that  other  projects  and\nprograms  will  reduce  the  level  of  pollution,  particularly  in  the  long  term  as  investment  in\nsewerage takes place. The economic analysis assesses the incremental impact of the Project\non  water  quality  and  the  urban  environment,  taking  into  account  the  environmental\nimprovements due to other interventions.\nD. Project Beneficiaries\n4. The  Project  has  three  physical  components:  (i)  sanitation,  including  collection  and\ntreatment of septic tanks sludge, known as septage; (ii) establishment of and improvements to\nenvironmental preservation areas (EPAs) along the riverbanks from which squatters will be\nrelocated and the vacated areas developed for public access, amenity, and recreation; and (iii)\nurban renewal in areas adjacent to the EPAs.\n5. Project  beneficiaries  are  the  residents  of  Metro  Manila  who  will  benefit  from  the\nimprovement of an unsightly and polluted river running thought the city center. Specifically\nresidents  will  benefit  from  a  higher  standard  of  river  water  quality  and  environmental\nimprovements along the riverbanks through improved access to the river and from its economic\ndevelopment  and  recreational  potential.  In  addition,  squatter  families  relocating  from  the\nriverbanks will benefit from improved living conditions; security of tenure; better health from\nimproved water, sanitation, and other basic services; reduced contact with contaminated water;\nand reduced risk from flooding. Similarly, although not relocated, families in the urban renewal\nareas will benefit from improved services such as water, sanitation, roads, lighting, security of\ntenure, and better access to the river.\nE. Project Demand and Affordability\n6. The household survey undertaken with Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance in\n1997  showed  that  residents  rank  improvements  to  the  environment  as  a  high  priority  to\nimproving the quality of life. Demand for sanitation has been assessed for Metro Manila, based", "87 Appendix 16, page 2\non the anticipated growth in the number of septic tanks resulting from population growth and the\nincreased number of dwellings, and the relatively low sanitation and sewerage coverage targets\nto  be  provided  by  the  Metropolitan  Manila  Waterworks  and  Sewerage  System  (MWSS)\nconcessionaires. These coverage targets are low, particularly up to 2011 before the initial\nsewerage investment will be operational.1 Demand has been based on improving the minimum\ncoverage to 60 percent in 2003, 80 percent in 2011, and 85 percent in 2016.\n7. The affordability analysis is based on the household survey. The declared incomes\nsuggest that all families can currently afford the lowest cost house and lot option. Over the next\nfive years, the cost of housing provided under the program will increase in real terms. Assuming\nthat real incomes increase in line with the historic Metro Manila average, and that the livelihood\ncomponent of the relocation program will make an impact,2 the cost of housing for the resettled\ncommunities is affordable to the poorest 5 percent of families. In support of affordability analysis\nbased on incomes, current rent levels in the squatter areas are considerably higher than at the\nresettlement site (around 3 times for a basic house). In surveys, households tend to understate\ntheir real income, while previous programs of the National Housing Authority (NHA) showed\nthat, when offered a choice, people tend to opt for the more desirable option even if at first they\nconsidered it to be too expensive. The risks to affordability are that the current income level is\nnot sustainable once the families are relocated. However, considering the low cost of rent in the\nearlier years, to give people time to adjust the livelihood program and the fallback mechanisms\nincorporated in the Resettlement Plan, the risks are considered to be low.\nF. Alternative Options and Least Cost Analysis\n8. Standard least cost analysis, in economic terms, has not been carried out, but for two\ncomponents, alternatives were considered. For the resettlement component, the innovative\napproach to providing low-cost housing through the private sector is considered as a proxy for\nthe least cost, in economic terms.\n9. For sanitation, two alternatives were considered, which achieve an equivalent reduction\nin biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) pollution load for the same stretch of river as the Project.\nThe first alternative is to provide conventional sewerage in an area, which will remove the\nequivalent amount of BOD from the Pasig River (16 tons per day), treat, and dispose of the\nwaste material. The financial cost of this alternative is estimated at P3,000 million ($80 million).\nHowever,  this  option  has  considerable  implementation  difficulties  as  under  the  MWSS\nConcession Agreement, the exclusive rights to provide sewerage services in Manila are held by\nthe concessionaires and implementation of this option would require the Concession Agreement\nto be renegotiated.\n10. The  second  alternative  is  to  construct  sewers  to  intercept  the  existing  combined\ndrainage system and convey wastewater to an outfall that would discharge beyond Manila Bay.\nThis option would also include stormwater overflows that would discharge into the Pasig River,\nbut under storm conditions, wastewater is diluted. However, to achieve the same degree of\npollution reduction, the interceptor sewers must be located upstream, increasing cost. While this\noption would remove more pollution load than the Project, sunk costs are high. To achieve the\nsame  pollution  load  reduction  as  the  Project,  investment  costs  would  not  decrease\nproportionately.  The  financial  cost  of  this  alternative  is  estimated  at  P5,700  million  ($150\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)\n1\nAssumed 75 percent of those served by sewerage are connected.\n2\nAssumed, 10 percent additional growth in real incomes for the poorest 20 percent, once the livelihood program has\nbeen fully established.", "88 Appendix 16, page 3\nmillion).  In  addition,  the  outputs  are  not  equivalent  to  the  Project  because  disposing  of\nwastewater to the sea has environmental impacts and other costs, which should be internalized\nfor true economic comparison. The project option is clearly the least-cost financial option, and\nthis  is  considered  a  reasonable  proxy  for  the  least-cost  economic  option,  given  the  large\ndifference in financial costs.\n11. Families to be relocated will be offered a range of locations, including apartments in\nmedium-rise buildings or a house and lot. Housing development will be undertaken by the\nprivate sector, following a competitive bidding process organized by NHA. NHA received 68\nproposals, and bids were evaluated according to set criteria including price, location, scope for\nexpansion, additional features, delivery date, and terms and conditions of payment. In addition,\nNHA has taken advantage of the fall in property prices to provide accommodation for relocating\nfamilies at least cost. This method of providing low-cost housing is considered to deliver a cost-\neffective solution.\n12. The Project will provide varying levels of infrastructure improvements to areas where the\nurban fabric has deteriorated, and the levels of infrastructure services are poor. The Project\nuses two pilot areas, Punta and Santolan, for urban renewal, land titling, flood prevention, and\nimprovements to services. The Project allows communities and local governments to decide on\nthe appropriate level of upgrading required. The alternative to urban renewal involves relocation\nof  families,  demolition,  and  redevelopment.  The  financial  cost  per  family  of  upgrading  is\napproximately one tenth of the cost of relocation, and is estimated at P22,000 per family\ncompared with P180,000 per family for resettlement. The financial least cost is considered to\ndeliver  the  same  choice  of  option  as  the  economic  least  cost,  given  the  socioeconomic\nimplications of resettlement and the scale of the difference in financial costs.\nG. Scope\n13. Having considered project demand and alternatives, the economic analysis estimates\nthe economic costs and economic benefits, and computes the economic internal rate of return\n(EIRR) and net present value (NPV) for the Project as a whole.\n14. The economic analysis uses the domestic price numeraire, given that the project outputs\nare nontradable in nature. The project life is assumed to be 25 years. The economic opportunity\ncost of capital (EOCC) is taken as 10 percent as there are many benefits that cannot be valued,\nand the computed economic internal rate of return (EIRR) will likely understate the true worth of\nthe Project.\n15. The analysis tests the sensitivity of the results by considering a 10 percent increase in\ncosts and a 20 percent decrease in benefits. The benefit decrease is considered appropriate as\nit reflects the risks associated with valuing the benefits of environmental projects of this type.\nThe effect of delaying the benefits by one year is also considered.\nH. Costs\n16. Financial costs are converted to economic costs. Taxes are excluded, at the rate of 5\npercent for land, 10 percent value-added tax (VAT) for relevant costs, and 15 percent import\nduty. Unskilled labor is assigned a conversion factor of 0.6, in line with other recent projects.\nLand is assigned a conversion factor of 0.2 for the resettlement component, valued at its\nopportunity  cost,  based  on  land  values  for  residential  and  agricultural  land.  For  other\ncomponents, where land is within Metro Manila, no conversion factor is used for land. The", "89 Appendix 16, page 4\nresults of the analysis are not sensitive to changes in these conversion factors. Tradable items\nare assigned a shadow exchange rate factor (SERF) of 1.21, the reciprocal of the standard\nconversion factor (SCF), which is 0.82. No conversion factors are used for other items. Table\nA16.1 shows the total economic costs for the Project.\nI. Benefits\n1. Valued Benefits\n17. Three benefit streams are valued. The first benefit stream is a proxy for the residents\u2019\nwillingness to pay for environmental improvements and improved water quality in the Pasig\nRiver. This is measured using the current environmental tariff of 10 percent surcharge on water\nbills for those not connected to the sewer system and the 50 percent surcharge for those who\nare connected.3 However, not all of the environmental and water quality improvements are\nattributable to the Project. The benefit stream allocated to the Project reflects the proportion of\nthe estimated total reduction in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), that occurs as a result of\nthe Project. This is proportionate to the estimated pollution load reduction that would happen, as\na result of other programs and projects. In 2003, 34 percent of the estimated total pollution load\nreduction occurs as a result of the Project. By 2021, only 7 percent of the pollution load\nreduction is attributable to the Project.\n18. Benefits to the relocated families include services, such as water, sanitation, lighting,\nroads, improved health and safety, and security of tenure. These improvements are captured in\nthe rental that families will pay at the new resettlement sites. Benefits are valued using the least-\ncost property option, rental in the first five years, and then amortization from year six onward, in\nconstant price terms.\n19. Urban renewal increases the economic value of the property in the area, which is\nreflected  in  a  person\u2019s  willingness  to  pay  an  increased  financial  price  for  the  property.\nComparison  of  similar  areas  with  different  levels  of  services  and  amenities  indicate  the\neconomic price of service level improvements. Reliable data on the value of properties is\nunavailable and would be difficult to assess as the market is severely distorted by the lack of\nland title and transaction difficulties. The benefits of upgrading are valued using willingness to\npay evidence from the household survey. Residents of urban renewal areas demonstrate a\nwillingness to pay P153 per household per month for improved water, sanitation, and roads.\nThis gives an annual willingness to pay of P1,850 per household. Under the same survey, the\nwillingness to pay for security of tenure was on average P560 per month or P6,700 per annum.\nThis gives total benefits of P471 million per year.\n2. Nonvalued Benefits\n20. The valued benefits attempt to capture the overall worth of the Project, and incorporate\nspecific  benefits  such  as  health,  flood  aversion,  safety,  and  amenity.  However,  due  to\nconsiderable indirect benefits that result from urban environmental improvements of this type,\nproject benefits are likely to be understated.\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)\n3\nThe concession agreements for water and sewerage provision include one-time increases in tariffs in 2003, to 75\npercent for those households not connected to the sewerage system and 150 percent for those households that\nare connected. These increases have not been included in the valuation, as there is no evidence that consumers\nare willing or able to pay for these increases. Water consumption is assumed to remain constant and the number of\nhouseholds is assumed to grow at the Manila average of 1.6 per annum. These assumptions are conservative and\nare likely to understate the true value of environmental benefits.", "90 Appendix 16, page 5\n21. The relocation of families along the river and establishment of the EPAs is a precondition\nfor the successful implementation of the Pasig River Development Plan, which will improve the\nenvironment  of  Metro  Manila.  Without  resettlement,  the  rehabilitation  of  the  river  and  in\nparticular, the environmental improvement of the river banks would not occur.\n22. Similarly, the rehabilitation of the river, and water quality improvement will remove a\nconstraint to economic development in the center of the city. While not driving growth directly,\nenvironmental improvement will act as a catalyst for further improvements along the river, and\nhelp the area along the Pasig reach its economic potential.\nJ. Results\n23. Table A16.2 shows the economic costs and benefits of the Project and the calculation of\nthe EIRR. Table A16.3 shows a summary of the results of the economic analysis. The base\ncase results in an EIRR of 16.0 percent, which exceeds the assumed economic cost of capital\nof  10  percent.  The  net  present  value  (NPV),  discounted  at  10  percent,  is  P1,775  million,\nequivalent to $46.5 million. The EIRR falls to 11.0 percent under the worst case scenario of the\nsensitivity analysis, where costs increase by 10 percent and benefits are reduced by 20 percent,\nwhich is considered unlikely. Under no scenario did the EIRR fall below the EOCC, however,\nthe EIRR falls below the EOCC if costs increase by more than 33 percent, or benefits decrease\nby more than 25 percent.\n24. Considering the importance of benefits that have not been valued, the reported EIRR is\nlower than the true EIRR for the Project, which is considered to be much higher.\nTable A16.3.

Introduction\n1. The poverty impact assessment covers the effects of the Project on the low-income\ngroups, squatters, and other vulnerable groups, and indicates the necessary actions to ensure\nthe  well-being  of  project  beneficiaries  and  stakeholders.  The  poverty  impact  assessment\nevaluates the project impact using data from previous studies, focus group discussions, and the\nfindings of the willingness-to-pay survey, representing about 20 percent of the affected people in\ntarget communities.\nB. Household Income and Expenditures\n2. The effective household income comprises the earnings of all workers in the household\nplus additional, regular sources of income such as from rents and remittances. About one\nquarter of households surveyed receive additional regular income. The effective household\nincomes vary from about P2,300 per month for the lowest 5 percentile to more than P21,000 per\nmonth. The mean household income is P8,200 per month and mean monthly expenditure for\nhouseholds is P6,851.\nC.  The Impact of Project Components on the Poor\n1. Septage Management\n3. The septage management component will involve operating and maintaining a septic\ntank cleaning program and providing a septage treatment facility. A survey was made to assess\nthe present conditions of families and their views on domestic wastewater management. Of the\ntotal households surveyed, 38 percent have access to a sanitary drainage system and 32\npercent dispose wastewater directly into the Pasig River. About 90 percent of the households\nhave individual toilet facilities, the rest use a neighbor\u2019s toilet or public toilet. Almost one third of\nthe households do not know how the septic tank is emptied. Only 44 percent of respondents\nrecognize the need to improve wastewater facilities; most people do not consider that improved\nsanitation facilities are important. The problem is particularly acute in Quiapo where 82 percent\nof the squatters in the area dispose of wastewater directly into the river. The squatter settlement\nin Punta is partly served by a sanitary drainage system, but in the area wastewater disposal to\nthe  river  and  canals  is  also  prevalent.  Of  those  respondents  who  recognize  the  need  for\nsanitation improvements, 92 percent indicated a willingness to pay up to P50 per month for\nservices.\n2. Urban Renewal Areas\n4. For people living in depressed areas outside the environmental preservation areas,\nregularization of land tenure and on-site upgrading is the preferred approach of the community,\nrather than relocation. Demonstration sites to illustrate the viability of slum upgrading have been\nidentified in Manila and Pasig. The upgrading will involve regularization of land tenure and\ndevelopment  of  (i)  roads  and  footpaths;  (ii)  drainage  system;  (iii)  water  supply;  (iv)  street\nlighting; and (v) basic social services such as health centers, barangay hall, and day-care\ncenter.  The  Project  offers  many  potential  benefits  such  as  security  of  land  tenure,  which\nencourages householders to invest their own resources in house improvement and expansion;\nhealth  benefit  as  a  result  of  improved  sanitation,  drainage,  and  water  supply;  improved\naccessibility and mobility to schools, markets, and work places; and social welfare benefits.", "95 Appendix 18, page 2\nOwnership of land is important to the affected families, and people have indicated a willingness\nto pay up to P5,000 per month, depending on household income. A significant number of the\nfamilies want to take part in a mortgage program.\n3. Environmental Preservation Areas\n5. This component will involve the relocation of about 10,000 squatter families from the 10-\nmeter environmental preservation areas (EPAs) along the banks of the Pasig River to various\nresettlement sites. Squatter families are often low-wage earners employed as construction\nworkers, artisans, or casual laborers. Large numbers of riverbank squatters are migrants from\nthe rural areas. They came to Manila to find employment and improve their quality of life. Upon\narrival in Metro Manila, squatting is the only affordable, low-cost housing solution available, and\nsquatting  offers  flexibility  and  ease  of  entry  to  the  housing  sector.  The  primary  locational\nmotivation is access to employment. Because incomes are low and work hours long, most\npeople do not want to spend time and money on travel to work. Therefore, the key criteria in\nchoosing relocation sites are access to existing sources of livelihood, availability of alternative\njobs, secure housing, and access to basic welfare services.\nD. Affordability of the Housing Options\n6. The lowest cost housing option offered to relocating families is a core house at a choice\nof locations. For the first five years, families may rent; in the sixth year, families will be offered\nan option to purchase at a set amortization rate. The rents in year one are set at P400 per\nmonth, rising each year at P200 per month until year six. After year six, rents increase at the\nrate of 10 percent each year. For house purchase, the amortization rate is set at P1,385 for the\nfirst 10 years rising to P2,243 for the remaining 15 years. Table A18.1 shows the monthly\nincome distribution identified from the household survey and the income available for housing.\nFor the poorest 20 percent of families, 25 percent of income is assumed to be available for\nhousing. For the remaining 80 percent of families, 20 percent is assumed to be available for\nhousing. The estimated amounts available for housing for each percentile are shown for the\nyears 1999 to 2003. The projections take into account inflation, real growth in incomes, and the\nimpact of the livelihood program on the poorest families.1 The analysis shows that the rents will\nbe affordable to the poorest 5 percent of families. Also, the amount available in 2003 exceeds\nthe proposed rent at P1,200. In the sixth year, either rent or amortization will also be affordable\nto all.2 In addition, the following qualitative evidence suggests that the options are affordable:\n(i)  Experience from NHA shows that when offered a choice, people opt for the more\nexpensive housing option over the less desirable option, even if at first they\nindicate that it is too expensive.\n(ii)  Ownership of nonessential items such as television sets is widespread, indicating\nthat considerable discretionary spending income is available.\n                  \n1\nInflation assumed at ADB rates. Real income growth assumed at 3.5 percent per year, in line with the average for\nManila. The livelihood program is assumed to increase the incomes of the poorest 20 percent of families by 10\npercent per annum, once the program is in place. The livelihood program is detailed in the Resettlement Plan.\n2\nInflation and real income growth are assumed to continue at 6 percent and 3.5 percent.", "96 Appendix 18, page 3\n(iii)  Discussion  groups  held  under  the  technical  assistance3  and  recent  market\nevidence suggest that rents paid in the squatter settlements are approximately\nP500 per month for a bed space, higher than the cost of a house in the first year\nat the resettlement site.\nTable A18.1.

The principal risk to affordability is that the income of residents is reduced as a result of\nrelocation, and that the livelihood program is not successful in raising the incomes of the\npoorest families. Given that incomes are likely to be understated and the rents are lower in the\nearly years to allow families to adjust to their new location, the risks are considered to be low.\n                  \n3 \nTA 2803-PHI: Pasig River Environmental Management and Rehabilitation Project, for $800,000, approved on 29\nMay 1997."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20010925164923Z", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Author": "j3m", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R90-00.doc", "ModDate": "D:20031120163953+08'00'"}}
