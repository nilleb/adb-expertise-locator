The  summary  was  uploaded  on  the  web  site  of  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) on 31 May 2005. \n \nThe  Project  will  (i)  construct  a  64-kilometer  (km)  expressway \nacross hilly and mountainous terrain; (ii) upgrade 129 km of local \nroads,  improving  access  to  52  poor  villages;  and  (iii)  provide \nconsulting  services  and  training  to  enhance  the  quality  of \nconstruction, the maintenance management system, the intelligent \ntransport  system,  the  safety  of  roads,  and  the  project  monitoring \nand evaluation system. \n \nThe Project is located in Xiangxi Autonomous Prefecture, one of \nthe  poorest  areas  in  the  country,  located  in  northwest  Hunan  in \nmostly  rural  and  mountainous  territory  with  limited  accessibility. \nThe  incidence  of  rural  poverty  is  30.1%.  Eighty  percent  of  the \npopulation lives in rural areas and ethnic minorities, mainly Tujia \nand  Miao,  account  for  some  77%  of  the  population.  The \ninadequate road infrastructure is a major cause of the area\u2019s high \nincidence of poverty: only two thirds of the villages are served by \nroads. Thus despite the region\u2019s economic potential, weaknesses \nin  the  road  infrastructure  stunt  economic  growth.  The  national \nhighway (NR319), which runs parallel to the project expressway, \nis a combination of class II, III, and IV roads, with steep slopes, \nsharp  turns,  and  low  allowable  speed.  Congestion  is  a  daily \nphenomenon  because  of  the  booming  mining  and  agricultural \nprocessing industries. The road network in western Hunan needs \nto  be  improved  to  facilitate  economic  growth  and  to  integrate \npoor, isolated area into the centers of economic growth. \n \nThe  Government  adopted  the  western  region  development \nstrategy  (WRDS),  a  key  theme  of  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan,  to \nenhance economic development in the poor, western part of the \nto  road  sector \ncountry.  The  WRDS  assigns  high  priority \ndevelopment as a way to promote economic growth and poverty \nreduction  in  the  western  region.  The  Project  will  support  the \nWRDS by building a 64 km expressway from Jishou to Chadong, \na link in the Changsha-Chongqing corridor, one of the eight high-\npriority  western  corridors  included  in  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan. \nThe trip from Jishou to Chadong by car on NR319 currently takes \n4 hours. The project expressway, which will be 30 km shorter, will \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\ncut  travel  time  to  less  than  1  hour.  By  lowering  transport  costs \nand improving the frequency and level of transport services, the \nProject  is  expected  to  spur  economic  activities,  thereby  helping \nreduce poverty in the area. The development of the road network \nin  Western  Hunan  will  help  transfer  the  benefits  of  the  eastern \nregion\u2019s economic growth to the poor western region. \n \nThe  Project  will  help  promote  sustainable  economic  growth  and \npoverty reduction in Hunan province and the project area. It will \nachieve this by (i) enhancing road transport efficiency and safety; \n(ii)  providing  a  link  in  the  Changsha-Chongqing  corridor,  one  of \neight  high-priority  western  corridors;  and  (iii)  improving  rural \nminority  villages\u2019  access  to  income-generating opportunities  and \nsocial services. \n \nThe  Project  involves  (i)  constructing  a  64  km,  access-controlled \ntoll  expressway  from  Jishou  to  Chadong,  including  a  large \nsuspension  bridge  (1.2  km),  13  tunnels  (10.5  km  in  total),  36 \nextra  large  or  large  bridges  (18  km  in  total),  interchanges,  toll \nstations, and service areas; (ii) upgrading 129 km of local roads \nto  improve  access  to  52  poor  villages  in  the  rural  minority  area; \n(iii)  promoting  private  sector  participation  through  an  operation \nand  maintenance  concession;  and  (iv)  strengthening  the  Hunan \nprovincial  government\u2019s  capacity  of  construction,  road  safety, \nproject  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  asset  management  and \nmaintenance by means of consulting services and training.  \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  $519.51  million  equivalent,  with  a \nforeign  exchange  cost  of  $263.98  million  (50.8%)  and  a  local \ncurrency  cost  of  $255.53  million  equivalent  (49.2%).  The  cost  of \nthe local road component is $20.7 million. Of the $208 million ADB \nloan, $8.0 million will finance the local road component. \n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank Loan \nMinistry of Communications  \nHunan Provincial Government  \nState Development Bank  \n\nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange \n208.00 \n0 \n55.98 \n0 \n263.98 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n0 \n59.74 \n38.60 \n157.19 \n255.53 \n\n($ million)\nTotal \nCost \n208.00 \n59.74 \n94.58 \n157.19 \n519.51 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nA  loan  of  $208  million  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  of  the \nADB  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nfacility,  a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \n \n\nlending \n\n\f \n\nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nv\n\nThe ADB loan proceeds will be made available by the Borrower \nto  Hunan  province,  which  will  onlend  $200  million  to  the  project \ncompany  with  the  same  financial  terms  and  conditions  as  those \nof  the  ADB  loan.  The  project  company  will  bear  the  interest  rate \nvariation and foreign exchange risks. Hunan province will keep the \nbalance  of  $8.0  million  to  be  used  for  the  local  road  component \nand will bear the interest rate variation and foreign exchange risks \nfor this amount. \n \nUntil 30 June 2012 \n \n31 December 2011 \n\n \nThe project company will be the implementing agency responsible \nfor  the  project  expressway.  The  local  road  component  will  be \nthe  Hunan  Provincial  Communications \nimplemented  by \nDepartment. \n \nHunan Provincial Communications Department (HCD)  \n \nGoods and services financed by the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works for \nthe expressway will be procured through international competitive \nbidding.  Procurement  for  the  local  roads  financed  by  the  $8.0 \nmillion ADB loan will use local competitive bidding. Equipment will \nbe  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  ADB \napproved  advance  action  for  the  procurement  of  civil  works  in \nJune 2005. \n \nThe  ADB  loan  will  finance  47  person-months  of  international \nconsulting  services  for  (i)  assisting  with  project  management \nduring  the  construction  period;  (ii)  providing  expertise  in  bridge \nconstruction, \ntraffic \nconstruction, \nmanagement, and asset management; and (iii) helping formulate \na  human  resource  development  and  training  program.  The \ninternational  consultants  will  be  recruited  through  a  firm  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consulting \nServices  by  Asian  Development  Bank  and  Its  Borrowers.  HCD \nwill  engage  and  finance  3,700  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting  services.  Of  the  3,700  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting  services,  300  person-months  will  be  allocated  to  the \nlocal road component to ensure proper design, supervision, and \nproject management, as well as to train engineering staff. About \n24  person-months  will  be  allocated  to  monitoring  the  Project\u2019s \nsocioeconomic  and  poverty  impacts.  The  domestic  consultants \nwill be recruited in accordance with government procedures. \n \nThe  expressway  will  take  3  hours  off  the  travel  time  between \nJishou  and  Chadong.  A  better  road  network  will  promote \neconomic growth in the area and integrate poor, isolated regions \nwith  the  centers  of  economic  growth.  Once  linked  to  the  major \n\nsafety, \n\ntunnel \n\nroad \n\n\f \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nvi \n\n \n\n \n\nroad network, the improved local roads will facilitate the spread of \nthe  expressway\u2019s  benefits  to  the  rural  economy.  Improved \ntransportation  will  increase  income  opportunities  from  cash  crop \nfarming  or  seasonal  work  involving  migration,  increase  contact \nwith urban centers, and make trips to markets and social services \neasier. \n \nThe  project  expressway  will  directly  benefit  road  users,  such  as \ntransport  providers,  bus  and \ntruck  operators,  passengers, \ntraders,  government  officials,  and  the  private  sector  in  general. \nRural households in the project area are also a beneficiary group. \nFarmers will be in a position to increase their agricultural incomes \nthrough better access to markets. The Project will boost tourism \nin  the  project  area,  benefiting  the  poor  in  the  city  of  Jishou  and \nthe  counties  of  Huayuan,  Guzhang,  and  Fenghuang.  The \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  Project  is  estimated  at \n19.1% and the financial internal rate of return for the expressway \ncomponent  is  estimated  at  5.5%,  higher  than  the  2.8%  real \nweighted average cost of capital. \n \nThe  Project  is  not  expected  to  be  subject  to  any  significant \ntechnical  risks.  The  Project  has  been  formulated  to  reduce \npotential  technical,  economic,  financial,  and  social  risks.  The \nmain  technical  risks  are  associated  with  the  construction  of  a \nlarge suspension bridge and the 13 tunnels. To mitigate the risks, \ninternational consultants have reviewed the proposed design and \nconstruction  methods.  The  prequalification  of  contractors  will \nfocus  on  their  financial  and  technical  capabilities  in  handling \nsimilar  works.  During  the  construction  period,  monitoring  and \ncontract  management  information  systems  will  be  set  up  and \nimplemented  with  the  assistance  of  the  consultants  for  timely \nidentification  of \nimplementation  of \ncorrective  measures.  HCD  has  proven  experience  and  has \nperformed  satisfactorily  in  implementing  internationally  financed \nprojects.  The  financial  risk  associated  with  the  construction  and \noperation of the expressway will depend on the level of traffic, the \ncosts of construction, the ability of the commercial management, \nand  the  toll  level.  To  mitigate  the  financial  risks,  the  project \ncompany  will  build  up  a  commercial  business  environment  for \nexpressway  operations,  and  the  project  expressway  will  receive \nsubstantial  injections  of  equity  from  the  central  and  provincial \ngovernments.

\n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Hunan  Roads  Development  III  Project.  The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe PRC has achieved rapid economic growth and poverty reduction in recent decades. \nGross domestic product has grown more than 9% per year since the 1980s, and the incidence \nof  rural  poverty  fell  from  33%  in  1978  to  just  2.8%  in  2004.  The  PRC\u2019s  sustained  economic \ngrowth has resulted in an unprecedented expansion in traffic between and within provinces. In \naddition,  the  economy\u2019s  changing  structure  and  increasing  diversification  have  altered  the \npattern of transport demand. The demand for road transport has outpaced that for other modes \nof transport. The movement of goods and passengers by road, which as a means of transport is \nmore flexible and responsive to the needs of a market economy than other modes of transport, \nis  increasing  rapidly. 1  The  shift  in  demand  also  reflects  the  loosening  of  anticompetitive \nrestrictions  in  the  road  transport  industry.  Large  investments  in  automotive  manufacturing  and \nthe country\u2019s rapid economic growth spurred the expansion of vehicle fleets at a pace that will \nlikely be maintained in coming years. \n \n3. \nPropelling  the  country\u2019s  robust  growth  and  drastic  poverty  reduction  were  massive \ninvestments  in  roads.  The  Government  has  made  major  efforts  to  increase  the  country\u2019s  road \ncapacity to meet the growing demand for improved access to markets and services. At the heart \nof  the  development  of  the  road  network  is  the  National  Trunk  Highway  System  (NTHS),  a \n35,000-kilometer  (km)  system  of  interprovincial  expressways  and  high-class  highways  (target \ncompletion:  2007).  The  NTHS  will  be  complemented  by  the  development  of  a  network  of \nnational, provincial, county, and township roads. During the 10th Five-Year Plan (FYP) (2001\u2013\n2005), the Government (i) accelerated the construction of a network of expressways and high-\nclass highways, giving priority to five north-south and seven west-east sections of the NTHS; (ii) \nstarted  the  construction  of  highways  in  the  western  region  totaling  18,000  km,  including  the \neight high-priority western corridors2; (iii) targeted opening about 1.95 million km of highways to \ntraffic, with expressways accounting for 35,000 km; and (iv) began to implement the 85,000 km \nnational expressway network plan, slated for completion in 2040, with an annual investment of \nCNY100 billion to CNY150 billion. \n \n4. \nAs  a  result,  the  country\u2019s  highway  network  grew  from  1.16  million  km  in  1995  to  1.86 \nmillion  km  in  2004,  for  an  average  annual  increase  of  6%.  Of  this,  1.52  million  km  were \nclassified. The total length of expressways increased from 147 km in 1988 to 34,287 km in 2004, \na more than 100-fold expansion. Class I highways increased from 196 km in 1980 to 33,522 km \nin 2004, or 29% per year on average. Class II and above highways accounted for 299,524 km, \nor  19.7%  of  the  total  length.  County,  township,  and  village  roads,  which  the  Ministry  of \n\n                                                 \n1  Between  1990  and  2004,  road  traffic  grew  by  about  9.0%  per  year  for  passenger  traffic,  reaching  876.5  billion \npassenger-kilometers, and by 6.0% per  year for freight, reaching 759.7 billion ton-km. In Hunan, road passenger \ntraffic  grew  by  6.4%  per  year  and  freight  grew  by  9.7%  per  year  during  the  same  period.  In  2004,  road  traffic \naccounted for 53.7% of the PRC\u2019s total passenger traffic and 11.4% of its total freight traffic. \n\n2  These  include  Altai-Hongqilafu,  Xi\u2019ning-Korla,  Yinchuan-Wuhan,  Arongqi-Behai,  Lanzhou-Mohan,  Xi\u2019an-Hefei, \n\nChangsha-Chongqing, and Chengdu-Zhangmu. \n\n\f 2 \n\nCommunications  classifies  as  rural  roads,  totaled  2.9  million  km  in  2004.3 Details  of  a  road \nsector analysis are in Appendix 2. \n \n5. \nEven  though  rural  roads  play  a  huge  role  in  poverty  reduction,  the  rural  road  network, \nwhich accounts for 85% of the country\u2019s total road network of 3.3 million km, is underdeveloped \nin terms of both extent and quality. Thus the 30 million rural poor face significant challenges in \nrelation  to  transport.  Many  of  them  live  in  isolated  villages, which  increase  their  transportation \ncosts, thereby restricting their access to basic goods and services. Most rural roads, especially \nin the western region, are in poor condition because of deficiencies in design and construction, \ninadequate  maintenance,  and  damage  caused  by  overloaded  vehicles.  The  roads\u2019  technical \nstandards  are  low:  only  11%  are  class  III  roads  or  above.  Village  roads  are  even  worse,  with \nmerely 2% being rated as class III or above. Only 20% of county roads, 15% of township roads, \nand 9% of village roads are paved. About 71% of rural roads are dirt roads, making them highly \nvulnerable to bad weather. As a result, many townships and villages still depend on earth tracks \nthat  have  no  drainage  system,  making  them  unsuitable  for  motorized  traffic  and  impassible \nduring  the  rainy  season.  This  limitation  prevents  the  rural  poor  from  taking  advantage  of  job \nopportunities generated by economic growth. \n \n6. \nAware of the importance of improved access to reducing poverty, the Government has \nbeen  pouring  funds  into  rural  road  construction.  During  the  10th  FYP,  it  has  constructed  or \nupgraded approximately 72,000 km of rural roads at a cost of CNY60.9 billion. By 2010, paved \nroads will link all villages in the eastern region, 80% of villages in the central region, and 90% of \nvillages in the western region. To this end, the Government plans to invest CNY100 billion more \nin rural roads during the 11th FYP (2006\u20132010).  \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nProblems and Constraints \n\n \n7. \nDespite the huge amount of investment, the road network still does not provide access to \nlarge  parts  of  the  country,  particularly  the  poorer  inland  regions,  and  is  inadequate  to  support \nsustainable  economic  growth.  Roads  built  to  a  high  standard  (above  class  II)  account  for  only \n19.7% of the total network. The remaining 20% are medium- to low-grade paved roads and gravel \nroads  (para.  5).  As  a  result,  the  expansion  in  the  demand  for  road  transport  has  strained  the \nroad  infrastructure,  as  manifested  by  bottlenecks  in  the  network.  The  resulting  high  cost  of \nshipping goods between inland provinces and ports has been a serious constraint.4  \n \n8. \nHunan, located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, is bordered by Jiangxi to the \neast, Chongqing and Guizhou to the west, Guangxi and Guangdong to the south, and Hubei to \nthe north. In 2004, the province\u2019s per capita gross domestic product was CNY7,546, or 83% of \nthe  national  average.  The  Project  is  located  in  Xiangxi  Autonomous  Prefecture  in  northwest \nHunan, and is one of the poorest areas in the country. Located mostly in rural and mountainous \nterritory,  accessibility  is  limited.  The  incidence  of  rural  poverty  is  30.1%.  The  project  area \nconsists  of  one  city  and  four  counties,  with  80%  of  the  population  living  in  rural  areas.  Ethnic \nminorities,  mainly  Tujia  and  Miao,  account  for  some  77%  of  the  population.  The  prefecture \npossesses water resources, mineral deposits, coal reserves, fertile soil, and tourism potential.5 \n\n                                                 \n3  Of  the  total  rural  roads,  479,372  km  are  county  roads,  945,180  km  are  township  roads,  and  1,473,534  km  are \n\n4 The shortage of adequate road networks has thus hindered economic growth and regional development in the PRC. \n5  Mineral resources are abundant: more than 50 kinds of minerals, including coal, iron, and manganese, have been \n\nvillage roads. \n\ndiscovered in 480 mines. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nIts  major  agricultural  outputs  are  citrus  fruits,  corn,  ramie,  tea,  rice,  and  tobacco.  The  leading \nindustries,  most  of  which  are  in  Jishou  city,  the  prefecture\u2019s  capital,  are  coal,  agricultural  and \nchemical processing, power, machinery manufacture, construction materials, and textiles. \n \nThe area\u2019s remoteness and inadequate road infrastructure are among the main causes \n9. \nof  the  area\u2019s  high incidence  of  poverty.  Only  two  thirds  of  villages  are  served  by  roads.  While \ndemand  for  the  prefecture\u2019s  products  from  other  provinces  has  been  increasing  continuously, \nthe weaknesses in the road infrastructure are hindering economic growth in the project area and \nin  Hunan.  The  national  highway  (NR319),  which  runs  parallel  to  the  project  expressway,  is  a \ncombination  of  class  II,  III,  and  IV  roads,  with  steep  slopes,  sharp  turns,  and  low  allowable \nspeed.  Congestion  is  a  daily  occurrence  because  of  the  booming  mining  and  agricultural \nprocessing industries. Traffic on NR319 has grown by about 7.3% per year in recent years, and \nalong  several  stretches  will  exceed  the  road\u2019s  capacity  by  2008.  Improvement  of  the  road \nnetwork  in  western  Hunan  is  needed  to  facilitate  economic  growth  and  to  integrate  the  poor, \nisolated regions of the country with the centers of economic growth. \n \n10. \nPoor road conditions have resulted in inadequate and unaffordable transport services in \nthe area. The poor quality of the roads deters licensed bus and truck operators from plying the \nroutes  to townships  and  villages. As  a  result,  many  villages  and  townships  in  the  project  area \nstill have no direct bus service. In addition, the  fares and routes of the formal bus system are \nregulated,  which  often  results  in  inefficient  services.  Thus  villagers  have  to  rely  on  informal \nmeans  of  transport,  such  as  bicycles  and  motorized  tricycles.  Because  informal  means  of \ntransport  are  constrained  to  local  services  between  villages  and  townships,  it  has  limitation  to \nreplace the formal transport system. For selling their products, the rural poor thus often rely on \ntraders who drive to villages with a stronger bargaining power. \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment\u2019s and Asian Development Bank\u2019s Strategies \n\n \n11. \nThe Government\u2019s strategy for road development is to construct expressways to expand \nthe  NTHS  and  link  all  cities  with  populations  of  more  than  500,000  and  develop  secondary \nroads,  particularly  those  that  will  connect  to  rural  markets.  The  Government  has  also  adopted \nthe western region development strategy, a key theme of the 10th FYP, to enhance economic \ndevelopment  in  the  western  part  of  the  country,  where  most  of  the  poor  reside.  The  strategy, \nwhich aims to reduce the disparity between western and coastal regions, assigns high priority to \nroad  sector  development  as  a  way  to  promote  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in  the \nwestern region. \n \n12. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  operational  strategy  in  the  PRC\u2019s  road  sector \nsupports  (i)  the  construction  of  roads  that  connect  major  growth  centers  with  hinterland \neconomies; (ii) the integration of the network so that the NTHS is supported by a system of local \nroads,  particularly  those  that  provide  access  to  poor  areas;  (iii)  the  delivery  of  adequate  and \naffordable  transport  services;  (iv)  the  promotion  of  road  safety  and  the  reduction  of  vehicle \nemissions; (v) the strengthening of institutions to increase financial and managerial efficiency in \nexpressway operation; (vi) the adoption of appropriate pricing policies to optimize road transport \ncapacity;  and  (vii)  the  use  of  alternative  methods  of  investment  financing,  including  private \nsector  participation.  In  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  strategy,  ADB  road  sector  assistance  has \nalso targeted the poor, less developed central and western provinces. The proposed Project is \nconsistent with the PRC\u2019s development priorities and ADB\u2019s strategy. \n \n\n3. \n\nOpportunities \n\n \n13. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  western  region  development  strategy  by  building  a  64  km \nexpressway  from  Jishou  to  Chadong,  a  link  in  the  Changsha\u2013Chongqing  corridor,  one  of  the \n\n\f 4 \n\neight high-priority western corridors included in the 10th FYP.6 The trip from Jishou to Chadong \nby car on NR319 currently takes 4 hours. The project expressway, which will be 30 km shorter, \nwill cut travel time to less than 1 hour. By lowering transport costs and improving the frequency \nand  level  of  transport  services,  the  Project  is  expected  to  spur  economic  activities  and  inter-\nregional trade, thereby helping reduce poverty in the project area. The development of the road \nnetwork  in  Western  Hunan  will  help  transfer  the  benefits  of  the  eastern  region\u2019s  economic \ngrowth  to  the  poor  western  region. A local  road  improvement  program  was  integrated  into  the \nProject to expand the road network in rural minority villages. The integrated approach will help \nspread the expressway\u2019s benefits to the poor. \n \n14. \nThe evaluations of several completed road projects financed by ADB have confirmed the \nimpacts of road investments on poverty reduction.7 Several ADB studies have also affirmed the \nrelevance  of  ADB\u2019s  strategy, 8  showing  that  road  infrastructure  has  contributed  to  poverty \nreduction in the PRC not only by directly improving the living conditions of the poor, but also by \ndiversifying their sources of income and helping to increase their productivity. The findings of an \nADB-funded technical assistance (TA) for Socioeconomic Impacts of Road Projects9 confirmed \nthe validity of the road portfolio\u2019s geographic focus: the poorer western interior provinces. The \nTA showed that complementary investments in local roads strengthen the impact of expressway \ninvestments. As such, ADB has expended rigorous efforts to identify road projects that have a \ntight focus on poverty. \n \n15. \nExternal  assistance  has  been  provided  to  help  the  Government  streamline  its  road \nsector  strategy  and  investment  projects,  mainly  by  ADB,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation, and the World Bank. Since 1991, ADB has extended 31 loans totaling $6.2 billion \nto  finance  4,391  km  of  expressways  and  8,237  km  of  associated  local  road  networks.  As  of \n1995, local roads have been included in the scope of road projects to make ADB\u2019s interventions \nin the road sector more pro-poor. Of the ADB-funded projects, 18 have already been completed \nand are open to traffic. ADB has also supplied 54 TA packages totaling $28.3 million to the road \nsector.  The  advisory  TAs  have  addressed  policy  and  institutional  issues,  including  highway \nplanning,  road  safety,  human  resources  development,  socioeconomic  assessment,  and \ntransport  pricing  and  the  mobilization  of  nongovernment  financial  resources.  The  World  Bank \nand  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  have  provided  about  $6.6  billion  and  \u00a5219 \nthese \nmillion,  respectively, \norganizations to ensure that each major development partner focuses on different corridors, and \ninformation related to policy advice is shared across the development community (Appendix 3). \n \n\ninvestments.

However,  an  important  lesson  learned  from  this \nProject11 was  that  concessions  to  private  companies  should  be  awarded  through  transparent \ncompetitive  bidding  to  maximize  the  benefits  of  the  concession  to  efficient  expressway \noperation.  Other  lessons  include  (i)  the  need  for  traffic  forecasts  to  reflect  rapid  economic \ngrowth, thereby avoiding expensive road widening within the first few years of operation; (ii) the \nadvantages  of  a  participatory  approach  to  project  preparation;  (iii)  the  benefits  of  a  well-\ncoordinated  resettlement  schedule,  preceded  by  consultations  with  the  affected  parties  before \ntheir  relocation;  (iv)  the  advantages  of  using  road  safety  audits  in  designing  and  constructing \nexpressways;  and  (v)  the  need  for  careful  geological  investigation  during  the  design  stage  to \nminimize unnecessary contract variations. All these issues have been taken into account during \nproject  preparation.  Due  attention  has  been  given  to  the  adequacy  of  the  O&M  framework  to \nensure  that  the  concession  is  reasonably  priced  by  awarding  it  through  transparent  bidding \n(para.  32).  Consultations  with  affected  villagers  were  emphasized  from  the  start,  and \ninternational  consulting  inputs  for  the  supervision  of  civil  works  were  included  to  ensure  a \ncareful review of geological investigations for the Project. \n \n17. \nPerformance  reviews  of  completed  road  projects  have  concluded  that  all  loans  to  the \nroad  sector  in  the  PRC  have  been  or  are  being  implemented  satisfactorily. 12  Of  seven \ncompleted  projects,  six  were  rated  as  generally  successful  and  one  was  rated  as  partly \nsuccessful.  The  performance  audit  reports  for  three  road  projects  concluded  that  they  were \neither highly successful or successful.13 The lessons gleaned from previous ADB-financed road \nprojects are reflected in the design of the Project. To avoid delayed loan effectiveness caused \nby  delays  in  procurement,  a  tendering  company  was  recruited  to  prequalify  civil  works \ncontractors.  ADB\u2019s  procurement  guidelines  and \nincluding  anticorruption \nprovisions,  were  discussed  extensively  during  appraisal.  Emphasis  was  put  on  the  need  to  (i) \nstrictly  follow  ADB\u2019s  mandatory  bidding  documents,  (ii)  evaluate  bids  according  to  ADB-\napproved evaluation criteria, and (iii) substantiate clearly the conclusions of the bid evaluation. \n \n\nrequirements, \n\n5. \n\nPolicy Dialogue  \n\n \nTransport Services in the Project Area. The extent to which the rural poor benefit from \n18. \na road project depends on their access to reliable and affordable transport services. Adequate \ntransport services provided on a competitive basis are a prerequisite for spreading the Project\u2019s \nbenefits to the rural poor, especially those who are currently beyond the reach of road transport \nservices.  During  project  preparation,  due  attention  was  given  to  the  delivery  of  efficient, \naffordable, and sustainable transport services in the project area. The TA survey indicated that \nwhen  roads  are  upgraded,  transport  services  improve  shortly  thereafter  and  the  frequency  of \nvillagers\u2019  trips  to  local  markets  and  towns  increases  significantly.14 The  improvement  of  local \nroads  will  thus  spur  transport  service  providers  to  improve  transport  services.  Further,  with \n                                                 \n10 One is the Hunan Expressway Project (approved in 1993), under which the Changsha\u2013Xiangtan and Changsha\u2013\nYongan sections were constructed (open to traffic in 1996). The other is the Hunan Roads Development II Project \n(approved 2004), under which the Changde\u2013Huaihua section (173 km) is under implementation. \n\n11 ADB. 2000.

Xiangxi  Autonomous  Prefecture,15 where  the  Project  is  located, has  only  one  class  II \nbus terminal in Jishou city, and more than 80% of townships do not have even rural bus stations. \nTo  enhance  the  sustainable  delivery  of  transport  services,  the  prefecture  has  implemented  a \nplan to construct class I\u2013IV bus terminals.16 A class I bus terminal is being constructed in Jishou \nand is scheduled to open in 2006. The construction of class II bus terminals in five counties is \nalso under way and at least one class II bus terminal will be built in each of the three remaining \ncounties  during  the  period  of  the  11th  FYP.  The  prefecture  aims  to  build  a  class  V  rural  bus \nstation in each village by 2015, 15 of which will be completed in the project area by 2007. HCD \nagreed to implement these facilities in tandem with the Project to ensure the efficient provision \nof transport services when the project roads have been built (Appendix 4). \n \n20. \nSmall Business Development Opportunities. Basic prerequisites for developing small \nbusinesses  in  the  project  area  are  generally  met.  Active  secondary  and  tertiary  markets  and \nmicrofinance  schemes  for  small  businesses  are  available  under  provincial  programs.  Several \npoverty  reduction  programs  are  being  implemented  either  by  the  government  or  multilateral \nassistance agencies. These programs will complement each other and provide a good basis for \nsetting up small businesses. In the project area, a wide assortment of businesses has already \nbeen established to provide basic necessities for local communities and travelers.17 When roads \nare  improved,  existing  enterprises  are  expected  to  expand  further  their  businesses.  The  TA \nsurvey  shows  that  the  current  trend  evinces  an  inherent  entrepreneurial  spirit  among  local \nresidents who, if given the opportunity, are likely to establish commercial enterprises. A number \nof factories are located along NR319, an indication that the proposed expressway  may attract \nlarger  commercial  establishments  to  the  vicinity.  With  the  improved  road  network  in  the  area, \nthe  following  sectors  were  identified  as  potential  sectors  for  small  business  opportunities:  (i) \nagriculture  and  agro-industry,  (ii)  herbal  medicines  and  handicrafts,  and  (iii)  community-based \ntourism and distribution facilities. \n \n21. \nUnder  the  TA,  a  strategy  was  prepared  to  develop  small  businesses  and  commercial \nactivities  that  includes  (i)  developing  new  community-based  enterprises,  (ii)  building  roadside \nstations as focal points for small businesses, (iii) creating economic zones for small businesses, \nand (iv) establishing a cultural zone for minorities where local minority communities can develop \ntheir entrepreneurial activities. Assistance is needed to channel local people into potential areas \nof  business  and  commercial  opportunities.  HCD  will  ensure  that  assistance,  such  as  the \nprovision  of  microfinance  and  entrepreneurial  training,  will  be  provided  through  provincial \npoverty reduction programs (Appendix 5). \n \n22. \nPrivate Sector Participation. In the PRC, the private sector has been involved in road \nprojects  through  cooperative  joint  ventures,  securitization,  revenue  bond  financing,  and  build-\noperate-transfer  contracts.  In  line  with  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  development  strategy,  Hunan  has \n\n                                                 \n15 The prefecture comprises 8 counties, 218 townships, and 2,664 villages. \n16 A bus terminal is classified according to its daily passenger handling capacity. A class I terminal handles more than \n10,000  passengers  per  day,  a  class  II  terminal  handles  5,000  to  10,000  passengers,  and  a  class  V  terminal \nhandles up to 500 passengers. \n\n17 Each kilometer of road averages about four businesses. One local road to be included in the Project has about six \n\nbusinesses per kilometer. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nactively  diversified  highway  financing:  to  date,  the  private  sector  is  involved  in  five \nexpressways.18 Except for the Changsha\u2013Xiangtan West section, which was implemented using \na  build-operate-transfer  method,  the  other  four  sections  with  private  sector  participation  have \ntapped the private sector for O&M through concession agreements. For the project expressway, \nthe  private  sector  will  also  be  involved  in  O&M  through  a  concession  when  the  financial \nrequirement is met (para. 32). \n \n23. \nRoad Safety. Road safety is a serious issue in the PRC. In 2004, 41 deaths occurred \nper 10,000 vehicles, which is high by international standards. The Ministry of Public Security is \ncommitted  to  reducing  accidents  through  improved  vehicular  safety,  driver  training,  and  traffic \nmanagement.  The  Road  Traffic  Safety  Law  went  into  effect  in  May  2004.  A  committee  was \nestablished  to  develop  and  implement  special  measures  that  would  enforce  nationwide \nregulations  on  overloaded  trucks,  including  putting  axle  load  limits  on  roads.  HCD  and  the \nHunan Public Security Bureau are working together to fulfill the requirements of the new law and \nenhance  road  safety.  At  least  6  months  prior  to  the  opening  of  the  expressway,  HCD  will  (i) \nimplement a road safety action plan\u2014with the help of an international consultant\u2014for the safe \noperation of the expressway; and (ii) ensure, in collaboration with Hunan Public Security Bureau, \nthat  a  team  of  bureau  personnel  will  patrol  the  expressway  and  enforce  the  new  law  and \nregulations.  The  Project\u2019s  major  contribution  to  road  safety  will  be  the  application  of  high \nconstruction  standards  to  the  expressway  to  reduce  accidents  in  the  corridor.  An  international \nroad safety specialist will be engaged for 2 months under the Project to help HCD develop the \nroad safety action plan and check designs and safety aspects of the project roads (Appendix 6). \n \n24. \nVehicle  Emissions.  The  increasing  number  of  vehicles  has  raised  concerns  about \nvehicle  emissions  and  air  pollution.  The  Government  has  taken  several  steps  to  control \nemissions:  imposing  regulations  on  the  automobile  industry,  requiring  an  annual  vehicle  test, \nand  drafting  a  vehicle  inspection  and  maintenance  program.  The  new  measures  also  set \nemission  and  fuel  efficiency  targets  and  offer  tax  incentives  for  manufacturers  of  more \nthe  Hunan \nenvironmentally-friendly  cars.  Hunan  has  vehicle  emission  standards,  and \nEnvironmental  Protection  Bureau  (HEPB)  regularly  tests  all  types  of  vehicles.  Meanwhile,  the \nProject will have positive impacts on air pollution, as emissions from vehicles along the project \nroads  are  expected  to  be  lower  because  of  better  traffic  flows  as  a  result  of  improved  road \nconditions. Upon completion of the Project, sulfur dioxide emissions from vehicles on the project \nroads  are  estimated  to  be  20%  lower  than  before  the  Project.  Likewise,  nitrogen  oxides \nemissions will be 12% lower than before the Project and carbon dioxide emissions will be 20% \nlower. At least 6 months prior to the opening of the expressway, HCD will provide ADB with (i) \nthe  regulations  for  vehicle  emission  limits  and  the  penalties  for  violating  emission  standards; \nand  (ii)  the  latest  government  plan  to  improve  air  quality  in  Hunan,  including  cleaner  fuel \nprograms.  With  the  assistance  of  consultants,  HCD  and  HEPB  will  develop  an  action  plan  to \ncontrol vehicle emissions in the area and implement it accordingly (Appendix 6). \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n25. \nThe  Project  will  help  promote  sustainable  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in \nHunan province as a whole and the project area in particular. It will achieve this by (i) enhancing \n\n                                                 \n18 The  five  sections  with  private  sector  participation  are  Changsha\u2013Xiangtan,  Changsha\u2013Yongan,  Xiangtan\u2013\nHengyang,  Changsha\u2013Xiangtan  West,  and  Changsha\u2013Yiyang.  Of  these,  Changsha\u2013Xiangtan,  and  Changsha\u2013\nYongan were funded by ADB (footnote 9). \n\n\f 8 \n\nOutputs \n\nSpecial Features \n\nroad  transport  efficiency  and  safety;  (ii)  improving  the  road  transport  network  by  building  a \nsection  from  Jishou  to  Chadong  in  the  Changsha\u2013Chongqing  western  corridor,  one  of  eight \nhigh-priority  western  corridors;  and  (iii)  improving  rural  minority  villages\u2019  access  to  income-\ngenerating opportunities and social services. \n \nB. \n \n26. \nThe Project comprises (i) the construction of a 64 km, access-controlled toll expressway \nfrom Jishou to Chadong, including a large suspension bridge (1.2 km), 13 tunnels (10.5 km in \ntotal),  36  extra  large  or  large  bridges  (18  km  in  total),  interchanges,  toll  stations,  and  service \nareas; (ii) the upgrading of 129 km of local roads to improve access to 52 poor villages in the \nrural  minority  area;  (iii)  the  promotion  of  private  sector  participation  through  the  O&M \nconcession;  and  (iv)  the  strengthening  of  the  Hunan  provincial  government\u2019s  capacity  in \nconstruction,  road  safety,  project  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  asset  management  and \nmaintenance through the provision of consulting services and training. \n \nC. \n \n27. \nIntegrated  Design  of  the  Local  Road  Component. In line with ADB\u2019s policy dialogue \nwith  the  Government,  a  local  road  improvement  program  was  integrated  into  the  Project  to \nexpand the road network in rural minority villages. The integrated approach will help spread the \nexpressway\u2019s  benefits  to  the  poor.  Better  tie-ins  between  the  expressway  and  local  roads  will \nenable more agricultural products to reach markets and allow farmers to upgrade their farming \npractices. As reliable transport to markets becomes more readily available, cash crop farming in \nremote or isolated areas will be stimulated and access to off-farm employment opportunities will \nbe  broadened.  The  Project  includes  two  priority  sections,  selected  from  Hunan\u2019s  road \ndevelopment plan in its local road component. The two sections total 129 km and serve 52 poor \nminority villages in the project area, particularly where access to township centers needs to be \nimproved. \n \n28. \nOf the ADB loan, $8.0 million will be allocated to the local road component, which will. \nBoth  sections  are  currently  unclassified  roads,  but  will  be  upgraded  to  class  III  and  IV  roads. \nSome 929,000 people (69% of the population in the project area) will benefit from the Project, of \nwhich  389,100  in  the  poor  minority  villages  will  benefit  from  improved  local  roads.19 The  local \nroads  will  (i)  be  upgraded  concurrently  with  the  project  expressway,  (ii)  use  Government\u2019s \ndesign  standards  that  are  acceptable  to  ADB,  (iii)  follow  ADB\u2019s  social  safeguard  policies,  and \n(iv)  be  accorded  the  same  degree  of  attention  as  the  expressway  in  relation  to  impact \nmonitoring. Some 300 person-months of domestic consultants will be allocated to the local road \ncomponent  to  ensure  proper  design  and  supervision,  project  monitoring  and  evaluation, \nengineering staff training, and project management. \n \n29. \nLocal Road Maintenance. Adequate maintenance is crucial to ensure the sustainability \nof  rural  roads,  a  job  for  which  local  administrative  units  are  responsible.  During  the  TA,  the \nfollowing  were  examined:  (i)  planning  of  and  standards  for  maintenance,  (ii)  funding  sources, \nand  (iii)  monitoring  of  maintenance  activities.  The  quality  of  rural  roads  does  not  seem  to  be \nsystematically  monitored  by  the  higher  authorities  concerned.  Maintenance  planning  often \nhinges on subjective assessments, mainly because of the local government\u2019s lack of resources \n\n                                                 \n19 The  section  in  Hauyuan  county  serves  the  Miao  minority  area  and  the  section  that  links  Baoijing  and  Guzhang \ncounties  serves  the Tujia  minority  area.  The  location  of  three  of  the  four  interchanges  was  determined  in  such  a \nway that the benefits from the project expressway are made available to the rural minorities. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nfor maintaining its road networks. Local authorities draft plans for routine maintenance work, but \nperiodic maintenance is rather budget-driven and lacks a systematic, preventive approach. Little \ndissemination of the activities or knowledge needed to monitor performance is apparent across \ncounties. There is no official funding channel for the maintenance of township or village roads.20 \nTherefore  a  reliable  funding  mechanism  for  maintaining  and  rehabilitating  rural  roads  must  be \ndesigned.  Considering  limited  funds  for  maintenance,  a  simple  method  for  evaluating  and \nprioritizing  maintenance  works  must  also  be  established  to  streamline  work  programming  and \nensure  effective  fund  use.  Apart  from  the  financial  angle,  local  governments\u2019  maintenance \nefforts are often hampered by the lack of qualified technical and managerial personnel, training \nresources, and equipment. \n \n30. \nDuring  project  preparation,  an  action  plan  was  devised  to  strengthen  local  road \nmaintenance  and  was  agreed  to  with  HCD.  According  to  the  plan,  HCD  will  develop  a  sound \nroad  maintenance  management  system  during  project  implementation.  The  system  will  (i) \nincorporate  measures  to  minimize  maintenance  costs;  (ii)  include  a  modern  method  of \nevaluation  and  maintenance  prioritization  for  efficient  work  programming  and  fund  use;  (iii) \ninclude  a  compilation  of  road  inventories,  together  with  basic  condition  data;  and  (iv)  have  a \nmonitoring  system  to  be  used  by  local  residents.  Furthermore,  HCD  will  encourage  county \ngovernments  to  adopt  competitive  bidding  to  enhance  efficiency  when  selecting  maintenance \ncontractors. A training program will be provided under the Project to strengthen the capacity of \nlocal government maintenance units (Appendix 7). \n \n31. \nOperation  and  Maintenance  Concession.  Expressway  O&M  improves  substantially \nwhen  handled  by  the  private  sector.  An  O&M  concession  is  an  agreement  between  a \ngovernment  or  a  state  enterprise  and  a  private  enterprise,  whereby  the  private  enterprise \nmaintains the road according to agreed standards and collects tolls from users that finance the \nmaintenance  and  reward  the  concessionaire.  O&M  concessions  sidestep  public  sector \nbudgetary  constraints  by  securing  toll  revenues  as  a  maintenance  fund  without  requiring  the \nfunds  to  flow  through  the  government\u2019s  budgeting  process  and  increase  service  efficiency  by \nbringing  in  an  experienced  private  sector  concessionaire  that  can  operate  and  maintain  the \nproject  expressway  at  a  lower  cost  than  the  government  can.  Under  an  O&M  contract,  the \nconcessionaire  assumes  the  traffic  risk  and,  ultimately,  the  revenue  risk  as  well. 21  O&M \nconcession  is  therefore  a  feasible  public-private  sector  partnering  option  since  it  distributes \nproject risks reasonably between the government and the private sector. \n \n32.  When the Project expressway\u2019s operating-profit ratio exceeds 10%, HCD will use its best \nefforts  to  award  an  O&M  concession  to  a  private  enterprise,  through  a  competitive  bidding.  In \nparticular,  based  on  lessons  learned  from  previous  projects  (para.  16),  due  attention  will  be \ngiven to enhance transparency in the bidding process for the concession, to optimize the gain of \nthe concession to the efficiency in expressway operation. In this regard, HCD, with the help of \nan  international  consultant  to  be  engaged  under  the  Hunan  Roads  Development  II  Project, \nprepare the bidding documents and the O&M concession framework. The framework will specify \nthe  concession  period  and  selection  criteria,  and  ensure  adequate  pricing  and  transparent \nauctioning. HCD  will submit the bidding documents  and the concession framework to ADB for \nreview by 30 June 2006. \n\n                                                 \n20 The  counties  are  responsible  for  county  and  township  road  maintenance  (mostly  class  IV  and  above),  for  which \nthey use their road maintenance funds. However, villagers carry out the maintenance of village roads (below class \nIV), which account for two thirds of the roads in the prefecture. \n\n21 ADB.  2004.  Report  and  Recommendations  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Loans  to  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Hunan Roads Development II Project. Manila. Further details are presented in \nAppendix 5. \n\n\f 10 \n\nIntelligent Transport System (ITS). An expressway ITS22 is being developed in Hunan, \n33. \nfollowing the drafting by HCD of an ITS policy in 2002 using standards prepared by the national \nITS  Center.  The  ITS  policy\u2019s  objectives  are  to  (i)  introduce  a  network-wide  toll  system  for  all \nexpressways  in  Hunan,  (ii)  reduce  the  time  it  takes  to  pay  a  toll,  (iii)  improve  safety  through \nenhanced electronic enforcement and monitoring, (iv) provide up-to-date information to travelers, \n(iv)  provide  assistance  in  emergencies,  and  (v)  improve  traffic  management  and  infrastructure \nmaintenance. In line with this policy, equipment for the ITS will be procured under the Project to \nenhance the effectiveness of traffic surveillance, traffic management and tunnel safety, and the \nmonitoring of toll plazas.23 About 4% of the ADB loan ($7.6 million) will be allocated to procure \nITS  equipment,  and  training  in  its  use  will  be  provided  with  the  help  of  consulting  services \n(Appendix 8). \n \nAsset Management. Asset management must be developed to ensure the sustainability \n34. \nof the expressway and local road operations. During project implementation, HCD will prepare \nan asset management development plan, which will establish a computerized database system \nand  promote  the  use  of  modern  equipment,  and  provide  a  training  program  to  enhance \nemployees\u2019 skills at the provincial, county, and township levels. To facilitate the implementation \nof  the  plan,  consultants  will  be  hired  to  formulate  an  action  plan  comprising:  (i)  immediate \nmeasures needed when the project company is set up and the organizational structure is put in \nplace,  (ii)  short-term  measures  needed  prior  to  the  completion  of  the  expressway,  and  (iii) \nmedium-term  measures  needed  within  the  first  3  years  of  expressway  operations.  HCD  will \nassign the Hunan Communications College to develop a training program to enhance the skills \nof  provincial  and  local  government  staff  to  ensure  sustainability  of  the  operation  of  the \nexpressway and local roads (Appendix 8). \n \n35. \nStakeholder  Consultations.  During  preparation  of  the  feasibility  study,  environmental \nimpact  assessment  and  resettlement  planning  consultations  were  conducted  with  government \nagencies, villagers, local groups, and other people likely to be affected by the Project to discuss \nenvironmental  concerns,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  issues,  and  economic  development \npotential.  Village  investigations  and  surveys  were  conducted  in  the  project  area  to  assess  the \npotential adverse effects and benefits of the Project. Over 3,450 people were interviewed during \nthe  course  of  public  opinion  surveys,  social  and  environmental  assessments,  and  resettlement \nplanning.  For  the  resettlement  plan,  consultation  meetings  were  held  with  representatives  of \naffected counties, townships, and villages. Rural people were familiar with the Project and public \nsupport for it was high. Local officials explained the policies and regulations for compensation to \nthose  who  would  be  adversely  affected  by  the  loss  of  farmland  or  housing.  The  consultation \nprocess was expanded to finalize the design and formulate appropriate compensation standards \nand rehabilitation measures for people displaced by land acquisition or house demolition. Villagers \nparticipated in the discussions and decisions on village resettlement (Appendix 9). \n \nD. \n \n36. \nThe total cost of the Project is $519.51 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange cost \nof $263.98 million (50.8%) and a local currency cost of $255.53 million equivalent (49.2%). The \ncost of the local road component is $20.7 million. Of the $208 million ADB loan, $8.0 million is \nallocated for the local road component, with the remaining costs to be funded by the provincial \n\nCost Estimates \n\n                                                 \n22 The application of information technology to transport is referred to as an intelligent transport system.  \n23 Equipment  for  the  ITS  includes  a  traffic  control  center,  toll  revenue  management  centers,  toll  system, \ncommunications  system,  traffic  surveillance  system,  overloaded  vehicle  checking  system,  tunnel  ventilation  and \nsafety, emergency service facilities, and so on. \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nand county governments.

The Borrower of the Loan will be the PRC. The loan will \nhave  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft Loan and Project agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for \nits decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n38. \nThe  Ministry  of  Communications  and  the  Hunan  Provincial  Government  (HPG)  will \nprovide  30%  of  the  project  costs  on  a  grant  basis.  The  Ministry  of  Communications  grant  will \namount to $59.74 million and the HPG grant to $94.58 million. The State Development Bank will \nprovide  a  $157.19  million  loan  on  a  25-year  term  at  an  interest  rate  of  5.51%.  The  ADB  loan \nproceeds will be made available by the Borrower to HPG, which will onlend $200 million to the \nproject  company  with  the  same  financial  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan.  The \nproject company will bear the interest rate variation and foreign exchange risks. Hunan province \nwill  keep  the  balance  of  $8.0  million  and  use  it  for  the  local  road  component;  it  will  bear  the \n\n\f 12 \n\ninterest rate variation and foreign exchange risks for this amount.

The project company will be the \nimplementing  agency  and  will  coordinate  and  monitor  the  expressway\u2019s  construction  activities \nand  operate  the  expressway.  Its  general  manager,  the  project  director,  will  be  responsible  for \noverall  project  management  in  relation  to  the  expressway,  the  approval  of  contracts,  and \npayments.  HCD  will  implement  the  local  road  component  through  local  communications \nbureaus. A project implementation unit established within the project company will facilitate land \nacquisition,  resettlement,  and  environmental  protection  measures  and  will  ensure  that  local \nconcerns  are  addressed  adequately.  The  unit  will  be  headed  by  a  project  manager,  who  will \noversee day-to-day physical implementation activities and prepare progress reports. In addition \nto  its  central  office,  the  project  company  will  have  four  toll  stations  and  three  maintenance \ncenters.  HCD  has  sufficient  technical  capability  to  implement  the  Project;  however,  its \ninstitutional capacity needs to be further strengthened in some areas such as the ITS and asset \nmanagement and assistance will be provided under the consulting services. \n \n \n \nPreconstruction  activities\u2014detailed  design,  preparation  of  bidding  documents, \n40. \nprequalification of contractors, and tendering and awarding of contracts\u2014has begun in October \n2005.  Completion  of  the  preconstruction  activities  is  targeted  for  November  2006.  Preliminary \ndesign was completed in April 2005 and detailed design will be completed in December 2005. \nThe construction of the expressway is scheduled to start in December 2006 and the Project will \nbe completed by December 2011. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 11. \n \n \n \n41. \nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  main \ncivil works will be divided into 18 packages, the pavement into 2 packages, and the equipment \ninto 3 packages, all of which will be procured under international competitive bidding procedures \n(Appendix  12).  Ancillary  facilities,  including  the  administration  building  and  service  areas \nbuilding under domestic financing, and equipment for traffic engineering, will be procured using \nlocal competitive bidding. Procurement for the local roads will use local competitive bidding.

Only prequalified contractors with adequate technical \nand financial capacities will be allowed to bid for several packages and may be awarded more \nthan  one  contract  based  on  the  least-cost  combination  of  contracts.  The  relevant  sections  of \nADB\u2019s anticorruption policy will be included in all documents and contracts related to the bidding \nfor and implementation of the Project. \n \n \n \n42. \nThe Project will finance 47 person-months of international consulting services. Of the 47 \nperson-months of international consultants, 36 will be for the supervision of the civil works, six \nwill  be  for  bridge  construction,  two  each  will  be  for  road  safety  and  traffic  management  and \ntunnel construction, and one will be for asset management. HCD will engage and finance 3,700 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consultants.  Of  the  3,700  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \nservices,  300  person-months  will  be  allocated  to  the  local  road  component  to  ensure  proper \ndesign,  supervision,  and  project  management,  as  well  as  to  train  engineering  staff.  About  24 \nperson-months will be allocated to monitoring the Project\u2019s socioeconomic and poverty impacts. \nThe international consultants will be financed by the ADB loan and will be recruited through a \nfirm  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consulting  Services  by  Asian \nDevelopment Bank and Its Borrowers. The domestic consultants will be financed from domestic \nresources and will be recruited in accordance with government procedures acceptable to ADB. \nHCD  will  establish  three  resident  supervision  engineer  offices  for  construction  supervision, \nenvironmental and resettlement monitoring, and project performance monitoring and evaluation. \nThe  chief  supervision  engineer\u2019s  office  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project  supervision.  The \nchief supervision engineer will be assisted by two deputies, one of whom will be the team leader \nof  the  international  consultants.  The  team  leader  will  help  the  chief  supervision  engineer  with \nproject  and  contract  management  activities  and  certify  progress  payments  and  contract \nvariations prior to their approval by the chief supervision engineer. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \nThe  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.24 \n43. \nBecause  most  of  the  payments  will  be  made  for  large  contracts  (above  $100,000  equivalent), \ndirect  payments,  reimbursements,  and  commitment  procedures  will  be  used  to  withdraw  loan \nfunds.  If  government  funds  are  used  first  for  eligible  expenditures,  ADB\u2019s  reimbursement \nprocedure  will  be  followed.  To  expedite  the  flow  of  funds,  the  statement  of  expenditures \nprocedure  may  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  for  any  individual  payment  not \nexceeding $100,000 equivalent. \n \n \n \n44. \nHCD  and  the  project  company  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project  and \nrelated financial statements and will have them audited annually in accordance with appropriate \nauditing  standards  consistently  applied  by  external  auditors  whose  qualifications,  experience, \nand  terms  of  reference  are  acceptable  to  ADB.  HCD  and  the  project  company  will  submit  to \nADB  within  6  months  of  the  end  of  each  related  fiscal  year  the  project  company\u2019s  audited \nconsolidated  financial  statements.  To  ensure  that  internal  controls  and  checks  on  the  project \nconstruction costs and operations are effective, HCD will establish an internal audit unit and will \nmaintain  it  during  implementation  and  operation  of  the  Project.  The  unit  will  undertake \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n6. \n\n                                                 \n24 ADB. 2001. Loan Disbursement Handbook.

HCD  will \nmake  satisfactory  arrangements  for  reporting  implementation  progress  through  quarterly \nprogress reports. Within 3 months of completion, HCD will submit a project completion report to \nADB. \n \n \n \n45. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to, and discussed with, HDC. Consistent with \nits commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to \ninvestigate,  directly  or  through  HCD,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  were  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the \nProject.  Attention  was  drawn  to  the  section  on  fraud  and  corruption  that  was  added  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.25 ADB\u2019s program for the \nPRC  includes  assistance  that  will  improve  governance  and  provide  incentives  to  reduce  the \nlevel  of  corruption  over  the  long  term.  Based  on  the  recommendations  of  the  July  2004  PRC \nCountry Performance Portfolio Mission, ADB will organize a seminar on how to detect fraud and \ncorruption during procurement in 2005. \n \n46. \nIn  relation  to  the  Project,  HCD  will  ensure  (i)  that  a  supervisory  body  is  established  to \nprevent undue interference in business practices with adequate resources made available for its \neffective  operation;  (ii)  that  a  leading  group  of  officials  from  HCD\u2019s  Supervision  Division  is \nlocated  in  offices  involved  in  project  bidding,  construction,  and  other  operational  activities;  (iii) \nthat  briefings  between  HCD  and  the  Prosecutor's  Office  are  held  on  a  regular  basis  to  share \ninformation  on  or  warnings  about  any  corrupt  practices  detected;  (iv)  that  the  contractors\u2019 \nactivities in relation to fund withdrawals and settlements are periodically inspected; and (v) that \na  dual  signing  system  is  introduced  whereby  the  civil  works  contract  winner  also  signs  an \nanticorruption contract with the employer. \n \n \n \n47. \nTo  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  its  operations  and  to  be  accountable  for  its \nperformance  to  stakeholders,  ADB  uses  the  project  performance  management  system.  The \nmonitoring  will  be  undertaken  with  a  focus  on  a  few  key  representative  communities  in  the \nproject  area.  A  basic  monitoring  framework  was  constructed  for  the  Project  to  permit  a  more \ndefinitive  assessment  of  the  actual  benefits.  HCD  has  concurred  with  (i)  the  monitoring \nframework,  (ii)  the  set  of  indicators  to  be  used  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  the  Project\u2019s \nimpacts,  and  (iii)  the  three  representative  villages  in  the  project  area.  The  indicators  were \nselected based on the findings of the ADB-financed TA for the Socioeconomic Assessment of \nRoad  Projects  (footnote  8).  The  baseline  values  for  the  indicators  were  established,  where \navailable, during project preparation, and will be updated at project inception. The indicators will \nbe  measured  at  project  completion  and  biennially  for  5  years  following  completion.  By \nDecember 2006, HCD will recruit an independent local institute to provide 24 person-months for \nsurveys,  analyses,  and  reporting.  A  report  summarizing  the  key  findings  will  be  submitted  to \nADB. HCD and local governments have assured that adequate monitoring will be carried out in \nthe selected communities (Appendix 13). \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n8. \n\n                                                 \n25 The  Government  has  made  significant  efforts  to  combat  corruption  in  the  road  sector.  To  date,  15  government \nofficials  from  10  provinces  have  been  found  to  be  involved  in  corruption.  Information  related  to  these  corruption \ncases  is  in  the  public  domain.  According  to  the  China  National  Audit  Office,  there  is  no  evidence  that  any  of  the \nreported corruption was related to ADB-funded road projects. \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n9. \n\nProject Review  \n\n \n \n48. \nIn 2008, ADB and HCD will carry out a midterm review of the Project, focusing on policy, \ninstitutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, economic, financial, \nand  other  relevant  factors  that  may  have  an  impact  on  the  Project\u2019s  performance  and  its \ncontinuing  viability.  The  review  will  examine  progress  in  sectoral  reforms,  policy  development, \nresettlement, and compliance with assurances in the Loan Agreement. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\nEconomic Analysis  \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  Project  will  increase  the  corridor\u2019s  capacity  to  meet  the  demand  for  transport  and \n49. \nreduce transport costs, travel time, and accident rates. It will provide employment opportunities \nboth  during  and  after  construction  and  will  be  a  conduit  for  increased  economic  growth  and \nhigher  incomes.  The  local  road  component  will  help  bring  these  benefits  to  the  poorest \ncommunities  in  the  project  area.  Traffic  on  the  expressway  is  forecast  to  grow  from  6,000 \nannual average daily traffic in 2010 to 12,650 in 2019, an average annual increase of 8%. After \n2019, traffic growth is expected to slow down to 5% per year, reaching 21,350 annual average \ndaily traffic by 2029. The traffic projections consider (i) the growth in traffic during the past 10 \nyears, (ii) the traffic generated by expanded economic activities, (iii) the likelihood that NR319 \ntraffic will be diverted to the expressway once the latter is operational, and (iv) the traffic survey \nresults (Appendix 14).  \n \nB. \n \n50. \nThe  Project\u2019s  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  estimated  by  comparing  the \nproject case with a base case involving the continued use and maintenance of NR319. Without \nthe  Project,  congestion  will  worsen,  increasing  delays,  vehicle  operating  costs,  accidents,  and \ndeaths.  The  Project,  with  the  shorter  distance  and  travel  time,  safer  design,  and  better  road \nconditions,  will  reduce  vehicle  operating  costs  and  accident  risks  along  the  corridor.  The \neconomic costs are the cost of capital, which includes physical contingencies, land acquisition, \nand  resettlement,  and  the  costs  of  operating  and  maintaining  the  project  roads,  which  include \nreplacing  depreciated  equipment.  The  economic  benefits  are  (i)  savings  in  vehicle  operating \ncosts resulting from the shorter distance and improved road conditions, (ii) time savings for road \nusers, (iii) savings in road accident costs, and (iv) value-added gains from tourism in the project \narea that are attributable to the Project. The benefits generated from tourism development were \nmeasured  by  comparing  the  with  project  situation  to  the  without  project  situation.26 The  costs \nand benefits of the Project were valued at 2005 economic prices. At 19.1% per year, the EIRR \ndemonstrates the Project\u2019s economic viability, with vehicle operating cost savings accounting for \nmost of the benefits (82%). The benefits of the local road component, while extremely important \nto the villages concerned, constitute a small percentage of the overall project benefits, reflecting \nthe  modest  traffic  levels  on  local  roads.  The  results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  confirmed  the \nrobustness  of  the  Project\u2019s  economic  viability.  Changes  in  the  key  variables\u2014construction \ncosts,  traffic  growth,  and  benefits\u2014did  not  significantly  affect  its  viability,  and  the  EIRR \nremained above the threshold of 12% per year. The EIRR was 17.7% for the expressway and \n21.0% for the local road component (Appendix 15). \n \n\n                                                 \n26 Environmental benefits will also result from reduced vehicle emissions and noise, but these have not been included \n\nin the analysis for lack of a suitable evaluation methodology. \n\n\f 16 \n\nFinancial Analysis and Projections \n\nC. \n \n51. \nThe assumed toll rates for the project expressway are considered reasonable to attract \nsufficient traffic to meet the criteria for EIRR and financial rate of return (FIRR). Hunan has a toll \npolicy for expressways governed by the Highway Law, with the following criteria: (i) toll levels on \nother  expressways,  (ii)  affordability,  (iii)  advantages  to  the  users  of  the  expressway  and \nalternative roads, (iv) historical and actual traffic flows, and (v) debt service ability. The project \ncompany,  in  consultation  with  ADB,  will  propose  the  toll  rates  for  the  expressway.  HCD,  the \nHunan  Finance  Department,  and  the  Hunan  Price  Bureau  will  evaluate  the  proposal  and \napprove the toll rates. HCD will consult with ADB about the proposed initial toll rates 6 months \nbefore  the  opening  of  the  expressway.  HCD  and  the  project  company  will  review  the  toll \nannually and monitor actual traffic levels and financial performance. \n \n52. \nFinancial projections prepared for the expressway in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \nfor  the  Financial  Government  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  the  ADB \nassessed  the  financial  viability  and  sustainability  (Appendix  16).  The  projected  financial \nstatements indicate that financial revenues will be sufficient to absorb O&M costs, income taxes, \nand  debt  service.  The  financial  evaluation  of  the  expressway  was  computed  using  constant \n2005  prices.  The  Project\u2019s  cost  estimates  and  financial  projections  in  nominal  terms  were \nconverted  to  real  terms  by  adjusting  for  the  projected  effects  of  foreign  and  domestic  inflation \nand currency fluctuations. The FIRR for the project expressway is estimated at about 5.5% after \ntaxes.27 This compares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital of 2.8%, also net of \ntaxes.  The  expressway  is  considered  to  be  both  financially  viable  and  sustainable.  Sensitivity \nanalysis indicates that the FIRR is robust under adverse conditions (Appendix 17). \n \nD. \n \n53. \nThe project area covers one city and four counties, all of which are considered poor by \neither national or provincial standards. Also within the area are 1,381 villages, 600 of which are \npoor. Of the 1.4 million residents in the project area, 965,400 live in rural areas and 387,700 live \nin  urban  areas.  Of  the  rural  population,  343,400  (30.1%)  are  poor,  with  an  annual  per  capita \nincome  of  less  than  CNY900.  Of  the  urban  population,  46,200  (11.9%)  are  poor.  The \nexpressway will cut 3 hours off the journey time between Jishou and Chadong. Once linked to \nthe major road network, the improved local roads will facilitate the spread of the expressway\u2019s \nbenefits to the rural economy. Improved transportation will increase income opportunities from \ncash  crop  farming  or  seasonal  work  requiring  migration,  promote  more  contact  with  urban \ncenters, and improve access to markets and social services. \n \n54. \nThe surveys indicate that the project expressway will directly benefit road users, such as \ntransport providers, bus and truck operators, passengers, traders, government officials, and the \nprivate  sector  in  general.  Rural  households  in  the  project  area  are  also  a  beneficiary  group. \nFarmers  will  be  in  a  position  to  increase  their  agricultural  incomes  through  better  access  to \nmarkets, more competitive product and input prices, and cheaper transport costs. They will also \nhave better access to social services and information and increased interaction with the outside \nworld. Migration to nonfarm jobs, an important source of cash income for most rural households, \nwill increase, as the expressway will facilitate movement to other cities and provinces. In relation \nto  tourism,  Huayuan  county  is  a  land  of  beautiful  natural  scenery  and  well-preserved  ethnic \nminority traditions. Most of the attractions are in rural areas. In addition Fenghuang, which the \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n\n                                                 \n27 HCD will propose a toll of CNY5 for use of the suspension bridge, which needs to be approved by HPG. The FIRR \n\nwas estimated assuming a toll of CNY5 for bridge users. \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nlocal road component will make more accessible, has one of the most beautiful small cities in \nPRC. The Project will therefore boost tourism in the project area, benefiting the poor in Jishou \ncity and Huayuan, Guzhang, and Fenghuang counties (Appendix 18). \n \nBetter  roads  enhance  people\u2019s  quality  of  life  by  providing  easier  access  to  social \n55. \nservices,  for  instance,  by  encouraging  more  teachers  and  doctors  to  work  in  rural  areas. \nImproved roads cut transport costs and the time needed to travel to a health facility. The health \nimpact  will  be  reflected  in  lower  mortality  and  morbidity  rates.  Upgraded  roads  also  increase \npeople\u2019s mobility. However, the construction of the expressway will increase the number of truck \nand  bus  drivers  passing  through  communities,  putting  the  residents  at  higher  risk  of  acquiring \nsexually  transmitted  infections,  including  HIV/AIDS.  The  Center  for  Disease  Control  of  the \nHunan Provincial Health Department implements preventive measures and adopts tight health \nand  hygiene  standards.  Such  measures  include  providing  education  programs,  distributing \ncondoms  to  local  residents,  and  monitoring  any  outbreaks  and  spread  of  disease.  The  center \nconducts regular inspections on construction sites to control sexually transmitted infections and \nmaintain high standards of hygiene.28 To reduce the risk of HIV/AIDS infection from the Project, \nthe center will introduce preventive measures at the construction sites and catchment area. Its \nservices  include  voluntary  counseling  and  testing  kits  and  education.  In  carrying  out  the  civil \nworks contracts, the Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Epidemic Disease will be followed. \nTargeted and broadly based advocacy and awareness programs will also be carried out in the \nproject area.29 \n \n56. \nAbout  77%  of  the  population  in  the  project  area  is  composed  of  ethnic  minorities, \npredominantly Miao and Tujia (98% of the minorities). Around 60% of the ethnic population will \nbenefit from the Project. An ethnic minorities development plan (EMDP) was prepared based on \nthe Resettlement Plan and ongoing government policies and programs for ethnic minorities. The \nEMDP  contains  the  necessary  measures,  such  as  income  enhancement,  to  mitigate  the \nProject\u2019s adverse impacts and ensure that its benefits flow directly to the ethnic minorities. The \nmain  issue  to  be  tackled  will  be  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  About  84%  of  the  people \naffected  by  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  be  minorities.  Such  impacts  and  the \ncorresponding  mitigating  measures  are  also  addressed  in  the  Resettlement  Plan.  HCD  has \nfinalized  the  EMDP  based  on  feedback  from  Xiangxi  Autonomous  Prefecture,  relevant  county \nand township level officials, and ADB. A summary of the EMDP is in Appendix 19. \n \n57. \nThe  Project  will  give  women  greater  access  to  information  and  jobs.  Female  migrant \nworkers in search of work will find it easier to travel to distant provinces on the expressway. In \nrelation to agriculture, women will also derive advantages from the Project, especially because it \nis  they  who  handle  most  of  the  farm  work.  In  addition,  women  will  benefit  from  increased \nmarketing opportunities (most fruit and vegetable sellers in local markets are women) and from \nbetter access to education and health facilities. The Project will enhance women\u2019s participation \nin  planning  and  project  monitoring  and  evaluation  and  in  the  implementation  of  other  poverty \nreduction programs, particularly in the villages served by the local road component. Women are \n\n                                                 \n28 In  addition,  HPG  established  the  Hunan  Provincial  AIDS  Prevention  and  Control  Committee,  which  includes \nofficials  from  32  provincial  departments  and  7  prefecture  governments,  to  prevent  outbreaks  of  the  disease  and \neffectively  control  its  spread.  To  date,  7  cases  have  been  found  in  the  project  area  and  1,249  cases  have  been \nfound in the province since 1995. \n\n29 HCD  will  ensure  that  contractors  disseminate  information  on  the  risks  of  sexually  transmitted  infections  and \nHIV/AIDS  to  their  employees  during  project  implementation,  a  requirement  that  will  be  included  in  the  contract. \nLocal public health offices will disseminate similar information to ethnic minorities, transport operators, and women \nin the project area in accordance with ongoing HIV/AIDS prevention efforts. \n\n\f 18 \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\nentitled  to  equal  opportunity  and  pay  in  jobs  under  the  PRC  Labor  Law  and  will  receive \npreferential treatment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development. \n \nE. \n \n58. \nThe  Resettlement  Plan  was  prepared  based  on  the  preliminary  design;  39  village \nsurveys;  403  household  surveys;  local  government  statistics;  and  consultations  with  local \nofficials,  village  leaders,  and  affected  households.  The  expressway  will  directly  affect  10 \ntownships  and  39  villages  in  Jishou  city  and  Huayuan  county.  In  the  39  villages,  minority \nnationalities account for 84% of the population (Miao 74% and Tujia, 10%). About 351 hectares \nof land will be permanently acquired, affecting 9,000 people, of which 32% is paddy, 19% is dry \nland,  3%  is  land  used  to  grow  vegetable  and  orchards,  and  44%  is  forestland.  About  115 \nhectares  of  land  will  be  temporarily  used  during  the  construction  phase.  Farmland  acquisition \nwill  displace  3,105  people.  Some  27,500  square  meters  of  brick  and  wood  houses  and  other \nstructures will also be demolished, displacing 973 people. \n \nThe  Resettlement  Plan  was  formulated  in  accordance  with  the  PRC\u2019s  laws  and  local \n59. \nregulations and with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and Indigenous People\u2019s Policy. \nThe impact on the villages is modest; however, because 10-15% of the affected households are \npoor,  special  measures  will  be  taken  to  assist  vulnerable  and  other  households  at  risk.  Land \nacquisition will be completed by April 2006. House relocation will be completed ahead of time at \na site within villages and just a short distance from the original area of residence. Compensation \nwill be paid prior to the displacement of people or loss of land and will be invested in economic \nand social infrastructure so that farmers\u2019 livelihoods and living standards will improve. Economic \nrehabilitation strategies have been discussed with the 10 most seriously affected villages. The \npreliminary  estimate  for  resettlement  costs  is  $32  million.  A  resettlement  information  booklet \nwas distributed to the affected villages and households in June 2005 and the Resettlement Plan \nwas  uploaded  on  the  ADB  web  site  in  October  2005.  Based  on  the  detailed  design,  the \nResettlement  Plan  is  to  be  updated  and  sent  to  ADB  for  approval  by  December  2005.  The \nsummary Resettlement Plan is included in Appendix 20. \n \nF. \n \n60. \nADB has classified the Project as environmental category A. The environmental impact \nassessment  (EIA)  report  was  prepared  by  HCD,  under  the  supervision  of  HEPB,  and  was \napproved  by  the  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration  in  May  2005. 30  The  EIA \nassessed the environmental impacts of the selected alignment of the expressway and the local \nroad  components  and  prescribed  environmental  protection  and  mitigation  measures  costing \n$5.8 million.31 The proposed alignment does not cross or impinge on any protected areas; there \nare no known rare or endangered species in the project area. The Project\u2019s major environmental \nimpacts include soil and water conservation and erosion control. A soil erosion prevention plan \nwas  prepared  separately  from  the  EIA.  To  ensure  that  all  potential  adverse  environmental \nimpacts of the Project are mitigated, HCD will implement the environmental management plan. \nThe  environmental  management  plan  will  be  incorporated  in  the  bidding  documents  and \ncontracts for civil works. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\n                                                 \n30 The  EIA  for  the  stretch  of  the  expressway  between  the  sections  of  the  Hunan  Roads  Development  II  and  III \nprojects was prepared as part of the EIA for the whole section from Changde to Huaihua during the preparation of \nthe Hunan Roads Development Project II. It was approved by the State Environmental Protection Administration in \nNovember 2003. Approval of the EIA for the Chongqing section of the corridor is expected by 2005. \n\n31 A  summary  EIA  was  circulated  to  the  ADB  Board  on  27  May  2005  and  placed  on  the  ADB  web  site  on  31  May \n\n2005. The Chinese version of the EIA was sent to the Project\u2019s field offices. \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nRisks \n\nG. \n \n61. \nThe  Project  has  been  designed  to  reduce  potential  technical,  economic,  financial,  and \nsocial risks. The main technical risks are associated with the construction of a large suspension \nbridge  and  the  13  tunnels.  To  minimize  the  risks,  international  consultants  reviewed  the \nproposed  design  and  construction  methods.  The  prequalification  of  contractors  will  focus  on \ntheir  financial  and  technical  capabilities  in  handling  similar  works.  During  the  construction \nperiod,  monitoring  and  contract  management  information  systems  will  be  set  up  and \nimplemented,  with  the  assistance  of  the  international  consultants,  for  timely  identification  of \ntechnical problems and implementation of corrective measures. HCD has a proven track record \nand satisfactory performance in implementing internationally financed projects. The financial risk \nassociated with the construction and operation of the expressway will depend on the actual level \nand  composition  of  traffic,  the  construction  costs,  the  ability  of  the  commercial  management, \nand  the  tolls  charged.  To  control  the  financial  risks,  the  project  company  will  create  a \ncommercial  business  environment  for  expressway  operations  and  the  central  and  provincial \ngovernments will inject substantial equity into the project expressway.  The social risks include \nresettlement,  HIV/AIDS  infection,  and  impacts  on  ethnic  minority  communities.  Appropriate \nmitigation measures are in place in the Resettlement Plan and EMDP. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  following  specific  assurances  have  been \n\n \nA. \n \n62. \nincorporated in the legal documents. \n \n63. \nCounterpart Financing.

Of this, 1.52 million km were \nclassified. Class II and above roads accounted for 299,524 km, or 19.7% of the total length. The \nroad density increased from 12.1 km per 100 square km (km2) in 1995 to 19.4 km per 100 km2 \nin  2004.  In  2004,  rural  roads  totaled  2.9  million  km  in  2004:  479,372  km  are  county  roads; \n945,180  km  are  township  roads,  and  1,473,534  km  are  village  roads.  Hunan\u2019s  road  network \naccounted for 4.7% of the country\u2019s total, with a length of 85,233 km. Of this, 39,691 km (46.6 \n%) were classified: 1,218 km of expressways (1.4%), 469 km of class I roads (0.6%), and 5,174 \nkm  of  class  II  roads  (6.1%).The  road  density  in  Hunan  was  40.3  km  per  100  km2  in  2004, \ncompared to the average of 51.6 km per 100 km2 for the eastern and coastal provinces. \n \nIn 2003, the PRC\u2019s vehicle fleet totaled 24 million trucks, cars, and buses, and 72 million \n2. \nother motorized vehicles. The privately owned fleet of motor vehicles increased from 0.3 million \nin 1985 to 12.0 million in 2003. Modernization of the vehicle fleet will improve vehicle safety and \nreduce  individual  vehicles\u2019  fuel  consumption  and  emissions.  In  2004,  Hunan  had  more  than \n43,000  bus  operators,  most  of  them  small,  private  operators  on  routes  shorter  than  150  km. \nAbout  72,000  buses  were  registered,  including  41,500  large  buses  with  a  total  capacity  of \n816,200  seats,  with  average  growth  of  5.2%  over  the  last  10  years.  Road  passenger  traffic  in \nHunan,  measured  in  terms  of  passenger-km,  grew  6.4%  per  year  between  1990  and  2004, \nslower than the national average of 8.6%. Road freight traffic, in ton-km, grew at 9.7% per year, \ncompared with 3.3% per year for the PRC as a whole.  \n \n3. \nThe Hunan Provincial Communications Department is responsible for regulating the road \ntransport  industry  in  Hunan  by  licensing  drivers,  vehicles,  and  intercity  bus  services.  Freight \ntransport is essentially deregulated; however, interprovincial bus routes require MOC approval. \nPrivate  operations  have  increased,  resulting  in  improved  transport  efficiency  and  quality  of \nservices and increased competition. Road transport tariffs are allowed within a range of plus or \nminus 20% of advisory tariffs set by the local government. This flexibility, coupled with ease of \nmarket  entry,  will  facilitate  the  passing  on  to  transport  users  of  cost  reductions  resulting  from \nimproved road conditions. \n \nExpenditures  for  highway  infrastructure  are  financed  from  dedicated  user  charges, \n4. \ngovernment  grants,  domestic  bank  loans  and  bonds,  and  foreign  loans  and  investments.  Two \ndedicated user charges, the road maintenance fee and the vehicle purchase fee, have provided \nmuch  of  the  financing  for  the  road  sector.  During  the  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan  (1996\u20132000),  the \nroad  maintenance  fee  and  vehicle  purchase  fee  provided  53%  and  13%,  respectively,  of  total \nroad investments. The vehicle purchase fee was replaced by the vehicle purchase tax in 2001.  \n \n5. \nRoad  projects  are  designed  by  planning  and  design  institutes  at  the  provincial, \nprefecture, and county levels. MOC reviews the designs of high-standard roads and associated \nstructures. Design institutes are staffed with well-qualified personnel. City and county highway \nbureaus have their own construction units to carry out minor projects within their administrative \ndistricts. Competitive bidding practices were mandated by the 1999 Tendering and Bidding Law. \nRoad maintenance is well organized and implemented by expressway companies and highway \nadministration bureaus.  \n \n6. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  has  been  undertaking  policy  dialogue  on  the  PRC  road \nsector  since  1991.  The  principal  issues  addressed  include  the  impact  of  road  projects  on \npoverty, highway design standards, construction quality, road safety, vehicle emissions, pricing \npolicies,  commercialization  and  corporatization,  and  nongovernment  financial  resources.

Jishou city, the capital \nof  Xiangxi  Autonomous  Prefecture,  but  less  so  along  the  local  road  component  in  poor, \nmountainous,  and  underdeveloped  areas  in  Baojing,  Guzhang,  Fenghuang,  and  Huayuan \ncounties. While there is a class II bus terminal in Jishou city, more than 80% of townships in the \narea do not have even class V rural bus stations. Further many villages and townships have no \ndirect access to bus service as operators are either reluctant to venture onto poor-quality roads \nor  are  not  permitted  to  do  so  for  safety  reasons.  Hunan  transport  administration  division  does \nnot issue licenses to operate bus routes on unsafe roads. \n \nIt is operators who propose new bus routes, and local transport administration divisions \n2. \ndo not undertake overall planning for the route network. The fares and routes of the formal bus \nsystem are regulated, which often results in inefficient services. Thus villagers have to rely on \ninformal  means  of  transport,  such  as  baby-taxis,  motorized\u2013tricycles,  and  dual-purpose \nvehicles. Because informal transport services of local operators are limited to the routes plying \nvillages  and  townships  and/or  local  markets,  it  has  limitation  to  replace  the  formal  transport \nsystem. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nIn  the  project  area,  although  trucks  and  buses  provide  services  to  villages,  the  cost  of \ntravel is high. The people in the area thus mostly rely on informal transport services to travel to a \ntown.  The  TA  survey  found  that  the average trip for  the  poor was longer than that  for the non-\npoor  because  villages  are  far  away  from  commercial  centers.  Such  trips  are  costly  for  the  poor \nand  hence  infrequent.  As  a  result,  the  poor  who  are  often  limited  to  walking  to  nearby  rotating \nvillage markets can sell their produce up to the amount that they can carry on their backs, or sell \nit  to  four-wheel  drive-in  traders  who  benefit  through  a  buyer\u2019s  market  situation.  Likewise,  the \npoor are comparatively limited in traveling to buy farming inputs.  \n \nMost trips cover short distances: approximately 60% of all trips are to the nearest town \n4. \nand 33% are within the township. Trips to the county town are rare, with the average household \nmaking only 12 trips per year and the poorest group making less than two trips. The demand for \nlong-distance  travel  is  limited  to  migrant  workers,  who  are  employed  in  the  coastal  provinces \nand  return  home  once  a  year.  Most  trips  are  for  buying  necessities,  while  only  16%  are  for \nagricultural marketing. Walking and bicycling are the major modes of transport for short-distance \ntrips. As distance increases, so does the number of motorized trips: almost no trips are made on \nfoot  when  the  distance  exceeds  6  kilometers.  Indeed,  even  for  extremely  short  journeys,  a \nsignificant proportion of the population uses motorized transport. Vehicle ownership is low in the \nproject area. According to the survey, the non-poor own an average of three vehicles per 100 \nhouseholds compared with none for both the poor and absolute poor. The non-poor also own an \naverage of eight motorcycles per 100 households, compared with four for the poor. \n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe area\u2019s inadequate and insufficient transport services are highly correlated with poor \nroad  conditions  in  the  area.  The  TA  survey  revealed  that  transport  services  are  more \nextensively available in areas with better roads, which makes travel to markets or social facilities \neasier and undertaken more frequently. In Jishou, where the road network is in better condition \nthan  in  other  places  in  the  project  area,  transport  services  are  relatively  well  developed.  This \n\nTransport Services and Road Condition \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nimplied that transport services improve with the improvement of the road network. The operators \nwho were interviewed confirmed their willingness to extend transport services where this would \nbe profitable, and villagers who have experienced road upgrading have also confirmed that bus \nservices were indeed extended after a road was upgraded. When roads are upgraded, transport \nservices improve shortly thereafter and the frequency of villagers\u2019 trips to local markets, nearby \ntownships,  and  towns  increases  significantly.  The  village  survey  also  confirmed  a  close  link \nbetween road access and the quality of transport service.  \n \n6. \nThe villagers surveyed said that when roads were improved the quality of service did get \nbetter, while official fares and trucking rates did not decrease since licensed bus operators were \noften  constrained  in  setting  fares.  In  many  cases,  on  the  other  hand,  informal  transport  fares \nwent  down.  The  informal  operators  are  based  in  townships  and  villages,  and  their  fares  are \nusually negotiable, tending to decrease when roads are improved.  \n \n7. \nThe responses to the survey did not cite unaffordable transport services and insufficient \ncredit  as  serious  obstacles  to  changes  in  agricultural  practices  and  a  shift  to  nonagricultural \nbusinesses.  Indeed,  even  the  poor  use  vehicular  transport  for  30%  of  their  trips.  They  viewed \npoor roads to be a key reason for inadequate and expensive transport services and infrequent \nvisits from extension officers, veterinarians, health workers, and public servants. Thus improved \nlocal  roads will  thus  spur  both  formal  and  informal  transport  service  providers  to  render  better \ntransport services.  \n \n8. \nThe demand for travel also increases significantly with improved roads mainly because \nof upgraded transport services, which eventually helps raise rural incomes and reduce poverty. \nThe  village  survey  indicated  that  the  average  number  of  trips  in  such  areas  is  higher  than  in \nareas with less developed roads. \n \n9. \nThe  interviews  with  villagers  and  county  officials  suggest  that  rural  poor  farmers  who \nrarely use roads also benefit from improved transport services by way of higher farm-gate prices \nfor  their  cash  crops  and  more  frequent  visits  from  extension  and  health  personnel  and  public \nservants and officials.   \n \nD. \n \n10. \nExpanding access to transport services is an integral part of Hunan\u2019s plan for transport \nservices.  Xiangxi  Autonomous  Prefecture,1 where  the  Project  is  located, has  only  one  class  II \nbus  terminal  in  Jishou  city,  and  more  than  80%  of  townships  do  not  have  even  rural  bus \nstations.  To  enhance  the  sustainable  delivery  of  transport  services,  the  prefecture  has \nimplemented  a  plan  to  construct  class  I\u2013IV  bus  terminals. 2 A  class  I  bus  terminal  is  being \nconstructed  in  Jishou  and  is  scheduled  to  open  in  2006.  The  construction  of  class  II  bus \nterminals in five counties is also under way and at least one class II bus terminal will be built in \neach of the three remaining counties during the period of the 11th FYP. The prefecture aims to \nbuild  a  class  V  rural  bus  station in each  village  by  2015,  15  of  which will  be  completed  in  the \nproject  area  by  2007.  HCD  agreed  to  implement  these  facilities  in  tandem  with  the  Project  to \nensure the efficient provision of transport services when the project roads have been built. \n \n \n\nEfforts to Expand the Provision of Transport Services \n\n                                                 \n1  The prefecture comprises 8 counties, 218 townships, and 2,664 villages. \n2  A bus terminal is classified according to its daily passenger handling capacity. A class I terminal handles more than \n10,000  passengers  per  day,  a  class  II  terminal  handles  5,000  to  10,000  passengers,  and  a  class  V  terminal \nhandles up to 500 passengers. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \n\nAppendix 5\n\n33\n\n \n\nSMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IN THE PROJECT AREA \n\n \n1. \nThe basic parameters for small business development are in place in the project area: \nliteracy  is  reasonably  high;  even  though  most  people  are  engaged  in  farming,  a  labor  force  is \nalso available for commercially-oriented nonfarm activities;1 and secondary and tertiary markets \nexist.  Microfinance  schemes  are  in  place  for  supporting  small  businesses  under  provincial \npoverty  programs  or  minority  development  programs.  Various  poverty  reduction  projects  also \nsupport  the  development  of  small  businesses,  including  two  externally  funded  projects,  one \nfunded  by  the  World  Food  Programme  and  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development\u2019s \nAgricultural  Development  Project  and  one  by  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation\u2019s \nPoverty  Reduction  Project.  The  existing  programs  complement  each  other  and  will  provide  a \ngood  basis  for  promoting  small  business  development  in  the  area  through  their  focus  on \nagricultural  diversification  for  commercial  purposes,  construction  of  market  facilities,  and  skills \nfor self-employment. \n \n2. \nSmall  businesses  are  fairly  active  in  the  project  area.  With  improved  roads,  existing \nenterprises are  expected  to  further  expand  their  businesses.  Each  kilometer  of  road  averages \nfour  businesses,  and  one  of  the  local  roads  under  the  Project  has  about  six  businesses  per \nkilometer. A wide assortment of businesses has been established that provide basic necessities \nfor local communities and travelers. The technical assistance (TA) survey shows that the trend \nevinces  an  inherent  entrepreneurial  spirit  among  local  residents  who,  if  given  the  opportunity, \nare likely to set up commercial enterprises. A number of factories are located along NR319, an \nindication  that  the  proposed  expressway  may  attract  larger  commercial  establishments  to  the \nvicinity. \n \n3. \nSmall businesses could focus on the following areas: (i) agriculture and agro-industry, (ii) \nherbal medicines and handicrafts; (iii) community-based tourism, eco-tourism, and cultural and \nheritage tourism based on the traditions of the ethnic minorities; (iv) service industries, such as \nservices  for  through  traffic;  and  (v)  community-based  distribution  facilities  and  transport \nsystems.  The  TA  survey  indicate  that  inadequate  road  infrastructure  has  been  one  of  major \nbarriers to developing small businesses in the area. \n \nDuring  the    TA,  a  strategy  was  prepared  to  develop  small  businesses  and  commercial \n4. \nactivities that includes (i) developing community-based enterprises such as gas stations, niche \nfarming,  eco-tourism  and  community-based  tourism,  herbal  and  homeopathic  medicines, \nhandicraft  centers,  hostels,  and  restaurants;  (ii)  building  roadside  stations  as  focal  points  for \nsmall  business  development;  (iii)  creating  economic  zones  specifically  targeting  small \nbusinesses,  which  require  government  interventions  to,  for  example,  locate  and  group  similar \ntypes  of  businesses;  and  (iv)  creating  an  ethnic  minority  cultural  zone,  which  would  give  local \ncommunities opportunities to display their cultures and traditions in a designated area as well as \nallow them to develop their entrepreneurial activities. \n \n5. \nThe  TA  also  indicated  that  assistance  is  needed  to  channel  local  people  into  potential \nareas  of  business  and  commercial  opportunities,  such  as  entrepreneurial  training  that  would \nmake  investments  attractive.  The  Hunan  Communications  Provincial  Department  has  ensured \nthat such assistance will be provided through provincial poverty reduction programs. \n\n                                                 \n1 Underemployment is significant during the nonfarm season. \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nROAD SAFETY AND VEHICLE EMISSIONS \n\n \n1. \nImplementation of the Government's economic reform policies since 1978 has resulted \nin  rapid  economic  growth  and  a  persistent  increase  of  the  number  of  vehicles.  The  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China will continue to experience a high rate of motor vehicle growth for many years \nto come. As such, the country is facing increasingly serious road safety and vehicle emissions \nproblems, which inhibit economic and social development given their association with millions of \npremature  deaths  and  injuries,  high  medical  costs,  strain  on  welfare  services,  and  reduced \nproductivity.  Many  of  the  problems  encountered  with  road  safety  and  vehicle  emissions  are \npredominantly  institutional  in  nature,  resulting  from  fragmentation  of  responsibility,  lack  of \ninterdepartmental  coordination,  inadequate  data  systems  and  monitoring,  inadequate  action \nplans  and  integrated  strategies,  inadequate  enforcement  and  legislation,  lack  of  road  safety \naudits  and  accident  black  spot  programs,  weak  vehicle  inspection  systems,  and  shortages  of \nskilled staff and resources.   \n \nA. \n\nRoad Safety \n\n2. \nAccident rates in the People\u2019s Republic of China are high compared with those in highly \nmotorized countries and in many other developing countries. Road accidents and their resultant \neconomic losses represent a substantial problem and require urgent attention by the authorities. \nAccording  to  national  statistics,1 in  2004  road  traffic  accidents  resulted  in  107,077  deaths  and \n460,864  injuries,  with  costs  equivalent  to  1\u20133%  of  gross  domestic  product.  In  Hunan  in  2004, \nthere were 16,116 accidents that killed 3,825 people and injured 18,377. To address the issue \nof  road  safety,  the  Ministry  of  Public  Security  prepared  the  2004  Road  Safety  Action  Plan, \nwhose  primary  aims  are  to  (i)  reduce  serious  accidents  (involving  more  than  10  fatalities),  (ii) \neliminate  major  accidents  (involving  30  or  more  fatalities),  and  (iii)  facilitate  implementation  of \nthe  2004  Road  Safety  Law.  This  is  to  be  achieved  through  improved  vehicle  safety,  driver \ntraining,  and  improved  traffic  management.  In  Hunan,  the  traffic  police,  which  fall  under  the \nauspices  of  the  Hunan  Public  Security  Bureau,  are  responsible  for  promoting  road  safety, \nenforcing traffic laws, and identifying preventive measures and accident black spots. This work \nis  coordinated  with  the  Hunan  Provincial  Communications  Department  (HCD)  to  consolidate \ninteragency efforts.  \n \n3. \nSafety is one of the major factors that must be taken into consideration, along with, for \nexample,  mobility  and  economic  and  environmental  impacts,  in  order  to  achieve  balanced \ndesign  standards  for  roads.  The  design  of  the  expressway  was  chosen  to  ensure  that  posted \n(legal)  speed  limits  are  attainable  with  an  adequate  margin  of  safety.  In  this  respect,  careful \nattention  was  given  to  the  design  of  super-elevation  on  curves,  overtaking  and  curve  sight \ndistances, deceleration lanes at interchanges and service areas, and adequate road camber to \nensure that surface water runs off the road surface during heavy rainfalls.  \n \n4. \nControlling  the  overloading  of  vehicles  is  essential.  With  heavily  loaded  vehicles,  road \nsafety is affected because of the higher demands placed on vehicles\u2019 braking systems, chassis \nstrength,  and  flexibility;  vehicles\u2019  stability  when  rounding  curves;  and  steering  difficulties \nresulting from heavy rear-end loads reducing front-end weight, road contact, and friction with the \nroad  surface.  HCD  will  monitor  operations  in  relation  to  overloaded  vehicles  and  impose \nsufficient penalties on offenders to help reduce the risk of traffic accidents, pavement damage, \nand  maintenance  costs.  An  efficient  penalty  system  will  be  in  place  to  discourage  operators \nfrom  overloading.  Typical  penalties  could  include  (i)  the  suspension  of  operators\u2019  driver\u2019s \n\n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Public Security. 2004 accidents statistics.  \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n35\n\nlicenses,  (ii)  the  suspension  of  operators\u2019  goods  licenses,  (iii)  a  large  fine,  and  (iv)  the \nrequirement  that  operators  unload  their  vehicles  and  reload  only  to  the  allowable  weight  limit. \nHCD  is  currently  using  the  Handbook  for  Road  Safety  Audits2,  which  was  developed  under \nWorld  Bank  Highway  Project  in  2000.  All  road  design  and  operation  processes  are  subject  to \nthis road safety audit. Construction of the proposed expressway to a high standard will reduce \naccidents in the Jishou\u2013Chadong corridor. \n \n5. \nAn  interdepartmental  framework  will  be  established  under  the  Project  to  enhance  road \nsafety in the project area. While HCD will concentrate on engineering, road safety audits, black \nspot  improvement,  and  operational  issues  pertaining  to  the  expressway,  the  Hunan  Public \nSecurity Bureau will deal with traffic law enforcement issues to create safer roads.  \n \nHCD  will  help  develop  a  comprehensive  road  safety  strategy  in  the  project  area  in \n6. \ncollaboration  with  the  international  road  safety  specialist.  The  strategy  will  seek  to  promote \ninnovative ways to improve road safety by means of the following broadly based approach: (i) \ninstitutional  strengthening  to  strengthen  the  provincial  road  safety  committee,  develop \ncomprehensive  action  programs,  promote  awareness,  set  effective  targets,  and  undertake \nmonitoring;  (ii)  capacity  building  and  human  resources  development  to  set  up  an  efficient  and \nuniform  database  and  upgrade  skills  and  knowledge;  (iii)  coordination  to  develop  black  spot \nprograms,  undertake  accident  prevention  measures,  foster  the  dissemination  of  knowledge \nabout best practices, and set common targets and time frames; and (iv) promotion of effective \ncooperation  among  government  and  nongovernment  organizations,  the  private  sector,  and \ncommunity groups. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nMotor vehicle emissions are increasingly contributing to air pollution. The Government is \ntaking  significant  measures  to  control  emissions  by  regulating  the  automobile  industry  and \nenforcing an annual vehicle test and inspection and maintenance program. The new measures \nalso set emissions and fuel efficiency targets and offer tax incentives for manufacturers of more \nenvironment-friendly  cars.  One  aim  is  to  reduce  average  fuel  consumption  by  15  percentage \npoints  between  2003  and  2010.  Hunan  is  developing  alternative  fuels  that  could  help  reduce \npetroleum  imports.  A  300,000  ton  per  year  ethanol  plant  has  been  proposed  in  Changde  that \nwould  use  corn  and  other  grains  as  feedstock.  The  Sichuan\u2013Hunan  gas  pipeline  project  is \ncurrently under construction. Natural gas will be provided for power generation, industrial fuel, \ncommercial and residential users, and transport. HCD and the Hunan Environmental Protection \nBureau (HEPB) are working on a plan to control vehicle emissions.  Implementing such a plan \nwill require the cooperation of a number of agencies, jurisdictions, and the community as well as \ngovernment  commitment.  At  least  6  months  prior  to  the  opening  of  the  expressway,  HCD  will \nprovide ADB with the latest government plan to improve air quality in Hunan, including cleaner \nfuel programs. With the assistance of consultants, HCD and HEPB will develop an action plan to \ncontrol vehicle emissions in the area and implement it accordingly. \n \n8. \nThe Project will have positive impacts on air pollution, as emissions from vehicles along \nthe project roads are expected to be lower because of better traffic flows as a result of improved \nroad conditions. Upon completion of the Project, sulfur dioxide emissions from vehicles on the \nproject roads are estimated to be 20% lower than before the Project. Likewise, nitrogen oxides \nemissions will be 12% lower than before the Project and carbon dioxide emissions will be 20% \nlower. \n\nVehicle Emissions \n\n                                                 \n2  ISBN 7-114-03743-0 published in October 2000. \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nLOCAL ROAD MAINTENANCE \n\nStatus \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nHunan  Provincial  Highways  Administration  Bureau  (HHAB)  is  responsible  for  the \nfrom \nmanagement,  construction, \nimprovement,  and  maintenance  of  all \nexpressways. For national, provincial and county roads (up to Class II highways), HHAB carries \nout maintenance of the roads. However, for county (Class III highways and below) and township \nroads,  HHAB  delegates  maintenance  to  county  and  township  authorities:  for  county  and \ntownship roads the county is responsible for maintenance, while for town and village roads the \nlocal traffic administration bureau is responsible. \n\nroads  apart \n\n \n2. \nAlthough  general  administration  of  the  local  road  network  remains  with  Xiangxi \nPrefecture,  maintenance  and  management  of  the  road  network  is  the  responsibility  of  the \ncounties within the prefecture. Most road maintenance funds are used to maintain roads that are \nclass III or above. Maintenance of unclassified roads (72% of the network) is carried out by local \npeople  using  their  own  resources.  Counties  finance  about  50%  of  their  road  maintenance \nrequirements.  In  the  prefecture,  there  are  approximately  9,575  kilometers  (km)  of  roads,  of \nwhich 6,900 km are unclassified.1 About 298 staff are involved in maintenance, and 759 farmers \nare  paid  CNY150  per  month  for  part-time  maintenance  work.  About  4,790  km  of  roads  are \nmaintained by counties, one third of which are maintained regularly (Table A7.1). \n \n\nRoad Access \n2,664 \nadministrative \nvillages  \n\nTable A7.1: Basic Data \n\nRoad Length \n\u2022  9,575 km including \n6,900 km of \nunclassified roads \n\u2022  524 bridges \n\nFunding \n\n\u2022  Classified roads:  \nfunded by counties  \n\u2022  Unclassified roads: \nfunded by local people  \n\nRoad Condition \nPoor \n \n\n \n\u2022  Xiangxi Prefecture \n(8 counties, 218 \ntownships) \n\u2022  Staff: 298 staff and \n759 part-time workers  \n\nKm = kilometer. \nSource: TA consultants estimates. \n\n \n3. \nA  local  road  component,  comprising  two  sections  totalling  129  km,  was  integrated  into \nthe  Project  to  expand  the  road  network  into  rural  villages  inhabited  by  ethnic  minority  groups. \nConditions of the two local roads vary from poor to bad, and only minimal maintenance is being \ncarried out (Tables A7.2 and A7.3). \n \n\nTable A7.2: Road Condition of the Local Roads \n\nRoad \n\nFrom \n\nTo \n\nFenghuang \nXiatuo \nQianxi  \nQianling \nSource: TA consultants estimates. \n \n\nSurface \nType \n\nCondition\n\nMalichang \nHexi \n\nGravel \nGravel \n\nPoor \nPoor \n\nExisting \nClass \nIV \nIV \n\nProposed \nClass \nIV \nIII \n\nTable A7.3: Users of the Local Road Sections \n\nRoad \n\nXiatuo \n\nQianxi \n\nLength \n(km) \n86.40 \n\nNo. of Townships \nServed \n9 \n\nPopulation \nServed \n137,000 \n\nRural % \n\nMinority % \n\nPoor % \n(<900 Yuan)\n33.5 \n\n32.2 \n\n \n\n65 \n\n75 \n\n \n\n84 \n\n81 \n\n54 \n\nPop/km Includes \n(side road) \n1,584 \n\n2,045 \n\n873 \n\n88,000 \n\n225,000 \n\n43.03 \n\n7 \n\nTotal \n\n16 \n129.44 \nKm = kilometer, Pop = population. \nSource: TA consultants estimates. \n\n                                                 \n1   Paved  roads  total  2,310  km,  of  which  33  km  have  high  grade  pavement  (cement  concrete);  89  km,  asphalt;  and \n\n1,708 km, sand gravel. \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n37\n\nIssues and Problems \n\nB. \n \n4. \nAdequate  maintenance  is  crucial  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  rural  roads.  Local \nadministrative units are responsible for such maintenance but the quality of rural roads does not \nseem  to  be  systematically  monitored  by  the  higher  authorities.  There  is  no  comprehensive \nplanning  for  rehabilitation.  Maintenance  planning  often  hinges  on  a  subjective  assessment, \nmainly because of the local government\u2019s inability to maintain its road networks because of lack \nof  resources.  Between  counties,  there  seems  to  be  little  cross-dissemination  of  knowledge  to \nmeasure performance. While local authorities draft plans for routine maintenance work, periodic \nmaintenance is rather budget-driven and lacks a systematic, preventive approach.  \n \n5. \nThere is no official funding channel for the maintenance of township or village roads or \nsystem  to  enable  provincial  or  central  government  to  fund  the  development  of  rural  roads.  A \nreliable funding mechanism for maintaining and rehabilitating rural roads must be designed, with \nattractive  incentives  (including  financial  incentives)  to  help  local  governments  to  maintain  their \nroads. Since funds for maintenance are limited, a simple evaluation and prioritization method for \nmaintenance  work  must  also  be  established  to  streamline  work  programming  and  make  the \nmost effective use of funds. \n \n6. \nApart  from  financial  constraints,  local  governments\u2019  maintenance  efforts  are  often \nhampered  by  a  lack  of  qualified  technical  and  managerial  personnel,  training  resources,  and \nequipment.  Local  governments  must  develop  a  capacity  to  contract  out  road  maintenance.  In \ntandem,  start-up  assistance  must  be  extended  to  local  road  maintenance  contractors  in  rural \nareas,  and  ways  to  generate  employment  for  the  rural  poor  must  be  identified.  A  suitable \nperformance monitoring system must be put in place. \n \nC. \n \n7. \nDuring  project  preparation,  an  action  plan  (Table  A7.4)  was  established  to  strengthen \nlocal  road  maintenance.  The  action  plan  was  agreed  with  Hunan  Provincial  Communications \nDepartment  (HCD).  Following  the  plan,  HCD  will  develop  and  implement  a  sound  road \nmaintenance  management  system  during  project  implementation.  The  system  will  have  (i) \nmeasures \nthat  minimize  maintenance  costs;  (ii) a  modern  method  of  evaluation  and \nmaintenance  prioritization  for  efficient  work  programming  and  fund  use;  (iii)  a  compilation  of \nroad  inventories,  together  with  basic  data  on  the  condition  of  the  roads;  and  (iv)  a  monitoring \nsystem  to  be  used  by  local  residents.  HCD  will  encourage  county  governments  to  adopt \ncompetitive bidding among maintenance contractors to enhance efficiency. A training program \nwill be provided under the Project to strengthen the capacity of local government maintenance \nunits. \n \n\nRecommendation \n\nActivity  \nClassified Roads \n \n\nBridges \nUnclassified Roads \n \nCapacity Building \n\nTable A7.4: Action Plan \n\nRequirements  \nDevelop a functional classification for the road system \nDetermine the importance of each road in the overall road network \nEstablish a road condition system \nDevelop road maintenance work priorities \nAssign a cost for each activity and define overall cost \nCarry out the same process for the maintenance of bridges \nProvide basic funding and technical advice to help maintenance of unclassified roads \nProvide basic materials to the small communities  \nAssign  the  Communications  College  to  carry  out  capacity  building  and  on-going \ntraining to enhance local capacity \nOptimize the maintenance fund, and ensure the sustainability of the road networks \n\nFund \nSource: TA consultants estimates. \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nINTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEM AND ASSET MANAGEMENT \n\nIntelligent Transport System \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  intelligent  transport  system  (ITS)  is  a  term  that  is  widely  used  to  refer  to  a  wide \n1. \nrange of technological solutions applied to the transport sector to optimize safety and efficiency. \nThe  solutions  include  safety  and  traveler  information,  enforcement,  monitoring,  and  toll  and \nrevenue  collection.

Better road infrastructure and services will encourage villagers to \ngo  to  markets,  use  educational  and  health  facilities  more  frequently,  and  avail  themselves  of \nincreased  agricultural  extension  services.  These  benefits,  which  accrue  directly  to  road  users, \nare the Project\u2019s direct effects. \n \n2. \nOver  time,  improved  road  access  will  expand  economic  activities  in  the  area  and \ngradually  lead  to  structural  changes  in  production  and  consumption  patterns  and  in  the  labor \nmarket. Lower transport costs reduce the costs of traded farm inputs, thereby raising agricultural \nproductivity  and  profitability.  Cropping  patterns  change  with  better  roads,  as  farmers  shift  to \nhigher-value  crops  because  of  easier  access  to  markets  and  new  farming  technologies.  Road \nimprovement  helps  increase  nonfarm  job  opportunities  and  the  potential  for  increased  wages. \nBetter  roads  reduce  transaction  time  and  costs,  thereby  spurring  commercial  activities.  In  turn, \nhigher incomes boost local people\u2019s demand for transport and the movement of local goods and \nservices. These are the benefits that trickle down to local people over time. Even the rural poor \nwho rarely  use roads also benefit from improved roads through more  and cheaper goods and \nservices and increased economic opportunities. These are the Project\u2019s indirect effects.  \n \nB. \n \nBased on the findings of an ADB technical assistance, a standard monitoring framework \n3. \nand a set of monitoring indicators were designed to measure the actual benefits definitely (Table \nA13.1).  These  indicators  were  chosen  in  a  way  to  assess  the  hypothesized  flow  of  project \nbenefits (paras. 1\u20132). \n \n\nMonitoring Framework \n\nTable A13.1: Monitoring Framework: Indicators and Mechanism \n \n\nMonitoring Indicators \n\nTravel time to county center \n\nTiming of Benefits or Outcomes \nA.

Because  this  pilot \napproach  will  greatly  narrow  down  the  scope  of  monitoring,  local  authorities  are  expected  to \nundertake adequate monitoring more readily. During project preparation, three villages in three \ntownships  in  Huayuan  county  were  selected  as  the  pilot  sites:  Shaping  village  (Malichang \ntownship), Jisi village (Jiwei township), and Nongke village (Daheping). \n \nC. \n \nthe \nThe  Hunan  Provincial  Communications  Department  (HCD)  concurred  with \n5. \nmonitoring framework and the set of indicators for monitoring the Project\u2019s performance. During \nproject preparation, the baseline values for the indicators were specified to the extent available \n(Table  A13.2)  and  will  be  further  updated  by  HCD,  where  necessary.  HCD  and  local \ngovernments have ensured that monitoring in the selected communities will be adequate.

It  connects  cities  of \nJishou and Chadong in west Hunan with Changsha (capital of Hunan) to the east, Hubei to the \nnorth, Chongqing Municipality and Sichuan to the north-west and Guizhou to the west. With the \ncompletion of this Project, the Changsha-Chongqing corridor will become a major artery for the \nregional  transport  network,  connecting  with  national  and  provincial  roads.  The  project \nexpressway  will  be  built  in  parallel  to  national  road  (NR319),  a  combination  of  class  II,  III,  IV \nroads. NR 319 has pavement in poor condition over roughly 60% of its length with steep slopes \nand  sharp  turns,  and  suffers  from  frequent  flooding  and  intrusions  by  nonmotorized  traffic. \nCongestion  along  NR  319  is  a  daily  phenomenon  due  to  booming  mining  and  agricultural \nprocessing industries. Two local roads are the 86 km Xiatou section in Huayaun county and the \n43  km  Qianxi  section  in  Baojing  county.  The  Xiatuo  section,  a  major  north-south  road  in  rural \nareas  with  heavy  traffic  and  commercial  activities,  will  connect  an  interchange  of  the  project \nexpressway.  The  Qianxi  section,  through  NR  209,  provides  a  short-cut  from  the  mining  and \nindustrial areas in Baojing and Huayuan counties to a railway station in Guzhang county. \n \n2. \nTraffic  count  surveys  were  undertaken  in  December  2004  during  the  TA  for  both  the \nexpressway  and  local  roads  components  to  refine  the  origin-destination  (O-D)  surveys  carried \nout in 2002 under the feasibility study. Forty eight-hour classified traffic counts were done at key \nlocations along the NR319 and the two local roads. Forecast passenger and freight vehicle O-D \nmatrices  for  several  years  were  developed  from  the  2004  base  year  matrices  by  applying \nprojections of gross domestic product (GDP) and estimated elasticities of transport demand with \nrespect to GDP growth. In the first few years, trips are predicted to grow at around 9%. \n \n3. \nBased  on  forecast  economic  growth  in  the  project  area  as  well  as  historical  trends  in \ntraffic  growth,  the  traffic  projections  were  developed  which  also  take  account  of  potential \ngenerated  and  diverted  traffic  as  a  result  of:  (i)  the  additional  traffic  generated  by  the  Project \nthrough  enhanced  development  opportunities;  (ii)  traffic  diverted  from  the  rail  network  in  the \nproject  area;  and  (iii)  potential  diversion  of  traffic  as  a  result  of  tolling  of  the  expressway.  A \nproportion of diverted traffic from railway was assumed at 1% for passenger and 2% for freight. \n \nThe  Project  will  increase  the  corridor\u2019s  capacity  to  meet  the  demand  for  transport  and \n4. \nwill  reduce  transport  costs,  travel  times,  and  accident  rates.  It  will  provide  employment \nopportunities  both  during  the  construction  period  and  thereafter  and  will  be  a  conduit  for \nincreased economic growth and improved incomes. The local roads component will help ensure \nthat these benefits reach the poorest communities. Traffic on the expressway is forecast to grow \nfrom  6,000  to  12,650  average  annual  daily  traffic  in  2010,  when  the  expressway  will  open,  to \n11,500  to  14,000  in  2019  and  17,000  to  21,350  by  2029.  On  the  project  local  roads,  traffic  is \nforecast to grow from between 1,600 and 2,000 average annual daily traffic in 2010 to 2,500 to \n3,000 in 2019 and 3,900 to 4,200 in 2029 (Table A14).  \n \n\nTable A14: Traffic Forecast, Average Annual Daily Traffic, Selected Years \n\n \n\nYear \n2009 \n2014 \n2019 \n2024 \n2029 \n\nExpressway \n6,000 \n8,527 \n12,645 \n16,743 \n21,345 \n\nSources: Feasibility Study and TA consultants estimates. \n\nNR319 \n2,392 \n2,643 \n2,904 \n3,547 \n4,317 \n\n \n\nLocal Road 1 \n1,970 \n2,305 \n2,941 \n3,578 \n4,148 \n\nLocal Road 2 \n1,603 \n1,875 \n2,509 \n3,203 \n3,896 \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n47\n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\n \n1. \nThe  proposed  project  comprises  a  64-kilometer  (km),  access  controlled  expressway \nbetween Jishou and Chadong and the upgrading of two local roads. The two local roads are key \nlocal roads that connect villages with village roads, many of which have already been upgraded. \nThe  Xiatuo  section,  an  86  km  south\u2013north  route  running  from  Fenghuang  county  to  Huayuan \ncounty, will be linked directly with the project expressway. The other one, the Qianxi section, a \n43  km  east-west  route,  will  provide  a  shorter  route  from  the  mining  and  industrial  areas  in \nHuayuan  and  Baojing  to  the  railway  station  in  Guzhang.  The  Project  is  located  in  Xiangxi \nAutonomous Prefecture, which has a population of 2.6 million. The Zhiliu railway traverses five \nof  the  prefecture\u2019s  counties  and  Jishou  city,  an  important  goods  collection  and  distribution \ncenter. The prefecture is rich in water resources, mineral deposits, coal reserves, fertile soil, and \ntourism  potential.  Reserves  of  barium,  manganese,  coal,  limestone,  gypsum,  and  dolomite \nstimulate  the  development  of  ancillary  industries.  There  are  also  significant  prospects  for  the \ndevelopment of food processing, herbal medicine manufacturing, and mushroom production. \n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  4  years.  The  economic  analysis  covers  the \n2. \nfollowing  20  years  of  full  operation.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  the  project \nexpressway  was  estimated  by  comparing  the  project  case  with  a  base  case  involving  the \ncontinued  use  and  maintenance  of  the  existing  road,  NR319.  Without  the  Project,  congestion \nlevels  would  increase,  causing  delays  and  increasing  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs),  and \naccident  rates  would  rise.  The  Project,  with  its  reduced  travel  distance  and  travel  time,  safer \ndesign, and better road conditions, will reduce VOCs and accident risks along the corridor. \n \nEconomic evaluation was undertaken using 2005 prices. The prices were expressed in \n3. \nyuan using the domestic price numeraire with a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.01 for foreign \nexchange  effects.  A  shadow  price  was  used  to  put  an  economic  value  on  the  wages  paid  to \nunskilled  labor,  but  not  on  the  wages  paid  to  skilled  labor,  because  no  skilled  worker  surplus \nexists.  A  shadow  wage  rate  factor  of  0.67  was  used  to  convert  the  financial  wage  rate  to  an \neconomic  opportunity  cost  of  labor.  The  economic  costs  include  (i)  the  capital  cost,  including \nphysical  contingencies,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  environmental  mitigation  costs; \nand (ii) the costs of operating and maintaining the expressway, including the costs of replacing \ndepreciated  equipment.  The  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs  were  based  on  their \nopportunity costs, that is, the agricultural output forgone and the re-siting of displaced activities.1 \n \n4. \nThe  economic  benefits  include  (i)  savings  in  VOCs  resulting  from  the  reduced  travel \ndistance  and  improved  road  conditions,  (ii)  savings  in  the  value  of  passengers\u2019  time  and  of \nfreight  tied  up  in  transit,  (iii)  savings  resulting  from  fewer  accidents,  and  (iv)  value-added  of \ntourism in the project area that is attributable to the Project. The last item was measured as the \nbenefits generated from the development of tourism by comparing the with project situation to \nthe without project situation. Reduced VOCs are the main source of economic benefits for the \nProject. The expressway shortens the route by about 30 km. Traffic using the expressway would \nenjoy  higher  speeds  on  a  smoother  road  with  better  vertical  and  horizontal  alignment,  less \ncongestion,  and  a  shorter  journey  distance.  Traffic  remaining  on  the  alternative  NR319  route \nwould  also  benefit  from  a  reduction  in  traffic  volume  and  congestion.  All  these  changes  affect \nvehicle  speeds  and  VOCs,  which  were  estimated  for  all  types  of  vehicles  likely  to  use  the \ncorridor.  For  savings  in  VOCs,  estimates  were  assessed  for  both  motorized  transport  and \ninformal  means  of  motorized  transport  (such  as  motorcycles,  tractors,  and  3-wheel  vehicles). \nSavings  in  travel  time  will  occur  both  on  the  project  expressway  and  existing  roads.  Work-\n\n                                                 \n1  The  economic  opportunity  costs  of  land  were  assumed  to  be  equivalent  to  the  replacement  value  of  farmland, \nwhich was calculated for land compensation. No additional opportunity cost for land was assumed, because all the \nland is in rural areas. \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nrelated  travel  time  was  evaluated  for  private  vehicles  and  buses.  The  economic  cost  of \naccidents was estimated in terms of direct property damage and forgone income. The EIRR for \nthe  expressway  component  is  estimated  at  17.7%,  indicating  that  the  Project  is  economically \nviable, with a net present value of CNY1.7 billion. \n \nThe costs of the local component include capital costs and operation and maintenance \n5. \ncosts.  The  economic  benefits  include  (i)  savings  in  VOCs  resulting  from  the  reduced  travel \ndistance  and  improved  road  conditions,  (ii)  savings  in  the  value  of  passengers\u2019  time  and  of \nfreight  tied  up  in  transit,  (iii)  savings  resulting  from  fewer  accidents,  and  (iv)  value-added  of \ntourism  that  is  attributable  to  the  Project.  Transport  cost  savings  will  accrue  to  traffic  on  the \nimproved roads through VOCs. The two local roads have a combined EIRR of 21.0% per year, \nwith a net present value of CNY140 million. \n \nBased on the combined economic cash flows during 2011\u20132030, the Project as a whole \n6. \ngenerates  an  EIRR  of  19.1%  with  a  net  present  value  of  CNY2.2  billion,  indicating  that  it  is \neconomically  viable.  The  savings  in  VOCs  from  the  expressway  top  the  list  of  benefits, \naccounting  for  82%,  followed  by  accident  cost  savings  (9%).  The  benefits  of  the  local  roads, \nwhile important to the villages concerned, account for 7.6% of the total benefits (Table A15.1). \n \n7. \nThe  results  of  sensitivity  analysis  confirm  the  robustness  of  the  Project\u2019s  economic \nviability:  changes  in  the  key  variables\u2014construction  costs,  benefits,  and  a  1-year  delay  in \nproject  completion\u2014do  not  significantly  affect  its  economic  viability.  The  sensitivity  analysis \nindicates  that  even  with  a  30%  increase  in  project  costs,  the  EIRR  remains  comfortable  at \n15.6%. When benefits decrease by 20%, costs increase by 20% in parallel with a 1-year delay, \nthe EIRR falls near to the cutoff rate of 12% (Table A15.2). \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n49\n\nTable A15.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return, 2007\u20132030  \n(constant 2005 economic prices, domestic price numeraire, CNY million)  \n \n\nCivil \nWorks \n652.8 \n783.3 \n783.3 \n391.7 \n\n \nOthera \n409.8 \n151.0 \n155.6 \n0.8 \n\nCost \n \nO&M \n  \n  \n  \n\nVOC \nSavings \n \n \n \n\nTime \nSavings \n \n \n \n\nBenefits \n\nAccident \nSavings \n  \n  \n  \n\n \nOther \n  \n  \n  \n\nLocal \nRoads \n40.4 \n54.2 \n54.2 \n12.6 \n0.8 \n0.8 \n0.8 \n0.8 \n0.8 \n0.8 \n0.8 \n0.8 \n0.8 \n0.8 \n0.8 \n0.9 \n0.9 \n0.9 \n0.9 \n0.9 \n0.9 \n0.9 \n0.9 \n\n  \n8.3 \n8.4 \n8.5 \n8.5 \n8.6 \n8.7 \n8.8 \n31.9 \n9.0 \n9.1 \n9.3 \n9.5 \n9.7 \n9.9 \n10.0 \n35.1 \n10.2 \n10.4 \n10.6 \n\n10.8 \n\nTotal \nCosts \n1,102.9 \n988.6 \n993.2 \n405.1 \n9.1 \n9.1 \n9.2 \n9.3 \n9.4 \n9.5 \n9.6 \n32.7 \n9.8 \n10.0 \n10.2 \n10.3 \n10.5 \n10.7 \n10.9 \n35.9 \n11.1 \n11.3 \n11.6 \n\n \n563.3 \n597.2 \n632.9 \n670.9 \n711.2 \n753.9 \n799.1 \n847.0 \n891.1 \n937.4 \n986.2 \n1,037.4 \n1,091.4 \n1,148.1 \n1,207.8 \n1,270.6 \n1,336.7 \n1,479.3 \n1,479.3 \n\n \n39.5 \n41.9 \n44.4 \n47.0 \n49.9 \n52.9 \n56.0 \n59.4 \n62.5 \n65.7 \n69.1 \n72.7 \n76.5 \n80.5 \n84.7 \n89.1 \n93.7 \n103.7 \n103.7 \n\n79.8 \n\nLocal \nRoads \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n28.3 \n41.9 \n40.6 \n46.5 \n49.0 \n52.2 \n55.6 \n59.3 \n63.2 \n67.5 \n71.4 \n75.6 \n80.1 \n84.9 \n90.0 \n94.8 \n100.0 \n105.6 \n111.6 \n\nTotal \nBenefits \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n711.1 \n766.3 \n809.1 \n861.8 \n914.1 \n970.1 \n1,029.5 \n1,092.7 \n1,151.8 \n1,214.1 \n1,279.5 \n1,348.4 \n1,421.1 \n1,497.9 \n1,579.0 \n1,664.0 \n1,753.9 \n1,935.4 \n1,949.1 \n\n \nNet \nBenefits \n\n-1,102.9 \n-988.6 \n-993.2 \n-405.1 \n702.0 \n757.1 \n799.8 \n852.5 \n904.6 \n960.6 \n1,019.9 \n1,060.0 \n1,142.0 \n1,204.2 \n1,269.3 \n1,338.0 \n1,410.6 \n1,487.1 \n1,568.0 \n1,628.1 \n1,742.7 \n1,924.1 \n1,937.5 \n\n1,547.1 \n\n \n64.8 \n68.7 \n72.8 \n77.2 \n81.8 \n86.7 \n91.9 \n97.4 \n102.5 \n107.8 \n113.5 \n119.4 \n125.6 \n132.1 \n139.0 \n146.2 \n153.8 \n170.2 \n170.2 \n\n130.9 \n\n  \n15.2 \n16.7 \n18.3 \n20.2 \n22.2 \n24.4 \n26.8 \n29.5 \n32.5 \n35.7 \n39.3 \n43.2 \n47.6 \n52.3 \n57.5 \n63.3 \n69.6 \n76.6 \n84.2 \n\n92.7 \n\n0.9 \n\n11.7 \n\n1,137.6 \n\n118.0 \n\n1,558.8 \n\nNet present value  = 2,225     EIRR = 19.1   \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n \n\nO&M = operation and maintenance, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \na Land acquisition and resettlement costs, environmental mitigation costs. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTable A15.2: Sensitivity to Changes in Economic Benefits and Costs \n \nEIRR (%) \n19.14 \n16.12 \n14.49 \n16.64 \n15.64 \n16.37 \n14.90 \n16.82 \n14.75 \n\nScenario \n1.

The  domestic  cost \nescalation  factor  for  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  is  3%.  The  price  escalation  for  foreign \nexchange  was  assumed  to  be  zero.  The  cost  estimates  are  presented  in  current  terms  taking \ninto account the potential impacts of domestic and international inflation. \n \n2. \nOperating  revenues  from  tolls  were  projected  based  on  forecast  of  future  traffic  and  a \nbase toll rate of CNY 0.35 per passenger car per kilometer (km). Corresponding tolls for other \nvehicle types are CNY 0.40 for a light truck; CNY 0.70 for a small bus or medium-sized truck; \nCNY  1.00  for  a  large  bus  or  truck;  and  CNY  1.30  for  an  articulated  truck  or  a  trailer.1 The  toll \ncharges are assumed to increase in current terms once every 5 years to keep up with inflation. \nGiven  the  complexity  of  the  civil  works,  the  capital  cost  of  the  Project  is  much  higher  than  for \nother expressway projects.2 As such, a toll of CNY5 will be charged for use of the suspension \nbridge.  \n \nAnnual  incremental  operation  and  maintenance  costs  were  calculated  based  on  2005 \n3. \nprices as follows: (i) toll operation costs were estimated at 150 staff with annual salary costs of \nCNY  25,000  per  employee;  (ii)  administration  costs  were  assumed  to  be  CNY3.75  million  per \nyear, with an annual increase of 3%; and (iii) maintenance costs were estimated at CNY40,000 \nper  km  per  year  for  routine  work  and  CNY1.0  million  per  km  for  periodic  work.  Period \nmaintenance was scheduled for 2018 and 2026. Applicable business taxes at a rate of 5.5% are \ncharged on revenue. Corporate income tax at 15% is paid on income after deducting business \ntaxes, depreciation and interest charges, operating expenses, and any prior year losses carried \nforward. \n \n4. \nAn  ADB  loan,  a  loan  from  State  Development  Bank,  and  grants  from  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications and the Hunan Provincial Government are expected to cover project financing. \nThe ADB loan amounts to $208 million, with standard ordinary capital resources terms of a 25-\nthe  Ministry  of \nyear  utilization  period  and  a  5-year  grace  period.  The  grants \nCommunications and the Hunan Provincial Government amount to 30% of project costs, which \nwill  be  viewed  as  project  equity.  The  State  Development  Bank  will  provide  CNY1,300  million, \nwith  a  25-year  repayment  period  at  an  interest  rate  of  5.51%.  An  estimated  5%  of  passenger \ncars were considered to be exempt from paying tolls.  \n \n5. \nProjected  financial  statements  are  presented  in  Table  A16.  The  projected  financial \nstatements indicate that the revenues are adequate to cover operation and maintenance costs; \nhowever, net income is negative in the first 5 years of operation because of high depreciation \ncosts  and  high  interest  payments.  The  cash  flow  projections  show  a  positive  cash  flow \nthroughout  the  project  period.  The  financial  projections  indicate  that  operational  efficiency  is \nsatisfactory  and  the  debt-service  coverage  ratio  of  more  than  1.2  is  achievable  from  the  fifth \nyear  of  operation.  The  debt-to-equity  ratio  will  be  less  than  65:35  for  the  first  year  and  will \ngradually improve thereafter. \n                                                 \n1 The assumed toll rates are consistent both with trends of Hunan practice and tolls on the existing expressways. \n2  The  per  km  cost  for  the  project  expressway  is  $6.1  million,  much  higher  than  the  $2.4  million  for  projects  in  flat \nareas, or even the $5.1 million for projects in mountainous area, mainly because of the complexity of the civil works. \nOf the 64 km expressway, tunnels, large bridges, and a suspension bridge account for 30 km: 13 tunnels (10.5 km), \n36 extra large and large bridges (18 km), and a suspension bridge (1.16 km). Without the suspension bridge, the \nper km cost is $4.8 million, roughly equal to the average cost in mountainous areas.   \n\nfrom \n\n \n\n\fTable A16: Projected Financial Statements for the Jishou\u2013Chadong Expressway, Selected Years \n(current CNY million) \n\n \n\nItem \n\n1  \n\n2  \n\n3  \n\n4  \n\n5  \n\n6  \n\n7  \n\n8  \n\n9  \n\n10  \n\n15  \n\n20  \n\n24  \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n2011 \n\n2012 \n\n2013 \n\n2014 \n\n2015 \n\n2016 \n\n2021 \n\n2026 \n\n2030 \n\n   Net Income After Corporative Tax \n\n(395) \n\n(302) \n\n (252) \n\n(200) \n\n(137) \n\n(111%) \n\n(54%) \n\n-34% \n\n(16%) \n\n3% \n\n16% \n\n48% \n\n57% \n\n59% \n\n28 \n\n80 \n\n93 \n\n111 \n\n143 \n\n165 \n\n297 \n\n462 \n\n673 \n\nIncome Statement \nOperating Revenues \n\nToll Revenues \n\n   Total Revenues \n\nNet Revenue after business tax \n\nOperation and maintenance \n\nDepreciation \n\nTotal Operating Expenses \n\n   Net Operating Income \n\nLess: Interest Expenses \n\nOperating Profit Ratio \n\nCash Flow Statement  \n\nNet Cash Inflows from Operations \n\nAsian Development Bank Loan \n\nMinistry of Communications Grant \n\nDomestic Bank Loan \n\nHunan Provincial Government \n\nSubtotal Cash Inflow \n\nConstruction Costs \n\nPrinciple Repayment \n\nNet Cash Flows \n\nDebt-Service Coverage Ratio \n\nBalance Sheet \n\nCurrent Assets \n\nAccumulated Fixed Assets \n\nTotal Assets \n\nLong-term Loans \n\nDebt-Equity Ratio \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n430 \n\n221 \n\n354 \n\n202 \n\n516 \n\n265 \n\n425 \n\n242 \n\n516 \n\n265 \n\n425 \n\n242 \n\n1,206 \n1,206 \n\n1,448 \n1,448 \n\n1,448 \n1,448 \n\n258 \n\n132 \n\n212 \n\n121 \n\n782 \n724 \n\n(232) \n\n(141)  \n\n162 \n\n161  \n\n \n\n200 \n\n210 \n\n203 \n\n  \n\n425 \n\n435 \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n28 \n  \n\n28 \n\n28 \n\n0 \n\n \n\n63 \n\n  \n\n238  \n\n262  \n\n254  \n\n  \n\n383  \n\n395  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n80  \n  \n\n82 \n\n82  \n\n (2) \n\n \n\n62 \n\n \n\n252 \n\n277 \n\n262 \n\n  \n\n 345 \n\n 358 \n\n(96) \n\n 157 \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n93 \n  \n\n86 \n\n86 \n\n7 \n\n \n\n69 \n\n  \n\n267 \n\n293 \n\n277 \n\n  \n\n311 \n\n324 \n\n(47) \n\n152 \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n90 \n\n90 \n\n21 \n\n \n\n90 \n\n \n\n294 \n\n323 \n\n306 \n\n  \n\n281 \n\n295 \n\n11 \n\n148 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n95 \n\n95 \n\n47 \n\n139 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n1,206 \n784 \n\n2,654 \n1,725 \n\n4,102 \n2,666 \n\n4,886 \n3,137 \n\n4,464  4,225   4,036 \n3,109  3,027   2,941 \n\n3,900 \n2,851 \n\n3,826 \n 2,756 \n\n4,826  4,971   5,120 \n\n5,273 \n\n5,431 \n\nSubtotal Cash Outflows \n\n1,206 \n\n1,448 \n\n1,448 \n\n724 \n\n111 \n\n143 \n\n165 \n\n297 \n\n673 \n\n1.80 \n\n1.00  \n\n1.03 \n\n1.09 \n\n1.20 \n\n1.70 \n\n2.23 \n\n2.95 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n722 \n\n 1,010 \n\n795 \n\n 1,111 \n\n751 \n\n1,050 \n\n  \n\n86 \n\n111 \n\n640 \n\n78 \n\n376 \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n462 \n\n117 \n\n165 \n\n281 \n\n180 \n\n  \n\n57 \n\n88 \n\n962 \n\n42 \n\n617 \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n201 \n\n471 \n\n  \n\n481 \n\n529 \n\n500 \n\n  \n\n157 \n\n176 \n\n324 \n\n115 \n\n141 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n128 \n\n128 \n\n169 \n\n \n\n \n\n871 \n\n2076 \n\n3826 \n\n6,583 \n\n7,632 \n\n8,717 \n\n4,478 \n\n6,267 \n\n 8,691 \n\n2,075 \n\n1,329 \n\n582 \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n6\n\ni\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n5\n1\n\n  \n\n311 \n\n342 \n\n323 \n\n  \n\n253 \n\n268 \n\n55 \n\n143 \n\n(88) \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n100 \n\n100 \n\n65 \n\n1.27 \n\n \n\n205 \n\n5,594 \n\n3,802 \n2,656 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n65 \n\n65 \n\n65 \n\n64 \n\n70 \n\n72  \n\n73 \n\n73 \n\n72 \n\n70 \n\n46 \n\n21 \n\n7 \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 17 \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT EXPRESSWAY \n\n \n1. \nA financial evaluation has been undertaken in accordance with the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment \nProjects  Financed  by  ADB.  A  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  was  calculated  based  on \nthe  Project\u2019s  capital  cost,  the  most  recent  traffic  forecasts,  and  the  proposed  toll  rates. \nSensitivity tests were conducted by varying the project costs, traffic volumes, and toll rates and \ncombinations  of  these  factors.  The  financial  evaluation  was  computed  over  4  years  of \nconstruction and 20 years of operations. The calculations are in constant 2005 prices.  \n \n2. \nThe local inflation rates were assumed at 3% during the projection period. The domestic \ncost escalation factor for the People\u2019s Republic of China is 3%. The price escalation for foreign \nexchange  was  assumed  to  be  zero.  The  cost  estimates  are  presented  in  current  terms  taking \ninto account the potential impacts of domestic and international inflation. \n \nHunan  province  is  applying  unified  toll  rates  to  all  expressways  according  to  the \n3. \nprovincial  government\u2019s  policy.  The  toll  rates  were  developed  based  on  the  Hunan  Provincial \nGovernment\u2019s toll road policies, affordability for road users, and neighboring provinces\u2019 toll rates. \nFor the purpose of the FIRR calculation, existing toll rates in Hunan have been used and held \nconstant throughout the calculation period. The project capital cost is much higher than for other \nexpressway  projects  in  Hunan  province  because  of  the  difficult  geographic  and  geological \nconditions. A special toll of CNY5 per vehicle will be charged for traffic crossing the suspension \nbridge. Applicable business taxes at a rate of 5.5% are charged on revenue. Corporate income \ntax at 15% is paid on income after deducting business taxes, depreciation and interest charges, \noperating expenses, and any prior year losses carried forward. \n \n4. \nThe  major  assumptions  used  for  calculation  of  the  FIRR  are  the  following:  (i)  all \ncalculations  are  made  in  2005  prices,  covering  2007  to  2030;  (ii)  capital  costs  include  all \nincremental capital expenditures related to the construction and equipment for the expressway, \nbut exclude price contingencies and interest during construction; (iii) operating and maintaining \ncosts  include  all  annual  incremental  expenses  incurred  in  operating  the  expressway,  but \nexclude  depreciation  and  debt  repayment  provisions;  (iv)  operating  revenues  from  toll  used  in \nfinancial projections are also adjusted to 2005 prices; and (v) the residual value of the project \ncapital cost was estimated to be 50% after 20 years of operation. \n \n5. \nThe weighted average cost of capital (WACC), after tax, in real terms was calculated at \n2.8%, using estimated capital mix and costs of funds. Costs have been considered as follows: (i) \nthe applicable 10-year fixed swap rate plus a provision for ADB\u2019s spread of 0.60% was used for \nADB  debt;  (ii)  the  estimated  interest  costs  of  5.76%  per  annum  is  used  for  the  domestic  loan \nfunds; and (iii) the cost of equity was assumed to be 8.00%. The cost of debt was also adjusted \nto reflect the impact of income of 15%. \n \n6. \nThe  FIRR,  computed  after  tax,  is  calculated  at  5.5%  (Table  A17.1).  This  compares \nfavorably with the WACC of 2.8%. The Project is considered financially viable and sustainable. \nSensitivity  tests  indicate  conditions  causing  the  Project\u2019s  viability  to  fall  below  WACC  are \nunlikely to occur.

The  development  of  the  road \nnetwork in western Hunan will help transfer the benefits of the eastern region\u2019s economic growth to the poor western \nregion. The improvement of local roads has been integrated into the Project to spread the benefits of the expressway \nover  a  wider  cross-section  of  poor  communities.  The  integrated  approach  will  improve  the  rural  poor\u2019s  mobility,  and \nthus their access to economic opportunities, helping to raise their incomes. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe  project  area  covers  one  city  and  four  counties,  all  of  which  are  considered  poor  by  either  national  or  provincial \nstandards. The Project will directly benefit 1.3 million local residents, of which 0.9 million (72%) live in rural areas. The \nProject will lower transport costs and reduce travel time and thus, once completed, the Project will improve the quality \nof transport services. Better road infrastructure and services will encourage villagers to go to markets, use educational \nand  health  facilities  more  frequently,  and  avail  themselves  of  increased  agricultural  extension  services.  These \nbenefits,  which  accrue  directly  to  road  users,  are  the  Project\u2019s  direct  effects.  Over  time,  improved  road  access  will \nexpand  economic  activities  in  the  area  and  gradually  lead  to  structural  changes  in  production  and  consumption \npatterns  and  in  the  labor  market.  Lower  transport  costs  reduce  the  costs  of  traded  farm  inputs,  thereby  raising \nagricultural  productivity  and  profitability.  Cropping  patterns  change  with  better  roads,  as  farmers  shift  to  higher-value \ncrops because of easier access to markets and new farming technologies. These are the benefits that trickle down to \nlocal people over time. Even the rural poor who rarely use roads also benefit from improved roads through more and \ncheaper goods and services and increased economic opportunities. These are the Project\u2019s indirect effects. Using the \nadequate monitoring framework and mechanism, actual impacts on poverty will be assessed. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nA  stakeholder  consultation  and  analysis  was  done  during  project  preparation  and  the  roles  of  all  stakeholders  were \nwell  defined.  The  Hunan  Provincial  Communications  Department  (HCD)  is  the  executing  agency.  The  local \ngovernments  and  communities  will  implement  the  Resettlement  Plan,  and  organize  local  labor  to  build  the \nexpressway.  With  support  from  HCD,  local  governments  will upgrade  township  roads.  Public  consultation  raised  the \nlevel of awareness and garnered local support. These processes enabled local stakeholders to express their opinions \nand  to  make  relevant  suggestions  for  the  design  of  the  expressway  and  local  roads.  Intensive  consultations  were \nundertaken  with poor rural  women and representatives of minority populations. To further consider poor women and \nminorities, the participatory activities will continue during project implementation. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nThe  contractors  will  hire  rural  villagers  including  unskilled  workers  in  the  project  area.  Before  the  alignment  was \nfinalized,  local  government  officials  and  villagers  were  consulted  to  minimize  losses  of  high-quality  arable  land  and \nstructures.  Township  governments  and  community  organizations  will  be  involved  in  the  implementation  of  the \neconomic rehabilitation component of the Resettlement Plan. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nYoung women account for 39% of total migrants from the surveyed communities.  Of all 126 women consulted, 82% \nwere  satisfied  about  their  current  status,  5%  were  unsatisfied,  and  13%  were  unclear.  Of  the  minority  women \nconsulted,  90%  were  satisfied with their current status.  In general,  the project is gender neutral and will not have an \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n   No \n\n\fAppendix 18 \n\n55\n\nadverse impact on women. Women and children will benefit substantially from the local roads for access to schools, \nmarkets, and health care and other social services. As part of the participation strategy, priority will be given to women \nfor  direct  and  indirect  project  benefits,  which  are  included  in  the  ethnic  minorities  development  plan.  Gender \ndisaggregated indicators will be monitored in the project performance management system. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n \nE.

Such  workers  will  be  trained  on  the  job. \nHCD  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  comply  with \nall  applicable  labor  legislation.  Contract  documents  will \ninclude  clauses,  prohibiting  child  labor  for  construction \nand  maintenance  activities,  ensuring  equal  pay  for  men \nand women for work of equal value, and requiring a timely \npayment for workers on a monthly basis. \nOf the project beneficiaries, 77% are minorities (Miao and \nTujia), who live in harmony with the Han. Land acquisition \nwill  affect  1,794  minority  households  (84%  of  all  those \naffected),  and  187  ethnic  minority  households  will  be \naffected by house destruction. Of the minority households \naffected, 86.0% are Miao and 13.3% are Tujia.  \nOnce  local  roads  are  upgraded,  the  number  of  traffic \naccidents  will  increase.  All  four  counties  involved  are \ngoing to position police teams on the two roads. \nFew  cases  of  HIV/AIDS  were  found  in  the  project \ncounties; however, people could be exposed to HIV/AIDS \nduring construction. Therefore in accordance with the Law \non  the  Prevention  and  Treatment  of  Epidemic  Disease, \ncounty  centers  for  disease  control  will  take  measures  to \nprevent  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  and  other  sexually \ntransmitted  infections.  HCD  and  the  contractors  will \nsupport  the  centers  in  adopting  prevention  measures  for \nworkers and local communities during construction and for \ntransport operators and truck drivers during operation. \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 19 \n\n \n\nSUMMARY ETHNIC MINORITIES DEVELOPMENT PLAN \n\n \n1. \nThe project area covers one city and four counties, all of which are considered poor by \neither  national  or  provincial  standards.  Some  600  of  1,381  villages  are  poor,  and  minorities \naccount  for  almost  100%  of  the  total  population  of  these  villages.  Members  of  the  Tujia  and \nMiao  minorities  account  for  74%  of  the  total  population  affected  by  the  Project.  Consultations \nwith 126 rural women from 15 villages indicated that 82% of them are satisfied with their current \nsocial  economic  status  and  only  5%  of  them  are  unsatisfied.  In  the  villages  surveyed,  women \nare  more  dominant  in  household  decision  making  than  men,  indicating  that  minority  women \nhave  a  good  social  position  in  their  families.  Temporary  in-migration  of  ethnic  minorities  is \ncommon, especially to work in the mining industry. However, the current citizenship registration \nsystem  and  rural  land  tenure  system  do  not  permit  migration  to  rural  areas.  Therefore  the \nminority townships will not be affected by in-migration.  \n \n2. \nSurveys  identified  1,794  ethnic  minority  households  that  will  be  affected  by  land \nacquisition (84% of all those affected).Three of the four interchanges were included to connect \nthe  project  roads  to  the  rural  minority  townships.  The  Project  will  directly  benefit  0.93  million \nlocal  residents,  of  which  0.73  million  are  minorities.  Local  residents,  mostly  minorities,  have \nexpressed a desire to receive training in appropriate agricultural techniques to take advantage \nof new cash cropping strategies and to receive support for opening small businesses. The plan \nto  address  their  needs,  while  referred  to  as  the  Ethnic  Minorities  Development  Plan  (EMDP), \nwas  prepared  to  safeguard  all  those  affected  in  the  project  area  regardless  of  their  ethnic \nidentity.  Adequate  provisions  to  enhance  the  economic  conditions  of  vulnerable  groups  have \nbeen  integrated  in  the  Project\u2019s  design  and  provisions  for  special  mitigation  measures  have \nbeen  included  in  the  Resettlement  Plan.  To  mitigate  possible  adverse  impacts  and  enhance \npositive impacts on the minorities, the government will implement measures shown in Table A19. \n \n\nTable A19: Mitigation Measures \n\n \n\nBudget \n(CNY million) \n\nSource \n\n \n \nThe Project \n\nProposed Actions \nProtection from Disturbances Arising \nfrom Construction Activities \nProhibiting night construction \nBuilding pedestrian crossings, \n\noverpasses and underpasses, and \nculverts \n\nReconstructing damaged irrigation \n\nand/or drainage systems \n\nAwareness and Prevention of \nHIV/AIDS and Sexually Transmitted \nInfections \nHealth clinics near construction camps \nPrevention posters \nEducation programs through media \n\nchannels and clinics \nDistribution of condoms \n\nTargets \n\n \n \nMore than 50,000 \n\npeople \n\nMore than 50  \n\nvillages, including \n39 villages affected \nby land acquisition \nand resettlement  \n\n \n \n \nIn all construction \n\ncamps and nearby \nvillages, especially \namong women and \nethnic minorities \n\nYear \n \n \n2007\u20132010 \n\n \n \n \n2007\u20132010 \n\n \n \n0 \n30  \n \n \n50  \n\n \n \n \n0.1 \n0.1  \n0.1  \n \n0.5  \n\nResettlement  \nFull compensation \nSpecial support to vulnerable groups \n\n \n39 villages \n\n \n2005\u2013 2006 \n\n \n150  \n1.84  \n\n \n \n \nHunan Provincial Health \nDepartment, Hunan \nProvincial \nCommunications \nDepartment (HCD), and \nlocal governments \n \nResettlement Plan \n \n\n\fBudget \n(CNY million) \n\nAppendix 19 \n\n57\n\nSource \n\n \n \nResettlement Plan \n\n \nProvincial and county \npolice traffic teams  \n\n \nLocal governments \n \nLocal governments \n\nfinanced by the Japan \nBank for International \nCooperation \n\nJapanese Embassy in \n \n\nthe People\u2019s Republic \nof China \n\n \nLocal governments \n\n \n \nProvincial Land Bureau \nProvincial Forestry \n\nBureau \n\n \nHCD and local \ngovernments \n\n \nThe Project \nHCD and local \ngovernments \n\nProposed Actions \nIncome Recovery for Those Affected \n\nby Resettlement  \n\nReceive support from local governments \nand village cadres when assistance is \nrequested \n\nPriority given to training, adult education, \n\nand construction employment \nopportunities \n\nRoad and Traffic Safety  \nRepositioning of the number two police \ntraffic team of Huayuan county from \nMalichang to Jiwei township  \n\nProvision of traffic police teams on local \n\nroads in all counties \n\nConstant patrolling on market days in \n\nrural towns \n\nRoad safety education programs \nStrict implementation of traffic \n\nregulations  \n\nPoverty Reduction Interventions  \nTechnical training on fruit and animal \n\nproduction \n\nDistribution of market information  \nEducational, medical, and water supply \nfacilities in Fenghuang and Baojing \n\nMultipurpose complex (market, \n\nrestaurant, and transport center) in \nYaoyou township \n\nTourism Development  \nAnnouncement of the opening of local \nroad sections on tourism web sites \nConstruction of tourism infrastructure \nPromotion of tourism resources \nFarmland Reclamation and \n\nReforestation \nLand reclamation \nReforestation \n\nImproved Transport Services \nConstruction of Jishou bus terminals \n40 township bus stations \nEnhanced competition among service \n\nproviders \n\nConstruction of Local Roads \nTwo intercounty roads \n400 kilometres of county-township roads \n\nEmployment of Unskilled Minorities for \nConstructing the expressway \nImproving 129 kilometers of local roads \n\nTargets \n\n \n \nThose affected by \nresettlement, \nespecially the 10 \nseriously affected \nvillages  \n\n \nLocal people residing \nin communities \nalong NR319 and \nlocal roads \n\nDrivers on NR319 \nand local roads \n\n \n\n \nMicrocredit, at least \n20% of which will \nbe targeted to \nfemale and ethnic \nminority borrowers \n\nYear \n \n \n2005\u20132007 \n\n \n2006 onward \n\n \n2006 onward \n\n \n \n0 \n \n \n0.2  \n\n \n0.1  \n \n \n0.5  \n \n0 \n \n0.2  \n0 \n\n \n25.0 \n \n1.0 \n25.0 \n\n \n2006 onward \n\n \n \n2006\u20132008 \n\n \n2006\u20132010 \n\n \n0 \n \n1,000  \n5  \n \n \n27.03  \n6.69  \n\n \n47.91 \n30 \n0 \n\n \n2006\u20132010 \n\n \n240  \n200  \n\n \nCounties within the \n\nproject area \n\nTourists and tourism \n\nagents  \n\n \n \n39 villages \n\n \nRural households in \nthe project area of \nwhich 85% are \nminorities and 33% \nwere poor (in 2003) \n\n \nCounty and township \ngovernments and \ncommunities along \nthe roads \n\n \nPriority given to local \n\nlabor and vulnerable \npeople.

The two local roads (43 \nkm and 86 km) will affect four counties. The field survey indicated that the project expressway \nand  connector  road  will  require  351  hectares  of  land  to  be  permanently  acquired,  of  which  is \n32% is paddy, 19% is dry land, 3% is planted with vegetables or orchards, 44% is forestland, \nand  2%  consists  of  other  types  of  land.  Based  on  the  amount  of  per  capita  farmland  in  the \naffected  villages,  the  land  acquisition  is  equivalent  to  the  complete  loss  of  farmland  for  3,105 \npeople. About 115 hectares of land will be used temporarily during the construction phase. The \nnumber of rural people whose houses will be demolished is 973, with total floor space of their \nhouses  amounting  to  27,491  square  meters.  For  the  local  roads,  the  impact  will  be  small \nbecause existing alignments will be upgraded. Land acquisition and resettlement impacts were \nminimized  by  aligning  the  expressway  away  from  densely  populated  areas  and  avoiding \nirrigated  land  and  production  facilities  based  on  consultations  with  local  officials  and  affected \npeople. \n \n2. \nThe  Resettlement  Plan  was  prepared  by  the  Hunan  Provincial  Communications \nDepartment  (HCD)  with  the  help  of  technical  assistance  consultants.  The  Resettlement  Plan \nwas based on the preliminary design and socioeconomic surveys covering 400 households and \n39 village-level interviews. The surveys revealed that 84% of the affected households are ethnic \nminorities,  mostly  Miao.  Consultations  were  conducted  with  the  affected  people  and  their \ncomments  and  suggestions  were  reviewed  to  ensure  that  any  concerns  are  addressed.  The \ndraft Resettlement Plan has been reviewed by the affected city and counties and by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), and these comments have been incorporated into the Resettlement \nPlan.  After  the  detailed  design  approval  by  HCD,  a  detailed  survey  will  be  carried  out  to \ndetermine  the  precise  number  of  people  and  assets  affected.  Changes  and  related  cost \nadjustments  will  be  included  in  an  updated  Resettlement  Plan  and  submitted  to  ADB  for \napproval prior to the commencement of compensation and land acquisition.  \n \n3. \nFor  people  unavoidably  affected  by  the  Project,  the  resettlement  objective  is  to  ensure \nthe  attainment  of  equal  or  better  livelihoods  and  living  standards  in  line  with  the  Land \nAdministration Law (1998) and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and Policy on \nIndigenous  peoples  (1998).  The  Resettlement  Plan  stipulates  eligibility  and  entitlement \nprovisions  for  those  losing  land,  houses,  and  income  and  provides  relocation  and  economic \nrehabilitation  measures  and  strategies.  HCD  will  ensure  that  the  resettlement  entitlements  are \nprovided to the people affected prior to ground clearance and the commencement of demolition. \nLand  compensation  and  resettlement  subsidies  will  be  paid  to  affected  village  groups  or \nindividuals. Housing compensation and compensation for young crops and other assets will be \nprovided directly to people losing those assets.  \n \n4. \nSites for relocation should be selected in line with the plans for income restoration and \noverall  township  plans.  Generally  there  are  three  options  for  selecting  sites  for  residential \nresettlement: (i) for villages where only several households are involved in house relocation, the \nnew housing sites will be selected in the same village or land-owning group as agreed with the \naffected households; (ii) if more households have to be relocated, a site suitable for a cluster of \nhouses will be selected keeping farmers\u2019 preferences in mind; and (iii) for households that wish \nto move to towns, both the township government and villages will consider the requests. \n \n5. \nProposed  income  rehabilitation  measures  are  to  (i)  incorporate  the  resettlement  into \nlocal  economic  development  programs,  such  as  production  development  or  irrigation  system \n\n\fAppendix 20 \n\n59\n\nimprovement  and  expansion;  (ii)  facilitate  cash  crop  production,  animal  husbandry,  and  fish \nfarming; (iii) establish small businesses based on local resource endowments; and (iv) provide \nincome insurance to households with elderly members. Detailed needs for farmers to enhance \ntheir  working  skills  have  been  analyzed  by  means  of  the  socioeconomic  survey  and  relevant \ntraining  has  been  included  in  the  Resettlement  Plan.  For  vulnerable  groups,  the  Project  will \nprovide a special social assistance fund to secure their livelihoods and living conditions. \n \n6. \nHCD  will  be  responsible  for  the  general  administration  of  the  Project.  A  Project \nResettlement  Office  will  be  set  up  to  coordinate,  monitor,  and  supervise  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement. Resettlement organizations will be established at the prefecture, city, and county \nlevels. Each affected township will have a resettlement office. Resettlement and land acquisition \ncosts for the Project are estimated at CNY264 million ($31.96 million). Some adjustments in the \nbudget are expected following the detailed measurement survey. \n \n7. \nAt various stages, affected people have been consulted about the likely impacts of the \nProject.  The  stakeholders  consulted  include  (i)  heads  of  households  that  will  be  affected,  (ii) \nvillage  heads  and  villagers\u2019  representatives,  (iii)  local  government  agencies  and  departments, \nand  (iv)  women  and  vulnerable  groups.  Two  public  hearings  are  planned  by  the  Hunan  Land \nand Resources Department, one to adjust the Land Use Plan and a second to fix compensation \nrates  based  on  the  detailed  measurement  survey.  Consultation  will  continue  throughout  the \nimplementation period. HCD organized public consultation meetings in the affected villages. Key \nfindings  indicated  full  support  for  the  Project.  Some  of  the  concerns  raised  have  been \naddressed  by  adjusting  the  design  and  improving  compensation  and  resettlement  measures \nand entitlements. Those affected were provided with a resettlement information booklet in June \n2005.  In  the  case  of  grievances,  all  complaints  will  be  processed  based  on  Government \nRegulation Number 431 on Grievance and Redress, which came into effect on 1 May 2005.  \n \n8. \nThe  Resettlement  Plan  includes  internal  and  external  monitoring  systems.  The  Project \nResettlement Office and local resettlement offices will be responsible for internal monitoring to \nensure the timely and satisfactory implementation of land acquisition and resettlement activities \naccording to the Resettlement Plan. Reporting will be quarterly and a resettlement completion \nreport will be prepared. The reports will be sent to ADB in a timely manner to keep ADB closely \ninformed of progress and any substantive changes. \n \n9. \nAn  independent  institute  or  organization  will  be  contracted  to  carry  out  the  external \nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  The  tasks  include  (i)  reviewing  and  verifying  the  compensation \npayments;  (ii)  ascertaining  the  status  of  land  acquisition  and  compensation  payments;  (iii) \nassessing the compensation disbursement procedure; (iv) appraising the grievance procedure; \n(v)  determining  recipients\u2019  satisfaction  with  the  entitlements  and  compensation;  and  (vi) \nassessing  the  efficiency,  effectiveness,  impact,  and  sustainability  of  the  resettlement  to  draw \nlessons  for  future  resettlement  implementation,  formulation,  and  planning.  The  external \nmonitoring will be carried out every six months in the first two years and then annually for two \nyears  or  until  resettlement  has  been  successfully  completed.  The  external  monitoring  and \nevaluation reports will be sent to HCD and ADB simultaneously. \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 1 November 2005) \n \n\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "yuan (CNY) \n$0.1237 \nCNY8.0840 \n", "Currency Unit\nCNY1.00\n$1.00\n", " \nThe  exchange  rate  of  the  yuan  is  determined  under  a  floating  exchange  rate  system.
