The report also describes \nthe  proposed  administration  of  grants  to  be  provided  by  the  Government  of  Australia  and  the \nGreen Climate Fund (GCF) for the project, and if the Board approves the proposed grant, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grants.  \n \nThe project will build a climate-resilient port in Nauru, including a wharf, a berth pocket, \n2. \nand a breakwater at Aiwo. It will reconstruct port buildings, the container storage area, and port \nsecurity facilities. The project will support institutional reforms to strengthen the Port Authority of \nNauru  (PAN)  and  achieve  sound  and  efficient  port  governance  and  management.  It  will  also \nestablish a revolving fund to ensure financially sustainable port operation and maintenance (O&M).  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nFragile economy. Nauru is a single isolated island in the Pacific with a land area of only \n21 square kilometers and a population of 11,288.1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) identifies \nNauru  as  a  country  in  fragile  and  conflict-affected  situations  since  2008.2 Nauru\u2019s  economy  is \nhighly  volatile  and  based  on diminishing  phosphate  mining, the  sale  of  fishing  rights,  and  a \nregional processing center for migrants seeking asylum in Australia. In the 1970s, Nauru had one \nof  the  highest  rates  of  national  income  per  capita  in  the  world.  By  the  1990s,  however,  the \neconomy  had  contracted  severely  as  phosphate  reserves  and  mining  revenue  dried  up.  The \ngovernment introduced broad fiscal and financial management reforms starting in 2005, and the \neconomy has recovered. Nauru\u2019s gross domestic product grew at an annual average rate of 5% \nin 2015\u20132016.3 The country\u2019s phosphate reserves, its main natural resource, have become nearly \nexhausted, and significant economic uncertainties remain. Nauru urgently needs to upgrade its \ninfrastructure to quickly develop alternative sources of revenue and growth.   \n \n4. \nAiwo  Port  is  the  only  gateway  for  essential  imports  and  exports.  Nauru  is  almost \ntotally dependent on maritime transport for its survival. More than 95% of Nauru\u2019s international \ntrade moves by sea. This makes safe and effective maritime port operations critical to meeting its \npeople\u2019s basic needs for fuel, medical supplies, food, and water. Shipping operations in and out \nof  Nauru  are  neither  safe,  nor  effective,  nor  year-round.  Aiwo\u2019s  aged  port  infrastructure  is \ndilapidated and was never developed to the standard needed for efficient operations in Nauru\u2019s \nchallenging maritime environment. This and the increasingly worsening ocean conditions at Nauru \nnow make the port frequently inoperable, with shutdowns often lasting weeks at a time. Nauru is \nplagued by regular fuel, electricity, food, and water shortages. The port\u2019s deficiencies drive up \nshipping rates and the country\u2019s overall basic costs of living. The education and health sectors \nsuffer from chronic supply shortages. Rates of lifestyle disease (diabetes and obesity) are among \n\n                                                 \n1   Government  of  Nauru,  National  Bureau  of  Statistics.  http://nauru.prism.spc.int  (assessed  2015).  This  does  not \n\ninclude about 1,200 residents of the government\u2019s regional refugee processing center. \n\n2  ADB. 2012.

About a quarter of the population lives below the country\u2019s basic-needs \npoverty line.4 \n \n5. \nInoperability and dangers of the current port facilities and operations. The existing \nAiwo  Port  consists  of  a  small  boat  harbor  built  in  1907,  an  offshore  anchorage  and  mooring \nsystem, a container yard, and the PAN buildings.5 It cannot accommodate oceangoing containers \nand cargo ships, which are forced to load and unload their cargoes beyond the fringing reef in \ndeep open waters. All cargo and container transfers onto and off the vulnerable pusher barges \nthat run back and forth between the vessels and the boat harbor dock are done manually. This is \ndifficult, time-consuming, and dangerous to crews and vessels. Fuel, freight, and demurrage costs \nare far higher than they should be because each loading and unloading takes an average of 21 \ndays to complete. \n \n6. \nThe cargo transfers on the open sea and safe transit for the small barges are impossible \nwhen  the  weather  and  the  speed  and  direction  of  wind  are  unfavorable.  The  mooring  system \nmeant  to  secure  ocean  ships  offshore  is  often  damaged  during  harsh  conditions  and  out  of \noperation for months until costly repairs can be done. This means visiting ships must offload while \nadrift on the ocean near the reef.6 When the sea is too rough, work stops. The port must shut \ndown completely for 3 months a year. \n\n \nThe existing port buildings are in danger of collapse, contain asbestos, pose serious safety \n7. \nrisks for PAN workers, have capacity limitations, and do not comply with International Ship and \nPort Facility Security requirements.7  \n\n \nPAN faces multiple port management challenges. The port operations are not financially \n8. \nviable. Tariff levels do not reflect the cost of delivering the services the port provides. PAN lacks \ntechnical and managerial capacity and formal management systems.  \n\n \nPort  vulnerabilities  intensifying  with  climate  change.  Aiwo  is  extremely  exposed  to \n9. \nwesterly winds. Use of the small barges to ferry cargo and containers in and out of the shallow \nboat harbor has become more and more difficult, dangerous, and prone to prolonged delays and \nshutdowns. Climate analysis and PAN records show that westerly waves of more than 2 meters \nin height, which disrupt port operations offshore for at least 3 months a year, have become more \nfrequent. Westerly waves and swells are driven by the El Ni\u0148o Southern Oscillation, the South \nPacific Convergence Zone, the Western Pacific Monsoon, and distant tropical cyclonic activities. \nA  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment  indicates  significant  risks  that  climate  change  will \nintensify the effects of these climate drivers.8 Worsening waves, winds, and long-range cyclones, \nalong with rising sea levels, will make the current port facilities inoperable for longer periods every \nyear in the future.   \n \n\n                                                 \n4  Government of Nauru. 2013.

The \nsmall walled harbor on the east coast at Anibare is used mainly by fishing vessels, although containers are sometimes \nferried  into  its  dock  from  offshore  ships  when  operations  at  Aiwo  are  shut  down  by  seasonal  heavy  seas  on  the \nwestern side of the island. Port development at Anibare has been discounted because the (i) area is exposed to \ntrade winds and wave climate for about 9 months of the year; (ii) the subsea geology comprises a submarine landslip, \npresenting a significant risk that further subsea instability may severely damage new port infrastructure; (iii) the reef \nand marine ecosystem around and within Anibare Bay is relatively pristine, and any port development would place \nthis ecosystem at high risk of irreversible damage. \n\n6   Maintenance of the mooring system costs the government an average of A$1 million a year.  \n7   International Maritime Organization. 2003.

Historically, two shipping lines\u2014Neptune and \n10. \nMatson  Shipping\u2014have  served  Nauru.  In  November  2015,  the  chronic  delays,  technical \nchallenges,  added  expense,  and  risks  of  using  the  inadequate,  unprotected  port  at  Aiwo  led \nMatson Shipping to suspend its service to the country. This has left Neptune the only shipping \ncompany still willing to operate in Nauru. Dependence on a single line increases the country\u2019s \nshipping costs, consumer prices, and vulnerability. With climatic, weather, and sea conditions at \nAiwo expected to worsen, the risk that Neptune Shipping will also withdraw its vessels one day is \nhigh.  This  would  force  the  government  to  charter  ships  at  even  higher  costs  simply  to  keep \nNauru\u2019s lifeline open. \n\n \n11. \nIn 2010\u20132012, an average of 19 container vessels and eight fuel ships visited Nauru each \nyear. During this period, the port handled an annual average of 1,415 twenty-foot equivalent units \nof container shipments and 18 phosphate ships. In 2013, after the regional processing center for \nasylum  seekers  reopened,  container  ship  arrivals  rose  significantly  from  18  to  32,  and  the \ncontainer shipment volume more than doubled to 2,856 twenty-foot equivalent units. Ship arrivals \ndropped in 2016 after Matson Shipping withdrew its services (para. 10). If current port conditions \npersist,  the  decline  in  ship  visits  and  container  volume  is  projected  to  continue.  But  once  the \nproposed project completes the improvement of port facilities and reforms of port operations, pre-\n2012 levels are expected to be restored and possibly surpassed by 2020.  \n\n \nOptions  studied  for  improving  the  port.  Nauru\u2019s  geography  is  uniquely  hostile  to \n12. \nmaritime  shipping  and  offers  few  options  for  developing  adequate  berthing  facilities  for \noceangoing  ships.  It  has  no  natural  harbor,  and  the  seabed  drops  sharply  just  beyond  the \nsurrounding  reef,  reaching  3,000  meters  (or  3  kilometers)  in  depth  within  7  kilometers  of  the \ncoastline. Alternatives for the design of a protected port are further limited by the westerly waves \nand swells at Aiwo (para. 9). Several organizations conducted studies on the best way to provide \nNauru  with  an  efficient,  effective,  and  reliable  port\u2014ADB  in  2009, 9  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency in 2014,10 and the Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility in 2015 (footnote 5). \nADB  performed  two  additional  studies  for  the  project  in  2015\u20132017.11 Together,  these  studies \nexplored  21  designs  and  exhausted  virtually  every  technically  feasible  option.  The  proposed \nproject design includes the construction of a 170-meter-long, 30-meter-wide wharf adjacent to a \n50-meter-wide berth pocket dredged into the reef; a breakwater about 140 meters long; and port \nbuilding and security facilities. The design is technically feasible, complies with International Ship \nand Port Facility Security requirements, and ensures climate resilience. This is also the least-cost \noption. \n \nReadiness for implementation. The project is at a high level of implementation readiness. \n13. \nThe due diligence was completed with project preparatory transaction technical assistance (TA) \n(footnote 11). ADB\u2019s project design advance (PDA) prepared the detailed engineering design and \nbidding documents (footnote 11). The project preparatory TA completed a detailed assessment \nof  the  needs  for  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building  (port  reforms)  at  PAN.  The \nGovernment of Australia has already provided a A$3.3 million grant to support the port reforms, \nwhich will be implemented under the TA (footnote 11).  \n \nValue added by ADB assistance. ADB led the efforts by Nauru\u2019s development partners \n14. \nto help the government achieve its critical goal of developing Aiwo Port.

ADB has been instrumental in designing the reforms to restructure PAN (para. 24). It also \nspearheaded  the  work  to  set  up  a  revolving  O&M  fund  to  ensure  that  port  operations  and \nmaintenance of the new assets are sustainable beyond project completion (para. 25).  \n \n15. \nThe  project  promotes  poverty  reduction,  inclusive  economic  growth,  climate  resilience, \nand infrastructure development in a small state facing fragile and conflict-affected situations. This \nis consistent with the government\u2019s priorities12 and aligned with ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, 2016\u2013\n2020.13 The project is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.14 \n \nB. \n \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  sustainability  and  quality  of  life  of  all \n16. \nNauruans  improved. 15 The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  efficiency,  reliability,  and \nclimate resilience of Aiwo Port improved.16   \n \nC. \n \n17. \nOutput 1: Climate-proofed port infrastructure constructed. The project will construct \nnew port infrastructure, including a wharf, a berth pocket, and a breakwater. It will also reconstruct \nport buildings, the container storage area, and port security facilities.  \n \n18. \nOutput  2:  Sustainable  operations  and  maintenance  achieved.  Supported  by  the \nongoing TA, the government will set up a revolving fund to be used exclusively to finance the \nmaintenance of the assets constructed under the project.17 The fund will be built initially to cover \n3  years  of  maintenance  costs.  It  will  be  financed  by  port  revenue  and  government  budget \nallocations. The government contribution will decline over time as the port, supported by reforms, \ngradually achieves positive operating net income. This is expected by June 2021 (paras. 25 and \n30.  \n \n19. \nOutput 3: Efficient port operations established. Under the ongoing TA, the government \nand PAN will carry out port reforms, including institutional strengthening, capacity development, \ntariff restructuring, and the engagement of the private sector in port operations and management \n(para. 24).  \n\n \nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nD. \n \n20. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $79.59  million  (Table  1).

The  government  has  also  requested  grants  not  exceeding \nA$18.00 million ($14.08 million equivalent) from the Government of Australia and $26.91 million \nfrom the GCF, both to be administered by ADB, to help finance the project. The disbursement of \nADB financing and ADB-administered cofinancing will be on a cost-sharing basis and front-loaded \nagainst the government counterpart financing. The summary financing plan is in Table 2. \n \n\nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \n\n \nSource \nAsian Development Bank\u2014Special Funds resources (ADF \ngrant) \nGovernment of Australia (grant)a \nGreen Climate Fund (grant)b \nGovernmentc \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\nShare of Total \n(%)\n\n21.30\n14.08\n26.91\n17.30\n79.59\n\n26.76\n17.69\n33.81\n21.74\n100.00\n\nADF = Asian Development Fund. \na   Administered  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).

Of the overall $79.59 million project costs, the cost of \n22. \nclimate  change  adaptation  is  estimated  to  be  $54.87  million.  This  cost  is  calculated  as  the \ndifference between the costs of the port development options with and without climate resilience. \nThe  without-climate  resilience  option  involves  strengthening  the  existing  open-sea  mooring \nsystem. The with-climate resilience option involves the breakwater, dredging to enable ships to \nsafely enter and berth in the calmer waters that the breakwater will protect, and a wharf for loading \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n6 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nand  unloading.  The  selected  option  is  the  most  cost-effective  of  the  feasible  alternatives  for \nproviding climate resilience. The GCF will fund about half of the adaptation costs (49%).  \n \nE. \n \n23. \nA project steering committee comprising representatives of line ministries and chaired by \nthe secretary, Ministry of Finance (MOF) will provide overall oversight. MOF will be the executing \nagency, and PAN the implementing agency. A project management unit (PMU) to be established \nwill include PAN staff and supervision consultants. PAN\u2019s chief executive officer, to be recruited \ninternationally, will be responsible for the project\u2019s supervision and day-to-day implementation, \nincluding  financial  management,  monitoring,  and  evaluation.  The  PMU  will  maintain  separate \naccounts  for  the  project,  which  will  be  audited  by  an  independent  auditor.  The  PMU  will  be \nresponsible  for  procuring  the  civil  works  contract  under  ADB  oversight.  The  government  has \ndelegated the selection of supervision consultants to ADB.  \n \n24. \nThe project team will carry out the port reforms under the ongoing TA alongside project \nimplementation (footnote 11). The reforms will strengthen PAN, introduce legislative amendments \nfor  organizational  and  port  tariff  restructuring,  create  an  effective  asset  management  system, \nestablish a revolving fund for O&M, and engage a private sector port operator to ensure long-term \nsustainability of assets. The government will implement the reforms from 1 January 2018 to 31 \nDecember 2022.    \n \n25. \nThe government will set up and maintain the revolving fund for port maintenance during \nthe  implementation  of  port  reforms  from  1  July  2018  to  30  June  2023.  Since  Nauru\u2019s  banking \nsystem consists of a single banking agency, the fund will likely be deposited in a bank in Australia. \nIt will be used as the new port becomes operational by June 2020 and replenished annually to \nensure  that it  can  cover  3  years  of  maintenance  costs.  The  implementation  arrangements  are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements\n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date  \nEstimated grant closing date  30 June 2023\nManagement \n\nJanuary 2018\u2013December 2022\n31 December 2022\n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\nProject steering committee \n(i)  Secretary, Ministry of Finance (chair) \n(ii)  Chairman, Port Authority of Nauru (member) \n(iii)  Secretary, Ministry of Transport (member) \n(iv)  Advisor to the Ministry of Finance (member) \n(v)  Chief executive officer, Port Authority of Nauru (member) \n(vi)  Chief executive officer, Ronphos Corporation (member) \n(vii)  Eigigu Holdings Corporation, representing the private sector \n\n(member) \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)  Implementing agency \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \nConsulting services \n(supervision consultants) \n\n(viii)  Team leader, mooring task force (member) \nMinistry of Finance\nPort Authority of Nauru\nProject management unit under the Port Authority of Nauru  \nInternational competitive bidding\nQuality- and cost-based selection \n(90:10)\n\n1 contract\n81 person-\nmonths \n\n$66.09 milliona\n$1.5 million \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nAspects \nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contractingb \n\nDisbursement  \n\nArrangements\n\nRetroactive financing for the reimbursement of eligible expenditures \nincurred under the project before the effective date of the grant \nagreements, up to a maximum amount equivalent to 20% of each \ngrant amount.

The project team, through the TA and PDA, assessed all the technically \nfeasible  options.  These  assessments  included  wave  analysis;  the  testing  of  infrastructure \nconfigurations  through  ship  simulation  modeling;  geotechnical  investigations;  topographic, \ncadastral, and bathymetric surveys; and an assessment of the presence of unexploded ordnance \nwithin  the  proposed  development  footprint.  The  project  team  closely  considered  construction \nissues, wave climate and climate change impacts, berthing availability, and wharf orientation. The \nbreakwater, wharf, foreshore port buildings, and container yard have been designed for greater \nheights to withstand projected rises in sea levels and increasing severity and frequency of waves. \nThese design features add to the project\u2019s climate resilience and economic viability.     \n \nClimate  change  adaptation  measures.  The  project\u2019s  main  climate  change  adaptation \n27. \nmeasures\u2014dredging  a  berthing  pocket  and  constructing  the  wharf  and  breakwater\u2014will  cost \n$54.87 million. Of this, the GCF is providing $26.91 million in grant cofinancing. These measures \nwill enable oceangoing vessels serving Nauru to berth in an area protected from climatic hazards \nand  climate  change  effects,  and  to  transfer  cargo  and  containers  directly  to  and  from  land \nalongside a sheltered wharf.  \n\n \n28. \nClimate  change  mitigation  measures.  Climate  change  mitigation  will  be  achieved  by \n Once the project \nreducing the emission of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2).\nis completed, fuel-powered pusher barges will no longer be needed to ferry shipments to and from \nvessels offshore. The average berthing stay of a container ship is expected to decline from about \n21 days to 3 days once the new facilities are built. Fuel ship berthing should be cut to 1 day on \naverage  from  the  current  4  days.  Shorter  berthing  periods  and  elimination  of  the  need  for \nmotorized barges will significantly reduce the fuel consumed by port operations and cut emissions \nby  an  estimated  10,708  tons  of  CO2  a  year.  Because  ship  visits  are  expected  to  marginally \nincrease (para. 11), the project is projected to reduce CO2 emissions by about 500,000 tons over \nits 50-year economic lifetime.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n8 \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nB. \n \n29. \nThe project\u2019s primary quantifiable benefits are (i) savings in time and operating costs for \nvisiting cargo and fuel vessels, (ii) costs saved by eliminating the need for pusher barges to ferry \ncargo,  (iii)  savings  afforded  by  eliminating  the  need  to  charter  shipping  vessels  to  keep  the \nmaritime lifeline open, (iv) reduced  port operation costs thanks to shorter berthing periods per \nvessel,  and  (v)  savings  from  climate  change  mitigation  thanks  to  reduced  greenhouse  gas \nemissions. The project is economically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate of return \nof 9.4%. A sensitivity analysis applying a worst-case scenario of a 10% drop in benefits and a \n10% rise in construction costs from the baseline case shows that the project would still yield an \neconomic internal rate of return of 7.3%. This would be acceptable given the project\u2019s substantial \nunquantified benefits, including a reduction in damage to perishable imports, increase in safety \nand security at the port (fewer accidents), and social benefits.     \n\nGovernance \n\n \n30. \nThe project is financially viable with an estimated financial internal rate of return of 2.9%, \nwhich  is  higher  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  1.3%.  This  assumes,  however,  a \nsubstantial increase in the port handling tariff, as approved by the government. The introduction \nof  higher  tariffs  underwent  intensive  stakeholder  consultations.  In  November  2017,  the \ngovernment gazetted the law to increase the tariffs. Therefore, the risk of not implementing the \ntariff increase is moderate. Nevertheless, to mitigate the risks and ensure financial sustainability, \nthe government agreed to set up a dedicated maintenance fund earmarked from its budget from \n1 July 2018. This fund will fully cover port operations and maintenance if the project does not \ngenerate sufficient revenue (para. 18). The port reforms will recommend appropriate management \nof any accumulated funds generated from the port tariffs.  \n \nC. \n \n31. \nReforms  for  efficiency  and  sustainability.  The  project  will  support  comprehensive \nreforms to improve the port\u2019s performance and secure its long-term sustainability (para. 24). Once \nthe new port is operational, the government will engage a qualified private sector operator to run \nthe port. This will reduce operating costs and improve port efficiency.  \n \nFinancial management risks and mitigation measures. The financial management risk \n32. \nis rated high at PAN. This is mainly because of PAN\u2019s lack of experience in managing externally \nfunded  projects.  Among  other  things,  the  mitigation  measures  supported  by  the  TA  will  (i) \nstrengthen  PAN  institutionally  and  develop  its  capacity;  (ii)  establish  a  financial  management \ninformation system and accounting procedures; (iii) ensure the adoption of an asset management \nand  maintenance  plan,  and  the  establishment  of  the  revolving  maintenance  fund;  (iv)  draft \nlegislative amendments for organizational and tariff restructuring and regulations to be passed by \n31 December 2019; (v) engage experienced international experts for key positions in PAN; and \n(vi) provide on-the-job and overseas training for PAN staff.  \n \n33. \nProcurement and implementation risks and mitigation measures. ADB will disburse \nfunds directly to contractors, consultants, and suppliers engaged by the project, which now boasts \nhigh  procurement  readiness  thanks  to  PDA  support  (para.  13).  ADB  will  supervise  the \nprocurement  of  works  and  goods  and  the  selection  of  consultants.  It  will  closely  monitor  the \nperformance of contractors, consultants, and suppliers. PAN will prepare regular financial reports \nand engage an external auditor acceptable to ADB to prepare annual audited financial statements. \nAll  project-related  expenses  will  be  disbursed  following  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nSafeguards \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n34. \nwith  the  government,  MOF,  and  PAN.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM.  \n \nD. \n \n35. \nThe project will benefit the entire Nauru population. A reliable year-round port will provide \naccess  to  essential  imported  goods  that  are  now  increasingly  difficult  and  expensive  for  the \ncountry to obtain. These include staple goods; fresh produce and more nutritious foods; medicines \nand medical supplies (which are now often delayed, damaged, or lost in transit); and education \nmaterials and equipment. As maritime freight costs decline, the quarter of the population currently \nliving below the basic-needs poverty line will be able to better afford consumer goods.  \n \n36. \nThe project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. PAN currently employs only \nthree women on its staff of 60. PAN will implement a gender action plan that will significantly boost \nparticipation by women and contribute to their economic empowerment. The plan sets minimum \ntargets for female participation in community consultations, project committees, PAN\u2019s skilled and \nunskilled workforce, training for communities, and on the PMU staff.    \n \nE. \n \n37. \ncategories are as follows.19 \n \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  initial  environmental  examination  confirms  that  the \n38. \nproject  will  have  no  significant  impacts  on  the  environment  since  it  will  be  undertaken  largely \nwithin  the  footprint  of  the  existing  port  facilities.  The  project  team  has  updated  the  initial \nenvironmental examination, including the environmental management plan (EMP), based on the \ndetailed design. The project will not impact any endemic, endangered, or significant marine or \nterrestrial  biodiversity  and  will  not  affect  freshwater,  forests,  and  agriculture.  Impacts  on  the \nterrestrial and shallow water marine ecosystems and their environments are expected to be minor \nand can be managed through mitigation measures. The EMP will guide the contractor in preparing \nthe construction EMP, which must be reviewed and cleared by the PMU and ADB before physical \nactivities begin. \n \n39. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  project  will  be  implemented  within  the \nexisting port land parcel, which the government has been leasing since 1907. The project will not \nresult  in  physical  or  economic  displacement  or  involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  team \nprepared a due diligence report to confirm land ownership and ensure that the land lease and \narrangements comply with government laws and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. All the key \nstakeholders have been consulted and will continue to be consulted during implementation.  \n\n In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n \nIndigenous peoples (category C). No indigenous peoples live on the island who can be \n\n40. \ndefined as distinct and vulnerable. \n \n\n                                                 \n19  ADB.
