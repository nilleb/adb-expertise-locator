Tajikistan is landlocked and \nbordered by Afghanistan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan. \nThe country had a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of $871 in 2019, and the poverty rate \nin the country is about 27% of the total population.2 Most of the population categorized as poor \nlive in rural areas that are isolated from main economic mainstream because of underdeveloped \ntransport  networks.  Because  of  underdeveloped  railway  and  aviation  subsectors,  the  country \nrelies heavily on road transport for international and domestic movement of goods and people. \n \n4. \nNeed  for  balanced  development  of  the  road  network.  The  road  network  under  the \nMOT\u2019s  jurisdiction  totals  14,339  kilometers  (km),  comprising  3,348  km  of  international  roads \n(23%), 2,127 km of national roads (15%), and 8,864 km of local roads (62%). About 77% of roads \nare paved.3 To strengthen connectivity with surrounding countries, the government has prioritized \nimproving  international  highway  networks,  which  comprise  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation  (CAREC)  corridors  2,  3,  5,  and  6  and  Asian  Highway  (AH)  7,  AH65,  and  AH66.4 \nMost of these international roads are in good or fair condition. On the other hand, national roads \nhave  deteriorated  and  remain  unsafe  because  of  disaster-prone  topography,  dysfunctional \nmaintenance systems, overloaded trucks, and the poor quality of the original construction works \ncarried out in the 1970s. \n \nWeak economic and physical connectivity in southern Tajikistan. Unbalanced road \n5. \ndevelopment is reflected in the poor state of roads in the southern oblast (province) of Khatlon. \nWith  37.2%  of  the  country\u2019s  population,  it  is  the  country\u2019s  most  populous  oblast.  It  is  also  the \ncountry\u2019s  largest  agricultural  producer.  For  these  reasons,  the  oblast  is  critical  to  the  overall \neconomic  growth  of  Tajikistan.  Meanwhile,  the  poverty  rate  in  the  oblast  is  the  highest  in  the \n\n \n\n1  The Asian Development Bank provided small-scale transaction technical assistance to prepare the project: ADB. \n2020.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  Preparing  the  Road  Network  Sustainability  Project. \nManila. \n\n2  World Bank. World Bank Open Data: GDP per capita [current US$] of Tajikistan (accessed 3 October 2020); and \n\n3   Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport (Road Transport [Nonurban]) (accessible from the list of linked documents \n\nADB. 2020. Basic Statistics 2020. Manila. \n\nin Appendix 2). \n\n4  The Asian Highway Network is a regional initiative to improve major road networks among countries in Asia and \n\nEurope, and is overseen by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. \n\n \n\n\fcountry,  while  the  human  development  and  income  indexes  are  the  lowest. 5 Poor  transport \ninfrastructure is a key factor behind these socioeconomic challenges. \n \n6. \nSeveral  international  corridors  traverse  South  Tajikistan,  including  AH66  and  CAREC \ncorridors 5 and 6. Most of the corridors have been rehabilitated with the assistance of ADB and \nother  development  partners  and  facilitate  the  region\u2019s  economic  development  by  linking  major \neconomic  centers.6 However,  national  roads  connecting  these  international  corridors  have  not \nbeen well developed, limiting the local population\u2019s use of these corridors. The project will address \nthe  immediate  needs  for  strengthening  domestic  connectivity  by  improving  two  national  road \nsections: (i)  Dangara\u2013Okmazor  and (ii)  Hulbuk\u2013Kangurt.  These sections  are  vital  as they  both \nlink up with AH66 (at Dangara and Hulbuk). Furthermore, the Dangara\u2013Okmazor section is part \nof a key corridor intersecting with CAREC corridors 5 and 6 at Bokhtar; and the Hulbuk\u2013Kangurt \nsection serves as a local economic corridor passing through the region\u2019s key economic centers. \nTraffic volume on the Hulbuk\u2013Kangurt road is about 1,300 vehicles per day in 2020, while traffic \nvolume on the Dangara\u2013Okmazor section is about 4,200 vehicles per day.7 At completion, the \nsections  will  form  a  new  economic  network  around  Dangara,  which  the  government  plans  to \ndevelop as the oblast\u2019s new capital city.8 Despite their strategic importance, these sections have \nnot been equipped with sufficient road safety facilities and disaster-proof measures. Inadequate \nroad maintenance has led to their continuous deterioration and to heavy dust pollution. Improving \nthe  sections  would  strengthen  economic  connectivity  in  southern  Tajikistan,  enhance  people\u2019s \naccess to socioeconomic opportunities, and reduce local dust pollution. \n \n7. \nsystem. \nUnderdevelopment of the country\u2019s road network has been compounded by long-standing neglect \nof  road  maintenance,  with  insufficient  budget  allocations  and  an  absence  of  a  well-developed \nRAMS. The annual budget for routine road maintenance throughout the year and snow removal \nduring winter seasons has risen from TJS34.0 million in 2010 to TJS73.2 million in 2020. However, \nthis accounts for only about 0.1% of GDP, and is insufficient to cover actual needs. Given the \nresource  constraints,  several  development  partners,  including  ADB,  have  assisted  the \ngovernment in optimizing the use of limited resources and eliminating the inefficiencies arising \nfrom mechanical allocation of the budget. With ADB support, the country has introduced a RAMS \nand piloted performance-based road maintenance.9 The pilot revealed several issues that need \nto be overcome prior to expanding such schemes: (i) strengthening the government\u2019s capacity for \nproper implementation, (ii) strengthening local contractors\u2019 capacities to carry out maintenance, \nand (iii) pursuing flexibility in contracting schemes. To overcome such challenges in a step-wise \nmanner, the government, with support from ADB, is developing a RAMS Action Program that will \ninstitutionalize a RAMS and establish a dedicated road maintenance fund to secure budget for \nroad maintenance. The government is expected to approve the RAMS Action Program in 2020. \nA dedicated RAMS unit is expected to be established by the end of 2020 to implement the RAMS \nAction Program, while the road maintenance fund will be established by June 2024.  \n \n8. \nCritical  need  to  improve  road  safety.  The  World  Health  Organization  estimates  that \nthere were 1,577 fatalities from road crashes in 2016, which equates to 18.1 fatalities per 100,000 \n\nasset  management \n\nto  operationalize \n\nImmediate  need \n\nroad \n\n \n\n5  Global Data Lab: GDL Area Profiles (accessed 3 October 2020). \n6  Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport (Road Transport [Nonurban]) (accessible from the list of linked documents \n\nin Appendix 2).  \n\n7  The traffic volume of each section was counted in May 2020 by the due diligence consultant (footnote 35). \n8  Rehabilitation  of  the  Bokhtar\u2013Okmazor  section  is  planned  after  the  project  to  complete  the  entire  corridor.  The \nDangara\u2013Kangurt section was rehabilitated in 2014 with financial assistance from the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n9  ADB. 2013.

Manila. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fpeople.10 Costs associated with road crashes equate to about 4.3% of Tajikistan\u2019s GDP.11 These \nfigures are slightly higher than those of other CAREC member countries.12 This suggests a need \nto  raise  people\u2019s  awareness  of  road  safety,  promote  behavioral  change,  and  embed  crash \nprevention  measures  in  road  infrastructure  and  roadside  facilities.  Under  the  ongoing  projects \n(footnote  6),  ADB  has  supported  the  MOT  in  developing  guidelines  on  safe  road  design  and \nrectifying  black  spots  on  selected  national  roads.  The  guidelines  were  developed  in  line  with \ninternational best practices collated through CAREC.13 \n \nAddressing disaster risk. Tajikistan is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate \n9. \nchange in Central Asia. Its unique terrain, geology, and hydrological features make it prone to \nnatural  disasters  and  hazards.  Specific  to  the  project  area,  the  climate  change  assessment \nidentified  rising  temperatures  and  intense  precipitation  as  major  potential  causes  of  extreme \nclimate events, such as landslides and mudflows.14 Climate adaptation features were therefore \nincorporated into the design of the project roads. \n \n10. \nAlignment  with  government  strategies.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s \nNational Development Strategy, which targets sustainable economic growth of Tajikistan.15 The \nproject is also in line with the Transport Sector Master Plan,16 developed with ADB assistance in \n2011  as  the  basis  for  the  government\u2019s  strategic  sector  planning.  The  project  will  contribute \ndirectly to the State Program on Transport Sector Development, 2010\u20132025,17 which includes a \nlist of short-, medium-, and long-term investments that is regularly reviewed and updated, and \naims to further the country\u2019s transport sector development by enhancing the efficiencies of various \ntransport modes, maximizing the country\u2019s transit potential, and increasing the competitiveness \nof  transport  services.  Furthermore,  the  project  will  address  climate  vulnerability  (para.  9)  in \naccordance  with  Tajikistan\u2019s  Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contribution,18 which  emphasizes \nthe need for incorporating climate adaptation measures in the design of transport infrastructure. \nThe  project  also  supports  the  United  Nations\u2019  Vienna  Programme  of  Action  for  Landlocked \nDeveloping Countries for the Decade of 2014\u20132024.19 \n \nStrategic fit. The project is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.20 It supports four of \n11. \nthe  strategy\u2019s  seven  operational  priorities:  (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing \ninequalities (para. 36); (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality (para. 37); (iii) tackling climate \nchange,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability \n(para. 26); and (iv) fostering regional cooperation and integration, prioritizing countries that face \ngeographic and disaster-related vulnerabilities (paras. 9 and 12).

The  project  will  contribute  to  the  goals  of  CAREC \n12. \n203023 and  the  CAREC  Transport  Strategy  2030  by  improving  connectivity  and  improving  the \ncompetitiveness of key national roads that connect to international corridors (para. 6).24 In 2019, \nTajikistan acceded to the Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Goods by \nRoad.  With  the  support  of  ADB,  Tajikistan  has  promoted  national  single  window  systems  that \nhave increased trade volumes and diversified products transported along the country\u2019s roads.25 \nThe project will help accelerate the momentum for turning southern Tajikistan into an international \nand domestic transit and business hub. \n \n13. \nLessons.  Lessons  from  previous  and  ongoing  projects  (footnote  6)  include:  (i)  the \naccuracy  of  engineering  designs  and  cost  estimates  for  road  infrastructure  and  associated \nfacilities should be ensured during project appraisal, (ii) executing and implementation agencies \nshould have a proper understanding of ADB\u2019s procurement procedures and requirements, and \n(iii) developing a RAMS is an urgent need for Tajikistan\u2019s road transport subsector to sustain the \nquality of the improved international highway network. \n \nImpact  of  coronavirus  disease.  The  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  has \n14. \nweakened  Tajikistan\u2019s  economy  and  increased  unemployment  and  poverty.  In  response  to \nCOVID-19,  the  government  imposed  a  nationwide  lockdown  that  lasted  about  2  months,  with \nclosures of all airports. Overseas remittances, international trade, and foreign direct investment \nall declined.26 Food prices increased.27 The pandemic has exacerbated the many socioeconomic \nchallenges in the project area, which relies heavily on external support being delivered via the \nexisting road network. The project-supported road improvements will be essential to reversing the \nrecent economic downward trend. Measures are in place to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on \nproject implementation. Under the project, civil works will commence in early 2021, by which time \nit  is  expected  that  the  spread  of  COVID-19  will  have  subsided  because  of  the  government\u2019s \ncontinuing response measures. However, if the spread of COVID-19 continues and domestic and \ninternational  travel  remain  restricted,  the  MOT  and  the  Project  Implementation  Unit  for  Roads \nRehabilitation  (PIURR:  the  project\u2019s  implementation  agency)  will  enact  measures  to  steadily \nmobilize resources at a reduced pace, so that construction works can continue without threatening \nthe health and safety of construction workers. After completion, the improved project roads will \nplay an essential role in delivering basic needs and reviving the economy in the project area. \n \n\n \n\n21 ADB. 2016.

The project will have the following outcome: safety and reliability of road network improved \nin southern Tajikistan.28  \n \n16. \nOutput  1:  Roads  in  southern  Tajikistan  improved.  This  output  will  consist  of  \n(i)  rehabilitating  the  two-lane  road  sections  Dangara\u2013Okmazor  (28.7  km)  and  Hulbuk\u2013Kangurt \n(59.5 km) on their existing alignments, and (ii) carrying out a road-safety-awareness campaign \nfor  roadside  residents.  The  two  road  sections  will  be  rehabilitated  following  their  existing \nclassifications based on SNIPs.29 The classification of the Dangara\u2013Okmazor section is category \nIII (road width of 3.5 meters [m] for each lane and 2.5 m paved shoulders). The Hulbuk\u2013Kangurt \nsection  will  be  split  at  Temurmalik  into  two  subsections:  the  Hulbuk\u2013Temurmalik  section  is \ncategory III,  while  Temurmalik\u2013Kangurt section  is  category IV  (width  of 3 m for  each  lane  and  \n2 m paved shoulders). The average travel speed on project road sections is expected to increase \nfrom 58 km per hour to 73 km per hour.  \n \n17. \nOutput 2: Road asset management system database developed. This output will be \naligned  with  the  MOT\u2019s  RAMS  Action  Program  (para.  7)  and  will  support  the  MOT  in \noperationalizing its RAMS by developing a data inventory of the country\u2019s arterial highways. The \nMOT maintains no comprehensive inventory, making it difficult to estimate maintenance needs \nand plan the optimal use of available resources. ADB has coordinated with development partners \nin  developing  a  framework  for  a  RAMS  database. 30 An  international  consultancy  firm  will  be \nrecruited to help the RAMS unit to collect condition data for the selected highways. The firm will \nprovide  hands-on  training  to  the  RAMS  unit  staff  on  (i)  preparing  formats  for  data  collection,  \n(ii)  carrying  out  road  condition  surveys,  (iii)  validating  the  collected  data  for  entering  into  the \ndatabase, and (iv) analyzing the data as the basis for annual and multiyear planning. \n \n18. \nOutput 3: Women\u2019s access to socioeconomic opportunities enhanced. This output \nwill  promote  women\u2019s  participation  in  economic  activities  in  the  project  area  through  three \ncomponents: \nimplementing  a  knowledge  distribution  program  on \nentrepreneurship and household financial management, (ii) providing skills training on business \ndevelopment  and  income-generation  activities  in  areas  of  high  business  demand,  and  \n(iii) facilitating local women\u2019s access to grants for starting new business. A local consulting firm \nwill help implement the output in coordination with the National Committee of Women and Family \nAffairs. As part of the first component, mobile phone applications or short message services will \nbe devised to distribute the contents of the knowledge distribution program, enabling local women \nto obtain information at their convenience.31 Supplementary workshops will be held regularly to \nrecap the knowledge distributed and foster mutual-aid networks among the participants. \n \n19. \nLessons  from  previous  and  ongoing  projects  (para.  13)  were  taken  into  account  in  the \ndesign of outputs 1\u20133. Civil works cost estimates were based on the detailed engineering design \n\n(i)  designing  and \n\n \n\n28 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n29 SNIP is the construction norms and standards that were developed during the Soviet period. \n30 The MOT received technical and financial assistance in developing a framework for a RAMS database from ADB. \n2016.

During appraisal, ADB held a \nprocurement  workshop  to  staff  of  the  MOT  and  PIURR  to  enhance  their  knowledge  of  ADB\u2019s \nprocurement guidelines and policies. To ensure the effectiveness of output 2, ADB has facilitated \ndialogue  among  government  agencies  and  other  financiers  on  the  development  of  the  MOT\u2019s \nRAMS. \n \nC. \n \nThe  project  will  build  on  ADB\u2019s  successful  implementation  of  various  road  projects  in \n20. \nTajikistan.  First,  the  project  will  ensure  that  adequate  features  on  climate  change  adaptation, \ndisaster risk management, and road safety are incorporated into the engineering design. Second, \nthe  project  will  help  accelerate  the  government\u2019s  ongoing  RAMS-related  initiatives  that  are \nsupported by ADB. The project will help enhance the functionality of the RAMS database, which \nis being developed in accordance with the RAMS Action Program (para. 7). Third, the project will \nintroduce gender-inclusive measures as outlined in the gender action plan by incorporating the \nneeds of women residing along the project roads.32 ADB is the largest development partner in \nTajikistan\u2019s  transport  sector  and  has  been  actively  involved  in  coordinating  with  development \npartners to improve the country\u2019s transport networks and introduce the RAMS (footnote 3). \n \nD. \n \n21. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $72.93  million  (Table  1).

The rehabilitation of roads will be carried out along existing rights-of-way\n26.\n(without  involving  expansion)  as  road  widths  have  been  confirmed  to  be  sufficient  to\naccommodate  the  anticipated  increases  in  traffic  volumes.  Asphalt  concrete  surfacing  will  be\nused,  and  its  design  was  confirmed  to  suit  existing  roadbed  soil  conditions  and  to  be  able  to\nwithstand  the  forecasted  traffic  load.  The  engineering  design  will  incorporate  climate-resilient\nfeatures to sustain the quality of the project roads and roadside facilities during their design life.\nSuch features are incorporated in the design of retaining walls, drainages and ditches based on\nthe  possibility  of  extreme  precipitation  and  subsequent  landslides  or  mudflows  in the  next  100\nyears. Roadside facilities such as shoulders, sidewalks, and lighting will be improved or newly\ninstalled to ensure road users\u2019 safety and comfort. These features have been selected in close\ncoordination with local traffic police.\n\nB.\n\nEconomic and Financial Viability\n\n27.\nThe  economic  evaluation  of  the  project  has  been  undertaken  using  the  highway\ndevelopment and management model, in accordance with ADB guidelines.34 The due diligence\nconsultant obtained traffic volumes for the evaluation in May 2020.35 An economic evaluation was\nmade for each road section, and these were combined to confirm the project\u2019s overall economic\nviability.  The  incremental  benefits  of  reductions  in  vehicle  operating  costs,  travel  times,  and\nemissions were compared with the capital costs and changes in operation and maintenance costs\nover a 27-year appraisal period, comprising 2 years for civil works and 25 years  for operation.\nRoad safety benefits were excluded from the analysis since credible data was not available. All\nproject benefits were expressed in 2020 economic prices, in United States dollars, using the world\nprice numeraire.\n\n28.\nThe results indicate that the combined project is economically viable, with an economic\ninternal  rate  of  return  of  15.7%,  a  benefit\u2013cost  ratio  of  1.9,  and  a  net  present  value  of  $46.4\nmillion.36 Sensitivity tests confirmed that the combined project would remain feasible should the\nenvisaged project costs increase by 20% or benefits decline by 20%.37\n\nC.\n\nSustainability\n\nThe  project  roads  will  not  be  tolled  and  will  not generate  revenue.  After civil  works  are\n29.\ncompleted, they will be maintained under the government\u2019s maintenance program. The required\nroutine maintenance expenditure for the project roads will total about $1,900 per km per year after\ncompletion.  The  current  budget  allocation  for  the  country\u2019s  road  network  will  barely  cover  this\nroutine maintenance, let alone the additional periodic maintenance that will be required every 5\u2013\n7  years.  Insufficient  maintenance  funds  is  by  far  the  most  serious  issue  threatening  the\nsustainability of the project roads.\n\n34 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n35 The  incumbent  construction  supervision  consultant  (CSC)  under  an  ongoing  project\u2014the  Central  Asia  Regional \nEconomic Cooperation Corridors 2, 5, and 6 (Dushanbe\u2013Kurgonteppa) Road Project\u2014assisted the MOT in carrying \nout due diligence for the project. \n\n36 The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for Dangara\u2013Okmazor section is 24.5%, while the EIRR for the Hulbuk\u2013\n\nKangurt section is 9.0%. \n\n37 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f9 \n\nTo  tackle  these  long-standing  challenges,  the  government,  in  parallel  with  its  effort  to\n30.\nsecure  more  budget  resources  for  road  maintenance,  has  redoubled  its  efforts  to  establish  a\nRAMS  through  its  5-year  RAMS  Action  Program  (para.  7).  The  program  clearly  outlines  the\nfollowing directions to transform the country\u2019s road maintenance system: (i) establishing a RAMS\nunit  within the MOT  with  the  sole responsibility  to  implement the  program;  (ii)  streamlining the\nbudgetary system by establishing a dedicated road maintenance fund to secure budget funds for\nroad maintenance; and (iii) building a database to store the profiles of international and national\nroads,  which  will  help  the  government  identify  needs  for  timely  maintenance  and  program  the\nannual  maintenance  plan  and  budget.  The  project  will  directly  contribute  to  item  (iii).\nImplementation of the RAMS Action Program is expected to be completed by 2024\u2014the year of\nthis project\u2019s scheduled completion. Thus, by the time of project completion, the MOT will have\nimproved  its  fiscal  and  institutional  capacity  to  meet  recurrent  expenditures  and  adequately\noperate and maintain the project roads over the economic life of the project.38\n\nD.\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial management. The due diligence consultant (footnote 35) undertook a financial\n31.\nmanagement assessment of the PIURR in June 2020, confirming that its financial management\narrangement is appropriate to implement the project in compliance with ADB requirements. The\nassessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial because of the PIURR\u2019s existing\nfinancial  management  system,  which  remains  the  same  from  the  previous  assessment.  The\nPIURR has built on its experience implementing ADB-financed projects, and improvements have\nbeen made with an adequate accounting manual in place and accounting software (1C)39 fully\noperationalized.  PIURR\u2019s  residual  weaknesses  in  financial  management  are  (i)  insufficient\nfinancial management skills, including limited technical capacity and experience to transition to\nInternational  Financial  Reporting  Standards;  (ii)  inadequate  formalization  of  operational\nprocedures, including no explicit policy to report inappropriate asset management; (iii) absence\nof  internal  audit  function;  and  (iv)  an  unintegrated  accounting  system.  To  mitigate  such\nweaknesses, the PIURR will (i) hire adequately qualified and skilled financial management staff\nto support the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards and undertake training on\nfinancial management, (ii) develop and implement a comprehensive operations manual, (iii) bring\nitself within the scope of the MOT\u2019s internal audit process in consultation with the MOT and MOF,\nand (iv) accelerate the integration of the accounting system. The PIURR will maintain adequate\nand  separate  project  records  and  accounts,  which  will  be  audited  annually  by  independent\nauditors.\n\nProcurement. ADB prepared an updated project procurement risk assessment (PPRA)\n32.\nin June 2020 in accordance with ADB guidelines.40 The PPRA examined the PIURR\u2019s capacity\nwith  regard  to  organization  and  staffing,  information  management,  procurement  practices,\ncomplaint and dispute resolution mechanisms, and accountability measures. The updated PPRA\nconcluded  that  the  procurement  risk  is  moderate  because  (i)  a  growing  portfolio  of  externally\nfunded projects may stretch the staffing resources of the PIURR, (ii) record management systems\nand  procedures  have  been  paper-based,  and  need  to  be  improved  by  introducing  electronic\nsystems,  and  (iii)  the  PIURR  lacks  adequate  internal  procurement  and  contract  administration\nguidelines and manuals to refer to during project implementation, which may cause ad hoc and\n\n38 Tolling options will be developed together with the preparation of priority and viable tolling projects under ADB. 2019. \nReport and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to the Republic of Tajikistan: \nfor the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridors 2, 3, and 5 (Obigarm\u2013Nurobod) Road Project. Manila. \n\n39 1C is an international accounting software which is widely used in the Commonwealth of Independent States. \n40 Based on the PPRA carried out for a previous project approved in 2019 (footnote 38). \n\n\f10 \n\ninconsistent responses. The PPRA concluded that, if these issues are addressed, the PIURR has \nsufficient procurement capacity to implement the project. \n\n33.\nThe strategy guiding procurement for the project has been to define works packaging that\nwill  allow  local  contractors  to  bid  for  at  least  one  contract  without  discouraging  international\ncontractors  to  bid  for  that  or  other  contracts.  Thus,  for  the  civil  works,  procurement  will  be\nconducted for two contract packages (one with two lots for the Hulbuk\u2013Kangurt section, and the\nother with one lot for Dangara\u2013Okmazor section) through open competitive bidding using the one-\nstage,  two-envelope  method,  with  each  contract  to  be  awarded  to  the  lowest  evaluated\nsubstantially  responsive bidder.  For the  consultant  services  under the  project, the  quality-  and\ncost-based selection approach (90% for quality and 10% for cost) will be used for outputs 1 and\n2, and fixed budget selection will be used for output 3. The advertisements for all contracts will be\nposted in the third and fourth quarters of 2020.\n\n34.\nInstitutional capacity. The MOT and PIURR have an adequate understanding of ADB\u2019s\npolicies  and  guidelines  on  procurement  and  consultant  recruitment,  safeguards,  and  financial\nmanagement,  based  on  their  2  decades  of  experience  implementing  ADB-supported  transport\nprojects.  The  PIURR  will  be  assisted  during  implementation  by  the  construction  supervision\nconsultant (CSC) for output 1, implementation support consultants for outputs 2 and 3, and the\nrelevant MOT departments. ADB will continue to assist the MOT and PIURR to ensure that the\nproject will be implemented in accordance with relevant ADB policies and procedures.\n\nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained\n35.\nto and discussed with the government, the MOT, and the PIURR. The specific policy requirements\nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM.\n\nE.\n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender\n\n36. With  help  of  the  due  diligence  consultant,  the  government  carried  out  socioeconomic\nsurveys  and  a  gender  assessment  in  May\u2013July  2020  to  identify  the  issues  and  needs  of  the\npopulation, including women, residing along the project roads.41 The project area is in the poorest\nand most populous oblast in the country (para. 5). The majority of the population along the project\nroads are engaged in the informal economy, mainly farming activities and/or selling agricultural\ncommodities  (cotton,  vegetables,  and  fruits)  or  hand-made  products  at  markets.  Such  an\neconomic structure has been observed as being vulnerable to external shocks like COVID-19.42\nImproving the  project  roads  will help  attract  external  traders from  outside  the  project  area  and\nboost and diversify trade to generate more economic opportunities in a sustainable manner. The\nproject roads and roadside facilities will reduce road traffic fatalities and injuries, and will improve\nthe comfort and reliability of road travel for all users.43\n\nThe  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  project  will  address\n37.\ngender issues identified through group discussions focused on women during project preparation.\nIt was confirmed that women residing along the project roads are concerned about inadequate\nroad  safety  measures  on  the  project  roads  and  limited  opportunities  to  participate  in  the  local\n\n41 Socioeconomic surveys were carried out using a structured questionnaire with 332 households along the Hulbuk\u2013\nKangurt section and 107 households along the Dangara\u2013Okmazor section, of which 16.6% were female respondents. \nIn addition, 300 women were interviewed during focus group discussions using semi-structured questionnaires. \n42 The median daily income among those surveyed was TJS66.67 (equivalent to $6.47) for the Hulbuk\u2013Kangurt section \nand TJS50 (equivalent to $4.85) for the Dangara\u2013Okmazor section; both figures are lower than the oblast\u2019s gross \nnational income of $9.53 (2018 figure, footnote 5). \n\n43 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f11 \n\neconomy.  The  gender  action  plan  (footnote  32)  will  include  provisions  that  (i)  support  gender-\nresponsive  and  socially  inclusive  features  to  be  included  in  the  project  roads  and  roadside \nfacilities,  such  as  rest  areas  and  bus  stops  equipped  with  gender-separated  spaces;  and  (ii) \nfacilitate  the  distribution  of  knowledge  and  resources  to  enhance  women\u2019s  access  to \nsocioeconomic opportunities and strengthen their economic status. The CSC will employ a gender \nspecialist  to  help  the  PIURR  implement  item  (i),  while  a  local  consultant  will  be  recruited  to \nimplement  item  (ii).  These  consultants  will  be  responsible  for  periodically  monitoring  and \ndocumenting implementation progress against the gender action plan. \n\nF.\n\nSafeguards\n\n38.\ncategories are as follows.44\n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard\n\n39.\nEnvironment (category B). The draft initial environmental examinations for both project\nroads with environmental management plans were disclosed in September 2020. The draft initial\nenvironmental examinations confirmed that there will be only insignificant environmental impacts,\nwhich can be either avoided or adequately mitigated. During construction, temporary, site-specific\nimpacts  may  arise  from  construction  works,  and  from  mining  and  hauling  of  construction\nmaterials. These impacts include dust and noise pollution, waste and equipment on local roads,\nand other occupational health and safety hazards. Such impacts will be addressed in site-specific\nenvironmental management plans to be prepared by the civil works contractors after mobilization.\nThe PIURR has appointed a staff member responsible for supervising the project\u2019s compliance\nwith  environmental  safeguards.  No  civil  works  will  be  allowed  before  the  CSC  and  the  PIURR\napprove the site-specific environmental management plans. All statutory permits and clearances\nwill  be  obtained  prior  to  the  awarding  of  the  works  contracts.  Stakeholder  engagement  and\nconsultations  will  continue  throughout  implementation.  A  grievance  redress mechanism  will  be\nestablished to handle any project-related grievances or complaints, which the CSC will monitor\nand  document.  The  MOT  will  submit  biannual  environmental  monitoring  reports  during\nimplementation.\n\n40.\nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). Civil works will generally follow alignments within\nexisting rights-of-way. Impacts will generally be limited to loss of marginal portions of agricultural,\nresidential, and commercial land; fences; secondary structures; and trees. Project works will affect\n18 people and two legal entities along the Dangara\u2013Okmazor section and 371 people and 8 legal\nentities along the Hulbuk\u2013Kangurt section. Of these, eight business owners and two farmers are\nconsidered severely affected. The eight business owners will lose commercial structures and the\ntwo  farmers  will  lose  more  than  10%  of  their  dehkan  farms. 45 All  other  affected  persons  are\nconsidered  marginally  affected.  The  MOT  conducted  detailed  measurement,  census,  and\nsocioeconomic surveys, and prepared draft land acquisition and resettlement plans (LARPs) for\nboth road sections based on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and Tajikistan regulations. The\nMOT submitted the LARPs to ADB and they were disclosed on the ADB website in September\n2020.  The  LARPs  will  be  finalized  after  independent  valuations  are  completed  and  follow-up\nconsultations are held.46\n\n44 ADB.
