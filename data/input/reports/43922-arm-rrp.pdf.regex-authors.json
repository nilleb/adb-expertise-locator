I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Armenia International Airports (ArIA) for the Zvartnots Airport Expansion Project (Phase 2). \nThe project will finance the construction of a new landside terminal building and the purchase of \nequipment to supplement the existing airside concourse building. It will increase the passenger-\nhandling capacity of the Zvartnots International Airport (ZIA) to about 3.2 million a year from the \ncurrent  level  of  1.8  million\u20132.0  million  a  year.  The  project  will  be  the  first  private  sector \ninfrastructure investment by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Armenia or the Caucasus \nregion.  \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  Project Identification and Selection \n2.  Before the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, ZIA, which was built in the 1960s in \nYerevan, operated as a domestic airport. All arrivals to and departures from the former Soviet \nUnion took place through Moscow. After 1991, ZIA assumed a critical role for Armenia as the \nmost important gateway to the country. However, from 1991 to 2001, capital expenditure for \nexpansion and modernization was minimal, despite the significant need for upgrading. Since \n2002, significant investments to modernize the airport have been made, but there remains a \ncritical need for further upgrading of the passenger terminal to bring it up to international \nstandards and to enable it to cater to the expected increase in aviation traffic to and from \nArmenia. The project is the final phase of the modernization and expansion of ZIA. Upon \ncompletion of the project, ZIA will relocate all its operations from the old airport terminal to the \nnew facilities, which will increase passenger comfort and the speed of passenger processing, \nprovide a wider scope of commercial and aeronautical services, and bring the facilities up to \ninternational standards in terms of safety, security and environmental aspects. \n \nB.  Sector Background \n3.  Armenia has a population of about 3.2 million and a total area of about 29,800 square \nkilometers. Given its landlocked location, civil aviation plays a crucial role in the economy. \nFurther underscoring the importance of this sector, Armenia has restricted use of its southern \nborder due to extreme climatic conditions. There is a very limited railway system in Armenia and \nthe road infrastructure is in urgent need of fresh investment. As a result, Armenia is largely \ndependent on air transportation for cross-border movement of passengers. Additionally, with an \nestimated strength of 7 million, the Armenian diaspora is one of the largest groups of its kind in \nthe world and has a marked impact on the travel market, since members of the diaspora have \nstrong social and economic ties with the country and frequently travel to it.  \n \n4.  Although this is the first ADB involvement in the civil aviation sector in Armenia, the ADB \nCentral and West Asia Department has had significant engagement in the transport sector in \nArmenia, particularly in roads projects as shown in the table below.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "2   \nDetails of ADB Assistance in the Armenian Transport Sector \n($'000) \n    Commitment \nProject  Approval Date  Amount \nA.

A recent ADB technical report on the transport sector development strategy1 in Armenia \nunderscored the need for development and investments in a number of areas in the transport \nsector  in  general  and  in  airports  and  civil  aviation  in  particular.  The  report  recommended \nstrengthening institutional capacity, governance, and legislation, as well as a tourism-specific \nstrategy to eliminate transport impediments. For airports and civil aviation, the primary goal is \nthe development of competitively priced air services providing extensive connections through \nefficient airports. The report also recommended that the strategy should include a national \naviation system plan (which would address, among others, the need for new runway and \nterminal infrastructure, the feasibility of reopening airports,  passenger demand assessment, \nand  the  introduction  of  a  new  Armenian  carrier),  and  identify  the  re-equipment  needs  of \nArmenian Air Traffic Services (the state-owned entity responsible for providing air traffic control, \nnavigation, and aeronautical information services in the airspace of Armenia).   \n \n6.  The  Armenian  aviation  sector  experienced  significant  structural  changes  after  the \nbreakup of the Soviet Union. Until 1991, it was a part of the former Soviet Union's centralized \neconomy, and air fares were subsidized. As a result, traffic levels within the former Soviet Union \nwere very high and passenger traffic to and from Yerevan reached 2.5 million just before the \nbreakup of the Soviet Union. Following the independence of Armenia, subsidies were withdrawn \nfrom air fares and traffic to and from Yerevan collapsed to just over 0.5 million passengers in \n2000. However, growth in passenger traffic resumed in 2001 and currently stands at over 1.4 \nmillion.  \n \n7.  Recognizing the critical importance of the aviation sector, the Government of Armenia \nhas taken a proactive role in attracting fresh investment. Modernization of ZIA started in 1994, \nwith  EBRD  (European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development)  providing  a  sovereign \nguaranteed loan to the former Zvartnots Airport Company (ZAC), a state-owned airport entity, to \nconstruct a new air cargo terminal. The cargo terminal was completed in 1999 and provides a \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Transport Sector Development Strategy. Consultant's report. Manila (TA 4973-ARM). \n ", "  3   \nhigh-quality facility suitable for any modern airport (it has a capacity of 60,000\u201380,000 tons a \nyear, with the possibility of an expansion to 110,000 tons).  Under the terms of the EBRD loan, \nZAC was obliged to tender for a private sector manager to take over its cargo operations. The \ntendering process was conducted in 1998, but failed to elicit any meaningful private sector \nresponse. In 2000 the EBRD commissioned an external team of experts from British Aerospace \n(BAe) to review the overall situation.  \n \n8.  The conclusion of the BAe experts was that the most feasible option would be to involve \na  private  investor  to  run  the  entire  airport  area,  combined  with  additional  development \nopportunities to be provided by the creation of a free trade zone.  They also indicated that, in \nview of the generally difficult economic situation in Armenia, the proposed investment might be \nof interest only to a limited number of investors, most likely of Armenian origin, with a longer-\nterm investment perspective. They therefore recommended direct approaches and negotiations \nrather than an open tender for the concession award. In line with the BAe recommendations, in \nDecember 2001 the government negotiated a concession agreement with Corporacion America, \nan Argentinean company controlled by Eduardo Eurnekian (an Argentinean citizen of Armenian \ndescent). In order to implement this concession agreement, ownership of the airport assets was \ntransferred from ZAC to full state ownership, after which the airport concession was granted to \nCorporacion America on an exclusive basis for the management of the entire airport operation \nfor 30 years. The concession agreement became effective in May 2002. Following the granting \nof the concession, Corporacion America transferred the concession rights to ArIA, its affiliate \nand a special purpose Armenian company. Subsequently EBRD, along with DEG (Deutsche \nInvestitions-und Entwicklungsgesellchaft), financed phase 1 of the modernization of ZIA.  \n \n9.  The concession agreement grants ArIA the right to be the manager and airport authority, \nand the government's control over ArIA's operations in certain specific areas is regulated by \nArmenian  legislation.  The  General  Department  of  Civil  Aviation  (GDCA),  an  adjunct  body \noperating under the government, oversees the safety and security aspects of the airport's \noperations. It has the authority to establish terms and restrictions for the use of the airport for \nsafety  reasons,  ensure  that  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO)  security \nrequirements are met, and to carry out inspections and observations for the purpose of ensuring \ncompliance with the ICAO requirements. The Ministry of Environment conducts environmental \noversight. In addition, the GDCA regulates and supervises the operations of other major players \nin the civil aviation sector: Armavia, the national carrier, and Armenia Air Traffic Services. There \nis, therefore, a significant concentration of power with the GDCA, which is responsible for \nsetting procedures and technical regulations, and is also directly involved in the day-to-day \noperations of these companies. Any future reform process will have to consider the potential of \nreorganizing the GDCA directly under the Ministry of Transport and Communication, and setting \nup an independent regulatory body in its place (footnote 1).  \n \n10.  Under  the  concession  agreement,  ArIA  has  the  right  to  propose  adjustments  to \naeronautical tariffs from time to time, in order to ensure that it receives the stipulated internal \nrate of return under the concession. Any tariff revision requires approval by the government, as \ndetermined  by  an  intergovernmental  committee  comprising  representatives  of  various \ngovernment agencies. The process of approval of aeronautical tariffs is closely coordinated by \nthe GDCA.  \n \n ", "4   \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n11.  The project is consistent with ADB's Strategy 2020 which identifies infrastructure as one \nof ADB's five core areas.2 ADB will invest in key civil aviation infrastructure in Armenia to \nstrengthen  transportation  and  connectivity  between  Armenian  and  other  countries.  Under \nStrategy 2020, ADB's infrastructure operations will emphasize public\u2013private partnerships and \nprivate sector engagement, which is consistent with the project. Under Strategy 2020, regional \nintegration is one of ADB's three complementary strategic agendas. The project will directly \npromote regional integration by improving air connectivity between Armenia and other countries. \n \n2.  Consistency with the Country Strategy \n12.  The project is in line with ADB's economic report and interim operational strategy 2006\u2013\n2009 for Armenia3 as well as ADB's country operations business plan 2008\u201320104 for Armenia. \nThe economic report and interim operational strategy identifies, among others, the promotion of \nthe private sector and enhancement of regional cooperation as ADB's strategic priorities. The \nproject is consistent with two of the principles underlying the economic report and interim \noperational strategy: (i) being selective in determining initial operational areas and focusing on \ndelivering  swift  results,  and  (ii)  partnering  with  other  development  agencies  to  exploit  the \ninstitutional  infrastructure.  The  country  operations  business  plan  envisages  transport  and \ncommunications  interventions,  focusing  on  modernizing  international  transport  corridors  to \nenhance trade and business opportunities. The project is consistent with this focus. The project \nwill be completed within 3 years and will provide immediate benefits by improving Armenia's civil \naviation infrastructure and air connectivity. The project is being financed as a response to the \neconomic crisis, with ADB working in close collaboration with the EBRD and DEG to ensure \nspeedy financing and implementation of the project.  \n \nIII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Description \n1.  The Shareholder, Sponsor, and Borrower  \na.  Shareholder and Sponsor \n13.  ArIA is currently 100% owned by American International Airports (AIA), a Delaware- \nregistered holding company created in 2002 with the objective of conducting airport-related \nactivities. AIA is the sponsor and operates out of New York and is indirectly owned by Southern \nCone Foundation (SCF), an entity incorporated in Liechtenstein. The ultimate owner of AIA, \nthrough SCF, is Eduardo Eurnekian, an Argentinean of Armenian descent, who has substantial \ninterests in airport management, agriculture, energy and fuel distribution, pharmaceuticals, real \nestate, beverages and media.  \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2008.

ArIA was established in May 2002 to implement the concession agreement signed by \nthe Republic of Armenia and Corporacion America. In 2006, in accordance with a master plan \nagreed  with  the  government  under  the  concession  agreement,  ArIA  began  phase  1 \nmodernization program for ZIA, which envisaged the construction of a new passenger terminal \nbuilding to house arrivals and an increase in the overall airport capacity.  This phase was \ncompleted in May 2007 and was financed by EBRD and DEG. The new arrivals terminal is now \nfully operational.  \n \n15.  Following completion of the new terminal, ArIA exercised its right, granted under the \nexisting concession agreement, to extend the concession to the Gyumri airport, the second \nlargest airport in Armenia. Gyumri airport is a small airport serving only the Commonwealth of \nIndependent States market, but it is of strategic importance as a relief airport for ZIA during the \nwinter, when dense fog in ZIA often forces it to close for 2 to 3 days at a time.  The Gyumri \nrunway rehabilitation works were completed in early 2008 and ArIA now operates Gyumri jointly \nwith ZIA. Following a review of traffic forecasts and an update of the master plan at the end of \n2007, the government and ArIA decided to proceed with the second and final phase of terminal \ndevelopment at ZIA. \n \n16.  ArIA relies heavily on expertise available within the AIA group. AIA is committed to \nsupporting new investments in ZIA through equity infusion. In addition, AIA provides ArIA with \nmanagerial support in overall airport operations, ground handling and maintenance activities.  \nAIA also supports ArIA by formulating business plans, negotiating with local and government \nbodies, maintaining relationships with public bodies and institutions, providing financial planning \nand developing sources of funding. AIA also acts as ArIA's interface in negotiating with airlines \nand freight operators in order to attract them to Armenia. It supports ArIA with training and by \nproviding qualified personnel from its pool of international expertise. AIA provides extensive \nsupport for the administration of commercial and services-related activities in ZIA.  \n \n2.  Project Design \n17.  The  project  envisages  the  construction  of  a  new  landside  terminal  building  and \ninstallation of equipment and facilities to supplement the airside concourse that was built during \nphase 1 of the modernization program. This new terminal, which will house separate departure \nand arrival halls, will replace the existing terminal (built during the Soviet era) and house the \nfunctions previously based there. The design is expected to lead to a simpler and more efficient \noperational layout, allowing for planned growth in the future if needed. Together with the existing \narrivals and departure building in the airside terminal, the project will provide enhanced levels of \nservice and comfort for passengers (reducing walking distances and optimizing passenger \ncirculation flows). Upon completion of the project, the passenger handling capacity of ZIA is \nexpected to increase to 3.2 million per annum from the current 1.8\u20132.0 million. \n \n18.  The  new  terminal  building  is  a  two-level  system  separating  arriving  and  departing \npassengers and their respective processing areas. The new check-in hall will be equipped with \ncounters fitted with common user terminal equipment technology and self-check in kiosks. The \ncheck-in system will be connected to a new outbound baggage system taking luggage to \ncarousels in the basement, where security personnel will use customs clearance scanners, new \nX-ray equipment and tomographers to analyze it.  The project also includes a new multilevel \nvehicle parking area in front of the arrival hall. Because Yerevan is located in one of the most \nactive seismic regions in Armenia, the proposed terminal building will be based on the latest \n ", "6   \nseismic structural designs. The project design, which forms a part of the overall master plan for \nthe development of ZIA, complies with the standards and recommended practices of ICAO and \nthe  International  Air  Transport  Association  (IATA).  The  project  will  also  provide  a  strong \ndemonstration  of  best  practice  in  the  area  of  energy  management  and  environmentally \nsustainable  design.  It  utilizes  several  elements  of  best  available  techniques  for  energy \nperformance of building infrastructure and service equipment.  \n  \n3.  Project Outputs and Outcome \n19.  The project will augment the capacity of ZIA from the current level of 1.8 million\u20132.0 \nmillion passengers a year to about 3.2 million and will streamline and modernize passenger \nhandling and processing systems. When it is completed, Armenia will have a modern airport \nthat  meets  world-class  service,  efficiency  and  safety  standards,  and  high  environmental \nstandards. The proposed new terminal is expected to be significantly less energy-intensive than \nthe departure terminal that it will replace. Efficiencies are expected in almost all areas of \npassenger-handling operations, including the check-in process, arrivals and baggage claims, \nsecurity, immigration and customs control. The project has a significant local cost component, \nwhich will increase the level of activity and employment in the local construction industry during \nthe construction phase. Upon completion of the project, the number of jobs at ZIA is expected to \nincrease by at least 500 in the areas of ground-handling, duty free operations, and other retail \nactivities. \n \n20.  The construction of a modern terminal will enhance passenger comfort and support \noverall growth in civil aviation. The project will support an expected passenger traffic growth of \n3% per annum starting in 2011 (leading to an increase in passenger traffic from the current level \nof  over  1.4  million  to  about  1.7  million  by  2015)  and  corresponding  increases  in  aircraft \nmovements.   \n \nB.  Development Impact \n1.  Contribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n21.  Aviation is a key facilitator of economic growth. The project will meet a vital infrastructure \nneed in the aviation sector of Armenia and contribute to economic growth. Aviation is not only a \nmajor industry in its own right (employing large numbers of highly skilled workers directly and \nindirectly),  but  also  is  essential  for  integrating  a  country  into  the  rapidly  globalizing  world \neconomy. Aviation generates wealth, jobs, taxes and tourism. For a landlocked country such as \nArmenia, strong and efficient aviation infrastructure is particularly significant. More connections \nto the global air transport network can boost productivity and economic growth by providing \nbetter access to markets, enhancing links within and between businesses and providing greater \naccess to resources.5  Air transport acts as an economic catalyst by providing a new and faster \nmechanism for distributing goods and services, contributing to growth in existing industries and \nincreasing overall economic efficiency.  \n \n22.  The project envisages the construction of a state-of-the-art international airport terminal \nin the capital city of Armenia that will meet high levels of service, safety and security in line with \ninternational standards. Upon completion, there will be tangible improvements in the operational \nefficiency of the airport, which, in addition to improving passenger comfort and ease of travel, is \n                                                 \n5  International Air Transport Association. 2007. Summary of Aviation Economic Benefits \u2013 IATA Economics Briefing \nNo. 8. Montreal. \n ", "  7   \nexpected  to  attract  more  airlines  and  encourage  more  frequent  flights.  Armenia's  air \nconnectivity, which is currently one of the worst in the Central Asia and Caucasus region, is \nlikely to get a boost upon completion of the project. Demand for air traffic is also likely to \nincrease in line with overall economic growth. In addition, the new airport terminal will provide \ngreater opportunities for retail activities and create jobs in various related and ancillary sectors. \nThe  greater  economic  activity  resulting  from  increased  connectivity  and  traffic,  as  well  as \ncommercial activities, will have an indirect effect on poverty reduction. The project is also in line \nwith  the  master  plan  agreed  by  ArIA  and  the  government  and  is  consistent  with  the \ngovernment's development plans for the sector.  \n \n2.  Private Sector Development \n23.  The 2002 privatization of ZIA was a successful privatization effort in a key infrastructure \nsector. Since then, significant private capital has been invested in its modernization. The project \nwill augment further private sector investment in the airport development program by supporting \nthe  final  stage  of  its  modernization.  Greater  private  sector  involvement  in  the  airport's \nmanagement will support the government's efforts to bring about efficiency and a high level of \nsafety and security at the airport. Given the project's high profile in Armenia's overall economy, \nit  is  expected  to  play  a  catalytic  role  and  encourage  the  government  to  pursue  similar \nprivatization efforts in other areas. Over the last 8 years of the concession, ArIA has drawn \nheavily upon its affiliates for technical expertise in aviation management and this has been \ngradually  transferred  to  local  employees  and  professionals  (as  can  be  seen  by  ArIA's  \nincreasing reliance on local staff to run airport operations). Direct training and development \nprograms are also provided to local staff by ArIA's affiliates operating in South America. \n \nC.  Environment and Social Dimensions \n1.  Environment \n24.  The potential environmental impacts of the project, as related to its location, construction \nand operation, have been assessed by an initial environmental examination, and were found to \nbe insignificant or temporary. Any environmental impacts of the project can be readily mitigated. \nThe  project  has  been  classified  as  category  B  for  environment  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009).  The project will meet the ICAO and European Aviation \nSafety Agency environmental standards and will upgrade the environmental, health and safety \nstandards  of  the  airport.  Various  impact  mitigation  measures  have  been  included  in  the \nenvironmental management plan, as part of the initial environmental examination (Appendix 2), \nand adopted by ArIA. The proposed terminal is within the premises of the existing airport, and \nwill be integrated with it. No aesthetic impact is expected. The impact on groundwater or surface \nwater is anticipated to be minimal because the groundwater levels are generally 4-8 meters \ndeeper than the building's foundation, and no surface water body, including rivers or lakes, will \nbe  affected.  During  construction,  dust  is  expected  from  excavation,  transportation  of \nconstruction  material,  emissions from  construction  vehicles,  among others,  but this  will  be \nmitigated by measures such as periodic water spraying and covering of construction materials. \nWhen the airport is operational, the only fixed source of pollution will be from the boiler house, \nwhich will run on natural gas. It will meet the required emission standards and will have no \nmajor impact on air quality. The project is expected to lead to additional vehicular and air traffic, \nbut increases in air emissions will be negligible because (i) the access roads to the airport have \nample capacity for additional traffic so there will be no congestion-related air emissions, and (ii) \nincreased air emissions from additional flights will be offset by the fact that the newer aircraft \noperating in the airport will have much lower emission levels than those operating now.  \n ", "8   \n \n25.  The major sources of noise during construction will include excavation, transportation of \nmaterials, and operation of construction equipment, but their impact will be minimized by careful \nplanning and scheduling of machinery operations and use of low-noise equipment. There are no \nhospitals or schools near the project site.  An analysis of the current and future noise impacted \nareas indicates that, when the airport is operational, aircraft noise impact will decrease and the \naffected area will be smaller than at present because the aircraft will be significantly quieter than \nthose today, particularly the older Russian jets.  In addition, the project requires aircraft to follow \na noise-abatement procedure that establishes noise-preferable routes to avoid flying over areas \nthat are susceptible to noise.  \n \n26.  There are no major health and safety hazards anticipated from project implementation \nand operation. ArIA has developed an environmental management system according to the \nInternational  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO)  14001  and  a  health  and  safety \nmanagement  system  according  to  the  Occupational  Health  and  Safety  Advisory  Services \n(OHSAS) 18001, which is currently being implemented. The resettlement site to house the \ndisplaced persons has been examined for its environmental impacts. No significant negative \nimpacts will result from the construction of the new residential buildings, which will be on major \nroads and in an existing community where adequate waste and waste water management \ninfrastructure is provided by the government. \n \n2.  Social Dimensions  \n27.  The new terminal is being built on vacant land owned and used by ZIA. Therefore, no \nland acquisition or involuntary resettlement is required for the project.  However, as part of the \nmaster plan for the rehabilitation of ZIA, ArIA is required to remove four residential buildings \ninside the airport territory, affecting 506 residents. The project has therefore been classified as \ncategory A for involuntary resettlement in accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement \u2013 \nSafeguards  Requirements  on  Involuntary  Resettlement.  ArIA  has  prepared  a  resettlement \naction plan (RAP) in line with ADB and EBRD's policy requirements. Since 2006, ArIA and the \ngovernment  (through  the  General  Department  of  Civil  Aviation)  have  consulted  with  the \ndisplaced  persons,  most  of  whom  are  airport  employees.  An  Armenian  translation  of  the \nsummary RAP (Appendix 3) was disclosed to displaced persons in September 2009.  As per the \nRAP, displaced persons are entitled to relocate closer to Yerevan City to apartments that are \nthe same size or larger than their current ones. Moving charges will be shouldered by ArIA and \nfree daily transportation from their new residence to the airport will be provided to airport \nemployees. No loss of income or employment is expected as a result of the relocation. The site \nfor the new buildings has already been identified and a preliminary design for the building has \nbeen  agreed  upon  with  the  displaced  persons.  ArIA  will  be  responsible  for  financing  and \nimplementing the relocation process. ArIA has allocated $13 million for the relocation program, \nwhich has been included in the project cost. To comply with ADB's Public Communications \nPolicy (2005), the RAP will be posted on the ADB website.  There are no indigenous peoples in \nArmenia  and  the  project  does  not  trigger  ADB's  safeguards  requirements  on  indigenous \npeoples.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Management \n28.  ArIA is managed by a professional management team headed by Marcelo Wende, an \nArgentinean expatriate deputed from Corporacion America, the group company that manages a \n ", "  9   \nnumber of operating airports in South America. While a number of expatriates continue to be \ninvolved in the operations and management of the company, highly skilled Armenians have \nbeen progressively added to the management team over the past 8 years, leading to a transfer \nof knowledge and airport management skills from Corporacion America. ArIA continues to draw \nheavily on the technical expertise available in Corporacion America and the AIA group of \ncompanies. The construction process is being closely supervised by a team of architects and \nengineers headquartered in Argentina.  Since the beginning of the concession in 2002, all \ndevelopment plans have been implemented on time at ZIA and service levels have improved \nsignificantly, exceeding expectations. Based on this successful track record, as well as the \nsatisfactory progress in project implementation to date, the incumbent management appears \nadequately qualified to complete the project and manage the airport satisfactorily. \n \n2.  Construction Arrangements \n29.  For  project  construction,  ArIA  is  following  procurement  procedures  similar  to  those \nadopted for phase 1. It has entered into a design and construction management contract with \nEuroport, an Italian service provider with significant experience in supplying goods and services \nin  aeronautical  and  associated  businesses.  Under  the  management  contract,  Europort  is \nresponsible  for  conceptual  and  detailed  design  development,  preliminary  cost  estimation, \npreparation of technical documents required for price bidding, and inspection and supervision to \nensure compliance with construction documents. Europort is also responsible for coordinating \nthe execution of works, monitoring progress in implementation, issuing service orders and other \nadministrative work pertaining to project execution. For the concrete structures, roads, and \naccess-ways, separate contracts have been executed with Courthill Corporation, with whom \nArIA  has  over  6  years'  satisfactory  experience  during  the  renovation  of  the  runway  and \nconstruction of aircraft stands. Local contractors will perform other construction works such as \nthe check-in and immigration counters and concession facilities. In addition, ArIA has an in-\nhouse  infrastructure  department,  staffed  with  architects  and  engineers  responsible  for \noverseeing the contractors' activities. ArIA draws heavily from the AIA group of companies' \nglobal expertise in airport construction and management.  \n \n3.  Operations Arrangements \n30.  ArIA  was  awarded  the  concession  to  operate  ZIA  under  a  concession  agreement \nexecuted in December 2001. Under the concession, ArIA has been granted exclusive right to \nadminister and operate ZIA and related property and equipment, and to conduct all businesses \nrelated to ZIA for a period of 30 years. ArIA has the option to extend the term of the concession \nfor additional periods of 5 years. The concession agreement requires ArIA to prepare a master \nplan for the airport, agree it with the government, and keep it updated at least every 5 years \nthroughout the period of the concession; the ultimate objective being the construction and \noperation of a modern terminal complex with dedicated arrivals and departures buildings. The \nconcession agreement permits ArIA to set aeronautical tariffs that include aircraft landing and \ntake-off charges, aircraft parking charges, passenger handling fees, and loading bridge usage \ncharges.  \n \n31.  The concession agreement allows for a pre-agreed internal rate of return (IRR) to ArIA \nover the period of the concession. In order to reach this IRR, ArIA is permitted to propose \namendments to the master plan, as well as revisions to aeronautical tariffs. Adjustments to all \naeronautical tariffs become effective as soon as ArIA notifies the government, and may be \nobjected to by the government within 15 days. All other commercial and non-aeronautical fees \n(except the fuel margin) are set at ArIA's sole discretion. If ArIA does not recover the aggregate \n ", "10  \nIRR, it is entitled to extend the term of the concession at its sole discretion.  Implementation of \nthe concession arrangement has so far been satisfactory, with the government approving a \nnumber of adjustments to aeronautical tariffs proposed by ArIA from time to time.  \n \n4.  Anticorruption Policy  \n32.  The  borrower  and  sponsor  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) and policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing \nof Terrorism (2003). Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB will require the borrower and sponsor to institute, maintain, and comply with \ninternal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for the purpose \nof  preventing  corruption  or  money  laundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and \ncovenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The loan documentation between \nADB,  the  borrower  and  the  sponsor  will  further  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or \npotential violation of these undertakings. Non-compliance by the borrower or the sponsor of any \nof  the  undertakings  and  covenants  mentioned  above  will  allow  ADB  to  seek  immediate \nprepayment of the ADB loan. \n \n5.  Project Performance Monitoring, Reporting, and Evaluation \n33.  ArIA will provide to ADB quarterly unaudited International Financial Reporting Standards \n(IFRS) based financial statements and reports on the progress in implementation of the project. \nArIA's annual accounts are audited by Grant Thornton Amyot in accordance with IFRS. On an \nannual basis, ArIA will be required to submit its audited financial statements, a confirmation of \ncompliance with financial covenants, an annual operations review, an environmental and social \nmonitoring report, and a report on the annual energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions (to \nbe published on ArIA's website). ADB will monitor the project vis-\u00e0-vis the updated business \nplans to be furnished by ArIA, using information from its own sources and the public domain.  A \nlenders'  supervisor  will  be  jointly  appointed  by  the  lenders  for  monitoring  the  progress  in \nimplementation  of  the  project.  Appendix  1  contains  the  design  and  monitoring  framework, \nincluding  the  relevant  performance  indicators.  ArIA  will  be  required  to  report  on  these \nperformance indicators periodically.  \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n1.  Instrument and Amount \n34.  The proposed ADB assistance will comprise a direct loan of up to $40 million with a \nrepayment period of up to 10.50 years (including a grace period of about 3.25 years). The loan \nwill be funded using ADB's ordinary capital resources without government guarantee. The loan \nwill  have  a  floating  interest  rate  in  accordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.  A  commitment  fee  and  a  front-end  fee  will  be  charged  in \naccordance with ADB policy and subject to the approval of the ADB Investment Committee.  \n   \n2.  Terms and Conditions \n35.  The proposed loan will be documented in a loan agreement between ADB and ArIA, \nwhich will contain standard terms and conditions applying to senior debt to private sector \nborrowers  without  government  guarantee.  The  loan  agreement  will  set  out  the  covenants, \n ", "  11   \nrepresentations and warranties, and events of default that will apply to the ADB loan. ADB will \nalso execute an intercreditor agreement, a retention account agreement, and other security \nsharing agreements with the senior lenders for the sharing of the security at an equal rate, \nincluding the moveable and immovable assets of ArIA and all shares issued by ArIA. The \nsecurity creation will be subject to Armenian law and procedure on perfection of security. The \nfirst disbursement of the ADB loan will be subject to conditions precedent. During the tenor of \nthe loan, ArIA will be bound by the financial and operational covenants pursuant to the loan \nagreement.  \n \n3.  Compliance with Investment Limitations  \n36.  The proposed financing is within ADB\u2019s approved medium-term, country, industry, single \nproject, and group exposure limits for nonsovereign operations.  \n \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n37.  The proposed project will be ADB's first nonsovereign intervention in the infrastructure \nsector in the Caucasus region, and will further the relationship between ADB and Armenia. The \npotential assistance for the project will be justified as a response to the ongoing financial crisis \nand the strong development impacts of the project. It supports the government's plans for the \ncivil aviation sector and ADB's operational strategies. ADB will add value in the following areas.   \n \n(i)  The development of the aviation sector is key to the development and economic \ngrowth of Armenia. ZIA is the most important link between Armenia and the rest \nof the world and is therefore of key strategic importance. Strengthening and \nmodernizing the airport will help to connect Armenia to the rest of the world and \nmake  movement  of  passengers  more  efficient,  which  will  lead  to  enhanced \neconomic growth. The ADB investment will play an important role in developing a \nsector that has suffered from underinvestment.  \n \n(ii)  Armenia has been significantly affected by the global financial crisis. Growth in \nArmenian GDP declined from 13.8% in 2007 to 6.8% in 2008. During 2009, GDP \nis  estimated  to  have  contracted by  over  15%.6 Armenia  is  unable  to  attract \nforeign direct investment for key infrastructure projects. Loans from commercial \nbanks for the project that were originally envisaged are no longer available. The \nADB loan will be a timely crisis response and will be critical to bringing in much \nneeded external investment and increasing the confidence of the international \nbusiness community. The project also represents an ideal opportunity for ADB to \npartner with EBRD for the first time in a private sector infrastructure project and \nto deepen relations with DEG. \n \n(iii)  The proposed initiative is strongly aligned with Strategy 2020. The investment \nfocuses on infrastructure development, private sector development, and regional \nintegration.  The  project  is  aligned  with  ADB's  economic  report  and  interim \noperational  strategy  (2006\u20132009)  for  Armenia,  which  identifies  private  sector \npromotion and enhancement of regional cooperation as ADB's strategic priorities. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  work  of  ADB's  public  sector  operations  in \nArmenia's transport sector and regional integration. \n \n                                                 \n6 The Economist Intelligence Unit. 2009. Country Report \u2013 Armenia. London (November). \n ", "12  \n(iv)  The proposed financing is consistent with the government's strategy for the civil \naviation sector. The project will complement efforts to bring efficiency to the \nsector  through  private  sector  participation.  The  ADB  assistance  is  aimed  at \nsupporting an established private sector entity with a proven, 8-year track record \nin operating a key part of the country's transport infrastructure.   \n \nC.  Assurances \n38.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),7 \nthe Government of Armenia will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance to ArIA. No funding will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. ADB will \nenter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following \napproval of the proposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n39.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the loan of up to $40,000,000 to Armenia International Airports for the Zvartnots Airport \nExpansion Project (Phase 2) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources with terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to \nthe Board. \n \n \n \nC.

Description of the Environment \n1.  The project is located within the existing Zvartnots International Airport which lies within \nthe Ararat valley at an altitude of 858 meters (m) above sea level. Ararat mountain is to the \nsouth and the project area is situated in the Ararat plain, which is defined by the river Araks in \nthe southwest and the river Kura in the northwest. The airport is about 12 kilometers (km) from \nthe center of Yerevan city. The climate is continental, with hot summers and cold winters. The \nabsolute maximum temperature in summer is 420C, with a minimum of -300C in winter. The \nArarat valley consists of lower\u2013upper quaternary volcanic tuff and coarse grained debris which \nare covered by contemporary alluvial sediments (clay, sand, and anthropogenic soils). The \nYerevan area is considered one of the most active seismic areas in Armenia. In the 20th \ncentury, more than 10 earthquakes greater than M4 magnitude have been registered, the \nstrongest of which was in 1937 with a magnitude of M4.7. There are no designated biodiversity \nsensitive areas, such as nature reserves, wetlands, or bird protection areas in the immediate \nvicinity of the airport. The nearest surface water course is the River Hrasdan about 1,000 m to \nthe east. In Armenia, about 96% of water used for drinking comes from groundwater resources. \nThere are wells in the vicinity of the airport in use for irrigation purpose. \n \n1.  Anticipated Impacts of the Terminal Construction \n \n2.  Groundwater. The foundation of the terminal is set between 8.50 m and 10.5 m, deeply \nembedded in red volcanic tuff. As the groundwater level is at depths of 14 m\u201316 m, the \ngroundwater level is not reached by the foundation and thus no negative impacts are expected. \n \n3.  Surface water. The project alignment does not cross any major water bodies so no \ndirect impacts on the water flow and quality will be introduced by the project. \n \n4.  Ambient  air  quality.  During  construction  works,  the  impacts  will  be  dust  due  to \nexcavation, loading and unloading, transporting the construction material, and emissions from \nconstruction vehicles and equipment. Impact mitigation measures (e.g., periodic watering of the \nconstruction  site  and  covering  of  construction  material)  are  included  in  the  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) and environmental action plan (EAP). When the airport is operational, \nthe only fixed source of air pollution will be the boiler house, which will use natural gas. \nEmissions are within permissible limits. Additional traffic will access the airport and use the \napproach  streets.  The  roads  leading  to  the  airport  have  ample  capacity  to  deal  with  the \nadditional  airport  traffic,  so  congestion  leading  to  increased  levels  of  air  pollution  is  not \nexpected. Additional flights are expected because of the anticipated increase in air traffic, but \ntheir additional air emissions are considered negligible and their impacts insignificant. \n \n5.  Noise.  The  major  sources  of  noise  during  construction  activities  will  be  during \nexcavation, loading, transportation of materials, and operation of construction equipment. These \nimpacts  will  be  mitigated  by  careful  planning  of  machinery  operations,  use  of  low  noise \nequipment, and restricting scheduling of operations to the daytime to reduce their impacts to \nreceptors. There are no hospitals or schools near the project site. During operations, aircraft \nnoise impacts will decrease, and the noise impacted area will be smaller than it is now.  This is \nbecause the aircraft that will use ZIA when the new terminal becomes operational will be \nsignificantly quieter than those that fly today.   \n \n ", "16    Appendix 2 \n6.  Health and safety hazard and management.  There are no major health and safety \nhazards anticipated from project implementation. There is potential for health impacts from the \ncurrent and past management of hazardous wastes, abandoned fuel tanks, and asbestos on the \nairport  grounds.  ArIA  has  been  informed  of  this  situation  and  will  address  this  in  the \nenvironmental management system implementation.  \n \n2.  Anticipated Impacts of the Development of the Resettlement Site \n \n7.  No land acquisition is required.  However, together with the construction of the new \nterminal and as part of the master plan developed for the airport, there are four buildings owned \nby the airport that need to be removed for reasons of health and safety.  ArIA is implementing a \nresettlement action plan (RAP) in line with the requirements of ADB. The site where the new \nbuildings will be developed to receive the people from the airport property was investigated to \nexamine the development impacts. No significant impacts were identified. \n \n3.  Mitigation of Impacts and Summary Environmental Management Plan \n \n8.  The  identified  impacts  will  primarily  occur  during  the  construction  phase.

The cost of the EMP mitigation measures will be borne by the contractors as part of their \nbudget.  \n \nB.  Public Consultation \n10.  Consultations were conducted and signboards were provided to inform people about the \nconstruction project. The public has also been informed via mass media. The people who will be \nrelocated have been consulted numerous times and have expressed a general desire to move \nto the new buildings as soon as possible because the buildings they live in are, generally, in a \nvery poor condition.  \n \nC.  Findings and Recommendations \n11.  An analysis of the baseline environmental conditions indicates that the proposed project, \nincluding the relocation site, would not have adverse impacts on the environment that cannot be \nmitigated.  The  identified  impacts  are  limited  to  the  construction  phase  and  therefore  are \ntemporary and small-scale. Adequate mitigation measures are proposed for implementation in \nthe form of an environmental management plan that will be implemented during construction. \nNo further environmental assessment is deemed necessary.  \n ", "18  Appendix 3     \n \n \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN \n  \n1.  Introduction.  As  part  of  the  master  plan  to  rehabilitate and  expand  the  operations  of \nZvartnots International Airport, Armenia International Airports (ArIA) has undertaken construction of \nthe new passenger terminal which will replace the old terminal 1 building. The new terminal is being \nbuilt on vacant land owned by Zvartnots International Airport.  During construction of the new \nterminal and as part of the airport master plan, four residential buildings inside the airport territory \nwill be removed.   \n \n2.  Scope of involuntary resettlement impacts. The affected residential buildings include two \nidentical medium-rise multi-dwelling buildings, a four-story hostel, and a training center hostel. \nApartment units are either owned or occupied by current or former airport employees. The asset \ninventory and census of residents was updated in 2009 and found that 506 residents in 171 \napartment units will be affected. \n \n3.  Socioeconomic profile. The airport and its various service providers employ about 3,000 \npeople. A large percentage of the residents work at the airport as drivers, mechanics, customer \nservice employees, shift managers at check in counters, flight attendants, and pilots. School-age \nchildren attend classes at a primary school near the airport or in Yerevan city.   \n \n4.  Participation,  consultation,  and  information  disclosure.  Since  2006,  ArIA  and  the \ngovernment of Armenia (represented by the General Department of Civil Aviation [GDCA]) have \nconsulted with the building residents, who have been informed about the need to relocate them, the \nlocation of the proposed resettlement site, and their entitlements. ArIA has elected to proceed on a \nvoluntary  basis  and  to  incentivize  residents  to  relocate  by  offering  homes  in  a  better  area. \nResidents are willing to relocate provided that they will be given apartments of the same size or \nlarger in Yerevan city, moving charges are covered, and free transportation is offered to airport \nemployees. An Armenian translation of the summary resettlement action plan (RAP) was made \navailable to affected people in September 2009.  To comply with the Public Communications Policy \n(2005) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the RAP will be posted on ADB website.   \n \n5.  Legal framework and entitlements.  Analysis of Armenian laws reveals that there are gaps \nbetween national requirements and the involuntary resettlement policies of ADB and the European \nBank for Reconstruction and Resettlement (EBRD).  ArIA has adopted policy principles to address \nthese gaps, e.g. providing replacement apartment units regardless of nature of ownership rights.  \nThe entitlements of affected people are shown in Table A3. \n ", "                                                                                                                                              Appendix 3        1   9                               \n \n \nTable A3: Eligibility and Entitlement Matrix \n \nIssue and/or Loss  Eligible Affected Person  Entitlement \nLoss of  Owners with property  New place of accommodation (the same \naccommodation  certificates  size or larger, depending on condition of \nOccupants of dormitories  the existing apartment).  \nJourney to work \u2013  Airport employees  Free transportation will be provided to \nno longer able to  airport employees. \nwalk to work \nTransfer of title  All affected persons  Legal and clerical support will be given to \nensure that title to the apartments will be \ntransferred expeditiously.  \nVulnerable groups  Households  headed  by  Assistance provided during relocation \nwomen  Persons with disabilities will be given \nPersons with disabilities  preference in the allocation of units on the \nlower floors. \nSource: Armenia International Airports. \n \n6.  Relocation to new apartment buildings. The new buildings will be constructed on a plot of \nland at Malatya\u2013Sebastia, Yerevan city. The site was selected as it is closer than the current \nbuildings  to  Yerevan  city  and  to  markets,  schools,  government  and  community  facilities,  and \nemployment opportunities. A preliminary design of the replacement buildings has been prepared \nand is being disclosed to the affected people. Each affected owner of the apartment units and each \nregistered occupant of the hostels will be assisted by ArIA to register his or her replacement \napartment units as per the Law of the Republic of Armenia on Apartment Building Management \n(2002).  \n \n7.  Grievance  redress  mechanism.  If  issues,  complaints  or  grievances  arise  about  the \nrelocation, the ArIA Maintenance and Environmental Department will engage the complainants to \nidentify solutions and resolve grievances in a participatory manner. If the issue cannot be resolved \nat this level, it will be elevated to the Grievance and Redress Committee with representation from \nArIA, the city government of Yerevan represented by the GDCA, and affected people. \n \n8.  Income restoration. No loss of income or employment is expected as a result of relocation. \nAirport employees will retain their positions and free transportation will be given. Those who are \nemployed  outside  the  airport  will  be  closer  to  their  jobs  in  the  city  of  Yerevan.  Unemployed \nresidents will have a better chance of getting jobs as the new building is close to employment \ncentres. \n \n9.  Institutional arrangements. ArIA will be responsible for financing and implementing the \nrelocation process. The GDCA will supervise and monitor the process. \n \n10.  Implementation  schedule.    ArIA  will  hire  a  contractor  to  build  the  new  building  in \napproximately 2.5 years. ArIA will ensure that no physical displacement will take place until the \nreplacement buildings have been constructed and the individual apartment units are ready for \noccupancy. Construction will begin in March 2010 and will be completed in November 2011. The \nresidents will move directly from their current homes to their new residences by February 2012. AIA \nwill assist the residents in the moving process. \n  \n11.  Monitoring and evaluation. Internal monitoring will involve: (i) administrative monitoring to \nensure that implementation is on schedule and problems are dealt with on a timely basis, (ii) \nsocioeconomic monitoring during and after the relocation process to ensure that people are settled \n ", "20  Appendix 3     \n \n \nand  recovering,  and  (iii)  overall  monitoring  to  determine  whether  recovery  has  taken  place \nsuccessfully and on time. External monitoring will review and validate internal monitoring reports \nand will be carried out in parallel with the implementation of the RAP. Monitors will produce a \nsemiannual report and a final compliance report. The report will indicate whether the RAP has been \ncarried out in accordance with ADB and EBRD policy requirements and to the satisfaction of the \naffected persons. The external monitor's compliance report will be submitted to ArIA, ADB, and \nEBRD simultaneously. \n \n12.  Budget. ArIA has allocated $13 million for the relocation program. ArIA will make as many \nmanned vehicles as necessary available for the actual relocation. Daily transportation costs for \nairport employees are included in general airport costs.  \n \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "Asian Development Bank", "CreationDate": "D:20100329150624+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Keywords": "RRP: ARM 43922", "ModDate": "D:20100329175823+08'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 9.0.0 (Windows)", "Title": "RRP: Zvartnots Airport Expansion Project (Phase 2) (Armenia)"}, "author_page": "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 13 February 2010) \n \nCurrency Unit  \u2013  dram (AMD) \nAMD1.00  =  $0.00262 \n$1.00  =  AMD381.50  \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  AIA  \u2013  American International Airports \n  ArIA  \u2013  Armenia International Airports  \n  BAe  \u2013  British Aerospace  \n  DEG  \u2013  Deutsche Investitions-und Entwicklungsgesellchaft  \n  EBRD  \u2013  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development  \n  EMP  \u2013  environmental management plan \n  GDCA  \u2013  General Department of Civil Aviation \n  GDP  \u2013  gross domestic product \n  IATA  \u2013  International Air Transport Association \n  ICAO  \u2013  International Civil Aviation Organization \n  IRR  \u2013  internal rate of return \n  LIBOR  \u2013  London interbank offered rate  \n  RAP  \u2013  resettlement action plan \n  SCF  \u2013  Southern Cone Foundation \n  ZAC  \u2013  Zvartnots Airport Company \n  ZIA  \u2013  Zvartnots International Airport \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of Armenia International Airports ends on 31 December. \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \nVice-President  X.
