THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Small Business Finance Project. The report also describes \nthe proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Financial Sector \nDevelopment Partnership Special Fund1 for Strengthening Participating Financial Institutions, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, approve the TA.2 \n  \n2.  The proposed project will support participating financial institutions (PFIs) to provide \nloans to small businesses. The TA will help PFIs strengthen credit underwriting to improve rural \noutreach, and enhance financial literacy of their small business clients.3  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Favorable hydrocarbon revenues and substantial public investments supported a strong \ngross domestic product (GDP) growth at an annual average rate of 8% during 2000\u20132015. The \nGDP per capita increased from $558 to $2,036 and the poverty rate decreased from 27% to \n14% during the same period. An industry-focused growth strategy resulted in an increase in the \nindustry sector\u2019s share of GDP from 14% in 2000 to 24% in 2015, while the agriculture sector\u2019s \nshare of GDP decreased from 30% to 17% during the same period. However, the strong GDP \ngrowth failed to effectively absorb the country\u2019s growing workforce. While the unemployment \nrate remained low at 5.2% in 2015, the number of Uzbek migrants doubled to 2 million during \n2000\u20132015. The ongoing recession in the Russian Federation, which hosts over 90% of Uzbek \nmigrant workers, has led to an increase of returning migrants, posing challenges to absorb them \ninto the economy.4 Small businesses effectively generate employment and income, and are \ncritical for Uzbekistan\u2019s inclusive growth. \n \n4.  Small businesses play an important role in the economy, contributing 57% to GDP and \nabsorbing 80% of employment in 2015.5 In 2015, small businesses produced 98% of agricultural \noutput, 87% of retail trade, 67% of construction, 51% of services, 39% of manufacturing, and \n27% of exports.6 As of 2015, Uzbekistan had 225,998 active small and microenterprises and \n227,646 individual entrepreneurs. About 80% of small businesses operated outside the capital.  \nWith 17.3% the rural poverty rate exceeds the urban poverty rate of 10.6% pointing to a \nsignificant income disparity between rural and urban Uzbekistan. \n \n                                                \n1  Financing partner: the Government of Luxembourg.  \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory TA for preparing the Small Business Finance \nProject (TA 8986-UZB). \n4  In 2014 and 2015, 330,000 migrant workers returned to Uzbekistan. ADB. 2016. Asian Development Outlook 2016: \nAsia's Potential Growth. Manila. \n5  Effective 1 July 2014, the government groups small businesses in the following categories: (i) microenterprises, (ii) \nsmall enterprises, and (iii) individual entrepreneurs. A microenterprise is defined as not employing more than 20 \nstaff in industry, 10 in services, and 5 in trade and catering. A small enterprise is defined as not employing more \nthan 100 employees in the light industry, food, and construction sectors; 100 in industry; 50 in agribusiness; and 25 \nin services, retail trade, and catering. Individual entrepreneurs are defined as persons engaged in business \nactivities. Government of Uzbekistan. 2014.

Tashkent. \n6  Government of Uzbekistan, State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Statistics. 2016. Statistical Review \nof the Republic of Uzbekistan. Tashkent.    \n ", "2   \n5.  The financial system is dominated by banks, which control 94% of finance sector assets. \nEight state-owned banks control 75% of banking assets and provide the bulk of credit to state-\nowned entities.  During 2011\u20132015, bank credit to small businesses substantially increased \nfrom 4.5% to 7.1% of GDP, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34.1%. \nHowever, lending to small businesses still represents less than one-third of overall bank credit, \nwhich is insufficient given their economic significance. Eighty percent of small businesses are \nstill being funded by family and friends and informal resources. Access to finance remains a key \nconstraint for private business growth.   \n \n6.  Significant cost of funding, perceived risks, and administrative costs associated with \nlending require banks to charge interest rates that range from 11%-25% for local currency and \n6%-15% for foreign currency loans. Especially individuals and small businesses borrow at \nhigher rates. Bank\u2019s focus on traditional collateral based rather than cash flow-based lending \nprocesses undermine the ability of small businesses to borrow from banks. \n \n7.  Although bank credit outside the capital represents about 65% of total credit, universal \naccess  to  finance  for  private  individuals  and  small  businesses  in  rural  areas  is  heavily \nconstrained by weak rural branch networks and limited mobile banking services. Also, most \nbank loan products carry a tenor of up to 1 year, irrespective of farm cash flows generated by \nthe multiyear agricultural product cycles. Small businesses have limited business sophistication \nand  skills,  which  impede  their  growth,  with  surveys  indicating  that  they  lack  access  to \ninformation on market opportunities, suppliers, competitors, technology, and banking products.7 \nLow financial literacy of small businesses and low-income households, many of which are led by \nwomen, limit their access to financial services and their ability to invest and grow.  \n \n8.  Compared  with  transition  economies  in  Eastern  Europe,  the  South  Caucasus  and \nCentral Asia, Uzbekistan\u2019s depth and efficiency of financial intermediation is low, as evidenced \nby the low private credit-to-GDP ratio of 24.9% in 2015 and high lending\u2013deposit rate spreads, \nwhich range from 12% to 15%. The loan-to-deposit ratio surged from 89% in 2012 to 120% in \n2015, reflecting limited availability of deposits. While deposits represented the bulk of bank \nfunding in 2015, banks obtained 87% of deposits from state-owned enterprises and private \ncorporations, and only 13% from retail customers in 2015, indicating a volatile deposit base.8 A \n2014 survey showed that 40% of the adult population had savings accounts, but only 2% had \nsaved with financial institutions.9 Deposit mobilization is undermined by public mistrust in banks, \nwhich is compounded by administrative hurdles in withdrawing cash from bank accounts.10 \n \n9.  In 2012\u20132015, banks\u2019 Basel I capital adequacy ratios (CARs) averaged 24%.11 However, \nthe introduction of Basel III capital adequacy, and mandatory full compliance with it by 2019, will \nrequire banks to meet additional prudential measures, including a liquidity coverage ratio and \ncapital charges for operational and market risk, which will likely require additional capital. \n \n                                                \n7  Center for Economic Research. 2014.

Depositors face \ndifficulties in withdrawing cash; cash withdrawals are subject to fees of up to 20%. \n11 Basel I only measures credit risk. ", "3 \n10.  The Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) reported an average nonperforming loan (NPL) \nratio of less than 1% in 2015. 12 However, Moody\u2019s Investors Service estimated a more realistic \nNPL ratio of 7% for banks for 2015.13 The expected decline in economic growth is likely to \nadversely affect borrowers\u2019 debt service capacity and banks\u2019 asset quality during 2016. Banks \nreported  solid  profitability  and  the  return  on  average  assets  averaged  2.2%  in  2015.  The \nslowdown in remittances and economic growth may adversely affect profitability in 2016.  \n \n11.  Government efforts and development coordination. The Government of Uzbekistan \nhas implemented programs to support small business and banking sector growth.14 To improve \nthe banks\u2019 ability to assess borrower creditworthiness, the Law on Credit Information, which was \npromulgated in 2011, provided for the establishment of a public credit bureau, which covered \n19.4% of adults in 2015, compared to the 37.4% average of its Eastern European and Central \nAsian peers.15 It provides limited information from banks; exposures to other creditors such as \nnonbanks and information from mobile phone and utility providers are not covered. Assisted by \nthe International Finance Corporation (IFC), the government is expanding the coverage and \nimproving the quality of the credit bureau. To facilitate registration of movable assets as loan \ncollateral,  the  Law  on  Collateral  Registry,  which  was  promulgated  in  2013,  supported  the \nestablishment of an electronic secured transactions registry, which commenced operations in \n2014. Laws enacted in the late 1990s need to be improved to facilitate the use of movable \nproperty as collateral. Assisted by IFC, the government has prepared draft legal amendments \nfor enactment in 2017. \n \n12.  The following multilateral and bilateral development partners support small business \ndevelopment:  (i)  the  World  Bank  provides  credit  lines  to  farmers  and  small  agricultural \nenterprises; (ii) IFC supports the private sector through advisory services and investments; (iii) \nthe United Nations Development Programme has helped improve business registration; and (iv) \nthe  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  and  the  European  Union  have \npromoted horticulture and women-owned businesses16 in agriculture. \n \n13.  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s value addition and lessons. The project will support \nfinancial inclusion, especially outside the capital, by providing loans to small businesses for \nworking capital and fixed asset investments. The project will improve financial inclusion for \nwomen-owned businesses through (i) agreed business lending targets and appropriate gender \npolicies with the PFIs, and (ii) dedicated TA to foster financial literacy of women entrepreneurs. \nThe attached TA will strengthen the PFIs\u2019 lending processes and product offerings, including \nmobile banking service outreach and financial literacy training to small business clients.17 In \naddition, PFIs\u2019 environmental and social management systems (ESMSs) will be strengthened to \nsatisfy the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n \n14.  Since 1996, ADB has provided five loans and five related capacity building TA projects \nto PFIs in Uzbekistan. In 2013, ADB made an equity investment in Ipak Yuli Bank (IYB). The \n                                                \n12 The NPL ratio is very low compared to Uzbekistan\u2019s regional peers. As the CBU criteria for asset classification are \nnot disclosed, the NPL ratio should be treated with caution.  \n13 Moody\u2019s Investors Service. 2015. Banking System Outlook: Uzbekistan.

", "4   \nfirst two loans funded 59 subloans averaging $1.5 million to medium-sized enterprises during \n1996\u20132002,18 whereas the remaining three loans, which focused on micro and small enterprises \nand  individuals,  funded  29,340  subloans  averaging  $10,000  during  2002\u20132014.19 ADB\u2019s \nexperience in these loans shows that privately owned PFIs display better asset quality and \nsustainability compared to public sector banks and credit unions. The PFIs selected for this \nproject are majority privately owned banks and one leasing finance company with 49% private \nownership. To enable PFIs to service a larger range of job-creating small enterprises, the \nmaximum subloan size limit is set at $300,000 under the proposed project, up from $100,000 \nunder the previous loan (Loan 3043), which is still moderate compared to small business loan \nsizes issued by banks in the region.20 The leasing company will finance sound small businesses \nthat do not meet documentation required by lenders. ADB\u2019s due diligence also identified the \nneed to upgrade PFI skills to match international financial reporting standards (IFRS) and avoid \nconflicts of interest arising from the use of external auditors for advising PFIs in preparing \nfinancial statements. Under the proposed project, the PFIs will hire accounting staff familiar with \nIFRS prior to loan disbursement.  \n \n15.  The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 by supporting the \ndevelopment of financial institutions and financial services.21 The PFIs\u2019 emphasis on small \nbusinesses in underserved areas with significant income and employment opportunities will \npromote inclusive growth. The project supports the government\u2019s development strategy for \n2016\u20132020, which aims to accelerate economic growth, promote the private sector, improve \naccess to finance, and address regional disparity.22 The government\u2019s development strategy is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 for Uzbekistan and is included in \nADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2016\u20132018 for Uzbekistan.23 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome  \n16.  The impact will be an improved contribution of small businesses to inclusive economic \ngrowth and employment. The outcome will be increased sustainable provision of PFIs\u2019 financing \nto small businesses. The PFIs are expected to set examples for other financial institutions on \nhow to deepen their outreach while retaining good asset quality and funding private enterprise \nactivities that generate jobs. \n \n \n                                                \n18  ADB. 1996.

The output will be expanded capacity of the PFIs for financing small businesses. The \nPFIs will expand lending to small businesses for investment and working capital purposes. At \nproject completion, the PFIs are expected to have made at least 20% of eligible loans to \nwomen-owned small businesses, and at least 60% to small businesses outside the capital. The \nattached TA will support the PFIs in pursuing small business lending by introducing credit \nscoring  and  loan  origination  facilitated  by  mobile  devices,  such  as  tablet  computers,  and \nimprove financial literacy of PFIs\u2019 small business clients (footnote 17). \n \nD.  Financing Plan  \n18.  The government has requested a loan of $100.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan and project agreements.

Based on \ndiscussions with the participating financial institutions, the average contribution is estimated at 25%. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n19.  The government will relend the proceeds of the loan in US dollars through subsidiary \nloan agreements to PFIs that satisfy ADB\u2019s eligibility criteria set out in the project administration \nmanual (PAM) and the loan and project agreements.25 The government is expected to relend \nthe proceeds of the loan to the PFIs at the same tenor and grace period at which it received the \nfunds from ADB. The government\u2019s relending rate will be the interest rate charged by ADB for \nthe loan plus an appropriate margin to cover administrative and risk costs on the PFIs.26 \n \n20.  The PFIs will use the loan proceeds to finance subloans and leases to eligible small \nbusiness subborrowers to support working capital and fixed asset investments. Subloans and \nleases may be issued in US dollars and sum, and priced by the PFIs at market rates that cover \n                                                \n24 Every $1.00 of ADB subloan is expected to mobilize an average of $0.33 of small business investment on the \nassumption that PFIs will require eligible borrowers to provide, on average, 25% of a subproject\u2019s cost with equity. \nPFIs will determine the subborrower equity contributions based on the nature of the credit risk, which based on the \ncredit policy of each PFI would range from 20% to 30% of the project cost. PFIs will contribute capital that they \nmust hold against subloans. The PFIs\u2019 capital and loan loss reserves are the first defenses against subborrower \ndefaults, and incentivize PFIs to lend to creditworthy clients.  \n25  Based on each PFI absorptive capacity, subject to review and adjustments during project implementation, loan \nallocation is currently set as follows: Hamkorbank ($45 million), IYB ($38 million), UzbekLeasing International A.O. \n($10 million), and Davr Bank ($7 million).    \n26 The government will charge ADB\u2019s funding cost plus 0.2% per annum to the PFIs. The PFIs\u2019 interest rates carry the \ncost for (i) loan origination, (ii) the provision of foreign exchange to service the ADB loan, (iii) the repricing risk \narising from the mismatch of 6 months of repricing of ADB loans (as subloans may carry a fixed interest rate up to \n5 years), and (iv) credit risk and related capital charges. Under the current foreign exchange regime, the cost of \nproviding US dollars at payment dates is substantial, justifying the significant net interest margins.  ", "6   \nforeign exchange, credit, maturity, and interest rate risks. Such subloans will have a tenor of up \nto 5 years. PFIs will determine the creditworthiness of subborrowers and assume full credit risk. \nThe maximum subloan size is currently set at $300,000.  \n \n21.  The Participating Financial Institutions. The PFIs were selected among commercial \nbanks  and  leasing  companies  that  expressed  interest  to  participate  in  the  project  and \nsubsequent detailed due diligence. ADB selected four PFIs: Hamkorbank, IYB, Davr Bank, and \nUzbekLeasing International A.O. (ULC).  All PFIs have business strategies reflecting a strong \ntrack  record  and  a  commitment  to  serving  rural  and  women-owned  small  businesses. \nHamkorbank is fully privately owned. It has a strong regional footprint, with 95% of its loans \nbooked outside the capital, and it serves nearly 22,000 borrowers, including about 6,000 women, \nwith an average loan size of $12,900 and a maximum loan size of $350,000 equivalent. IYB, in \nwhich  ADB  holds  13.4%  of  the  share  capital,  has  75%  private  ownership.  Relative  to \nHamkorbank, it caters to the upper small business client segment, with 62% of its loans booked \nin the regions outside the capital, an average loan size of $54,100, and a maximum loan size of \n$2 million equivalent.

Founded in 1991, Hamkorbank has 30% foreign ownership (15% owned \nby IFC and 15% by FMO, the Netherlands Development Finance Company). Its small business \nloan book ($284 million in 2015) is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 25% by 2021, compared \nwith 35% during 2012\u20132015. Hamkorbank\u2019s CAR of 13.6% at the end of 2015 exceeded the \nCBU minimum of 10% in 2015. Hamkorbank lends to small business borrowers involved in \nindustry (32.6%), trade (27.3%), services (8.3%), and agriculture (5%). Hamkorbank\u2019s asset \nquality is sound, with an NPL ratio of 0.2% in 2015. Loan loss reserve (LLR) coverage remained \nsatisfactory, representing 107.7% of NPLs in 2015. Hamkorbank is profitable. Its net income \nincreased by 55% to $34 million in 2015 because of robust loan growth and a stable net interest \nmargin of 7.4%, while its return on average assets improved to 3.8% in 2015 from 3.7% in 2014. \nIn 2015, Hamkorbank sourced 70% of its funding through deposits and supplemented the \nremaining 30% through borrowings. In February 2016, the CBU suspended certain Hamkorbank \nforeign  exchange  operations  for  6  months  due  to  noncompliance  with  foreign  exchange \n                                                \n27  ADB. 2008.

In April 2013, ADB became a \nshareholder of IYB, holding 13.4% of shares at the end of 2015. IYB\u2019s small business loan \nportfolio ($271 million at the end of 2015) comprised 78% of the total loan portfolio and is \ntargeted to grow at a CAGR of 20% by 2021. With 40% of small business loans issued outside \nthe capital, IYB plans to increase its rural coverage through expansion of a regional branch \nnetwork and e-banking. Its CAR was 12.6% at the end of 2015, down from 16.2% at the end of \n2013. The decline in its CAR reflects the increase of 90% in risk-weighted assets on the back of \na  growing  loan  book  compared  with  a  55%  increase  in  total  capital.  Portfolio  quality  is \nsatisfactory and has improved, with an NPL ratio of 2.1% of gross loans at the end of 2015 \ncompared to 3.8% at the end of 2013. LLR coverage of NPLs comprised a very comfortable \n190.0% in 2015 and 215.4% in 2014, up from 124.7% in 2013. IYB\u2019s profitability is strong, with a \nreturn on average assets ratio of 2.3% in 2015, supported by a solid net interest margin and fee-\nbased earnings. Net income increased to $13.1 million in 2015 from $11.0 million in 2014. IYB \nhad a stable funding profile in 2015, with customer deposits representing 80% of total funding \nand long-term debt from international financial institutions accounting for 17% of total funding. \n \n25.  Davr Bank. Established in 2001, Davr Bank is a small private bank lending to small \nbusinesses (91% of total loan portfolio). It expects its small business loan book ($43.5 million in \n2015) to grow at a CAGR of 25% by 2021, compared with 58% during 2012\u20132015. Davr Bank \ntargets to increase lending outside the capital by 25% each year from 2016 to 2021. It increased \nits lending to women entrepreneurs from $0.5 million in 2012 to $12.4 million in 2015, and it is \nprojected to reach $22.3 million by 2021. Davr Bank\u2019s CAR remained high at 21.8% in 2015, \nthough it had declined from 22.0% in 2014. This reduction reflects only a 22% rise in total \ncapital versus 71% in risk-weighted assets driven by the bank\u2019s strong loan growth. Davr Bank \nforecasts CAR at an average of 19.7% during 2016\u20132019 due to solid profitability and the \nissuance of new shares. Its asset quality is satisfactory, with an NPL ratio of 0.3% and LLR \ncoverage at 110% of NPLs in 2015. Fueled by higher fee and commission income, Davr Bank\u2019s \nprofitability was strong, with a return on assets of 6.6% by the end of 2015. Net income \nincreased to $4.7 million in 2015 from $3.3 million in 2012. It sources its funding primarily \nthrough customer deposits, which made up 82.7% of total funding in 2015. \n \n26.  UzbekLeasing International A.O. Established in 1996, ULC is the third-largest lessor in \nthe country. Its shareholders are the National Bank of Uzbekistan for Foreign Economic Activity \n(41.6%), Malayan Banking (19.7%), and Uzbek-Oman Investment Company (38.7%).

With \n80%  of  leases  provided  outside Tashkent,  ULC  has  a  strong  rural  outreach.  ULC\u2019s  lease \nportfolio is projected to grow by a CAGR of 16% by 2021, increasing from $34 million in 2015. \nULC\u2019s CAR in 2015 was a robust 40.9%, allowing enough room for growth and to cushion \nagainst loan losses. In 2015, ULC raised capital through the issuance of new shares. Its asset \nquality is strong, with an NPL ratio of 0.1% and LLR coverage at 100% in 2015. ULC had return \non assets of 10.3% and return-on-equity ratio of 27.7% in 2015 due to high net interest margin. \nBorrowings from its shareholders and international financial institutions constitute 75% of total \nfunding. \n \n ", "8   \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n27.  The Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency. The PFIs will be the implementing \nagencies. Each PFI will establish a project implementation unit to administer the project. The \nPFIs will monitor and report on the use of loan proceeds and compliance with environmental \nand social safeguards requirements and agreed covenants. The implementation arrangements \nare detailed in the PAM and summarized in Table 2.29 \n \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2016\u2013December 2021 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2021 (estimated completion date) \n30 June 2022 (estimated loan closing date) \nManagement \n(i)  Executing agency   Ministry of Finance \n(ii) Implementing agencies  PFIs: Davr Bank, Hamkorbank, Ipak Yuli Bank, and UzbekLeasing \nInternational A.O.  \n(iii) Implementation units  Each PFI establishes a PIU \nDisbursement  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PFI = participating financial institution, PIU = project implementation unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n28.  The proposed capacity building TA is an integral part of the project and will strengthen \nthe PFIs\u2019 capabilities to lend to small businesses on a commercially sustainable basis (footnote \n17). The TA will (i) strengthen PFIs\u2019 credit underwriting policies and procedures, (ii) develop a \ncredit-scoring and loan-origination system facilitated by mobile devices for small business loans, \n(iii) improve rural outreach by establishing mobile loan processing, and (iv) strengthen PFIs\u2019 \nfinancial literacy programs for their small business clients. \n \n29.  The TA is estimated to cost $650,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund and administered by ADB. \nThe PFIs will provide counterpart support of $150,000 in the form of staff, logistical support, \nfunding consultants, and necessary related investments. The Ministry of Finance will be the \nExecuting  Agency  and  the  relevant  PFIs  will  be  the  implementing  agencies  for  the  TA. \nConsultants for the TA will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be made in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). The TA will be implemented from the date of TA effectiveness until 31 December \n2019.  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n30.  The  economic  benefits  of  the  project  will  be  mainly  derived  from  the  increased \nproductivity and profitability of small businesses. Direct economic benefits will flow from the \ncontribution of small businesses to economic output and employment. The project will increase \nsustainable provision of bank loans to small businesses, with a special effort to reach those \n                                                \n29 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

The project is expected to enhance the \nability  of  the  PFIs  to  deliver  financial  services  to  and  improve  financial  literacy  of  small \nbusinesses. \n \nB.  Governance \n31.  ADB assessed the PFIs\u2019 financial management systems and classifies the overall pre-\nmitigation financial management risk as moderate. Identified issues include Davr Bank\u2019s limited \nnumber of appropriately qualified accounting staff (especially for IFRS), and Davr Bank\u2019s and \nULC\u2019s lack of familiarity with ADB\u2019s disbursement and reporting procedures. An action plan to \naddress the accounting issues is detailed in the PAM, and training of staff in ADB project \nadministration requirements will be carried out by ADB within 6 months of the approval of the \nproposed project. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and PFIs. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n32.  The project supports poverty reduction indirectly through its focus on improved access to \nfinance by small businesses. Rural and women\u2019s small businesses are expected to benefit \nsubstantially  and,  as  a  result,  boost  their  investments  and  help  maintain  and  expand \nemployment and provide stable incomes for themselves, their employees, and their suppliers. A \ngender  assessment  was  carried  out,  which  categorizes  the  project  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming. The project will enhance PFIs\u2019 gender policies and improve women\u2019s access to \nfinancial services, including credit. It will also improve their financial literacy.30 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n33.  The  project  is  categorized  as  financial  intermediation  treated  as  C  for  involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous people safeguards, and as financial intermediation for environment. \nSubprojects  (i)  identified  on  the  ADB  Prohibited  Investment  Activities  List  provided  in  the \nSafeguard Policy Statement, (ii) classified as environment category A, and (iii) classified as \ncategory B that are in the ESMS exclusion list are not eligible for financing under the project. \nEligible subprojects will comply with the national regulations. ADB carried out due diligence of \nthe  PFIs\u2019  ESMSs.  All  PFIs  must  have  ESMSs  in  place  that  satisfy  the  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement\u2019s requirements prior to the first disbursement of their respective loans. The TA will \nprovide assistance in capacity strengthening and monitoring to help PFIs keep their ESMS \noperations in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement.31  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.
