The report also describes \nthe proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Financial Sector \nDevelopment  Partnership  Special  Fund1 for  Strengthening  Participating  Financial  Institutions, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, approve the TA.2 \n  \n2. \nThe  proposed  project  will  support  participating  financial  institutions  (PFIs)  to  provide \nloans to small businesses. The TA will help PFIs strengthen credit underwriting to improve rural \noutreach, and enhance financial literacy of their small business clients.3  \n\n \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nFavorable hydrocarbon revenues and substantial public investments supported a strong \ngross domestic product (GDP) growth at an annual average rate of 8% during 2000\u20132015. The \nGDP  per  capita  increased  from  $558  to  $2,036  and  the  poverty  rate  decreased  from  27%  to \n14% during the same period. An industry-focused growth strategy resulted in an increase in the \nindustry sector\u2019s share of GDP from 14% in 2000 to 24% in 2015, while the agriculture sector\u2019s \nshare of GDP decreased from 30% to 17% during the same period. However, the strong GDP \ngrowth  failed  to  effectively  absorb  the  country\u2019s  growing  workforce.  While  the  unemployment \nrate remained low at 5.2% in 2015, the number of Uzbek migrants doubled to 2 million during \n2000\u20132015. The ongoing recession in the Russian Federation, which hosts over 90% of Uzbek \nmigrant workers, has led to an increase of returning migrants, posing challenges to absorb them \ninto  the  economy.4 Small  businesses  effectively  generate  employment  and  income,  and  are \ncritical for Uzbekistan\u2019s inclusive growth. \n \n4. \nSmall businesses play an important role in the economy, contributing 57% to GDP and \nabsorbing 80% of employment in 2015.5 In 2015, small businesses produced 98% of agricultural \noutput,  87%  of  retail  trade,  67%  of  construction,  51%  of  services,  39%  of  manufacturing,  and \n27%  of  exports.6 As  of  2015,  Uzbekistan  had  225,998  active  small  and  microenterprises  and \n227,646 individual entrepreneurs. About 80% of small businesses operated outside the capital.  \nWith  17.3%  the  rural  poverty  rate  exceeds  the  urban  poverty  rate  of  10.6%  pointing  to  a \nsignificant income disparity between rural and urban Uzbekistan. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Financing partner: the Government of Luxembourg.  \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  TA  for  preparing  the  Small  Business  Finance \n\n4  In 2014 and 2015, 330,000 migrant workers returned to Uzbekistan. ADB. 2016. Asian Development Outlook 2016: \n\nProject (TA 8986-UZB). \n\nAsia's Potential Growth. Manila. \n\n5  Effective 1 July 2014, the government groups small businesses in the following categories: (i) microenterprises, (ii) \nsmall  enterprises,  and  (iii)  individual  entrepreneurs.  A  microenterprise  is  defined  as  not  employing  more  than  20 \nstaff in industry, 10 in services, and 5 in trade and catering. A small enterprise is defined as not employing more \nthan 100 employees in the light industry, food, and construction sectors; 100 in industry; 50 in agribusiness; and 25 \nin  services,  retail  trade,  and  catering.  Individual  entrepreneurs  are  defined  as  persons  engaged  in  business \nactivities.  Government of  Uzbekistan.  2014.  Presidential  Decree  No.  4609:  About  additional  measures  for  further \nenhancement of the investment climate and the business environment in the Republic of Uzbekistan. Tashkent. \n6  Government of Uzbekistan, State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Statistics. 2016. Statistical Review \n\nof the Republic of Uzbekistan. Tashkent.    \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nThe financial system is dominated by banks, which control 94% of finance sector assets. \n5. \nEight state-owned banks control 75% of banking assets and provide the bulk of credit to state-\nowned  entities.    During  2011\u20132015,  bank  credit  to  small  businesses  substantially  increased \nfrom  4.5%  to  7.1%  of  GDP,  reflecting  a  compound  annual  growth  rate  (CAGR)  of  34.1%. \nHowever, lending to small businesses still represents less than one-third of overall bank credit, \nwhich  is  insufficient  given  their  economic  significance.  Eighty  percent  of  small  businesses  are \nstill being funded by family and friends and informal resources. Access to finance remains a key \nconstraint for private business growth.   \n \n6. \nSignificant  cost  of  funding,  perceived  risks,  and  administrative  costs  associated  with \nlending require banks to charge interest rates that range from 11%-25% for local currency and \n6%-15%  for  foreign  currency  loans.  Especially  individuals  and  small  businesses  borrow  at \nhigher  rates.  Bank\u2019s  focus  on  traditional  collateral  based  rather  than  cash  flow-based  lending \nprocesses undermine the ability of small businesses to borrow from banks. \n \n7. \nAlthough  bank  credit  outside  the  capital  represents  about  65%  of total  credit,  universal \naccess  to  finance  for  private  individuals  and  small  businesses  in  rural  areas  is  heavily \nconstrained  by  weak  rural  branch  networks  and  limited  mobile  banking  services.  Also,  most \nbank loan products carry a tenor of up to 1 year, irrespective of farm cash flows generated by \nthe multiyear agricultural product cycles. Small businesses have limited business sophistication \nand  skills,  which  impede  their  growth,  with  surveys  indicating  that  they  lack  access  to \ninformation on market opportunities, suppliers, competitors, technology, and banking products.7 \nLow financial literacy of small businesses and low-income households, many of which are led by \nwomen, limit their access to financial services and their ability to invest and grow.  \n \n8. \nCompared  with  transition  economies  in  Eastern  Europe,  the  South  Caucasus  and \nCentral Asia, Uzbekistan\u2019s depth and efficiency of financial intermediation is low, as evidenced \nby the low private credit-to-GDP ratio of 24.9% in 2015 and high lending\u2013deposit rate spreads, \nwhich range from 12% to 15%. The loan-to-deposit ratio surged from 89% in 2012 to 120% in \n2015,  reflecting  limited  availability  of  deposits.  While  deposits  represented  the  bulk  of  bank \nfunding  in  2015,  banks  obtained  87%  of  deposits  from  state-owned  enterprises  and  private \ncorporations, and only 13% from retail customers in 2015, indicating a volatile deposit base.8 A \n2014  survey  showed  that  40%  of the  adult  population  had  savings  accounts,  but  only  2%  had \nsaved with financial institutions.9 Deposit mobilization is undermined by public mistrust in banks, \nwhich is compounded by administrative hurdles in withdrawing cash from bank accounts.10 \n \nIn 2012\u20132015, banks\u2019 Basel I capital adequacy ratios (CARs) averaged 24%.11 However, \n9. \nthe introduction of Basel III capital adequacy, and mandatory full compliance with it by 2019, will \nrequire  banks  to  meet  additional  prudential  measures,  including  a  liquidity  coverage  ratio  and \ncapital charges for operational and market risk, which will likely require additional capital. \n \n\n                                                 \n7  Center  for  Economic  Research.  2014.

Depositors  face \n\ndifficulties in withdrawing cash; cash withdrawals are subject to fees of up to 20%. \n\n11 Basel I only measures credit risk. \n\n\f3 \n\nThe  Central  Bank  of Uzbekistan (CBU)  reported  an  average  nonperforming  loan (NPL) \n10. \nratio of less than 1% in 2015. 12 However, Moody\u2019s Investors Service estimated a more realistic \nNPL  ratio  of  7%  for  banks  for  2015.13 The  expected  decline  in  economic  growth  is  likely  to \nadversely  affect  borrowers\u2019  debt  service  capacity  and  banks\u2019  asset quality  during  2016.  Banks \nreported  solid  profitability  and  the  return  on  average  assets  averaged  2.2%  in  2015.  The \nslowdown in remittances and economic growth may adversely affect profitability in 2016.  \n \n11. \nGovernment  efforts  and  development  coordination. The Government of Uzbekistan \nhas implemented programs to support small business and banking sector growth.14 To improve \nthe banks\u2019 ability to assess borrower creditworthiness, the Law on Credit Information, which was \npromulgated  in  2011,  provided  for  the  establishment  of  a  public  credit  bureau,  which  covered \n19.4% of adults in 2015, compared to the 37.4% average of its Eastern European and Central \nAsian peers.15 It provides limited information from banks; exposures to other creditors such as \nnonbanks and information from mobile phone and utility providers are not covered. Assisted by \nthe  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC),  the  government  is  expanding  the  coverage  and \nimproving  the  quality  of  the  credit  bureau.  To  facilitate  registration  of  movable  assets  as  loan \ncollateral,  the  Law  on  Collateral  Registry,  which  was  promulgated  in  2013,  supported  the \nestablishment  of  an  electronic  secured  transactions  registry,  which  commenced  operations  in \n2014.  Laws  enacted  in  the  late  1990s  need  to  be  improved  to  facilitate  the  use  of  movable \nproperty  as  collateral.  Assisted  by  IFC,  the  government  has  prepared  draft  legal  amendments \nfor enactment in 2017. \n \n12. \nThe  following  multilateral  and  bilateral  development  partners  support  small  business \ndevelopment:  (i)  the  World  Bank  provides  credit  lines  to  farmers  and  small  agricultural \nenterprises; (ii) IFC supports the private sector through advisory services and investments; (iii) \nthe United Nations Development Programme has helped improve business registration; and (iv) \nthe  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  and  the  European  Union  have \npromoted horticulture and women-owned businesses16 in agriculture. \n \n13. \nThe Asian Development Bank\u2019s value addition and lessons. The project will support \nfinancial  inclusion,  especially  outside  the  capital,  by  providing  loans  to  small  businesses  for \nworking  capital  and  fixed  asset  investments.  The  project  will  improve  financial  inclusion  for \nwomen-owned businesses through (i) agreed business lending targets and appropriate gender \npolicies with the PFIs, and (ii) dedicated TA to foster financial literacy of women entrepreneurs. \nThe  attached  TA  will  strengthen  the  PFIs\u2019  lending  processes  and  product  offerings,  including \nmobile  banking  service  outreach  and  financial  literacy  training  to  small  business  clients.17 In \naddition, PFIs\u2019 environmental and social management systems (ESMSs) will be strengthened to \nsatisfy the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n \n14. \nSince 1996, ADB has provided five loans and five related capacity building TA projects \nto  PFIs  in  Uzbekistan.  In  2013,  ADB  made  an  equity  investment  in  Ipak  Yuli  Bank  (IYB).  The \n                                                 \n12 The NPL ratio is very low compared to Uzbekistan\u2019s regional peers. As the CBU criteria for asset classification are \n\nnot disclosed, the NPL ratio should be treated with caution.  \n\n13 Moody\u2019s Investors Service. 2015. Banking System Outlook: Uzbekistan.

The  PFIs  selected  for  this \nproject are majority privately owned banks and one leasing finance company with 49% private \nownership.  To  enable  PFIs  to  service  a  larger  range  of  job-creating  small  enterprises,  the \nmaximum  subloan  size  limit  is  set  at  $300,000  under  the  proposed  project,  up  from  $100,000 \nunder the previous loan (Loan 3043), which is still moderate compared to small business loan \nsizes issued by banks in the region.20 The leasing company will finance sound small businesses \nthat  do  not  meet  documentation  required  by  lenders.  ADB\u2019s  due  diligence  also  identified  the \nneed to upgrade PFI skills to match international financial reporting standards (IFRS) and avoid \nconflicts  of  interest  arising  from  the  use  of  external  auditors  for  advising  PFIs  in  preparing \nfinancial statements. Under the proposed project, the PFIs will hire accounting staff familiar with \nIFRS prior to loan disbursement.  \n \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  by  supporting  the \n15. \ndevelopment  of  financial  institutions  and  financial  services. 21 The  PFIs\u2019  emphasis  on  small \nbusinesses  in  underserved  areas  with  significant  income  and  employment  opportunities  will \npromote  inclusive  growth.  The  project  supports  the  government\u2019s  development  strategy  for \n2016\u20132020,  which  aims  to  accelerate  economic  growth,  promote  the  private  sector,  improve \naccess to finance, and address regional disparity.22 The government\u2019s development strategy is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 for Uzbekistan and is included in \nADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2016\u20132018 for Uzbekistan.23 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\n16. \nThe  impact  will  be  an  improved  contribution  of small  businesses  to  inclusive  economic \ngrowth and employment. The outcome will be increased sustainable provision of PFIs\u2019 financing \nto  small  businesses.  The  PFIs  are  expected  to  set  examples  for  other  financial  institutions  on \nhow to deepen their outreach while retaining good asset quality and funding private enterprise \nactivities that generate jobs. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB.  1996.

The \nattached  TA  will  support  the  PFIs  in  pursuing  small  business  lending  by  introducing  credit \nscoring  and  loan  origination  facilitated  by  mobile  devices,  such  as  tablet  computers,  and \nimprove financial literacy of PFIs\u2019 small business clients (footnote 17). \n \nD. \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $100.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \n18. \nresources  to  help  finance  the  project.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The \nfinancing plan is in Table 1.24 \n \n\nTable 1: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \n\nAmount ($ million) \n \n\nShare of Total (%) \n \n\nOrdinary capital resources (loan) \nSubborrowers (through equity contribution)a \n\n75.0 \n25.0 \n100.0 \na    Subborrowers  will  contribute  equity  to  the  subprojects  at  a  level  consistent  with  market  norms.  Based  on \n\n100.0 \n33.3 \n133.3 \n\nTotal \n\ndiscussions with the participating financial institutions, the average contribution is estimated at 25%. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nThe  government  will  relend  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  in  US  dollars  through  subsidiary \n19. \nloan agreements to PFIs that satisfy ADB\u2019s eligibility criteria set out in the project administration \nmanual  (PAM)  and  the  loan  and  project  agreements.25 The  government  is  expected  to  relend \nthe proceeds of the loan to the PFIs at the same tenor and grace period at which it received the \nfunds from ADB. The government\u2019s relending rate will be the interest rate charged by ADB for \nthe loan plus an appropriate margin to cover administrative and risk costs on the PFIs.26 \n \n20. \nThe  PFIs  will  use  the  loan  proceeds  to  finance  subloans  and  leases  to  eligible  small \nbusiness  subborrowers  to  support  working  capital  and  fixed  asset  investments.  Subloans  and \nleases may be issued in US dollars and sum, and priced by the PFIs at market rates that cover \n\n                                                 \n24 Every  $1.00  of  ADB  subloan  is  expected  to  mobilize  an  average  of  $0.33  of  small  business  investment  on  the \nassumption that PFIs will require eligible borrowers to provide, on average, 25% of a subproject\u2019s cost with equity. \nPFIs will determine the subborrower equity contributions based on the nature of the credit risk, which based on the \ncredit  policy  of  each  PFI  would  range  from  20%  to  30%  of the  project cost.  PFIs  will  contribute  capital  that  they \nmust  hold  against  subloans. The  PFIs\u2019 capital  and  loan loss  reserves  are the  first  defenses  against  subborrower \ndefaults, and incentivize PFIs to lend to creditworthy clients.  \n\n25  Based  on  each  PFI  absorptive  capacity,  subject  to  review  and  adjustments  during  project  implementation,  loan \nallocation is currently set as follows: Hamkorbank ($45 million), IYB ($38 million), UzbekLeasing International A.O. \n($10 million), and Davr Bank ($7 million).    \n\n26 The government will charge ADB\u2019s funding cost plus 0.2% per annum to the PFIs. The PFIs\u2019 interest rates carry the \ncost  for  (i)  loan  origination,  (ii)  the  provision  of  foreign  exchange  to  service  the  ADB  loan,  (iii)  the  repricing  risk \narising from the mismatch of 6 months of repricing of ADB loans (as subloans may carry a fixed interest rate up to \n5  years),  and  (iv) credit  risk  and  related capital charges.  Under the  current  foreign  exchange  regime,  the cost of \nproviding US dollars at payment dates is substantial, justifying the significant net interest margins.  \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nforeign exchange, credit, maturity, and interest rate risks. Such subloans will have a tenor of up \nto 5 years. PFIs will determine the creditworthiness of subborrowers and assume full credit risk. \nThe maximum subloan size is currently set at $300,000.  \n \nThe  Participating  Financial  Institutions.  The  PFIs  were  selected  among  commercial \n21. \nbanks  and  leasing  companies  that  expressed  interest  to  participate  in  the  project  and \nsubsequent detailed due diligence. ADB selected four PFIs: Hamkorbank, IYB, Davr Bank, and \nUzbekLeasing  International  A.O.  (ULC).    All  PFIs  have  business  strategies  reflecting  a  strong \ntrack  record  and  a  commitment  to  serving  rural  and  women-owned  small  businesses. \nHamkorbank  is  fully  privately  owned.  It  has  a  strong  regional  footprint,  with  95%  of  its  loans \nbooked outside the capital, and it serves nearly 22,000 borrowers, including about 6,000 women, \nwith an average loan size of $12,900 and a maximum loan size of $350,000 equivalent. IYB, in \nwhich  ADB  holds  13.4%  of  the  share  capital,  has  75%  private  ownership.  Relative  to \nHamkorbank, it caters to the upper small business client segment, with 62% of its loans booked \nin the regions outside the capital, an average loan size of $54,100, and a maximum loan size of \n$2  million  equivalent.  Davr  Bank,  a  local  private  bank,  has  a  growing  small  business  focus.  It \nprovides loans at an average size of $42,700 and a maximum loan size of $2 million equivalent. \nULC is 49% privately owned. It is a leasing company with 72% of its leases booked outside the \ncapital  with  an  average  lease  size  of  $117,000  and  a  maximum  lease  size  of  $2  million \nequivalent.  These  lenders,  which  use  alternative  strategies  and  distribution  channels,  will \nstimulate competition for the benefit of small business clients. \n \n22. \nAll  PFIs  meet  ADB\u2019s  eligibility  requirements  for  financial  intermediaries,  including  (i) \nfinancial  soundness  as evidenced  by  adequate capital,  asset quality,  liquidity,  and  profitability; \n(ii)  adequate  credit  and  risk  management  policies,  operating  systems,  and  procedures;  (iii) \nacceptable  corporate  and \nincluding \ntransparent  financial  disclosure  policies  and  procedures;  (iv)  sound  business  objectives  and \nstrategies;  (v)  adequate  policies  and  procedures \nto  assess  and  monitor  social  and \nenvironmental  impacts  of subprojects;  (vi)  autonomy  in  lending  and  pricing  decisions;  and  (vii) \nfinancial covenants determined by ADB.27 The three PFI banks meet prudential limits issued by \nthe CBU.28 Hamkorbank and IYB have adequate financial management systems in place. Davr \nBank and ULC have committed to recruit qualified accounting staff familiar with IFRS. All PFIs \nhave  passed  ADB\u2019s  integrity  and  anti-money  laundering  due  diligence.  Ownership,  business \nfocus, and financial performance of the PFIs are summarized in paras. 23\u201326.  \n\nfinancial  governance  and  management  practices, \n\n23. \nHamkorbank.  Founded in 1991, Hamkorbank has 30% foreign ownership (15% owned \nby IFC and 15% by FMO, the Netherlands Development Finance Company). Its small business \nloan  book  ($284  million  in  2015)  is  estimated  to  grow  at  a  CAGR  of  25%  by  2021,  compared \nwith  35%  during  2012\u20132015.  Hamkorbank\u2019s  CAR  of  13.6%  at  the  end  of  2015  exceeded  the \nCBU  minimum  of  10%  in  2015.  Hamkorbank  lends  to  small  business  borrowers  involved  in \nindustry  (32.6%),  trade  (27.3%),  services  (8.3%),  and  agriculture  (5%).  Hamkorbank\u2019s  asset \nquality is sound, with an NPL ratio of 0.2% in 2015. Loan loss reserve (LLR) coverage remained \nsatisfactory,  representing  107.7%  of  NPLs  in  2015.  Hamkorbank  is  profitable.  Its  net  income \nincreased by 55% to $34 million in 2015 because of robust loan growth and a stable net interest \nmargin of 7.4%, while its return on average assets improved to 3.8% in 2015 from 3.7% in 2014. \nIn  2015,  Hamkorbank  sourced  70%  of  its  funding  through  deposits  and  supplemented  the \nremaining 30% through borrowings. In February 2016, the CBU suspended certain Hamkorbank \nforeign  exchange  operations  for  6  months  due  to  noncompliance  with  foreign  exchange \n\n                                                 \n27  ADB. 2008.

The resumption of full foreign exchange operations will be a condition \nfor disbursement of the loan to Hamkorbank.  \n \n24. \nIpak  Yuli  Bank.  This  bank  was  incorporated  in  1990.  In  April  2013,  ADB  became  a \nshareholder  of  IYB,  holding  13.4%  of  shares  at  the  end  of  2015.  IYB\u2019s  small  business  loan \nportfolio  ($271  million  at  the  end  of  2015)  comprised  78%  of  the  total  loan  portfolio  and  is \ntargeted to grow at a CAGR of 20% by 2021. With 40% of small business loans issued outside \nthe  capital,  IYB  plans  to  increase  its  rural  coverage  through  expansion  of  a  regional  branch \nnetwork and e-banking. Its CAR was 12.6% at the end of 2015, down from 16.2% at the end of \n2013. The decline in its CAR reflects the increase of 90% in risk-weighted assets on the back of \na  growing  loan  book  compared  with  a  55%  increase  in  total  capital.  Portfolio  quality  is \nsatisfactory  and  has  improved,  with  an  NPL  ratio  of  2.1%  of  gross  loans  at  the  end  of  2015 \ncompared  to  3.8%  at  the  end  of  2013.  LLR  coverage  of  NPLs  comprised  a  very  comfortable \n190.0% in 2015 and 215.4% in 2014, up from 124.7% in 2013. IYB\u2019s profitability is strong, with a \nreturn on average assets ratio of 2.3% in 2015, supported by a solid net interest margin and fee-\nbased earnings. Net income increased to $13.1 million in 2015 from $11.0 million in 2014. IYB \nhad a stable funding profile in 2015, with customer deposits representing 80% of total funding \nand long-term debt from international financial institutions accounting for 17% of total funding. \n \n25. \nDavr  Bank.  Established  in  2001,  Davr  Bank  is  a  small  private  bank  lending  to  small \nbusinesses (91% of total loan portfolio). It expects its small business loan book ($43.5 million in \n2015) to grow at a CAGR of 25% by 2021, compared with 58% during 2012\u20132015. Davr Bank \ntargets to increase lending outside the capital by 25% each year from 2016 to 2021. It increased \nits lending to women entrepreneurs from $0.5 million in 2012 to $12.4 million in 2015, and it is \nprojected  to  reach  $22.3  million  by  2021.  Davr  Bank\u2019s  CAR  remained  high  at  21.8%  in  2015, \nthough  it  had  declined  from  22.0%  in  2014.  This  reduction  reflects  only  a  22%  rise  in  total \ncapital versus 71% in risk-weighted assets driven by the bank\u2019s strong loan growth. Davr Bank \nforecasts  CAR  at  an  average  of  19.7%  during  2016\u20132019  due  to  solid  profitability  and  the \nissuance  of  new  shares.  Its  asset  quality  is  satisfactory,  with  an  NPL  ratio  of  0.3%  and  LLR \ncoverage at 110% of NPLs in 2015. Fueled by higher fee and commission income, Davr Bank\u2019s \nprofitability  was  strong,  with  a  return  on  assets  of  6.6%  by  the  end  of  2015.  Net  income \nincreased  to  $4.7  million  in  2015  from  $3.3  million  in  2012.  It  sources  its  funding  primarily \nthrough customer deposits, which made up 82.7% of total funding in 2015. \n \n26. \nUzbekLeasing International A.O. Established in 1996, ULC is the third-largest lessor in \nthe country. Its shareholders are the National Bank of Uzbekistan for Foreign Economic Activity \n(41.6%),  Malayan  Banking  (19.7%),  and  Uzbek-Oman  Investment  Company  (38.7%).  About \n90%  of  ULC\u2019s  clients  are  small  enterprises.  It  offers  direct  finance  leases  and  sale  and \nleaseback transactions. Manufacturing (44%), construction (21%), and services (15%) represent \nkey sectors for ULC leasing products. About 10% of ULC clients are women\u2019s businesses. With \n80%  of  leases  provided  outside  Tashkent,  ULC  has  a  strong  rural  outreach.  ULC\u2019s  lease \nportfolio is projected to grow by a CAGR of 16% by 2021, increasing from $34 million in 2015. \nULC\u2019s  CAR  in  2015  was  a  robust  40.9%,  allowing  enough  room  for  growth  and  to  cushion \nagainst loan losses. In 2015, ULC raised capital through the issuance of new shares. Its asset \nquality is strong, with an NPL ratio of 0.1% and LLR coverage at 100% in 2015. ULC had return \non assets of 10.3% and return-on-equity ratio of 27.7% in 2015 due to high net interest margin. \nBorrowings  from  its  shareholders  and  international  financial  institutions  constitute  75%  of  total \nfunding. \n \n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n27. \nThe Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency. The PFIs will be the implementing \nagencies.  Each  PFI  will  establish  a  project  implementation  unit  to  administer  the  project.  The \nPFIs  will  monitor  and  report  on  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  and  compliance  with  environmental \nand social safeguards requirements and agreed covenants.

The TA  will  (i)  strengthen  PFIs\u2019  credit  underwriting  policies  and  procedures, (ii)  develop a \ncredit-scoring and loan-origination system facilitated by mobile devices for small business loans, \n(iii)  improve  rural  outreach  by  establishing  mobile  loan  processing,  and  (iv)  strengthen  PFIs\u2019 \nfinancial literacy programs for their small business clients. \n \n29. \nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $650,000,  of  which  $500,000  will  be  financed  on  a  grant \nbasis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund and administered by ADB. \nThe  PFIs  will  provide  counterpart  support  of  $150,000  in  the  form  of  staff,  logistical  support, \nfunding  consultants,  and  necessary  related  investments.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  the \nExecuting  Agency  and  the  relevant  PFIs  will  be  the  implementing  agencies  for  the  TA. \nConsultants  for  the  TA  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be made in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). The TA will be implemented from the date of TA effectiveness until 31 December \n2019.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n30. \nThe  economic  benefits  of  the  project  will  be  mainly  derived  from  the  increased \nproductivity  and  profitability  of  small  businesses.  Direct  economic  benefits  will  flow  from  the \ncontribution of small businesses to economic output and employment. The project will increase \nsustainable  provision  of  bank  loans  to  small  businesses,  with  a  special  effort  to  reach  those \n\n                                                 \n29 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n\f9 \n\noutside the capital and those majority owned by women. The project is expected to enhance the \nability  of  the  PFIs  to  deliver  financial  services  to  and  improve  financial  literacy  of  small \nbusinesses. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n31. \nADB  assessed  the  PFIs\u2019  financial  management  systems  and  classifies  the  overall  pre-\nmitigation financial management risk as moderate. Identified issues include Davr Bank\u2019s limited \nnumber  of  appropriately  qualified  accounting  staff  (especially  for  IFRS),  and  Davr  Bank\u2019s  and \nULC\u2019s  lack  of familiarity  with  ADB\u2019s  disbursement  and reporting  procedures.  An  action  plan  to \naddress  the  accounting  issues  is  detailed  in  the  PAM,  and  training  of  staff  in  ADB  project \nadministration  requirements  will  be  carried  out  by  ADB  within  6  months  of  the  approval  of  the \nproposed project. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and PFIs. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n32. \nThe project supports poverty reduction indirectly through its focus on improved access to \nfinance  by  small  businesses.  Rural  and  women\u2019s  small  businesses  are  expected  to  benefit \nsubstantially  and,  as  a  result,  boost  their  investments  and  help  maintain  and  expand \nemployment and provide stable incomes for themselves, their employees, and their suppliers. A \ngender  assessment  was  carried  out,  which  categorizes  the  project  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming. The project will enhance PFIs\u2019 gender policies and improve women\u2019s access to \nfinancial services, including credit. It will also improve their financial literacy.30 \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe  project  is  categorized  as  financial  intermediation  treated  as  C  for  involuntary \n33. \nresettlement and indigenous people safeguards, and as financial intermediation for environment. \nSubprojects  (i)  identified  on  the  ADB  Prohibited  Investment  Activities  List  provided  in  the \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement,  (ii)  classified  as  environment  category  A,  and  (iii)  classified  as \ncategory  B  that  are  in  the  ESMS  exclusion  list  are  not  eligible  for  financing  under  the  project. \nEligible  subprojects  will  comply  with  the  national  regulations.  ADB  carried  out  due  diligence  of \nthe  PFIs\u2019  ESMSs.  All  PFIs  must  have  ESMSs  in  place  that  satisfy  the  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement\u2019s  requirements  prior  to  the  first  disbursement  of  their  respective  loans.  The  TA  will \nprovide  assistance  in  capacity  strengthening  and  monitoring  to  help  PFIs  keep  their  ESMS \noperations in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement.31  \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.32 The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs.
