BTH, \n3. \nwhich  generates  nearly  one-third  of  the  PRC\u2019s  gross  domestic  product,  is  also  the  country\u2019s \nworst-polluted  region.  It  consistently  experiences  poor  air  quality  caused  by  an  excessive \nreliance  on  coal  in  the  energy  mix,  high  concentration  of  energy-  and  pollution-intensive \nindustrial  enterprises,  concentration  of cars  and vehicles,  and  weak  environmental  standards.6 \nAir  pollution  emergencies  occur  frequently  in  many  of  the  region\u2019s  cities.7 Nearly  228  million \npeople  in  the  region  live  in  cities  where  the  average  concentration  of  fine  particles  commonly \nknown  as  particulate  matter  less  than  2.5  microns  in  diameter  (PM2.5)  is  predominantly  higher \nthan  the  safe level.8 Ambient  air  pollution,  particularly  higher  concentration  of  PM2.5,  increases \nthe risk of cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases, and ischemic heart disease, and is the \nfifth leading cause of premature deaths in the PRC.9 Children, the sick, and the elderly are the \n\n                                                \n1  Green financing platform is a term used to describe the project\u2019s financing approach which includes a set of diverse \n\nfinancial products with a common objective, which will also be adopted by a group of partner domestic banks. \n\n2  The greater BTH region consists of the Beijing and Tianjin municipalities;  Hebei, Henan, Shandong,  Shanxi, and \nLiaoning provinces; and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1. \n\n3  Based on various data, these sectors combined are responsible for nearly 95% of air pollution in the BTH region. \n4  For the industrial sector, enterprises with fewer than 1,000 employees and total assets of less than CNY400 million \n\nare SMEs. \n\n5  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2015.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors: \nProposed  Policy-Based  Loan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei  Air  Quality \nImprovement\u2013Hebei Policy Reforms Program. Manila. \n\n6  Air  quality  index  (AQI)  is  a  common  measure  of  the  quality  of  air  and  its  potential  health  impacts.  AQI  includes \nconsideration of six atmospheric pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide,  particulate matter less than 2.5 microns \nin  diameter  (PM2.5),  carbon  monoxide,  ozone,  and  particulate  matter  10  micrometers  or  less  in  diameter.  In  the \nPRC, the AQI is categorized from 50 (excellent) to 500 (severe pollution). \n\n7  In December 2015, Beijing Air Pollution Emergency Headquarters issued a \u2018red alert\u2019 was issued for Beijing. The \nAQI threshold for a red alert is greater than 500 for 1 day, greater than 300 for 2 successive days, or greater than \n200 for 4 successive days. \n\n8  The PRC standard for PM2.5 concentration is 35 micrograms per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m3), compared with 10 \u00b5g/m3 for \n\nthe World Health Organization. In 2015, the region\u2019s annual average PM2.5 concentration was 73 \u00b5g/m3. \n\n9  Health  Effects  Institute  and  Tsinghua  University.  2016.  New  Study:  Air  Pollution  from  Coal  a  Major  Source  of \n\nHealth Burden in China. Boston.  \n\n \n\n\fmost vulnerable to such adverse effects. Exposure to high levels of PM2.5 contributes to about 1 \nmillion  premature  deaths  annually  in  the  PRC,  with  a  disproportionate  number  of  these  in  the \nBTH  region.  The  cost  of  premature  mortality  to  the  national  economy  is  estimated  as \napproximately 7.5% of the gross domestic product.10 Together, these are compelling reasons to \naddress the region\u2019s air quality issue. \n \n4. \nThe Government of the PRC is committed to improve air quality in the BTH region and \nhas  made  good  progress.  In  2012,  the  State  Council  promulgated  new  ambient  air  quality \nstandards  that  tightened  the  concentration  limit  of  six  atmospheric  pollutants  (footnote  6).  In \n2013,  the  government  launched  a  nationwide  Comprehensive  Action  Plan  for  Air  Pollution \nPrevention and Control (CAAP), 2013\u20132017, the first plan of its kind in the PRC, which outlined \nthe most stringent air pollution control measures in the PRC\u2019s history.11 Since the CAAP launch, \nair quality has gradually improved in the BTH region (footnote 11), but is still far below national \nand  World  Health  Organization  standards  (footnote  8).  The  CAAP  pairs  well  with  the  PRC\u2019s \ncommitment  to  peak  its  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emissions  by  2030  under  the  Paris  Agreement \nbecause coal  combustion  is  the  single-largest  source for  both  air  pollution  and  CO2  emissions \n(footnote  9).  Since  the  BTH  region  is  also  responsible  for  about  40%  of  the  country\u2019s  CO2 \nemissions,  it  is  a  common  top  priority  under  both  air  quality  and  climate  change  policy  goals. \nThe  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan  (2016\u20132020)  has  reaffirmed  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to \naccelerate air quality improvement and includes mandatory targets.12 \n \nDespite  a  promising  start,  tougher  challenges  remain  to  further  improve  air  quality. \n5. \nCAAP  helped  accelerate  the  early  retirement  of  surplus  industrial  capacity  and  galvanized \nactions  for  cost-effective,  end-of-pipe  measures  to  yield  quick  results. 13  But  many  similar \ninternational experiences have shown that air quality improvements require sustained long-term, \ncoordinated, and multisector efforts. Since air pollution easily migrates to neighboring areas, a \nBTH  region-wide  approach  is  also  essential. 14  These  requirements  pose  significant  new \nchallenges for national, provincial, and city authorities in the BTH region that traditionally rely on \na sector-specific and city- or province-specific approach and are structured accordingly. \n \n6. \nSome  important  sectors  and  segments  need  increased  attention  and targeted  support. \nAir quality is generally considered an urban issue that tends to ignore, for example, agriculture \nsector (biomass burning) and rural energy consumption, which together are responsible for 15% \nof  the  region\u2019s  PM2.5 emissions.  Similarly,  SMEs  are  key  economic  players  in the  BTH  region, \naccounting for about 60% of industrial pollution.15 But, because of SMEs\u2019 lack of knowledge in \nadvanced and energy-efficient technologies, weak understanding of their cost-benefit evaluation, \nand,  most  importantly,  difficulties  in  accessing  commercial  credit, 16  they  are  seriously \nconstrained in taking actions to reduce pollution and emissions and are about 40% less energy \n                                                \n10 World  Bank  and  Institute  for  Health  Metrics  and  Evaluation.  2016.

Compared with 2013, the annual average \n\nconcentration of PM2.5 in the BTH region declined by 9.8% in 2014 and by a further 11.3% in 2015. \n\n12 The Thirteenth Five-Year Plan requires (i) > 80% days with good air quality (less than 100 AQI) per year for cities at \nor above prefecture level, and (ii) 18% reduction in number of cities that do not meet the PM2.5 national standard. \nGovernment of the PRC. 2016. Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020. Beijing. \n\n13 \u201cEnd-of-pipe\u201d actions require pollution control devices to scrub pollutants, which are effective for quick outcomes. \n14 A performance evaluation of the CAAP by the Clean Air Alliance of China found that 20% of PM2.5 was a result of \n\nregional transmission from neighboring provinces. \n\n15 Yao  Guoyan.  2012.  SMEs  should  actively  undertake  the  corporate  environmental  responsibility.  Environmental \n\n16  Banks  consider  SME  transactions  highly  risky  and  require  good  credit  ratings  or  high  levels  of  collateral,  which \n\nProtection. 7. pp. 52\u201353. \n\nmany SMEs cannot provide.   \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fefficient than large enterprises in the same sector.17 Energy service companies (ESCOs), which \nact  as  developers  for  energy  efficiency  improvement  projects  of  SMEs  and  assume  the \ntechnical  and  performance  risks,  can  overcome  many  of  these  barriers  and  help  SMEs.  But \nESCOs  are  generally  SMEs  themselves  and  face  similar  hurdles  accessing  credit. 18  The \ngovernment  established  green  credit  policies  in  2007  and  then  revamped  them  in  2012  as \nGreen  Credit  Guidelines  to  encourage  banks  to  support  green  industries  and  projects.  But \ncommercial  banks  appetite  for  green  financing  is  still  limited  to  large  polluting  and  excess \ncapacity  enterprises  instead  of  SMEs  or  ESCOs.  A  targeted  approach  combining  credit \nenhancement  and  tailored  financing  can  unlock  investments.  But  there  is  no  financing  vehicle \nthat can directly address these needs in the region. \n \n7. \nThe  CAAP  alone  requires  CNY1.8  trillion  in  investments,  of  which  CNY250  billion  is \nneeded  in  the  BTH  region.  About  CNY6.6  trillion  is  needed  to  meet  low-carbon  and  clean \nenergy targets in the thirteenth plan. The scale of investment is a serious challenge, but bigger \nchallenges  are  to address market failures  and  channel financing  into  these environmental  and \nlow-carbon  projects  for  which  returns  are  modest,  perceived  risks  are  high,  and,  despite \nconducive policies, commercial banks are hesitant to do transactions.  \n\n \n8. \nThe government  requested  ADB to  design the  project  and to  establish  a  GFP so as to \nmobilize  domestic  financing  to  air  quality  improvements  in  the  BTH  region  by  leveraging  ADB \nloan proceeds. The project will use the financial intermediation loan (FIL) modality, which is the \nmost  appropriate  lending  instrument  to  aggregate  diverse  projects  across  many  sectors  in the \nBTH region for which the financing requirements are not large enough to warrant direct lending \nby  ADB.  It  also  enables  ADB  and  the  government  to  establish  partnerships  with  local \ncommercial  banks  and  domestic  financial  institutions  to  enable  financing  of  such  projects  on \ncommercial  terms.  This  modality  was  also  employed  in  similar  energy-efficient  and  emission-\nreduction projects in the PRC during 2008\u20132015 and has proved highly successful.19 The GFP \nbuilds on the lessons learned.20 \n \nThe  GFP  will  offer  three  complementary  financial  products:21 (i)  credit  guarantees  to \n9. \nenable  commercial  financing  from  banks,  (ii)  debt  financing  through entrusted  loans,22 and  (iii) \nfinancial leasing for purchasing energy-efficient industrial equipment and other goods to obviate \nthe need for large capital for SMEs and ESCOs.23 In addition, GFP may make short-term equity \n                                                \n17 International Energy Agency. 2015.

Manila. \n\n20 Lessons  include  that  (i)  capacity  of  the  financial  intermediary  is  a  crucial  factor;  (ii)  in  previous  FILs,  credit  risks \nwere borne by provinces or industrial entities, which led to a risk-averse approach in appraising transactions; and \n(iii) more rigorous due diligence can avoid high attrition rate among borrowers. \n\n21 These are broadly in line with the Group of Twenty and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \n\nguidance note on diversification of financial instruments for infrastructure and SMEs. \n\n22 An  entrusted loan  refers  to  the  extension  of  credit  by  a bank  as an  agent  of  entrusted  funds  from  the  GFP.  The \n\nbank will administer the debt, but assumes no credit risk. \n\n23 In leasing arrangements, the equipment is owned by the financial leasing company.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\finvestments  in  promising  start-ups  specializing  in  advanced  low-carbon  technologies  to  help \novercome barriers of lack of credit history and the collateral.24 The credit guarantees will ensure \nthat technically sound and financially viable subprojects with high  energy-saving and pollution-\nreduction  potential  but  lack  collateral  will  meet  the  commercial  banks\u2019  requirements.  The \nfinancial intermediary will partner with commercial banks to offer entrusted loans at near market \nrates,  and  partner  banks  are  encouraged  to  provide  cofinancing.  GFP  can  provide  lease \nfinancing through financial leasing companies.25 The GFP will also be in close partnership with \nsome major  commercial  banks,  thereby  not  only  catalyzing  large  cofinancing from commercial \nbanks but also enhancing their capacity and interest in similar investments. \n \n10. \nThe importance of good air quality in the BTH region, which is home to nearly one-third \nof the PRC\u2019s total population, cannot be emphasized enough. It is a basic human need and a \ncritical component of Sustainable Development Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and well-being for \nall  at  all  ages  and  Goal  11:  Make  cities  and  human  settlements  inclusive,  safe,  resilient  and \nsustainable.  Given  the  challenges  and  required  actions  (para.  5)  in the  BTH  region,  ADB  and \nthe government have agreed in principle on a multiyear lending support program during 2016\u2013\n2020, which is well aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy priority of managing climate \nchange  and  the  environment  and  the  government\u2019s  thirteenth  plan.26 ADB\u2019s  planned  lending \nsupport during 2016\u20132020 will be about $500 million per year and will focus on (i) strengthening \npolicy  and  regulatory  framework  in the  region,  (ii)  developing  tailored  financing  approaches  to \nunlock and channel investments in right areas, and (iii) leapfrogging technology in key sectors. \nADB support will complement government and other development partners\u2019 actions, such as the \nWorld  Bank. 27  Yearly  ADB  lending  support  will  be  mutually  reinforcing  and  supported  by \nanalytical,  policy  advisory,  and  capacity  development  non-lending  work,  much  of  which  is  in \nprogress.28   \n \n11. \nThe  2015  policy-based  loan  (footnote  5)  was  ADB\u2019s  entry  point  to  address  the  BTH \nregion\u2019s air quality issue.

The details of individual projects under the framework will be mutually agreed. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fB. \n\nImpacts and Outcome \n\n12. \nThe impacts will be reduced air pollution and improved public health in the BTH region. \nThe outcome will be accelerated air quality improvements and CO2 emission reduction through \nscaled-up investments in green and pollution-reduction projects in the BTH region. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n13. \n\nThe outcome will be achieved through the following outputs: \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nOutput  1:  Established green financing  platform  and leveraged  commercial \nfinancing for pollution-reduction projects. The BTH region-dedicated platform \nwill  scale  up  investments  in  sectors  responsible  for  about  95%  of  the  region\u2019s \npollution. By 2022, at least CNY6 billion  will be leveraged from cofinanciers. \nOutput 2: Lowered barriers and scaled-up financing for small and medium-\nsized  enterprises  and  energy  service  companies  from  the  green  financing \nplatform.  By  2022,  SMEs  and  ESCOs  will  receive  at  least  CNY1  billion \ninvestment  from  and  as  a  result  of  the  GFP.  By  working  closely  with  domestic \nbanks, the project will strengthen their capacity and interest in SMEs and ESCOs \nfinancing.   \nOutput 3: Strengthened capacity in new financial products and to appraise \nand \nfinancial \nintermediary and partner entrusted banks  to build their capacity in new financial \nproducts,  enhance  safeguard  measures  as  reflected  in  the  environmental  and \nsocial management system (ESMS), and help them to better understand how to \nunderwrite  and  appraise  green  and  pollution-reduction  projects  and  their \nimplementation.30 \n \n\nimplement  green  financing  projects.  Work  closely  with \n\nD. \n\nKey Features of the Project \n\nThe  state-owned  China  National  Investment  and  Guaranty  Corporation  (I&G)  was \n14. \nselected  by  the  government  to  set  up  the  GFP  because  its  core  business  areas  are  credit \nenhancement, assets management, and provision of investment and guarantee in many sectors. \nMoreover, I&G has an impressive track record of investment and guaranty operations in many \nBTH  provinces  and  cities  and  has  worked  satisfactorily  on  a  previous  international  financing \ninstitution\u2019s project.31 I&G will be the financial intermediary and the executing and implementing \nagency. The State Development & Investment Corporation (SDIC), the controlling state-owned \nenterprise of I&G, will provide credit enhancement for I&G.32 To assist I&G in its debt financing \noperation, the Bank of Beijing (BOB) has been selected through a competitive process to act as \none  of  the  entrusted  banks. 33  Many  other  large  commercial  banks  have  expressed  strong \ninterest to act as an entrusted bank and/or cofinance subprojects selected by GFP.34 \n                                                \n30 A capacity development technical assistance is being processed (50096-003) to supplement GFP implementation \nand provide essential risk-mitigating measures. It aims to (i) improve the GFP\u2019s reach across all sectors, provinces, \nand cities through targeted outreach efforts; (ii) increase readiness of the subprojects; (iii) design and develop an \ninformation technology-based online platform for application by potential subprojects; and (iv) improve the capacity \nof  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  participating  banks  and  financial  institutions,  and  subborrowers  in \nappraising such projects and implementing the ESMS.  \n\n31 World Bank\u2013Global Environment Facility project to provide first loss guarantee for energy efficiency projects. \n32 SDIC is one of the PRC\u2019s largest investment corporations with $76.2 billion equivalent total assets in 2015.  \n33 BOB,  as  an  entrusted  bank,  will  act  as  the  agent  of  I&G  (the  principal).  BOB  will  administer  the  entrusted  loans \naccording to the terms and rates agreed with I&G, which will bear the loan risks. BOB will also cofinance projects. \nIn this regard a memorandum of understanding was signed with BOB on 3 November 2016.  \n\n34 Including  China  Development  Bank,  China  Merchant  Bank,  Guangfa  Bank,  China  CITIC  Bank,  and  China \n\nEverbright Bank.  \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fTo strengthen GFP targeting and ensure its financial viability, apart from entrusted loans, \n15. \nthe platform is designed as follows: (i) up to \u20ac91.6 million of the ADB loan amount will be used \nto  support  credit guarantees  to  enhance  the  credit  of  subborrowers  so  as  to  meet  commercial \nbanks\u2019  credit  requirements,  (ii)  up  to  \u20ac91.6  million  of  the  ADB  loan  amount  will  target  leasing \noperations,  and  (iii)  short-term  equity  investments  will  be  limited to  \u20ac25 million.  To manage its \nliquidity  reserve for  credit guarantees, I&G  will  use ADB  loan proceeds to invest  in high  credit \nquality and highly liquid financial assets.35 \n \nThe  GFP  will  leverage  large  commercial  cofinancing.  An  estimated  \u20ac1.2  billion \n16. \ncofinancing  and  counterpart  funds  is  expected  from  the  first  batch  of  subprojects.  Since  the \npayback  period  of  subprojects  is typically  3\u20138  years,  as the  initial  batch of  subloans  is repaid, \nthe proceeds will be relent to another set of subprojects. For this purpose, a reflow account will \nbe established. It is expected that reflows from the first batch will be relent to additional batches \nof  subprojects  with  an  estimated  investment  of  \u20ac2.4  billion.  Thus,  the  GFP  is  expected  to \nleverage \u20ac3.6 billion.  \n \nE. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe  investment  cost  of  the  first  batch  of  subprojects  is  estimated  to  be  \u20ac1,675  million \n\n17. \n(Table 1), including the financial charges on entrusted and cofinancing loans. \n \n\nTable 1: Indicative Investment Amounts for First Batch of Subprojects \n(\u20ac million) \n\n \n\n \n\nAmount \n\n1.

The amount of taxes and duties to be financed by ADB (i)  is within the \nreasonable threshold identified during the country partnership strategy preparation process, (ii) does not represent \nan  excessive share of  the investment  plan, and  (iii)  applies  only  to  ADB-financed  expenditures.  The  financing of \ntaxes  and  duties  is  considered  relevant  to  project  success.  The  interest  cost  of  ADB  loan  proceeds  during \nimplementation  has  been  estimated  at  the  5-year  forward  euro  interbank  offered  rate  plus  a  spread  of  0.5%. \nCommitment charges for an ADB loan have been estimated at 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed \nloan  amount.  The  total  financial  charges  of  the  ADB  loan  during  implementation  have  been  estimated  at  \u20ac5.5 \nmillion.

Based  on  this,  the  average \nloan  maturity  is  12.95  years,  and  there  is  no  maturity  premium  payable  to  ADB.  The  loan  is \nexpected  to  leverage  \u20ac863.6  million  from  local  commercial  banks.38 Subborrowers  will  provide \nabout \u20ac330 million as counterpart contributions. \n \n19. \nThe ADB loan proceeds will be onlent from the Ministry of Finance to I&G through SDIC \non  identical  repayment,  tenors,  and  pricing  terms  of  ADB\u2019s  loan.

It  also  includes  guidelines  on \nthe  screening  and  appraisal  of  individual  transactions.  I&G  is  required  to  prepare  appraisal \nreports to verify compliance with selection criteria and obtain ADB\u2019s no objection for subprojects \nthat (i) are financed with retroactive financing, (ii) receive financing in excess of the free limit of \n\u20ac50 million, and (iii) are assessed as category A for the environment.  \n \nA  detailed  appraisal  of  the  11  representative  potential  subprojects  was  carried  out.40 \n22. \nThese projects include waste heat capture and delivery, agriculture waste utilization, distributed \nrenewable  energy,  energy  efficiency,  smart  transport  and  electrical  vehicles,  and  emission- \nreduction  and  are  spread  across  the  BTH  region.  The  representative  subprojects  cost  \u20ac340 \nmillion and would utilize about \u20ac124 million of the ADB loan. Another set of potential subprojects \nwith total investment needs of \u20ac1 billion is currently being appraised.  \n \nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n23. \nTechnical due diligence of representative subprojects (i) verified the technical feasibility \nand  appropriateness  of  the  proposed  technology  to  achieve  the  desired  energy  savings  and \npollution reductions; (ii)  verified estimated cost; and (iii) reviewed main contract packages to be \nprocured and proposed procurement methods. \n  \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n24. \nFinancial  due  diligence  confirmed  the  financial  viability  of  SDIC,  I&G,  and  BOB.  SDIC \nand I&G have a strong financial standing and are capable of meeting financial obligations and \ndebt  service  payments  without  difficulty. 41  The  integrity  due  diligence  of  I&G  showed  no \nnegative  findings.  Subprojects  and  subborrowers  will  need  to  meet  economic  and  financial \nviability  criteria  as  agreed  with  I&G  and  acceptable  to  ADB,  as  documented  in  the  PAM.

The external audit reports from 2012\u20132015 for SDIC, I&G, \nand BOB had unqualified opinion. BOB fully complies with the regulator\u2019s prudential regulations. \nThe financial management risks before mitigation were assessed to be moderate (footnote 41). \n \nProcurement risk assessment. Procurement will follow ADB\u2018s Procurement Guidelines \n27. \n(2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  applicable  to  FILs,  and  appropriate  procedures  will  be \nadopted. The procurement assessment was conducted on representative potential subprojects. \nIt  showed  that  most  of  subborrowers\u2019  procurement  practices  followed  established  domestic \ncommercial  practices,  and  procurement  procedures  aligned  with  the  PRC\u2019s  procurement  laws \nacceptable  to  ADB.  To  provide  guidance  on  this,  a  project-specific  procurement  manual  has \nbeen prepared and included in Appendix 5 of the PAM. \n \nCorruption  prevention.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \n28. \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  SDIC,  I&G,  and  BOB.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n29. \nThe project will have positive social impacts by reducing air pollution and mitigating the \nnegative economic impacts of the local pollution. Improved air quality will directly benefit 371.7 \nmillion people, including 14.6 million poor people in the BTH region. In addition, the project will \nindirectly create new employment opportunities. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \nThe  project  is  classified  financial  intermediary.  An  ESMS 44  was  developed  to  meet \n30. \nnational  laws  and  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  ESMS \nprovides guidance on (i) screening, categorization, and review of subprojects; (ii) organizational \nstructure and staffing, including skills and competencies in environmental and social areas; (iii) \ncapacity building; and (iv) monitoring and reporting. I&G and SDIC will be responsible for ESMS \nimplementation. The ESMS provides for the inclusion of environment category A subprojects. If \nany  such  subprojects  are  included,  ADB  will  review  and  approve  the  environmental  impact \nassessments,  which  must  meet  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements  on  disclosure  and \nconsultation. \n \n                                                \n42 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n43 ADB. 2005.
