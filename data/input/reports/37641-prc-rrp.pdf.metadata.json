Since  2000,  the \nMinistry  of  Water  Resources  has  been  changing  its  policy  and \nstrategy  from  a  flood-control  approach  to  a  river  basin-based \nintegrated  flood  management  approach.  The  policy  shift  is \neconomically  and  environmentally  sustainable  and  aims  to  be \nsocially  inclusive.  The  Project  will  support  the  implementation  of \nan area and time slice of Hunan's integrated flood-control program \nunder  the  Hunan  Provincial  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010), \nflood  control, \nfocusing  on  a  comprehensive \nmanagement,  and  forecasting  in  the  four  mountainous  river \nbasins\u2014Lishui,  Xiangjiang,  Yuanjiang,  and  Zishui.  Flood \nprotection  works  will  be  constructed  for  up  to  35  subprojects. \nto  strengthen \nNonstructural  measures  will  be  developed \nhydrological  monitoring,  improve  flood  forecasting,  and  enhance \nflood warning systems. An advisory technical assistance (TA) will \nbe provided to support sustainable flood management by assisting \nthe Provincial Water Resources Department (PWRD) to plan and \nassess  nonstructural  aspects  of \nflood  management  and \nstrengthen capacity in plan implementation. \n \nMany  cities  and  industrial  centers  in  the  PRC  are  adjacent  to \nmajor  rivers,  resulting  in  a  high  proportion  of  the  country's \neconomic  activity  being  at  risk  from  periodic  floods.  Major  floods \nand  poor  drainage  (waterlogging)  are  the  most  frequent  and \nsevere form of natural hazard in the PRC. Floods are a recurrent \nnatural  hazard  in  Hunan  Province.  They  may  be  localized  in  the \nfour  main  rivers  and  their  tributaries,  or  they  may  occur  through \ncumulative  effects  on  the  Dongting  Lake  area.  The  Lishui, \nXiangjiang,  Yuanjiang,  and  Zishui  rivers  drain  a  total  area  of \n179,000 square kilometers (km2) (84% of the provincial area), and \nare  home  to  56.4  million  people,  or  84%  of  the  provincial \npopulation.  Improved  management  and  control  of  floods  in  the \nmiddle and upper reaches of Hunan's four main mountainous river \nbasins  is  considered  urgent  to  secure  economic  growth  and \ndevelopment in Hunan. Reflecting a recent strategic shift, HnPG's \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nComponents and \nOutputs \n\n \nProject Investment Plan \n\n \n \n \n\nflood  management  efforts  under  the  Hunan  Provincial  11th  Five-\nYear  Plan  combine  flood-control  engineering  measures  with \nnonstructural  flood  management,  forecasting,  and  emergency \nresponse  systems  in  the  four  mountainous  river  basins  and  their \nflood-prone  municipal  and  county-level  cities.  This  is  deemed  to \nbe  a  more  cost-effective  approach  to  public  investment  in  flood \nprotection and management. \n \nThe  overall  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  to  enhance  sustainable \nand  inclusive  economic  growth  in  flood-prone  areas  of  Hunan \nProvince.  Priority  municipal  and  country  growth  centers  in  the \nmountain river basins will be targeted to reduce investor concerns \nover  floods,  thereby  facilitating  an  increase  in  investment  in  the \nindustrial  and  commercial  enterprises  that  drive  urban  and  rural \ngrowth  in  the  area.  The  Project's  main  outcome  will  be  to \npermanently reduce flood risks in priority municipality and county-\nlevel  cities  along  the  middle  and  upper  reaches  of  Hunan \nProvince's  four  main  river  basins.  The  lowered  risk  of  floods  will \nreduce  loss  of  life,  reduce  government  expenditures  on  flood \nrepairs  and  compensation,  reduce  private  property  losses,  and \nincrease  overall  investment  and  employment\u2014which  in  turn  will \ndrive industrial and commercial growth. \n \nThe  Project  comprises \nthree  main  components.  First, \nnonstructural  measures  will  strengthen  river  basin  and  provincial \nflood  management,  warning,  and  response  systems.  Second, \nstructural  measures  will  raise  flood-control  standards  in  priority \nlocations  as  identified  in  HnPG's  River  Basin  Flood  Control  Plan \nand  the  11th  Hunan  Province  Five-Year  Plan.  Construction  of \nstructural  works  will  require  resettlement  of  people  and  will \ndemand  careful  management  of \ntemporary  environmental \nimpacts.  Resettlement  and  mitigation  of  environmental  impacts \nwill be carried out in compliance with PRC regulations and Asian \nDevelopment  Bank \nrequirements.  Third, \n(ADB)  safeguard \nprovincial and local government project management systems will \nbe  established  and  domestic  management  and  monitoring \nsystems  will  be  strengthened.  An  additional  output  will  be \nimplemented with the grant financed TA. Under this output, priority \naspects of HnPG's provincial-level strategic plan will be developed \nor assessed, to support national policy developments in integrated \nflood management. \n \nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $497.4  million \nequivalent, including taxes and duties of $13.6 million equivalent. \nFinancial  charges  during  implementation  (comprising  interest \nduring  implementation)  are  estimated  at  $36.2  million.  Physical \nand price contingencies for the core subprojects are estimated at \n$16.8 million.  \n \n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\nSource \nA.  Asian Development Bank \nB.

The \ninterest  rate  will  be  at  the  same  LIBOR-based  rate  paid  by  the \nPRC and will be subject to the same terms and conditions as the \nPRC loan. HnPG will onlend the proceeds of the loan to the local \nforeign \nmunicipal  and  county  governments \nexchange cost of the subprojects. Onlending would be under the \nsame terms and conditions as the onlending to HnPG, including a \n26-year  loan  term  with  a  6-year  grace  period.  The  interest  rate \npayable  on  the  loan  would  be  subject  to  the  same  LIBOR-based \nterms and conditions as the loan to HnPG.  \n \nUntil 31 March 2013 \n \n30 September 2012 \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n\nfinance \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nHnPG  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project.  HnPG  has \nestablished a project leading group, headed by the Vice Governor \nof  Hunan  Province, \nto  oversee  project  preparation  and \nimplementation.  Located  in  the  PWRD,  the  provincial  project \nmanagement office (PPMO) will have day-to-day responsibility for \nproject implementation. The PPMO includes representatives from \nthe  three  main  line  agencies  responsible  for  the  Project\u2014the \nProvincial  Development  and  Reform  Committee,  Provincial \nFinance  Department,  and  PWRD.  The  PPMO  is  responsible  for \ndirecting  project  preparation  activities,  monitoring  resettlement, \nmanaging  environmental  impacts,  establishing  baseline  data  to \nmonitor  project  impacts,  and  assisting  participating  municipalities \nand  counties \ntheir  subprojects.  Participating \nmunicipal  and  county-level  cities  are  the  Implementing  Agencies \nfor  the  Project.  Each  participating  municipality  or  county  has  set \nup  a  local  project  leading  group  and  local  project  management \n\nin  managing \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\noffice  (LPMO)  to  coordinate  aspects  of  project  preparation  and \nimplementation in their jurisdictions. \n \nHunan Provincial Government \n \nEquipment,  materials,  goods,  and  services  for  ADB-financed \ncontracts  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines \nfor  Procurement.  Major  contracts  for  equipment  and  materials \nvalued  at  $1  million  equivalent  or  more  will  be  awarded  through \nADB\u2019s international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Smaller \npackages for equipment and materials valued at under $1 million \nequivalent  will  be  procured  following  national  competitive  bidding \n(NCB)  procedures.  Civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  $10 \nmillion  or  more  will  be  carried  out  using  ICB  procedures,  while \nthose  costing  less  than  $10  million  equivalent  will  be  carried  out \nusing  NCB  procedures  in  accordance  with  the  PRC\u2019s  Tendering \nand Bidding Law and related regulations. Shopping will be allowed \nfor  contracts  valued  at  $100,000  equivalent  or  less.  Foreign \ncontractors may bid on contracts using NCB procedures. \n \nThe Project will support provincial and local government capacity \nbuilding  in  flood  management  for  which  training  services  will  be \ncontracted \ninternational  and  domestic \ninstitutions using the Consultants\u2019 Qualification Selection method. \nUnder  the  Project,  69  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \nservices will be required and funded through counterpart funds.  \n \nExisting flood protection in the mountain river basin municipal and \ncounty-level cities is mostly in the range of 1 in 2-year flood return \nperiod  to  1  in  20-year  flood  return  period.1  The  \u201cwith  project\" \nsituation will raise the level of protection provided to a 1 in 20-year \nflood  return  period  in  the  case  of  county-level  cities,  and  to  1  in \n50-year flood return period for municipal level cities, and up to 1 in \n100-year  flood  return  period  for  three  key  municipal  cities.  The \ndirect  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  to  reduce  flood  risks  to \nresidents,  businesses,  and  industries  based  in  project  protected \nareas2  by  constructing  and  upgrading  structural  works;  reducing \nexposure  to  floods  through  property  acquisition  and  resettlement \nfrom  project  protected  areas;  and  reducing  vulnerability  to  floods \nthrough  nonstructural  measures, \nflood \nforecasting,  warning  and  emergency  response  systems,  and \nraised community awareness and preparedness in project areas. \nEmployees  and  suppliers  to  project  protected  areas  will  benefit \nfrom  reduced  disruptions  from  floods.  Indirect  and  unquantifiable \nimpacts include reduced loss of life, avoidance of injuries, reduced \nhospitalizations,  and  fewer  large-scale  emergency  evacuations\u2014\n\nthrough  specialist \n\nimproved \n\nincluding \n\n                                                 \n1  Flood  protection  for  a  1  in  2-year  flood  return  period  are  civil  works  designed  to  protect  people,  property  and \nfacilities against relatively low level floods events that occur on average once every two years. Flood protection for \na  1  in  100-year  flood  return  period  are  civil  works  designed  to  protect  against  major  floods  events  that  occur  on \naverage once every 100 years.  \n\n2 Project protected areas are locations that would have a higher risk of flooding without the Project. \n\n\f \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\nv\n\nall  of  which  will  reduce  the  fiscal  burden  that  flood  disasters \ncurrently cause the Government. \n \n\nat \n\nproject \n\nstart-up,  which \n\nRisks are grouped by project impact, outcome, and output. Impact \nrisks  are  increased  losses.  Impact  risks  involve  increased  losses \nresulting  from  the  population  in  flood  protected  areas  ignoring \ncontinued  flood  risks  above  design  standards,  which  could  be \nexacerbated  by  additional  migration  into  project  protected  areas. \nOutcome  and  output  risks  include:  (i)  heavy  floods  may  exceed \ninfrastructure  design  standards;  (ii)  incohesive  implementation  of \nstructural and nonstructural components of the flood management \nstrategy  resulting  from  a  lack  of  coordination  between  provincial \nand  local  government  agencies;  and  (iii) insufficient  counterpart \nbudget  funds  for  civil  works,  resettlement,  and  environment \nmanagement \ndelay \nimplementation.  Mitigation  measures  to  address  such  risks  are: \n(i) improve  flood  warning  and  emergency  response  systems  to \nbetter  prepare \nthe  roles  and \nresponsibilities  of  provincial  and  local  government  agencies,  and \ninteragency  coordination  mechanisms  are \nensuring \nfunctional;  and  (iii) continuously  monitor  the  financial  position  of \nmunicipalities  and  counties  to  ensure  that  they  are  prepared  to \nmeet annual fiscal requirements for project implementation.  \n \nAn  advisory  TA  grant  of  $500,000  will  be  provided  by  the \nGovernment of Spain and administered by ADB. The objective of \nthe  advisory  TA  is  to  strengthen  Hunan  Province's  capacity  to \nexecute  annual  planning  and  apply  management  systems  for \nflood management, and to assist the Province in assessing needs \nand strategies in nonstructural aspects of flood management. \n \n\nfloods;  (ii) clearly  define \n\ncould \n\nthat \n\nfor \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nand  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant  to  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Hunan \nFlood  Management  Sector  Project.  The  report  also  describes \nfor \nStrengthening Flood Management Sustainability in Hunan Province, and if the Board approves \nthe proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve ADB \nadministering the TA. \n \n\nthe  proposed  TA \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nIn  September  2004,  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  a  project  preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  (PPTA)  to  help  the  Hunan  Provincial  Government  (HnPG)  formulate  the \nProject.1 This report is based on findings of the PPTA, Government feasibility studies, findings \nof  ADB  missions,  and  discussions  with  Government  officials,  other  aid  agencies,  and \nstakeholders. The project design and monitoring framework (PDMF) is included in Appendix 1. \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nPRC\u2019s  rapid  economic  growth  in  recent  decades  has  been  key  in  raising  incomes  and \nreducing levels of poverty. The country's economic transformation from a largely agrarian-based \neconomy  to  an  increasingly  industrial  economy  has  resulted  in  rapid  urbanization.  Major  river \nsystems  such  as  the  Yangtze  river  basin  provide  a  range  of  key  resources,  including  fertile \nfloodplain soils, water for irrigation, navigation routes, and sources of hydroelectric power upon \nwhich  sustained  economic  growth  in  PRC  depends.  Historically,  trade,  commerce,  and \nindustry\u2014and, therefore, cities\u2014have developed along major rivers such as the Yangtze. The \nYangtze basin, in which Hunan Province is located, accounts for 40% of PRC's gross domestic \nproduct  (GDP).  Related  growth  and  development  increases  the  demands  on  river  basin \nresources and their floodplains. \n \n4. \nOver  the  past  20  years,  Hunan  Province  has  also  experienced  rapid  economic  growth \nand  urban  expansion.  The  Province's  cities  are  centers  of  government,  finance,  business, \neducation,  transportation,  agriculture,  and  manufacturing.  They  produce  machinery,  textiles, \nmetals,  chemicals,  paper  products,  mineral  products,  medicine,  and  processed  food.  Hunan's \nrural areas produce rice, fruit, livestock, and cash crops. Provincial GDP in 2004 was CNY464 \nbillion, representing 4% of national GDP, and has grown at 10.1% per year on average over the \npast  decade.  Rapid  economic  growth,  especially  in  urban  areas,  is  another  reason  for  the \nsteady increase of the urban population throughout the Province. The Province consists of 14 \nmunicipalities and has 66.3 million people (2003). Seventy percent of the municipal and county-\nlevel  cities are  in  mountain  river  basin  areas.  In  2004,  the  proportion  of  urban  population  was \n22.3% of the provincial total and is projected to increase to an estimated 33% by  2010. As of \n2003, 4.1 million rural poor, or 6.1% of the provincial population, were living under the national \npoverty  line  of  CNY900  per  year.  Under  guidelines  set  by  different  municipal  and county-level \ncities, about 1.3 million urban residents are deemed poor. Most of the poverty is concentrated in \nthe western mountainous areas, which are characterized by poor infrastructure. \n \n5. \nHunan Province borders the middle reaches of the Yangtze River to the north, while its \neastern, western, and southern areas are mountainous. The northern area, which accounts for \n25% of the Province's total area, comprises Dongting Lake (covering about 7% of the Province) \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Hunan Flood Management \n\nProject. Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\nand the low, flat floodplain of the Yangtze River. Hills in the central part of the Province provide \na transition zone between the surrounding mountains and the Yangtze floodplain. The Li, Xiang, \nYuan,  and  Zi  rivers,  collectively  termed  the  \u201cmountain  rivers\u201d,  flow  northward  to  deliver  runoff \nfrom the mountainous areas to Dongting Lake, which drains into the Yangtze River. Appendix 2 \ndescribes the flood risks that threaten the river basin urban and rural populations. \n \n6. \nHigh flood frequency, low levels of flood protection, and relatively high population growth \nrates in flood-prone areas contribute to the rising costs of floods. Flood damage in the Province \nwas  estimated  at  CNY0.76  billion  in  1991,  CNY1.87  billion  in  1993,  CNY3.09  billion  in  1994, \nCNY5.0 billion in 1995, CNY5.61 billion in 1996, and CNY10.9 billion in 1998. The 1996 flood \nkilled  130  people,  while  flashfloods  in  Loudi  municipality  in  2005  killed  77.  Because  of \nresidential and workplace proximity to riverbanks and dependence on agriculture in floodplains, \nmany people\u2014predominantly the poorest people\u2014are at risk from floods. Flood-related damage \nand disruption to mountain river-basin communities now rival the flood damage around Dongting \nLake.  Urban  flood  damage  can  reach  50%  of  the  damage  from  flood  events  along  mountain \nrivers.  Floods  limit  economic  growth  in  remote  regions  of  the  Province  where  growth  already \nlags behind the provincial average. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nDespite  major  public  investments  in  flood  protection  over  the  past  50  years,  flood \n7. \ndamage has increased. The challenge is to reverse that trend. The increase in flood damages, \ntogether with the occurrence in 1998 of major floods in the Yangtze and elsewhere in PRC, has \nprompted  a  review  of  policy  and  practice.  Policy  changes  that  favor  an  integrated  flood \nmanagement  (IFM)  approach  are  based  on  the  recognition  that  floods  cannot  be  completely \ncontrolled, structural works cannot completely eliminate flood risks, and escalating investment in \nflood prevention must be balanced with the acceptance of some residual risk. \n \nHunan Province has also placed emphasis on flood-control measures, particularly in the \n8. \narea around Dongting Lake, which is strategically important in managing floods in the Yangtze \nbasin. In line with the national policy of improving flood management and easing the social and \neconomic  burden  on  the  increasing  number  of  people  affected  by  floods,  HnPG  prepared  its \nFlood Control Plan in 1999 as part of the overall Hunan Province Comprehensive River Basin \nPlan (see Appendix 2 for the components and further details of the Plan). The Plan includes a \ncomprehensive  framework  for  managing  and  mitigating  floods  along  the  four  mountain  rivers \nand around Dongting Lake, including the Municipal and County-level City Flood Control Plan. A \nprovince-wide  analysis  of  the  flood-prone  areas  undertaken  by  HnPG  in  2003  concluded  that, \ndespite the relatively high level of flood damage experienced in the rural lower reaches of the \nmountain  river  floodplains  and  the  area  around  Dongting  Lake,  greater  impact  could  be \nachieved by implementing both structural and nonstructural measures in municipal and county \ncities located along the middle to upper reaches of the four mountain rivers. \n \n9. \nHnPG is investing $626 million of local funds during 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005) to \nimprove flood protection in cities across the Province. Of this, $476 million (76%) is allocated for \ncities  in  the  Dongting  Lake  area  and  $150  million  (24%)  for  cities  in  the  mountainous  areas, \nincluding $110 million for municipal cities and $40 million for county-level cities. HnPG's flood-\ncontrol efforts under the Hunan Provincial 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010) will focus more on \nflood  control,  management,  and  forecasting  in  the  four  mountainous  river  basins\u2014the  Lishui, \nXiangjiang,  Yuanjiang,  and  Zishui\u2014and  their  flood-prone  municipal  and  county-level  cities. \nNonstructural measures to mitigate the onset of floods in the middle and upper reaches of the \nmountainous rivers and reduce the future need for flood protection works are to be developed. \n\n\fThe  hydrological  rationale  for  the  priority  shift  is  that  floods  in  the  upper  and  middle \n10. \nreaches of mountain rivers are shorter, sharper, and more sudden than in the lower floodplain \nareas, which tend to experience more prolonged floods. Land adjacent to the middle and upper \nreaches of mountainous rivers are typically inundated for no more than two or three days, but in \nthat  time  water  levels  rise  and  fall  dramatically.  The  economic  rationale  for  shifting  focus  to \ncities in the middle and upper reaches of mountain rivers is that floods tend to have a greater \nrelative  impact  on  centers  of  economic  growth,  including  municipal  and  county  cities  located \nalong  these  rivers.  Floods  depress  urban  property  values;  disrupt  key  industrial,  commercial, \nand government centers; and carry high recovery costs. This hinders industrialization of these \ncities and the functioning of market centers for rural output and surplus labor. \n \n11. \nHunan\u2019s Flood Control Plan emphasizes the use of structural flood protection works and \nrisky reservoir reinforcement to reduce flood hazards, which are essential to improving security \nfor those living and working within flood-prone areas. Nonstructural approaches, including data \nacquisition,  flood  forecasting,  flood  warning  and  response  procedures,  and  water  and  soil \nconservancy are also increasingly used to reduce exposure and vulnerability to floods and need \nurgent completion or upgrading in Hunan. Consideration is also being given to moving people \naway  from  flood-prone  areas  instead  of  investing  in  expensive  measures  to  protect  them. \nHowever, the large population and lack of available land suitable for new development requires \nbalancing  structural  and  nonstructural  measures.  There  is  a  need  to  explore  more  options  for \nreducing flood risks and strengthening and unifying flood management throughout the Province \nin accordance with the  Yangtze River Flood Control Plan, a basin-wide plan which covers the \nYangtze River and its tributaries including Hunan\u2019s mountain rivers.  \n \nThe  development  of  flood  protection  measures  for  flood-affected  cities  is  a  local \n12. \ngovernment responsibility. Consequently, national and provincial sources contribute only limited \nfunding  toward  implementing  approved  measures.  However,  flood  protection  has  become \nurgent  in  rapidly  growing  cities.  Plans  have  been  prepared  for  a  range  of  structural  and \nnonstructural  works  within  city  jurisdictions,  but  these  plans  need  to  be  assessed  within  the \noverall  framework  of  river  basin  development  and  in  line  with  national  policy  on  IFM.  The \nProvincial  Water  Resource  Department  (PWRD)  is  responsible  for  evaluating  proposed  city \nflood  management  and  confirms  that  they  are  compatible with  the  national  flood management \nplan.  Nevertheless,  nonstructural  flood-mitigation  measures  need  further  improvement  at  the \nlocal level. \n \n13.  With much experience in flood management around Dongting Lake and other areas, the \nHunan PWRD and related agencies such as Hunan Hydro and Power Design Institute have the \ntechnical capacity to design and construct flood-control works. Hunan Province has experience \nin  dealing  with  resettlement  and  environment  management  issues  related  to  flood  projects, \nincluding  use  of  donor  safeguard  systems  as  required.  In  response  to  domestic  and  donor \nconcerns on the application of social and environment safeguards, the PRC has strengthened \nrelated laws and regulations.2  \n \n14. \nExternal  Assistance.  Numerous  international  agencies  have  supported  flood-control \nand  flood  management  projects  in  the  Yangtze  River  basin  and  the  Dongting  Lake  area  (see \nAppendix  5  for  a  list  of  recent  externally  supported  projects).  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation (JBIC) is funding flood-control improvements at 23 urban centers around Dongting \n\n                                                 \n2  PRC  safeguard  laws  include  Law  on  Prevention  and  Control  of  Water  Pollution  (1996),  Environmental  Impact \nAssessment Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China (2002), Land Administration Law (1998), and State Council No. \n28 Decree on Deepening Reform on Land Acquisition System and Reinforcement (2004). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nLake.  The  World  Bank  (WB)  is  funding  a  project  to  strengthen  142  kilometers  (km)  of  dikes \nalong the Yangtze River in Hunan Province, resettle 11,000 families, and conduct research into \nflood control and waterlogging to improve early flood warning systems and post-flood drainage. \nThe WB has also funded the recently completed Jiangya Multi-purpose Project on the Loushui \nRiver, a tributary of the Lishui River. The Government of the Netherlands is funding a dredging \nproject in Dongting Lake to improve water flow into and out of the lake. The Australian Agency \nfor  International  Development  is  funding  the  Yangtze  River  Flood  Control  and  Management \nProject,  which  is  designed  to  improve  flood  forecasting,  flood  warning  systems,  and  the \noperation of flood detention basins along the middle reaches of the Yangtze (including around \nDongting Lake). External assistance for such projects along the mountainous rivers is, however, \nlimited.  Projects  involving  major  construction  works  that  affect  people's  livelihoods  have \ngenerally followed the safeguard requirements of the different donors. While national safeguard \nsystems are being strengthened, there is scope for replicating compatible donor systems and a \nneed to monitor implementation.  \n \n15. \nLessons Learned. ADB is providing support to two other flood management projects in \nthe PRC.3 The key lessons learned from these projects concern start-up delays and safeguard \ncompliance.  Start-up  delays  arose  because  of  longer-than-expected  approval  of  subproject \nfeasibility  study  reports  (FSRs),  preliminary  design  reports,  and \nfor \nresettlement. To reduce the time required for such approvals, the PRC's National Development \nReform  Committee  has  authorized  provincial-level  agencies  to  approve  subproject  FSRs, \npreliminary  design  reports,  and  land  acquisition  up  to  specified  design  and  land  area  ceilings. \nDelays in fulfilling required procurement procedures can be avoided by reducing the number of \nprocurement  packages,  engaging  experienced  tendering  companies,  and  allowing  post-facto \nprocurement  reviews  where  Executing  Agency  (EA)  capacity  is  assessed  as  sufficient. \nDisbursement delays can be limited by using annual planning and reimbursement systems that \nalign  with  the  domestic  budget  cycle,  and  by  permitting  larger  imprest  accounts  to \naccommodate  civil  works  packages.  Independent,  regular,  and  systematic  monitoring  will  help \nensure safeguard compliance. \n \n16. \nRationale. Improved  management  and control of flood events in the middle and upper \nreaches  of  Hunan's  four  main  mountainous  river  basins  is  essential  to  reducing  public  and \ninvestor concerns over floods and helping sustain economic development in Hunan. The Hunan \neconomy  is  rapidly  becoming  more  urbanized  and  industrialized.  Many  of  the  regional  and \ndistrict  (county)  cities  and  adjacent  peri-urban  areas  are  expanding  rapidly  as  people  migrate \nfrom  rural  areas  to  the  cities  looking  for  work  and  a  chance  to  lift  themselves  out  of  poverty. \nHowever,  most  of  these  urban  areas  are  adjacent  to  the  four  main  rivers  or  their  tributaries. \nMeasures have been taken to protect \u201cat-risk\u201d communities, but the risk of floods remains high. \nAs development continues in river catchments, the incidence of flooding is increasing along with \nthe  economic  damage  caused  by  these  floods.  A  public  investment  priority  of  HnPG  and \nmunicipal and county-level cities is to reduce the risk of floods by providing improved structural \nflood-control measures and nonstructural flood forecast, warning, and response systems. \n \n17. \nADB's  Role.  The  national  Government\u2019s  long-term  development  goal  is  to  maintain \nsteady  economic  growth  and  improve  people\u2019s  living  standards.

Manila. \n\n\fstrategy, ADB\u2019s operations focus on four strategic pillars.4 This Project will promote sustainable \neconomic  growth  by  reducing  investor  concerns  over  flooding.  This  is  expected  to  promote \nindustrial  development  and  employment  in  urban  areas,  and  indirectly,  develop  rural  areas  by \nprotecting  urban  market  centers  upon  which  rural  markets  depend.  IFM  promotes  sustainable \nnatural  resource  management.  Through  the  Project,  ADB  will  assist  the  Government  in \nimplementing policies and strategies in IFM in  Hunan Province, and support HnPG in building \nlocal  government  capacity  to  implement  its  flood  management  projects  and  ensure  proper \nsafeguarding. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nSector Investment Approach \n\nThe  Project  supports  the  PRC\u2019s  and  HnPG's  plans  for  flood  protection  investments  as \n\n18. \nfollows: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nNational  Government  Flood  Management  Policy.  Since  2000,  the  Ministry  of \nWater Resources has promoted change from a flood-control approach to an IFM \napproach. The 1997 Flood Control Law and revised Water Law (2002) call for a \nbalanced  and  integrated  approach  to  managing  natural  resources  in  river \nbasins\u2014including  flood  control.  At  the  provincial  level,  Hunan  implements  core \nnational laws and policies as provincial measures. \n\nProvincial Flood Management Policy. In line with national policy directives and \nstrategy, the Hunan Province Comprehensive River Basin Plan addresses flood \nmanagement  through  the  Flood  Control  Plan.  The  two  main  components  of  the \nFlood Control Plan, are the River Basin Flood Control Plan and the Flood-Control \nPlan  for  the  Dongting  Lake  Area.  Sub-components  of  the  River  Basin  Flood \nControl Plan include the Municipal and County-level City Flood Control Plan, the \nNonstructural Measures Flood Control Plan, the Risky Reservoirs Reinforcement \nPlan, and the Water and Soil Conservancy Plan.  \n\n \n19. \nSpecifically, the Project will support implementation of an area and time slice of Hunan's \nflood-control  program  under  the  11th  Hunan  Provincial  Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010),  which \nfocuses  on  four  mountainous  river  basins\u2014the  Lishui,  Xiangjiang,  Yuanjiang,  and  Zishui.  The \nprogram prioritizes flood protection measures for 35 of the 94 flood-prone municipal and county-\nlevel cities, weighted by extent of the flood-prone area, frequency of flood occurrence, number \nof affected peoples, and value of the recurring damages and losses. HnPG has prepared initial \ndesigns  and  preliminary  cost  estimates  for  proposed  subprojects  in  the  35  priority  cities, \npresented  in  subproject  FSRs  prepared  by  the    Hunan  Hydro  and  Power  Design  Institute  and \naffiliate organizations at the municipal level. Appendix 4 provides summary details of candidate \nsubprojects. Based on HnPG's initial review of overall river basin flood management, a range of \nnonstructural measures will be developed to improve flood warning systems. The program also \naddresses  ways  to  mitigate  the  onset  of  floods  in  the  middle  and  upper  reaches  of  the \nmountainous rivers (these measures will be implemented through agencies other than PWRD).  \n \n\n                                                 \n4   The  four  pillars  of  the  CSPU  (2006\u20132008)  are  (i)  promoting  equitable  and  inclusive  growth,  (ii)  making  markets \n\nwork better, (iii) improving the environment, and (iv) promoting regional cooperation. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n20. \nThe  proposed  Project  will  be  implemented  using  a  sector  approach,  financing  priority \nsub-projects of the Municipal and County-Level City Flood Control Plan as part of HnPG\u2019s River \nBasin and Flood Control Plan (see Figure A2 in Appendix 2). Representative subprojects were \nselected  to  assess  the  feasibility  of  project  components.  Eight  of  35  draft  subproject  FSRs \nprepared  by  Hunan  Hydro  and  Power  Design  Institute  were  selected  and  reviewed  during \nproject preparation. These covered technical, financial, economic, and social safeguards as well \nas  environmental  aspects.  The  selection  of  the  representative  subprojects  (termed  \"core \nsubprojects\")  was  based  on  size  of  investment,  represent  geographic  conditions  in  the  four \nmountain watersheds, severity of environmental and resettlement impacts, severity and types of \nflooding, types of proposed flood protection measures, potential impact on indigenous peoples, \nand potential impact on poverty. Supplementary Appendix C provides details on the eight core \nsubprojects. The remaining 27 draft subproject FSRs were prepared at the request of municipal \nand  county  governments  by  the  Hunan  Hydro  and  Power  Design  Institute  and  will  be  further \ndeveloped based on the models provided in the eight core subprojects. \n \n21. \nThe Project's main impact will be to enhance sustainable and inclusive economic growth \nin  flood-prone  areas  of  Hunan  Province.  Priority  municipal  and  county  cities  in  the  mountain \nriver  basins  will  be  targeted  to  reduce  investor  concerns  over  floods,  and  promote  increased \ninvestment in the industrial and commercial enterprises that drive urban and rural growth in the \narea.  The  Project's  main  outcome  will  be  to  permanently  reduce  flood  risks  in  priority \nmunicipality  and  county-level  cities  along  the  middle  and  upper  reaches  of  Hunan  Province's \nfour main river basins. The Project will lead to the construction of various structural works and \nwill build the capacity of the provincial and local governments to manage a range of structural \nand  nonstructural  flood  protection  measures  and  warning  systems.  The  lowered  risk  of  floods \nwill reduce private property losses in the project area, reduce loss of life, and increase overall \ninvestment and employment. In turn, lower risk and losses will drive industrial and commercial \ngrowth and reduce government expenditures on flood repairs and compensation.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs  \n\nTo  achieve  the  expected  impact  and  outcome,  the  Project  comprises  three  main \n22. \ncomponents.  First,  nonstructural  measures  will  be  implemented  to  strengthen  river  basin  and \nprovincial  flood  management,  flood  warning,  and  flood  response  systems.  Second,  structural \nworks will be constructed to raise flood protection standards in priority locations, as identified in \nHnPG's  River  Basin  Flood  Control  Plan.  Construction  or  upgrading  of  structural  works  will \nrequire temporary and full resettlement of people in some project locations and management of \ntemporary  environmental  impacts  during  construction.  Third,  provincial  and  local  government \nproject  management  systems  will  be  strengthened.  An  additional  output  will  be  implemented \nwith  the  grant  financed  TA.  Under  this  output,  selected  non-structural  flood  management \nmeasures  will  be  further  assessed  for  relevance  and  feasibility  in  Hunan  Province,  to  support \nnational policy in IFM. \n \n\n1. \n\nNonstructural Flood Management Systems \n\n23. \nUp to 35 municipal and county-level cities participating in the structural component of the \nProject  will  have  their  capacity  strengthened  in  the  following  nonstructural  areas:  flood \nforecasting,  flood  warning  systems,  and  flood  emergency  response  and  recovery.  The \nnonstructural component will (i) establish or upgrade hydrological stations in related  subproject \nlocations  and  link  these  stations  to  the  provincial  data-acquisition  system;  (ii)  improve  data \n\n\fflood \n\nforecasting,  and \n\nflood  event  decision  support  systems \n\nflood \nmanagement, \nmanagement in up to 35 subproject locations; and (iii) train staff in municipal and county-level \ncities  to  operate  flood  warning  systems  and  plan  for  and  manage  flood  emergencies.  Flood \nforecasting and warning will be based on a river basin-wide integrated flood forecasting system \nplanned by the Hunan Hydrology Bureau. Data acquisition systems and telemetry systems will \nbe implemented by project area municipal and county governments, guided and supervised by \nthe Hunan Hydrology Bureau, which will integrate systems into the existing provincial and state \ninformation system. Flood management measures will be integral to the overall river basin flood \nwarning  and  decision  making  process  operated  by  the  Provincial  Flood  Control  and  Drought \nRelief Headquarters. \n \n\nfor \n\n2. \n\nStructural Flood Protection, Resettlement, and Environment Management \n\n24. \nThe Project will provide structural flood protection works to increase protection standards \nfor up to 35 flood-prone municipal and county-level cities in the mountainous regions of Hunan's \nfour main river basins. The structural works will improve current flood protection standards to a \n1 in 20-year-return flood period in county-level cities, in municipal cities to a 1 in 50-year flood \nreturn  period  in  municipal  level  cities,  and  up  to  1  in  100-year  flood  return  period  in  three  key \nmunicipal  cities.  The  scale  of  floods,  flood  discharge  levels,  river  water  levels,  and  needed \nprotection  improvements  in  each  city  was  determined  by  hydrologic  and  hydraulic  analysis  of \navailable  data  on  rivers  and  catchments.  The  Project  will  upgrade  FSRs  for  each  selected \nnoncore  subprojects  in  line  with  model  FSRs  prepared  for  the  eight  core  subprojects  during \nproject  preparation,  prepare  detailed  engineering  designs  for  all  subprojects  and,  in  line  with \nPRC flood protection standards, rehabilitate and construct earth dikes and flood walls, upgrade \nand construct sluice gates, upgrade and construct pumping stations, and upgrade and construct \ndiversion  channels.  Additional  details  of  planned  flood  protection  works  for  the  8  core \nsubprojects and design standards for the noncore subprojects are provided in Appendix 4. \n \nSome  areas  around  the  planned  structural  works,  including  river  banks,  are  currently \n25. \noccupied by residents and businesses requiring land acquisition and resettlement. The Project \nwill  acquire  land  where  needed  to  accommodate  flood  protection  civil  works,  prepare  and \nimplement  resettlement plans  (RPs)  to  relocate,  temporarily  or  permanently,  affected  persons. \nThe  Project  will  also  prepare  and  implement  environmental  assessments  and  management \nplans  for  each  subproject.  Attempts  have  been  made  to  minimize  resettlement  requirements, \nbut  if  broad  flood  protection  is  to  be  attained,  some  disruptions  to  residents,  businesses,  and \nfarmers are unavoidable. Accommodating construction works and relocating people from high-\nrisk areas along rivers will require the acquisition of a total of 863 hectares of land in 35 cities. \nUp  to  20,133  people  will  be  relocated  and  95  enterprises  and  132  shops  will  be  affected. \nExisting infrastructure facilities, such as power transmission lines, irrigation canals, and roads, \nwill either be temporarily disrupted or partially realigned around the new flood protection works. \nLand  acquisition,  and  resettlement  and  environmental  management  costs  are  included  in  the \nProject  costs.  Appendix  14  summarizes  the  resettlement  framework,  and  Supplementary \nAppendix  C  (Part  2)  provides  detailed  RPs  for  the  eight  core  subprojects.  An  environmental \nassessment  and  management  framework  is  presented  in  Appendix  16.  Initial  environmental \nexaminations of the eight investment locations are provided in Supplementary Appendix C (Part \n3). Implementation of safeguard measures will include capacity building of EA and Implementing \nAgency (IA) staff. \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n3. \n\nProject Management and Capacity Building \n\n26. \nConstruction  of  major  flood-control  works  and  management  of  flood  response  require \nqualified  and  experienced  personnel.  The  Provincial  Project  Management  Office  (PPMO)  has \nprior  experience  in  implementing  WB  and  JBIC  flood  management  projects,  but  newly \nestablished  local  project  management  offices  (LPMOs)  need  capacity  building  support  for  the \nimplementation  of  their  subprojects.  The  Hunan  PPMO  and  its  respective  line  agencies\u2014the \nProvincial  Development  and  Reform  Committee  (PDRC),  PWRD,  and  the  Provincial  Finance \nDepartment  (PFD)\u2014will  ensure  that  municipal  and  county  LPMOs  and  their  associated  line \nagencies follow consistent policies, strategies, and regulations, and that relevant staff have the \nnecessary  project  management  skills.  An  annual  plan  and  management  framework  consistent \nwith  HnPG\u2019s  domestic  planning  and  budgeting  systems  will  be  implemented  to  strengthen \nprovincial\u2013local government coordination, project monitoring, and implementation.5 The PPMO, \nwith support from domestic consultants, will detail a training and human resource development \nplan  for  key  line  agencies  at  project  start-up.  Training  will  be  delivered  centrally  or  locally  by \ndomestic  trainers.  The  PPMO  will  supervise  and  monitor  the  training  activities.  Key  provincial \nand  local  government  managers  will  receive  additional  domestic  or  international  short-course \ntraining to enhance overall project managerial capacity. \n \n\n4. \n\nSupport for Flood Management and Planning \n\n27. \nIn addition, an advisory TA support will provide capacity building in annual planning and \nmanagement  systems  in  support  of  project  management,  and  will  assist  in  assessing \nnonstructural aspects of flood management. HnPG's flood management program under the 11th \nHunan  Provincial  Five-Year  Plan  consists  of  flood  control  and  drainage  in  the  Dongting  Lake \narea, city flood control, flood-control reservoirs, river channel regulation, rehabilitation of unsafe \nreservoirs,  flood  control  and  nonstructural  warning  systems  for  farmland  along  the  low  river \nbanks, flash-flood disaster prevention and warning, and soil and water conservation. Appendix \n2, Table A2.1 summarizes the current status and planned future provincial actions in line with \nthe  national  flood  management  strategy.  Two  areas  supporting  nonstructural  aspects  of  flood \nmanagement  in  Hunan  Province  were  identified  as  priorities  to  be  supported  by  the  TA:  (i)  a \nneeds  assessment  for  further  developing  flood  warning  systems,  and  (ii)  the  feasibility  of \nintroducing flood insurance. The TA will be provided to PWRD and results used for the current \n11th Hunan Provincial Five Year Plan and in preparing the Hunan Provincial 12th Five Year Plan. \n    \nD. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n28. \nThe Project will be the first ADB loan project in the water sector for Hunan Province. The \nProject is embedded in Hunan Province's River Basin and Flood Control Plan. This is the first \nADB-supported  flood  management  project  in  which  the  national  Government  has  given \nsubproject  approval  authority  to  the  provincial  government.  This  is  expected  to  accelerate \nproject  start-up  approvals,  improve  provincial  ownership  of  the  Project,  and  provide  an \nopportunity  for  ADB's  support  to  be  more  closely  aligned  with  PRC\u2019s  planning  and  budget \nsystems.  An  annual  plan  based  management  and  monitoring  system  based  on  domestic \nsystems will be further  developed to strengthen EA and IA planning and management, and  to \nfacilitate ADB's regular review of subproject planning and implementation. Advisory TA support \n\n                                                 \n5   The  Project's  proposed  management  and  monitoring  system  was  developed  as  part  of  the  TA  delivered  through \nADB.  2004.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Hunan  Flood  Control  Project.  Manila \n(TA 4324-PRC), and through the Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector Pilot Demonstration Activity: Hunan Flood \nManagement Project Management and Monitoring System. \n\n\ffor  field-based  review  and  for  preparation  of  RPs  and  initial  environmental  examination  is \nexpected  to  increase  capacity  to  address  safeguards.  The  Project  will  assess  further \ndevelopment needs in nonstructural areas. \n \nE. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n29. \n The  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $497.4  million  equivalent,  including  taxes \nand  duties  of  $13.6  million  equivalent.  Financial  charges  during  implementation  (comprising \ninterest  during  implementation)  are  estimated  at  $36.2  million.  Cost  estimates  by  project \ncomponent are summarized in Table 1 below, and the summary financing plan is presented in \nTable 2. Detailed cost estimates and assumptions are provided in Appendix 6. \n\n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n \n\nItem \n A. Base Cost \n  1.

The  loan  will  have  a  26-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  6  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  loan  agreement.  The  Government  has  provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on \nthe basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The \nfinancing  plan  is  shown  in  Table  2.  Counterpart  funds  from  the  municipal  and  county \ngovernments will be sourced from various sources, including the flood-control security fund, the \nlocal  quota  for  city  flood-control  works,  the  urban  maintenance  and  construction  charge,  land \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nsale  and  development,  and  national  and  budget  transfers.  The  affordability  analysis  of  local \ngovernments of the eight core subprojects is provided in Appendix 17. An attached advisory TA \nwill be provided to support the strengthening of flood management sustainability, for which the \nGovernment of Spain has agreed to make untied grant funds of $500,000 available. \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nA.

The  interest  rate  will  be  at  the  same  LIBOR-based  rate  paid  by  the \nGovernment of the PRC, and will be subject to the same terms and conditions as the PRC loan. \nHnPG  will  on-lend  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  to  the  local  authorities  to  finance  the  foreign \nexchange cost of the subprojects. On-lending will be under the same terms and conditions as \nthe on-lending terms to HnPG, including a 26-year loan term with a 6-year grace period and a \n20-year loan repayment period. The interest rate payable on the loan will be subject to the same \nLIBOR-based  terms  and  conditions  as  the  loan  to  HnPG.  The  local  authorities  will  bear  the \nforeign exchange risk. The financial management assessment concluded that local government \nborrowers  can  afford  the  Project  with  either  existing  or  incremental  budget  allocations  (see \nAppendix 17 and Supplementary Appendix I). \n \nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nHnPG will be the EA for the Project (see Appendix 9 for the project organizational chart). \n32. \nThe participating municipal and county-level cities are the IAs for the Project. A project leading \ngroup  has  been  established  by  HnPG  to  oversee  project  preparation  and  implementation, \nheaded by the vice governor of Hunan Province. The PPMO will have day-to-day responsibility \nfor project implementation. The PPMO will operate out of the PWRD office in Changsha and will \nhave primary responsibility for coordinating and directing subproject implementation. The PPMO \nincludes representatives from the three main agencies responsible for the Project\u2014the PDRC, \nPFD,  and  PWRD.  The  PPMO  is  also  responsible  for  directing  project  preparatory  activities, \nassisting LPMOs to plan and manage their subproject works, setting up and managing finances, \nmonitoring the resettlement planning and environment management activities, and establishing \nproject monitoring systems. Each participating municipality or county has set up a local project \nleading group and an LPMO to coordinate aspects of project preparation and implementation in \ntheir jurisdictions. \n \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Preparation and Selection \n\nSubproject Preparation. In addition to the eight subproject FSRs reviewed and revised \n33. \nduring  the  PPTA,  the  Hunan  Hydro  and  Power  Design  Institute  at  the  request  of  participating \nmunicipalities and counties and with guidance from the PPMO, will finalize FSRs for each of the \n\n\fremaining  27  subproject  candidate  locations.  Each  FSR  will  include  a  situation  assessment, \nrationale,  scope,  technical  analysis  and  description,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan, \nimplementation arrangements, financial and economic analysis, and social and poverty impact \nassessment. The LPMO will review the report, hold public consultations where resettlement or \nshort-term negative environmental impacts are expected to occur during the construction period, \nand request changes before providing the PPMO with authorization for further processing in line \nwith domestic requirements and procedures agreed upon with ADB.  \n \nSelection  Criteria.  The  Hunan  PDRC,  in  consultation  with  the  PPMO,  will  appraise \n34. \nsubprojects  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  detailed  in  Appendix  3.  For  the  subproject  to  be \napproved it must fulfill the following: (i) the subproject is a priority investment in the Hunan River \nBasin Flood Control Plan; (ii) the design minimizes costs; (iii) the design minimizes detrimental \nenvironmental and social impacts and ensures that people who are adversely affected by civil \nworks  construction  are  compensated  and  rehabilitated  according  to  PRC  laws  and  ADB \nresettlement  policies;  (iv)  the  local  government  can  afford  it;  (v)  the  local  government \ndemonstrates  firm  commitment  to  the  investment  through  provision  of  budgetary  resources  to \nmeet  counterpart  funding  requirements  during  the  construction  phase\u2014including  resettlement \ncosts  and  loan  repayments\u2014and  provision  of  budgetary  resources  to  meet  operations  and \nmaintenance costs during subsequent phases; (vi) beneficiaries demonstrate commitment to the \ninvestment through their willingness to pay and contribute to the cost of development during the \nconstruction  period;  and  (vii)  the  internal  economic  rate  of  return  exceeds  12%.  Data  and \ninformation  to  apply  the  selection  criteria  are  provided  in  each  subproject's  social  and  poverty \nimpact  assessment,  initial  environmental  examination,  economic  analysis,  and  financial \nanalysis. \n \n35. \nSubproject and Safeguard Plan Approvals. The eight core subproject FSRs prepared \nunder the PPTA will be the standard to which the remaining noncore subprojects FSRs will be \nfinalized by Hunan Hydro and Power Design Institute, and endorsed by the LPMOs. Both core \nand  noncore  subproject  FSRs  will  be  submitted  to  the  PDRC  for  approval,  in  compliance  with \ndomestic  PRC  requirements,  prior  to  loan  effectiveness.  HnPG  will  submit  all  noncore \nsubproject FSRs to ADB for review and approval on a no-objection basis. Noncore subproject \nFSRs  will  be  submitted  in  line  with  proposed  annual  work  plans  and  in  advance  of  contract \nbidding.  ADB's  subproject  planning  and  design  review  will  occur  during  the  mid-year  project \nreviews. The subproject preparation, review, and approval process is provided in Appendix 11. \nADB's  final  approval  of  financing  of  each  subproject  is  subject  to  post-facto  review  and \nconfirmation  that  implementation  is  in  accordance  with  the  Hunan  River  Basin  Flood  Control \nPlan, subproject selection criteria, and ADB policies. The approved resettlement framework, the \nethnic  minority  development  framework,  and  the  consolidated  environment  management \nframework provide the basis for preparing noncore subproject RPs, ethnic minority development \nplans  (EMDPs),  and  initial  environmental  examinations.  Prior  to  commencement  of  land \nacquisition,  HnPG  will  submit  to  ADB  for  approval  all  RPs  and  EMDPs  following  processes \ndescribed  in  Appendixes  14  and  15.  HnPG  will  submit  subproject  initial  environmental \nexaminations  to  ADB  for  review  and  no-objection  approval  following  the  process  described  in \nAppendix 16. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n36. \nThe  proposed  works  for  the  35  candidate  subproject  locations  are  scheduled  for \ncompletion over five dry seasons (the dry season usually runs from approximately September to \nApril). Works will take between 2 and 5 years to complete. Project implementation is expected \nto  take  6  fiscal  years  once  the  loan  becomes  effective  in  the  third  quarter  of  2006.  The \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nimplementation schedule for the 35 subprojects is shown in Appendix 8. HnPG is targeting the \n2006\u20132007  dry  season  for  works  start-up  on  the  eight  core  subprojects,  including  subproject \npredesign  and  preparatory  works,  site  preparation,  and  materials  stockpiling.  It  has  requested \nretroactive financing and advanced action procurement to commence these works. Retroactive \nfinancing  will  be  allowed  for  reasonable  expenditures  incurred  under  the  Project  before  the \nEffective  Date  but  not  earlier  than  21  August  2005.  The  project  implementation  period  will  be \nfrom about September 2006 to about September 2012. For locations requiring 5 years, start-up \nmust be no later than September 2006; for locations requiring 4 years, start-up must be no later \nthan  September  2007;  and  for  locations  requiring  3  years,  start-up  must  be  no  later  than \nSeptember  2008.  Nonstructural  development  activities  are  expected  to  be  implemented  in  the \nProject's first 3 years. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n37. \nEquipment, materials, goods, and services for ADB-financed contracts will be procured \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Major  contracts  for  equipment  and \nmaterials  valued  at  $1  million  equivalent  or  more  will  be  awarded  through  ADB\u2019s  international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Smaller packages for equipment and materials valued at \nless  than  $1  million  equivalent  will  be  procured  following  international  shopping  procedures  or \nnational  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures.  Shopping  mode  will  be  allowed  for  contracts \nvalued  at  $100,000  equivalent  or  less.  Civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  $10  million  or \nmore  will  be  carried  out  using  ICB  procedures,  while  those  costing  less  than  $10  million \nequivalent will be carried out using NCB procedures acceptable to ADB. The Procurement Plan \nis  attached  in  Appendix  7.6  HnPG  is  targeting  start-up  of  priority  civil  works  for  the  eight  core \nsubprojects before the onset of the 2006 flood season (which should start around April) and is \nfinalizing  FSR  approvals  and  preparing  detailed  designs  accordingly.  Retroactive  financing \nwithdrawals  from  the  Loan  Account  may  be  made  for  reimbursement  of  reasonable \nexpenditures incurred under the Project before the Effective Date, but not earlier than 21 August \n2005,  or  a  maximum  of  12  months  prior  to  the  date  of  the  signing  of  the  Loan  Agreement, \nwhichever is later, in connection with civil works contracts for the 8 core subprojects, subject to \na maximum of $10,000,000. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n38. \nThe  Project  will  support  provincial  and  local  government  capacity  building  in  flood \nmanagement  for  which  training  services  will  be  contracted  through  specialist  international  and \ndomestic  institutions  in  accordance  with  the  Consultants\u2019  Qualification  Selection  method \ndescribed in ADB\u2019s Guidelines on The Use of Consultants. The PPMO has experience with past \nand  ongoing  WB-  and  JBIC-financed  flood-control  projects  and  the  minimum  required \nmanagement  and  technical  capacity  exists  to  implement  the  proposed  works.  To  ensure  that \nrequirements  for  each  project  location  are  met,  the  PPMO  will  use  counterpart  funds  to  hire \ndomestic specialists or companies. Domestic third-party agencies will be recruited by the PPMO \nto assist with compliance monitoring and supervision of environmental, resettlement, and ethnic \nminority  issues.  The  EA  estimates  that  69  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  will  be \nrequired.  Specific  domestic  consultants  to  be  hired  and  financed  by  the  EA  include  (i)  project \nimplementation specialists, (ii) procurement and finance specialists, (iii) economics analysts, (iv) \nenvironment specialists, and (v) resettlement specialists.  \n \n\n                                                 \n6 The procurement plan  will be updated in order to comply  with the requirements set forth under the Guidelines for \n\nProcurement. \n\n\f6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nits  commitment \n\nto  and  discussed  with \n\nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained \n\nthe \n39. \nGovernment.  Consistent  with \nto  good  governance,  accountability  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  for  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n40. \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  make  use  of  reimbursement  and  imprest  fund  procedures \n(including  civil  works)  for  disbursement  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (January  2001).  The  PFD  will  establish  an  imprest  account  for  the  Project  in  a \ncommercial  bank  to  ensure  that  adequate  loan  proceeds  are  available  on  a  timely  basis.  The \ninitial  amount  to  be  deposited  into  the  imprest  account  shall  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  $20 \nmillion  (10%  of  the  total  loan  amount),  or  the  estimated  expenditures  for  the  next  6  months, \nwhichever  is  lower.  PFD  will  be  responsible  for  management,  monitoring,  maintenance,  and \nreconciliation  of  the  imprest  account.  Statement  of  Expenditures  procedures  will  be  used  to \nreimburse expenditures and liquidate the imprest account for individual payments not exceeding \n$100,000 equivalent. For each subproject, a project implementation unit will prepare and submit \nthe  withdrawal  application  and  required  documentation  to  PFD  through  the  local  financial \nbureau,  LPMO,  and  PPMO.  PFD  will  consolidate  withdrawal  applications  and  submit  them  to \nADB for disbursement processing. \n \n41.  Measures  will  be  taken  to  accelerate  internal  review  and  verification  for  withdrawal \napplications,  including:  (i)  PFD  will  have  at  least  two  authorized  representatives  assigned  to \nwithdrawal applications; (ii) to shorten the internal verification process, PFD, the local financial \nbureau,  and  the  PPMO  will  establish  written  procedures  with  a  specified  timeframe  for  review \nand  verification  of  withdrawal  applications  submitted  by  subprojects;  (iii) subprojects  are \nencouraged to use the reimbursement system or imprest account for large eligible expenditures, \nsuch as civil works-related items and small-value contracts; (iv) PFD will increase the turnover \nof  imprest  accounts  in  line  with  the  needs  of  project  implementation;  and  (v)  PFD,  the  local \nfinancial  bureau,  the  PPMO,  and  project  implementation  units  will  avoid  withholding  project \nfunds at each level. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nPWRD  and  each  subproject  IA  will  identify  the  goods  and  services  for  structural  and \n42. \nnonstructural components to be financed by the ADB loan and other sources. Each subproject \nwill  prepare  its  own  project  accounts  and  submit  annual  project  accounts  to  the  PPMO  after \nverification  by  the  local  financial  bureau.  The  PWRD  will  verify  the  subproject  accounts, \nconsolidate  the  accounts  of  all  subprojects,  and  incorporate  the  expenses  incurred  for  the \noperation of the PPMO for the Project. PFD will verify the consolidated project accounts. Each \nproject account will include a balance sheet, statement of sources and uses of funds, statement \nof implementation of loan agreement, and statement of imprest account. Subprojects will follow \na  uniform  format,  sound  accounting  principles,  domestic  regulations,  and  ADB  requirements. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  indicated  that  the  existing  institutional  base  can  be \nstrengthened to fulfill the required functions and responsibilities. \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n43. \nEach  of  the  subproject  accounts  will  be  audited  by  the  municipal  or  county  local  audit \nbureaus.  The  Hunan  Provincial  Audit  Bureau  will  audit  the  consolidated  project  accounts  and \nissue  the  audit  report  for  the  Project.  The  audit  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with \ninternational  standards  on  auditing  and  the  Government  auditing  standards  of  the  PRC.  Audit \ncoverage  will  include  a  special  audit  of  project  accounts,  including  separate  opinions  on  (i) \nutilization  of  the  imprest  account;  (ii)  the  statement  of  expenditures,  including  whether  the \namount  claimed  is  duly  supported  and  verified;  (iii)  whether  the  EA  is  operating  the  imprest \naccount  in  accordance  with  ADB  procedures;  and  (iv)  compliance  with  financial  covenants \nspecified in the loan and project agreements. A letter describing internal management controls \nand procedures associated with the preparation of project accounts is required, and should be \nsubmitted  together  with  the  audited  project  accounts.  Audit  reports  of  consolidated  project \naccounts will be furnished to ADB within 6 months of the end of each calendar year. Separate \naudits  for  resettlement  funds  will  be  prepared  and  provided  to  ADB  annually.  The  PPMO  will \nprepare quarterly progress reports indicating progress made, problems encountered during the \nperiod under review, steps taken or proposed to remedy the problems, the proposed program of \nactivities,  and  the  progress  expected  for  the  following  half  year.  Within  6  months  of  physical \ncompletion  of  the  Project,  the  PPMO,  with  support  from  the  LPMOs,  will  submit  a  project \ncompletion  report  to  ADB  on  implementation  of  project  components,  project  management \nissues,  actual  costs  incurred  in  relation  to  cost  estimates,  benefits,  beneficiary  consultations, \nand other information requested by ADB. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nADB supervision missions are envisaged to occur at least twice yearly. A midyear review \n44. \nwill focus on planning the following year's subproject start-ups and activities; an end-year review \nwill focus on implementation performance during the past year. Implementation monitoring will \nextend  to  the  monitoring  and  mitigation  of  the  risks  identified  in  the  PDMF  (Appendix  1).  The \nmonitoring system will be based on the agreed PDMF and existing baseline information, or on \nthe  first  measurement  at  subproject  start-up  such  as  temporary  environmental  disturbances \nduring construction. The principles of the monitoring system are provided in Appendix 18. \n \nThe  initial  project  progress  report  will  be  prepared  from  the  PDMF  by  ADB  one  month \n45. \nafter  the  effective  date,  and  will  be  updated  periodically  during  project  review  missions  in \nconsultation with the EA or after receipt of project progress reports. A project completion report \nshall be prepared within three months of completion of the  Project. A separate TA  completion \nreport  will  be  prepared  for  the  Government  of  Spain-funded  advisory  TA,  which  will  be \nprocessed in conjunction with the loan. The assessment of the advisory TA performance will be \nreported and incorporated in the overall assessment of the Project. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n46. \nThe Project's management information and monitoring system will provide the basis for \nthe EA\u2019s, IAs\u2019 and ADB's monitoring and review. It is envisaged that ADB review missions will \noccur at least twice per year. The semiannual reviews will include a review of the consolidated \nwork plan for the year, key steps needed to ensure timely implementation, proposed loan and \ncounterpart funds needs, and compliance with safeguard measures. A midterm review will also \nbe  undertaken  by  ADB,  HnPG,  and  the  Government  3  years  after  project  implementation \nbegins.  The  review  will  include  a  detailed  evaluation  of  scope,  implementation  arrangements, \nenvironmental management, resettlement, achievement of scheduled targets, and progress with \ncapacity building measures. \n \n\n\fIV. \n\n TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n47. \n An advisory TA grant of $500,000 from the Government of Spain will be provided and \nwill be administered by ADB. The EA will provide $120,000 for in-kind costs. The plans for IFM \nand supporting investments require a coordinated, well managed approach to implementation. \nDeveloping  and  sustaining  strategic  interventions  in  IFM  will  require  updates  to  elements  of \nHunan's  existing  River  Basin  Flood  Control  Plan  including  strengthening  capacity  in  annual \nplanning and management systems for IFM systems. \n  \nThe advisory TA will support HnPG and local governments to further develop domestic \n48. \nannual  planning  and  management  systems  through  the  Hunan  Flood  Management  Sector \nProject.  The  component  will  support  preparation  of  effective  subprojects,  support  the \ndevelopment  of  systems  for  annual  activity  planning,  confirm  counterpart  financing  needs  and \napplications for construction works, ensure that such works employ proper safeguard measures, \nsupport the establishment of monitoring and reporting systems, and clarify the responsibilities of \nthe  various  agencies.  The  advisory  TA  will  also  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  EA  and  IAs  to \nmeet safeguard requirements in noncore subproject areas. \n \n49. \nThe advisory TA will support HnPG in adopting strategies for flood warning systems and \nflood insurance as part of the Province's IFM plans. This component will comprise a review and \nanalysis  of  the  Province's  existing  flood  warning  system  and  facilities  in  one  river  basin,  and \npropose  ways  to  optimize  the  design  of  these  facilities  for  hydrometeorological  data  collection \nand  flood  preparedness.  Institutional  capacity  and  financing  needs  will  be  identified  for  future \ndevelopment of flood warning systems. The advisory TA will involve close cooperation with the \nHunan  Water  Resources  Department.  The  advisory  TA  will  help  assess  the  feasibility  of \nproviding  flood  insurance  to  rural  and  urban  people,  and  will  support  the  Hunan  Water \nResources Department's future strategic planning efforts on IFM. \n \nAn international firm will be engaged through quality- and-cost-based selection method \n50. \nusing  simplified  technical  proposals  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers. Consultants with expertise in areas \nsuch as flood insurance and flood modeling may be engaged as individuals or through specialist \ninstitutions. Fifteen person-months of international consulting services and 34 person-months of \ndomestic consulting services will be required. The indicative consultant needs and outline terms \nof reference of the TA are provided in Appendix 12. Implementation of the TA will commence in \nthe first year of the Hunan Flood Management Sector Project (2006). \n   \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Impact and Poverty Reduction \n\n51.  Without  project  flood  protection,  the  mountain  river  basin  municipal  and  county-level \ncities is currently in the range of 1 in 2-year return period to 1 in 20-year return period. These \nlevels of flood protection are, in many cases, insufficient to handle average floods. Project flood \nprotection will raise the level of protection to a 20-year return period flood in the case of county-\nlevel cities, and a 50-year return period for municipal cities. The combined populations for the \ntarget municipal and county cities are over 6.4 million people. The direct impact of the Project \nwill  be  to  reduce  flood  risks  by:  reducing  flood  hazards  through  structural  works  in  project \nprotected  areas;  reducing  exposure  to  floods  through  property  acquisition  and  resettlement  in \nproject  protected  areas;  and  reducing  vulnerability  to  floods  in  project  areas  through \nnonstructural measures, including improved flood forecasting, emergency response, community \nawareness  and  preparedness  for  floods.  The  with-project  scenario  provides  improved \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nflood-fighting  and  evacuation  crews  during  major \n\nadvanced-flood-warning  systems  and  flood  protection  systems.  The  Project  is  assessed  to  be \nfinancially sustainable. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) for the eight core subprojects \nexceed  12%.  Further  details  of  the  Project's  fiscal,  economic,  distribution,  and  poverty  impact \nare provided in Appendix 17. \n \n52. \nIndirect  and  unquantifiable  impacts  not  included  in  quantified  economic  benefit \ncalculations  include  reduced  loss  of  life,  avoidance  of  injuries,  reduced  hospitalizations,  and \navoided  costs  of  mobilizing \nfloods. \nUnquantifiable benefits include environmental improvements in the project area and provision of \nrecreational  areas  along  river  embankments.  Other  avoided  losses  include  disruption  of \ncommunication  and  transportation  to  areas  adjacent  to  flood-prone  zones,  and  losses  of \nhousehold  assets,  livestock,  and  farm  machinery.  Such  losses  affect  vulnerable  and  poor \nhouseholds most severely. Avoiding such losses will reduce the fiscal burden of flood disasters, \nfreeing up public spending for development of infrastructure and other services. \n \n53. \nReducing  flood  risks  for  public  infrastructure,  residential  areas,  businesses,  and \nindustrial investments in project areas will reduce investor concerns about floods and pave the \nway  for  increased  investment.  Increased  investment  will  expand  markets  for  rural  and  urban \nproduction,  promote  urban  and  rural  employment  and  growth,  and  reduce  poverty  in  areas \neconomically linked to project areas (assuming Hunan's growth rates are maintained and low-\nincome groups have access to labor and product markets). \n \nB. \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nSocial Benefits and Poverty Reduction \n\n54. \nPoverty incidence among project beneficiaries is 10% for urban dwellers and 5% for the \nrural  population.  The  main  stakeholders  include  urban  residents,  peri-urban  rural  residents, \nindustry, and businesses. About 85% of the project protected area residents who live in poverty \nare  urban  dwellers.  Surveys  and  analyses  of  social  patterns  in  project  communities  have \nidentified  both  positive  benefits  and  short-run  adverse  impacts  resulting  from  flood  protection \nworks  that  require  land  acquisition.  The  focus  on  river-basin  growth  centers  means  that  three \nquarters of direct project beneficiaries are urban based. Flood damage is a direct contributor to \nthe impoverishment of both urban and rural dwellers. Project surveys show that up to one third \nof  urban  poverty  is  caused  by  frequent  floods.  Construction  of  flood-control  works  will  protect \nvulnerable  people  in  project  locations.  Nonstructural  investments  will  reduce  vulnerability \nthrough improved flood warning and emergency response systems. The Project has developed \nsocial  action  plans  that  provide  a  framework  for  mitigating  the  potentially  negative  impacts  of \nresettlement. \n \n\n2. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n55. \nStructural works will require the resettlement of some rural and urban residents. The 35 \nsubprojects  will  affect  up  to  101  townships  (towns  or  subdistricts)  and  352  villages  or  urban \nresidential  committees.  Up  to  863  hectares  (ha)  of  land  will  be  acquired,  including  461  ha  of \nfarmland. The acquisition of farmland will leave up to 13,969 persons in need of full economic \nrehabilitation. In addition, during the construction phase, about 613 ha of land will be occupied \ntemporarily. Along with land acquisition, about 1 million square meters (m2) of structures will be \ndemolished,  including  709,899  m2  of  residential  structures  and  292,933  m2  of  non-residential \nstructures.  The  flood  protection  works  will  cause  permanent  or  temporary  relocation  of  5,236 \n\n\fhouseholds and 20,133 persons (77% urban and 23% rural) and affect 95 enterprises and 132 \nshops.  \n \n56. \nThe majority of rural people who will lose land and property will be reabsorbed into their \nvillages through a land-reallocation process. Compensation measures will be in place to cover \nlosses.  Urban  residents  will  be  relocated  to  areas  close  to  their  current  locations  or,  if \nagreeable,  to  new  development  areas  within  the  city.  The  approach  for  each  subproject \ndepends  on  community  discussions,  available  options,  compensation  levels,  and  individuals' \nconsent to be resettled. The RPs have been prepared for the 8 core subprojects and are open \nfor discussion with affected people. In the subprojects where the affected persons include ethnic \nminorities,  resettlement  will  require  additional  measures.  The  resettlement  framework  is \npresented in Part 3 of Supplementary Appendix B, the ethnic minority development framework \n(EMDF) is presented in Part 4. The full RPs are presented in Part 2 of Supplementary Appendix \nC for the eight core subprojects. One EMDP is provided in Part 3 of Supplementary Appendix C. \nThe  LPMOs  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  and  implementing  the  RPs  and  EMDPs  for  their \nsubprojects. Internal monitoring will be carried out by the PPMO and LPMOs. The EA will carry \nout  internal  and  external  monitoring  during  RP  implementation  to  ensure  compensation \nmeasures meet PRC regulations and ADB policies. External monitoring and evaluation will be \nassigned to a qualified independent monitoring agency. The PPMO will report to ADB on land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  in  quarterly  progress  reports.  External  monitoring  reports  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB and the PPMO twice per year during resettlement implementation; evaluation \nwill be conducted and reported annually. Prior to the completion of the Project, the PPMO will \nprepare and submit to ADB a comprehensive resettlement completion report. \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental Impact  \n\n57. \nFlood protection works will involve physical changes to riverbanks to protect flood-prone \nareas,  and  to  material  source  sites  needed  to  construct  dikes  and  provide  river  bank  or  dike \nstabilization. The Project has been classified as Category B by ADB. To address environmental \nimpact  concerns,  an  initial  environmental  evaluation  (IEE)  has  been  prepared  for  each  of  the \neight  core  project  locations.  Cumulative  downriver  effects  of  flood  works  are  not  expected  but \nshould  be  cross-analyzed  and  monitored.  Consolidated  or  project-wide  environmental  reports \nhave  been  prepared,  including  a  consolidated  IEE,  a  consolidated  summary  IEE  and  a \nconsolidated  environment  management  plan  (CEMP).  These  reports  outline  the  mitigation, \nmonitoring, and institutional measures that need to be taken during project implementation, and \nthe  actions  needed  to  implement  semiannual  monitoring  and  reporting  to  ADB  of  these \nmeasures. The total estimated cost for implementation of environment management plans for all \nsubprojects is $13.5 million and is included in the Project costs. \n \nD. \n\nRisks  \n\n58. \nRisks  are  grouped  by  project  impact,  outcome,  and  output.  Impact  risks  involve \nincreased losses resulting from the population in flood protected areas ignoring continued flood \nrisks that can exceed design standards, which could be exacerbated by additional migration into \nprotected areas by people and businesses seeking protection behind improved flood protection \nworks.  Mitigation  measures  are:  (i)  to  progressively  introduce\u2014through  more  complete  flood \nexposure and vulnerability measures such as enhancing land-use zoning in flood-prone areas\u2014\ndevelopment  planning  and  higher-standard  building  codes,  and  (ii)  to  consider,  as  part  of  the \nbeneficiary-pays policy, increased taxes and insurance as an integral part of flood management \npolicy. \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nOutcome and output risks include: (i) heavy floods may occur that exceed infrastructure \n59. \ndesign standards; (ii) incohesive implementation of structural and nonstructural components of \nthe  flood  management  strategy  resulting  from  a  lack  of  coordination  between  provincial  and \nlocal government agencies; and (iii) insufficient counterpart budget for civil works, resettlement, \nand environment management at project start-up, which could delay implementation. Mitigation \nmeasures  to  address  such  risks  are:  (i)  to  improve  flood  warning  and  emergency  response \nsystems to better prepare people for floods; (ii) to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of \nprovincial  and  local  government  agencies,  and  to  ensure  that  interagency  coordination \nmechanisms are functional; and (iii) to continually monitor the financial position of municipalities \nand  counties  in  order  to  ensure  that  they  are  prepared  to  meet  annual  fiscal  requirements  for \nproject implementation. Measure (ii) will be carried out under the technical assistance. \n\nThe  collective  benefits  will  outweigh  the  costs  and  outweigh  the  risks.  Mitigation \n\n60. \nmeasures are designed to warn of risks in advance and allow time to respond to those risks. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government and HnPG as the EA give the \n\n61. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n1. \n\nFlood Protection and Management Improvements \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nin  consultation  with \n\nHnPG through the PPMO will arrange for the preparation of the remaining \n27  noncore  subproject  FSRs  through  a  qualified  design  institute  in  line \nwith  the  standards  set  in  the  eight  core  subproject  FSRs,  hold  required \npublic  consultations,  revise,  and  obtain  approval  of  the  municipal  or \ncounty  local  government  prior  to  submission  to  PDRC  for  appraisal  and \napproval. \nthe  PWRD,  Hunan  PFD,  Hunan \nPDRC, \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau, and relevant line agencies, will review \nand appraise the 27 noncore subprojects and ensure that the subproject \nselection criteria agreed with ADB are demonstrated. \nThe PPMO will ensure all PRC domestic requirements arising from each \nFSR are  met in a timely way, including PRC-required approvals for land \nacquisition, environmental assessment, and technical assessments. \nHnPG  will  submit  all  noncore  subproject  FSRs  to  ADB  for  review  in \naccordance  with  subproject  selection  criteria,  and  for  approval  on  a  no-\nobjection basis.

Establish or upgrade hydrological stations in up to 35 subproject locations and link to \n\nprovincial data acquisition system (by June 2008). \n\n1.3. Improve data management, flood forecasting, and decision support systems for  \noverall flood management in up to 35 subproject locations (by June 2008). \n\n \n2. Flood Protection Works  \n    2.1. Prepare Feasibility Study reports for each selected non-core subproject. \n    2.2. Prepare detailed engineering designs for each selected subproject. \n    2.3. Acquire land where needed to accommodate flood protection civil works, temporarily  \nor permanently relocate affected persons, and provide compensation and other social \nand economic rehabilitation measures for affected persons in accordance with PRC \nlaws and regulations and ADB resettlement and indigenous peoples safeguard \npolicies. \n\n    2.4. Prepare initial environmental assessments and EMPs for each non-core subproject in \naccordance with PRC laws and regulations and ADB Environmental safeguard \npolicies. \n\n    2.5. Construct flood protection works for up to 35 subprojects, including rehabilitation and \nconstruction of dikes, upgrading and construction of sluice gates, upgrading and \nconstruction of pumping stations, and upgrading and construction of diversion \nchannels (according to subproject phasing).  \n\n \n3. Project Management \n    3.1. Establish and equip provincial and local project management offices in 35 cities (on a \n\nrolling basis according to subproject phasing) . \n\n    3.2. Train key government staff at municipality and county-level cities to plan, design, and \n\nimplement and monitor structural and nonstructural flood works according to PRC \nregulations and ADB safeguards (on a rolling basis according to subproject phasing). \n\n    3.3 Supervision and monitoring of subproject implementation by provincial and local \n\nproject management offices. \n\n    3.4 Strengthen provincial project management capacity (technical, financial, \n\nadministration, and implementation) for annual work planning and the successful \nimplementation and monitoring and evaluation of the Hunan Flood Management \nSector Project according to PPMS principles (throughout project implementation).  \n\n \n4. Sector Planning \n     4.1. Review and analysis of the Province's existing flood warning system and facilities in \n\none mountain river basin, existing flood warning facilities and optimize their design \nfor hydrometeorological data collection and flood preparedness for inclusion in the \n12th 5-year flood management plan (by June 2008). \n\n4.2. Feasibility assessment of providing flood insurance to rural and urban people \n\nthrough a pilot study in one project area for consideration in the 12th 5-year plan (by \nJune 2008). \n\n \na  Project  areas  refer  to  the  46  counties  (of  which  15  are  designated  poverty  counties)  in  which  the  35  subprojects  will  be \nlocated. The discrepancy between the number of counties and the number subprojects arises because subprojects located in \nprefecture-level municipalities tend to involve more than one district or county.  \nb Timing of milestones for the construction of structural measures is dependent on the phasing of the individual subprojects. \nWork on all subprojects is expected to begin by project year 3. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nRichard S.

Many cities and industrial centers \nare  adjacent  to  the  major  rivers  of  the  country,  meaning  that  a  high  proportion  of  the  PRC's \neconomic  activity  is  at  risk  from  periodic  floods.  In  the  PRC,  major  floods  and  poor  drainage \n(waterlogging)  are  the  most  frequent  and  severe  forms  of  natural  hazard.  Floods  recur \nfrequently  and  have  a  substantial  negative  impact  on  the  local,  regional,  and  national \neconomies. During the 1990s, direct losses caused by floods amounted to about CNY1.2 trillion; \ndirect losses from the 1998 Yangtze floods alone amounted to about CNY250 billion, and total \nloss of life exceeded 3,600 people. Annual flood-induced losses in the PRC are estimated to be \n1% (one estimate of the impact of the 1998 Yangtze flood is 4%) of the national gross domestic \nproduct  (GDP).  This  is  10  to  20  times  greater  than  the  losses  incurred  from  major  floods  in \ncountries such as the United States and Japan.1 \n \n2. \nThe  PRC  recognizes  that  structural  flood  management  measures  are  an  essential \nelement  of  flood  control,  implying  a  belief  that  flooding  can  be  controlled  through  human \nintervention. Since the 1998 Yangze floods, PRC has clearly acknowledged that a flood control \nonly approach is neither practical nor economically feasible because the cumulative effects of \nexcessive  control  are  complex  and  can  be  negative.  Managing  the  risks  associated  with \ngrowing  populations  and  economic  development  in  the  floodplains  requires  modifying  flood \nhazards,  modifying  exposure,  and  modifying  vulnerability.  Modifying  flood  hazards  involves \ninstallation of structural measures such as detention basins, levees and dykes, flood diversion \nchannels,  flood-control  dams,  and  other  regulating  structures.  Modifying  exposure  to  floods \ninvolves property acquisition, land use zoning, building codes, planning development controls, \nand building on platforms. Modifying flood vulnerability involves nonstructural measures such as \nflood forecasting and warning, emergency response, community awareness and preparedness, \npost-flood  recovery  actions,  and  flood  insurance.  Risk  assessment  determines  whether  the \nprevailing risk is tolerable and defense measures adequate, or whether additional risk mitigation \nmeasures are required. A flood management strategy considers such risks in planning to deal \nwith potential flood disasters\u2014either design-standard floods or more extreme events. Integrated \nflood management requires river basin scale assessment and considers economic, social, and \nenvironmental objectives to identify the best outcome for society as a whole. \n \n3. \nPolicy  and  Laws.    Flood  management  policy  is  embodied  in  the  PRC's  Law  on  Flood \nControl (1997), the 1999 Water and Soil Conservation Law (1999), the Water Law (2002), and \nin river basin-wide plans such as the Yangtze River Flood Control Plan (updated in 2005). Flood \nmanagement  strategies  and  action  plans  are  being  drawn  up  as  part  of  the  National  Flood \nManagement  Strategy  under  the  direction  of  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources.2  The  PRC's \nchanging approach includes a policy that the costs for flood protection and flood management \nworks  should  be  borne  by  beneficiaries\u2014either  provincial,  municipality,  or  county-level \nbeneficiaries.  Protection  is  needed  through  a  combination  of  structural  and  nonstructural \nmeasures to improve living conditions, and provide assurance for investors in communities and \nfuture development at affordable levels. \n\n                                                 \n1 Sogreah Consultants. 2005.

Hunan \nhas  5,141  rivers  with  channel  lengths  of  5  kilometers  (km)  or  more.  Most  of  Hunan\u2019s  rivers \noriginate in the mountainous border areas in the east, south, and west of the Province. These \nrivers  drain  96.7%  of  the  Province  as  part  of  four  major  provincial  river  basins\u2014the  Lishui, \nXiangjiang, Yuanjiang, and Zishui. These rivers drain into Dongting Lake and the Yangtze River \nsystem. Less than 4% of rivers drain south to the Pearl River basin, or eastward to the Poyang \nLake basin. The Province's four major river systems flow into the Dongting Lake. Dongting Lake \nalso  receives  inflow  via  three  diversion  channels  from  the  main  stem  of  the  Yangtze  River  as \noff-takes upstream from the city of Shashi. Dongting Lake then flows into the Yangtze River at \nChenglingji  in  Yueyang  County.  As  the  lowest  point  in  Hunan,  Dongting  Lake  acts  as  a  large \noffstream balancing reservoir for major flood flows in the Yangtze River, as well as an onstream \nretardation basin for discharge from the four rivers before it finally reaches the Yangtze River. \nThe  river  system  in  Hunan  Province  is  a  significant  part  of  the  overall  Yangtze  River  system, \njoining the Yangtze main stem at the critical and highly flood-prone middle reach via Dongting \nLake.  Addressing  flood  problems  in  Hunan  have  historically  been  key  to  Yangtze  River  flood \nmanagement, and the national Government identifies the Province as an integral part of overall \nYangtze River flood management. \n \nFloods in Hunan Province. Floods are a recurrent natural hazard in Hunan Province, \n5. \naccounting for more than 50\u201360% of the total economic losses stemming from natural disasters \nin the Province. The Lishui, Xiangjiang, Yuanjiang, and Zishui mountain river basins drain a total \narea  of  179,000  km2  (84%  of  the  provincial  area);  this  area  is  home  to 56.4  million people,  or \n84% of the provincial population. Intense cyclonic and/or typhoon rains are the main causes of \nfloods and drainage disasters in Hunan Province. Based on available statistics, rainfall exceeds \n50 mm per day, per station, for 3.3 days every year, on average. Flood-inducing rain normally \noccurs  from  March  to  October,  with  most  floods  occurring  between  May  and  October.  Wide \narea,  long-lasting  floods  usually  occur  in  June  or  July.  Two  types  of  floods  arise  in  Hunan:  (i) \nmountain  floods  (sometimes  called  flash  floods  that  are  generally  of  short  duration  and  high \nintensity),  which  usually  occur  in  the  upper  reaches  of  the  four  main  rivers;  and  (ii)  floodplain \nfloods  (wide  area,  long-lasting,  slowly  to  rapidly  rising,  slowly  receding  floods),  which  occur  in \nthe  lower  reaches  of  the  four  main  rivers,  and  throughout  the  Dongting  Lake  area.  Mountain \nfloods occur in stretches of river that have steep gradients, turbulent flow, short flow paths, high \nvelocity,  and  high  peak  discharges.  Water  levels  in  such  rivers  tend  to  rise  and  fall  quickly. \nThese  rivers  are  erosive  and  usually  heavily  laden  with  mud  and  rock.  Floodplain  floods  are \nlarger in scale (time, volume, and area), and lead to extensive damage because of their depth, \nwide coverage area, and long duration. \n \nC. \n\nProvincial Plans and Implementation \n\n6. \nHunan's  Flood  Plans.  In  general,  the  1  in  2-year  return  period  to  1  in  10-  or  20-year \nreturn  period  floods  in  Hunan's  river  systems  can  be  controlled  with  the  currently  existing \nprotection  measures.  But  average  floods  often  exceed  these  levels,  and  to  ensure  sustained \ndevelopment  of  Hunan's  economy,  improvements  to  the  provincial  flood-control  and  flood \nmanagement system are needed. In line with national flood management policy directives and \nstrategy, the Hunan Government prepared River Basin Flood Control Plan in 1999 for various \nstructural  and  nonstructural  interventions.  The  flood-control  program  for  Hunan  consists  of: \nflood control and drainage in the Dongting Lake Area; city flood control; flood-control reservoirs; \nriver  channel  regulation;  rehabilitation  of  unsafe  reservoirs;  flood  control  and  nonstructural \nsystems  warning  for  farmland  along  the  low  river  banks;  flash-flood  disaster  prevention  and \nwarning;  and  soil  and  water  conservation.  Elements  of  the  plan  are  illustrated  in  Figure  A2. \nFuture  plans  have  the  following  objectives:  (i)  economic  activity  and  social  life  should  not  be \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\naffected  by  average  floods;  and  (ii)  extraordinary  floods  should  not  severely  disrupt  economic \nactivity,  social  life,  or  the  long-term  provincial  economic  program.  Key  targets  include:  (i) \nestablishing  an  effective  flood-control  system  for  average  flood  events  (those  that  are  not \nexpected  to  exceed  infrastructure  design  standards);  (ii)  establishing  and  enforcing  legal \nstandards  for  approved  flood  diversion,  storage,  and  detention  basins;  (iii)  using  professional \nteams  to  fight  floods;  and  (iv)  designing  an  emergency  flood  response  program  for  all  major \nrivers  and  flood-prone  areas  to  prepare  for  flood  events  that  exceed  infrastructure  design \nstandards. \n \n7. \nStrategic Shift. Past investments have focused on flood control and disaster mitigation \nin  the  flood  plains  surrounding  Dongting  Lake.  In  a  strategic  shift,  the  Hunan  Provincial \nGovernment's  (HnPG)  flood  management  efforts  under  the  Hunan  Provincial  11th  Five-Year \nPlan  (2006\u20132010)  focus  on  flood  control,  management  and  forecasting  systems,  and \nemergency  response  systems  in  the  four  mountainous  river  basins  and  their  flood-prone \nmunicipal and county-level cities. The plan aims to reduce flood risks in mountainous catchment \nareas and provides priority structural protection to higher-value property and growth centers in \nthe mountain river basins. The plan prioritizes flood protection measures for 35 of the 94 flood-\nprone municipal and county-level cities, weighted by extent of the flood-prone area, frequency of \nflood  occurrence,  number  of  affected  peoples,  and  value  of  the  recurring  damages  and/or \nlosses.  The  strategic  shift  recognizes  that  full  control  of  flooding  in  the  Dongting  Lake  and \nlowland areas, including the lake's fertile floodplain farmlands, would be costly and diminish the \nnatural  role  the  lake  plays  in  retarding  Yangtze  River  floods.  Improving  data  acquisition, \ncommunication,  and  warning  and  response  systems,  and  establishing  a  decision-making \nframework that supports flood management decisions, are also part of the strategy. Table A2.1 \nsummarizes  the  current  status  and  future  actions  for  nationally  defined  flood  management \nprinciples. \n \n8. \nPlan Financing. In 2004, the Provincial Water Resources Department (PWRD) received \nonly 27% of its capital budget from national and provincial sources, compared with 65% in 2001. \nThis  decline  was  offset,  in  part,  by  an  increase  in  self-raised  funds  from  34%  of  the  capital \nbudget  for  flood  control  measures  in  2001,  to  51%  in  2004.  During  this  period,  capital \nexpenditure  on  flood  control  by  PWRD  was  $147  million  in  2001,  $244  million  in  2002,  $198 \nmillion  in  2003,  and  $127  million  in  2004.  Municipalities  and  counties  are  also  increasingly \nrelying on self-raised funds. As existing flood-control plans are reassessed to consider changing \neconomic conditions and strategies, flood risk-management measures and alternatives need to \nbalance cost and affordability of local stakeholders and communities. \n \n9. \nDisaster  Relief  Financing.  Hunan's  urban  and  especially  rural  poor  populations  are \nparticularly vulnerable to the impacts of flood disasters. Once hit by flood, livelihood recovery for \nthe poor greatly depends on disaster relief money. The current disaster relief system is mainly \nprovided by central and local governments. This places huge pressure on the fiscal system, and \ntimely  fiscal  transfers  can  be  hard  to  come  by.  Currently  natural  hazards  such  as  flood  and \nmudflow  hazards  are  included  in  the  property  insurance  provided  by  commercial  insurance \nbusinesses,  but  such  insurance  is  only  provided  outside  \u201cflood  passage\u201d  areas  and  flood \ndetention areas. In the areas where this insurance is offered, the outcome is not encouraging, \nas low-income rural households cannot afford it. The National Flood Control Law has stipulated \n(article  47)  that  Government  will  encourage  and  support  flood  insurance.  The  recent  Flood \nControl  Regulation  stipulated  by  the  national  Government  requires  local  governments  to \ninsurance \ngradually  establish \ncompanies  find  it  hard  to  operate  in  such  markets  without  government  support.  For  all  intents \nand purposes, the flood insurance market in the PRC does not exist. \n\ninsurance  mechanisms.

The  Hunan  Provincial  Flood  Control  and  Drought  Relief \n10. \nHeadquarters  (PFCDRHQ)  is  responsible  for  flood  management  in  Hunan  Province,  which  is \nclosely related to flood management in the larger Yangtze River Basin. The office of PFCDRHQ \nis set up within PWRD. PFCDRHQ is headed by a provincial vice governor, with members from \nPWRD,  the  Meteorological  Administration,  the  Civil  Affairs  Department,  the  Communication \nDepartment,  and  other  relevant  provincial  agencies.  To  fulfill  its  mandate,  HnPG  has \nestablished  a  hierarchy  of  operational  regulations  for  flood  management  and  operation  of  the \nLishui, Xiangjiang, Yuanjiang, and Zishui rivers, and for Dongting Lake. Detailed measures and \nmanagement schemes are defined for managing large-scale floods, with responsibilities of the \nPFCDRHQ and other agency members explicitly stated. The municipal and county governments \nhave local flood-control and drought relief offices within their local water resource bureaus, with \nmembership  mirroring  provincial-level  agencies.  These  offices  are  headed  by  deputy  mayors. \nLocal  Flood  Control  and  Drought  Relief  Headquarters  membership  comprises  representatives \nfrom  local  government  level  line  agency  offices,  whose  responsibilities  are  similar  to  those  of \ntheir provincial counterparts, but with specific variations in line with local municipality and county \nflood characteristics and concerns. During flood events, they receive flood-status updates from \nthe  Hunan  Hydrology  Bureau  through  the  PFCDRHQ,  and  they  maintain  bidirectional \ncommunications  with  PFCDRHQ  during  emergencies.  They  are  responsible  for  assisting \ncitizens  and  stakeholders  under  their  jurisdiction,  keeping  the  provincial  authorities  advised  of \ndevelopments,  and  responding  to  directives  issued  by  the  PFCDRHQ.  The  organizational \nstructure for flood warning and management is well established. \n \nD. \n\nPolicy, Plan, and Capacity Strengthening \n\nIntegrated  Flood  Management  Plan  Development.  Flood-control  plans  for  Hunan \n11. \nProvince  are  a  part  of  the  integrated  national  flood-control  system.  The  River  Basin  Flood \nControl  Plan  includes  flood  control  as  an  integral  part  of  flood  management,  together  with \nsubplans  for  flood  control  in  river  basins  and  cities.  Established  plans  emphasize  using  flood-\ncontrol civil works (dikes, diversion channels, drainage culverts, pumping stations, embankment \nstabilization,  weir  rehabilitation,  and  dredging)  to  secure  and  protect  economically  important \nproduction  centers  and  infrastructure,  and  to  protect  strategically  located  cities  that  are \nfrequently  inundated  (at  least  once  every  5  years).  As  the  overall  flood  risk-management \nstrategy shifts toward greater use of nonstructural management measures, existing flood-control \nplans  should  be  reviewed,  updated,  and  costed  to  incorporate  and  expand  nonstructural \nmeasures. As plans are updated and approved, budget appropriations need to be realigned or \nincreased at the provincial and local government level. \n \n12. \nSubproject  Strengthening.  Municipality  and  county  flood  prevention  subprojects  are \npart  of  an  integrated  flood  management  strategy  and  are  regarded  by  provincial  and  local \ngovernments  as  priority  public  investments  to  secure  growth  and  development.  Subproject \nplanning needs to be carried out in conjunction with the integrated flood management strategy \nfor each river basin. Further analytical and design needs for subprojects include the following: \n(i) for subprojects located in the mountainous area of western Hunan (many of which have little \nhydrological and hydraulic survey data for estimating flood flows), data and design calculations \nneed to be cross-checked using several methods, as required by PRC regulations; (ii) operation \nand  maintenance  procedures  need  further  detailing  to  ensure  long-term  reliability;  (iii) \nrequirements  and  response  systems  should  be  clearly  identified  for  managing  floods  that \nexceed  infrastructure  design  standards;  (iv)  the  extent  to  which  planned  structural  works  will \nmitigate  flood  impacts  when  combined  with  the  indicated  nonstructural  measures  needs \nelaborating;  (v)  although  the  cumulative  impact  of  local  flood  works  is  not  expected  to  be \nsignificant, feasibility study reports are needed to variably assess the potential impacts of works \non  the  surrounding  area,  such  as  sediment  movement  in  constrained  river  channels,  and \nwaterlogging  in  urban  areas  (because,  for  example,  dikes  are  preventing  drainage  of  surface \n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nwater  during  the  flood  season);  analysis  of  these  impacts  needs  to  be  strengthened  and \nmitigating  measures  need  to  be  identified;  and  (vi)  some  subproject  feasibility  study  reports \nhave  undertaken  flood-risk  analysis,  but  because  data  is  limited  the  results  of  these  analyses \nare not always reliable for engineering planning; flood-risk analysis for subprojects needs to be \nstrengthened; and risk zoning maps need to be prepared for areas that currently lack them. \n \n13. \nProvincial  and  Local  Government  Coordination.  PWRD  and  the  provincial  project \nmanagement  office  (PPMO)  have  prior  experience  in  implementing  major  domestic,  World \nBank,  and  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  flood  control-related  civil  works  projects. \nLocal governments in the four river basins have varied experience in implementing major flood \nmanagement  works.  Construction  and  management  of  major  flood-control  works  and  flood \nresponse systems require qualified, experienced personnel. PWRD will need to provide support \nand  guidance  to  municipal  and  county  governments  for  the  implementation  of  subprojects. \nPWRD  and  its  related  line  agencies\u2014the  Provincial  Development  and  Reform  Committee, \nPWRD,  and  Provincial  Finance  Department\u2014will  need  to  ensure  that  municipal  and  county \ngovernments  and  the  associated  line  agencies  understand  and  follow  policy,  strategy,  and \nregulations  so  that  their  flood-control  works  and  flood  management  procedures  are  consistent \nwith provincial flood-control plans, and so that relevant staff are provided with skills to effect a \ncoordinated approach to flood management on a river basin-wide level. A PRC systems-based \nannual plan and management framework is needed to strengthen provincial\u2013local government \ncoordination, project monitoring, and implementation. \n \n14. \nResettlement and Environment Safeguards. As in other areas of the PRC, HnPG has \nalso  had  to  deal  with  resettlement  and  environment  management  in  association  with  the \nconstruction of flood works. When donors have considered PRC safeguard systems inadequate \nin  the  past,  they  have  applied  their  own  systems  to  ensure  compliance  with  donor-supported \ninvestments.  The  PRC  is  strengthening  its  laws  and  regulations  to  address  wider  concerns \nabout  managing  affected  people  and  the  environment.  Opportunities  are  emerging  to  address \nsocial and environmental safeguards by building capacity based on strengthened country-wide \nsystems.  For  externally  assisted  projects  where  major  construction  works  have  affected \npeople's livelihoods, safeguards have generally followed various donor requirements. A national \nsafeguard  system  that  replicates  donor  safeguard  standards  is  needed.  One  of  the  lessons \nlearned  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank's  ongoing  projects  is  that  safeguard  compliance  is \nbetter ensured through the use of an independent, on-site monitoring mechanism. Through the \nHunan Flood Management Sector Project, the Asian Development Bank can build government \ncapacity in the management and monitoring of safeguards. \n \n15. \nPublic  Awareness  and  Education.  Experience  from  previous  flood  and  emergency \nresponse shows that public awareness and participation is key to implementing successful flood \nmanagement,  avoiding  heavy  economic  losses,  and  fighting  floods.  A  challenge  for  flood \nmanagement in Hunan Province will be to raise public awareness of the need to shift from flood \ncontrol  to  flood  management.  Managers,  government  staff,  engineers,  researchers,  designers, \nand  residents  all  need  to  become  more  aware.  Public  awareness  in  flood  management  is  a \nmulti-sector concern. Public and institutional awareness of the developing strategy needs to be \nraised through training and mass media campaigns. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nFigure A2: Hunan Province River Basin Flood Control Plan \n\nHunan Province River Basin Flood \nControl Plan \n\nHydro and Power \nPlan \n\nIrrigation Plan \n\nNavigation Plan \n\nFlood Control \nPlan \n\nWater Supply \nPlan \n\nRiver Basin Flood \nControl Plans (6) \n\nFlood Control Plan for \nDongting Lake Area \n\nMunicipal and \nCounty-Level \nCity Flood \nControl Plan \n\nRisky Reservoirs \nReinforcement Plan \n\nWater and Soil \nConservancy Plan \n\nNonstructural Measures \nFlood Control Plan \n\nFocus of Hunan Flood Management Sector Project \n\n \n\n \n \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n2\n \n\ni\n\n3\n1\n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \nSUBPROJECT SELECTION CRITERIA \n \n\n1. \nThe  Hunan  Provincial  Government's  main  flood  management  objectives  include  (i) \neconomic activity and social life should not be affected by average floods; and (ii) extraordinary \nfloods  should  not  severely  disrupt  economic  activity,  social  life,  or  the  long-term  provincial \neconomic  program.  Achieving  these  objectives  requires  a  combination  of  structural  and \nnonstructural measures. Structural measures will improve the flood-control standard at county-\nlevel cities to a 1 in 20-year-return flood and in municipal cities to a 1 in 50-year-return flood or \n100-year-return flood. Structural measures in subprojects may include: (i) new and strengthened \nearth embankments, (ii) flood-control walls, (iii) dike slope protection and toe protection, (iv) dike \nseepage  prevention,  (v)  riverbank  protection,  (vi)  building  or  renovating  flood  diversion \nchannels,  (vii)  construction  of  new  gravity  discharge  culvert  sluices  and  electric  pumping \nstations, (viii) dredging to improve river channel capacity, (ix) installation of traffic access gates, \n(x)  renovation  or  removal  of  river  weirs,  and  (xi)  construction  of  flow  management  dams  and \ncontrol gates.  \n \n2. \nTo  be  eligible  for  financing  through  the  Project,  each  structural  subproject  feasibility \nreport  study  will  include  a  flood-risk  and  situation  assessment,  technical  analysis  and \ndescription,  subproject  rationale,  scope  and  components,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan, \nimplementation arrangements, financial and economic analysis, and social and poverty impact \nassessment. Based on the feasibility study, structural subprojects must be selected according to \nthe following criteria:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  subproject  is  a  priority  investment  in  the  Hunan  Provincial  11th  Five-Year \nPlan  (2006\u20132010)  and  conforms  to  one  of  four  local  River  Basin  Flood  Control \nPlans, namely the Lishui, Xiangjiang, Yuanjiang, and Zishui Rivers.  \nThe subproject flood-risk analysis is based on People's Republic of China (PRC) \nrequirements for hydrological and hydraulic survey data for estimating flood flow \nand impact, and structural designs meet PRC technical requirements. \nThe  structural  subproject  is  designed  to  minimize  cost  with  a  combination  of \nstructural and nonstructural measures for optimal flood management.  \nThe  subproject's  social  and  poverty  impact  assessment  assesses  that  the \nproposed  flood  protection  measures  will  have  a  net  positive  impact  on \nstakeholders' social welfare, will reduce poverty, and can be monitored. \nThe  subproject  is  designed  to  minimize  social  impacts  and  ensure  that  people \nadversely  affected  by  civil  works  under  the  Project  are  compensated  in \ncompliance  with  PRC  laws  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  involuntary \nresettlement  safeguard  policies;  land  acquisition,  resettlement  processes,  and \ncompensation procedures follow PRC laws and regulations; due consultation and \nprocess is carried out in line with resettlement plans agreed upon with ADB and \ndisclosed  to  affected  persons;  and  local  government  has  submitted  written \nconfirmation to the Executing Agency and ADB that all households to be moved \nas  a  result  of  the  subproject  are  agreeable  to  the  resettlement  terms  and \nconditions. \nThe  subproject \nthe \nenvironmental  impact  during  construction  can  be  minimized,  in  line  with  PRC \nlaws and regulations and ADB's environmental policies; a consultation process is \nin  line  with  environment  management  plans  are  undertaken,  documented  and \nagreed  among  stakeholders;  defined  mitigation  measures  can  be  taken  to \nmitigate  environmental  impacts  during  construction,  in  line  with  PRC  laws  and \n\ninitial  environmental  examination  assesses \n\nthat \n\n\f

effects from improved structural works. \nThe  Implementing  Agency  managing  the  subproject  is  assessed  by  the \nExecuting  Agency  to  have  the  necessary  staffing,  implementation,  and  financial \nmanagement  capacity,  including  internal  auditing  capacity,  or  can  provide \nspecific  assurances  that  shortcomings  can  be  rectified,  such  as  by  adding \nqualified staff or providing timely in-service training. \n\nimpact  stemming \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  The  subproject's  implementation  timeframe  is  reasonable,  and  surveys  and \ndesign  can  be  prepared,

Discrepancies in totals are due to rounding. \n \nThe following general parameters were used in estimating costs: \n\nThe exchange rate for base cost calculations has been adjusted for purchasing power parity. \nDomestic inflation rates and foreign inflation rates are based on the Economic Analysis and Operations \nSupport  Division  (EREA)  cost  escalation  factors.  Domestic  inflation  is  projected  at  3.3%  (2006),  3.2% \n(2007), and 3% for subsequent years. Foreign exchange costs are inflated at the rates of 2.8% (2006), \nand 1.9 % the subsequent years. \nPhysical contingencies for all expenditures are estimated at 10%. \nFinancing  charges  during  implementation  are  estimates  of  interest  during  construction.  The  front-end \nfee will be waived (assuming the Project is approved before 30 June 2007). \nBased on US dollar 5-years swap rate (5.07% as of 23 February 2006) and ADB terms for spread.   \nProject costs include local taxes, which are charged at 3.41% on the cost of civil works, and the vehicle \npurchase added fee, which is charged at 15% on the purchase of vehicles. Duties and taxes were not \napplied  to  the  cost  of  other  items  required  under  the  subproject  since  the  Government  is  expected  to \nexempt the subproject from payment of these charges. \n\n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n37 \n\nTable A6.2: Detailed Cost Estimates of Core Subprojects \n($\u2019000)  \n\n \n\nForeign \n\nLocal \n\nTotal \n\nCore Subproject \nA.

\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n\nTo  further  develop  strategic  interventions  in  integrated  flood  management  requires \n1. \nupdating  aspects  of  Hunan's  1999  River  Basin  Flood  Control  Plan.  The  sector  analysis  and \nProvincial Water Resources Department (PWRD) have identified two priority issues that need to \nbe improved in future flood management planning: flood warning systems and flood insurance \n(see  Appendix  2).  The  scope  of  plans  for  integrated  flood  management  and  supporting \ninvestments,  such  as \nthe  Hunan  Flood  Management  Sector  Project,  requires  strong \ncoordination  and  management.  The  Hunan  Provincial  Government  currently  uses  an  annual \nplan  system  for  managing  flood  investments,  but  application  needs  strengthening  to  be \nsustainable.  \n \nB. \n\nPurpose and Scope \n\nThe purpose of the technical assistance (TA) is to strengthen the capacity of PWRD in \n2. \nstrategic and annual planning and management systems to support integrated and sustainable \nflood  management.  The  advisory  TA  has  three  components:  (i)  a  review  and  analysis  of  the \nProvince\u2019s existing flood warning system that optimizes hydrometeorological data collection and \nflood preparedness; (ii) a feasibility assessment of providing flood insurance to rural and urban \npeople  in  Hunan;  and  (iii)  further  development  and  capacity  building  for  a  country  systems \nbased  annual  planning  and  management  system  for  the  Hunan  Flood  Management  Sector \nProject. Activities and outline terms of reference are as follows. \n \n\n1. \n\nNeeds  Assessment  and  Strategy  Development  for  the  Flood  Warning \nSystem in Hunan Province \n\nThe  TA  will  review  and  analyze  the  Province's  existing  flood  warning  system,  focusing \n3. \non  one  river  basin  jointly  identified  by  the  Province  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The \ndesign  of  existing  flood  warning  facilities  will  be  optimized  for  hydro-meteorological  data \ncollection,  analysis,  and  flood  preparedness.  Current  software  and  hardware  systems  will  be \nassessed  for  their  capacity  to  collect,  process,  and  disseminate  information.  Bottlenecks  in \ndeveloping  an  effective  flood  warning  system  will  be  identified  and  a  strategy  for  the  flood \nwarning system will be defined. \n \n\n2. \n\nFeasibility Assessment of Flood Insurance in Hunan Province \n\n4. \nThe TA will review existing international and domestic experiences in flood insurance. In \ncollaboration with the insurance industry and flood management agencies, the TA will evaluate \nflood hazard and economic losses using flood maps, hydrological and socioeconomic data, and \nthe  costs  of  managing  flood  insurance  in  the  chosen  pilot  urban  and  rural  areas.  National \ninsurance  regulations  and  legislative  procedures  for  flood  insurance  will  be  reviewed.  The \naffordability  of  insurance  for  households  and  businesses  will  be  examined  by  conducting  pilot \nsurveys  on  Hunan  households  and  businesses.  The  gap  between  the  level  of  flood  insurance \npremiums  that  people  can  afford  and  the  cost  of  providing  that  insurance  will  be  identified  in \norder  to  estimate  the  likely  amount  of  government  flood  insurance  subsidies  required. \nGovernment flood insurance subsidy estimates will be compared with historical financial losses \nand relief payments resulting from flood disasters in order to assess the fiscal feasibility of flood \ninsurance. The fiscal, legislative, and institutional feasibility of flood insurance in Hunan will be \nidentified and policy and planning recommendations developed.  \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n3. \n\nAnnual Planning and Management System for the Project  \n\n5. \nThe advisory TA will support the Hunan Provincial Government and local governments \nto  further  develop  domestic  annual  planning  and  management  systems  for  the  Hunan  Flood \nManagement  Sector  Project.  The  TA  will  support  implementation  preparedness,  including \nreview of noncore subprojects and their compliance with selection criteria. The TA will help to \nfurther  clarify  assigned  functions,  responsibilities,  and  procedures  (including  subproject \napproval,  contract  package  preparation,  review  and  approval,  reporting  and  monitoring,  site \ninspections,  and  overall  implementation  supervision)  among  provincial  and  local  government \nagencies.  The  proposed  annual  plan  and  management  system  designed  during  project \npreparation  will  be  improved  as  needed  and  implemented  in  line  with  the  Project's  first-  and \nsecond-year  work  plans.    The  TA  will  support  PWRD  in  identifying  human  resource \ndevelopment  needs  and  in  designing  and  delivering  a  training  program  in  safeguard  planning \nand  other  subjects.  Noncore  subproject  resettlement  and  environment  management  plans \nprepared  by  the  Hunan Hydro  and  Power  Design  Institute will  be  reviewed.  Field  visits  will  be \ncarried  out  to  discuss  plans  with  affected  people.  The  Provincial  Project  Management  Office \n(PPMO),  Hunan  Hydro  and  Power  Design  Institute,  and  Local  Project  Management  Office  will \nbe  advised  on  improvements  to  plans.  Prior  to  PPMO  submission  of  resettlement  plans  and \nethnic  minority  development  plans  to  ADB,  assessments  of  compliance  with  ADB  safeguard \npolicies  will  be  prepared  for  the  PPMO  and  ADB.  Training  on  resettlement  and  environment \nmanagement  and  monitoring  will  be  provided  to  the  PPMO  and  Local  Project  Management \nOffice. \n \nC. \n\nConsultant Needs \n\n6. \nTo  meet  these  objectives  and  outputs,  15  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices and 34 person-months of domestic consulting services will be required. The indicative \ninternational  consultants  include:  (i)  a  team  leader/flood  management  planner,  (ii)  a  flood \nwarning system specialist, (iii) a hydrological modeler, (iv) an insurance specialist, (v) a natural \nresources  economist,  (vi)  a  resettlement  specialist,  and  (vii)  an  environmental  specialist. \nIndicative  domestic  consultants  include  (i)  a  deputy  team  leader  with  expertise  in  institutional \ndevelopment and experience in integrated flood management, (ii) a flood warning specialist, (iii) \na  hydrological  modeler,  (iv) a  decision  support  specialist,  (v)  an  information  technology  (IT) \nsystem  specialist,  (vi)  an  insurance  specialist,  (vii)  an  economist/survey  specialist,  (viii)  a \nhydrologist, (ix) an environmental specialist, (x) a resettlement specialist(s), (xi) a public finance \nanalyst, and (xii) planning and management trainers. \n \nD. \n\nEstimated Costs \n\nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $620,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 will be \n7. \nprovided by ADB on a grant basis. The grant will be financed by the Government of Spain. The \nremaining  $120,000  will  be  financed  by  the  Government  through  in-kind  contributions.

Poor  transport,  environmental  degradation,  slow  economic \ngrowth,  lack  of  drinking  water,  extremely  harsh  conditions  for  production  and  livelihood,  and  high  concentrations  of \nethnic  minorities  characterize  these  areas.  Targeting  poor  villages,  increasing  participation,  and  addressing  both \nincome  poverty  and  non-income  poverty  are  the  main  features  of  new  strategy  for  poverty  reduction  in  the  new \nmillennium. \n \nIncreased  emphasis  on  reducing  urban  poverty  is  in  line  with  the  PRC's  current  poverty  strategy.  The  PRC  has  no \nofficial  urban  poverty  line,  and  urban  minimum  living  standards  are  set  by  different  city  governments,  under  which \nsupplementary  living  allowances  are  provided.  The  responsibility  for  financing  and  delivering  such  assistance  to  the \nurban  poor  lies  primarily  with  the  local  government.  The  urban  poor  include  laid-off  workers,  landless  farmers,  and \nvulnerable people (e.g., disabled, elderly, and women-headed households).  \n \nIn 2003, the total population in Hunan Province  was  about 66.6 million, of  whom 34%  were classified  as urban and \n66% as rural. Compared with the provinces in the western region of the PRC, much of Hunan is relatively well off, and \nthe  absolute  rural  poverty  figure  was  1.1  million  people,  or  2.5%,  in  2003,  which  is  less  than  the  national  average \n(3.4%). However, income poverty in rural areas of Hunan is still significant. Using the PRC's poverty line of CNY900 \nper capita per year, there were 4.1 million rural poor in Hunan in 2003, accounting for 9.3% of the population. Most of \nthe poverty is concentrated in the  western  mountainous areas,  which are characterized by poor infrastructure and  a \nhigh  concentration  of  ethnic  minorities.  In  addition,  under  the  poverty  guidelines  set  by  different  cities  and  counties, \nabout  1.34  million  urban  people  are  deemed  poor,  accounting  for  6%  of  the  provincial  population.  The  main  urban \npoverty reduction effort is focused on providing financial relief, supplemented with job information and skills training by \ndifferent local governments. \n \nImproving flood control in 35 mountainous  cities in Hunan Province  will benefit the poor directly and indirectly in the \nproject counties, particularly those poor residents in the project areas. In order to minimize inundation, flood mitigation \nrequires that control structures be placed in the most strategic locations rather than in areas with the largest number of \nthe poor. The Project is not intended to directly improve the income generation capacities of households or to address \nthe key impediments to poverty reduction in each location. The Project will benefit the poor by: (i) fostering community \nconsultation for the planning and design of subprojects and the formulation of resettlement plans, which will enhance \nthe community\u2019s role in developing appropriate means for income restoration, delivery of compensation, and technical \nassistance;  (ii)  providing  adequate  compensation  to  local  villages  for  land  loss  and  house  demolition;  following  the \nnew  State  Council  Document  (No.  28)  on  Deepening  Reform  on  Land  Acquisition  System  and  Reinforcement,  the \nadopted  compensation  will  provide  these  villages  with  an  opportunity  to  improve  and  restore  their  income  and \nlivelihood; and (iii) prioritizing employment for poor households, particularly in constructing and maintaining platforms \nand other relocated local facilities. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nThe  purpose  of  the  social  and  poverty  assessment  is  to  develop  a  broad  socioeconomic  and  poverty  profile  of  the \nproject area,  with an analysis of the key social issues associated  with the Project. Examination of the current social \npatterns in affected communities and analysis of the basic stakeholder interests have identified both positive benefits \nand short-term adverse impacts resulting from the Project. The social and poverty analysis is based on a combination \nof data collection, key informant interviews, focus-group discussions, and household surveys.  \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nBased on detailed social and poverty assessment among eight core subprojects, a poverty profile among the project \nbeneficiaries was derived. Due to the location of flood-control works, three quarters of project beneficiaries are urban \ndwellers.  The  main  stakeholders  include  urban  residents,  rural  residents,  enterprises  and  small  shops,  and \ngovernment.  Poverty  incidence  among  project  beneficiaries  is  10%  of  the  urban  population  and  5%  of  the  rural \npopulation. Urban poor account for 85% of total poverty in project-protected areas.   \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n47 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFrequent floods place a heavy economic, financial, and social burden on local communities. Severe flooding disasters \ncan claim lives, destroy housing and belongings, inundate crops, destroy small businesses, lead to factory closures, \nand damage public facilities. This causes substantial direct and indirect economic losses to local areas. For most rural \nand urban individuals, particularly vulnerable people, flood damage is a direct cause of impoverishment. In some cities \nand county-level towns, frequent floods directly cause about one third of urban poverty. In fact, among the urban poor, \nserious illness, loss of jobs, single-parent households, and flood damage are the key factors that lead to poverty. The \nconstruction of flood-control works in mountainous cities of Hunan will directly protect people in those cities, including \nurban and rural poor in the project-protected areas. \n\n \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes               \n\nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nStakeholder  analysis  was  conducted  during  project  preparation.  Based  on  interviews  with  officials  and  business \nrepresentatives, informal discussions among affected people, and sample surveys among benefited households, both \npositive benefits and negative impacts of the Project have been identified (see poverty impact assessment matrix in \nSupplementary  Appendix  C).  In  accordance  with  the  ADB  guidelines  for  poverty  and  social  issues,  the  social \nassessment  examined  the  basic  interests  of  vulnerable  groups  in  the  project-protected  areas,  including  urban  and \nrural  poor,  women,  and  minorities.  Through  extensive  consultation  with  the  stakeholders,  and  with  the  promotion  of \npro-poor,  pro-minority,  and  gender-sensitive  approaches,  the  social  assessment  has  led  to  a  range  of  proposed \nactivities  that  will  maximize  the  benefits  and  minimize  the  negative  impacts  of  the  Project.  These  activities  are \nsummarized,  and  recommendations  outlined,  in  the  resettlement  plans,  ethnic  minority  development  plan,  and \nenvironment management plans for subprojects. To minimize negative impacts of the Project, increase social benefits \nfor the local communities, and enhance poverty reduction impacts, the Project has developed a social action plan. The \nsocial action plan provides an overall framework to address mitigation measures within the resettlement plans, ethnic \nminority development plans, and environment plans for the Project.   \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe physical and psychological hardship caused by flood disasters affects all people in the path of floods. This means \nthat project benefits will accrue to women as well as men. These benefits include economic and noneconomic benefits \nfrom reducing flood risks, and improved environment along river fronts. The following project benefits will help women \nin  the  long  run:  safer  working  and  living  environments,  reduced  flood-caused  damages  to  houses  and  production \nfacilities, less time and money spent on flood mitigation, increased employment opportunities during and after Project, \nand increased economic development. As part of resettlement activities, gender-specific job training will be provided \nfor women affected by land acquisition and resettlement, and for affected ethnic minorities.  \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nE.

These  include:  (i)  land  acquisition  of  850 \nhectares  (ha),  55%  of  which  is  farmland;  this  will  require \neconomic  rehabilitation  of  14,800  persons;  (ii)  demolition \nof  1  million  square  meters  (m2)  of  structures;  this  would \ncause  the  relocation  of  5,167  households  and  20,800 \npersons;  and  (iii)  partial  or  full  displacement  of  95 \nenterprises and 132 shops. A resettlement framework and \nfull  resettlement  plans  for  eight  core  subprojects  have \nbeen  prepared  and  approved  by  ADB.  Full  resettlement \nplans will be prepared and approved prior to construction \ncommencing for the remaining 27 noncore subprojects. \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Significant \n\nFunding  for  the  Project  will  come  from  four  different \nsources:  (i)  the  flood-control  security  fund;  (ii)  the  urban \n\n Yes \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nAffordability \n\n \n \nLabor \n\n \n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nfor \n\nconstruction  and  maintenance  tax,  which  is  collected \nfollowing  relevant  national  and  provincial  regulation;  (iii) \nvarious local revenues, such as revenues from land lease \nsale  and \nland  exploitation;  and  (iv)  potential  grant \ntransfers  from  national  and  provincial  governments.  Any \nadditional  contributions  (cash  and  in-kind)  to  be  raised \nfrom  beneficiaries \nthe  Project  will  depend  on \nwillingness and ability to pay. \nBy reducing flood risks, the Project is expected to promote \nindustrial  investment  in  project  areas,  which  will  have  a \npositive impact on employment. Jobs will also be created \nduring construction  works. The Project  will have negative \nimpacts  on  95  enterprises;  these  impacts  and  provisions \nfor workers are addressed in the resettlement plans. \nFor  subprojects  located  in  counties  with  indigenous \npeoples,  there  will  be  some  impact  on  ethnic  minority \ngroups.  The  Project  will  have  mostly  positive  impacts  on \nlocal  and  ethnic  minorities  who  are  not  affected  by  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement.  However,  flood  protection \nworks  that  require  resettlement  of  ethnic  minorities  will \nrequire  measures  that  consider  the  needs  of  minorities. \nProvisions  for  mitigation  measures  are  included  in  the \nresettlement plan. The plan ensures that ethnic minorities \nadversely  affected  by  resettlement  will  benefit  from  the \nProject.  PRC  policies  and  programs  for  ethnic  minorities \nfurther  enhance  project  benefits \nfor  ethnic  minority \ngroups. Among the eight core subprojects, one subproject \nis  located  in  a  predominantly  ethnic  minority  county.  An \nethnic  minority  development  plan  and  an  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment framework have been prepared. \nOverall,  a  key  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  reduce  flood \nrisks and reduce peoples' vulnerability to floods.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n49 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK1 \n\nBackground \n\nProject Impacts \n\nA. \n \n1. \nThe  Project  will  support  activities  that  require  land  acquisition,  house  demolition,  and \nresettlement.  In  accordance  with  Asian  Development  Bank's  (ADB)  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement,  a  sector  Project  requires  the  preparation  of  (i)  a  resettlement  framework \napplicable  to  all  subprojects,  and  (ii)  resettlement  plans  (RPs)  for  core  subprojects.  The \nresettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  by  the  local  project  management  offices  (LPMOs), \nassisted  by  Hunan  Hydro  and  Power  Design  Institute  and  the  provincial  project  management \noffice  (PPMO),  based  on  detailed  socioeconomic  surveys  and  extensive  consultation  among \naffected  people.  Resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  during  project  implementation  for  the  27 \nremaining subprojects based on the resettlement framework. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  35  subprojects  will  affect  up  to  101  townships  (towns  or  subdistricts)  and  352 \nvillages  or  urban  residential  committees.  Up  to  863  hectares  (ha)  of  land  will  be  acquired, \nincluding 461 ha of farmland. The acquisition of farmland implies that up to 13,969 persons will \nneed  full  economic  rehabilitation.  In  addition,  during  the  construction  phase,  about  613  ha  of \nland  will  be  occupied  temporarily.  Along  with  land  acquisition,  about  1  million  square  meters \n(m2) of structures would need to be demolished, including 709,899 m2 of residential structures \nand  292,933  m2  of  non-residential  structures.  The  demolition  would  cause  relocation  of  5,236 \nhouseholds  and  would  affect  95  enterprises  and  132  shops.  About  62%  of  houses  in  areas \naffected  by  relocation  are  made  of  brick  concrete  and  38%  are  brick-wood  and/or  earth-wood \nstructures. A total of 20,133 persons will be affected. \n \nC. \n \nFor all the 27 noncore subprojects, individual RPs will be prepared based on preliminary \n3. \ndesigns  and  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  framework.  For  subprojects  that  affect  less \nthan 200 people, short RPs should be prepared; subprojects impacting more than  200 people \nwill require full resettlement plans. RPs will be reviewed by the PPMO before submission to the \nadvisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  resettlement  specialists  for  review  and  assessment  (see \nAppendix  13).  The  advisory  TA  resettlement  specialists  will  prepare  a  RP  compliance \nassessment note for each subproject.2 If the RP passes the advisory TA assessment, it will be \nsubmitted to ADB for review and approval. If quality improvements are needed, the advisory TA \nresettlement  specialists  will  specify  requirements  to  be  addressed  by  the  Hunan  Hydro  and \nPower Design Institute and LPMOs; once revisions are made, the RP will be rechecked, the RP \ncompliance assessment note will be revised, and the plan will be sent to ADB for approval. In \nthe  event  of  significant  changes  arising  from  detailed  designs  for  the  eight  core  subprojects, \nRPs  will  be  updated  and  disclosed to  the  affected  persons  and  sent  to  ADB  for  approval.  For \neach subproject, land acquisition or occupation, demolition of structures, and/or dispossession \nof assets can only commence after ADB approval of the RP or updated RP. \n\nPreparation and Approval Procedures for Resettlement Plans \n\n                                                 \n1   The  resettlement  framework  is  presented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  Detailed  RPs  are  presented  in \n\nSupplementary Appendix D for the eight core subprojects. \n\n2   The  proposed  TA-supported  field-based  review  process  is  designed  to  fulfill  OM  Section  F2/BP,  which  allows \nreview  by  an  international  third  party  acceptable  to  ADB  as  described  in  OM  Section  F2/OP,  para.  38.  In  the \nabsence of an advisory TA, ADB would have to review and approve RPs in accordance with OM Section F2/OP. \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nPolicy and Legal Framework \n\nD. \n \n4. \nThe resettlement framework reflects both the People's Republic of China's (PRC) legal \nrequirements  and  ADB\u2019s  policy.  The  main  principles  are:  (i)  minimizing  negative  impacts;  (ii) \ncarrying  out  resettlement  and  compensation  to  improve  or  at  least  restore  the  pre-project \nincome and living standards of affected persons; (iii) fully informing and consulting the affected \npersons on compensation options and resettlement planning; (iv) providing asset compensation \nat  replacement  rates;  and  (v)  compensating  in  full  for  lost  assets,  replacement  dwellings,  and \nresettlement allowances prior to ground-leveling and demolition. \n \n5. \nThe  resettlement  framework  stipulates  eligibility  and  entitlements  for  land,  houses, \nincome  losses,  and  rehabilitation  subsidies  in  accordance  with  the  1998  Land  Administration \nLaw, the State Council Document No. 28  Deepening Reform on Land Acquisition System and \nReinforcement (2004), and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995). As the PRC laws \nand  regulations  allow  for  variations  in  compensation  standards,  each  subproject  RP  will  give \nspecific  provisions  within  allowable  ranges  based  on  land  productivity,  the  available  land  in \naffected villages, and features of each subproject site.  \n \n6. \nAffected village groups will be compensated for permanent land losses through payment \nof  (i)  a  land  compensation  fee,  and  (ii)  a  resettlement  subsidy.  According  to  the  Land \nImplementation  Decree  (2000), \nthe  Hunan  Provincial \nAdministration  Law  (1998)  and \ncompensation for farmland will be based on annual average output value (AAOV) in the past 3 \nyears and multiples set forth according to average per-capita landholdings in affected villages. \nThe land compensation fee will be at least six times the AAOV, and the resettlement subsidy will \nbe at least 16 times the AAOV. Where possible, permanent land losses will be replaced through \nland reallocation within village domains. Temporary land losses will be compensated in cash to \naffected persons at the rate of two times AAOV (assuming 2 years of occupation), plus the land \nreclamation cost and compensation for lost crops and trees. \n \n7. \nHouse  and  attachments  losses  will  be  paid  to  affected  persons  in  cash  at  the  cost  of \nreplacement,  excluding  demolition  expenses  and  including  revenues  from  salvaged  materials. \nThe  compensation  rates  are  based  on  analysis  of  actual  material  costs  of  replacement \nstructures  in  each  project  area.  Compensation  for  attachments  to  buildings,  infrastructure \nfacilities, moving expenses, and trees has been set in accordance with compensation rates for \nsimilar  projects  in  project  counties.  Nonresidential  structure  losses  will  be  paid  in  cash  to  the \naffected work units and individuals at replacement cost. The compensation rates will be based \non  analysis  of  the  material  cost  of  replacement  structures  in  project  areas.  Compensation  for \nequipment relocation, moving expenses, and lost wages and net income during interruption will \nbe paid in accordance with actual costs. Impact on special public facilities will be compensated \nbased on the replacement cost to the relevant government departments. \n \n8. \nThe  PPMO  and  LPMOs  will  ensure  that  resettlement  entitlements  are  provided  to \naffected  people  prior  to  the  commencement  of  ground-leveling  and  demolition.  Land \ncompensation  and  resettlement  subsidies  will  be  paid  to  affected  village  groups.  Housing \ncompensation and compensation for crops and other assets will be provided directly to people \naffected  by  asset  loss.  Compensation  for  infrastructure,  such  as  electricity  lines  and \ncommunication  fixtures,  will  be  paid  to  the  government  departments  responsible  for  restoring \naffected infrastructure. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n51 \n\nResettlement and Rehabilitation \n\nResettlement Cost and Funding  \n\nE. \n \n9. \nLoss of land for farmers are generally not expected to be significant as most flood works \nwill take place in land classified as urban. However, there are some cases where the nature of \nthe flood protection works will impact village groups with farmland significantly. Affected villages \nwith  farmland  could  mitigate  losses  through  land  reallocation  and/or  cash  compensation.  In \nvillages  with  limited  land,  affected  persons  will  receive  non-land-based  and  non-farm  activity \nrehabilitation. For the eight core subprojects, detailed economic rehabilitation plans have been \ndrawn up for all seriously affected villages and included in the RPs; similar village rehabilitation \nplans will be prepared for the remaining 27 noncore subprojects. \n \n10. \nCompensation  for  house  demolition  and  rehabilitation  following  relocation  for  affected \nrural households will be provided based on replacement value, plus funds to obtain new housing \nsites connected to roads, electricity, and water within the villages they currently inhabit. Affected \nurban  households  will  be  provided  with  either  cash  or  in-kind  compensation  options.  In-kind \noptions include better quality replacement housing within the same urban area. Depreciation will \nnot  be  subtracted  from  housing  values  when  calculating  compensation,  and  people  will  be \nallowed to salvage materials from their old houses.  \n \nF. \n \n11. \nBased on detailed cost estimates of the eight core subprojects and preliminary estimates \nfor  the  27  noncore  subprojects,  the  total  cost  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is \nCNY790.0 million  ($92.8  million  equivalent),  including  CNY204.2  million  for  the  eight  core \nsubprojects and CNY585.8 million3 for the 27 noncore subprojects. These land acquisition and \nresettlement costs are included as part of total project costs. Compensation for land acquisition, \ndemolition of buildings, and other costs for each subproject should be paid to affected persons \nthrough  the  resettlement  office  of  their  city  or  county  project  management  office.  According  to \nthe  compensation  policies  and  standards  defined  in  the  RP,  the  payment  and  usage  of \ncompensation  funds  will  be  carried  out  under  the  supervision  of  the  internal  monitoring \nagencies,  with  regular  review  by  an  independent  external  monitoring  agency.  The  funding  for \nresettlement costs will be provided for through municipal or county budgets. Disbursements will \nbe monitored quarterly to ensure that full compensation has been paid in a timely manner. \n \nG. \n \nPublic  consultation  and  information  disclosure  was  undertaken  within  the  project  area. \n12. \nKnowledge and acceptance of the proposed compensation policies and rehabilitation measures \nfor  affected  persons  is  a  precondition  for  approval  of  RPs.  The  resettlement  framework  was \nprovided  to  local  governments  in  all  subproject  cities  in  June  2005.  For  the  eight  core \nsubprojects,  resettlement  information  booklets  have  been  distributed  to  affected  persons  to \nprovide details on impacts and compensation rates prior to ADB approval. The RPs were made \navailable  in  the  relevant  government  offices  at  municipal,  county,  and  township  levels;  village \noffices, and residential committees. This process has started for the remaining 27 subprojects. \nAny  updates  to  RPs  will  also  be  disclosed  to  affected  persons  prior  to  ADB  approval.  During \nimplementation, impacts, compensation entitlements, and payments will be publicly disclosed in \neach village or residential committee. \n \n13. \n\nBoth affected communities and project stakeholders can participate publicly in the entire \n\nInformation Disclosure and Public Participation \n\n                                                 \n3 The cost is subject to further revision pending the endorsement of the final RPs by 27 local governments. \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nGrievance Procedures \n\nInstitutional Responsibilities  \n\nresettlement  process.  Affected  persons  have  been  encouraged  to  participate  in  the  planning \nprocess;  this  will  continue  during  implementation  of  the  RP.  During  the  preparation  of  RPs, \ncommunities  and  affected  persons  were  invited  to  consultation  meetings,  where  they  were \ninformed  of  the  resettlement  framework  and  the  planned  developments.  The  PPMO  and \nsubproject  LPMOs  will  continue  to  consider  affected  persons'  opinions  on  resettlement  and \ncompensation policies. \n \nH. \n \n14. \nThe  PPMO  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project  implementation.  The  city  and  county \nLPMOs of the 35 subprojects are the agencies in charge of implementing the Project, including \npreparing  and  implementing  the  individual  RPs.  They  will  share  this  responsibility  with \nmunicipality  and  county  city  local  land  management  and  resettlement  offices,  which  will  be \nresponsible  for  resettlement  activities  including  asset  valuation,  consultation,  delivery  of \nentitlements; and issuance of land acquisition, demolition, and building permits. Field tasks such \nas  compensation  disbursement,  selection  of  replacement  land,  and  provision  of  livelihood \nsupport will rest with township officers and village leaders. \n \nI. \n \nComplaints  and  grievance  procedures  are  set  out  in  the  RPs.  The  local  city  or  county \n15. \nsubproject  resettlement  office  will  keep  records  of  all  appeals  and  resolutions.  Following  the \nnew  provisions  of  the  Land  Administration  Law  and  the  new  Grievance  Regulation  (which \nbecame  effective  on  1  May  2005),  affected  persons  will  be  made  aware  of  grievance \nprocedures through the participatory meetings and through the resettlement information booklet. \nIf any affected person does not agree with the compensation or RP, he or she can voice their \ncomplaint to the village committee (residential committee). The village or residential committee \nshould  keep  records,  consult  with  the  local  resettlement  office,  and  provide  a  reply  to  the \naffected person within 10 days. If the affected person is not satisfied with the reply, he or she \ncan  appeal  to  the  township  or  subdistrict  resettlement  work  group,  which  will  record  the \ncomplaint,  consult  with  the  local  resettlement  office,  and  provide  the  affected  person  with  a \nsolution within 10 days. If the affected person still does not accept the proposed resolution, then \nhe  or  she  can  appeal  directly  to  the  city  or  county  resettlement  office.  The  resettlement  office \nshould make a record of that appeal and provide a resolution within 15 days. If the dispute still \ncannot  be  resolved,  then  the  affected  person  can  either  appeal  to  the  PPMO,  go  through  an \nadministrative  appeal  according  to  the  \u201cAdministrative  Procedure  Law  of  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina\u201d, or go directly to the People\u2019s Court. \n \nJ. \n \nAs required by ADB, both internal and external monitoring of RP implementation will be \n16. \ncarried out. Internal monitoring will be the responsibility of the PPMO and subproject LPMOs, as \npart  of  the  Project's  management  and  monitoring  system.  This  will  include  reviewing  the \nimplementation milestones, tracking progress of physical and financial progress, and reporting \nresults  to  ADB  on  a  quarterly  basis.  External  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  assigned  to  a \nqualified independent monitoring agency. External monitoring reports will be submitted to ADB \nand the PPMO twice a year after resettlement activities are completed. Each subproject will be \nevaluated  annually  for  2  years.  Once  resettlement  is  deemed  successfully  completed,  the \nPPMO will submit a resettlement completion report to ADB. \n \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nETHNIC MINORITY DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK1 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n53 \n\nThe  Ethnic  Minorities  Development  Framework  (EMDF)  of \n\nthe  Hunan  Flood \n1. \nManagement Sector Project is designed to ensure that project benefits and mitigation measures \nare distributed equitably among affected minority communities and individuals, and that special \nactions are taken accordingly. The EMDF prepared for Sangzhi County2 (a core subproject) is \nbased on the resettlement framework, the social and poverty assessment, and consultation with \nethnic minority groups and relevant agencies. The EMDF includes four main components: (i) an \noutline  of  project  scope;  (ii)  a  summary  of  distribution  and  socioeconomic  characteristics  of \nethnic  minorities in  project  areas;  (iii)  the  basic  legal  framework  for  the EMDF,  which  includes \nboth national laws concerning the ethnic minority population in the People's Republic of China \n(PRC), and provisions of ADB Policy on Indigenous Peoples; and (iv) key provisions to enhance \nthe economic conditions of minority groups based on review of the ethnic minority development \nplan (EMDP) for the core subproject assessed. Provisions for mitigation measures are included \nin the resettlement plan, which ensures that ethnic minorities adversely affected by resettlement \nwill  benefit  from  the  Project.  PRC  policies  and  programs  for  ethnic  minorities  further  help  to \nprotect and enhance project benefits to ethnic minority groups.  \n \nB. \n\nEthnic Minorities in Project Areas  \n\n2. \nThe four river basins have a relatively high concentration of ethnic minorities compared \nwith the rest of Hunan Province. There are an estimated 8 million ethnic minority people living in \nthe  four  river  basins,  accounting  for  about  13%  of  the  total  population.  The  Tujia  (11%  of  the \npopulation), Miao (8%), and Dong (4%) are the main ethnic groups. The 47 counties covered by \nthe  Project  are  home  to  about  3  million  ethnic  minority  people  (12%  of  the  total  population  in \nthose  counties).  This  includes  1.5  million  Tujia  (41%  of  the  total  minorities),  0.56  million  Yao \n(18%), 0.45 million Miao (15%), 0.23 million Dong (7%), and 0.17 million Bai (3%). Forty percent \nof ethnic minorities in project counties live in the Lishui basin, 36% live in the Yuanjiang basin, \n22%  live  in  the  Xiangjiang  basin,  and  2%  live  in  the  Zishui  basin.  Most  of  the  ethnic  minority \npopulations  living  in  the  project  area  are  located  in  nine  western  counties.  Social  surveys  and \nanalyses  of  subprojects  in  these  nine  counties  have  determined  that  ethnic  minorities  will  be \namong the project beneficiaries and project-affected persons. \n \nC. \n\nScreening Criteria and Preparation Procedures for EMDP  \n\nThe Project is committed to ensuring and has the organizational structure to ensure that \n3. \nethnic  minorities  are:  (i)  consulted  in  matters  related  to  each  subproject,  (ii)  provided  with \nopportunities to participate in decision making related to the subproject, and (iii) provided with \nopportunities  for  participation  in  project  activities  should  they  so  desire.  The  basic  criteria  for \ndetermining  whether  an  EMDP  will  be  required  for  any  subproject  is  to  determine  whether  a \nsignificant  proportion  of  project  beneficiaries  and  project-affected  persons  belong  to  ethnic \nminorities.  Based  on  social  analysis  and  statistics,  nine  subproject  counties  where  ethnic \nminorities account for more than 15% of population will be need to prepare individual EMDPs. \nThe other subprojects are located in urban or peri-urban areas, which tend to have lower ethnic \nminority populations. \n                                                 \n1   Initial screening for impact on indigenous people assessed the Project as category B. Specific action favorable to \nindigenous peoples/ethnic minorities will be addressed through resettlement plans, which are detailed in Appendix \n14. \n\n2   The  EMDP  for  Sangzhi  county,  which  has  been  reviewed  and  approved  by  the  local  authority,  is  included  in \n\nSupplementary Appendix C.  \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nD. \n\nEthnic Minority Development Plan \n\n4. \nBased  on  extensive  consultation  among  stakeholders,  an  EMDP  will  be  developed  for \neach  of  the  nine  subprojects  concerned.  The  content  of  the  EMDPs,  following  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) policy and the sample EMDP for Sangzhi, will consist of an overview \nof  minority  groups,  their  socioeconomic  conditions,  potential  negative  impacts,  proposed \nmitigation  measures,  and  enhancement  programs  and  actions  to  be  carried  out  during  project \nimplementation.  The  EMDP  will  include  a  range  of  measures  to  (i)  mitigate  potential  negative \nimpacts;  (ii)  enhance  positive  benefits  for  the  beneficiaries  based  on  existing  policies  and \nprograms aimed at minority populations; and (iii) ensure that project benefits accrue to affected \nminority  populations  in  a  preferential  or  at  least  in  an  equitable  manner.  Based  on  proposed \nmeasures,  detailed  budget  and  implementation  arrangements  should  be  developed,  including \ninstitutional-structure  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  arrangements.  Each  EMDP  will \ninvolve  local  participation  and  will  include:  a  legal  framework,  baseline  data,  land-tenure \ninformation,  identification  of  development  or  mitigation  activities,  the  institutional-structure \narrangement, an implementation schedule, M&E arrangements, and a cost and financing plan. \n \nE. \n\nReporting, Budget, and Implementation Arrangements \n\n5. \nThe EMDP will be reviewed and endorsed by a local project management office (LPMO), \nand  submitted  to  ADB  through  the  Provincial  Project  Management  Office  (PPMO)  in  line  with \nprocedures for review, submission and approval of feasibility study reports, resettlement plans, \nand  environment  assessments.  All  mitigation  measures  will  be  financed  by  the  local \ngovernment.  Based  on  types  of  measures,  actions  will  be  financed  by  existing  government \nminority  assistance  program  or  funds;  or  by  counterpart  funds  as  part  of  project  resettlement \nprogram or environment mitigation measures.  \n \n6. \nThe PPMO will be responsible for management of overall project implementation and the \nEMDP. The LPMOs for the nine minority counties are the Implementing Agencies.  As such they \nhave  specific  responsibilities  to  implement  the  EMDPs  in  accordance  with  this  EMDF.  The \nPPMO  will  authorize  the  LPMO  of  each  subproject  city  to  regularly  monitor  and  report  on  the \nimplementation of EMDPs, as per the requirements of this EMDF. County governments will take \na  leading  role  in  implementing  mitigation  measures.  Several  government  agencies  will  be \ninvolved,  including  the  minority  affairs  bureau,  land  administration  bureau,  poverty  reduction \noffice,  forestry  bureau,  agricultural  bureau,  women\u2019s  federation  (government  organized  NGO), \nand township governments. \n \nF. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n8. \nThe M&E of each EMDP is required to ensure that each plan complies with PRC laws \nand regulations and ADB policies, and that it  meets its specified objectives. ADB, through the \nPPMO,  will  provide  assistance  to  LPMOs  in  formulating  the  M&E  plans.  The  objectives  of  the \nM&E  plans  are  to  be  agreed  upon  before  subproject  implementation.  Data  and  information, \ndisaggregated  by  gender  where  possible,  will  be  gathered  in  line  with  the  indicators  of \nresettlement  in  order  to  identify  project  impacts  and  project-induced  social  changes  on  ethnic \nminorities and their communities. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n55 \n\nENVIRONMENT ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\n1. \nCountry  Environment  System  Categorization.  The  Hunan  Environmental  Protection \nBureau (HEPB) was granted authority by the State Environmental Protection Administration to \nreview the proposed Project. In July 2005, HEPB officially certified that: according to the State \nEnvironmental  Protection  Administration  Order  14  on  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA) \ncategorization,  as  a  sensitive  dike  construction  project  an  EIA  document  should  be  prepared; \nand  according  to  the  Notice  on  Strengthening the  Environmental  Management  of  International \nFinance Institution Projects, promulgated in 1993, projects which have limited negative impacts \non the environment should be designated category B. Based on the above the HEPB assigned \nthe Project as category B, and required that a full EIA report be prepared. The Hunan Hydro and \nPower Design Institute subcontracted the Environmental Science Institute of Hunan Province to \nprepare  an  EIA  report,  which  was  to  be  supplemented  by  Hunan  Hydro  and  Power  Design \nInstitute-produced  category  B-level  environmental  impact  reports  (EIRs,  also  referred  to  as \nenvironmental forms) for all subprojects. A draft of the EIA report, without the subproject EIRs, \nwas  submitted  to  the  HEPB  in  early  July  2005.  The  EIRs  were  completed,  reviewed  by  local \nenvironmental protection bureaus, and submitted to the HEPB. Final HEPB approval of the EIA \nwas provided in November 2005. \n\nADB Environment Categorization. For ADB environmental assessment purposes, the \n2. \nProject  has been  classified  as  Category  B.  As  the  Project will  be implemented  under  a  sector \napproach,  eight  priority  core  subprojects  have  been  developed  in  full  to  the  ADB-standard \nfeasibility  level  during  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  implementation.  In  accordance  with  the \nenvironmental  requirements  of  the  ADB,  an  environmental  review  of  the  Project  was \nundertaken.  The  summary  initial  environmental  assessment  is  provided  in  Supplementary \nAppendix D. In addition, a project-wide consolidated initial environmental evaluation (IEE) and \nconsolidated  environment  management  plan  (EMP)  were  also  prepared.  An  IEE  report, \nincluding  an  EMP,  was  prepared  for  each  of  the  eight  core  subprojects.  Subproject  EMPs  (i) \npresent  environmental  compliance  and  ambient  monitoring  programs,  relevant  to  People's \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC)  environmental  standards  and  regulations  that  will  be  adopted,  and \nenvironmental  reporting  requirements;  (ii)  facilitate  institutional  arrangements  and  define  roles \nthe  environmental  mitigation  measures, \nand  responsibilities \nenvironmental  compliance  and  ambient  monitoring  programs,  and  environmental  reporting; \n(iii) provide the basis for compliance with the environmental requirements of PRC and ADB; and \n(iv) present the subproject EMP budgets. \n\nimplementation  of \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nB. \n\nProject Environmental Impacts \n\n3. \nConstruction  of  the  Project  is  not  anticipated  to  have  significant  terrestrial  ecological \nimpacts  as  the  project  study  area  typically  consists  of  heavily  modified  urbanized/semi-rural \nfarmland mosaics, and no sensitive terrestrial resources or rare and endangered flora and fauna \nhave been identified in the core subproject project study areas. Dike construction will not affect \nthe  hydrology  of  the  project  rivers.  The  main  impacts  that  require  special  measures  are \nassociated  with  the  construction  phase,  including:  soil  erosion  and  runoff  from  exposed \nearthwork sites, the rehabilitation of borrow areas and spoil sites, construction wastewater and \ndomestic  wastewater  from  construction  camps,  construction  solid  wastes  and  domestic  waste \nfrom construction camps, air pollution from traffic and construction site dust, noise pollution from \nconstruction  activities  and  heavy  machinery,  dredging,  on-  and  off-site  health  and  safety,  and \npublic safety. Where dredging is planned, it will be implemented carefully to minimize impacts, \nas  will  construction  in  some  locations  so  as  to  not  damage  historical  and  culturally  important \nsites and edifices. \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nOverall,  construction  environmental  impacts  are  localized  and  temporary,  and  can  be \n4. \nadequately  mitigated.  Operation  of  the  dikes  and  other  flood  works  will  have  no  significant \nnegative impacts on the project rivers water' levels or water quality, or on terrestrial or aquatic \nflora  and  fauna.  A  comprehensive  program  of  mitigation  measures,  ambient  and  effluent \nenvironmental  monitoring,  and  compliance  inspections  has  been  designed  to  address  these \nissues.  If  the  mitigations  are  implemented,  the  Project  should  have  minimal  negative  impacts \nand should result in positive benefits brought about by the flood protection. \n\nC. \n\nEnvironmental Criteria for Subproject Selection and Approval Process \n\n5. \nTo  be  eligible  for  financing  through  the  Project  during  implementation,  each  noncore \nstructural subproject will be screened according to technical, social, financial, and other criteria \ndefined in Appendix 3. Table A16.1 presents environmental criteria that will be used to screen \nsubprojects. \n \n\nTable A16.1: Noncore Subproject Environmental Selection Criteria \n\nCriteria \nStructural \nMeasures \n\n \nSiting   \n\nEnvironmental \nReview \nRequirements \n\nSpecifications \nStructural measures in subprojects may include: new and strengthened earth embankments, flood-\ncontrol  walls,  dike  slope  protection  and  toe  protection,  dike  seepage  prevention,  riverbank \nprotection,  building  or  renovating  flood  diversion  channels,  construction  of  new  gravity  discharge \nculvert sluices and electric pumping stations, dredging to improve river channel capacity, installation \nof  traffic  access  gates,  renovation  or  removal  of  river  weirs,  and  construction  of  flow-management \ndams and control gates. No other structural measures are allowed. \n \nConstruction works will not take place in any areas of special environmental significance, including \nwetlands, areas of habitat for rare and endangered flora and fauna, and protected areas or nature \nreserves. \n \n\n(i)  A  subproject  environmental  review  has  been  prepared  either  in  accordance  with  the \n\nenvironmental assessment framework (EAF) presented in Table A17.2.  \n\n(ii)  The environmental review indicates that the  subproject  will not result in significant long term \n\nnegative environmental impacts. \n\n(iii)  Mitigation measures will follow PRC laws and regulations.  \n(iv)  Requirements for mitigation implementation are to be directly incorporated into the subproject \n\nconstruction contracts. \n\n \nDue  public  consultation  and  processes  in  line  with  the  Environment  Management  Plan,  PRC  and \nADB requirements are agreed upon with ADB and implemented. \n\nPublic \nConsultation \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PRC = People's Republic of China. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n6. \nTwo  levels  of  environmental  approval  review  and  approval  will  be  undertaken  for \nproposed  noncore  subprojects  depending  on  the  scale  of  the  flood  works  proposed  and  the \nextent  of  dredging  works,  as  summarized  in  Table  A.16.2.  Category  1  noncore  subprojects \nprovide  flood  protection  works  designed  to  control  floods  that  exceed  a  1  in  50-year  return \nperiod , or involve dredging in excess of 200,000 cubic meters (m3), or have dike construction \ntaking  place  adjacent  to  a  Class  1  water  source  protection  zone.  Because  of  the  height  and \nmagnitude  of  the  dikes  and  flood  walls  required  to  protect  against  floods  that  exceed  the  1  in \n100-year  return  period  \u2014and  the  associated  higher  rates  of  excavation,  demolition,  materials \nused, and production of wastewater and solid waste; the relatively high levels of dredging; and \nthe  need  to  protect  drinking  water  source  zones\u2014Category  1  subprojects  require  the  highest \ndegree of environmental review. The Provincial Project Management Office (PPMO) will prepare \nan  IEE  in  accordance  with  ADB  environmental  assessment  guidelines.  The  IEE  must  be \nsubmitted to the ADB for review and approval at least six weeks before the subproject contract \nis  awarded.  The  ADB  will  approve  and/or  comment  on  the  IEE  within  three  weeks  of  its \nsubmission.  The  review  will  be  undertaken  by  the  Agriculture,  Environment,  and  Natural \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n57 \n\nResources  Division  of  ADB\u2019s  East  Asia  Department  in  consultation  with  the  Regional  and \nSustainable  Development  Department.  Category  2  noncore  subprojects  have  flood  protection \nworks designed to control floods below the 1 in 50-year return period,  a dredging volume less \nthan 200,000 m3, and are not located adjacent to Class 1 water source protection zones. These \nsubprojects have more moderate sized dikes, flood walls, and associated impacts. The PPMO \nwill  prepare  an  environmental  impact  report  (EIR)  in  accordance  with  PRC  Category  B  level \nrequirements  and  submit  it  to  the  HEPB  and/or  relevant  subproject  municipal  environmental \nprotection  bureaus  for  approval  and  review.  Upon  approval  by  the  environmental  protection \nbureaus, the PPMO will submit the EIR to ADB. If deemed equivalent to an ADB standard IEE, \nthe  EIR  will  be  endorsed  on  a  non-objection  basis  at  least  4  weeks  before  the  subproject \ncontract  is  awarded.  Where  the  EIR  is  not  equivalent  to  an  IEE,  an  IEE  will  be  prepared  for \nADB's no-objection endorsement at least 4 weeks before the subproject contract is awarded. \n \n\nTable A.16.2: Summary of Noncore Subproject Environmental Assessment Framework  \n\nItem \nSubproject \nCharacteristics \n\nSubproject \nEnvironmental  Review \nProcess \n\nProposed  \nNoncore Subprojects  \n\nCategory 1 \n\nCategory 2 \n\n\u2212  Protection standard > 1:50 yr  \n\u2212  Dredging > 200,000 m3 \n\u2212  Class 1 water source protection zone \n\u2212  ADB standard subproject IEE to be \n\n\u2212  Protection standard \u2264 1:50 yr \n\u2212  Dredging \u2264 200,000 m3  \n\u2212  No class 1 water source protection zone \n\u2212  PRC category B standard subproject EIR \n\nprepared \n\n\u2212  ADB must review and approve \n\n14 subprojects: Hengyang municipality, \nShaoyang,  Zhuzhou, Youxian, \nHengyang county, Longhui, Zhongfang, \nCili, Zhuzhou, Xiangtan, Qiyang, Liling, \nShimen, and Lengshuijiang \n\nto be prepared \n\n\u2212  HEPB and/or local EPB to approve \n\u2212  ADB endorses on a no-objection basis \n13 subprojects: Jiangyong, Xintian, \nNingyuan, Xupu, Lianyuan, Shuangfeng, \nShaodong, Jianghua, Xinhuang, \nFenghuang, Baojing, Chenzhou, and Jishou \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  EIR  =  environmental  impact  report,  EPB  =  Environmental  Protection  Bureau, \nHEPB = Hunan Environmental Protection Bureau, IEE = initial environmental evaluation, PRC = People\u2019s Republic \nof China, m3 = cubic meter, yr = year.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n\nD. \n\nManagement of Environmental Impacts and Costs \n\n7. \nA  stand-alone  consolidated  (project-wide)  EMP  has  been  prepared.  The  consolidated \nEMP includes: an overview of the predicted environmental impacts of the Project, an overview \nof the recommended mitigation measures, an environmental assessment framework to evaluate \nthe  remaining  28  noncore  subprojects,  and  an  environmental  compliance  and  ambient \nmonitoring program. In addition, the consolidated EMP facilitates institutional arrangements for: \nthe \nimplementation  of \nrecommended  environmental  mitigation  measures;  implementation  of  the  recommended \nenvironmental compliance and ambient monitoring programs, including reporting requirements; \nand compliance with the environmental requirements of PRC and ADB. The estimated budget \nfor environmental protection and management is approximately $13.5 million. \n\nthe  environmental  assessment \n\nimplementation  of \n\nframework; \n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Responsibilities \n\n8. \nThe  EMPs  (consolidated  and  subproject)  present  institutional  arrangements  and \nresponsibilities for the implementation of the measures and activities presented in the IEEs and \nEMP.  They  specify  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  key  stakeholders  for  environment \nmanagement,  including  the  PPMO  and  its  environmental  and  social  division,  subproject  local \nproject  management  offices  (LPMOs)  and  their  local  environmental  and  social  divisions,  the \nHEPB,  local  environmental  protection  bureaus  and  their  environmental  monitoring  stations, \nenvironmental  supervision  engineers,  construction  supervision  engineers,  the  contractors,  and \nADB  review/supervision  missions.  The  EMPs  also  present  measures  for  enforcing  mitigation \nimplementation and actions to be taken if noncompliance occurs. \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nThe  PPMO  and  ADB  have  agreed  that  an  environmental  management  regulation  for \n9. \nproject construction will provide the legal basis for the overall environment management of the \nProject.  It  will  be  developed  by  the  environmental  and  social  division  of  the  PPMO.  It  will \naddress  the  common  environment  management  and  mitigation  requirements  and  issues  of  all \nsubprojects, and should include, but not be limited to, a summary of: a) the mitigation measures \npresented  in  the  consolidated  IEE,  b)  the  project  EMP  presented  in  the  consolidated  EMP, \nc) applicable PRC environmental regulations and standards presented in the consolidated EMP, \nand  d) requirements \ninto  subproject \nfor \nconstruction tendering documents and contracts.  \n\nincorporation  of  environmental  considerations \n\n10. \nAt the subproject, the local environment and social division under the supervision of the \nenvironmental and social division, will develop tendering documents and ultimately construction \ncontracts  that  clearly  define  the  contractors\u2019  environmental  obligations.  The  subproject \nconstruction  contract  environmental  obligations  should  include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  the \ncontractors' responsibilities with respect to: a) implementing the mitigation measures presented \nin  the  subproject  IEE;  b)  participating  in  the  compliance  monitoring  program  (mitigation \ncompliance monitoring and mitigation construction quality monitoring) presented in the EMP of \nthe  subproject  IEE;  c)  participating  in  the  ambient  monitoring  program  presented  in  the \nsubproject IEE; d) reporting responsibilities as presented in the subproject IEE; e) participating \nin  the  environmental  enforcement  mechanism;  f)  developing  a  construction  EMP,  which \ndescribes how the contractor will meet its environmental obligations; g) developing a health and \nsafety  plan,  which  describes  how  the  contractor  will  meet  its  obligations;  h)  providing  suitable \nenvironmental  and  health  and  safety  training  to  employees;  and  i)  other  responsibilities  as \ndesignated  by \nlocal  environment  and  social  division.  The  construction  contract \nenvironmental  requirements  should  be  part  of  the  subproject  tendering  documents  and \neventually  part  of  the  subproject  construction  contracts.  The  construction  contracts  will  be  the \nlegal documents for the LPMOs' management of environmental issues in the subprojects. \n\nthe \n\nF. \n\nMonitoring and Reporting \n\n11. \nEnvironmental  monitoring  will  be  undertaken  to:  provide  feedback  on  the  extent  and \nseverity of the environmental impacts against the predicted impacts, ensure that mitigations are \nbeing  appropriately  implemented,  and  assess  the  overall  effectiveness  of  the  project \nenvironmental protection measures. Two types of environmental monitoring will be undertaken: \ncompliance and inspection monitoring, and ambient monitoring. Compliance monitoring will be \nundertaken to ensure that the contractor is implementing the mitigation measures in compliance \nwith their contractual requirements and with the environmental regulations and standards of the \nPRC.  The  mitigation  compliance  inspections  will  be  carried  out  by  environmental  supervision \nengineers  and  construction  supervision  engineers  employed  by  a  qualified  and  accredited \ninspection  company  hired  by  the  PPMO.  The  subproject  EMPs  present  environmental \ncompliance  monitoring  programs,  which  should  be  incorporated  into  the  legal  agreement \nbetween the subproject LPMOs and inspection company.  \n\n12. \nAmbient monitoring supports compliance monitoring through assessing either the quality \nor extent of pollutant (effluent) generated or the quality of the receiving environment (air, water, \nand  noise).  The  objective  of  ambient  monitoring  is  to  provide  feedback  on  the  extent  and \nseverity  of  the  environmental  impacts  against  the  predicted  impacts,  assess  the  overall \neffectiveness  of  the  project  environmental  protection  measures,  and  ensure  that  relevant \nenvironmental standards of the PRC are being maintained. Ambient motoring will be carried out \nby  the  subproject  environmental  protection  bureaus,  either  through  their  environmental \nmonitoring  centers  or  through  their  own  environmental  monitoring  companies.  The  subproject \nEMPs  present  ambient  monitoring  programs,  which  should  be  incorporated  into  monitoring \nagreements  between  the  subproject  LPMOs  and  the  environmental  protection  bureaus.  The \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n59 \n\nExecuting  Agency  through  the  PPMO  will  undertake  compliance  monitoring  and  submit  a \nsemiannual report to ADB on the progress of implementation of subproject EMPs. \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 17 \n\nFINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES  \n \n\nA. \n\nAnalysis of the Project \n\n1. \n\nRationale for Public Intervention \n\n1. \nThe  Hunan  economy  is  growing  rapidly  and  the  urban  population  of  22  million  is \nprojected to increase by one third by 2010. Presently, 70% of Hunan Province's municipal and \ncounty-level  cities  are  located  in  the  middle  and  upper  reaches  of  the  Province's  river  basins \n(termed mountainous areas). Cities typically are located along the narrow bottom lands flanking \nmountain rivers and are exposed to the dangers of flash flooding and the consequent damage \nand loss of life. The frequency of floods, low levels of protection, and population growth in flood-\nprone areas has led to a rise in losses, costs, and disruption from floods. \n \n2. \nBecause  of  a  lack  of  investment  in  urban  flood  protection,  most  of  the  cities  in  the \nmountainous areas of the four river basins have very low flood protection standards, and some \npoor  counties  do  not  have  any  protection  at  all.  The  table  below  demonstrates  that,  while  the \nimpact of large floods has varied over the past 40 years, more recent floods like those in 1996 \nand  1998  have  multiplied  significantly  in  actual  value  terms  as  compared  with  the  1954  flood, \nwhich is still considered to be the worst flood event over the past 100 years.  \n \n \n\n  Table A17.1: Comparison of Costs for Large Floods in Hunan Province  \n\nYear \n\n1954 \n1983 \n1996 \n1998 \n1999 \n2002 \n\nInundated Area  \n(104 ha) \n57.3 \n31.0 \n           134.7 \n           124.9 \n             57.9 \n           137.2 \n\nha = hectare, CNY = yuan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n(actual year costs) \n\nCasualties \n\nEconomic Loss \n(CNY billion) \n21.0 \n  1.9 \n  5.6 \n10.0 \n  6.0 \n  1.5 \n\n2,339 \n286 \n744 \n616 \n125 \n156 \n\n \n2. \nPast flood-control and flood management investments have largely focused on the lower \nfloodplains of Hunan's rivers and the Dongting Lake area. Future economic losses will increase \nand development will be hindered as flood-prone areas in the upper reaches of provincial rivers \nbecome  more  densely  populated.  The  Hunan  provincial  government  (HnPG)  prioritizes \nincreasing flood protection to the mountainous river basins by providing improved flood-control \nengineering  measures  and  other  nonstructural  flood  forecast,  warning,  and  management \nmeasures. \n \n\n2. \n\nGoals of the Investment Plan \n\n3. \nThe  HnPG\u2019s  flood-control  plan  focuses  on  a  comprehensive  framework  for  flood \nmanagement  and  stipulates  medium-term  (over  the  next  5  years)  and  longer-term  flood \nprotection  targets  for  the  mountainous  rivers.  The  medium-term  targets  require  financing  and \ncapacity  building  of  local  governments.  National  and  provincial  governments  in  the  People's \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC)  are  shifting  their  attention  away  from  flood  control  and  more  toward \nflood  management.  Still,  nonstructural  aspects  of  Hunan's  flood  management  plan  are  in  a \nformative stage and plans for integrated flood management need further development. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 17 \n\n61 \n\n3. \n\nDesign of the Plan and ADB's Role \n\n4. \nIdentification  of  a  least-cost  plan  for  flood  management  has  not  yet  been  done  in  the \nPRC,  although  the  current  change  in  flood  management  strategy  probably  reflects  an  implicit \nassessment of alternatives to the flood-control-only approach. Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ncan  assist  HnPG  to  accelerate  the  implementation  of  its  plan,  including  (i)  flood  management \nmeasures, (ii) flood-control works, and (iii) capacity building and plan management. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Individual Subprojects \n\n1. \n\nIntroduction \n\n5. \nTo  appraise  the  financial  and  economic  impact  and  feasibility  of  the  Project's  activities \nand outputs, financial and economic analyses were carried out on the eight core subprojects. An \noverview of the general approach for the economic analysis is presented below and results are \npresented  for  each  of  the  eight  subprojects.  As  described  in  Section  III  of  the  main  text,  the \neight  subprojects  represent  the  range  of  physical,  social,  and  economic  conditions  that \ncharacterize the 35 candidate subprojects. Detailed results for individual subprojects are set out \nin  the  supplementary  appendixes  for  the  individual  subproject  feasibility  study  reports \n(Supplementary Appendix C). \n \n\n2. \n\nAssumptions \n\nFinancial prices used in the analysis were identified through review of the cost estimates \n6. \nmade by the provincial and local design institutes for the initial feasibility study reports, including \nestimates  of  unit  costs  and  estimated  quantities.  Identified  discrepancies  were  cross  checked \nwith the original estimates and verified with the estimates of the design institutes. The quantities \nwere similarly checked by the consultant team. To assess each subproject\u2019s contribution to the \nPRC  economy,  it  is  necessary  to  convert  financial  values  to  their  economic  equivalents. \nEconomic  valuations  exclude  transfers  from  one  part  of  the  economy  to  another  (i.e.,  taxes, \nduties,  and  subsidies)1  and  attempt  to  facilitate  the  comparison  of  project  benefits  and  real \nopportunity  costs  to  the  economy  by  translating  all  prices  into  a  common,  undistorted  footing. \nBasic assumptions used in the economic analysis include: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe use of a domestic price numeraire. \nCost estimates are based on price of April 2006.  \nThe  PRC  yuan  (CNY),  or  Renminbi,  is  the  unit  of  account.  The  exchange  rate \nused is CNY8.11 per US dollar.2 \nThe  economic  benefits  of  the  subprojects  are  estimated  to  be  equivalent  to  the \nannualized  economic  value  of  damages  avoided  through  implementation  of  the \nsubprojects. \nFor  non-traded  goods,  a  standard  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.09  and  a  shadow \nwage rate factor for unskilled labor of 0.90 are used. \nTransfer  payments  such  as  taxes,  duties,  and  subsidies  are  excluded  from  the \nestimation of economic values. \nAll costs that are incurred prior to loan appraisal are treated as sunk costs, and \ncosts expected to be incurred between loan appraisal and loan effectiveness are \ntreated as year 1-costs. \n\n                                                 \n1   National level taxes and duties are excluded from the cost estimates because it is anticipated that the subprojects \nwill be exempt from these due to their strategic importance. However, local taxes on purchases of equipment and \nvehicles, as well as land taxes as a part of resettlement costs, are included. \n\n2 The impact of the revaluation of the CNY on the project costs was calculated and has been found to be minimal. \nTherefore,  the  cost  estimates  which  are  in  the  PRC  Foreign  Capital  Utilisation  Plan  have  been  retained,  in  the \ninterest of consistency. \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 17 \n\n(viii)  The  economic  value  of  incremental  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  is \nestimated  to  be  5%  of  the  incremental  costs  of  civil  works,  equipment,  and \nvehicles, including physical contingencies. \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n7. \nUrban  flood-control  works  are  financed  by  municipalities/counties  mainly  through  two \nsources: (i) collection from the Flood Control Security Fund,3 and (ii) a prescribed portion of the \ncollection of the Urban Maintenance and Construction Tax.4 In most of the cities/counties, 15% \nof the Urban Maintenance and Construction Tax is earmarked for flood-control works. The funds \nfrom  these  two  sources  are  used  to  finance  construction  of  flood-control  projects and  O&M  of \ncompleted  works.  Other  sources  for  financing  flood-control  works  include  land  sales  and \nexploitation,  contributions  from  project  beneficiaries,5  and,  if  needed,  incremental  budgetary \nallocation from local governments.   \n \n8. \nFiscal  affordability  of  the  core  subprojects  by  municipalities/counties  is  assessed  by \ncomparing  annual  collections  from  identified  financing  sources  with  the  annual  counterpart \nfunds required for (i) capital expenditures during project implementation, and (ii) recurrent costs \nfor O&M and debt services during the operational life of the project facilities. Annual O&M costs \nare  estimated  following  relevant  domestic  standards  and  regulations.  Interest  and  principal \nrepayments for the ADB loan are estimated based on a grace period of 6 years and a maturity \nof 20 years. Table A.17.2 shows the results. \n \n\nTable A17.2 : Fiscal Affordability Analysis \n\n(CNY million, 2004 prices) \n\nImplementation Period \n\nOperation Period \n\nWorks \nPeriod \n(months)\n\nAnnual \nCounterpart \nFunds \nRequired \n\nAffordability\n\nDebt \nService\n\nO&M \nCost \n\nAnnual \nCapital \nRequired \n\nAffordability\n\nLocal \nAuthority \n\nIdentified \nAnnual \nFunds \nAvailable \n\nCapital \nCosts to \nbe \nFinanced \nLocally \n(b) \n \n\n(f) \n2.66  \n\n(g) \n3.91 \n\n(h)=(f)+(g) \n6.57  \n\n(i)=(a)/(h) \n\n   \n\n(a)  \n3.40  \n\n(c) \n \n\n(d)=(b)/(c)*12 (e)=(a)/(d) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.59 \n\n52% \n\n12% \n\n18% \n\n6.00  \n\n2.90  \n\n1.22  \n\n22.38  \n\n15.95  \n\n27.79  \n\nXinhua \nCounty \nChenxi \nCounty \nSangzhi \nCounty \n30.00  \nLoudi City \nLeiyang City \n8.90  \nWugang City  13.30  \nHuaihua City  25.70  \n40.00  \nYongzhou \nCity \nCNY = yuan, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nNotes: At appraisal, estimated annual funds available did not include project budget allocations from 2006 onwards; \ntherefore, these estimates were conservative. \nSource: (a), (c), and (g) are from DFR. \n\n8.13   12.42 \n1.99 \n1.40  \n3.17 \n2.33  \n7.07 \n4.73  \n8.16 \n5.77  \n\n20.55  \n3.39  \n5.50  \n11.80  \n13.93  \n\n90.41  \n19.93  \n22.93  \n35.14  \n42.52  \n\n117% \n146% \n263% \n242% \n218% \n\n27% \n33% \n45% \n58% \n73% \n\n103% \n\n287% \n\n5.14  \n\n2.81  \n\n2.07  \n\n94% \n\n3.07 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n3 According to Provisions on Raising a Flood Control Security Fund for Hunan Province, issued by HnPG (31 August \n1994),  businesses  must  pay  0.08%  to  0.2%  of  the  sales/revenues  to  the  Flood  Control  Security  Fund.  For \ninsurance  companies,  the  Flood  Control  Security  Fund  is  levied  at  1%  of  annual  property  insurance  premiums. \nFlood Control Security Fund collections are allocated at 10% to the Province and 90% to cities/counties. \n\n4 The  tax  is  levied  on  all  enterprises  and  individuals  that  pay  value-added  taxes,  business  taxes,  and  consumption \n\ntaxes on the basis of 7%, 5%, and 1%, respectively, of the collection of the three taxes. \n\n5 Contributions can be through the Urban Maintenance and Construction Tax, or in-kind or labor contributions. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 17 \n\n63 \n\nThe  analysis  indicates  that,  based  on  identified  funds  during  project  preparation  (i.e., \n9. \nexcluding new budget appropriations and allocations), the Yongzhou subproject has acceptable \naffordability  indicators  for  subproject  implementation.  Indicators  for  the  Sangzhi,  Leiyang, \nHuaihua,  Wugang,  and Loudi  subprojects  demonstrate  that these  local authorities will  have  to \nmobilize substantially more financial resources for subproject implementation. The Xinhua and \nChenxi subprojects have the lowest affordability indicators, with available funds accounting for \nless  than  25%  of  the  annual  capital  required  for  subproject  implementation.  All  subprojects \nexcept  Xinhua  will  have  sufficient  funds  available  for  O&M  costs  and  debt  service  during  the \noperation period. Xinhua may have difficulty meeting this ongoing capital demand. \n \n10. \nThe fiscal analysis conservatively excludes other possible financing sources, which are \nnot quantifiable at this stage. For several reasons, it is expected that the needed funds will be \nrealized. First, all subprojects are located in flood-prone areas and local authorities have much \nincentive  to  improve  their  flood-control  works.  The  flood-control  works  established  under  the \nProject  will  prevent  flood-induced  physical  and  social  damages  and  protect  the  lives  and \nproperty  of \nthe \nmunicipalities/counties  will  attract  more  domestic  and  foreign  investment.  Thirty-four  of  the  35 \nsubprojects have submitted commitment letters cosigned by the mayor and director of the local \nfinance  bureau  to  the  Hunan  Provincial  Finance  Department.  Priority  will  be  given  to  flood-\ncontrol  works  when  the  identified  funds  are  insufficient  to  satisfy  the  demand  for  counterpart \nfunds.  Second,  the  improved  flood  facilities  resulting  from  the  Project  will  help  residential, \ncommercial,  and  industrial  development  in  the  project  area,  providing  an  expanding  base  for \nFlood  Control  Security  Fund  and  Urban  Maintenance  and  Construction  Tax  collections.  Third, \nfiscal  revenue  of  subproject  municipalities  and  counties  will  also  grow  in  line  with  economic \ndevelopment,  providing  even  more  mobility  for  the  local  authorities  to  finance  the  project. \nFourth,  a  social  survey  conducted  under  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  has \nindicated residents\u2019 willingness to pay for flood protection measures. \n \n\ninfrastructure  conditions  of \n\nimproved  security  and \n\nresidents.  The \n\n4. \n\nSubproject Economic Rate of Return Analysis \n\n11. \nThe cost components for each of the subprojects are limited to the costs of flood-control \ninfrastructure, flood management (nonstructural costs), and local subproject management. The \ncost of provincial-level project management, which accounts for about 1% of project base costs, \nis  not  included.  The  eight  core  subprojects  are  located  throughout  Hunan  Province  and  are \ndesigned  both  to  construct  new  flood  protection  infrastructure  and  to  upgrade  existing \ninfrastructure to provide the level of protection stipulated for each city. Since the subprojects are \nconcentrated  in  urban  areas,  the  main  benefits  will  accrue  to  urban  infrastructure,  including \nstate-owned  and  private  factories,  houses,  and  public  infrastructure.  Benefits  will  include \nsignificant reductions production and inventory losses. Agricultural benefits are relatively minor \nand mainly relate to rice and vegetable crops. \n \n12. \nThe principle of reverse rate of return analysis is applied to the EIRR for the eight core \nsubprojects.6 For the EIRR analysis, benefits and costs were first estimated in financial values \nand  then  converted  to  economic  values.  The  benefits  from  subproject  implementation  are \nassessed  as  the  increased  protection  that  will  be  provided  by  the  proposed  investments,  as \n\n                                                 \n6  The  technique,  a  contingent  type  analysis,  is  used  in  other  public  service  projects  and  non-revenue-generating \nprojects whose scope includes social objectives and financing of public services or infrastructure. The method can \nbe  used  to  justify  flood  management  subprojects  when  the  value  and  extent  of  flood  avoidance  are  clearly \nquantified,  and  conventional  benefit-cost  analysis  results  in  the  estimation  of  EIRR  that  equals  or  exceeds  the \nthreshold of 12%. Additional quantifiable and non-quantifiable benefits can further justify the economic viability, but \nno further attempt is needed to quantify these. Sensitivity analysis is not carried out as part of this method. \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 17 \n\ncompared  with  the  protection  offered  by  the  current,  'without-project'  situation.  The  current \nlevels  of  protection  vary  by  subproject,  and  even  within  individual  subprojects,  and  were \nindividually assessed. For the 'with-project' situation, the anticipated level of protection provided \nis  for  a  20-year-return  period  flood  for  county-level  cities,  and  a  50-year-return  period  for \nmunicipal-level  cities.  Some  authorities  also  anticipated  improved  protection  against  localized \ninundation (waterlogging); this is included as necessary in the analysis.  \n \n13. \nOnly  direct  and  quantifiable  benefits  were  included  in  this  analysis,  including  benefits \nfrom  nonstructural  measures  (which  extend  well  beyond  project  boundaries).  However,  there \nare  significant  additional  indirect  and  unquantifiable  benefits  that  are  not  included  in  the \nanalysis.  For  example,  the  economic  benefit  estimates  exclude  the  avoidance  of  injuries, \nhospitalizations, deaths, and unneeded mobilization of flood-fighting crews. The estimates also \nexclude the reduced need for large-scale emergency evacuations necessitated by major floods; \nreduced  losses  stemming  from  disruption  of  communications  and  transportation  to  areas \nadjacent  to  flood-prone  zones;  and  reduced  losses  of  household  assets,  livestock,  and  farm \nmachinery.  Significant  unquantifiable  benefits  are  also  envisaged  from  major  improvements  to \nthe city environment, including the creation of recreational areas along river embankments. \n \n\nDistribution and Poverty Impact \n\n5. \nThe  expected  impact  of  the  Project  on  poverty  was  analyzed  in  a  qualitative  manner.7 \n14. \nThe  distribution  of  project  impacts  among  the  three  main  groups\u2014poor,  non-poor,  and  the \nGovernment\u2014were  also  analyzed  qualitatively.  The  purpose  of  the  distribution  and  poverty \nimpact analysis is to inform decision makers about the potential impact of the Project, to specify \nthe types of parameters that should be monitored to quantify the impact of the Project, and to \nmitigate  the  negative  effects  and/or  enhance  the  positive  effects  of  the  Project.  Monitoring \nparameters  include  those  needed  to  identify  unexpected  impacts  and  potential  structural \nconstraints that could hinder the access of certain groups, such as the poor, to project benefits.  \nPotential  project  impacts  are  expected  to  affect  both  poor  and  non-poor  communities  and \npeople, and are summarized in Table A17.3 (see Supplementary Appendix C for the summary \nproject impact assessment matrix). Possible positive and negative impacts on the provincial and \nlocal governments are also included. \n \n15. \nBaseline  data  shows  that  urban  and  rural  communities  have  their  own  distinct \ncharacteristics. While rural poverty incidence in the project-protected areas (3.7%) is lower than \nthe  average  in  the  project  counties  (4.1%),  the  reverse  situation  is  true  for  urban  poverty \nincidence  (urban  poverty  incidence  in  the  project-protected  areas\u201415.7%\u2014is  actually  higher \nthan  the  average  in  the  project  counties\u201413.4%).  It  is  expected  that  75%  of  the  project \nbeneficiaries will be in urban areas. Two conclusions drawn from these statistics are as follows. \nFirst, the assumption that there would be a higher incidence of poverty in rural areas compared \nwith urban centers does not hold true in this case; urban poverty incidence is much higher than \nrural  poverty  incidence,  and  the  situation  seems  to  be  exacerbated  in  project-protected  urban \nareas. Second, the impact of the Project on the poor can potentially be significant, even if the \nProject  is  not  designed  to  directly  implement  poverty  reduction  measures.  This,  however, \ndepends on the following assumptions: (i) the 75% of project beneficiaries living in urban areas \nwill include a proportionate percentage of the poor (preliminary studies estimate around 9% of \nthe  total  project  beneficiaries  qualify  as  poor),  and  (ii)  there  will  be  no  structural  constraints \nobstructing the poor from benefiting in full from the Project. \n \n                                                 \n7 Given that this is a sector project supporting an accepted sector plan, no project-wide quantitative economic internal \n\nrate of return analysis has been carried out. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 17 \n\n65 \n\nThe  expected  impacts  summarized  in  Table  A17.3  should  be  monitored  using  the \n16. \nindicators included in the project design and monitoring framework. This will reduce duplication \nin  collecting  baseline  data  and  ensure  that  the  type  of  data  needed  to  update  the  distribution \nand poverty impact analysis will be better integrated into the Project Performance Management \nSystem  (PPMS)  and  project  monitoring  activities.  The  project  monitoring  system  being \ndeveloped  is  intended  to  continuously  inform  the  distribution  and  poverty  impact  analysis  by \ncapturing the unexpected effects, both positive and negative, of the Project. The monitoring data \nshould be disaggregated by gender when this adds value to understanding the Project impacts \nor  considering  the  need  for  gender-specific  mitigation  measures.

The emphasis on the monitoring of implementation also \nextends  to  the  monitoring  and  mitigation  of  the  risks  identified  in  the  project  design  and \nmonitoring framework (PDMF).  \n \n2. \nThere  is  scope  to  use  the  inbuilt  flexibility  of  a  sector  loan  as  an  opportunity  to  apply \nadaptive  management  approaches.  Feedback  and  analysis  of  lessons  learned  (for  example, \nfrom the core subprojects which start up in the first year of the Project) need to be an integral \npart of project management. While observations and recommendations from external reviewers \nare  necessary,  it  is  equally  essential  to  ensure  that  internal  and  external  feedback  is  used  by \nproject  management  to  improve  the  quality  and  safeguard  compliance  of  the  subsequent \nsubproject implementation.  \n \nB. \n \nThe monitoring system will, to the extent possible, be based on the People's Republic of \n3. \nChina's (PRC)  management and reporting guidelines for similar projects and subprojects. The \nmonitoring  system  will  also  contribute  to  more  effective  project  management  by:  providing \nadequate  practical  and  operational  guidance  on  monitoring  project  performance  and \nimplementation  in  areas  not  covered  by  the  PDMF;  ensuring  that  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  safeguards  on  resettlement,  ethnic  minorities,  and  environment  management  are \ncomplied  with;  capturing  unintended  negative  or  positive  impacts  of  the  Project  to  the  extent \npossible; and complementing the annual plan-based management systems, which include work-\nplanning, activity-tracking, and tracking of financial, construction, and staff management. \n \nKey  principles1  used  in  developing  the  monitoring  system  include:  (i)  the  monitoring \n4. \nsystem  is  to  be  based  on  the  agreed  PDMF,  and  (ii)  baseline  information,  depending  on \nrelevance and availability, could be based on existing data, first measurement after project start-\nup, or a rolling baseline for subprojects, where data is collected only when the subproject starts \nup.  A  sample  matrix  of  the  monitoring  system  for  resettlement  under  the  Project  illustrates  a \nmonitoring and management approach for the output indicator corresponding to resettlement in \nthe PDMF. \n\n                                                 \n1 Based on Gujit, I. and J.
