It will also benefit all others who need \nto  acquire  knowledge  more  directly  related  to  employment  in  the  private \nsector,  since  the  public  service  is  contracting  rapidly.  Severe  budget \nconstraints  are  curtailing  the  growth  of  the  public  education  system, \nwhereas  private  postsecondary  institutions  (PPSIs)  have  a  more  narrow \nrange of offerings and lack the physical capability to significantly increase \nenrollment  for  traditional  face-to-face  instruction.  Consequently,  it  is \nproblematical,  under  the  actual  structure,  to  provide  enough  meaningful \nlearning  opportunities  for  the  ever-growing  number  of  secondary  school \ngraduates  who  qualify  for  further  education.  The  Project  will  support \ndistance education technology to increase access to diploma and degree \nprograms, especially among the rural educated poor. Institutional support \nwill  go  to  the  (i)  Distance  Education  Partnership Program (DEPP), which \nprovides on-line self-study; (ii) public and private postsecondary institutes; \nand (iii) the Open University of Sri Lanka (OUSL).   \n \nSri Lanka, like many other developing economies, has a pressing need to \nincrease  skill  levels  but  faces  great  difficulty  in  providing  educated  labor \nand  modern  skills  due  to  market  failures  that  yield  poor  access  to \npostsecondary  education.  The  whole  economy  has  thus  adjusted  to  low \nskill  levels  as  wages  have  stagnated  and  the  educated  poor  cannot \nupgrade their only real asset?education. Postsecondary education in Sri \nLanka  also  suffers  from  inefficiencies.  Less  than  3%  of  the  relevant  age \ngroup  is  enrolled,  compared  with  8%  in  South  Asia  as  a  whole,  while \nabout 25% percent of the age cohort qualifies for entry. Tertiary education \nresources are not allocated according to performance criteria, resulting in \nlittle  incentive  to  increase  enrollment  or  enhance  performance.  In  many \ncases, the curriculum is not in line with economic and social requirements, \nleading  to  a  continuing  decline  in  educational  relevance,  access, \nefficiency, and financing. Addressing these sector constraints will require \nthat  encourage  public-private \n(i) \npartnerships to increase quality, relevance, and access to postsecondary \neducation; (ii) distance education to promote greater flexibility at low cost \nfor  students  outside  Colombo  to  gain  access  to  quality  programs;  (iii) \naccreditation  and  standard  setting  within  a  national  accreditation  board; \n(iv) program expansion in high-demand fields such as business, computer \nscience,  foreign  languages,  and  engineering;  and  (v)  introduction  of  user \nfees  to  offset  the  cost  of  on-line study. The Government supports these \npolicies,  and  the  Project  will  help  implement  them  by  addressing  market \nfailures \nfor  distance  education  and  public-private \npartnerships. \n\ninformation  awareness  campaigns \n\nthrough  support \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nObjectives and \nScope \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\nFinancing Plan \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization  \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date  \n\n \n\nThe  Project  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  human  resource  strategy  laid \nout in three recent documents: (i)  The Future  - Regaining Sri Lanka,  (ii) \nThe Draft National Employment Policy for Sri Lanka, and (iii) e-Sri Lanka: \nAn ICT Development Roadmap.  The  Project  will  help  the  Government  to \nimplement  these  strategies  by  modernizing  the  postsecondary  education \nsystem, especially through the introduction of distance education and the \npromotion  of  public-private  partnerships  to  reduce  pressure  on  public \nsector  enrollment.  The  Project  will  promote  economic  growth  and  social \ncohesion,  including  among  plantation  workers  and  social  conflict  areas. \nThe  Project  aims  to  boost  enrolment,  quality,  and  relevance  of  learning \nthrough  distance  education  that  can  facilitate  on  line  learning  for  the \n165,000 external degree students of traditional universities, qualified PPSI \ntraining programs offered by at least 15 recognized private institutions with \nover 40,000 clients, conventional  public institutions that wish to migrate to \nmixed-mode  environment,  and  some  20,000  learners  attending  the  26 \nOUSL campuses across the country. The combined capacity of the PPSIs, \nSri  Lanka  Institutes  of  Advanced  Technical  Education  (SLIATE),  and \nOUSL  will  effectively  double  over  the  next  5  years.  Thus,  an  additional \n50,000 learners will have access to a full range of quality courses of study \nthrough  the  national  network  of  telecenters  and  affiliated  facilities.  In \naddition,  the  Project  will  support  the  key  thrusts  of  government  policy  to \nmake Sri Lanka computer literate (e-Sri Lanka), and it will stimulate value-\nadded  services  such  as  electronic  government  (e-government),  small \nbusiness  connectivity,  and  community  development.  This \ninitiative \ncomplements  World  Bank-  and  ongoing  ADB-funded  projects  aimed  at \ntraining  the  educated  unemployed  so  that  they  will  acquire  employment-\nrelated  qualifications  by  interlacing  distance  education,  public-private \npartnerships, and open university study.   \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $60  million  equivalent,  including \nphysical  and  price  contingencies,  taxes  and  duties,  and  service  charge; \n$24  million  (40%)  comprises  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  and $36 million \nequivalent (60%), the local currency cost.  \n  \n \n \nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nBeneficiaries \n\nForeign \nExchange  Currency  Total  Percent \n\n($ million) \n \n\nLocal \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n45 \n10 \n5 \n60 \n\n75 \n17 \n8 \n100 \n\n24 \n0 \n0 \n24 \n\n21 \n10 \n5 \n36 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIt  is  proposed  that  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provide  a  loan  in \nvarious  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR33,005,000  ($45  million  equivalent) \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.

The Project \nwill  upgrade  existing  amenities  and  establish  new  facilities  on  selected \ncampuses of OUSL. Goods and services will be procured in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil  works  contracts  above  $2 \nmillion  will  follow  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB),  while  those  $2 \nmillion  or  less  will  follow  local  competitive  bidding.  Procurement  of \nequipment  above  $500,000  will  follow  ICB,  while  contracts  valued \n$500,000  or  less  will  follow  international  shopping.  Furniture,  learning \nmaterials,  and  software  costing  less  than  $100,000  per  item  may  be \nprocured by direct purchase.  \n \nThe  Project  will  require  703  person-months  of  consulting  services, \nconsisting  of  203  person-months  of  international  and  500  person-months \nof  domestic  consultants.  Separate  packages  will  be  prepared  for \nconsultants  working  under  OUSL  and  DEPP.  MTET  will  select  individual \nconsultants  to  conduct  policy  studies.  All  consultants  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance  with  ADB's Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. Quality- and cost-based selection procedures will be used to \nselect  consultants  to  be  engaged  through  a  consulting  firm.  A  select \nnumber  of  short-term  domestic  consultants  for  the  PMO,  OUSL,  and \nDEPP may be engaged individually. \n \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  the  postsecondary  education system outside \nthe  conventional  university  system  by  increasing  enrollment  through \ngreater \nlearning \ninternal  efficiency,  application  of  new  distance \ntechnologies,  and  promotion  of  public-private  partnerships  to  share  all \nservices  and  infrastructure  provided  under  the  Project.  The  Project  will \nsupport  World  Bank  and  ADB  initiatives  in  postsecondary  education  and \ntraining.  It  will  provide  the  vital  distance  education  network  for  the  future \nmultimedia  university,  will  foster  partnerships  between  public  and private \ninstitutions  to  share  facilities,  and  will  make  relevant  and  topical  course \nmaterials  and  knowledge  directly  accessible  to  at  least  200,000  students \nwithin  5  years.  Teachers  and  administrators  at  OUSL  and  at  public  and \nprivate educational institutes will have opportunities for staff development, \nand  about  150  public  and  private  institutions,  including  OUSL  and  its  26 \nregional  centers,  will  benefit  from  access  to  funds  to  provide  local  in-\nservice  training  and  curriculum  development  for  academic  programs  on-\nline. \n \n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\nto \n\ninfrastructure \n\nincrease  access  by \n\nThe Project is not subject to major technical or financial risks.

The \nGovernment  is  scheduled  to  liberalize  telecommunications  by  the  end  of \n2003;  connection  rates  will  fall  automatically  as  competition  and  capacity \nincrease. e-Sri Lanka: An ICT Development Roadmap has been finalized \nand will be coordinated by the Ministry of Economic Reform, Science and \nTechnology  through  an  ICT  agency  that  has  recently  been  created,  and \nthe  policy  is  supported  by  the  World  Bank  within  its  effort  to  strengthen \ncapacity to carry out the economic reform agenda. The ICT Roadmap will \nhelp  MTET  to  develop  specific  policies  related  to  the  national  ICT  policy \nfor  education,  which  will  shortly  lead  to  telecommunications  tariff \nreductions  for  educational  institutions  using  the  Internet.  The  Project  will \nrequire  many  international  consultants  to  configure,  install,  and  operate \nthe DEPP; to transfer technical knowledge to local experts; and to develop \noperating policies, procedures, and performance monitoring mechanisms. \nAt  present,  qualified  technical  expertise  to  develop  and  place  course \nmaterials on the web for easy student on-line access is very scarce. The \ne-SRI  Lanka  Roadmap  includes  a  program  on  ICT  human  resource \ndevelopment  that  seeks  to  mainstream  ICT  technology  and  professional \nstaff training for broad-based tertiary education service delivery across the \ncountry.  The  Project  will  provide  initial  resources  for  computer  hardware, \nsoftware,  and  staff  development  inputs  under  private  sector  auspices  to \nstart up a distance education network. These efforts will be reinforced by \ncurrent plans to establish multimedia university courses in selected public \nuniversities  that  will  provide  the  expertise  both  to  operate  DEPP  and  to \nsupport  a  proposed  multi-media  university  (MMU).  The  project\u2019s  short-\nterm  goals  will  help  establish  on-line  distance  education,  support  public-\nprivate  sharing  of  resources,  and  establish  national  accreditation \nstandards for institutes and academic courses.    \n\n \n\nA small financial risk pertains to OUSL and DEPP financial sustainability, \nas recurrent costs after the Project are expected to average as little as $1 \nmillion per year. OUSL is the only public postsecondary education institute \nin  Sri  Lanka  that  is  allowed  to  charge  fees.  Project  resources  will  allow \nOUSL to provide the quality necessary to attract new students and retain \nexisting  ones  who  might  otherwise  drop  out  if  they  cannot  access \nsufficient  equipment,  materials,  and  instruction,  especially  in  regional \ncampuses.  Increasing  fees  for  improved  quality  and  enrolling  more \nstudents will allow OUSL to recover its recurrent costs for all its nonsalary \nand incremental contract staff required under the Project. Beneficiary fees \nwill  help  make  OUSL  sustainable,  although  government  grants  for  salary \nsupport  to  permanent  staff  will  still  be  required.  DEPP  is  expected  to  be \nentirely self-financing by the fifth year of the project.  \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Distance  Education  Modernization \nProject (Appendix 1). \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nPast  failure  to  ensure  an  adequate  supply  of  relevant  skills  has  forced  the  economy  to \nadjust to low skill levels, thus perpetuating poverty and low economic growth. Sri Lanka needs \nto  modernize  its  economy  and  allow  the  educated  workforce  to  grow.  The  rate  of  return  to \npostsecondary education is relatively high (16-19%), yet unemployment among educated youth \nis  also  high  (13%  compared  with  8%  nationwide),  precluding  dynamic  economic  growth  and \nindicating that the labor market is not functioning effectively. For the economy to function well, it \nneeds  macroeconomic  stability,  openness  to  competition,  and  labor  market  growth  through \nhuman  capital  formation  for  all  citizens.  Sri  Lanka  has  made  some  progress  in  these  areas. \nSince  the  shift  to  an  open  economy  started  around  1977,  the  country  has  experienced  over \n5.0% growth in gross domestic product (GDP) annually, unemployment declined from 20.0% to \n8.0%, the population rate stabilized at 1.1% per annum, and inflation has averaged about 7.9% \neach year. Consumption and economic poverty have lessened to a little over 26%, while rural \npoverty  remains  problematic.  Economic  growth  with  low  population  growth  and  inflation  has \nallowed  the  economy  to  grow  fast  enough  to  begin  rural  transformation,  expand  small  and \nmedium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs),  and  reduce  the  size  of  the  public  sector.  This  structural \nchange  has  started  a  shift  from  low  value-added  agricultural  production  to  high-value \nmanufacturing and services, resulting in a gradual increase in the education and income level. \nSri Lanka is modernizing and diversifying its economy1 despite the Asian crisis and civil war that \nuntil recently consumed 2% of GDP each year. Continued sustainable economic growth is likely \nif  the  civil  conflict  abates;  the  urban-rural  income  gap  narrows;  and  the  cost  of  borrowing \ndeclines, offering financial relief to SMEs.  \n \nContinuing structural economic change will depend on private sector growth and a shift \n3. \nto  manufacturing  and  services.  At  the  same  time,  the  supply  of  educated  labor  is  artificially \nconstrained  by  a  public  sector-dominated  education  system  that  is  unresponsive  to  the \nchanging needs of the  economy.  Only  12%  of  the  labor  force  have  a  high-school degree or \nabove; only 2% of this group have a university degree, because only 3% of qualified secondary-\nschool graduates gain admission to university. For the economy to become globally competitive, \nthese numbers need to double over the next 10 years. For historical reasons, education supply \nhas  been  artificially  constrained  and  narrowly  focused  on  a  few  professions  and  a  one-to-one \nmatching of public sector education placement to public sector employment openings when the \neconomy  was  dominated  by  government  service.  Human  resource  planning  never  addressed \nself-  or  private  sector  employment,  leading  to  skill  mismatch  and  labor  shortage.  At  the  same \ntime,  the  social  demand  for  postsecondary  education  continues,  with  25%  of  the  relevant  age \ncohort meeting university entrance requirements but only 3% gaining entrance to conventional \nuniversities.  \n \n4. \nThe  Government  is  keen  to  expand  enrollment  capacity  in  postsecondary  education  to \nmeet  rising  social  demand:  200,000  secondary-school  graduates  compete  for  about  50,000 \nplaces  each  year.  However,  the  government  cannot  do  so  without  increasing  budgets  or \n\n                                                 \n1   The Government came to power in December 2001 and is committed to the peace process and an open economy. \n\n\f2\n\n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\ncharging  fees  in  conventional  universities;  neither  measure  is  likely  at  present.  With  limited \nbudget growth over the past 10 years, postsecondary education enrollment has stagnated, and \nquality  has  not  kept  pace  with  innovations  in  knowledge  and  new  technologies  elsewhere. \nDropout  reduction  and  additional  intake  could  make  postsecondary  school  operations \nsignificantly  more  efficient.  Introducing  new  technologies  such  as  distance  learning  could  also \nincrease enrollment, with only initial capital inputs to develop the infrastructure. Encouragement \nof  public-private  partnerships  to  employ  distance  education  could  lead  to  cost  sharing \nassociated with expanded capacity to meet social demand without increasing investments in the \npublic system. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nPostsecondary education in Sri Lanka suffers from many problems. Less than 3% of the \nuniversity  age  group  is  enrolled  in  public  universities  (private  postsecondary  institutes  are  not \naccredited  by  the  government)  compared  with  8%  for  South  Asia  as  a  whole,  and  20%  for \nThailand  and  34%  for  Singapore  \u2013  two  countries  that  Sri  Lanka  would  like  to  emulate. \nInstitutional  resources  in  tertiary  education  are  not  allocated  according  to  performance,  giving \nuniversities  little  incentive  to  increase  enrollment  or  enhance  results.  The  relatively  low  quality \nand  quantity  of  tertiary  education  output  reflects  the  sector\u2019s  continuing  decline  in  quality  and \nthe relevance of its programs, restricted access, low efficiency, underfinancing, and excessive \nstate  control  over  admissions  and  curricula.  Because  tertiary  education  is  free,  students and \ntheir parents have little interest in reforms. Traditionally, graduates have been content to queue \nfor  years  for  public  sector  jobs.  All  these  problems  are  being  addressed  by  the  government \nreforms  in  tertiary  education,  which  provide  for  amended  policies  to  (i)  create  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  private  sector  participation;  (ii)  establish  performance-based  educational \naccreditation  standards,  especially  in  high-demand  fields  such  as  business,  management, \ncomputer  science,  engineering,  economics,  and  natural  sciences;  (iii)  replace  line-item with \nperformance-based budgeting; and (iv) modernize educational pedagogy through new learning \ntechnologies such as distance education supported by multimedia university courses in selected \nuniversities (Appendix 2). \n \n6. \nNew  learning  technologies  such  as  distance  learning  can  deliver  excellent  academic \nprograms to a wide audience that is currently excluded from the conventional system (Appendix \n3).  There  is  no  national  delivery  system  for  distance  learning,  and  the  core  skills  needed  to \ndevelop materials and to train teachers to operate in a learner-centered environment are still in \nearly  infancy,  as  are  the  hardware  and  software  for  web-based  learning  with  onlineon-line \ntutorial support. The best approach to establish a National Distance Education Network (NDEN) \nmay  be  to  link  hardware  and  specialized  software  and  services  to  the  establishment  of  a \ntechnically competent business enterprise. This business enterprise labeled Distance Education \nPartnership Program (DEPP) can offer curriculum and training expertise to create, migrate, and \nupgrade  existing  courseware  to  the  web  and  to  deliver  knowledge  and  learner  support  to  a \nextensive variety of conduits nationwide. Multimedia learning centers can be loc ated in schools, \nin  Internet  cafes,  and  in  many  other  institutions,  depending  on  the  need  for  access  to  the \ndistance learning network around the country. The services should be made available to public \nand  private  institutions  on  a  cost-shared  basis  to  engender  competition,  raise  academic \nstandards, and promote linkages among institutions.   \n \n7. \nThis  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  approach  to  distance  education \nboosts  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  efforts  to  develop  ICT  multimedia  university  programs  on \nleading  universities,  where  course  offerings  provide  curriculum \nseveral  campuses  of \ndevelopment, training, and marketing skills for on-line learning. Currently, OUSL has the basic \nregional infrastructure for distance education outreach but lacks capacity, materials, and skills to \nintroduce  distance  learning.  In  the  context  of  the  Government\u2019s  determination  to  favor  the \n\n \n\n\f3\n\nprivate sector as a key instrument in education, the DEPP partnership model enlists the private \nsector to manage and operate a distance education network within a framework of well-defined \npolicies, guidelines, and jointly agreed upon outputs of quality and quantity. Given appropriate \nmonitoring mechanisms, this strategy represents a practical approach to professionally develop \ndistance  education  programs  and  learning  exchanges  for  new  and  ongoing  courses,  including \nthose  at  OUSL,  other  public  institutions  such  as  Sri  Lanka  Institute  of  Advanced  Technical \nEducation (SLIATE), and for private postsecondary institutes. In 5 years, when professional staff \nare  readily  available  in  Sri  Lanka,  and  when  distance  education  programs  are  up  and  running \non-line for a wide range of postsecondary institutions, it may be possible to either fully privatize \nthe  DEPP,  or  integrate  it  within  OUSL  or  some  other  public  or  private  institution.  Under  the \nWorld  Bank  Tertiary  Education  Project,  support  for  ICT  programs  at  public  universities  will  be \nencouraged  to  provide  the  foundation  for  ICT  courses  that  will  eventually  lead  to  mixed  mode \nand multimedia universities. Since the need is great and continues to expand, the government \nwill incubate several sustainable small-scale programs in different regions of the country rather \nthan aim for one single large multimedia university. The very nature of a multimedia university \nimplies connectivity that can link campuses easily.   \n \nThe  Project  supports  the  Government\u2019s  policies  by  increasing  access  to  quality \n8. \nprograms at low cost for those excluded from conventional universities (Appendix 4). OUSL was \nconstituted  in  1980  under  the  Universities  Act  No.  16  of  1978  and  OUSL  Ordinance  No.  1  of \n1989.  OUSL  enrolls  about  10,000  students  annually  in  mostly  certificate,  diploma,  and  degree \nprograms  that  provide  a  progressive  ladder  of  educational  opportunities through nontraditional \nteaching  methods.  OUSL  also  addresses  the  need  to  transfer  the  knowledge  and  skills \ncapabilities  required  in  secondary  education,  teacher  training,  social  services,  agricultural \nextension,  and  continuous  professional  development  of  workers  in  many  fields.  OUSL  has  a \nwide  network  of  26  existing  and  planned  campuses  nationwide  for  students  who  cannot  leave \ntheir  jobs  or  families  to  study  full-time  away  from  home.  The  rationale  for  a  public-supported \nOUSL  is  that  it  provides  public  goods,  especially  in  the  social  sectors,  and  contributes  to \neconomic  growth,  human  development,  and  poverty  reduction  by  providing  postsecondary \neducation in remote areas. OUSL enrollment peaked in 1998 and slowly fell as the quality and \nrelevance  of  the  programs  and  facilities  declined  due  to  budget  cut-backs.  To  reinvigorate \ngrowth,  OUSL  needs  to  upgrade  existing  faculties  on  regional  campuses  and  to  streamline \nadministrative  procedures,  including  student  admissions  and  tracking.  OUSL  has  several  key \nadvantages over the conventional education system. Its unit costs are only 20% of conventional \nuniversity  costs  on  average,  and  with  improvements  in  procedures  and  upgrading  of  facilities, \nenrollment can double over the next 8 years along with student completion rates. With a larger \nbudget from increased enrollment, OUSL will help increase the pool of educated labor and level \nof public services provided outside the capital. \n \n9. \nAnother  avenue  to  help  double  access  to  educational  opportunities  is  to  encourage \npublic  and  private  schools  to  share  common  resources  and  activities.  Government  policies  to \nbuild public-private partnerships include (i) public awareness campaigns to share information on \ncareer guidance and job information among students; (ii) transparent accreditation policies that \nlead  to  flexible  enrollment  admission,  accountability  for  monitoring  academic  standards, \naccreditation, and transfer across institutions; (iii) distance learning technologies to disseminate \nquality programs and information  around the country; (iv) foreign and local institutional twinning \narrangements; and (v) public funds for cost-sharing ventures with private institutions to increase \nenrollment and support the needy through scholarships. Of special interest is the Government\u2019s \nprovision  of  matching  grants  to  private  postsecondary  institutions  for  ICT  and  multimedia \nservices  that  allow  private  schools  to  migrate  academic  programs  on-line. The Government is \nwilling to provide matching grants to promote institutions to cover the high costs of borrowing for \nICT  and  multimedia  equipment  and  services  to  go  on-line.  The  matching  grant  also  supports \nstipends for needy students to attend private schools. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4\n\n \n\nGovernment Strategy and Policy \n\nC. \n \n10. \nThe  Government  that  took  office  in  December  2001  is  committed  to  modernize  the \neconomy  to  broaden  and  deepen  the  labor  market  through  a  flexible  education  system  with \nspecial  attention  to  minimizing  differences  across  regions,  especially  through  ICT  and  new \nlearning  technologies.2  Starting with  The Future  -  Regaining  Sri  Lanka framework released in \n2002,  the  Government  has  signaled  its  policy  agenda  to  stabilize  macro  policies,  financial \ninvestment, infrastructure development and productivity in key sectors and public sector reform. \nThe document sets the tone for reforms to support self-employment and encouragement of job \ncreation for SMEs while looking into education finance reform and public-private participation in \ntertiary  education.  The  draft  National  Employment  Policy  for  Sri  Lanka  also  sets  forth  the \nstrategy for modernizing the labor force. The policy stresses career guidance and employment \ninformation,  education,  and  training  for  lifelong  employability;  support  for  self-employment and \nSMEs;  and  cooperation  among  government,  employers,  and  employees  to  reduce  labor \nregulations and create investment incentives to encourage growth of SMEs. These policies and \npriorities  will  help  refocus  government  efforts  to  expand  jobs  outside  the  public  sector.  Along \nsimilar  lines,  the  Government\u2019s  poverty reduction strategy aims to give citizens the chance to \nparticipate  in  the  pro-poor  growth  process  by  enhancing  livelihoods,  increasing  incomes,  and \nensuring  access  to  essential  local  social  services.  Priorities  worked  out  with  aid  agencies  and \nnongovernment  organizations  will  (i)  create  opportunities  for  the  poor  to  benefit  from  higher \nproductivity  by  fostering  broad-based  rural  development,  competitive  industrialization,  and \nservice  sector  development;  (ii)  improve  market  access  by  linking  poor  regions  to  dynamic \nmarkets, including through telecommunications deregulations; (iii) raise productivity to broaden \nmarket  access  for  SMEs,  including  programs  to  liberalize  labor  regulations;  and  (iv)  increase \naccess to quality education for upward socioeconomic mobility. \n \n11. \nThe Government recently released its vision of Sri Lanka connected via ICT to provide \nthe  smooth  flow  of  knowledge  connectivity  throughout  the  country.  e-Sri  Lanka:  An  ICT \nDevelopment Roadmap offers a five-pronged program to (i) establish an agency to develop the \nICT  strategy  and  policy;  (ii)  develop  the  national  hardware  and  software  infrastructure  through \ntelecommunications  network  and  regulatory  policy;  (iii)  develop  ICT  human  resource  capacity \nthrough  qualified  professionals  to  use  ICT  for  broad-basing  tertiary  education  across  the \ncountry; (iv) develop e-government service delivery; and (v) use the e-government to leverage \neconomic and social development through access to internet, computer literacy, and telecenters \nto connect communities to the mass media. Specific education policies include (i) accreditation \nfor easy transfer of course credit across institutions, (ii) performance-based school assessment, \n(iii)  public-private  partnerships  and  link  programs  across  institutions,  and  (iv)  distance-learning \nprograms  to  provide  outreach  through  quality  on-line  academic  programs  to  working  rural \nstudents  who  cannot  leave  their  jobs  or  families  to  study  in  cities.  These  distance-learning \napproaches involve ICT and accompanying user fees. A list of policies is found in Appendix 5. \n \nD. \n \n 12. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) Country Strategy and Program Update (2002) and \nPoverty  Reduction  Strategy  in  Sri  Lanka3  highlight  poverty  reduction  and  emphasize  pro-poor \ninvestments  to  strengthen  public-private  partnerships.  In  education,  this  means  that  ADB  will \nsupport  reform  efforts  to  (i)  open  access  and  improve  quality,  particularly  in  rural  and  conflict \nareas;  (ii)  promote  social  cohesion  through  provision  of  educational  opportunities  nationwide \n\nFunding Agencies\u2019 Strategy in Education \n\n                                                 \n2   Government of Sri Lanka. 2002.

The ADB policy on \neducation  supports  efforts  in  postsecondary  and  tertiary  education,  where  millennium \ndevelopment  goals  already  have  been  substantially  achieved  to  improve  internal  and  external \nefficiency and equity. Priorities include providing course information, attitude change, and skills \nessential  for  sustainable  economic  growth,  with  emphasis  on  equity,  access,  quality,  capacity \nbuilding, resource mobilization, public-private partnerships, and new learning technologies. The \nProject includes subsidiary priorities: (i) reaching the poor; (ii) improving quality; (iii) increasing \nefficiency;  (iv)  mobilizing  resources;  (v)  collaboration  with  beneficiaries;  and  (vi)  supporting \ninnovation.  The  Project  supports  increasing  educational  opportunities  in  rural  areas  for  those \nunable  to  attend  formal  schools;  improving  quality  of  and  access  to  improved  academic \nprograms,  especially  on-line;  increasing  the  internal  efficiency  of  OUSL  and  the  Ministry  of \nTertiary  Education  and  Training  (MTET);  mobilizing  resources  outside  the  government  grant \nintroducing  distance-learning \nsystem;  collaborating  with  public-private \ntechnologies to raise standards.  \n \n13. \nADB  previously  supported  skill  development  for  junior  secondary-school  leavers  by \nproviding  wider  choices  in  vocational  and  technical  programs.4  ADB  provided  technical \nassistance  (TA)  to  improve  the  financing  of  social  sectors  (1995)  that  looked  at  trend  data \nshowing how the Government allocated and budgeted funds across the sectors. ADB provided \nTA to improve educational planning in 1998. The study provided valuable information in the form \nof  an  employment  survey  on  how  students  sought  employment  after  school.  The  study \nculminated in a policy agenda that recommended (i) expanding university education to qualified \nnonpublic  and  private  sector  institutions  through  rules  and  regulations  on  opening,  operating, \nand  closing  schools,  maintaining  standards,  and  fair  trade  practices  to  protect  students;  (ii) \nimproving  the  quality  of  course  content  through  an  accreditation  board;  (iii)  offering  career \nguidance and job search information; (iv) recommending financial management of resources to \nreplace line-item budgeting with performance-based budgeting; and (v) harnessing new learning \ntechnologies to improve access and quality. Based on discussions, visits, interviews, and focus \ngroups, these reviews and employment survey provided government with important information \nto develop the university reforms agenda.5    \n \n \n14. \nIn  September  2000,  the  Government  sponsored  a  tertiary  education  workshop  for \ndonors  in  Kandy.  ADB  was  requested  to  support  public  and  private  postsecondary  education \ninstitutions  outside  the  conventional,  academically  oriented  university  system.6  At  the  same \ntime,  the  Government  requested  the  World  Bank  to  help  rationalize  the  traditional  university \nsystem. Both agencies spent 2002 engaged in project preparation. ADB prepared the distance \neducation  project.  The  World  Bank  prepared  a  tertiary  education  project  to  increase  graduate \nemployment \nfrom  conventional  university \nfaculties.  Throughout  ongoing  discussions  on  educational  reform  since  1996,  government \nofficials,  beneficiaries,  private  stakeholders,  and  other  financial  agencies  were  consulted \nInternational  Cooperation  (NORAD)  and  Swedish \nclosely.

The  Japan \n\nmanagement, \nInternational \nCooperation Agency  (JICA)  is  helping  develop  ICT  skills  for  web  writers  and  is  supporting  a \nbachelor\u2019s  degree  in  teaching  at  the  University  of  Colombo.  The  International  Labour \nOrganization  (ILO)  is  helping  the  Ministry  of  Employment  and  Labor  develop  a  job-listing \ndatabank for public consumption. Together with the World Bank,7 NORAD, Sida, ILO, and JICA, \nthe  aid  strategy  on  higher  education  is  designed  to  improve  internal  and  external  efficiency, \nboost quality, and ensure sustainability of the tertiary education system for the greatest number \nof  students  (Appendix  6).  More  recently,  the  World  Bank  has  been  involved  in  developing  a \nmajor ICT project, based on e-Sri Lanka.   \n \nE. \n \n15.  Worldwide  experience  shows  that  education  systems  can  be  expanded  to  meet \nincreased  social  demand  for  improved  quality,  even  with  budget  constraints.  When  additional \npublic funds are limited, careful attention must be paid to limit the scope to public programs that \nenhance  the  public  good.  Adequate  public  funds  are  needed  to  pay  the  base  costs  for  quality \nteaching inputs. Another approach is to promote public-private partnerships, which can provide \nresources  to  help  institutions  employ  new  learning  technologies  to  meet  social  demand.8 ADB \nexperience in setting up a private university in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam, indicates that where \ndemand  exists,  the  private  sector  and  prospective  students  are  willing  to  share  costs.  In  Sri \nLanka, private schools are reluctant to start because of the financial risks associated with high \nborrowing costs and financing of student services, including on-line libraries, and ICT.  \n \n16. \nADB experience in establishing the Open University in Dhaka, Bangladesh, showed that \nwithout adequate resources, efficiency suffers unless schools  are allowed to charge tuition. The \nOpen  University  also  required  sound  management  and  administration  to  encourage  the \nGovernment  to  provide  additional  funds  to  fully  utilize  the  facilities.  In  open  universities \nworldwide,  students  are  generally  willing  to  pay  for  services,  provided  that  the  amounts  are \naffordable, services are of high quality, school administration is efficient, and schools make full \nuse  of  facilities.  In  Nepal,  ADB  learned  that  vocational  and  technical  training  requires  close \ncooperation  with  the  private  sector,  and  surveys  of  demand  for  specific  occupations.  The \nproposed Sri Lanka project stresses demand-driven academic programs and close cooperation \nwith  the  private  sector,  because  education  must  be  closely  linked  to  employer  needs.  To \npromote  social  equity,  charging  for  services  and  seeking  exemptions  through  socially  targeted \nstipends is better than simply providing free services across the board. While politically difficult \nto  implement,  the  best  policy  is  to  provide  the  highest  quality to the most people at least cost \nwhile ensuring options to the poor who lack the resources to access quality programs. \n \n17. \nProject implementation in Sri Lanka previously suffered from cumbersome procurement \nprocedures  that  are  now  being  addressed  by  ADB\u2019s  Sri  Lanka  Resident  Mission.  Typically, \nproject  implementation  works  well  when  the  implementation  office  and  executing  agency  are \nexperienced  in  project  administration  and  work  together.  ADB  education  projects  have  been \nfairly successful. Projects have been completed within cost and on time. Proper administration \nensured  that  overseas  study  tours  and  procurement  of  goods  and  services  were  effective. \nHowever,  continuous  supervision  of  MTET  capacity  will  be  required  to  ensure  successful \nimplementation of existing and new ADB projects. Likewise, care will be required to ensure that \n\n                                                 \n7   World  Bank.  2002.

The \nProject  aims  to  boost  the  enrollment,  quality,  and  relevance  of  learning  through  distance \neducation such that it will immediately facilitate on-line learning for the 165,000 external degree \nstudents  of  traditional  universities,  qualified  PPSI  training  programs  offered  by  at  least  15 \nrecognized institutions with over 40,000 clients, conventional universities that wish to migrate to \na  mixed-mode  environment,  and  some  20,000  learners  attending  the  26  OUSL  campuses \nacross the country. The combined capacity of the PPSIs, SLIATE, and the OUSL will effectively \ndouble  over  the  next  5  years.  Thus,  an  additional  50,000  learners  will  have  access  to  a  full \nrange  of  quality  courses  of  study  through  the  national  network  of  telecenters  and  affiliated \nfacilities. In addition, the Project will support the key thrusts of e-Sri Lanka, and it will stimulate \nvalue-added  services  such  as  e-government,  small  business  connectivity  and  community \ndevelopment.  This  initiative  will  interweave  three  inter-dependent  components  of  distance \neducation, public-private partnership and open university study. It will complement World Bank- \nand ongoing ADB-funded projects aimed at training the educated unemployed so that they will \nacquire employment-related qualifications.  \n \nB. \n \n19. \nThe  Project  will  have  three  components  that  will  increase  access  to  and  quality  of \neducational  opportunities  for  secondary  school  graduates.  The  first  component  will  improve \nprogram  content  and  course  distribution  by  establishing  the  DEPP  to  provide  access  to \ncurriculum,  training,  and  multimedia  services  through  more  than  100  multimedia  centers \nnationwide. The DEPP also includes the NDEN, linking the 26 OUSL centers and other public \nand  private  postsecondary  institutions  via  web-based  multimedia  courses  and  training,  tutorial \nchat rooms, and on-line electronic access to OUSL and other member PPSI electronic libraries, \nmultimedia,  and  university  press  services.  These  services  will  be  provided  for  up  to  200,000 \nstudents in public and private postsecondary institutes participating in the Project. The second \ncomponent will stress public-private institutional sharing through matching grants for (i) stipends \nfor the poor, (ii) information sharing on career and labor market awareness, (iii) participation in \nstandardized accreditation setting, (iv) access to on-line distance education programs and funds \nfor ICT and learning materials, and (v) participation in program sharing with foreign universities. \nComponent  two  also  includes  project  management  activities.  The  third  component  will  use \nconsultants  and  staff \nto  make  OUSL  more  efficient  by  modernizing  school \nadministration,  including  by  streamlining  the  information  technology  (IT),  financial  and \naccounting, budgeting, and  student registration systems for all campuses. The component will \nalso  expand  and  upgrade  facilities  at  all  OUSL  campuses,  including  providing  science  and \ncomputer laboratories, staff offices, equipment, furniture, and vehicles. The Project is outlined in \nmore detail in paras. 20-27. \n \n\ntraining \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8\n\n \n\n1. \n\nComponent  1:  Establishment  of  the  DEPP  to  Raise  Quality  and  Enhance \nCapacity \n\n \n20. \nThe  DEPP  will  be  established  to  raise  quality  and  enhance  capacity  by  setting  up  and \nmanaging  a  distance  education  network  that  provides  curriculum  content,  training,  mentoring, \npeer  group  support  and  interaction,  and  related  undertakings,  plus  maintenance  of  hardware \nand  software.  The  projected  cost  is  $15  million  for  expertise,  capacity  building,  technology \ntransfer,  equipment  and  software,  and  recurrent  costs.  The  DEPP  will  operate  as  a  corporate \nentity located within public premises. This component will have two parts. Part A will include the \nestablishment  of  the  DEPP  office  to  provide  curriculum  development,  training,  research, \nmarketing,  and  contract  outsourcing  management  services  for  on-line  distance  education \nacademic  courses  for  up  to  150  public  and  private  postsecondary  institutes.  The  DEPP  board \nwill  comprise  the  same  members  as  the  project  steering  committee  along  with  MPD&I. DEPP \nactivities  will  include  international  and  domestic  consultants  to  develop  the  business  and \nmarketing plan, set up a curriculum program department, and train local web writers and on-line \ntutors to operate distance education programs on-line. A system evaluation will be carried out to \nassess the long-term sustainability of the DEPP. Budgetary support for local staff and training, \nand  recurrent  operating  costs  will  be  provided  under  the  Project  to  cover  costs  for  the  first  5 \nyears when revenue growth is weak.  \n \n21. \nPart  B  will  include  the  establishment  of  the  NDEN  under  DEPP.  The  NDEN  is  the \nhardware side of the DEPP and includes consultants, some equipment, and recurrent operating \ncosts  to  configure,  install,  and  operate  the  national  distance  education  system  needed  to \nsupport DEPP service delivery of on-line educational courses to 150 public and private member \ninstitutions,  including  OUSL  campuses.  Outputs  will  include  the  establishment  of  a  national \nnetwork  of  multimedia  centers  to  provide  on-line  learning.  Activities  will  include  hiring  of \ninternational  and  domestic  consultants,  leasing  capacity  and  delivery  systems,  purchase  of  a \nlimited range of equipment, payment of recurrent costs for contract workers, and operation and \nmaintenance during project implementation to establish the NDEN at all OUSL campuses and \nanother 100 multimedia centers in public and private postsecondary institutions assisted under \nthe Project.  \n \n22. \nDEPP and NDEN technicians will guide the setup of the national hardware and software \nnetwork, in close collaboration with the private sector service providers, to connect multimedia \ncenters  nationwide.  The  network  will  consist  of  the  distribution  center  at  the  DEPP  and  the \nmultimedia centers around Sri Lanka. Multimedia centers are similar to computer labs found in \nschools  but  they  include  radio,  audio,  multimedia,  facilities,  facsimile,  copying,  telephone,  and \nweb  browsing  services.  The  administration,  engineering,  and  technical  services;  multimedia \ncenter operations; and facilities and equipment setup will be handled by the DEPP. MTET will \noutsource  the  establishment  and  operation  of  the  DEPP  to  a  private  contractor.  Outputs  will \ninclude  establishment  of  DEPP  facilities  and  staff  training,  configuration  and  installation  of \nhardware and software, and servicing day-to-day operations to expand the system into a profit-\nmaking  venture  before  project  completion.  Outputs  will  include  an  on-line  delivery  system  of \nquality academic programs, training and tutorial support, admissions and billing system, career \nguidance, and job listing. The NDEN will provide the delivery system and technical servicing for \nfacilities and equipment, including connectivity for multimedia centers and numerous public and \nprivate  educational  institutions.  In  all,  up  to  80,000  external  degree  students  and  students \nattending public and private institutions will gain access to DEPP distance education programs \neach year. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f9\n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Public-Private Partnerships to Increase Access \n\n \n \n23. \nPolicies  will  be  introduced  to  promote  more  fluid  private  sector  participation  in \npostsecondary  education.  Policies  include  support  for  (i)  universal  accreditation  standards,  (ii) \nprivate participation in on-line distance education, (iii) link programs with foreign and domestic \ninstitutions,  and  (iv)  scholarships  and  stipends  to  support  education  and  training.  Particular \nimportance will be attached to matching grants provided to private sector institutes to offset high \ncosts  of  borrowing,  and  to  promote  expansion  to  increase  enrollments.  Stipends  and \nscholarships for the poor will also be encouraged along with allowances for short-term training \non-line  with  postsecondary  education  institutes  to  meet  immediate  skill  shortages  in  key  labor \nmarket  segments.  This  component  will  have  two  parts.  Part  A  will  include  matching  grants  to \nsupport several new MPD&I policies affecting postsecondary education. The Project will support \nthe  Government\u2019s  establishment  of  an  autonomous  accreditation  board  under  the  University \nGrants  Commission  (UGC)  for  all  tertiary  education  institutions  to  set  standards  and  monitor \ninstitutional  qualifications  through  data  collection.  The  Project  will  provide  studies  and  public \nawareness campaigns to alert students to career guidance, job search skills, and understanding \nof labor market requirements through information sharing on the web. The project management \noffice  (PMO)  will  carry  out  studies  to  (i)  audit  OUSL  capacity  to  provide  quality  education,  (ii) \nestablish  ICT  policy  for  distance  education  for  external  degree  students,  and  (iii)  establish \nguidelines for licensing and accrediting academic programs for private postsecondary schools to \nensure  fair  trade  practices.  The  Project  will  provide  funds  for  foreign  and  domestic \npostsecondary education institutions to exchange faculty and curricula. The Project will provide \nsupport  for  stipends  for  poor  students  in  public  and  private  institutions  and  for  unemployed \nsecondary  school  leavers.  Approximately  4,500  needy  OUSL  students,  needy  students \nregistered at DEPP, and unemployed A-level graduates seeking short term training will qualify \nannually  for  need-based  stipends  to  pay  tuition  fees.  The  Project  will  support  ICT  policies  by \nproviding  public  and  private  postsecondary  institutions  with  matching  funds  to  achieve  these \ngoals. MTET will provide matching grants under the Project to public and private postsecondary \neducation  institutes  that  can  demonstrate  increased  enrollment  through  increased  access  to \ndistance learning, programs linked with foreign institutions, and stipends for the poor. Part B will \ninclude  the  recurrent  costs  for  staff  and  domestic  consultants  to  operate  the  PMO,  which  will \nhandle the day-to-day operations of the Project and implement educational policy. A Task Force \nunder MTET will be set up to evaluate proposals from private institutes (Appendix 6).  \n \n24. \nOutputs  will  include  policies  that  support  (i)  development  of  on-line  career  guidance \nprograms,  school-rating  systems,  on-line  job  search,  school  certification  assessment,  and \nschool ranking through an accreditation board; (ii) stipend programs for the poor and for rapid \ntraining of unemployed educated youth; and (iii) ICT for school multimedia centers, and  on-line \naccess  to  academic  programs  and  digital  learning  materials  for  up  to  100  mostly  private \npostsecondary  institutes  through  matching  grants.  Matching  grants  will  be  provided  to  private \npostsecondary institutions that submit proposals for grants to upgrade ICT facilities and convert \nprogram syllabuses to  on-line  learning  and  outreach  to  a  wider  audience  in  towns  across  Sri \nLanka. Matching grants will be contingent on schools providing additional stipends for the poor \nand  will  help  reduce  the  high  cost  of  borrowing  for  computers  and  transferring  academic \nprograms to the web.  \n \n \n \n25. \nThe  Project  will  modernize  OUSL  to  bring  it  up  to  world-class  standards  in  distance \neducation.  The  Project  will  support  developing  OUSL  human  and  material  assets  that  will  be \nmade available to over  20  PPSIs.  By  project  completion,  enrollment  capacity  will  be  doubled, \nwith 60% of new clients in rural areas. Approximately $8 million will go toward upgrading central \nfacilities,  and  $10  million  for  refurbishing  regional  educational  amenities  accessible  for shared \n\nComponent 3: OUSL Expanded Capacity \n\n3. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fOutputs  will  include  (i)  doubling  of  enrollment  from  20,000  to  40,000  students;              \n\n10\n\n \n\nuse  by  other  public  and  private  educational  institutes.  The  OUSL  outreach  is  unique  in \nsupporting  poorer  students  in  rural  areas  for  whom  there  are  few  other  options  to  obtain  an \nacademic diploma or degree. \n  \n26. \nOUSL  capacity  expansion  will  have  two  parts.  Part  A  will  include  administrative \nstreamlining  and  staff  development  to  modernize  the  (i)  accounting,  budgeting,  and  financial \nsystems;  (ii)  the  IT  system;  (iii)  the  student  admission  system,  including  a  tracer  study  and \ntracking system; and (iv) a staff development program, including curriculum revision. To double \nenrollment and increase the completion rate, OUSL will strengthen its administrative computer \noperations  with  the  help  of  consultants,  who  will  train  staff  in  the  use  of  new  equipment and \nsoftware. Part B will include renovation and upgrading of central and regional campus facilities. \nAt the central campus, the Project will support construction of two much-needed buildings: (i) a \nscience  and  technology  center  for  the  faculty  of engineering and natural sciences, which will \ninclude  science  laboratories  and  staff  offices;  and  (ii)  an  educational  learning  technologies \nbuilding,  which  will  also  house  the  education  faculty  and  the  IT  center.  Other  buildings  will  be \nrehabilitated, including the library, multimedia center, and university press. Construction of new \nbuildings  and  rehabilitation  of  the  other  OUSL  regional  and  study  centers  will  support  staff \noffices,  science  laboratories,  and  computer  centers.  All  civil  works  on  OUSL  campuses were \ndetermined  by  need.  Two  new  regional  centers  will  be  upgraded  from  study  centers  at \nBatticaloa  and  Anuradhapura.  Hatton,  Dambulla,  Gampaha,  Hambantota,  and  Puttalam  will \nhave  5  new  study  centers  for  a  total  of  6  regional  and  20  study  centers.  New  centers will be \nestablished on government lands; no resettlement is required.   \n \n27. \n(ii)    modernizing  the  OUSL  accounting/budgeting  and  financial  system;  (iii) strengthening the \nICT system; and (iv) improving the admissions system, which will be put  on-line, and the staff \ntraining  program,  which  will  provide  foreign  and  local  training  for  OUSL  faculty  and  staff.  The \nsuccessful  candidates  will  be  required  to  return  to  OUSL  and  teach  for  a  minimum  of  3  years \nafter  training.  An  OUSL  social  audit  will  be  carried  out  to  determine  performance-based \nbudgeting,  which  will  link  enrollment  growth  to  budget  growth  so  that  performance-based \nbudgeting  can  be  implemented.  Other  outputs  will  include  construction  of  the  two  important \nbuildings  on  the  OUSL  central  campus  and  numerous  rehabilitations  at  all  other  regional  and \nstudy centers. Furniture, equipment, vehicles, consulting services, and recurrent costs for new \ncontract  staff  will  be  provided  to  ensure  enrollment  growth.  Increased  outreach  capacity  to \nregional campuses will be met through additional contract staff paid by fees from new students, \nand improved registration and counseling, which will lead to higher enrollment and fees.  \n \nC. \n \n28. \nNew Learning Technologies. The DEPP will provide a platform for an ICT network of \nhardware  and  software  linking  26  new  and  existing  OUSL  centers  around  the  country  via  the \nInternet,  with  provision  to  expand  to  additional  multimedia  centers  in  100  public  and  private \neducational institutions over 6 years. The DEPP will offer the technical competence to develop a \nbusiness  and  marketing  plan  to  provide,  on  a  cost-recovery basis, online(i) curriculum content \ndevelopment,  (ii)  tutorial  training,  (iii)  course  design  production,  and  (iv)  management  and \nmarketing. Learning content available  on-line will include OUSL core programs, and courses for \nany  other  PPSI  that  seeks  to  migrate  its  course  content  onto  the  web  for  ready  access \nthroughout  the  country.  The  DEPP  will  combine  technical  expertise  and  access  to  web-based \non-line  multimedia,  a  national  professionally  trained  system  of  tutors,  and  digital  learning \nmaterials targeted at external degree students. The DEPP will support multimedia courseware \nbeing  developed  by  selected  universities,  and  eventually,  it  may  be  absorbed  into  a  private \nmultimedia university or it could be set up as a stand-alone organization owned and operated by \nmember PPSIs for their common benefit. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \n\n\f11\n\n29. \nPublic-Private Partnership Model. Aside from establishing the DEPP to support public-\nprivate  partnerships  to  create  and  deliver  new  learning  technologies,  the  PMO  will  encourage \npublic-private  sharing  of  startup  costs  to  access  distance  learning and improve computer and \nlibrary facilities by providing matching funds to acquire and migrate print materials to interactive \nmode,  and  to  localize  foreign-sourced materials for  on-line  delivery,  including  tutorial  support \nsystems and electronic library facilities. Private postsecondary institutions are normally licensed \ndegree-granting  establishments  recognized  by  MTET.  They  may  also  qualify  for  student \nstipends to encourage  on-line  study,  and  for  capital  funding  for  equipment,  shared  access  to \nlabor  market  surveys  and  career  guidance  counseling,  public  awareness  campaigns  sharing \ninformation on educational opportunities, and foreign and local institutional linkages. The Project \nwill  provide  access  to  these  services  by  encouraging  public  and  private  postsecondary \ninstitutions  to  participate  in  project  activities.  The  Project  will  accomplish  this  by  providing \nmatching  funds  for  educational  institutions  to  reduce  borrowing  costs,  strengthen  ongoing \nprograms to increase enrollment, and support student scholarships.  \n \n30. \nEducation  Policy  Coordination.  Previous  ADB  TA  provided  the  government  with  a \nframework  to  advance  tertiary  education  goals.  The  Project  will  support  new  governmental \nproposals expressed in  e-Sri  Lanka,  and  it  will  provide  mechanisms to implement the related \ngoals. The Project will support government policies to harness the private sector as a strategic \npartner  to  rationalize  the  expansion  of  intake  capacity  through  public-private partnerships and \ndistance  learning  at  OUSL.  MPD&I  will  closely  coordinate  these  activities  with  ongoing \ngovernment  efforts  to  undertake  tertiary  education  reforms  and,  with  the  World  Bank,  to \nmodernize conventional universities to provide relevant courses. MTET and UGC will establish \nan autonomous accreditation board by 2005 to audit postsecondary institutes, and train staff in \nself-evaluation  so  that  results-based  budgeting  will  take  precedence  over  traditional  line-item \nbudgeting. MPD&I will coordinate with OUSL to extensively review OUSL operations to improve \nefficiency and monitor enrollment growth and budgeting. MTET will coordinate career guidance \nand  labor  market  employment  information  systems  with  the  Ministry  of  Labor  to  provide \ninformation  on  curriculum  and  courses  at  postsecondary  education  institutes.  MPD&I  will \nestablish  a  task  force  to  formalize  the  links  between  university  education  and  postsecondary \ninstitutes to facilitate cross-enrollment and standardization of academic requirements through a \nframework  for  cooperation  among  postsecondary  institutions.  The  study  will  recommend \nadoption  of  clearly  defined  rules  and  regulations  on  opening,  operating,  and  closing  institutes; \nrequirements for accreditation through the accreditation board; and listing of fair trade practices \nto protect students.  \n \nD. \n \n31. \nThe total project cost is estimated at $60 million equivalent, including physical and price \ncontingencies,  taxes  and  duties,  and  interest  charge;  $24  million  (40%)  comprises  the  foreign \nexchange cost, and $36 million equivalent (60%), the local currency cost. The foreign and local \nproject cost estimates by component are summarized in Table 1 and Appendix 8.  \n\nCost Estimates \n\n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nE. \n \nIt  is  proposed  to  provide  a  loan  of  $45  million  equivalent  from  ADB's  Special  Funds \n32. \nresources.  The  Borrower  will  be  Sri  Lanka.  The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a \ngrace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1.0% per year during the grace period and \n1.5% during the remaining term. ADB will finance 70% of the project cost, including $24 million \n(100%) of the foreign exchange cost and $21 million equivalent (58%) of the local currency cost. \nThe Government will finance $10 million equivalent (17%) of total costs for civil works, special \nprograms,  incremental  recurrent  cost,  taxes,  and  duties,  with  local  beneficiaries  financing  the \nremaining  $5  million  equivalent  (8%)  of  total  costs  through  course  fees,  and  private  institution \nmatching funds for ICT facilities and multimedia equipment (Table 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12\n\n \n\nTable 1: Project Costs by Component \n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \n\n \nProject Component \nA.

Most  students  benefiting  from  these \nprograms  reside  in  rural  towns  and  lack  access  to  educational  opportunities.  Cost  sharing \nthrough  course  fees  will  recover  up  to  40%  of  OUSL  nonsalary  recurrent  expenditures  and \nsalary expenditures for contract staff after 6 years. These fees will provide the resource base to \noperate OUSL thereafter. OUSL needs government support to strengthen public services. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n13\n\n \n34. \nThe project steering committee, chaired by the policy development and implementation \nsecretary,  will  include  the  tertiary  education  secretary;  the  project  director  of  the  PMO  (as \nrecording  secretary);  and  representatives  from  the  National  Education  Commission,  OUSL, \nprivate postsecondary institutes, Chamber of Commerce, public-private partnership Task Force, \nUGC,  and  University  of  Moratuwa.  The  steering  committee  will  serve  as  the  apex  decision-\nmaking body and will meet quarterly to review progress and take decisions. The PMO has been \nestablished  by  MTET,  offices  have  been  identified,  and  core  staff  appointed.  The  PMO  at \nminimum will include the project director, deputy director, two accounts officers, procurement \nspecialist, building engineer, and monitoring and evaluation officer. It will also include two staff \nmembers to prepare the Project's OUSL activities, one full-time staff member to manage DEPP \nactivities,  and  one  special  programs  coordinator.  To  implement  special  programs,  a  public-\nprivate partnership task force composed of outside academics and representatives from OUSL, \nMTET,  and  the  private  sector  will  ensure  transparency  in  reviewing  and  selecting  proposals \nsubmitted for scholarship and matching grants. Scholarships for the poor will be reviewed by the \nPMO,  and  recommendations  on  recipients  will  be  based  on  a  review  of  existing  criteria \nconsidering financial need and academic performance, which will be agreeable to ADB. MTET \nwill set up the Task Force within 1 month of loan effectiveness. The Task Force also will review \nthe  public-private  partnership  applications  for  matching  grants  and  make  recommendations  to \nthe  steering  committee  for  approval.  The  Task  Force  will  recommend  policy  guidelines  on \npublic-private  partnerships  to  operate  and  maintain  quality  standards.  The  DEPP  technical \ncommittee,  composed  of  representatives  from  MPD&I  OUSL,  MTET,  and  a  management  firm, \nwill oversee all issues related to DEPP management and NDEN installation and servicing. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 6 years, from June 2003 to 2009 (Appendix 9). \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nThe Project will upgrade existing facilities and establish new ones in OUSL central and \n36. \nregional campuses.  Furniture  and  equipment  for  these  buildings  and  for  the  DEPP  and  the \nNDEN,  including  standard  network  equipment,  science  equipment,  and  office  computer \nequipment, will be provided under the Project. The goods and services financed under the loan \nwill  be  procured  following  ADB  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil  works  will  take  place  on \ngovernment  land  and  will  not  engender  any  involuntary  resettlement.  Civil  works  contracts \nabove  $2  million  will  follow  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB),  while  those  valued  at  $2 \nmillion or less will follow  local competitive bidding. Procurement of equipment above $500,000 \nwill  follow  ICB,  while  contracts  valued  $500,000  or  less  will  follow  international  shopping. \nFurniture,  learning  materials,  and  software  costing  less  than  $100,000  per  item  may  be \nprocured through direct purchase to ensure local relevance and quick delivery. Civil works and \nequipment packages are in Appendix 10. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n37. \nThe  Project  will  require  703  person-months  of  consulting  services,  consisting  of  203 \nperson-months  of  international  and  500  person-months  of  domestic  consultants.  Separate \npackages  will  be  prepared  for  consultants  working  under  OUSL  (72  person-months, \ninternational;  55  person-months,  domestic)  and  the  DEPP  (121  person-months, international; \n304  person-months,  domestic).  An  additional  10  person-months  of  international  and  122 \n\n \n35. \n \n\n \n\n\f14\n\n \n\nperson-months  of  domestic  individual  consultants  will  be  provided  to  the  PMO.  All  consultants \nwill  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements acceptable to ADB for engagement of domestic consultants. A select number of \nshort-term domestic consultants will work for the PMO. OUSL and the DEPP may be engaged \nindividually to respond rapidly to problems (Appendixes 11 and 12). \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Action  \n\n38. \nThe Government has requested advance action to ensure that the Project activities start \non  time.  Aside  from  ensuring  that  the  PMO  is  established  and  core  staff  are  identified  before \nloan negotiations, the implementing agency (IA) will prepare the ICB procurement package for \nDEPP hardware and the shortlist of DEPP consultants. OUSL will prepare the ICB contract for \nnew  civil  works  at  OUSL  so  that  construction  can  be  tendered  within  6  months  after  loan \neffectiveness. ADB has approved advance action for the procurement of the civil works contract \nat OUSL and the supply contract for the DEPP, and the consulting services for the DEPP and \nthe NDEN on the understanding that such advance action does not  commit ADB to finance the \nProject. \n \n\n6. \n\nSelection  Criteria  for  Stipends,  Public-Private  Partners,  and  Foreign-\nDomestic Links  \n\nThe  PMO,  with  the  assistance  of  the  Task  Force,  will  advertise  requests  for  poor \n39. \nstudents  enrolled  at  OUSL,  poor  unemployed  secondary  school  graduates,  and  educated \nunemployed seeking skills training to apply for stipends to pay their tuition fees. Criteria will be \nbased on an income means test and other socio-economic factors approved by PSC and ADB.   \nAnnual  enrollment  and  academic  performance will determine  continuous  eligibility  scholarship \nholders.  Training  programs  for  educated  unemployed  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval \nwithin  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness.9 The PMO will ask postsecondary institutions to submit \nproposals for matching funds to upgrade ICT facilities and develop academic courses  on-line. \nProposals will not exceed $50,000, of which the Project will pay half through matching grants. \nOnly  postsecondary  private  institutions  recognized  by  MTET  can  apply, and they must show \nsignificantly increased capacity as a result of the upgrade as outlined in the proposal. To qualify \nfor  the  grant,  schools  must  provide  the  PMO  with  detailed  information  on  their  existing  and \nproposed additional stipend program for the poor. Public-private partners may also request, as \npart  of  the  grant,  permission  to  join  link  programs  with  foreign  institutions  to  gain  access  to \nforeign  degree-granting  institutions.  Under  the  foreign-domestic  link  program,  funds  to  pay  for \ncourse material and faculty exchange may be requested through a proposal to be evaluated by \nthe advisory program in consultation with the PMO and ADB. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nTo  expedite  the  disbursement  of  loan  funds,  the  Government  will  establish  an imprest \n40. \naccount at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in Colombo. The imprest account will be established, \nmanaged,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook, dated January 2001, and detailed arrangements agreed on by the Government and \nADB.  The  ceiling  for  the  use  of  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be  $100,000  (Loan \nDisbursement Handbook,  para. 9.17). The initial advance to the imprest account should cover \nthe  anticipated  expenditures  for  6  months  but  not  exceed $2 million. The flow of funds will be \napproved  by  the  PMO,  with  funds  for  local  training  and  consultants  provided  directly  to  OUSL \n                                                 \n9   Alternatively,  the  Government  may  seek  ADB  concurrence  to  implement  scholarships  through  the  ongoing  ADB-\nassisted  pilot  Self-employment  Promotion  Initiative  revolving  fund  established  under  Loan  1707-SRI(SF): Skills \nDevelopment;  the  ongoing  Tharuna  Aruna  Program  jointly  operated  by  government  and  private  sector;  or  the \nongoing student scholarship program. \n\n \n\n\f15\n\nvia an imprest account I/A subaccount as noted in the project administration memorandum. The \nPMO will provide funds to public and private schools under special programs for ICT equipment, \nlearning  materials,  and  rehabilitation  improvements  to  raise  enrollment,  increase  access  to \ndistance learning, and support scholarship programs for the needy. The PMO will pay suppliers \nthrough  direct  payment  or  direct  purchase  for  proposal-based  applications  submitted  to  the \nPMO, screened by the task force, and approved by MTET and ADB.  \n \n\n1. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  records  and  accounts  are  maintained  to  identify  the \n41. \ngoods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds.  Separate  project  accounts  will  be \nmaintained  and  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  standards  acceptable  to \nADB. A separate opinion on the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditure will be \nincluded in the annual audit report. Certified copies of such audited accounts will be submitted \nto  ADB  within  9  months  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year.  The  PMO  will  prepare  quarterly \nreports  on  the  implementation  of  project-funded  activities.  The  report  will  be  in  a  format \nacceptable  to  ADB,  and  will  indicate  progress  made  against  established  targets,  problems \nencountered during the quarter, steps proposed and taken to solve problems, compliance with \nloan  covenants,  and  project  activities  to  be  undertaken  during  the  next  quarter.  A  project \ncompletion report will be prepared within 3 months of the physical completion of the Project. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n42. \nIn  addition  to  system  evaluation  of  the  DEPP  by  PMO  staff  and  consultants, \nperformance  monitoring  will  be  evaluated  on  baseline  data  under  the  Project  collected  from \nUGC,  OUSL,  SLIATE,  and  other  public  and  private  educational  institutions  participating  in  the \nProject. The baseline data include annual enrollment registration, attendance and graduation or \ncompletion rates by course and program, and unit costs based on output and budgets. These \ndata will be disaggregated by gender, campus, and program. Tracer studies will be  carried out \nin  the  fifth  year  of  the  Project  to  determine  the  employment  problems  facing  OUSL  students, \nexternal degree students studying  on-line, and private school students under the Project. The \nADB  project  performance  monitoring  system  will  provide  the  project-monitoring  framework. \nResult-based  performance  will  be  monitored  by  the  PMO  and  evaluated  against  institution \nimprovement plans. The results of the tracer studies and surveys of OUSL and DEPP students \nwill  be  included  in  the  analysis  of  impact.  Benefit  evaluation  will  be  measured  qualitatively \nagainst  stated  goals  of  improving  the  number  of  enrollees,  and  against  cost-effectiveness \nmeasures. The performance-based management systems at OUSL, SLIATE, and participating \nprivate  institutions  will  be  based  on  management  and  budget-related  performance  indicators \ndeveloped under the Project (Appendix 13). \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n43. \nGiven  the  labor-intensive  nature  of  enhancing  skills  in  Sri  Lanka,  the  project  approach \nwill be long term, and monitoring will be process and output oriented. Comprehensive reviews of \nproject  performance  will  be  conducted  at  the  end  of  the  first  and  third  year  of  implementation. \nThe  first  review  will  focus  on  the  success  of  the  implementation  procedures.  The  second \n(midterm) review will focus on overall benefits, achievements, and restructuring and reallocation \nof project funds. Financial compliance monitoring will focus on agreed-on criteria and guidelines \nestablished  by  the  PMO  to  ensure  that  funds  flow  efficiently,  transparency  is  maintained,  and \naudits are carried out annually.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16\n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \n44. \nThe Project offers many benefits to postsecondary education institutions and students. \nOverall, educational opportunities will increase for an additional 100,000 postsecondary school \nstudents,  who  will  benefit  from  better  course  content  structured  for  easy  transfer  of  academic \ncredits across schools. As students gain access to a wider choice of institutes and programs, \nprogress from certificate to diploma to degree courses within and across educational institutions \nwill become easier. OUSL is expected to double enrollment from about 20,000 to 40,000, and \nthe student completion rate from about 6.5% to 12.3%. At the end of the Project, over 25,000 \nstudents pursuing self-study in private institutions will have access to on-line distance learning, \nwhich  is  expected  to  increase  the  number  of  students  completing  external  degrees.  About \n35,000 additional students in PPSIs will gain access to student services and course content on-\nline.  About  20,000  unemployed  secondary  school  graduates  will  gain  access \nto \nsemiprofessional  job  training.  A  wide  variety  of  postsecondary  institutions  will  benefit  from  the \nProject. OUSL will be a major beneficiary. About 125 private postsecondary profit and nonprofit \ninstitutes  will  also  benefit.  In  all,  about  150  public  and  private  institutes  and  80,000  additional \nstudents will benefit from the Project each year by 2012. Over 18 years, about 1.4 million more \nstudent enrollees will have access to postsecondary education due to the Project. The Poverty \nReduction and Social Strategy is found in Appendix 14.  \n \n45. \nAs  educational  opportunities  increase,  so  will  the  number  of  students  completing  their \nstudies. The Project will improve economic opportunities, with dependence on the public sector \ngiving  way  to  economic  restructuring  to  modernize  the  labor  force  through  promotion  of \ndemand-based job skills required in the private sector, such as accounting, business, computer, \nand  language  skills.  Job  mobility  will  increase  as  workers  have  more  choice,  in  or  outside  Sri \nLanka. The project economic internal rate of return estimate has been calculated at 14% for the \nlow scenario, and 23% for the likely scenario once the social conflict is resolved and the market \nis  deregulated.  Job  mobility  creates  job  vacancies  throughout  the  structure  while  raising  skill \nlevels and expectations. The Project will support the ADB and government strategy to increase \npostsecondary education opportunities to improve skills needed for the modern economy. The \neconomic  analysis  is  consistent  with  the  fiscal  impact  of  public  sector  investment,  including \nrecurrent costs. The evaluation provides for a cost-benefit analysis with collection of data, and \nidentifies underlying risk factors of new technologies; the move to open markets; and the lack of \nphysical infrastructure. The Project will support the institutional capacity of MTET, and policies \nsupporting public-private partnerships, ICT, and support for beneficiaries outside Colombo. The \neconomic  and  financial  criteria  of  the  Project  support  its  feasibility  up  to  14  years  after \ncompletion.  Abandoning  the  Project  will  leave  the  postsecondary  education  sector  in  disarray, \nwith little prospect of rationalizing expansion intake of capacity; harnessing the private sector as \na  strategic  partner;  encouraging  quality  improvement,  especially  through  new  learning \ntechnologies;  or  supporting  improvements  in  OUSL  to  double  enrollment,  especially  outside \nColombo. The Economic justification is found in Appendix 15. \n \n46. \nAs  OUSL  graduates  more  government  workers  from  rural  areas,  social  services  in \ngovernment offices will improve: rural towns will gain more human resources, and communities \nwill  become  more  efficient  in  sharing  and  using  information  and  knowledge  needed  to  utilize \nsocial services. OUSL will become semiautonomous and be able to recover 40% (up from the \ncurrent 25%) total annual expenditure by 2008, and 50% by 2010. As government expansion of \ntertiary education is unlikely, OUSL will lead the way toward recovering as much as half of the \ncost  of  daily  operation,  thereby  supporting  cost-containment  policies  to  expand  enrollment \nwithout  sacrificing  quality  or  increasing  budgets.  Improved  public-private  participation  will \nenhance cooperation among 150 major postsecondary educational institutions, including OUSL, \n\n \n\n\f17\n\ntechnical colleges, and private profit and nonprofit institutions that provide diploma and degree \nprograms.  Shared  information,  including  career  guidance  and  job  information,  national \nstandards  for  course  content  and  school  admissions,  and  link  programs  between  foreign  and \nlocal and public and private institutions will help improve efficiency and offer students a choice \nin educational opportunities. Establishment of the  NDEN will help develop the means to provide \non-line educational learning across the country, especially to areas outside major urban centers. \nSpecial  attention  will  be  provided  to  the  conflict  areas  in  the  north  and  northeast  and  to \nplantation areas in the highlands. As Sri Lanka modernizes, it will not remain isolated from the \nflow  of  global  information,  knowledge,  and  technology.  The  DEPP  will  link  Sri  Lanka  with  the \noutside  world  through  link  programs  with  foreign  universities  and  web-based institutions, while \nlinking  public  and  private  partnerships  within  the  country.  This  coordination  function  to \nmainstream access to information and knowledge is essential to economic development.  \n \nGender.  Females  are  well  represented  at  all  levels  of  the  education  system,  with  over \n47. \n50%  graduating  and  gaining  entrance  to  the  next  higher  level  at  every  stage  of  education. \nHowever,  female  university  graduates  are  twice  as  unlikely  to  find  jobs  after  graduation  due \npartly to a disproportionately large number of females studying in the arts and humanities, which \nare  less  marketable  than  the  sciences  and  professions.  Females  once  comprised  a  large \nproportion  of  the  new  teaching  staff  recruited  by  government.  Professional  growth in teaching \npositions  has  declined  over  the  past  5  years  as  enrollment  in  primary  education  declined, \ndirectly affecting educated female labor. Certain cultural and social factors, including geographic \nmobility,  have  prevented  educated  women  from  taking  jobs.  The  Project  addresses  these \ninequities  by  providing  career  guidance  and  job  search  skills  from  which  females  may \ndisproportionately  benefit,  and  performance  monitoring  indicators  will  be  disaggregated  by \ngender.  \n \nConflict Areas.10 For the past 20 years, people living in conflict areas have experienced \n48. \nsevere  trauma.  Aside  from  being  separated,  many  families  have  been  dislocated  from  their \ncommunities  or  unable  to  leave  their  community  to  avail  themselves  of  educational  and \neconomic  opportunities.  The  Project  will  provide  alternatives  to  the  educated  poor  unable  to \nmigrate who seek low-cost educational study via distance education. \n \n49. \nEthnicity.  Sri  Lanka's  population  is  divided  into  several  main  cultural  and  ethnic \ndivisions:  Singhalese  (75%),  Tamil  (15%),  Muslim  (8%),  and  Christian  (2%).  While  all  groups \nprovide educational services to their own community, many from each group still require access \nto  public  education.  The  civil  conflict  is  mostly  a  result  of  ethnic  and  cultural  differences. The \nProject  will  strengthen  the  public  system  to  provide  low-cost  quality  distance  education \nnationwide to all, regardless of ethnicity. Efforts will be made to support plantation districts and \nconflict  areas,  where  ethnic  minorities  and  vulnerable  groups  generally  are  isolated  from \nmainstream opportunities. \n \nPoverty Reduction. Outside metro Colombo, Western Province, and other large major \n50. \ncities,  poverty  is  widespread,  especially  in  plantation  areas  in  the  highlands,  where  economic \nopportunities  are  limited  to  tea  plucking,  especially  for  males.  The  north  and  northeast,  where \nsocial conflict has kept the economy from expanding, are also especially poor. The Project will \nhelp poor areas raise the level of educational skills and educational opportunities via access to \ndistance  education.  Educational  opportunities  yield  the  educational  mobility  needed  by \nexpanding economies. \n \n\n                                                 \n10 World  Bank.  1999.

The Project will have no adverse environmental impacts, as it \ninvolves only expanding existing facilities at OUSL. The low-cost distance learning component \nmay  provide  alternatives  to  building  physical  education  facilities  in  many  public  and  private \ninstitutions  and  thus  bring  environmental  benefits  by  reducing  potential  construction-related \nimpacts. \n \nB. \n \n52. \nDistance  education  projects  supporting  postsecondary  education  in  Sri  Lanka  face \ntechnical,  institutional,  and  financial  risks,  which  are,  however,  outweighed  by  the  integrated \nbenefits and impacts. \n \n53. \nTechnical  Risks.  Distance  education  will  not  expand  rapidly  in  Sri  Lanka  if  high \ntelecommunication  costs  and  poor  access  to  infrastructure  persist.  The  DEPP  will  be  phased, \nstarting  with  basic  facilities  and  expanding  by  taking  advantage  of  the  web-based  Internet \nconnectivity  with  outreach  first  through  OUSL  campuses.  In  the  third  year,  multimedia  centers \nwill  be  added  to  SLIATE,  public  and  private  institutions,  and  eventually  Internet  cafes.  The \nGovernment has taken initiatives to deregulate the telecommunications industry, and connection \ncharges are expected to decline as service improves. Over 6 years, technology will get simpler, \nawareness of it will rise, and the youth will gain experience in the use of Internet and other ICT \nfeatures.  Generally,  growth  in  new  technologies  tends  to  be  exponential,  with  diffusion  of  the \ninnovation  upon  implementation.  The  Project  provides  the  major  up-front costs for equipment \nand  technical  expertise.  By  project  completion,  the  transfer  of  technical  expertise  will  be \ncomplete,  and  recurrent  costs  will  be  contained.  At  that  time,  the  Government  may  choose  to \nincorporate the DEPP into the private sector multimedia university system.   \n \n54. \nInstitutional Risks. Public sector institutions in Sri Lanka still require significant capacity \nbuilding  to  become  effective.  OUSL  still  has  weak  administrative  and  financial  structures  that \nprevent efficient and timely registration and follow-up of student enrollments. Before fees can be \naccurately  collected  and  tracked,  the  administration  and  coordination  system  of  all  campuses \nneeds  to  be  streamlined.  While  the  academic  side  of  OUSL  appears  strong  enough  to  fully \nutilize development funds under the Project, OUSL may find it difficult to upgrade its academic \ncourses and migrate them  to the web and provide the backup support for  on-line students. For \nthis  reason,  the  DEPP  management  will  be  outsourced  to  a  private  contractor  to  develop  the \nprocedures and technical capacity to provide these services, and to market and distribute them \nto numerous institutes around the country. The Project provides funds for training of staff. MTET \nis  a  new  ministry  that  recently  split  off  from  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  Higher  Education. \nMTET needs to be strengthened if it is to pursue a coherent approach to policymaking. MPD&I \nis tasked with overseeing tertiary education reform, educational employment strategies, and ICT \nlearning  technologies  for  the  country.  The  PMO  will  support  MTET,  provide  training  for  key \nactivities, and liaise with assistance programs and all postsecondary institutes. The task force to \nscreen  proposals  for  scholarships  and  facilities  funding,  and  the  DEPP  technical  committee  to \nreview  and  recommend  technical  issues  facing  DEPP  will  support  the  steering  committee  and \nthe PMO. \n \nOverall  Project  Financial  and  Economic  Sustainability.  The  Project  will  depend  on \n55. \nsynergies between the public and private sectors to ensure full utilization and wide application of \ndistance education and open learning. The extensive upgrading of  OUSL is designed to double \nenrollment  while  providing  varied  high-quality  educational  opportunities  on-line.  A  financial \nanalysis of OUSL current and future expenditure and income suggests that 25% cost recovery \nthrough fees can easily be increased to 40%  by the end of 2008 by increasing fees by 10-15% \neach  year  and  doubling  enrollment.  OUSL  can  follow  the  world  lead  in  employing  new \ntechnologies  to  increase  access  and  will  be  sufficient  to  cover  all  incremental  recurring  costs \n\n \n\n\f19\n\nafter  project  completion.  Likewise,  the  incremental  recurrent  costs  incurred  by  the  DEPP  after \nproject completion are projected at about $1 million. This amount will sustain DEPP operations \nat  their  current  level  in  2008.  However,  the  DEPP  needs  to  continuously  expand  to  meet \nchanging demands of  on-line  learning  and  additional  program  and  training  initiatives.  For  this, \ncurriculum  and  training  staff  will  need  to  increase.  Servers,  main  connection  lines,  and \ncomputers will require upgrading and replacement from time to time. The costs and benefits of \nthe  new  technologies  will  rise  as  users  increase,  spreading  the  flow  of  information  to  a  wider \naudience at reasonable cost (Appendix 16). \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n56. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n(i) \n\nOpen University of Sri Lanka and Distance Education Partnership Program \nManagement and Finance  \n\n \n\n(a)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, MTET, in coordination with MPD&I, \nwill  ensure  that  OUSL  is  allowed  to  utilize  its  discretionary  funds  from \nstudent fees to hire full- and part-time academic and technical staff. \n(b)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, OUSL will submit building plans for \n\nnew construction to ADB for approval. \n\n(c)  Within 2 years of loan effectiveness, the PMO will complete an extensive \nbaseline  study  of  OUSL  internal  and  external  efficiency  to  determine \nfuture growth and funding requirements and to set targets and guidelines \nfor enrollment and fee structures. \n\n(d)  Within  4  years  of \n\nloan  effectiveness, \n\nthe  PMO  will  review \n\nthe \nperformance-based  operations  and  enrollment  growth  of  OUSL \ncampuses  to  recommend  the  need  for  and  cost-effectiveness  of \nadditional  expansion  to  meet  the  social  demand  for  education  and \ntraining.  \nAll  OUSL  overseas  fellowships  will  require  that  participants  return  to \nOUSL and serve 3 years as a condition of study. \nWithin  3  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  MTET  will  carry  out  a  study  to \nrecommend a transparent system for future DEPP management services \nand will act on these findings. \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g)  Within  5  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  MTET  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance \nwill  analyze  OUSL  finances  to  determine  the  level  of  OUSL  financing \nrecoverable  from  existing  fees.  Anticipated  fees  are  expected  to  be  at \nleast 40% of total recurrent expenditure, with the government assuring a \nbasic  grant  to  OUSL  to  cover  recurrent  expenditures  to  meet  the \nremaining 60% of OUSL operating costs after 2008. \n\n(a)  Within  1  year  from  loan  effectiveness,  MTET  will  introduce  a  career \nguidance  public  awareness  campaign  promoting  the  availability  of \npostsecondary  education  opportunities  and  their  linkages  to  the  labor \nmarket, with a special focus on females.  \n\n(b)  Within  2  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  PMO  will  establish  a  foreign-\ndomestic  institutional  exchange  program,  under  the  guidance  of  the \nsteering  committee,  that  allows  project  institutions  to  apply  for  funds  to \nexchange staff, curriculum, and degrees. \n\n \n(ii) \n \n\nPolicy \n\n \n\n \n\n\f(c)  Within  2  years  from  loan  effectiveness,  MTET  will  finalize  a  policy with \nguidelines  and  evaluation  criteria  for  standardizing  accreditation  of  all \nprograms  employing  distance  education,  including  admission  policy  and \ntransfer of credit across programs and institutions. \n\n(d)  Within 2 years of loan effectiveness, MPD&I will ensure implementation of \nthe national IT policy as it relates to hardware, software, and connection \ncharge discounts for postsecondary education institutions.  \n\n(f) \n\n(e)  Within  3  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  MTET  will  develop  a  time-bound \naction plan to address the demand for programs through DEPP and other \ninstitutions. \nWithin  3  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  MTET  will  develop  a  time-bound \naction plan to (a) oversee the implementation of policies on establishing, \noperating,  and  monitoring  accreditation  standards;  and  (b)  provide  fair \nin  postsecondary  education \ntrade  practices \ninstitutions. \n\nto  protect  students \n\n(g)  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  MPD&I  and  MTET  will  assure \nimplementation  of  a  need-based scholarship program agreeable to ADB \nfor  (i)  needy  OUSL  students,  (ii)  needy  external  degree  students \nregistered  at  DEPP  to  apply  for  free  on-line  service  implemented  under \nthe Project, and (iii) unemployed high school leavers. \n\n(h)  Within  2  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  MPD&I  and  MTET  will  establish  a \npermanent  Board  to  replace  the  task  force  in  managing  and  monitoring \nstudent stipends and scholarships. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n57. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  33,005,000  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the \nDistance Education Modernization Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest \ncharge at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as \nare  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to \nthe Board.  \n \n \n\n                                                                                                                                      President \n\nTadao Chino \n\n \n \n \n19 May 2003 \n\n20\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n21\n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance \n Indicators \n\nMonitoring \n Mechanisms \n\nAssumptions  \nand Risks \n\n \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nI.

At its most basic level, distance education takes place when a teacher and student(s) \nare separated by physical distance, and technology (i.e., voice, video, data and print), often in \nconcert with face-to-face communication, is used to bridge the instructional gap. These types of \nprograms  can  provide  adults  with  a  second  chance  at  a  college  education,  reach  those \ndisadvantaged by limited time, distance or physical disability, and update the knowledge base of \nworkers at their places of employment. \n \nB. \n \nMany educators ask if distance students learn as much as students receiving traditional \n2. \nface-to-face  instruction.  Research  comparing  distance  education  to  traditional  face-to-face \ninstruction indicates that teaching and studying at a distance can be as effective as traditional \ninstruction, when the method and technologies used are appropriate to the instructional tasks, \nthere is student-to-student interaction, and when there is timely teacher-to-student feedback. \n \nC. \n \nA  wide  range  of  technological  options  are  available  to  the  distance  educator.  They  fall \n3. \ninto four major categories: voice, video, print and data. For data, computers send and receive \ninformation  electronically.  For  this  reason,  the  term  \"data\"  is  used  to  describe  this  broad \ncategory  of  instructional  tools.  Computer  applications  for  distance  education  are  varied  and \ninclude  (i)  computer-assistaed  instruction,  (ii)  computer-managed  instruction,  (iii)  computer-\nmediated  education  such  as  electronic  mail,  fax,  real-time  computer  conferencing,  and  World-\nWide Web applications. \n \nD. \n \n4. \nenterprise and the challenges they face. \n \n5. \neffective distance education program, and the test by which all efforts in the field are judged.  \n \nFaculty.  The success of any distance education effort rests squarely on the shoulders of \n6. \nthe faculty. In a traditional classroom setting, the instructor's responsibility includes assembling \ncourse content and developing an understanding of student needs. Special challenges confront \nthose teaching at a distance. For example, the instructor must (i) develop an understanding of \nthe  characteristics  and  needs  of  distant  students;  (ii)  adapt  teaching  styles  taking  into \nconsideration  the  needs  and  expectations  of  multiple,  often  diverse,  audiences;  (iii)  develop  a \nworking  understanding  of  delivery  technology,  while  remaining  focused  on  their  teaching  role; \nand (iv) function effectively as a skilled facilitator as well as content provider. \n \n7. \nFacilitators. The instructor often finds it beneficial to rely on a site facilitator to act as a \nbridge between the students and the instructor. To be effective, a facilitator must understand the \nstudents being served and the instructor's expectations. \n\nStudents.  Meeting  the  instructional  needs  of  students  is  the  cornerstone  of  every \n\nThe following briefly describes the roles of these key players in the distance education \n\nKey Players in the Distance \n\n\fAppendix 4          27 \n\nEDUCATION AND POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR ANALYSIS \n \n\nBackground \n\nA. \n \nSri  Lanka  has  always  had  a  strong  commitment  to  human  development  and  poverty \n1. \nreduction,  and  can  boast  of  wider  coverage  of  basic  social  services  than  other  countries  in \nSouth  Asia,  but  only  in  basic  education  (Figure  A3.1).  The  low  unit  costs,  efficient  allocation, \nand  high  volume  of  utilization  in  basic  education  are  not  present  in  postsecondary  education, \nwhere students are few and unit costs are high. In primary school (grades 1\u20136), 99% of the age \ncohort is enrolled. In lower secondary education (grades 7\u20139) about 90% is still enrolled. Only at \nthe end of grade 11 do the enrollment rates decline, as about half the students do not qualify to \ncontinue to grade 12. Those who complete grade 13 take a national examination to determine \nwho may enter university. About half the grade 12 students are successful (about 100,000, or \nless  than  25%  of  the  age  cohort).  What  happens  to  them?  About  15%  enter  conventional \nuniversities, while 5% go to Open University of Sri Lanka (OUSL) or technical colleges. About \n10% attend local private colleges (many are newly formed), 10% go abroad to study, and 10% \nenter  external  degree  programs  under  university  guidance  but  essentially  study  on  their  own \nand  pay  for  tutoring.  Hence,  50%  undertake  some  sort  of  study.  Of  the  remaining  50%,  about \n35% have jobs and 15% are unemployed while looking for work and waiting to gain entrance to \nschools.  The  Project  is  designed  to  increase  educational  opportunities  by  expanding  OUSL, \ndistance  learning,  and  public-private  sector  capacity  to  meet  the  social  demand  for \npostsecondary education. The above approximate percentages are complicated by the fact that \nstudents  from  previous  cohorts  also  sit  for  national  examinations  a  second  time,  and  so  a \nbacklog  of  youth  seeks  entrance  from  the  previous  years  while  the  general  trend  has  not \nchanged for the past 10 years (Figure A3.1). \n \nB. \n \nThe number of poor (those  in the lowest income quintile) do not normally graduate from \n2. \nhigh school. Approximate numbers derived from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) report on \npoverty reduction in Sri Lanka suggest that 95% of these poor are in primary school, about 35% \ncomplete  lower  secondary,  about  15%  make  it  through  upper  secondary,  but  about  20%  are \nfound in universities. University entrance is based on merit along with quotas for the rural poor. \nHowever,  many  rural  poor  do  not  receive  quality  education  and  do  not  do  well  on  national \nexaminations.  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  have  secondary  and  basic  education  projects  to  help \ncorrect this imbalance. \n \n3. \nThe  Project  will  address  access  of  the  poor  to  improve  postsecondary  education \nopportunities by increasing access to OUSL  Programs (Figure A3.2) regional centers, many of \nwhich are in provinces outside metro Colombo and Western Province. The Project will also help \nincrease  access  of  the  poor  to  distance  learning  through  multimedia  centers,  which  will  allow \nstudents to study,  receive  quality  materials,  and  have  access  to  a  tutor  on-line  (Figure  A3.3). \nHalf of OUSL students (10,000) study at about 20 regional centers and are expected to increase \nto  25,000  by  the  end  of  the  Project  (Table  A3.1).  New  sites  in  conflict  areas  and  in  poor \nplantation  districts  will  help  increase  enrollment  disproportionately.  About  2,000  scholarships \nannually will be provided to OUSL students to help cover their fees, and 65% will be provided to \nalso  geared  to  increase  educational  opportunities  for  sec ondary school graduates who do not \nenter  any  formal  institution  and  are  forced  to  become  external  degree  students.  About  1,000 \nannual stipends will be provided to these and OUSL students who are able to study on-line. The \nProject will support scholarships for needy students by offering incentives to private schools to \nincrease their support to poor students. \n\nRegional Distribution by Poverty Indexes and Gender \n\n\f \n28\n\nAppendix 4 \n\nThe Government Budget \n\nFemales exceed 50% of enrollment at all levels of education, facing not lack of access to \n4. \neducation  but  to  a  wide  range  of  academic  programs,  especially  in  the  sciences  and \nprofessions. After graduation, women do poorly in finding jobs in the areas for which they were \ntrained. The Project will provide student career guidance and job search. The Project will help \nfemale  students  think  strategically  about  their  educational  opportunities  and  prospects  and \nadvise them on how to get jobs. \n \n5. \nRural  areas  outside  the  Western  Province  and  metro  Colombo  are  generally \nunderserved,  especially  the  plantation  districts  in  the  highlands  and  conflict areas in the north \nand northeast. Postsecondary private institutions outside the towns are few and of poor quality. \nThrough a media awareness campaign, these institutions will be invited to upgrade facilities to \nincrease enrollment throughout Sri Lanka  and to encourage on-line study. Special attention will \nbe  given  to  upgrading  the  Jaffna  campus  and  connect  it  on-line to DEPP and to OUSL study \ncenters in conflict areas. \n \nIII. \n \n6. \nThe  Government  has  been  spending  around  3%  of gross domestic product (GDP) on \neducation for over 10 years. Higher education accounts for about 20% of this or 0.6% of GDP. \nFunds  for  higher  education  are  provided  through  the  University  Grants  Commission.  Budgets \nare  not  performance  based,  and  so  the  Project  will  help  introduce  new  procedures  of  zero-\nbased  budgeting  based  on  results  to  encourage  quality  improvement  through  demand-driven \nenrollment and competition. The education budget has not grown because of severe economic \nconstraints on the budget to keep the deficit from rising. The Government knows that enrollment \nin  postsecondary  education  must  be  increased  and  quality  raised  but  without  increasing  the \nbudget.  Innovative  ideas  must  be  found  to  increase  enrollment  while  guaranteeing  quality \nproducts. The Project will help streamline OUSL so it can double enrollment at minimum cost by \nemploying  contract  professors  and  technical  staff,  for  example,  and  using  on-line admissions, \ntutorials, and modern curriculum materials. The Project will develop DEPP to provide access to \nquality  programming  for  public  and  private  educational  institutions.  Special  assistance  will  be \nprovided to external degree students. Finally, the Project will introduce ways to support public-\nprivate partnerships so enrollment in private schools can meet some of the social demand that \nthe public sector cannot. The World Bank will help the formal university system, which is free \nand  underutilized,  and  unemployable  graduates.  The  ADB  Project  will  cater  to  postsecondary \ninstitutes  other  than  conventional  universities,  including  OUSL;  technical  colleges;  private \nnonprofit professional organizations such as the Ceylon Chemical Society, which wishes to train \nand  license  members;  and  private  for-profit  schools,  mostly  in  information  and  communication \ntechnology, business, and commerce. \n \n7. \nOUSL  enrolls  about  10,000  students  annually  in  certificate,  diploma,  and  degree \nprograms that provide a progressive ladder of opportunity to all students. OUSL also addresses \nthe need to transfer knowledge and skills developed in higher education to other sectors such \nas secondary education, teacher training, and continuous professional development of workers \nin many fields. Students pay fees at OUSL, because many are employed and do not qualify for \nfree  education.  The  fees  help  cover  the  nonsalary  recurrent  costs  and  allow  students  to  learn \non-line  through  print  media,  audio  and  video  multimedia,  and  soon,  distance  learning.  OUSL \nreached its capacity in 1998 when enrollment peaked due to lack of budget growth. Enrollment \ngrowth will stagnate until OUSL upgrades its admissions and accounting systems; core facilities; \nand  student  services  (university  press,  multimedia  center,  library,  management  information \nsystem, and educational technology division) to stay ahead of the knowledge curve and expand \noutreach to the towns and villages to become more client centered. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n29\n\nThe  rationale  for  OUSL  and  distance  learning  is  provision  of  public  goods,  especially \n8. \nsocial  services  for  those  in  remote  areas.  OUSL  courses  are  demand  driven,  as  most  public \nemployees  seek  to  improve  their  skills  through  them.  OUSL  is  an  in-service  provider  for  the \nGovernment and for private businesses with underdeveloped on-the-job training. OUSL needs \ngovernment  support  to  strengthen  the  public  service  workforce  in  towns  and  rural  areas;  to \nincrease the stock of knowledge; and to offer education and, eventually, economic mobility. \n \n\nFigure A3.1: Structure of Education in Sri Lanka \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \nLibrary \n\nEducational \nTechnology \nDivision \n\nRegional \nEducational \nServices \n\n \n\nOperations \nDivision \n\nInformation \nTechnology \nDivision \n\n \n\nInternal  \nAudit \n\n\u2022  Regional \n \ncenters  \n\u2022  Teaching \ncenters  \n \n\n\u2022  Printing Press \n \n \n \n\nFigure A3.2: Organizational Structure of OUSL \n \n \n \nCouncil \n \n \n\nVice-Chancellor \n\n \n30\n\nAppendix 4 \n\nFaculties and \nDepartments \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nEngineering  Technology \n\n\u2022  Civil Engineering \n\u2022  Electrical and Computer Engineering \n\u2022  Mechanical Engineering \n\u2022  Mathematics and Philosophy of Engineering \n\u2022  Textile and Apparel Technology \n\u2022  Agriculture and Plantation Engineering \n\nHumanities and Social Sciences \n\n\u2022  Education \n\u2022  Legal Studies  \n\u2022  Language Studies  \n\u2022  Management Studies  \n\u2022  Social Studies  \n\u2022  Early Childhood Education \n\nNatural Sciences \n\n \n\n\u2022  Botany \n\u2022  Chemistry \n\u2022  Health Sciences  \n\u2022  Mathematics and Computer Science \n\u2022  Physics  \n\u2022  Zoology \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nSenate \n\nAdministrative and \nFinancial Sections \n\n\u2022  Office of the \n  Registrar \n\u2022  Office of the  \n  Deputy Registrar \n \n\u2022  Academic \n\u2022  Examinations  \n\u2022  Student Affairs \n\u2022  Public Relations  \n\u2022  Establishments  \n\u2022  Capital Works \n\u2022  General Adminis tration \n\u2022  Security \n\u2022  Maintenance \n\u2022  Finance (Bursar) \n\u2022  Supplies  \n \n\n \n \n\n\fTable A3.1: OUSL Staff and Student Populations, 1999 \n \n\nAmpara \n\nSubtotal \n\n \nCenter \n\n \nCenter \n\n \nDistrict \n\nColombo \nKandy \nMatara \nJaffna \n \n\n \nStudents \n10,200 \n3,100 \n1,150 \n289 \n14,739 \n200 \n235 \n265 \n \n300 \n650 \n88 \n450 \n392 \n300 \n \n900 \n150 \n350 \n174 \n127 \n4,581 \n \n \n \n0 \n0 \n19,320 \n    Source: Open University of Sri Lanka Regional Education Department Report. 1999. \n\nColombo \nKandy \nMatara \nJaffna \n \nAmbalangoda  Galle \nAmpara \nAnuradhapura  Anuradhapura \nBadulla \nBandarawella \nBatticaloa \nButtala \nGalle \nKalutara \nKegalle \nKuliyapitiya \nKurunegala \nPolonnaruwa \nRatnapura \nTrincomale \nVavuniya \n \n \n \n \n \nColombo \n \n\nRegional \n \n \n \n \nStudy \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNew \nLocales  \n \n \n \n \n\nBadulla \nBadulla \nBatticaloa \nMonaragal \nGalle \nKalutara \nKegalle \nKurunegala \nKurunegala \nPolonnaruwa \nRatnapura \nTrincomale \nVavuniya \n \nGampaha \nHambantota \nHatton \n \n \n\n \nStaff \n22 \n31 \n9 \n1 \n63 \n6 \n \n5 \n \n5 \n4 \n1 \n4 \n1 \n5 \n \n9 \n5 \n4 \n \n \n49 \n \n \n \n0 \n0 \n112 \n\nSubtotal \nCampus Subtotal \n\nSubtotal \n\nTotal \n\n% of all \nStaff \n19.6 \n27.7 \n8.0 \n0.9 \n56.3 \n5.4 \n0.0 \n4.5 \n \n4.5 \n3.6 \n0.9 \n3.6 \n0.9 \n4.5 \n \n8.0 \n4.5 \n3.6 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n43.8 \n \n \n \n0.0 \n \n100.0 \n\n \n \nFigure A3.3: Main Components of a Typical Multimedia Center \n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n31\n\n% of all  \nStudents \n52.8 \n16.0 \n6.0 \n1.5 \n76.3 \n1.0 \n1.2 \n1.4 \n \n1.6 \n3.4 \n0.5 \n2.3 \n2.0 \n1.6 \n \n4.7 \n0.8 \n1.8 \n0.9 \n0.7 \n23.7 \n \n \n \n0.0 \n \n100.0 \n\nT V   a n d   V C R  \nV i e w i n g\n\nC o p m p u t e r   L a b\n\nV i r t u a l\n\n  L i b r a r y\n\nC o n n e c t o n s\n\na n d  \n\nN e t w o r k\n\nS e r v e r\n\nB o o k   S t o r e\n\nF M   R a d i o\n\nC y b e r   C a f e\n\nP r i n t\na n d  \n\n  o n   D e m a n d\nP h o t c o p y i n g\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f32\n\nAppendix 5 \n\nPolicy Change \nComponent 1: Establishment of DEPP to Raise Quality and Enhance Capacity \n\nPolicy Outcomes  \n\nPOLICY MATRIX OF REFORMS BY COMPONENT  \n\nA.

The task force \nwill  conduct  interviews  and  studies  and  recommend  ways  to  establish  a  framework  for \ncooperation among postsecondary education institutes under MTET. Cooperation is intended to \nincrease  the  effectiveness  of  public-private  partnerships  to  improve  postsecondary  education, \nraise standards, and help meet the social demand for postsecondary education. The  task force \nwill present policy recommendations to define rules and regulations on opening, operating, and \nclosing institutes; and providing accountability for maintaining academic standards, accreditation \nrequirements, and fair trade practices to protect students. To meet these goals, the  task force \nwill  review  applications  under  the  Project  submitted  by  public-private  partnerships  seeking \nmatching grants to strengthen institutional capacity to increase enrollment.  \n \n2. \nThe  Public-Private  Partnership  Matching  Grant  Program  is  designed  to  provide  a \nmaximum  of  $25,000  (50%  of  proposal  costs)  to  qualified  private  sector  institutes  requesting \nassistance to upgrade facilities. About 100 of 200 eligible private sector schools are expected to \nqualify.  To  qualify,  the  postsecondary  institute  has  to  be  a  licensed  school  in  operation  for  3 \nyears on its own premises and with at least 150 students studying for diplomas and/or degrees. \nThe proposal will include several features designed to help private institutes expand enrollment \ncapacity (and the poor student population) and raise the quality of programs, especially through \noutreach  to  small  towns  through  the  Internet.  The  specific  interventions  include  provision  of \n(i) information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  and  multimedia  for  computer  laboratories \nand  library  facilities;  (ii)  course  content  placement  on  the  web;  (iii)  foreign-domestic  link \nprograms  between  licensed  institutes  for  the  benefit  of  joint  access  to  curricula,  staff,  and \ndegree-granting privileges; and (iv) stipend programs to help qualified disadvantaged students \npay tuition fees.    \n \n3. \nProposals  must  prove  that  the  institute  is  fully  licensed,  indicate  the  activities  to  be \npursued, and show how the interventions will increase enrollment. Most important, the proposal \nmust  provide  details  on  the  school\u2019s  stipend  program  for  disadvantaged  students  and  indicate \nnames of students being assisted before the proposal application, and of persons to be assisted \nas  a  consequence  of  the  proposal.  Proposals  including  budgets  will  be  provided  to  the  task \nforce for review and recommendation for approval to MTET.  \n \n4. \nUpon  acceptance,  the  project  management  office  (PMO)  will  seek  three  bids  for  the \nproposal.  The  lowest  priced  offer  will  be  given  the  contract  to  provide hardware and furniture. \nThe PMO will pay the contractor upon certification that counterpart funds from the school have \nbeen received by the vendor. Funds for moving academic programs to the web and for setting \nup the foreign-domestic linkage will be paid upon receipt of contract. Tuition stipends for eligible \nstudents will be paid to the school at the beginning of every school term. The PMO will randomly \nand periodically monitor schools through the use of project consultants.  \n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\nB. \n \n\nDraft Proposal Format \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n35\n\nPUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP APPLICATION \nMinistry of Tertiary Education and Training \n\n \nDear Applicant: \n \nPublic  and  private  postsecondary  education  institutes  recognized  by  Ministry  of  Tertiary \nEducation  and  Training  (MTET)  may  apply  for  matching  grants  to  support  expansion  of \ninformation  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  and  multimedia  facilities  to  increase \nenrollment in bonafide diploma and degree courses offered to students in Sri Lanka.  \n \nThe MTET is accepting applications from qualified diploma- and degree-granting institutions in \nSri  Lanka  seeking  matching  grants  to  support  expansion  of  ICT,  distance  learning,  and \nmultimedia  services  for  students.  Grants  are  available  for  expansion  of  (i)  school  enrollment; \n(ii) course  programs  and  curriculum  to  the  web;  (iii)  link  programs  with  foreign  postsecondary \neducation institutions to share curriculum, staff, and degree recognition; and (iv) existing stipend \nprograms to include additional stipends for poor students who qualify but cannot afford tuition.  \n \nApplications and proposals will be accepted and screened by an advisory committee to MTET. \nThe committee will certify that each institute is a licensed diploma- or degree-granting institute \nable to provide quality academic programs. The committee will screen applications for accuracy \nand evaluate proposals for thoroughness before submitting applications to MTET for approval. \nApproved applications will be submitted to the project management office (PMO) to obtain three \nbids  from  suppliers,  with  the  lowest  bid  acceptable  to  MTET  and  the  private  institute.  (Public \ninstitutes  applying  under  the  program  will  receive  100%  grant  financing).

Infrastructure (roads, power, and ports) is important, but so are \nsmall or medium -sized  enterprise  development  and  policy  reform  to  stimulate  labor-intensive growth, especially in \ndownsizing  and  improving  the  efficiency  of  the  public  sector.  Social  development  supports  these  efforts  by \nstreamlining publicly financed social services, especially outside metro Colombo. A major improvement in access and \nrelevance  of  tertiary  training  is  required  for  upward  social  and  economic  mobility.  Tertiary  education  contributes  to \npoverty reduction by producing high-quality public servants and efficient managers for the private sector. The Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  will  help  the  Government  to  expand  access  to  students  from  low-income families, restructure \neducational  institutions  to  enhance  efficiency  and  relevance,  and  support  public-private partnerships, especially in \nconflict areas and plantation districts. \n \nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\nProposed Classification: Pro-Poor Economic \nDevelopment and Human Development  \n\nParticipation Process \n\nAnalysis: \nPoverty  in  Sri  Lanka  has  recently  increased  due  to  the  Asian  crisis.  At  least  25%  of  the  population  live  below  the \nconsumption  and  human  poverty  line,  and  mainly  in  rural  areas,  especially  highland  plantation  districts  and  in  the \nsocial conflict areas of the north and northeast, where up to 40% of the population are low income or displaced. Low-\nincome students are represented in universities, as students are selected based on merit and on need as defined by \nincome  and  residence.  All  students  in  conventional  universities  pay  no  fees  and  often receive stipends. In OUSL, \nstudents must pay fees and often do not receive stipends. Therefore, scholarships for low-income students at OUSL \nand    private  schools,  and  external  degree  students  studying  on  the  web  need  to  be  addressed  if  equity  is  to  be \npreserved  among  students.  The  Project  is  expected  to  promote  socioeconomic  mobility  needed  to  develop  the \neconomy outside Colombo. Special emphasis is placed on expanding the OUSL campus network to plantation areas \nand  conflict  areas.  The  Project  will  provide  for  activities  that  sharpen  the  delivery  of  public  goods,  increase  the \nefficiency of the labor market and educational system, and improve overall labor market efficiency, leading to higher \nwages.  The  Project  will  promote  economic  development  and  human  development,  but  neither  the  percentage  of \nfunds nor the absolute number of poor beneficiaries are sufficient to qualify the Project  as a core poverty or poverty \nintervention.  OUSL  is  a  cost-effective  means  to  increase  enrollment  of  the  educated  poor  in  key  fields  of  study \nnecessary for development of regional economies. \n \nC. \nStakeholder analysis prepared  \n \nParticipation strategy: \n \nStakeholder analysis found that approximately 80,000 students annually will enroll in the project institutions by project \ncompletion, up from 40,000. Most beneficiaries will live in small towns outside Colombo. The Project will help meet \nthe social demand for postsecondary education and help rationalize cost sharing so that efficiencies can be increased \nand  more  students  served.    The  participation  strategy  followed  during  project  processing  included  extensive \nworkshops  and  consultations  with  public-private  employers  such  as  the  Ceylon  Chamber  of  Commerce, \nnongovernment organizations, funding agencies, students, faculty senates, government policymakers, and educators. \nProject  implementation  units  will  include  advisory  committees  represented  by  public  and  private  stakeholders  to \nscreen  activities,  while  follow-up  surveys,  tracer  studies,  and  workshops  will  allow  monitoring  of  impacts  on \nbeneficiaries. \n \nD. \n \n \nSubject \nResettlement \nGender \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nSignificant,  \nNot Significant, \nNone \n\n \nOutput \nPrepared \n\nNone \nNot significant \n\nSocial Issues \n\nNone \nNo \n\nYes  \n\nYes  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nCareer guidance will target female students to select \nprograms based on job prospects and become familiar \nwith searching for jobs after graduation. \n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \n \nSubject \nAffordability \n\nSignificant,  \nNot Significant, \nNone \n\nNot significant \n\nLabor \n\nNot significant \n\nIndigenous  \nPeople \n\nNot significant \n\nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n\nNot significant \n\n \nOutput \nPrepared \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \nThe Project will involve cost sharing, but the beneficiaries \nalready participate, and so meeting fee generation targets \nis highly likely and sufficient to meet the recurrent costs \nafter project completion. \nThe Project will support improving relevant skills that raise \nwages for educated labor, which has implications for social \nand economic mobility in support of development. \nEfforts will be made to support plantation districts and \nsocial conflict areas where poverty is above average and \npeople generally isolated from mainstream opportunities. \nTechnical capacity to promote information flow in and \noutside Sri Lanka is limited, but the Project will provide \nresources to address these issues, especially through \ninternational experts and funds to train local staff, and \nfunds to support foreign-local link programs. \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nClient Groups \n\n \nE. \n \n1. \nThe  client  target  of  the  Distance  Education  Modernization  Project  is  the  new  A-level \ngraduate who cannot qualify or who elects not to go to a public university. In 2000, 183,439 sat \nfor  the  general  certificate  examination  (A-level),  and  91,589  (47.6%)  qualified  to  enter  the \nuniversities.  The  12  conventional  universities  have  only  about  12,000  places  for  A-level \ngraduates,  leaving  more  than  79,000  young  people  qualifying  for  admission  but  unable  to \nsecure  a  seat.  A  6-month  backlog  of  students  is  awaiting  admission to the universities due to \nproblems  with  the  selection  system.  Thus,  the  average  university  graduate  is  28  years  old. \nModernization  of  postsecondary  education  will  also  benefit  adult  O-level  graduates  and \nemployed  adults  seeking  higher  education  subjects,  certificates,  diplomas,  and  degrees. \nSubgroups selected for special benefit are poor and low-income A-level graduates and women, \nrural  A-level  graduates,  those  confined  to  the  disputed  territories,  underemployed young adult \nA-level graduates, refugees, and the physically disabled. \n\n2. \nThe  Project  will  address  access,  relevance,  equity,  and  efficiency.  Accessibility entails \nsuch  proposals  as  scholarships  for  the  poor,  increased  capacity,  outreach  of  academic \nprograms, and increased student mobility between institutions and through various educational \nlevels  from  diplomas  to  degrees.  Relevance  addresses  improved  employability  of  graduates. \nQuality  addresses  the  need  to  strengthen  institutions  and  provide  improved  curricula  to  world-\nclass  standards  and  employer  needs.  Efficiency  provides  improved  student  ability to complete \nprograms  through  more  effective  instructional  methodologies  and  assessment,  lower  delivery \ncosts  within  institutions,  and  meaningful  employment  upon  graduation.  The  socioeconomic \nprofile of the population to be affected by the Project ranges from the new A-level graduate (the \nprimary  target  client)  to  the  employed  adult  who  seeks  to  upgrade qualifications and skills to \nprogress along an existing career path or seek a new one. \n \n3. \nAdmission to state universities is fairly well distributed among districts, due mostly to a \ngovernment  policy  that  takes  only  30%  of  entrants  on  merit.  The  rest  are  quotas  (55%) \ndistributed on district basis, and on the basis of underprivileged areas (15%). Females dominate \nthe arts stream, while engineering-related streams are dominated by males, due mostly to social \nconstraints.  Internal  strife  hampers  the  mobility  of  A-level  graduates,  especially  in  disputed \nterritories,  to  travel  to  educational  institutions  in  the  south,  particularly  Colombo.  However,  A-\nlevel examinations have been conducted uninterrupted even in war-torn areas. Of about 7,250 \nA-level graduates annually in the disputed sectors, only 1,800 are accommodated in the public \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n51\n\nhigher  education  system,  and  an  estimated  2,000  by  private  higher  education  providers.  An \nestimated 2,000 students go abroad for bachelor-level education.  \n \n4. \nUnemployment  is  down  to  about  8%  but  is  expected  to  rise  with  the  current  economic \nslump.  The  highest  unemployment  rate  is  among  urban  job  seekers  and  A-level  graduates \n(22.4%)  who  seek  jobs  as  well  as  further  education.  However,  in  absolute  terms,  most  of  the \nunemployed (81%) are in the rural regions, especially youth (15\u201329 years old) who went up to \ngrades 9 and 10.1 The country has been struggling with the effects of youth unemployment and \neducation  mismatch  for  decades.  If  anything,  it  has  accelerated  with  the  demands  of  the  new \neconomy  for  information  technology  (IT),  basic  literacy,  and  English.  The  poor  and  rural  poor \nhave  been  left  behind  in  the  rush  for  English  and  IT  literacy,  as  demonstrated  by  the  large \nnumber  of  schools  without  electricity  and  with  undertrained  and  undereducated  teachers.  The \nmedium of instruction for IT is English, so that the few students who achieve A-levels among the \nurban  and  rural  poor  are  faced  with  the  onerous  and  costly  task  of  acquiring,  usually  at  great \nexpense, English as a second language and IT training. Studies done by ADB on employability \nof Sri Lankan graduates have identified a set of attributes preferred by employers. The private \nsector  prefers  graduates  who  are  English-speaking  and  literate  in  office  IT,  and  with  a  work \nethic, which seems often lacking in public university graduates.  \n \n5. \nAdding  to  the  problems  of  the  poor  is  lack  of  access  to  the  better  programs offered at \npostsecondary  education  institutions.  The  shortage  of  seats  at  the  public  universities  for  free \ntuition  of  A-level  scholars  is  being  addressed  by  the  World  Bank  and  by  the  development \npolicies of the Government. The current backlog may be alleviated by 2004, as universities have \nbegun  to  take  in  double  batches.  The  capacity  to  absorb  students  is  expected  to  rise  from  its \npresent  2%  of  A-level  qualified  graduates  to  4\u20135%.  Adding  to  the  potential  to  absorb  A-level \ngraduates is the possible expansion of the Open University of Sri Lanka (OUSL), the potential \nexpansion of the Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technical Education (SLIATE), and the private \nhigher  education  diploma  and  degree-granting  capacity  institutions  increasing  capacity  from \n5,000 to 30,000 students.2 \n \n6. \nMany  underemployed  A-level  graduates  wish  to  proceed  to  higher  education  and  seek \npart-time education to upgrade. A government initiative encouraging public universities to create \nexternal  degree  programs,  and  the  right  of  a  student  to  challenge  examinations  for  a  degree, \nhave  the  potential  to  enable  public  universities  to  absorb  many  of  the  students.  External \ndegrees  have  helped  create  spin-off  private  institutions  tutoring  students  for  the  university \nexams.  Tutoring  has  been  very  successful  in  IT,  with  examinations  offered  by  the  Institute  of \nComputer Technology Institute of the University of Colombo. Over 9,000 students preparing for \nthem are studying mainly at private IT schools. University Grants Commission statistics indicate \n167,000 students are enrolled in external degree programs offered by six public universities.  \n \nF. \n \n7. \nStudents  are  determined  to  enroll  in  programs  despite  the  bureaucratic  hurdles  of  the \npublic institutions. For example, it is not uncommon for students to forgo a day\u2019s pay and travel \n3\u20134  hours  just  to  stand  in  line  to  enroll  in  an  OUSL  program.  The  system  is  too  process \noriented, and not as student friendly as it should be. A-level graduates tend to migrate from rural \n\nClient Demand \n\n                                                                 \n1  Educational Consultants Ltd., 1989.

These figures do not consider certificate programs shorter than 1 \n\nyear.  \n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 14 \n\nareas to Colombo, seeking jobs and education. Those from poor families have to find jobs and \nstudy part time. The assumption is that the better-quality education is in Colombo. \n\nAbsorptive Capacity \n\n8. \nTypical  young  A-level  graduates  who  leave  their  poor  rural  families  and  move  to  an \nurban center are faced first with having to earn a living. Typically, their income level is Rs3,000\u2013\n7,000  per  month.  Private  sector  education  costs  are  significant,  ranging  from  Rs5,000  to  over \nRs8,000/month,  plus  living  expenses,  estimated  at  a  minimum  of  Rs2,000\u20133,500/month. \nStudents  prefer  to  study  English  and  IT  basic  skills.  Focus  group  sessions  with  A-level \ngraduates  from  poor  families  indicated  a  lack  of  knowledge  of  career  opportunities,  thus \nsubstantiating  the  Government\u2019s  focus  on  introducing  career  and  employment  counseling. \nStudents  were  unaware  of  education  opportunities  outside  programs  offered  by  the  public \nuniversities\u2014that is, training opportunities provided by OUSL, SLIATE, and other providers such \nas the Hotel School. Focus groups also indicated a desire for short training courses that would \nhelp graduates get jobs quickly. Once employed, graduates tend to seek part-time education to \ndevelop a career path.  \n \nG. \n \n9. \nProject benefits can be enhanced through improved linkages between public and private \nsector  institutions  and  the  provision  of  mobility  for  students  to  advance  from  technical/ \nvocational  certificate  programs  to  diploma  and  degree  programs.  Provided  that  the  quality  of \nprograms  is  enhanced,  expansion  of  programming  at  SLIATE  and  OUSL  can  be  affected \nthrough  linkages  with  the  private  sector,  emulating  the  Institute  of  Computer  Technology, \nUniversity  of  Colombo  external  degree  program.  The  quality  of  the  public  and  lesser  private \ninstitutions can be enhanced by adoption of a quality accreditation system, such as ISO 9002, \nwhich  has  been  achieved  by  the  Marine  School,  or  by  international  accreditation  linkages. \nPrograms must meet world standards to enhance graduate mobility. \n \nExternal community organizations that can support the project are the local and national \n10. \nchambers  of  commerce.  The  three  major  chambers\u2014Ceylon,  Federal,  and  the  Federation  of \nChambers  of  Commerce\u2014are  willing  to  encourage  educational  opportunities  for  A-level \ngraduates and help with educational surveys. Public and private participation in programs such \nas  work  experience  for  graduates  has  a  good  track  record.  These  partnerships  could  be  co-\nopted to participate in student loan and scholarship projects. Representatives interviewed from \nprofessional  associations\u2014accounting,  marketing,  architecture,  chemistry,  engineering,  and  IT \nschool associations\u2014are interested in improving the quality of education and accessibility for A-\nlevel graduates. The spirit of cooperation is high.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n 53\n\nECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION \n\n \n1. \nSri Lanka boasts some of the region\u2019s better human development indicators. In 1997, its \nliteracy rate was 92%; in 1995, the primary gross enrolment rate was above 90%, and the gross \nsecondary enrolment rate was 75%. At the tertiary level, however, only 5% of the relevant age \ngroup was enrolled. Dividends from the peace process, the country\u2019s rising industries, and the \nchanging  global  economy  necessitate  providing  greater  access \nto  and  strengthening \npostsecondary education, and a closer match between education and training and labor market \nneeds to provide the required skill mix. \n \n2. \nRecent labor statistics indicate that the overall unemployment rate is 8%. Unemployment \namong  females  is  double  that  among  males,  and  gender  parity  has  not  been  attained  in \neducation. The economic structure is changing. The Sri Lankan labor force is characterized by a \nlarge but declining share of agriculture, with a shift away from employment in the primary sector \nto  the  secondary1  and  tertiary2  sectors.  Workers  are  moving  more  to  self-  and  private \nemployment  and  away  from  the  public  sector.  A  distinctive  feature  of  unemployment  in  Sri \nLanka is its high incidence among educated persons (14.6% for those with A-level qualifications \nand  above);  the  unemployment  rate  was  less  among  those  with  lower  qualifications  (0.5%  for \nthose with no schooling and 1.9% for those who attended to grades 2\u20134). This pattern is partly \ndue  to  the  conventional  education  system  with  its  traditional  courses  that  do  not  cater  to  the \nemerging demands of the labor market, especially in computer science, financial management, \nmarketing,  and  English  language;  and  partly  due  to  a  mismatch  between  expectations  and \nopportunities  based  on  the  educational  qualifications  and  achievements of the prospective job \nseekers.  The  trend  to  more  skilled  occupations  has  contributed  to  rising  income  levels.  To \nmaintain this momentum, education and training systems need adapt to the changing pattern of \ndemand in the labor market. \n \n3.   \nThe  Project.  The  Project  has  three  components:  (i)  developing  a  modern  distance \neducation system through partnerships to increase access and raise the quality of programs at \nthe  Open  University  of  Sri  Lanka  (OUSL)  and  other  public  and  private  postsecondary \ninstitutions;  (ii)  supporting  greater  coordination  and  efficiency  among  public  and  private \npostsecondary  institutions  in  Sri  Lanka  and  abroad,  including  job  awareness  campaigns  and \ncareer guidance activities; and (iii) building the capacity of OUSL to expand access and improve \nthe  quality  and  relevance  of  higher  education.  A  relevant  curriculum  will  increase  students' \nemployment potential and serve emerging labor market needs.  \n \nProject  Benefits.  The  Project  will  increase  the  educated  and  skilled  labor  force \n4. \nnecessary to changing requirements for economic development. The Project will (i) expand the \ncapacity of nonconventional higher education institutions to increase postsecondary enrolment, \n(ii) provide quality learning for external degree students, (iii) improve the quality of learning, and \n(iv)  provide  relevant  higher  education.  The  major  project  beneficiaries  will  be  postsecondary \nstudents,  specifically  A-level  graduates  who,  although  qualified \nto  enter  conventional \nuniversities,  are  left  out  for  lack  of  space.  Demand  is  high  for  postsecondary  places  as \nevidenced  by  the  number  of  graduates  who  apply  and  are  rejected,  and  by  the  growing \nenrolment  of  external  degree  students.  Project  benefits  are  calculated  in  terms  of  working-life \nincremental income earned as a consequence of obtaining postsecondary education.  \n \n5. \nOUSL. Capacity building to increase access and improve quality at OUSL will increase \nadmissions  of  university-qualified  students.  Enrollment  at  OUSL  is  expected  to  increase  to \n                                                 \n1  Secondary sectors include manufacturing and construction. \n2  Tertiary sectors include trade, electricity, transport and communications, banking and finance, and other services. \n\n\f \n\n54\n\nAppendix 15 \n\n40,000 from the current 20,000 in approximately 10 years. Structural changes in the economy \nfavoring more skilled and educated people will reinforce this trend. Due to competing demands \non students\u2019 time,3 and partly due to poor OUSL resources, the completion rate4 during 1997\u2013\n2000  was  7%  against  the  universities\u2019  19.8%.  Activities  to  improve  the  quality  of  learning, \nmodernize and rationalize the resources of OUSL, and streamline admissions and accreditation \nare expected to double completion rates to 14.1% in 12 years. Completion rates of nondegree \nstudents are expected to increase from the 1997-2000 average of 13.7% to 17.4% in 12 years. \nCompletion rates are expected to be higher in nondegree programs, which are typically shorter \nthan degree programs.  \n \n6. \nAs  most  of  OUSL\u2019s  students  are  already  employed,  their  employment  rate  should  be \nabove the national rate of 92.3%. For present calculations, however, the initial employment rate \nis  assumed  to  be  the  same  as  for  A-level  graduates  and  to  improve  to  equal  the  national \nemployment  rate  in  7  years.  Employed  students  will  experience  an  increment  in  their  annual \nremunerations.  The  estimated  2002  average  nominal  wage  of  A-level  graduates  is  $1,580; \nthose with less than a degree, $1,708; and degree holders, $2,907.5 Students\u2019 working lives are \nconservatively  estimated  at  20  years.  As  a  consequence  of  the  ongoing  peace  talks  and  the \ngeneral optimism of an accord being reached, Sri Lanka\u2019s economy is poised to grow quickly in \nthe medium term. Given that this project will increase skilled and educated labor and will align it \nto structural changes and the needs of the economy, and that peace is expected to reign, the \neconomy is expected to grow rapidly and labor to be productive. For the calculations here, the \ngrowth rate of real wages is assumed to peak at a conservative 8% in 8 years and to decline \nthereafter.6 \n \nEven at the improved \u201ccompletion rates,\u201d many students will still not be able to complete \n7.  \ntheir  degrees  in  4  years.  Before  program  completion,  however,  students  will  increase  their \nproductivity,  and  remuneration  structures  normally  reward  additional  education  and  training \nreceived.  Thus,  without  completing  their  degrees,  some  working  students  will  receive \nincrements to receive \u201cless than a degree\u201d incomes.  \n \n8. \nDistance  Education  Partnership  Program.  Multimedia  center-based  education  will \nprovide  a  useful  venue  for  postsecondary  classes  addressing  the  needs  of  external  degree \nstudents.  Access  to  syllabi,  course  materials,  course  reviews,  and  related  materials  will  be \nprovided.  In  1998,  of  the  104,000  students  enrolled,  only  2.14%  received  their  degrees.  By \n2001, enrolment had grown to 166,000. Under this component, an estimated additional 25,000 \nstudents  per  year  will  be  served  by  year  10.  External  degree  graduates  are  assumed  to  be \nemployed in the same pattern as OUSL graduates.  \n \n9.   \nPublic-Private Partnerships. Through the public-private partnership component, funds \nwill  be  granted  on  a  matching  basis  to  about  100  private  postsecondary  institutes  to  improve \ntheir  quality  and  increase  access.  Government  training  institutes  (Sri  Lanka  Institute  of \nAdvanced  Technical  Education)  and  other  nonprofit  institutes  will  also  receive  an  equivalent \namount. Smaller institutions are more agile and can implement improvements more quickly than \n\n                                                 \n3  About 75% of OUSL\u2019s students are already employed. \n4  The completion rate is calculated as the proportion of enrolled students who are awarded degrees (or certificates \n\nor diplomas) in a given academic year to the total enrolment in the same academic year. \n\n5  In  1997,  average  nominal  wage  of  A-level  graduates  was  SLRs103,356;  those  with  less  than  a  degree, \nSLRs111,744; and degree holders, SLRs190,176. These were inflated to 2002 estimates using inflation rates and \nconverted into dollars at the forecast 2002 exchange rates. \n\n6  The  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  has  projected  real  per  capita  income  to  grow  at  an  average of 5.7% annually in \n2000\u20132005,  and  10%  annually  in  2005\u20132010.  Real  wages  are  expected  to  grow  incrementally  and  track  these \nprojections. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n 55\n\ntraditional  structures,  and  will  thus  be  able  to  enroll  more  students.  An  additional  25,000 \nstudents  per  year  will  be  enrolled  by  year  10.  Their  completion  rates  are  assumed  to  be  the \nsame as that of OUSL students. This assumption, however, may be pessimistic in view of the \ndifferent student composition in these institutions, and because fees, which are close to full cost \nrecovery, are being charged.  \n \n10. \nThe  Project  will  improve  long-term  higher  education  capacity  and  quality,  and  not  just \nduring project implementation. Increases in enrollment and improvements in learning quality are \nexpected  to  be  sustained  beyond  the  project  period.  Project  benefits  are  calculated  until  year \n20.  \n \n11. \nAbsorptive Capacity. The project will increase enrollment by about 70,000 places per \nyear in 10 years, which is likely to be short of the future demand. About 140,000 students sit for \nthe  A-level  examinations  every  year.    At  the  end  of  the  5-year  implementation  period  of  the \nAsian Development Bank Secondary Education Modernization Project, the annual number of A-\nlevel  graduates  sitting  for  the  A-level  examinations  is  expected  to  increase  to  about  190,000. \nAssuming that the pass rate of about 50% is maintained, about 95,000 students should qualify \nannually  for  the  university.  If  everyone  enrolled  for  postsecondary  education,  360,000  total \nplaces  would  be  needed  for  any  given  school  year  assuming  25%  of  all  those  enrolled  would \ncomplete their programs and no one drops out. (Lower completion rates will further increase the \ntotal  student  places  required.)  As  of  1997  (not  much  different  from  2002),  the  estimated  total \ncapacity of the postsecondary system7 was about 166,000. If all who qualify enroll, the  gap will \nbe  about  194,000;  if  three  quarters,  then  104,000.  Demand  for  postsecondary  education  is \ndemonstrated  by  the  number  and  growth  rate  of  external  degree  enrollment.  Of  the  1997 \nenrollment, 104,000 students were working for an external degree; they grew by 10% from 1997 \nto  1998.  The  student  places  are  not  sufficient  to  meet  the  current  and  projected  increased \ndemand  in  the  traditional  university  sector  and  the  requirements  of  the  evolving  economy,  so \nother parts of the postsecondary education system must thus expand. \n \n12. \nProject  Costs.  The  economic  costs  of  the  project  include  project  investment, \nincremental recurrent costs of the Government, and opportunity costs of students\u2019 time. Since \nmost  OUSL  students  are  employed  and  take  some  time  off  from  their  work  to  study,  their \nopportunity costs are assumed to be 25% of the average A-level wage. The Distance Education \nPartnership Program (DEPP) and public-private partnership students are assumed to be close \nto  the  beginning  of  their  age-wage  profile;  their  opportunity  costs  are  thus  assumed  to  be  at \n80% of the average A-level wage. In the case of DEPP external degree students, authorities are \nuncertain  of  the  number  of  active  students  until  they  register  for  examinations  again;  in  this \nconnection, opportunity costs are calculated only for the change in number of those completing \neach  year,  and  students  are  assumed  to  have  spent  4  years  preparing  for  their  degree \nexamination. \n \n13. \ninternal rate of return analysis are as follows: \n \n\nEconomic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis. The assumptions of the economic \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\nOUSL enrolment will increase from 20,000 to 40,000 by year 10. \nOUSL completion rates will increase from 7% to 14.1% in 12 years. \nOUSL  nondegree  completion  rates  will  increase  from  13.7%  to  17.4%  in  12 \nyears. \nGrowth rate of real wages will peak at 8% in 8 years and decline thereafter. \nMultimedia centers will enroll 25,000 external students by year 10. \n\n                                                 \n7  The postsecondary system includes public institutions and private institutions that serve external degree students. \n\n\f \n\n56\n\nAppendix 15 \n\n(vi) \n\nPublic-private partnerships will enroll 25,000 students by year 10. \n\n \n14. \nThe calculated economic internal rate of return is 23% (Table A14.1). Sensitivity analysis \nis in Table A14.2. If Sri Lanka\u2019s economy does not grow as expected such that real wages are \nfixed at the estimated 2002 levels, the Project will generate the lower EIRR of 15%. In the event \nthat capacity building at OUSL is not as successful as expected, (i) if the increase in enrollment \nis  8,574  instead  of  20,000,  the  EIRR  will  shrink  to  15%;  and  (ii)  if  OUSL  completion  rates \nimprove to 10.9% instead of 14%, the EIRR will shrink to 14%. Where the assumption relating to \nthe  DEPP\u2019s  impact  on  external  students\u2019  completion  rates  is  less  than  expected,  such  that  it \ngrows  to  4.1%  instead  of  7%,  the  EIRR  will  slightly  decrease  to  22%.  If  the  cost  of  the \ninvestment project increases by 20%, the EIRR will decrease to 21%.

The growth is reinforced by \nlow population growth and deficit reduction that has kept the economy stable over the past 10 \nyears in spite of severe external shocks. The government budget grew at about 5% per annum \nas the Government reduced expenditures by selling off parastatals and reducing social benefits \nnot targeted specifically at the poor. Prospects for continued growth look good once the social \nconflict is resolved and the global economy picks up.  \n \nThe education budget has remained fairly constant at about 3% of GDP for the past 10 \n2. \nyears, with about 20% going for capital costs funded mostly by external borrowing. The budget \nis  slightly  skewed  toward  the  upper  end  of  the  education  pyramid,  with  40%  going  to  primary, \n20% to secondary, and 20% to higher education; and 20% to teacher education, administration, \netc. The key education financing issues facing Sri Lanka center on the no-growth scenario for \nbudget funding and the need for cost sharing under these circumstances in tertiary education, \nwhich has traditionally been provided for free. If the formal conventional university system were \nnot small, the system would clearly be unsustainable. \n \n3. \nTables  A15.1,  and  A15.2  provide  information  on  the  financial  sustainability  of  project \nimpact  on  the  overall  national  budget  and  the  education  budget,  especially  for  the  recurrent \nportion. These percentages are small and indicate that the project will not adversely impact the \nbudget either during or after project completion. The impact on the university portion of the total \neducation budget can be simply estimated by hand because the university portion is 20% each \nfor the recurrent and routine education budgets. Again, the impact will not be unusually large.  \n \n\nTable A15.1: Indicative Budgetary Implications \n\n \nItem \n1.  Government Share in Project \n2.  Total Education Budgeta \n3.
