The  project  will  support  the  procurement  of  equipment  and  supplies,  the \nupgrading  of  health  and  testing  facilities,  and  build  system  and  community  capacities  for \nsurveillance, prevention, and response to COVID-19.  \n  \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe description of the COVID-19 health emergency. The COVID-19 outbreak, declared \na  pandemic  by  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  on  11  March  2020,  has  spread  rapidly \nacross the globe, with severe impact on lives and economies. As of 17 April 2020, over 2 million \nconfirmed cases and over 139,000 deaths have been recorded.1 In Bangladesh, the first case \nwas reported on 8 March 2020. Cases started rising steeply in April, and by 17 April, Bangladesh \nhad  confirmed  1,838  cases  and  75  deaths  due  to  COVID-19,  with  a  cumulative  total  of  over \n108,000  people  quarantined.2  The  country  is  now  moving  to  the  fourth  stage  of  infection \n(community transmission) with 52 of the 64 districts affected. Millions had already left the cities \nfor their village homes before the lockdown on 26 March, possibly spreading the infection. It is, \ntherefore, crucial to support Bangladesh\u2019s efforts to mitigate the impact and flatten the curve.  \n \n4. \nRequest  for  emergency  assistance.  On  23  March  2020,  the  government  asked  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to provide emergency assistance for the health sector response \nto COVID-19, as an integral part of the Country Preparedness and Response Plan (CPRP),3 and \nthe National Preparedness and Response Plan (NPRP)  for COVID-19 (para. 7).4 Since then, the \ncaseload  has  grown  more  than  55  times.  The  proposed  project  meets  the  requirements  for \nemergency assistance loan (EAL) financing.5 A health EAL is justified since (i) it will support the \nurgent need of the health system to immediately respond to the escalating COVID-19 situation; \n(ii)  the  government  has  immediate  procurement  requirements;  (iii)  dedicated  funding  for  the \ncritical  health  sector  response  will  be  assured;  and  (iv)  the  health  sector  requires  significant \ncapacity and implementation support in the short to medium term. Complementary health sector \nsupport is also being extended by the World Bank and World Health Organization (WHO) (para. \n12). The project is part of ADB emergency support for other sectors in Bangladesh (para. 14).  \n \n\n \n\n1    Worldometer.  https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ (accessed 17 April 2020); World Health Organization (WHO). \nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Reports. https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-\n2019/situation-reports (accessed 17 April 2020). \n\n2     Coronavirus COVID-19 Dashboard, 2020.

ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nSignificant  challenges  in  combatting  the  pandemic.  High  population  density,6  rapid \n5. \nurbanization, a large population of migrant workers, and more than 20% of its urban population \nliving  in  slums  without  adequate  sanitation,  make  Bangladesh  vulnerable  to  infectious  disease \noutbreaks. For example, cholera affects an estimated 100,000 people and causes some 4,500 \ndeaths  yearly.7  According  to  WHO\u2019s  scale  of  International  Health  Regulations  (IHR)  core \ncapacities,  Bangladesh  has  limited  capacity  to  prevent,  detect,  and  respond  to  public  health \nemergencies.8  Overall,  the  health  system  is  underdeveloped  and  underfunded,  with  only  9.9 \ndoctors,  nurses  and  midwives9  and  8.8  hospital  beds  per  10,000  people.10  Current  health \nexpenditure is only 2.3% of gross domestic product, while out-of-pocket expenditure accounts for \nover two-thirds of health spending, making healthcare unaffordable to many.11 Following the first \ncase on 8 March 2020, the government allocated Tk500 million (about $6 million) to the Ministry \nof Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) to contain the outbreak, followed by Tk2 billion (about \n$24 million) on 24 March 2020. \n \n\nDamage and needs assessment.12 The impacts of the damage to the health system and \n6. \nthe need for support were assessed by ADB, WHO, and other development partners. The damage \nand  needs  assessment  found  weaknesses  and  risks  in  four  main  areas\u2014surveillance  and \ndiagnostic  capacity,  testing  and  contact  tracing,  clinical  treatment  capacity,  and  infection \nprevention  and  control  (IPC).  First,  the  surveillance  and  diagnostic  capacity  is  rapidly \nbecoming overstretched. The testing capacity was extended from one to 17 laboratories, as of 17 \nApril  2020.13  However,  even  with  this  capacity,  the  health  system  will  scarcely  cope  with  the \nplanned screening of suspected COVID-19 cases at all 42 points-of-entry (air, sea, and land), as \nwell  as  surveillance  and  diagnosis  within  the  country.  Second,  insufficient  testing  and \ninadequate  contact  tracing  and  quarantine  measures  mean  that  the  full  extent  of  cases  is \nunknown. A total of 19,193 tests have been conducted as of 17 April 202014 (or 117 tests per \nmillion  population).  Third,  the  clinical  treatment  capacity  is  inadequate,  with  shortages  of \nventilators to support critical patients, insufficient specialized wards and hospitals, low hospital \nbed capacity (para. 5), and only 878 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 296 intermediate care unit \nbeds nationally available across public and private sectors.15 Reportedly, suspected COVID-19 \npatients were turned away from health facilities due to such inadequacies. In addition, there is a \nneed for contracting-in, recruitment, and training of human resources (such as medical officers, \nnurses,  medical  technologists,  etc.).  Fourth,  the  inadequacy  of  IPC  measures  poses  a  risk. \nReports  from  the  field  indicate  shortages  in  personal  protective  equipment  (PPE)  and  other \nsupplies, and insufficient sanitized ambulances to transport patients.16  \n\n \n\n6   Bangladesh has 1,253 people per square kilometer of land area, among the highest density in the world.

The  CPRP,  prepared  by  the  government  and  development \npartners to support the NPRP, is estimated at $378 million. It has five pillars: (i) surveillance and \nlaboratory support; (ii) contact tracing and points of entry; (iii) case management and infection \nprevention and control; (iv) risk communication and awareness and community engagement; and \n(v) logistics and procurement. The NPRP has seven components: (i) planning and coordination; \n(ii)  surveillance,  laboratory,  and  points  of  entry; (iii)  contact tracing  and  quarantine;  (iv) clinical \ncase management; (v) IPC; (vi) risk communication and public awareness; and (vii) operational \nresearch. The damage and needs assessment, the NPRP, and the CPRP together informed the \ngovernment\u2019s request for assistance to each development partner (para. 11).  \n \nDisaster  risk.17  Bangladesh  is  highly  susceptible  to  various  types  of  natural  hazards, \n8. \nincluding cyclones, flooding, landslides, windstorms, heat waves, and cold spells. Climate change \nis expected to aggravate the intensity, frequency, and unpredictability of extreme weather events. \nThe 2019 World Risk Index ranks Bangladesh as the 10th most vulnerable country among 180 \ncountries.18 Disease outbreaks often follow natural disasters.  \n \nEconomic impacts. ADB estimates19 indicate that a significant domestic outbreak would \n9. \nlead to an economic loss of up to $13.3 billion, 4.9% of gross domestic product, and the loss of \n1.4 million to 3.7 million jobs. The pandemic will affect the economy through three main channels: \nslowdown in domestic economies, sharp decline in exports, and reduction in remittances.20 \n \n10. \nPoverty impacts. With 20.5% of the population under the poverty line, and 10.5% living \nin  extreme  poverty  (FY2019),21  Bangladesh  is  especially  vulnerable  to  economic  shocks.  Any \neconomic shock would push a significant proportion of the near-poor under the poverty line and \ndeepen the poverty of those already poor, reversing previous gains made in poverty reduction. \nOf the total workforce, 85% (of whom 92% are women) operate in the informal economy, leading \na hand-to-mouth existence.22 Social distancing and quarantine measures will affect the livelihoods \nof small traders, day laborers, and other informal workers. The official unemployment rate is 4.3%. \nHowever,  many  employed  in  the  ready-made  garment  sector  and  micro,  small,  and  medium \nenterprises  may  already  have  lost  their  jobs,  and  economic  downturn  will  further  dampen  the \nemployment market. The poor are especially vulnerable to infectious diseases such as COVID-\n19, due to overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, and poor access to health services.  \n \n11. \nDevelopment  partners  coordination.  Development  partners  are  supporting  the \nresponse  and  are  part  of  the  National  Coordination  Committee  for  Prevention  and  Control  of \nCOVID-19, chaired by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). The government has \nset  up  the  COVID-19  Emergency  Operation  Center  at  the  Institute  of  Epidemiology,  Disease \nControl  and  Research  (IEDCR)  to  coordinate  preparedness  and  response  measures  at  five \n\n \n\n17   Disaster risk is a function of hazards, exposure, and vulnerability. \n18   World Risk Index developed by B\u00fcndnis Entwicklung Hilft in cooperation with the United Nations University.

No  later  data  is \n\navailable. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nlevels.23 The IEDCR conducts contact tracing and most of the surveillance.24 The NPRP provides \nsix response levels depending on COVID-19 infection status, as well as mechanisms for surge \ncapacity  to  manage  patients,  sustain  essential  services,  and  reduce  social  impacts.  The \ngovernment,  with  development  partners,  will  continually  review  and  adjust  the  response  as \nnecessary. \n \n12. \nThe  government  is  closely  planning  and  coordinating  the  emergency  assistance  by \nworking with each development partner to allocate specific elements of the CPRP, in line with the \ncountry\u2019s  needs  and  the  volume  of  assistance  provided.  Thus,  the  World  Bank  Group\u2019s  loan \nproject for COVID-19 response will support information-technology-based approaches to disease \nsurveillance, and training and equipment for the facilities and geographic areas identified by the \ngovernment.25 WHO will support the more technical aspects of IPC, such as laboratory testing \nand clinical case management. To support the Rohingya people, the government has a separate \nprogram  to  prevent  the  breakout  of  COVID-19  in  the  camps  and  mitigate  any  impact  through \nestablishing  isolation  units  and  providing  health  facilities  for  them.  The  World  Bank  has  two \nongoing  grant  projects  ($185  million)  for  the  health  sector  to  manage  and  mitigate  COVID-19 \nimpact  in  camp  areas  within  the  Coxsbazar  district.  ADB  is  exploring  additional  grant funds to \ncomplement the World Bank support.  \n \n13. \nLessons in disaster response. First, the joint IHR evaluation with WHO in 2016 (footnote \n8) revealed limited capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to public health emergencies. Another \nevaluation  highlighted  inadequate  on-site  monitoring  and  subdistrict-based  healthcare.26 \nTherefore, efforts are needed to strengthen the medium- to long-term capacity to handle health \nemergencies and meet IHR standards, raise community risk awareness, and improve health risk \nmanagement planning. Second, any response to COVID-19 must incorporate key lessons learned \nby other countries in combating the disease. Third, duplication and gaps are recurring features in \nthe  management  of  large  disasters  everywhere,  so  the  coordination  of  emergency  assistance \nrequires extra attention. \n \nProposed ADB support.27 The project complements other ADB support for COVID-19 \n14. \nresponse by providing urgently needed health equipment, supplies, and infrastructure, and limited \nactivities  to  strengthen  the  health  workforce.  As  initial  support,  ADB  had  provided  $350,000 \ntechnical assistance grant from ADB regional technical assistance (RETA) Regional Support to \nAddress  the  Outbreak  of  Coronavirus  Disease  2019  and  Potential  Outbreaks  of  Other \nCommunicable Diseases. Complementing these health sector interventions are: (i) a $500 million \nloan,  comprising  $250  million  from  ordinary  capital  resources  lending  and  $250  million \nconcessional  loan  for  countercyclical  support  to  address  downstream  effects  of  increased \nspending  on  social  protection,  salary  support  to  workers,  and  low  interest  loans  to  affected \nsectors; and (ii) an attached TA grant of $1 million to support strengthening the social safety net \n\n \n\n23   The  five  levels  of  coordination  for  COVID-19  efforts  are  (i)  the  Inter-ministerial  National  Committee,  and  Multi-sectoral \n\nCoordination Committees at (ii) Divisional, (iii) District, (iv) City Corporation, and (v) Upazila (subdistrict) levels. \n24   The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research is the WHO-recognized National Influenza Centre. \n25   The project ($100 million) has three components: (i) surveillance, diagnostics and community engagement; (ii) healthcare \nstrengthening; and (iii) institutional capacity to improve management, monitoring, and preparedness.

The  project  will  have  the \nfollowing outcome: health and wellbeing of COVID-19 affected persons improved. The outcome \nwill be achieved through three outputs.31  \n \n16. \nOutput 1: Immediate and medium-term equipment needs for testing and managing \nCOVID-19 met. The project will help meet the government\u2019s immediate and medium-term needs \nto prevent the spread of COVID-19, by supporting emergency procurement and the provision of \nthe most crucial medical equipment and supplies. The supplies will enable (i) affected people and \nhealthcare workers to be treated and protected from infection; and (ii) selected health facilities to \nbe  equipped  with  essential  IPC  supplies.  The  supplies  will  include  PPE,  biohazard  bags, \ndisinfecting materials, ventilators, oxygen meters, and other equipment. \n\n \n\n17. \nOutput  2:  Infrastructure  and  related  equipment  for  supporting  and  sustaining \nprevention and management of COVID-19 delivered. The project will support the modification \nand  rehabilitation  of  infrastructure  to  provide  (i)  at  least  80%  of  points  of  entry  with  screening \nfacilities for passengers coming into the country via air, land, and water; (ii) at least 17 medical \ncollege hospitals with critical care units and isolation units to reduce secondary infections among \ncontacts  and  healthcare  workers;  and  (iii)  at  least  19 microbiological  diagnostic  facilities  with \ncapability  to  apply  real-time  and  advanced  diagnostics,  as  well  as  other  emergency  response \ninfrastructure as needed. \n \n18. \nOutput  3.

A project implementation unit (PIU) will be \nestablished in DGHS, the implementing agency. The PIU will comprise a project director and a \ndeputy project director for ADB. The PIU will provide the technical, administrative, and logistical \nimplementation,  supported  by  consultants,  as  necessary.  Project \nsupport  required \nmanagement support will be provided. A project steering committee will provide guidance to the \nPIU  and  oversee  the  overall  project  implementation,  meeting  at  least  twice  a  year  or  more \nfrequently,  if  required. A  project  implementation  committee,  chaired  by  the  director  general, \nDGHS, will provide technical oversight and hands-on supervision, meeting at least quarterly, or \nmore frequently as needed. The PIU and the project implementation committee will work directly \nwith  the  government  entity  involved  in  each  component:  the  COVID-19  Emergency  Operation \nCenter \nin \ncommunication,  and  IEDCR  in  surveillance  strengthening  activities.

The executing and implementing agencies will carry out all activities related \nto the procurement of goods, works, and consulting services using simplified approaches that are \nin line with the ADB Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004), the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time), and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n(2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  In  formulating  the  procurement  arrangements, \nconsideration was given to value for money to increase efficiency; flexibility measures suited to \nthe context of the emergency health pandemic considering market analysis; the capability of local \nmanufacturers  and  contractors;  and  the  operating  environment,  wherein  the  use  of  electronic \nprocurement  is  already  in  place.  To  help  achieve  value  for  money  and  to  ensure  competitive \ntension  in  the  procurement  processes,  several  packages  will  be  tendered  using  various \nprocurement methods, with due attention to flexibility, agility, but also fiduciary compliance to fit \nthe  purpose  of  this  emergency  loan.  Most  of  the  goods  contracts  for  medical  equipment  and \nsupplies will be awarded through open competitive bidding (OCB) and the national advertisement \nmethod. Civil works procurement, if any, will follow the same approaches. To ensure efficiency, \nspecial procedures for emergency lending will be used, including reducing the bidding period to \n14 days when appropriate; using single-stage one-envelope bidding procedures; and developing \na time-bound action plan to award contracts, including a contract management plan. Some civil \nworks and goods contracts may be procured using direct contracting, where appropriate, following \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Goods needed immediately may be procured using international \nand/or  national  requests  for  quotations  subject  to  prior  review  by  ADB.  Subject  to  bidding \ndocuments being modified to comply with ADB requirements, the national electronic government \nprocurement system will be used for OCB to award most of the goods and civils works contracts, \nalthough manual or off-line bidding may be used where appropriate. \n\n \n\n26. \nConsulting firm(s) will be recruited through OCB procedures, local advertisements, and/or \nlimited  competitive  bidding  using  a  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedure,  a  simplified \ntechnical  proposal,  or  a  biodata  technical  proposal.  Other  methods,  such  as  the  consultants\u2019 \nqualification  selection,  may  also  be  used  where  appropriate.  For  implementation  support, \nindividual  consultants  will  be  recruited  using  the  individual  selection  method  with  international \nand/or local advertisements, based on the project\u2019s requirements. Consultants who are already \nengaged in ADB-financed projects and provide similar services as those required for the project \nmay be recruited directly, subject to their satisfactory performance. This arrangement will provide \n\n \n\n\fan  efficient  way  to  recruit  consultants  under  the  circumstances.  Local  nongovernment \norganizations may provide some social and gender studies and/or support. The option to have a \ndirect  contract  or  a  memorandum  of  understanding  with  nongovernment  organizations  and/or \nUnited  Nations  agencies  already  engaged  in  the  project  area  may  also  be  explored  where \nappropriate.  \n \n27. \nAll  goods,  works,  and  consulting  services  will  be  procured  based  on  the  detailed \narrangements in the project\u2019s procurement plan, including procurement and selection methods, \ntype of bidding documents, and ADB\u2019s review requirements. ADB will review the first contract per \nbidding method per implementing agency prior to bidding, and the rest of the contracts will be \npost-reviewed (sampling). The executing and implementing agencies will be required to (i) use \nthe Procurement Activity Monitoring Tool, a web-based database, to record and monitor the time \ntaken for each step of the procurement process and to track any delays; and (ii) take appropriate \nactions for all prior and post-review packages of goods and works under the project. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n \nA. \n \n28. \nAll project activities will incorporate measures to strengthen resilience to future epidemics \nand  disease  outbreaks, thus  addressing  the  systemic  weaknesses found  in  Bangladesh\u2019s  IHR \ncore capacities (para. 5). All new and upgraded infrastructure will be disaster-resilient and climate-\nsmart based on hazard, climate, and risk analyses; modified design criteria and careful selection \nof materials; and monitoring of field practices. The project has a low climate risk category because \nmost  facilities  will  be  constructed  within  existing  structures  such  as  health  centers,  medical \ncolleges, and ports. Project management actions need to include strong contingency planning for \npotential physical impacts resulting from an increase in temperature (heat stress) and extreme \nrainfall events (floods). \n \nB. \n \n29. \nThe  project  is  likely  to  generate  significant  social  benefits  through  disease  prevention, \nimproved  health  risk  management,  and  greater  health  awareness.  Bangladesh  could  suffer \nsignificant  economic  impacts  as  a  result  of  COVID-19  (para.  9  and  10).  If  unchecked,  the \npandemic could overwhelm the health system, which, in its present state, is unable to cope with \nthe increased need for intensive care, protective equipment, and human resources. COVID-19 \naffects economic activity through various channels, such as declines in domestic consumption, \nproduction, investment, and trade. In the short to medium run, it leads to higher unemployment \nand disruption of schooling, and to an increase in deaths and morbidities, all of which could have \na debilitating effect on the country\u2019s human capital. The project outputs are expected to prevent \nthe  loss  of  human  capital  and  address  short-term  gaps  in the  health  system.  Due  to  the  short \nprocessing time  available  for the  emergency response,  economic due  diligence  following  ADB \nguidelines  on  economic  analysis33 will  be  conducted  during  project  implementation. The  ADB \nRETA34  will  include  resources  to  undertake  the  necessary  project  economic  analysis,  in \ncompliance with ADB requirements. \n \n\n \n\n33   ADB. 2017.

Regarding the financial sustainability, about 64% of project cost will be \nutilized to procure emergency equipment, which will be discarded after use. About 30% will be \ninvested in infrastructure and facilities, which will either be dismantled after the emergency (such \nas screening facilities at airport and ports) or repurposed for use in hospitals (such as isolation \nwards). To ensure the project\u2019s sustainability, the government will provide assurances as part of \nthe loan agreement that (i) adequate budget support for incremental operations and maintenance \nis provided to the respective entities, and (ii) all entities receiving project equipment will maintain \nsound asset management practices, including an asset register, and conduct periodic inventories. \n \nC. \n \n31. \nA  financial  management  assessment,  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines, \nfound that DGHS and MOHFW have adequate financial management arrangements in place to \nimplement  the  project.  The  financial  management  risk  is  rated  substantial,  because  of \nweaknesses in country financial management systems, capacity constraints of the implementing \nagency, and the project\u2019s urgent nature. These risks will be mitigated by (i) assigning dedicated \nand qualified financial management staff to the PIU; (ii) providing training in ADB\u2019s procedures \nand systems; (iii) requiring comprehensive financial information in quarterly progress reports; and \n(iv) assigning an internal auditor to the project. Furthermore, a financial management expert will \nbe funded by the ADB RETA (footnote 34) to support the project during the first 6 months. The \nproject  will  maintain  separate  books  of  account  in  accordance  with  accounting  standards \nacceptable to ADB, and the project financial statement will be audited annually by an independent \nauditor acceptable to ADB and in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing. \n \n32. \nA procurement assessment of the executing and implementing agencies, conducted for \nthe project, revealed that the procurement and contract management risk is high but manageable \nby implementing the agreed mitigation measures, such as (i) deploying PIU staff with prior ADB \nproject  experience;  (ii)  introducing  an  efficient  contract  award  and  contract  implementation \nmanagement plan; (iii) applying the e-Government Procurement (e-GP) process; (iv) conducting \nfrequent  and  close  monitoring,  audits,  and  reviews;  and  (v)  ensuring  close  supervision  of  and \nadequate  mechanisms  for  the  distribution  of  goods  and  equipment  through  credible  agencies. \nProcurement experts funded by the ADB RETA (footnote 34) will provide capacity building support \nto ensure compliance with the agreed procurement procedures. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n33. \nwith  the  government  and  MOHFW.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 32). \n \nD. \n \n34. \nThe project will benefit all, especially the poor and vulnerable, by preventing or mitigating \nthe  impact  of  infectious  disease  (para.  10)  and  providing  inclusive  healthcare  services,  health \neducation  and  awareness  raising.  Disease  prevention  benefits  especially  the  poor,  through \nreduced  out-of-pocket  expenditures,  reduced  absenteeism  at  work,  and  improved  well-being. \nWomen and their health will need special attention, in the cultural context of Bangladesh, since \nthe burden of enforcing family hygiene and caring for the sick falls largely on them. Female health \nworkers  and  patients  have  specific  needs  related  to  menstrual  hygiene,  personal  safety,  and \ntransportation. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming and a gender action \nplan was prepared. The key activities involve: (i) a gender sensitive communication strategy, and \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\ncommunity  education  and  mobilization  (Output  3);  (ii)  targets  for  women  for  recruitment  and \ncapacity building (Output 3) and gender-segregated isolation units (Output 2).  \n \nE. \n \n35. \n The  safeguards  requirements  for  emergency  assistance  set  out  in  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009)  have  been  followed.  The  screening  and  assessment  of  sites  will  be \nundertaken during project implementation in accordance with the environmental assessment and \nreview framework and the resettlement and indigenous peoples planning framework (RIPPF). The \nsafeguards  frameworks  have  been  designed  to  respond  to  the  exceptional  nature  of  the \nemergency and the challenges imposed by COVID-19 on meeting safeguards requirements, such \nas audits and consultations. The frameworks are broad enough to address (i) impacts and risks \nidentified at a later stage; and (ii) any change of scope required by the rapidly evolving situation, \nwhile ensuring continued compliance with the Safeguard Policy Statement. In view of the limited \ncapacity, safeguards consultants engaged under this loan will provide support.  \n \nEnvironment (category B). Most civil and structural works will consist of rehabilitation or \n36. \nminor extensions to buildings on existing premises, so potential direct, indirect, cumulative, and \ninduced impacts of the project are anticipated to be site-specific and minor, and few (if any) to be \nirreversible  in  nature.  The  main  impacts  and  risks  relate  to  (i)  medical  waste  management, \nrequiring  environmentally  sound  and  safe  handling,  storage,  transport,  and  disposal;  (ii) \noccupational  and  community  health  and  safety  risks35  associated  with  the  construction  and \noperation  of  project-supported  facilities  and  the  high  contagiousness  of  COVID-19;  and  (iii) \nconstruction-related  pollution,  disruption,  and  disturbance.  The  environmental  assessment  and \nreview framework provides guidance on mitigation of these impacts, through the development of \nguidelines on waste management, health and safety risk assessment, and management plans, \nEnvironmental  Code  of  Practices,  provision  of  PPE,  and  trainings.  The  implementation  of \nEnvironmental  Management  Plans  shall  be  closely  supervised  and  monitored.  Specific  project \nfunding  has  been  dedicated  to  medical  waste  management,  the  provision  of  PPE,  health  and \nsafety trainings, and the mitigation of other environmental problems. \n \n37. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). Involuntary resettlement is not expected to occur \nunder this project since the works will be carried out within existing facilities on government land. \nHowever, to cater to emerging issues during implementation,36 the RIPPF includes site selection \ncriteria and guidelines. For existing facilities, a rapid audit to assess any legacy issues or risks \nrelated to involuntary resettlement will be undertaken. If such issues are identified, a corrective \naction plan will be developed and implemented. The RIPPF and the project administration manual \ninclude involuntary resettlement screening and audit guidelines. \n \nIndigenous peoples (category B). No adverse impact on indigenous peoples37 or small \n38. \nethnic  communities  is  expected;  however,  while  most  facility  sites  are  unknown  at  this  stage, \nindigenous people will be among the project beneficiaries. The project is thus rated category B \nand  the  RIPPF  includes  site  selection  criteria  to  this  effect.  Communication  activities  will  be \n\n \n\n35   For  health  workers,  laboratory  technicians,  medical  waste  handlers,  contractor  and  construction  workers,  patients  and \nvisitors to existing facilities, and the wider local communities in the event of inadequate waste management processes.   \n36   The RIPPF anticipates issues that may arise during implementation, such as, if squatters are found, or if, for example, the \n\nhealth situation requires more isolation room, which could require more ground than initially expected. \n\n37   For operational purposes, the term Indigenous Peoples is used in a generic sense to refer to a distinct, vulnerable, social \nand cultural group as defined in SPS 2009. In considering these characteristics, national legislation, customary law, and \nany international conventions to which the country is a party will be taken into account. The Constitution of Bangladesh \nrefer to ethnic communities as Small Ethnic Communities. Both the terms have been used in related documentation. \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\npresented in culturally appropriate ways for indigenous peoples. Any risk of exclusion from access \nto information and services for indigenous communities and other vulnerable and disadvantaged \ngroups will be addressed through the indigenous peoples plan. \n \nF. \n  \n39. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan. 38 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nDisease  transmission  patterns  or  severity  could \nsuddenly accelerate, which could overwhelm system \ncapacity  and  invalidate  all  reasonable  planning \nassumptions. \nRisks linked to weak financial management, complex \nactivities,  and  lack  of  experience  in  implementing \nAsian Development Bank financed projects. \nRisks linked to inadequate procurement capacity. \n\nMitigation Measures \nThe government and development partners are conducting risk \nscenario planning, including surge capacity development.
