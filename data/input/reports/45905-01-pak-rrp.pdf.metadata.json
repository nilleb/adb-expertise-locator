As  in  many  developing  countries,  an  energy  deficit  is  a  major \nconstraint on efficient economic growth in Pakistan. To ensure a sustainable supply of energy, \nthe  Government  of  Pakistan  launched  a  number  of  initiatives  to  promote  private  sector \nparticipation in the country's energy infrastructure, including the power sector. As part of these \nefforts,  a  number  of  power  policies  were  introduced,  such  as  the  Power  Policy,  2002  and  the \nRenewable Energy Policy, 2006. As of 30 September 2011, almost 40% of the country\u2019s power \ncapacity was owned and operated by international and national private sector investors. \n \n3. \n \nThe sponsors initiated discussions with ADB to raise debt and equity financing for both \n4. \nprojects,  attracted  by  ADB\u2019s  strong  presence  and  track  record  in  Pakistan\u2019s  power  sector;  it\u2019s \nsupport  for  Zorlu  Enerji,  the  first  wind  project  in  Pakistan;1 and  its  strong  and  longstanding \nrelationship with  the  Fauji  Foundation. The  project team  introduced  the  sponsors to the  ADB\u2013\nIDB funded Islamic Infrastructure Fund to provide the balance of equity for the two transactions. \nAt the same time ADB initiated cofinancing discussions with IDB for the projects. ADB and IDB \nhave a close working relationship and have recently worked together on several transactions in \nPakistan:  New  Bong  Escape  Hydropower, 2  Uch-II  Power, 3  and  Patrind  Hydropower. 4  The \npresence  of  ADB  in  the  transactions  helped  catalyze  local  currency  debt,  which  is  being \narranged by National Bank of Pakistan.  \n \n5. \nThe sponsors requested that all financing for the two projects be obtained in compliance \nwith Islamic Shariah principles. IDB and local banks are raising financing on this basis. To meet \nthe needs of the client, ADB will make innovative use of PCGs, allowing the project companies \nto raise all financing in line with Shariah. In the event the PCG structure is implemented, this will \nbe  the  first  time  ADB  participates  in  a  debt  financing  that  is  entirely  compliant  with  Shariah.  \nShariah  financing,  though  new  to  ADB,  is  well  established  in  the  market  and  has  seen \ntremendous growth in recent years. In addition, ADB is familiar with Shariah structure as it has \ncofinanced several transactions in which IDB has provided a Shariah tranche alongside ADB\u2019s \n\n                                                \n1   ADB. 2010.

The  two  projects  are  located  in the Gharo  wind  corridor  54 kilometers \nsoutheast of Karachi, Pakistan\u2019s industrial and commercial hub. The two project sites are only 6 \nkilometers  apart  and  are  being  simultaneously  developed  to  benefit  from  economies  of  scale. \nThe  two  projects  will  have  the  same  set  of  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  (EPC) \ncontractors,  financiers,  and  technical  and  legal  advisors  but  are  legally,  economically,  and \ncontractually  distinct  and  will  not  rely  on  each  other\u2019s  cash  flows.  ADB  will  participate  in  two \ndistinct, stand-alone project financings \n \n7. \nThe two projects will encompass engineering, design, procurement, construction, turbine \nerection, grid tie-in, commissioning, and operation and maintenance (O&M) for two 50 MW wind \npower plants. The projects will be constructed under a date-certain, lump-sum, fixed-price EPC \ncontract. Power evacuation from both projects to the national grid will be through a 132-kilovolt \nline to be built and operated by the National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC), the \nnational grid operator. Power offtake arrangements will be through a 20-year take-or-pay energy \npurchase  agreement  (EPA)  signed  by  each  project  company  and  NTDC  through  its  Central \nPower Purchasing Agency. The government will guarantee NTDC\u2019s obligations under the EPA \nas part of its obligations under a 20-year implementation agreement.  \n \n8. \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\n9. \nImpact. The successful development of the projects will help alleviate Pakistan\u2019s severe \npower  shortage,  which  cramps  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth  and  efforts  to  reduce  poverty. \nThe  successful  implementation  of the  projects  will foster  confidence  among  potential  investors \nand  lenders  and  promote  further  private  sector  investment  in  renewable  energy  and  power  in \nPakistan.  \n \n10. \nOutcome. The  outcome  of the  projects  is  the  production of  lower-cost,  carbon-efficient \npower from wind energy. FWE I will generate annually 143.2 gigawatts (GWh) and FWE II will \ngenerate  annually  143.7  GWh  of  competitively  priced,  low-carbon  power  for  Pakistan\u2019s \nconsumers. The capacity  factor  of  FWE I  is  expected  to be  32.7%  and of  FWE II  32.8%. The \nprojects  will  incrementally  increase  access  to  energy  for  households,  business,  and  industry. \nThe projected levelized tariff for FWE I and II is expected to be $0.15 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), \nwhich  compares  favorably  with  $0.19\u20130.23  per  kWh,  the  incremental  cost  of  furnace  oil  or \ndiesel-based  power  generation.  The  projects  will  avoid  greenhouse  gas  emissions  equal  to \n68,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year for FWE I and 68,250 tons for FWE II and support the \ngovernment\u2019s  target  of  generating  6%  of  power  from  renewable  energy  sources  by  2030.  By \nefficiently  using  an  energy  resource  that  is  domestic,  idle,  and  renewable,  the  projects  will \ncontribute to Pakistan\u2019s energy security and the diversification of its skewed power mix,  which \ncurrently  relies  heavily  on  expensive  oil  imports.  Fossil  fuels  have  experienced  severe  price \nescalation and volatility in recent years, which has undermined the financial health of the power \nsector  and  economy  in  general.  Diversification  using  indigenous  and  renewable  sources  of \npower  is  an  important  avenue  towards  addressing  the  long-term  financial  health  of  the  power \n\n                                                \n5 ADB. 2009.

This  investment  represented  ADB\u2019s  first  Shariah  compliant  equity \nfinancing. \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nsector and its circular debt problem.  \n \n11. \nOutputs. The outputs will be the installing and commissioning of two 50 MW wind power \nprojects.  The  projects  will  create  local  employment  in  southern  Sindh,  one  of  the  poorest \nregions in Pakistan.  \n  \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\nConsistency  with  Strategy  2020.  The  projects  are  consistent  with  Strategy  2020, 6 \n12. \nwhich  emphasizes  infrastructure  investment to achieve  rapid but  sustainable economic growth \nand to connect the poor to markets and improve their access to basic productive assets as part \nof  ADB\u2019s  support  for  achieving  inclusive  growth.  The  projects  will  (i)  promote  private  sector \ndevelopment  and  catalyze  private  sector  operations  and  (ii)  leverage  partnerships  through \ncofinancing with IDB, which are among the five drivers of change addressed by Strategy 2020.  \n \n13. \nConsistency  with  country  strategy.  ADB\u2019s  support  for  the  projects  is  in  line  with  its \ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  Pakistan,  2009\u20132013, 7  which  emphasizes  energy  sector \ndevelopment,  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure  development,  and  the  expansion  of \nADB\u2019s private sector operations in the energy sector. Both projects are logical continuations of \nADB\u2019s  development  and  reform  efforts  in  Pakistan\u2019s  energy  sector,  which  promote  a  well-\nregulated, market-oriented power industry.  \n \n14. \nConsistency with energy policy. The projects promote renewable energy, which is one \nof the three pillars of ADB\u2019s Energy Policy.8 ADB finances renewable energy projects to facilitate \nthe  wider  deployment  of  clean  energy  technologies  and  has  set  the  target  of  promoting  clean \nenergy investments of more than $1 billion annually, to which ADB support to the projects will \ncontribute. The projects will foster reduced fossil fuel use and contribute to the country\u2019s energy \nsecurity by using indigenous wind resources.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nD. \n\nProjected Economic Performance \n\n15. \nThe projects are economically sustainable, as the economic internal rates of return are \n12.42%  for  FWE  I  and  12.41%  for  FWE  II,  higher  than  the  social  discount  rate  of  10%. 9 \nSensitivity analysis shows the projects are economically viable under adverse scenarios. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n16. \nADB\u2019s assistance will be in the form of  a PCG of up to $33.43 million for FWE I and a \nPCG  of  up  to  $33.18  million  for  FWE  II  issued  by  ADB.  in  favor  of  IDB.  IDB  will  finance  the \nprojects  based  on  ijarah  (a  Shariah-compliant  financing  structure  similar  to  lease  financing). \n\n                                                \n6   ADB.  2008.  Strategy  2020:  The  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  2008\u20132020. \n\nManila. \n\n7   ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: Pakistan, 2009\u20132013. Manila. \n8   ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n9   Economic  Analysis  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).  The  Evaluation  Cooperation \nGroup\u2019s  Good  Practice  Standards  for  Private  Sector  Investment  Operations  rates  a  project  satisfactory  if  the \neconomic internal rate of return is 10% or higher.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nBroadly, under ijarah IDB will advance money to each project company during construction for \ndeveloping  and  procuring  certain  project  assets.  During  operations,  each project  company  will \npay rent to IDB for the use of those assets, the amount to be equivalent to principal plus interest \npayments  under  a  conventional  loan.  ADB\u2019s  PCG  will  cover  any  nonpayment  by  the  project \ncompany  to  IDB,  which  includes  initial  disbursements  by  IDB,  plus  rental  payments  and  other \nadditional associated costs. ADB\u2019s PCG will cover half of the amount of IDB\u2019s financing to the \nproject company. On the balance amount, IDB will take full project risk. Both PCGs will have a \ntenor of 12 years and match the tenor of IDB financing. \n \n17. \nIn  the  event  the  PCG  structure  cannot  be  implemented  due  to  lack  of  regulatory \napprovals,  lack  of  final  legal  documentation  acceptable  to  ADB,  or  other  reasons,  ADB\u2019s \nassistance will be in the form of a direct loan of up to $33.43 million for FWE I and a direct loan \nof up to $33.18 million for FWE II. Both loans will have a tenor of 12 years with a grace period of \n2 years. The proceeds of the PCG-guaranteed financing or the loans will fund the construction \nand  development  of  the  two  projects.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  both  projects  will  be  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources  without  government  guarantee.  ADB\u2019s  PCGs  will  carry  guarantee \nfees, and ADB\u2019s loans will carry interest and other fees and terms to be  determined by ADB\u2019s \ninvestment committee.  \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n18. \n\nADB assistance adds value in the following ways:  \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nADB  provides  financing  to  critical  assets  in  a  sector  that  does  not  readily  have \naccess to long-term funding under the present financial and country environment. \nADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  projects  will  increase  the  supply  of  energy,  stem  a \ngrowing  power  deficit  that  has  seriously  constrained  economic  growth,  and \nexpand access to energy for households, business, and industry. \nThe  presence  of  ADB  reassures  the  sponsors  that  government  entities  will \ncontinue to support the projects throughout their life. ADB was the first financial \ninstitution  that  the  sponsors  approached  to  finance  the  projects  because  of  its \ntrack record in the country and the sector and the value the sponsors placed on \nthe  risk-mitigation  and  financial-catalyst  role  that  ADB  has  played  in  supporting \nprivate sector projects in Pakistan. \nAs part of its public sector program, ADB has a strong energy focus in Pakistan. \nIts  work  on  reform  and  regulations  has  supported  the  creation  of  an  enabling \nenvironment for  current and future  private  and  public  sector  investment. ADB  is \nthe  largest  provider  of  renewable  energy  assistance  to  the  country  under  its \nRenewable  Energy  Development  Sector  Investment  Program.10 Support  to  the \nprojects  will  directly  build  on  and  complement  extensive  work  under  the \ninvestment program in promoting renewable energy in Pakistan. \nThe  proposed  PCG  structure  allows  ADB  to  participate  in  a  fully  Shariah-\ncompliant financing structure, which would not have been possible if ADB merely \nprovided  a  loan.  This  allows  ADB  to  be  more  responsive  to  borrower \nrequirements  and  provides  potential  for  expanding  financing  opportunities  in \ndeveloping  member  countries.  The  proposed  PCG  structure  has  been  made \npossible  because  of  close  cooperation  between  ADB  and  IDB.  This  will \nstrengthen  ADB\u2019s  relationship  with  IDB,  which  is  one  of  its  key  development \n\n                                                \n10 ADB.  2006.

ADB\u2019s \ncontinuing  participation  in  the  Shariah  compliant  financing  structures  will  also \nenhance its continuing dialogue with key players in Islamic Finance. \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \n\nA. \n\nSafeguard and Social Dimensions  \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n19. \nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is environment \ncategory  B,  involuntary  resettlement  category  C,  and  indigenous  peoples  category  C.  The \nenvironmental assessment was carried out in line with national laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. The Environmental Protection Agency of the Government of Sindh \nhas  issued  the  necessary  environmental  permits  for  the  projects.  The  project  sites  and  their \nimmediate  environs  do not support  natural  vegetation  of  any  ecological significance. The  sites \ndo  not  provide  habitat  to  any  terrestrial,  avian,  or  aquatic faunal  species,  nor  are they  located \nalong the route of migratory birds. No settlement exists at the proposed sites or their immediate \nvicinities,  nor  is  any  economic  activity  such  as  cultivation  carried  out  there.  During  operation, \nlocal  communities  will  not  be  affected  as  they  are  located  several  kilometers  away  from  the \nproject sites.
