Technical \nassistance for education regulatory reform and governance for \ndecentralization in the amount of $500,000 is also proposed.  \n   \nRationale  The purpose of ESDP II will be to consolidate current initiatives \nand  extend  them  through  new  poverty-targeted  strategies  and \nbroader coverage, building on the achievements of the Education \nSector  Development  Program  (ESDP)  and  consistent  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (NPRS), \n2003\u20132005, and the Education Strategic Plan (ESP), 2004\u20132008. \nESDP  II  will  also  support  the  National  Education  for  All  Plan \n2003\u20132015  in  line  with  the  Millennium  Development  Goals \n(MDGs).  Cambodia\u2019s  NPRS  and  Second  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan highlight education development as central to \npoverty reduction and socioeconomic development. \n \n  The sector development program (SDP) follows on from ESDP \nand  takes  the  process  of  government,  nongovernment \norganization (NGO), donor and ADB coordination to a full sector-\nwide approach. The SDP is pro-poor and strongly targets gender \nparity, poverty reduction and ethnic minority participation. \n   \nClassification  Sector: Education (Basic Education) \nTheme: Inclusive Social Development (Human Development) \nTargeted Intervention:  Sectoral/Subsectoral (MDG 2, 3) \n   \nThe Sector Development Program \n \nObjectives and Scope  The  overall  objective  of  ESDP  II  is  to  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction in Cambodia by improving access to and the quality of \nsecondary education and lifelong learning opportunities for out-of-\nschool youth. ESDP II will support the long-term goal of education \nreform in establishing a market-responsive education and training \nsystem that will enable an increased level of education attainment \nin the workforce and increased household income. The objective \nis to support the implementation of the ESP and the Education \nSector Support Program (ESSP) 2004\u20132008 through (i) improved \nresource  mobilization  and  allocation  for  the  education  sector, \n(ii) increased  access  to  education  and  training  opportunities, \n(iii) improved  standards,  quality  and  internal  efficiency,  and \nsustainability,  and  (iv)  effective  capacity  building  for \ndecentralization in education services.  ", "ii  \nPolicy Framework and  The program loan will support policy interventions to (i) improve \nActions  equity in access to education and training services through pro-\npoor systemic and targeted interventions; (ii) improve quality and \ninternal  efficiency;  (iii)  enhance  capacity  for  greater  education \ndecentralization  through  strengthened  financial  planning, \nmanagement and audit systems, a more focused human resource \nplanning  system  and  more  efficient  staff  performance \nmanagement, deployment and reward systems; and (iv) increase \nresource mobilization linked to measures that ensure resource \nallocation is pro-poor, equitable, and efficient.   \n   \nCapacity Building  ESDP  II  will  provide  the  policy  and  strategic  framework  for \naddressing  capacity-building  concerns  in  a  number  of  areas, \nincluding  (i)  decentralization  of  the  management  of  education \nservices,  (ii)  upper  secondary  education  policy  analysis  and \nstrategic  planning,  (iii)  strategic  management  of  the  expanded \ncommunity-based skills training program, and (iv) strengthening \npolicy-led  education  governance  and  regulatory  reform.  The \noverall Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport (MOEYS) capacity \nbuilding strategy, with ADB support, will be coordinated with other \ndevelopment agencies. \n   \nThe Investment Project  The investment project of ESDP II will enhance equitable access \nand improve the quality of lower (grades 7\u20139) and upper (grades \n10\u201312)  secondary  education,  and  provide  demand-driven, \ncommunity-based  skills  training  opportunities  mainly  for  out-of- \nschool youth, in underserved areas, through (i) expanding lower \nsecondary  education  opportunities,  (ii)  expanding  upper \nsecondary  education  opportunities,  and  (iii)  expanding \ncommunity-based  skills  training  for  out-of-school  youth  in  poor \ncommunities. \n   \nSocial and  Cambodia\u2019s MDGs target a 50% reduction in the number of poor \nEnvironmental Measures  and gender equity by 2015. The ESDP II policy reform agenda \ntargets the poor through (i) increased participation and equity in \naccess  to  education  of  the  poorest  families;  (ii)  reduced  cost \nburden on the poor for education; and (iii) occupational skills for \nincreased  income  among  out-of-school,  unemployed  and \nunderemployed youth across the poorest 40% of the country\u2019s \n1,621 communes. The increase in equitable access to education \nservices  is  focused  on  the  poor,  through  abolition  of  informal \npayments  for  primary  and  secondary  schooling,  scholarship \nsupport for the rural poor (especially girls), facilities in unserved \nand  underserved  areas  (especially  rural,  remote  and  ethnic \nminority areas), skills training in the poorest communes and the \nredeployment of teachers to underserved areas. \n \n \n \n \n ", "  iii\n   \nThe Program Loan   \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  It is proposed that a loan of $20 million equivalent will be provided \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan will have a term of \n24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest \ncharge  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period,  and  1.5% \nthereafter. \n   \nProgram Period and  The loan will be utilized over a period of 3 years, from around the \nTranching  second quarter of 2005 to the end of 2007, and will be disbursed \nin three tranches. The first tranche of $5 million will be available \nfor disbursement when the loan comes into effect. The second \ntranche of $7.5 million will be released within 12-15 months from \nthe  first  tranche  release,  and  the  third  tranche  of  $7.5  million \nwithin 12 months of the second tranche release, upon satisfactory \ncompliance with specific conditions indicated in the policy matrix. \n   \nExecuting Agency and  MOEYS  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  the \nImplementation  implementation of policy measures. A steering committee will be \nArrangements  established to oversee the implementation of the program and \nproject loan. The committee will be chaired by the secretary of \nstate, MOEYS, and comprises representatives from the Ministry of \nEconomy and Finance (MEF), MOLVT, the Ministry of Planning, \nthe  Council  for  Administrative  Reform  (within  the  Council  of \nMinisters), the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior, the \nMinistry of Women\u2019s Affairs, the Ministry of Rural Development, \nthe Ministry of Urban and Land Management, and the Ministry of \nSocial Affairs and Youth Rehabilitation.  \n \nProcurement,  The program loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign \nDisbursement, and  exchange  cost  of  items  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB \nCounterpart Funds  member countries, excluding items specified in a list of ineligible \nitems  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral \nsources.  The  counterpart  funds  to  be  generated  from  the \nproceeds of the program loan will supplement the Government\u2019s \npro-poor  budget  and  will  be  targeted  at  protecting  service \nprovision to the poor, and as agreed between the Government \nand ADB, protect allocation to the education sector.  \n \nThe  counterpart  funds  generated  from  the  proceeds  of  the \nprogram loan will be used by the Government in order of priority \n(i)  to  finance  costs  associated  with  the  implementation  of  the \npackage of education policy reforms under the program, (ii) as \npart of the contribution of the Government to the ADB-funded \neducation  projects,  and  (iii)  as  part  of  the  contribution  of  the \nGovernment to ADB-funded projects in other social sectors. \n \n   \n   \n   ", "iv   \nThe Project Loan   \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  It is proposed that a loan of $25 million equivalent will be provided \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a \nmaturity of 32 years with a grace period of 8 years, and an interest \ncharge  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5% \nthereafter.  \n   \nExecuting Agencies and  MOEYS will be the Executing Agency for the lower and upper \nImplementation  secondary  education  components  of  the  Project  and  will  be \nArrangements  responsible for coordinating its overall implementation. MOLVT \nwill  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  community-based  skills \ntraining  component  and  will  be  responsible  for  its  overall \nimplementation. The steering committee will be the same as for \nthe program loan. \n   \nProcurement,  All  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  for  the  Project  will  be \nDisbursement, and  procured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. \nCounterpart Funds  International and domestic consultants will be recruited according \nto ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. \n \n  An imprest account will be established, managed, replenished, \nand liquidated in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook. The accounting records and system will be managed \nand  maintained  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Project  Accounting \nManual  for  Cambodia.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE) \nprocedure will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures and to \nliquidate advances to the imprest account. \n   \nTime Frame  The Project will be implemented over a period of five years, with \ncompletion expected by 31 December 2009. \n   \nProject Beneficiaries  The share of projected total capital and recurrent spending in the \npoorest 40% of communes will rise from 28% to 36% over the \nnext  five  years.  Similarly,  the  projected  spending  on  girls  will \nincrease from 42% of projected total spending to 46% by 2008. \nThe medium-term benefits will be (i) increased participation in \nbasic  education  for  the  poorest  40%  of  communes  for  an \nestimated 0.8 million students, (ii) increased participation in upper \nsecondary  education  for  0.2  million  students,  (iii)  enabling  an \nadditional 0.6 million children to progress annually to the next \ngrade of school, and (iv) expanded skills training opportunities for \nover 270,000 youths and adults in the poorest 40% of communes \nover 5 years.  \n \nThe longer-term benefits will be to provide more accessible and \nrelevant formal education to about 4.2 million school-age children \nand to put in place cost-effective and accessible skills training \nprograms  for  an  estimated  3.3  million  underemployed  young \npeople  aged  between  12  to  21  years  who  will  be  potential \nbeneficiaries of the Project.   ", "  v\nRisks and Safeguards  Limited leadership and ownership of the policy reform process \nand lack of consistency in policy and strategic decision making \npose potential risks. These will be mitigated in a number of ways: \n(i) the extensive ESP 2004\u20132008 policy dialogue process, (ii) the \nfollow-up  review  and  assessment  process  with  development \nagencies  and  NGOs  to  secure  broad  support  of  the  reform \nagenda, (iii) the annual ESSP review process which facilitates a \nphased and sequenced approach to policy implementation, and \n(iv) provision  by  ADB  and  from  advisory  support  of  other \ndevelopment  agencies  for  ongoing  policy  studies  and  related \nlegislative and regulatory reforms. \n \n  An uncertain fiscal climate and unforeseen developments (e.g., SARS \nin 2003 or avian influenza in 2004) also pose potential risks that may \nundermine the predictability of Government resources available for \neducation, especially the significant transitional costs associated with \nthe policy reforms. This potential risk will be mitigated through (i) \nextensive dialogue on medium-term resource availability for education, \n(ii) using the medium-term expenditure framework process as a basis \nfor identifying potential budget shortfalls and for mobilizing increased \nsector budget support, (iii) extensive sector efficiency measures to \ncontain expenditure growth, and (iv) strong policy linkage with the \nGovernment\u2019s broader public financial management reforms. \n \n  The  limited  capacity  of  MOEYS  and  MOLVT  to  manage  and \nimplement the revised policies and strategies is another potential \nrisk. Implementation of the Project by technical personnel based \non a policy of decentralization to provincial and district levels is \nessential for capacity building. An associated risk for both the \nupper  secondary  facilities  component  and  technical  and \nvocational education and training (TVET) and skills training is the \npotential that they may not be sustainable. These potential risks \nwill  be  mitigated  through  (i)  provision  of  extensive  advisory \nsupport for subsectoral and program planning and management, \n(ii) extensive dialogue on upper secondary, and TVET and skills \ntraining financing to sustain the National Training Fund training \nvoucher program, and (iii) technical assistance to ensure that an \nappropriate legislative and regulatory framework is in place. \n \nTechnical Assistance  It is proposed that ESDP II be accompanied by an advisory TA in \nthe  amount  of  $500,000.  The  TA  is  designed  to  strengthen \nMOEYS\u2019s capacity to plan and implement education regulatory \nreform and governance for decentralization. The objectives and \nscope of the advisory TA are to enable: (i) preparation of new \neducation law and key regulations related to improved institution \nand financial governance; (ii) improved transparency in use of \nparental and private contributions to schools and other institutions, \nthrough new guidelines on accounting and management of these \ncontributions;  and  (iii)  improved  governance  of  schools  and \npostsecondary institutions, through the issuance of guidelines that \nset  out  powers  and  responsibilities  of  education  authorities, \nparents and community associations. ", "", "  1\nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on two proposed \nloans to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Second Education Sector Development Program \n(ESDP II). The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building in \nEducation Regulatory Reform and Governance, and, if the Board approves the proposed loans, \nI, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \nII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  The Government of Cambodia has demonstrated continued commitment to pro-poor \neducation  reform  over  the  past  decade,  supported  by  a  broad  and  coordinated  external \nassistance program. The formulation of the Education Strategic Plan (ESP) and Education \nSector  Support  Program  (ESSP)  2001\u20132005  enabled  a  shift  from  reconstruction  to  more \nsustainable  policy-led  development,  including  a  greater  focus  on  pro-poor  systemic \ninterventions, especially aimed at reducing cost barriers to education access and quality. The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) assistance program for education has reflected this transition \nover the past decade.   \n \n3.  The Government and its partners recognize the need to accelerate poverty reduction as \nset out in the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS) and the Second Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan, 2001\u201305, including speeding up pro-poor education reforms.  In mid\u20132003, \nthe Government approved the National Education for All Plan 2003\u20132015, the goal of which is to \nprovide universal access to 9 years of high-quality basic education in line with the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDG). Cambodia\u2019s MDGs target the following for achievement by 2015: (i) \nreducing the number of poor by 50%; (ii) achieving the National Education for All Plan; and (iii) \nachieving gender equity. Accordingly, the ESP and ESSP are being reviewed and revised to \nconsolidate and extend the range of reforms for the period 2004 to 2008. The revised education \nsector policies are fully consistent with the Government's new Rectangular Strategy1 which \nplaces increased secondary and postsecondary education and training opportunities at the \ncenter of development priorities. The policy, strategic directions and targets as embodied in \nESP 2004\u201308 are in supplementary Appendix A. \n \nA.  Sector  Description and Performance  \n4.  The high dependence of the workforce on low-productivity agriculture limits opportunities \nto escape from poverty and is a major constraint on poverty reduction. Currently, 35\u201340% of the \npopulation has expenditures below the poverty line, with 15\u201320% living in extreme poverty. The \npercentage of the population below the poverty line is lowest in Phnom Penh (10\u201315%) and \nhighest in rural areas (40\u201345%). Around 80% of the poor live in the plains and Tonle Sap basin. \nPoverty is most severe in urban areas and the rural plateau and mountain zone, although these \nareas have relatively low incidence of poverty, indicating high levels of inequality. Almost 90% of \nthe  poor  are  rural.  Incidence  of  higher  levels  of  poverty  correlates  strongly  with  levels  of \nparticipation  in  education  and  training  and  geographical  variations  in  provision  of  basic \neducation and skills training. While households headed by women are not significantly poorer \nthan others, they are often more vulnerable. Women, who are the primary promoters of school \nattendance, are particularly vulnerable. They have less land and access to labor, and thus rely \n                                                 \n1  The Government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency includes capacity building \nand human resource development as one of the four rectangles. The strategy was presented by the Prime Minister \nto the first cabinet meeting of the new government on 16 July 2004. ", "2 \nmore on risky coping strategies, such as selling assets, or pulling children out of school and \nsending them to work.  \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities  \n5.  Cambodia\u2019s NPRS and Second Socio-Economic Development Plan highlight education \ndevelopment as central to poverty reduction and socioeconomic development. The revised ESP \ngoes  further  by  establishing  the  necessary  human  resources  and  infrastructure  for  sector \ndevelopment in the face of key constraints, such as the shallow human resource base from \nwhich to draw people to take on education sector tasks and the very limited training resources \nfor the large number of unemployed and undereducated youth. These constraints have to be \nmet,  while uncertainties  in  labor demand  are  prevalent  as  Cambodia  adjusts  to  economic \ntrends, including those arising from its recent entry into the World Trade Organization.  \n \n6.  Demographic and labor force trends will increase demand for education and training. \nThe labor force is estimated to be 6.4 million, or 49% of the total population.2 As Cambodia\u2019s \npopulation is relatively young, with more than half the population under 20 years of age, it is \nprojected that 150,000 to 175,000 people will join the labor force every year. High levels of \neconomic growth will be needed to translate this into job creation. The comparatively low \neducation level of the workforce, with 75% having primary education or lower and less than 3% \nhaving upper secondary, diploma or graduate qualifications, is recognized as a major constraint \non Cambodia\u2019s economic competitiveness and labor productivity. An education sector analysis \nis in Appendix 1. \n \n7.  Provision of education and training opportunities is a joint task of the general education \nsystem and the technical and vocational education and training (TVET) system. However, \namong youth 15 years and over, the reach of the general education system, and of the upper \nsecondary schools in particular, is limited because the great majority of youth drop out early. \nBased on school year 2002\u20132003 data, out of a cohort of 100 pupils entering grade 1, only 15 \nwill reach grade 12, of whom only 7 will pass the examination and be eligible to pursue higher \neducation. This puts the burden primarily on the TVET system. The current TVET delivery \nsystem  has  limited  capacity,  as  it  is  largely  supply-driven,  located  mainly  in  urban  areas, \nfragmented, and in need of significant quality improvement.  \n \n8.  The Government recognizes the urgency of action to expand education and training \nopportunities for the large and growing number of unemployed and underemployed young aged \n12\u201324 years. The related development challenges include (i) increased participation of the \npoorest families in both primary and secondary education; (ii) equitable access to good primary \nand secondary education; (iii) a reduced cost burden on the poor for education, through a \ncombination of new poverty-focused strategies and a strengthened education financing policy; \nand (iv) public\u2013private partnership in governance, management and financing of education, \nespecially beyond the first 9 years of basic education. ESDP II will build on the achievements of \nthe first ESDP.3  ESDP II is compatible with the framework and supports the broad policy and \nstrategic directions of ESP and the revised ESSP, 2004\u20132008. This process will ensure that \n                                                 \n2  Labor force survey, 2001.  \n3  ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans to the \nKingdom of Cambodia for the Education Sector Development Program. Manila (Loan 1864/1865-CAM(SF). The \nloans were approved on 4 December 2001 for $20 million equivalent in support of a policy reform program, and \n$18 million in an investment project to provide facilities development, and support for planning, management, and \nmonitoring. The program (Loan 1864) is expected to be completed by December 2004, and the project (Loan 1865) \nby December 2006. ", "3 \nESDP II is firmly embedded within the Government\u2019s reform agenda. The ESDP II program \nframework is in Appendix 2. \n \n1.  Education Access  \n9.  Since 2001, equity in access to basic education has improved. Primary and secondary \nschool enrollment has increased by 30%, with greater participation by children from poorest \nfamilies, girls and ethnic minorities. Repetition rates have fallen in the lower primary grades and \nmany  primary  and  lower  secondary  classrooms  have  been  built.  Yet  important  challenges \nremain, notably the need to (i) reduce cost barriers to basic education, alongside targeted cost-\nsharing for postbasic education services; (ii) reduce repetition and dropout rates at all levels, \nespecially in grades 1\u20136; (iii) improve private and community participation in grades 10\u201312, \nhigher  education  and  TVET,  through  targeted  and  demand-led  recurrent  and  capital \ndevelopment  financing;  and  (iv)  targeted  development  of  education  facilities  focused  on \neliminating incomplete primary schools and expanding provision for grades 7\u201312 in underserved \nareas. The Government is also exploring ways to respond to the training needs of the estimated \n3.3 million out-of-school youth aged 12\u201321 years. \n \n10.  Before 1998, the TVET and skills training provision was narrowly focused on providing \ncraft-level training for public sector workers and was not very responsive to a changing and fluid \nlabor market. Public TVET institutions were restricted to Phnom Penh, with little provincial level \nprovision. The strengthening of a network of 18 provincial training centers (PTC) and a more \ndemand-driven  National  Training  Fund  (NTF)  to  stimulate  private  and  nongovernment \norganization (NGO) providers provided the initial impetus for change. Since then, the TVET and \nskills training sector has been characterized by a diversity of public, private and NGO providers \nin TVET. Public TVET institutions enroll around 7,000 students per annum, and commercial and \nNGO providers around 4,000.  \n \n2.  Education Quality Improvement  \n11.  Over the last 4 years, there has been a substantial growth in spending by Government, \ndevelopment  agencies  and  NGOs  on  quality  improvement,  particularly  on  basic  education \nsupplies, recurrent spending on instructional materials, operational budgets in postsecondary \ninstitutions, including teacher training; school management training; reform of grade 9 and grade \n12 examination processes; and pilot testing of primary school standards. The priority will be to \nstrengthen these systems at upper secondary, TVET and skills training and higher education \nlevels.  \n \n12.  Before 2000, schools were heavily reliant on individual development agency projects to \nsupport their operational costs, including provision of basic supplies. In 2001/02 the Ministry of \nEducation, Youth and Sport (MOEYS) introduced nationwide operational budgets to all schools \nthrough  the  Government\u2019s  own  financial  management  systems.  During  2002/03,  MOEYS \nallocated a total of KR31.5 billion to primary and secondary schools for the procurement of basic \nsupplies and teaching materials and for carrying out improvements to the school environment. \nGrant allocation formulas are specifically designed to be pro-poor, through higher allocations to \nsmaller schools frequently located in the poorest communes.   \n \n3.  Education Service Efficiency  \n13.  The Government has committed to continue the strategies initiated during ESP 2001\u2013\n2005, while ensuring a greater focus on improvements in staff efficiency and performance and ", "4 \ngreater accountability through performance monitoring. The main strategies are (i) improved \neducation  service  efficiency  and  performance,  (ii)  decentralized  school  and  institution \nmanagement,  (iii)  sustainable  curriculum  reform  and  instructional  materials  provision, \n(iv) decentralized teacher development, and (v) improved performance monitoring. Before 2000, \nhigh repetition rates in primary grades resulted in significant additional costs to the Government \nand parents, contributing to significant student dropout rates from the poorest families in the \nhigher  primary  grades.  Since  2001,  MOEYS  has  moved  on  two  strategic  priorities:  (i)  to \nintroduce cost-effective remedial programs alongside monitoring of primary grade standards, \nand (ii) phasing out of incomplete primary schools through better use of existing staff and \nfacilities and selective classroom expansion.  \n \n4.  Teacher Education and Supply \n14.  Teacher  education  enrollment  has  remained  roughly  constant  in  recent  years.  An \nincreasingly important issue is improving the matching of teacher supply and demand with \nproposed education sector expansion. Forward planning will take account of the projected fall in \noverall primary enrollment and expansion of secondary enrollment, requiring a reorientation of \nteacher supply and demand and staff deployment strategies. MOEYS has introduced specific \nguidelines for the recruitment of teacher trainees from remote areas as a strategy for education \nservice improvement in remote schools.   \n \n15.  The quality of the teaching service continues to improve gradually. The number of \ntrained primary school teachers increased from about 42,000 in 1999/00 to 47,000 in 2002/03.  \nThe number of trained secondary school teachers increased from 17,800 to 22,700 over the \nsame  period,  and  a  greater  share  now  has  upper  secondary  education  or  graduate \nqualifications. Nevertheless, a significant proportion of classroom teachers have only primary \nand lower secondary education qualifications, and these are disproportionally concentrated in \nunderserved, rural and remote schools. MOEYS continues to devote increased resources to \npre- and in-service teacher training, alongside expanded management training opportunities for \nschool directors.   \n \n16.  A key issue is the need to provide more equitable access to good upper secondary \n(grades 10\u201312) education to generate school graduates from all provinces who are qualified for \nhigher education studies. There are significant provincial variations in pass rates of grade 12 \nexaminations and this affects the longer-term supply of graduates (including school teachers). A \nstrategic priority is to ensure a sustained supply of well-qualified grade 12 students in each \nprovince to break this vicious circle of reliance on four or five provinces to supply graduate \nteachers for secondary education. \n \n17.  Included in the sector development program (SDP) policy reform agenda are (i) putting \nin place appropriate regulatory guidelines that will result in increased equity and efficiency of \nteacher  development,  through  formulation  of  operational  guidelines  on  the  role  and \nresponsibilities of teacher training colleges in response to changing primary and secondary \nteacher  supply  needs:  and  (ii)  adjusting  the  salary  and  nonsalary  shares  of  education \nexpenditure through graduated improvements in performance-based teacher allowances. One \nof  the  specific  assurances  in  the  loan  agreement  is  that  the  Government  will  ensure  an \nadequate  supply  of  appropriately  qualified  lower  and  upper  secondary  school  teachers  in \nselected project schools. The World Bank\u2019s Basic Education Support Program will support \nteacher development. \n ", "5 \n5.  Trends in Education Budget Allocations \n18.  Education  sector  expenditure  has  increased  significantly  since  1997.  In  that  year, \nrecurrent  expenditure  on  education  was  an  estimated  9\u201310%  of  the  national  budget. \nSubsequently, education\u2019s share has increased steadily, reaching 19.5% in 2003/04. Recurrent \nspending  volume  has  increased  more  than  threefold  over  the  same  period,  reaching \nKR368 billion (around $92 million) by 2003/04. The Government is now the main contributor to \neducation financing, providing an estimated 50% (2.1% of gross domestic product in 2004), \ncompared with an estimated 21% in 1997. An indicative medium-term expenditure plan and \nfinancing  strategy  for  the  period  2004\u20132008  is  in  supplementary  Appendix  B.  Parental \ncontributions,  both  formal  and  informal,  have  remained  high  at  an  estimated  30\u201335%  in \n2003/04, although the abolition of the start-of-the-year contribution for basic education has \nreduced contributions at this level. The majority of operational spending has focused on quality \nimprovement (e.g., sustainable textbook financing, teacher training) and interventions designed \nto improve access by the poor (e.g., scholarships for poor students and girls4). MOEYS\u2019s \nrecurrent budget priorities and programs are in supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n19.  Following a decline in the late 1990s, external support for education has expanded \nsignificantly in recent years and is currently estimated at around $50 million a year. This is due \nto  an  improvement  in  the  definition  and  implementation  of  sector  priorities  and  programs, \nthrough the joint Government, development agencies and NGO ESP and ESSP process. A key \ncharacteristic  has  been  the  shift  in  development  agencies  support  from  individual  project \nactivities and related expenditure towards a more policy-led and results-based sector-wide \nfinancing  strategy.  Another  trend  over  the  past  five  years  has  been  increased  external \nassistance for basic education, especially for facilities and capacity building for decentralization. \nThere has been limited support for upper secondary education expansion, TVET and skills \ntraining and higher education. However, these sectors are becoming a growing priority, as \ndemand from expanded basic education opportunities creates pressure higher up the system. \nThe Government and MOEYS recognize the critical importance of financing if access and \nquality  improvement  policies,  including  a  combination  of  pro-poor  systemic  and  targeted \ninterventions, are to be implemented. MOEYS capital budget priorities and programs are in \nsupplementary Appendix D. \n \n6.  Government Objectives and Strategic Priorities \n20.  The Government\u2019s long-term goal is to assure equitable access to 9 years of high- \nquality  basic  education  by  2015,  alongside  a  growing  and  well  regulated  public\u2013private \npartnership  in  upper  secondary  education,  TVET  and  skills  training.  The  next  phase  of \neducation reform set out in the revised ESP, 2004\u20132008, will accelerate implementation of \nthese policies and strategies. Nevertheless, the broad policy and strategic directions can be \nderived in the current the National Education for All Plan, 2003\u20132015, which is in harmony with \nESP, 2004\u201308.  \n \n21.  The overarching policy priority for ESP, 2004\u20132008, is to introduce further systemic cost \nreductions for families through the abolition of informal payments across grades 1 to 9 and to \nreduce repetition and dropout rates, which create additional burdens for parents. An associated \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2002. Targeted Assistance for Education of Poor Girls and Poor Children in Ethnic Minority Areas. Manila \n(JFPR 9028-CAM). The mechanisms and indicators for monitoring the poverty reduction impact of the program \ninclude (i) poverty and socioeconomic status; (ii) risk of dropping out of school; (iii) distance of home to school; and \n(iv) parental attitudes towards education.  ", "6 \nstrategy will be to introduce systemic and performance-based teacher remuneration reforms, \nextending the narrower targeted teacher allowances introduced in the last three years. These \nstrategies will be complemented by an expansion of facilities development programs in currently \nunderserved areas.  \n \n22.  ESP,  2001\u20132005,  focused  only  on  limited  expansion  of  postbasic  education \nopportunities by enabling incremental growth of public\u2013private partnerships. ESP, 2004\u20132008, \naims to further stimulate demand-side interventions by promoting and enabling community and \nprivate sector involvement in upper secondary education, skills training, higher education and \nearly childhood care and development. A key target group for these interventions will be the \ngrowing number of underskilled and underemployed youth who will be the long-term engine of \nCambodia\u2019s socioeconomic development. \n \n23.  The  Government  has  prioritized  some  cross-cutting  issues,  including  ensuring  that \nstrategies and programs bring benefits to females and ethnic minorities. In consultation with the \nNational AIDS Authority, MOEYS has prepared a policy and strategic framework for HIV/AIDS5 \neducation, designed  to  enable  implementation  of  broader  access and  quality  improvement \npolicies and the use of schooling to reduce vulnerability to HIV/AIDS for disadvantaged groups \n(an analysis of HIV/AIDS education issues and programming is in supplementary Appendix E). \nThe  revised  education  reform  plan  also  incorporates  strategic  measures  for  the  use  of \ninformation and communications technology (ICT) in education to improve access and quality \nimprovement, including distance learning and curriculum enrichment. \n \n7.  External Assistance to the Sector \n24.  External  assistance  is  increasingly  well  coordinated  through  the  joint  annual  ESSP \nreview process, conducted by the Government, MOEYS, development agencies, and NGOs.  \nThe ESP and ESSP frameworks are used by all partners as a basis for screening and selection \nof  external  assistance,  ensuring  optimum  complementarity.  Increasingly,  the  ESSP  review \nprocess is used to assess the impact of current external assistance, make adjustments to, and \nnegotiate the forward pipeline of support, and has been used as a vehicle for planning ESDP II \nand  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Basic  Education  Support  Program.  In  2002  and  2003,  through  the \nEducation Sector Working Group of development agencies and NGO Education Partnership, \nboth  groups  prepared  their  own  assessment  of  external  assistance  and  collated  financial \ninformation on programming prospects and disbursements.  \n \n25.  External assistance for education has grown significantly in the past five years as mutual \nconfidence among the Government and development agencies in the direction and impact of \nreform has increased. Total external funding to the sector for the period 2002\u20132007 is estimated \nto be $282.5 million, with $44.5 million actually spent in 2002, $44.7 million estimated for 2003 \nand $193.3 million projected for 2004\u201307. Of the total projected financing for the 2002\u20132007 \nperiod, 42% is expected to come from ADB and the World Bank. Other large amounts are \ncommitted  by  United  Nations  agencies,  in  particular  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund \n(UNICEF) and the United Nations World Food Program, the European Commission and the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Details of external assistance to the sector are \nin Appendix 3 and the development coordination matrix is in Appendix 4. \n \n26.  A  recent  trend  has  been  the  shift  in  external  assistance  towards  basic  education, \ncompared with the late 1990s when much education aid focused on support for TVET and \n                                                 \n5  Human immunodeficiency virus/ acquired immune deficiency syndrome ", "7 \nhigher education. To date, external assistance for upper secondary education development, \nskills training for unemployed youth in rural areas and higher education has been limited. The \nESSP review (2003) highlighted the need to finalize strategies and begin mobilizing resources in \nthese  underserved  subsectors,  while  still  ensuring  that  sufficient  resources  for  primary \neducation quality improvement and lower secondary access expansion were available. Another \ncharacteristic has been the growing diversity of means of support.  \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s Strategy and Operations in the Sector  \n27.  ADB\u2019s  education  sector  strategy  is  to enable implementation  of  education  policy  in \nsupport of balanced development. In Cambodia, ADB will build upon the ESDP\u2019s major role in \nmobilizing international support for education. ADB's involvement is built on the ESP, which \ncovers  all  levels  of  schooling,  including  technical  education,  and  emphasizes  institutional \ncapacity building, policy reforms and infrastructure support. Considerable progress has been \nachieved in implementing the ESSP, especially in expanding primary education for the poor, \nincreased budgets for education; growing and strong partnerships in education, and significant \ncommunity mobilization and decentralization of education planning and management. \n \n28.  In particular, ESDP II gives greater emphasis to governance and regulatory reform, as \nhighlighted in the Country Assistance Program Evaluation for Cambodia.6 Greater strategic \nlinkage between the policy framework of the program loan and the investment project is also \nreflected in ESDP II. The ESDP has contributed significantly to pro-poor education policy, \nmarked by the 40% increase in primary school enrolment in the poorest 300 communes in \nCambodia. Enrollment has increased with the abolition of the start-of-year fees, resulting in the \nenrollment of an extra 500,000 children from the poorest families in primary schools. ADB has \ncontributed to service decentralization to over 6,000 schools and 183 district offices, thereby \nincreasing grassroots powers and responsibilities for education. A nationwide textbook program \nin over 6,000 schools has resulted in better opportunities for teaching and learning for over \n3 million students and 70,000 teachers.  \n \n29.  In support of ESDP, (i) an advisory TA, Performance Management in the Education \nSector,7 was completed in January 2004; (ii) the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR)-\nfunded Targeted Assistance for Education of Poor Girls and Poor Children in Ethnic Minority \nAreas,8 is being implemented; and (iii) in cooperation with the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs \n(MOWA), Sustainable Employment Promotion for Poor Women9 was approved in December \n2002 to promote income-generating activities for rural women. The Basic Skills Project10 was \ncompleted in May 2002 and the Basic Education Textbook Project11 was completed in April \n2002. A proposed JFPR project12 is designed to support incomplete primary schools at the \nprimary school level. ADB is assessing the scope for providing complementary support through \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2004. Country Assistance Program Evaluation for Cambodia.

As a pilot initiative, the project aims to provide facilities improvement and capacity building in the \npoorest 340 communes in six provinces. The sites of the 340 schools will be selected in the same areas where \nESDP II school sites will be located.  ", "8 \nsubregional Greater Mekong Subregion programs for education development in border areas, \nespecially related to addressing child trafficking and HIV/AIDS vulnerability in these areas.  \n \n30.  Overall, ADB\u2019s responsiveness and the size of its portfolio is significant, in particular: \n(i) ADB\u2019s  pioneering  sector-wide  approach  and  long-term  commitment  to  education  in \nCambodia;  and  (ii)  the  relatively  large  size  of  ADB\u2019s  education  program  and  its  strong \ncombination of lending and technical assistance, which have fostered policy dialogue with the \nGovernment, other development agencies and stakeholders. Moreover, since 2001, extensive \nADB  technical  assistance  for  planning  and  management  of  the  annual  joint  MOEYS, \ndevelopment  agencies  and  NGOs  education  sector  performance  review  has  established \npartnerships and strengthened the role of the education sector working group of development \nagencies and the NGO education partnership. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Objectives and Scope  \n31.  The overall objective of ESDP II is to contribute to poverty reduction in Cambodia by \nimproving access to and the quality of basic and upper secondary education, and lifelong \nlearning opportunities for out-of-school youth. ESDP II will support the long-term goal of the \neducation reform by establishing a market-responsive education and training system that will \nenable an increased level of education attainment in the workforce and increased household \nincome. The objective is to support the implementation of ESP 2004\u20132008 and ESSP 2004\u2013\n2008  through  (i)  improved  resource  mobilization  and  allocations  for  the  education  sector; \n(ii) increased  access  to  education  and  training  opportunities,  especially  for  currently \nunderserved areas and disadvantaged groups; (iii) improved standards, quality and internal \nefficiency, and consequent sustainability in the education sector; and (iv) effective capacity \nbuilding  for  decentralization  in  education  services.  The  program  and  project  loan  will \ncomplement each other to enable progress towards achieving these key sectoral objectives.   \n \nB.  Important Features \n32.  The four policy areas and the three investment project components cover a wide range \nof educational activities, which will make the SDP a challenge to implement. However, all parts \nreinforce one another and fall under the Government\u2019s own action plans. Links to the World \nBank project in lower secondary schools, European Commission budget support in key policy \nareas, and JICA programs supporting science education, all help to raise the support level of \ndevelopment agencies and are mutually reinforcing. The accompanying advisory TA and an \ninnovative JFPR project also lend capacity building support to the ministry by targeting rural \nareas that lack schools with complete grades 1\u20139. Overall, the SDP is pro-poor and prioritizes \nrural areas, females and minorities. There is an HIV/AIDS component as well as extensive \ncoordination with development agencies. The SDP demonstrates how education is adapting to \nchanges in sector lending. \n \n1.  Poverty Impact \n \n33.  Despite impressive improvements in the education sector in the last decade, significant \npoverty-related constraints remain, including lack of facilities in the poorest, most remote and \nunderserved districts and communes; incomplete primary schools; and insufficient resources to \nexpand  programs  with  poverty-targeted  incentives.  ESDP  and  JFPR  programs  are  having \nsignificant impact on these issues and have contributed to improvements. The purpose of ESDP ", "9 \nII will be to consolidate current initiatives and extend them using new poverty-targeted strategies \nand broader coverage, consistent with the Government\u2019s NPRS, 2003\u20132005. Further support is \nneeded for the ongoing annual education poverty impact analysis, designed to assess the \ninfluence  of  the  reform  program  on  poor  families,  girls,  ethnic  minorities  and  other \ndisadvantaged groups. Operational research is needed to assess the impact at the household \nlevel, including changes in education expectations, decision making and priorities, especially for \npost-basic education opportunities. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in \nAppendix 5. \n \n2.  Involuntary Resettlement \n \n34.  Improvements  to  existing  schools  under  the  Project  will  not  require  any  new  land. \nConstruction of new schools will be carried out only on vacant and idle land owned by the \nGovernment that is free from all encumbrances, habitation, dispute or controversy, and mostly \nadjacent to existing schools. Only subprojects categorized as C13 in accordance with ADB\u2019s \npolicy on involuntary resettlement and its policies in the Operations Manual, and meeting the \nselection criteria for school sites, as set out in Appendix 6, will be selected.  \n \n3.  Ethnic Minorities \n \n35.  Ethnic minorities, while part of some communes assisted under the Project, are not \nparticularly targeted. They will enjoy the benefits accruing to these communes and villages as \nmembers. Supplementary Appendix F contains analyses of gender and ethnic minority issues. \n \n4.  Gender Mainstreaming \n \n36.  A five-year gender mainstreaming strategy was adopted by MOEYS in 2002. It has three \nmain  components:  (i)  equal  access  by  girls  to  education,  (ii)  enhancing  gender  equity  in \neducation  management  and  delivery  of  services,  and  (iii)  strengthening  gender  technical \ncapacity  in  education  programming  and  policy  making.  Project  design  has  drawn  on  this \nstrategy, as well as the progress reports of the JFPR scholarships for girls program. The \nMission suggested drawing up of an action plan with clear targets that the Project could support. \nAn analysis of gender issues with an action plan and program in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nPolicies  on  Gender  and  Development  and  Indigenous  Peoples  is  given  in  supplementary \nAppendix F. \n \n  5.  Environment \n \n37.  The Project\u2019s environmental impacts were reviewed and no significant adverse impacts \nwere identified. A civil works component covering water supply and toilet facilities is small-scale. \nActivities resulting from the Project will not cause pollution, health hazards, or soil erosion. The \nProject is categorized as Category C. The site selection, design, construction, replacement work \nand operation of school facilities will be implemented in accordance with the relevant regulations \nand standards of the Borrower as well as the ADB\u2019s environment policy.  \n                                                 \n13  Category C projects are those that do not have foreseen involuntary resettlement effects. They require neither a \nresettlement plan nor a resettlement framework. ", "10 \nC.  The Program Loan \n \n1.  Objectives \n38.  The program loan will support policy interventions aimed at (i) improving equity in access \nto  education  and  training  services  through  pro-poor  systemic  and  targeted  interventions; \n(ii) improving  quality  and  internal  efficiency  through  more  effective  curriculum  organization, \nimproved student progression, enhancing the teaching and learning environment, and improved \nstandard  monitoring  and  quality  assurance;  (iii)  enhancing  capacity  for  greater  education \ndecentralization through strengthened financial planning, management and audit systems, a \nmore  focused  human  resource  planning  system,  and  more  efficient  staff  performance \nmanagement, deployment and reward systems; and (iv) increasing resource mobilization linked \nto measures that ensure resource allocation is pro-poor, equitable and efficient.   \n \n39.  Since the adoption of ESP and ESSP in 2001, the Government has realized some major \nachievements in education sector reform, facilitated by extensive policy and strategic dialogue \nwith  ADB  technical  assistance  and  advisory  support  from  UNICEF  and  the  Swedish \nInternational Development Agency (Sida), the World Bank, the European Commission and the \nNGO community. The next phase of ESP reform, from 2004 to 2008, is designed to deepen and \nextend the reform program with a view to achieving (i) further reductions in cost barriers for \nbasic  education  access,  alongside  the  extension  of  well-regulated  and  managed  parental \ncontributions  in  post-basic  education;  (ii)  expansion  of  secondary  education  opportunities, \nespecially in poorer and underserved rural communes; (iii) a more demand-driven approach to \nexpanded skills training opportunities, especially in the poorest 40% of communes which are \nseverely  underserved;  (iv)  improved  quality  and  standards  in  schools  by  strengthening \neducation governance mechanisms and accountability at the school-community interface; and \n(v) greater delegated authority to provinces, districts and schools for planning and management \nof resources, alongside extensive capacity building in financial management and audit.  \n \n40.  Faced with prospective budget constraints, the Government recognizes that financial \nsustainability will require not only additional resource mobilization, but also gains in efficiency \nand  other  forms  of  cost  containment.  The  key  feature  of  this  phase  of  reform  will  be  to \nimplement systemic efficiency gains (e.g., reduce repetition and make more efficient use of staff \nand facilities) so that additional resources can be directed towards service expansion. This \nphase also recognizes that directing more resources to quality-oriented activities will not be \nenough to improve standards. Accordingly, greater emphasis will be given to target setting, \nstandard setting and student performance monitoring systems. A critical cross-cutting reform will \nbe  to  adjust  the  salary  and  nonsalary  shares  of  education  expenditure  through  gradual \nimprovements  in  performance-based  teacher  allowances,  building  on  the  initial  program \nintroduced in 2002. Increased teacher remuneration is also designed to reduce demands for \ninformal payments from parents (a major access barrier) and promote increased community \noversight and accountability of school performance.  \n \n41.  The initial phase of ESP and ESSP implementation benefited from high-level political \nsupport, strong strategic leadership, and significant increases in Government resources for \neducation. It is recognized that the next phase of reform may face fiscal constraints and meet \nresistance from a range of education stakeholders. ESDP II is designed to meet part of the \nadjustment costs and to contain pressure on public resources. The proposed phasing and \nsequencing of the reforms, particularly undertaking initial capacity building before nationwide \nimplementation, is designed to mobilize support and ensure that the reform strategies are \ntechnically sound.  ", "11 \n42.  ESDP proved effective at providing an initial policy action framework for education. \nConsultations with development agencies and NGOs intensified over the last few years. The \nESDP policy matrix provided a framework for mobilization of additional sector budget and \ninvestment  support  from  education  partners.  The  ESDP  II  policy  framework  will  facilitate \nongoing policy and strategy dialogue with the Government, the MOEYS and partners and \nprovide a basis for a phased and sequenced approach to mobilizing additional resources from \nthe Government and development agencies. \n \n43.  From the perspective of the education sector, the SDP approach applied in Cambodia \nfits well with donor coordination and the Government\u2019s own education priority agenda. ADB is \nthe acknowledged leader in the education sector in Cambodia and the program loan will enable \nADB to continue its leadership. The overall design is balanced, and the program matrix and \nactivities are consistent with the MDGs. The investment project reinforces the policy matrix by \nhelping the Government to expand and strengthen the system to meet the MDGs and the sector \nprogram goals. Development agencies in Cambodia have bought into the policy reform agenda \nunder the overall ESP program framework, which will enable convergence and efficient use of \nresources. The SDP takes the process of Government, development agency, NGO, and ADB \ncoordination to a full sector-wide approach that can serve as a comprehensive model for the \nregion. \n \n2.  Components and Outputs \n44.  The medium-term policy framework of ESDP II is described in the development policy \nletter prepared by the Government (Appendix 7). The critical policy actions related to the four \nmain sector challenges are in the sector core policy matrix (Appendix 8). The policy matrix \nspecifies (i) the anticipated outcomes and associated policy actions; (ii) implementation modes \nand monitoring arrangements; (iii) time frame for specific actions; (iv) indicative phasing and \nsequencing  of  actions  and  follow-up;  (v)  associated  legislative,  regulatory  and  governance \nmeasures;  (vi)  responsible  Government  agencies  and  interministerial  coordination \nrequirements;  and  (vii)  associated  resource  mobilization  and  allocation.  The  phasing  and \nsequencing of the proposed policy actions reflect the progressive and graduated nature of the \nimplementation process, recognizing that there will be potential constraints and risks. These \npolicy actions and related recurrent and capital budget implications will be guided by overall \nESP and ESSP financing framework.   \n \n3.  Financing Plan \n45.  It is proposed that ADB support the Government\u2019s education policy reform program by \nproviding a program loan of $20 million equivalent from its Special Funds resources. The loan \nwill have a term of 24 years, including an 8-year grace period and an interest charge of 1% per \nannum during the grace period, and 1.5% thereafter. The program will be implemented over a \nperiod of 3 years from the second quarter of 2005 to the end of 2007, and will be disbursed in \nthree tranches (see also para. 50). It is expected that completion will be in December 2007 and \nthe loan closing date will be 30 June 2008.  \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangements  \n46.  MOEYS  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  policy \nmeasures. A steering committee will be established for the program and project loan. The \ncommittee will be chaired by the secretary of state, MOEYS, and will comprise representatives \nfrom the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), the Ministry of Planning, the Council for ", "12 \nAdministrative Reform (within the Council of Ministers), the Ministry of Interior, MOEYS, and \nMOWA. Other ministries such as the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Rural Development, and \nthe  Ministry  of  Social  Affairs  and  Youth  Rehabilitation  may  be  invited.  Existing  technical \ncommittees  will  monitor  the  implementation  of  specific  components  of  the  program.  A \nsubcommittee,  chaired  by  MOLVT,  will  oversee  project  implementation  under  the  third \ncomponent of the Project. MEF will allocate and monitor the use of counterpart funds that will be \nused to support the education reform package. \n \n5.  Procurement and Disbursement \n47.  The program loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items \nproduced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding items included in a list of ineligible \nitems  (Appendix  9)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  The \nBorrower will certify that the volume of eligible imports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected \ndisbursements under the program loan in a given period. ADB will have the right to audit the use \nof the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. \n \n6.  Counterpart Funds \n48.  The counterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the program loan will supplement \nthe Government\u2019s pro-poor budget, targeted at protecting service provision to the poor, and as \nagreed between the Government and ADB, protect allocation to the education sector. The \ncounterpart  funds  generated  from  the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be  used  by  the \nGovernment in order of priority: (i) to finance costs associated with the implementation of the \npackage of education policy reforms under the Program, (ii) as part of the contribution of the \nGovernment  to  ADB-funded  education  projects,  and  (iii)  as  part  of  the  contribution  of  the \nGovernment to ADB-funded projects in other social sectors.  \n \n7.  Monitoring and Tranching \n49.  The Government, through the steering committee, will monitor the implementation of \npolicy,  legal  and  institutional  reforms  envisaged  under  the  program,  and  every  year  the \nGovernment, ADB, other development agencies, and NGOs will review implementation and \nassess the impact of all reforms in the education sector as part of joint education sector \nperformance reviews. \n \n50.  The  loan  for  the  program  will  be  released  in  three  tranches.  The  first  tranche  of \n$5 million will be made available upon loan effectiveness and it is envisaged it will be disbursed \nin early or mid-2005. The second and third tranches of $7.5 million each will be released upon \ncompliance  with  agreed  conditions.  The  Government  will  be  required  to  fulfill  the  actions \nspecified in the policy matrix (Appendix 8) and to demonstrate satisfactory progress in the \nimplementation of the rest of the program before the second and third tranches are released. It \nis expected that the second tranche will be released about 12 to 15 months after the release of \nthe first, or earlier, subject to the Government\u2019s fulfillment of the conditions. It is expected that \nthe third tranche will be released about 12 months after the release of the second, or earlier, \nsubject to the Government\u2019s fulfillment of the conditions for the third tranche.   \n \n51.  In order to assist coordination of policy conditions with those of other ongoing providers \nof budget support (e.g., the European Commission\u2019s) and future potential providers, the annual \njoint ESSP review exercise will form a key component of the policy performance monitoring \nprocess. Satisfactory progress towards the finally agreed ESP core performance will also be a ", "13 \nkey monitoring tool based on an overall judgment by ADB of: (i) equitable access, (ii) quality and \nefficiency,  and  (iii)  institutional  and  financial  performance  indicators.  Where  possible,  loan \nmonitoring and supervision and midterm review missions will be harmonized with the joint ESSP \nreview exercises. \n \nD.  The Project Loan \n1.  Objectives \n52.  The objectives of the Project are to supplement the policy initiatives under the Program \nand to enhance equitable access, improve the quality of lower and upper secondary education, \nand provide demand driven, community-based skills training opportunities mainly for the out-of-\nschool youth, in underserved areas, through (i) lower secondary education opportunities, (ii) \nupper  secondary  education  opportunities,  and  (iii)  community-based  skills  training  in  poor \ncommunes. The investment project will (i) support key policy development in these three areas, \n(ii) complete the infrastructure requirements of lower secondary education and consolidate the \ngains of recent years, (iii) establish an initial network of high quality upper secondary model \nschools,  provide  schools  in  districts  where  there  are  none,  and  rehabilitate existing  upper \nsecondary schools where needed, (iii) enhance capacity of national and provincial training \nboards to facilitate skills training in the poorest communes, (iv) introduce a sustainable skills \ntraining voucher system, and (v) strengthen standards monitoring at upper secondary and TVET \nand skills training levels. Core ESP performance indicators are in supplementary Appendix G. \n \n2.  Components and Outputs \na.  Expanding Lower Secondary Education Opportunities \n53.  The MOEYS target is to increase enrollment to around 1 million in lower secondary \neducation over the next 5 to 7 years. Currently, it is estimated that there are between 800 and \n900 communes that do not have a lower secondary school. The lack of immediate access to \nlower secondary schooling in these communes contributes to low progression and transition \nrates from commune-based primary schools.  \n \n54.  The Project will provide improved access to lower secondary education in unserved and \nunderserved communes through: (i) provision of around 400 lower secondary school buildings \nin selected high-demand communes, and (ii) staff development (training of central, provincial \nand  district  education  staff  for  decentralized  delivery  of  education;  planning,  financial \nmanagement, monitoring; district and community level program implementation). To support \n(i) and  (ii),  the  Project  will  provide  equipment,  furniture,  instructional  materials,  computers, \ntraining, consulting services, civil works, utility vehicles and motorcycles. Detailed geographical \nand other targeting criteria will be based on a basic education facilities development plan \nprepared by MOEYS in order to coordinate support from ADB, the World Bank, the Government \nof Belgium, the proposed JFPR project on incomplete schools and other potential donors. The \nselection criteria for school sites are in Appendix 6.  \n \nb.  Expanding Upper Secondary Education Opportunities \n55.  The overall strategy is to ensure more equitable access to high-quality upper secondary \neducation in each of Cambodia\u2019s provinces in order to produce secondary school graduates \ncapable  of  undertaking  higher  and/or  further  education  studies.  Currently,  the  majority  of \nuniversity undergraduates and graduates originate from four or five provinces, resulting in over-", "14 \nreliance on deployment of these graduates (especially as teachers) to more remote provinces. \nThe  overall  strategy  is  to  create  a  virtuous  circle  of  linkage  between  high-quality  upper \nsecondary schools in each province, including an emphasis on science, mathematics and ICT. \nThese students will be fully prepared for either (i) bachelor degree programs at the Royal \nUniversity of Phnom Penh and other public and private universities or (ii) first or second year \ncertificate of foundation studies at other higher education institutions. JICA is already supporting \nsome science, mathematics and ICT components of the program. \n \n56.  The Project will provide improved access to high-quality upper secondary education in \neach province through: (i) the construction of 24 model upper secondary school buildings with \nscience and computer laboratories, one in each province and municipality; (ii) the construction \nof 25 new upper secondary schools in half of rural districts that are without such schools; \n(iii) refurbishment of 25 upper secondary schools; and (iv) staff development (training of central, \nprovincial and district education staff for decentralized delivery of education; planning, financial \nmanagement, monitoring; district and community level program implementation). To support \n(i) and (ii), the Project will provide equipment, furniture, civil works, consulting services, training, \nlaboratory equipment, computers, office supplies, vehicles and motorcycles. It is envisaged that \nthe 24 model secondary schools will have enrollments of 1,500\u20132000 students per school in \ngrades 10\u201312. It is also proposed that, under the program loan, 10\u201320% of students in each \nschool will be awarded merit-driven scholarships under the upper secondary priority action \nprogram (PAP) equitable access program.   \n \nc.  Demand-Driven Community-Based Skills Training \n57.  The overall objective of this component is to initiate the first phase of a demand-driven \nand community-based skills training program. This will include establishing a network for the \nmanagement and organization of TVET and skills training planning at central, provincial, district \nand commune levels, including using existing providers and stimulating new providers. The \ntarget groups comprise out-of-school youth, unemployed and underemployed youths and adults \nin the poorest 40% of communes in seven provinces14 initially, with priority given to the 15\u201321 \nage group. In a survey of school leavers, about 75% in this age group expressed interest in \ntaking short skills training courses.  \n \n58.  The  proposed  component  consists  of  three  subcomponents:  (i)  NTF  support  for \ncommune training vouchers in seven provinces at $5,000 per commune per year over three \nyears for short courses in skills training; (ii) NTF equipment and facilities adjustment fund; and \n(iii) central, provincial and commune TVET system capacity building, including a longer-term \nfurther  education  and/or  community  lifelong  learning  institutional  development  program.  To \nsupport  the  three  subcomponents,  the  Project  will  provide  (i)  equipment  and/or  facilities, \ncomputers  and  software;  furniture  for  industrial  skills  training,  commerce  and  business \nmanagement; (ii) training to central staff and system strengthening at the National Training \nBoard, Directorate General of TVET, and at provincial, district and commune levels at provincial \ntraining centers, provincial training boards, and provincial training committees as well as to \ncommunity  development  specialists;  (iii)  consulting  services  for  policy  and  institutional \ndevelopment, a community-based skills training system, institutional, management and financial \nsystems development, and community development; (iv) administrative support through the \n                                                 \n14  The initial phase will cover 210 communes in these seven provinces. The selection will be based on a number of \ncriteria  including  poverty  incidence,  population  size,  availability  of  training  providers,  and  geographic \nrepresentation. The eligible communes within each province will be those that belong to the top 40% ranked \naccording to the weighted average of poverty index (75% weight) developed by the World Food Program and \npopulation size (25% weight) since some communes have high poverty levels, but very small populations.  ", "15 \nprovision of office equipment and supplies, including computers, together with accessories and \nsoftware,  utility  vehicles  and  motorcycles.  The  overall  investment  cost  for  nationwide \nimplementation  is  estimated  at  $15  million.  However,  only  seven  provinces  will  initially  be \ncovered at an investment cost of around $6 million. Detailed community-based skills training \nselection criteria are set out in Appendix 10.  \n \n59.  The key components of PTC capacity building will be to: (i) facilitate and coordinate \nprovincial  and  commune  skills  training  plans;  (ii)  manage  the  activities  of  the  proposed \ncommunity  development  specialists  who  will  enable  formulation  and  implementation  of \ncommune  training  plans,  taking  account  of  potential  training  providers;  (iii)  support  the \noperations  of  the  provincial  training  boards  and  mobilize  and  coordinate  financing  at  the \nprovincial  level;  (iv)  organize  and  contract  private  sector  trainers;  (v)  coordinate  potential \nemployers as trainers as part of commune-level training delivery; (vi) coordinate the use of \nNGOs as potential training partners; and (vii) mobilize wats, village trainers and community-\nbased training resources, especially for informal equivalency programs, HIV/AIDS awareness, \nliteracy and self-learning activities. The National Technical Training Institute will assist in the \nimplementation of the overall program. \n \ni.  NTF Support for Commune Training Vouchers \n60.  The  Project  will  use  National  Training  Board  (NTB),  whose  membership  will  be \nreconstituted  following  the  establishment  of  MOLVT,  and  the  NTF  to  implement  this \nsubcomponent.  The  main  activity  will  be  to  provide  the  poorest  communes  with  training \nvouchers to enable a more demand-driven approach. The award of the voucher to individual \ncommunes will be based on the formulation of a skills training plan, which will be based on the \nneeds and opportunities in the community. A community development specialist from the PTC \nwill help to draw up the plan. The primary targets of the program are the poor. Within the seven \ntargeted provinces, the poorest 40% of communes will receive training vouchers of up to $5,000 \nper  year  for  the  next  three  years,  with  the  award  for  the  succeeding  year  subject  to  the \nperformance and disbursement of the preceding year.  \n \n61.  In the medium term, in order to ensure sustainability of financing for the voucher scheme \nand give beneficiaries greater exposure to enterprises, a corporate tax transfer program may be \nexplored. Based on NTB\u2019s planned guidelines, enterprises paying tax will be eligible for three \ncategories of grants linked to (i) an in-industry graduate training program at approximately \ntechnician level; (ii) an employee-upgrading program focusing on enterprises upgrading staff to \nwork with higher level technology; and (iii) a training partnerships program between education \ninstitutions and enterprises. Eligible enterprises will apply directly to NTB.  \n \nii.  The NTF Equipment and Facilities Adjustment Fund \n62.  A fund15 will be established within the NTF by NTB to respond to requests for tool banks \nor minor renovations to local community lifelong learning centers and institutions. Applications \nfrom these community lifelong learning centers and institutions, endorsed by the PTC, will be \nsubmitted to the Directorate General of TVET, evaluated in terms of NTB priorities, and, if \nsuccessful, recommended to NTB for approval. Individual grants will be up to $15,000.  NTB is \nexpected to continue its supervisory responsibility over NTF.  \n \n                                                 \n15  A separate account within the NTF under the NTB amounting to $0.5 million in the initial phase of the Project. ", "16 \niii.  TVET System Capacity Building \n63.  The program will consist of (i) strengthening the operations of the NTB, guided by a \nthree-year  rolling  national  skills  development  plan,  formulated  in  conjunction  with  private \nenterprises  and  other  stakeholders;  (ii)  rationalizing  and  sustaining  the  NTF,  including  re-\ndirecting  existing  TVET  PAP  funding,  mobilizing  other  resources,  and  gradually  increasing \nprovincial  and  community  contributions;  (iii)  strengthening  links  with  existing  micro-credit \nschemes accessible to skills training graduates; (iv) establishing a national association of TVET \nproviders  as  part  of  strengthened  skills  standards  and  quality  assurance  mechanisms; \n(v) strengthening the capacity of the Directorate General of TVET for policy and planning and \nenabling joint public\u2013private partnership in skills training delivery and impact monitoring; and \n(vi) moving towards the establishment of a National Institute of Technology. The ADB Basic \nSkills Project has enabled the creation of a network of PTCs and further expansion to cover all \nprovinces is anticipated in late 2004 or early 2005. The objective of this component is to \nstrengthen the role of the PTCs in coordinating skills training, with gradual incorporation of these \nactivities into broader organizational reforms of further education or community lifelong learning \ncenters.  \n \n64.  It  is  proposed  that  the  first  phase  of  support  under  ESDP  II  should  focus  on  the \nimplementation  of  this  demand-driven  skills  training  program  in  seven  provinces,  including \n(i) seed money for the establishment of the training voucher scheme amounting to around \n$4.2 million over the period 2005\u20132009; (ii) coverage of the initial equipment and facilities \nupgrade fund in the PTCs, amounting to $0.5 million over 2005\u20132009; and (iii) coverage by the \ninitial decentralized PTC capacity building program, amounting to $1.0 million over 2005\u20132008.  \n \n65.  The selection of the communes to be supported during this first phase will be based on \nagreed poverty-targeting criteria. The program will be used to (i) introduce the voucher scheme; \n(ii) upgrade facilities and equipment in the PTCs, including tool banks; and (iii) build capacity of \nthe  provincial  training  board,  PTC  staff  and  training  personnel,  especially  the  community \ndevelopment  specialists.  These  financing  modes,  especially  the  NTF  and  training  voucher \nscheme, are designed to facilitate complementary financing from other development agencies \nwithin  an  agreed  strategic  management  and  implementation  framework,  including  related \ncapacity building.  \n \n3.  Financing Plan \n66.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $25 million equivalent from its Special Funds \nresources to cover 74% of the total project cost, including $13.9 million equivalent of the foreign \nexchange cost and $11.1 million equivalent of the local currency cost. ADB financing of the local \ncurrency cost is justified on the basis of the low level of national income (about $290 per capita, \nestimated  in  2002),  and  savings  (14.2%  of  the  national  income  in  2000),  as  well  as  the \nGovernment\u2019s fiscal deficit (6.1% of gross domestic product, estimated in 2002). The balance of \n$8.58 million will be financed by the Government. The ADB loan will have a maturity of 32 years \nwith a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% thereafter. The financing plan is summarized in Table 2. Part of the ADB-supported \nproject loan and Government funding will be made available to participating communities and \ninstitutions as block grants to contribute to the funding of approved subprojects. \n \n67.  The cost of the investment Project, including physical and price contingencies, duties, \ntaxes and interest during construction, is estimated at $33.6 million equivalent. The foreign \nexchange cost is $13.9 million equivalent, or 41% of the total. The local currency cost, including ", "17 \nduties  and  taxes,  is  $19.7  million  equivalent,  or  59%  of  the  total.  Cost  estimates  are \nsummarized in Table 1. Project cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 11.  \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates Summary \n($ million) \n \n                Foreign  Local  Total \nComponent  Cost  Costa    Cost \nA.

Implementation Arrangements  \na.  Executing Agency: Lower and Upper Secondary Components \n68.  MOEYS will be the Executing Agency for the lower and upper secondary components of \nthe Project and will be responsible for coordinating the overall implementation. Implementation \nperformance of MOEYS has been rated satisfactory and the implementation of previous projects \nfunded by ADB has been assessed as successful. For the centralized system, the Department \nof Materials and State Property (DMSP) will be responsible for operational management and \nimplementation,  including  building  standards,  procurement  of  contractors  and  community \nservices for construction, site supervision and disbursement, and accounting of loan funds. For \nthe delegated system, DMSP will delegate the construction and supervision functions to the \nprovincial education facilities committees.  \n \n69.  Consulting services will be provided to build capacity in Departments of Primary and \nSecondary  Education  to  plan  and  manage  implementation  of  these  components  of  the ", "18 \ninvestment  project,  including  provincial-level  strengthening  of  personnel  management  and \ndeployment systems. Where appropriate, DMSP will assist these departments to fulfill their \nresponsibilities and assist with any further decentralized mechanisms to develop education \nfacilities.  The  consulting  services  for  upper  secondary  schools  facilities  planning  and \nmanagement  will  be  located  in  departments  of  secondary  education.  Building  on  ESDP \narrangements, MOEYS will delegate existing DMSP technical staff to provide any necessary \nfield  site  supervision  and  construction  monitoring  as  required,  drawing  on  the  vehicles, \ncomputers, other equipment and furniture provided under previous projects, i.e., the Emergency \nFlood Rehabilitation Project (Loan 1824) and ESDP. \n \n    b.  Executing Agency: Community-Based Skills Training Component \n \n70.  The new MOLVT will be the Executing Agency for the community-based skills training \ncomponent and will be responsible for its overall implementation. A project management unit \n(PMU) headed by a senior official of MOLVT will be located at the Directorate General of TVET \nand will be responsible for the day-to-day operation of the Project. The head of the PMU will be \nresponsible for organizing the team, together with consultants and staff drawn from the various \nunits of MOLVT. The PMU head will be appointed by the minister, MOLVT, and implementation \nof  this subcomponent  will  be  the direct  responsibility  of  the  Directorate  General  of  TVET. \nImplementation  will  be  consistent  with  the  decentralization  policy  of  the  Government  as \nespoused in its Rectangular Strategy.  \n \n71.  The  provincial  training  board  of  the  provincial  training  center/community  center \n(PTC/CC) of the selected provinces will provide project oversight at the provincial, district and \ncommune levels. The director of the PTC/CC will be the key point person at the provincial level \nand  will  be  assisted  by  the  staff  of  the  PTC/CC,  specifically  the  community  development \nspecialists, who will be responsible for helping communes to identify training needs and draw up \ntraining plans. The PTC/CC director will report to the PTB who in turn will report to the PMU. \nDetailed implementation arrangements are in supplementary Appendix H. \n \n72.  Consulting services will build capacity in the Directorate General of TVET, the NTB, \nNTF, Provincial Training Boards of the PTCs, the PTCs, the National Association of Training \nProviders, the Association of Micro-credit Providers, and the Sectoral Councils. The consulting \nservices for TVET system development and management will be located in the Directorate \nGeneral of TVET.  \n \nc.  Steering Committee \n \n73.  The steering committee for the Program loan will also be the steering committee for the \nproject loan (para. 46). The Steering Committee will be chaired by the Secretary of State of \nMOEYS  and  will  comprise  representatives  from  MEF,  MOEYS,  MOLVT,  the  Ministry  of \nPlanning, the Council for Administrative Reform (within the Council of Ministers), the Ministry of \nJustice, the Ministry of the Interior, MOWA, the Ministry of Rural Development, the Ministry of \nUrban and Land Management; and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Youth Rehabilitation. A \nsubcommittee, chaired by MOLVT, will be established to oversee project implementation under \nthe third component of the Project. The subcommittee will report to the Steering Committee. The \nsubcommittee  will  include  representatives  from  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry  and \nFisheries; the Ministry of Tourism; the Ministry of Commerce; and the Ministry of Industries, \nMines and Energy. \n ", "19 \n74.  The  Steering  Committee  will  be  responsible  for  overall  policy  direction  and  project \noversight. Its responsibilities will include (i) approval of annual programs and budget allocations, \n(ii)  overseeing  progress  and  compliance  with  agreed  guidelines,  (iii)  commissioning  and \napproving accounts and reports required by the Project, and (iv) ensuring that agreed audit \nrequirements are satisfied. It will delegate responsibilities to appropriate MOEYS departments \nand the Directorate General of TVET of MOLVT. For the lower and upper secondary education \ncomponents, lead coordination for facilities planning and targeting will be the responsibility of \nthe  Directorate  General  of  Education,  including  the  departments  of  primary  education  and \nsecondary education. A sub-committee, chaired by MOLVT, shall be established to oversee the \nProject implementation under component 3 of the Project. The sub-committee shall report to the \nSteering  Committee.  The  sub-committee  shall  include  representatives  from  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture, Forestry and Fisheries; Ministry of Tourism; Ministry of Commerce; and the Ministry \nof Industries, Mines and Energy. \n \nd.  Procurement  \n \n75.  All ADB-financed goods and services procured for the Project will be in accordance with \nADB's Guidelines for Procurement. DMSP, under the supervision of the General Department of \nAdministration  and  Finance  will  be  responsible  for  all  procurement,  including  international \ncompetitive bidding (if any), local competitive bidding (e.g., for civil works), and international \nshopping or direct purchase of furniture and classroom equipment, laboratory equipment, deep-\nwell water pumps, motorcycles and utility vehicles). Indicative procurement packages are in \nAppendix 12.  \n \n76.  Each contract for the supply of goods, equipment, furniture, and instructional materials \nestimated to cost more than $500,000 equivalent will be awarded on the basis of international \ncompetitive bidding procedures. Contract packages of $100,000\u2013$500,000 equivalent will follow \ninternational shopping procedures. Items with a value of less than $100,000 equivalent may be \nprocured on a direct purchase basis. Civil works, as they are small in amount, numerous and \nscattered in rural areas across the country, will be awarded on the basis of local competitive \nbidding  following  Government  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Proper  maintenance  and \nservicing capacities and frameworks, especially for computers and vehicles at the project sites, \nwill be ensured.   \n \n    e.  Disbursement \n \n77.  To  expedite  project  implementation,  an  imprest  account  will  be  established  at  a \ncommercial bank acceptable to both the Government and ADB. Two second-generation imprest \naccounts in the names of MOEYS and MOLVT, respectively, will also be established at a \ncommercial bank acceptable to both ADB and the Government. For expenditure incurred at \nprovincial level, normal Government fund transfers to provinces will be adopted. The Provincial \nDepartment of Education, Youth and Sport will be requested to open a dedicated account, either \nthrough the provincial treasury or an MEF-approved rural commercial bank. In the provinces, \ndocuments of expenditure will be kept by school committees supervised by Department of \nEducation, Youth and Sport Office; signatories will be the chair of the committee, school director \nand accountant. \n \n78.  The imprest account and the second-generation imprest accounts will be established, \nmanaged, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(1 January 2001). The imprest account will have a ceiling of $1 million. The second-generation \nimprest  accounts  will  have  ceilings  of  $400,000  each.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure ", "20 \nprocedure will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures and to liquidate advances to the \nimprest account. These procedures will be applicable to contracts amounting to $100,000 or \nless.  Statements  of  expenditure  will  be  managed  in  accordance  with  the  Bank\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (January 2001). \n \nf.  Consulting Services \n79.  Planning and management will be supported by consulting services, whose two main \nobjectives will be (i) to facilitate the planning of the lower and upper secondary education \nfacilities program, including establishment of strategic links with teacher training, retraining and \nnew  staff  deployment  programs,  and  (ii)  to  support  the  organizational  development  of  the \ncommunity-based  skills  training  program,  especially  the  strengthening  the  planning  and \ncoordination role of the provincial NTB and PTCs. In both components, the scope will be to \nadvise on the implementation of nationwide programs, including the phasing and sequencing of \nexpansion. A total of 65 person-months of international and 150 person-months of domestic \nconsulting services will be required. International and domestic consultants will be recruited \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The consultants will be selected and \nengaged  as  a  firm  by  the  executing  agencies  using  the  quality-and-cost-based  selection \n(QCBS) method. A summary of consulting services and an outline of the terms of reference for \nconsultants are in Appendix 13. \n \ng.  Staff Development Program \n80.  Staff development under the Project will consolidate the gains achieved under ESDP \nand  extend  institutional  reform  and  capacity  building  for  decentralization,  especially  by \nstrengthening  central  and  provincial  financial  management  and  monitoring  and  sector-wide \nprogram planning, management and monitoring.  It will strengthen institutions and capabilities at \nthe grassroots level, especially the roles and functions of the district and community levels in \nensuring  timely  and  efficient  transfer  of  information  related  to  policy  and  program \nimplementation. Staff development activities will include (i) training of public accountants at \ncentral, provincial and district levels; (ii) training of internal auditors; (iii) training of school \ndirectors in school development planning and financial management; (iv) training of central and \nprovincial directors in strategic leadership; and (v) training in sectoral and program monitoring at \nvarious levels. A detailed staff development program is in Appendix I. \n \nh.  Implementation Schedule \n81.  The implementation period will be for five years and the Project is expected to be \ncompleted by 31 December 2009. The loan closing date is 30 June 2010. A quarterly project \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 14. \n \ni.  Reports, Accounts, and Audits  \n82.  The Government will ensure that all records and accounts to identify goods and services \nfinanced from the proceeds of the project loan will be maintained. Separate accounts for the \nProject will be maintained, and independent auditors acceptable to the ADB will audit accounts \nand financial statements annually in accordance with sound accounting principles. Certified \ncopies of such audited accounts will be submitted to ADB not later than 9 months after the close \nof each fiscal year.   \n ", "21 \n83.  MOEYS  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  the  implementation  of  the  Project  and \nseparately for the program loan, and submit them to ADB within 30 days of each quarter. The \nreports will be in a format acceptable to ADB and will indicate, among other things, (i) progress \nagainst targets, both technical and financial; (ii) status of performance indicators; (iii) problems \nencountered during the quarter, and steps taken and proposed to be taken to resolve problems \nidentified; (iv) compliance with loan covenants; and (v) program activities proposed for the \nsucceeding quarter. A project completion report will be submitted to ADB not later than three \nmonths after the physical completion of the Project. \n \nj.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n84.  ESDP II will provide substantial support to developing management, monitoring and \nevaluation capacities in the Departments of Secondary Education, under the direction of the \nDirectorate General of Education, and the Directorate General of TVET. For the lower and \nupper secondary education development component, progress monitoring will draw on existing \ncentral, provincial, and district education authorities.  The benefits of the Project will be captured \nthrough the improved education management information and monitoring systems. In addition, \nthe  Project  will  provide  for  complementary  benefit  monitoring  studies,  including  surveys. \nFacilities development implementation monitoring will draw on existing services and capacity \nwithin DMSP.   \n \n85.  For the TVET and skills training component, overall monitoring will be coordinated by the \nDirectorate General of TVET.  Progress monitoring will be the responsibility of the provincial \ntraining  boards  and  complemented  by  annual  surveys  of  beneficiaries,  stakeholders  and \ncommune councils. \n \nk.  Anti-Corruption Measures \n86.  During project processing, ADB\u2019s anti-corruption policy was explained to government \nofficials, particularly the section on fraud and corruption, as stated in ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy,  Guidelines  for  Procurement,  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Capacity \nbuilding to strengthen education governance and regulations will support anticorruption efforts. \n \nl.  Regular and Midterm Reviews \n87.  Annually, the Government, ADB, other development agencies, and NGOs will review the \nimplementation and assess the impact of all reforms in the education sector as part of joint \neducation sector performance reviews. In addition to annual and other reviews, during the third \nyear of project implementation, the Government and ADB will jointly undertake a midterm review \nof the Project. The review will identify changes since the time of appraisal, reassess the impact \nwith  regard  to  future  project  implementation  and  sustainability,  assess  implementation \nperformance against project performance indicators, review and establish compliance with loan \ncovenants, identify problems and constraints, and propose changes to the Project, if necessary. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n88.  ESDP II will provide the policy and strategic framework for addressing capacity building \nconcerns  in  a  number  of  areas,  including  (i)  decentralization  of  the  education  services \nmanagement;  (ii)  upper  secondary  education  policy  analysis  and  strategic  planning; \n(iii) strategic  management  of  the  expanded  community-based  skills  training  program;  and \n(iv) strengthening policy-led education governance and regulatory reform. The overall MOEYS ", "22 \ncapacity building strategy with ADB support will be coordinated with that of other development \nagencies, especially the European Commission, UNICEF, Sida, JICA and World Bank.   \n \n89.  It is planned that ESDP II will be accompanied by an advisory TA16 in an amount of \n$500,000,  designed  to  strengthen  MOEYS\u2019s  capacity  to  plan  and  implement  education \nregulatory reform and governance for decentralization. The proposed objectives and scope of \nthe advisory TA are to (i) support a new education law and preparation of key regulations \nrelated to improved institutional and financial governance with a target of legislation approval by \nend 2004, and other selective regulations from early 2005 onwards; (ii) improve transparency in \nuse  of  parental  and  private  contributions  to  schools  and  other  institutions,  through  new \nguidelines on accounting and management of these contributions, with a target of implementing \nthe guidelines from early 2005; and (iii) improve governance of schools and postsecondary \ninstitutions,  by  issuing  guidelines  that  set  out  powers  and  responsibilities  of  education \nauthorities, parents and community associations with a target of issuing the guidelines by early \n2005. In addition, new financial regulations will be needed to underpin the anticipated education \nstaff pay reform strategy.   \n \n90.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $590,000 equivalent, comprising $426,000 in \nforeign exchange and $164,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $500,000 equivalent covering all of the foreign exchange cost and $74,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will finance the balance of the local \ncurrency cost, equivalent to $90,000, by providing office accommodation, utilities, administrative \nsupport, and the remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff and task forces. A brief on the \nadvisory TA and details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 15. \n \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS AND RISKS \n91.  The policy reforms supported by the ESDP II program loan will generate medium-term \nbenefits by improving equity and efficiency by redistributing education resources provided by the \nGovernment and development agencies, including financial, human and physical infrastructure, \nto the poorest 40% of communes in Cambodia.  Preliminary analysis indicates that over the five \nyears  of  the  ESP  implementation  (2004\u20132008),  which  ESDP  II  will  enable,  the  share  of \nprojected spending in the poorest 40% of communes will rise from 28% to 36%, compared with \na decrease in the share spent on the richest 40% of communes from 50% to 42%. Similarly, the \nprojected spending on girls will increase from 42% of projected total capital and recurrent \nspending in 2004 to 46% of spending by 2008, through systemic and targeted support in areas \nof low female enrolment and participation. An economic and financial analysis of ESDP II is in \nAppendix J.   \n \n92.  The medium-term benefits of the ESP 2004\u20132008 reforms, which ESDP II and other \ndonor  assistance  will  enable,  will  be:  (i)  increased  participation  in  basic  education  for  an \nestimated 0.8 million students in the poorest 40% of communes; (ii) increased participation in \nupper secondary education for around 0.2 million students; (iii) enabling an additional 0.6 million \nchildren to progress annually to the next grade of school, with savings of around KR24 billion \n($6 million) to the Government and KR6 billion ($1.5 million) to parents; and (iv) expanded skills \ntraining opportunities for over 270,000 youths and adults in the poorest 40% of communes over \n5 years during the initial phase of this project component. The longer-term benefits will be to \nprovide more accessible and relevant formal education to about 4.2 million school-age children \n                                                 \n16  ADTA for Capacity Building in Education Regulatory Reform and Governance, in the amount of $500,000, is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country program for Cambodia in 2004. ", "23 \nand to put in place cost-effective and accessible skills training programs for an estimated \n3.3 million underemployed youth aged 12\u201321 years.  \n \n93.  Other medium- and long-term benefits accruing from increased participation of girls in \nschooling  will  be:  (i)  reduced  risk  of  vulnerability  to  HIV/AIDS,  child  labor  and  trafficking, \nespecially in cross-border areas; (ii) improved family health, nutrition and child attendance; and \n(iii) greater opportunities for accessing micro-credits for small business development, using \nskills training credentials as collaterals.  \n \n94.  Limited leadership and ownership of the policy reform process and lack of consistency in \npolicy and strategic decision pose potential risks, which could undermine the effectiveness of \nthe  reform  process.  These  risks  will  be  mitigated  in  a  number  of  ways,  including:  (i)  the \nextensive ESP 2004\u20132008 policy dialogue process; (ii) the follow-up review and assessment \nprocess with development agencies and NGOs to secure broad support and mutual confidence \nin the feasibility of the reform agenda; (iii) the annual ESSP review process, which facilitates a \nphased and sequenced approach to policy implementation; and (iv) provision of ADB and other \ndevelopment agency advisory support for ongoing policy studies and related legislative and \nregulatory reforms.   \n \n95.  An uncertain fiscal climate and unforeseen developments (e.g., the outbreaks of SARS17 \nin 2003 and avian influenza in 2004) pose further potential risks, which may undermine the \npredictability of Government resources for education, especially the significant transitional costs \nassociated with policy reforms. These risks will be mitigated in a number of ways, including \n(i) extensive dialogue on the medium-term resource availability for education; (ii) using the \nmedium-term  expenditure  framework  process  as  a  basis  for  identifying  potential  budget \nshortfalls and for mobilizing increased sector budget support, including the proposed ESDP II \nprogram  loan  and  ongoing  European  Commission  support;  (iii)  extensive  sector  efficiency \nmeasures to contain expenditure growth; and (iv) strong policy linkage with the Government\u2019s \nbroader public financial management reforms, especially anticipated measures to ensure annual \nbudget realism. \n \n96.  The limited capacity of MOEYS and MOLVT to manage and implement the revised \npolicies and strategies is another potential risk, especially for the proposed TVET and skills \ntraining expansion. Implementation of the Project by technical personnel based on a policy of \ndecentralization down to the provincial and district levels is essential for capacity building. The \nfunctions  and  organizational  structures  of  NTB  and  NTF,  key  organizations  in  the \nimplementation  of  community-based  skills  training  component,  need  to  be  maintained.  An \nassociated risk for both the upper secondary facilities component and TVET and skills training is \npossibility that they may not be sustainable. These potential risks will be mitigated through \n(i) provision  of  extensive  advisory  support  for  subsectoral  and  program  planning  and \nmanagement; (ii) extensive dialogue on upper secondary and TVET and skills training financing; \nand (iii) front loaded technical assistance to ensure that an appropriate legislative and regulatory \nframework is in place.  \n \n                                                 \n17 Severe acute respiratory syndrome.

Only subprojects categorized \nas C in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement and meeting \nthe eligibility criteria for the selection of school sites, as agreed between the \nGovernment and ADB, will be selected.  \n \n(iv)  The Government, through MOEYS, will ensure priority will be given to gender \nand ethnic minority development through the implementation of the gender and \nethnic minorities action plan, prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s policies on \ngender and development and indigenous peoples. The Government, through \nMOEYS, will further ensure that (a) priority will be given to girls and women in \norder  to  achieve  their  maximum  participation  in  lower  and  upper  secondary \nschools  and  in  the  training  provided  under  the  TVET  and  skills  training \ncomponent; and (b) in order to increase the quality of and access to education by \nethnic minorities, they will have equal opportunities to participate in lower and \nupper secondary education and the training provided under the TVET and skills \ntraining component. The project\u2018s impact on ethnic minorities will be observed \nduring project monitoring and evaluation. \n ", "25 \n(v)  Although  no  significant  environmental  impacts  have  been  identified,  the  site \nselection,  design,  construction,  replacement  work  and  operation  of  school \nfacilities  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  government \nregulations  and  standards  as  well  as  the  ADB\u2019s  environmental  policy  and \nenvironmental assessment guidelines. \n \nB.

Sector Performance Overview: 2000\u20132004 \n \n1.  The  Ministry  of  Education,  Youth  and  Sport  (MOEYS)  has  been  implementing  an \nextensive education reform program since 2000, encapsulated in the Education Strategic Plan \n(ESP) and Education Sector Performance Program (ESSP) 2001\u201305. The overall priority has \nbeen to (i) expand equitable access to 9 years of high-quality basic education, (ii) improve the \nquality and efficiency of education services, and (iii) expand and regulate the quality of a public\u2013\nprivate partnership in postbasic education. The overarching financing strategy is to implement \npro-poor  systemic  and  targeted  interventions,  especially  through  recurrent  priority  action \nprograms and expanded school and institutional facilities development in underserved areas.  \n \n2.  The National Education for All Plan was approved in mid-2003. It sets out longer-term \ngoals  and  targets,  focusing  on  achieving  universal  primary  education  and  basic  education \nprovision by 2010, or at the latest by 2015, in line with the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). In 2001, the Government reduced cost barriers to basic education by abolishing start-\nof-the-year  parental  contributions  and  introduced  operational  budgets  for  all  schools  and \ninstitutions. The past four years have seen significant increases in quality-oriented operational \nsupport, especially for basic supplies, textbooks and teacher training.  \n \n3.  Government  spending  on  education  has  risen  significantly,  from  about  14%  of  the \nnational budget in 2000, to 19.5% in 2004. Expenditure on basic education has been 70\u201375% of \noverall recurrent spending. Donor support for the sector has risen to an estimated $50 million \nper annum, including recurrent budget support, initially from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand  the  European  Commission,  expanded  investments  in  facilities  and  capacity-building \nprograms. Financial management has been extensively decentralized to a network of about 200 \nbudget management centers, alongside substantial capacity building in sector performance and \nfinancial monitoring.    \n \n4.  Education partnership arrangements have been strengthened through the introduction of \nan  annual  ESSP  review  exercise,  jointly  coordinated  by  the  MOEYS,  donors  and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs). MOEYS produces an annual ESSP performance report, \nwhich is used as the basis for strategic review and negotiation, alongside separate donor and \nNGO reports that analyze performance and future priorities.   \n \nB.  Recent Primary, Secondary and Post-Secondary Access Trends \n \n5.  There has been encouraging growth in access at all levels of the system. Since 2000, \nprimary  school  enrollment  has  increased  from  about  2.2  million  in  2000  to  an  estimated \n2.7 million in 2004. Net enrollment rates (NER) are currently about 90%, with most of the \nimprovements being in poor rural areas. Female enrollment is estimated to be 89%, indicating \ngrowing gender parity at the primary level. At lower secondary grades 7 to 9, enrollment has \ngrown from about 250,000 to 460,000 in the past four years, with net enrollment about 21% \n(20% female). There is still low basic education enrollment in many border areas and in areas \nwith significant ethnic minority populations. The grade 6\u20137 transition rate between 2001/02 and \n2002/03 was over 83.4%, compared with 82.6% and 77.3% in the two previous academic years. \nSuperficially, these transition rates appear to be quite encouraging. However, in reality they are \na consequence of previously high repetition and dropout rates in primary grades, resulting in a \nsmall  grade  6  cohort.  Similarly,  the  difference  between  lower  secondary  gross  and  net \n ", "  Appendix 1  27 \nenrollment rates (GER 38% and NER 20%) indicates that over 75% of the new intake into grade \n7 is older than 12 years of age. \n \n6.  Enrollment growth in upper secondary grades 10 to 12 has been disappointingly slow. In \nthe past five years, enrollment has grown from about 110,000 to 154,000. Net enrollment is \nestimated at 8%, which is among the lowest in the region. Girls and ethnic minority students are \nsignificantly underrepresented, with females representing about 33% of the total. The primary \nconstraints are continuing requirements for informal contributions from parents, especially at \nsecondary level, and lack of lower secondary and upper secondary facilities in many rural and \nethnic minority districts and communes.  \n \n7.  The main constraints in accelerating implementation of education for all are (i) late entry \ninto primary school by female students and students from poor families; (ii) significant rates of \nrepetition  and  early  dropout  in  primary  school  (about  15%  annually);  (iii)  the  existence  of \nincomplete primary schools which do not offer the full range of grades 1 to 6; (iv) the uneven \nprovision  of  secondary-level  facilities  across  the  country;  and  (v)  uneven  distribution  of \nexperienced teachers, with fewer being posted to rural and remote areas. The overarching \nconstraints are informal cost barriers for students and the direct cost of travelling to school, \nespecially if it is some distance from home. A further contributory factor is the wide disparity in \naccess to early childhood care and development, with only 7% coverage nationwide, mainly in \nurban areas.  \n \n8.  There has been enormous growth in higher education in the past five years, with much \nof the growth in the private sector. Current enrollment is about 45,000 with an estimated 25,000 \nstudents in public institutions.  The majority of students pay fees, with only about 8,000 students \nreceiving some form of government subsidy. However, there are continued inequities in access \nto higher education. Most of the higher education institutions, both public and private, are in \nPhnom Penh. Most of the students come from either Phnom Penh or other more urbanized \nprovinces.  Females  continue  to  be  significantly  underrepresented  because  of  their  low \nenrollment and consequent low rates of graduation from grade 12 and the absence of higher \neducation dormitories. \n \n9.  The main strategic priorities for expanding equitable access to higher education are \n(i) progressive  provision  of  initial  higher  education  opportunities  in  regional  and  provincial \ninstitutions;  (ii)  ensuring  a  supply  of  high-quality  undergraduates  from  all  provinces; \n(iii) expansion of merit-driven scholarships for students from poor families; and (iv) expansion of \nlower  level  entry  programs  into  higher  education,  possibly  through  associate  degrees, \nfoundation studies or equivalency programs. An overarching consideration is enabling more \nhigher education opportunities within a framework of effective quality assurance and information \non value for money.  \n \n10.  The technical and vocational education and training (TVET) and skills training sector is \ncharacterized by a diversity of public, private and NGO providers. Public TVET institutions have \nan enrollment of about 7,000 students per annum and commercial and NGO providers 4,000 \nstudents. In contrast, large and small enterprises, including family businesses, provide on-the-\njob skills training for about 135,000 students per annum. The strategic priority is to improve \nequitable access to skills training programs for the 12\u201321 age group, about 3.3 million potential \nstudents in 2002. Currently, only an estimated 0.6 million (18%) are in some form of education \nor training. The poorest rural communes are especially underserved, representing a constraint \non  rural  income  generation,  rural  economic  diversification  and  overall  rural  workforce \nproductivity, especially in the agriculture sector.  \n ", "28  Appendix 1 \n11.  Matching  teacher  education  supply  and  demand  with  proposed  education  sector \nexpansion is a critical issue. Current supply and demand is set by intake ceilings in provincial \nand regional teacher training colleges determined by the Council of Ministers. The 2002/03 \nenrollment was 9,200, about 4% more than in 2001/02. Forward planning must take account of \nthe  projected  fall  in  overall  primary  enrollment  after  2006  and  expansion  of  secondary \nenrollment, requiring a reorientation of provincial and regional teacher training college capacity \ntowards increased share of secondary school teacher trainees. The Ministry has introduced \nspecific guidelines for the recruitment of teacher trainees from remote areas (1,534 in 2002/03, \n25% of the total) in order to improve education services in remote schools. The strategic priority \nwill be to review the roles and intake levels of the National Institute of Education, regional \nteacher training colleges and provincial teacher training colleges, taking account of projected \nteacher requirements in primary, lower secondary and upper secondary schools. \n \nC.  Education Service Efficiency Trends and Priorities \n \n12.  Since 2001, MOEYS has taken steps to reduce repetition rates in primary schools \nthrough remedial programs during vacations. This has resulted in an improvement in student \nprogression rates across the primary grades. Nevertheless, repetition rates remained high, \nresulting in significant costs for the Government and poor families.  For grade 1, the promotion \nrate was only 67% compared with a target of 84%. Repetition rates, on the other hand, are \nabove anticipated levels, particularly in grades 1 and 2. However, over the full grade 1\u20136 range, \nthe trend remains encouraging, with improved progression rates in grades 3\u20136. For example, \nthe grade 3 progression rate has risen from 74% to 83% over the past 3 years. The continued \nsignificant level of repetition contributes to substantial dropout rates, especially for children from \nthe  poorest  families.  This  is  exacerbated  by  the  existence  of  incomplete  primary  schools, \nfrequently located in the poorest communes. Two strategic priorities are (i) to introduce cost-\neffective remedial programs alongside monitoring of primary grade standards, and (ii) to phase \nout incomplete primary schools by making better use of staff and facilities and selectively \nexpanding the number of classrooms.  \n \n13.  More  efficient  use  of  staff  and  facilities  in  2001/02  was  sustained  in  2002/03.  For \nexample, average pupil teacher ratios (PTR) have remained constant at 57. Class sizes have \nbeen  contained  at  45\u201346  pupils  per  class  by  maintaining  double  shifts  and  double-shift \nallowances for teachers. Double-shift primary schools have increased from 76% to 78.5% of the \ntotal in the past year, partly to accommodate the enrollment bulge from 2001/02 as it progresses \nthrough the system. The overall pupil class ratios (PCRs) for individual grades continue to \nconverge at an increasing rate. Nevertheless, the proposed expansion of secondary education \nopportunities will necessitate rigorous guidelines on facilities utilization, possibly incorporating \nphasing in of basic education (grades 1\u20139) schools and teachers. This strategy would allow \nflexibility in the transition between the leveling out of primary enrollment and lower secondary \nexpansion.  \n \n14.  Overall enrollment growth has provided opportunities for other medium-term efficiency \ngains. The percentage of double-shift institutions is significant and rising (colleges, 35%, lycees, \n65% in 2002/03). In lower secondary schools, the PTR has risen from 19 in 2000/01 to 23 in \n2002/03,  while  the  overall  PCR  has  risen  from  41  to  47  over  the  same  period.  MOEYS \nrecognizes the need to achieve a balance between quality and efficiency improvement. In order \nto provide quality assurance, MOEYS intends to contain the PCR over the next few years by \nconstructing  additional  facilities,  while  ensuring  a  sufficient  and  equitable  deployment  of \nexperienced and qualified teachers. \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  29 \n15.  Enrollment growth in higher education and TVET has resulted in marked efficiency \ngains. For example, in higher education the PTR reached 20 in public institutions and 14 in \nprivate institutions in 2002/03. In TVET, the PTR has increased to 13 in technical institutes and \nto  30  in  provincial  training  centers.  For  teacher  training  colleges,  the  PTR  is  about  16. \nNevertheless, further efficiency gains at these levels to accommodate increased demand are a \npriority, alongside rationalization of teaching and nonteaching staff levels.  \n \nD.  Quality Improvement Trends and Priorities \n \n16.  Monitoring quality improvement and education standards is problematic in the absence \nof primary school and student performance standards. Surveys conducted as part of the ADB \nBasic Education Textbook Project and the World Bank Education Quality Improvement Project \nsuggest  that  some  factors  (e.g.,  textbook  availability  and  use)  have  been  associated  with \nimprovements in student standards in mathematics and science over the past three years. A \nnumber  of  proxy  indicators  demonstrate  MOEY\u2019s  commitment  to  quality  improvement.  For \nexample, in 2002 MOEYS committed KR15 billion for instructional materials; a 7% increase on \nthe previous year. Additional textbooks distributed in schools maintain the one book per student \ntarget (1:1 ratio) in primary and lower secondary schools. Financial allocations for sustaining \ntextbook orientation programs for teachers continued in 2004.  \n \n17.  The quality and efficiency of the teaching service continues to improve. The number of \ntrained primary school teachers has increased from about 42,000 in 1999/00 to 47,000 in \n2002/03. The number of trained secondary school teachers has increased from 17,800 to \n22,700 over the same period, with an increased share of the teaching force having upper \nsecondary education or graduate qualifications. In order to sustain these improvements, the \nministry is increasing the allocation for teacher redeployment and the incentives program by 15\u2013\n20% in 2003 compared with the previous year. Teacher development program allocations will \nincrease by 10% in 2003, with more emphasis on in-service teacher development and school \nmanagement  training.  For  example,  2,000  school  directors  were  scheduled  to  receive \nmanagement training in 2003, compared with 800 in 2002.  \n \n18.  MOEYS is taking steps to address the inequitable distribution of better-educated staff, \nespecially in remote areas. A large proportion of the teaching staff in remote schools have \ncompleted only primary school. MOEYS will continue to expand teacher deployment incentives \nfor remote and disadvantaged areas (16,500 allowances were planned for 2003). In addition, for \n2002/03, over 1,500 teacher trainees (25% of total) were recruited from remote areas, with the \nunderstanding that they would be posted to these areas after training. \n \n19.  During  2002,  MOEYS  allocated  a  total  of  KR31.5  billion  to  primary  and  secondary \nschools for the procurement of basic supplies, teaching materials and improvements to the \nschool environment. Current estimates are that over KR17.5 billion (55%) has been released to \nabout  6,500  schools,  amounting  to  roughly  KR2.7  million  (about  $673)  per  school.  About \nKR7 billion has been provided for quality improvement measures in postsecondary education \nand  nonformal  education.  It  is  anticipated  that  sustainable  operational  support,  alongside \nstrengthened institutional performance monitoring in 2003, will contribute to longer-term quality \nimprovement.  \n \n20.  There are significant provincial variations in pass rates of grade 12 examinations, with \nconsequent constraints on the long-term supply of graduates (including school teachers). For \nexample, Phnom Penh is overrepresented in the number of students passing grade 12. While \nonly 28% of grade 12 exam candidates are from Phnom Penh, they represent over 50% of \n ", "30  Appendix 1 \nthose who pass. The challenge to MOEYS is to raise the quality of secondary education in \nunderperforming provinces, e.g., Kampong Speu (12.7% pass rate) and Kep (2% pass rate). A \nstrategic priority is to ensure a sustained supply of well-qualified grade 12 students in each \nprovince to break this vicious circle of reliance on four or five provinces to supply graduate \nteachers for secondary education. \n \nE.  Overview of Reform Priorities, 2004\u201308 \n \n21.  The  joint  ESSP  review  2003  identified  a  number  of  key  reform  priorities  to  be \nimplemented  in  the  next  phase  of  the  reform  program  from  2004  to  2008.  These  include \n(i) progressing towards universal primary education by reducing dropout rates and overage \nprimary school entry; (ii) improving primary education quality through curriculum and teacher \ndevelopment reform, targeted spending, introduction of standards monitoring and, in the longer \nterm,  increases  in  instructional  hours;  (iii)  conducting  a  phased  expansion  of  secondary \neducation  opportunities,  initially  for  lower  secondary  schools;  and  (iv)  rationalizing  and \nexpanding public, private and community partnerships in early childhood care and development, \nnonformal education and literacy, higher education and selected areas of TVET and skills \ntraining. In addition, some institutional reforms are urgent, including education governance \ninitiatives,  performance-based  teacher  remuneration  strategies  and  further  strengthening  of \ndecentralization strategies. \n \n22.  A  second  set  of  priorities  is  the  urgent  expansion  of  skills  training  opportunities, \nespecially for unemployed youth in rural areas. For TVET, additional strategies will build on the \nlessons learned from the National Training Fund support of the growing provincial technical \ncenter  network.    For  higher  education,  strategies  will  take  account  of  the  strengths  and \nlimitations  of  the  growing  number  of  private  institutions,  including  quality  assurance  and \nregulatory issues.  Appropriate standards monitoring systems will be put in place. \n \n23.  For TVET, the ESSP review recognizes that a key objective will be to rationalize long-\nterm TVET policy and strategy, building on the initial TVET Strategic Plan prepared in 2001. The \nbroad purpose would be to help define options for the Government in financing and managing \nthe subsector. More specifically, alternative ways of ensuring strong regulation of the quality of \nboth public and private TVET providers and credit transfer between different levels of TVET will \nbe set out. For higher education, the ESSP review recognizes a key strategic objective will be to \nset current developments within a more comprehensive policy and governance framework. The \nbroad purpose would be to define clearly a policy framework for Government and private sector \nroles in higher education. More specific objectives of the study would include strategic options \nfor higher education financing, while assuring equitable access for the less well-off. Another \nobjective would be to examine the scope for progressive introduction of regional and provincial \nhigher  education  institutions,  linked  to  efficient  credit  transfer  and  quality  assurance \nmechanisms. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  31 \nPROGRAM FRAMEWORK \n \nProgram Targets  Monitoring \nDesign Summary  Assumptions and Risks \n(Verifiable Indicators)  Mechanisms \n       \n1.

Coordination of Information on External Assistance \n \n1.  In 2002, for the first time the Education Sector Working Group (ESWG) of donors was \nable to present a comprehensive and coordinated summary of ongoing and prospective donor \nassistance  to  education.  In  2003  the  range  and  capture  of  external  assistance  data  was \nextended.  The  information  presented  will  complement  the  MOEYS  analysis  of  trends  and \npatterns of external assistance in the context of the Education Sector Support Program (ESSP) \nand the medium-term expenditure framework. The donor report 2002/03 outlines trends in donor \nfinancing based upon detailed financial returns provided by donors covering actual financial \nassistance  to  the  sector  in  2002,  expected  assistance  in  the  current  year  and  projected \nassistance over the next four years to 2007. All donors working in the sector were asked to \nprovide financial information, indicating for each project, program or discrete item of assistance \nthe financial method used and the level of assistance over the given period. \n \nB.  Projected Trends and Patterns of External Assistance \n \n2.  Total  external  funding  to  the  sector  for  the  period  2002\u20132007  is  estimated  at \n$282.5 million,  with  $44.5  million  actually  spent  in  2002,  $44.7  million  in  2003,  and \n$193.3 million projected for 2004\u201307. Of the total projected financing for 2002\u20132007, 42% is \nexpected  to  come  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  World  Bank.  Other \namounts  are  committed  by  the  United  Nations  agencies,  in  particular  the  United  Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), UN World Food Program (UNWFP), the European Commission, \nUnited  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  and  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency (JICA). The remainder is contributed by a number of agencies. Summary \nfigures are provided in the table below. \n \n3.  Although annual figures for the medium term are not given, it is assumed that roughly \nequal amounts will be provided in each of the years 2004 to 2007. It is apparent that overall \nassistance to the sector is projected to increase very gradually over the period 2002\u20132007. \nTaking into account uncertainties over time, it is likely the overall level of funding will remain \nroughly constant, based on current assumptions for new medium-term initiatives. Despite a \nforecast significant increase in assistance from 2001 to 2002, actual disbursements reported in \n2002 were significantly lower (by $10.6 million, or a decrease of 19%) than the level anticipated \nin the donor report for the 2002 review. \n   ", "40  Appendix 3 \nTable A3.1: Total Education Sector Inputs by Donor \n($) \n \n2002   2004\u201307 \nTotal Expenditure \nDonor  Actual  2003 Amount  Projected \n2002\u201307 \nAmount  Amount \nADB  14,211,000  9,315,000 52,800,000 76,326,000\nAustralia  2,040,747  1,617,304 4,047,186 7,705,057\nBelgium  0  500,000 8,250,000 8,750,000\nUK DFID  0  479,019 4,311,174 4,790,193\nEC  1,336,465  5,177,500 19,822,500 26,336,465\nFrance  2,500,000  2,000,000 8,000,000 12,500,000\nFrench/AuF  570,000  911,287 2,721,660 4,202,397\nJapan  5,513,572  4,830,076 18,808,000 29,151,648\nSida  0  0 10,000,000 10,000,000\nUNESCO  484,000  1,479,000 3,298,000 5,261,000\nUNICEF  6,436,746  6,549,778 15,100,000 28,086,524\nUNWFP  3,883,480  3,844,500 12,840,000 20,567,980\nUSAID  108,000  500,000 6,000,000 6,608,000\nWB  7,474,444  7,451,327 27,273,243 42,199,014\nTotal  44,558,454  44,694,741 193,271,583 282,484,278\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank;  AuF  =  Agence  Universitaire  de  la  Francophonie;  DFID  =  Department  for \nInternational  Development  (United  Kingdom);  EC  =  European  Commission;  Sida  =  Swedish  International \nDevelopment Agency; UK = United Kingdom; UNESCO = United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \nOrganization; UNICEF = United Nations Children\u2019s Fund; UNWFP = United Nations World Food Program; USAID = \nUnited States Agency for International Development; WB = World Bank.   \nSource: Education Sector Support Program, Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport. \n \n4.

Responding to Future Priorities \n \n6.  MOEYS  and  the  international  community  recognize  that  the  coordination  and \nprogramming of external assistance will need to respond to changing sector priorities, especially \nthe  shift  towards  expansion  of  secondary  and  postsecondary  education  opportunities \nanticipated in the revised Education Strategic Plan. 2004\u20132008.   \n \n7.  The shift in sectoral priorities and the associated education medium-term expenditure \nplan 2004\u20132008 suggest the following changes in external assistance priorities.   \n \n(i)  A shift away from primary education project support, in response to the need to \nexpand  lower  secondary,  upper  secondary  and  postsecondary  opportunities \nthrough development of facilities and related operational costs. \n \n(ii)  Increased  share  of  recurrent  budget  support,  in  response  to  personnel \nremuneration  and  governance  reforms  and  the  need  to  increase  operational \nspending for lower secondary, upper secondary and post-secondary education, \nwhere project support may be less effective. \n \n(iii)  Expanded  use  of  demand-led  development  facilities,  possible  use  of  pooled \nfunding for secondary and postsecondary facilities programs where funding is \nprovided  on-demand  against  agreed  policy  and  eligibility  criteria  in  order  to \nstrengthen links between recurrent and capital spending. \n \n8.  In  addition,  support  for  capacity  building  is  projected  to  shift  towards  sector-wide \nplanning and management as opposed to project implementation and management, requiring a \nreview of the nature of technical assistance.   \n  \n   ", "Development Coordination Matrix, 2004\u20132008  4\n2\n \n \nWorld  UNICEF/\nDimensions  ADB  EC  JICA  USAID  France  UNESCO  DfID  Belgium  WFP  NGOs  A\nBank  Sida  p\np\nPrimary  (cid:57)          (cid:57)        (cid:57)  (cid:57)    en\nFacilities/Access  d\n  (cid:57)  (cid:57)      (cid:57)  (cid:57)      (cid:57)      (cid:57)  ix 4\nPrimary Quality   \nLower \nSecondary  (cid:57)  (cid:57)                (cid:57)     \nFacilities/Access \nLower \nSecondary  (cid:57)  (cid:57)      (cid:57)  (cid:57)      (cid:57)      (cid:57) \nQuality \nUpper \nSecondary  (cid:57)                       \nFacilities/Access \nUpper \nSecondary  (cid:57)      (cid:57)      (cid:57)           \nQuality \nTVET and Skills \n(cid:57)              (cid:57)      (cid:57)  (cid:57) \nTraining \nHigher \nEducation                         \nAccess \nHigher \nEducation    (cid:57)          (cid:57)           \nQuality \nTeacher \n(cid:57)      (cid:57)    (cid:57)        (cid:57)    (cid:57) \nTraining \nSector-wide \nCapacity      (cid:57)    (cid:57)  (cid:57)    (cid:57)      (cid:57)   \nBuilding \nSector Budget \n(cid:57)    (cid:57)                   \nSupport \nADB = Asian Development Bank; DFID = Department for International Development (United Kingdom); EC = European Commission; JICA = Japan International \nCooperation Agency; NGO = nongovernment organization; Sida = Swedish International Development Agency; TVET = technical and vocational education and \ntraining; UNESCO = United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization; UNICEF = United Nations Children\u2019s Fund; UNWFP = United Nations \nWorld Food Program; USAID = United States Agency for International Development.   \nSource:  Education Sector Support Program, Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport. \n ", "  Appendix 5  43 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.

It will also optimize social development through its positive \nimpact on family and child health, HIV/AIDS alleviation, child labor and trafficking and family nutrition. There is a \ncorrelation  between  poverty  profiles  and  family  well-being  measures  and  inequitable  access  to  primary  and \nsecondary education in rural areas and disadvantaged communes. The Cambodia National Poverty Reduction \nStrategy (NPRS) identifies more equal education opportunities as a key enabling factor in achieving poverty and \nsocial sector goals and targets of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. A better educated and trained labor \nforce is a key NPRS objective.

Strategic Context \n \n1.  The Education Strategic Plan (ESP), 2004\u20132008, identifies as a medium-term priority \nassuring equitable access to lower secondary education, including: (i) providing grade 7 to 9 \nfacilities in communes without any lower secondary school; (ii) focusing on a commune-based \n(rather than cluster-based) targeting approach; (iii) reducing cost barriers for the poor, especially \nillegal payments; and (iv) providing targeted scholarships for the poor, building on the Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) pilot project (JFPR 9028). It is estimated that about 800 \nadditional commune-based lower secondary schools will be needed over the next five years. \n \n2.  The ESP 2004\u201308 revision process also highlighted a number of key access and quality \nconstraints on science, mathematics and information and communications technology (ICT) \neducation  development,  including:  (i)  inequitable  provision  of  high-quality  upper  secondary \neducation, making it difficult to generate potential undergraduates in all provinces; (ii) a lack of \nupper secondary education provision in some rural districts; and (iii) inequitable access to high-\nquality science, mathematics, and ICT provision in upper secondary education, resulting in a \nlimited supply of potential undergraduates from many provinces.   \n \n3.  Another  priority  is  the  establishment  of  provincial  personnel  management  and  staff \ndeployment committees to ensure that schools provided under the loan will be effectively staffed \nand managed. These committees will provide an annual staff deployment action plan for staffing \nnew  and  expanding  secondary  schools,  using  a  combination  of  staff  redeployment  and \nretraining of existing staff and posting of new staff.  \n \n4.  The overall strategy is to ensure equitable access to lower secondary education and \nimproved progression rates to the upper secondary level in order to create a virtuous circle that \nwill  enable  high-quality  upper  secondary  schools  in  all  24  provinces  to  generate  potential \nscience, mathematics, and ICT undergraduate students.  \n \n5.  To  achieve  this,  the  strategy  aims  to:  (i)  improve  efficiency  in  these  programs  by \nreducing  the  need  for  remedial  subject  upgrading  at  higher  levels;  (ii)  reduce  reliance  on \ngraduate teachers from Phnom Penh, who currently fill many science, mathematics and ICT \nteaching posts in more rural and remote provinces; and (iii) create a network of technical \nsupport and outreach at various levels of the system. \n \nB.  Selection Criteria for Lower and Upper Secondary Schools Facilities Development \n \n6.  The following criteria will guide the central and provincial authorities in selecting the \ncommunes in all 24 provinces where new school facilities will be provided: \n \n(i)  the absence of any school in the commune. \n \n(ii)  communes with highest poverty incidence, including disadvantaged, remote and \npoorer  communes  in  rural  and  remote  areas  and  underserved  border  and \nreconciliation communes; \n \n(iii)  projected  high  grade  7\u20139  population  by  2008,  with  expressed  demand  for \nschools by communities; \n \n(iv)  availability of vacant and idle land owned by the Government that is free from all \nencumbrances, habitation, dispute or controversy.

As many of the target groups as possible, particularly the poor, will \nbe provided technical and vocational education and training (TVET) opportunities through a \nthorough and extensive network of training providers that reaches down to the commune and \nvillage levels. Instead of carrying out direct provision, the public TVET institutions, and the \nprovincial training centers specifically, will assume multiple roles. These will include establishing \na network of all types of training providers already in place in the provinces, districts and \ncommunes; assisting the communes to determine and develop a simple training plan based on \nan  annual  budget  (the  training  voucher);  matching  the  commune  training  needs  with  the \nappropriate training provider; assuring the quality of training; and, in general, managing the \nprocess. \n \n2.  To ensure that the primary beneficiaries will be the poor, the training vouchers will be \nallocated only to the poorest 40% of the communes ranked by population size and poverty \nincidence  (using  the  World  Food  Program  Poverty  Index).  Guidelines  on  the  selection  of \nparticipants, including an equitable share of women (which varies depending on the type of \nskills prioritized by the communes), and the maximum amount allowable per beneficiary will be \ndrawn up after adequate consultation. Enrolment targets/training output for 2005\u20132009 are as \nfollows:  \n \n(i)  community skills development: from 12,000 in 2005 (half year) to 120,000 per year \nstarting in 2008;  \n \n(ii)  certificate and diploma programs: from 7,600 in 2004 to 13,000 starting in 2007; and  \n \n(iii)  apprenticeships (all types):  from an estimated 80,000 in 2004 to 100,000 starting in \n2008.  \n \nB.  Selection Criteria for Demand-Driven Community-Based Skills Training \n \n3.  The following criteria will guide the central and provincial authorities in the selection of \ncommunes in the seven provinces where skills training for out-of-school youth will be provided.  \n \n(i)  Highest poverty incidence, commune must be ranked in the top 40% according to \nthe weighted average of poverty index (75% weight) developed by the World \nFood Program, and population size (25% weight).  \n \n(ii)  Expressed high demand for training by communities; an assessment of skills \ntraining needs and demand and the appropriateness of individual commune skills \ntraining development plans will be conducted. \n \n(iii)  Availability of training providers, including the private sector and nongovernment \norganizations. \n \n(iv)  Expressed demand from women within the community for basic skills training. \n \n ", "", "", "  Appendix 13  5599 \nSUMMARY OF CONSULTING SERVICES \n \nA.
