The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  acting \non behalf of the Government of Viet Nam, will issue a guarantee \nto the commercial banks guaranteeing EVN's payment obligations \nunder the commercial banks' loan. \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) will issue a guarantee to the \ncommercial  banks  guaranteeing \nthe  Government's  payment \nobligations  under  the  MOF  guarantee  corresponding  to  $325 \nmillion of principal (i.e. 95% of the $342 million loan amount), plus \ninterest payable by EVN under the commercial banks\u2019 loan. ADB\u2019s \nmaximum  aggregate  liability  under  the  ADB  guarantee  will  not \nexceed  $500  million.        Furthermore,  in  no  event  will  ADB \nguarantee  more  than  $325  million  of  amounts  corresponding  to \nprincipal payable by EVN under the commercial banks\u2019 loan.  The \nADB  guarantee  will  be  issued  on  the  conditions  that  the  MOF \nguarantee has been duly executed by both MOF, on behalf of the \nGovernment,  and  by  Viet  Nam  and  ADB\u2019s  standard  sovereign \nindemnity  provisions  (e.g.,  cross-default,  negative  pledge,  and \nindemnity  provisions)  are  incorporated  into  the  MOF  guarantee, \nthereby  obligating  Viet  Nam  to  reimburse  ADB  for  all  amounts \nADB pays the commercial banks pursuant to the ADB guarantee. \nThe proposed guarantee is to be anchored on two existing loans \nto EVN for the Northern Power Transmission Sector Project, and \nthe Northern Power Transmission Expansion Project. \n \nTargeting classification: General intervention \nSector (subsectors): Energy (electricity transmission and \ndistribution, trade finance) \n(subthemes):  Sustainable  Economic  Growth \nThemes \n(promoting  macroeconomic \nstability,  promoting  economic \nefficiency  and  enabling  business  environment)  and  Private \nSector Development (private sector investment)  \n \nCategory B  \n \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and  an  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  have  been  prepared. \nIn  addition,  initial  environmental  examinations  for  representative \nsub projects have been prepared. One due diligence report for a \ncompleted  subproject  have  been  completed.  The  other \nsubprojects will be assessed later, together with feasibility studies \nas for a sector loan. In addition, the transaction documentation will \nonly  allow  loan  proceeds  to  fund  category  B  and  category  C \nsubprojects. Category B sensitive and category A subprojects will \nnot be financed under the commercial banks\u2019 loan to EVN. \n \n\n\f2 \n\nProject Description \n\nRationale \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nExecuting Agency  \n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n \n\nexpansion \n\ndevelopment \n\nthe  500  kV \n\nplan.  Urgent \n\nThe  proposed  project  aims  to  provide  EVN  the  means  to  access \ncommercial bank loans on competitive terms to finance short-term \ninvestments  (2010\u20132012)  in  transmission  and  distribution.  The \nproject will include the construction of about 18 kilometers (km) of \n500  kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  lines  and  268  km  of  220  kV \ntransmission lines; 153 km of 110 kV transmission lines, and will \nadd  900  megavolt-amperes  (MVA)  of  additional  transformation \ncapacity  at \nlevel,  3,400  MVA  of  additional \ntransformation  capacity  at  the  220  kV  level,  and  1,483  MVA  of \nadditional  transformation  capacity  at  the  110  kV  level.  On  the \nmedium-  and  low-voltage  grids,  the  project  will  rehabilitate  rural \nand  urban  grids,  adding  more  than  200  km  of  medium-  and  low-\nvoltage lines and cables.  \n \nInfrastructure  development  is  a  key  component  of  Viet  Nam's \nmedium-term \nof \ninfrastructure is required to remove existing bottlenecks, increase \nservice  coverage,  and  attract  private  sector  investments  that  will \nhelp  achieve  and  sustain \nthe  projected  economic  growth, \nespecially  given  the  huge  economic  growth  seen  in  the  past \ndecade.  The  government  aims  to  concentrate  on  upgrading  the \ninfrastructure  and  urging  greater  private  sector \nexisting \nparticipation  in  new  infrastructure,  including  energy  development \nand power generation.  \n \nThe  impact  of  construction  of  new  transmission  lines  and \nupgrading  of  existing \nlines  and  associated \ntransmission \nsubstations  will  address  the  transmission  bottlenecks  and  thus \nenable evacuation of additional power generation to load centers. \nThe  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  reduced  system  losses  to \nbelow 10%, and ensuring reliable supply of electricity to meet the \ngrowing demand driven by the economic growth of the country.  \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  project  is  $544  million,  out  of  which  $342 \nmillion  will  be  financed  through  a  13-year  loan  made  by  a \nsyndication  of  foreign  commercial  banks;  the  remaining  amount \nwill be financed by EVN. \n \nViet Nam Electricity \n \nEVN  and  its  subsidiaries  will  issue  tenders  following  national \nstandards  in  procurement  (in  accordance  with  the  procurement \nplan provided in Supplementary Appendix G). In accordance with \nthe  Article  3.16  of  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time), ADB will conduct post-review of the \nprocurement  process  to  ensure  (i)  the  need  for  economy  and \nefficiency for procurement of the goods and works involved, (ii) all \neligible  bidders  from  developed  and  developing  countries  are \ngiven  the  same  information  and  equal  opportunity  to  compete  in \nproviding  goods  and  works,  and  (iii)  there  is  transparency  in  the \nprocurement process. \n \n\n\fBenefits and Impact \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\nThe credit enhancement provided by the ADB guarantee will lower \nEVN\u2019s  cost  of  borrowing  and  lengthen  its  loan  tenure.  It  also \nallows  commercial  banks  to  reengage  in  lending  in  emerging \nmarkets and in the infrastructure sector.  \n \nThe  main  beneficiaries  of  the  project  will  be  the  industrial, \ncommercial,  residential,  and  rural  consumers  in  Viet  Nam. \nConsumers will benefit from the increase and improved quality of \npower  supply,  which  will  result  in  improved  performance  and \nlonger  life  of  electrical  equipment.  By  reducing  the  technical \nlosses,  EVN  will  not  have  to  resort  to  load  shedding,  which  will \nbenefit \nindustrial \nlarge  economic  centers  where  numerous \ncompanies are established. The stable supply of electricity in Viet \nincrease \nfurther  stimulate  economic  growth,  and \nNam  will \nemployment and income-earning opportunities for the poor which \nwill support the development of the country, \n \nThis project involves no new technology and EVN and all of its 11 \nsubsidiaries have all the necessary skills to design and implement \nthe  transmission  projects.  EVN's  revenues  are  in  dong,  but  the \nloan from the commercial banks will be in foreign currencies. The \nprimary  risks  are  (i)  the  credit  risk  of  EVN,  (ii)  foreign  exchange \nfluctuations,  and  (iii)  the  ability  of  the  Government  to  honor  its \nobligations to the commercial banks under the MOF guarantee.  \n \nEVN\u2019s  failure  to  pay  under  the  commercial  banks\u2019  loan  could \ntrigger  a  call  on  the  MOF  guarantee,  which  could  result  in  a \ndemand  under  the  ADB  guarantee.  These  risks  will  be  mitigated \nby  (i)  the  sovereign  indemnity  provisions  in  the  MOF  guarantee, \nand (ii) the annual revision of the tariffs that will reflect the change \nin fuel costs and local inflation. \n \nIn addition, since March 2009, Viet Nam has introduced an annual \nthe  proposed  competitive  power \ntariff  adjustment  under \ngeneration market, which will also mitigate the risks of the project. \n \nAdvisory  technical  assistance  will  be  provided  to  EVN  and  its  11 \nsubsidiaries  to  supervise  the  implementation  of  the  project  with \nregards  to  compliance  with  ADB's  procurement  and  safeguards \nrequirements. The cost of the technical assistance is estimated at \n$720,000  of  which  $600,000  will  be  financed  through  the \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-others). The executing \nand  implementing  agencies  will  finance  $120,000  equivalent  in \nkind. The ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time) will apply. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed  Asian \n1. \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) guarantee (the Guarantee), which will cover certain payment obligations of \nthe Ministry of Finance of the Government of Viet Nam under a guarantee issued in connection with \ncommercial  loans  to  Electricity  of  Viet  Nam  (EVN)  under  the  EVN\u2019s  Investment  Support  Program. \nADB's obligations under the ADB guarantee will be counter indemnified by the Socialist Republic of \nViet  Nam.  The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Implementation \nSupervision  and  if,  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  ADB  guarantee,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will  approve  the  TA.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nMacroeconomic Performance \n\nViet Nam has enjoyed rapid economic growth in the two decades since 1988, when real gross \n2. \ndomestic product (GDP) grew at the average annual rate of 7.4%. Following a modest slowdown in \n1998\u20131999  caused  by  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  real  GDP  growth  accelerated  more  or  less  steadily \nduring 2000\u20132007, from 4.8% in 1999 to 8.5% in 2007.  \n \n3. \nHowever,  the  country  has  been  experiencing  severe  macroeconomic  difficulties  since  2008. \nInflation and the trade deficit surged in the first half 2008. The macroeconomic imbalances that had \nbuilt  up  for  several  years  contributed  to  the  growing  inflationary  pressures,  and  persistent  trade \ndeficits  were  exacerbated  by  domestic  supply-side  shocks  (such  as  poultry  epidemics).  The  rise  in \nworld  commodity  prices  also  contributed  to  the  surge  in  inflation.  The  government  responded  by \ntightening  monetary  and  fiscal  policies  and  taking  other  measures  to  stabilize  the  macroeconomic \nsituation.  \n \n4. \nThe global economic crisis adversely affected Viet Nam in 2008 by slowing growth of exports \nand contributing to the decrease in investment inflows. It has had more adverse impacts on Viet Nam \nin  2009.  In  particular,  the  crisis  has  further  reduced  exports,  and  has  also  reduced  revenue  from \ninternational tourism and inflows of foreign direct investment. Exports decreased by 9.8%, the number \nof international tourist arrivals fell by 22.1%, and foreign direct investment inflows declined by 18.4% \nin January\u2013June 2009 compared with the same period in 2008. \n \n \n5. \nThe government has taken a number of measures to mitigate the adverse impact of the global \neconomic  crisis  on  growth  and  poverty  in  Viet  Nam.  These  measures  include  one-off  additional \nfinancial  assistance  to  poor  households,  housing  support  for  the  poor,  and  provision  of  interest-free \nshort-term  loans  to  firms  that  have  had  to  shed  at  least  30%  of  their  staff  and  are  experiencing \ndifficulties in paying the wages of the remaining staff. Furthermore, the government has increased the \nbudgetary  allocation  for  the  existing  social  assistance  programs,  such  as  the  program  for  poverty \nreduction in ethnic minority and mountainous areas (so-called Program 135) and the health insurance \nprogram  for  the  poor  and  near  poor.  It  has  also  accelerated  the  formulation  and  approval  of  the \nprogram for accelerated poverty reduction in the 61 poorest districts. A total of $935 million has been \nallocated  to  the  social  safety  net  in  the  central  government  budget  for  2009,  compared  with  $518 \nmillion spent in 2008. \n \n6. \nViet Nam continues its impressive progress in reducing poverty. The Millennium Development \nGoal  of  halving  poverty  has  been  achieved  well  ahead  of  the  2015  target,  with  poverty  falling  from \n\n\f28.9%  in  2002  to  15.9%  in  2006. 1 Poverty  continues  to  persist  in  particular  regions  and  ethnic \nminorities, however, with the incidence of poverty in minority populations remaining at 52.3% in 2006, \nthough reduced significantly from 86.4% in 1993. In response, the government recently identified the \n61 poorest districts in 20 provinces for priority attention. \n \nReal  GDP  growth  is  forecast  to  rebound  to  6.5%  in  2010,  if  the  external  environment  starts \n7. \nimproving  during  that  year.  A  medium-term  economic  challenge  for  the  government  is  to  increase \ngrowth without fueling inflation and widening the current account deficit. To this end, the government \nneeds to raise the efficiency of the economy and ease supply-side constraints on growth by removing \ninfrastructure bottlenecks, improve the legal and regulatory framework for private sector development, \nstrength  public  administration,  increase  the  supply  of  skilled  labor,  and  speed  up  restructuring  and \nequitization  of  state-owned  enterprises  and  banks.  Accelerating  economic  reforms  would  help  Viet \nNam weather the global financial crisis and strengthen foundations for sustainable rapid growth over \nthe medium-to-long term. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnergy Sector Performance \n\n \n8. \nThe  strong  economic  growth  in  Viet  Nam  over  the  past  decade  has  resulted  in  substantial \ndemand  for  electricity  throughout  the  country.  The  link  between  economic  development  and  power \ndemand  is  very  strong.  Over  the  past  10  years,  GDP  growth  averaged  7.5%  per  annum,  while \nelectricity  demand  growth  averaged  about  16.0%  per  annum.  The  demand  for  electricity  has  been \ntriggered by ongoing electrification in new areas, expansion of transmission and distribution networks, \nand  the  demand  from  industries  in  the  new  industrial  zones  and  enterprises  throughout  the  country \nand from the growing service sector. Between 1995 and 2008, household access to the grid increased \nfrom 50% to nearly 94% and the per capita consumption increased during the same period from 156 \nkilowatt-hours (kWh) per household per month to about 800 kWh. In recent years, a supply shortage \nhas  become  more  evident,  although  it  eased  in  late  2008  and  early  2009  as  the  demand  growth \nreduced due to the global financial crisis.  \n \n9. \nViet  Nam  Electricity  (EVN),  the  national  power  utility  in  Viet  Nam,  is  organized  as  a  holding \ncompany,  with  a  series  of  wholly  owned  subsidiaries.  EVN  owns  the  strategic  power  plants,  holds \nmajority shareholding stakes in partially privatized power plants, and invests as the sole investor or in \npartnership with other public and private investors in new power generating plants. Key subsidiaries \ninclude three regional power companies that are responsible for power transmission and distribution \nfrom 110 kilovolts (kV) and less in northern Viet Nam (Power Company 1 [PC1]), southern Viet Nam \n(Power Company 2 [PC2]), and central Viet Nam (Power Company 3 [PC3]); and power distribution \ncompanies  responsible  for  power  distribution  in  large  cities  such  as  Ha  Noi,  Ho  Chi  Minh  City,  Hai \nPhong,  Da  Nang,  Hai  Dong,  Khanh  Hoa,  and  Dong  Nai.  The  power  companies  each  maintain  their \nown  financial  accounts  and  have  a  high  degree  of  managerial  and  financial  autonomy.  Other  key \nentities  under  EVN  include  the  Power  Transmission  Corporation  (NPT)  responsible  for  high-voltage \n(220 kV and 500 kV) power transmission; four power engineering consulting companies; the National \nLoad  Dispatch  Center;  and  subsidiaries  engaged  in  non-core  activities  such  as  equipment \nmanufacturing, telecommunications, real estate, and financial services. \n \n10. \nEVN  owns  about  63.5%  of  all  generation  capacity  in  Viet  Nam.  The  remainder  is  shared \namong  independent  power  producers  (IPPs)  owned  by  state-owned  corporations  and  groups  and \nother  small  private  investors  (23%),  foreign  build-operate-transfer  (BOT)  projects 2  (9.8%),  and \nimported power from the People's Republic of China (PRC) (3.7%).  \n\n                                                 \n1   Sources: Viet Nam household living standards surveys 2002, 2004, and 2006. Analysis of the data collected in the 2008 \n\nsurvey has not yet been completed and remains unavailable. \n\n2   Viet Nam distinguishes between IPPs and BOTs. Like BOTs, IPPs sell power to EVN under power purchase agreements \nbut these agreements are not as favorable to the investors as those with BOT investors, and may get renegotiated as the \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f11. \nA reliable electricity supply is essential for economic growth and to achieve poverty reduction \ntargets.  Based  on  the  Master  Plan  No.  VI  developed  in  2006,  to  address  the  electricity  deficit  and \nimprove the quality and reliability of electricity supply to industrial, rural, commercial, and residential \nconsumers, Viet  Nam  needs  to increase  its  generating  capacity  from  15,860  MW  in  2008  to 25,000 \nMW in 2010 and 60,000 MW in 2025. To meet the investment needs for generation transmission and \ndistribution, Viet Nam must mobilize about $4 billion per annum between 2009 and 2015, out of which \nabout  $2.3  billion  per  annum  will  be  spent  on  new  generation  facilities  and  the  remainder  will  be \ninvested  in  transmission  and  distribution.  Under  the  government  plans,  EVN  will  finance  about  two-\nthirds  of  the  investment  in  generating  plants  (one-third  is  to  be  given  to  local  and  foreign  direct \ninvestment  in  the  form  of  IPP  and  BOT  schemes)  and  100%  of  the  investment  in  transmission  and \ndistribution.  Official  development  assistance  and  other  external  sources  of  financing  will  remain \nsignificant  in  the  medium  term  as  local  borrowing.  Domestic  bond  issuance  and  equitization  are \nunlikely to be available. The government's Socio-economic Development Plan emphasizes the role of \nphysical  infrastructure  in  increasing  national  competitiveness  and  market  access,  and  attracting \ninvestments needed to sustain the economic and poverty reduction. ADB's country operation business \nplan 2009\u201320113 for Viet Nam, supports the objectives of the Socio-economic Development Plan and \nnotes  the  importance  of  removing  infrastructure  bottlenecks  in  the  power  sector  to  increase  the \ncompetitiveness of Viet Nam's private sector-led manufacturing and service sectors.  \n \n12. \nAs  part  of  ADB's  country  strategy  and  program  midterm  review  conducted  in  May  2009,  a \ngovernance-risk  assessment  study 4  in  the  energy  sector  in  Viet  Nam  concluded  that  the  Public \nFinancial  Management  Reform  Program,  led  by  the  MOF,  is  making  steady  progress,  with  support \nfrom  a  multidonor  trust  fund.  Despite  the  difficulties  of  tackling  corruption  in  an  environment  lacking \nauthentic  separation  of  powers,  there  is  clear  evidence  of  firm  government  commitment  and \nachievements.  Analysis  of  the  most  recent  aggregate  perception  data  suggests  that  (i)  both \ngovernance and corruption perceptions of Viet Nam are better than would be expected, (ii) corruption \nin Viet Nam is not a significant impediment to growth and poverty reduction, and (iii) cases of gross \ncorruption are relatively modest in size and are effectively tackled when they are exposed. Regarding \nthe power sector, the report concludes that EVN is an efficient and competent power utility although \nprocurement and financial management could be improved.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nKey Problems and Constraints  \n\n \n13. \n There  are  a  number  of  issues  in  the  sector:  (i)  high  dependence  on  hydropower,  (ii)  low \nreserve  margins,  (iii)  maintaining  adequate  investments  to  meet  exceptionally  rapid  growth  in \nelectricity  demand,  (iv)  addressing  shortcomings  in  pricing  and  tariffs,  and  (v)  continuing  sector \nreforms.  The  government  and  EVN  are  taking  measures  to  address  some  of  these  issues,  as \nexplained below. \n \n14. \nGeneration  mix.  As of the end of 2008, the share of hydropower was 37% of total installed \ncapacity, which is higher than the international average of about 15%, while that of coal (14% of the \ninstalled capacity) is lower than the international average of about 40%. While Viet Nam's dependency \non  hydropower  has  been  slightly  reduced  with  the  implementation  of  new  thermal  power  plants,  its \nreserve margin during the dry season remains dangerously low. The gas-fuelled power plants in the \n                                                 \n\nnature of the industry changes. IPPs do not meet the requirements of Decree 78 (BOT Decree) and hence are ineligible \nfor  government  support.  BOTs,  on  the  other  hand,  use  a  traditional  two-part  power  purchasing  agreement  (involving \ncapacity charge and energy charge) and may receive government support under Decree 78. Examples of BOTs are the \nPhu My 2.2 and Phu My 3 gas-fired power plants, both financed by ADB in 2002\u20132003. \n\n3   ADB. 2008. Country Operation Business Plan: Viet Nam, 2009\u20132011. Manila.  \n4   This  study  followed  the  methodology  set  out  in  the  implementation  guidelines  for  ADB.  2006.  Second  Governance  and \n\nAnticorruption Action Plan. Manila. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fsouth (representing about 42% of the installed capacity of the country) can supply only part of central \nand  northern  Viet  Nam's  power  demand  deficit,  and  at  a  higher  transmission  cost.  As  a  result,  Viet \nNam is importing electricity from the PRC during the dry season to meet demand in the north. Given \nthe  severe  capacity  shortage  and  imbalance  in  the  energy  mix,  the  government,  in  its  Sixth  Power \nDevelopment  Master  Plan,5 designates  coal  power  plants  as  key  base-load  generation  capacity  and \nhas  identified  priority  coal-fired  power  plants  for  immediate  implementation.  The  evolution  of  the \ngeneration mix is represented in Figure 1. \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1: Evolution of the Generation Mix\n\nHydropower\n\nCoal  \n\nGas \n\nOil \n\nImport from China, People\nRepublic of\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n \n\n     Source: Viet Nam Electricity. \n\n \n \n15. \nThe government estimates that the generation capacity addition of 42,000 MW during 2007\u2013\n2017 will cost $32.5 billion, or $46.0 billion inclusive of transmission and distribution investments. EVN \nis expected to fund about $35.0 billion of this but the remaining $11.0 billion needs to be undertaken \nby non-EVN parties, i.e., other state-owned enterprises and private sector investors.  \n \nViet Nam is relatively advanced in the participation of the private sector in power generation. \n16. \nOf the total 12,600 MW of installed capacity as of the end of 2007, EVN's share was 74% (9,359 MW), \nwith  14%  (1,771  MW)  being  IPPs,  i.e.,  domestic  non-EVN  investors  (private  and  state-owned \nenterprises), and 12% (1,466 MW) being BOTs, i.e., owned by foreign private investors. Even EVN's \ngeneration  plants  are  being  equitized  (i.e.,  partially  privatized)  with  the  exception  of  the  strategic \nmultipurpose  hydropower  plants.  As  of  the  end  of  2007,  about  1,500  MW  of  EVN's  generation \ncapacity had been equitized. \n \nPrivate  investment.  To  meet  the  substantial  investment  needs,  the  government  has  always \n17. \nintended to invite wider participation of the private sector in generation. In Phu My 2.2 and Phu My 3 \ngas-fired  power  plants,  the  government  used  a  unique  dual  approach  in  soliciting  private  sector \ninvestors through a competitive tender (for Phu My 2.2) and bilateral negotiation (Phu My 3). This dual \n\n                                                 \n5   The  Sixth  Power  Development  Master  Plan  stipulates  that  8,225  MW  of  BOT  capacities  will  be  commissioned  before \n\n2015, with another 6,450 MW as either BOT or IPP capacity. \n\n70.00%\n\n60.00%\n\n50.00%\n\n40.00%\n\n30.00%\n\n20.00%\n\n10.00%\n\n0.00%\n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fapproach resulted in shorter project development time and competitive tariffs because the tariff of the \nbilaterally  negotiated  project  (Phu  My  3)  was  controlled  by  benchmarking  against  the  tariff  of  the \ncompetitively tendered project (Phu My 2.2).  \n \n18. \nSince  the  Phu  My  projects,  the  government  has  continued  seeking  use  of  the  same  dual \napproach.  Because  the  general  regulatory  framework  for  private  sector  participation  is  not \ncomprehensive, the protections and incentives for investors had to be negotiated on a transaction-by-\ntransaction basis. However, the government does not have enough technical or financial capacity to \nundertake the complex task of negotiating BOT projects. The government has also adopted a unique \nprivate-public  partnership  (PPP)  approach,  where  one  power  plant  complex  hosts  both  an  EVN-\nowned plant and a private sector owned plant, with the sites and common facilities prepared by EVN \nwith  public  sector  financing.  While  this  approach  was  intended  to  ease  the  burden  on  the  private \nsector  investors,  this  has  often  resulted  in  delays  in  the  handover  of  the  site  to  the  private  sector \ninvestors, causing prolonged renegotiation of the tariff. \n \n19. \nReform of the power sector. Viet Nam is quite well advanced in terms of sector reforms. The \nLaw on Electricity was approved by the National Assembly XI Session 6 of Viet Nam on 3 December \n2004. Chapter IV of the law stipulates provisions for the electric market. Article 17 of the operational \nprinciples  (i)  ensures  transparency,  equality,  fair  competition,  and  nondiscrimination  among \nparticipants  in  the  electricity  market;  (ii)  appreciates  the  rights  to  select  partners  and  forms  of \ntransaction of electricity buyers and sellers on the market in accordance with the development level of \nthe  electricity  market;  and  (iii)  allows  the  state  to  regulate  the  operation  of  the  electricity  market  to \nachieve sustainable development of the electricity system, meeting the requirements of safe, stable, \nand  efficient  electric  supply.  Article  18  stipulates  that  the  electricity  market  will  be  formulated  and \ndeveloped  by  phases  by  setting  up  (i)  a  competitive  power  generation  market  (2005\u20132014),  (ii)  a \ncompetitive  power  wholesale  market  (2015\u20132023),  and  (iii)  a  competitive  power  retail  market  (after \n2024). \n \n20. \nBy  decision  No.  26/2006/QD-TTg  dated  26  January  2006,  the  prime  minister  approved  a \nschedule  and  conditions  for  the  formulation  and  development  of  the  power  market  in  Viet  Nam  that \nstipulates  (i)  assurance  of  stable  and  reliable  electric  supply  with  higher  quality;  (ii)  attracting \ninvestment  capital  in  electricity  from  all  economic  sectors,  both  domestically  and  abroad,  gradually \nreducing  the  state  budget  investment  in  the  electricity  industry;  (iii)  step-by-step  development  of  a \nstable  competitive  electricity  market,  eliminating  subsidy  for  the  electricity  industry  and  increasing \nelectricity  buyers\u2019  rights  to  select  electricity  suppliers;  (iv)  improving  the  production  and  business \nefficiency  of  the  electricity  industry,  and  rising  electricity  price;  and  (v)  ensuring  sustainable \ndevelopment of the electricity industry. \n \nIn  2005,  the  Electricity  Regulatory  Authority  of  Viet  Nam  (ERAV)  was  established  within  the \n21. \nMinistry  of  Industry  and  Trade  (MOIT)  with  its  mission  to  implement  the  above  decisions.  EVN  has \nseparated  the  generation,  transmission,  and  distributions  operations  into  separate  entities  under  a \nholding  company.  The  equitization  process  has  resulted  in  the  transformation  of  EVN's  subsidiaries \ninto power joint-stock companies enabling future sale of shares to private and public investors as well \nas to employees. The power sector in Viet Nam accounts for about six power operations subsidiaries \nthat  have  been  equitized  and  with  EVN  retaining  the  majority  of  its  shares.  Most  of  the  non-core \nbusiness subsidiaries of EVN have been equitized and EVN is a minority stakeholder in most of them. \n \n22. \nThe  ERAV  functions  include  (i)  issuing  and  enforcing  electricity  licenses,  (ii)  advising  the \nminister  on  power  market  structure  and  policy,  (iii)  establishing  retail  tariff-setting  principles  and \nmechanisms,  (iv)  proposing  market  design  and  developing  an  associated  regulatory  framework,  (v) \napproving  the  power  purchase  agreement  of  the  single  buyer,  (vi)  monitoring  the  progress  of  the \nimplementation  of  new  generation  and  transmission  projects,  (vii)  monitoring  the  operation  of  the \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fpower market, and (viii) monitoring and recommendations to protect the short- and long-term energy \nbalance. \n \n23. \nIn line with the sector reform road map, the government approved EVN\u2019s proposal to establish \nthe National Power Transmission Corporation (NPT) on 1 July 2008. The NPT is a fully state-owned \nsingle member limited liability company under EVN and is now officially in operation. It is responsible \nfor the investment, construction, operation, and maintenance of the transmission network in Viet Nam, \nincluding 220 kV and 500 kV lines and associated substations. NPT subsidiaries consist of four power \ntransmission  companies  (PTCs)\u2014Power  Companies  1,  2,  3,  and  4\u2014and  three  power  project \nmanagement  boards\u2014the  Northern  Power  Project  Management  Board,  Central  Power  Project \nManagement  Board,  and  Southern  Power  Project  Management  Board.  The  PTCs  are  dependent \naccounting  entities.  Their  expenses  are  allocated  based  on  actual  maintenance  cost,  without \naccounting for the transmitted power capacity or energy. The power project management boards are \nnonproductive entities and their duty is to manage investment projects according to an annual agreed \nplan and budget approved by EVN. The NPT is responsible for covering the expenses of investment \nand operation by itself. \n \nPricing  and  tariffs.  The  average  tariff  (even  if  it  was  increased  on  1  March  2009  to \n24. \n$0.058/kWh from $0.050/kWh) is still low due to the depreciation of the dong. Increases are needed \nfor  EVN  and  its  successor  companies  to  retain  earnings  that  are  needed  for  future  investment  and \nalso  to  attract  foreign  investors.  The  actions  on  the  tariff  are  part  of  the  power  sector  reform  that  is \ncurrently ongoing through various technical assistance projects funded by the \"Six Banks.\"6  \n \n25. \nThe government intends to retain a uniform national tariff all over the country that means that \nsome  cross-subsidy  mechanisms  between  regions  will  have  to  be  implemented.  In  addition,  a  tariff \nregime that is fair, transparent, and predictable is essential to attracting direct investment. Under the \npower sector reform, action on tariffs is a key element and the main issue will be to ensure that the \npoor are protected by maintaining some lifeline tariffs, and at the same time to ensure that the applied \ntariffs effectively reflect the cost of supply.7 By Resolution No.21/2009/QD-TTg of 12 February 2009, \nthe government approved a tariff adjustment mechanism. The tariff will have to be revised annually to \nreflect  the  market  price,  and  the  MOIT  and  the  MOF  will  be  responsible  for  assessing  and \nimplementing such adjustments.  \n \n26. \nNetwork performance. Electrical equipment in a power transmission and distribution network \nare  the  core  assets  of  a  power  utility.  The  development  of  the  network  needs  to  meet  both  the \nincrease in peak demand and the delivered energy. Failure  to do so will result in (i) the overload of \nhigh-voltage equipment, thus creating bottlenecks in the transmission and distribution network; and (ii) \nincreased  technical  losses.  Because  of  higher  transmission  and  distribution  losses,  more  electricity \nneeds to be generated to meet the same amount of power demand by end-use customers.  \n \n27.  With 14%\u201315% of demand for electricity growth during the past 10 years, and with additional \ngeneration  of  only  5,300  MW  between  2005  and  2008,  the  transmission  and  distribution  systems  in \nViet  Nam  need  urgent  reinforcement  to  remove  the  current  bottlenecks  and  decrease  the  technical \nlosses that are inherent in the system due to overloaded transmission and distribution lines and power \ntransformers.  \n \n\n                                                 \n6   The Six Banks in Viet Nam are the most active commercial banks in terms of official development assistance in Viet Nam: \n(i) the Agence  Fran\u00e7aise de  D\u00e9veloppement, (ii) ADB, (iii)  Japan International Cooperation  Agency, (iv) Korean Export\u2013\nImport Bank, (v) German Development Corporation through KfW, and (vi) the World Bank.  \n\n7   ADB is involved on a small scale in the determination of the tariffs through the technical assistance project  approved on \n22  December  2008  for  $225,000\u2014ADB.  2008.  Technical  Assistance  for  Capacity  Building  of  the  National  Power \nTransmission Corporation in a Competitive Power Market Environment. Manila (TA 7222-VIE). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f28. \nIn  addition,  in  early  2009,  the  government  requested  EVN  to  take  over  the  operation  and \nmaintenance  of  the  local  distribution  units  (LDUs)  that  distribute  power  on  behalf  of  EVN  at  the \ncommune level (EVN was asked to take over 7 million consumers in 5,000 communes) due to their \ninefficiency,  high  technical  and  commercial  losses  (about  25%),  and  high  tariff  applied  to  local \nconsumers. Although the tariffs are set at the national level, the retail tariffs at the LDU level are fixed \nby  the  communes.  The  LDUs  purchase  electricity  from  EVN  at  the  regulated  tariff  and  add  on  their \ndistribution costs that includes the technical and nontechnical losses plus their return on investment. \nBy taking over operation of these LDUs, EVN has to invest in the modernization and reinforcement of \nthese local distribution systems to meet EVN's technical standards and have in place a uniform tariff \nfor all consumers in the country.  \n \n29. \nThe  proposed  project.  The  proposed  project  aims  to  provide  EVN  the  means  to  access \ncommercial  bank  loans  on  competitive  terms  to  finance  short-term  investments  (2009\u20132011)  in \ntransmission and distribution. The project will include the construction of about 18 kilometers (km) of \n500 kV transmission line, 180 km of 220 kV transmission lines, and 280 km of 110 kV transmission \nlines, and will add 900 MVA of additional transformation capacity at the 500 kV level, 3,080 MVA of \nadditional  transformation  capacity  at  the  220  kV  level,  and  1,807  MVA  of  additional  transformation \ncapacity  at  the  110  kV  level.  On  the  medium-  and  low-voltage  grids,  the  project  will  add  more  than \n200 km of medium- and low-voltage lines and cables and will rehabilitate rural and urban grids. \n \n\n2. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n \nADB external assistance has mainly targeted generation and transmission projects rather than \n30. \ndistribution and rural electrification that has been the main focus of the World Bank, as explained in \npara. 31.  \n \n The  World  Bank  has  led  the  external  assistance  for  rural  electrification.  The  Rural \n31. \nElectrification  I  project  (completed  in  2007  with  a  total  investment  of  $150  million)  financed  the \nconnection of more than 500,000 households. Rural Electrification II (commenced in 2006 with $200 \nmillion,  supplemented  with  an  additional  $250  million  in  2008)  addressed  strengthening  EVN\u2019s \nmedium-voltage  network  to  support  rural  electrification,  rehabilitating  existing  low-voltage  systems \nowned and operated by LDUs, and developing institutions and participants to ensure service delivery. \nThe  Rural  Distribution  Project  (approved  in  2008  with  $150  million)  focused  on  improving  medium-\nvoltage systems (22 kV and 35 kV) and supports the corporate development of EVN. \n \n\n3. \n\nLessons  \n\n \n32. \nBetween  1995  and  2008,  ADB  made  six  public  sector  loans  to  the  Viet  Nam  power  sector \ncovering  distribution,  transmission,  and  generation.  There  were  two  private  sector  loans  for  two \nseparate gas-fired plants at Phu My, with a total value of $90.0 million and associated guarantees of \n$60.0 million. There were 27 technical assistance projects with a total value of $17.8 million. Ten of \nthese were project preparatory technical assistance to help prepare the design of investment projects. \nSome  of  the  advisory  technical  assistance  projects  were  designed  to  address  safeguard  issues \nthrough  building  capacity \nresettlement  planning  and \nfor  environmental  assessment  and \nimplementation,  while  others  assisted  in  drafting  energy  conservation  law  and  electricity  law,  and \npreparing  the  power  sector  road  map,  power  design,  and  capacity  building  of  the  ERAV  and  NPT's \ntransmission  tariff  formulation  and  benefit-sharing  mechanisms.  These  technical  assistance  projects \ncover  a  range  of  activities  including  reform  planning,  power  market  design,  and  promoting  the \ninvolvement of the private sector in particular projects. In addition, ADB has sustained a dialogue with \nthe government and its agencies, and with other development partners, over power sector policy and \nthe reform process.  \n \n33. \nADB\u2019s program of support to the Viet Nam power sector has been, and continues to be, highly \nrelevant to the country\u2019s development goal\u2014reducing poverty through high economic growth. ADB\u2019s \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fcountry and program strategy for 2007\u20132010 identifies the removal of power and other infrastructure \nbottlenecks as a major component of achieving business-led pro-poor economic growth. The various \npublic  sector  loans  which  ADB  has  provided  have  all  been  highly  relevant  to  the  country\u2019s  needs, \nfocusing  on  the  individual  priorities  within  the  sector  at  the  time  the  loans  were  made,  e.g., \ndistribution, transmission, and generation. Similarly, the technical assistance program has been fully \nsupportive  of  the  program  of  sector  reforms  advocated  by  both  government  and  development \npartners.  \n \n34. \nADB's  last  energy  sector  project  loans  used  to  finance  power  transmission  projects  were \napproved  in  December  2004  and  December  2005.8 There  have  been  no  problems  with  counterpart \nfinancing  and  it  is  not  foreseen  as  a  major  issue.  Compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  social  and  environmental \nsafeguards policies and slow processing of contract awards delayed implementation of these projects. \nLengthy procurement, land acquisition, and resettlement has been the main cause of implementation \ndelay of these two projects. The government\u2019s approval process, particularly for procurement, remains \ntime-consuming  and  has  led  to  project  implementation  delays.  Therefore,  the  proposed  subprojects \nhave been selected on the basis of their readiness (feasibility studies approved, and technical design \nand  bidding  documents  under  development)  and  also  on  the  basis  of  minimum  environmental  and \nsocial impacts.  \n \n35. \nEarlier  ADB  technical  assistance  (attached  to  loans)  concentrated  on  (i)  providing  capacity \nbuilding  to  the  power  sector,  specifically  to  financial  management  of  EVN\u2019s  distribution  units;  (ii) \nproviding  cost-based  electricity  tariff  setting;  (iii)  commercializing  distribution  companies;  and  (iv) \nsetting up a power sector regulatory framework. As a result, the corporate governance of the sector \nhas improved. A technical assistance project on power market design9 is assisting the government in \nmaking strategic decisions regarding (i) the market structure; (ii) role of EVN and its subsidiaries, and \nthe relationship among them; (iii) the nature of the regulatory regime and key regulatory mechanisms; \nand  (iv)  the  terms  of  power  purchase  arrangements  for  new  and  equitized  power  plants.  Ongoing \ntechnical  assistance is concentrating  on  the  computation  of  transmission  charges in  the  competitive \ngeneration market that is expected to start in January 2010.10 \n \n\n4. \n\nADB Sector Experience Strategy and Opportunities \n\nADB has approved four ordinary capital resources loans totaling $1.68 billion and three Asian \n36. \nDevelopment  Fund  loans 11\n totaling  $186.3  million  for  Viet  Nam\u2019s  power  sector.  The  Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  loans  were  primarily  for  expansion  and  rehabilitation  of  distribution  networks  in \nurban areas. The two ordinary capital resources loans approved in 2004 and 2005 finance expansion \nof  the  500  kV  high-voltage  transmission  systems  in  northern  Viet  Nam  (footnote  8).  More  recently, \nADB has focused on power generation. For example, the Mong Duong 1 Thermal Power Project and \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB.  2004.

The  competitiveness  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economy,  especially  the  industry \nsector,  depends  on  the  availability  of  a  cheap  and  reliable  supply  of  electricity.  ADB\u2019s  power  sector \nstrategy  aims  to  help  the  government  meet  the  challenge  of  increasing  demand  for  electricity  in  a \nfinancially, environmentally, and socially sustainable manner. The large investment requirement of the \npower  sector  requires  concerted  efforts  from  both  public  and  private  sector  investors.  A  significant \nproportion of the public sector investments will be financed through multilateral or bilateral financing, \nand  ADB  will  increasingly  seek  cofinancing  from  other  financiers  in  the  sector.  ADB  will  also  assist \npublic  sector  entities  in  the  sector  to  access  international  capital  markets  by  providing  advisory  and \nrisk-sharing instruments such as guarantee instruments. \n \n39. \nconventional lending arrangement. \n \n\nThis  project  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first  investment  in  the  power  subsector  in  Viet  Nam  not  using  a \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED GUARANTEE \n\n \nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe project will support economic growth in Viet Nam and aim to ensure access to a reliable \n40. \nsupply of quality electricity to meet the industrial, commercial, and residential consumer demands that \ngrew  at  a  rate  of  15%  per  annum  in  the  decade  since  1998.  With  the  financial  crisis,  the  level  of \ndemand growth has reduced to 10% in the first 6 months of 2009, but is nonetheless a double-digit \ngrowth rate. With such a growth rate, the country is facing power shortages and lacks investment in \nthe transmission and distribution systems that have led to an increase of technical losses from 10% in \n2007 to 11% in 2008.  \n \nThe  proposed  outcome  is  in  line  with  the  plan  of  EVN  and  the  government  to  add  at  least \n41. \nanother 10,000 MW of installed capacity in 2010\u20132011. The project will help the government meet this \ntarget in terms of economic development of the country.

In accordance with \nthe  Article  3.16  of  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  ADB  will \nconduct  post-review  of  the  procurement  process  to  ensure  (i)  the  need  for  economy  and  efficiency, \nincluding  procurement  of  the  goods  and  works  involved;  (ii)  all  eligible  bidders  from  developed  and \ndeveloping  countries  are  given  the  same  information  and  equal  opportunity  to  compete  in  providing \ngoods  and  works;  and  (iii)  there  is  transparency  in  the  procurement  process.  A  preliminary \nprocurement  assessment  of  the  11  subsidiaries  shows  that  all  subsidiaries  have  already  worked \nunder  ADB  or  under  the  World  Bank  procurement  guidelines  and  are  reasonably  familiar  with  their \nprocurement processes.  \n\n \n\n\f4. \n\nStakeholder Participation and Consultation \n\n \n54. \nHigh-level  and  working-level  consultations  will  be  held  by  ADB  and/or  by  the  TA  consultant \nwith EVN on a regular basis to ensure implementation of social and environmental safeguard plans, \nincluding  regular  meetings  with  commercial  banks  on  loan  disbursements.  EVN  will  be  required  to \nrecruit an independent monitoring agency, within three months after effectiveness of the guarantee to \nmonitor  the  implementation  of  safeguards  plans  and  provide  quarterly  progress  reports  during  the \nimplementation of the project. \n \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n55. \nEVN subsidiaries will prepare and maintain separate accounts for project-related expenditures. \nEVN  finance  corporation  as  the  PMU  will  consolidate  and  review  such  accounts and,  after  auditing, \nsubmit  the  same  to  ADB.  Project  accounts  will  be  audited  annually  by  an  independent  auditor \nacceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  together  with  the  audit \nreport will be submitted to ADB no later than 6 months following the close of the fiscal year to which \nthey relate. \n \n56. \nEVN will maintain a (i) self financing ratio of 25% or above, (ii) debt service coverage ratio of \n1.5  or  above,  and  (iii)  long-term  debt-equity  ratio  of  at  least  70:30  or  less.  EVN  will  (i)  maintain  an \ninternal  audit  function  to  undertake  timely  audit  of  project  accounts  in  accordance  with  generally \naccepted accounting principles; (ii) maintain separate accounts for the Project, including the financing \nprovided  by  EVN;  and  (iii)  provide  monthly  progress  reports,  annual  audited  project  accounts,  and \nconsolidated audited accounts of EVN. \n \nThe  EVN  finance  corporation,  as  the  PMU,  will  prepare  quarterly  financial  and  physical \n57. \nprogress reports and submit these to ADB. The monthly reports are to be submitted not later than 1 \nmonth following the end of the quarter to which they relate. Within 3 months of project completion, the \nPIU will submit to ADB a project completion report. \n \n\n6. \n\nClean Development Mechanism Credits \n\n \n58. \nBy decreasing technical losses of the transmission and distribution systems in Viet Nam, the \nproject has good chances to be eligible for carbon credit revenues. Assessment and development of \nthe corresponding documentation will be explored during project implementation. \n \nG. \n\nFinancial Performance of Viet Nam Electricity \n\nBased  on  EVN's  audited  financial  statements  of  2006\u20132008,  EVN's  financial  performance \n59. \nduring  the  last  3  years  was  analyzed.  EVN's  profit  after  tax  increased  from  D2.26  trillion  in  2006  to \nD3.34  trillion  in  2007,  but  decreased  to  D1.29  trillion  in  2008.  This  is  due  mainly  to  high  domestic \nborrowing costs and high fuel costs in 2008. In addition to these high costs, in 2008 EVN incurred a \nlarge foreign exchange loss due to depreciation of the dong against the dollar and yen. \n \n60. \nIn  the  longer  term,  EVN's  challenge  will  be  to  maintain  its  financial  strength  given  the  high \ninvestment requirement in the power sector. Electricity demand was affected by the global economic \ncrisis, and demand growth slowed in 2008\u20132009. However, the demand for electricity is expected to \ncontinue to grow strongly after 2010 as Viet Nam continues its industrialization and modernization of \nits economy. EVN's total investment requirement for 2009\u20132015 is $20.56 billion (60.7% of which will \nbe invested in generation, 22.3% in transmission, and the remainder in distribution). \n \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\n61. \nCognizant  of  this  challenge,  the  government  has  taken  several  measures  to  assist  EVN  to \nstrengthen its financial performance. One important measure was the tariff increase effective 1 March \n2009, 15 when  the  retail  tariff  was  increased  on  average  by  8.9%.  The  adjusted  average  tariff  is \nD950/kWh. More importantly, the decision allows for future annual tariff adjustments based on market \nconditions.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Trade  are  responsible  for  issuing \nguidelines for tariff adjustment in the future. This tariff adjustment process will be implemented starting \nin  2010.  Another  measure  to  assist  EVN  to  strengthen  its  financial  status  is  the  approval  by  the \ngovernment for EVN to increase its capital. Currently EVN's aggregate capital is D64 trillion. In June \n2009,  the  government  approved  a  plan  for  EVN  to  increase  its  capital  to  D110  trillion  in  2010,  and \nEVN is working on appropriate measures to achieve this. With increased capital, EVN will be able to \nmobilize  more  resources  while  maintaining  the  debt\u2013equity  ratio.  Detailed  analysis  of  the  power \nsubsector is in Appendix 3. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n62. \nA  $720,000  advisory  technical  assistance  project  will  be  provided  to  ensure  compliance  with \nADB's requirements in terms of procurement and environmental and social safeguards policies. The \ntechnical  assistance  will  be  financed  through  the  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-others, \n$600,000). EVN and its subsidiaries will provide $120,000 in-kind (office space and counterpart staff \nremuneration  and  per  diem).  EVN  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  technical  assistance  and  its \nsubsidiaries will be the implementing agencies. The technical assistance consultants will be selected \nand  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  The  disbursement  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook.16 The technical assistance is expected to commence in January \n2010  and  finish  in  December  2013.  Detailed  description  of  the  technical  assistance  is  provided  in \nSupplementary Appendix H. Outline terms of reference for consultants are provided in Appendix 8. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n\nProject Justification \n\n63. \nIn addition to filling a funding gap for EVN at a time when commercial lending in Viet Nam has \ndiminished considerably  due  to  the  global  financial  crisis, the  commercial  banks  have  indicated  that \nthey  would  be  unwilling  to  make  a  long-tenor  loan  to  EVN  without  a  credit  enhancement  by  ADB. \nFurther,  as  a  large  proportion  of  the  equipment  (about  80%)  is  being  sourced  within  Viet  Nam,  the \ncommercial  banks  cannot  insure  a  significant  portion  of  EVN's  payment  risk  with  an  export  credit \nagency.  Hence,  without  ADB  involvement,  private  political  risk  insurers  might  be  willing  to  provide \ninsurance  on  terms  and  conditions  that  would  probably  not  be  acceptable  to  EVN.  Therefore  ADB's \ninvolvement in the project is essential.  \n \n \n64. \nADB's guarantee will help reduce EVN\u2019s cost of borrowing and increase the tenor of the loan. \nHence, relying on ADB\u2019s AAA credit rating, the commercial banks will provide a longer tenor loan then \nthey  normally  would  for  this  type  of  project  and  they  will  also  reduce  their  margin  based  on  ADB\u2019s \ncredit rating. Finally, ADB's involvement in the project will also encourage private insurers to provide \ninsurance  for  that  portion  of  the  loan  not  guaranteed  by  ADB,  on  more  competitive  terms  and  at  a \nlower cost to EVN, further reducing EVN\u2019s cost of funding. \n \n65. \nProviding  a  guarantee  to  a  commercial  bank  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  to \npromote private sector participation in infrastructure development as well as offer guarantee products \n\n                                                 \n15  PM decision No. 21/2009/QD-TTg. \n16  Asian Development Bank. 2007. Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook. Manila \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nfor  sovereign  projects.  ADB  also  encourages  risk  participation  with  other  guarantors  and  insurers, \nboth public and private.  \n \n66. \nAll  proposed  subprojects  are  included  in  the  National  Power  Master  Plan  No.  VI  which  was \napproved  by  the  government  in  2006.  The  financial  assessment  of  subprojects  is  conducted  by \nestimating the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) and the financial internal rate of return (FIRR). \nFeasibility studies under this guarantee program are prepared by subsidiaries of EVN in accordance \nwith the government regulation. The government decree17 provides the guideline for the preparation \nof  feasibility  studies.  Appendix  7  explains  the  government  guidelines  and  criteria  for  the  feasibility \nstudy  of  subprojects,  and  show  economic  and  financial  assessments, prepared  by  EVN  staff, of  the \n220 kV Trang Bang\u2013Tay Ninh transmission line subproject as a case model. The EIRR is 34.2% and \nthe FIRR is 17.5%, compared with the project weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 10.45%. \nSensitivity analysis indicates that both the EIRR and FIRR will exceed the WACC under the event of \ncost  overrun  of  10%  and  20%.  Given  the  overall  objectives  of  the  subproject,  the  economic  and \nfinancial performance is deemed acceptable, and the subproject is considered financially viable and \nsustainable.  For  consistency  purposes  in  undertaking  such  analysis  for  the  other  subprojects,  a \nmethodology  has  been  developed  for  the  use  of  EVN's  staff  and  is  provided  as  Supplementary \nAppendix I.   \n \nB. \n \n\nEnvironmental and Social Safeguards \n\n1. \n\nResettlement  \n\n \n67. \n Based on the available technical designs for the 66 proposed subprojects, it is expected that \n32  will  not  require  land  acquisition.  These  are  not  expected  to  require  land  acquisition  due  to  their \nsmall scale, location within existing corridors and rights of way, technical capability to avoid impacts, \nlocation within public land (roads, etc.) or on land specifically identified and reserved for the purpose. \nThese  projects  have  been  categorized  as  follows:  (i)  extension  of  transformation  capacity  or \nupgrading  of  existing  substations  (9  subprojects),  (ii)  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  existing  rural \ngrids  (5  subprojects),  (iii)  rehabilitation  or  upgrading  of  urban  overhead  lines  (2  subprojects),  (iv) \ninstallation  of  underground  cables  under  sidewalks  or  in  the  streets  (3  subprojects);  (v)  new \nsubstations to be constructed within existing industrial zones (10 subprojects); or (vi) new substations \nto be constructed on land vacated by former state enterprises (3 subprojects). It is acknowledged that, \nalthough the probability of resettlement impacts are low with these types of projects, if land acquisition \nand  resettlement  impacts  are  unavoidable,  resettlement  plans  would  need  to  be  prepared  in \naccordance with the approved resettlement framework. \n \n68. \nFor  the  remaining  34  subprojects,  some,  marginal  resettlement  impacts  are  expected. \nAccording  to  the  available  technical  designs,  the  development  of  the  proposed  new  substations  (21 \nsubproject),  transmission  lines  (12  subprojects),  and  the  development  of  rural  grids  (1  subprojects) \nwill require an aggregate amount of about 60.4 hectares (ha) of land and has the potential to impact \n1,800\u20131,900 households. ADB due diligence has found power companies and their consultants have \nworked  in  close  cooperation  with  local  authorities  from  a  very  early  stage  of  project  preparation  to \navoid, or at least minimize, the acquisition of land and the negative impacts on assets and livelihoods \nof  local  communities.  During  the  selection  of  sites  for  new  substations  and  the  design  of  new \ndistribution and transmission line routes, priority was given to land which has a low economic value \nand which is not used for residential or livelihood purposes. Site locations are proposed on public or \ncollective unit lands wherever possible to avoid impacts on privately owned or used lands. In addition, \nthe  technical  designs  proposed  attempt  to  minimize  the  impact  by  recommending  the  use  of  low-\nimpact technology such as gas-insulated substations (GISs), the use of steel poles instead of lattice \ntowers, and the use of underground cables. \n                                                 \n17  Decree No.12/2009/ND-CP of February 12 2009 on management of investment projects on the construction of works. \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\n \nDespite the design attempts to avoid resettlement impacts, some unavoidable impacts will be \n69. \ncreated on agricultural land (in low land), forest (in upland areas), unused public land, and/or public \ndomains.  A  small  amount  of  residential  land  (some  with  houses  or  secondary  structures)  may  be \naffected  by  the  rights  of  way  of  the  transmission  lines.  In  addition  to  these  potential  impacts  on \nresidential land, some project-affected people may experience severe impacts created by the loss of \nmore  than  10%  of  their  productive  agricultural  landholding.  The  precise  number  of  affected  people \nand  severely  affected  people  will  only  be  known  when  the  detailed  technical  designs  and \nmeasurement  surveys  are  completed.  However,  based  on  available  information,  no  proposed \nsubprojects are expected to create significant resettlement impacts as defined by ADB's Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). All proposed subprojects involving involuntary resettlement are classified \nas category B and will require short resettlement plans that will be submitted to ADB for review and \nclearance before the civil works can start. \n \n70. \n Two  core  subprojects  (Le  Thien  110  kV  substation  and  the  Tien  Lang  110  kV  transmission \nline  project)  have  been  fully  appraised,  including  the  preparation  of  resettlement  plans  and  initial \nenvironmental examinations. This documentation has been prepared to meet the requirements of the \nresettlement framework  and the environmental assessment and review framework  which have been \nprepared for the project. \n \n71. \nThe  summary  of  the  resettlement  framework  is  provided  in  Appendix  6  and  the  full \nresettlement framework is provided as Supplementary Appendix A, The resettlement plans for the two \ncore  subprojects  are  provided  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B  and  the  due  diligence  report  on \nresettlement  for  six  subprojects  for  which  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  has  been  completed  is \nprovided in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Impact  \n\n \n72. \nThe  transmission  and  distribution  project  will  have  66  subprojects  located  in  30  provinces  in \nViet  Nam.  The  subprojects  comprise  (i)  constructing  new  transmission conventional  substations;  (ii) \nrehabilitating,  upgrading,  and  extending  500  kV,  220  kV,  and  110  kV  conventional  substations;  (iii) \nconstructing  new  GISs;  (iv)  extending  existing  GISs;  (v)  constructing  new  distribution  lines  and  220 \nkV and 110 kV overhead transmission lines; (vi) installing underground cables; and (vii) rehabilitating \nurban  and  rural  distribution  networks  or  grids.  The  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  prepared \nfor  the  project  covers  subprojects  with  available  feasibility  studies,  while  an  environmental \nassessment and review framework has been prepared for subprojects where the location, alignment, \nand components are still uncertain. An initial environmental examination (IEE); review framework; and \ninitial environmental examinations have been prepared for representative subprojects. In addition one \ndue diligence report has been prepared for a completed subproject. \n \n73. \nNone of the subprojects will be in ecologically or culturally sensitive sites. Affected areas are \nprimarily agricultural land planted to rice and various crops as well as tree plantations (acacia, rubber \ntrees,  eucalyptus),  land  in  urban  areas,  or  idle  plots.  For  the  transmission  route  in  Song  May\u2013Uyen \nHung (in the provinces of Dong Nai and Binh Duong), some mature trees will need to be removed as \nthe  alignment  will  pass  through  acacia  and  rubber  tree  plantations.  The  other  high-voltage \ntransmission line routes will involve cutting of small diameter trees and will mainly traverse agricultural \nland. Underground cables will be installed following road alignments in urban areas. The land required \nfor each new conventional substation is estimated as follows: (i) 500 kV substation, 12 ha; (ii) 220 kV \nsubstation, 0.9\u20133.6 ha; and (iii) 110 kV substation, 0.24\u20130.76 ha. The land requirement for new GISs \nwill  be  0.1\u20130.3  ha  each.  The  total  area  for  all  new  substations  will  be  a  maximum  of  about  46  ha. \nAcquisition of land for extending existing conventional substations and constructing GISs will not be \nrequired  as  this  will  be  within  existing  EVN  substation  areas.  Additional  land,  which  will  be  a \ncombination of privately owned and public land, may be acquired for access roads. \n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n74. \nFor  installation  of  underground  cables,  only  temporary  impacts  are  expected  to  occur  during \nthe  construction  phase.  Methods  to  be  adopted  for  installation  of  underground  cables  will  be  either \nboring  (across  road  intersections  and  very  narrow  streets)  or  by  trenching  (dig  and  fill).  The \nunderground cables will be installed 1.0\u20132.5 meters (m) below ground level. The excavation width for \ntrenching  is  1.5  m  and,  depending  on  the  decision  of  the  local  government,  this  will  be  undertaken \neither on the road carriageway or on the sidewalk. The underground cable subprojects are located in \nurban areas. Rehabilitation of medium- and low-voltage grids in urban and rural areas are expected to \ncause  only  minor  impacts  during  site  works.  Activities  will  include  reconductoring of  existing  electric \npoles  as  well  as  installation  of  additional  wooden  poles  on agricultural  fields, public  land,  and  along \nthe  roads.  Earthworks,  dust  emission,  and  dust  generation  will  be  minimal  during  pole  installation \nsince excavation will be done manually over a small area of only 1 square meter (m2) per pole.  \n \n75. \nThe  environmental  assessment  has  identified  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the \nimplementation of the various subprojects. Such impacts pertain to dust emission, noise generation, \nsiltation of nearby surface water bodies due to surface run-off, spill or leak of hazardous substances \nsuch  as  fuel  and  oil,  clearing  of  vegetation  (particularly  for  installation  of  high-voltage  transmission \nlines),  and  traffic  congestion.  Predicted  impacts  will  be  largely  experienced  during  the  construction \nphase  and  are  considered  temporary.  The  environmental  assessment  includes  environmental \nmitigation  measures,  and  corresponding  monitoring  activities  and  institutional  responsibilities  to \nensure that impacts are reduced to acceptable levels. The summary IEE is provided in Supplementary \nAppendix L, the IEEs for the two core subprojects are provided in Supplementary Appendix D, and the \nenvironmental assessment and review framework is provided in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n\n3. \n\nSocial Impact \n\n \nThe  social  assessment  in  the  project  areas  show  that  electricity  problems,  shortage  of \n76. \nelectricity,  unreliable  power  voltage,  and  power  cuts  have  implications  for  industry,  business,  home \nindustry, health, and education facilities. Viet Nam is shifting away from a centrally planned economy \nto  a  more  market-oriented  economy.  Industries,  services,  and  businesses  are  booming.  In  the \nsubproject  areas,  there  are  many  small  businesses  such  as  restaurants,  cafes,  karaoke  bars,  and \nfood  processing  plants,  and  these  business  activities  are  a  major  source  of  income  for  local \nentrepreneurs.  However,  these  businesses  require  large  amounts  of  reliable  and  stable  power,  and \npower  cuts  and  voltage  fluctuation  have  significant  negative  impacts  on  local  businesses.  For \nexample, in Nam Sach district, a food processing plant (soy curd) can lose D5 million a night due to \npower  cuts.  Some  entrepreneurs  use  generators  for  their  businesses  but  most  of  them  does  own \ngenerators  and  are  suffering  of  production  losses.  Farmers  use  electric  water  pumps  for  irrigation. \nHowever,  due  to  unstable  and  insufficient  power  supply,  they  sometimes  use  diesel-powered  water \npumps which cost three times as much to run. Big enterprises such as in the shrimp industry can lose \nseveral thousand dollars a day due to power cuts. Workers can also lose income due to power cuts. \nIn  the subproject  areas there  are  21  industrial zones in  food  processing,  shipping,  coal  exploitation, \ngarment industries, etc. Although these industrial sites have private power lines, breakdowns due to \noverloading and old cables result in power cuts 5\u20137 days a month. Some big industries have to buy-\nhigh  volume  power  generators,  and  in  some  cases  garment  factories  have  to  replace  automatic \nmachines  with  manual  ones.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  outlined  in \nAppendix 5.  \n \n77. \nElectrical  power  supply  is  usually  cut  off  during  the  hot  periods  in  summer.  In  addition, \nelectricity  quality  is  not  stable  and  reliable.  Due  to  inadequate  electric  supply,  domestic  equipment \nsuch  as  TVs,  cooking  stoves,  and  electric  lamps  can  not  be  operated.  Because  of  power  cuts  and \ninsufficient power, clean water factories in some communes and wards in Hai Duong province are not \nworking.  As  a  result,  80%  of  households  do  not  have  clean  water.  Women  bear  the  burden  of \nelectricity  problems.  Instead  of  using  electricity  for  cooking,  they  have  to  use  firewood,  straw, \ncharcoal, or dried leaves. The commune leaders advised that, during power cuts, around 70%\u201380% of \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\nthe population have no fresh water, and water must be carried by shoulder poles from public wells\u2014a \nburden which is generally taken up by women. \n \n78. \nIn recent years, with the economic development the health facilities have been equipped with \nmodern  amenities.  The  inadequate  electrical  power  supply  causes  difficulties  in  medical  practices \nsuch as medical checks, surgery, preservation of medicine, etc. In some project areas, such as Tien \nLang, Hai Phong, because there are power cuts for 7\u201310 days in a month, diesel-power generators \nwere  bought,  which  increases  the  cost  of  providing  medical  services.  Despite  the  government \nattempts to invest in more human resources, medications, and facilities in hospitals, medical centers, \nand clinics in the rural areas, rural people still have go to provincial hospitals because of poor power \nsupply in the rural health centers. This has resulted in more pressure on hospitals and health facilities \nat the provincial level. The power cuts in schools and colleges disturb laboratory work for the students \nand the teaching process, and affect the quality of learning.  \n \n79. \nAt an individual level, low-quality power supply introduces some extra cost for middle-income \nconsumers, as the life span of electric appliances is reduced. The investments for construction of new \n220  kV  and  110  kV substations  and  upgrading  and  rehabilitating  the  rural  grid  network  will  facilitate \nadequate  and  reliable  electricity  supply  for  individual  customers,  industries,  businesses,  public \nfacilities,  etc.  The  supply  of  adequate  and  reliable  electricity  will  increase  business  opportunities  for \nmanufacturing  and  hotels,  and  will  provide  employment  opportunities.  The  negative  impact  of  the \nproject  relates  to  resettlement  activities  such  as  land  acquisition.  The  resettlement  plan  includes \nmitigation measures for the affected people. \n \n80. \nEthnic minority groups such as Khmers, K\u2019ho, Chu ru, Tay, and Nung live in the areas of the \nDuc Trong 220 kV substation and its connecting lines as well as near the Tra Vinh 220 kV substation \nand the Dai Tu 110 kV transmission line. The ethnic minority groups are integrated into mainstream \nsociety, and so the resettlement impacts on ethnic minority groups are no different than for the main \nKinh ethnic group. To ensure that ethnic minority people will not be marginalized during the process of \nresettlement, ethnic minority-specific action is included in the resettlement framework. \n \nC. \n \n81. \nThe  primary  risks  of  the  ADB  guarantee  are  (i)  the  credit  risk  of  EVN,  (ii)  foreign  exchange \nrisks, and (iii) the ability of the Government to honor its obligations to the commercial banks under the \nMOF  guarantee.  EVN\u2019s  failure  to  pay  under  the  commercial  banks\u2019  loan  could  trigger  a  call  on  the \nMOF  guarantee,  which  could  result  in  a  demand  under  the  ADB  guarantee.  These  risks  will  be \nmitigated by (i) the sovereign indemnity provisions in the MOF guarantee that will obligate Viet Nam to \nreimburse ADB for payments ADB makes to the commercial banks\u2019 pursuant to the ADB guarantee, \nand (ii) the annual revision of the tariffs that will reflect changes in both fuel costs and local inflation. In \naddition,  in  March  2009,  Viet  Nam  introduced  an  annual  tariff  adjustment  under  the  proposed \ncompetitive power generation market, which will also mitigate some of the risks to the project. \n \nRisks  for  Viet  Nam  Electricity  and  its  subsidiaries.  This  project  involves  conventional \n82. \ntechnology  and  EVN  and  its  subsidiaries  have  all  the  necessary  technical  skills  to  design  and \nimplement  the  transmission  systems.  The  suppliers  of  equipment  will  be  selected  in  a  competitive \nmanner from among ADB's member countries, which from experience includes European and Asian \nmanufacturers.  The  proposed  project  is  considered  sound  and  capable  of  withstanding  changes  in \nmajor  parameters.  Institutional  risks  are  not  considered  significant  as  EVN  has  a  comprehensive \norganizational  structure at  its  central  headquarters  and  branch  offices  in  main  cities  in  Viet  Nam.  In \nmany ways, EVN is a well-run utility. Its operating costs are low, transmission and distribution losses \nare reasonable, and revenue collection is good. The due diligence conducted in the 11 subsidiaries \nshows  that  all  of  them  have  experience  with  multilateral  and  bilateral  institutions  such  as  ADB, \nAgence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  or  the  World  Bank, \nand thus are familiar with the concept of competitive bidding. \n\nRisks \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \nEVN's tariff revenues are in dong whilst the loan from the commercial banks will be in foreign \n83. \ncurrencies, thus creating a currency mismatch. This can be seen as a risk, especially in light of EVN\u2019s \nexperience in FY2008 where currency mismatch caused EVN to breach its financial covenants under \nits existing loans. However, due to the adoption of resolution No. 272 of February 2009, tariffs will be \nrevised  annually  and  adjusted  to  the  current  economic  situation.  In  addition,  the  introduction  of  a \ngeneration competitive market in 2010 and of a retail competitive market later on can be seen as a \nstabilization factor in the medium-to-long term. \n \n84. \nEconomic stability. The debt sustainability analysis carried out by the International Monetary \nFund and the World Bank in February 2009 shows that Viet Nam remains at low risk of debt distress \ndespite the recent deterioration in its economic conditions and the global downturn.  All external debt \nsustainability indicators are projected to remain well below the applicable debts threshold. Total public \ndebt, however, is expected to be adversely affected by the ongoing global downturn. Public debt will \nalso  be  affected  by  the  government  stimulus  plan  to  mitigate  the  economic  slowdown.  However, \nprovided the package is prudently financed, the burden of public debt could be manageable. \n \nD. \n\nAnticorruption  Policy,  and  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism \n\n \n85. \nThe  commercial  banks  and  EVN  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended  to  date)  and  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  Policy \n(2003).  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB \nwill require the commercial banks' and EVN to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures \nand controls following international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or \nmoney  laundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging  in  such  activities.  The  financing  documentation  between  ADB  and  the  commercial  banks \nand  between  the  commercial  banks  and  EVN  will  further  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or \npotential violation of these undertakings. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n86. \ndocumentation: \n \n\n(i) \n\nEVN  will  give \n\nthe \n\nfollowing  assurances,  which  will  be \n\nincorporated \n\ninto \n\nthe \n\nlegal \n\nEVN  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  and  the  Combating  Money \nLaundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  Policy.

The financial results are for the 3 years 2006\u20132008, and are based on audited financial \nstatements. The projected financial statements for 2009\u20132015 are prepared in current terms. \n \n2. \nAs at 31 December 2008, the aggregate capital of EVN was D64 trillion. In June 2009, the \ngovernment  approved  to  increase  EVN's  capital  to  D110  trillion,  with  a  revaluation  of  existing \nassets.  EVN  has  39  subsidiaries  and  20  dependent  units  (power  plants,  power  project \nmanagement boards, and centers).  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nFY2008  results.  The financial performance of EVN in 2006\u20132008 is summarized in Table \nA2.1. In 2008, EVN's profit after tax decreased from D3,336 billion in 2006 to D1,287 billion in 2008 \nmainly  due  to  high  fuel  costs  and  high  domestic  borrowing  costs.  As  a  result,  EVN  did  not  meet \nfinancial  covenants  relating  to  the  self-financing  ratio  (25%  minimum)  and  debt  service  coverage \nratio  (1.5  minimum).  Long-term  debt  has  increased  from  54%  to  65%,  which  is  close  to  the \ncovenant ceiling of 70%. \n\nFinancial Performance of Viet Nam Electricity \n\n \nTable A2.1: Past Financial Performance of EVN \n(D billion) \n \n\n  \n\n   Cost of sales \n   Gross profit from sales \n   Financial expenses \n  \n   Selling expenses \n  \n  \n   Administration expenses \n   Net profit from operations \n   Profit before tax \n   Corporate income tax \n\nItem \nIncome Statement \n   Revenues \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n   Profit After Tax \n  \n  \n  \nBalance Sheet \n  \n  \n  \n  \n   Total Assets \n   Liabilities \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n   Equity \n   Total Liabilities and Equity \n  \nFinancial Ratio Covenants \n   Self-financing ratio \n   DSCR \n   Debt to equity ratio \n\n   Current assets \n   Noncurrent assets \n   Fixed assets \n  \n   Long-term investments \n  \n\n   Current liabilities \n   Long-term liabilities \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n2006 \n\n  \n    44,917  \n  (37,256) \n      7,661  \n    (2,537) \n    (1,307) \n    (2,111) \n      2,462  \n      2,606  \n       (365) \n      2,256  \n  \n  \n    39,723  \n    98,059  \n    96,074  \n         861  \n  137,783  \n    83,335  \n    19,602  \n    63,733  \n    54,447  \n  137,783  \n  \n  \n\n19.8% \n2.13 \n57:43 \n\n2007 \n\n  \n    58,106  \n  (48,328) \n      9,778  \n    (3,477) \n    (1,758) \n    (2,568) \n      3,354  \n      4,217  \n    (1,112) \n      3,336  \n  \n  \n    49,814  \n  135,097  \n  129,201  \n      3,170  \n  184,910  \n  106,904  \n    25,601  \n    81,302  \n    78,007  \n  184,910  \n  \n  \n\n44.1% \n1.86 \n54:46 \n\n2008 \n\n  \n    64,656  \n  (55,654) \n      9,002  \n    (4,856) \n    (1,961) \n    (2,555) \n      1,384  \n      1,536  \n       (511) \n      1,287  \n  \n  \n    47,643  \n  157,379  \n  149,130  \n      5,331  \n  205,022  \n  136,545  \n    25,649  \n  110,897  \n    64,160  \n  205,022  \n  \n  \n\n15.5% \n1.37 \n65:35 \n\n     ( ) = negative, DSCR = debt service coverage ratio, EVN = Viet Nam Electricity. \n\n \n             Source: Viet Nam Electricity. \n \n\n4. \nElectricity  demand.  As  Viet  Nam  continues  to  industrialize  and  modernize  its  economy, \nhigh electricity demand is expected to continue. The majority of increased demand comes from the \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nindustry  sector,  which  accounted  for  50.3%  of  demand  in  2008,  reflecting  the  importance  of  Viet \nNam\u2019s emerging manufacturing and industrial base. Affected by the current global financial crisis, \nthe economic growth of Viet Nam in 2009 is forecasted to decline. However, demand for electricity \nis expected to continue to grow strongly in the coming years. It is expected that electricity demand \nwill  increase  by  10%  in  2009.

By decision No. 21/2009/Q\u0110-TTg of the government with effect from 1 \nMarch  2009,  the  electricity  retail  tariff  was  increased  by,  on  average,  8.92%  as  compared  to  the \ntariff for 2008. The adjusted average tariff is D948.5/kilowatt-hour (kWh). The Ministry of Finance \nand the Ministry of Industry and Trade will issue guidelines for the tariff increasing mechanism. The \ntariff increase is a crucial step that will enable EVN to grow strongly and help it to cover sufficiently \nits  operational  costs  and  capital  requirements.  After  2010,  EVN's  electricity  selling  prices  will  be \nadjusted annually under the market-based mechanism. Such adjustments of the electricity selling \nprices are subject to approval of state authorities (the prime minister, Ministry of Industry and Trade \nand Ministry of Finance) if increases of more than 5% are required. \n \n7. \nForeign  exchange  risks. EVN has a number  of loans denominated in foreign currencies \nsuch as yen or dollars. However, EVN has not hedged against the exchange rate risk, especially in \nthe  case  of  an  appreciation  of  the  yen  or  of  the  dollar  against  the  dong  due  to  limited  market \nliquidity. Thus, a significant change in the exchange rate between dong and those currencies may \nadversely affect the results of the operations of EVN. In 2008, EVN made a foreign exchange loss \nof D10.6 trillion based on International Accounting Standards. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f28  \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n \nC. \n \n8. \nas follows: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nProjected Financial Performance of Viet Nam Electricity \n\nProjected financial statements for 2009\u20132015 have been prepared.

MOIT  is  responsible  for  supervising  implementation  of  government  policy,  and \nrecommending  and  drafting  major  policy  reforms  for  government  adoption.  MOIT  has  specific \nresponsibility to implement the government\u2019s policy of full electrification by 2020 and promoting \nrenewable energy generation. \n \n2. \nViet Nam Electricity (EVN), the main power utility of Viet Nam, is organized as a holding \ncompany,  with  a  series  of  wholly  owned  subsidiaries.  EVN  owns  the  strategic  power  plants, \nholds majority shareholding stakes in partially privatized power plants, and invests as the sole \ninvestor  or  in  partnership  with  other  public  and  private  investors  in  new  power  plants.  Key \nsubsidiaries  include  three  regional power  companies  that  are  in  charge  of  power  transmission \nand  distribution  from  110  kilovolts  (kV)  and  less  in  northern  Viet  Nam  (Power  Company  1 \n[PC1]), southern Viet Nam (Power Company 2 [PC2]), and central Viet Nam (Power Company 3 \n[PC3]); and power distribution companies responsible for power distribution in large cities such \nas Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Hai Phong, Hai Dong, Da Nang, Hai Dong, Khanh Hoa, and Dong \nNai. The power companies each maintain their own financial accounts and have a high degree \nof  managerial  and  financial  autonomy.  Other  key  entities  under  EVN  include  the  Power \nTransmission  Corporation  responsible \nfor  high-voltage  (500  kV  and  220  kV)  power \ntransmission; four power engineering consulting companies; the National Load Dispatch Center; \nand  subsidiaries  engaged \nin  non-core  activities  such  as  equipment  manufacturing, \ntelecommunications, real estate, and financial services.  \n \n3. \nViet Nam's far-reaching power sector reform program was launched with passage of the \nforward-looking Electricity Law in late 2004 and establishment of the new Electricity Regulatory \nAuthority  of  Viet  Nam  under  the  oversight  of  the  minister  of  industry.  The  country's  efforts  to \nrestructure  the  power  industry  and  develop  a  competitive  power  market  are  a  long-term \nproposition.  The  objectives  of  Viet  Nam's  power  sector  reform  are  to  maximize  efficiency \nthrough  competition  in  the  power  industry  and  to  expand  mobilization  of  investment  and \nmanagerial resources from outside the current state-operated system, in order to minimize costs \nand provide reliable, high-quality service to consumers. As described in the recently approved \nroad  map,  the  reform  process  is  expected  to  span  20  years,  and  proceed  through  (i)  a \npreparatory  phase  and  initial  \"trial\"  market,  followed  by  operation  of  a  competitive  market  for \nsupply  from  generators  to  a  single  buyer;  (ii)  a  second  phase  introducing  a  wholesale \ncompetitive  market  for  bulk  supply  to  distribution  companies  and  large  users;  and  (iii)  a  final \nphase introducing retail competition.  \n \nIn rural areas, local communities own and operate the low-voltage electricity distribution \n4. \nsystems  in  most  areas.  The  basic  approach  adopted  for  rural  electrification  in  Viet  Nam  has \nbeen  for  EVN's  power  companies  to  develop  the  medium-voltage  network,  and  for  local \ncommunities  to  develop  the  low-voltage  system  (although  EVN  has  undertaken  this  role  for \nabout  one-fifth  of  Viet  Nam's  communes).  Provincial  people\u2019s  committees  have  oversight  for \nrural  electrification  in  their  provinces,  and  provide  substantial  financial  support  for  the  local \nshare  of  investment.  Until  2004,  local  power  distribution  was  handled  by  informal  commune \nelectricity  groups  or  other  informal  entities  in  about  two-thirds  of  Viet  Nam's  electrified \ncommunes.  According  to  government  regulations,  however,  all  of  these  entities  are  now \nrequired to convert to formal legal entities, such as cooperatives or joint-stock companies. As of \nthe  end  of  2007,  39%  of  electrified  communes  were  supplied  by  EVN\u2019s  power  distribution \n\n \n\n\f30  \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nsubsidiaries,  54%  of  the  communes  by  cooperatives,  4%  of  the  communes  by  joint-stock \ncompanies, and only 3% by informal entities. \n \nB. \n\nPower Sector Performance \n\nPerformance of Viet Nam's power industry, managed primarily by EVN, has been quite \n5. \ngood  in  recent  years.  The  industry  has  kept  pace  during  the  last  decade  with  extraordinary \nincreases  in  demand,  maintaining  basic  service  for  its  customers  most  of  the  time.  EVN  has \nmaintained strong financial viability, while keeping costs to consumers quite low by international \nstandards.  Dramatic  increases  in  rural  access  and  steady  reductions  in  transmission  and \ndistribution losses are particularly notable achievements. The challenge for the future is to meet \nthe  rapidly  expanding  demands  of  the  economy  and  population,  with  minimum  disruption, \nhopefully  with  further  improvements  in  service  quality  and  without  unreasonable  increases  in \ncosts to consumers. \n \n6. \nElectricity generation in Viet Nam grew at an annual compounded rate of 13.7% during \n1995\u20132007,  and  since  2000  the  annual  growth  rate  has  exceeded  15%.  Electricity  generation \nhas  grown  threefold  2000  to  2008  to  reach  67  terawatt-hours  in  2004  compared  with  23.7 \nterawatt hours in 1999. The forecasted gross domestic product (GDP) growth exceeding 7% for \n2005\u20132010,  coupled  with  the  increasing  share  of  industrial  output  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  GDP,  will \nmaintain the growth momentum in electricity demand as shown Table A3. The reserve margin \nbecomes  very  low  during  the  dry  season  and  this  becomes  even  worse  in  northern  Viet  Nam \nwhere most of the generation capacity is hydro. \n \n\nTable A3: Historic Demand and Generation Data, 2005\u20132009 \n \n\nItem \nAnnual demand (gigawatt-hour) \nPeak demand in dry season (MW) \nGrowth in annual demand (%) \nInstalled capacity (MW) \nDry season available capacity (MW) \nReserve margin in dry season (%) \n\n2005 \n53,400 \n9,018 \n15.2 \n10,907 \n9,018 \n4 \n\n2006 \n59,800 \n10,157 \n11.9 \n11,714 \n10,243 \n1 \n\n2007 \n67,100 \n11,235 \n12.3 \n13,419 \n11,288 \n0 \n\n2008 \n75,400 \n12,782 \n12.3 \n16,383 \n13,346 \n  4 \n\n2009 \n84,600 \n14,286 \n12.3 \n19,084 \n17,173 \n20 \n\n       MW = megawatt. \n       Source: Ministry of Industry and Trade. \n \n7. \nAccess  to  electricity  in  rural  areas  increased  dramatically  during  1996\u20132004,  marking \none of the most successful recent rural electrification programs in the world. The number of rural \nhouseholds  with  access  to  electricity  increased  from  50.7%  in  1996  to  92%  in  2007.  Rural \nhousehold access rates are expected to increase in the next few years, although achievement \nof access among the final 5% of rural households will not be easy. The success of Viet Nam's \nprogram lies especially with the commitment of the government to rural electrification, and the \ndefinition  and  systematic  implementation  of  national  plans  as  a  matter  of  priority,  as  well  as \npublic investment and support to match community funds. \n \nTransmission and distribution losses in EVN's system have fallen steadily over the last \n8. \ndecade,  to  12.2%  in  2007.  This  is  not  unreasonable  for  a  system  such  as  Viet  Nam's  in  its \ncurrent  stage  of  development,  especially  given  the  heavy  role  of  low-voltage  residential \nconsumers, but further improvement is possible. In future, the Electricity Regulatory Authority of \nViet Nam must monitor efficiency indicators carefully against various benchmarks. Management \nof consumer accounts receivable has been exceptionally effective for a developing country, with \naccounts  receivable  in  2007  equivalent  to  only  about  17  days  of  sales.  Nontechnical  losses, \nincluding theft, are low compared with many countries. Widespread anecdotal evidence points \nto substantial improvements in the quality of electricity service over the last 10 years, with basic \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n     31 \n\nservice  for  most  customers  in  urban  or  peri-urban  areas  becoming  noticeably  more  reliable. \nHowever, systematic statistical monitoring of service interruptions and voltage drops, by service \narea and customer voltage, is lacking. \n \n9. \nThe tariff was D880 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in 2004 ($0.056/kWh). This is lower than the \naverage retail price today in most countries. The financial position of EVN has remained sound \nwith  unit  revenue  remaining  stable  during  the  last  few  years  through  2007,  covering  all  of  its \ndirect and indirect costs, but this revenue will not be sufficient for the future. Viet Nam's power \ntariff  is  sophisticated  in  structure,  with  rates  varying  by  voltage  level  and  consumer  type,  and \noffering  time-of-day  rates  for  major  consumers.  Urban  residential  rates  increase  progressively \nwith  increasing  consumption.  Rural  rates  are  cross-subsidized  by  other  consumers.  Both \naverage  urban  residential  rates  and  rural  residential  rates  are  modestly  cross-subsidized  by \nhigher rates for industry and commerce. \n \nC. \n\nMain Power Sector Issues \n\n1.  Meeting Power Demand \n\n10. \nThe  demand  for  electric  power  is  the  paramount  challenge  for  Viet  Nam's  power \nindustry.  Key  drivers  of  the  country's  economic  growth,  especially  manufacturing  and \ncommercial and service industries, are highly dependent upon power supply. Reliable electricity \nservice  is  essential  for  light  industries  to  remain  competitive  with  similar  industries  in \nneighboring countries. Electricity has also become an expected basic element in the livelihood \nof  most  people,  and  an  essential  part  of  increasing  standards  of  living.  The  power  shortages \nexperienced  in  the  dry  seasons  of  2005\u20132008  clearly  reinforced  a  priority  focus  on  meeting \ndemand  throughout  Viet  Nam's  power  industry,  with  highly  visible  national  attention.  The \ncapacity shortfall was estimated at some 1,500\u20132,000 MW during peak load. The shortage was \ncaused by the coincidence of severe drought conditions, reducing hydropower production, with \nan  extremely  thin  reserve  margin  in  the  overall  system  due  to  an  inability  to  develop  new \ncapacity over a short time to meet the higher than expected surges in power demand. \n \n11. \nViet  Nam\u2019s  overall  strategy  is  to  develop  existing  hydropower  resources  and  the  coal \nand gas plants, subject to the availability of domestic fuel resources, relatively quickly as both \nexploitable  domestic  coal  supplies  and  offshore  gas  supplies  have  supply  constraints.  The \navailability of domestic coal for the power industry is capped by domestic resource limits, given \ncurrent technology, and exports. Expanding the gas supply requires not only field and pipeline \ndevelopment, but also exploration and firming up of reserves. \n \n12. \nCoal-based  power  generation.  Assessment  of  the  best  balances  between  coal-  and \ngas-fired power is a key long-term planning issue, which is highly sensitive to future relative fuel \nprice  and  supply  expectations.  With  the  country's  coal  resources  limited,  the  government's \nstrategy is to strictly cap exports in favor of expanding domestic supply\u2014essentially to postpone \nthe expected eventual need for coal imports. Although high-quality anthracite obtains a premium \nprice  on  the  international  market,  domestic  coal  prices  for  power  generation  are  maintained \nbelow international prices. At current domestic coal prices, power generation from domestic coal \nis  significantly  less  expensive  than  combined-cycle,  gas-based  power  generation  at  capacity \nfactors exceeding 50%\u201360%. However, in economic terms, considered from the perspective of \nthe country as a whole, the value of domestic coal used for power generation is higher than its \ncurrent price, as it can be exported for more money, which would accrue to Viet Nam. However, \ndevelopment of large-scale power generation using Viet Nam's offshore natural gas resources \nrequires aligning the interests of a series of institutional participants, and major upfront financing \nand long-term commitments. On the gas exploration and development side, for the longer term, \nViet  Nam  must  maintain  an  attractive  framework  for  international  companies  to  continue \n\n \n\n\f32  \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nindependent  power  producers  (IPPs)  with \n\nexploration and firm up reserves, as much potential remains unexplored. Once the main options \nfor generation from domestic coal and gas have been exploited, thermal power generation using \nimported coal is expected to be the most cost-effective option. \n \n13. \nGas-based  power  generation.  PetroVietnam  Gas  Corporation,  PetroVietnam's \nsubsidiary  charged  with  natural  gas  operations,  is  a  central  entity,  holding  the  government's \nshares  in  field  production  facilities,  retaining  the  sole  rights  in  most  cases  to  buy  offshore gas \nand  sell  gas  to  end-users,  and  charged  with  gas  transmission  system  development  (although \nthis  may  be  in  cooperation  with  international  companies).  Upstream  gas  exploration  and \ndevelopment  is  undertaken  in  joint-venture  or  production-sharing  arrangements  between \nPetroVietnam  Gas  Corporation  and  international  petroleum  companies.  On  the  power \ngeneration  side,  development  of \ninvestors \nindependent  of  EVN  is  essential  for  a  large  portion  of  the  power  generation  capacity,  due  to \nEVN's  limited  financing capacity.  Finally,  the  government  (aside  from  its  ownership  position  of \nPetroVietnam  and  EVN)  must  play  key  roles:  sanctioning \nthe  specific  development \narrangements and providing some type of partial risk coverage for electricity sale arrangements \nto outside investors. \n \n14. \nHydropower  development.  With  goals  to  provide  almost  6,000  MW  over  the  medium \nterm,  Viet  Nam's  program  to  develop  its  many  medium-sized  hydro  sites  will  provide  a  core \ncontribution to the overall power development program in each of the three geographic regions. \nParticular  advantages  include  development  of  a  source  of  domestic  renewable  energy  quite \nseparate from international energy price and security risks, and benefits from associated water \ncontrol in many cases. Although economics vary by site, costs are generally quite competitive \nwith the thermal power options in Viet Nam. Viet Nam has made substantial progress during the \nlast  5  years  in  upgrading  its  reservoir  resettlement  and  environmental  assessment  practices. \nCurrent policies provide a reasonably well-structured set of legal and regulatory requirements. \nFinancial  commitments  for  resettlement  work  in  new  projects  are  now  substantial.  The  most \ndifficult issues, including restoration of livelihoods for ethnic minorities that may be affected by \nreservoir  development,  are  complex  in  every  country,  and  require  concerted  efforts  in \nconsultation with local residents throughout implementation. \n \n15. \nRenewable energy development. Viet Nam's renewable energy development program \nis growing, and can provide an increasing contribution in the future. Development has focused \nespecially on off-grid power supply in isolated areas, but small hydro facilities, in particular, can \nalso provide an important source of renewable energy to the grid. Wind power generation may \nalso provide a small contribution. Viet Nam plans to develop nuclear energy capacity over the \nlong  term.  Both  MOIT  and  EVN  have  developed  demand-side  management  and  energy \nefficiency  programs  in  recent  years.  Load  management  programs  and  energy  efficiency \npromotion and investment programs are proven means to address capacity constraints that are \nfar  less  expensive  than  new  capacity.  Such  efforts  can  yield  results  relatively  quickly  in  some \ncases, but do require sophisticated institutional development, which has proved challenging in \nmost countries. \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancing the Investment \n\n16. \nAnnual power sector investment requirements to meet power demand during 2005\u20132010 \nare  expected  to  be  more  than  $3  billion.  The  country  seeks  to  mobilize  investment  through  a \nvariety  of  vehicles,  from  both  domestic  and  foreign  sources,  to  meet  this  challenge.  The  two \nbasic categories are EVN's contribution to investment from its own resources and different types \nof  borrowing,  and  independent  investment,  primarily  by  IPPs.  Financing  of  new  investment \nthrough  the  current  EVN  system,  including  subentities,  is  essential  for  key  parts  of  the \nconstruction  effort,  including  the  network,  most  of  the  hydropower  program,  and  selected \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n     33 \n\nelements  in  the  thermal  power  program.  EVN  exhibited  strong  financial  performance  during \n2002\u20132007, allowing a substantial self-financing contribution to the investment program.  \n \n17.  With increased costs stemming in part from power shortages, and the sharp increases in \ninvestment  requirements,  self-financing  ratios  will  plummet  unless  EVN's  unit  sales  revenue \nincreases substantially. The corporation is proceeding to borrow from a wide variety of sources, \nincluding  by  issuing  bonds.  However,  EVN  will  reach  borrowing  limits  very  quickly,  unless \nrevenues are increased (or a major injection of equity is made, which is unlikely). Overextension \nof borrowing above internationally recognized ratios would be highly imprudent, as maintenance \nof  EVN's  creditworthiness  is  essential  for  any  sustainable  investment  mobilization  effort. \nAverage  retail  power  prices  must  be  increased  quickly  to  cover  greater  costs  but  also, \nespecially,  to  expand  revenues  for  financing  the  massive  power  sector  expansion.  Ultimately, \nconsumers  must  contribute  to  the  financing  of  the  new  capacity  to  meet  their  needs.  Power \nprices  in  Viet  Nam\u2014including  industrial  tariffs,  and  especially  in  the  residential  sector\u2014are \nrelatively low by international standards. \n \n18. \nClearly,  dramatic  increases  in  power  sector  investment  from  outside  EVN  will  be \nrequired to meet overall sector investment requirements. Viet Nam is pursuing a wide range of \nIPP  arrangements  in  its  efforts  to  meet  the  huge  and  rapid  increases  in  power  demand.  IPP \narrangements  for  new  power  plants  include  (i)  build-operate-transfer  or  build-operate-own \nventures  wholly  owned  by  other  public-owned  Vietnamese  entities;  (ii)  joint-venture  build-\noperate-transfer  or  build-operate-own  arrangements,  involving  EVN  investment  with  other \nparticipants (local public or foreign); and (iii) build-operate-transfer arrangements wholly owned \nby foreign parties, either public or private. In addition, new joint-stock company IPPs are being \ncreated  from  EVN's  partial  divestiture  of  existing  power  plants.  In  the  case  of  Viet  Nam,  few \npublic  entities  have  the  resources  and  interest  to  make  major  power  generation  investments, \nwhich  are,  for  the  most  part,  limited  to  the  state-owned  fuel  supply  companies  or  large \nconstruction companies. \n\n \n\n\f34  \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\n \n\nDEVELOPMENT PARTNER COORDINATION \n\n1. \nSix  development  partners  are  particularly  active  in  supporting  the  power  sector  in  Viet \nNam:  The  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  Developpement  (AFD);  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB), \nthe  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA);  the  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW); \nthe Swedish International Cooperation Agency (SIDA); and the World Bank group (WB);  \n \n2. \nAgence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  Developpement  (AFD).The  AFD  has  currently  one  on-going \nproject  loan  in  the  power  sector:  co-financier  with  ADB  of  the  loan  2128-VIE  Northern  Power \nTransmission Sector Project, and approved $100 million non \u2013 sovereign loan for the 520 MW \nHoi Quang hydropower project in 2009.

In addition the AFD has several technical assistances, \none financing an adviser to the Electricity Regulatory Agency of Viet Nam (ERAV); another one \non the development of an energy efficiency law for the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT). \n \n3. \nJapan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA).  Since  1993,  JICA  has  committed \napproximately  $2.4  billion  to  the  power  sector,  mainly  for  power  generation,  and  plans  to \ncontinue to finance future power plants. JICA is also supporting MOIT in preparing Master Plan \nfor  Energy  Conservation  and  Effective  Use  as  well  as  the  Waste  Heat  Recovery  But  Son \nCement Plant in Ha Nam Province. \n \nSwedish  International  Cooperation  Agency  (SIDA).  Since  1995,  SIDA  has  committed \n4. \nabout  SKr  400  million  mainly  for  the  construction  of  hydropower  plant  and  development  of \ndistribution system in Central area and also upgrading some rural grids. Sida has also financed \nthe recently equitized Vinh Son/Song Hinh hydropower cascade. \n \n5. \nThe World Bank (WB). Since 1995, the WB has committed over than $1.5 billion in the \npower  sector  mainly  to  expand  the  transmission  and  distribution  system,  rural  electrification \nprogram,  power  sector  reform,  energy  efficiency,  and  recently \nto  renewable  energy \ndevelopment.  The  WB  recently  financed  $330  million  to  the  260MW  Trung  Son  hydropower \nproject.  The  WB  is  also  preparing  for  Development  Policy  Loan  ($450  \u2013  600  million)  to  EVN \nfocusing on general market and power sector reform. \n   \nThe  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW)  is  approving  a  \u20ac120  million  loan  in  2009  for \n6. \nthe rehabilitation and the upgrade of the rural distribution grids that EVN took over from 5,000 \ncommunes  in  2008  and  2009.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nViet  Nam  has  been  one  of  the  fastest  growing  economies  in  the  Asia  for  the  last  two  decades,  with  real  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth averaging 8.0% per annum during 2003\u20132007. Per capita GDP increased to $817 in 2007 compared \nwith  $441  in  2002.  Although  the  country  has  suffered  from  high  inflation  due  to  high  energy  and  food  prices  and  supply \nbottlenecks, the long-term growth prospects remain positive. Viet Nam has achieved remarkable progress in socioeconomic \ndevelopment  since  1993.  The  reduction  in  the  national  poverty  rate  from  58%  in  1993  to  less  than  20%  by  2007  is \nunprecedented.  However,  poverty  remains  at  more  than  50%  in  northern  mountain  provinces  inhabited  by  ethnic  minority \ncommunities. The lack of infrastructure facilities and nonfarm income-generation activities have contributed to the persistent \npoverty  in  these  isolated  areas. The  country  business  operation  plana   of the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  Viet  Nam \nfocuses  on  supporting  pro-poor  economic  growth,  social  equity  and  balanced  development,  and  sustainable  environment \nmanagement. One of the key challenges for poverty reduction in Viet Nam\u2019s Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP)b is to \nprovide  the  basic  services  and  infrastructure  needed  to  ensure  the  access  to  markets  needed  to  attract  private  investment \nand create jobs. ADB\u2019s country strategy to help the government reduce poverty by implementing SEDP targets is particularly \nfocused on promoting pro-poor economic growth. Provision of basic infrastructure is one of the prerequisites.  \n \nThe potential for electricity to facilitate communication, income generation, and economic growth is part of the government\u2019s \npoverty reduction strategy. Currently, 91.5% of households in Viet Nam are connected to the national power grid system, and \nthe government plans to extend the system to connect about 96% of villages. Those remaining unconnected are communes \nin  remote  mountain,  central,  and  southern  provinces,  often  inhabited  by  ethnic  minorities  with  40%\u201370%  of  the  population \nliving below the national poverty line. The project contributes to the government\u2019s objective of connecting electricity to 100% \nof households by 2012. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues \n Viet  Nam  has  made  significant  progress  in  providing  electricity  services  to  the  population.  This  is  a  key  objective  in  the \ngovernment\u2019s strategy to reduce poverty and vulnerability. The share of households with access to electricity increased from \n49% in 1992 to 86% in 2002 and nearly 94% in 2008. The consumption of electricity increased during 1995\u20132008 from 156 \nkilowatt-hours (kWh) per household per month to about 800 kWh. However, due to Viet Nam's rapid economic growth during \nthe last two decades since 1988 with a 16% power demand growth all over the country, Viet Nam Electricity (EVN) is facing \nshortage of power generation and has had to introduce load shedding in both rural and urban areas. For example, in 2008, \nload  shedding  was  introduced  in  large  cities  such  as  Hanoi  and  Ho  Chi  Minh  City,  and  the  residential  sector  and  small \nconsumers  were the first to experience interrupted supply  as the government decided to give priority to the industry  sector. \nSuch policy had negative impacts on the poorest households who were running small businesses.  \n \nBefore March 2009, the rural grids were operated by rural distribution cooperatives with limited resources and low technical \nskills,  leading  to  high  technical  and  commercial  losses,  resulting  in  high  tariffs  for  consumers.  Since  March  2009,  the \ngovernment decided that all these inefficient grids should be operated and maintained by EVN. This includes power grids of \nabout 5,000 communes and concerns about 7 million consumers. To decrease technical and commercial losses in such grids, \nas well as to increase their reliability, EVN needs to make important investment in the medium- and low-voltage grids. For the \neconomic growth of Viet Nam and the development of the industry sector, and due to the increased power demand from the \nresidential  sector,  EVN  needs  to  invest  in  new  power  generation.  Due  to  the  large  investment  required,  the  government \ndecided  that,  in  addition  to  the  investment  made  by  EVN,  it  would  call  for  private  investors  to  build  additional  generation \ncapacity. Due to the development of this additional generation, EVN also needs to reinforce its transmission and distribution \nsystem in order to supply power to the end user consumer with an acceptable degree of quality and reliability as well as at a \nreasonable price, i.e., by limiting technical losses to an acceptable level. The proposed project will thus address these issues \nby  financing  the  reinforcement  of  the  500  kilovolt  (kV),  220  kV,  and  110  kV  transmission  systems  and  the  rehabilitation  of \nmedium- and low-voltage grids in urban and rural areas. To summarize, a reliable source and good quality electricity supply is \nvery  important  for  industrial  growth,  commerce,  the  service  sector,  and  poverty  reduction.  Employment  generated  through \nindustry, commerce, and services will offer a significant opportunity to many households from rural areas. \n \n\n \n\n\f38  \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\n \n2. Design Features    \nThe project will not have direct poverty reduction impact. Given the nature of the project there is no scope for pro-poor design. \n \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n \nThe  social  assessment  in  the  project  areas  show  that  electricity  problems,  shortage  of  electricity,  unreliable  power  voltage, \nand power cuts have implications for industry, business, home industry, health, and education facilities. The following are the \nkey findings of the social analysis. \n \nBefore 2005, all households in the six subproject areas had access to electricity. The management of electricity and supply \nwas under the control of communes and wards. This led to different pricing in different areas. Before that time, the electricity \ncooperatives were responsible for electricity at the commune level and sold electricity at a high price (D700\u2013D1,000 per kWh \nfor households, and D1,500\u2013D2,000 for small private enterprises), but the power supply was unreliable and of low quality. The \nelectricity price in urban areas was cheaper than in rural areas. This was due to (i) a high level of electric power leakage in \nrural areas, and to compensate for this leak, rural households often had to bear the increased electricity price; and (ii) poor \nmanagement  and  corruption  at  commune  and  ward  level.  Nowadays,  households  in  the  subproject  areas  have  access  to \nelectricity  at  the  government  price.  However,  the  degraded  power  transmission  networks  resulted  in  poor  electricity  quality \nand unstable supply. This has a significant impact on households and small-scale businesses because the required amount of \nelectricity is not always provided. The poor quality of supply that leads to voltage drop or sometimes over-voltage, including \npower cuts, are not favorable to the development of small business especially in rural areas. High losses are also contributing \nto higher cost of electricity, despite the existing lifeline tariff that the government introduced in favor of smaller consumers. \n \nViet  Nam  is  shifting  away  from  a  centrally  planned  economy  to  a  more  market-oriented  economy.  Industries,  services,  and \nbusinesses are booming. In the subproject areas, there are many small businesses such as restaurants, cafes, karaoke bars, \nand  food  processing  plants,  and  these  business  activities  are  a  major  source  of  income  for  local  entrepreneurs.  However, \nthese  businesses  require  large  amounts  of  reliable  and  stable  power.  Power  cuts  and  fluctuating  voltage  has  significant \nnegative  impact  on  local  businesses.  For  example,  in  Nam  Sach  district,  a  food  processing  plant  (soy  curd)  can  lose  D5 \nmillion a night due to power cuts. Some entrepreneurs use their own generators for their businesses but most of them does \nnot have back up generators and are suffering of production losses. Farmers use electric water pumps for irrigation, but due \nto unstable  and insufficient power supply they sometimes  use diesel-powered  water  pumps  which cost three times  more to \nrun. Big enterprises, such as in the shrimp industry, can lose several thousand dollars a day due to power cuts. Workers can \nalso lose income due to power cuts. In the subproject areas there are 21 industrial zones in food processing, shipping, coal \nexploitation,  garment  industries,  etc.  Although  these  industrial  sites  have  private  power  lines,  due  to  overloading  and  old \ncables there are power cuts 5\u20137 days a month, and this affects the operation of the industries. Some of these big industries \nhave to buy high-volume power generators, and in some cases garment factories have to replace automatic machines  with \nmanual ones.  \n \nElectrical  power  supply  is  usually  cut  off  during  the  hot  periods  in  summer.  In  addition,  electricity  quality  is  not  stable  and \nreliable. Due to inadequate electric supply, domestic equipment such as TVs, cooking stoves, and electric lamps can not be \noperated. Because of power cuts and insufficient power, clean  water factories in some communes and wards in Hai Duong \nprovince  are  not  working;  as  a  result,  80%  of  households  do  not  have  clean  water.  Women  bear  the  burden  of  electricity \nproblems; instead of using electricity for cooking, they have to use firewood, straw, charcoal, or dried leaves. The commune \nleaders advised that during power cuts around 70%\u201380% of the population have no fresh water, and water must be carried by \nshoulder poles from public wells\u2014a burden which is generally taken up by women. \n \nIn  recent  years,  with  the  economic  development  the  health  facilities  have  been  equipped  with  modern  amenities.  The \ninsufficient electrical power supply causes difficulties in medical practices such as medical checks, surgery, and preservation \nof medicine, etc. In some project areas, such as Tien Lang, Hai Phong, due to power cuts for 7\u201310 days in a month, diesel \ngenerators were bought, which increases the cost of providing medical services. Despite government attempts to invest more \non human resources, medications, and facilities in hospitals, medical centers, and clinics in rural areas, rural people still have \ngo to provincial hospitals because of poor power supply in the rural health centers. This results in more pressure on hospitals \nand health facilities at the provincial level. The power cuts in schools and colleges disturb laboratory  work for the students, \nand the teaching process, and affect the quality of learning. At an individual level, low quality of power supply introduces some \nextra  costs  for  middle-income  consumers  as  the  life  span  of  electric  appliances  is  reduced.  The  investments  are  for \nconstruction of new 220 kV and 110 kV substations and upgrading and rehabilitating the rural grid network and will facilitate \nadequate  and  reliable  electricity  supply  for  individual  customers,  industries,  businesses,  public  facilities,  etc.  Stable  power \nsupply  will  play  a  very  important  role  in  small  businesses.  The  supply  of  adequate  and  reliable  electricity  will  increase \nbusiness opportunities for manufacturing and hotels, and will provide employment opportunities. The negative impact of the \nproject relates to resettlement activities such as land acquisition. The resettlement plan includes mitigation measures for the \naffected people. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n39 \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nStakeholders were consulted in the subproject locations during the preparation of the resettlement plan. In addition to sample \nsurvey, interviews were held with individuals and focus group meetings with key stakeholders (men and women) from different \noccupational groups such as small business owners, education and health care providers, local administration, and regional \ndevelopment authorities.  \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\n \n1.  Key Issues \nThe  lack  of  reliable  electricity  affects  women's  work  in  industry,  food  processing  plants, and  cash-crop  farming.  Power  cuts \nand fluctuation of voltage affects use of household equipment and increases the drudgery of women's work. Power cuts and \nvoltage shortages can affect work for women entrepreneurs in terms of profit and their daily schedule. In the subproject areas \nwomen  are  mainly  involved  in  agricultural  production  and  small-scale  trade.  Women  are  also  involved  in  education,  public \nservices, and health care services, and many younger women are working in industrial parks located in the subproject areas. \nWomen  are  also  engaged  in  small  and  medium-sized  private  enterprises,  and  restaurants  located  in  the  communes.  Most \nyoung women in Ninh Thuy commune (Ninh Thuy 110 kV substation and transmission line subproject) are involved in sea fish \nand  shrimp  processing  factories.  The  older  women  take  part  in  salt  making  and  managing  small  businesses.  These  food \nprocessing  industries  and  businesses  depend  on  electricity.  The  industrial  parks  which  employ  many  women  workers  from \nlocal communities are heavily reliant on reliable power supply. Sea fish and shrimp processing plants mostly engage women \nworkers. Electricity power cuts have a direct impact on women\u2019s income because they are not paid a fixed rate but their pay is \nbased  on  production.  For  plantations  of  vegetables  and  flowers  women  use  electric  water  pumps  due  to  the  low  cost  of \nelectricity.  During  power  cuts  water  has  to  be  carried  by  shoulder  poles  from  wells\u2014a  burden  which  is  mainly  taken  up  by \nwomen. \n \nElectric  rice  cookers  are  used  by  80%\u201390%  of  farmer  households  in  five  of  six  subproject  areas.  In  the  Duc  Trong  220  kV \nsubstation area, about 57.5% of ethnic minority households (Phu Hoi commune) have electric rice cookers. When there are \npower cuts, they have to use firewood, straw, charcoal, or dried leaves for cooking, which is time-consuming. The time spent \nin cooking also impacts on women's child care responsibilities.  \n \nReliable  electricity  would  increase  income  and  productivity  of  women  workers  in  the  industry  and  food  processing  plants. \nAccess to quality electricity would allow women to investment in and use household appliances, and this would reduce their \nwork.  The  improvement  of  voltage  shortage  and  less  frequent  power  cuts  would  increase  business  turnover  for  women \nentrepreneurs. \n \n\n  Gender plan      \n\n2.    Key  Actions.

The  project  consists  of  86  subprojects  located  in  30  different \nprovinces. These subprojects can be categorized into seven different technical groups: (i) new \nair-insulated  substations,  (ii)  extension  of  existing  air-insulated  substations,  (iii)  new  gas-\ninsulated substations (GIS), (iv) extension of existing GIS, (v) new transmission overhead lines, \n(vi) new underground cables, and (vii) rehabilitation of rural and urban medium- and low-voltage \ngrids. The subprojects will be implemented by 11 subsidiaries of Viet Nam Electricity (EVN).  \n \n2. \nThe resettlement plans will only apply for projects categorized in groups (i), (iii), and (v). \nprojects from groups (ii), (iv), (vi), and (vii) will not imply land acquisition so no resettlement is \nanticipated. Table A6.2 presents the results of the preliminary assessment that has been carried \nout  and  provides  the  involuntary  resettlement  categorization  and  procedure  requirements  for \neach of the proposed subprojects.  \n \n3. \nThere  are  41  subprojects  that  involve  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Due  diligence \nwas conducted on seven subprojects where land acquisition has already been completed or is \nongoing. For the other 34 subprojects that imply resettlement, short resettlement plans will have \nto be prepared to address land acquisition and resettlement issues that will only be determined \nafter  the  final  design  and  detailed  measurement  survey  has  been  carried  out.  Therefore,  a \nresettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  to  provide  guidance  during  their  preparation  and \nimplementation. A full resettlement framework is provided in Supplementary Appendix A.    \n \n4. \nProject resettlement and ethnic minorities principles. The payment for land and non-\nland  assets  will  follow  the  principle  of  replacement  cost.  Assistance  to  severely  affected  and \nvulnerable  households will  be  provided  in  cash  or  in  kind. For  households  who  experienced  a \ndecline in income based on due diligence findings or whose income source may be affected or \nwill  be  at  risk  once  the  land  is  acquired,  suitable  livelihood  development  programs  will  be \ndesigned  and  implemented  in  consultation  with  households  during  implementation.  Ethnic \nminority Kin people living in the project area are integrated into Vietnamese society. Of the 41 \nsubprojects, three future subprojects are expected to acquire land owned by ethnic minorities; \nno  households  will  be  relocated.  Resettlement  plans  affecting  ethnic  minority  people  shall \ninclude ethnic minority specific actions. \n \n5. \nThe resettlement framework will include the following gender-related specific actions: (i) \na separate consultation meeting will be held to disclose the resettlement plan, (ii) replacement \nland will be registered in the names of both husband and wife in cases where land acquisition \nhas  taken  place,  (iii)  compensation  money  will  be  paid  to  both  husband  and  wife,  and  (iv) \nwomen will be consulted in planning and training for income restoration program. \n \n6. \nConsultation,  disclosure,  and  grievance. Consultations with the affected households \nwill be carried out during the preparation of the resettlement plan. These activities will continue \nduring  implementation  of  the  short  resettlement  plans  for  category  B  subprojects.  Key \ninformation  of  resettlement  plans  will  have  to  be  disclosed  to  the  affected  households  prior  to \nappraisal  of  the  concerned  subprojects.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  is  to  be  established \nand will be handled through mediation aimed at achieving consensus. Any complaint will pass \nthrough three stages before it can be elevated to a court of law as a last resort. \n \n7. \nImplementation  arrangements.  The  executing  agency  is  EVN.  The  implementing \nagencies for the project are 11 participating subsidiaries of EVN. The overall coordination and \nadministration  of  the  project,  including  all  those  connected  to  the  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, is under the responsibility of the subsidiaries or their head office (for the National \nPower  Transmission  Corporation  [NPT]).  Each  power  company  or  office  has  its  own \n\n \n\n\f42  \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n\nenvironment  and  social  unit.  As  mandated  by  Decree  84/2007/CP  on  the  land  acquisition  for \nnational security and public interests, development purposes, land acquisition will be carried out \nby the district resettlement committee, chaired by the chair or vice chair of the district people\u2019s \ncommittee. Therefore, the NPT and power companies will have to work closely with the district \nresettlement committees. \n \n8. \nMonitoring.  The  NPT  and  the  power  companies  will  serve  as  the  project\u2019s  internal \nmonitoring  body  for  their  respective  subprojects.  The  result  of  internal  monitoring  will  be \nincluded  as a  part  of  monthly  progress  reports  that the  power companies and NPT  will have  to \nsubmit  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  through  the  EVN  steering  committee.  In  addition, \nquarterly independent monitoring reports on the implementation of the resettlement plans will have \nto be submitted to ADB, starting from the commencement of resettlement plan preparation, which \ncoincides with the conduct of the detailed measurement survey and other resettlement activities. \nSocial  monitoring  reports  will  be  made  available  to  the  affected  households  and  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB for posting on ADB\u2019s website. EVN will recruit an external monitor agency to \ncarry out the monitoring and evaluation tasks.  \n \n9. \nResettlement  plan  budget.  The  budget  for  all  packages  cover  compensation  costs, \nallowances,  relocation  and  rehabilitation  measures,  administration  costs,  and  contingency. \nIndependent  appraisal  agencies  will  be  engaged  by  each  of  the  power  companies  and  NPT  in \norder to assess the current market rates of the land and non-land assets. The power companies \nand  NPT  will  ensure  the  timely  provision  of  counterpart  funds  for  covering  any  unforeseen \nobligations  in  excess  of  the  resettlement  budget  estimates  in  order  to  satisfy  resettlement \nrequirements and objectives.    \n \n10. \nImplementation  schedule.  All  resettlement  activities  will  be  coordinated  with  the  civil \nworks  schedule.  Land  acquisition  and  relocation  of  affected  households  cannot  commence \nunless  the updated  resettlement  plan  has  been  reviewed  and  approved  by  ADB.  EVN  will  not \nallow  construction  activities  in  specific  sites  until  all  resettlement  activities  have  been \nsatisfactorily  completed,  agreed  rehabilitation  assistance  is  in  place,  and  the  specific  sites  are \nfree of all encumbrances. \n \n\nTable A6.1: Indicative Schedule of Resettlement Activities \n \n\nActivities \nRP Preparation \nADB approval of draft RP  \nRP

\ninternal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  and  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR).  Feasibility  studies \nunder this guarantee program are prepared by National Power Transmission Corporation (NPT) \nand other power companies (subsidiaries of Viet Nam Electricity [EVN]) in accordance with the \ngovernment  regulation.  The  government  decree1 provides  the  guideline  for  the  preparation  of \nthose feasibility studies. This appendix explains the government guidelines and criteria for the \nfeasibility study of subprojects, and shows economic assessment, prepared by EVN staff, of the \n220  kilovolt  (kV)  Trang  Bang\u2013Tay  Ninh  transmission  line  subproject  as  a  case  model  for  this \nguarantee  program.  For  consistency  in  undertaking  such  analysis  for  the  other  subprojects,  a \nmethodology has been developed for the use of EVN's staff and is provided as Supplementary \nAppendix I. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nfeasibility study reports of subprojects, which cover following five categories: \n \n\nIn  accordance  with  a  government  decree  No.12/2009,  EVN  subsidiaries  prepare \n\nSubproject Economic and Financial Criteria \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\ninvestment necessity and objective; \nproject size, scope, construction area, work items, technologies, and capacity; \nimplementation solutions, including project management, general plan on ground \nclearance and resettlement, architectural design plan, and project operation and \nlabor; \nassessment of environmental impacts; and \nproject investment plan, including project cost estimates. \n\n \n3. \nProject  investment  plans  include  total  cost  estimate,  capital  arrangement  capacity, \ncapital  sources  and  the  capacity  to  allocate  capital  according  to  the  implementation  schedule, \nthe  capital  repayment  plan,  and  analysis  and  assessment  of  the  project's  economic,  financial, \nand social benefits. According to this guidance, investment costs and economic assessment of \nthe Tran Bang\u2013Tay Ninh transmission line were prepared by EVN staff. \n \nC. \n\nEconomic Costs and Benefits for Tran Bang\u2013Tay Ninh Transmission Line \nSubproject \n\n \n4. \nThe  economics  of  the  subproject  are  analyzed  based  on  comparing  the  cost  and \nbenefits  of  without  and  with  the  subproject.  The  project  costs  of  Tran  Bang\u2013Tay  Ninh \ntransmission  line  is  estimated  at  $25.52  million.  This  cost  covers  a  42  kilometer  220  kV \ntransmission line, equipment, project management cost, and physical contingencies. In addition, \noperation and maintenance cost is 2% of the investment. The EIRR was calculated on the basis \nof the base costs and physical contingencies. \n \n5. \nThe economic benefits of the subproject are estimated by incremental sale as a result of \nthis subproject, reduction of losses, and reduction of unserved energy. The economic benefits \n\n                                                 \n1   Decree No.12/2009/ND-CP of February 12 2009 on management of investment projects on the construction of \n\nworks. \n\n \n\n\f48  \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\nwere  measured  by  the  incremental  sales  from  the  new  capacity  of  the  distribution  system. \nIncremental  sales  in  kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  were  calculated  by  subproject  component.  The \neconomic benefits from incremental sales were computed from the volume of incremental sales \nfrom  the  projects  multiplied  by  the  value  of  kilowatt-hours  sale  attributable  to  this  project \n($0.061/kWh).  The  benefit  resulting  from  loss  reduction  and  reduction  of  unserved  energy  are \nestimated  based  on  the  volume  of  reduction  multiplied  by  the  value  of  kilowatt-hours  lost \n($0.0651/kWh) or value of kilowatt-hours of unserved energy ($0.65/kWh).

The operation and maintenance cost is assumed to be 2.0% of the capital cost. \nThe FIRR calculation is in Table A11.2. \n \n\n \n\n\fTable A7.2: FIRR Calculation \n(D '000) \n \n Purchase \ncost  \n  \n\n Outflow  \n\n O&M \ncost  \n  \n\n Energy \nbought  \n (Gwh)  \n\n \nCapex  \n  \n28,981  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\u2014   \n\nYear \n  \n2009-2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017- \n2040 \n  \n( ) = negative, Capex = capital expenditures, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Viet Nam Electricity. \n\n                \u2014   \n             464  \n             608  \n             833  \n          1,058  \n          1,284  \n          1,509  \n\n            16,663 \n            21,817 \n             29,902 \n             37,992 \n             46,085 \n            54,181 \n\n  \n              28,981 \n              17,242 \n              22,396 \n              30,482 \n              38,571 \n              46,664 \n              54,760 \n\n  \n   580  \n   580  \n   580  \n   580  \n   580  \n   580  \n\n 61,284-62,281 \n  \n\n 61,863-62,861 \n  \n\n 1,735-1,707  \n  \n\n   580  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n49 \n\n Inflow  \n\n Net cashflow \n\n Energy \nsold  \n ( Gwh )  \n\n  \n\n\u2014   \n\n\u2014   \n473   19,384  \n613   25,133  \n   832   34,128  \n      1,052   43,123  \n      1,271   52,118  \n       1,490   61,113  \n\n  \n        (28,981) \n            2,142 \n            2,736 \n            3,646 \n            4,551 \n            5,453 \n            6,352 \n\n       1,710   70,108  \n FIRR  \n  \n\n 8,244-7,246 \n17.5% \n\nConclusion \n\n \n9. \nThe FIRR of the project after tax is 17.5%, which exceeds the weighted average cost of \ncapital (WACC) of 10.45% (internal rate of borrowing estimated by EVN). The net present value \nof the after-tax cash flows, when discounted at the WACC, is D21.3 million. \n \nE. \n \n10. \nThe  EIRR  of  the  project  is  34%.  The  net  present  value  when  discounted  at  112%  is \n$44.45 million. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the EIRR will exceed the benchmark value of \n12%  under  the  event  of  cost  overrun  of  10%  and  20%.  Given  the  overall  objectives  of  the \nsubproject, the economic performance is deemed acceptable, and the subproject is considered \neconomically viable and sustainable. \n \n11. \nThe  FIRR  is  17.5%,  compared  with  the  project  WACC  of  10.45%.  Sensitivity  analysis \nindicates that the FIRR will exceed the WACC under the event of cost overrun of 10% and 20%. \nGiven the overall objectives of the subproject, the financial performance is deemed acceptable, \nand the subproject is considered financially viable and sustainable. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTANTS \n\n \n\n1. \nThe implementation supervision consultant will supervise on an intermittent and random \nbasis  the  procurement  and  the  implementation  of  construction  works  to  ensure  completion  of \nthe project in accordance with the contract provisions and the approved design and compliance \nwith the environmental and social safeguards requirements.
