THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Flood  Management  in  Selected  River  Basins  Sector \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The project will support the Government of Indonesia and river-based communities in \nbetter managing and mitigating flood risks.2 The project has been designed as a sector loan to \nsupport the implementation of the Strategic Plan for Water Resources, 2015\u20132019 (SPWR) of \nthe Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MPWH).3 The SPWR includes policy measures and \npriority investments in 63 river basin territories (RBTs) in Indonesia. The project will finance \nsubprojects in the Cidanau\u2013Ciujung\u2013Cidurian (Banten province) and Ambon\u2013Seram (Maluku \nprovince) RBTs. Project interventions will (i) enhance hydrometeorological data and analysis, \nmanagement, and institutional coordination for managing flood risks; (ii) upgrade and develop \nflood protection infrastructure; (iii) improve watershed conditions to moderate runoff peaks and \nsoil erosion; and (iv) prepare communities to manage floods. The project will promote effective \nflood risk management (FRM) by coupling infrastructure investment with supporting software \nmeasures. It will contribute to the achievement of the government\u2019s National Medium Term \nDevelopment Plan, 2015\u20132019 (RPJMN) sector target to reduce the magnitude of economic \nand social damage due to floods.4  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Indonesia is highly prone to flooding due to its climate and topography.5 Flooding, which \noccurs annually in most of the country, has been increasing in frequency, causing as much as \n$430 million in economic losses per year.6 During 2003\u20132015 average annual flood impacts \nhave included: 1.58 million people per year affected; 223,000 homes completely or partially \ndamaged; and 168,000 hectares (ha) of crops inundated.7 The floods sever vital transport \narteries and often disrupt access to ports and airports, restricting the transfer of goods and \nservices. In 2013, Ciujung river flooding affected 19,674 households, displaced 50,527 people, \nand disrupted traffic along the Jakarta\u2013Merak toll road that connects Java to Sumatra island.8 \nDespite its location in a drier region, in 2013 Ambon suffered from flash floods resulting in the \ndestruction of 59 homes and damage to 45 others; and 10 deaths, 5 missing persons, and \n7,212 displaced people (footnote 8). \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for Preparing Flood \nManagement in Selected River Basins (Phase II) (TA 7364). \n3  Government of Indonesia, MPWH. 2015. Rencana Strategis Sumber Daya Air, 2015\u20132019. Jakarta. The plan calls \nfor a reduction by 200,000 hectares (ha) of the flooded area nationwide by 2019. \n4  Government of Indonesia, Ministry of National Development Planning, National Development Planning Agency \n(BAPPENAS). 2014. Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah Nasional, 2015\u20132019. Jakarta. \n5  Indonesia experiences two main types of flooding. Long-lasting river floods, which are often influenced by tides, \ngenerally occur in large islands with large river basins that have steep slopes and long, flat, and low floodplains \n(e.g., Irian, Java, Kalimantan, or Sumatra). Flash floods typically inundate small islands in eastern Indonesia that \nhave small and steep mountainous river basins. \n6  Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters - CRED.

Deforestation and inappropriate agricultural \npractices\u2014which result in erosion and increased sediment loads in waterways9\u2014 are reducing \nthe capacity of rivers to accommodate higher peak flows caused by intense rainfall. Expanding \npopulation  combined  with  inadequate  spatial  planning  and  land  management  has  led  to \nsubstantial development in flood-prone areas, escalating flood damage to life and property. \nUrbanization,  and  particularly  associated  road  construction  and  surfacing,  reduces  the \nvegetated area that would normally absorb rainwater, resulting in greater peak flood flows.10 \nThe government agencies\u2019 ability to optimize flood management capacity and effectiveness is \nlimited  by  weak  hydrological  data  acquisition and  management,  and flood forecasting  and \nclimate  risk  modeling;  and  the  lack  of  coordinated  decision-making  among  government \nagencies. Insufficient investment in and neglected operation and maintenance (O&M) of flood \nprotection  infrastructure  accentuate  the  adverse  impacts  of  floods.11 In  the  absence  of \nappropriate awareness and preparedness, communities remain highly vulnerable to and at \ngreater risk of loss of life and assets from more frequent and intense floods. \n \n5.  Climate change impacts include the increasing frequency of intense rainfall and rising \nsea levels, and are expected to further exacerbate flood risk.12 The impacts of intense and \nfrequent flood events combined with the lack of economic and social capital to manage flood \nrisks further limit the ability of many river-based communities to escape poverty. \n \n6.  Water security is a central pillar of the RPJMN, which promotes FRM to reduce flood \ndamage.13 Indonesia adopted the integrated water resource management (IWRM) approach, \nwhich is being promoted through (i) the establishment of river basin management organizations \n(RBOs),14 and (ii) the formulation of strategic basin plans as a prerequisite to basin development \nplans (Rencanas). The Rencanas form the basis for the public investment in water resource \nmanagement with a horizon of 20 years, including flood management. Implementation of IWRM \nand participatory river basin management is still hampered by inadequate planning, investment, \ncapacity, and coordination. The RBTs targeted by the project are not an exception. There is a \ngrowing need to integrate structural and nonstructural measures to create a holistic response to \nthe flood challenge. \n \n7.  The project will support implementation of part of the SPWR calling for a $3.06 billion \ninvestment in flood management.15 The Cidanau\u2013Ciujung\u2013Cidurian RBT (which is affected by \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2016.

Report submitted to the World Bank. http://citarum.org \n/citarum-knowledge/arsip-dokumen/dokumen-perencanaan/540-java-water-resources-strategy-study/file.html.  The \nstudy estimates that, at current trends, the urbanized area in Java will double within 30 years. \n11 Requirements to finance flood protection infrastructure for 2015\u20132019 are estimated at $74.6 million in the \nCidanau\u2013Ciujung\u2013Cidurian RBT and $102.7 million in the Ambon\u2013Seram RBT. During 2010\u20132014, only 60% of the \nplanned investment was realized. \n12 Climate change is also expected to produce stronger and more frequent El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events and will \nexacerbate floods and droughts, thereby leading to increased food and water insecurity. \n13 FRM embraces a range of measures that address three key components: (i) managing flood hazard, (ii) minimizing \nexposure to flood hazard, and (iii) reducing the vulnerability of people and property exposed. Managing flood \nhazard  involves  physical  modifications  to  water  flow,  such  as  river  infrastructure  works,  and  catchment \nmanagement measures such as controls over forestry and agricultural practices. Managing exposure to floods \ninvolves property acquisition, land use zoning, building codes, planning development controls, and elevated \nbuilding. Managing flood vulnerability involves nonstructural measures such as community awareness, flood \nforecasting and warning, preparedness, emergency response, and post-flood early recovery strategies. The FRM \nprocess allows these measures to be weighed against physical, social, and economic conditions; and addresses \nspecific issues that characterize each RBT. \n14 The central government is responsible for 63 RBTs, provincial agencies for 53, and district agencies for 15. \n15 The SPWR calls for an overall investment of $24.68 billion nationwide for water resources management. \n ", "3 \nriver floods) and the Ambon\u2013Seram RBT (which experiences flash floods)16 have been initially \nselected  to  demonstrate  FRM  in  implementing  the  RPJMN.  The  investment  will  help  the \ngovernment accelerate implementation of Rencanas in selected RBTs, and provides (i) a long-\nterm partnership between the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the government for policy \ndialogue and capacity development, and (ii) the design of a future programmatic and systems \nbased approach to flood risk management in Indonesia. The project\u2019s outputs and sector targets \nare clearly linked, and the criteria for the sector modality are met.17 \n \n8.  The  project  builds  on  lessons  from  flood  management  assistance  by  ADB  and \ndevelopment partners. The project design incorporates key recommendations based on these \nlessons, including (i) intensive consultations need to be conducted with local stakeholders \nduring  project  preparation  to  address  all  problems  and  issues,  (ii)  the  government  should \nroutinely collect and analyze flood-damage data, (iii) support is needed to design and develop \nsustainable long-term flood management concepts, and (iv) watershed management programs \nshould be implemented to enhance the impact and sustainability of flood control works.18 \n \n9.  The  project  is  consistent  with  (i)  the  strategic  priorities  for  the  Midterm  Review  of \nStrategy  2020;19 and  (ii)  ADB\u2019s  interim  country  partnership  strategy,  2015  for  Indonesia.20 \nAgriculture  and  natural  resources  (including  flood  management)  is  a  sector  focus  of  the \npartnership strategy. The project is aligned with the ADB water operational plan, which identifies \nflood mitigation (as part of disaster risk management) as one of the two urgent challenges to be \naddressed  in  the  IWRM  approach.21 The  project  is  also  aligned  with  the  ADB\u2019s  plan  for \nintegrated disaster risk management as it will support the government and local communities to \nidentify and better manage risks from natural hazards.22 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be economic and social losses from flood events in selected river basins \nreduced.  The  outcome  will  be  flood  risks  in  selected  river  basins,  including  those  in  the \nCidanau\u2013Ciujung\u2013Cidurian and Ambon\u2013Seram RBTs, reduced through FRM. \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  To achieve its expected outcome, the project will have the following outputs: \n \n(i)  Planning  for  flood  risk  management  enhanced. The project will introduce \nmodern technology and install an expanded network of automatic equipment to \nbetter assess flood risks and formulate solutions. The project will support the \n                                                \n16 The Cidanau\u2013Ciujung\u2013Cidurian RBT covers an area of 4,125 square kilometers and lies mainly within Banten \nprovince, the westernmost province of Java. The Ambon\u2013Seram RBT is located on the islands of Ambon and \nSeram in eastern Indonesia\u2019s Maluku province, and has an area of 18,625 square kilometers. \n17 The required preconditions for the use of the sector lending modality\u2014sector development plan, institutional \ncapacity, and appropriate policy to implement the sector development plan\u2014are all in place. The MPWH, as the \nexecuting agency, has the capacity to implement the sector development plan in terms of identification, selection, \ndesign, and implementation of subprojects. The sector development plan identified sector indicators that can be \nmonitored and verified, including targets for cross-cutting and safeguard concerns. \n18  ADB. 2007.

This  will  be \ncomplemented by institutional strengthening, planning, and coordination in those \nprovinces and districts that will use FRMPs in updating provincial, district, and/or \ncity government spatial, midterm, and annual plans.23 \n(ii)  Land management improved and flood infrastructure upgraded. This output \nwill reduce flood hazards through a combination of physical interventions. The \nproject will support RBOs to prepare detailed engineering designs (DEDs); meet \nenvironmental and social safeguards; conduct tendering and O&M planning; and \nimplement  infrastructure  subprojects  that  are  technically,  socially, \nenvironmentally, and economically justified.24 Flood control investments will be \nimplemented in conjunction with programs that will reduce sediment transport. \nCommunities in middle catchments will improve selected degraded land areas by \nimplementing soil and water conservation measures to reduce soil erosion.25  \n(iii)  Capacity for community-based flood risk management enhanced. To further \nimprove  flood  resilience,  community-based  flood  risk  management  (CBFRM) \ngroups in the flood plains that benefit from the early warning system will be \nestablished, strengthened, and engaged. This involves raising the knowledge \nand understanding of the specific risks each community faces specific to their \nlocation, and the possible mitigation measures that might be available to prepare \nthem. This will be focused on mitigating the adverse impacts of floods tailored to \nthe specific nature and scale of the risk of each community in each location.  \n(iv)  Policy, coordination, and capacity at national level improved. To ensure \neffective policy and planning coordination, the project will support independent \nmonitoring, evaluation, and strategic coordination under the National Steering \nCommittee for Water Resources. A national strategy and a set of guidelines will \nbe prepared to institutionalize the FRM approach. The project will support the \nexecuting and implementing agencies to strengthen the planning, implementation, \nand management capacities of the implementing agencies. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n12.  The project is estimated to cost $161.57 million (Table 1). \n \n13.  The government has requested a loan of $108.7 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 17-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, a straight-line repayment method, an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year (the interest and other charges during construction to be \npaid by the government and not capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan agreement.26 Based on this, the average loan maturity is 12.75 years \n                                                \n23 The  FRMPs  will  be  periodically  revised  to  take  into  account  asset  and  economic  growth,  updated \nhydrometeorological data, and changes in land use and policy. The FRMPs will also be used as a basis to update \nspatial, midterm, and annual plans by the local government; and issue related regulations (addressing land use, \nriver corridors, solid waste management, spatial planning, and building). \n24 This comprises the (a) rehabilitation and upgrading of existing flood control structures; and (b) construction of new \nstructures such as river dikes, spillways, coastal protection, retention basins, and check dams. \n25 The  project  will  (a)  empower  farmers  groups  in  the  Cidanau\u2013Ciujung\u2013Cidurian  RBT  to  adopt  sustainable \nagriculture practices, including terracing and development of retention ponds; and (b) implement measures to stop \nlandslides and thus reduce sediment yields in both RBTs. \n26 Loan Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nand there is no maturity premium payable to ADB.

Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Directorate General of Water Resources (DGWR) under the MPWH will be the \nexecuting  agency.  A  central  project  implementation  unit  will  be  established  in  the  DGWR \nDirectorate of River and Coast to provide technical guidance to the implementing agencies: the \nBalai Besar Wilayah Sungai (major river basin organization) Cidanau\u2013Ciujung\u2013Cidurian and the \nBalai Wilayah Sungai (river basin organization) Maluku. The Directorate of River and Coast will \nselect and appraise structural subprojects in accordance with the criteria detailed in the project \nadministration manual (PAM).28 ADB will review subprojects on a selective basis with reference \nto the agreed criteria. The RBOs, together with the provincial land agencies, will prepare and \nimplement the DED and LAR for structural subprojects. The river basin coordination bodies will \nprovide strategic guidance and intersectoral coordination at the RBT level.29 \n                                                \n27 The loan may finance local transportation and insurance costs. \n28 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 The river basin coordination bodies for the Cidanau\u2013Ciujung\u2013Cidurian and Ambon\u2013Seram RBTs were legalized in  \n2013 and 2012 through Minister of Public Works Decree Nos. 243/KPTS/M/2013 and 437/KPTS/M/2012. \n ", "6 \n16.  The Ministry of Agriculture through the Directorate General of Agricultural Infrastructure \nand Facilities (DGAIF) will implement sustainable agriculture practices in the Cidanau\u2013Ciujung\u2013\nCidurian RBT in cooperation with provincial and district agriculture agencies. A central project \nimplementation unit (CPIU) has been established in DGAIF. \n \n17.  Under the overall guidance and responsibility of the CPIU under the Directorate General \nof  Regional  Development  in  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  provincial  and  district  planning \nagencies will ensure institutional strengthening, planning, and coordination of provincial and \ndistrict disaster management, meteorology, public works, land, social, and forestry agencies. \nThe provincial and district planning agencies will ensure that FRMPs are reflected in the sector \nspatial, midterm, and annual plans. \n \n18.  Through  the  Directorate  of  Water  Resources  and  Irrigation  under  the  National \nDevelopment Planning Agency, a CPIU will be established to support the National Steering \nCommittee for Water Resources in providing independent monitoring, evaluation, and strategic \ncoordination of activities.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n19.  Technical due diligence included a comprehensive review of the hydrology, basin plans, \nand feasibility studies. For the core subproject,30 site investigations and bathymetric surveys \nhave been conducted to prepare the DED and cost estimates. During project preparation, the \nproject team (i) considered a range of technical alternatives and their technical and economic \nviability;  (ii)  reviewed  the  rationale  for  the  proposed  design,  specific  components,  and \noperational modes; (iii) deliberated ways to maximize the beneficiary areas and communities \nand minimize adverse environmental and social impacts; and (iv) optimized timescales for \nproject implementation. The project inherently supports climate change adaptation because it \nwill  increase  resilience to flood  hazards; specific  adaptation measures  are  included  in  the \ninfrastructure designs, such as provision for increased flows in waterways. Furthermore, the \ninvestment program includes nonstructural components for climate resilience that will (i) assist \ncommunities in improving flood preparedness and resiliency; and (ii) assist the government in \nimproving its policies and institutions, based on IWRM principles.31 \n \n20.  The  RBOs  have  the  capacity  to  supervise  and  coordinate  the  construction  of \ninfrastructure. During project implementation, O&M manuals for the civil works financed by ADB \nwill be developed in close collaboration with the Directorate of Operation and Maintenance \nunder  the  DGWR  to  ensure  sustainability  of the  investment. The  official  hydrological  data \nmanagement,  flood  modeling,  and  early  warning  system  software  suite  developed  by  the \nResearch Center for Water Resources under MPWH will be adopted to ensure consistency with \nDGWR\u2019s efforts to standardize systems nationwide.  \n \n21.  Land and water management activities to be implemented in the Cidanau\u2013Ciujung\u2013\nCidurian RBT by DGAIF are based on proven approaches. Implementation mechanisms and \ntechnical specifications are described in the Ministry of Agriculture guidelines. CBFRM activities \nwill benefit from the Directorate General of Regional Development\u2019s coordination experience. \nSpecific guidelines will be developed at the early stage of the project to provide guidance on \nselecting target communities and members of the CBFRM community groups. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  Economic and financial analyses have been undertaken on the representative Ciujung \nsubproject.32 The annual economic benefit of flood protection on the Ciujung river is estimated \nat $6.19 million, with protection of buildings accounting for 93.9%. The value of protection of rice \nproduction has been excluded from the benefit stream (flood duration is less than 6 days).33 The \nprotection of the area under fish ponds accounts for 6.1% of total benefits. The economic \ninternal rate of return of the subproject is estimated at 15.1%, higher than the assumed cutoff \nrate for economic viability of 12.0%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the economic viability of \nthe  subproject  is  highly  robust  with  respect  to  adverse  movements  in  the  values  of  key \nvariables, and assumptions relating to asset values. \n \n                                                \n30 The core subproject consists of the construction of dikes along 11 kilometers of the Ciujung river, complemented \nby the construction of spillways and a retention basin. \n31 A climate risk vulnerability assessment has been undertaken for the Ciujung river basin and additional due \ndiligence is planned for the future subprojects in the Cidanau\u2013Ciujung\u2013Cidurian and Ambon\u2013Seram  RBTs. \n32 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 It is assumed that an inundation of less than 6 days will not damage rice crops. \n ", "8 \n23.  The economic analysis includes only the costs and benefits for structural measures. The \ncosts and benefits of nonstructural interventions proposed under the project are difficult to \nquantify as they involve benefits and costs with nonmarket values. CBFRM measures tend to be \nlow-cost activities with high levels of benefit. Such complementary nonstructural measures will \nsignificantly enhance the viability of subproject structural interventions. The financial analysis \nconcluded that the required O&M budget level is assessed as highly affordable for DGWR, Balai \nBesar Wilayah Sungai Cidanau\u2013Ciujung\u2013Cidurian, and Balai Wilayah Sungai Maluku. \n \nC.  Governance \n24.  All ADB-financed procurement will be carried out in accordance with ADB Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). Project implementation, procurement, and \nfinancial management will be aligned with the government\u2019s standard operating procedures. The \noverall procurement classification for the project is medium risk (category medium).34 A financial \nmanagement assessment concluded that the pre-mitigation financial management risk level for \nthe project is substantial due to the complex implementation arrangements and risks associated \nwith internal controls, internal audit capabilities, and segregation of duties. There are shortfalls, \nsuch as the lack of experience with ADB project management for some implementing agencies, \nwhich will be addressed through training and support from the project management consultant. \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and ADB's Integrity Principles \nand  Guidelines  were  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  DGWR.35 The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n26.  Mitigation and improved management of flood risks will benefit communities through (i) \navoidance of property losses and reduction in casualties; (ii) increase in agricultural productivity \nand incomes through improved water management; and (iii) reduction of economic losses from \nlivelihood disruption, and improvement of health and sanitation conditions. Land management \nand CBFRM activities will generate employment opportunities in the community. Civil society \norganizations will support community engagement. The project is classified as effective gender \nmainstreaming. Women will benefit from project interventions through increased engagement in \n(i) prioritizing flood risk reduction measures; (ii) implementing local disaster risk management \nactivities; (iii) generating employment through small civil works and other project activities; and \n(iv) community disaster preparedness, including dissemination of flood warning. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n27.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  the  environment.  The \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  includes  procedures  to  ensure \npotential  environmental  impacts  are  avoided,  reduced,  and  mitigated.36 Potential  adverse \nenvironmental impacts from the project are assessed to be temporary and insignificant, and can \nbe readily mitigated. The EARF and initial environmental examination (IEE) for the Ciujung core \nsubproject  have  been  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website.37 For  future  subprojects,  government-\napproved environmental impact assessment (AMDAL) studies will be accepted as subproject \n                                                \n34 Project Procurement Risk Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 ADB. 2015.

Upon incorporation of ADB\u2019s \ncomments to ensure that the AMDAL or the environmental management and/or monitoring \nplans meet Safeguard Policy Statement requirements, the English version of the AMDAL will be \nsubmitted to ADB and accepted as the IEE or the environmental impact assessment. \n \n28.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  category  A  for  involuntary \nresettlement. Structural works will require LAR in rural and settlement areas. The resettlement \nframework guides the formulation and implementation of the resettlement plan for structural \nsubprojects,39 in compliance with the Safeguard Policy Statement and Government Law No. \n2/2012  on  Land  Acquisition  for  the  Development  in  the  Public  Interest  and  relevant \nimplementing regulations. A resettlement plan was prepared and concurred by the government \nfor the Ciujung core subproject.40 It will acquire 190.4 ha of land and will affect about 1,887 \nhouseholds (5,760 people), of which (i) 1,060 households are considered vulnerable, (ii) 93 \nhouseholds are to be physically relocated, and (iii) 1,208 households are to lose more than 10% \nof their productive assets. In accordance with the principles and implementation mechanisms \ndescribed in the resettlement framework, the Banten province and Serang local government \nbudgeted  for  the  implementation  of  the  social  component  of  the  resettlement  program  to \ncomplement the land acquisition activities and ensure better livelihood opportunities for affected \nand  vulnerable  groups.  Local  government  commitment  to  fund  and  implement  the  social \ncomponent of the resettlement program will be a prerequisite for ADB financing of structural \nsubprojects to ensure that the project does not have the potential for significant adverse social \nimpacts, particularly on vulnerable groups that may be unable to absorb such impacts. \n \n29.  Indigenous peoples. The project is classified category C (indigenous people do not live \nin the core subproject areas). As part of the selection criteria, future subprojects will exclude \nproposals that impact indigenous peoples. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.41 The overall benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the risks and costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLAR activities for structural  Provision of support for the social component of the LAR program by provincial \nsubprojects are delayed due  and/or local governments will be confirmed during subproject selection as a \nto (i) a lack of engagement  prerequisite for investment.
