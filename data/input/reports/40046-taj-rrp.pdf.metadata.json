The  summary  initial  environmental  examination \n(SIEE) is in Appendix 9. \n \nTajikistan  is  susceptible  to  natural  disasters,  particularly  floods. \nThe floods of 1998 and 1999 were especially devastating, causing \n32 deaths and agricultural and infrastructure damage estimated at \n$55 million.  \n \nThe  Project  aims  to  help  Tajikistan  address  recurring  flood  risks \nthrough  a  holistic  and  coordinated  approach  involving  both \nphysical  and  non-physical  measures  in  one  of  the  most  flood- \nprone  areas  in  the  country\u2014Hamadoni,  Farkhor,  Kulyab,  and \nVose  districts  in  Khatlon  province.    A  major  part  of  the  Project \nfunds  will  be  used  for  the  physical  works  for  the  rehabilitation  of \n8.3 km of flood protection embankment along the Pyanj River. In \naddition, the project will develop and disseminate a flood risk map, \nstrengthen  flood  warning  systems,  prepare  a  flood  preparedness \nand evacuation plan, and strengthen flood forecasting capacity by \nrehabilitating the hydrometeorological network.     \n \nGiven that the Pyanj River borders Tajikistan and Afghanistan, the \npossible environmental impacts of the Project's physical works in \nboth  Tajikistan  and  Afghanistan  were  examined.  The  initial \nenvironment  examination  study  found  that  there  is  unlikely  to  be \nsignificant negative environmental impact. The Project is expected \nto  have  a  significant  positive  impact  on  ecological  resources  and \nsocioeconomic conditions in the area.  \n \nIn  addition,  the  project  will  help  the  Government  define  and \nimplement  the  policy  reforms  needed  to  improve  its  flood \npreparedness, and to remove some of its persisting operation and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  funding  constraints  for  the  flood  levees  and \nbank protection works.  \n \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  capacity  at  the  Ministry  of  Land \nReclamation  and  Water  Resources  (MLRWR)  and  the  local \ngovernment bodies to manage flood disaster risks, and to apply \n \n\nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \nRationale \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \n\n \n\nneed-based O&M budget planning, allocations, and monitoring for \nthe  flood  protection  structures.  The  application  of  performance- \nbased O&M contracts will also be pilot tested. \n \nThe  four  districts  in  Khatlon  province  contain  some  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  most  productive  agricultural  lands.  Cotton,  Tajikistan\u2019s \nkey  agricultural  export  commodity,  is  grown  in  53%  of  the \nprovince\u2019s  farm  land  (93,000  ha),  accounting  for  32%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  total  cotton  area.  The  area  is  populated  by  583,700 \npeople  and  has  a  comparatively  high  level  of  private  and  public \nsector  assets,  which  play  a  pivotal  role  in  regional  agriculture, \neconomy and trade.  \n \nThis area is under constant threat of flooding by the Pyanj River, \nas  flood  protection  facilities  have  degraded  over  the  years \nbecause  of  continued  under-funding  of  O&M  expenditures.  In \naddition,  the  floods  from  the  upper  mountains  are  worsening\u2014\nboth  in  intensity  and  duration.  The  Government  accords  the \nhighest  priority  to  the  immediate  improvement  of  flood  protection \nfacilities  in  Khatlon  province.  By  putting  in  place  modern  flood \nprotection,  the  Government  also  expects  to  reduce  the  annual \nO&M funding requirements substantially.  \n \nThe  concept  and  approach  of  the  proposed  project  reflect  the \nlessons gathered under the technical assistance (TA) for Strategy \nfor  Improved  Flood  Management.  The  economic  problems  of  the \nlast decade have left a considerable backlog of maintenance work \nto  be  done  on  the  protection  systems.  As  a  result,  the  levels  of \nprotection  against  flooding  in  many  areas  of  the  country  are \nalarmingly \nto  bring \nprotection  systems  to  a  reasonable  level  has  been  accorded  a \nhigh priority.  \n \nThe  Project  will  reduce  the  risk  of  socioeconomic  losses  caused \nby  floods  in  Farkhor,  Hamadoni,  Kulyab  and  Vose  districts  of \nKhatlon  province  through  a  holistic  and  coordinated  approach  of \nphysical  protection  measures  and  non-physical  measures,  such \nas  flood  preparedness,  forecasting  and  warning  with  community \nparticipation.  The \nframework  will  be \nstrengthened during project implementation, taking full account of \nsocial, environmental, and economic factors. \n \n \nThe  cost  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  $28.5  million,  including \ntaxes  and  duties  of  $4.9  million.  The  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) will finance $22 million equivalent from Asian Development \nFund  (ADF).

All \nprocurement  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime).  \n \nThe Project will provide 486 person-months of consulting services, \nto  be  provided  by  international  (72  person-months)  and  national \n(414  person-months).  The  consultants  will  be \nconsultants \nrecruited  according \nthe  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The selection \nwill  be  based  on  full  technical  proposals  and  quality-  and  cost- \nbased selection (QCBS). \n \n\nto  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  project  area  is  highly  vulnerable  to  floods  and  has  a  strong \nneed  for  flood  protection.  Khatlon  province  contains  most  of  the \nlow-lying flat land in Tajikistan. The population density is relatively \nhigh,  and  predominantly  rural.  The population  of  the  project  area \nis  583,700,  only  20%  of  whom  were  in  employment  in  2005, \nmainly  in  the  agricultural  sector.  The  average  monthly  income \nfrom agriculture was $15 per month. The economy of the project \narea is dominated by agriculture, with wheat and cotton being the \nmost  important  cash  crops,  followed  by  vegetables  and  fruit, \nmainly for the local market and for domestic consumption.   \n \nAssuming  that  a  medium  level  of  maintenance  is  achieved,  it  is \nconsidered  that  the  proposed  embankments  can  effectively \nprotect  against  floods  for  the  next  100  years.  The  economic \nanalysis  shows  that  the  annualized  benefits  would  be  TJS8.148 \nmillion with an economic rate of return of 16.0%.  If it is possible to \nachieve only a low level of maintenance, the level of protection will \nbe reduced to 50 years and the annualized level of benefits will be \nTJS7.038 million with an economic rate of return of 13.7%.  \n \nThe  Project  will  bring  social  benefits,  particularly  for  poorer \nbeneficiaries, by reducing (i) losses of personal property,  houses \nand livestock and consequent damage to family living conditions; \n(ii)  significant  declines  in  income  levels;  (iii)  emergence  of \ndisease,  (iv)  decreases  in  agricultural  yields,  (v)  deterioration  of \ndrinking  water,  (vi)  declines  in  access  to  essential  services,  and \n(vii) levels of migration.  \n \nNo significant negative environmental impact is likely. The Project \nis  likely  to  have  a  significant  positive  impact  on  soil  and  water \nresources,  agricultural  productivities,  public  health,  and  rural \nlivelihoods.  \n \n \nIf the Government cannot provide a sufficient O&M budget for the \ncompleted flood protection embankment, it will be easily damaged \nby  the  future  floods.  This  risk  has  been  mitigated  by  including  in \nthe  loan  agreement  a  provision  for  heavy  equipment  to  maintain \nthe  completed  embankments  and  a  strong  commitment  from  the \nGovernment  to  provide  sufficient  budget  for  fuel,  lubricant,  and \nspare parts, which are clearly specified in the loan agreement.  \n \n\n\f \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nv\n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for the Khatlon Province Flood Risk Management Project.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nAt  the  request  of  the  Government  of  Tajikistan,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \napproved  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  preparation  of  the  Khatlon  Province  Flood  Risk \nManagement Project (the Project).1 The TA study was carried out from November 2006 to May \n2007. This report is based on the project preparatory technical assistance feasibility study, the \nfindings  of  ADB  missions,  lessons  learned  from  similar  projects,  and  discussions  with \ngovernment  officials,  other  development  partners,  civil  society,  and  beneficiaries.  The  project \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis2 \n\n3 \nTajikistan  is  a  mountainous,  landlocked  and  isolated  country  with  high  mountains  and \nsignificant river systems. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1992 it was the poorest of the \nformer Soviet republics, and a subsequent 5-year civil war both delayed economic transition and \nslowed growth prospects. The economy grew by 7.0% in 2006, driven by increases in aluminum \nprices  and  approximately  $718  million  in  remittances3 from  large  numbers  of  male  migrants. \nHowever,  the  country\u2019s  options  are  limited  by  a  narrow  export  base  of  largely  cotton  and \naluminum, structural difficulties in agriculture, and limited capacity for international borrowing to \nfund  other  economic  expansion.  Per-capita  income  levels  of  $350  per  year  demonstrate  the \nhigh  level  of  poverty,  and  low  government  revenues  severely  constrain  service  provision, \nparticularly in rural areas. \n \nOf Tajikistan\u2019s total area of 14.3 million hectares (ha), only 4.3 million ha is agricultural \n4. \nland  and  only  0.8  million  ha  is  arable.  Despite  the  low  amount  of  available  arable  land, \nagriculture  is  the  major  source  of  livelihood  for  more  than  64%  of  the  population,  and  makes \nsignificant  contributions  to  the  economy.  In  2004,  output  from  agriculture  generated  22%  of \ngross domestic product (GDP), 20% of exports, 67% of employment, and 39% of tax revenues. \nOf Tajikistan\u2019s 7.0 million people, 70% live in rural areas. Rural poverty incidence declined from \n83% in 1999 to 64% in 2003.  For poverty reduction to be effective, rural households must be \nable to protect their access to and productivity of their land and be able to mitigate the risk of the \nloss of livelihoods and assets.    \n \n5. \nTajikistan  is  prone  to  frequent  natural  disasters,  including  floods,  mudflows,  landslides, \navalanches,  earthquakes,  droughts  and  epidemics  because  of  its  terrain  and  climate. \nCatastrophic events with an annual probability of occurrence of 0.5% (events expected to occur \nonce every 200 years) would have a major impact on an already vulnerable economy and it has \nbeen estimated that the economic losses from such an event would exceed 20% of Tajikistan\u2019s \nGDP. 4  All  areas  of  the  country  would  be  affected.  The  combination  of  low  gross  national \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2006.

The mountain system is geologically young and eroded and mountain slopes are steep \nin many parts of the country. Climactic systems source water from glacial and snowmelt at high \nelevations. These conditions easily generate destructive floods. While annual total rainfall is not \nparticularly high, intensive daily rainfall in excess of 100 mm is known. Floods from larger rivers \ntend to be generated through rapid snowmelt, coupled with periods of heavy rainfall.  The years \n1998  and  1999  were  particularly  bad  for  flooding,  leading  to  32  deaths  and  agricultural  and \ninfrastructure damage estimated at $55 million.  \n \n7. \nThe  relatively  densely  populated  Khatlon  province  occupies  the  south-west  corner  of \nTajikistan  adjacent  to  the  Uzbekistan  border  to  the  west  and  the  Afghanistan  border  to  the \nsouth.  The  population  of  the  project  area  (Hamadoni,  Farkhor,  Vose,  and  Kulyab  districts)  is \n583,700.  Only  20%  of  adults  were  formally  employed  in  2005,  mainly  in  agriculture.  The \naverage monthly income from agriculture was $15 per month. The economy of the project area \nis  dominated  by  agriculture,  with  wheat  and  cotton  being  the  most  important  cash  crops, \nfollowed  by  vegetables  and  fruit,  mainly  for  the  local  market  and  domestic  consumption.  \nPoverty is significant, endemic, and higher than in most other areas of the country. \n \nKhatlon  province  contains  large  reclaimed  flood  plain  in  the  1930s  by  Soviet \n8. \nembankment  construction  along  the  Pyanj  and  tributary  Yakhsu  and  Kazilsu  rivers.  This  area \nforms  a  significant  percentage  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  total  arable  land  and  much  of  the  irrigated  land \narea. Khatlon province contains most of the low-lying land in Tajikistan. The Pyanj river forms \nthe  international  border  with  Afghanistan,  and  the  Babatag  Mountains  form  the  international \nborder  with  Uzbekistan.  Runoff  from  the  Pyanj  river  basin  is  generated  mainly  in  summer \nbecause of snow- and icemelt. The volume of annual runoff depends chiefly on the quantity of \nsnow accumulation in winter and air temperatures during the following summer. The maximum \ndischarge is usually in July or August, while the minimum occurs in mid-winter.  \n \n9. \nIn  the  years  since  independence,  the  fertile  plains  adjacent  to  the  Pyanj,  Kizilsu  and \nYakhsu  rivers  in  Khatlon  province  have  become  increasingly  vulnerable  to  floods.  Lives  have \nbeen  lost  and  flood  embankments,  houses,  canals,  land,  roads  and  bridges  have  been \ndestroyed.  There  were  severe  floods  in  Kulyab,  Vose  and  Farkhor  districts  in  1998  and  1999 \ncaused  by  the  Yakhsu  and  Kizilsu  river  systems.  Subsequently,  smaller  floods  have  caused \nfurther damage. A major flood took place in 2005 in Hamadoni district caused by embankment \nfailure along the Pyanj river, with damage estimated at over $18 million.  \n \n10. \nThe flood risk on the flood plains of the Kizilsu and Yakhsu rivers in Kulyab, Vose and \nFarkhor  districts  in  Khatlon  province  is  very  high  because  of  the  destruction  of  flood \nembankments  since  1998.  At  least  15  km  of  flood  embankment  have  been  destroyed  so  far. \nThe probability of flooding in some parts may now be higher than 50% (an average chance of \nflooding once in 2 years). The irrigation infrastructure, inherited at the end of the Soviet era, has \nsuffered from a lack of investment in routine maintenance. This has led to progressive loss of \ncultivable  land  and  damage  to  embankments,  intakes  and  canals.  The  lack  of  maintenance \nleaves  communities,  infrastructure  and  valuable  agricultural  land  highly  vulnerable  to  further \nloss or damage on an almost annual basis. In effect there is no flood protection in some places. \nOne hundred and six villages in the catchment area are designated as high flood risk.  \n \n11. \nThe Pyanj river emerges from being relatively confined in a valley onto a large outwash \nfan.  At  the  head  of  the  fan  the  river  is  characterized  by  its  steep  slope,  its  gravel  and  cobble \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\nbed,  and  its  braided  bed  form.  A  notable  feature  of  the  main  river  channel  is  that  it  tends  to \nattach  to  one  mountainside  or  the  other,  with  braided  channels  crossing  gravel  bars  from  one \nside  to  the  other.  The  current  design  and  construction  methods  of  flood  embankments  and \nspurs  aim  for  economy  and  expediency  but  at  the  cost  of high  maintenance  burdens.  Without \nproper  maintenance,  it  is  inevitable  that  flood  risk  will  increase  because  of  the  erosion, \nslumping, and breaching of embankments due to the highly energetic and unstable channels of \nthe Pyanj river. \n \n12. \nThe  situation  in  the  Kizilsu  and  Yakhsu  valleys  is  quite  different.  Here  the  rivers  have \nbeen severely constrained by flood embankments on both sides with the adjacent land heavily \ndeveloped  for  agriculture  and  settlement.  This  rigid  river  training  has  encouraged  more  gravel \nand silt to be transported further down the valleys than would naturally be the case, raising river \nbed levels and flood levels. In Kulyab and Vose, the main channels of the Kizilsu and Yakhsu \nrivers  appear  to  have  little  capacity  left.  Consequently,  the  embankments  have  been  scoured, \novertopped, and breached. Lack of adequate maintenance has allowed once minor damage to \nspread almost unchecked until it has become a major issue. In 2007, many villages and farms in \nKulyab and Vose are highly vulnerable to serious flooding. This state of affairs may have been \nexacerbated by the local practice of excavating river gravels close to the embankments. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems  \n\nCareful  analysis  reveals  the  following  key  flood  management  performance  problems  in \n\n13. \nthe project area and generally: \n \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nthe current Water Code does not incorporate the concept of flood management; \ninstitutional  responsibilities  for  flood  management  are  not  clearly  specified  in \nexisting legislation; \nthere  are  no  specific  allocations  of core  capital  and  recurrent  funds  to  the  flood \nmanagement institutions; \nflood defences have failed because of a lack of maintenance; \naccurate  flood  forecasts  have  not  been  available  because  only  part  of  the \nprecipitation and river monitoring network is functional and forecasting tools are \nnot developed; \nflood warnings have not reached the residents of flood risk areas soon enough; \n\n(vi) \n(vii)  many  residents  of  flood-risk  areas  have  been  unprepared  for  floods,  and \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nunaware of how to mitigate the risk of loss of assets and critical papers; \nthe  socioeconomic  impacts  of  flooding  have  been  large  and  in  some  locations \nirreversible; \nthe  rivers  in  the  Hamadoni  area  are  naturally  unstable  and  erosive  and  are  in \nconflict with flood plain development for agriculture and settlement; \nland  use  changes  in  highland  subcatchment  areas  may  have  increased  flood \nfrequency and magnitude; and \nglobal  warming  and  climate  change  may  have  increased  flood  frequency  and \nmagnitude and may continue to do so. \n\n \n14. \nThe  key  flood  management  institutions  are  the  State  Commission  for  Emergency \nSituations  (SCES),  the  Committee  for  Emergency  Situations  (CES),  the  Ministry  of  Land \nReclamation and Water Resources (MLRWR) and the Agency for Hydrometeorology within the \nMinistry  of  Agriculture  and  Environment  Protection  (MAEP).  However,  their  specific  roles  and \nresponsibilities with respect to flood management are not completely defined in the underlying \nlegislation  and  are  not  integrated  or  well  coordinated  within  a  coherent  flood  management \nsystem. This causes gaps and overlaps in predicting floods and preparing for them, in mitigating \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nrisk, in addressing floods when they occur, and in post-flood repairs. Furthermore, there are no \nspecific allocations of capital or recurrent funds for flood management at each institution. Flood \nmanagement  and  disaster  management  in  general  appears  to  be  managed  by  the  central \nGovernment on a contingency basis rather than as a core activity. \n \nSince  1992,  the  Government  has  been  forced  into  a  strategy  of  reactive  emergency \n15. \nrepairs to flood defenses in the project area and elsewhere following a series of severe floods. \nThese  repairs  have  had  to  be  funded  partly  by  international  partners  and  partly  from  state \nreserves on an as-needed basis. There is a shortage of central recurrent budgets for operation \nand  maintenance  (O&M),  and  water  users  are  unable  to  pay  enough  for  flood  protection  from \nthe  irrigation  canals.  The  situation  is  now  widely  recognized  by  the  Government  and  by  the \ndonor  community  to  be  unsustainable.  There  is  growing  acceptance  that  there  needs  to  be  a \nmore holistic and strategic approach to flood management.   \n \n16. \nThe  most  important  environmental  issue  is  the  conflict  between  agriculture  and \nsettlement  on  the  flood  plains  and  the  naturally  violent  and  unstable  nature  of  the  rivers.  To \nsustain agricultural production and development, the rivers have to be managed very carefully \nand  significant  resources  provided  for  O&M  of  the  aging  irrigation  and  embankment  systems. \nUnfortunately,  since  independence  in  1992,  this  has  been  beyond  the  means  of  central, \nprovincial  and  district  governments.  Consequently  there  has  been  progressive  destruction  of \nland, property and infrastructure. \n \n17. \nThe provision of adequate maintenance is a considerable challenge for the Government.  \nTotal  expenditure  on  flood  protection  works  decreased  sharply  from  $11.5  million  in  1985  to \n$0.43 million in 1999 and it has remained at roughly this level since then. Proper O&M of flood \nprotection  embankments  requires  2%-3%  of  the  total  capital  investment  cost  annually.  One \nproblem MLRWR faces in maintaining the flood embankments is the poor condition of the heavy \nequipment. In Hamadoni district, the existing stock of machinery for maintenance is between 15 \nand 30 years old and 10 of the 23 machines are unserviceable. If flood embankments are not \nproperly maintained, they will erode and flood protection capacity will fall.  \n \n18. \nFlood risk maps show the areas of a flood plain that are likely to flood. They are used to \ndefine different flood risk areas within the flood plain according to flood frequency and severity \nof  flood  impact.  The  flood  risk  of  each  area  defined  in  this  way  then  determines  which  flood \nmanagement measures are most appropriate in that zone and which areas should be prioritized. \nUnfortunately there are no detailed flood risk maps in the project area, so there are no proper \nemergency evacuation plans in the villages along the Pyanj, Yakhsu and Kizilsu rivers.  \n \n19. \nAlthough  a  flood  warning  system  exists  for  the  Pyanj  river  at  Hamadoni,  based  on  the \nrate  of  rise  of  the  river  level  at  Khirmanjo  approximately  100  km  upstream,  the  warnings  are \nimprecise.  The  river  gauge  is  in  a  poor  condition  and  difficult  to  reach  because  it  is  on  the \nAfghanistan border. A flood warning system has recently been restored on the Yakhsu river at \nKarboztonak  which  is  linked  to  the  Agency  for  Hydrometeorology  in  Dushanbe  and  also,  by \nradio,  to  downstream  communities.  Other  community  flood  warning  systems  are  being \nintroduced or proposed by international nongovernment organizations (NGOs) such as Mission \nEast and Oxfam, but most villages will not have flood warning systems under these programs.  \nEven when these simple tools are in place, villages are not trained to use them effectively. \n \nThe socioeconomic impact of flooding is high. There is a strong link between floods and \n20. \npoverty5 and there is substantial loss of livelihood after floods. Whereas only 7% of flood victims \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB. 2004. Floods and the Poor, Water for All. Manila (publication no. 11). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\nin the four districts in Khatlon province believe their income was below average before flooding, \n71% believe it was below average after flooding. This correlates with estimates that production \nof grain fell by 70%, of vegetables by 83%, and of grapes by 95% following floods. After floods \n38% of cattle and 58% of poultry were lost. Over 96% of houses were seriously or moderately \ndamaged  and  54%  of  the  land  was  flooded  and  inundated  with  debris.  Disease,  deteriorating \ndrinking  water  quality,  water  logging  of  land,  and  greater  emigration  are  characteristic  of  the \naftermath of floods.  \n \n21. \nThe CES is responsible for ensuring that the relevant government, provincial and district \ndepartments and communities at risk of flooding are adequately prepared so that the probability \nof household losses can be lower. The CES has training centers in its central and district offices \nbut  it  lacks  the  resources  to  deliver  a  comprehensive  program  of  flood  preparedness  training. \nHowever,  improvements  are  now  being  made  with  support  from  international  donors.  There  is \nno standard system of certification of village preparedness, villages and rapid response teams \nlack  equipment,  and  there  is  insufficient  coordination  at  the  jamoat  (local  government)  level.  \nThere  is  no  regular  and  routine  system  of  simulations  or  drills  to  ensure  villages  and  local \ngovernments  are  well  prepared  to  address  flood  risks  and  disasters.  Although  NGOs  are \nincreasingly  involved  in  disaster  preparedness  work  at  the  village  level,  there  is  not  enough \ncollaboration  between  the  CES,  local  governments,  and  NGOs  to  create  a  cohesive  and \neffective flood management system.  Finally, flood mitigation efforts are scattered and in some \ncases inconsistent. A far more standard method to address this issue must be found. \n \n22.  Most international experts predict that perennial snow- and icemelt will increase due to \nglobal  warming  and  that  storms  will  also  increase.  The  key  findings  of  a  major  recent  climate \nchange  analysis 6  indicated  that  Tajikistan  may  face  an  increase  in  annual,  minimum  and \nseasonal  mean  temperatures;  critical  changes  in  precipitation;  a  rise  in  the  levels  of  lakes \nbecause  of  glacier  degradation;  droughts;  and  other  frequent  extreme  weather  events, \nworsening already serious flood problems. In Khatlon province the prospect is that the summer \nfloods  on  the  Pyanj  river  may  become  larger,  accelerating  the  erosion  of  the  Hamadoni  flood \nembankments. On the Kizilsu and Yakhsu rivers, more storms will increase the frequency and \nseverity of floods in Kulyab, Vose and Farkhor.7   \n \nC. \n\nOpportunities \n\nADB\u2019s  disaster  and  emergency  assistance  policy  (DEAP) 8  provide  direction  for  the \n23. \nproposed project. The DEAP aims to integrate disaster risk management into the development \nprocess  of  developing  member  countries  and  to  build  their  disaster  and  hazard  risk \nmanagement capacity. It also recommends that disaster risk be taken into account in preparing \nADB  country  strategies,  plans  and  projects.  A  key  element  of  the  DEAP  is  institutionalizing \ndisaster risk management by identifying risks during ADB\u2019s country programming schedules and \nbuilding  risk  reduction  strategies  into  project  plans.  In  the  indicative  rolling  country  operations \nbusiness  plan 9  the  proposed  Project  is  expected  to  address  medium-  to  long-term  flood \nmanagement \nin  rural \ncommunities  in  selected  flood-prone  areas,  consistent  with  the  overall  rural  development \napproach. \n \n\ninclusive  economic  growth \n\nto  promote  sustainable, \n\nissues  and \n\n                                                 \n6  Global Environment Facility (GEF) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 2007.

Manila (approved in May). \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\n24. \nA  number  of  related  activities  also  provide  lessons  for  this  Project.  They  include  the \nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Disaster Risk Management Capacity-Building \nProgram, the World Bank\u2019s Emergency Flood Assistance Project,10 the ADB Emergency Flood \nRehabilitation  Project, 11  and  the  ADB  Strategy  for  Improved  Flood  Management 12  (see \nAppendix 3). \n \n25. \nThe  fundamental  opportunity  presented  by  the  Project  is  the  chance  to  put  in  place  a \ncomprehensive  integrated  flood  management  approach  to  replace  the  current  ad  hoc \narrangements.  The  Project  will  reduce  the  severe  economic  and  social  costs  of  floods  by \npromoting the use of combined physical and non-physical approaches to flood protection.13 On \nthe non-physical side there are three key areas to be addressed under the integrated approach. \nFirst, legal and regulatory changes can establish a clear line of authority and responsibility for \nflood  management.  This  will  enable  appropriate  arrangements  for  budgets,  forecasting, \nmitigation, maintenance, addressing of floods when they occur, and handling any reconstruction \nor  aftermath.      Second,  flood  forecasting  and  risk  mapping  can  be  arranged  and  updated  so \nflood risk is better understood, predicted, and mitigated.  Third, a combination of the CES, local \ngovernments  at  the  district  and  jamoat  levels,  villages,  and  NGOs  can  work  together  on \neffective,  properly  resourced  flood  preparedness,  evacuation  plans,  mitigation  plans,  flood \nmonitoring and alerts, including simulations to confirm readiness, and response teams.14  \n \n26. \nThe  introduction  of  structural  flood  management  measures  to  improve  the  flood \nembankments on the Pyanj, Kizilsu and Yakhsu rivers will substantially lower flood risk. When \nthe  current  improvement  works  being  carried  out  on  the  Pyanj  river  as  part  of  another  ADB \nproject 15  are  complete,  some  flood-prone  areas  in  Hamadoni  will  be  protected  to  the  1% \nprobability  level  (an  average  chance  of  flooding  once  in  100  years).  These  improvements  will \napply  to  the  first  12  km  of  embankments.  However,  further  downstream  there  are  damaged \nembankments  near  Metintugai  which  are  not  being  improved.  The  flood  risk  in  this  area  is \nconsidered to be in the range of 5-10% (an average chance of flooding once in 10-20 years). To \nreduce this risk to the same level as that obtained upstream, damaged flood embankments will \nhave to be rehabilitated and canal embankments reinforced. There is an urgent need to study \nand design better flood protection for the worst flood damaged areas of the Kizilsu and Yakhsu \nflood plains, where risks may be as high as 50% (flooding once every 2 years).  \n \n27. \nLowering  the  maintenance  burden  of  structural  improvements  in  the  project  area  will \nincrease the likelihood of a successful maintenance regime in the medium term.  A number of \nways  of  reducing  the  flood  embankment  maintenance  burden  on  the  Government  have  been \nconsidered,  including  replacing  the  current  deteriorated  and  inefficient  plant,  increasing  water \nfees, contracting out maintenance, voluntary community participation, and low or maintenance-\nfree designs. Of these, the replacement of machinery is considered to be the most practical and \nbeneficial.  \n                                                 \n10  World  Bank  Credit  3123-TJ:  Emergency  Flood  Assistance  Project  for  SDR3.800  million  approved  on  27  August \n\n1998, and supplemental credit of SDR1.500 million approved on 14 December 1999. \n\n11  ADB.  1999.

The seeds of such an institution have already been planted in the CES. \nAlthough  it  is  currently  under-resourced,  the  CES  is  generally  recognized  to  be  the  focus  of \ndisaster  management  activities  in  Tajikistan  and  the  repository  of  existing  disaster  expertise \ninherited  from  the  Soviet  era.  Legal  and  regulatory  enhancements  would  enable  the  CES  to \nspecify,  supervise,  and  coordinate  the  disaster-related  activities  of  all  the  implementing \nagencies\u2014notably, in the case of floods, the MLRWR and the Agency for Hydrometeorology. \n \nFurther  opportunities  for  legal  reform  include  the  removal  of  ambiguities  in  existing \n29. \nlegislation regarding the responsibility for disseminating flood warnings and responsibility for the \ndesign,  construction,  and  maintenance  of  flood  protection  structures.  Other  legal  reforms  to \nimprove  control  of  developments  in  the  flood  plain  are  needed.  Financial  reforms  to  secure \nannual  funding  for  the  flood  management  activities  of  the  implementing  agencies,  particularly \nthe operation and maintenance of flood protection works, are also needed. \n \n30. \nDetailed  topographic,  social,  environmental  and  economic  surveys  will  evaluate  the \nextent and value of the assets at risk. Computer modeling of flood inundation caused by design \nfloods  with  probabilities  of,  for  example,  1%,  2%,  4%,  10%,  and  20%  (average  chances  of \nflooding once in 100, 50, 25, 10, and 5 years) as well as the necessary training to build national \ncapacity  in  this  specialty  will  be  used  to  prepare  flood  risk  maps.  Community  participation  in \nsuch  surveys  will  add  significantly  to  their  accuracy  and  usefulness.  These  maps  will  become \nkey  planning  tools  with  which  to  delineate  flood  risk  zones.  Appropriate  flood  preparedness \nprograms for each zone will be designed for use by communities, NGOs, local governments and \nthe CES to arrange flood preparedness and amelioration plans. \n \n31. \nEffective flood forecasting will help both the Government and communities to lower the \nrisk  of  loss  of  life,  assets,  and  property.    This  requires  reliable  real-time  monitoring  of \nprecipitation  amounts  and  river  levels  and  the  development  of  flood  forecasting  models \nformulated  and  calibrated  against  reliable  and  accessible  historical  flood  data.  The  possible \neffects  of  climate  change  need  to  be  considered  through  the  application  of  internationally  and \nnationally  recognized  scenarios.  Rehabilitation  and  modernization  of \nfor \nHydrometeorology\u2019s network of climate stations and river gauges all over the country, including \ntelemetry and communication systems, is needed. The hardware and software of the Agency for \nHydrometeorology\u2019s  database  system  need  rehabilitating  and  updating  so  they  can  produce \nforecasting  models.  Disaster  response  and  mitigation  activities  are  coordinated  by  the  Rapid \nEmergency  Assessment  and  Coordination  Team  (REACT),  established  in  2001  by  the \nGovernment  and  the  United  Nations  Office  for  the  Coordination  of  Humanitarian  Affairs \n(UNOCHA). The Project will cooperate with REACT on monitoring and forecasting floods. \n \nThere  is  a  key  opportunity  to  develop  Government\u2013community  joint  participation  in  the \n32. \nflood management process.  Such partnerships have been effective in other parts of the world in \nmitigating  the  damage  and  hardship  caused  by  flooding.  At  its  best,  community  participation \ncreates a sense of common cause which can convert victims into protagonists and advocates. \nWhen  Government\u2013community  partnerships  are  effective,  there  is  joint  active  involvement  in \nplanning,  emergency  exercises,  mitigation  works,  patrolling,  reporting,  local  infrastructure \nmaintenance, and warnings.  \n \nThe  Project  and  an  associated  proposed  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR) \n33. \ngrant  will  use  this  opportunity  to  engage  the  Government,  communities,  and  NGOs.  The \nGovernment\u2019s role will include (i) standardization, coordination, simulations, and quality control \nof  local  emergency  plans,  for  evacuation  and  mitigation  of  floods;  (ii)  setup,  training,  and \n\nthe  Agency \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nequipping  of  local  flood  warning  systems;  (iii)  arrangements  for  early  warning  and  information \ncommunications on potential risks and actual flood situations; (iv) training, equipping and supply \nof  rapid  response  teams;  and  (iv)  post-flood  surveys  and  reconstruction  support.  Community \nparticipation includes mobilizing and arranging disaster evacuation and mitigation plans, setting \nup  voluntary  workforces  to  ease  the  burden  of  flood  infrastructure  maintenance  on  the \nGovernment,  establishing  communal  management  and  harvesting  of  a  forested  riparian  buffer \nto  supplement  hard  flood  defenses,  conducting  community  monitoring  of  rivers  and  storms  to \naddress increases in flood risks, and participating in the simulations and other arrangements to \naddress flood risks and events. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n34. \nThe  Project  will  reduce  socioeconomic  damage  caused  by  floods  in  the  project  area.  \nThe  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  effective  and  sustainable  flood  management  structural \nfacilities, such as flood embankments, and non-physical flood risk mitigation system comprising \nimproved flood preparedness, forecasting and warning, and also strengthened institutional and \nlegal \ninto  account  social, \nframework  concerning \nenvironmental and economic factors.  \n \nB. \n\nflood  risk  management \n\nOutputs \n\ntakes \n\nthat \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional and Legal Reforms \n\nThe  Project  will  help  Government  improve  laws  and  regulations  to  identify  appropriate \n35. \nauthority  to  be  responsible  for  flood  management  activities  among  relevant  government \nagencies,  dissemination  of  flood  warnings,  flood  preparedness,  and  maintenance  of  flood \nprotection structures, and for restricting of the use of land in flood prone areas. \n \n36. \nUnder the component, 116 person-moths of national consulting services were provided \nto  support  institutional  and  legal  reform,  such  as  to  (i)  review  existing  water  code,  (ii)  review \nexisting  legal  and  institutional  arrangements  to  support  the  implementation  of  an  integrated \nflood  management  system,  (iii)  review  the  role  of  key  institutions  for  the  flood  management \nactivities, and (iv) assist the role of secretariat for the amendment of water code, and (v) train \nstaff related to flood management activities.  \n \n \n \n37. \n4.8  km  of  damaged  flood  embankments  will  be  rehabilitated  and  3.5  km  of  adjacent  irrigation \ncanal embankments will be reinforced. Heavy equipment for O&M will be provided to reduce the \ninitial burden of Government expenditure for O&M.  \n \n\nTo achieve a flood protection level of once in 100 years probability in Hamadoni district \n\nPhysical Measures \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\nNon-physical Measures  \n\n38. \nFlood  Risk  Maps. Under the Project, topographic social, environmental and economic \nsurveys,  and  computer  modeling  of  flood  inundation  areas,  risk  maps  will  be  prepared  and \ndisclosed to the public after consultation with stakeholders for the community development plan, \nland use plan, and the location of flood shelters.    \n  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\n39. \nFlood Preparedness. The flood risk maps will be key planning tools. They will delineate \nflood risk zones for which flood preparedness programs will be designed. These programs will \ninclude  annual  flood  awareness  campaigns  and  evacuation  drills  at  district,  community,  and \nvillage levels and the provision of rapid response team equipment. \n \nFlood  Forecasting.  The  Agency  for  Hydrometeorology\u2019s  entire  network  of  climate \n40. \nstations and river gauges in the project area will be rehabilitated and modernized. The hardware \nand  software  components  of  the  database  will  be  upgraded  in  order  to  facilitate  the \ndevelopment of the forecasting models. \n \n41. \nFlood  Warning.  The  accuracy  and  timeliness  of  flood  warning  triggers  in  the  project \narea will be improved. In future each flood risk area will receive warnings with a lead time of at \nleast 3 hours and flood water depth forecasts will be accurate to within 0.5 m. Equipment will be \nprovided and villagers will be trained in flood monitoring. \n \n\n4. \n\nCapacity Building for Efficient Project Management  \n\nTo facilitate Project implementation, the existing PMO under MLRWR will be expanded \n42. \nfor  the  PMO  of  the  Project  instead  of  establishing  a  new  PMO.  A  group  of  international  and \nnational consultants will support the PMO and train staff of the PMO and project implementation \noffices (PIOs) in project management.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n43. \nThe  Project  represents  a  shift  from  the  previous  reactive  infrastructure-oriented  flood \ncontrol to a comprehensive, integrated and proactive approach to the management of floods. By \nincluding  flood  warning,  public  awareness,  flood  risk  maps,  and  community  evacuation  plans, \nthe  Project  will  help  people  to  address  such  risks  before  they  occur.  A  key  feature  of  this \nintegrated approach is that people living in flood risk areas will be aware of the risk of floods, be \nprepared for them, and take responsibility for monitoring and ameliorating flood risk. \n \n44. \nThis is the first ADB-funded flood-related project in Tajikistan to be implemented through \nthree  agencies  in  an  integrated  manner.  The  MLRWR  will  operate  the  PMO  and  construct \nphysical  structures;  the  Agency  for  Hydrometeorology  will  manage  the  hydrometeorological \nnetwork  and  flood  forecasting;  and  the  CES  will  manage  flood  risk  mapping,  flood \npreparedness, and coordination with local governments and rural communities.  \n \n45. \nThe  very  high  maintenance  needs  of  the  flood  protection  embankments  in  the  project \narea  are  a  special  feature  of  the  project.  The  main  cause  of  the  breach  in  Hamadoni  in  2005 \nwas poor maintenance of the embankments, which are prone to severe damage at high water \nlevels, especially at the spurs. It is difficult to inspect such damage because, even outside the \nflood season, the toes of the embankments are submerged under fast flowing water. The recent \nand  proposed  embankment  rehabilitation  will  be  quickly  undermined  if  proper  O&M  is  not \ncarried  out.  To  avoid  this,  the  Government  has  asked  ADB  to  replace  the  deteriorated  heavy \nequipment  currently  used  for  O&M  in  order  to  reduce  its  financial  burden.  The  Government  is \nstrongly committed to funding the O&M of the new heavy equipment and the labor and materials \nrequired to maintain the embankments.    \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n46. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $28,499,700 equivalent, including taxes and \nduties of $4,898,100, physical and price contingencies of $4,913,500, and $885,100 in interest \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\n \n\n \n\ncharges during implementation.

The organization chart is attached as Appendix 6. \n\n \n49.  Within three months of the date of the loan effectiveness, the Government will establish \na Project Steering Committee (PSC) to (i) provide policy guidance on the implementation of the \nProject activities and flood management activities financed by other donors; (ii) monitor Project \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\nInstitutional  and  Legal  Reform  component  and \n\nimpacts; (iii) review and evaluate Project performance; (iv) review Project audits; and (v) ensure \nclose  coordination  among  agencies  involved  in  flood  management  projects.  The  PSC  will  be \nchaired by the First Deputy Prime Minister and comprising senior staff of MLRWR, MAEP, CES, \nand  other  relevant  ministries  and  agencies.  The  PSC  will  be  located  in  the  President\u2019s  Office \nand shall meet twice a year. The PSC\u2019s sectariat will be located in the PMO.  \n \n50.  MLRWR  as  the  EA  will  be  responsible  for  overall  execution  and  coordination  of  the \nProject, and the timely submission to ADB of (i) withdrawal applications; (ii) consolidated Project \nprogress and other reports; (iii) consolidated audited accounts of the Project, MLRWR will also \nImprovement  of  Physical \nimplement \nInfrastructure.  \n \n51.  MAEP  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  rehabilitation  and  modernization  of  the \nnetwork of climate stations and river all over the country and upgrading hardware and software \nto  facilitate  the  development  of  the  forecasting  models;  CES  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency \nfor (i) developing flood risk maps based on new topographic social environmental surveys and \ncomputer  modeling  of  flood  prone  areas,  (ii)  developing  appropriate    flood  preparedness \nprogram and conducting annual flood awareness campaigns and evacuation drills at district and \ncommunity levels; and (iii) improving the accuracy and timeliness of the existing flood warning \ntriggers in the Project area so that each flood prone area receives flood warnings.  \n \nThe  project  management  office  set  up  under  the  ongoing  ADB-financed  Irrigation \n52. \nRehabilitation  Project  (footnote  15)  will  serve  as  the  PMO  for  this  Project.  The  PMO  will  be \nresponsible  for  (i)  implementing  Project  activities  in  accordance  with  the  Project  design;  (ii) \ncoordinating  activities  between  PIOs  and  other  agencies  concerned;  (iii)  ensuring  compliance \nwith  environmental  requirements  and  other  safeguard  measures;  (iv)  maintaining  appropriate \naccounts,  including  reports  on  withdrawal  applications  and  disbursement;  (v)  carrying  out \nprocurement  activities;  and  (vi)  preparing  quarterly  progress  and  other  reports  in  format \nacceptable  to  ADB.  At  all  times  throughout  Project  implementation,  PMO  remains  adequately \nstaffed with professional and clerical personnel with the necessary experience and expertise in \nfinance, accounting, procurement and contract administration.  \n \n53.  Within  three  months  of  the  loan  effectiveness,  each  of  the  PMO,  MAEP,  and  CES \nestablishes  an  adequately  staffed  PIO.  Each  PIO  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day \nimplementation  of  the  respective  component  of  the  Project,  including  (i)  supervision  of \ncontractors  and  consultants;  (ii)  preparation  of  the  draft  progress  report  and  other  necessary \nrelated documents; and (iii) coordination of the activities under the respective component.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe Project will be implemented from 2008 to 2013 with the project completion expected \n54. \nby December 2013. The closing date for disbursement will be 6 months from the date of project \ncompletion. The implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 7.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n55. \nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  ADB  will  finance  procurement  of  civil  works,  vehicles,  materials \nand  equipment  as  described  in  the  procurement  plan  (Appendix  8).  Contracts  valued  in \nexcess of $1 million will be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB).16  \n\n                                                 \n16  Preference will be given to the domestic contractors for civil works.  \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\nContracts valued at less than $1 million may follow ICB, national competitive bidding (NCB), or \nlimited international bidding (LIB) as determined by the particular circumstances of the contract \npackage.  Procurement  under  NCB  will \nlegislation  on  state \nfollow \nprocurement,  subject  to  modifications  and  clarifications  set  forth  in  the  loan  agreement. \nProcurement  below  $100,000  may  follow  the  shopping  procedure.  The  relevant  sections  of \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  will  be  included  in  all  documents  during  bidding  for,  and \nimplementation of, the Project.    \n \n\nthe  Government\u2019s \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n56. \nThe Project will provide a total of 486 person-months of consulting services, comprising \n72 person-months of international consultants and 414 person-months of national consultants. \nTo  minimize  reliance  on  consultants  and  the  burden  of  consulting  services  costs,  the  input  of \ninternational consultants has been kept to a minimum, restricted in terms of time provided and \nto  areas  for  which  technical  capacity  is  limited  in  government  agencies.  Institutional  and \ncapacity building has been built into the project design.  \n \nThe consultants will assist the executing agency in (i) project management, (ii) legal and \n57. \ninstitutional  arrangements,  (iii)  training  of  staff  related  to  flood  management  activities,  \n(iv)  strengthening  of  embankment  maintenance  capacity,  (v)  preparation  of  a  flood  risk  map,  \n(vi) preparation of emergency plans, (vii) strengthening of the hydrometeorology network, (viii) \nimproving the flood warning system, and (ix) preparation of the feasibility study report on flood \nmanagement for the Yahksu and Kizilsu rivers. An international consultant firm will be selected \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto  time),  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  (QCBS)  method  and  requiring  a  full \ntechnical proposal. The terms of reference of consultants are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed  \n58. \nwith  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the loan and grant regulations and in the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will include the provisions specifying \nthe  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  MLRWR  and  of  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. The \nGovernment  will  undertake  necessary  measures \nto  publicly  disclose  Project-related \nprocurement  actions  such  as  information  on  adopted  bidding  procedures,  specifications  of \ngoods, works and consulting services, participating bidders and award of contracts. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nThe  Loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \n59. \nHandbook,  January  2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time.  To  facilitate  project  implementation \nand funds flow the first-generation imprest account (FGIA) and two second-generation imprest \naccounts will be set up in the commercial banks acceptable to ADB and will be exclusively used \nto  finance  ADB  share  of  eligible  expenditures.  The  first-generation  imprest  account  will  be  set \nup upon effectiveness and managed by PMO. Two second-generation imprest accounts (SGIA) \nwill be set up three months after the loan effectiveness and managed by MAEP and CES. The \nfunds flow to SGIAs will be only from the FGIA of PMO.  The imprest account and each SGIA \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\nwill  be  established,  managed,  replenished  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the Government and \nADB. The currency of the imprest account and each SGIA will be Dollar. The initial amount to be \ndeposited into the imprest account will not exceed the lower of (i) the estimated expenditure for \nthe first six months of Project implementation to be financed from the imprest account, or (ii) the \nequivalent of 10% of the Loan amount. The initial amount to be deposited into each SGIA will \nnot exceed the lower of (a) the estimated expenditure for the first six months of the Project to be \nfinanced from the SGIA, or (b) the equivalent of 10% of the Loan Amount. The PMO will ensure \nthat every liquidation and replenishment of each SGIA from FGIA should be supported with (i) \nthe statement of account (bank statement) prepared by the bank, where SGIA is maintained, (ii) \nSGIA  reconciliation  statement,  reconciling  the  above-mentioned  bank  statement  against  the \nSGIA records, (iii) and supporting documents as required. \n \nThe  direct  payment  procedures  will  apply  for  the  large  works  contracts.  If  the \n60. \nGovernment  initially  funds  eligible  expenditures  from  its  own  resources  the  reimbursement \nprocedures  will  be  used.  To  expedite  funds  flow  and  simplify  documentation  process,  the \nStatement of Expenditures Procedure will be used for liquidation and replenishment of imprest \naccount  and  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $100,000  per  individual \npayment.  The  payments  in  excess  of  the  statement  of  expenditure  ceiling  will  be  reimbursed, \nliquidated or replenished based on full supporting documentation process. \n \n\n7. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n61. \nThe  rehabilitation  and  construction  of  flood  protection  embankments  in  the  Pyanj  river \ncan be done only during the non-flood season (November to April). At the Government\u2019s request \nand  to  facilitate  timely  project  implementation,  ADB  has  approved  the  retroactive  financing. \nWithdrawal from the Loan account will be made for reimbursement of reasonable expenditures \nincurred within the Project before the loan effectiveness, but not earlier than twelve (12) months \nbefore  the  date  of  loan  agreement  in  connection  with  civil  works  for  rehabilitation  of  flood \nprotection  embankment  and  the  Project  related  services,  subject  to  a  maximum  amount \nequivalent  to  20  %  of  the  loan  amount.  The  Government  has  been  informed  that  (i)  advance \naction  for  the  procurement  of  items  other  than  those  covered  under  retroactive  financing  will \ncover actions up to, but not including, contract signing, and (ii) approval of advance action and \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the Project.  \n \n62. \nBecause  of  the  urgency,  the  location  of  the  project  area  adjacent  to  the  international \nborder,  and  the  relatively  simple  nature  of  work,  the  proposed  civil  works  package  for  the \nretroactive financing portion will not be attractive to large international contractors. Therefore the \ncivil works will be divided into five packages for NCB, each of which will be less than $1 million. \nNational  contractors  have  a  good  track  record  of  performance  in  the  construction  of  the  flood \nprotection embankment in Hamadoni district.  \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThe  Government  will  cause  MLRWR,  MAEP,  CES,  the  PMO  and  PIOs  to  maintain \n63. \nseparate  accounts  and  financial  statements  for  the  Project,  which  will  be  audited  annually  by \nindependent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  engage  auditors. \nCertified copies of the audited financial statements will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of \nthe end of the fiscal year to which they relate. A separate opinion on the use of FGIA, SGIAs \nand statement of expenditures procedures will be included in the audit report. The Government \nwas informed of ADB\u2019s  policy on submission of audited accounts, which covers procedures in \nthe event of failure in submitting audited accounts and financial statements by the due date. A \n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\nformal  warning  will  be  issued  for  accounts  that  are  more  than  6  months  overdue  and \ndisbursements will be suspended for accounts that are more than 12 months overdue. \n \n64. \nThrough the PMO, MLRWR will submit quarterly and annual reports to ADB. The reports \nwill  indicate  progress  made  and  problems  encountered  during  the  period  under  review,  steps \ntaken  to  remedy  the  problems,  the  proposed  program  of  activities,  and  expected  progress \nduring  the  remaining  implementation  period.  MLRWR  will  also  provide  such  other  reports  and \ninformation relating to the Project as ADB may reasonably request, including but not limited to \nthe  Project\u2019s  environmental  impacts,  gender  action  plan  and  progress,  dialogue  with \nbeneficiaries,  and  any  social  issues  relating  to  the  Project.  Within  3  months  of  physical \ncompletion  of  the  Project,  MLRWR  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  detailing \nproject implementation, use of the loan proceeds, and the extent to which the objectives of the \nProject have been accomplished. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n65.  Within  three  months  of  the  loan  effectiveness,  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  unit  will  be \nestablished  in  the  PMO  to  monitor  Project  performance,  including  among  other  things, \nenvironmental,  poverty,  gender,  and  social  impacts  and  progress  of  various  reform  measures. \nInformation on monitoring progress will be included in quarterly progress reports. \n \n66.  Within  three  months  of  the  loan  effectiveness,  the  PMO  will  establish  a  Project \nPerformance  Management  System  in  accordance  with  the  Project  performance  indicators \ndescribed in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n67. \nThe Project will be reviewed regularly by ADB missions. ADB and the Government will \nmeet  regularly  as  required  to  discuss  the  progress  of  the  Project  and  any  changes  to  the \nimplementation  arrangements  or  remedial  measures  required  to  be  undertaken  towards \nachieving  the  outcome  of  the  Project.  A  midterm  review  of  the  Project  will  be  undertaken  by \nADB and the Government in 2009. The midterm review will include review of issues concerning \nProject  implementation  arrangements,  institutional,  administrative,  organizational,  technical, \nenvironmental  and  social,  economic,  financial,  and  other  aspects  that may  have  an  impact  on \nthe performance of the Project and its sustainability. The review will assess the compliance with \nloan covenants and agree on any changes required. \n \n68. \nDuring the third year of the Project implementation, the Government and ADB will carry \nout another mid-term review. Project impact will be measured against the performance criteria \nlisted in Appendix 1. The parameters for assessing the implementation milestones will include (i) \nimplementation  status,  (ii)  design  and  construction  standards,  (iii)  physical  progress  and \ndisbursement  in  relation  to  the  implementation  schedule,  (iv)  performance  of  the  consultants \nand contractors, (v) status of compliance with loan covenants, and (vi) status of achievement of \nthe Project\u2019s impact. The midterm review will also assess the need for changes in the Project, \nincluding the project framework, scope, implementing arrangements, monitoring arrangements, \nand  budget,  and  recommended  measures  to  achieve  Project  impact.  The  project  progress \naccording to the SIEE and gender action plan will also be reviewed.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefit \n\n69. \nFlood  management  of  the  Pyanj  river  at  Hamadoni  provides  public  goods  for  the \nrelatively densely populated province of Khatlon. There is therefore a strong rationale for public \nintervention. The Project includes both physical and non-physical components but most funding \nhas been allocated to the rehabilitation or construction of embankments and this is expected to \naccount for most of the easily measurable economic benefits. The economic analysis therefore \nfocused on this activity, although the likely benefits of other activities are also discussed. \n \n70. \nEconomic  analysis  of  the  project  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines \nfor Economic Analysis of Projects (1997) and was based on an analysis of the damage caused \nby  the  July  2005  flood  and  an  extrapolation  to  estimate  the  expected  impacts  of  floods  with \nvarious return periods. The economic value of flood protection was estimated as the economic \nvalue  of  the  losses  avoided  as  a  result  of  investment  in  flood  protection  (the  with-project \nscenario)  compared  with  the  economic  losses  suffered  without  investment  in  flood  protection \n(the without-project scenario).17 \n \n71. \nproposed  embankments  can  effectively  protect  against  floods  with  a  100-year  return  period.   \nThe  economic  analysis  shows  that  the  annualized  benefits  would  be  TJS8.148  million  with  an \neconomic rate of return of 16.0%.  If it is only possible to achieve a low level of maintenance, \nthe  level  of  protection  with  the  project  will  be  reduced  to  a  50-year  return  period  and  the \nannualized level of benefits will be TJS7.038 million with an economic rate of return of 13.7%. \n \nB. \n\nAssuming  that  a  medium  level  of  maintenance  is  achieved,  it  is  considered  that  the \n\nProject Sustainability \n\n72. \nThe financial capacities of the three implementing agencies (MLRWR, the CES, and the \nAgency  for  Hydrometeorology)  were  assessed.  It  was  concluded  that  the  PMO  should  be \nlocated  in  the  MLRWR  because  this  ministry  has  project  management  and  financial \nmanagement  experience  built  up  over  a  number  of  years  and  projects,  notably  the  Irrigation \nRehabilitation Project (footnote 15). Also, the bulk of the proposed loan relates to components \nthat will be implemented by MLRWR. \n \n73. \nThe CES and the Agency for Hydrometeorology have more limited project management \nexperience  and  the  project  components  assigned  to  them  are  of  relatively  low  value.  It  was \ntherefore decided they should each house a project implementation office rather than individual \nproject management offices.  \n \nThe  O&M  of  the  completed  rehabilitation  or  construction  work  has  been  a  key \n74. \nconsideration  for  sustainability  because  of  the  Government\u2019s  previous  inability  to  operate  and \nmaintain  the  existing  flood  management  systems  adequately,  particularly  the  flood  defenses \nand river monitoring network infrastructure. O&M has been discussed with the relevant technical \ndepartments  and  also  at  ministerial  and  Deputy  Prime  Minister  levels.    As  a  result,  a  project \ncomponent  involves  replacing  MLRWR\u2019s  stock  of  depreciated  civil  works  plant  in  Hamadoni \ndistrict with modern machinery, thus lightening the financial burden on MLRWR. To complement \nthis,  the  Government  has  undertaken  to  provide  adequate  funds  for  routine  O&M  of  the  new \nmachinery and flood embankments. The machinery will be used to clean irrigation canals during \nflood season, and will therefore be in use all year round. \n\n                                                 \n17  See Supplementary Appendix C for further analysis of the sector. \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\nC. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n75. \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  has  been  conducted  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003), as well as \nwith Tajikistan\u2019s applicable laws and regulations. The Project is classified as category B. There \nwill  be  no  significant  adverse  long-term  environmental  impacts.  The  construction  of  the \nembankments will have some local impacts on flow pattern and scouring but these effects will \nextend  only  a  few  meters  into  the  river  channel.  As  the  system  and  braided  river  channels \nextend some 5-10 km toward Afghanistan, the wider effects will be insignificant and there will be \nimpacts.  The  socioeconomic  and  environmental  benefits  will  be \nno \nconsiderable,  in  terms  of  improved  security  against  floods.  The  project  will  generate \nemployment  opportunities  during  construction  and  maintenance  of  the  embankments.  The \nsummary initial environmental examination (SIEE) is attached in Appendix 9.  \n \nD. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\ntrans-boundary \n\n76. \nBy  their  very  nature,  floods  force  involuntary  resettlement.  The  core  purposes  of  the \nProject are to assist in the prevention of floods and in the advance preparation of households so \nthey  can  cope  more  effectively  in  areas  where  floods  do  occur.  Land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  needs  have  been  assessed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement \nPolicy (1995), as well as Tajikistan\u2019s applicable laws and regulations. The nature and location of \nthe  proposed  Project  will  not  require  any  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  of  households \nbecause  the  embankments  to  be  rehabilitated  and  the  temporary  access  roads  will  occupy \nabout  10-15  ha  of  government  land.  Most  of  the  construction  activities  will  take  place  on  the \nriverbank of Pyanj which is a depopulated border area. Therefore, no involuntary resettlement \nimpacts  are  envisioned  in  relation  to  the  flood  embankments.  At  the  feasibility  study  level,  no \nland acquisition is expected. However, in case of an unforeseeable change of structure design, \nthere  is  a  possibility  that  unexpected  land  acquisition  may  arise.  Therefore,  a  resettlement \nframework was prepared and agreed by the Government (Appendix 10). In case a small-scale \nland  acquisition  is  required,  an  outline  resettlement  framework  has  been  developed  to  ensure \nthat communities will not be negatively affected.   \n \nE. \n\nIndigenous Peoples  \n\n77. \nAn  assessment  of  the  Project\u2019s  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  was  undertaken  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Indigenous Peoples Policy (1998). According to the population census \nof  2000,  70%  of  the  population  of  the  project  area  is  Tajik,  25%  is  Uzbek,  and  5%  is  ethnic \nminorities  (most  are  married  to  ethnic  Tajiks).  Generally,  non-Tajik  populations  in  southern \nTajikistan  speak  fluent  Tajik  as  well  as  their  native  languages.  They  enjoy  the  same  rights  as \nthe  Tajik  majority,  regularly  intermarry  with  Tajik  households,  and  are  fully  integrated  into \ninstitutional,  cultural,  and  economic  processes.  Consequently,  they  do  not  face  discrimination.  \nThese  groups  are  not  sufficiently  separate  to  justify  classification  as  indigenous  peoples. \nTherefore,  all  ethnic  groups  in  the  project  area  are  equally  positioned  to  benefit  from  the \nstructural and nonstructural measures of the Project. No specific actions for ethnic minorities are \nenvisioned for this project. \n \nF. \n\nGender and Development  \n\nGender  inequality  in  the  project  area  reflects  the  national  situation.  There  has  been  a \n78. \nretreat from the Soviet era emphasis on gender equity, and women are less likely to be found in \npositions of community, business, or government leadership than in previous periods. Women\u2019s \nsalaries are about 40% those of men, and women tend to be clustered in low-wage occupations \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\nsuch as teaching and farm labor. Gender relations are complicated by the significant levels of \nmigration  (40%  or  more)  of  rural  men  to  Russia  to  work,  leaving  women  at  home  to  manage \nfamilies,  farms,  and  other  household  responsibilities.  Under  flood  conditions,  women  and  men \nface  equal  trauma  and  stress,  but  as  women  are  primary  caregivers  and  responsible  for  the \nhousehold and food they face more immediate demands. \n \n79. \nGender  issues  will  be  addressed  by  (i)  including  gender-related  aspects  in  dialogues \nwith central and local governments, stakeholder meetings, and other forums during the Project; \n(ii)  making  specific  efforts  to  include  women  professionals  from  government  offices  in  project \nmeetings  and  decision-making;  (iii)  encouraging  local  contractors  to  employ  women,  including \ndisadvantaged  women;  (iv)  ensuring  that  40%  of  the  trainees  at  CES  flood  awareness  and \npreparedness  training  programs  are  women;  (v)  ensuring  that  50%  of  trainees  in  flood \nmanagement issues at the grassroots level are women. A gender development plan is attached \nin Supplementary Appendix D. \n \nG. \n\nSocial and Poverty Impacts \n\nPoverty is endemic in the project area and, apart from the 6% of the population in white \n80. \nor blue collar jobs or in business, virtually everyone is poor.  Surveys of rural households reveal \nthat floods and other natural disasters are a major cause of poverty.   Field validation revealed \nthe following adverse impacts of previous floods on households in the project area, particularly \nfor the poor:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nloss  of  personal  property,  houses,  and  livestock  and  consequent  damage  to \nfamily living conditions;  \nsignificant declines in income levels; \nemergence of higher levels of disease;  \ndecreased agricultural yields; \n\n(v) \n\ndeterioration in drinking water quality; \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\ndecline in access to essential services; and \nincreased labor migration.   \n\n \nThe population of the project area as a whole will benefit directly from government work \n81. \nto  increase  awareness  of  floods  and  their  effects,  improve  preparedness  for  flood  events  and \nreadiness  to  act  quickly  to  limit  losses,  and  raise  awareness  of  post-flood  actions  to  limit \ndisease, non-agricultural losses, and damage to household goods.  \n \n82.  Work to create both community cohesion and better relations between different levels of \ngovernment  and  community  groups  will  take  place  through  the  loan  and  the  proposed  Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) grant. The result will be better understanding by both sides \nof the conditions and concerns of the poor, which will lead to better information flows on how to \naddress issues of poverty related to disasters. \n \n83. \nA  poverty  and  social  analysis  has  been  conducted  for  the  Project  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Poverty  and  Social  Analysis  (2001).  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and \nsocial strategy for the Project is in Appendix 11. \n \nH. \n\nProject Risks \n\n84. \nThere is a risk that river flow greater than the 100-year flow would damage the project \ncomponents  before  they  are  complete.  There  is  also  a  risk  that  if  the  Pyanj  river  suddenly \nchanges  course  it  would  erode  the  embankments  before  rehabilitation  is  completed.  The \n\n \n\n\f 18 \n\nprobability of these risks is very low, but the PMO and PIOs have to be aware of them and they \nwill need to establish early warning systems to avoid any loss of equipment or other assets.   \n \n85. \nIf  the  quality  of  the  completed  flood  protection  embankment  is  poor  and  not  strong \nenough  to  withstand  the  floods,  the  embankment  will  be  breached  easily.  This  risk  will  be \nmitigated  by  providing  sufficient  numbers  of  supervisory  staff  and  consultants  for  full-time \nsupervision  of  the  contractors.  To  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  staff  in  the  PMO  or  PIOs, \ntechnical and managerial training for supervisory staff will be provided under the Project.  \n \nIf  the  Government  cannot  provide  sufficient  O&M  budget  for  the  completed  flood \n86. \nprotection  embankment,  it  will  be  easily  damaged  by  the  future  floods.  This  risk  has  been \nmitigated  by  including  in  the  loan  agreement  a  provision  for  heavy  equipment  to  maintain  the \ncompleted  embankments  and  a  strong  commitment  from  the  Government  to  provide  sufficient \nbudget for fuel, lubricant and spare parts for heavy equipment, which are clearly mentioned in \nthe loan agreement.    \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \n\n87. \nassurances. \n \nA. \n\nOperation and Maintenance Cost  \n\n88. \nThe  Government  will  annually  allocate  at  least  the  amount  equivalent  to  $50,000  (plus \ninflation since 2007) for maintenance of the flood protection facilities rehabilitated under the \nProject upon their handover by the contractor to MLRWR. \n \n89. \nThe Government will ensure that its actual total annual expenditures for the maintenance \n(including  emergency  maintenance,  but  excluding  rehabilitation  and  construction)  of  the  flood \nprotection  facilities  along  the  Pyanj  river  will  be  increased  by  at  least  at  the  same  rate  as \nincreases in the overall national budget during 2008\u20132013. \n\n \nAmendment of Water Code  \n\nB. \n\n90. \nThe  Government  will  amend  the  existing  Water  Code  and  other  relevant  legislation  to \ninclude the concept of flood management and a more integrated approach to flood damage, and \nto coordinate flood-related ministries and agencies in the Government by the end of 2008.  \n\n \nLand Acquisition and Resettlement   \n\nC. \n\n91. \nThe Government will ensure that (i) no land acquisition is expected and no resettlement \nis  required  under  the  Project,  and  (ii)  Project  activities  are  conducted  within  existing \nGovernment-owned  rights-of-way.    In  the  event  of  any  unforeseen  land  acquisition  or \nresettlement  needs,  the  Government  will  inform  ADB  and  prepare  a  Resettlement  Plan  in \naccordance  with  Government\u2019s  applicable  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995) and the Resettlement Framework.  The Government will ensure that \n(i) no contract is awarded until a Resettlement Plan, if required for the respective Package, has \nbeen  approved  by  ADB,  and  (ii)  no  notice  to  proceed  is  given  to  a  contractor  until  such \nResettlement Plan has been implemented in accordance with its terms. \n \n\n\f \n\nD. \n\nEnvironment  \n\n \n\n19\n\n92. \nThe Government through the EA and the implementing agencies will ensure that project \ncontractors  implement  social  and  environmental  impact  management  in  compliance  with \napplicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  and  per \nrecommendations of the IEE, and will translate the environmental management plan of the IEE \ninto  a  contract-specific  environmental  management  plan,  which  will  be  incorporated  in  the \nbidding documents and civil work contracts. The executing agency will submit an annual report \non  environmental  performance  during  project  implementation.  Compliance  with  all  laws, \nregulations and ADB policies will be answered during operation. \n\n \nGender and Development  \n\nE. \n\nThe Government through the EA will monitor the project impacts on women throughout \n93. \nimplementation,  in  consultation  with  local  governments,  women's  associations,  and  NGOs \nthroughout  Project  implementation.    The  Government  will  ensure  that  within  six  (6)  months  of \nthe  loan  effectiveness,  the  PMO  will  have  developed  the  gender  action  plan.  The  PMO  will \nimplement the gender action plan in a timely manner and will ensure that adequate resources \nare  allocated  for  this  purpose.  The  Government  ensure,  among  other  things,  that  (i)  specific \nefforts  are  made  to  include  women  professionals  from  government  offices  in  project  meetings \nand  decision-making  process;  (ii)  contractors  are  encouraged  to  employ  women,  including \ndisadvantaged  women;  (iii)  up  to  40%  of  the  trainees  at  CES  flood  awareness  and \npreparedness  training  programs  are  women;  and  (iv)  up  to  50%  of  trainees  in  flood \nmanagement issues at the grassroots level are women. \n\n \nEmployment  \n\nF. \n\n94. \nThe  Government  will  (i)  encourage  the  use  of  local  labor  and  procurement  of  local \nmaterials, and (ii) ensure that project contractors (a) comply with applicable labor laws, including \nproviding  for  equal  payment  to  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  type,  in  accordance  with \nnational laws and international treaty obligations, and (b) abstain from using child labor. \n\n \nHealth and Social Risks  \n\nG. \n\n95. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  all  civil  works  contractors  engaged  under  the  Project \ndisseminate information (in local language on the risks of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), \nincluding  HIV/AIDS,  in  health  and  safety  programs  for  all  construction  workers  at  camp  sites. \nSpecific provisions to this effect will be included in bidding documents and civil works contracts, \nand  compliance  will  be  strictly  monitored  by  PMO.  The  Government  will  ensure  strict  border \ncontrol  to  detect  trafficking  of  humans,  wildlife,  endangered  species,  and  illegal  substances  in \nthe Project area. \n \nConstruction Quality  \n\nH. \n\n96. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  flood  protection  facilities  rehabilitated  or \nconstructed  under  the  Project  comply  with  technical  specifications  of  the  design,  and  that \nconstruction  supervision,  quality  control,  and  project  management  is  performed  according  to \ninternationally accepted standards and practices. \n\n \n\n\f 20 \n\nI. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n97. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  ADB  is  kept  informed  about  the  Borrower's  policies, \nstrategies  and  programs  related  to  the  flood  risk  management  that  may  materially  affect  the \nProject. \n \nJ. \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption \n\n98. \nThe  Government  will  (i)  undertake  necessary  measures  to  create  and  sustain  a \ncorruption-free  environment;  (ii)  ensure  that  its  anticorruption  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB's \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) are strictly enforced and are being complied \nwith  during  Project  implementation,  and  relevant  provisions  of  ADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  are \nincluded  in  all  bidding  documents  for  the  Project,  (iii)  facilitate  ADB  in  exercising  its  right  to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Project;  (iv)  ensure  that  MLRWR,  MAEP  and  CES  conduct  periodic \ninspections  on  the  contractors'  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  and  (v) \nensure  that  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  include  provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of MLRWR, MAEP \nand  CES  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants  and  other  service  providers  related  to  the \nProject. \n \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n99. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 14,403,000 to the Republic of Tajikistan for the \nKhatlon Province Flood Risk Management Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an \ninterest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter;  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement \npresented to the Board.  \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda  \nPresident \n \n\n14 September 2007  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources/Reporting \nMechanisms  \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\nDesign Summary \n\nImpact \nReduced flood risks in \nKhatlon province \n\n \nFlood frequency reduced \nfrom 1 in 10  in 2007 to 1 \nin 100 in Hamadoni district \nby 2013 \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nOutcome \nEffective and sustainable \nflood management \nsystems are operational \nand well maintained \n\nOutputs \n1.

\n\n \nA. \n\nGeneral \n\nCOUNTRY AND SECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nTajikistan is a mountainous and landlocked country.  Because of the steep slopes and \n1. \nrugged nature of much of the country, only 7%  of the land area is arable. The main mountain \nranges are the Pamirs in the east of the country, the Gissar Range running east to west to the \nnorth  of  Dushanbe,  and  the  Turkestan  Range  running  parallel  to  the  Gissar  Mountains  just  to \nthe  north  of  the  Zeravshan  river.  The  highest  points  lie  in  the  western  and  northern  Pamirs, \nnotably Mount Somoni at 7,195 meters (m) above sea level. \n \n2. \nThe  climate  is  classified  as  continental  to  sub-tropical,  with  temperatures  strongly \ncontrolled by altitude. At lower altitudes, winter temperatures are occasionally as low as -10\u00b0C, \nrising  to  temperatures  in  excess  of  40\u00b0C  occasionally  in  the  summer.  Snowmelt  in  the \nmountains occurs gradually, taking place from March (in the lower hills) through to August in the \nhigh mountains. There are extensive areas of permanent snow and glaciers within the highest \nmountains. \n \n3. \nRainfall  occurs  predominantly  in  the  winter  and  spring  months  in  the  west,  and  during \nthe  summer  in  the  east.  The  spatial  distribution  of  mean  annual  precipitation  shows  three \ndistinct zones: the low precipitation northern zone; the high precipitation west and central zone, \nand the dry eastern zone.  \n \n4. \nTajikistan  has  a  significant  flood  problem,  arising  largely  from  its  mountainous  nature. \nThe  geologically  young  mountain  system  under  active  erosion  and  steep  mountain  slopes  in \nmany parts of the country creates conditions that easily generate very destructive floods. While \nannual total rainfall values within the country are not high, destructive floods can be caused by \nintensive storm rainfall, with daily falls in excess of 100 mm not unknown. Floods on the larger \nrivers tend to be generated through rapid snowmelt, coupled with periods of heavy rainfall. \n \n5. \n\nFloods have been generated in the past through four main mechanisms:   \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nfluvial  floods,  resulting  from  river  discharges  in  excess  of  channel  capacity \novertopping river banks and causing inundation; \nmudflows  resulting  from  particularly  intense  storm  rainfall  over  steep  and \nunstable catchments;  \nsurface  runoff,  which  washes  down  a  lot  of  soil  and  rocky  debris  resulting  in  a \nmixture of water and alluvium being deposited in the \"outwash\" area of the small \ncatchment; and \noutburst floods caused by the sudden release of water held back in a river by a \nnatural  blockage  and  arising  from  avalanches,  landslides,  mudslides,  glacier \nmovements, and similar processes. \n\n \n6. \nThe  years  1998  and  1999  were  particularly  bad  for  flooding,  and  in  2000  there  was  a \nbad drought. Flood years cause the loss of human lives, damage to thousands of houses, and \ndestruction  of  tens  of  thousands  of  hectares  of  crops,  with  damage  of  the  order  of  tens  of \nmillions  of  dollars.  All  areas  are  affected,  including  the  relatively  densely  populated  southern \nprovince  of  Khatlon.  In  the  years  since  independence,  the  fertile  flood  plains  adjacent  to  the \nPyanj,  Kizilsu  and  Yakhsu  rivers  in  Khatlon  province  have  become  increasingly  vulnerable  to \nfloods. Lives have been lost and flood embankments, houses, canals, land, roads and bridges \nhave been destroyed. Severe floods were experienced in Kulyab, Vose and Farkhor districts in \n1998 and 1999 caused by floods in the Yakhsu and Kizilsu river systems. Smaller floods since \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\nFlood Protection Risk  \n\nthen have caused further damage. A major flood took place in 2005 in Hamadoni district caused \nby the flooding of the Pyanj river. \n \n7. \nThe  most  important  environmental  issue  is  the  conflict  between  agriculture  and \nsettlement  on  the  flood  plains  and  the  naturally  violent  and  unstable  nature  of  the  rivers.  To \nsustain  agricultural  production  and  urban  development,  the  rivers  have  to  be  managed  very \ncarefully.  Unfortunately,  since  independence  in  1992,  this  has  been  beyond  the  means  of \ncentral,  provincial  and  district  governments.  Consequently  there  has  been  progressive \ndestruction of land, property, and infrastructure. \n \n8. \nThe combination of low gross national product (GNP) and high-impact floods and other \nnatural  disasters  on  the  national,  provincial  and  local  economies  is  a  serious  brake  on  social \ndevelopment and economic growth and potentially on political stability. \n \nB. \n \nIn recent years the Government has been forced into a strategy of reactive emergency \n9. \nrepairs which have had to be funded partly by international donors and lenders and partly from \nstate  reserves.  This  is  because  of  a  lack  of  central  recurrent  budgets  for  operation  and \nmaintenance  and  also  because  of  the  inability  of  water  users  to  pay  for  flood  protection.  To \nsome  extent  international  donors  and  lenders  have  been  dragged  into  the  same  strategy \nbecause  of  a  succession  of  serious  natural  disasters  in  Tajikistan  in  recent  years  and  the \nseemingly  unstoppable  social  and  economic  calamities  they  have  caused.  For  its  part,  the \nMinistry of Land Reclamation and Water Resources (MLRWR) has been unable to carry out the \nnecessary routine maintenance work in the project area due to financial constraints.  \n \nC. \n \nThe  primary  flood  management  institutions  are  the  State  Commissions  for  Emergency \n10. \nSituations  (SCES),  the  Committee  for  Emergency  Situations  (CES),  the  MLRWR  and  the \nAgency  for  Hydrometeorology  within  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Environment  Protection \n(MAEP). However, their specific roles and responsibilities with respect to flood management are \nnot completely specified in the underlying legislation and are not integrated or well coordinated \nwithin a coherent flood management system.  \n \n11. \nThe SCES are temporary institutions which are set up at national, provincial, or district \nlevels, in response to the severity and extent of an emergency situation. They comprise senior \nnational and local government members in proportion to the scale of the disaster. The functions \nof  the  SCES  are  to  direct  the  activities  of  the  emergency  services,  manage  resources,  and \ncoordinate local, national and international relief efforts. \n \n12. \nThe CES is responsible for disaster preparedness. Through branch offices at provincial \nand district levels, it promotes disaster awareness and, with increasing assistance from national \nand  international  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  disseminates  early  warnings  and \nprovides  community  training  to  raise  the  level  of  preparedness.  The  CES  has  lacked  the \nresources to deliver a comprehensive programme but improvements are now being made with \nsupport from a number of international donors and programmes. \n \nThe  MLRWR  is  responsible  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  river  banks  and \n13. \nengineering  structures  such  as  flood  embankments  and  intakes  and  outfalls.  District  branch \noffices monitor operations and report maintenance needs. Historically, the MLRWR approach to \n\nFlood Management Institutions \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nExisting Flood Management Performance \n\nthe  construction,  operation  and  maintenance  of  these  structures  has  been  driven  mainly  by \nagricultural  needs,  but  the  increasing  frequency  of  flood  damage  since  independence  in  1992 \nindicates that a revision of this approach is required. \n \nThe  Agency  for  Hydrometeorology,  which  has  recently  become  a  department  of  the \n14. \nMAEP, is responsible for monitoring the natural environment and issuing routine public bulletins. \nIt  also  provides  emergency  advice  to  government  departments  if  potentially  hazardous \ncircumstances are detected.  \n \nD. \n \n15. \nThe  current  approach  to  flood  management  is  now  widely  recognised  by  the \nGovernment and by the donor and  lender community to be unsustainable. There is a growing \nacceptance  that  it  needs  to  be  replaced  by  a  more  holistic  and  strategic  approach  to  flood \nmanagement.  \n \n16.  Maintaining flood protection structures is a considerable challenge for the Government. \nOn the one hand, the main beneficiaries are indebted farmers who cannot afford to pay for all \nthe  water  and  flood  protection  services  that  they  receive.  On  the  other  hand  the  Government \nevidently  cannot  afford  to  carry  out  sufficient  maintenance  work,  partly  because  the  heavy \nmachinery  currently  available  for  maintenance  works  is  generally  more  than  25  years  old, \ndeteriorated and partially unserviceable, and partly because it cannot afford the best available \nmaterials and construction methods.  \n \nThe  design  and  construction  of  flood  embankments  and  spurs  generally  aims  for \n18. \nmaximum land use combined with economy and expediency. However, this approach inevitably \ncreates high maintenance requirements and costs. \n \nAt  present,  monitoring  and  observation  network  consists  of  57  hydrometeorological \n19. \nstations in Tajikistan. However, this network currently does not meet the general internationally \naccepted standard of climate observation. From 1991 to 2005, the national hydrometeorological \nnetwork  was  reduced  by  20%  due  to  the  shortage  of  the  Government  budget  for  proper \nfully  repair  38  hydrometeorological  stations  and  30 \nmaintenance. \nhydrometeorological  posts,  and  reconstruct  6  stations,  10  hydrometeorogical  posts  and  18  air \npollution observation posts \n \nThe existing flood risk on the plains of the Kizilsu and Yakhsu rivers in Kulyab, Vose and \n20. \nFrakhor districts is very high because of the destruction of flood embankments since 1998. At \nleast 15 km of flood embankments have been destroyed. The probability of flooding in certain \nparts may now be higher than 50% (an average chance of flooding once in 2 years). This leaves \ncommunities,  infrastructure  and  valuable  agricultural  land  highly  vulnerable  to  further  loss  or \ndamage on an almost annual basis. In effect there is no flood protection in some places. \n \n21. \nThe  flood  warning  systems,  including  the  hydrometeorological  monitoring  network,  that \nwere  in  place  during  the  Soviet  era  are  now  mostly  inoperative.  However,  there  is  a  warning \nsystem for the Pyanj river at Hamadoni based on the rate of rise of the river level at Khirmanjo, \napproximately  100  km  upstream.  However,  the  warnings  are  inaccurate  because  of  the  poor \ncondition of the river gauge and operational difficulties caused by its location on the Afghanistan \nborder.  A flood warning system has recently been restored on the Yakhsu river at Karboztonak. \nThe  system  is  linked  to  the  Agency  for  Hydrometeorology  in  Dushanbe  and  also,  by  radio,  to \n\nis  necessary \n\nto \n\nIt \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nImpact of Flooding \n\ndownstream  communities.  Other  community  flood  warning  systems  are  being  introduced  or \nproposed by international NGOs such as Mission East and Oxfam. \n \nAccording to the results of the recent ADB technical assistance (TA)1 social survey in the \n22. \nproject area, only 62% of flood victims are aware that flood warning systems exist and only 53% \nhave  actually  received  warnings.  Nevertheless,  there  is  a  consensus  that  early  warnings  can \nhelp  to  limit  flood  damage  but  for  these  to  be  disseminated  successfully  in  villages  and \nneighborhoods,  an  improvement  in  telecommunications  is  essential,  supplemented  by  alarms \nand sirens in high-risk zones. \n \n23. \nFlood  victims  have  recommended  that  emergency  procedures  be  published  as  posters \nand that evacuation drills be stepped up, particularly for women. About 47% of respondents to \nthe survey were prepared to be permanently relocated in order to avoid further flooding, but they \nalso  mentioned  that  this  could  be  a  traumatic  process  because  of  opaque  bureaucratic \nprocedures, poor facilities in the replacement housing stock, and hostility in the new location. \n \nE. \n \n24. \nThe socioeconomic impact of flooding is high and involves substantial loss of livelihoods. \nAccording to the recent TA social survey in Kulyab, Vose, Farkhor, and Hamadoni, only 7% of \nflood  victims  believed  their  income  had  been  below  average  prior  to  flooding,  whereas  71% \nbelieved  it  had  fallen  below  average  after  flooding.  This  correlated  with  their  estimates  that \nproduction  of  grain  had  fallen  by  70%,  of  vegetables  by  83%  and  of  grapes  by  95%. \nRespondents said they had lost 38% of their cattle and 58% of their poultry; 96% of their houses \nhad  been  seriously  or  moderately  damaged;  and  54%  of  their  land  had  been  flooded  and \ninundated with debris.  \n \n25. \nquality, water logging of land, and greater emigration. \n \n26. \nThere has been progressive destruction of land, property and infrastructure, particularly \nsince independence in 1992. Unfortunately, reversing this trend has been beyond the means of \ncentral, provincial, and district governments. \n \n27. \nIn  the  Kizilsu  and  Yakhsu  valleys,  the  rivers  have  been  severely  constrained  between \ntight flood embankments on both sides with the adjacent land heavily developed for agriculture \nand  settlement.  This  rigid  river  training  has  encouraged  the  transport  of  gravel  and  silt  further \ndown  the  valleys  than  would  naturally  be  the  case,  raising  riverbed  levels  and  flood  levels.  In \nKulyab  and  Vose,  the  main  channels  of  the  Kizilsu  and  Yakhsu  rivers  appear  to  have  little \ncapacity  left.  Consequently  the  embankments  have  been  scoured,  overtopped  and  breached. \nFurthermore,  the  lack  of  adequate  maintenance  has  allowed  once  minor  damage  to  spread \nalmost unchecked until it becomes a major issue. In 2007, many villages and farms in Kulyab \nand  Vose  are  highly  vulnerable  to  serious  flooding.  The  practice  of  excavating  river  gravels \nclose to the embankments may have exacerbated the region\u2019s vulnerability. \n \nF. \n \n28. \n\nOther  socioeconomic  impacts  include  increases  in  diseases,  poorer  drinking  water \n\nFlooding is a natural process that supports a variety of natural ecosystems in a river  \n\nScope for Improved Flood Management \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2006.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nthe \n\nbasin, particularly on flood plains. Flood plains are dynamic geomorphologic units in which river \nchannels  shift  from  time  to  time  and  sediment  is  redistributed.  Attempts  to  constrain  a  river\u2019s \nfreedom  to  migrate,  and  to  isolate  it  from  its  flood  plain  so  as  to  exploit  the  land,  create \nimbalances  which  nature  will  always  resist.  Flood  management  concerns \nforced \nmaintenance of these imbalances to protect against irreparable damage to people and property. \n \n29. \nHuman history is partly a record of life adjacent to rivers and coasts and the consequent \noccasional  catastrophes  suffered.  However,  it  is  increasingly  believed  that  floods  can  be \nmanaged and that the risk to lives and assets can be reduced. \n \nFloods  tend  to  affect  the  poor  most. 2 Therefore  it  is  incumbent  on  society  at  large, \n30. \nthrough  its  political,  administrative  and  legal  structures,  to  shoulder  the  main  responsibility  for \nflood management. Community participation is increasingly seen as an important ingredient in \nflood management because of the realization that informed and enabled asset-owning residents \nof flood risk areas can become active protagonists and advocates for flood control, rather than \npassive victims. \n \n31. \nNeither the benefits nor the costs of flood control are easy to assess. For instance, if a \nvillage experiences so much flooding that that lives and property are being lost, then clearly the \nsocial and economic benefits of relocating that village to higher ground must be weighed against \nthe feasibility and cost of protecting the village to an acceptable level. The question arises as to \nwhat is an acceptable level; no deaths at all, one death per ten years, one house lost per year? \n \n32. \nThe  proposed  permanent  flood  management  authority  would  be  funded  from  recurrent \ncore  funds  and  legally  empowered  to  specify,  supervise,  and  coordinate  the  disaster-related \nactivities  of  all \nfor \nHydrometeorology, and the CES. \n \nAmbiguities  in  the  existing  legislation  regarding  responsibility  for  the  dissemination  of \n33. \nflood  warnings  and  responsibility  for  the  design,  construction  and  maintenance  of  flood \nprotection structures need to be corrected. Financial reforms to secure annual funding for flood \nmanagement  activities,  particularly  operation  and  maintenance  of  flood  protection  works,  are \nalso needed. \n \n34. \nFlood  risk  maps  can  be  generated  by  flood  inundation  models  based  on  new \ntopographic  surveys  of  flood  plains,  supplemented  by  social,  environmental  and  economic \nsurveys  to  enumerate  the  extent  and  value  of  the  assets  at  risk.  The  maps  would  be  key \nplanning  tools  with  which  to  delineate  flood  risk  zones.  Appropriate  flood  preparedness \nprogrammes can then be designed for each zone, including annual flood awareness campaigns \nand evacuation drills at district and community levels. \n \n35. \nFlood  forecasting  needs  to  be  based  on  reliable  real-time  monitoring  of  precipitation \namounts  and  river  levels.  Flood  forecasting  models  need  to  be  formulated  and  calibrated \nagainst  reliable  and  accessible  historical  flood  data.  The  possible  effects  of  climate  change \nneed  to  be  included  through  the  application  of  internationally  and  nationally  recognised \nscenarios.  This  will \nfor \nHydrometeorology\u2019s  network  of  climate  stations  and  river  gauges.  The  hydrometeorology \ndatabase  system  requires  rehabilitation  and  updating  in  order  to  facilitate  the  development  of \nthe forecasting models and to furnish a water management archive. \n\nrehabilitation  and  modernization  of \n\nimplementing  agencies,  notably \n\nthe  MLRWR, \n\nthe  Agency \n\nthe  Agency \n\nrequire \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2004.

It  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003).  \n\n \n\nKhatlon province occupies the south-west corner of Tajikistan adjacent to the Uzbekistan \n2. \nborder  to  the  west  and  the  Afghanistan  border  to  the  south.  The  Pyanj  river  forms  the \ninternational  boundary  with  Afghanistan  to  the  south  and  the  Babatag  Mountains  form  the \ninternational boundary with Uzbekistan to the west. The project area (2,800 km2) covers the low-\nlying  parts  of  the  four  districts  of  Hamadoni,  Farkhor,  Vose  and  Kulyab  in  the  southeast  of \nKhatlon  province,  which  comprises  the  merged  flood  plains  of  the  Kizilsu,  Yakhsu,  and  Pyanj \nrivers.  \n \n\n1.  \n\nThe Project \n\nType and Category of Project \n\nThe  Project  will  meet  the  immediate  and  urgent  need  for  improvement  in  the  flood \n3. \nprotection facilities by rebuilding old and damaged embankments in Hamadoni and planning the \nrehabilitation  of  the  damaged  facilities  in  Kulyab,  Vose,  and  Farkhor.  The  project  will  also \nsignificantly  improve  the  ability  of  the  Government  and  local  communities  to  manage  the \nimpacts  of  future  floods  through  greater  flood  awareness  and  preparedness,  improvements  to \nhydrometeorological monitoring, and strengthening of flood warning systems, particularly at the \ncommunity  level.  A  proposed  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  project  will  create  significant \nenvironmental  benefits  for  the  region  through  a  community  forest  program  which  will  re-\nestablish  the  tugai  forest  which  was  progressively  removed  over  the  last  50  years  to  make \nspace for irrigated agriculture and more recently for fuel wood.   \n \nB. \n \n \n \n4. \nThe  Project  will  entail  the  development  of  an  effective  and  sustainable  flood \nmanagement plan for four flood-prone districts in Khatlon province through a balance of physical \nand  non-physical  measures.  The  Project  was  classified  as  category  B  for  environmental \nassessment therefore an IEE was prepared.  \n \n \n \n5. \nThere have been several floods in the project area since the early 1990s, culminating in \nthe  flood  of  June  2005  in  Hamadoni,  which  caused  a  catastrophic  breach  of  the  embankment \nalong  the  Pyanj  river,  flooding  4000  ha  of  land  and  destroying  houses,  roads,  bridges,  canals \nand water towers. The flood waters broke through the embankments near the village of Panjob, \ncausing severe damage in and around the villages of Metintugai, Kalinin, and Faizabad before \ndischarging into  the  Kizilsu  river.  Although  the  2005  flood  was  only  the  fourth  largest  flood  on \nrecord,  it  caused  by  far  the  most  damage.  As  a  result,  the  Government  decided  that  a  flood \nmanagement plan was urgently required to assist affected communities to manage the risk from \nfuture floods. \n \n \n \n6. \n\nThe project consists of physical and non-physical components.  \n\nNeed for the Project \n\nProject Description \n\n3.  \n\n2.  \n\n\fAppendix 9      39   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nThe  physical  components  will  complete  the  missing  link  in  the  flood  protection \nworks   between Sayod Hill and the main embankment that runs from the Chubek \nintake  to  a  point  some  12  km  downstream.  They  consist  of  repairing  and \nstrengthening  the  existing  embankments  and  planting  tugai  forest  by  the \ncommunity.  The forest will act as a buffer zone between the embankments and \nthe irrigated land to the north and will also stabilize the unconsolidated sand and \ngravel and provide renewable fuel wood and animal fodder for communities.  \n\n \n\n1. \n\n \n4.  \n\nGeography \n\nEnvironmental Baseline of the Study Area \n\n The Project is scheduled for implementation from 2007 to 2013. \n\nThe non-physical components will include improvements to flood forecasting and \nwarning,  emergency  planning,  and  other  social,  economic  and  environmental \nbenefits.  \n \nProposed Implementation Schedule \n\n \n \n \n7. \n \nC. \n \n \n \n8. \nThe Pyanj river emerges from a gorge in the Pamir mountains at the Chubek irrigation \nintake. At this point it divides and extends over a large alluvial fan to form an immense system \nof highly mobile braided rivers running between gravel spits, islands, and low vegetation. \n \n9. \n The northern part of the alluvial fan in Tajikistan was reclaimed for irrigated crops by the \nformer Soviet Union. The flood embankments divided the fan and were constructed from sand, \nsilt, cobbles and boulders from the riverbed, protected by stone gabions and reinforced concrete \nblocks.  The  southern  and  much  larger  and  more  untamed  part  of  the  fan  extends  into  \nAfghanistan as far south as the town of Arabkakul. A large area of the Afghan part of the alluvial \nfan  is  consists  of  villages  and  cultivation  on  unprotected  islands  and  spits.  Seasonal  flooding \noccurs throughout this area. \n \n10. \nThe Pyanj river is a major influence on Hamadoni and Farkhor districts as it is the main \nwater  source  for  irrigation.  The  Pyanj  can  cause  occasional  flooding in  Farkhor  via  the  Sairob \nstream and through backing up the Kizilsu river near its confluence with the Pyanj.  \n \n11. \nThe Kizilsu flows along the western side of the project area, first through Vose and then \nthrough Farkhor. The Yakhsu and its parallel river, the Kulyab, flow through Kulyab district in the \nnortheast of the study area. \n \n \n \n12. \nThe  alluvial  flood  plains  in  the  project  area  lie  in  a  geological  basin  called  the  Tajik \nDepression  which  is  formed  of  Jurassic  and  Paleozoic  rocks.  On  the  fringe  of  the  plains  are \nsmooth  contoured  low  loess  hills.  Because  there  is  so  little  productive  land  in  mountainous \nTajikistan, the pressure on the available land for agricultural production and urban settlement is \nextremely  high.  However  because  of  natural  flash  floods,  steep  hydraulic  gradients,  and  high \nsediment loads, settlement and agriculture is always in conflict with natural river processes. \n \n \n\nGeology and Topography \n\n2. \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\n \n\na. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\nb. \n\nGroundwater \n\nSurface water  \n\nWater Resources \n\n \n \n \n \nSurface water resources in the project area are relatively plentiful. The catchment area \n13. \nat Chubek is 114,000 km2. The Pyanj river is the primary source of drinking and irrigation water \nin the project area as it has reliable flows all year round. The Chubek intake delivers water by \ngravity and pumping via a complex canal system throughout most of the project area. However, \nthe river water has a high sediment load, particularly in the spring and summer, which leads to \nheavy sedimentation of the irrigation canal system.  \n \n14. \nThe  Kizilsu  and  Yakhsu  rivers  are  less  reliable  than  the  Pyanj  river  in  terms  of  water \nsupply. The water quality in the Pyanj river is reported to be cleaner than the Kyzylsu, because \nit is much less affected by development. The Kyzylsu changes in quality depending on whether \nit  is  swollen  by  snowmelt  (which  improves  it)  or  by  rainfall  or  runoff  (which  makes  it  worse). \nWater  quality  is  monitored  by  the  Department  of  Analytical  Control  which  has  small  offices  in \nKulyab and Kurgan Tube where a water inspector is based. \n \n \n \nThere  are  significant  reserves  of  groundwater  within  the  Pyanj  alluvial  fan  and  in  the \n15. \nflood plains of the Kizilsu and Yakhsu rivers. The water table is naturally high and therefore the \ngroundwater resources are vulnerable to contamination.  \n \n \n \n16. \nAir quality is outstandingly good since there are no industrial pollutants and relatively low \nvehicular use. However there are seasonal dust storms, especially where vegetation has been \ncleared  to  expose  soil.  Dust  will  be  a  temporary  issue  in  summer  during  the  proposed \nconstruction works. \n \n17. \nThere is a single long winter wet season lasting from October to May. Average monthly \nprecipitation climbs steadily during the autumn and winter to a maximum of 130 mm in March. It \nthen  falls  rapidly  in  April  and  May  and  summer,  from  June  to  September,  is  normally  dry, \nalthough there was heavy monsoonal rainfall and serious flooding in July 1999.  \n \n \n \n18.  Monitoring of glaciers is being carried out by the Agency for Hydrometeorology. Rainfall \nand  temperature  data  collected  over  the  past  50-60  years  indicate  cycles  but  no  significant \ntrends. Increased snowmelt is bound to worsen the problems of summer flooding but there are \nas yet insufficient data to enable forward planning for the lowland valleys.   \n  \n \n \n19. \n\nThe study area comprises six main habitat types: \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nthe steep rocky mountain system of the Pamirs at the eastern end of the site; \nthe rounded loess hills at the western end of the site; \nagricultural  land,  including  cotton  fields  and  orchards  immediately  north  of  the \nriver system; \n\nAir Quality and Climate \n\nEcological Resources \n\nClimate Change \n\n5. \n\na. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9      41   \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nflood  damaged  land,  consisting  of  gravel  which  is  slowly  spreading  with  small \nannuals and mosses;  \nthe  habitats  of  the  Hamadoni  alluvial  fan,  consisting  of  a  network  of  rivers  with \ngravel banks and open water and tugai vegetation on the drier parts of the fan; \nand \nthe river habitats of the Kizilsu and Pyanj valleys. \n\n \n\na. \n\nTugai Vegetation \n\n \n20. \nOf these ecosystems, the most important are the river and associated tugai vegetation. \nFor most of its length the Pyanj river flows either through steep gorges in the Pamirs along its \nupstream  end  or  is  heavily  developed  and  over-abstracted  along  its  downstream  length  in \nUzbekistan. It is only in its middle section between Chubek and Termez that the river is able to \ndevelop substantial adjacent wetland systems. Of these, the Hamadoni alluvial fan appears to \nbe  among  the  most  significant  and  it  is  possibly  the  largest  wetland  system  along  the  central \nriver  section.  Some  80  km  downstream  is  the  Tigrovaya  Balka  Reserve  and  Ramsar  site \nalthough this lies largely on the tributary Vakhsh river.  \n \n \n \n21. \nTugai  vegetation,  which  supports  a  large  range  of  specialized  animals  and  birds,  is  an \nincreasingly  endangered  ecosystem  because  of  clearance  for  farming  and  fuel  wood.  On  the \nnorthern half of the alluvial fan, major tree clearance of the tugai ecosystem took place during \nWorld  War  II.  Over  the  next  40  years,  the  Soviet  administration  restored  the  riverine  forests \nwhich were then largely lost again during the Civil War of 1991\u20131992. The entire low lying area \naround  the  north  of  Sayod  Hill  and  extending  northwest  from  Turdiev  Jamoat  and  part  of  the \nHamadoni  alluvial  fan  was  covered  with  tugai  vegetation  in  the  1930s.  Until  1950,  deer,  boar \nand  pheasant  were  abundant  and  the  Caspian  tiger  was  believed  to  be  present.    In  1950  a \ndeputation went to Moscow for money to reclaim it for agriculture. The result was the foundation \nof  Moscovskie  (Little  Moscow)  and  the  construction  of  surrounding  villages  and  the  Chubek \nirrigation scheme, leading to clearance of the tugai.   \n \n22. \nTugai carries out a moisture-keeping function in the embankment and provides a basic \nplace  of  dwelling  for  some  unique  animals.  Tugai  is  very  useful  in  holding  banks  together \nagainst river erosion and the fact that so much has been cleared on the northern Tajikistan side \nof the river system may partly explain why some of the dominant channels have moved north in \nrecent years, leaving much of the Afghan part of the delta higher as well as far more densely \nvegetated. \n \n \n \n23.  Within the agricultural areas, typical farm birds of Tajikistan can be found. These include \nhoopoe  roller,  bee-eater,  doves,  quail,  corn  crake,  lapwing,  red-backed  shrike,  golden  oriole, \nlarks and most commonly large flocks of myna birds. The cliffs and mountains around Chubek \nsupport wall creeper, eagle owl, griffon vulture, redstarts, and rock thrushes. \n \nDespite extensive hunting, including duck shooting, which takes place on both sides of \n24. \nthe border, the birdlife is clearly very rich on the Hamadoni alluvial fan. This includes year round \nresidents as well as winter migrants.  \n \n \n \n25. \n\nA relative of the sturgeon, Pseudoscaphirhynchus kaufmanii (which is on the  \n\nFish and Fisheries \n\nBirds   \n\nb. \n\nc. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\n \n\ne. \n\nd.  \n\nAnimals \n\nProtected Sites \n\nInternational  Union  for  the  Conservation  of  Nature  Red  List  of  Threatened  Species)  can  be \nfound  throughout  this  section  of  the  Pyanj  river.  In  addition,  numerous  other  fish,  including \nvarious species of barbel and pike-asp, are resident or migrate through the river. There are two \nfish farms in the vicinity of the project area near the Chubek intake.  \n \n \n \n26. \nBefore the intensive hunting which killed many animals on the Hamadoni alluvial fan, it \nwould have supported many species, including the Bukhara red deer, which is also on the Red \nList  and  still  occurs  in  the  Tigrovaya  Balka  Reserve.  Other  species  in  the  area  may  include \njungle cat and jackal. Wild boar, fox, tolai hare, porcupine, Central Asian cobra, green toad, and \nthe world\u2019s largest goat, the markhor, are all present.  \n \n \n \n27. \nThere are no protected sites within or immediately adjacent to the study area. However, \nthere  are  two  important  protected  sites  upstream  and  downstream  on  the  Project  area:  to  the \nnorth  east  is  the  Dashti-Jum  State  Strict  Nature  Reserve  and,  adjacent  to  it,  the  Dashti-Jum \nHabitat and Species Management Area. These reserves were set up to protect the markhor and \npistachio, almond, and cherry forests containing a wide range of iris, anemone, wild onions, and \nfoxtail lilies. \n \n28. \nEighty  kilometers  downstream  of  the  study  area  and  astride  the  Vakhsh  river  is  the \nTigrovaya  Balka  Strict  Nature  Reserve.  This  supports  snow  leopards  and  brown  bears  and \ncontains  the  best  preserved  tugai  ecosystem  in  Tajikistan.  However,  this  reserve  suffers  from \npoaching,  fires,  agricultural  encroachment,  and  water  pollution.  At  its  southeast  corner  is  the \nLower Pyanj river Ramsar site, a wetland area valuable for its birdlife and tugai vegetation. \n \n \n \n29. \nIn the flood plains, the main crops are cotton, cereals, oilseed, potatoes, carrots, onions, \ncucumbers, cabbage, melons, vines, milk, wool, honey and eggs. In addition, orchards or fruit \ntrees grown in yards play an important role in the economy.  \n \n30. \nAdjacent  to  the  main  rivers,  the  stony  riverside  farmland  is  often  more  appropriate  for \nvines, fruit trees, and vegetables, especially onions. Cattle also graze within the taller vegetation \nof the tugai. \n \n31. \nThe rolling loess hills support grazing flocks of sheep, goats, and cattle. In some areas \nthat are not too steep the hills are cultivated for wheat and vines. Steep slopes, especially in the \nmoister  mountainous  parts  of  Tajikistan,  are  cultivated  for  fruit  trees  and  potatoes.  However, \nespecially  in  the  valley  of  the  Yakhsu  near  Kulyab,  the  hillsides  are  too  steep  to  be  used  for \nmuch beyond spring grazing for goats.   \n \n \n \n32. \nThere are two sites relatively near to the project, the Sayod old town situated on Sayod \nHill, some 500 m from the western end of the project works and the Shahidjan graveyard south \nwest of Moscva a few kilometers away. In addition there are four historic sites on the sides of \nthe mountains to the east of the project area: the Dahaneh ruined village north of the Chubek \nintake  together  with  the  Abku  graveyard,  the  Kharareh  Khajeh  tomb,  and  the  Khajeh  Moamin \n\nCultural and Archaeological Resources \n\nLand Use \n\nf.  \n\n6. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9      43   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7. \n\nb. \n\na.  \n\nEconomy \n\nPopulation \n\nSocioeconomic Conditions \n\ngrave further north into the mountains. These sites are all over 10 km away from the proposed \nworks. \n \n \n \n \n \n33. \nKhatlon  province  contains  most  of  the  low-lying  land  in  Tajikistan.  Kulyab  is  the  only \nlarge  town  in  the  project  area.  The  population  of  the  study  area  is  583,700  according  to  the \n2005  census,  only  20%  of  whom  were  in  employment,  mainly  in  the  agricultural  sector. \nApproximately  75%  of  the  population  is  rural.  The  average  monthly  income  in  the  agricultural \nsector is US$15 per month. \n \n \n \n34. \nAgriculture  is  the  main  economic  activity  in  the  region.  Together  with  some  housing, \nagricultural  land  was  the  main  casualty  in  the  2005  floods  in  Hamadoni.  The  irrigation \ninfrastructure, inherited at the end of the Soviet era, suffers from a lack of investment in routine \nmaintenance.  This  has  led  to  a  progressive  loss  of  cultivable  land  and  damage  to \nembankments,  intakes,  and  canals.  \u201dFutures\u201d  contracts  for  cotton  production  effectively  indebt \nthe farming community and limit their disposable income. Therefore rural household incomes in \nthe project area are generally below the Tajikistan average.  \n \n \n \n35. \nVillages and towns have long been developed in the valley bottoms. Some are historic \ncenters  (such  as  Kulyab  town)  but  many  are  relatively  new  towns  created  in  the  Soviet  era \n(such  as  Hamadoni\u2014formerly  known  as  Moscovskie).  Housing  expansion  is  continuing  in  an \nuncontrolled  manner  in  flood-prone  areas  beside  the  rivers.  In  the  low-lying  land  between  the \nYakhsu  and  Kulyab  rivers,  north  of  Kulyab,  there  is  a  new  factory  making  house  construction \nmaterials.   Kulyab  airport  and  much  good  agricultural land  are  located  in  the  valley  in  spite  of \nthe flood risk. \n \n\nUrban Development \n\nc. \n\n \n\nGravel Extraction \n\nd. \n \n\n \n\ne.  \n\nManagement of Upper Catchments \n\n36. \nAlong all the river systems in the study area, gravel extraction for construction materials  \ntakes  place  and  there  are  a  number  of  concrete  factories.  One  northeast  of  Kulyab  has  been \nbadly  flooded.  In  many  places  the gravel  workings  lower  the  valley  bottoms  and  so  may  draw \nthe flood waters toward them and even undermine flood banks.  \n \n \n \n37.  Mismanagement  of  upper  catchments  leading  to  erosion  and  heavy  sedimentation  in \ndownstream river valleys is common throughout the world. Grazing is the main land use within \nthe uplands surrounding the Kizilsu, Yakhsu and Pyanj valleys. There appears to be little or no \nforest cover surviving.  \n \n38.  Where  the  mountainsides  consist  of  Jurassic  and  Paleozoic  rock,  the  problems  of \nerosion are likely to be less acute. Where the hillsides consist of loess or granitic soils, erosion \nis more serious and there is evidence of land slips.  \n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\nf. \n\n8. \n\nImpact of Flooding \n\nExisting Development \n\nIn  Afghanistan,  200,000  people  or  more  inhabit  low-lying  areas  on  and  adjacent  to  the \n\n \n \n39. \nThe  Hamadoni  flood  embankment  divides  the  active  and  inactive  sections  of  the  fan. \nThe  inactive  part  is  now  heavily  developed  with  settlements,  infrastructure,  and  both  irrigated \nand rain-fed agriculture in Hamadoni and Farkhor. The adjacent flood plain of the Kizilsu river \nmerges with the Hamadoni flood plain and has been developed in a similar way. More than half \na million people are located in low-lying areas adjacent to, or influenced by, the Pyanj river. The \nmajority of them depend directly on agriculture for subsistence and income. \n \n40. \nalluvial fan and they are therefore at risk in varying degrees from flooding. \n \n \n \n41. \nAlthough floods are relatively infrequent, there has been considerable direct and indirect \nflood impact from the Pyanj river in Hamadoni and Farkhor districts. This is mainly because of \nthe  failure  of  the  flood  embankments  that  stretch  from  Chubek  to  Metintugai  and  to  a  lesser \nextent  the  flood  embankments  between  Sayod  Hill  and  Arabkakul  in  Farkhor  district.  Site \ninspections and discussions with officials indicate that minor failures have occurred from time to \ntime over many years, but the major breach near the village of Panjob in 2005 was by far the \nworst. The cumulative impact has been a permanent loss of agricultural land due to smothering \nwith gravel and temporary loss of infrastructure such as roads, canals and buildings. There has \nalso  been  indirect  flood  impact  in  outlying  areas  in  Farkhor  and  Vose  because  the  supply  of \nirrigation water has been interrupted. \n \n42. \nThe Kizilsu, Yakhsu and Kulyab rivers run parallel to each other in the relatively narrow \nand  well  populated  valley  which  constitutes  the  main  settled  land  in  Kulyab  district.  They  flow \nthrough  non-cohesive  gravels  at  a  steep  gradient  and  are  highly  mobile.  They  create  major \nflooding  problems  throughout  the  valley  and  as  a  result  the  whole  valley  needs  to  be  treated \nholistically rather than piecemeal. \n \n43. \nIn Kulyab town, the Tebolai river creates environmental and flooding challenges that are \ndisproportionate  to  its  small  size  as  it  flows  through  the  town.  Severe  environmental  issues \nalong  the  Tebolai  include  flooding  and  inundiation,  threats  to  public  health,  resettlement, \nschools  and  a  prison.  The  flooding  and  pollution  problems  of  the  river  and  the  potential  for \nupstream flood control structures such as check dams need to be addressed. \n \n44. \nThe  alluvial  fan  and  the  flood  plain  start  from  the  narrow  upstream  mountain  defile \nbetween Chubek in Tajikistan and Yateh Tepa in Afghanistan and end in the valley constriction \nat  near  Arabkakul  in  Afghanistan,  some  25-30  km  downstream.  Nearly  all  the  active  fan  and \nflood plain lies in Afghanistan. Although there appears to be no formal development in this area, \nit is populated by at least 200,000 people, most of whom practice subsistence agriculture using \nself-help irrigation schemes and stock grazing. The lack of any formal flood protection or flood \nmanagement  schemes  in  this  area  means  that  there  is  a  significant  and  severe  risk  of  flood \ndamage.  The  2005  flood  caused  considerable  damage  to  communities  in  Afghanistan. \nAnecdotal  reports  suggest  that  at  least  16,500  ha  of  irrigated  land  and  25,000  farm  animals \nwere lost. \n \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 9      45   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nD. \n\n \n45. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n46. \n \n\nScreening  of  Potential  Environmental  Impacts  of  the  Project  and  Mitigation \nMeasures \n\nThe  potential  impacts  from  the  project  have  been  assessed.  Those  activities  that have \nno  potential  to  cause  a  significant  environmental  impact  have  been  screened  out, \nallowing the impact assessment and the development of mitigation measures to focus on \nthe  significant  issues.  The  non-physical  components  of  the  Project  will  not  have  any \nenvironmental  impacts  and  so  are  not  assessed  here.  The  key  issues  identified  during \nthe screening process were:  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nthe potential for indirect, trans-border impacts affecting Afghanistan, \nimpacts on ecological resources, \nimpacts on cultural resources, \nimpacts on water resources and fisheries, and  \nimpacts from construction activities. \n\n1. \n\nIndirect and Trans-boundary Impacts Affecting Afghanistan \n\nThe project will involve works at three locations: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\napproximately  700  m  of  river  bank  protection  at,  and  immediately  upstream  of, \nthe Sayod Hill border post; \napproximately 3.5 km of river bank protection near Metintugai village; and  \nreconstruction and extension of an existing old flood embankment of 4.8 km as a \nguide to discourage the river flow from approaching the Dekhanabad canal and \nthe Metintugai village area.  \n\n \n47. \nThe original flood embankments were constructed along the northern edge of the Pyanj \nriver  alluvial  fan  some  50  years  ago  to  protect  the  irrigated  land  as  it  was  developed  to  the \nnorth.  This  significantly  reduced  the  active  area  of  the  alluvial  fan  and  is  likely  to  have  led  to \nchanges in the hydraulics and topography of the upper fan near Chubek by restricting the lateral \nmovement  of  river  channels  and  gravel  bars.  It  is  also  likely  that  there  were  changes  to  the \nconfiguration of sand and silt islands further downstream.  However, after more than 50 years, \nthe  alluvial  fan  will  have  completely  adjusted  to  the  presence  of  the  embankments.  Therefore \nthe proposed rehabilitation will not alter the conditions that have been present for more than 50 \nyears. \n \n48. \nThe proposed works will have some local impacts on flow patterns and scouring as they \nare  situated  adjacent  to  the  river,  but  these  effects  are  unlikely  to  extend  more  than  a  few \nmeters into the nearest river channel. As the system of braided channels extends some 5-10 km \nacross from Hamadoni toward Afghanistan, the wider effects will be insignificant. Therefore no \ntrans-boundary \nflood \nembankments. \n \n \n \n49. \nVegetation has little chance to become established at the northern end of the alluvial fan \nas flood flows scour away any plant that has managed to establish itself. At the southern end of \nthe  fan,  the  velocity  of  flows  decreases  to  a  point  where  tugai  vegetation  can  become \nestablished  and  survive  the  flood  flows.  Before  the  land  was  cleared  for  agriculture,  tugai \nvegetation was present along the river banks and on the northern part of the fan.  \n\nImpact on Ecological Resources \n\nimpacts  are  anticipated \n\nthe  rehabilitation  of \n\nin  relation \n\nthe \n\n2. \n\nto \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nThe ecological value of the project area is high and the alluvial fan can be considered to \n50. \nbe a wetland of international importance. The proposed project works have a small footprint and \nthey  are  located  along  2.7  km  of  the  northern  edge  of  the  present  tugai  and  braided  river \nsystem, which covers an area of approximately 100 km2. Therefore the impacts of the proposed \nproject on the ecological resources will be local and will not have any significant impact on the \ntugai vegetated islands to the south of the embankments. \n \n51. \nThere will also be no adverse impact on protected nature conservation sites, since these \nare too far away. The nearest reserves at Dashti-Jum are 20 km upstream and only reachable \nby boat through an otherwise impassable gorge. The Tigrovaya Balka Reserve and the adjacent \nRamsar site are 80 km downstream.  \n \nThe  river  bank  protection  near  Sayod  Hill  will  replace  the  existing  vertical  eroding  cliff \n52. \nwith a shallower slope of dumped stone. This means that potential nesting habitat for kingfishers \nor sand martins will be lost but there is no current evidence that they  are nesting in this bank \nand  there  are  plenty  of  other  potential  nesting  sites  in  eroding  cliffs  in  this  immense  deltaic \nsystem.  In  addition,  the  rocks  may  create  habitats  for  reptiles  and  even  otters,  which  occur  in \nthe area. \n\n \n \n\n \n\na.  \n\nEcological Enhancement of the Project Area \n\n3. \n\n53. \nTugai is the most important and threatened habitat within the study area as well as being \na  major  tool  in  the  management  and  control  of  the  river  system.  A  community  forest  will  be \nplanted  along  a  strip  of  unconsolidated  sands  and  gravel  behind  the  embankments  and  will \ncover  an  area  22  km  long  and  1  km  wide.  The  aim  is  to  recreate  tugai  vegetation  that  would \nhave  existed  in  this  area  before  it  was  cleared  for  agriculture.  The  willows,  poplars  and  reeds \nand  grasses  that  characterize  tugai  vegetation  have  evolved  over  many  millennia  to  survive \ninundation  by  flooding.  The  community  alluvial  forest  will  enhance  the  project  at  a  number  of \nlevels.  First,  the  growth  of  the  vegetation  will  help  to  bind  up  the  unconsolidated  sands  and \ngravels. Once it is mature it will help to dissipate the power of any future floods that breach or \novertop the embankments. Second, it will provide a sustainable source of fuel wood for the local \ncommunity.  Third,  it  will  be  an  important  ecological  resource  as  it  will  re-establish  the  natural \nvegetation community of the area. This component will be funded by a Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction  (JFPR) grant. \n \n \n \n54. \nThere is unlikely to be a significant impact on cultural resources, as the nearest are over \n500 m from the western edge of the project area. In the case of bank reinforcement near Sayod \nHill a watching brief will be needed because of the proximity of the Samaneid settlement known \nas Sayed old town. \n \n \n \nThe rehabilitation of the flood embankments will have no effect on the quantity or quality \n55. \nof  available  water  resources  in  the  project  area.  It  is  possible  that  the  river  water  immediately \nadjacent to the works may be become temporarily polluted but this risk will be addressed in the \nenvironment management plan (EMP). \n \n56. \nResearch suggests that there is a likelihood of increased precipitation in the catchment \nof the Pyanj river as a result of climate change. However, current computer models are not able \n\nImpact on Water Resources and Fisheries including Climate Change \n\nImpacts on Cultural Resources \n\n4. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9      47   \n\n \n\nto  predict  changes  at  a  regional  or  subregional  level.  Increased  snowmelt  is  bound  to  worsen \nthe problems of summer flooding but there are as yet insufficient data to reflect this in forward \nplanning  for  the  lowland  valleys.  Sufficient  freeboard  has  been  included  in  the  design  of  the \ndykes to cope with the flows likely to be encountered in a 1 in 100-year flood. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. \n\nConstruction Impacts \n\na.   Water Quality and Sediment Control \n\n \n \n57. \nThe  construction  of  the  embankments  and  the  bank  strengthening  works  have  the \npotential to cause a number of minor temporary environmental impacts. These may arise from \nthe  location  and  management  of  work  camps  and  haul  roads;  dust,  noise  and  vibration; \nprocurement of construction materials such as rocks and river cobbles; liquid discharges; waste \ncollection and storage; and illegal hunting. \n \n58. \nThe implementation of an effective environmental management plan (EMP) will manage \nand  mitigate  these  impacts.  An  outline  EMP  is  included  in  the  IEE.  The  EMP  will  be  further \ndeveloped  during  the  detailed  design  phase  and  implemented  before  the  start  of  the \nconstruction works. It will contain procedures and plans to ensure that mitigation measures and \nmonitoring requirements are implemented during the construction period. \n \n59. \nAll civil works will be designed and operated in accordance with environmentally sound \nengineering  practices  and  governed  by  ADB  and  Tajikistan\u2019s  environmental  standards.  Works \nwill  require  the  use  of  heavy  machinery  (e.g.,  excavators  and  bulldozers)  but  will  be  small  in \nscale and will not take place on lands already used for agriculture. \n \n \n \n60. \nHeavy  plant  such  as  cranes,  bulldozers,  backhoes,  and  trucks  will  be  required  for  the \nconstruction  and  repair  of  the  embankments.  Large  quantities  of  cobbles  and  gravel  will  be \nmoved during this process. There is potential for large amounts of sediment to be released into \nthe  river  during  this  period  if  the  construction  activities  are  undertaken  in  an  uncontrolled \nmanner. In order to prevent excessive amounts of additional sediment being discharged into the \nriver,  environmental  management  measures  will  be  introduced.  These  will  include  control  of \nvehicle  movements,  limiting  the  construction  footprint,  and  scheduling  the  construction  work \nduring the dry season.     \n \n61. \nA small construction camp is likely to be needed by the contractor. Activities at the camp \nneed to be conducted in a manner that ensures no pollution of nearby water bodies. Operations \nat  the  camp  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  accepted  international  best  practice  for \nconstruction  camps  and  will  include  waste  management,  hazardous  materials  storage,  correct \nstockpiling of construction materials and fuel, and prevention of pollution.  \n \n62.  Monitoring will be undertaken to ensure effective implementation of the measures listed \nabove. An environment officer will be required to monitor levels in the river and ensure that any \nsediment  generated  by  the  project  is  not  significantly  in  excess  of  background  levels.  In  the \nevent of an excess, appropriate management measures will need to be implemented. \n \n \n \nRoad  haulage  will  feature  prominently  in  the  construction  phase.  The  social  and \n63. \nenvironmental  impacts  of  this  increase  in  road  traffic  are  potentially  significant,  with  excessive \ndust generation, noise and vibration being the major concerns. \n\nAir Quality, Noise, and Vibration \n\nb.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\nc. \n\nHazardous Materials and Waste Management \n\nThe  effectiveness  of  these  measures  will  need  to  be  closely  monitored  and  regular \n\nThe existing road network offers two possible routes from the quarry to the work site in \n64. \nHamadoni, a public road which passes through villages and a military road which does not pass \nclose to settlements. \n \nThe  military  road  would  be  preferable  for  project  use,  subject  to  approval  of  the \n65. \nauthorities.  This  road  would  require  some  rehabilitation  before  the  hauling  of  rock  from  the \nquarry begins. However, it is possible that this road will not be available. If the public road has to \nbe used, a number of mitigation measures will need to be introduced to manage dust, including \nwatering of roads and enforcement of speed limits for project vehicles. \n \n66. \ncontact with affected households and communities will need to be undertaken.  \n \n \n \n67. \nDuring  the  construction  period  a  wide  range  and  substantial  volumes  of  waste  may  be \ngenerated  including  gravel;  concrete;  miscellaneous  structures  such  as  culverts,  poles  and \ncables; steel; organic material, such as cleared vegetation, timber; and soil. In addition there will \nbe  oils,  fuel,  grease  and  chemicals  from  plant,  equipment  and  vehicle  servicing.    Hazardous \nmaterials will need to be stored and handled correctly to prevent spills and pollution.  \n \n68. \nAn emergency spills contingency plan will be prepared as part of the contractor\u2019s EMP. \nThe environment officer will monitor the effectiveness of the management measures during site \ninspections. \n \n \n \n69. \nThe  EMP  outlines  the  relevant  environmental  regulations,  institutional  responsibilities, \nmitigation  measures  and  monitoring  needed  to  comply  with  the  environmental  assessment \nrequirements of the Government of Tajikistan and ADB. The EMP will be updated based on the \ndetailed design and will be revised by the contractor once the contract has been awarded. The \nproject  management  office  at  the  implementing  agency  is  responsible  for  implementing \nmitigation  measures  and  monitoring  during  construction  and  operation.  A  budget  has  been \nallocated for environmental management and monitoring.  \n \n70.  Monitoring  of  the  potential  impacts  from  construction  of  the  embankments  will  be \nundertaken by the PMO in conjunction with the MLRWR.  \n \nE. \n \n\nLegal and Institutional Requirements \n\nEnvironmental Management Plan \n\n6. \n\n1. \n\nLegal Framework \n\n71. \nSince  independence,  Tajikistan  has  developed  a  framework  of  environmental  laws, \nregulations,  and  policies.  These  mandate  that  environmental  impact  should  be  assessed; \nconsequences identified; ecological and economic studies carried out; and measures to mitigate \npossible  negative  impacts  identified  before  the  implementation  of  a  project.  Environmental \nlegislation  includes  laws  on  air  quality,  mineral  resources,  land  management,  forests,  animals \nand  factories,  health  and  safety  and  waste  and  chemicals  management.  A  Framework \nEnvironment Law was adopted in 1993 and amended in 1996. The Water Code was adopted in \n2000, the Land Code in 1992, and the Land Administration Code in 2001. \n \n\n\fAppendix 9      49   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nProject Approvals  \n \n\n3. \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\n72. \nThe Tajikistan Environment Law (1996) requires that the IEE for this project be reviewed \nby the State Committee of Ecologic Expertise. The committee reviewed and endorsed a draft of \nthe IEE in May 2007, so the project now has government approval. \n \n \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Land  Reclamation  and  Water  Resources  (MLRWR)  is  the  Executing \n73. \nAgency (EA) of the Project. The project management office (PMO) will be set up in the MLRWR \nwith project implementation offices in the Committee for Emergency Situations (CES) and in the \nAgency  for  Hydrometeorology,  under  MAEP,  for  the  flood  forecasting  and  flood  risk  mapping \ncomponents, and a site office under MLRWR in Hamadoni. \n \n74. \nThe State Control Service for Nature Use and Protection (SCSNUP) which is under the \nMAEP  (formerly  the  State  Committee  for  Environmental  Protection  and  Forestry)  is  the  final \nauthority for environmental approval.  \n \n75. \nTo  ensure  contractors  comply  with  environmental  regulations  and  standards,  SCSNUP \nand  MLRWR  will  undertake  regular  inspections.  Regular  monitoring  of  water  quality  during \nrehabilitation  works  will  be  conducted  by  the  regional  analytical  laboratory  (SCSNUP).  The \ninspections will cover all relevant issues, including the use of appropriate materials and possible \nclaims made by the affected people. The construction surveillance engineer will be responsible \nfor  setting  up  meetings  between  the  parties  and  arranging  work  schedules  (e.g.,  hours  of \nequipment operation and traffic lanes).  \n \n \n \n \n \n76. \nThe PMO will be headed by a full-time project director. Staff will have expertise in project \nmanagement,  hydrology  and  embankment  engineering,  finance,  and  socioeconomic  and \ncommunity  development.    The  PMO  will  also  incorporate  all  consulting  services  under  the \nProject, including assistance to the EA and the concerned district office  \n\nProject Management Office (PMO) \n\nRoles and Responsibilities \n\n4. \n\na. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n77.  Mitigation  measures  incorporated  into  the  design  will  be  verified  by  the  PMO  before \ntechnical approval is given. The mitigation measures that form part of the contract documents \nwill also be verified by the PMO before the contract is signed by the PIO and the Contractor. \n \n\nb.  \n\nProject Implementation Office (PIO) \n\n \n78. \nThe  PIOs    will  be  headed  by  engineers  and  each  will  have  four  sections  (i)  project \naccounts,  (ii)  construction,  (iii)  environment  and  social  development,  and  (iv)  operations  and \nmanagement.  Assisted  by  project  consultants,  PIOs  will  be  responsible  for  construction \nsupervision, local procurement, and engineering and environmental control. \n \n\nc. \n\nContractors \n\n  \n \n79. \nThe  contractors  will  provide  the  PMO  with  monthly  reports  on  the  implementation  of \nmitigation  measures.  Their  reports  will  be  consolidated  with  the  quarterly  monitoring  reports \nprepared by the project consultants and submitted to PMO for review. \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nF. \n\nCommunities \n\nConsultations  \n \n1. \n \nStakeholder  consultations  were  conducted  at  the  district  and  community  offices  in \n80. \nHamadoni. At these meetings the purpose and components of the project were presented along \nwith the benefits and potential impacts. The agendas of the meetings covered the following: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nenvironmental aspects of the flood management project; \nresults and proposals of the feasibility study; \ncommunity feedback on proposed structural and nonstructural measures; \ncommunity willingness to contribute to the flood management project; and  \nestablishment  of  community  focus  groups,  enabling  community  representatives \nto  have  a  regular  dialogue  with  the  project  staff  as  a  part  of  a  long-term \ncommunity engagement strategy. \n\n \nIn  addition,  several  villages  were  visited  and  residents  were  informed  about  the \n81. \nproposed  interventions  and  asked  about  their  perceptions  of  the  Project.  The  results  of  the \nconsultations  were  positive.  All  the  participants  considered  that  the  Project  would  result  in \nbeneficial  agricultural,  environmental  and  public  health  impacts  and  that  there  would  be  no \nadverse  effects  during  the  construction  phase,  as  the  project  site  will  be  away  from  their \nsettlements, near the border area between Tajikistan and Afghanistan.  They were informed that \nno land acquisition and resettlement of households would be required.  \n \n82. \n \n\nA brief summary of the participant\u2019s views with regard to the project follows.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  participants  unanimously  concluded  that  the  Project  would  strengthen \nsustainable  flood  protection  and  management,  and  flood  and  emergency \npreparedness. This would promote development and reduce the risk of damage \nto houses and orchards, and prevent the degradation of banks.    \nThe  participants  expected  that  the  Project  would  promote  sustainable  and \neffective  use  of  environmentally  sustainable  management  practices.  They \nbelieved  that  rehabilitation  and  improvement  of  embankments  would  improve \nefficient water use and reduce flood damage and further erosion. \nAs  a  result,  the  project  was  considered  technically  feasible,  environmentally \nsound,  and  socially  acceptable  and  the  residents  said  they  would  provide  full \ncooperation for its successful implementation.  \nParticipants said that such meetings were very useful as they were not aware of \nenvironmental assessment needs or of the rights and responsibilities of residents \nand  their  role  in  the  project  realization.  They  recommended  that  more  attention \nbe given to (a) sensitizing residents to the environmental impacts and their duties \nand \ntechnical  principles  of \nreviewing  general  and \nenvironmental procedures and the role of government and private agencies; and \n(c) educating residents about legislation, norms and procedures and suggesting \nmodifications for improvements.  \n\nresponsibilities, \n\n(b) \n\n \n83. \nTo  assess  any  trans-boundary  issues  and  possible  impacts  of  the  proposed  project \nworks  in  Afghanistan,  data  and  information  were  collected  during  a  series  of  site  visits  in \nAfghanistan.  The  field  teams  comprised  consultants  from  the  Khatlon  Province  Flood \nManagement  Project  team  in  Dushanbe,  an  ADB  consultant  from  Afghanistan,  and  staff  from \nthe  Afghanistan  Ministry  of  Water  and  Electricity  (MEW)  and  the  Afghanistan  Natural \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9      51   \n\n \n\nExpert Consultations \n\nEnvironment Protection Agency (NEPA).1 They found considerable flood damage in Afghanistan \nbut  there  was  no  significant  evidence  that  this  was  caused  by  the  presence  of  the  flood \nembankments at Hamadoni or that the proposed rehabilitation would make the situation worse.  \n \n \n\n2. \n \n84. \nExtensive consultation with key individuals has taken place, including with experts of the \nRegional Environmental Centre for Central Asia, Kuhiston Foundation, the national focal point of \nthe  environmental  impact  assessment  EIA  Convention  in  Tajikistan,  the  head  of  the  SCSNUP \nunder  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Environment  Protection,  the  secretaries  of  pilot  jamoats, \nDepartment of Labor for Hamadoni district,  elders and villagers within the study area, experts \nfrom  the  Irrigation  Rehabilitation  Project, 2 the  PMO  for  the  Irrigation  Rehabilitation  Project, \nOxfam  GB  Kulyab,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  the  CES,  Department  of \nEnvironment  and  Protection,  Deputy  Chairman  of  Hamadoni  district,  and  the  Head  of  State \nEcological Expertise (SCSNUP under MAEP). \n \nKey  individuals  consulted  in  Afghanistan  included  representatives  and  experts  from \n85. \nKunduz  province,  Takhar  district,  Department  of  Water  Management  (Kunduz),  Department  of \nAgriculture  (Kunduz),  Project  Coordination  Unit  and  Emergency  Irrigation  Rehabilitation \nProgram (PCU/EIRP), Aga Khan Development Network Foundation (AKDN), Baghlan, and the  \nKunduz River Basin Programme (KRBP). \n\n \nFindings and Recommendations \n\nG. \n \nThe  study  area  lies  adjacent  to  the  border  between  Tajikistan  and  Afghanistan.  It  is \n86. \ntherefore  a  zone  of  great  political  sensitivity.  Consultations  on  both  sides  of  the  border  at \nprovincial and district levels revealed common interests in flood management and a willingness \nto  cooperate.  This  positive  sentiment  needs  to  be  officially  encouraged  and  backed  up  with \nformal bilateral agreements at Government level. \n \n87. \nThere  is  currently  a  high  risk  of  flooding  from  the  Pyanj  river  in  both  Tajikistan  and \nAfghanistan. Climate change is likely to increase this risk. In the case of Tajikistan, the risk can \nbe  substantially  reduced  by  the  immediate  rehabilitation  of  the  damaged  and  understrength \nflood  embankments  and  spurs  at  Hamadoni.  Flood  damage  could  be  further  mitigated  if  the \nTajikistan  authorities  were  to  extend  their  flood  forecasting  and  warning  systems  to  the \nAfghanistan authorities. \n \n88. \nFrom the limited information available, there is no conclusive technical evidence that the \nHamadoni flood embankments and spurs have significantly increased flood risks in Afghanistan. \nIt  is  true  that  the  Hamadoni  flood  defenses  have  reduced  the  dynamic  area  of  the  alluvial  fan \nand the bed level of the upper gravel fan may have risen as a result. However flood flows in the \nPyanj do not, and probably never did, inundate the entire width of the fan at once. Rather, the \nflows follow unstable channels according to local temporary hydraulic conditions. From time to \ntime the courses of these channels change erratically. According to satellite imagery, the current \nchannel  system  is  oriented  toward  the  right  bank  in  Tajikistan  and  therefore  poses  a  smaller \nthreat to Afghanistan than may have been the case in the past. \n\n                                                 \n1   The  summary  IEE  was  translated  into  the  Dari  language  and  delivered  to  concerned  Afghanistan  government \noffices in July 2007. The mission met with Afghanistan officials and explained the scope of the Project in July 2007.  \n\n2   ADB. 2004. Irrigation Rehabilitation Project. Manila, for $22.72 million equivalent, approved on 10 December. \n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n89. \nThe  Hamadoni  alluvial  fan  is  an  important  wetland  feature  that  exhibits  a  range  of \nhabitats, flora, and fauna. Generally, these ecosystems are now rare elsewhere in Central Asia. \nThe  Afghanistan  side  of  the  fan  is  less  disturbed  than  the  Tajikistan  side.  The  less  populated \nparts  merit  a  formal  environmental  designation  at  international  level  in  order  to  limit  further \ndevelopment and to conserve important ecosystems. \n \n90. \nSo long as an effective environment management plan is enforced during civil works, no \npermanent  negative  environmental  impacts  are  anticipated.  Because  these  works will  be  local \nand  orientated  mainly  in  the  direction  of  the  stream,  their  impact  on  the  environment  will  be \nminimal.  Careful  design  of  the  works  may  ultimately  enhance  the  environment  by  stabilizing \nriver  banks  and  encouraging  the  re-establishment  of  natural  and  sustainable  habitats.  There \nmay  be  limited  temporary  impacts  resulting  from  construction  activities,  but  these  can  be \nmanaged and minimized by the imposition of a robust environmental management plan. \n \n91. \nThe  main  environmental  issue  associated  with  the  Project  is  its  potential  impact  on \nwatercourses and tugai vegetation on the alluvial fan. However, the design strategy minimizes \nthe impact on habitat and agriculture by restricting operations to areas of gravel with minimum \nvegetation. \n \nThere will be no negative impact on nature reserves as they are too far away. Impacts \n92. \nresulting from construction, especially where a new bank protection is being constructed in the \nimmediate vicinity of Metintugai, will have only very local impacts, which will be minimized by a \nrobust EMP.  \n \n93. \nAssuming that the JFPR proposal for re-establishing tugai is accepted and successfully \nimplemented and that the project provides the anticipated flood protection benefits, the overall \nenvironmental  impact  of  the  flood  protection  works  in  Hamadoni  district  will  be  \u201dhighly \nbeneficial\u201d. \n \n94. \nThere  is  clearly  a  need  for  coordinated  planning  especially  for  the  Yakhsu  and  upper \nKizilsu  valleys,  which  can  be  facilitated  by  existing  legislation.  An  agreed  zoning  plan  for  the \nvalleys  based  on  flood  risk  maps  showing  areas  zoned  for  agriculture,  housing,  and  gravel \nextraction tied to an accurate mapping base is needed.  \n \nH. \n\nConclusions \n \n95. \nThe project will have significant environmental and social benefits and, if the prescribed \nmitigation  and  management  measures  are  fully  implemented,  the  project  is  unlikely  to  have \nmajor adverse environmental impacts. An environmental management plan has been prepared \nand responsibilities for implementation assigned. A budget has been allocated for environmental \nmanagement  and  monitoring.  A  full  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  is  not  required \nunder ADB guidelines. \n \nThe rehabilitation and reinforcement works will take place on and near the right bank of \n96. \nthe Pyanj river in Hamadoni. These works will involve earth works using on-site alluvial deposits \nfollowed by placement of concrete blocks (manufactured off-site), dumped rock (obtained from a \nquarry 55 km away) and stone filled gabion cages (assembled on site). \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9      53   \n\n \n\nThe non-structural components of the Project will have no environmental impacts except \n97. \nin the case of the rehabilitation of river gauging stations and climate stations where very minor \nconstruction work will be necessary. \n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nRESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n\nBackground \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  Khatlon  Province  Flood  Risk  Management  Project  will  reduce  the  risk  of  socio-\n1. \neconomic  losses  caused  by  floods  in  the  Farkhor,  Hamadoni,  Kulyab  and  Vose  districts  of \nKhatlon  province  through  a  holistic  and  coordinated  approach  of  the  physical  protection \nmeasures  and  non-physical  measures,  such  as  flood  preparedness,  forecasting  and  warning, \nand community participation. The institutional and legal framework will be strengthened during \nproject  implementation,  taking  full  account  of  social,  environmental,  and  economic  factors.  To \nachieve  this,  the  Project  has  four  main  components:  (i)  policy  reform;  (ii)  physical  measures;  \n(iii) non-physical measures; and (iv) capacity building for efficient project management. \n \n2. \nAll  land  in  Tajikistan  is  state-owned  and  the  Land  Code  states  that  land  must  be \neffectively used for the benefit of the people (article 2 of the Land Code). Land use is directed \nby  the  State  through  the  local  district  administrations, specifically  the  local  offices  of  the  State \nCommittee for Land Management and district administrative offices (hukumat). Inheritance land-\nuse rights are provided for in the Constitution (article 13) and the Land Code (article 12), but the \nprocess is still at a very early stage of implementation and does not provide women with rights \nand opportunities for inheritance or for reimbursement of their land share when they get married \nor  divorced.  The  Land  Code  addresses  potential  compensation  for  people  who  legally  occupy \ngovernment land and are forced to relocate (article 15) but does not address compensation for \npeople  illegally  occupying  government  land  and  forced  to  relocate,  nor  does  it  address \ncompensation for people who have entered into \u201cinformal\u201d renting or leasing arrangements with \nlegally recognized land certificates. \n \n3. \nAlmost  all  lands  in  Hamadoni  district  in  Khatlon  province  along  the  Pyanj  river  were \ntotally  damaged  or  washed  away  by  the  severe  flood  in  June  2005.  Major  structures  such  as \nmain  irrigation  canals  and  roads  have  been  rehabilitated  but  destroyed  farm  land  remains \ngravel-filled. Nobody is cultivating these lands and the local government does not allow them to \nbe cultivated. No land acquisition will be required for the 4.8 km of the main embankment, since \nthe land is owned by the Government and nobody is occupying or using it. The situation is the \nsame for the reinforcement of the 3.5 km of adjacent irrigation canal embankment.  However, in \ncase land acquisition is unexpectedly required, this resettlement framework will be applied.  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nIn principle, there will be no land acquisition required for the structures to be rehabilitated \nunder  the  Project.  This  resettlement  framework  will  be  applied  only  if  sudden  land  acquisition \nbecomes necessary under the Project.  \n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe  Tajikistan  Land  Code  (article  48)  states  that  if  land  is  taken  from  a  physical  and \njuridical or legal person for state and public needs, those persons will be apportioned land of the \nsame  value  and  compensation  for  losses  incurred,  including  income.  The  Chief  of  the \nDepartment of International Relations at Tajikistan\u2019s State Land Committee has stated that the \ndistrict  level  hukumat  (district  administration)  can  compensate  people  who  are  forced  to \nrelocate, even if it is only from cultivated land, not houses. \n \n\nObjectives, Policy Framework, and Entitlements \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 10     55 \n\nConsultation and Grievance Redress Participation \n\nThe  principles  that  will  apply  in  resettlement  planning  are:  (i)  land  acquisition  and \n6. \ninvoluntary  resettlement  will  be  avoided,  (ii)  all  land  and  assets  will  be  compensated  at \nreplacement cost, (iii) affected people, with or without title or land use certificates, are entitled to  \ncompensation  and  assistance,  (iv)  households  headed  by  women  and  affected  by  land \nacquisition will have rights and opportunities for replacement of affected land and assets, (v) no \naffected  people  will  be  displaced  or  dispossessed  without  having  received  compensation  or \nreplacement  lands  or  assets.  In  case  of  discrepancies  between  the  Borrower\u2019s  laws, \nregulations,  and  procedures  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  requirements,  ADB\u2019s  policy  requirements  will \nprevail.  \n \n7. \nThe ADB Policy on Involuntary Resettlement addresses \u201closses of land, resources, and \nmeans of livelihood or social support systems, which people suffer as a result of ADB projects.\u201d  \nAll  efforts  will  be  made  to  avoid  any  involuntary  resettlement  in  the  project  area.  The  current \ndesign of civil works does not anticipate any land acquisition and/or resettlement. Nevertheless, \nthe resettlement framework ensures that people whose lives and incomes may be affected will \nbe assisted to ensure that they have at least the same (but ideally, better) level of material well-\nbeing after the Project as they did before it. \n \nD. \n \nBecause  affected  people  have  not  been  identified,  no  consultations  have  been  held. \n8. \nHowever, the technical assistance team held discussions with people who suffered from severe \nflood  in  Kishlak  under  the  Kalinim  Jamoat.  Discussions  were  also  held  with  local  district \nauthorities  in  the  project  areas  and  at  the  national  level  with  the  State  Committee  for  Land \nManagement  and  the  Ministry  of  Land  Reclamation  and  Water  Resources.  The  resettlement \nplan will be prepared in consultation with affected peoples and the plan will be disclosed to them \nin a form and language that they can understand.  \n \nAll  parties  to  the  discussions  have  agreed  in  principle  to  ensure  the  welfare  of  any \n9. \npotentially-affected  households.  Local  district  authorities  will  address  the  appeals  of  any \npersons  affected  by  the  Project.  It  has  been  agreed  that  affected  persons  may  appoint  a \nmediator  or  facilitator,  who  will  be  paid  by  local  district  authorities,  to  mediate  or  facilitate  on \ntheir behalf. Moreover, the project management office (PMO) will have the services of a gender \nand  social  development  specialist,  who  will  ensure  that  any  people  who  are  affected  are \ncompensated according to the principles of this resettlement framework. \n \nE. \n \n10. \nThere  are  three  key  elements  related  to  compensation,  relocation,  and  income \nrestoration. First, local district authorities have agreed to provide land of equal or better quality, \nin  compensation  for  potential  loss  of  livelihood.  Second,  local  district  authorities  have  agreed \nthat, during the construction of infrastructure projects, affected people will be accorded priority in \nemployment where possible. However, the local district authorities are not in a position to offer \nfuture employment to affected people and argue that income restoration will need to be linked to \nthe provision of land of equal or better quality.  \n \nF. \n \ninfrastructure \n11. \ndevelopment projects will be the joint responsibility of the local district authorities and the PMO \nin  consultation  with  jamoat  and  community-based  groups.  The  PMO  would  also  provide \n\nCompensation, Relocation, and Income Restoration \n\ninspection,  and  assessment \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\nimplementation, \n\nfor  district \n\nPlanning, \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\nResettlement Budget and Financing \n\noversight of the implementation of the resettlement framework. Dissemination of information and \nany necessary public discussions with affected people would also be undertaken periodically to \nensure  proper  implementation  of  the  resettlement  framework.  Before  project  implementation, \ninformation about this resettlement framework will be disseminated by the PMO. Resettlement \nplans  will  be  prepared  according  to  the  resettlement  framework  and  have  to  be  submitted  to \nADB for approval prior to award of civil works contracts.  \n \nG. \n \n12. \nFor households that lose access to land because of the Project, local district authorities \nand  the  PMO  need  to  ensure  that  replacement  land  will  be  provided  and  that  households  will \nreceive land use rights on this land. Because local district authorities are responsible for issuing \nland use rights certificates, they will also need to be involved. There will be minor costs involved \nin monitoring and providing support for resettlement, and these costs, as well as any unforeseen \ncosts, will be covered by the Project. \n \nH. \n \n13. \nAny  detailed  resettlement  planning  will  take  place  before  the  award  of  civil  works \ncontracts and the implementation of resettlement would take place well before the start of civil \nworks construction.  \n \nI. \n \nIf  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  is  required,  the  PMO  will  implement  a  detailed \n14. \nmonitoring and evaluation plan for the entire Project, including preparation, implementation, and \nflow-on  effects.  In  relation  to  resettlement,  the  PMO  will  develop  baseline  data  for  monitoring \nindicators  including:  amount  of  land  lost;  amount  of  replacement  land  (of  similar  or  better \nquality);  number  of  jobs  provided  (temporary  and  replacement);  compensation  payments;  and \nother  assistance  in  moving,  training,  and  household  income  (or  agricultural  income  or  output \nvalue)  tracking.  In  support  of  these  activities,  affected  persons  will  be  invited  to  attend  public \nmeetings  to  discuss  resettlement  issues.  The  Ministry  of  Land  Reclamation  and  Water \nResources  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB  on  the  implementation  of  the \nresettlement plan and a resettlement completion report. \n \nJ. \n \n15. \nAt the feasibility study level, there is no land acquisition required. However, at the actual \nimplementation  stage,  there  is  a  possibility  that  unexpected  land  acquisition  may  arise. \nTherefore, this resettlement framework has been designed to provide safeguards. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 11     57   \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \n\nA.    Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Tajikistan: \n \nThe  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper  (PRSP),  published  in  2002,  is  the  Government\u2019s  coordinated  framework  for \naddressing  poverty  in  Tajikistan.1 Flood  management  in  the  project  areas  will  significantly  reduce  the  risks  of  loss \nassociated with frequent flooding of the project districts.  This provides protection for poor rural households who have \nno cushion to  absorb risk. Work on  disaster preparedness  will  help to ensure that floods have  a lower impact  when \nthey do occur. \n \nThe project area incorporates the districts of Hamadoni, Vose, Kulyab, and Farhor in the fertile flood plains adjacent to \nthe Pyanj, Kizilsu and Yakhsu rivers in Khatlon province. The zone has traditionally produced cotton, and today rural \nhouseholds  (75.2%  of  the  total  population  of  583,700)  depend  on  cotton,  livestock,  and  household  plots  for  both \nsubsistence and livelihoods. According to preliminary poverty mapping data, the level of poverty in the project districts \nis  about  79%,  over  14%  above  the  national  average.  Most  of  poor  and  very  poor  households  live  and  work  in  rural \nareas. The rural poor are mainly agricultural workers, families with many children, and the elderly. Households headed \nby women are a particular challenge, as over 40% of men have left the area to find work in the Russian Federation.  In \n2005, the average nominal monthly salary in the project districts was 52 somoni (about $15), which is lower than the \naverage  national  level  by  37%.  In  the  project  districts,  a  five  to  six  month  delay  in  payment  of  salaries  is  common, \nespecially  in  the  agriculture  sector.  On  many  farms  workers  receive  seasonal  in-kind  payment  (wheat,  and  cotton \nsticks for heating and cooking) instead of salaries.  \n \nAccording  to  the  population  census  in  2000  and  an  impact  assessment  on  indigenous  peoples,  70%  of  the  project \narea population is ethnic Tajik, 25% is Uzbek, and 5% is from other ethnic groups (most are married to ethnic Tajiks.)  \nGenerally non-Tajik populations in southern Tajikistan speak Tajik as well as their native languages.  Ethnic minorities \nenjoy  the  same  rights  as  the  Tajik  majority  and  regularly  intermarry  with  Tajiks.  They  are  fully  integrated  into \ninstitutional, cultural, and economic processes in the country.  Consequently they do not face discrimination, nor are \nthey sufficiently separate to justify classification as indigenous peoples.  No specific actions for ethnic minorities are \nenvisioned for this project. \n \nIn recent years the project districts have become increasingly vulnerable to floods because of insufficient embankment \nmaintenance.  Lives  have  been  lost  and  flood  embankments,  houses,  canals,  land,  roads  and  bridges  have  been \ndestroyed.  When  there  are  floods,  poor  households  are  deeply  affected,  losing  homes,  assets,  livestock,  essential \npapers,  and  even  lives.    In  addition,  agricultural  crops  are  spoiled,  and  often  agricultural  land  loses  productivity  and \ncan even be lost to production. Health and social services are negatively affected.  Recovery is slow, and dependence \non relatives for support erodes the narrow cushions of other families. A major flood took place in 2005 in Hamadoni \ndistrict caused by flooding of the Pyanj river. Estimates of losses are on the order of $17.8 million. \n \nThe  PRSP  incorporates  attention  to  flood  management  as  part  of  infrastructure  and  environment,  and  agriculture.  It \nrecognizes that adequate infrastructure is critical to reducing poverty. The PRSP provides for both a national strategy \nfor  disaster  management  and  appropriate  specialized  and  appropriately  equipped  services  to  study,  forecast,  and \nprovide  zoning  and  monitoring  of  detrimental  impact  of  potential  sources  of  natural  disasters.    Effective  water \nmanagement is an essential element of the PRSP.   \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nPoverty  is  endemic  in  the  project  area,  and,  apart  from  the  6%  of  the  population  in  white  or  blue  collar  jobs  or  in \nbusiness, virtually everyone is poor. Most women in the area are engaged in agricultural labor.  Many men migrate to \nRussia as there are no employment opportunities in the project districts. Field surveys revealed that the main sources \nof  income  of  the  interviewed  households  are  remittances  from  labor  migrants  (27.4%),  salaries  and  wages  (18.7%), \noccasional earnings and proceeds from selling of agricultural products (27.4%). \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\n                                                 \n1   Tajikistan  is  finalizing  its  PRSP  Realization  Report  (2002\u20132006).  It  concluded  a  Poverty  Partnership  Agreement \n\nwith ADB in December 2002.  \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nThe  households  spend  up  to  80%  of  their  incomes  on  food:  flour  products  (41%),  meat  and  meat  products \n(14.4%), and vegetables (12.3%). Most food comes from subsistence farming or humanitarian aid.  \n\n \nRural  households  identified  the  following  factors  as  causes  of  poverty  in  their  area:    (i)  natural  disasters  and  floods \ncausing  property  losses  (land,  yields,  houses,  and  livestock);  (ii)  lack  of  drinking  and  irrigation  water,  and  problems \nwith drainage causing salinization; (iii) unemployment (lack of non-agricultural job opportunities); (iv) lack of and unfair \ndistribution of agricultural lands between households (households plots and dekhkan farms lands); and (v) unjustified \ndebts of farms to futures companies (investors)  for cotton production. \n\nSurveys revealed the following adverse impacts of previous floods on living standards in the project districts:  \n \n\n\u2022  Losses of personal property, houses and livestock and consequent damage family living conditions. \nBefore  the  most  previous  floods,  no  one  considered  their  living  conditions  to  be  very  bad  and  only  5.7%  of \nrespondents assessed their living conditions to be bad. After the flood, 42.4% of respondents considered their \nliving conditions very bad and 37.1% bad. \n\n\u2022  Significant declines in income levels. Before the floods, 59.8% of respondents assessed their income level \nas  medium,  while  6.4%  stated  that  their  income  was  below  medium  and  0.4%  marked  considerably  below \nmedium.  After  the  flood,  only  26.5%  of  respondents  assessed  their  income  as  medium,  whereas  36% \nassessed their income level as below the medium, and 35.2% indicated considerably below medium incomes.  \n\u2022  Emergence of higher levels of disease due to increased humidity in houses, bad quality of drinking water, \nand  anxiety.  In  the  project  areas  cases  of  malaria  and  typhoid  were  reported  after  floods.  The  number  of \npeople  suffering  from  rheumatism  increased.  Woman's  diseases,  high  blood  pressure  and  kidney  diseases \nbecame more prevalent among villages residents.     \n\n\u2022  Rising  groundwater  results  in  lower  agricultural  yields  (vegetables  rot)  and  in  deterioration  of  drinking \n\nwater quality.   \n\n\u2022  Decline in access to essential services because of the destruction of infrastructure: roads, schools, power \n\n\u2022 \n\ntransmission and communication lines; and irrigation canals. \nIncreased  level  of  labor  migration.  During  the  focus  group  discussions,  more  than  80%  of  both  men  and \nwomen noted that, as a result of the floods, the number of labor migrants moving abroad to earn money had  \nincreased. People use remittances to try to recover from the consequences of the flood.   \n\n \nThe  Project  addresses  the  core  issues  raised  by  households  in  the  project  areas  in  a  number  of  ways.    First,  it  will \nrepair broken embankment areas along the Pyanj river, thereby reducing the likelihood of overall flooding to once in \n100 years, substantially improving the safety of the poor and their assets.  Second, it will provide equipment both to \nensure adequate maintenance of the repaired embankments and to provide help to communities along tributaries to \nperform  essential  repairs  they  cannot  handle  on  their  own.    Third,  the  project  will  conduct  feasibility  studies  to \ndetermine  what  work  can  be  undertaken  on  the  tributaries  to  increase  flood  protection  for  communities  that  are \npotentially  at  risk.    Fourth,  the  project  will  provide  more  effective  methods  of  flood  risk  warning,  from  risk  maps  to \nmeasurement mechanisms. These will enable the Government and communities to be able to better anticipate floods.  \nFifth, the project will work with both the Committee for Emergency Situations and, under a proposed Japan Fund For \nPoverty Reduction (JFPR) grant, with communities directly to ensure all members are prepared to deal with the results \nof floods.  Sixth, under the JFPR project, a significant area will be planted in trees in the project zone, and this area \nwill  both  act  to  strengthen  the  Hamadoni  embankment  and  provide  a  valuable  source  of  firewood  and  income \ngeneration for nearby households. \n \nHamadoni district will benefit directly from the Project because repairs to the embankments will lower the probability of \nfloods. The population of the four districts will benefit directly from the increased awareness of the potential for floods \nand their effects, improved preparedness for flood events and heightened readiness to act quickly to limit losses due \nto  floods,  and  better  awareness  of  post-flood  requirements  to  speed  recovery  and  to  limit  disease,  non-agricultural \nlosses,  and  damage  to  household  goods.  Finally,  work  to  create  both  community  cohesion  and  better  relations \nbetween  different  levels  of  government  through  the  Project  and  the  proposed  JFPR  project  will  enhance \nunderstanding  by  both  sides  of  conditions  and  concerns  of  the  poor,  and  lead  to  better  information  flows  on  how  to \naddress issues of poverty related to disasters. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nC.  Participation Process \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nParticipatory  stakeholder  consultations  were  conducted  with  representatives  of  local  government  (chairpersons  of \ndistrict and jamoat leaders and their deputies), district emergency and civil defense authorities, heads of committees \nfor affairs of women and children and social issues under districts, international partners (United Nations Development \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 11     59   \n\n \n\nProgramme  (UNDP),  OXFAM,  (Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  )  JICA,  ACTED,  Mission  East,  Disaster \nPreparedness  ECHO  DIPECHO,  Focus),  local  NGOs  and  community-based  organizations,  and  the  general \npopulation.  The  consultations  addressed  the  main  social  and  economic  problems  of  the  area  and  possible \nmechanisms of community direct engagement in physical and non-physical flood management activities. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  proposed  participation  strategy  involves  (i)  collaboration  between  the  CES  and  communities  in  the  \nprovision of disaster preparation equipment, training, and drills; (ii) during construction, contractor liaison with nearby \ncommunities  to  share  their  designs,  implementation  plans,  and  progress;  and  (iii)  during  the  feasibility  work, \nconsultations  with  communities  in  affected  areas  to  determine  their  knowledge  of  previous  floods  and  views  on \npotential flood risks.   \n \nD.  Gender Development \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\n Strategy to maximize impacts on women: \nTo  maximize  their  benefits  under  the  Project,  women  will  need  access  to  decision-making,  information,  and  income \noptions.  To engage  women in decision-making, all levels  of government (including the  PMU and PIOs)  will have  at \nleast  one  professional  woman  directly  involved  in  project  activities.  To  ensure  women  have  access  to  information, \nwomen will form 40% of the participants in all courses, and in courses in communities 50%.  Women will be eligible to \nprovide labor for local contractors during the construction phase, and contractors will report on the composition of their \nworkforces by sex. Their target for unskilled labor will be at least 15% women.   \n \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nE.
