The  summary  initial  environmental  examination \nAssessment  (SIEE) is in Appendix 9. \n   \nProject Description  Tajikistan is susceptible to natural disasters, particularly floods. \nThe floods of 1998 and 1999 were especially devastating, causing \n32 deaths and agricultural and infrastructure damage estimated at \n$55 million.  \n \nThe Project aims to help Tajikistan address recurring flood risks \nthrough  a  holistic  and  coordinated  approach  involving  both \nphysical and non-physical measures in one of the most flood- \nprone  areas  in  the  country\u2014Hamadoni,  Farkhor,  Kulyab,  and \nVose districts in Khatlon province.  A major part of the Project \nfunds will be used for the physical works for the rehabilitation of \n8.3 km of flood protection embankment along the Pyanj River. In \naddition, the project will develop and disseminate a flood risk map, \nstrengthen flood warning systems, prepare a flood preparedness \nand evacuation plan, and strengthen flood forecasting capacity by \nrehabilitating the hydrometeorological network.     \n \nGiven that the Pyanj River borders Tajikistan and Afghanistan, the \npossible environmental impacts of the Project's physical works in \nboth  Tajikistan  and  Afghanistan  were  examined.  The  initial \nenvironment examination study found that there is unlikely to be \nsignificant negative environmental impact. The Project is expected \nto have a significant positive impact on ecological resources and \nsocioeconomic conditions in the area.  \n \nIn  addition,  the  project  will  help  the  Government  define  and \nimplement  the  policy  reforms  needed  to  improve  its  flood \npreparedness, and to remove some of its persisting operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) funding constraints for the flood levees and \nbank protection works.  \n \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  capacity  at  the  Ministry  of  Land \nReclamation  and  Water  Resources  (MLRWR)  and  the  local \ngovernment bodies to manage flood disaster risks, and to apply \n   ", "ii   \n  need-based O&M budget planning, allocations, and monitoring for \n  the flood protection structures. The application of performance- \n  based O&M contracts will also be pilot tested. \n   \nRationale  The  four  districts  in  Khatlon  province  contain  some  of  the \ncountry\u2019s most productive agricultural lands. Cotton, Tajikistan\u2019s \nkey  agricultural  export  commodity,  is  grown  in  53%  of  the \nprovince\u2019s  farm  land  (93,000  ha),  accounting  for  32%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  total  cotton  area.  The  area  is  populated  by  583,700 \npeople and has a comparatively high level of private and public \nsector assets, which play a pivotal role in regional agriculture, \neconomy and trade.  \n   \nThis area is under constant threat of flooding by the Pyanj River, \nas  flood  protection  facilities  have  degraded  over  the  years \nbecause  of  continued  under-funding  of  O&M  expenditures.  In \naddition, the floods from the upper mountains are worsening\u2014\nboth  in  intensity  and  duration.  The  Government  accords  the \nhighest priority to the immediate improvement of flood protection \nfacilities in Khatlon province. By putting in place modern flood \nprotection, the Government also expects to reduce the annual \nO&M funding requirements substantially.  \n \nThe concept and approach of the proposed project reflect the \nlessons gathered under the technical assistance (TA) for Strategy \nfor Improved Flood Management. The economic problems of the \nlast decade have left a considerable backlog of maintenance work \nto be done on the protection systems. As a result, the levels of \nprotection  against  flooding  in  many  areas  of  the  country  are \nalarmingly  low\u2014addressing  this  backlog  in  order  to  bring \nprotection systems to a reasonable level has been accorded a \nhigh priority.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project will reduce the risk of socioeconomic losses caused \nby  floods  in  Farkhor,  Hamadoni,  Kulyab  and  Vose  districts  of \nKhatlon province through a holistic and coordinated approach of \nphysical protection measures and non-physical measures, such \nas flood preparedness, forecasting and warning with community \nparticipation.  The  institutional  and  legal  framework  will  be \nstrengthened during project implementation, taking full account of \nsocial, environmental, and economic factors. \n \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The cost of the project is estimated at $28.5 million, including \ntaxes and duties of $4.9 million. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) will finance $22 million equivalent from Asian Development \nFund  (ADF).  The  remaining  $6.5  million  equivalent  will  be \nfinanced by the Government. \n   ", "  iii\nFinancing Plan  A loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights \n14,403,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources will be provided. \nThe loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 \nyears, an interest rate of 1% yearly during the grace period and \n1.5% yearly thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as \nare set forth in the Loan Agreement. The loan will meet the costs \nof the infrastructure development, consultant services, institutional \nstrengthening  and  office  and  equipment  requirements.  The \nGovernment will finance taxes and duties, counterpart staff, and a \npart of the O&M cost.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2014 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2013 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Land Reclamation and Water Resources (MLRWR) \n \n   \nImplementation  MLRWR  will  be  the  executing  agency.  A  project  steering \nArrangements  committee (PSC) will be located in the President\u2019s Office and will \nmeet twice a year. The PSC\u2019s secretariat will be located in the \nproject management office (PMO). The existing PMO under the \nMLRWR for an ongoing ADB project will also serve as PMO for \nthis project.  Within three months of the loan effectiveness, each \nof the PMO, Ministry of Agriculture and Environment Protection \n(MAEP),  and  Committee  for  the  Emergency  Situation  (CES) \nestablish an adequately staffed PIO. Each PIO will be responsible \nfor the day-to-day implementation of the respective component of \nthe  Project,  including  (i)  supervision  of  contractors  and \nconsultants; (ii) preparation of the draft progress report and other \nnecessary  related  documents;  and  (iii)  coordination  of  the \nactivities under the respective component.  \n   \nProcurement  The  Project  will  procure  machinery,  equipment,  civil  works, \nservices,  vehicles,  office  equipment,  and  materials.  All \nprocurement  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime).  \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will provide 486 person-months of consulting services, \nto be provided by international (72 person-months) and national \nconsultants  (414  person-months).  The  consultants  will  be \nrecruited  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The selection \nwill be based on full technical proposals and quality- and cost- \nbased selection (QCBS). \n \n ", "iv   \nProject Benefits and  The project area is highly vulnerable to floods and has a strong \nBeneficiaries  need for flood protection. Khatlon province contains most of the \nlow-lying flat land in Tajikistan. The population density is relatively \nhigh, and predominantly rural. The population of the project area \nis  583,700,  only  20%  of  whom  were  in  employment  in  2005, \nmainly in the agricultural sector. The average monthly income \nfrom agriculture was $15 per month. The economy of the project \n  area is dominated by agriculture, with wheat and cotton being the \nmost  important  cash  crops,  followed  by  vegetables  and  fruit, \nmainly for the local market and for domestic consumption.   \n \nAssuming that a medium level of maintenance is achieved, it is \nconsidered  that  the  proposed  embankments  can  effectively \nprotect  against  floods  for  the  next  100  years.  The  economic \nanalysis shows that the annualized benefits would be TJS8.148 \nmillion with an economic rate of return of 16.0%.  If it is possible to \nachieve only a low level of maintenance, the level of protection will \nbe reduced to 50 years and the annualized level of benefits will be \nTJS7.038 million with an economic rate of return of 13.7%.  \n \nThe  Project  will  bring  social  benefits,  particularly  for  poorer \nbeneficiaries, by reducing (i) losses of personal property, houses \nand livestock and consequent damage to family living conditions; \n(ii)  significant  declines  in  income  levels;  (iii)  emergence  of \ndisease, (iv) decreases in agricultural yields, (v) deterioration of \ndrinking water, (vi) declines in access to essential services, and \n(vii) levels of migration.  \n \nNo significant negative environmental impact is likely. The Project \nis likely to have a significant positive impact on soil and water \nresources,  agricultural  productivities,  public  health,  and  rural \nlivelihoods.  \n \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  If the Government cannot provide a sufficient O&M budget for the \ncompleted flood protection embankment, it will be easily damaged \nby the future floods. This risk has been mitigated by including in \nthe loan agreement a provision for heavy equipment to maintain \nthe completed embankments and a strong commitment from the \nGovernment to provide sufficient budget for fuel, lubricant, and \nspare parts, which are clearly specified in the loan agreement.  \n   ", "  v\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for the Khatlon Province Flood Risk Management Project.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  At the request of the Government of Tajikistan, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \napproved technical assistance (TA) for the preparation of the Khatlon Province Flood Risk \nManagement Project (the Project).1 The TA study was carried out from November 2006 to May \n2007. This report is based on the project preparatory technical assistance feasibility study, the \nfindings  of  ADB  missions,  lessons  learned  from  similar  projects,  and  discussions  with \ngovernment officials, other development partners, civil society, and beneficiaries. The project \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis2 \n3  Tajikistan is a mountainous, landlocked and isolated country with high mountains and \nsignificant river systems. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1992 it was the poorest of the \nformer Soviet republics, and a subsequent 5-year civil war both delayed economic transition and \nslowed growth prospects. The economy grew by 7.0% in 2006, driven by increases in aluminum \nprices and approximately $718 million in remittances3 from large numbers of male migrants. \nHowever, the country\u2019s options are limited by a narrow export base of largely cotton and \naluminum, structural difficulties in agriculture, and limited capacity for international borrowing to \nfund other economic expansion. Per-capita income levels of $350 per year demonstrate the \nhigh  level  of  poverty,  and  low  government  revenues  severely  constrain  service  provision, \nparticularly in rural areas. \n \n4.  Of Tajikistan\u2019s total area of 14.3 million hectares (ha), only 4.3 million ha is agricultural \nland  and  only  0.8  million  ha  is  arable.  Despite  the  low  amount  of  available  arable  land, \nagriculture is the major source of livelihood for more than 64% of the population, and makes \nsignificant contributions to the economy. In 2004, output from agriculture generated 22% of \ngross domestic product (GDP), 20% of exports, 67% of employment, and 39% of tax revenues. \nOf Tajikistan\u2019s 7.0 million people, 70% live in rural areas. Rural poverty incidence declined from \n83% in 1999 to 64% in 2003.  For poverty reduction to be effective, rural households must be \nable to protect their access to and productivity of their land and be able to mitigate the risk of the \nloss of livelihoods and assets.    \n \n5.  Tajikistan is prone to frequent natural disasters, including floods, mudflows, landslides, \navalanches,  earthquakes,  droughts  and  epidemics  because  of  its  terrain  and  climate. \nCatastrophic events with an annual probability of occurrence of 0.5% (events expected to occur \nonce every 200 years) would have a major impact on an already vulnerable economy and it has \nbeen estimated that the economic losses from such an event would exceed 20% of Tajikistan\u2019s \nGDP.4  All areas of the country would be affected.

", " 2 \nproduct (GNP) and the risk of floods and other natural disasters on the national, provincial and \nlocal economies is a serious brake on social development and economic growth.  \n \n6.  Floods are a particularly severe disaster risk, because of the mountainous nature of the \ncountry. The mountain system is geologically young and eroded and mountain slopes are steep \nin many parts of the country. Climactic systems source water from glacial and snowmelt at high \nelevations. These conditions easily generate destructive floods. While annual total rainfall is not \nparticularly high, intensive daily rainfall in excess of 100 mm is known. Floods from larger rivers \ntend to be generated through rapid snowmelt, coupled with periods of heavy rainfall.  The years \n1998 and 1999 were particularly bad for flooding, leading to 32 deaths and agricultural and \ninfrastructure damage estimated at $55 million.  \n \n7.  The relatively densely populated Khatlon province occupies the south-west corner of \nTajikistan adjacent to the Uzbekistan border to the west and the Afghanistan border to the \nsouth. The population of the project area (Hamadoni, Farkhor, Vose, and Kulyab districts) is \n583,700.  Only  20%  of  adults  were  formally  employed  in  2005,  mainly  in  agriculture.  The \naverage monthly income from agriculture was $15 per month. The economy of the project area \nis  dominated  by  agriculture,  with  wheat  and  cotton  being  the  most  important  cash  crops, \nfollowed  by  vegetables  and  fruit,  mainly  for  the  local  market  and  domestic  consumption.  \nPoverty is significant, endemic, and higher than in most other areas of the country. \n \n8.  Khatlon  province  contains  large  reclaimed  flood  plain  in  the  1930s  by  Soviet \nembankment construction along the Pyanj and tributary Yakhsu and Kazilsu rivers. This area \nforms a significant percentage of Tajikistan\u2019s total arable land and much of the irrigated land \narea. Khatlon province contains most of the low-lying land in Tajikistan. The Pyanj river forms \nthe international border with Afghanistan, and the Babatag Mountains form the international \nborder with Uzbekistan. Runoff from the Pyanj river basin is generated mainly in summer \nbecause of snow- and icemelt. The volume of annual runoff depends chiefly on the quantity of \nsnow accumulation in winter and air temperatures during the following summer. The maximum \ndischarge is usually in July or August, while the minimum occurs in mid-winter.  \n \n9.  In the years since independence, the fertile plains adjacent to the Pyanj, Kizilsu and \nYakhsu rivers in Khatlon province have become increasingly vulnerable to floods. Lives have \nbeen  lost  and  flood  embankments,  houses,  canals,  land,  roads  and  bridges  have  been \ndestroyed. There were severe floods in Kulyab, Vose and Farkhor districts in 1998 and 1999 \ncaused by the Yakhsu and Kizilsu river systems. Subsequently, smaller floods have caused \nfurther damage. A major flood took place in 2005 in Hamadoni district caused by embankment \nfailure along the Pyanj river, with damage estimated at over $18 million.  \n \n10.  The flood risk on the flood plains of the Kizilsu and Yakhsu rivers in Kulyab, Vose and \nFarkhor  districts  in  Khatlon  province  is  very  high  because  of  the  destruction  of  flood \nembankments since 1998. At least 15 km of flood embankment have been destroyed so far. \nThe probability of flooding in some parts may now be higher than 50% (an average chance of \nflooding once in 2 years). The irrigation infrastructure, inherited at the end of the Soviet era, has \nsuffered from a lack of investment in routine maintenance. This has led to progressive loss of \ncultivable land and damage to embankments, intakes and canals. The lack of maintenance \nleaves communities, infrastructure and valuable agricultural land highly vulnerable to further \nloss or damage on an almost annual basis. In effect there is no flood protection in some places. \nOne hundred and six villages in the catchment area are designated as high flood risk.  \n \n11.  The Pyanj river emerges from being relatively confined in a valley onto a large outwash \nfan. At the head of the fan the river is characterized by its steep slope, its gravel and cobble ", "    3\nbed, and its braided bed form. A notable feature of the main river channel is that it tends to \nattach to one mountainside or the other, with braided channels crossing gravel bars from one \nside to the other. The current design and construction methods of flood embankments and \nspurs aim for economy and expediency but at the cost of high maintenance burdens. Without \nproper  maintenance,  it  is  inevitable  that  flood  risk  will  increase  because  of  the  erosion, \nslumping, and breaching of embankments due to the highly energetic and unstable channels of \nthe Pyanj river. \n \n12.  The situation in the Kizilsu and Yakhsu valleys is quite different. Here the rivers have \nbeen severely constrained by flood embankments on both sides with the adjacent land heavily \ndeveloped for agriculture and settlement. This rigid river training has encouraged more gravel \nand silt to be transported further down the valleys than would naturally be the case, raising river \nbed levels and flood levels. In Kulyab and Vose, the main channels of the Kizilsu and Yakhsu \nrivers appear to have little capacity left. Consequently, the embankments have been scoured, \novertopped, and breached. Lack of adequate maintenance has allowed once minor damage to \nspread almost unchecked until it has become a major issue. In 2007, many villages and farms in \nKulyab and Vose are highly vulnerable to serious flooding. This state of affairs may have been \nexacerbated by the local practice of excavating river gravels close to the embankments. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems  \n13.  Careful analysis reveals the following key flood management performance problems in \nthe project area and generally: \n \n(i)  the current Water Code does not incorporate the concept of flood management; \n(ii)  institutional responsibilities for flood management are not clearly specified in \nexisting legislation; \n(iii)  there are no specific allocations of core capital and recurrent funds to the flood \nmanagement institutions; \n(iv)  flood defences have failed because of a lack of maintenance; \n(v)  accurate  flood  forecasts  have  not  been  available  because  only  part  of  the \nprecipitation and river monitoring network is functional and forecasting tools are \nnot developed; \n(vi)  flood warnings have not reached the residents of flood risk areas soon enough; \n(vii)  many  residents  of  flood-risk  areas  have  been  unprepared  for  floods,  and \nunaware of how to mitigate the risk of loss of assets and critical papers; \n(viii)  the socioeconomic impacts of flooding have been large and in some locations \nirreversible; \n(ix)  the rivers in the Hamadoni area are naturally unstable and erosive and are in \nconflict with flood plain development for agriculture and settlement; \n(x)  land use changes in highland subcatchment areas may have increased flood \nfrequency and magnitude; and \n(xi)  global warming and climate change may have increased flood frequency and \nmagnitude and may continue to do so. \n \n14.  The  key  flood  management  institutions  are  the  State  Commission  for  Emergency \nSituations  (SCES),  the  Committee  for  Emergency  Situations  (CES),  the  Ministry  of  Land \nReclamation and Water Resources (MLRWR) and the Agency for Hydrometeorology within the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Environment Protection (MAEP). However, their specific roles and \nresponsibilities with respect to flood management are not completely defined in the underlying \nlegislation and are not integrated or well coordinated within a coherent flood management \nsystem. This causes gaps and overlaps in predicting floods and preparing for them, in mitigating \n ", " 4 \nrisk, in addressing floods when they occur, and in post-flood repairs. Furthermore, there are no \nspecific allocations of capital or recurrent funds for flood management at each institution. Flood \nmanagement and disaster management in general appears to be managed by the central \nGovernment on a contingency basis rather than as a core activity. \n \n15.  Since 1992, the Government has been forced into a strategy of reactive emergency \nrepairs to flood defenses in the project area and elsewhere following a series of severe floods. \nThese repairs have had to be funded partly by international partners and partly from state \nreserves on an as-needed basis. There is a shortage of central recurrent budgets for operation \nand maintenance (O&M), and water users are unable to pay enough for flood protection from \nthe irrigation canals. The situation is now widely recognized by the Government and by the \ndonor community to be unsustainable. There is growing acceptance that there needs to be a \nmore holistic and strategic approach to flood management.   \n \n16.  The  most  important  environmental  issue  is  the  conflict  between  agriculture  and \nsettlement on the flood plains and the naturally violent and unstable nature of the rivers. To \nsustain agricultural production and development, the rivers have to be managed very carefully \nand significant resources provided for O&M of the aging irrigation and embankment systems. \nUnfortunately,  since  independence  in  1992,  this  has  been  beyond  the  means  of  central, \nprovincial and district governments. Consequently there has been progressive destruction of \nland, property and infrastructure. \n \n17.  The provision of adequate maintenance is a considerable challenge for the Government.  \nTotal expenditure on flood protection works decreased sharply from $11.5 million in 1985 to \n$0.43 million in 1999 and it has remained at roughly this level since then. Proper O&M of flood \nprotection embankments requires 2%-3% of the total capital investment cost annually. One \nproblem MLRWR faces in maintaining the flood embankments is the poor condition of the heavy \nequipment. In Hamadoni district, the existing stock of machinery for maintenance is between 15 \nand 30 years old and 10 of the 23 machines are unserviceable. If flood embankments are not \nproperly maintained, they will erode and flood protection capacity will fall.  \n \n18.  Flood risk maps show the areas of a flood plain that are likely to flood. They are used to \ndefine different flood risk areas within the flood plain according to flood frequency and severity \nof flood impact. The flood risk of each area defined in this way then determines which flood \nmanagement measures are most appropriate in that zone and which areas should be prioritized. \nUnfortunately there are no detailed flood risk maps in the project area, so there are no proper \nemergency evacuation plans in the villages along the Pyanj, Yakhsu and Kizilsu rivers.  \n \n19.  Although a flood warning system exists for the Pyanj river at Hamadoni, based on the \nrate of rise of the river level at Khirmanjo approximately 100 km upstream, the warnings are \nimprecise. The river gauge is in a poor condition and difficult to reach because it is on the \nAfghanistan border. A flood warning system has recently been restored on the Yakhsu river at \nKarboztonak which is linked to the Agency for Hydrometeorology in Dushanbe and also, by \nradio,  to  downstream  communities.  Other  community  flood  warning  systems  are  being \nintroduced or proposed by international nongovernment organizations (NGOs) such as Mission \nEast and Oxfam, but most villages will not have flood warning systems under these programs.  \nEven when these simple tools are in place, villages are not trained to use them effectively. \n \n20.  The socioeconomic impact of flooding is high. There is a strong link between floods and \npoverty5 and there is substantial loss of livelihood after floods. Whereas only 7% of flood victims \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2004. Floods and the Poor, Water for All. Manila (publication no. 11). ", "    5\nin the four districts in Khatlon province believe their income was below average before flooding, \n71% believe it was below average after flooding. This correlates with estimates that production \nof grain fell by 70%, of vegetables by 83%, and of grapes by 95% following floods. After floods \n38% of cattle and 58% of poultry were lost. Over 96% of houses were seriously or moderately \ndamaged and 54% of the land was flooded and inundated with debris. Disease, deteriorating \ndrinking water quality, water logging of land, and greater emigration are characteristic of the \naftermath of floods.  \n \n21.  The CES is responsible for ensuring that the relevant government, provincial and district \ndepartments and communities at risk of flooding are adequately prepared so that the probability \nof household losses can be lower. The CES has training centers in its central and district offices \nbut it lacks the resources to deliver a comprehensive program of flood preparedness training. \nHowever, improvements are now being made with support from international donors. There is \nno standard system of certification of village preparedness, villages and rapid response teams \nlack equipment, and there is insufficient coordination at the jamoat (local government) level.  \nThere is no regular and routine system of simulations or drills to ensure villages and local \ngovernments  are  well  prepared  to  address  flood  risks  and  disasters.  Although  NGOs  are \nincreasingly involved in disaster preparedness work at the village level, there is not enough \ncollaboration  between  the  CES,  local  governments,  and  NGOs  to  create  a  cohesive  and \neffective flood management system.  Finally, flood mitigation efforts are scattered and in some \ncases inconsistent. A far more standard method to address this issue must be found. \n \n22.  Most international experts predict that perennial snow- and icemelt will increase due to \nglobal warming and that storms will also increase. The key findings of a major recent climate \nchange  analysis6 indicated  that  Tajikistan  may  face  an  increase  in  annual,  minimum  and \nseasonal mean temperatures; critical changes in precipitation; a rise in the levels of lakes \nbecause  of  glacier  degradation;  droughts;  and  other  frequent  extreme  weather  events, \nworsening already serious flood problems. In Khatlon province the prospect is that the summer \nfloods on the Pyanj river may become larger, accelerating the erosion of the Hamadoni flood \nembankments. On the Kizilsu and Yakhsu rivers, more storms will increase the frequency and \nseverity of floods in Kulyab, Vose and Farkhor.7   \n \nC.  Opportunities \n23.  ADB\u2019s  disaster  and  emergency  assistance  policy  (DEAP)8 provide  direction  for  the \nproposed project. The DEAP aims to integrate disaster risk management into the development \nprocess  of  developing  member  countries  and  to  build  their  disaster  and  hazard  risk \nmanagement capacity. It also recommends that disaster risk be taken into account in preparing \nADB country strategies, plans and projects. A key element of the DEAP is institutionalizing \ndisaster risk management by identifying risks during ADB\u2019s country programming schedules and \nbuilding risk reduction strategies into project plans. In the indicative rolling country operations \nbusiness  plan9 the  proposed  Project  is  expected  to  address  medium-  to  long-term  flood \nmanagement  issues  and  to  promote  sustainable,  inclusive  economic  growth  in  rural \ncommunities  in  selected  flood-prone  areas,  consistent  with  the  overall  rural  development \napproach. \n \n                                                 \n6  Global Environment Facility (GEF) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 2007.

Manila (approved in May). \n ", " 6 \n24.  A number of related activities also provide lessons for this Project. They include the \nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Disaster Risk Management Capacity-Building \nProgram, the World Bank\u2019s Emergency Flood Assistance Project,10 the ADB Emergency Flood \nRehabilitation  Project,11 and  the  ADB  Strategy  for  Improved  Flood  Management12 (see \nAppendix 3). \n \n25.  The fundamental opportunity presented by the Project is the chance to put in place a \ncomprehensive  integrated  flood  management  approach  to  replace  the  current  ad  hoc \narrangements. The Project will reduce the severe economic and social costs of floods by \npromoting the use of combined physical and non-physical approaches to flood protection.13 On \nthe non-physical side there are three key areas to be addressed under the integrated approach. \nFirst, legal and regulatory changes can establish a clear line of authority and responsibility for \nflood  management.  This  will  enable  appropriate  arrangements  for  budgets,  forecasting, \nmitigation, maintenance, addressing of floods when they occur, and handling any reconstruction \nor aftermath.   Second, flood forecasting and risk mapping can be arranged and updated so \nflood risk is better understood, predicted, and mitigated.  Third, a combination of the CES, local \ngovernments  at  the  district  and  jamoat  levels,  villages,  and  NGOs  can  work  together  on \neffective,  properly  resourced  flood  preparedness,  evacuation  plans,  mitigation  plans,  flood \nmonitoring and alerts, including simulations to confirm readiness, and response teams.14  \n \n26.  The  introduction  of  structural  flood  management  measures  to  improve  the  flood \nembankments on the Pyanj, Kizilsu and Yakhsu rivers will substantially lower flood risk. When \nthe current improvement works being carried out on the Pyanj river as part of another ADB \nproject15 are  complete,  some  flood-prone  areas  in  Hamadoni  will  be  protected  to  the  1% \nprobability level (an average chance of flooding once in 100 years). These improvements will \napply to the first 12 km of embankments. However, further downstream there are damaged \nembankments near Metintugai which are not being improved. The flood risk in this area is \nconsidered to be in the range of 5-10% (an average chance of flooding once in 10-20 years). To \nreduce this risk to the same level as that obtained upstream, damaged flood embankments will \nhave to be rehabilitated and canal embankments reinforced. There is an urgent need to study \nand design better flood protection for the worst flood damaged areas of the Kizilsu and Yakhsu \nflood plains, where risks may be as high as 50% (flooding once every 2 years).  \n \n27.  Lowering the maintenance burden of structural improvements in the project area will \nincrease the likelihood of a successful maintenance regime in the medium term.  A number of \nways of reducing the flood embankment maintenance burden on the Government have been \nconsidered, including replacing the current deteriorated and inefficient plant, increasing water \nfees, contracting out maintenance, voluntary community participation, and low or maintenance-\nfree designs. Of these, the replacement of machinery is considered to be the most practical and \nbeneficial.  \n                                                 \n10  World Bank Credit 3123-TJ: Emergency Flood Assistance Project for SDR3.800 million approved on 27 August \n1998, and supplemental credit of SDR1.500 million approved on 14 December 1999. \n11  ADB. 1999.

The opportunities for non-physical improvements include preparation and enactment of \nlegal  and  institutional  reforms  and  the  establishment  of  an  appropriate  permanent  flood \nmanagement institution. The seeds of such an institution have already been planted in the CES. \nAlthough it is currently under-resourced, the CES is generally recognized to be the focus of \ndisaster management activities in Tajikistan and the repository of existing disaster expertise \ninherited from the Soviet era. Legal and regulatory enhancements would enable the CES to \nspecify,  supervise,  and  coordinate  the  disaster-related  activities  of  all  the  implementing \nagencies\u2014notably, in the case of floods, the MLRWR and the Agency for Hydrometeorology. \n \n29.  Further opportunities for legal reform include the removal of ambiguities in existing \nlegislation regarding the responsibility for disseminating flood warnings and responsibility for the \ndesign, construction, and maintenance of flood protection structures. Other legal reforms to \nimprove control of developments in the flood plain are needed. Financial reforms to secure \nannual funding for the flood management activities of the implementing agencies, particularly \nthe operation and maintenance of flood protection works, are also needed. \n \n30.  Detailed  topographic,  social,  environmental  and  economic  surveys  will  evaluate  the \nextent and value of the assets at risk. Computer modeling of flood inundation caused by design \nfloods with probabilities of, for example, 1%, 2%, 4%, 10%, and 20% (average chances of \nflooding once in 100, 50, 25, 10, and 5 years) as well as the necessary training to build national \ncapacity in this specialty will be used to prepare flood risk maps. Community participation in \nsuch surveys will add significantly to their accuracy and usefulness. These maps will become \nkey planning tools with which to delineate flood risk zones. Appropriate flood preparedness \nprograms for each zone will be designed for use by communities, NGOs, local governments and \nthe CES to arrange flood preparedness and amelioration plans. \n \n31.  Effective flood forecasting will help both the Government and communities to lower the \nrisk  of  loss  of  life,  assets,  and  property.    This  requires  reliable  real-time  monitoring  of \nprecipitation  amounts  and  river  levels  and  the  development  of  flood  forecasting  models \nformulated and calibrated against reliable and accessible historical flood data. The possible \neffects of climate change need to be considered through the application of internationally and \nnationally  recognized  scenarios.  Rehabilitation  and  modernization  of  the  Agency  for \nHydrometeorology\u2019s network of climate stations and river gauges all over the country, including \ntelemetry and communication systems, is needed. The hardware and software of the Agency for \nHydrometeorology\u2019s database system need rehabilitating and updating so they can produce \nforecasting models. Disaster response and mitigation activities are coordinated by the Rapid \nEmergency  Assessment  and  Coordination  Team  (REACT),  established  in  2001  by  the \nGovernment  and  the  United  Nations  Office  for  the  Coordination  of  Humanitarian  Affairs \n(UNOCHA). The Project will cooperate with REACT on monitoring and forecasting floods. \n \n32.  There is a key opportunity to develop Government\u2013community joint participation in the \nflood management process.  Such partnerships have been effective in other parts of the world in \nmitigating the damage and hardship caused by flooding. At its best, community participation \ncreates a sense of common cause which can convert victims into protagonists and advocates. \nWhen Government\u2013community partnerships are effective, there is joint active involvement in \nplanning,  emergency  exercises,  mitigation  works,  patrolling,  reporting,  local  infrastructure \nmaintenance, and warnings.  \n \n33.  The Project and an associated proposed Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) \ngrant  will  use  this  opportunity  to  engage  the  Government,  communities,  and  NGOs.  The \nGovernment\u2019s role will include (i) standardization, coordination, simulations, and quality control \nof  local  emergency  plans,  for  evacuation  and  mitigation  of  floods;  (ii)  setup,  training,  and \n ", " 8 \nequipping of local flood warning systems; (iii) arrangements for early warning and information \ncommunications on potential risks and actual flood situations; (iv) training, equipping and supply \nof rapid response teams; and (iv) post-flood surveys and reconstruction support. Community \nparticipation includes mobilizing and arranging disaster evacuation and mitigation plans, setting \nup  voluntary  workforces  to  ease  the  burden  of  flood  infrastructure  maintenance  on  the \nGovernment, establishing communal management and harvesting of a forested riparian buffer \nto supplement hard flood defenses, conducting community monitoring of rivers and storms to \naddress increases in flood risks, and participating in the simulations and other arrangements to \naddress flood risks and events. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n34.  The Project will reduce socioeconomic damage caused by floods in the project area.  \nThe  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  effective and  sustainable  flood management  structural \nfacilities, such as flood embankments, and non-physical flood risk mitigation system comprising \nimproved flood preparedness, forecasting and warning, and also strengthened institutional and \nlegal  framework  concerning  flood  risk  management  that  takes  into  account  social, \nenvironmental and economic factors.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n1.  Institutional and Legal Reforms \n35.  The Project will help Government improve laws and regulations to identify appropriate \nauthority  to  be  responsible  for  flood  management  activities  among  relevant  government \nagencies,  dissemination  of  flood  warnings,  flood  preparedness,  and  maintenance  of  flood \nprotection structures, and for restricting of the use of land in flood prone areas. \n \n36.  Under the component, 116 person-moths of national consulting services were provided \nto support institutional and legal reform, such as to (i) review existing water code, (ii) review \nexisting legal and institutional arrangements to support the implementation of an integrated \nflood management system, (iii) review the role of key institutions for the flood management \nactivities, and (iv) assist the role of secretariat for the amendment of water code, and (v) train \nstaff related to flood management activities.  \n \n  2.  Physical Measures \n \n37.  To achieve a flood protection level of once in 100 years probability in Hamadoni district \n4.8 km of damaged flood embankments will be rehabilitated and 3.5 km of adjacent irrigation \ncanal embankments will be reinforced. Heavy equipment for O&M will be provided to reduce the \ninitial burden of Government expenditure for O&M.  \n \n3.  Non-physical Measures  \n38.  Flood Risk Maps. Under the Project, topographic social, environmental and economic \nsurveys, and computer modeling of flood inundation areas, risk maps will be prepared and \ndisclosed to the public after consultation with stakeholders for the community development plan, \nland use plan, and the location of flood shelters.    \n  ", "    9\n39.  Flood Preparedness. The flood risk maps will be key planning tools. They will delineate \nflood risk zones for which flood preparedness programs will be designed. These programs will \ninclude annual flood awareness campaigns and evacuation drills at district, community, and \nvillage levels and the provision of rapid response team equipment. \n \n40.  Flood  Forecasting.  The  Agency  for  Hydrometeorology\u2019s  entire  network  of  climate \nstations and river gauges in the project area will be rehabilitated and modernized. The hardware \nand  software  components  of  the  database  will  be  upgraded  in  order  to  facilitate  the \ndevelopment of the forecasting models. \n \n41.  Flood Warning. The accuracy and timeliness of flood warning triggers in the project \narea will be improved. In future each flood risk area will receive warnings with a lead time of at \nleast 3 hours and flood water depth forecasts will be accurate to within 0.5 m. Equipment will be \nprovided and villagers will be trained in flood monitoring. \n \n4.  Capacity Building for Efficient Project Management  \n42.  To facilitate Project implementation, the existing PMO under MLRWR will be expanded \nfor the PMO of the Project instead of establishing a new PMO. A group of international and \nnational consultants will support the PMO and train staff of the PMO and project implementation \noffices (PIOs) in project management.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n43.  The Project represents a shift from the previous reactive infrastructure-oriented flood \ncontrol to a comprehensive, integrated and proactive approach to the management of floods. By \nincluding flood warning, public awareness, flood risk maps, and community evacuation plans, \nthe Project will help people to address such risks before they occur. A key feature of this \nintegrated approach is that people living in flood risk areas will be aware of the risk of floods, be \nprepared for them, and take responsibility for monitoring and ameliorating flood risk. \n \n44.  This is the first ADB-funded flood-related project in Tajikistan to be implemented through \nthree agencies in an integrated manner. The MLRWR will operate the PMO and construct \nphysical structures; the Agency for Hydrometeorology will manage the hydrometeorological \nnetwork  and  flood  forecasting;  and  the  CES  will  manage  flood  risk  mapping,  flood \npreparedness, and coordination with local governments and rural communities.  \n \n45.  The very high maintenance needs of the flood protection embankments in the project \narea are a special feature of the project. The main cause of the breach in Hamadoni in 2005 \nwas poor maintenance of the embankments, which are prone to severe damage at high water \nlevels, especially at the spurs. It is difficult to inspect such damage because, even outside the \nflood season, the toes of the embankments are submerged under fast flowing water. The recent \nand  proposed  embankment  rehabilitation  will be  quickly  undermined  if  proper  O&M  is  not \ncarried out. To avoid this, the Government has asked ADB to replace the deteriorated heavy \nequipment currently used for O&M in order to reduce its financial burden. The Government is \nstrongly committed to funding the O&M of the new heavy equipment and the labor and materials \nrequired to maintain the embankments.    \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n46.  The project investment cost is estimated at $28,499,700 equivalent, including taxes and \nduties of $4,898,100, physical and price contingencies of $4,913,500, and $885,100 in interest \n ", " 10 \ncharges during implementation.

Financing Plan \n47.  The Government has requested ADB to provide a loan equivalent to $22.0 million from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the Project.  The loan will have a 32-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1% yearly during the grace period and \n1.5%  yearly  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  set  forth  in  the  loan \nagreement.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n48.  The management arrangements for the Project consist of a project steering committee \n(PSC),  an  executing  agency  (EA),  a  project  management  office  (PMO)  and  three  project \nimplementation offices (PIOs). The organization chart is attached as Appendix 6. \n \n49.  Within three months of the date of the loan effectiveness, the Government will establish \na Project Steering Committee (PSC) to (i) provide policy guidance on the implementation of the \nProject activities and flood management activities financed by other donors; (ii) monitor Project ", "    11\nimpacts; (iii) review and evaluate Project performance; (iv) review Project audits; and (v) ensure \nclose coordination among agencies involved in flood management projects. The PSC will be \nchaired by the First Deputy Prime Minister and comprising senior staff of MLRWR, MAEP, CES, \nand other relevant ministries and agencies. The PSC will be located in the President\u2019s Office \nand shall meet twice a year. The PSC\u2019s sectariat will be located in the PMO.  \n \n50.  MLRWR as the EA will be responsible for overall execution and coordination of the \nProject, and the timely submission to ADB of (i) withdrawal applications; (ii) consolidated Project \nprogress and other reports; (iii) consolidated audited accounts of the Project, MLRWR will also \nimplement  Institutional  and  Legal  Reform  component  and  Improvement  of  Physical \nInfrastructure.  \n \n51.  MAEP  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  rehabilitation  and  modernization  of  the \nnetwork of climate stations and river all over the country and upgrading hardware and software \nto facilitate the development of the forecasting models; CES will be the Implementing Agency \nfor (i) developing flood risk maps based on new topographic social environmental surveys and \ncomputer  modeling  of  flood  prone  areas,  (ii)  developing  appropriate    flood  preparedness \nprogram and conducting annual flood awareness campaigns and evacuation drills at district and \ncommunity levels; and (iii) improving the accuracy and timeliness of the existing flood warning \ntriggers in the Project area so that each flood prone area receives flood warnings.  \n \n52.  The  project  management  office  set  up  under  the  ongoing  ADB-financed  Irrigation \nRehabilitation Project (footnote 15) will serve as the PMO for this Project. The PMO will be \nresponsible for (i) implementing Project activities in accordance with the Project design; (ii) \ncoordinating activities between PIOs and other agencies concerned; (iii) ensuring compliance \nwith environmental requirements and other safeguard measures; (iv) maintaining appropriate \naccounts,  including  reports  on  withdrawal  applications  and  disbursement;  (v)  carrying  out \nprocurement  activities;  and  (vi)  preparing  quarterly  progress  and  other  reports  in  format \nacceptable to ADB. At all times throughout Project implementation, PMO remains adequately \nstaffed with professional and clerical personnel with the necessary experience and expertise in \nfinance, accounting, procurement and contract administration.  \n \n53.  Within three months of the loan effectiveness, each of the PMO, MAEP, and CES \nestablishes  an  adequately  staffed  PIO.  Each  PIO  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day \nimplementation  of  the  respective  component  of  the  Project,  including  (i)  supervision  of \ncontractors and consultants; (ii) preparation of the draft progress report and other necessary \nrelated documents; and (iii) coordination of the activities under the respective component.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n54.  The Project will be implemented from 2008 to 2013 with the project completion expected \nby December 2013. The closing date for disbursement will be 6 months from the date of project \ncompletion. The implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 7.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n55.  All ADB-financed procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). ADB will finance procurement of civil works, vehicles, materials \nand  equipment  as  described  in  the  procurement  plan  (Appendix  8).  Contracts  valued  in \nexcess of $1 million will be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB).16  \n                                                 \n16  Preference will be given to the domestic contractors for civil works.  \n ", " 12 \nContracts valued at less than $1 million may follow ICB, national competitive bidding (NCB), or \nlimited international bidding (LIB) as determined by the particular circumstances of the contract \npackage.  Procurement  under  NCB  will  follow  the  Government\u2019s  legislation  on  state \nprocurement,  subject  to  modifications  and  clarifications  set  forth  in  the  loan  agreement. \nProcurement below $100,000 may follow the shopping procedure. The relevant sections of \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  will  be  included  in  all  documents  during  bidding  for,  and \nimplementation of, the Project.    \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n56.  The Project will provide a total of 486 person-months of consulting services, comprising \n72 person-months of international consultants and 414 person-months of national consultants. \nTo minimize reliance on consultants and the burden of consulting services costs, the input of \ninternational consultants has been kept to a minimum, restricted in terms of time provided and \nto  areas  for  which  technical  capacity  is  limited  in  government  agencies.  Institutional  and \ncapacity building has been built into the project design.  \n \n57.  The consultants will assist the executing agency in (i) project management, (ii) legal and \ninstitutional  arrangements,  (iii)  training  of  staff  related  to  flood  management  activities,  \n(iv) strengthening of embankment maintenance capacity, (v) preparation of a flood risk map,  \n(vi) preparation of emergency plans, (vii) strengthening of the hydrometeorology network, (viii) \nimproving the flood warning system, and (ix) preparation of the feasibility study report on flood \nmanagement for the Yahksu and Kizilsu rivers. An international consultant firm will be selected \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time), using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) method and requiring a full \ntechnical proposal. The terms of reference of consultants are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n58.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed  \nwith the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan. Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the loan and grant regulations and in the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will include the provisions specifying \nthe right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the MLRWR and of all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. The \nGovernment  will  undertake  necessary  measures  to  publicly  disclose  Project-related \nprocurement  actions  such  as  information  on  adopted  bidding  procedures,  specifications  of \ngoods, works and consulting services, participating bidders and award of contracts. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n59.  The Loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook, January 2007, as amended from time to time. To facilitate project implementation \nand funds flow the first-generation imprest account (FGIA) and two second-generation imprest \naccounts will be set up in the commercial banks acceptable to ADB and will be exclusively used \nto finance ADB share of eligible expenditures. The first-generation imprest account will be set \nup upon effectiveness and managed by PMO. Two second-generation imprest accounts (SGIA) \nwill be set up three months after the loan effectiveness and managed by MAEP and CES. The \nfunds flow to SGIAs will be only from the FGIA of PMO.  The imprest account and each SGIA ", "    13\nwill  be  established,  managed,  replenished  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the Government and \nADB. The currency of the imprest account and each SGIA will be Dollar. The initial amount to be \ndeposited into the imprest account will not exceed the lower of (i) the estimated expenditure for \nthe first six months of Project implementation to be financed from the imprest account, or (ii) the \nequivalent of 10% of the Loan amount. The initial amount to be deposited into each SGIA will \nnot exceed the lower of (a) the estimated expenditure for the first six months of the Project to be \nfinanced from the SGIA, or (b) the equivalent of 10% of the Loan Amount. The PMO will ensure \nthat every liquidation and replenishment of each SGIA from FGIA should be supported with (i) \nthe statement of account (bank statement) prepared by the bank, where SGIA is maintained, (ii) \nSGIA reconciliation statement, reconciling the above-mentioned bank statement against the \nSGIA records, (iii) and supporting documents as required. \n \n60.  The  direct  payment  procedures  will  apply  for  the  large  works  contracts.  If  the \nGovernment initially funds eligible expenditures from its  own resources the reimbursement \nprocedures  will  be  used.  To  expedite  funds  flow  and  simplify  documentation  process,  the \nStatement of Expenditures Procedure will be used for liquidation and replenishment of imprest \naccount and reimbursement of eligible expenditures not exceeding $100,000 per individual \npayment. The payments in excess of the statement of expenditure ceiling will be reimbursed, \nliquidated or replenished based on full supporting documentation process. \n \n7.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n61.  The rehabilitation and construction of flood protection embankments in the Pyanj river \ncan be done only during the non-flood season (November to April). At the Government\u2019s request \nand to facilitate timely project implementation, ADB has approved the retroactive financing. \nWithdrawal from the Loan account will be made for reimbursement of reasonable expenditures \nincurred within the Project before the loan effectiveness, but not earlier than twelve (12) months \nbefore the date of loan agreement in connection with civil works for rehabilitation of flood \nprotection  embankment  and  the  Project  related  services,  subject  to  a  maximum  amount \nequivalent to 20 % of the loan amount. The Government has been informed that (i) advance \naction for the procurement of items other than those covered under retroactive financing will \ncover actions up to, but not including, contract signing, and (ii) approval of advance action and \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the Project.  \n \n62.  Because of the urgency, the location of the project area adjacent to the international \nborder, and the relatively simple nature of work, the proposed civil works package for the \nretroactive financing portion will not be attractive to large international contractors. Therefore the \ncivil works will be divided into five packages for NCB, each of which will be less than $1 million. \nNational contractors have a good track record of performance in the construction of the flood \nprotection embankment in Hamadoni district.  \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n63.  The Government will cause MLRWR, MAEP, CES, the PMO and PIOs to maintain \nseparate accounts and financial statements for the Project, which will be audited annually by \nindependent auditors acceptable to ADB. Loan proceeds will be used to engage auditors. \nCertified copies of the audited financial statements will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of \nthe end of the fiscal year to which they relate. A separate opinion on the use of FGIA, SGIAs \nand statement of expenditures procedures will be included in the audit report. The Government \nwas informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of audited accounts, which covers procedures in \nthe event of failure in submitting audited accounts and financial statements by the due date. A \n ", " 14 \nformal  warning  will  be  issued  for  accounts  that  are  more  than  6  months  overdue  and \ndisbursements will be suspended for accounts that are more than 12 months overdue. \n \n64.  Through the PMO, MLRWR will submit quarterly and annual reports to ADB. The reports \nwill indicate progress made and problems encountered during the period under review, steps \ntaken to remedy the problems, the proposed program of activities, and expected progress \nduring the remaining implementation period. MLRWR will also provide such other reports and \ninformation relating to the Project as ADB may reasonably request, including but not limited to \nthe  Project\u2019s  environmental  impacts,  gender  action  plan  and  progress,  dialogue  with \nbeneficiaries,  and  any  social  issues  relating  to  the  Project.  Within  3  months  of  physical \ncompletion of the Project, MLRWR will submit to ADB a project completion report detailing \nproject implementation, use of the loan proceeds, and the extent to which the objectives of the \nProject have been accomplished. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n65.  Within three months of the loan effectiveness, a monitoring and evaluation unit will be \nestablished  in  the  PMO  to  monitor  Project  performance,  including  among  other  things, \nenvironmental, poverty, gender, and social impacts and progress of various reform measures. \nInformation on monitoring progress will be included in quarterly progress reports. \n \n66.  Within  three  months  of  the  loan  effectiveness,  the  PMO  will  establish  a  Project \nPerformance  Management  System  in  accordance  with  the  Project  performance  indicators \ndescribed in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \n10.  Project Review \n67.  The Project will be reviewed regularly by ADB missions. ADB and the Government will \nmeet regularly as required to discuss the progress of the Project and any changes to the \nimplementation  arrangements  or  remedial  measures  required  to  be  undertaken  towards \nachieving the outcome of the Project. A midterm review of the Project will be undertaken by \nADB and the Government in 2009. The midterm review will include review of issues concerning \nProject  implementation  arrangements,  institutional,  administrative,  organizational,  technical, \nenvironmental and social, economic, financial, and other aspects that may have an impact on \nthe performance of the Project and its sustainability. The review will assess the compliance with \nloan covenants and agree on any changes required. \n \n68.  During the third year of the Project implementation, the Government and ADB will carry \nout another mid-term review. Project impact will be measured against the performance criteria \nlisted in Appendix 1. The parameters for assessing the implementation milestones will include (i) \nimplementation  status,  (ii)  design  and  construction  standards,  (iii)  physical  progress  and \ndisbursement in relation to the implementation schedule, (iv) performance of the consultants \nand contractors, (v) status of compliance with loan covenants, and (vi) status of achievement of \nthe Project\u2019s impact. The midterm review will also assess the need for changes in the Project, \nincluding the project framework, scope, implementing arrangements, monitoring arrangements, \nand budget, and recommended measures to achieve Project impact. The project progress \naccording to the SIEE and gender action plan will also be reviewed.  ", "    15\nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefit \n69.  Flood  management  of  the  Pyanj  river  at  Hamadoni  provides  public  goods  for  the \nrelatively densely populated province of Khatlon. There is therefore a strong rationale for public \nintervention. The Project includes both physical and non-physical components but most funding \nhas been allocated to the rehabilitation or construction of embankments and this is expected to \naccount for most of the easily measurable economic benefits. The economic analysis therefore \nfocused on this activity, although the likely benefits of other activities are also discussed. \n \n70.  Economic analysis of the project was conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Economic Analysis of Projects (1997) and was based on an analysis of the damage caused \nby the July 2005 flood and an extrapolation to estimate the expected impacts of floods with \nvarious return periods. The economic value of flood protection was estimated as the economic \nvalue  of  the  losses  avoided  as  a  result  of  investment  in  flood  protection  (the with-project \nscenario) compared with the economic losses suffered without investment in flood protection \n(the without-project scenario).17 \n \n71.  Assuming that a medium level of maintenance is achieved, it is considered that the \nproposed embankments can effectively protect against floods with a 100-year return period.   \nThe economic analysis shows that the annualized benefits would be TJS8.148 million with an \neconomic rate of return of 16.0%.  If it is only possible to achieve a low level of maintenance, \nthe level of protection with the project will be reduced to a 50-year return period and the \nannualized level of benefits will be TJS7.038 million with an economic rate of return of 13.7%. \n \nB.  Project Sustainability \n72.  The financial capacities of the three implementing agencies (MLRWR, the CES, and the \nAgency  for  Hydrometeorology)  were  assessed.  It  was  concluded  that  the  PMO  should  be \nlocated  in  the  MLRWR  because  this  ministry  has  project  management  and  financial \nmanagement experience built up over a number of years and projects, notably the Irrigation \nRehabilitation Project (footnote 15). Also, the bulk of the proposed loan relates to components \nthat will be implemented by MLRWR. \n \n73.  The CES and the Agency for Hydrometeorology have more limited project management \nexperience and the project components assigned to them are of relatively low value. It was \ntherefore decided they should each house a project implementation office rather than individual \nproject management offices.  \n \n74.  The  O&M  of  the  completed  rehabilitation  or  construction  work  has  been  a  key \nconsideration for sustainability because of the Government\u2019s previous inability to operate and \nmaintain the existing flood management systems adequately, particularly the flood defenses \nand river monitoring network infrastructure. O&M has been discussed with the relevant technical \ndepartments and also at ministerial and Deputy Prime Minister levels.  As a result, a project \ncomponent involves replacing MLRWR\u2019s stock of depreciated civil works plant in Hamadoni \ndistrict with modern machinery, thus lightening the financial burden on MLRWR. To complement \nthis, the Government has undertaken to provide adequate funds for routine O&M of the new \nmachinery and flood embankments. The machinery will be used to clean irrigation canals during \nflood season, and will therefore be in use all year round. \n                                                 \n17  See Supplementary Appendix C for further analysis of the sector. \n ", " 16 \nC.  Environmental Impacts \n75.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  has  been  conducted  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003), as well as \nwith Tajikistan\u2019s applicable laws and regulations. The Project is classified as category B. There \nwill  be  no  significant  adverse  long-term  environmental  impacts.  The  construction  of  the \nembankments will have some local impacts on flow pattern and scouring but these effects will \nextend only a few meters into the river channel. As the system and braided river channels \nextend some 5-10 km toward Afghanistan, the wider effects will be insignificant and there will be \nno  trans-boundary  impacts.  The  socioeconomic  and  environmental  benefits  will  be \nconsiderable,  in  terms  of  improved  security  against  floods.  The  project  will  generate \nemployment  opportunities  during  construction  and  maintenance  of  the  embankments.  The \nsummary initial environmental examination (SIEE) is attached in Appendix 9.  \n \nD.  Involuntary Resettlement \n76.  By their very nature, floods force involuntary resettlement. The core purposes of the \nProject are to assist in the prevention of floods and in the advance preparation of households so \nthey  can  cope  more  effectively  in  areas  where  floods  do  occur.  Land  acquisition  and \nresettlement needs have been assessed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy (1995), as well as Tajikistan\u2019s applicable laws and regulations. The nature and location of \nthe  proposed  Project  will  not  require  any  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  of  households \nbecause the embankments to be rehabilitated and the temporary access roads will occupy \nabout 10-15 ha of government land. Most of the construction activities will take place on the \nriverbank of Pyanj which is a depopulated border area. Therefore, no involuntary resettlement \nimpacts are envisioned in relation to the flood embankments. At the feasibility study level, no \nland acquisition is expected. However, in case of an unforeseeable change of structure design, \nthere is a possibility that unexpected land acquisition may arise. Therefore, a resettlement \nframework was prepared and agreed by the Government (Appendix 10). In case a small-scale \nland acquisition is required, an outline resettlement framework has been developed to ensure \nthat communities will not be negatively affected.   \n \nE.  Indigenous Peoples  \n77.  An  assessment  of  the  Project\u2019s  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  was  undertaken  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Indigenous Peoples Policy (1998). According to the population census \nof 2000, 70% of the population of the project area is Tajik, 25% is Uzbek, and 5% is ethnic \nminorities (most are married to ethnic Tajiks). Generally, non-Tajik populations in southern \nTajikistan speak fluent Tajik as well as their native languages. They enjoy the same rights as \nthe  Tajik  majority,  regularly  intermarry  with  Tajik  households,  and  are  fully  integrated  into \ninstitutional, cultural, and economic processes. Consequently, they do not face discrimination.  \nThese  groups  are  not  sufficiently  separate  to  justify  classification  as  indigenous  peoples. \nTherefore, all ethnic groups in the project area are equally positioned to benefit from the \nstructural and nonstructural measures of the Project. No specific actions for ethnic minorities are \nenvisioned for this project. \n \nF.  Gender and Development  \n78.  Gender inequality in the project area reflects the national situation. There has been a \nretreat from the Soviet era emphasis on gender equity, and women are less likely to be found in \npositions of community, business, or government leadership than in previous periods. Women\u2019s \nsalaries are about 40% those of men, and women tend to be clustered in low-wage occupations ", "    17\nsuch as teaching and farm labor. Gender relations are complicated by the significant levels of \nmigration (40% or more) of rural men to Russia to work, leaving women at home to manage \nfamilies, farms, and other household responsibilities. Under flood conditions, women and men \nface equal trauma and stress, but as women are primary caregivers and responsible for the \nhousehold and food they face more immediate demands. \n \n79.  Gender issues will be addressed by (i) including gender-related aspects in dialogues \nwith central and local governments, stakeholder meetings, and other forums during the Project; \n(ii) making specific efforts to include women professionals from government offices in project \nmeetings and decision-making; (iii) encouraging local contractors to employ women, including \ndisadvantaged women; (iv) ensuring that 40% of the trainees at CES flood awareness and \npreparedness  training  programs  are  women;  (v)  ensuring  that  50%  of  trainees  in  flood \nmanagement issues at the grassroots level are women. A gender development plan is attached \nin Supplementary Appendix D. \n \nG.  Social and Poverty Impacts \n80.  Poverty is endemic in the project area and, apart from the 6% of the population in white \nor blue collar jobs or in business, virtually everyone is poor.  Surveys of rural households reveal \nthat floods and other natural disasters are a major cause of poverty.   Field validation revealed \nthe following adverse impacts of previous floods on households in the project area, particularly \nfor the poor:  \n \n(i)  loss of personal property, houses, and livestock and consequent damage to \nfamily living conditions;  \n(ii)  significant declines in income levels; \n(iii)  emergence of higher levels of disease;  \n(iv)  decreased agricultural yields; \n(v)  deterioration in drinking water quality; \n(vi)  decline in access to essential services; and \n(vii)  increased labor migration.   \n \n81.  The population of the project area as a whole will benefit directly from government work \nto increase awareness of floods and their effects, improve preparedness for flood events and \nreadiness to act quickly to limit losses, and raise awareness of post-flood actions to limit \ndisease, non-agricultural losses, and damage to household goods.  \n \n82.  Work to create both community cohesion and better relations between different levels of \ngovernment and community groups will take place through the loan and the proposed Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) grant. The result will be better understanding by both sides \nof the conditions and concerns of the poor, which will lead to better information flows on how to \naddress issues of poverty related to disasters. \n \n83.  A poverty and social analysis has been conducted for the Project in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis (2001). A summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy for the Project is in Appendix 11. \n \nH.  Project Risks \n84.  There is a risk that river flow greater than the 100-year flow would damage the project \ncomponents before they are complete. There is also a risk that if the Pyanj river suddenly \nchanges  course  it  would  erode  the  embankments  before  rehabilitation  is  completed.  The \n ", " 18 \nprobability of these risks is very low, but the PMO and PIOs have to be aware of them and they \nwill need to establish early warning systems to avoid any loss of equipment or other assets.   \n \n85.  If the quality of the completed flood protection embankment is poor and not strong \nenough to withstand the floods, the embankment will be breached easily. This risk will be \nmitigated  by  providing  sufficient  numbers  of  supervisory  staff  and  consultants  for  full-time \nsupervision of the contractors. To strengthen the capacity of the staff in the PMO or PIOs, \ntechnical and managerial training for supervisory staff will be provided under the Project.  \n \n86.  If  the  Government  cannot  provide  sufficient  O&M  budget  for  the  completed  flood \nprotection embankment, it will be easily damaged by the future floods. This risk has been \nmitigated by including in the loan agreement a provision for heavy equipment to maintain the \ncompleted embankments and a strong commitment from the Government to provide sufficient \nbudget for fuel, lubricant and spare parts for heavy equipment, which are clearly mentioned in \nthe loan agreement.    \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n87.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \nassurances. \n \nA.  Operation and Maintenance Cost  \n88.  The Government will annually allocate at least the amount equivalent to $50,000 (plus \ninflation since 2007) for maintenance of the flood protection facilities rehabilitated under the \nProject upon their handover by the contractor to MLRWR. \n \n89.  The Government will ensure that its actual total annual expenditures for the maintenance \n(including emergency maintenance, but excluding rehabilitation and construction) of the flood \nprotection facilities along the Pyanj river will be increased by at least at the same rate as \nincreases in the overall national budget during 2008\u20132013. \n \nB.  Amendment of Water Code  \n90.  The Government will amend the existing Water Code and other relevant legislation to \ninclude the concept of flood management and a more integrated approach to flood damage, and \nto coordinate flood-related ministries and agencies in the Government by the end of 2008.  \n \nC.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement   \n91.  The Government will ensure that (i) no land acquisition is expected and no resettlement \nis  required  under  the  Project,  and  (ii)  Project  activities  are  conducted  within  existing \nGovernment-owned  rights-of-way.    In  the  event  of  any  unforeseen  land  acquisition  or \nresettlement  needs, the  Government  will inform  ADB  and  prepare a  Resettlement  Plan  in \naccordance  with  Government\u2019s  applicable  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995) and the Resettlement Framework.  The Government will ensure that \n(i) no contract is awarded until a Resettlement Plan, if required for the respective Package, has \nbeen  approved  by  ADB,  and  (ii)  no  notice  to  proceed  is  given  to  a  contractor  until  such \nResettlement Plan has been implemented in accordance with its terms. \n ", "    19\nD.  Environment  \n92.  The Government through the EA and the implementing agencies will ensure that project \ncontractors  implement  social  and  environmental  impact  management  in  compliance  with \napplicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  and  per \nrecommendations of the IEE, and will translate the environmental management plan of the IEE \ninto  a  contract-specific environmental  management  plan,  which  will  be  incorporated  in  the \nbidding documents and civil work contracts. The executing agency will submit an annual report \non  environmental  performance  during  project  implementation.  Compliance  with  all  laws, \nregulations and ADB policies will be answered during operation. \n \nE.  Gender and Development  \n93.  The Government through the EA will monitor the project impacts on women throughout \nimplementation,  in  consultation  with  local  governments,  women's  associations,  and  NGOs \nthroughout Project implementation.  The Government will ensure that within six (6) months of \nthe loan effectiveness, the PMO will have developed the gender action plan. The PMO will \nimplement the gender action plan in a timely manner and will ensure that adequate resources \nare allocated for this purpose. The Government ensure, among other things, that (i) specific \nefforts are made to include women professionals from government offices in project meetings \nand  decision-making  process;  (ii)  contractors  are  encouraged  to  employ  women,  including \ndisadvantaged  women;  (iii)  up  to  40%  of  the  trainees  at  CES  flood  awareness  and \npreparedness  training  programs  are  women;  and  (iv)  up  to  50%  of  trainees  in  flood \nmanagement issues at the grassroots level are women. \n \nF.  Employment  \n94.  The Government will (i) encourage the use of local labor and procurement of local \nmaterials, and (ii) ensure that project contractors (a) comply with applicable labor laws, including \nproviding for equal payment to men and women for work of equal type, in accordance with \nnational laws and international treaty obligations, and (b) abstain from using child labor. \n \nG.  Health and Social Risks  \n95.  The Government will ensure that all civil works contractors engaged under the Project \ndisseminate information (in local language on the risks of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), \nincluding HIV/AIDS, in health and safety programs for all construction workers at camp sites. \nSpecific provisions to this effect will be included in bidding documents and civil works contracts, \nand compliance will be strictly monitored by PMO. The Government will ensure strict border \ncontrol to detect trafficking of humans, wildlife, endangered species, and illegal substances in \nthe Project area. \n \nH.  Construction Quality  \n96.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  flood  protection  facilities  rehabilitated  or \nconstructed  under  the  Project  comply  with  technical  specifications of  the  design,  and  that \nconstruction supervision, quality control, and project management is performed according to \ninternationally accepted standards and practices. \n ", " 20 \nI.  Policy Dialogue \n97.  The Government will ensure that ADB is kept informed about the Borrower's policies, \nstrategies and programs related to the flood risk management that may materially affect the \nProject. \n \nJ.  Governance and Anticorruption \n98.  The  Government  will  (i)  undertake  necessary  measures  to  create  and  sustain  a \ncorruption-free environment; (ii) ensure that its anticorruption laws and regulations and ADB's \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) are strictly enforced and are being complied \nwith during Project implementation, and relevant provisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are \nincluded in all bidding documents for the Project, (iii) facilitate ADB in exercising its right to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive \npractices relating to the Project; (iv) ensure that MLRWR, MAEP and CES conduct periodic \ninspections on the contractors' activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements; and (v) \nensure that all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project include provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of MLRWR, MAEP \nand CES and all contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers related to the \nProject. \n \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n99.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 14,403,000 to the Republic of Tajikistan for the \nKhatlon Province Flood Risk Management Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement \npresented to the Board.  \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda  \nPresident \n \n14 September 2007  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  ", "     Appendix 1     21 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nTargets/Indicators  Mechanisms    and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nReduced flood risks in  Flood frequency reduced  Annual monitoring reports of   \nKhatlon province  from 1 in 10  in 2007 to 1  flood damage on agricultural  Government sustains flood \nin 100 in Hamadoni district  production and non- preparedness programs \nby 2013  agricultural losses to CES by   \n  district and community   \nleaders   \n \nHousehold surveys by the \nGovernment and \ninternational agencies \nproviding flood assistance \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nEffective and sustainable  Full implementation of  Annual Reports  River flows are large enough \nflood management  flood management    to test the project components \nsystems are operational  concept through Amended  Project Survey   \nand well maintained  Water Code by 2013    Flood protection embankment  \n    Project Report  Is properly maintained \n  Annual budget allocated     \n  enough to operate  CES and local government   \nequipment for O&M  Reports \n   \n \nOutputs       Assumption \n1.

General \n1.  Tajikistan is a mountainous and landlocked country.  Because of the steep slopes and \nrugged nature of much of the country, only 7% of the land area is arable. The main mountain \nranges are the Pamirs in the east of the country, the Gissar Range running east to west to the \nnorth of Dushanbe, and the Turkestan Range running parallel to the Gissar Mountains just to \nthe north of the Zeravshan river. The highest points lie in the western and northern Pamirs, \nnotably Mount Somoni at 7,195 meters (m) above sea level. \n \n2.  The  climate  is  classified  as  continental  to  sub-tropical,  with  temperatures  strongly \ncontrolled by altitude. At lower altitudes, winter temperatures are occasionally as low as -10\u00b0C, \nrising  to  temperatures  in  excess  of  40\u00b0C  occasionally  in  the  summer.  Snowmelt  in  the \nmountains occurs gradually, taking place from March (in the lower hills) through to August in the \nhigh mountains. There are extensive areas of permanent snow and glaciers within the highest \nmountains. \n \n3.  Rainfall occurs predominantly in the winter and spring months in the west, and during \nthe summer in the east. The spatial distribution of mean annual precipitation shows three \ndistinct zones: the low precipitation northern zone; the high precipitation west and central zone, \nand the dry eastern zone.  \n \n4.  Tajikistan has a significant flood problem, arising largely from its mountainous nature. \nThe geologically young mountain system under active erosion and steep mountain slopes in \nmany parts of the country creates conditions that easily generate very destructive floods. While \nannual total rainfall values within the country are not high, destructive floods can be caused by \nintensive storm rainfall, with daily falls in excess of 100 mm not unknown. Floods on the larger \nrivers tend to be generated through rapid snowmelt, coupled with periods of heavy rainfall. \n \n5.  Floods have been generated in the past through four main mechanisms:   \n(i)  fluvial  floods,  resulting  from  river  discharges  in  excess  of  channel  capacity \novertopping river banks and causing inundation; \n(ii)  mudflows  resulting  from  particularly  intense  storm  rainfall  over  steep  and \nunstable catchments;  \n(iii)  surface runoff, which washes down a lot of soil and rocky debris resulting in a \nmixture of water and alluvium being deposited in the \"outwash\" area of the small \ncatchment; and \n(iv)  outburst floods caused by the sudden release of water held back in a river by a \nnatural  blockage  and  arising  from  avalanches,  landslides,  mudslides,  glacier \nmovements, and similar processes. \n \n6.  The years 1998 and 1999 were particularly bad for flooding, and in 2000 there was a \nbad drought. Flood years cause the loss of human lives, damage to thousands of houses, and \ndestruction of tens of thousands of hectares of crops, with damage of the order of tens of \nmillions of dollars. All areas are affected, including the relatively densely populated southern \nprovince of Khatlon. In the years since independence, the fertile flood plains adjacent to the \nPyanj, Kizilsu and Yakhsu rivers in Khatlon province have become increasingly vulnerable to \nfloods. Lives have been lost and flood embankments, houses, canals, land, roads and bridges \nhave been destroyed. Severe floods were experienced in Kulyab, Vose and Farkhor districts in \n1998 and 1999 caused by floods in the Yakhsu and Kizilsu river systems. Smaller floods since ", "  Appendix 2  25 \nthen have caused further damage. A major flood took place in 2005 in Hamadoni district caused \nby the flooding of the Pyanj river. \n \n7.  The  most  important  environmental  issue  is  the  conflict  between  agriculture  and \nsettlement on the flood plains and the naturally violent and unstable nature of the rivers. To \nsustain agricultural production and urban development, the rivers have to be managed very \ncarefully. Unfortunately, since independence in 1992, this has been beyond the means of \ncentral,  provincial  and  district  governments.  Consequently  there  has  been  progressive \ndestruction of land, property, and infrastructure. \n \n8.  The combination of low gross national product (GNP) and high-impact floods and other \nnatural disasters on the national, provincial and local economies is a serious brake on social \ndevelopment and economic growth and potentially on political stability. \n \nB.  Flood Protection Risk  \n \n9.  In recent years the Government has been forced into a strategy of reactive emergency \nrepairs which have had to be funded partly by international donors and lenders and partly from \nstate  reserves.  This  is  because  of  a  lack  of  central  recurrent  budgets  for  operation  and \nmaintenance and also because of the inability of water users to pay for flood protection. To \nsome  extent  international  donors  and  lenders  have  been  dragged  into  the  same  strategy \nbecause of a succession of serious natural disasters in Tajikistan in recent years and the \nseemingly unstoppable social and economic calamities they have caused. For its part, the \nMinistry of Land Reclamation and Water Resources (MLRWR) has been unable to carry out the \nnecessary routine maintenance work in the project area due to financial constraints.  \n \nC.  Flood Management Institutions \n \n10.  The primary flood management institutions are the State Commissions for Emergency \nSituations  (SCES),  the  Committee  for  Emergency  Situations  (CES),  the  MLRWR  and  the \nAgency for Hydrometeorology within the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment Protection \n(MAEP). However, their specific roles and responsibilities with respect to flood management are \nnot completely specified in the underlying legislation and are not integrated or well coordinated \nwithin a coherent flood management system.  \n \n11.  The SCES are temporary institutions which are set up at national, provincial, or district \nlevels, in response to the severity and extent of an emergency situation. They comprise senior \nnational and local government members in proportion to the scale of the disaster. The functions \nof the SCES are to direct the activities of the emergency services, manage resources, and \ncoordinate local, national and international relief efforts. \n \n12.  The CES is responsible for disaster preparedness. Through branch offices at provincial \nand district levels, it promotes disaster awareness and, with increasing assistance from national \nand  international  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  disseminates  early  warnings  and \nprovides  community  training  to  raise  the  level  of  preparedness.  The  CES  has  lacked  the \nresources to deliver a comprehensive programme but improvements are now being made with \nsupport from a number of international donors and programmes. \n \n13.  The  MLRWR  is  responsible  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  river  banks  and \nengineering structures such as flood embankments and intakes and outfalls. District branch \noffices monitor operations and report maintenance needs. Historically, the MLRWR approach to \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nthe construction, operation and maintenance of these structures has been driven mainly by \nagricultural needs, but the increasing frequency of flood damage since independence in 1992 \nindicates that a revision of this approach is required. \n \n14.  The Agency for Hydrometeorology, which has recently become a department of the \nMAEP, is responsible for monitoring the natural environment and issuing routine public bulletins. \nIt  also  provides  emergency  advice  to  government  departments  if  potentially  hazardous \ncircumstances are detected.  \n \nD.  Existing Flood Management Performance \n \n15.  The  current  approach  to  flood  management  is  now  widely  recognised  by  the \nGovernment and by the donor and lender community to be unsustainable. There is a growing \nacceptance that it needs to be replaced by a more holistic and strategic approach to flood \nmanagement.  \n \n16.  Maintaining flood protection structures is a considerable challenge for the Government. \nOn the one hand, the main beneficiaries are indebted farmers who cannot afford to pay for all \nthe water and flood protection services that they receive. On the other hand the Government \nevidently cannot afford to carry out sufficient maintenance work, partly because the heavy \nmachinery currently available for maintenance works is generally more than 25 years old, \ndeteriorated and partially unserviceable, and partly because it cannot afford the best available \nmaterials and construction methods.  \n \n18.  The  design  and  construction  of  flood  embankments  and  spurs  generally  aims  for \nmaximum land use combined with economy and expediency. However, this approach inevitably \ncreates high maintenance requirements and costs. \n \n19.  At  present,  monitoring  and  observation  network  consists  of  57  hydrometeorological \nstations in Tajikistan. However, this network currently does not meet the general internationally \naccepted standard of climate observation. From 1991 to 2005, the national hydrometeorological \nnetwork  was  reduced  by  20%  due  to  the  shortage  of  the  Government  budget  for  proper \nmaintenance.  It  is  necessary  to  fully  repair  38  hydrometeorological  stations  and  30 \nhydrometeorological posts, and reconstruct 6 stations, 10 hydrometeorogical posts and 18 air \npollution observation posts \n \n20.  The existing flood risk on the plains of the Kizilsu and Yakhsu rivers in Kulyab, Vose and \nFrakhor districts is very high because of the destruction of flood embankments since 1998. At \nleast 15 km of flood embankments have been destroyed. The probability of flooding in certain \nparts may now be higher than 50% (an average chance of flooding once in 2 years). This leaves \ncommunities, infrastructure and valuable agricultural land highly vulnerable to further loss or \ndamage on an almost annual basis. In effect there is no flood protection in some places. \n \n21.  The flood warning systems, including the hydrometeorological monitoring network, that \nwere in place during the Soviet era are now mostly inoperative. However, there is a warning \nsystem for the Pyanj river at Hamadoni based on the rate of rise of the river level at Khirmanjo, \napproximately 100 km upstream. However, the warnings are inaccurate because of the poor \ncondition of the river gauge and operational difficulties caused by its location on the Afghanistan \nborder.  A flood warning system has recently been restored on the Yakhsu river at Karboztonak. \nThe system is linked to the Agency for Hydrometeorology in Dushanbe and also, by radio, to ", "  Appendix 2  27 \ndownstream communities. Other community flood warning systems are being introduced or \nproposed by international NGOs such as Mission East and Oxfam. \n \n22.  According to the results of the recent ADB technical assistance (TA)1 social survey in the \nproject area, only 62% of flood victims are aware that flood warning systems exist and only 53% \nhave actually received warnings. Nevertheless, there is a consensus that early warnings can \nhelp  to  limit  flood  damage  but  for  these  to  be  disseminated  successfully  in  villages  and \nneighborhoods, an improvement in telecommunications is essential, supplemented by alarms \nand sirens in high-risk zones. \n \n23.  Flood victims have recommended that emergency procedures be published as posters \nand that evacuation drills be stepped up, particularly for women. About 47% of respondents to \nthe survey were prepared to be permanently relocated in order to avoid further flooding, but they \nalso  mentioned  that  this  could  be  a  traumatic  process  because  of  opaque  bureaucratic \nprocedures, poor facilities in the replacement housing stock, and hostility in the new location. \n \nE.  Impact of Flooding \n \n24.  The socioeconomic impact of flooding is high and involves substantial loss of livelihoods. \nAccording to the recent TA social survey in Kulyab, Vose, Farkhor, and Hamadoni, only 7% of \nflood victims believed their income had been below average prior to flooding, whereas 71% \nbelieved it had fallen below average after flooding. This correlated with their estimates that \nproduction  of  grain  had  fallen  by  70%,  of  vegetables  by  83%  and  of  grapes  by  95%. \nRespondents said they had lost 38% of their cattle and 58% of their poultry; 96% of their houses \nhad been seriously or moderately damaged; and 54% of their land had been flooded and \ninundated with debris.  \n \n25.  Other  socioeconomic  impacts  include  increases  in  diseases,  poorer  drinking  water \nquality, water logging of land, and greater emigration. \n \n26.  There has been progressive destruction of land, property and infrastructure, particularly \nsince independence in 1992. Unfortunately, reversing this trend has been beyond the means of \ncentral, provincial, and district governments. \n \n27.  In the Kizilsu and Yakhsu valleys, the rivers have been severely constrained between \ntight flood embankments on both sides with the adjacent land heavily developed for agriculture \nand settlement. This rigid river training has encouraged the transport of gravel and silt further \ndown the valleys than would naturally be the case, raising riverbed levels and flood levels. In \nKulyab and Vose, the main channels of the Kizilsu and Yakhsu rivers appear to have little \ncapacity left. Consequently the embankments have been scoured, overtopped and breached. \nFurthermore, the lack of adequate maintenance has allowed once minor damage to spread \nalmost unchecked until it becomes a major issue. In 2007, many villages and farms in Kulyab \nand Vose are highly vulnerable to serious flooding. The practice of excavating river gravels \nclose to the embankments may have exacerbated the region\u2019s vulnerability. \n \nF.  Scope for Improved Flood Management \n \n28.  Flooding is a natural process that supports a variety of natural ecosystems in a river  \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2006.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  Preparing  the  Khatlon  Province  Flood \nManagement Project. Manila. \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nbasin, particularly on flood plains. Flood plains are dynamic geomorphologic units in which river \nchannels shift from time to time and sediment is redistributed. Attempts to constrain a river\u2019s \nfreedom to migrate, and to isolate it from its flood plain so as to exploit the land, create \nimbalances  which  nature  will  always  resist.  Flood  management  concerns  the  forced \nmaintenance of these imbalances to protect against irreparable damage to people and property. \n \n29.  Human history is partly a record of life adjacent to rivers and coasts and the consequent \noccasional  catastrophes  suffered.  However,  it  is  increasingly  believed  that  floods  can  be \nmanaged and that the risk to lives and assets can be reduced. \n \n30.  Floods tend to affect the poor most.2 Therefore it is incumbent on society at large, \nthrough its political, administrative and legal structures, to shoulder the main responsibility for \nflood management. Community participation is increasingly seen as an important ingredient in \nflood management because of the realization that informed and enabled asset-owning residents \nof flood risk areas can become active protagonists and advocates for flood control, rather than \npassive victims. \n \n31.  Neither the benefits nor the costs of flood control are easy to assess. For instance, if a \nvillage experiences so much flooding that that lives and property are being lost, then clearly the \nsocial and economic benefits of relocating that village to higher ground must be weighed against \nthe feasibility and cost of protecting the village to an acceptable level. The question arises as to \nwhat is an acceptable level; no deaths at all, one death per ten years, one house lost per year? \n \n32.  The proposed permanent flood management authority would be funded from recurrent \ncore funds and legally empowered to specify, supervise, and coordinate the disaster-related \nactivities  of  all  the  implementing  agencies,  notably  the  MLRWR,  the  Agency  for \nHydrometeorology, and the CES. \n \n33.  Ambiguities in the existing legislation regarding responsibility for the dissemination of \nflood  warnings  and  responsibility  for  the  design,  construction  and  maintenance  of  flood \nprotection structures need to be corrected. Financial reforms to secure annual funding for flood \nmanagement activities, particularly operation and maintenance of flood protection works, are \nalso needed. \n \n34.  Flood  risk  maps  can  be  generated  by  flood  inundation  models  based  on  new \ntopographic  surveys  of  flood  plains,  supplemented  by  social,  environmental  and  economic \nsurveys to enumerate the extent and value of the assets at risk. The maps would be key \nplanning  tools  with  which  to  delineate  flood  risk  zones.  Appropriate  flood  preparedness \nprogrammes can then be designed for each zone, including annual flood awareness campaigns \nand evacuation drills at district and community levels. \n \n35.  Flood forecasting needs to be based on reliable real-time monitoring of precipitation \namounts  and  river  levels.  Flood  forecasting  models  need  to  be  formulated  and  calibrated \nagainst reliable and accessible historical flood data. The possible effects of climate change \nneed  to  be  included  through  the  application  of  internationally  and  nationally  recognised \nscenarios.  This  will  require  rehabilitation  and  modernization  of  the  Agency  for \nHydrometeorology\u2019s  network  of  climate  stations  and  river  gauges.  The  hydrometeorology \ndatabase system requires rehabilitation and updating in order to facilitate the development of \nthe forecasting models and to furnish a water management archive. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2004. Floods and the Poor, Water for All. Manila (publication no. 11).   ", "  Appendix 2  29 \n36.  There is scope for significant socioeconomic and environmental benefits from improved \nflood management, not only in terms of improved security against floods but also because of the \nbenefits provided by supplementary flood defences such as communal woodlots planted close \nto the flood defences. There will also be employment opportunities during construction and \nmaintenance. \n \n37.  There  is  scope  to  reduce  the  flood  embankment  maintenance  burden  on  the \nGovernment by replacing outdated heavy machinery, contracting out maintenance, voluntary \ncommunity participation, and low or maintenance-free designs. The application of performance-\nbased O&M contract should be tested. \n \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \nMAJOR EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO WATER AND NATURAL DISASTER SECTOR \n         \nNo.  Project  Funding  Amount  Year \n  Source  ($ million) \n         \n1.

Introduction \n \n1.  This report is a summary of the initial environmental examination (IEE) for the proposed \nKhatlon Province Flood Risk Management Project. It has been prepared in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003).  \n \n2.  Khatlon province occupies the south-west corner of Tajikistan adjacent to the Uzbekistan \nborder  to  the  west  and  the  Afghanistan  border  to  the  south.  The  Pyanj  river  forms  the \ninternational boundary with Afghanistan to the south and the Babatag Mountains form the \ninternational boundary with Uzbekistan to the west. The project area (2,800 km2) covers the low-\nlying parts of the four districts of Hamadoni, Farkhor, Vose and Kulyab in the southeast of \nKhatlon province, which comprises the merged flood plains of the Kizilsu, Yakhsu, and Pyanj \nrivers.  \n \n3.  The Project will meet the immediate and urgent need for improvement in the flood \nprotection facilities by rebuilding old and damaged embankments in Hamadoni and planning the \nrehabilitation of the damaged facilities in Kulyab, Vose, and Farkhor. The project will also \nsignificantly  improve  the  ability  of  the  Government  and  local  communities  to  manage  the \nimpacts of future floods through greater flood awareness and preparedness, improvements to \nhydrometeorological monitoring, and strengthening of flood warning systems, particularly at the \ncommunity level. A proposed Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction project will create significant \nenvironmental  benefits  for  the  region  through  a  community  forest  program  which  will  re-\nestablish the tugai forest which was progressively removed over the last 50 years to make \nspace for irrigated agriculture and more recently for fuel wood.   \n \nB.  The Project \n \n  1.   Type and Category of Project \n \n4.  The  Project  will  entail  the  development  of  an  effective  and  sustainable  flood \nmanagement plan for four flood-prone districts in Khatlon province through a balance of physical \nand  non-physical  measures.  The  Project  was  classified  as  category  B  for  environmental \nassessment therefore an IEE was prepared.  \n \n  2.   Need for the Project \n \n5.  There have been several floods in the project area since the early 1990s, culminating in \nthe flood of June 2005 in Hamadoni, which caused a catastrophic breach of the embankment \nalong the Pyanj river, flooding 4000 ha of land and destroying houses, roads, bridges, canals \nand water towers. The flood waters broke through the embankments near the village of Panjob, \ncausing severe damage in and around the villages of Metintugai, Kalinin, and Faizabad before \ndischarging into the Kizilsu river. Although the 2005 flood was only the fourth largest flood on \nrecord, it caused by far the most damage. As a result, the Government decided that a flood \nmanagement plan was urgently required to assist affected communities to manage the risk from \nfuture floods. \n \n  3.   Project Description \n \n6.  The project consists of physical and non-physical components.  ", "    Appendix 9      39     \n \n(i)  The physical components will complete the missing link in the flood protection \nworks  between Sayod Hill and the main embankment that runs from the Chubek \nintake  to  a  point  some  12  km  downstream.  They  consist  of  repairing  and \nstrengthening  the  existing  embankments  and  planting  tugai  forest  by  the \ncommunity. The forest will act as a buffer zone between the embankments and \nthe irrigated land to the north and will also stabilize the unconsolidated sand and \ngravel and provide renewable fuel wood and animal fodder for communities.  \n \n(ii)  The non-physical components will include improvements to flood forecasting and \nwarning, emergency planning, and other social, economic and environmental \nbenefits.  \n       \n  4.   Proposed Implementation Schedule \n \n7.   The Project is scheduled for implementation from 2007 to 2013. \n \nC.  Environmental Baseline of the Study Area \n \n  1.  Geography \n \n8.  The Pyanj river emerges from a gorge in the Pamir mountains at the Chubek irrigation \nintake. At this point it divides and extends over a large alluvial fan to form an immense system \nof highly mobile braided rivers running between gravel spits, islands, and low vegetation. \n \n9.   The northern part of the alluvial fan in Tajikistan was reclaimed for irrigated crops by the \nformer Soviet Union. The flood embankments divided the fan and were constructed from sand, \nsilt, cobbles and boulders from the riverbed, protected by stone gabions and reinforced concrete \nblocks.  The  southern  and  much  larger  and  more  untamed  part  of  the  fan  extends  into  \nAfghanistan as far south as the town of Arabkakul. A large area of the Afghan part of the alluvial \nfan is consists of villages and cultivation on unprotected islands and spits. Seasonal flooding \noccurs throughout this area. \n \n10.  The Pyanj river is a major influence on Hamadoni and Farkhor districts as it is the main \nwater source for irrigation. The Pyanj can cause occasional flooding in Farkhor via the Sairob \nstream and through backing up the Kizilsu river near its confluence with the Pyanj.  \n \n11.  The Kizilsu flows along the western side of the project area, first through Vose and then \nthrough Farkhor. The Yakhsu and its parallel river, the Kulyab, flow through Kulyab district in the \nnortheast of the study area. \n \n  2.  Geology and Topography \n \n12.  The alluvial flood plains in the project area lie in a geological basin called the Tajik \nDepression which is formed of Jurassic and Paleozoic rocks. On the fringe of the plains are \nsmooth contoured low loess hills. Because there is so little productive land in mountainous \nTajikistan, the pressure on the available land for agricultural production and urban settlement is \nextremely high. However because of natural flash floods, steep hydraulic gradients, and high \nsediment loads, settlement and agriculture is always in conflict with natural river processes. \n \n \n ", "40  Appendix 9 \n  3.  Water Resources \n \n    a.  Surface water  \n \n13.  Surface water resources in the project area are relatively plentiful. The catchment area \nat Chubek is 114,000 km2. The Pyanj river is the primary source of drinking and irrigation water \nin the project area as it has reliable flows all year round. The Chubek intake delivers water by \ngravity and pumping via a complex canal system throughout most of the project area. However, \nthe river water has a high sediment load, particularly in the spring and summer, which leads to \nheavy sedimentation of the irrigation canal system.  \n \n14.  The Kizilsu and Yakhsu rivers are less reliable than the Pyanj river in terms of water \nsupply. The water quality in the Pyanj river is reported to be cleaner than the Kyzylsu, because \nit is much less affected by development. The Kyzylsu changes in quality depending on whether \nit is swollen by snowmelt (which improves it) or by rainfall or runoff (which makes it worse). \nWater quality is monitored by the Department of Analytical Control which has small offices in \nKulyab and Kurgan Tube where a water inspector is based. \n \n    b.  Groundwater \n \n15.  There are significant reserves of groundwater within the Pyanj alluvial fan and in the \nflood plains of the Kizilsu and Yakhsu rivers. The water table is naturally high and therefore the \ngroundwater resources are vulnerable to contamination.  \n \n  4.  Air Quality and Climate \n \n16.  Air quality is outstandingly good since there are no industrial pollutants and relatively low \nvehicular use. However there are seasonal dust storms, especially where vegetation has been \ncleared  to  expose  soil.  Dust  will  be  a  temporary  issue  in  summer  during  the  proposed \nconstruction works. \n \n17.  There is a single long winter wet season lasting from October to May. Average monthly \nprecipitation climbs steadily during the autumn and winter to a maximum of 130 mm in March. It \nthen falls rapidly in April and May and summer, from June to September, is normally dry, \nalthough there was heavy monsoonal rainfall and serious flooding in July 1999.  \n \n    a.  Climate Change \n \n18.  Monitoring of glaciers is being carried out by the Agency for Hydrometeorology. Rainfall \nand temperature data collected over the past 50-60 years indicate cycles but no significant \ntrends. Increased snowmelt is bound to worsen the problems of summer flooding but there are \nas yet insufficient data to enable forward planning for the lowland valleys.   \n  \n  5.  Ecological Resources \n \n19.  The study area comprises six main habitat types: \n(i)  the steep rocky mountain system of the Pamirs at the eastern end of the site; \n(ii)  the rounded loess hills at the western end of the site; \n(iii)  agricultural land, including cotton fields and orchards immediately north of the \nriver system; ", "    Appendix 9      41     \n(iv)  flood damaged land, consisting of gravel which is slowly spreading with small \nannuals and mosses;  \n(v)  the habitats of the Hamadoni alluvial fan, consisting of a network of rivers with \ngravel banks and open water and tugai vegetation on the drier parts of the fan; \nand \n(vi)  the river habitats of the Kizilsu and Pyanj valleys. \n \n20.  Of these ecosystems, the most important are the river and associated tugai vegetation. \nFor most of its length the Pyanj river flows either through steep gorges in the Pamirs along its \nupstream end or is heavily developed and over-abstracted along its downstream length in \nUzbekistan. It is only in its middle section between Chubek and Termez that the river is able to \ndevelop substantial adjacent wetland systems. Of these, the Hamadoni alluvial fan appears to \nbe among the most significant and it is possibly the largest wetland system along the central \nriver  section.  Some  80  km  downstream  is  the  Tigrovaya  Balka  Reserve  and  Ramsar  site \nalthough this lies largely on the tributary Vakhsh river.  \n \n    a.  Tugai Vegetation \n \n21.  Tugai vegetation, which supports a large range of specialized animals and birds, is an \nincreasingly endangered ecosystem because of clearance for farming and fuel wood. On the \nnorthern half of the alluvial fan, major tree clearance of the tugai ecosystem took place during \nWorld War II. Over the next 40 years, the Soviet administration restored the riverine forests \nwhich were then largely lost again during the Civil War of 1991\u20131992. The entire low lying area \naround the north of Sayod Hill and extending northwest from Turdiev Jamoat and part of the \nHamadoni alluvial fan was covered with tugai vegetation in the 1930s. Until 1950, deer, boar \nand pheasant were abundant and the Caspian tiger was believed to be present.  In 1950 a \ndeputation went to Moscow for money to reclaim it for agriculture. The result was the foundation \nof Moscovskie (Little Moscow) and the construction of surrounding villages and the Chubek \nirrigation scheme, leading to clearance of the tugai.   \n \n22.  Tugai carries out a moisture-keeping function in the embankment and provides a basic \nplace of dwelling for some unique animals. Tugai is very useful in holding banks together \nagainst river erosion and the fact that so much has been cleared on the northern Tajikistan side \nof the river system may partly explain why some of the dominant channels have moved north in \nrecent years, leaving much of the Afghan part of the delta higher as well as far more densely \nvegetated. \n \n    b.  Birds   \n \n23.  Within the agricultural areas, typical farm birds of Tajikistan can be found. These include \nhoopoe roller, bee-eater, doves, quail, corn crake, lapwing, red-backed shrike, golden oriole, \nlarks and most commonly large flocks of myna birds. The cliffs and mountains around Chubek \nsupport wall creeper, eagle owl, griffon vulture, redstarts, and rock thrushes. \n \n24.  Despite extensive hunting, including duck shooting, which takes place on both sides of \nthe border, the birdlife is clearly very rich on the Hamadoni alluvial fan. This includes year round \nresidents as well as winter migrants.  \n \n    c.  Fish and Fisheries \n \n25.  A relative of the sturgeon, Pseudoscaphirhynchus kaufmanii (which is on the  \n ", "42  Appendix 9 \nInternational Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species) can be \nfound throughout this section of the Pyanj river. In addition, numerous other fish, including \nvarious species of barbel and pike-asp, are resident or migrate through the river. There are two \nfish farms in the vicinity of the project area near the Chubek intake.  \n \n    d.   Animals \n \n26.  Before the intensive hunting which killed many animals on the Hamadoni alluvial fan, it \nwould have supported many species, including the Bukhara red deer, which is also on the Red \nList and still occurs in the Tigrovaya Balka Reserve. Other species in the area may include \njungle cat and jackal. Wild boar, fox, tolai hare, porcupine, Central Asian cobra, green toad, and \nthe world\u2019s largest goat, the markhor, are all present.  \n \n    e.  Protected Sites \n \n27.  There are no protected sites within or immediately adjacent to the study area. However, \nthere are two important protected sites upstream and downstream on the Project area: to the \nnorth east is the Dashti-Jum State Strict Nature Reserve and, adjacent to it, the Dashti-Jum \nHabitat and Species Management Area. These reserves were set up to protect the markhor and \npistachio, almond, and cherry forests containing a wide range of iris, anemone, wild onions, and \nfoxtail lilies. \n \n28.  Eighty kilometers downstream of the study area and astride the Vakhsh river is the \nTigrovaya Balka Strict Nature Reserve. This supports snow leopards and brown bears and \ncontains the best preserved tugai ecosystem in Tajikistan. However, this reserve suffers from \npoaching, fires, agricultural encroachment, and water pollution. At its southeast corner is the \nLower Pyanj river Ramsar site, a wetland area valuable for its birdlife and tugai vegetation. \n \n    f.   Land Use \n \n29.  In the flood plains, the main crops are cotton, cereals, oilseed, potatoes, carrots, onions, \ncucumbers, cabbage, melons, vines, milk, wool, honey and eggs. In addition, orchards or fruit \ntrees grown in yards play an important role in the economy.  \n \n30.  Adjacent to the main rivers, the stony riverside farmland is often more appropriate for \nvines, fruit trees, and vegetables, especially onions. Cattle also graze within the taller vegetation \nof the tugai. \n \n31.  The rolling loess hills support grazing flocks of sheep, goats, and cattle. In some areas \nthat are not too steep the hills are cultivated for wheat and vines. Steep slopes, especially in the \nmoister mountainous parts of Tajikistan, are cultivated for fruit trees and potatoes. However, \nespecially in the valley of the Yakhsu near Kulyab, the hillsides are too steep to be used for \nmuch beyond spring grazing for goats.   \n \n  6.  Cultural and Archaeological Resources \n \n32.  There are two sites relatively near to the project, the Sayod old town situated on Sayod \nHill, some 500 m from the western end of the project works and the Shahidjan graveyard south \nwest of Moscva a few kilometers away. In addition there are four historic sites on the sides of \nthe mountains to the east of the project area: the Dahaneh ruined village north of the Chubek \nintake together with the Abku graveyard, the Kharareh Khajeh tomb, and the Khajeh Moamin ", "    Appendix 9      43     \ngrave further north into the mountains. These sites are all over 10 km away from the proposed \nworks. \n \n  7.  Socioeconomic Conditions \n \n    a.   Population \n \n33.  Khatlon province contains most of the low-lying land in Tajikistan. Kulyab is the only \nlarge town in the project area. The population of the study area is 583,700 according to the \n2005  census,  only  20%  of  whom  were  in  employment,  mainly  in  the  agricultural  sector. \nApproximately 75% of the population is rural. The average monthly income in the agricultural \nsector is US$15 per month. \n \n    b.  Economy \n \n34.  Agriculture is the main economic activity in the region. Together with some housing, \nagricultural  land  was  the  main  casualty  in  the  2005  floods  in  Hamadoni.  The  irrigation \ninfrastructure, inherited at the end of the Soviet era, suffers from a lack of investment in routine \nmaintenance.  This  has  led  to  a  progressive  loss  of  cultivable  land  and  damage  to \nembankments, intakes, and canals. \u201dFutures\u201d contracts for cotton production effectively indebt \nthe farming community and limit their disposable income. Therefore rural household incomes in \nthe project area are generally below the Tajikistan average.  \n \n    c.  Urban Development \n \n35.  Villages and towns have long been developed in the valley bottoms. Some are historic \ncenters (such as Kulyab town) but many are relatively new towns created in the Soviet era \n(such as Hamadoni\u2014formerly known as Moscovskie). Housing expansion is continuing in an \nuncontrolled manner in flood-prone areas beside the rivers. In the low-lying land between the \nYakhsu and Kulyab rivers, north of Kulyab, there is a new factory making house construction \nmaterials.  Kulyab airport and much good agricultural land are located in the valley in spite of \nthe flood risk. \n \nd.  Gravel Extraction \n \n36.  Along all the river systems in the study area, gravel extraction for construction materials  \ntakes place and there are a number of concrete factories. One northeast of Kulyab has been \nbadly flooded. In many places the gravel workings lower the valley bottoms and so may draw \nthe flood waters toward them and even undermine flood banks.  \n \n    e.   Management of Upper Catchments \n \n37.  Mismanagement of upper catchments leading to erosion and heavy sedimentation in \ndownstream river valleys is common throughout the world. Grazing is the main land use within \nthe uplands surrounding the Kizilsu, Yakhsu and Pyanj valleys. There appears to be little or no \nforest cover surviving.  \n \n38.  Where  the  mountainsides  consist  of  Jurassic  and  Paleozoic  rock,  the  problems  of \nerosion are likely to be less acute. Where the hillsides consist of loess or granitic soils, erosion \nis more serious and there is evidence of land slips.  \n \n ", "44  Appendix 9 \n    f.  Existing Development \n \n39.  The Hamadoni flood embankment divides the active and inactive sections of the fan. \nThe inactive part is now heavily developed with settlements, infrastructure, and both irrigated \nand rain-fed agriculture in Hamadoni and Farkhor. The adjacent flood plain of the Kizilsu river \nmerges with the Hamadoni flood plain and has been developed in a similar way. More than half \na million people are located in low-lying areas adjacent to, or influenced by, the Pyanj river. The \nmajority of them depend directly on agriculture for subsistence and income. \n \n40.  In Afghanistan, 200,000 people or more inhabit low-lying areas on and adjacent to the \nalluvial fan and they are therefore at risk in varying degrees from flooding. \n \n  8.  Impact of Flooding \n \n41.  Although floods are relatively infrequent, there has been considerable direct and indirect \nflood impact from the Pyanj river in Hamadoni and Farkhor districts. This is mainly because of \nthe failure of the flood embankments that stretch from Chubek to Metintugai and to a lesser \nextent  the  flood  embankments  between  Sayod  Hill  and  Arabkakul  in  Farkhor  district.  Site \ninspections and discussions with officials indicate that minor failures have occurred from time to \ntime over many years, but the major breach near the village of Panjob in 2005 was by far the \nworst. The cumulative impact has been a permanent loss of agricultural land due to smothering \nwith gravel and temporary loss of infrastructure such as roads, canals and buildings. There has \nalso been indirect flood impact in outlying areas in Farkhor and Vose because the supply of \nirrigation water has been interrupted. \n \n42.  The Kizilsu, Yakhsu and Kulyab rivers run parallel to each other in the relatively narrow \nand well populated valley which constitutes the main settled land in Kulyab district. They flow \nthrough non-cohesive gravels at a steep gradient and are highly mobile. They create major \nflooding problems throughout the valley and as a result the whole valley needs to be treated \nholistically rather than piecemeal. \n \n43.  In Kulyab town, the Tebolai river creates environmental and flooding challenges that are \ndisproportionate to its small size as it flows through the town. Severe environmental issues \nalong  the  Tebolai  include  flooding  and  inundiation,  threats  to  public  health,  resettlement, \nschools and a prison. The flooding and pollution problems of the river and the potential for \nupstream flood control structures such as check dams need to be addressed. \n \n44.  The alluvial fan and the flood plain start from the narrow upstream mountain defile \nbetween Chubek in Tajikistan and Yateh Tepa in Afghanistan and end in the valley constriction \nat near Arabkakul in Afghanistan, some 25-30 km downstream. Nearly all the active fan and \nflood plain lies in Afghanistan. Although there appears to be no formal development in this area, \nit is populated by at least 200,000 people, most of whom practice subsistence agriculture using \nself-help irrigation schemes and stock grazing. The lack of any formal flood protection or flood \nmanagement schemes in this area means that there is a significant and severe risk of flood \ndamage.  The  2005  flood  caused  considerable  damage  to  communities  in  Afghanistan. \nAnecdotal reports suggest that at least 16,500 ha of irrigated land and 25,000 farm animals \nwere lost. \n \n \n ", "    Appendix 9      45     \nD.  Screening  of  Potential  Environmental  Impacts  of  the  Project  and  Mitigation \nMeasures \n \n45.  The potential impacts from the project have been assessed. Those activities that have \nno  potential  to  cause  a  significant  environmental  impact  have  been  screened  out, \nallowing the impact assessment and the development of mitigation measures to focus on \nthe significant issues. The non-physical components of the Project will not have any \nenvironmental impacts and so are not assessed here. The key issues identified during \nthe screening process were:  \n \n(i)  the potential for indirect, trans-border impacts affecting Afghanistan, \n(ii)  impacts on ecological resources, \n(iii)  impacts on cultural resources, \n(iv)  impacts on water resources and fisheries, and  \n(v)  impacts from construction activities. \n \n  1.  Indirect and Trans-boundary Impacts Affecting Afghanistan \n \n46.  The project will involve works at three locations: \n \n(i)  approximately 700 m of river bank protection at, and immediately upstream of, \nthe Sayod Hill border post; \n(ii)  approximately 3.5 km of river bank protection near Metintugai village; and  \n(iii)  reconstruction and extension of an existing old flood embankment of 4.8 km as a \nguide to discourage the river flow from approaching the Dekhanabad canal and \nthe Metintugai village area.  \n \n47.  The original flood embankments were constructed along the northern edge of the Pyanj \nriver alluvial fan some 50 years ago to protect the irrigated land as it was developed to the \nnorth. This significantly reduced the active area of the alluvial fan and is likely to have led to \nchanges in the hydraulics and topography of the upper fan near Chubek by restricting the lateral \nmovement of river channels and gravel bars. It is also likely that there were changes to the \nconfiguration of sand and silt islands further downstream. However, after more than 50 years, \nthe alluvial fan will have completely adjusted to the presence of the embankments. Therefore \nthe proposed rehabilitation will not alter the conditions that have been present for more than 50 \nyears. \n \n48.  The proposed works will have some local impacts on flow patterns and scouring as they \nare situated adjacent to the river, but these effects are unlikely to extend more than a few \nmeters into the nearest river channel. As the system of braided channels extends some 5-10 km \nacross from Hamadoni toward Afghanistan, the wider effects will be insignificant. Therefore no \ntrans-boundary  impacts  are  anticipated  in  relation  to  the  rehabilitation  of  the  flood \nembankments. \n \n  2.  Impact on Ecological Resources \n \n49.  Vegetation has little chance to become established at the northern end of the alluvial fan \nas flood flows scour away any plant that has managed to establish itself. At the southern end of \nthe  fan,  the  velocity  of  flows  decreases  to  a  point  where  tugai  vegetation  can  become \nestablished and survive the flood flows. Before the land was cleared for agriculture, tugai \nvegetation was present along the river banks and on the northern part of the fan.  \n ", "46  Appendix 9 \n50.  The ecological value of the project area is high and the alluvial fan can be considered to \nbe a wetland of international importance. The proposed project works have a small footprint and \nthey are located along 2.7 km of the northern edge of the present tugai and braided river \nsystem, which covers an area of approximately 100 km2. Therefore the impacts of the proposed \nproject on the ecological resources will be local and will not have any significant impact on the \ntugai vegetated islands to the south of the embankments. \n \n51.  There will also be no adverse impact on protected nature conservation sites, since these \nare too far away. The nearest reserves at Dashti-Jum are 20 km upstream and only reachable \nby boat through an otherwise impassable gorge. The Tigrovaya Balka Reserve and the adjacent \nRamsar site are 80 km downstream.  \n \n52.  The river bank protection near Sayod Hill will replace the existing vertical eroding cliff \nwith a shallower slope of dumped stone. This means that potential nesting habitat for kingfishers \nor sand martins will be lost but there is no current evidence that they are nesting in this bank \nand there are plenty of other potential nesting sites in eroding cliffs in this immense deltaic \nsystem. In addition, the rocks may create habitats for reptiles and even otters, which occur in \nthe area. \n \n    a.   Ecological Enhancement of the Project Area \n53.  Tugai is the most important and threatened habitat within the study area as well as being \na major tool in the management and control of the river system. A community forest will be \nplanted along a strip of unconsolidated sands and gravel behind the embankments and will \ncover an area 22 km long and 1 km wide. The aim is to recreate tugai vegetation that would \nhave existed in this area before it was cleared for agriculture. The willows, poplars and reeds \nand grasses that characterize tugai vegetation have evolved over many millennia to survive \ninundation by flooding. The community alluvial forest will enhance the project at a number of \nlevels. First, the growth of the vegetation will help to bind up the unconsolidated sands and \ngravels. Once it is mature it will help to dissipate the power of any future floods that breach or \novertop the embankments. Second, it will provide a sustainable source of fuel wood for the local \ncommunity. Third, it will be an important ecological resource as it will re-establish the natural \nvegetation community of the area. This component will be funded by a Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction  (JFPR) grant. \n \n  3.  Impacts on Cultural Resources \n \n54.  There is unlikely to be a significant impact on cultural resources, as the nearest are over \n500 m from the western edge of the project area. In the case of bank reinforcement near Sayod \nHill a watching brief will be needed because of the proximity of the Samaneid settlement known \nas Sayed old town. \n \n  4.  Impact on Water Resources and Fisheries including Climate Change \n \n55.  The rehabilitation of the flood embankments will have no effect on the quantity or quality \nof available water resources in the project area. It is possible that the river water immediately \nadjacent to the works may be become temporarily polluted but this risk will be addressed in the \nenvironment management plan (EMP). \n \n56.  Research suggests that there is a likelihood of increased precipitation in the catchment \nof the Pyanj river as a result of climate change. However, current computer models are not able ", "    Appendix 9      47     \nto predict changes at a regional or subregional level. Increased snowmelt is bound to worsen \nthe problems of summer flooding but there are as yet insufficient data to reflect this in forward \nplanning for the lowland valleys. Sufficient freeboard has been included in the design of the \ndykes to cope with the flows likely to be encountered in a 1 in 100-year flood. \n \n  5.  Construction Impacts \n \n57.  The  construction  of  the  embankments  and  the  bank  strengthening  works  have  the \npotential to cause a number of minor temporary environmental impacts. These may arise from \nthe  location  and  management  of  work  camps  and  haul  roads;  dust,  noise  and  vibration; \nprocurement of construction materials such as rocks and river cobbles; liquid discharges; waste \ncollection and storage; and illegal hunting. \n \n58.  The implementation of an effective environmental management plan (EMP) will manage \nand mitigate these impacts. An outline EMP is included in the IEE. The EMP will be further \ndeveloped  during  the  detailed  design  phase  and  implemented  before  the  start  of  the \nconstruction works. It will contain procedures and plans to ensure that mitigation measures and \nmonitoring requirements are implemented during the construction period. \n \n59.  All civil works will be designed and operated in accordance with environmentally sound \nengineering practices and governed by ADB and Tajikistan\u2019s environmental standards. Works \nwill require the use of heavy machinery (e.g., excavators and bulldozers) but will be small in \nscale and will not take place on lands already used for agriculture. \n \n    a.   Water Quality and Sediment Control \n \n60.  Heavy plant such as cranes, bulldozers, backhoes, and trucks will be required for the \nconstruction and repair of the embankments. Large quantities of cobbles and gravel will be \nmoved during this process. There is potential for large amounts of sediment to be released into \nthe  river  during  this  period  if  the  construction  activities  are  undertaken  in  an  uncontrolled \nmanner. In order to prevent excessive amounts of additional sediment being discharged into the \nriver, environmental management measures will be introduced. These will include control of \nvehicle movements, limiting the construction footprint, and scheduling the construction work \nduring the dry season.     \n \n61.  A small construction camp is likely to be needed by the contractor. Activities at the camp \nneed to be conducted in a manner that ensures no pollution of nearby water bodies. Operations \nat the camp will be undertaken in accordance with accepted international best practice for \nconstruction camps and will include waste management, hazardous materials storage, correct \nstockpiling of construction materials and fuel, and prevention of pollution.  \n \n62.  Monitoring will be undertaken to ensure effective implementation of the measures listed \nabove. An environment officer will be required to monitor levels in the river and ensure that any \nsediment generated by the project is not significantly in excess of background levels. In the \nevent of an excess, appropriate management measures will need to be implemented. \n \n    b.   Air Quality, Noise, and Vibration \n \n63.  Road  haulage  will  feature  prominently  in  the  construction  phase.  The  social  and \nenvironmental impacts of this increase in road traffic are potentially significant, with excessive \ndust generation, noise and vibration being the major concerns. \n ", "48  Appendix 9 \n64.  The existing road network offers two possible routes from the quarry to the work site in \nHamadoni, a public road which passes through villages and a military road which does not pass \nclose to settlements. \n \n65.  The  military  road  would  be  preferable  for  project  use,  subject  to  approval  of  the \nauthorities. This road would require some rehabilitation before the hauling of rock from the \nquarry begins. However, it is possible that this road will not be available. If the public road has to \nbe used, a number of mitigation measures will need to be introduced to manage dust, including \nwatering of roads and enforcement of speed limits for project vehicles. \n \n66.  The effectiveness of these measures will need to be closely monitored and regular \ncontact with affected households and communities will need to be undertaken.  \n \n    c.  Hazardous Materials and Waste Management \n \n67.  During the construction period a wide range and substantial volumes of waste may be \ngenerated including gravel; concrete; miscellaneous structures such as culverts, poles and \ncables; steel; organic material, such as cleared vegetation, timber; and soil. In addition there will \nbe oils, fuel, grease and chemicals from plant, equipment and vehicle servicing.  Hazardous \nmaterials will need to be stored and handled correctly to prevent spills and pollution.  \n \n68.  An emergency spills contingency plan will be prepared as part of the contractor\u2019s EMP. \nThe environment officer will monitor the effectiveness of the management measures during site \ninspections. \n \n  6.  Environmental Management Plan \n \n69.  The EMP outlines the relevant environmental regulations, institutional responsibilities, \nmitigation measures and monitoring needed to comply with the environmental assessment \nrequirements of the Government of Tajikistan and ADB. The EMP will be updated based on the \ndetailed design and will be revised by the contractor once the contract has been awarded. The \nproject  management  office  at  the  implementing  agency  is  responsible  for  implementing \nmitigation measures and monitoring during construction and operation. A budget has been \nallocated for environmental management and monitoring.  \n \n70.  Monitoring  of  the  potential  impacts  from  construction  of  the  embankments  will  be \nundertaken by the PMO in conjunction with the MLRWR.  \n \nE.  Legal and Institutional Requirements \n \n1.  Legal Framework \n71.  Since  independence,  Tajikistan  has  developed  a  framework  of  environmental  laws, \nregulations,  and  policies.  These  mandate  that  environmental  impact  should  be  assessed; \nconsequences identified; ecological and economic studies carried out; and measures to mitigate \npossible  negative  impacts  identified  before  the  implementation  of  a  project.  Environmental \nlegislation includes laws on air quality, mineral resources, land management, forests, animals \nand  factories,  health  and  safety  and  waste  and  chemicals  management.  A  Framework \nEnvironment Law was adopted in 1993 and amended in 1996. The Water Code was adopted in \n2000, the Land Code in 1992, and the Land Administration Code in 2001. \n ", "    Appendix 9      49     \n  2.  Project Approvals  \n \n72.  The Tajikistan Environment Law (1996) requires that the IEE for this project be reviewed \nby the State Committee of Ecologic Expertise. The committee reviewed and endorsed a draft of \nthe IEE in May 2007, so the project now has government approval. \n \n  3.  Institutional Framework \n \n73.  The Ministry of Land Reclamation and Water Resources (MLRWR) is the Executing \nAgency (EA) of the Project. The project management office (PMO) will be set up in the MLRWR \nwith project implementation offices in the Committee for Emergency Situations (CES) and in the \nAgency for Hydrometeorology, under MAEP, for the flood forecasting and flood risk mapping \ncomponents, and a site office under MLRWR in Hamadoni. \n \n74.  The State Control Service for Nature Use and Protection (SCSNUP) which is under the \nMAEP (formerly the State Committee for Environmental Protection and Forestry) is the final \nauthority for environmental approval.  \n \n75.  To ensure contractors comply with environmental regulations and standards, SCSNUP \nand MLRWR will undertake regular inspections. Regular monitoring of water quality during \nrehabilitation works will be conducted by the regional analytical laboratory (SCSNUP). The \ninspections will cover all relevant issues, including the use of appropriate materials and possible \nclaims made by the affected people. The construction surveillance engineer will be responsible \nfor setting up meetings between the parties and arranging work schedules (e.g., hours of \nequipment operation and traffic lanes).  \n \n  4.  Roles and Responsibilities \n \n    a.  Project Management Office (PMO) \n \n76.  The PMO will be headed by a full-time project director. Staff will have expertise in project \nmanagement,  hydrology  and  embankment  engineering,  finance,  and  socioeconomic  and \ncommunity development.  The PMO will also incorporate all consulting services under the \nProject, including assistance to the EA and the concerned district office  \n \n77.  Mitigation measures incorporated into the design will be verified by the PMO before \ntechnical approval is given. The mitigation measures that form part of the contract documents \nwill also be verified by the PMO before the contract is signed by the PIO and the Contractor. \n \n   b.   Project Implementation Office (PIO) \n \n78.  The PIOs  will be headed by engineers and each will have four sections (i) project \naccounts, (ii) construction, (iii) environment and social development, and (iv) operations and \nmanagement.  Assisted  by  project  consultants,  PIOs  will  be  responsible  for  construction \nsupervision, local procurement, and engineering and environmental control. \n \n   c.  Contractors \n \n79.  The contractors will provide the PMO with monthly reports on the implementation of \nmitigation measures. Their reports will be consolidated with the quarterly monitoring reports \nprepared by the project consultants and submitted to PMO for review. \n ", "50  Appendix 9 \nF.  Consultations  \n \n1.  Communities \n \n80.  Stakeholder  consultations  were  conducted  at  the  district  and  community  offices  in \nHamadoni. At these meetings the purpose and components of the project were presented along \nwith the benefits and potential impacts. The agendas of the meetings covered the following: \n \n(i)  environmental aspects of the flood management project; \n(ii)  results and proposals of the feasibility study; \n(iii)  community feedback on proposed structural and nonstructural measures; \n(iv)  community willingness to contribute to the flood management project; and  \n(v)  establishment of community focus groups, enabling community representatives \nto  have  a  regular  dialogue  with  the  project  staff  as  a  part  of  a  long-term \ncommunity engagement strategy. \n \n81.  In  addition,  several  villages  were  visited  and  residents  were  informed  about  the \nproposed interventions and asked about their perceptions of the Project. The results of the \nconsultations were positive. All the participants considered that the Project would result in \nbeneficial agricultural, environmental and public health impacts and that there would be no \nadverse  effects  during  the  construction  phase,  as  the  project  site will  be  away  from  their \nsettlements, near the border area between Tajikistan and Afghanistan.  They were informed that \nno land acquisition and resettlement of households would be required.  \n \n82.  A brief summary of the participant\u2019s views with regard to the project follows.  \n \n(i)  The  participants  unanimously  concluded  that  the  Project  would  strengthen \nsustainable  flood  protection  and  management,  and  flood  and  emergency \npreparedness. This would promote development and reduce the risk of damage \nto houses and orchards, and prevent the degradation of banks.    \n(ii)  The  participants  expected  that  the  Project  would  promote  sustainable  and \neffective  use  of  environmentally  sustainable  management  practices.  They \nbelieved that rehabilitation and improvement of embankments would improve \nefficient water use and reduce flood damage and further erosion. \n(iii)  As  a  result,  the  project  was  considered  technically  feasible,  environmentally \nsound, and socially acceptable and the residents said they would provide full \ncooperation for its successful implementation.  \n(iv)  Participants said that such meetings were very useful as they were not aware of \nenvironmental assessment needs or of the rights and responsibilities of residents \nand their role in the project realization. They recommended that more attention \nbe given to (a) sensitizing residents to the environmental impacts and their duties \nand  responsibilities,  (b)  reviewing  general  and  technical  principles  of \nenvironmental procedures and the role of government and private agencies; and \n(c) educating residents about legislation, norms and procedures and suggesting \nmodifications for improvements.  \n \n83.  To assess any trans-boundary issues and possible impacts of the proposed project \nworks in Afghanistan, data and information were collected during a series of site visits in \nAfghanistan.  The  field  teams  comprised  consultants  from  the  Khatlon  Province  Flood \nManagement Project team in Dushanbe, an ADB consultant from Afghanistan, and staff from \nthe  Afghanistan  Ministry  of  Water  and  Electricity  (MEW)  and  the  Afghanistan  Natural ", "    Appendix 9      51     \nEnvironment Protection Agency (NEPA).1 They found considerable flood damage in Afghanistan \nbut  there  was  no  significant  evidence  that  this  was  caused  by  the  presence  of  the  flood \nembankments at Hamadoni or that the proposed rehabilitation would make the situation worse.  \n \n  2.  Expert Consultations \n \n84.  Extensive consultation with key individuals has taken place, including with experts of the \nRegional Environmental Centre for Central Asia, Kuhiston Foundation, the national focal point of \nthe environmental impact assessment EIA Convention in Tajikistan, the head of the SCSNUP \nunder the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment Protection, the secretaries of pilot jamoats, \nDepartment of Labor for Hamadoni district,  elders and villagers within the study area, experts \nfrom the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project,2 the PMO for the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project, \nOxfam GB Kulyab, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the CES, Department of \nEnvironment and Protection, Deputy Chairman of Hamadoni district, and the Head of State \nEcological Expertise (SCSNUP under MAEP). \n \n85.  Key  individuals  consulted  in  Afghanistan  included  representatives  and  experts  from \nKunduz province, Takhar district, Department of Water Management (Kunduz), Department of \nAgriculture  (Kunduz),  Project  Coordination  Unit  and  Emergency  Irrigation  Rehabilitation \nProgram (PCU/EIRP), Aga Khan Development Network Foundation (AKDN), Baghlan, and the  \nKunduz River Basin Programme (KRBP). \n \nG.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n86.  The study area lies adjacent to the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan. It is \ntherefore a zone of great political sensitivity. Consultations on both sides of the border at \nprovincial and district levels revealed common interests in flood management and a willingness \nto cooperate. This positive sentiment needs to be officially encouraged and backed up with \nformal bilateral agreements at Government level. \n \n87.  There is currently a high risk of flooding from the Pyanj river in both Tajikistan and \nAfghanistan. Climate change is likely to increase this risk. In the case of Tajikistan, the risk can \nbe substantially reduced by the immediate rehabilitation of the damaged and understrength \nflood embankments and spurs at Hamadoni. Flood damage could be further mitigated if the \nTajikistan  authorities  were  to  extend  their  flood  forecasting  and  warning  systems  to  the \nAfghanistan authorities. \n \n88.  From the limited information available, there is no conclusive technical evidence that the \nHamadoni flood embankments and spurs have significantly increased flood risks in Afghanistan. \nIt is true that the Hamadoni flood defenses have reduced the dynamic area of the alluvial fan \nand the bed level of the upper gravel fan may have risen as a result. However flood flows in the \nPyanj do not, and probably never did, inundate the entire width of the fan at once. Rather, the \nflows follow unstable channels according to local temporary hydraulic conditions. From time to \ntime the courses of these channels change erratically. According to satellite imagery, the current \nchannel system is oriented toward the right bank in Tajikistan and therefore poses a smaller \nthreat to Afghanistan than may have been the case in the past. \n                                                 \n1  The summary IEE was translated into the Dari language and delivered to concerned Afghanistan government \noffices in July 2007. The mission met with Afghanistan officials and explained the scope of the Project in July 2007.  \n2  ADB. 2004. Irrigation Rehabilitation Project. Manila, for $22.72 million equivalent, approved on 10 December. \n \n ", "52  Appendix 9 \n \n89.  The Hamadoni alluvial fan is an important wetland feature that exhibits a range of \nhabitats, flora, and fauna. Generally, these ecosystems are now rare elsewhere in Central Asia. \nThe Afghanistan side of the fan is less disturbed than the Tajikistan side. The less populated \nparts merit a formal environmental designation at international level in order to limit further \ndevelopment and to conserve important ecosystems. \n \n90.  So long as an effective environment management plan is enforced during civil works, no \npermanent negative environmental impacts are anticipated. Because these works will be local \nand orientated mainly in the direction of the stream, their impact on the environment will be \nminimal. Careful design of the works may ultimately enhance the environment by stabilizing \nriver banks and encouraging the re-establishment of natural and sustainable habitats. There \nmay  be  limited  temporary  impacts  resulting  from  construction  activities,  but  these  can  be \nmanaged and minimized by the imposition of a robust environmental management plan. \n \n91.  The main environmental issue associated with the Project is its potential impact on \nwatercourses and tugai vegetation on the alluvial fan. However, the design strategy minimizes \nthe impact on habitat and agriculture by restricting operations to areas of gravel with minimum \nvegetation. \n \n92.  There will be no negative impact on nature reserves as they are too far away. Impacts \nresulting from construction, especially where a new bank protection is being constructed in the \nimmediate vicinity of Metintugai, will have only very local impacts, which will be minimized by a \nrobust EMP.  \n \n93.  Assuming that the JFPR proposal for re-establishing tugai is accepted and successfully \nimplemented and that the project provides the anticipated flood protection benefits, the overall \nenvironmental  impact  of  the  flood  protection  works  in  Hamadoni  district  will  be  \u201dhighly \nbeneficial\u201d. \n \n94.  There is clearly a need for coordinated planning especially for the Yakhsu and upper \nKizilsu valleys, which can be facilitated by existing legislation. An agreed zoning plan for the \nvalleys based on flood risk maps showing areas zoned for agriculture, housing, and gravel \nextraction tied to an accurate mapping base is needed.  \n \nH.  Conclusions \n \n95.  The project will have significant environmental and social benefits and, if the prescribed \nmitigation and management measures are fully implemented, the project is unlikely to have \nmajor adverse environmental impacts. An environmental management plan has been prepared \nand responsibilities for implementation assigned. A budget has been allocated for environmental \nmanagement and monitoring. A full environmental impact assessment (EIA) is not required \nunder ADB guidelines. \n \n96.  The rehabilitation and reinforcement works will take place on and near the right bank of \nthe Pyanj river in Hamadoni. These works will involve earth works using on-site alluvial deposits \nfollowed by placement of concrete blocks (manufactured off-site), dumped rock (obtained from a \nquarry 55 km away) and stone filled gabion cages (assembled on site). \n ", "    Appendix 9      53     \n97.  The non-structural components of the Project will have no environmental impacts except \nin the case of the rehabilitation of river gauging stations and climate stations where very minor \nconstruction work will be necessary. \n \n ", "54  Appendix 10 \nRESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  The Khatlon Province Flood Risk Management Project will reduce the risk of socio-\neconomic losses caused by floods in the Farkhor, Hamadoni, Kulyab and Vose districts of \nKhatlon  province  through  a  holistic  and  coordinated  approach  of  the  physical  protection \nmeasures and non-physical measures, such as flood preparedness, forecasting and warning, \nand community participation. The institutional and legal framework will be strengthened during \nproject implementation, taking full account of social, environmental, and economic factors. To \nachieve this, the Project has four main components: (i) policy reform; (ii) physical measures;  \n(iii) non-physical measures; and (iv) capacity building for efficient project management. \n \n2.  All  land  in  Tajikistan  is  state-owned  and  the  Land  Code  states  that  land  must  be \neffectively used for the benefit of the people (article 2 of the Land Code). Land use is directed \nby the State through the local district administrations, specifically the local offices of the State \nCommittee for Land Management and district administrative offices (hukumat). Inheritance land-\nuse rights are provided for in the Constitution (article 13) and the Land Code (article 12), but the \nprocess is still at a very early stage of implementation and does not provide women with rights \nand opportunities for inheritance or for reimbursement of their land share when they get married \nor divorced. The Land Code addresses potential compensation for people who legally occupy \ngovernment land and are forced to relocate (article 15) but does not address compensation for \npeople  illegally  occupying  government  land  and  forced  to  relocate,  nor  does  it  address \ncompensation for people who have entered into \u201cinformal\u201d renting or leasing arrangements with \nlegally recognized land certificates. \n \n3.  Almost all lands in Hamadoni district in Khatlon province along the Pyanj river were \ntotally damaged or washed away by the severe flood in June 2005. Major structures such as \nmain irrigation canals and roads have been rehabilitated but destroyed farm land remains \ngravel-filled. Nobody is cultivating these lands and the local government does not allow them to \nbe cultivated. No land acquisition will be required for the 4.8 km of the main embankment, since \nthe land is owned by the Government and nobody is occupying or using it. The situation is the \nsame for the reinforcement of the 3.5 km of adjacent irrigation canal embankment.  However, in \ncase land acquisition is unexpectedly required, this resettlement framework will be applied.  \n \nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n4.  In principle, there will be no land acquisition required for the structures to be rehabilitated \nunder the Project. This resettlement framework will be applied only if sudden land acquisition \nbecomes necessary under the Project.  \n \nC.  Objectives, Policy Framework, and Entitlements \n \n5.  The Tajikistan Land Code (article 48) states that if land is taken from a physical and \njuridical or legal person for state and public needs, those persons will be apportioned land of the \nsame  value  and  compensation  for  losses  incurred,  including  income.  The  Chief  of  the \nDepartment of International Relations at Tajikistan\u2019s State Land Committee has stated that the \ndistrict  level  hukumat  (district  administration)  can  compensate  people  who  are  forced  to \nrelocate, even if it is only from cultivated land, not houses. \n ", "    Appendix 10     55 \n6.  The  principles  that  will  apply  in  resettlement  planning  are:  (i)  land  acquisition  and \ninvoluntary  resettlement  will  be  avoided,  (ii)  all  land  and  assets  will  be  compensated  at \nreplacement cost, (iii) affected people, with or without title or land use certificates, are entitled to  \ncompensation  and  assistance,  (iv)  households  headed  by  women  and  affected  by  land \nacquisition will have rights and opportunities for replacement of affected land and assets, (v) no \naffected people will be displaced or dispossessed without having received compensation or \nreplacement  lands  or  assets.  In  case  of  discrepancies  between  the  Borrower\u2019s  laws, \nregulations, and procedures and ADB\u2019s policy requirements, ADB\u2019s policy requirements will \nprevail.  \n \n7.  The ADB Policy on Involuntary Resettlement addresses \u201closses of land, resources, and \nmeans of livelihood or social support systems, which people suffer as a result of ADB projects.\u201d  \nAll efforts will be made to avoid any involuntary resettlement in the project area. The current \ndesign of civil works does not anticipate any land acquisition and/or resettlement. Nevertheless, \nthe resettlement framework ensures that people whose lives and incomes may be affected will \nbe assisted to ensure that they have at least the same (but ideally, better) level of material well-\nbeing after the Project as they did before it. \n \nD.  Consultation and Grievance Redress Participation \n \n8.  Because affected people have not been identified, no consultations have been held. \nHowever, the technical assistance team held discussions with people who suffered from severe \nflood  in  Kishlak  under  the  Kalinim  Jamoat.  Discussions  were  also  held  with  local  district \nauthorities in the project areas and at the national level with the State Committee for Land \nManagement and the Ministry of Land Reclamation and Water Resources. The resettlement \nplan will be prepared in consultation with affected peoples and the plan will be disclosed to them \nin a form and language that they can understand.  \n \n9.  All parties to the discussions have agreed in principle to ensure the welfare of any \npotentially-affected  households.  Local  district  authorities  will  address  the  appeals  of  any \npersons affected by the Project. It has been agreed that affected persons may appoint a \nmediator or facilitator, who will be paid by local district authorities, to mediate or facilitate on \ntheir behalf. Moreover, the project management office (PMO) will have the services of a gender \nand  social  development  specialist,  who  will  ensure  that  any  people  who  are  affected  are \ncompensated according to the principles of this resettlement framework. \n \nE.  Compensation, Relocation, and Income Restoration \n \n10.  There  are  three  key  elements  related  to  compensation,  relocation,  and  income \nrestoration. First, local district authorities have agreed to provide land of equal or better quality, \nin compensation for potential loss of livelihood. Second, local district authorities have agreed \nthat, during the construction of infrastructure projects, affected people will be accorded priority in \nemployment where possible. However, the local district authorities are not in a position to offer \nfuture employment to affected people and argue that income restoration will need to be linked to \nthe provision of land of equal or better quality.  \n \nF.  Institutional Framework \n \n11.  Planning,  implementation,  inspection,  and  assessment  for  district  infrastructure \ndevelopment projects will be the joint responsibility of the local district authorities and the PMO \nin  consultation  with  jamoat  and  community-based  groups.  The  PMO  would  also  provide \n ", "56  Appendix 10 \noversight of the implementation of the resettlement framework. Dissemination of information and \nany necessary public discussions with affected people would also be undertaken periodically to \nensure proper implementation of the resettlement framework. Before project implementation, \ninformation about this resettlement framework will be disseminated by the PMO. Resettlement \nplans will be prepared according to the resettlement framework and have to be submitted to \nADB for approval prior to award of civil works contracts.  \n \nG.  Resettlement Budget and Financing \n \n12.  For households that lose access to land because of the Project, local district authorities \nand the PMO need to ensure that replacement land will be provided and that households will \nreceive land use rights on this land. Because local district authorities are responsible for issuing \nland use rights certificates, they will also need to be involved. There will be minor costs involved \nin monitoring and providing support for resettlement, and these costs, as well as any unforeseen \ncosts, will be covered by the Project. \n \nH.  Implementation Schedule \n \n13.  Any  detailed  resettlement  planning  will  take  place  before  the  award  of  civil  works \ncontracts and the implementation of resettlement would take place well before the start of civil \nworks construction.  \n \nI.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n14.  If  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  is  required,  the  PMO  will  implement  a  detailed \nmonitoring and evaluation plan for the entire Project, including preparation, implementation, and \nflow-on effects. In relation to resettlement, the PMO will develop baseline data for monitoring \nindicators including: amount of land lost; amount of replacement land (of similar or better \nquality); number of jobs provided (temporary and replacement); compensation payments; and \nother assistance in moving, training, and household income (or agricultural income or output \nvalue) tracking. In support of these activities, affected persons will be invited to attend public \nmeetings  to  discuss  resettlement  issues.  The  Ministry  of  Land  Reclamation  and  Water \nResources  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB  on  the  implementation  of  the \nresettlement plan and a resettlement completion report. \n \nJ.  Conclusion \n \n15.  At the feasibility study level, there is no land acquisition required. However, at the actual \nimplementation  stage,  there  is  a  possibility  that  unexpected  land  acquisition  may  arise. \nTherefore, this resettlement framework has been designed to provide safeguards. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "    Appendix 11     57     \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.    Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Tajikistan: \n \nThe Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), published in 2002, is the Government\u2019s coordinated framework for \naddressing poverty in Tajikistan.1 Flood management in the project areas will significantly reduce the risks of loss \nassociated with frequent flooding of the project districts.  This provides protection for poor rural households who have \nno cushion to absorb risk. Work on disaster preparedness will help to ensure that floods have a lower impact when \nthey do occur. \n \nThe project area incorporates the districts of Hamadoni, Vose, Kulyab, and Farhor in the fertile flood plains adjacent to \nthe Pyanj, Kizilsu and Yakhsu rivers in Khatlon province. The zone has traditionally produced cotton, and today rural \nhouseholds (75.2% of the total population of 583,700) depend on cotton, livestock, and household plots for both \nsubsistence and livelihoods. According to preliminary poverty mapping data, the level of poverty in the project districts \nis about 79%, over 14% above the national average. Most of poor and very poor households live and work in rural \nareas. The rural poor are mainly agricultural workers, families with many children, and the elderly. Households headed \nby women are a particular challenge, as over 40% of men have left the area to find work in the Russian Federation.  In \n2005, the average nominal monthly salary in the project districts was 52 somoni (about $15), which is lower than the \naverage national level by 37%. In the project districts, a five to six month delay in payment of salaries is common, \nespecially in the agriculture sector. On many farms workers receive seasonal in-kind payment (wheat, and cotton \nsticks for heating and cooking) instead of salaries.  \n \nAccording to the population census in 2000 and an impact assessment on indigenous peoples, 70% of the project \narea population is ethnic Tajik, 25% is Uzbek, and 5% is from other ethnic groups (most are married to ethnic Tajiks.)  \nGenerally non-Tajik populations in southern Tajikistan speak Tajik as well as their native languages.  Ethnic minorities \nenjoy the same rights as the Tajik majority and regularly intermarry with Tajiks. They are fully integrated into \ninstitutional, cultural, and economic processes in the country.  Consequently they do not face discrimination, nor are \nthey sufficiently separate to justify classification as indigenous peoples.  No specific actions for ethnic minorities are \nenvisioned for this project. \n \nIn recent years the project districts have become increasingly vulnerable to floods because of insufficient embankment \nmaintenance. Lives have been lost and flood embankments, houses, canals, land, roads and bridges have been \ndestroyed. When there are floods, poor households are deeply affected, losing homes, assets, livestock, essential \npapers, and even lives.  In addition, agricultural crops are spoiled, and often agricultural land loses productivity and \ncan even be lost to production. Health and social services are negatively affected.  Recovery is slow, and dependence \non relatives for support erodes the narrow cushions of other families. A major flood took place in 2005 in Hamadoni \ndistrict caused by flooding of the Pyanj river. Estimates of losses are on the order of $17.8 million. \n \nThe PRSP incorporates attention to flood management as part of infrastructure and environment, and agriculture. It \nrecognizes that adequate infrastructure is critical to reducing poverty. The PRSP provides for both a national strategy \nfor disaster management and appropriate specialized and appropriately equipped services to study, forecast, and \nprovide zoning and monitoring of detrimental impact of potential sources of natural disasters.  Effective water \nmanagement is an essential element of the PRSP.   \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nPoverty is endemic in the project area, and, apart from the 6% of the population in white or blue collar jobs or in \nbusiness, virtually everyone is poor. Most women in the area are engaged in agricultural labor.  Many men migrate to \nRussia as there are no employment opportunities in the project districts. Field surveys revealed that the main sources \nof income of the interviewed households are remittances from labor migrants (27.4%), salaries and wages (18.7%), \noccasional earnings and proceeds from selling of agricultural products (27.4%). \n                                                 \n1  Tajikistan is finalizing its PRSP Realization Report (2002\u20132006). It concluded a Poverty Partnership Agreement \nwith ADB in December 2002.  \n ", "58  Appendix 11 \nThe households spend up to 80% of their incomes on food: flour products (41%), meat and meat products \n(14.4%), and vegetables (12.3%). Most food comes from subsistence farming or humanitarian aid.  \n \nRural households identified the following factors as causes of poverty in their area:  (i) natural disasters and floods \ncausing property losses (land, yields, houses, and livestock); (ii) lack of drinking and irrigation water, and problems \nwith drainage causing salinization; (iii) unemployment (lack of non-agricultural job opportunities); (iv) lack of and unfair \ndistribution of agricultural lands between households (households plots and dekhkan farms lands); and (v) unjustified \ndebts of farms to futures companies (investors)  for cotton production. \n \nSurveys revealed the following adverse impacts of previous floods on living standards in the project districts:  \n \n\u2022  Losses of personal property, houses and livestock and consequent damage family living conditions. \nBefore the most previous floods, no one considered their living conditions to be very bad and only 5.7% of \nrespondents assessed their living conditions to be bad. After the flood, 42.4% of respondents considered their \nliving conditions very bad and 37.1% bad. \n\u2022  Significant declines in income levels. Before the floods, 59.8% of respondents assessed their income level \nas medium, while 6.4% stated that their income was below medium and 0.4% marked considerably below \nmedium. After the flood, only 26.5% of respondents assessed their income as medium, whereas 36% \nassessed their income level as below the medium, and 35.2% indicated considerably below medium incomes.  \n\u2022  Emergence of higher levels of disease due to increased humidity in houses, bad quality of drinking water, \nand anxiety. In the project areas cases of malaria and typhoid were reported after floods. The number of \npeople suffering from rheumatism increased. Woman's diseases, high blood pressure and kidney diseases \nbecame more prevalent among villages residents.     \n\u2022  Rising groundwater results in lower agricultural yields (vegetables rot) and in deterioration of drinking \nwater quality.   \n\u2022  Decline in access to essential services because of the destruction of infrastructure: roads, schools, power \ntransmission and communication lines; and irrigation canals. \n\u2022  Increased level of labor migration. During the focus group discussions, more than 80% of both men and \nwomen noted that, as a result of the floods, the number of labor migrants moving abroad to earn money had  \nincreased. People use remittances to try to recover from the consequences of the flood.   \n \nThe Project addresses the core issues raised by households in the project areas in a number of ways.  First, it will \nrepair broken embankment areas along the Pyanj river, thereby reducing the likelihood of overall flooding to once in \n100 years, substantially improving the safety of the poor and their assets.  Second, it will provide equipment both to \nensure adequate maintenance of the repaired embankments and to provide help to communities along tributaries to \nperform essential repairs they cannot handle on their own.  Third, the project will conduct feasibility studies to \ndetermine what work can be undertaken on the tributaries to increase flood protection for communities that are \npotentially at risk.  Fourth, the project will provide more effective methods of flood risk warning, from risk maps to \nmeasurement mechanisms. These will enable the Government and communities to be able to better anticipate floods.  \nFifth, the project will work with both the Committee for Emergency Situations and, under a proposed Japan Fund For \nPoverty Reduction (JFPR) grant, with communities directly to ensure all members are prepared to deal with the results \nof floods.  Sixth, under the JFPR project, a significant area will be planted in trees in the project zone, and this area \nwill both act to strengthen the Hamadoni embankment and provide a valuable source of firewood and income \ngeneration for nearby households. \n \nHamadoni district will benefit directly from the Project because repairs to the embankments will lower the probability of \nfloods. The population of the four districts will benefit directly from the increased awareness of the potential for floods \nand their effects, improved preparedness for flood events and heightened readiness to act quickly to limit losses due \nto floods, and better awareness of post-flood requirements to speed recovery and to limit disease, non-agricultural \nlosses, and damage to household goods. Finally, work to create both community cohesion and better relations \nbetween  different  levels  of  government  through  the  Project  and  the  proposed  JFPR  project  will  enhance \nunderstanding by both sides of conditions and concerns of the poor, and lead to better information flows on how to \naddress issues of poverty related to disasters. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nParticipatory stakeholder consultations were conducted with representatives of local government (chairpersons of \ndistrict and jamoat leaders and their deputies), district emergency and civil defense authorities, heads of committees \nfor affairs of women and children and social issues under districts, international partners (United Nations Development ", "    Appendix 11     59     \nProgramme (UNDP), OXFAM, (Japan International Cooperation Agency ) JICA, ACTED, Mission East, Disaster \nPreparedness  ECHO  DIPECHO,  Focus),  local  NGOs  and  community-based  organizations,  and  the  general \npopulation.  The  consultations  addressed  the  main  social  and  economic  problems  of  the  area  and  possible \nmechanisms of community direct engagement in physical and non-physical flood management activities. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nThe Project\u2019s proposed participation strategy involves (i) collaboration between the CES and communities in the  \nprovision of disaster preparation equipment, training, and drills; (ii) during construction, contractor liaison with nearby \ncommunities  to  share  their  designs,  implementation  plans,  and  progress;  and  (iii)  during  the  feasibility  work, \nconsultations with communities in affected areas to determine their knowledge of previous floods and views on \npotential flood risks.   \n \nD.  Gender Development \n Strategy to maximize impacts on women: \nTo maximize their benefits under the Project, women will need access to decision-making, information, and income \noptions.  To engage women in decision-making, all levels of government (including the PMU and PIOs) will have at \nleast one professional woman directly involved in project activities. To ensure women have access to information, \nwomen will form 40% of the participants in all courses, and in courses in communities 50%.  Women will be eligible to \nprovide labor for local contractors during the construction phase, and contractors will report on the composition of their \nworkforces by sex. Their target for unskilled labor will be at least 15% women.   \n \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \n \nE.
