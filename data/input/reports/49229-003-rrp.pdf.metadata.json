The ensuing project will rehabilitate and upgrade the Salang Corridor\u2014one of \nthe few viable land routes linking the north and south of Afghanistan. The project will support the \ngovernment  in  (i)  studying  the  feasibility  of  three  alignment  options  for  the  rehabilitation  and \nupgrade  of  the  Salang  Corridor;  and  (ii)  completing  the  detailed  engineering  design, \nprocurement documentation, and project and safeguard documents for the selected option.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nAfghanistan is the geographic center of gravity in Central Asia, and has vast potential to \nbe the nexus between north\u2013south and east\u2013west regional trade corridors. Within Afghanistan, \none of the few viable land routes linking the south, including the capital of Kabul, with the north \nis  the  Salang  Tunnel  and  associated  connecting  roads,  collectively  known  as  the  Salang \nCorridor. Forming key sections of the CAREC Corridors 5 and 6, the Salang Corridor is the only \nroute that permits year-round north\u2013south passage of goods and people across the Hindu Kush \nmountain  range,  which has  peaks  over  7,700 meters  above  sea  level.  This  makes the  Salang \nTunnel  one  of  the  highest  tunnels  in  the  world.  Given  the  lack  of  alternative  routes,  the  vast \nmajority  of  goods  shipped  to  Kabul  from  the  north  traverse  the  Salang  Corridor.  Conservative \nestimates suggest that over 5,500 vehicles per day transit the Salang Corridor\u2014far exceeding \nits capacity. \n \n4. \nPlanned and designed over many years, construction of the 2.7-kilometer Salang Tunnel \nwas  completed  in  1964.  During  more  than  50  years  of  service,  proper  maintenance  and \nrehabilitation did not occur regularly, if at all, as a result of the 30 years of internal conflict and \nassociated effects on sector governance. Road crashes, fires, conflict-related acts, and constant \nusage have contributed to the tunnel falling into a state of severe disrepair. Present conditions \nwithin the tunnel are dangerous to users because of inadequate ventilation, poor lighting, lack of \nproper modern safety features, and a failing road surface\u2014all of which constrain the traffic flow \nand incur an estimated economic cost of $60 million per year.3 If the tunnel completely fails, the \ncosts  to  the  Afghan  economy  would  be  substantial  and  could  pose  an  additional  risk  to  the \nstability of the fragile and conflict-affected state (FCAS). \n  \n\n                                                 \n1  Financing partners: the governments of Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and the governments of \nGermany and the Netherlands through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Afghan National Army Trust Fund. \n\n2   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  Based on the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). 2012. Salang Tunnel Feasibility Study. \nKabul. Economic costs include vehicle operating costs, road crashes, and travel time resulting from congestion. \n\n\f2 \n \n\nIn 2012, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) completed a \n5. \nstudy that analyzed six potential options and various sub-options to solve the capacity problem \nand failure risk associated with the Salang Corridor. Although the USAID study was entitled the \nSalang  Tunnel  Feasibility  Study,  limitations  on  the  budget  and  study  scope  produced  what \nshould  be  termed  a  prefeasibility  study\u2014identifying  route  options  for  further  refinement  and \nfuture  study.  In  discussing  the  results,  and  given  the  very  broad  level  of  detail  of  this  initial \nstudy, USAID and the government decided to further study the more promising options to obtain \na better estimate of the costs as well as the technical, economic, and financial viability.   \n \n6. \nSince  the  publication  of  the  USAID  study,  and  given  delays  in  moving  forward  with  a \nlonger term solution, the World Bank agreed in 2015 to rehabilitate some of the most damaged \ngalleries in the existing tunnel, the road surface within the tunnel, and substantial sections of the \napproach  roads\u2014as  part  of  a  larger  project  focused  on  rehabilitating  the  roads  north  of  the \ntunnel from Baghlan to Bamyan. This will provide connectivity to the roads already rehabilitated \nor undergoing rehabilitation under the ADB-financed North\u2013South Corridor Project and tranche \n3  of  the  Multitranche  Financing  Facility  for  the  Transport  Network  Development  Investment \nProgram. 4 However,  the  World  Bank-financed  project  will  not  result  in  a  long-term  solution  to \nthe  corridor  traffic  capacity  constraint.  It  is  a  short-  to  medium-term  solution  for  the  Salang \nCorridor  by  keeping  the  existing  tunnel  open  year-round  and  precluding  a  total  failure  of  the \nstructure until a long-term solution is agreed on and implemented.5 \n \n7. \nThe ensuing project will improve regional and national connectivity by constructing new \ntunnels and connecting roads that will significantly improve the capacity of the Salang Corridor \nand  thereby  the  transport  network  of  Afghanistan.  The  ensuing  project  is  consistent  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s  national  infrastructure  priorities;  is  aligned  with  the  objectives  of  ADB\u2019s  interim \ncountry  partnership  strategy,  2014\u20132015  for  Afghanistan  and  the  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy \n2020; and is included in the country operations business plan, 2016\u20132018 for Afghanistan.6   \n \nADB  has  assisted  Afghanistan  in  rehabilitating  CAREC  Corridors  5  and  6  through \n8. \n(i) completion of the North\u2013South Corridor Project,7 (ii) ongoing construction of the Jabul Seraj\u2013\nNijrab road, (iii) ongoing construction of the Kabul\u2013Jalalabad road, and (iv) planned construction \nof the approved yet remaining un-rehabilitated link in the North\u2013South Corridor between Dar-i-\nSuf  and  Yakawlang.  The  latter  three  interventions  are  being  funded  under  the  Transport \nNetwork  Development  Investment  Program. 8  Collectively,  these  two  CAREC  corridors  form \nsignificant sections of Afghanistan\u2019s national transport network, providing connectivity between \nnorth and south as well as links to three of the four major urban centers: Mazar-e-Sharif, Kabul, \nand Jalalabad.  \n \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB.  2006.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Multitranche \nFinancing  Facility  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  for  the  Transport  Network  Development  Investment \nProgram. Manila (see periodic financing requests for Tranches 1, 2, and 3). \n\n\f3 \n\nThrough  these  interventions,  ADB  has  accumulated  a  wealth  of  experience  on  how  to \n9. \nexecute road transport projects in Afghanistan, which is an FCAS. Lessons include (i) ensuring \nthe security of consultants and contractors, (ii) the need for up-front support to the government \non project design, and (iii) the need for close support to the government on consultant selection \nand procurement. \n \n10. \nTogether  with  the  other  completed,  ongoing,  and  planned  ADB-financed  interventions, \nas  well  as  the  World  Bank-financed  project,  the  ensuing  project  will  increase  the  capacity, \nefficiency, and reliability of CAREC Corridors 5 and 6 by rehabilitating the Salang Corridor with \na  long-term  solution  spanning  a  planning  horizon  of  more  than  50  years.  The  ensuing  project \nwill  (i)  reduce  the  cost  of  passenger  and  cargo  transportation  between  the  southern  and \nnorthern  regions  of  Afghanistan  and  Central  Asia  by  reducing  travel  times;  (ii)  ensure  the \nsecurity,  reliability,  and  year-round  use  of  the  Salang  Corridor  by  providing  some  redundancy \nthrough the availability of two alternative routes; and (iii) promote trade and investment.  \n \n11. \nAdditionally, the ensuing project will produce road safety benefits and may be a vehicle \nfor  introducing  private  sector  participation  in  the  transport  sector  through  possible  partial \nfinancing of construction and future operations and maintenance. Based on the previous USAID \nstudy  and  the  three  options  remaining  for  consideration,  the  ensuing  project  is  tentatively \nestimated  to  cost  $1,150  million\u2013$1,600  million,  including  taxes,  duties,  and  physical \ncontingencies. The feasibility study and detailed engineering design to be undertaken under this \nproject will provide more confident estimates. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n12. \nThe impact the project is aligned with is the accelerated implementation of the ensuing \nproject,  contributing  to  improved  efficiency  and  safer  movement  of  goods  and  people  in \nAfghanistan and across Central and West Asia. The outcome of the project will be the ensuing \nproject designed and procured, ready for implementation.  \n \n13. \nThe  intended  impact  of  the  ensuing  project  will  be  enhanced  regional  connectivity  and \ntrade  through  the  Salang  Corridor.  The  outcome  of  the  ensuing  project  will  be  improved \nefficiency and safer movement of goods and people through the Salang Corridor.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  outputs  of  the  project  are  (i)  feasibility  studies  on  three  alignment  options \n14. \ncompleted;  and  (ii)  detailed  engineering  design,  procurement  documentation,  and  project  and \nsafeguard  documents  on  the  selected  option  completed.  The  two  outputs  relate  to  the  two \ndistinct  phases  of  the  project.  In  the  first  phase,  feasibility  studies  will  be  undertaken  on  the \nthree alignment options considered most viable in the USAID study.9 The options will be studied \nfrom  a  technical,  financial,  economic,  social,  and  environmental  point  of  view.  The  ability  for \neach alignment option to meet long-term capacity needs will be assessed. Based on the results \nof the feasibility studies, the government, supported by ADB, will decide on the alignment option \nthat would best meet the future needs of the Salang Corridor. \n \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n9  These  are  options  2,  3,  and  4.  Further  details  of  the  three  alignment  options  are  in  the  Project  Administration \n\nManual (PAM, accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n \n\n\f4 \n \n\n15.  When  the  preferred  option  has  been  identified,  the  project  will  move  to  the  second \nphase,  which  will  undertake  a  detailed  engineering  design  on  the  selected  option,  prepare \ndetailed  cost  estimates,  formulate  environmental  and  social  safeguards  planning  documents, \nand complete advance procurement for the ensuing project to the stage of civil works contracts \nready to be signed.  \n \nD. \n \nThe  project \n16. \ncontingencies (Table 1).10  \n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nto  cost  $31.37  million, \n\ntaxes,  duties,  and \n\nis  estimated \n\nincluding \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n \n\nAmounta \n\nBase Costb \n1.  \n2.  \n\nOutput 1: Feasibility studies on three alignment options \nOutput 2: Detailed engineering design, procurement documentation,       \n\nItem \nA.  \n \n \n                          and project and safeguard documents on selected options \n \nB.  \n \na  Includes  taxes  and  duties  of  about  $2  million  to  be  financed  by  the  Asian  Development  Fund  and  Afghanistan \nInfrastructure  Trust  Fund  (AITF)  grant  resources.

The financing plan is in Table 2. \n\n                                                 \n10  Detailed  cost  estimates  by  expenditure  category  and  detailed  cost  estimates  by  financier  are  in  the  PAM \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n11  A country\u2019s eligibility for Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants under the revised grant framework is determined \nby  its  risk  of  debt  distress.  The  latest  debt  sustainability  analysis determined  that  Afghanistan  had  a high  risk  of \ndebt distress and was therefore eligible to receive 100% of its ADF allocation as grants. \n\n12 Financing partners: the governments of Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and the governments \nof Germany and the Netherlands through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Afghan National Army Trust Fund. \n13 Taxes  and  duties  costs  are  the  business  receipt  tax,  estimated  at  7%;  the  fixed  tax  on  imports  of  2%\u20137%;  and \ncustom  duties  of  2%\u201316%.

By offering up-front grant financing for the \npreparation  of  the  ensuing  project,  the  project  is  considered  highly  relevant  from  an  FCAS \nperspective.  Without  the  project,  the  government  would  not  have  any  recourse  to  funds  for \npreparing the ensuing project, which is of national strategic importance. The project will support \nthe government in raising the required resources for the ensuing project, including through the \npublic\u2013private  partnership  modality.  The  ensuing  project  will  fully  take  into  account  FCAS \nprinciples,  and  consider  how  to  allow  maximum  use  of  national  contractors.  Procurement \npackages will be prepared accordingly. \n \n19. \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the executing agency of the project. The Ministry \nof Public Works (MPW), through the ADB-financed program management office (PMO), will be \nthe  implementing  agency.  Since  its  inception  in  2009,  the  MPW\u2013PMO  has  accumulated \nconsiderable experience in ADB-financed projects and is being reformed for greater efficiency. \nDuring  project  implementation,  the  MPW  will  ensure  that  a  team  of  staff  with  sufficient \nexperience  in  procurement,  engineering,  financial  management,  accounting,  and  program \nmonitoring and evaluation, as well as legal, administrative, and secretarial matters, is available \nin the PMO. The MPW will ensure that a project manager is assigned to the PMO for the day-to-\nday management and implementation of the project. The consultants to be recruited under the \nproject  will  offer  additional  capacity  to  the  PMO  in  areas  such  as  procurement,  financial \nmanagement, environment safeguards, and social safeguards. The PMO will also be equipped \nwith the necessary office space, equipment, and facilities to undertake its duties.  \n \nTwo international consulting firms will be mobilized for the implementation of the project. \n20. \nThe first will undertake the feasibility studies and detailed engineering design, while the second \nwill provide an independent proof check of the detailed engineering design to be developed by \nthe first firm, specifically for the tunnels and galleries. The terms of reference for both consulting \nfirms are in the project administration manual (PAM).14 Full technical proposals will be solicited \nfor the first firm, and simplified technical proposals will be used for the second firm. Both firms \nwill be recruited using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of \n90:10.  Additional  individual  consultants  and  resource  persons  will  be  recruited  to  carry  out \ncapacity building and implementation support to the PMO, especially in financial management, \nprocurement, and work requiring highly technical skills. Individual consultants and procurement \nof  small  equipment  will  be  paid  through  an  imprest  account.  Consultants  will  be  selected  and \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended \nfrom time to time).

The \n\n\f7 \n\nwork  under  this  project  will  require  a  highly  qualified  consulting  firm,  with  experience  in \ndesigning  and  procuring  contractors for  large-scale  projects  involving  tunnels  in  difficult terrain \nand  security  environments.  The  project  will  assess  the  technical,  economic,  financial,  social, \nand environmental feasibility of the ensuing project. Viable engineering options will be prepared \nand optimized for economy and construction efficiency in accordance with international practice \nand applicable standards. The designs will integrate climate-proofing measures and use proven \ntechnology  with  standard  materials  compatible  with  local  conditions.  Methodologies  in \ndeveloping a robust tunnel and road maintenance regime will be developed. Road safety will be \nexplicitly taken into consideration in the detailed engineering design.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe ensuing project will support Afghanistan\u2019s economic growth and reduce poverty by \n24. \nensuring  reliable  access  between  the  northern  and  southern  parts  of  the  country.  Under  the \nproject,  economic  analyses  will  be  conducted  to  evaluate  the  national  and  regional  economic \nbenefits  of  the  preferred  tunnel  option  by  comparing  the  with-  and  without-project  scenarios, \nincluding  risk-based  analysis  of  failure  without  the  project.  Such  a  failure  is  not  an  unlikely \nevent.  Financial  analysis  will  also  be  prepared  in  consideration  of  the  substantial  demand  for \nfunding for both construction as well as operations and maintenance. The financial analysis will \nconsider the application of tolls for funding part of the capital investment as well as operations \nand maintenance. The economic analysis will be conducted according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nthe Economic Analysis of Projects and the Cost\u2013Benefit Analysis for Development: A Practical \nGuide.15 It  will  cover  all  aspects  of  analysis  as  specified  in  ADB\u2019s  Operations  Manual  on  the \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects  and  summarized  in  the  Key  Areas  of  Economic  Analysis  of \nInvestment Projects: An Overview.16  \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\nGovernance risks are prevalent in Afghanistan, in areas of public financial management, \n25. \nprocurement,  and  corruption.  ADB  conducted  a  financial  risk  assessment  of  the  MPW  and \nPMO, and found that the inherent and control risks were both moderate. The project has been \ndesigned to mitigate such governance risks. First, ADB will select the consultants to be recruited \nunder  the  project,  reducing  start-up  delays.  Second,  ADB  has  prepared  an  updated  financial \nmanagement assessment of the MPW and its PMO. This found that the MPW and its PMO have \nsignificantly improved their financial management capabilities in 2015, and now have adequate \nstaff  and  a  satisfactory organizational  structure for  proper  planning,  accounting,  disbursement, \nreplenishment, and reporting. Third, consultants recruited under the project will provide day-to-\nday  support  to  the  MPW  and  PMO  on  the  financial  management  of  the  project.  Details  of  the \nfinancial management assessment and disbursement procedures are described in the PAM.  \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n26. \nwith the government and MPW.

Because  the  project  is  focused  on  project  preparation,  it  will  not  have  any \nadverse social and environmental consequences. The project is categorized C for environment, \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  ensuing  project  will  be  designed  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  government  laws,  guidelines, \nregulations,  and  policies.  During  project \nthe  consultants  will  prepare \nenvironmental  impact  assessments  or  initial  environmental  examinations,  as  applicable,  along \nwith climate risk and vulnerability assessments, and environmental management plans that will \nbe  incorporated  in  the  project\u2019s  procurement  documentation.
