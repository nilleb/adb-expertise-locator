The report \nalso describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for the Capacity Building of the Bagmati River \nBasin  (BRB)  Water  Management  Institutions,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.  \n\nThe Bagmati River Basin Improvement Project (current project) will improve river health \n2. \nand flood  management  in  the  BRB.  The  additional  financing  is  required  to  expand  the  current \nproject, including (i) consolidation of water management institutions; (ii) expansion of riverbank \nbeautification works; (iii) mobilization of the riverine community; and (iv) the design, building, and \noperation of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The additional financing is also required to \ncover cost overruns associated with the current project,1 the performance of which is on track.2 \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nThe BRB has important cultural and economic value for the people of Nepal. The water of \nthe Bagmati River is considered holy and is used for cultural and ritual ceremonies practiced at \nthe many significant riverbank temples. The river flows through Kathmandu Valley, which is the \nadministrative and economic center of the country, and Nepal\u2019s gateway for tourism. The river \nprovides most of the city\u2019s drinking water in its upper basin, with hydropower generation in the \nupper and middle basins, and large-scale irrigation in the lower basin. \n\n4. \nThe BRB is considered the most water-stressed river basin in Nepal. Kathmandu City\u2019s \nrapid and unplanned expansion has placed tremendous pressure on the upper river system. In \nthe absence of appropriate solid waste and wastewater management, the river has become an \nopen  sewer  with  high  fecal  contamination,  a  heavy  solid  waste  load,  and  physicochemical \npollutants. River pollution is further aggravated in the dry season when 80% of the river flow is \nwithdrawn for drinking purposes. The condition of the riverbanks has been increasingly degraded \nby  solid  waste  dumping,  encroachment,  and  uncoordinated  works  by  various  government \ndepartments. The physical deterioration of the riverine environment has created a public health \nhazard, as well as the loss of cultural and recreational amenities for urban communities. \n\n5. \nThe Government of Nepal has long attempted to address the degradation of the BRB. In \nthe 1990s efforts were made to improve river management through creation of the High Powered \nCommittee for Integrated Development of the Bagmati Civilization (HPCIDBC), and by embracing \nthe principles of integrated water resources management.3 The Bagmati Action Plan approved by \nthe government in 2009 formed the basis for Asian Development Bank (ADB) involvement in the \nBRB  improvement  effort.  The  current  project  supported  further  policy,  legal,  and  institutional \nimprovements  by  assisting  in  the  development  of  a  new  Federal  Integrated  Water  Resources \nPolicy, which was finalized in late 2018 and is being considered for approval by the Cabinet. The \n                                                \n1  Cost overruns resulted primarily from depreciation of special drawing rights vs. the United States dollar, which could \n\nnot be predicted. \n\n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). Nepal. Bagmati River Basin Improvement Project. The current project is financed \nby an Asian Development Fund (ADF) loan of $25.5 million equivalent (Loan 3057-NEP, which as of 1 January 2017 \nis a concessional loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources), an ADF grant of $4.5 million (Grant 0367-NEP), and \nabout $0.5 million in cofinancing from the Multidonor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility. The \nproject was declared effective in February 2014 and is expected to close by 29 February 2020. \n\n3  Government  of  Nepal.  2002.  Water  Resources  Strategy.  Kathmandu;  and  Government  of  Nepal.  2005.  National \n\nWater Plan. Kathmandu. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\npolicy provides the foundation for a new water act, which is under preparation and is expected to \nbe submitted for approval by Parliament during the first quarter of 2020. Approval of the act will \nenable the long-term establishment of river basin organizations (RBOs), including the Bagmati \nRBO, which was established temporarily through an executive order approved by the cabinet on \n19  January  2017.  The  BRB  is  a  sub-basin  of  the  Koshi  River  basin  for  which  an  RBO  will  be \nformed to oversee the entire river basin including the Bagmati RBO. \n\n6. \nADB  support  to  the  Bagmati  River  basin.  ADB  approved  the  current  project  on  31 \nOctober 2013 to support government and civil society initiatives to improve water management \nand the river environment in the upper BRB (footnote 1). Output 1 of the current project supports \nthe establishment of an RBO with adequate capacity and decision support systems to implement \nintegrated water resources management. Output 2 aims to improve the riverbank\u2019s environment \nin Kathmandu Valley through riverbed oxygenating weirs, riverbank beautification, and community \nmobilization and awareness-raising. Output 3 aims to increase water availability in the river during \nthe dry season through the construction of upstream water storage, pilot groundwater recharge \nschemes, and upstream watershed management. Output 4 provides a flood forecasting and early \nwarning  system  to  reduce  flood  impacts  on  riverine  communities  along  the  BRB.  The  current \nproject  is  complemented  by  the  Kathmandu  Valley Wastewater  Management  Project,  which is \nfinancing the design, construction, and management of strategic WWTPs.4 \n\nPerformance  of  the  current  project.  The  performance  of  the  current  project  is \n7. \nconsidered  satisfactory.  The  current  project  was  rated  on-track  for  the  past  12  months  and \nexceeds its contract awards and disbursement projections. The current project is due to close on \n29  February  2020.  In  terms  of  physical  achievements,  output  1  activities  were  completed  in \nDecember 2018; output 2 activities should be completed by December 2019; output 3 activities \nshould be completed by February 2020; and output 4 activities were completed in July 2018.5 \n\n8. \nThe need for continued support for Bagmati River preservation. Under the current \nproject, civil society organizations were established and have become active stakeholders in the \nprotection  of  sections  of  the  upper  Bagmati  River  in the  Kathmandu  Valley.  The  organizations \nneed  to  be  further  strengthened,  and  their  activities  extended  to  other  stretches  of  the  river. \nBeautification  works  have  used  nature-based  solutions,  which  have  renewed  residents\u2019 \nappreciation  of  the  Bagmati  River,  but  these  works  cover  only  about  half  of  the  urban  area. \nExpanding  their  scope  to  include  other  culturally  significant  river  stretches,  including  restoring \nriverine heritage buildings, would significantly increase the current project\u2019s impact. These historic \nbuildings, which were severely damaged during the 2015 earthquakes, are closely related to the \nriver and have significant cultural importance for Kathmandu\u2019s citizens. River water availability will \nincrease through the completion of upstream water storage under the current project, which will \nallow targeted releases of water during the dry season, but additional work is needed to capture \nand treat contaminated water from the Tukucha tributary to improve water quality for reuse in the \nmain river branch. A flood forecasting and early warning system was developed, but more end-\nuser training activities are needed to enhance communities\u2019 response to flood warnings. The need \nto scale up the current project scope was anticipated,6 and feasibility studies and preparation of \ndetailed designs were undertaken under the current project for this purpose. \n\n                                                \n4  ADB.

The additional financing will also address a cost overrun, \nestimated  at  $2.2  million,  resulting  from  the  unforeseen  depreciation  of  special  drawing  rights \nagainst the United States dollar which was not possible to forecast.  \n\n10. \nThe  proposed  additional  financing  project  meets  the  eligibility  criteria  for  additional \nfinancing.  The  overall  project  (i)  remains  technically  feasible  and  economically  viable;  (ii)  is \naccorded  high  priority  by  the  government;  (iii)  is  consistent  with  the  project\u2019s  development \nobjectives; (iv) is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Nepal, 2013\u20132017;7 and \n(v) is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priorities on (a) making cities more livable; \n(b) tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing \nenvironmental  sustainability;  and  (c)  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity.8 The \nadditional financing project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2019\u20132021.9 \n\nThe proposed additional financing will strengthen the current project achievements. It will \n\n11. \nensure continuity in actions by the government and civil society to restore the Bagmati River. \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n12. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: a clean, green, and healthy Bagmati River \nsystem that  is full  of  life  and valued by  all.10 The project  will  have the following  outcome: river \nhealth and flood management improved.11 \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n13. \n\nThe additional financing has four key outputs, the same as the current project. \n\n14. \nOutput  1:  Systems  and  capacity  for  integrated  and  participatory  river  basin \nmanagement established. The additional financing will (i) construct and equip a new regional \nbuilding for the Koshi River basin office, (ii) purchase information technology (IT) equipment for \nthe Koshi River basin office and the Bagmati RBO to support river management, and (iii) provide \ncapacity  building  to  the  Koshi  River  basin  office  and  the  Bagmati  RBO  staff  through  attached \ntransaction TA. \n\n15. \nOutput 2: Riverbank environment in urban areas improved. The additional financing \nwill (i) finance cost overruns of the current project\u2019s river environment civil works; (ii) stabilize and \nbeautify an additional 5.75 kilometers of riverbank, including landscaping and restoration of 23 \nhistoric cultural monuments located on the riverbanks; and (iii) mobilize, raise awareness, and \nbuild capacity of local government and communities for riverbank management and maintenance. \n\n16. \nOutput 3: Water availability in the basin during dry season increased and watershed \nconservation improved. The additional financing will construct and operate a WWTP to clean \n\n                                                \n7  ADB.  2013.  Country  Partnership  Strategy:  Nepal,  2013\u20132017.

About 17 million \nliters  of  treated  effluent  will  be  released  in  the  river  daily  and  contribute  to  increased  Bagmati \nRiver flow in the dry season. The WWTP will be  built on the bank of the Bagmati  River at the \nconfluence  with  the  Tukucha  tributary.  Located  in  a  highly  populated  area,  the WWTP  will  be \nodorless, and integrated into the riverbank landscape. A sludge digester will be built to produce \nelectric  power  and  reduce  the  plant\u2019s  power  and  sludge  disposal  expenses.  The  additional \nfinancing will also fund the civil works cost overruns and tree planting under the environmental \nmanagement plan for the upstream water storage being constructed under the current project. \n\n17. \nOutput 4: Functioning flood forecasting and early warning system for the Bagmati \nRiver basin utilized. The additional financing will provide funds for a civil society organization to \ntrain  18  communities  along  the  Bagmati  River  downstream  of  Kathmandu  in  implementing  a \ncommunity-based  flood  early  warning  system.  This  system  was  designed  and  piloted  in \ncommunities under the current project. \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n18. \nThe  overall  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $114.8  million,  including  additional  financing  of \n$78.8  million  (Table  1).

The TA will focus on capacity building in IT applications \nfor improved river basin management. It will have three outputs: (i) capacity and tools for river \nasset  management  and  water  quality  data  processing  by  the  Bagmati  RBO  developed;  (ii) \ncapacity of the Bagmati RBO and the Koshi River basin office to use a geographic information \nsystem  and  the  decision  support  system  for  water  management  scenarios  improvement,  and \ndisplay  results  to  the  BRB  stakeholders,  increased;  and  (iii)  flood  forecasting  and  measures \nimproved through routine use and extension of the flood forecasting and early warning system by \nBagmati  RBO,  Koshi  River  basin  office,  and  the  Department  of  Hydrology  and  Meteorology. \nThese outputs will be supported through associated TA because the tasks are specialized and \nrequire  specific  consultant  skills  and  functional  IT  systems  and  networks  in  the  offices.  The \ntransaction TA is estimated to cost $620,000, of which $600,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The government will provide counterpart \nstaff,  office  space,  workshop  venues,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  Water  and  Energy \nCommission  Secretariat  (WECS)  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA,  which  will  be \nimplemented over 3 years.15 \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n25. \nCivil  works.  The  Tukucha  WWTP  will  have  the  capacity  to  purify  17.3  million  liters  of \nsewage  per  day  which  corresponds  to  the  wastewater  produced  by  a  town  with  144,170 \ninhabitants.  The  WWTP  will  be  constructed  on  the  bank  of  the  Bagmati  River.  An  innovative \ndesign  was  supported  by  ADB  to  address  several  constraints,  including  (i)  limited  space  for \nconstruction;  (ii)  a  location  close  to  residential  areas,  a  cultural  heritage  area,  and  within  the \n                                                \n15 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nflooding  area  of  the  Bagmati  River;  (iii)  high  fluctuations  in  the  quantity  and  quality  of  the \nwastewater; and (iv) integration into the urban landscape. To address these, the WWTP will adopt \ncompact treatment technology with covered basins and cover slabs above the flood level. The \nproposed purification technology comprises an activated sludge plant operating according to the \nsequencing  batch  reactor  process.  This  process  has  a  smaller  footprint  than  other  activated \nsludge plants and is well known in the subregion but was not yet adopted in Nepal. Polluted air \nwill  be  drawn  out  of  the  buildings  and  passed  through  air  filtration  and  purification  facilities  to \nremove  any  harmful  emissions  and  nuisance  odors.  The  construction  will  be  built  partially \nunderground  and  partially  above  ground,  and  will  consider  a  50-year  flood  return  period.  The \nbasins will be covered and planted with grass. All plant amenities will be designed following the \nlocal architectural style, and the aesthetics of the site will be enhanced through landscaping. \n\nADB value addition also focused on the designs for the riverbank beautification work and \n26. \nthe Tukucha WWTP. These designs were produced with the support of an urban architect and \ncultural heritage specialist. They will use local materials (e.g., stones, wood, and traditional bricks) \nfor construction, and incorporate local cultural amenities and architectural features in the design. \nThe design exceeds local standards for flood management to anticipate climate change impacts.16  \n\n27. \nAn assessment  of  the condition  and structural  design of the  damaged  cultural  heritage \nbuildings was undertaken by cultural heritage architects and structural engineers, and reviewed \nby a cultural heritage specialist working for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \nOrganization. The  designs  and construction  methodology follow  national  standards for  cultural \nheritage  restoration.  All  buildings  will  be  restored,  renovated,  or  rebuilt  in  accordance  with  the \noriginal  ancient  design,  with  the  inclusion  of  specific  structural  improvements  to  ensure \nearthquake resilience. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nAll  project  outputs  are  nonrevenue  generating.  Therefore,  a  financial  sustainability \n28. \nanalysis was completed to consider whether the owners of the assets developed by the project \nadditional financing will be able to support the operation and maintenance costs of  (i) landscaping \nalong the riverbanks of the Bagmati, (ii) restored historic temples and monuments, and (iii) the \nTukucha WWTP. The asset owners can sustainably cover the recurrent costs associated with the \nproject assets, but mitigation measures have been put into place to address the associated risks. \n\n29. \nFor  the  economic  analysis,  a  comprehensive  nonmarket  valuation  exercise  was \ncompleted to estimate the economic benefits from the additional financing using a survey-based \nmethod. A sample of households in urban Kathmandu were asked how much they are willing to \npay  for  improved  water  quality  in  the  Bagmati  River,  landscaping  along  the  riverbanks,  and \nrestoration  of  historic  temples  and  monuments  along  the  riverbanks.  Survey  results  were \nanalyzed by developing econometric models to estimate the willingness-to-pay of an individual \nhousehold; these results were then scaled up to all households in the  urban Kathmandu area. \nThe  results  showed  urban  Kathmandu  households  are  willing  to  pay  $15.83  per  year  for  an \nimproved  Bagmati  River  environment.  A  separate  nonmarket  valuation  exercise  estimated  the \nwillingness-to-pay  of  international  visitors  to  the  project  area;  these  visitors  are  willing  to  pay \n\n                                                \n16 Increased flood intensity is the main potential risk associated with climate change. To account for this risk, the project \nconsidered a 100-year flood return period for the design of the infrastructure. This is the maximum flood that can be \naccommodated within the available space of the river corridors. Flood return periods considered by the government \nare more typically 25\u201350 years. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n$23.90 for the amenity values provided by the project. The economic analysis only included the \nbenefits to Kathmandu households to focus on the \u201cwithin country\u201d benefits of the project. \n\n30. \nUsing the nonmarket valuation estimate of economic benefits and the additional financing \ncosts, the estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 6.7%; the economic net present \nvalue is $120.1 million. The EIRR is higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital estimated \nat 6.0%, which is the rate used in ADB environment projects.17 This indicates that the additional \nfinancing is economically viable. A 6% social discount rate is used for ADB environment projects, \ninstead of the usual social discount rate of 9%. In addition, for this project, the lower discount rate \nthreshold is justified by the omission of benefits to international visitors\u2014 if included, these would \nraise the EIRR to 18%. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using simulation to estimate the risk \naround  the  EIRR  and  economic  net  present  value  results.  Simulation  results  showed  that  the \nEIRR ranged from a minimum 0.0% to a maximum 12.1%, with a probability of about 30% that \nthe EIRR was less than the threshold discount rate of 6.0%. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n31. \nFinancial  management.  A  financial  management  assessment  of  HPCIDBC,  the \nDepartment of Irrigation, and WECS was carried out in accordance with ADB guidelines during \nthe  current  project  preparation,  and  updated  for  the  additional  financing. 18  The  overall  risk \nassessment for the project is moderate. HPCIDBC has experience in implementing the current \nproject and has proven ability to manage funds adequately. The project accounts will be audited \nyearly by the Office of the Auditor General. \n\nThe main risks include (i) lack of a comprehensive internal audit function, (ii) inadequate \n32. \nvariance analysis in financial and physical targets, and (iii) turnover of financial management staff \nduring implementation. These risks will be mitigated through the following measures: (i) a financial \nmanagement specialist will be engaged to provide support and capacity building to the project, \n(ii) regular training on ADB\u2019s financial management procedures and requirements will be provided \nto the project\u2019s financial management staff, (iii) the quarterly and annual financial reporting will be \nenhanced, and (iv) the external audit\u2019s terms of reference will be strengthened in examining the \nproject\u2019s internal control framework. \n\n33. \nProcurement. The procurement of goods and works, and recruitment of consultants will \nfollow  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The updated procurement \ncapacity assessment concluded that the overall procurement risk for the project is low. The project \ncoordination and management unit and WECS have experience in procurement in accordance \nwith  ADB  requirements  and  have  demonstrated  their  capacity  under  the  current  project. \nInternational and national procurement specialists are provided by ADB to prepare the design\u2013\nbuild\u2013operate bidding documents and support the evaluation process. Funds were allocated in \nthe project to provide consulting services to assist with contract management. \n\n34. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  Ministry  of  Urban  Development  (MOUD).  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 12). \n\n                                                \n17 ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n35. \nThe  project  is classified  effective  gender mainstreaming.  A  Gender  Equality  and  Social \nInclusion Action Plan was designed for the current project and updated for the additional financing \nbased  on  implementation  performance;  currently  (i)  women  hold  16%  of  civil  works  contract \nemployment,  (ii)  women  make  up  53%  and  excluded  social  groups  37%  of  those  involved  in \nwatershed conservation groups, and (iii) women account for 66% and excluded social groups for \n33%  of  those  involved  in  training  related  to  rainwater  harvesting.  While  the  primary  project \nbeneficiaries  are  the  people  living  in  the  BRB,  all  residents  (including  the  poor  and  socially \nexcluded)  will  benefit  from  (i)  improved  water  security,  (ii)  conservation  of  the  watershed  and \nincreased river flow, (iii) improvements to sanitation and the river environment, (iv) reduced flood \nhazards impacts, (v) improved governance through establishment of a dedicated RBO, and (vi) \ncapacity development of local residents. \n\n36. \nThe additional financing will provide women, the poor, and socially excluded with access \nto project benefits. Job reserves will allocate 20% of employment in project construction created \nfor women and 10% for socially excluded people, while 33% of membership in community group \nplatforms  created  by  the  project  will  be  reserved  for  women  members,  and  20%  for  poor  and \nsocially excluded groups. In addition, the needs of women, children, and the disabled and elderly \nwill inform disaster management responses in all community-based flood adaptation programs. \nThe  current  project  has  prepared  a  stakeholder  communication  strategy  for  community \nawareness and participation to mobilize stakeholders for widespread and meaningful participation. \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n37. \nEnvironment.  The  additional  financing  is  classified  category  B  for  the  environment  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The additional financing will have no \nsignificant adverse impacts and will improve the condition of heritage buildings and enhance the \nwater quality of Bagmati River. Environmental impacts associated with air quality and construction \nwaste will be temporary and mitigated with respect to anticipated riverbank works in the urban \narea,  the  proposed  project  design  will  contribute  to  improvement  of  their  environment. \nStakeholders were and will continue to be consulted. ADB will post the final initial environmental \nexamination and environmental monitoring reports on its website.19 \n\n38. \nSocial  safeguards.  The  additional  financing  is  classified  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Stabilization  and \nlandscaping  of  riverbanks  under  the  additional  financing  will  cause  involuntary  resettlement \nimpacts  to  18  affected  persons,  including  (i)  permanent  physical  displacement  of  17  nontitle \nholders  and  (ii)  temporary  physical  displacement  of  1  nontitle  holder  (a  holy  man  who  will \ntemporarily  move  during  construction  and  return  to  live  in  a  shrine).  A  resettlement  plan  was \nprepared and will be disclosed on the ADB website.20 \n\n39. \nThe  project  is  classified  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. Project screening confirms that indigenous peoples are not present \nin the project area, and that those living in the river basin area will benefit equally from the project. \n\n                                                \n19 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n40.
