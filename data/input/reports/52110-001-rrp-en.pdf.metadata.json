It will improve access to market-based, long-term finance for producers, \nprocessing enterprises, input suppliers, and service providers in the livestock value chain. The \nproject will help increase livestock productivity, sustainability, processing capacity and utilization; \nas well as marketing of inputs and livestock products. It will facilitate the development of private \nsector  veterinary  practices  to  improve  access  to  clinical  veterinary  services  and  animal \nmanagement and health advice. This will in turn promote long-term economic and environmental \nsustainability and enhance profitability for producers and agribusiness enterprises. Together with \nongoing Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance in horticulture value chain development, the \nproject will help diversify the country\u2019s agriculture from cotton production to high-value agricultural \nproducts that generate better financial and economic returns, and have fewer associated social \nand environmental concerns.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nSector performance. Uzbekistan\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by at least 8.0% \nper  year  during  2007\u20132014.2  Growth  has  subsequently  slowed\u2014GDP  grew  by  5.1%  in  2018, \nreaching $48.7 billion, with growth projected to rise to 5.2% in 2019 and 5.5% in 2020.3 Lower \ngrowth rates in 2018 reflected weak agricultural performance, the impact of the devaluation of the \nUzbek sum in September 2017, and reduced domestic demand. The generally high growth rates \nsince  2000  have  helped  reduce  poverty\u2014according  to  national  poverty  line  estimates,  the \nproportion of people defined as poor declined from 27.5% of the population in 2001 to 11.6% in \n2018.4 However, the unemployment rate has increased from 5.2% in 2016 to 9.3% in 2018.5 In \nline with total GDP growth, agriculture output grew an annual rate of 6.4%\u20137.2% from 2010 to \n2016, but the growth rate fell to 1.2% in 2017 and is estimated at 0.2% in 2018, largely as a result \nof poor rainfall that cut the cereal harvest by 12.5% and broader crop production by 4.5%. When \ncombined  with  higher rates  of growth in other  sectors (industry grew  by 4.8%  and  services by \n6.4%  in  2017),  the  low  rate  of  growth  in  agriculture  contributed  to  the  continuing  decline  in \nagriculture\u2019s contribution to GDP, from 34.4% in 2000 to 19.2% in 2017. Agriculture\u2019s share of \ntotal  employment  has  also  declined,  although  more  slowly:  in  2000,  agriculture  accounted  for \n36.7% of total employment, which fell to 27.2% in 2017. Agriculture remains an important source \nof employment and income, especially in rural areas, which are home to 49% of the population, \nand 75% of people living below the national poverty line. \n \n4. \nLivestock development. In 2016, the livestock subsector accounts for 40% of agriculture \ngross value added, which equates to about 8% of total GDP.6 Within livestock, dairy production \nmakes up 45% of livestock gross value added. Livestock production grew 4.2% in 2017 and 6.5% \n\n                                                \n1  ADB. Preparing the Livestock Value Chain Development Project. \n2  ADB. 2018.

Tashkent. \n\n \n\n\fin 2018, outpacing the growth in agriculture overall. Despite this growth in production, Uzbekistan \nhas  a  trade  deficit  in  livestock  products,  although  this  has  improved  since  2015.7  In  2017, \nUzbekistan imported $86.4 million in livestock products and exported only $11.2 million, resulting \nin a trade deficit of $75.2 million, down from $123.6 million in 2015. \n \n5. \nIn 2018, livestock production included 2.42 million tons of meat (live weight), 10.48 million \ntons of milk, 7.36 billion eggs, and 35,000 tons of wool (footnote 6). Most livestock owners and \nproducers are small in scale, accounting for about 90% of total production (95% of milk, 94% of \nmeat, and 55% of eggs). However, productivity on small farms is low. Milk yields, for instance, \naverage 1,300 liters per lactation or about 6 liters per day, compared with an international average \nof 22 liters per day. When combined with poor cooling and distribution infrastructure, this means \nsmall farms are not well integrated into supply chains. A number of key constraints need to be \naddressed for small farms to increase productivity and for the livestock subsector to realize its \npotential. \n \n6. \nLimited supply of fodder and feed. The emphasis on cotton and wheat production has \nin the  past  adversely  affected the  production  of fodder. The  area  under fodder  has  historically \nbeen less than 5% of arable land. This severely limits the supply of fodder and is well below the \ncontribution of livestock to agricultural output. The relaxation of production quotas for cotton and \nwheat, and the use of irrigated land for crops other than cotton and wheat, should facilitate an \nincrease in fodder production that will help address current shortages. However, the allocation of \nland remains tightly controlled by local government administrations, and insecurity of land tenure \nis a concern for many farmers. There is also limited knowledge of how to effectively grow, harvest, \nand store feed and fodder, especially silage. \n \n7. \nWeak capacity of aggregators and processors. While aggregators and processors play \nan essential role in the livestock supply chain, they lack capacity to expand physical outreach and \nincrease  the  scale  of  operations  and/or  product  diversification.  The  growth  of  supermarkets  in \nmajor urban centers has promoted the development of processing facilities, notably for milk and \nmilk  products,  although  there  is  limited  access  to  milk  supplies,  processing  and  packaging \ntechnology, and inputs. Increasing the productivity and incomes of small farm producers depends \non their links to processing facilities, either directly or\u2014particularly for milk producers\u2014through a \nnetwork of collection centers. However, many producers have no access to local collection points \nand travel long distances each day to deliver milk to processors. As a result, about two-thirds of \nmilk and dairy products are consumed at home, with the rest sold directly to households or at \nlocal markets. \n \n8. \nSporadic support services. Veterinary services are provided through a combination of \npublic and a limited number of private sector services. In the public sector, the State Committee \nfor Veterinary and Livestock Development is largely responsible for the control of major livestock \ndiseases, but lacks sufficient staff and equipment, notably in its laboratories. The government\u2019s \npolicy  of  shifting  veterinary  services  delivery  to  the  private  sector  is  a  positive  step,  but  the \ntransition process lacks definition, and the pace of change is slow. Small livestock owners and/or \nfarmers, who constitute the majority of livestock producers, continue to lack adequate access to \neffective  veterinary  services.  Livestock  research  and  extension  services  are  under-resourced, \nwith the main state providers facing shortages of skilled staff and modern, appropriate laboratory \nand field equipment. \n \n\n                                                \n7  International Trade Centre. International Trade Statistics 2001\u20132019 (accessed 30 April 2019). Data are based on \n\nthe 4-digit harmonized system, product codes 01 to 05. Data for 2018 are not available. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fLimited access to finance. Limited access to both equity and long-term debt finance for \n9. \nproducers and enterprises along the livestock value chain is a key constraint to the development \nof the subsector. The credit received by the subsector is disproportionately low compared with its \ncontribution to GDP. Aggregate livestock lending accounted for 1% of banks\u2019 loan portfolios in \n2018, while the subsector contributed about 8% of GDP. The limited assets and financial capacity \nof small farmers limits their access to formal financial institutions, forcing them to self-finance or \ndepend on informal sources. Contract farming arrangements with processors have the potential \nto better integrate such farms into the livestock value chain and could facilitate improvement in \nproductivity, both in individual farms and for the subsector as a whole. However, lack of access \nto  long-term  debt  financing  has  prohibited  processors  from  expanding  business  linkages  both \nupstream and downstream. The demand for credit in the livestock subsector is estimated at about \n$3.2 billion for 2019\u20132021.8 \n \n10. \nClimate change. Uzbekistan has a continental, subtropical climate that is arid, with an \nabundance of heat and sunlight, and sharp day\u2013night and winter\u2013summer temperature variations. \nThe number of cattle has increased by about 2.5 times since 1991, which has implications for \nclimate change. Agriculture accounted for 10.7% of total greenhouse gas emissions in Uzbekistan \nin 2018, with livestock contributing through enteric fermentation and animal manure. Changes in \nthe  temperature  regime  will  place  thermal  stress  on  animals,  decreasing  their  immunity  to \ndisease, while changes in animals\u2019 usual living environment will lead to physical overheating or \novercooling. Changes in precipitation will reduce moisture availability and lower fodder crop yields \non rain-fed land and fodder phytomass on pastures. Lack of moisture together with increasing \nanthropogenic  load  will  increase  pressure  on  natural  pastures  and  induce  degradation  and \nabandonment of rain-fed land. Changes in the temperature regime, precipitation amount, and air \nhumidity may stimulate outbursts of plant and animal diseases and the propagation of certain pest \nvarieties.  Increasing  frequency  of  droughts  will  also  reduce  pasture  productivity.  Against  this \nbackdrop,  the  project  design  incorporated  appropriate  adaptation  and  mitigation  measures  to \nminimize  risks  of  reduced  productivity  and  quality  of  fodder  production,  pasture  management, \nlivestock production, and processing.9 \n \n11. \nGovernment strategy. The government\u2019s development priorities include modernization \nand intensive development of agriculture as important priorities,10 including through (i) continuing \nimprovement  of \nstructural \ninfrastructure,  and  development  of  agribusiness;  (iii)  more  productive  land  and  water  use;  (iv) \ngreater financial stability of farm entities; and (v) more market-oriented agricultural policies. The \nlivestock subsector is considered a key driver of agricultural and rural development and several \ngovernment initiatives have given impetus to livestock activities.11 Presidential Decree No. UP-\n5696,  dated  28  March  2019,  acknowledged  that  the  current  situation  in  Uzbekistan\u2019s  regions \nrequires the implementation of specific comprehensive measures to support livestock enterprises, \nincrease  feed  supply,  and  improve  breeding  by  developing  artificial  insemination  and \nstrengthening breeding farms. The feed and fodder constraint is to be addressed specifically by \nallocating land from the reserves of district local administrations for the production of fodder crops. \n \n\nreforms  and  production  diversification; \n\n(ii)  mechanization, \n\n                                                \n8  Estimates provided by the Agency for Implementation of Projects in the Field of Agro-Industry and Food Security, \n\nbased on submissions by regional administrations. \n\n9  Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10 Government  of  Uzbekistan.  2017.  Strategy  of  Actions  for  Further  Development  of  Uzbekistan,  2017\u20132021. \n\nPresidential Decree No. UP-4947. Tashkent. \n\n11 Most recently, Presidential Resolution No. PP-2460 dated 29 December 2015 \u201cOn measures of further reforming and \ndevelopment  of  agriculture  for  period of 2016\u20132020,\u201d  which  defined  targets  for  increases  in  animal  numbers  and \nlivestock product output by 2020. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fADB  and  development  partner  assistance.  ADB  has  provided  significant  support  to \n12. \nagriculture through policy reforms and irrigation and drainage system rehabilitation. Since 2016, \nthrough  PFIs,  ADB  has  supported  private  sector  development  in  agriculture.  The  Horticulture \nValue Chain Development Project (including its additional financing) has significantly increased \naccess to medium- and long-term finance for horticulture value chain strengthening.12 As of July \n2019,  the  loan funds  have almost  been  utilized  due to proper  project  designs  and  appropriate \nimplementation arrangements. The performance of these projects have been rated as \u201con track\u201d. \nAgriculture  is  also  supported  by  the  World  Bank,  the  International  Fund  for  Agriculture \nDevelopment, the European Commission, and the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD). \nThe World Bank has implemented two rural enterprise support projects that included support for \nsmall food-processing enterprises, poultry production, and fisheries. Together with the European \nCommission,  it  is  helping  small  farmers  and  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprises  to  improve \nlivestock production and supply chain management by improving access to finance and extension \nservices. The International  Fund for  Agriculture Development  has  provided  support to  develop \nrural enterprises and strengthen dairy value chains by providing funds for microfinance loans and \nfield extension support. AFD is preparing a project to enhance financial inclusion in the livestock \nsubsector.  The  project  will  support  livestock  policy  reforms,  institutional  development,  and \nincreased access to finance for small farmers through three financing mechanisms: credit through \nPFIs,  and  grants  and  risk-sharing  (partial  guarantee)  for  farmers  without  adequate  collateral. \nThere  is  clear  synergy  with  the  AFD-financed  project,  which  will  provide  access  to  finance  for \nsmall producers to complement contract farming arrangements with processors financed under \nthe proposed project. \n  \n13. \nDespite past and ongoing livestock subsector support, there is significant unmet demand \nfor  long-term  finance  by  medium  and  large  agribusiness  enterprises  to  invest  in  expanding \ncapacity  and  promoting  vertical  and  horizontal  integration  along  the  livestock  value  chain.  In \naddition, there is a critical need to enhance public and private veterinary services to undertake \nrisk assessment, risk management, and control of animal diseases. In this context, the project \ndesign  has  been  coordinated  with  key  development  initiatives  of  the  government  and \ndevelopment partners to complement and optimize synergies with past and ongoing efforts.13 \n \n14. \nLessons and ADB\u2019s value addition. The project design reflects lessons from past and \nongoing projects funded by ADB and development partners in agriculture, livestock, and finance. \nKey lessons call for (i) diversifying away from cotton\u2013wheat crop rotation, (ii) investing in modern \nproduction  systems,  (iii)  designing  projects  based  on  an  analysis  of  agricultural  demand  and \nsocioeconomic  needs,  (iv)  focusing  on  high-impact  stakeholder  segments  that  can  promote \nmarket  linkages,  and (v)  keeping  project  implementation  arrangements  simple.  These  lessons \nalso emphasize the importance of (i) addressing the  entire value chain to ensure cost-efficient \nlogistical  capacity, (ii)  designing financing  programs that  are relevant  to the  size and scope of \npotential  sub-borrowers\u2019  demand,  and  (iii)  applying  a  demand-driven  approach  to  commercial \nfinancing. Together  with ADB\u2019s  assistance  in  horticulture  value  chain development,  the  project \nwill support the implementation of the government\u2019s agricultural diversification strategy, which will \ngenerate higher financial and economic returns, reduce social costs and the fiscal burden, and \nraise  fewer  social  and  environmental  concerns.  In  addition,  enhancing  public  and  private \nveterinary services will significantly enhance the capacity to assess and manage animal health \nand control diseases, which helps minimize risks to human health. \n \n\n                                                \n12 ADB  Uzbekistan.

Women have a prominent role in \n15. \nagricultural  production,  but  they  are  mainly  engaged  in  simple,  nontechnical  work.  In  2018, \nwomen accounted for 52.6% of agricultural workers but farms led by women accounted for only \n5.8%  of  the  total.  While  rural  women  and  female  small  farmers  are  an  important  part  of  the \nlivestock  value  chain,  they  face  difficulties  in  establishing  businesses  and  finding  formal  jobs \nbecause  of  a  lack  of  professional  skills,  access  to  information,  and  finance;  and  limited \nentrepreneurship  and  leadership  skills.  There  is  significant  potential  for  job  creation  and \nentrepreneurship  for  women  in  the  livestock  subsector  if  key  constraints\u2014such  as  access  to \ninputs, support services, finance, information, and training\u2014are addressed. \n \n16. \nAlignment with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and country partnership strategy. The project \nis aligned with the Strategy 2030 operational priority area on promoting rural development and \nfood  security,  which  includes  market  connectivity  and  agricultural  value  chain  linkages, \nagricultural  productivity,  and  food  security  and  safety.14  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy, \n2019\u20132023  for  Uzbekistan  supports  the  country\u2019s  transformation  into  a  modern  industrial  and \nservice  economy  through  sustained  and  inclusive  growth,  reduced  poverty,  and  expanded \nregional cooperation.15 The project is in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2019\u20132021.16 \n \nB. \n \nThe impact will be contribution of agriculture to inclusive economic growth, incomes, and \n17. \nemployment increased (footnote 10). The outcome will be production and marketing of livestock \nproducts increased.17 \n \nC. \n \n18. \nOutput  1:  Access  to  finance  in  the  livestock  subsector  increased.  The  project  will \nprovide  long-term  funds  to  PFIs  to  extend  sub-loans  to  eligible  sub-borrowers  for  capital \ninvestment.  To  be  eligible,  a  sub-borrower  must  be  a  commercial  entity  registered  under  and \ncompliant  with Uzbek  laws  and regulations;  must  not  be  a  PFI-related  party  as defined by the \nCentral  Bank  of  Uzbekistan  (CBU);  and  must  have  a  maximum  asset  value  of  $50  million \nequivalent  at  the  time  of  the  application  for  a  sub-loan.  Investment  subprojects  will  include \nlivestock production, marketing, processing, input supply, and service delivery.18 The project will \nimprove  access  to  market-based  bank  finance  for  producers,  processing  enterprises,  input \nsuppliers, and service providers in the livestock value chain. As such, it will help increase livestock \nproductivity and sustainability, processing capacity and  utilization, and marketing of inputs and \nlivestock products. \n \n19. \nOutput  2:  Support  services  to  the  livestock  subsector  improved.

The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; an interest rate of 2% per year during the grace period and thereafter; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements.20 Sub-borrowers will \ncontribute $56.15 million as equity contribution for the loan-financed subprojects. The government \nwill contribute $31.30 million, comprising $22.46 million through exemptions of taxes and duties \nfor imported goods, and $8.84 million for interest charges during implementation.21 The loan will \nfinance sub-loans, capacity building, and project management office operations. The summary \nfinancing plan is in Table 2 and further detailed in the project administration manual (PAM).22 \n \n\n                                                \n20 ADB will finance taxes and duties of $0.07 million related to project management.

Sub-\nloan  repayment may  be in US  dollars  and/or  local  currency  subject  to  sub-borrowers\u2019  demand \nand  subprojects\u2019  revenue  streams,  as  well  as  specific  agreements  between  PFIs  and  sub-\nborrowers. Sub-loans extended by PFIs will have a tenor of up to 10 years. PFIs will determine \nthe creditworthiness of sub-borrowers and assume the full credit risk. The maximum sub-loan size \nwill be $5 million based on an assessment of past and prospective demand of PFIs\u2019 clients. \n \n25. \nParticipating  financial  institutions.  PFIs  were  selected  from  among  the  domestic \ncommercial banks participating in the Horticulture Value Chain Development Project (footnote 12) \nand  those  that  expressed  interest  in  participating  in  the  project.  ADB  conducted  detailed  due \ndiligence on the five banks it selected to participate as PFIs (footnote 24). A portion of loan funds \nhas  been  reserved  for  competitive  withdrawal  by  these  and  additional  commercial  banks  that \ncomplete the due diligence process. PFIs for the most part are in compliance with CBU prudential \nregulations  and  meet  ADB\u2019s  eligibility  requirements  for  financial  intermediaries  and  ADB-\ndetermined financial covenants.26 To address areas of minor noncompliance, PFIs will be required \nto satisfy disbursement conditions and to implement action plans for financial covenants. \n \n\n                                                \n23 Climate finance was calculated based on the estimated demand for sub-loans by financing category. The mitigation \ncost is based on the investment cost of chilling facilities and better practices in animal husbandry, while the adaptation \ncost of $45 million is based on the investment cost of processing facilities.  \n\n24 Based on each PFI\u2019s absorptive capacity, and subject to review and adjustment during project implementation, the \ntentative allocation of loan proceeds is currently set as follows: Microcreditbank ($10 million), Qishloq Qurilish Bank \n($30 million), Turonbank ($50 million), Uzpromstroybank ($10 million), and Xalq Bank ($30 million). An amount of \n$16 million is reserved for competitive withdrawal and/or new PFI accreditation. \n\n25 The government will charge the interest on the ADB loan plus 1.0% per year to the PFIs. PFI interest rates carry the \n\ncost for (i) loan origination, (ii) provision of foreign exchange, and (iii) credit risk and related charges. \n\n26 ADB. 2003. Financial Intermediation Loans.

It  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  reviewing  and  monitoring \nsubproject  implementation,  (ii)  overseeing  project  financial  audits,  and  (iii)  implementing \nveterinary services and the capacity development activities of PFIs. AIFSA will recruit technical \nexperts  to  support  PFIs  in  developing  livestock  lending  credit  policies  and  procedures,  credit \nproducts,  and  outreach  strategy.  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  Microcreditbank,  Qishloq \nQurilish Bank, Turonbank,  Uzpromstroybank, Xalq Bank,  and other  PFIs meeting the  eligibility \nrequirements.27 The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in \ndetail in the PAM. \n \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated loan closing date \nManagement \n\n(i)  Executing agency \n(ii) Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\n(iii) Implementation units \n\nProcurementa \n\nConsulting servicesa \n\nDisbursement \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \n\nJanuary 2020\u2013December 2024 \n31 December 2024 \n30 June 2025 \n\nAIFSA \nPFIs: Microcreditbank, Qishloq Qurilish Bank, Turonbank, \nUzpromstroybank, and Xalq Bank \nProject management office in AIFSA; project implementation units in PFIs \nOCB \n$300,000 \nRFQ \n$117,418 \nQCBS \n$1,534,394 \nLCS \n$172,862 \nLoan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and arrangements \nagreed between the Government of Uzbekistan and ADB. \n\n1 contract \n3 contracts \n3 contracts (110 person-months) \n2 contracts (40 person-months) \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, AIFSA = Agency for Implementation of Projects in the Field of Agro-industry and \nFood Security, LCS = least-cost selection; OCB = open competitive bidding; PFI = participating financial institution; \nQCBS = quality- and cost-based selection; RFQ = request for quotation. \na  AIFSA will procure goods and consulting services related to capacity development and project management following \n\nthe ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time). \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n27. \nBy addressing the constraints of limited access to long-term finance and weak veterinary \nservices, the project will help increase productivity in livestock production activities; and improve \nthe  capacity  and  efficiency  of  production,  processing,  and  marketing  enterprises.  This  will \nincrease the volume and enhance the quality of Uzbek livestock produce for domestic and export \nmarkets,  and  minimize  imports.  An  analysis  of  indicative  investments  indicates  that  livestock \nproduction and agribusiness investments generate financial internal rates of return of 14%\u201332%, \nand their economic internal rates of return are 19%\u201323%, suggesting such investments are viable. \n \n28. \nThe five proposed PFIs have experience in agricultural lending and have varying levels of \nagricultural  loan  portfolios.  They  have  all  been  assessed  as  financially  sound.  Financial \nprojections for the project implementation period indicate that the PFIs will continue to perform \n\n                                                \n27 The executing agency and each implementing agency will enter into separate project agreements with ADB. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nwell and comply with CBU regulations and ADB loan financial covenants. The maximum value of \nproject-financed  sub-loans  is  projected  at  0.3%\u201313.1%  of  PFIs\u2019  gross  loan  portfolios  during \nproject  implementation  in  2020\u20132024.  Borrowing  under  the  project  is,  therefore,  within  the \nabsorptive capacity of each PFI.28 \n \nB. \n \n29. \nEach PFI underwent financial and integrity due diligence. The overall pre-mitigation risk \nfor financial management is moderate while the integrity risk is low to medium and the project-\nspecific  procurement  risk  is  low.  An  action  plan  has  been  prepared  by  each  PFI  to  address \nfinancial management issues and these will be implemented by the first quarter of 2020. Financial \nmanagement  and  procurement  capacity  assessment  of  AIFSA,  the  executing  agency,  did  not \nidentify  any  issues  that would adversely  affect  its  project  management  role,  and no significant \nintegrity  risks  were  identified.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  AIFSA,  and  PFIs.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nC. \n \n30. \nThe project supports poverty reduction indirectly by enhancing the linkages between small \nproducers  and  markets.  By  providing  increased  and  stable  market  opportunities  for  small \nproducers, the project will help increase job opportunities and rural incomes. Enhancing efficiency \nand downstream functionality in the livestock value chain will bring significant benefits to small \nproducers,  the  majority  of  whom  are  low-income.  The  project  is  classified  effective  gender \nmainstreaming.  Two  main  gender  constraints  are  lack  of  access  to  finance  for  women-owned \nenterprises and limited entrepreneurship. The project gender action plans include increasing PFIs\u2019 \noutreach,  ensuring  that  livestock-related  subprojects  financed  by  PFIs\u2019  sub-loans  prioritize  the \nemployment  of  female  workers,  and  implementing  capacity  and  leadership  development \nactivities.29  ADB  conducted  due  diligence  and  confirmed  that  the  livestock  subsector  complies \nwith core labor standards. \n \nD. \n \n31. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \ncategories  are  as follows:  financial  intermediation  (treated  as  category  B) for the  environment, \nand category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples.30 Subprojects identified in \nADB\u2019s  Prohibited  Investment  Activities  List  in  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  that  are \nclassified  category  A  for  the  environment,  and  category  A  or  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement  or  indigenous  peoples  are  not  eligible  for  project  financing.  In  addition,  eligible \nsubprojects  will  comply  with  applicable  national  regulations.  ADB  carried  out  due  diligence  of \nPFIs\u2019 environmental and social management systems (ESMSs).31 All PFIs must have an ESMS \nthat satisfies ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement prior to their first sub-loan disbursement. \n \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n28 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy,  and  Gender  Action  Plan  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n30 ADB.
