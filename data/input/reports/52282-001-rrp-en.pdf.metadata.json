The report also describes the proposed administration of a loan to be \nprovided by  the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) for the Geothermal Power Generation Project, 1 \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the administration of the CTF loan. \n \n2. \nThe project will support the expansion of Indonesia\u2019s geothermal generating capacity to \ncontribute to the sustainability, resiliency, and sufficiency of the electricity system. It is aligned \nwith  the  following  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs):  SDG  7  on  access  to  affordable, \nreliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all and SDG 13 on urgent action to combat climate \nchange  and  its  impacts.  The  project  will  support  GDE,  a  state-owned  geothermal  company \nfocused  on  the  development  and  use  of  geothermal  resources,  to  commission  an  additional \n110 megawatts  (MW)  of  geothermal  electricity  generating  capacity\u201455  MW  at  the  Dieng \ngeothermal field in Central Java and 55 MW at the Patuha geothermal field in West Java.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nSector status and projections. The Electricity Power Supply Business Plan, 2019\u20132028 \n(RUPTL)  of  the  State  Electricity  Corporation  (PLN)  projects  demand  for  electricity  to  grow  to \n112.2 gigawatts  (GW)  in  2028.3  As  of  December  2018,  Indonesia\u2019s  total  power  generation \ncapacity was about 65 GW, of which 41 GW was owned by PLN, 15 GW  was contracted from \nindependent power producers, and 9 GW was from captive power generators. More than half of \nIndonesia\u2019s current power generating capacity uses coal; if this continues, it will be challenging \nfor  Indonesia  to  meet  its  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emission  reduction  target  of  29%  by  2030 \ncompared with business as usual.4 Part of the contribution to Indonesia\u2019s climate mitigation target \nwill come from renewable energy capacity contributions to total electricity generation, for which \nthe RUPTL sets a target of 23.2% in 2028, up from 11.4% in 2019. In addition to climate benefits, \nincreasing renewable energy\u2019s share in the power mix will improve air quality, the adverse impacts \nof which disproportionately impact the poor, making them more vulnerable to other stressors.  \n \nGeothermal  energy  strategy  and  challenges.  Geothermal  energy  is  one  of  the  few \n4. \nrenewable  energy  technologies  that  can  provide  baseload  power  and  improve  power  system \nreliability, making it a valuable complement to variable renewable energy such as wind and solar \npower. Indonesia has the world\u2019s largest geothermal potential, estimated at 29 GW and has the \nsecond  largest  installed  capacity  after  the  United  States.  The  government  has  prioritized \n\n \n\n1  The  CTF  is  a  funding  window  for  the  Climate  Investment  Funds  that  provides  middle-income  and  developing \ncountries with resources to scale up the demonstration, deployment, and transfer of low-carbon, clean technologies. \n\n2  These are net generating capacities. \n3  Government  of  Indonesia.  2019.  Keputusan  Menteri  ESDM  No  39/K/20/MEM/2019  Rencana  Usaha  Penyediaan \ntentang Listrik (RUPTL) 2019\u20132028 (Decree of the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources No. 39 / K / 20 / MEM \n/ 2019 concerning Electricity Supply Business Plans (RUPTL) 2019\u20132028). Jakarta. \n\n4  Indonesia\u2019s Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contributions  under  the  Paris  Agreement  include reducing GHGs  by \n29% by 2030 (up to 41% with international support) and call for integrating resilience measures in all development \nplans  and  projects,  given  the  country\u2019s  vulnerability  to  hydro-meteorological  hazards,  which  are  exacerbated  by \nclimate change. Priority resilience measures include securing energy, food, water, social welfare, and livelihoods by \ndeveloping renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and climate-resilient infrastructure. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ngeothermal since enactment of the Geothermal Law in 2003, but development has been slow to \ntake off. Development rights have been allocated for geothermal working areas with an estimated \naggregate potential of 4.4 GW. Of these, private sector developers hold the development rights \nfor  2.4  GW  and  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  hold  the  rights  for  2.0  GW.  As  of  mid-2019, \nIndonesia had reached only 1.9 GW of installed geothermal capacity, which is less than half of \nthe allocated rights and significantly short of the targeted 7.2 GW by 2025 (footnote 3). \n \n5. \nTo  reach  the  required  scale,  the  private  sector  must  play  a  strong  role  in  geothermal \ndevelopment.  Indonesia  has  had  some  success  with  private  sector-led  geothermal  projects, \nincluding those supported by the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Private Sector Operations \nDepartment.5  However,  many  privately  held  concession  areas  have  not  advanced  because  of \nenvironmental,  social,  or  fiscal  issues,  and  private  sector  interest  in  recent  tenders  has  been \nmodest.  A  variety  of  challenges  face  the  sector,  including  the  costly,  lengthy,  and  high-risk \nexploration phase; unstable policy environment; and an often-unfavorable tariff regime. Private \nsector interest and available financing is now further challenged by uncertainties arising from the \nglobal pandemic, with an unclear timeline for investor appetite to return.  \n \n6. \nDevelopment  partners  are  supporting  the  government  to  establish  a  more  conducive \npolicy  environment  for  geothermal  development.  ADB  has  been  an  active  participant  in  these \nefforts,  in  particular  through  the  recent  policy-based  lending  program.6  To  reduce  the  up-front \nrisks associated with geothermal exploration, the government is implementing a new risk-sharing \nmechanism  for  the  project  initiation  phase,  funded  by  the  World  Bank  and  the  Green  Climate \nFund. As part of this program, the government will fund exploratory drilling for geothermal working \nareas  that  can  subsequently  be  tendered.  The  updated  geothermal  regulation  allows  for \ngreenfield geothermal working areas to be assigned to SOEs if the tender process fails.7 Legacy \nprojects  where both  private and public  sector developers have grandfathered  power  purchase \nagreements (PPAs) are expected to proceed under the agreed mechanism and ownership.    \n \nHistory and planned developments of PT Geo Dipa Energi. GDE was formed in 2002 \n7. \nas a joint venture company of Pertamina, the state-owned oil and gas corporation, and PLN to \nmanage and develop the geothermal working areas at Dieng and Patuha, which are among the \n2 GW of working areas allocated for SOE development. GDE negotiated a PPA with PLN in 2004 \nfor  both  sites,  covering  the  generation  of  up  to  400  MW  at  each.  In  2011,  the  government \nreorganized  GDE  from  a  joint  venture to a  limited  liability  company  and took  over  the  67%  of \nshares  owned  by  Pertamina.  Government  equity  injections  have  increased  its shareholding  to \n93.3%, while PLN holds 6.7%. GDE operates a 55 MW power plant at Dieng (Dieng Unit 1) and \na 55 MW power plant at Patuha (Patuha Unit 1). It started operations by recommissioning Dieng \nUnit  1,  which  was  initially  commissioned  by  the  private  sector  and  then  turned  over  to  the \ngovernment  after  the  1997  Asian \nfinancial  crisis.  GDE  subsequently  constructed  and \ncommissioned Patuha Unit 1 in 2014, which is fed by previously drilled wells. Under the proposed \nproject, GDE plans to commission additional units at Dieng and Patuha (Dieng Unit 2 and Patuha \nUnit  2).  These are  government  priority  projects  (according  to  the  Regulation of  the  Ministry of \nEnergy and Mineral Resources No. 40  [2014]) and PLN will purchase the electricity generated \n\n \n\n5  ADB.  2018.

Separate  from  this  project,  GDE  will  conduct  exploratory  drilling  on \nbehalf of the government, under the new risk-sharing program (para. 6), for sites to be tendered. \nIn addition, GDE will develop geothermal sites for which it holds the development rights in areas \nthat are less attractive to private investment because of environmental and social risks. \n \n8. \nThe  project  will  add  renewable  energy  baseload  generation  in  Java  by  expanding \ngeothermal power generation to reduce Indonesia\u2019s reliance on coal. It will contribute to reaching \nIndonesia\u2019s renewable energy targets and reducing GHG emissions in Indonesia and globally. \nJava has the country\u2019s largest electricity demand but is the most challenging for renewable energy \nbecause of low average generating costs from low-cost coal-based electricity generation, against \nwhich renewable energy must compete.8 The project will support capacity development of GDE, \nincluding  increased  knowledge  of  geothermal  reservoir  performance,  contract  and  project \nmanagement,  and  social  and  environmental  impact  minimization  and  management\u2014all  with \ngender and climate resilience considerations. It will also support GDE to enhance its community \ndevelopment  programs  to  be  more  strategic  in  responding  to  community  needs,  including \nwomen\u2019s  needs.  The  strong  emphasis  on  environmental  and  social  risk  assessment  and \nmanagement reflects lessons learned from previous energy sector projects in Indonesia, where \nsuch issues have impeded efficient and sustainable project development. The enhancement of \nGDE\u2019s institutional capacity will better equip it to undertake government-supported drilling to bring \nin the necessary private sector investment and set a proven standard for safeguard management, \nincluding for geothermal areas to be newly developed. \n  \n9. \nAlignment. The project is aligned with Indonesia\u2019s long-term goals for economic growth \nand  energy  as  articulated  in  the  Draft  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  (RPJMN), \n2020\u2013 2024  and  the  National  Energy  Policy.9,10  These  goals  include  maximizing  the  use  of \nindigenous energy resources, diversifying the fuel mix, and ensuring environmental sustainability. \nADB\u2019s energy sector support, as outlined in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Indonesia, is \naligned  with  these  long-term  goals,  with  a  focus  on  policy  reforms,  developing  sustainable \nelectricity generation, and grid investments.11 The project is also aligned with several operational \npriorities of Strategy 2030 (Table 1).12 \n \n\nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \n\nProject\u2019s Contributions \n\nSupport increased use of low greenhouse gas-emitting electricity \ngeneration in line with the government\u2019s international commitments. \nAdopt an eco-sensitive and climate-resilient approach to project \nplanning and implementation. \nStrengthen GDE\u2019s capacity to conduct competitive procurement and \npromote enhanced financial management capabilities. \nIncorporate proactive gender designs in human resources practices \nand community engagement and development activities. \n\nStrategy 2030 Priorities \nTackling climate change, \nbuilding climate and disaster \nresilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability \nStrengthening governance \nand institutional capacity \nAccelerating progress in \ngender equality \n\nGDE = PT Geo Dipa Energi. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n8   The 2018, average kWh power costs in West and Central Java, the location of the proposed projects, was 6.91 US \n\ncents, as compared to 17.58-21.28 US cents in Flores, another region with active geothermal development.  \n\n9  Government  of  Indonesia.

While the project was planned before the coronavirus pandemic, it \nwas negotiated after  its  onset,  clearly  signaling the  government\u2019s  sustained  commitment to  its \nclimate ambitions. Engagement from the ADB in the project at this juncture is critical, as Indonesia \naddresses  the  pandemic\u2019s  impact  on  the  economy.  Institutions  such  as  the  International \nRenewable  Energy  Agency,13  and  the  International  Energy  Agency  have  called  for  post-\ncoronavirus investments to  ensure a climate-conscious recovery.14 ADB\u2019s intervention will help \nmake a clean energy transition a key part of Indonesia\u2019s recovery, and the project will provide \njobs  for  those  supplying goods and  services  for  the  geothermal, oil, and  gas  industries,  which \nhave been impacted by the drop in oil demand due to quarantine conditions. \n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) contribution to geothermal energy in \nIndonesian power supply increased (footnote 3), and (ii) renewable energy in electricity subsector \nincreased.15 The project will have the following outcome: adequacy and sustainability of energy \nsupply increased.16 \n \n12. \nOutput 1: Geothermal power plants constructed and commissioned. The project will \nsupport  GDE  in  constructing  and  commissioning  a  55  MW  geothermal  power  plant  at  Dieng, \nCentral Java Province (Dieng Unit 2) and a 55 MW geothermal power plant at Patuha, West Java \nprovince (Patuha Unit 2). Both Dieng Unit 2 and Patuha Unit 2 will include (i) the drilling of new \nwells for the production and reinjection of reservoir fluids, and (ii) the construction of an above-\nground steam gathering system and fluid reinjection lines connecting  the wells and generating \nunits. Patuha  Unit  2  will  be a  single-flash power  plant,  and  Dieng  Unit 2  will  be  a geothermal \ncombined cycle plant.17 The project will also support the transmission interconnection systems \nbetween  the  plants  and  the  grid.  At  Dieng,  this  will  include  the  commissioning  of  a  new, \n6- kilometer underground transmission line to the Dieng substation. Existing lines and towers will \nbe  used  to  connect  Patuha  Unit  2  to  the  Patuha  substation,  but  the  project  will  include  the \ninstallation of a new transformer at the existing substation. \n \n13. \nOutput  2:  Institutional  capacity  of  GDE  strengthened.  The  project  will  strengthen \nGDE\u2019s  capacity  to  plan  for,  develop,  and  operate  geothermal  power  plants,  including  the \nmanagement of complex technical conditions and multiple contracts with coordinated activities. \nThis  will  be  done  through  gender-responsive  training  programs,  organized  by  the  loan \nconsultants, on reservoir management and procurement; and on-the-job training, supported by \nthe project management consultant (PMC), on meeting ADB procurement, financial management, \nand reporting requirements. GDE will also increase its ability to manage environmental and social \nrisks by implementing a revised environmental management system (EMS), which will incorporate \ngender, climate, and community safety considerations. \n \n\n \n\n13  International Renewable Energy Agency. 2020.

Jakarta.   \n16 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n17 The wells will produce reservoir fluids that are a mixture of steam and water. In a single-flash steam power plant, the \nsteam is separated and used as the working fluid for the power plant, while the water is unused and reinjected in the \nreservoir along with the condensate from the steam cycle. In a combined cycle plant, the steam and water are still \nseparated, but the heat energy from the steam is used twice, and the heat energy from the water is used once before \nreinjection. The steam will first go through a steam turbine, after which it will go through a heat exchanger where the \nresidual heat in the steam will be transferred to an organic fluid that will power another turbine. The water will also \ngo through a heat exchanger, where the heat is transferred to an organic fluid that will power another turbine.  \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fValue Added by ADB  \n\nOutput 3: Community development program enhanced. The project will support the \n14. \nenhancement  of  GDE\u2019s  Community  Development  Program.18  This  will  begin  with  the \nimplementation of a gender-responsive stakeholder communication strategy,19 which will involve \n(i) increased outreach and education on the project and its impacts; and (ii) information gathering \non  the  communities\u2019  challenges,  including  the  differential  needs  and  experiences  of  men  and \nwomen.  Improved  communication  will  help address  misperceptions  around  the  existing power \nplants and planned development; this is particularly important at Dieng, where communities live \nand farm close to the project sites. Based on community feedback on key challenges and needs, \nthe community development program will refocus on actions that will contribute most meaningfully \nto the improved well-being of the men and women in the project communities, e.g., a stronger \nemphasis on  alternative  livelihood  opportunities and addressing challenges  such  as  access  to \neducation  (through  scholarships),  water  strain,  and  declining  agricultural  production.  The \nimproved  communication  and  more  strategic  focus  of  programs  to  benefit  neighboring \ncommunities will strengthen their relationship with GDE and their support for the project. The PMC \nwill also develop a feasibility study for a geothermal direct-use project, such as use of geothermal \nheat for drying of agricultural products or heating dwellings for tourism homestays, which could \nprovide enhanced livelihood opportunities for community members. This direct-use project could \nbe implemented as part of the Community Development Program, in parallel with the development \nof Dieng Unit 3. \n \nC. \n \n15. \nADB\u2019s  engagement  in  this  project  supports  strengthened  governance  and  institutional \ncapacity of GDE, an SOE that can play a catalytic role in the next wave of geothermal expansion \nin  Indonesia.  GDE  will  gain  experience  in  project  and  contract  management,  particularly \ncompetitive tendering and effective management of multiple synchronous contracts (para. 26), \nwhich will be necessary as it undertakes future exploratory drilling for the government and will act \nas  benchmarks  for  evaluation  of  IPP  proposals.  ADB\u2019s  engagement  during  the  design  phase \nresulted in GDE adopting design changes to address operational challenges experienced at the \nexisting facilities and introducing best international practice design (para. 21) and sustainability \nplanning  (para.  24).  The  project  design  will  minimize  environmental,  climate,  and  social  risks, \nwhile  ADB\u2019s  sustained  engagement  will  support  GDE  to  manage  residual  risks.  ADB  will  also \nsupport  GDE  to  (i)  ensure  gender-sensitive  approaches  in  its  human  resources  and \ncommunication activities and (ii) enhance its community development program to meet the needs \nof the communities suffering  from overreliance on agricultural activities and  challenges  caused \nby water strain. GDE\u2019s increased experience in designing and developing projects that minimize \nsocial and environmental risks and maximize social and gender benefits will provide a model for \ngeothermal projects in Indonesia that could be adopted by both private- and SOE-led geothermal \nprojects. This ADB support  through and after the global pandemic contributes to a sustainable \nand resilient economic recovery.  \n  \nD. \n \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $469.20  million  (Table  2).

Numerical modeling of the reservoirs \ndemonstrates the capacity to supply steam to the existing and additional plants for their design \nlife. The steam turbine technology to be used for Patuha Unit 2 is based on technology that has \nbeen in use for decades, and is similar to that of Patuha Unit 1, which has been in operation for \nabout 5 years. Several international manufacturers are capable of supplying power plants to the \nrequired level of quality and reliability. The steam system supplying the new plant will be designed \nto the same operating conditions as the existing plant to provide operational flexibility. \n \n\n21 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\nThe existing  plant  at  Dieng  (Dieng  Unit 1)  has  had operational  challenges,  resulting  in \n22. \nsignificant mineral deposition in production and reinjection wells, surface piping, and the plant. As \na result, the operations of Dieng Unit 1 have been affected, and, at times, the plant has only been \nable to operate at about 50% of its rated capacity. Studies undertaken during the feasibility study \nphase have  concluded  that  the  traditional  steam  turbine-based  plant and  operating  conditions \nselected for Dieng Unit 1 were not appropriate. The Dieng Unit 2 expansion will be based on a \nplant configuration known as a geothermal combined cycle plant, which consists of a conventional \nsteam turbine and an Organic Rankine Cycle plant\u2014extracting energy from both steam and liquid \nbrine  streams  produced  from  the  reservoir.  Combined  cycle  plants  of  this  type  have  been \noperating in a number of geothermal projects for more than 30 years and are well proven in this \nenvironment.  In  addition  to  offering  Dieng  improved  performance  and  reliability,  the  combined \ncycle plant will offer improved thermal efficiency compared with the  technology used for  Dieng \nUnit 1. The operation of the brine disposal system to be used for Dieng Unit 2 will be new to GDE \nand will require training in both operation and maintenance to be successful. Various  programs \nare planned to train GDE staff (Output 2), starting with a training program as part of pilot plant \ntrials, which will be undertaken in 2020 to confirm plant design parameters. \n \nB. \n \n23. \nThe project\u2019s economic viability was assessed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nthe  Economic  Analysis of Projects.22  A  with- and without-project  framework  was adopted, and \neconomic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  of  Patuha  Unit  2  and  Dieng  Unit  2  were  measured \nagainst an assumed hurdle rate of 9.0%, and the sensitivity to adverse changes in the underlying \nassumptions was also assessed. Each subproject is economically viable, and the combined EIRR \nis  13.0%,  which  exceeds  the  economic  hurdle  rate.  Economic  benefits  are  derived  from  the \nincremental and non-incremental output of the geothermal plants to meet additional demand and \ndisplace thermal generation. The basis for the valuation of these benefits was the consumers\u2019 \nwillingness to pay and the avoided cost of thermal fuel stock. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates \nthat the expected economic performance is robust. \n \n24. \nThe Project is financially viable, with a financial internal rate of return of  5.8%, which is \nhigher than the 2.3% (real) weighted average cost of capital. A sensitivity analysis  showed the \nproject to be robust with the financial internal rate of return exceeding the weighted average cost \nof capital under all scenarios, including a 20.0% increase in capital costs.23 However, with the \ncurrent tariff in the PPA, the project would not be viable under commercial financing terms. \n \nC. \n \n25. \nProject planning has considered the actions and resources required to sustain the project \noutcome throughout the project life. At the technical level, these include planning for additional \ninvestments, such as drilling of makeup production wells during operation and capacity building \nfor GDE in geothermal reservoir management. Significant additional efforts are also under way to \nstrengthen  institutional  capacity.  GDE  has  done  a  staffing  analysis  in  planning  for  the \nestablishment of the project management unit to ensure that sufficient permanent staff are hired \nto support  the operations  of the power plants  after  commissioning.  In addition,  the  capacity of \nboth the project management unit and corporate staff in financial management, procurement and \ncontract  management,  and  overall  project  management  will  be  strengthened.  The  project  is \nassessed as financially viable and is expected to generate strong positive cash flows to support \n\nSustainability \n\n \n22 ADB. 2017.

Therefore,  the  project  will \npositively  contribute  to  GDE\u2019s  long-term  financial  sustainability.  The  project  design  has \nincorporated adaptation measures to address identified climate vulnerabilities and the project will \ncontribute to climate change mitigation over the project\u2019s life (footnote 21). \n \nD. \n \n26. \nGDE  has  limited  experience  of  managing  externally  financed  projects  and  will  require \nsignificant support from the PMC to implement the project. GDE is still enhancing its procurement \nand contract management capacity and will benefit from the formal training programs and on-the-\njob training provided by the PMC. Enhancement of GDE\u2019s financial management, procurement, \nand  contract  management  capacity  will  help  GDE  in  executing  this  and  future  projects.  ADB \nsupport to strengthen GDE\u2019s capacity in these areas is consistent with the government\u2019s efforts \nto promote good corporate governance, transparency, and accountability across SOEs. \n \n27. \nGDE developed standard procurement procedures following those of PLN and carried out \nfit-for-purpose  procurement \nstrategic  procurement  planning  to  ensure  that  appropriate, \napproaches  achieve  value  for  money  and  the  project\u2019s  development  objectives.  Contract \npackaging of drilling works reflects the most appropriate contract sizes and procurement methods, \nin line with the strategic priorities of GDE to meet the project schedule and to lower the dispute \nrisk among contractors and suppliers during drilling operations. The market assessment confirms \nan adequate number of international and national suppliers. Contractors for geothermal power \nplant projects in Indonesia are international and national companies. \n \nThe  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n28. \nTechnical Guidance Note on Financial Management Assessment,24 and Financial Due Diligence: \nA  Methodology  Note.25  The  assessed  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is  substantial \nmainly because of the untested capacity of GDE\u2019s finance and accounting staff to manage the \nproject\u2019s  scale  and  complexity,  the  absence  of  a  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate  risk \nmanagement policy, GDE\u2019s unaudited corporate financial model, and inexperience in borrowing \nfrom  and  reporting  to  multilateral  development  banks.  However,  GDE  has  strong  oversight, \nsupported by a clear legislative framework, an internal audit function with direct reporting to the \nboard  of  commissioners,  policy  and  procedure  manuals  for  all  financial  operations,  and \ncomprehensive enterprise resource planning software. GDE has agreed to implement an action \nplan  with  key measures  to  address the  identified  risks,  which  will  be a  first  step  in  building  its \ncapacity to borrow on a commercial basis.  \n \n29. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and  GDE.

This  can  create  better  income-generating  opportunities  for  poor  households. \nGiven  that  higher-value  income  generation  hinges  on  the  use  of  electricity,  the  project's \ncontribution  to  reliable  and  stable  electricity  supply  will  support  economic  activities  for  large \nindustries, small and medium-sized enterprises, and households and community-level facilities \n(e.g., clinics, schools); and provide increased opportunities for employment in project areas. The \nproject will also create substantial domestic employment opportunities for skilled labor.  \n \n31. \nThe project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan has been \ndeveloped  based  on  a  gender  analysis  and  community  consultations.27  The  plan  includes \nmeasures  to ensure  that  long-term  benefits accrue  to  both  women  and men:  (i) increased  job \nopportunities for women with both contractors and GDE, (ii) participation of women in capacity-\nbuilding  activities  and  the  incorporation  of  gender  responsiveness  in  corporate  plans  and \nstrategies,  (iii)  implementation  of  an  enhanced  livelihood  program  for  women  in  surrounding \ncommunities and a commitment to direct a portion of the community development program budget \nto support women\u2019s livelihoods and scholarships, and (iv) development of a direct-use geothermal \nstrategy that maximizes opportunities for women and youth. \n \nG. \n \n32. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \ncategories  are  as  follows.28  All  safeguard  documents  were  prepared  based  on  meaningful \nconsultations with affected persons and communities, endorsed by GDE, and disclosed on the \nADB website in accordance with ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy.  \n \n33. \nEnvironment (category B). Initial environmental examination reports were prepared for \nthe  proposed  facilities  in  Dieng  and  Patuha.29  These  reports,  supplemented  by  independent \nstudies,30 conclude that the project will extend existing facilities located in built-up and agricultural \nareas  and  is  not  anticipated  to  result  in  impacts  that  are  significant  or  unprecedented.  During \nconstruction,  localized  temporary  direct  impacts  will  include  ground  surface  disturbances, \nincreased  dust  and  noise  levels, occupational  and  community health  safety  risks,  a  significant \ntemporary  increase  in  water  usage  for  well  drilling,  temporary  traffic  disturbance,  and  waste \ndisposal.  These  and  other  impacts  will  be  mitigated  through  measures  presented  in  the \nenvironmental management plans (EMPs). Biodiversity action plans prepared for both sites have \nidentified measures to avoid and mitigate adverse impacts on  the natural habitat and important \necology. Facility operation  is not expected  to  cause  significant adverse  impacts.  Noise  and air \nquality  impact  forecasts  confirm  compliance  with  relevant  ambient  air  quality  standards  at  the \nnearest sensitive receptors. Significant incremental operational and community safety risks are \nnot anticipated. An independent assessment confirmed that both facilities have  a certified EMS \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\n27 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 ADB.

These  systems  will  be \nextended to the new facilities to be supported by the project. Minor gaps identified in the current \nEMS  at  existing  well  pads  and  the  steam  above-ground  gathering  system  will  be  addressed \nthrough a corrective action plan, which is included in the EMP. \n \n34. \nGDE  will  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the  EMP  and  has \ncommitted to provide adequate environmental management capacity, both at its head office  and \nthe two site offices in Dieng and Patuha. Community members will observe  the environmental \nsampling  activities  of  licensed  third-party  laboratories.  Consultation  with  stakeholders  and \naffected  persons  was  carried  out  during  project  preparation  and  will  be  continued  during \nimplementation. Project-related complaints will be addressed in a timely manner through a  joint \nsocial  and  environmental  safeguards  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM).  The  GRM  will  be \ncoordinated by the GDE head office, and GDE will have GRM coordinators at the site offices. \n \n35. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). The social impact assessment at Dieng Unit 2 \nidentified  a  total  of  106  persons  (29  households)  that  will  be  directly  affected  and  four  lease \ncoordinators (21 persons), who manage the farmers\u2019 leases, that will be indirectly affected by the \nproject. The resettlement plan documents the assessed impacts and mitigation measures.32 Of \nthe affected persons at Dieng, 86 are considered to be severely affected by the project and 47 are \nconsidered  vulnerable.  No  significant  changes  to  land  requirements  are  expected  during  the \nconstruction of Dieng Unit 2, but any changes will be reflected in an updated resettlement plan. \nPatuha  Unit  2  will  be  built  mostly  within  GDE\u2019s  existing  premises  but  requires  an  additional \n7.2 hectares (ha) of land. Some of this (2.6 ha) is located in a forest area that is not used by the \ncommunity.  GDE  is  processing a  forestry  land use  permit  for  this  land  and  will  be  required  to \nprovide  forestry  land  replacement.  Once  identified,  GDE  will  prepare  a  resettlement  plan  in \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  for  this  forestry  land  replacement.  The \nremaining 4.6 ha required for Patuha Unit 2 is within a tea plantation area, and GDE is processing \na  lease  extension  to  secure  its  use.  The  Patuha  Unit  2  due  diligence  report  documents  the \nassessments  and  mitigation  measures.33  The  PMC  will  increase  GDE  knowledge  on  social \nsafeguards during project  implementation  to  ensure  smooth  and  effective  application  of  social \nsafeguards. \n \n36. \nIndigenous peoples (category  C). The due diligence confirmed that the project is not \nexpected  to  have  any  impact  on  indigenous  peoples,  as  project  sites  are  not  in  areas  with \nprevalent indigenous communities. It will not directly or indirectly affect the dignity, human rights, \nlivelihood systems, or culture of indigenous peoples or affect the territories of natural or cultural \nresources that indigenous peoples own, use, occupy, or claim as their ancestral domain. \n \nH. \n \n37. \nThe  overall  project  risk  is  moderate.
