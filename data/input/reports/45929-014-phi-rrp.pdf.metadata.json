I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity  investment  of  the  Philippine  peso  equivalent,  as  of  the  subscription  date,  of  up  to \n$25,000,000 in the Philippine Investment Alliance for Infrastructure (PINAI) Fund, not to exceed \n25% of the fund\u2019s total capital commitments and not resulting in the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) being the single largest investor in the fund. \nII.  THE FUND \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n2.  The PINAI Fund is a private equity fund (PEF) to be capitalized at up to the Philippine \npeso equivalent of $625 million, which will invest in core infrastructure assets in the Philippines. \nIt will be managed by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA), a global infrastructure \nasset manager, through a management vehicle wholly owned by Macquarie Group. ADB will \ninvest alongside (i) Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), the Philippines\u2019 state-owned \npension  fund  for  government  employees;  (ii)  Algemene  Pensioen  Groep  (APG)  of  the \nNetherlands, a pension fund asset manager; and (iii) Macquarie Group.  \n \n3.  Unlike ADB\u2019s previous PEF investments, where it has played a largely passive role  by \ninvesting in existing funding vehicles, ADB played an early part in helping conceptualize the \ndevelopment  of  the  PINAI  Fund  and  guiding  its  design,  incubation,  mobilization  of  capital \ncommitments, fund manager selection process, negotiation of terms, and structuring.  \n \n4.  The fund concept arose from efforts by the Government of the Philippines to find ways to \ncatalyze private sector investment in infrastructure. Decades of low public and private spending \nin the area have left the Philippines with extremely poor infrastructure, even when compared \nwith its development peers. Improving this infrastructure through more efficient public spending \nand by fostering transparently processed and well-managed public\u2013private partnership (PPP) \nprojects is a top government priority under the Philippines Development Plan, 2010\u20132016.1 The \nplan expects 12% of the country\u2019s infrastructure investment needs, or about $14.3 billion over \nthe period, to come from the private sector. 2 This is projected to include investments in new \n(greenfield)  infrastructure  projects  and  in  the  expansion  and  rehabilitation  of  existing \n(brownfield)  PPP  projects.  The  infrastructure  investment  landscape  in  the  Philippines  is \nbenefiting  from  improvements  to  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  governing  PPPs\u2014\nparticularly through amendments to the country\u2019s build-operate-transfer law3\u2014as well as from \navailability of sufficient budget to fund the government\u2019s share in PPP projects and preparation \nof bankable PPP projects for bidding.4  \n \n5.  Since 2003, the Philippines has maintained a current account surplus largely due to \nstrong growth in remittances from  its overseas workers.5 However, equity capital available \ndomestically is constrained and does not meet the level required to meet the country\u2019s growing \ninfrastructure investment demand. Consulting firm McKinsey has estimated that over the next \n10 years, only the People\u2019s Republic of China and Malaysia will have domestic private capital \nmarkets deep enough to meet their infrastructure funding requirements on their own.6 \n \n                                                \n1  Government of the Philippines, National Economic and Development Authority. 2011.

Both the large domestic conglomerates and the smaller developers in the Philippines are \nprioritizing investments in greenfield PPP projects. These provide higher returns, but also carry \nconstruction and completion risks, which these investors seem willing to accept. However, \nbecause most of these investors have their equity committed to existing infrastructure assets, \nthey are keen to recycle their capital in preparation for the imminent rollout of the greenfield \nPPP projects. \n \n7.  At the same time, a growing number of the world\u2019s institutional investors are looking to \ninvest in brownfield projects that no longer have construction and completion risks but can \nprovide stable, high-quality, inflation-hedged, long-term cash flows that match the long-tailed \nliabilities of institutional portfolios.7 This is particularly true of Philippine and foreign pension \nfunds, whose liabilities are inherently long-term. \n \n8.  This  has  created  a  situation  in  the  Philippines  in  which  (i)  imminent  infrastructure \nopportunities  are  in  need  of  equity  capital;  (ii)  domestic  capital  is  tied  to  existing,  stable \ninfrastructure assets; and (iii) institutional investors (particularly pension funds) are keen on \ninvesting in de-risked infrastructure assets (with potential for expansion or improvements in \ncapacity  and  utilization).  Combined,  these  factors  create  a  market  gap  that  is  primed  for \nfinancial intermediation. \n \n9.  To fill this market gap, respond to the government\u2019s request for help in developing \ninfrastructure  financing  solutions,  and  foster  Philippine  capital  market  development,  ADB \nproposed a PEF structure in the form of the PINAI Fund.8 [This information was deemed \nconfidential  according  to  exception  no.  97(iv)  and  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications \nPolicy.] \n \n10.  The  proposal  was  well-received  by  the  government  and  welcomed  by  GSIS,  a \ngovernment-owned pension fund, as a way to deploy significant equity capital of at least $300 \nmillion into stable, long-term infrastructure assets. However, because GSIS had never invested \nin PEFs before, GSIS indicated that it was highly reliant on ADB\u2019s equity participation and \nguidance through the fund establishment process, including the selection of an appropriate fund \nmanager. \n \n11.  In October 2011, ADB and GSIS began evaluating prospective fund managers that had \nthe capacity to undertake the role under terms acceptable to the investors. After a rigorous, \nmultistage selection process, ADB and GSIS selected MIRA as the fund manager in April 2012, \njudging it to be the most capable among the interested candidates of establishing and managing \na first-time PEF dedicated to core infrastructure investments in the Philippines.

These alternatives included the nonbanking \nfinancial  institution  model.  However,  none  of  the  alternative  financing  models  gained  support  at  this  time \n(particularly on issues related to their commercial viability and sustainability), given the still-maturing stage of the \nPPP project pipeline in the Philippines and ongoing PPP legal and regulatory reform. If successful, the PEF \nstructure may lead to the emergence of the more comprehensive infrastructure financing mechanisms that were \nconsidered during the process. ", "  3 \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy   \n12.  Overview.  The  PINAI  Fund  will  provide  equity  and  quasi-equity9 financing  in  core \ninfrastructure assets in the Philippines.

[This information was deemed confidential according to exception no. 97(iv) \nand 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy.] \n   \n14.  Deal sourcing. MIRA will source opportunities for the fund through its well-established \nrelationships with leading domestic developers and/or operators that are keen to partner with a \nknowledgeable  and  experienced  global  infrastructure  owner  and  operator  like  MIRA.  [This \ninformation was deemed confidential according to exception no. 97(iv) and 97(v) of ADB\u2019s \nPublic Communications Policy.] \n \n15.  Value addition. MIRA will play an active role in all of the fund\u2019s investments, as it has \ndone in its previous 47 funds.

[This information was deemed confidential according to exception no. 97(iv) and 97(v) of \nADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy.] \n \n2.  Management \n19.  ADB and GSIS selected MIRA as the fund manager after a rigorous 6-month process. \nThe fund manager mandate was presented to a group of 10 potential fund managers with \nestablished track records. Five expressed interest and made formal presentations to ADB and \nGSIS and three were selected to make further presentations. MIRA was chosen based on its \ninstitutional  strength,  deal  execution  capabilities,  operating  expertise,  investment  quality \nstrategy, and competitive commercial terms.  \n \n20.  MIRA  is  a  division  within  Macquarie  Funds  Group,  which  is  the  dedicated  asset \nmanagement group within Macquarie Group. MIRA is the world\u2019s largest infrastructure fund \nmanager and has been investing in infrastructure since its establishment in 1994. The firm has \nover $97 billion of assets under management across 47 funds and 101 core infrastructure \nbusinesses.

Governance Structure \n21.  MIRA will follow a four-stage investment process based on an approach developed and \nrefined  through  its  18  years  of  infrastructure  investing.

ADB  will provide  an equity investment of the Philippine peso equivalent, as of the \nsubscription date, of up to $25,000,000 in the PINAI Fund, not to exceed 25% of the fund\u2019s total \ncapital commitments and not resulting in ADB being the single largest investor in the fund. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Exit Strategy \n25.  [This information was deemed confidential according to exception no. 97(iv) and 97(v) of \nADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy.] \n \n2.  Reporting Arrangements \n26.  MIRA will provide ADB with (i) quarterly unaudited reports; (ii) semiannual unaudited \nreports; and (iii) audited annual reports, including financial statements, a fund overview, and an \noverview of the portfolio with brief information on each portfolio company\u2019s performance and \nvaluation. ADB will review this information and will follow up with MIRA when more information \nor clarification is needed. If the information received from MIRA points to issues that could \nimpair the value of ADB\u2019s investment in the PINAI Fund, ADB will decide whether to put the fund \non a watch list for more frequent review and closer attention. \n \n27.  [This information was deemed confidential according to exception no. 97(iv) and 97(v) of \nADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy.] \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n28.  Catalyzing private investment. ADB helped design and orchestrate the development of \nthe PINAI Fund. By conceiving of and organizing a PEF for effective financial intermediation to \nhelp fill a market gap for private sector investment in Philippine infrastructure, ADB will catalyze \nup to $625 million in capital. [This information was deemed confidential according to exception \nno.  97(iv)  and  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy.]  It  will  also  attract  top-tier \ninternational partners to the Philippines, foster competition in domestic infrastructure finance, \nand  establish  a  secondary  market for  well-performing  infrastructure  assets. Without  ADB\u2019s \nassistance and participation, a fund of this kind with an efficient structure that would benefit the \nPhilippines is unlikely to have materialized. The beneficial impact of ADB\u2019s involvement in the \nPINAI Fund is also greater than any amount of equity and debt that ADB would have contributed \ndirectly to infrastructure projects; private equity direct investments create a significantly higher ", "  5 \nmultiplier  effect  as  new  capital  attracts  additional  investment  and  financing  in  underlying \ninvestments.  \n \n29.  Knowledge sharing. [This information was deemed confidential according to exception \nno. 97(iv) and 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy.] \n \n30.  Raising  governance  and  safeguard  standards.  ADB\u2019s  presence  on  the  advisory \ncommittee will help ensure that the fund manager (and underlying assets in which the fund \ninvests in) will observe the highest standards in corporate governance, as well as environmental \nand social safeguards. \n \nD.

The  PINAI  Fund  will  be  subject  to the risks  associated  with  equity \ninvestments, including (i) political, economic, and social risks; (ii) legal and regulatory risks; (iii) \nexit and liquidity risks; (iv) accounting and disclosure risks; and (v) repatriation and tax risks. \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n36.  Impact. Because PEFs are highly catalytic and offer investors a potentially high return \nby mobilizing new capital under a common investment theme, they are a popular way for \ndevelopment finance institutions to address gaps in capital markets. PEFs are very new to the \nPhilippines. Forty-nine funds list the country as a geographic target, but 46 of these have a \nSoutheast Asia regional focus, making the Philippines only one country competing among many \nfor investments. The Philippines receives little from these funds. The remaining three funds \nhave specifically targeted the Philippines market, but only one fund manager is based in the \ncountry and none concentrate on infrastructure.10 This will make the PINAI Fund the first PEF to \nfocus  exclusively  on  Philippine  infrastructure  opportunities.  [This  information  was  deemed \nconfidential  according  to  exception  no.  97(iv)  and  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications \nPolicy.] It is anticipated that this will generate a development impact well beyond the initial \ninvestment by leading to the launching of additional PEFs in the country, attracting additional \nforeign  capital,  and  further  developing  domestic  capital  markets.  Increased  private  sector \ninvestment in infrastructure in the Philippines, moreover, is an additional development impact in \nitself.  \n \n                                                \n10 Preqin.

The outcome will be the demonstration of the viability of the PEF structure for \ninfrastructure finance in the Philippines. [This information was deemed confidential according to \nexception no. 97(iv) and 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy.] \n \n38.  Output. The output will be the establishment of and significant investments by the PINAI \nFund. [This information was deemed confidential according to exception no. 97(iv) and 97(v) of \nADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy.] \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n39.  Support for the PINAI Fund is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which identifies \ninfrastructure and finance as two of the five core areas of operations where ADB will employ its \nfinancial  and  institutional  resources  to  maximize  results,  efficiency,  and  impact.11 Under \nStrategy 2020, ADB\u2019s operations aim to promote a larger role for the private sector to drive \ngrowth  and  to  catalyze  investments  through,  among  other  means,  innovative  financial \ninstruments such as the fund.   \n \n40.  In October 2011, ADB finalized its country partnership strategy (CPS), 2011\u20132016 for \nthe Philippines. It is aligned with the government\u2019s own Philippine Development Plan, 2011\u2013\n2016. The CPS makes infrastructure, which is one of the core operational areas under Strategy \n2020, a top priority and recognizes that poor infrastructure has hindered inclusive growth in the \ncountry. The CPS calls for the \u2015scaling up of transport and energy infrastructure\u2016 investments to \nimprove  the  country\u2019s  investment  climate  and  expand  private  sector  development. 12  It \nemphasizes support for PPP opportunities across private sector operations and states that the \nsuccess of the PPP program is contingent on improving government policy, institutional reforms, \nand upgrading the investment climate overall.  \n \n41.  The PINAI Fund is aligned with the CPS and supports the strategy\u2019s priority sectors.13 It \nis well-timed to capitalize on PPP opportunities, or the development of other critical non-PPP \ninfrastructure, if and when they become available. ADB support for the PINAI Fund will build on \nprevious ongoing public sector operations that focused on strengthening the Philippines\u2019 overall \nPPP environment by improving the legal and regulatory framework, building capacity in PPP-\nrelated institutions, and developing bankable projects.14 The fund will help achieve the CPS goal \nto orient private sector operations to government priorities via an investment focus that covers \nboth (i) infrastructure finance, and (ii) \u2015renewable energy and energy efficiency projects either \nthrough direct assistance or investments in private equity funds operating in the Philippines.\u2016 \n \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy \n42.  ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Operational Plan states that the region needs to invest heavily in \ninfrastructure  to  provide  a  favorable  business  environment  and  improve  people\u2019s  living \nstandards.15 Because  public  sector  resources  are  far  from  sufficient  to  meet  the  massive \ninfrastructure  financing  needs  of  developing  member  countries,  the  plan  calls  for  the \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2008.

ADB\u2019s prior investments in single-country infrastructure financing facilities were (i) a $30 \nmillion equity investment in India\u2019s Infrastructure Development Finance Company in 1997, and \n(ii) a $40 million equity investment in the Indonesian Infrastructure Financing Facility in 2009.16 \n \n45.  Its experience with these investments made ADB acutely aware of the implementation \nrisks related to capital deployment. In the case of India\u2019s Infrastructure Development Finance \nCompany, capital deployment was delayed due to the government\u2019s lack of specialists needed \nto help create bankable projects. The Indonesian Infrastructure Financing Facility also suffered \na delay. This was due to difficulties in recruiting and retaining the appropriate local senior \nmanagement team, as well as legal and regulatory issues that affected the entire market. \n \n46.  ADB has learned from these experiences and has taken steps in structuring the fund to \nmitigate risk factors:  \n \n(i)  Investment strategy.

The MIRA business model combines world-\nclass  investment  banking  capabilities  with  owner  and/or  operator  expertise \nacross all infrastructure classes that allows MIRA to draw upon infrastructure \nexpertise from within its own ranks to improve existing assets. \n(iii)  Financial  terms.
