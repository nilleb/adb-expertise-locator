ADB  will \ninvest alongside (i) Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), the Philippines\u2019 state-owned \npension  fund  for  government  employees;  (ii)  Algemene  Pensioen  Groep  (APG)  of  the \nNetherlands, a pension fund asset manager; and (iii) Macquarie Group.  \n \n3. \nUnlike ADB\u2019s previous PEF investments, where it has played a largely passive role  by \ninvesting  in  existing  funding  vehicles,  ADB  played  an  early  part  in  helping  conceptualize  the \ndevelopment  of  the  PINAI  Fund  and  guiding  its  design,  incubation,  mobilization  of  capital \ncommitments, fund manager selection process, negotiation of terms, and structuring.  \n \n4. \nThe fund concept arose from efforts by the Government of the Philippines to find ways to \ncatalyze private sector investment in infrastructure. Decades of low public and private spending \nin  the  area  have  left  the  Philippines  with  extremely  poor  infrastructure,  even  when  compared \nwith its development peers. Improving this infrastructure through more efficient public spending \nand  by  fostering  transparently  processed  and  well-managed  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP) \nprojects is a top government priority under the Philippines Development Plan, 2010\u20132016.1 The \nplan  expects  12%  of the  country\u2019s  infrastructure investment  needs,  or  about  $14.3  billion  over \nthe  period,  to  come  from  the  private  sector. 2 This  is  projected  to  include  investments  in  new \n(greenfield)  infrastructure  projects  and  in  the  expansion  and  rehabilitation  of  existing \n(brownfield)  PPP  projects.  The  infrastructure  investment  landscape  in  the  Philippines  is \nbenefiting  from  improvements  to  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  governing  PPPs\u2014\nparticularly  through  amendments  to  the  country\u2019s  build-operate-transfer  law3\u2014as  well  as  from \navailability of sufficient budget to fund the government\u2019s share in PPP projects and preparation \nof bankable PPP projects for bidding.4  \n \n5. \nSince  2003,  the  Philippines  has  maintained  a  current  account  surplus  largely  due  to \nstrong  growth  in  remittances  from  its  overseas  workers. 5 However,  equity  capital  available \ndomestically is constrained and does not meet the level required to meet the country\u2019s growing \ninfrastructure  investment  demand.  Consulting  firm  McKinsey  has  estimated  that  over  the  next \n10  years,  only  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  Malaysia  will  have domestic  private  capital \nmarkets deep enough to meet their infrastructure funding requirements on their own.6 \n \n\n                                                \n1  Government  of  the  Philippines,  National  Economic  and  Development  Authority.  2011.

These provide higher returns, but also carry \nconstruction  and  completion  risks,  which  these  investors  seem  willing  to  accept.  However, \nbecause  most  of  these  investors  have  their  equity  committed  to  existing  infrastructure  assets, \nthey  are  keen  to  recycle  their  capital  in  preparation  for  the  imminent  rollout  of  the  greenfield \nPPP projects. \n \n7. \nAt the same time, a growing  number of the world\u2019s institutional investors are looking to \ninvest  in  brownfield  projects  that  no  longer  have  construction  and  completion  risks  but  can \nprovide  stable,  high-quality,  inflation-hedged,  long-term  cash  flows  that  match  the  long-tailed \nliabilities  of  institutional  portfolios.7 This  is  particularly  true  of  Philippine  and  foreign  pension \nfunds, whose liabilities are inherently long-term. \n \nThis  has  created  a  situation  in  the  Philippines  in  which  (i)  imminent  infrastructure \n8. \nopportunities  are  in  need  of  equity  capital;  (ii)  domestic  capital  is  tied  to  existing,  stable \ninfrastructure  assets;  and  (iii)  institutional  investors  (particularly  pension  funds)  are  keen  on \ninvesting  in  de-risked  infrastructure  assets  (with  potential  for  expansion  or  improvements  in \ncapacity  and  utilization).  Combined,  these  factors  create  a  market  gap  that  is  primed  for \nfinancial intermediation. \n \n9. \nTo  fill  this  market  gap,  respond  to  the  government\u2019s  request  for  help  in  developing \ninfrastructure  financing  solutions,  and  foster  Philippine  capital  market  development,  ADB \nproposed  a  PEF  structure  in  the  form  of  the  PINAI  Fund. 8 [This  information  was  deemed \nconfidential  according  to  exception  no.  97(iv)  and  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications \nPolicy.] \n \nThe  proposal  was  well-received  by  the  government  and  welcomed  by  GSIS,  a \n10. \ngovernment-owned pension fund, as a way to deploy significant equity capital of at least $300 \nmillion into stable, long-term infrastructure assets. However, because GSIS had never invested \nin  PEFs  before,  GSIS  indicated  that  it  was  highly  reliant  on  ADB\u2019s  equity  participation  and \nguidance through the fund establishment process, including the selection of an appropriate fund \nmanager. \n \n11. \nIn October 2011, ADB and GSIS began evaluating prospective fund managers that had \nthe  capacity  to  undertake  the  role  under  terms  acceptable  to  the  investors.  After  a  rigorous, \nmultistage selection process, ADB and GSIS selected MIRA as the fund manager in April 2012, \njudging it to be the most capable among the interested candidates of establishing and managing \na first-time PEF dedicated to core infrastructure investments in the Philippines.

These  alternatives  included  the  nonbanking \nfinancial  institution  model.  However,  none  of  the  alternative  financing  models  gained  support  at  this  time \n(particularly on issues related to  their commercial viability and sustainability), given the still-maturing stage of  the \nPPP  project  pipeline  in  the  Philippines  and  ongoing  PPP  legal  and  regulatory  reform.  If  successful,  the  PEF \nstructure  may  lead  to  the  emergence  of  the  more  comprehensive  infrastructure  financing  mechanisms  that  were \nconsidered during the process. \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nB. \n\nStrategy.

MIRA  was  chosen  based  on  its \ninstitutional  strength,  deal  execution  capabilities,  operating  expertise,  investment  quality \nstrategy, and competitive commercial terms.  \n \n20.  MIRA  is  a  division  within  Macquarie  Funds  Group,  which  is  the  dedicated  asset \nmanagement  group  within  Macquarie  Group.  MIRA  is  the  world\u2019s  largest  infrastructure  fund \nmanager and has been investing in infrastructure since its establishment in 1994.

ADB will review this information and will follow up with MIRA when more information \nor  clarification  is  needed.  If  the  information  received  from  MIRA  points  to  issues  that  could \nimpair the value of ADB\u2019s investment in the PINAI Fund, ADB will decide whether to put the fund \non a watch list for more frequent review and closer attention. \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy.] \n \nC. \n \nCatalyzing private investment. ADB helped design and orchestrate the development of \n28. \nthe PINAI Fund. By conceiving of and organizing a PEF for effective financial intermediation to \nhelp fill a market gap for private sector investment in Philippine infrastructure, ADB will catalyze \nup to $625 million in capital. [This information was deemed confidential according to exception \nno.  97(iv)  and  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy.]  It  will  also  attract  top-tier \ninternational  partners  to  the  Philippines,  foster  competition  in  domestic  infrastructure  finance, \nand  establish  a  secondary  market  for  well-performing  infrastructure  assets.  Without  ADB\u2019s \nassistance and participation, a fund of this kind with an efficient structure that would benefit the \nPhilippines  is  unlikely  to  have  materialized.  The  beneficial  impact  of  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  the \nPINAI Fund is also greater than any amount of equity and debt that ADB would have contributed \ndirectly  to infrastructure projects;  private  equity  direct  investments  create a  significantly  higher \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nKnowledge sharing.

Because  PEFs are  highly  catalytic  and offer  investors  a  potentially  high return \nby  mobilizing  new  capital  under  a  common  investment  theme,  they  are  a  popular  way  for \ndevelopment finance institutions to address gaps in capital markets. PEFs are very new to the \nPhilippines.  Forty-nine  funds  list  the  country  as  a  geographic  target,  but  46  of  these  have  a \nSoutheast Asia regional focus, making the Philippines only one country competing among many \nfor  investments.  The  Philippines  receives  little  from  these  funds.  The  remaining  three  funds \nhave  specifically  targeted  the  Philippines  market,  but  only  one  fund  manager  is  based  in  the \ncountry and none concentrate on infrastructure.10 This will make the PINAI Fund the first PEF to \nfocus  exclusively  on  Philippine  infrastructure  opportunities.  [This  information  was  deemed \nconfidential  according  to  exception  no.  97(iv)  and  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications \nPolicy.]  It  is  anticipated  that  this  will  generate  a  development  impact  well  beyond  the  initial \ninvestment  by  leading  to  the  launching  of  additional  PEFs  in  the  country,  attracting  additional \nforeign  capital,  and  further  developing  domestic  capital  markets.  Increased  private  sector \ninvestment in infrastructure in the Philippines, moreover, is an additional development impact in \nitself.  \n \n\n                                                \n10 Preqin.

It  is  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  own  Philippine  Development  Plan,  2011\u2013\n2016. The CPS makes infrastructure, which is one of the core operational areas under Strategy \n2020, a top priority and recognizes that poor infrastructure has hindered inclusive growth in the \ncountry. The CPS calls for the \u2015scaling up of transport and energy infrastructure\u2016 investments to \nimprove  the  country\u2019s  investment  climate  and  expand  private  sector  development. 12  It \nemphasizes support for PPP opportunities across private sector operations and states that the \nsuccess of the PPP program is contingent on improving government policy, institutional reforms, \nand upgrading the investment climate overall.  \n \nThe PINAI Fund is aligned with the CPS and supports the strategy\u2019s priority sectors.13 It \n41. \nis  well-timed  to  capitalize  on  PPP  opportunities,  or  the  development  of  other  critical  non-PPP \ninfrastructure, if and when they become available. ADB support for the PINAI Fund will build on \nprevious ongoing public sector operations that focused on strengthening the Philippines\u2019 overall \nPPP  environment  by  improving  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  building  capacity  in  PPP-\nrelated institutions, and developing bankable projects.14 The fund will help achieve the CPS goal \nto orient private sector operations to government priorities via an investment focus that covers \nboth  (i)  infrastructure finance,  and (ii)  \u2015renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  projects  either \nthrough direct assistance or investments in private equity funds operating in the Philippines.\u2016 \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s Financial Sector Operational Plan states that the region needs to invest heavily in \n42. \ninfrastructure  to  provide  a  favorable  business  environment  and  improve  people\u2019s  living \nstandards. 15  Because  public  sector  resources  are  far  from  sufficient  to  meet  the  massive \ninfrastructure  financing  needs  of  developing  member  countries,  the  plan  calls  for  the \n\n                                                \n11 ADB.  2008.

In  the  case  of  India\u2019s  Infrastructure  Development  Finance \nCompany, capital deployment was delayed due to the government\u2019s lack of specialists needed \nto help create bankable projects. The Indonesian Infrastructure Financing Facility also suffered \na  delay.  This  was  due  to  difficulties  in  recruiting  and  retaining  the  appropriate  local  senior \nmanagement team, as well as legal and regulatory issues that affected the entire market. \n \n46. \nmitigate risk factors:  \n \n\nADB has learned from these experiences and has taken steps in structuring the fund to \n\nInvestment  strategy.
