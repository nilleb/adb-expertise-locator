THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $35,000,000 (in Indian rupee equivalent) in Shubham Housing Development \nFinance Company Limited (Shubham) for the Shubham Supporting Housing Finance in Semi- \nand Peri-Urban Areas Project in India. \n \n2.  The equity investment of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provides growth capital to \nShubham to support the expansion of its operations to provide critically needed affordable \nhousing finance and home equity loans, primarily to economically weaker sections (EWS) and \nlow-income groups (LIG) in semi- and peri-urban areas.1 Under the investment, Shubham will \nimplement measures under a gender action plan (GAP) to expand access to credit for women. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Affordable housing. Limited housing supply adversely affects the living conditions of \nlower-income households, especially in large cities characterized by low building standards. The \nshortage of housing units in India is estimated at 18.7 million in urban areas and 43.7 million in \nrural areas.2 More than 90% of this deficit is projected to be in the lower-income segment. The \nGovernment of India launched the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) initiative in 2015, with a \ntarget of building 20 million affordable homes for the urban poor by 2022.3 To date, about 11.3 \nmillion homes have been sanctioned.4 Under the PMAY, the government offers interest rate \nsubsidies of 3.0%\u20136.5%, depending on the loan amount and the income category of the borrower, \nand other measures to incentivize the supply of affordable housing. \n \n4.  Finance sector overview. Banks dominate the finance sector accounting for more than \n64% of financial system assets.5 Nonbank financial companies (NBFCs) accounted for about 20% \nof overall system credit in March 2020 and are funding segments that typically are underserved \nor not catered to by banks. 6 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had 9,484 NBFCs registered as of \n31 May 2021. Despite the size of the banking industry, poor access to financial services remains \na key issue in India, with 20.1% of people unbanked.7 Access to credit is even more limited, with \nless than 6.6% of the population accessing credit via formal channels.8 \n \n1  For the purposes of \u201caffordable housing\u201d, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) defines (i) an EWS household as having \na family income of less than \u20b90.3 million per annum and (ii) an LIG household as having a family income of \u20b90.3 \nmillion\u2013\u20b90.6 million per annum, and (iii) a middle-income household as having a family income of \u20b90.6 million\u2013\u20b91.8 \nmillion per annum.

Of the people who borrowed money in the last 12 \nmonths prior to the survey carried out in 2017, 14% borrowed through a formal channel, 72% through family and \nfriends, and the rest via private moneylenders. \n \nPUBLIC.

Asset quality varies, with higher gross nonperforming assets (NPAs) for public sector \nbanks at 9.7% as compared with 4.6% for private sector banks as of 30 September 2020. In part \nbecause of a loan moratorium extended by the RBI and the restructuring of certain accounts, \nasset quality improved, with gross NPAs for the banks decreasing from 9.3% in fiscal year (FY) \n2019 to 7.5% as of 30 September 2020.9 The gross NPAs of the NBFCs stabilized at 6.4% in \nFY2021 (FY2020: 6.3%), but the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is yet to be fully \nreflected on their books. \n \n6.  Housing finance sector. Mortgage penetration remains low in India and was 11.2% as \nof 30 September 2020\u2014much lower than in other emerging markets such as Malaysia (35.4%), \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (27.9%) and Thailand (23.9%).10 The total volume of housing credit \noutstanding in India (including home equity loans) was about \u20b922.8 trillion at the end of FY2021.11 \nBanks primarily provide home loans to salaried employees in urban areas. Regulated by the RBI, \nthe 91 housing finance companies (HFCs) are solely mandated to fund housing, catering to both \nthe prime and the affordable segments. HFCs are significant players in mortgage financing, but \ntheir share declined from 38.0% in FY2018 to 33.0% at the end of FY2021 because of the \ncontinued liquidity stress facing the sector, rising competition from banks (largely in the prime \nsegment), and the COVID-19 pandemic.12 The asset quality among the HFCs deteriorated to \n2.9% in FY2021 from 2.4% in FY2020 and is expected to deteriorate further with the full impact \nof COVID-19 expected to be known by the end of FY2022. Nevertheless, the asset quality among \nHFCs continues to outperform both banks and NBFCs. \n \n7.  Underserved  home  loan  borrower  segments.  Lower-income  households  are \nparticularly  constrained  in  obtaining  mortgages  because  of  (i)  undocumented  incomes,  (ii) \ninadequate property rights limiting its use as collateral, (iii) perceived higher credit risk, (iv) lack \nof proximity to a bank branch, and (v) high origination costs because of the relatively small loan \nsizes. As a result, such households typically fund their homes through savings, borrowings from \nfamily and friends, or loans from local moneylenders at usurious interest rates. \n \n8.  Women\u2019s access to housing credit. Access to finance for women is also extremely low, \nwith only 5.0% of women reported to have borrowed from a formal financial institution and only \n3.0% having an outstanding home loan.13  Further, lack of housing finance is a critical issue for \nwomen, impairing their ability to own an important asset and gain economic security compared to \nmen.14 Despite a large market size for women\u2019s housing loans in India (estimated at $32.3 \nbillion),15 women\u2019s access to housing finance remains constrained by insufficient income and \ndocumentation, lack of property titles, limited financial literacy, and traditional gender norms. A \n2016 survey of land ownership in northern and eastern India indicated that women owned only \n3.6% of plots, men owned 85.9%, and the remaining 10.5% were untitled.16 Recognizing the \nissues related to low levels of women\u2019s property ownership, several Indian states have provided \n \n9  The RBI allowed financial institutions to extend a moratorium to their clients from March to August 2020, after which \nit allowed them to offer a one-time restructuring until FY2021 to clients who were current prior to the onset of COVID-\n19. In May 2021, the RBI allowed restructuring of loans to individuals and small businesses until 30 September 2021. \n10 Housing Finance Information Network (accessed on 9 October 2021). \n11 ICRA. 2021.

The Government of India also introduced a credit-\nlinked subsidy scheme program to bring more women into the housing finance market by \nproviding a subsidized interest rate on housing loans if a woman holds the title to a new property.17 \nOn the supply side, most financial institutions do not have gender-specific products or services \ntargeting women and, given their limited understanding of this customer segment, most financial \nservices providers do not recognize the business case in actively serving the women\u2019s market.18 \n \n9.  Rationale. To address the large market gap and improve access to housing finance, \nparticularly for women and lower-income households, ADB has identified HFC partners that have \ndemonstrated the ability to reach such households on a sustainable basis. While ADB has \nprovided debt funding to HFCs in India,19 the project will be ADB\u2019s first equity investment in an \nHFC that targets lower-income households primarily residing in the peripheries of larger cities and \nin Tier II and below cities.20 As of FY2021, about 75% of Shubham\u2019s portfolio comprised of lower-\nincome households, 61% of clients had an informal income, and 90% of loans disbursed were to \nwomen as the primary or co-borrowers. Further, 18% were first-time borrowers from a formal \nfinancial institution. Shubham has had stable business growth led by experienced promoters and \nsupported by a strong management team. It has demonstrated superior asset quality relative to \nits peers on loans originated after the 2016 demonetization, and its asset quality has largely \nremained stable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through its 99 branches spread across 9 states, \nShubham caters to underserved lower-income households and uses technology to provide an \nefficient and cost-effective origination, approval, and monitoring system. The project will support \nthe growth of Shubham as it emerges from the pandemic, allowing it to deepen its presence in \nexisting geographies, and further expand to more Tier II and below cities. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n10.  Overview. Shubham began operations in January 2011, offering housing loans and home \nequity loans, catering largely to the informal segment. As of FY2021, 60% of its portfolio was for \nhome purchase; 14% for self-construction; 4% for home improvement; and 20% were home equity \nloans,  typically  for  business  purposes.  Almost  all  its  loans  are  secured  by  self-occupied \nresidences and are typically the first home for the borrower. Under a pilot program, Shubham also \nprovides construction loans to small builders for small and medium-sized residential construction, \nwhich account for 2% of its portfolio. Shubham\u2019s portfolio is concentrated in Maharashtra (36%), \nfollowed by Uttar Pradesh and Delhi (14% each), Haryana (9%), and Rajasthan (8%). The \naverage loan amount of the existing portfolio is \u20b90.8 million. The average contractual tenor of the \nloans is 18 years, but the weighted average life is 6.6 years because of prepayments, which is \ncommon in India. Shubham is rated A\u2013 on the domestic scale by ICRA and CRISIL. \n   \n \n17 International Finance Corporation. 2020.

Shubham  has  continued  to  focus  on  the  low-income  informal \nsegment since its founding. From FY2017 to FY2021, assets under management (AUM) grew by \nabout 26% annually. It will continue to focus on the self-employed and lower-income formal and \ninformal salaried customers, penetrating deeper into its existing geographies. It plans to scale up \nits distribution networkand will continue to focus on home purchase loans and self-construction \nhome loans, with a steady share of home equity loans, largely for small businesses. To support \nits growth plans, Shubham is planning to raise up to \u20b96.0 billion of primary capital within FY2022. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \nOwnership. As of the end of FY2021, Shubham\u2019s promoters, Sanjay Chaturvedi and Rupa Basu, \nown 11.6% of the company. Other institutional investors include Premji Invest (42.7%), Helion \nVenture Partners (14.3%), Elevar Equity (14.3%), and Motilal Oswal (12.8%).21 As part of the \ncurrent equity raise, Elevar Equity, which had invested in 2011, is expected to fully exit while \nMotilal Oswal, which invested in 2015, is expected to partially sell its equity stake.  \n \n12.  Governance structure. Shubham\u2019s board of directors has 11 members, including 4 \nindependent directors, 5 nominee directors (2 representing Premji Invest and 1 each representing \nthe other institutional investors), and the 2 cofounders. The chair of the board, Vinod Rai, is an \nindependent director. Rai was the former comptroller and auditor general of India. The board \nmembers have experience across the financial services sector, consumer businesses in retail \ncommercial banks, impact investing, and government entities. The audit committee and the risk \nmanagement committee each has an independent chair, whereas the remuneration committee \nhas a nonexecutive chair. Shubham\u2019s statutory auditor is S.R. Batliboi & Associates, an affiliate \nof Ernst & Young.  \n \n13.  Management. Shubham\u2019s cofounder and chief executive officer, Sanjay Chaturvedi, has \nmore than 30 years of experience in retail financial services working for Citibank, HSBC, and GE \nConsumer Finance. The cofounder and executive director, Rupa Basu, has more than 23 years \nof experience in risk management, credit underwriting, and compliance, working with companies \nsuch as the India Mortgage Guarantee Corporation, Citibank, Standard Chartered Bank, and \nPricewaterhouseCoopers. Other key management positions are held by seasoned professionals, \nincluding Rajesh Sood, chief operating officer, and Sanjeev Mittal, chief business officer, each of \nwhom has more than 20 years of experience in the finance industry. \n \n14.  Risk management. Shubham has a comprehensive risk management policy in place, \ncovering credit, operational, market, and enterprise risk management overseen by the risk \nmanagement committee. The risk management department consists of three functional units: (i) \na credit policy and risk control, (ii) an analytics and decision management, and (iii) a risk \ncontainment unit.  \n \nD.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED22 \n   \n \n21 Premji Invest is a family office of Azim Premji, a respected Indian tech billionaire. Helion Ventures is an early and \nmid-stage focused venture fund. Elevar Equity is an impact fund and Motilal Oswal is a private equity fund managed \nby a financial services company in India. \n22 The details are in Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \nPUBLIC. This information is being disclosed to the public in accordance with ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy. ", "5 \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n15.  ADB will make an equity investment of up to $35 million (Indian rupee equivalent) in \ncompulsorily convertible preference shares and equity shares issued by Shubham. ADB will \ninvest an initial tranche of up to $27 million (Indian rupee equivalent) \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  Use of proceeds. ADB\u2019s equity investment will provide growth capital to Shubham and \nsupport its operations to provide affordable housing to the EWS and LIG segments and home \nequity loans for small businesses in primarily semi- and peri-urban areas of India. \n \n17.  Reporting  arrangements.  ADB  will  monitor  the  project  throughout  its  duration.23 \nShubham will report at regular intervals with (i) quarterly unaudited financial statements, (ii) \nannual audited financial statements, (iii) annual development effectiveness indicators agreed \nbetween ADB and Shubham, (iv) annual reports on safeguards and social protection compliance, \nand (v) annual progress reports on the implementation of the GAP. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n18.  Access to housing for underserved segments. India\u2019s mortgage markets are still \nunderdeveloped and lower-income segments, in particular, lack access to mortgage finance \n(paras. 6\u20137). Housing is also a strong contributor to employment. According to an ADB study, \u20b910 \nmillion invested in construction creates 22,000 unskilled, 23,000 skilled and semi-skilled, and \n9,000 managerial and technical person workdays in India.24 As up to 40% of Indian homes in \nurban areas are nonpermanent, the project target extends access to affordable permanent quality \nhousing to lower-income households. This segment accounts for about 75% of Shubham\u2019s \nportfolio and thus represents an inclusive business model. \n \n19.  Providing growth capital and attracting private capital. ADB will be Shubham\u2019s first \nmultilateral development bank partner and will help facilitate an up to \u20b96.0 billion primary capital \nraise from new investors.  \n \n20.  Adherence to  market-leading  standards  and improved  gender  responsiveness. \nShubham\u2019s adherence to high corporate governance standards and its adoption of market-leading \nrisk management, social, and environmental standards will be improved by ADB\u2019s nomination of \na director to the company\u2019s board. The investment will also support Shubham\u2019s expansion of its \nlending and financial inclusion services to women. The company is committed to improving \ngender responsiveness in its operations through the implementation of a GAP, which notably \nincludes more gender-inclusive human resources management practices.25 \n   \n \n23 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 J.

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n21.  Impact. The project is aligned with the following impact: access to housing finance for \nlower-income households increased (a PMAY initiative) (footnote 3). \n \n22.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: availability of affordable housing \nfinancing for the lower-income households, and particularly for women, improved.  \n \n23.  Outputs. The project will have the following outputs: (i) capacity of Shubham to serve \nlower income households improved, (ii) capacity to serve women borrowers improved, (iii) \ncapacity  to  cater  to  lagging  states  of  India  improved,  (iv)  gender  equality  in  employment \nopportunities improved, and (v) gender responsiveness in the work environment enhanced. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n24.  The project will contribute to the following operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: \n(i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, (ii) accelerating progress in gender \nequality, and (iii) making cities more livable.26 According to ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nIndia, 2018\u20132022, ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations will continue to support the finance sector.27 \nThe project will also support access to affordable housing in lagging states, in line with the PMAY \ninitiative. Lastly, the project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 Operational Plan for Priority 2: \nAccelerating Progress in Gender Equality, 2019\u20132024.28 \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n25.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009).29 The investment is categorized FI for environment, and FI-C for involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples based on the current and likely portfolio impacts and risks. \nActivities categorized A for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples; or B \nfor involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples will be excluded from financing. \n \n26.  Based on Shubham\u2019s current and expected future loans portfolio, loan activities are not \nanticipated to result in significant environmental or social impacts. However, Shubham is testing \na new product focused on small and medium-sized residential building construction loans (of a \nmaximum loan value up to $400,000 equivalent).  Such loans will be screened and categorized \nfor environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Borrowers will also need to \ncomply with national laws and regulations through loan agreements. Shubham will (i) apply ADB's \nprohibited investment activities list; (ii) exclude activities with category A environment impacts and \nactivities categorized as A and B on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples impacts; \n \n26 ADB. 2018.

Shubham will develop a detailed environmental and social management system (ESMS) \naligned  with  its  policies  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements  for  financial \ninstitutions, commensurate to the impacts and risks associated with its loan products. Shubham \nhas agreed to develop the ESMS prior to first disbursement. Shubham will also ensure that staff \nare trained to implement the ESMS and address gaps identified during ADB\u2019s due diligence. 30 \n \n28.  Environmental and social safeguards. Based on its current portfolio, almost all of \nShubham\u2019s loans fall within the environment category C classification, wherein its existing loans \nare likely to have minimal environmental impacts. The climate change impact from the project is \nexpected to be low because of the nature and scale of current and anticipated future loan products \noffered by the company. No land acquisition, physical or economic displacement, or impact on \nindigenous peoples\u2019 communities are expected since the housing loans will be provided to \nindividuals who have purchased the property or are voluntarily making improvements to their \ndwellings. During housing construction, standard risks such as health and safety of workers and \nthe community are likely to occur. Impacts associated with noise, dust, traffic, erosion, and the \nstorage and disposal of hazardous and/or nonhazardous waste will be identified and mitigated. \nGiven the small-scale of construction, these issues can be adequately managed and mitigated \nthrough national law and the implementation of an effective ESMS. \n29.  The head of human resources is responsible for the implementation of the environmental \nand social management policy and the delivery of related training to staff. Currently, technical \nvaluation training includes aspects such as safe design and construction, natural hazard risk, \nimpacts on communities, and pollution and groundwater impacts. Shubham will upskill and train \nits existing staff to enable the effective implementation of the ESMS. The ESMS will require \nShubham to report on training delivered, and on compliance of loans with environmental and \nsocial requirements, in particular potential category B loans (such as large construction loans). \n \n30.  Labor and social protection.  Shubham has in place a robust policy and mechanism to \naddress sexual harassment in compliance with the requirements of the Sexual Harassment of \nWomen at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013; no complaints have \nbeen received since the policy and related training were implemented. Its FY2020 annual report \nindicated that there were no material developments related to human resources and/or industrial \nrelations adversely affecting the company\u2019s business during FY2020. Shubham will comply with \nnational labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy, will take measures to \ncomply with the internationally recognized core labor standards. Shubham will report on its \ncompliance with such laws. Information disclosure will follow ADB requirements.31 \n \n31.  Gender equity as a theme. Gender analysis conducted during due diligence indicated \nthat Shubham follows an underwriting approach aimed to better understand women\u2019s credit \nbehaviors and their involvement in a borrower\u2019s household. However, it applies a gender-neutral \ncorporate approach, leading to gender gaps in its staffing and operations. Shubham is committed \nto expand its outreach and develop new tailored products for female customers; it plans to \naddress corporate gender gaps through the introduction of gender measures.
