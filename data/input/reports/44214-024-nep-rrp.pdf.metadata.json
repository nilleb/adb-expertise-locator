Communities  now  recognize  that  water  resources  are \nlimited.  They  have  expressed  their  commitment  toward  protecting  and  enhancing  their  water \nresources. The  project will  demonstrate ways  to  protect  water sources while at  the  same time \ndeveloping  them  for  efficient  use.  The  communities  in the  project  area  will  have  more  reliable \nwater supplies in the dry season. Major beneficiaries will be women and disadvantaged groups.4 \nAs the first large-scale intervention by ADB in watershed management in Nepal, the project will \ndemonstrate  participatory  watershed management  planning  and  build the capacity  of  all  levels \nof government for integrated watershed development, specifically focusing on water resources. \nIt  is  intended  that  lessons  from this  project  will  influence  the  ways  in  which rural  water  supply \nand irrigation projects are designed. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe  project  is  one  of  five  components  in  Nepal\u2019s  Strategic  Program  for  Climate \nResilience  (SPCR),  which  was  endorsed  by  the  Pilot  Program  for  Climate  Resilience  Sub-\nCommittee  in  June  2011.5 The  SPCR  aims  to  build  long-term  climate  resilience  through  an \nintegrated water resource and ecosystem-based approach, and to yield lessons on how best to \nbuild  resilience  in  vulnerable  mountain  regions.  It  responds  to  the  government\u2019s  National \nAdaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) for climate change, which was finalized in September \n2010.  The  NAPA  promotes  a  watershed  and  landscape-level  approach  to  deal  with  issues \nrelated to food security, biodiversity loss, water scarcity, energy use, settlements, public health, \nand  governance.  Climate  variability  and  change  in  Nepal  is  projected  to  exacerbate  existing \nthreats  to  food,  water,  and  livelihood  security  through  alterations  in  the  quantity  and  timing  of \nprecipitation and runoff, more atmospheric water vapor and evaporation, and progressive loss of \nglacier and snowpack storage in basin headwaters. \n\n                                                \n1  Under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience financed by the Strategic Climate Fund. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance.  \n4  Disadvantaged groups are defined in  a supporting document, Gender and Social Inclusion Plan (accessible from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5   The other four SPCR components deal with building resilience to climate-induced hazards through improved flood \nforecasting  and  early  warning  systems,  managing  climate  change  risk  in  development  planning,  protecting \nendangered flora and fauna, and providing incentives for private sector assistance in climate change adaptation. \nThe  sub-committee  is  the  decision-making  body  that  oversees  the  operations  and  activities  of  the  program.  It \ncomprises representatives of contributor and eligible recipient countries to the fund. \n\n\f2 \n\nThe  selected  watersheds  for  project  investment  are  in  the  West  Seti  subbasin  of  the \n4. \nKarnali River Basin. The subbasin originates from the snowfields and glaciers around the twin \npeaks  of  Api  and  Nampa  in  the  south-facing  slopes  of  the  main  Himalayas.  The  Lower  West \nSeti  and  Budhi  Ganga  watersheds  have  been  selected  for  the  project  because  a  study \nconducted  during  project  design  assessed  their  vulnerability  to  climate  change  as  high;  their \npopulation  is  estimated  at  496,205. 6  Annual  precipitation  in  the  subbasin  varies  from \n743 millimeters to 3,351 millimeters under current climate conditions, about 75% of which falls \nduring  a  3-4  month  monsoon  season.  Water  scarcity  is  a  significant  and  widespread  problem \namong  these  communities,  occurring  every  year  in  the  dry  season. 7 The  mean  per  capita \nincome based on a household survey is NRs21,934 per year.8 More than 85% of households in \nthese watersheds live in scattered dwellings close to natural springs and patches of more gently \nsloping land. They have subsistence lifestyles based on mixed agriculture, grazing activity, and \ncollection of non-timber forest products.  \n\n5. \nThe watershed areas have average slopes of almost 30 degrees, encompassing narrow \nvalleys  with  perennial  streams.  There  is  limited  cultivatable  land  in  river  flats  and  on  the \nhillsides,  where  there  is  some  land  with  a  slope  of  less  than  20  degrees.  Transport  and  other \nservices are  severely  limited  as most  settlements  have  only foot-track access.  Each  of the  six \ndistricts  in  the  two  watersheds  has  a  small  town  with  road  access,  but  these  roads  may  be \nblocked by landslides during monsoon periods. There are agricultural markets only in the district \ncenters. The towns have electricity supply but generation shortages limit it to 5\u201310 hours a day \ndepending on location and season. Villages have even more limited access to electricity.  \n\n6. \nGlobal climate model projections downscaled for Nepal for 2030\u20132061 were analyzed for \nthe subbasin during project design.9 A temperature rise of at least 2\u00b0C by the mid-21st century \nis  projected  to  affect  the  hydrological  cycle,  which  in  turn  will  have  an  impact  on  water \navailability,  runoff,  and the  discharge regime  of rivers.10 In general,  climate  change  projections \nshow that precipitation will slightly increase in the West Seti subbasin. Precipitation will increase \nin pre-monsoon months and decrease in the monsoon, whereas a mixed trend (both increasing \nand decreasing) is projected in the project sub-watersheds in the winter and after the monsoon. \nSome  models  project  increasing  trends  and  others  project  decreasing  trends  in  annual  water \nyield  and  actual  evapotranspiration.  In  general,  climate  change  projections  show  that  annual \nriver  flow  volume  will  slightly  decrease.  However,  it  is  difficult  to  make  conclusions  regarding \nprecipitation  and  flow  trends.  Uncertainty  is  the  main  risk  that  can  be  attributed  to  climate \nchange.  Another  change  reported  was  increasing  intensity  of  rainfall,  particularly  during  rain \nshowers  in  the  pre-monsoon  period.  This  increased  intensity  would  reduce  the  amount  of \ninfiltration  and  groundwater  recharge.  Development  of  storage  facilities  is  an  effective  way  to \n\n                                                \n6  \n\nInternational  Water  Management  Institute.  2012.

The project conforms to ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan (2011\u2013\n2020)  and  supports  its  priority  of  integrated  water  resource  management  to  strengthen  the \nwater\u2013food nexus.12 The design of the proposed project is based on experience and techniques \ndeveloped  by  the  Department  of  Soil  Conservation  and  Watershed  Management  (DSCWM), \nlessons  from  international  nongovernment  organizations  and  research  organizations,  and \ninternational and national experience in watershed management.13 It aims to tie in with Nepal\u2019s \nlocal adaptation plans of action on climate change.14 \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n8. \nThe expected impact will be that climate resilience in Nepal\u2019s mountain communities is \nimproved.  The  project\u2019s  outcome  will  be  that  selected  communities  that  are  significantly \nvulnerable  to  climate  change  have  access  to  more  reliable  water  resources.  About  45,000 \nhouseholds  are  expected  to  benefit  from  improved  water  availability  during  the  dry  season  to \nsupport  domestic  and  agricultural  uses.  The  spring  or  surface  water  sources  are  expected  to \nbecome more reliable; the dry season water yield will either remain the same or increase.  \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nTo  achieve  its  expected  outcome,  the  project  will  have  four  outputs:  (i)  participating \n9. \ncommunities  have  improved  catchment  management  and  new  or  improved  water  storage \ninfrastructure;  (ii)  communities  and  government  manage  water  and  land  in  an  integrated  and \ninclusive  manner  within  watersheds;  (iii)  government  adopts  knowledge-based  approaches  for \nintegrated  water  and  land  management  and  improved  water  reliability  and  accessibility  in  the \nwake of climate change; and (iv) project management support is provided. \n \n10.  Water  source  catchment  management  and  storage  infrastructure.  The  project  will \nbe  implemented  through  about  100  community-based  subprojects.  Communities  will  manage \ncatchment areas for development and protection of their water sources (springs and streams). \nThis  will  include:  (i)  protection  of  the  area  surrounding  the  water  source,  and  preparation  and \nimplementation of water source catchment management plans;15 (ii) treatment of gully erosion, \nand slope and landslide stabilization that threatens the water sources, water infrastructure, and \nbeneficiary  communities;  (iii)  construction  of  water  collection  chambers,  spring  boxes  or \ninfiltration galleries; (iv) construction of water conservation ponds and storage for irrigation and \n\n                                                \n11   International Water Management Institute.

Manila. \n13   Some  lessons  include  the  need  for  better  understanding  of  the  link  between  the  hydrologic  cycle  and  land \nmanagement,  planning  development  according  to  watershed  rather  than  administrative  boundaries,  and  a \nparticipatory planning approach. \n\n14   Under the Nepal Climate Change Support Programme of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment. \n15   Communities  will  establish  the  catchment  area  for  the  water  source  and  define  measures  to  manage  land  use, \nincluding regulating grazing, and fodder and firewood collection in the catchment. The executing agency will make \nagreements with community development groups on the responsibility of managing and protecting the catchment \narea, and introduce productive conservation measures such as planting of fruit and fodder trees and grass, and \nsustainable agroforestry. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\ninfrastructure  and  water-related  development \n\nlivestock; and (v) construction of drinking water storage tanks and tap stands. Water storage will \nhelp  sustain  the  use  of  limited  water  during  the  dry  season,  thereby  reducing  the  time  people \n(especially  women)  spend  collecting  water,  and  increasing  the  irrigated  agricultural  area. \nCatchment improvement measures will help stabilize or augment the yield of water sources. \n \n11. \nInclusive  and  integrated  management  of  water  and  land.  Implementation  of \nsubprojects  will  particularly  promote  water  conservation  in  the  catchment  areas  and  tackle \nshortage  issues that  result  in  additional  labor for  women  or  pose  difficulties for  disadvantaged \ngroups, who often have access only to less reliable water sources and suffer disproportionally in \ncase  of  water  shortage.  The  project  will  also  provide  participating  communities  with  education \nand facilitate programs on water conservation practices (including micro-irrigation), methods for \nmaintaining  soil  moisture  in  agriculture,  grazing  and  fodder  management,  and  ways  to \nregenerate  vegetative  cover.  The  project  will  strengthen  the  DSCWM\u2019s  capacity  in  sub-\nwatershed  management  planning  to  improve  water  security  and  boost  watershed  resilience. \nSub-watershed  management  plans  will  be  prepared  that  describe  the  watersheds\u2019  biophysical \nand  socioeconomic  conditions  and  challenges,  and  build  a  geographic  information  system \ninterventions. \ndatabase  of  existing  water \nCommunity-driven interventions for water source catchment management and enhancement will \nbe included. The watershed planning process will reinforce the DSCWM\u2019s capacity to determine \nand  monitor  priority  interventions,  and  the  department  can  use  the  geographic  information \nsystem database in planning its future programs. \n \n12. \nLessons  for  improving access  to  and reliability  of water resources. As the project \nwill  be  implemented  in  six  districts,  this  output  will  focus  on  documenting  and  sharing  lessons \nfrom  project  implementation  to  all  DSCWM  staff  through  strategic  and  targeted  technical \nassistance. A knowledge management plan will be implemented, with activities to document and \nincorporate  lessons  into  country  programs,  and  to  foster  knowledge  sharing  among  country \nstakeholders and in international climate change forums. The DSCWM\u2019s capacity to monitor the \nimpacts  of  project  interventions  will  be  strengthened  through  preparation  of  a  management \ninformation system and expertise in benefit monitoring and evaluation. Other evaluations will be \nconducted  on  pertinent  topics  such  as  changes  in  hydrology  due  to  catchment  management \nmeasures,  how  communities  negotiate  water  allocations,  behavioral  change  in  collective \nimpact \nmanagement  of \nassessments, and lessons will be shared globally as part of the SPCR\u2019s global learning support \nprogram. This output will be financed by the NDF. \n \nD. \n \n13. \n\ninterventions,  and  demand  management.

The  effects  of  climate  change  might  further  aggravate \nthe situation, as the amount and timing of rainfall is expected to be altered, there may be less \nsnow melt, and actual evapotranspiration may increase. Therefore, the project emphasizes the \nrestoration and protection of such catchment areas, along with building capacity of communities \nfor  catchment  management.  An  agreement  with  beneficiary  communities  to  create  catchment \nmanagement  areas  in  which  grazing  and  fodder  and  forest  products  are  regulated  will  be  a \nprecondition  for  project  assistance.  Catchment  restoration  and  protection  will  stabilize  and \n\n\fimprove  the  yield  of  local  water  sources  in  the  medium  term.  To  mitigate  acute  daily  water \nshortage  in  the  short  term,  the  project  will  provide  new  or  improved  water  intake  and  water \nstorage facilities where possible. To avoid failure and/or high operation and maintenance costs, \nthe  project  emphasizes  a  high  standard  of  design  and  construction  for  this  infrastructure. \nOperation  and  maintenance  plans  will  be  prepared  and  implemented  for  each  management \narea  within  a  subproject.  Soil  and  water  interventions  will  include  landslide  stabilization  and \ndrainage works, hill slope and gully erosion control, bioengineering works for slope stabilization, \nland  terracing,  water  intake  structures  such  as  spring  boxes  and  infiltration  galleries,  water \ntransmission  pipelines,  drinking  water  storage  tanks,  conservation  ponds,  water  storage  for \nirrigation,  and  water  troughs  for  livestock.  Organizing  and  training  of  the  local  community  for \ncatchment  management  and  maintenance  of  the  new  or  improved  infrastructure  will  be \nincorporated into the early stages of subproject development. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n18. \nThe  economic  and  financial  analyses  focused  on  the  economic  feasibility  of  three \nsample  subprojects.18 For  all  three,  quantified  benefits  were  assessed  by  comparing  present \ncrop  production  with  the  production  expected  after  the  introduction  of  new  or  more  reliable \nirrigation water supply through the development of water storage facilities. For the Dadeldhura \nand Doti subprojects, benefits also accrue from the time savings for households collecting water \nduring  the  dry  season.  The  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  estimated  for  the  three \nsubprojects are 14.2% for Bajura, 21.4% for Dadeldhura, and 14.9% for Doti. All are not highly \nsensitive to changes in key cost and benefit variables, but for Bajura and Doti some changes of \nkey variables tested in the sensitivity analysis lead to EIRRs below 12%. In particular, the EIRR \nof  the  Doti  subproject  would  decrease  to  11.2%  if  costs  increased  by  10%  and  benefits  were \nreduced by  10% throughout the  project  life.  Under the  same  scenario, the  EIRR  of the  Bajura \nsubproject  would  decrease  to  10.7%,  and  to  10.8%  if  only  80%  of  the  command  area  were \ndeveloped, and to 11.9% if benefits were delayed 1 year. The subprojects remain viable since \nsignificant benefits have not been quantified. \n\n19. \nThe  project  is  expected  to  benefit  at  least  45,000  households  with  more  reliable  water \nresources for irrigation, drinking, and other domestic uses, or for livestock, especially during the \ndry  season.  Other  households  will  benefit  from  measures  to  improve  the  reliability  of  water \nsources,  stabilize  eroding  and  unstable  areas,  and  other  similar  interventions.  Together  these \nmeasures will improve the resilience of watersheds and those living in them to changing climatic \nconditions.  Communities  will  contribute  commitment  money  before  the  interventions  are \nconstructed, and these funds will be set aside for major repairs, and operation and maintenance \nof  infrastructure.  Communities  will  be  responsible  for  operation  and  maintenance  of  any \ninfrastructure after project implementation.  \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n20. \nThe  project  supports  local  governance,  financial,  and  administrative  decentralization, \nand oversight of public development expenditure by deepening transparency and accountability \nof  public  service  delivery  through  local  government  units  that  select  and  manage  their  own \nsubprojects,  and  by  building  the  capacity  of  the  DSCWM  and  its  district  offices  for  financial \ndiscipline, responsibility, transparency, and accountability. A financial management assessment \nof the DSCWM was conducted, and a risk assessment and risk management plan is included in \n\n                                                \n18   Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nthe linked documents.19 The assessment concluded that the DSCWM's capacity is sufficient to \ncarry out the project with training and oversight from ADB. The project aims to support the post-\nconflict  approach  outlined  in  the  country  partnership  strategy  by  identifying  and  managing \npotential conflict risks and opportunities.20 \n\n21. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  DSCWM.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual.21 \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n22. \nThe  project  will  provide  the  infrastructure  needed  for  increased  agricultural  production \nand  small-scale  market  gardening,  thereby  improving  food  security  and  income.  It  will  reduce \nthe  time  spent  (mainly  by  women)  collecting  drinking  water.  Other  disadvantaged  groups \n(mainly  Dalit)  will  be  particular  beneficiaries  as  the  project  will  give  priority  to  the  protection, \nenhancement,  and  development  of  the  less  reliable  water  sources  currently  used  by  these \ngroups.  Participatory  planning  processes  will  improve  social  harmony.  Improvements  in \ncommunity  health  are  anticipated  from  better  water  supplies  and  greater  food  security.  The \nproject  is  classified  as  having  an  effective  gender  mainstreaming  theme.  A  gender  and  social \ninclusion plan has been made an integral part of the project design and is covered by one of the \ncovenants.22  \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment  as  it  is  unlikely \n23. \nthat any proposed subprojects will lead to any irreversible damage. Any subproject that may be \nscreened  as  category  A  will  not  be  financed.  The  project  has  been  designed  specifically  to \nmanage  the  impacts  of  climate  change  on  mountainous  communities,  and  potential  impacts \nfrom  climate  change  and  natural  disasters  on  the  project  and  its  proposed  interventions  have \nbeen  screened.23 Water  balances  under  past  and  future  climate  conditions  were  assessed  for \nthe subbasin that hosts the project area to determine the impact of proposed interventions on its \nhydrology.24 Most project interventions will result in positive impacts on the environment, as the \nproject  will  support  the  protection  of  catchment  areas  and  water  sources,  and  improve \ngroundwater recharge. Construction of ponds for irrigation may result in a few negative impacts \nthat  can  easily  be  mitigated.  Once  locations  for  these  ponds  have  been  determined  and \nenvironmental  screening  has  concluded  that  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  are \ndeemed necessary, IEEs will be conducted for the establishment of these ponds. The number of \nIEEs to be conducted will be based on the number and location of ponds. If several ponds are to \nbe  constructed  within  a  subcatchment,  one  IEE  may  assess  the  impacts  of  a  cluster  of  these \nponds.  The  exact  number  of  IEEs  will  be  determined  once  the  subprojects  are  finalized.  The \napproved  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework,  as  disclosed  on  ADB  website, \n\n                                                \n19   Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20   Nepal  Post-Conflict  Sensitive  Approach:  A  Peace-Building  Tool  (Peace  Filter)  for  Project  Design  and \n\nImplementation (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n21  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22   Gender Action Plan: Gender and Social Inclusion Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n\n2). \n\n2). \n\n23   Disaster and Climate Change Risk Screening Results (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n\n24   Five general circulation models were downscaled using three regional climate models for Nepal under ADB. 2008. \nTechnical  Assistance  to  Nepal  for  Strengthening  Capacity  for  Managing  Climate  Change  and  the  Environment. \nManila (TA 7173-NEP). \n\n\fprovides  guidance  on  categorization  and  procedures  to  be  followed  during  implementation.25 \nContracts for subprojects that require environmental assessments will be awarded only after the \napproval  of  the  IEEs  and  environmental  management  plans  by  ADB  and  the  government  (if \nrequired), and will form part of the contract documents. \n\n24. \nInvoluntary  resettlement. The  project  is  categorized  as  C.  It  is  designed  to be  based \non voluntary donation of land, on demand from the rural communities. A voluntary land donation \nframework has been prepared to help assess the involuntary resettlement safeguard status of a \nproposed  subproject  and  confirm  that  the  selection  criteria  involving  the  voluntary  donation  of \nland  has  been  met.  Any  subproject  requiring  involuntary  land  acquisition  will  be  dropped.  The \nselection criteria for a subproject is that irrigation improvement is desired by a community whose \nmembers  would  voluntarily  donate  small  parcels  of  their  land  (up  to  10%  of  their  agricultural \nlandholding)  for  the  irrigation  improvement.  By  contributing  land  for  the  project  they  become \nprimary  beneficiaries  of  an  enhanced  irrigation  facility.  For  each  subproject  with  requirements \nfor  new  land,  procedures  have  been  established  to  verify  that  the  land  is  being  provided \nvoluntarily  by  those  who  stand  to  gain  directly,  and  to  verify  that  the  subproject  will  cause  no \nimpoverishment or displacement of tenants or bonded labor, and the subproject activity will not \ninvolve land that is traditionally owned or customarily used by indigenous peoples. Resettlement \ndue diligence will also ensure that meaningful consultation has taken place in good faith with all \naffected  persons. The  land  donation  will  be  verified  by  witnesses  and  documented. There  is  a \nprovision  for  a  grievance  redress mechanism,  mainly  to  solve  issues  of  coercion  for  voluntary \ndonation of land, and for donation of land that exceeds 10% of a donor's agricultural land. \n\n25. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  categorized  as  C.  The  communities  where  the \npotential  schemes  are  located  are  almost  exclusively  Chhetri  and/or  Brahman  and  Dalit,  and \nhave  insignificant  Janajati  (indigenous  people)  presence.  The  Janajati  individuals  have  mostly \nmoved  into  the  project  area  during  the  road  development  and  are  found  scattered  along  the \nroad. They do not constitute a community and are generally not a part of the agrarian system in \nthe project area. An indigenous peoples impact-screening checklist has been prepared that will \nbe  used  for  each  proposed  subproject  to  screen  out  any  subproject  that  will  have  negative \nimpact  on  indigenous  peoples\u2019  communities.  A  few  members  of  an  endangered,  nomadic, \nindigenous  peoples group\u2014the  Raute\u2014occasionally  visit  the  project  area  in  Achham  and  Doti \ndistricts.  To  minimize  their  vulnerability  and  to  conserve  the  natural  resource  niche  that  their \nmarginal  livelihood  depends  on,  the  project  has  included,  as  part  of  the  subproject  selection \ncriteria, avoidance of project water storage interventions in land where the Raute are known to \ncamp, even though untapped water sources may exist.26 \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n26.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.27  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nDSCWM  and  DSCOs  are  unfamiliar  with  ADB\u2019s \ndisbursement  procedures.
