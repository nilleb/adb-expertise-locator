The project will build or improve a total of 5 kilometers of covered \nelevated walkways around the four stations. Elevators will be attached to the elevated walkways \nto  address  the  needs  of  the  elderly,  pregnant  women,  persons  with  disabilities  (PWDs),  and \npeople  traveling  with small  children.  The  elevated  walkways  will  be  connected  to  mass transit \nstations  to  help  promote  the  use  of  public  transport.  The  project  is  a  part  of  Department  of \nTransportation (DOTr) efforts promote walking as zero emission transport and develops flagship \nwalkway projects known as Greenways projects.2\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nII.\n\nTHE PROJECT\n\n3.\nGrowing demand for transport. The Philippines\u2019 inadequate transport infrastructure has\nweighed  down  the  country\u2019s  ability  to  compete  regionally  and  globally.  This  is  reflected  in  the\ncountry\u2019s ranking on the Logistics Performance Index published by the World Bank, which steadily\ndeteriorated  from  44th  in  2010  to  71st  in  2016.3 Owing  to  major  efforts  of  the  government  to\naddress the huge infrastructure backlog, the overall ranking has improved to 60th in 2018. As a\nresult of consistent underspending on public infrastructure, the Philippine\u2019s public capital stock as\nof  2015  was  the  lowest  among  members  of  ASEAN. 4  To  address  this  shortcoming,  the \ngovernment  in  2017  launched  the  comprehensive  Build,  Build,  Build  (BBB)  infrastructure \ndevelopment program, which aims to attract investments, provide improved connectivity, and spur \neconomic growth through infrastructure development.5 \n\n4.\nThe recent improvement and expansion of the transport systems are still inadequate to\nkeep up with the growing demand for transport, especially in urban areas such as Metro Manila.\nCommuters continue to shift to private vehicles because of a lack of reliable and convenient public\ntransport  and  poor  infrastructure  for  non-motorized  transport.  The  quality  and  performance  of\npublic  transport  and  supporting  infrastructures  thus  require  significant  improvement.  The\nproposed project is closely aligned with these efforts and included in the BBB program.\n\n5.\nWorsening  traffic  on  Epifanio  de  los  Santos  Avenue.  EDSA  is  the  most  congested\nroad in Metro Manila. The Metro Manila Development Authority reported that annual average daily\n\n1  Metro Manila, also known as the National Capital Region, includes the city of Manila and 16 surrounding suburbs.  \n2  Government of the Philippines, National Economic and Development Authority. 2018. National Transport Policy and \n\nits Implementing Rules and Regulations. Manila.   \n\n3  World Bank. https://lpi.worldbank.org. \n4  The public capital stock of the Philippines was 35% of gross domestic product in 2015, significantly below the ASEAN \n\naverage of 69%. \n\n5  Philippine Infrastructure Transparency Portal. Build, Build, Build. \n\n\f2 \n\ntraffic on EDSA reached 405,882 vehicles per day in 2019.6 The worsening traffic congestion has \ncaused a myriad of problems. Daily economic losses because of congestion are estimated at \u20b12.1\nbillion, which could rise to \u20b13.3 billion a day in 2035 if no action is taken.7 Deteriorating air quality\nand road safety are also causes for concern. To reverse these negative trends and improve the \ntransport system, the government has been expanding urban rail networks in Metro Manila, with \nprojects  including  the  Metro  Manila  Subway,  the  North\u2013South  Commuter  Railway,  Metro  Rail\nTransit (MRT) lines 4 and 7, and the extension of Light Rail Transit (LRT) lines 1 and 2.8 Creating \nconvenient and attractive interchanges within and among public transport modes will encourage \ngreater use of public transport, leading to reduced traffic congestion. \n\n6.\nPoor  pedestrian  facilities.  Pedestrians  are  the  most  vulnerable  road  users.  Of  the\nrecorded traffic accidents in Metro Manila, pedestrians account for more than 40% of annual traffic\nfatalities on average.9 Facilities designed to accommodate pedestrian needs are severely lacking.\nImproving pedestrian safety while reducing conflict at the street level between pedestrians and\nmotor vehicles is a pressing issue. Resolving this issue will require adequate provision of space\nand facilities to support improved pedestrian safety and comfort, such as separating pedestrians\nfrom  traffic  through  elevated  walkways.  Existing  pedestrian  facilities  are  poorly  designed  and\nhighly  unsafe  for  walking.  Pedestrian  walkways  are  narrow,  lack  adequate  protection  from  the\nelements  (e.g.,  rain  and  direct  sunlight),  and  are  not  well-connected.  In  addition,  security  is\nundermined by a lack of lighting to ensure safe walkability at night. Pedestrian-friendly measures\naround mass transit stations are required to improve comfort and safety for pedestrians.\n\n7.\nEnhanced mobility for all. Government priorities have been shifting to people-mobility\nover vehicle-mobility to improve inclusive mobility and accessibility (footnote 2). Physical design\nfeatures that are friendly to women, the elderly, PWDs, and people traveling with small children\nare  required  to  improve  the  pedestrian  environment.  These  features  can  vary  according  to\nexpected number of users, and can include features such as elevators, ramps, sufficient space\nfor people movement, and adequate lighting. The project will adopt a people-friendly approach to\nenhance the pedestrian experience for all types of users, irrespective of age, gender, or mobility.\n\n8.\nAlignment  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030.  The  project  supports  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030,  as\nsummarized in Table 1.10 The project is also in line with the country partnership strategy 2018-\n2023 by supporting its strategic pillar 1: accelerating infrastructure and long-term investment.11\n\nTable 1: Strategy 2030 Operational Priorities and Project\u2019s Contribution\n\nProject\u2019s Contributions\n\nStrategy 2030  \nOperational Priorities \nAccelerating progress in gender \nequality (OP2) \n\nThe project will promote safety and mobility for women in urban infrastructure in \nMetro Manila and support gender equality by encouraging contractors to \nincrease employment opportunities for women in all stages of civil works. \n\n6  Metro Manila Development Authority. 2020.

While the project was planned much earlier, it will \nsupport the Philippines\u2019 recovery from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The civil \nworks contracts will be awarded in the first half of 2021. The project will create 2.8 million person-\ndays  of  jobs  in  Metro  Manila,  and  local  materials  equivalent  to  \u20b13.0  billion  will  be  purchased \nthrough the civil works contracts. The developed walkways will encourage walking and will also \nprovide  covered  space  for  queuing  for  public  transport  users,  with  proper  social  distancing \nprocedures to deal with any future pandemics. \n \nB. \n \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  Inclusive  mobility  and  accessibility \n10. \nachieved  through  the  prioritization  of  people-mobility  over  vehicle-mobility  (footnote  2).  The \nproject  will  have  the  following  outcome:  number  of  pedestrians  increased,  and  pedestrian \nexperience improved.12 \n  \n11. \nOutput:  Pedestrian  walkways  built.  The  project  will  build  a  total  of  5  kilometers  of \nelevated walkways, including construction of new disaster-resilient walkways and replacement or \nwidening of existing footbridges at four locations along EDSA: Balintawak, Cubao, Guadalupe, \nand  Taft  stations.  The  elevated  walkways  will  be  covered  and  properly  lit.  Elevators  will  be \nattached to the elevated walkways to address the needs of the elderly, pregnant women, PWDs, \nand people traveling with small children. \n \nC. \n \n12. \nSince 2017, ADB has supported the government to accelerate preparation and improve \nthe  quality  of  the  BBB  program  (footnote  5).  ADB\u2019s  Infrastructure  Preparation  and  Innovation \nFacility (IPIF) and other complementary technical assistance are providing support in identification \nof  priority  projects,  feasibility  studies,  designs,  tender  process,  and  capacity  development  of \nimplementing agencies.13 ADB\u2019s continuous support has helped to accelerate project preparation \nand  contributed  to  improve  the  quality  of  projects.

While the MRT-3 Rehabilitation Project will increase the capacity \nof the MRT-3, the proposed project will improve pedestrian environment to promote the use of \nthe MRT-3. \n \n\nBox: Noteworthy Features of the Project \n\u2022  The project will improve current poor pedestrian environment in the four project areas along Epifanio \nde los Santos Avenue (EDSA) through building and/or improving a total of 5 kilometers of elevated \nwalkways.  The elevated walkways will be connected to mass transit stations to help promote the use \nof public transport.  \n\n\u2022  Elevators will be attached to the  elevated walkways to address the needs of the elderly, pregnant \nwomen, persons with disabilities, and people traveling with small children. The elevated walkways will \nhave  a  roof  protecting  pedestrians  from  direct  sunlight  and  rains  and  be  equipped  with  sufficient \nlighting and monitoring cameras to provide a safe and secure pedestrian environment.  \n\n\u2022  Disaster resilience is embedded in the designs to ensure hazard-resistant structures. \n\u2022  The project areas are highly urbanized along one of the busiest corridors in the Philippines. Intensive \nassessments  and  consultations  with  stakeholders  for  the  design  and  construction  plan  have  been \nundertaken,  so  that  the  elevated  walkways  can  be  built  and/or  improved  without  sacrificing  traffic \nlanes on EDSA after construction, and with minimum traffic disturbance during construction.  \n\n\u2022  The project includes measures to ensure sustainable operation and maintenance (O&M) of the project \nfacilities. The elevated walkways will have space for advertisements and small kiosks, and the income \ngenerated from these is projected to be more than sufficient to cover the costs of routine O&M. The \nDepartment of Transportation will also make arrangements with private sector entities, government-\nowned and controlled corporations, and/or local government units for continuous routine O&M. \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n \nD. \n \n14. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $179.3  million  (Table  2).

The  civil  works  will  be \nprocured  through  design  and  build  contracts,  and  the  contractors  will  finalize  the  detailed \nengineering design based on the schematic design.  \n \n21. \nSince EDSA is one of the busiest corridors in Metro Manila and the project sites are highly \nurbanized  with  only  narrow  sidewalks,  the  consultants  conducted  intensive  assessments  and \nprepared plans to relocate public utilities and traffic management before and during construction \nas well as coordinating these plans with other ongoing and/or planned infrastructure projects in \nthe same areas. Elevated walkways will be built overhanging to EDSA carriageway with cantilever \nstructure to create additional space for pedestrians without sacrificing congested traffic lanes of \nEDSA. Although the cantilever structure requires larger foundations, the consultants developed \nthe reference construction plan which will allow the constructions to be done within the restricted \nspace on EDSA. To minimize the disturbance to EDSA traffic during construction, the reference \nconstruction plan adopted a twenty-four hour construction scheme. These factors have increased \ncost implications that has been factored in the cost estimate.  \n\n \n\n22. \nThe sites are in proximity to the West Valley Fault and are exposed to multiple hazards \nincluding earthquakes, liquefaction, tsunamis, and floods18 Disaster resilience is being embedded \nin the schematic designs to ensure hazard-resistant structures, and will also be taken into account \nin the detailed engineering designs. The elevated walkways will have a width of 5 meters with a \nroof protecting pedestrians from direct sunlight and rain. The elevated walkways will be equipped \n\n18 The West Valley Fault  cuts through six cities of Metro Manila: Makati,  Marikina, Muntinlupa, Pasig, Quezon, and \n\n \n\nTaguig. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nSustainability \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\nwith  sufficient  lighting  and  monitoring  cameras  to  provide  a  safe  and  secure  pedestrian \nenvironment.  The  environment  underneath  the  elevated  walkways  will  be  also  improved  by \nrefurbishing pavement and providing lightings.  \n \nThe impact of COVID-19 is evolving. The project will be responsive and flexible in meeting \n23. \nemerging  needs  and  new  best  practices  in  construction.  The  implementing  agency,  the \nconstruction supervision consultants, and the contractor will incorporate emerging international \nconstruction  best  practices  on  managing  COVID-19  risks.  Such  practices  will  also  consider \ngovernment guidance on safe working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \nB. \n \nEconomic and financial analyses undertaken concluded that the project is economically \n24. \nviable  and  financially  sustainable.  The  main  benefit  of  the  project  is  an  improved  pedestrian \nexperience,  reflected  in  shorter  perceived  travel  times  for  pedestrians.  The  overall  economic \ninternal rate of return of the project is estimated to be 21.8%. Each of the four project locations is \neconomically  viable,  with  economic  rates  of  return  exceeding  10.0%.19 The  project\u2019s  elevated \nwalkways will not be tolled and the government will shoulder the capital cost. \n  \nC. \n \n25. \nThe DOTr will own the constructed walkways and be primarily responsible for operation \nand  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the  walkways.  The  elevated  walkways  will  have  space  for \nadvertisements and small kiosks, and the income generated from these is projected to be more \nthan sufficient to cover the costs of routine O&M. The DOTr will make arrangements with private \nsector entities, government-owned and controlled corporations and/or local government units for \ncontinuous  routine  O&M.  The  DOTr  has  experience  in  O&M  of  public  transport  assets  and  in \nmaking arrangements with private companies to build connections between MRT-3 stations and \nprivately owned facilities.20 \n \nD. \n \nThe financial management assessment was prepared following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \n26. \nFinancial Management and Analysis of Projects, Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note, \nand related technical guidance notes.21 The assessment found that the DOTr has sound financial \nand accounting systems; adheres to the procedures, manuals, policies, guidelines, and reporting \nframework prescribed by the Commission on Audit of the Government of the Philippines; follows \naccrual-based  accounting  using  an  Enterprise  Resource  Planning  system  based  on  the \nPhilippines  Public  Sector  Accounting  Standards;  and  has  an  internal  control  system  with  a \nseparate  internal  audit  division.  The  assessed  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is \nsubstantial, mainly because an insufficient number of DOTr staff are capable of accounting and \ninternal auditing.

ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and the DOTr. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \nE. \n \n28. \nThe  project  will  improve  the  pedestrian  environment  and  facilitate  access  to  public \ntransport. Public transport users and pedestrians are the beneficiaries of the project, and they are \nlargely  from  poor  and  vulnerable  segments.  Better  access  to  public  transport  and  improved \npedestrian  safety  will  directly  improve  users\u2019  quality  of  life.  Particular  attention  will  be  given to \nensuring  suitable  design  features  for  PWDs,  women,  the  elderly,  and  people  traveling  with \nsmall children. \n \n29. \nGender action plan. The project, categorized as effective gender mainstreaming, seeks \nto  address  the  following  gender  issues:  (i)  inaccessible,  unsafe,  and  inconvenient  pedestrian \nfacilities for women and marginalized groups (elderly, PWDs, children, and sexual minorities); (ii) \nunequal  access  to  women  and  marginalized  sectors,  compared  with  able-bodied  men,  to \nemployment  opportunities  generated  by  the  project;  and  (iii)  sexual  exploitation,  abuse,  and \nharassment committed during civil works construction and in overall project implementation. Key \ngender  action  plan  (GAP)  activities  include  (i)  integration  of  physical  design  features  to  make \ninfrastructure accessible, convenient, and safe for all users (e.g., glass elevators, barricades, grab \nrails, tactile surfaces and signage, provisions for passive surveillance, rest areas, and greenery); \n(ii)  proactive  participation  of  women  and  PWDs  in  employment  opportunities  created  by  the \nproject, and ensuring gender-sensitive and inclusive workplaces for them; (iii) awareness-raising \nand  setting  up  of  mechanisms  to  protect  women,  children,  sexual  minorities,  and  elderly  from \nsexual  exploitation,  abuse,  and  other  gender-based  violence  in  the  context  of  the  project\u2019s \nconstruction  of  civil  works  and  overall  project  implementation;  and  (iv)  ensuring  effective  GAP \nimplementation  and  sustainability  of  gains.  The  GAP  was  informed  by  extensive  consultations \nwith stakeholders including civil society groups representing women, children, the elderly, PWDs, \nand the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender communities. Its final formulation is the outcome \nof  a  series  of  workshops  and  discussions  with  government  counterparts,  including  the  DOTr \nGender and Development Focal Point System for Road Sector. \n \n30. \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking. Transport and road projects pose a potential increase \nin HIV/AIDS and human trafficking cases, as they involve an influx of workers during construction. \nThe  construction  supervision  consultants  will  be  tasked  to  design  and  implement  information \ndissemination activities to raise awareness of sexual harassment, sexually transmitted diseases, \nHIV/AIDS, human trafficking prevention, city ordinances on women and gender and PWDs, and \ngender and disability sensitivity. The construction supervision consultants will raise the awareness \nof all contractors\u2019 workers and residents of surrounding barangays of the four stations on gender \nequality and social inclusion in transport and infrastructure.23   \n\n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Barangay is the smallest public administrative division in the Philippines. Cities and municipalities are subdivided \n\n \n\n \n\ninto barangays. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nF. \n \n31. \ncategories are as follows.24  \n \n32. \nEnvironment (category B). The project is classified category B for environment under \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  An  initial  environmental  examination  was  prepared  and \ndisclosed on the project website.25 Under the Philippine Environmental Impact Statement System, \nthe project is not subject to an environmental compliance certificate.26 The project is expected to \ngenerate  significant  public  health  and  well-being  benefits  by  promoting  safe,  all-weather, \ninclusive, and zero-emission pedestrian transport facilities. The project will promote diversion of \npassengers  from  vehicular  modes  to  walking  and  will  reduce  carbon  dioxide  emissions  by  an \nestimated  886  tons  per  year.  Some  adverse  impacts  on  environment  are  anticipated  during \nproject implementation, primarily construction noise and dust, temporary traffic disturbances, and \ncommunity and occupational safety hazard during construction. These impacts and risks will be \ntemporary  and  site-specific  and  can  readily  be  mitigated  to  acceptable  levels  through  good \nconstruction  practices  and  standard  mitigation  measures  outlined  in  the  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP). The EMP will be a part of the bidding documents for the civil works. \nThe PMO, with the support of project management consultants to be hired under the A loan, will \nhave primary responsibility to ensure that contractors comply with the provisions of the EMP and \nthe  environmental  regulatory  framework  of  the  Philippines.  PMO  staff  will  be  trained  in \nenvironmental  safeguard  requirements  through  ADB  technical  assistance.27 Meaningful  public \nconsultations  involving  243  people  confirmed  broad  community  support  for  the  project. \nCommunity concerns and complaints will be promptly addressed through the project\u2019s grievance \nredress mechanism (para. 34). \n \n33. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for \ninvoluntary resettlement under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Resettlement impacts have \nbeen  minimized  by  confining  the  design  and  construction  works  within  the  road  right-of-way. \nAbout  250  affected  persons  have  been  identified  in  the  four  station  areas,  including  ambulant \nvendors and private individual landowners. With respect to the total land to be acquired (6,430 \nsquare meters), about 26.5% (1,705 square meters) belong to private individuals and corporations \nor 13 affected persons, the rest being public and/or government land. Of the 13 affected persons, \nonly  three  (two  corporations  and  one  individual)  will  lose  10%  or  more  of  their  lands.  Four \nresettlement plans have been prepared\u2014one for each of the four walkway locations. The plans \nespouse  both  national  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  to \naddress  the  following  involuntary  resettlement  impacts:  (i)  permanent  loss  of  land  from  public \n(government  and  government  corporations)  and  private  (individuals  and corporations)  entities; \n(ii) permanent  damage  to  secondary  private  and  community  structures  mostly  made  of  semi-\npermanent  materials  and  public  utility  structures;  (iii)  temporary  loss  of  access  to  business \nestablishments  during  construction  works  and  disruption  of  city  services  because  of  required \nrelocation  of  electric  posts;  (iv)  temporary  physical  displacement  of  ambulant  vendors  to \nalternative  selling  sites and  displacement of  one  homeless individual;  and (v)  disruption  of  city \nservices because of required relocation of electric posts. \n \n\n \n\n24 ADB.

The schematic design-based resettlement plans will reflect results of surveys including \nindependent  property  appraisals  and  detailed  measurement  surveys.28 The  resettlement  plans \nmitigate  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  by  providing  compensation  at  replacement  cost. \nMeasures have been incorporated to improve the living standards of vulnerable affected people \nspecifically through special assistance and livelihood restoration actions. As the DOTr has limited \nexperience in implementing resettlement plans, ADB will provide capacity development training \nunder ADB technical assistance (footnote 13) for staff of the Environment, Social and Right-of-\nWay  Division  on  provisions  of  the  resettlement  plans  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009).  A grievance redress mechanism for resettlement and environmental issues has been put \nin place. The government will finance implementation of the resettlement plans. The resettlement \nplans have been disclosed on ADB\u2019s website and to affected households. \n \n35. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).
