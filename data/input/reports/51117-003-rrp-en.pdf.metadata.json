THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \nfrom the ordinary capital resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (A loan), and (ii) a \nproposed loan funded through the participation of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN) Infrastructure Fund (B loan) under the ASEAN Catalytic Green Finance Facility, both to \nthe Republic of the Philippines for the Epifanio de los Santos Avenue Greenways Project.\n2. The project aims to improve the pedestrian environment in four areas (the Balintawak, \nCubao, Guadalupe, and Taft mass transit stations) along Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA), \na major artery in Metro Manila.1 Existing pedestrian facilities on EDSA are poorly designed, \nuncomfortable, and unsafe. The project will build or improve a total of 5 kilometers of covered \nelevated walkways around the four stations. Elevators will be attached to the elevated walkways \nto address the needs of the elderly, pregnant women, persons with disabilities (PWDs), and \npeople traveling with small children. The elevated walkways will be connected to mass transit \nstations to help promote the use of public transport. The project is a part of Department of \nTransportation (DOTr) efforts promote walking as zero emission transport and develops flagship \nwalkway projects known as Greenways projects.2\nII. THE PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n3. Growing demand for transport. The Philippines\u2019 inadequate transport infrastructure has\nweighed down the country\u2019s ability to compete regionally and globally. This is reflected in the\ncountry\u2019s ranking on the Logistics Performance Index published by the World Bank, which steadily\ndeteriorated from 44th in 2010 to 71st in 2016.3 Owing to major efforts of the government to\naddress the huge infrastructure backlog, the overall ranking has improved to 60th in 2018. As a\nresult of consistent underspending on public infrastructure, the Philippine\u2019s public capital stock as\nof  2015  was  the  lowest  among  members  of  ASEAN.4 To  address  this  shortcoming,  the \ngovernment  in  2017  launched  the  comprehensive  Build,  Build,  Build  (BBB)  infrastructure \ndevelopment program, which aims to attract investments, provide improved connectivity, and spur \neconomic growth through infrastructure development.5 \n4. The recent improvement and expansion of the transport systems are still inadequate to\nkeep up with the growing demand for transport, especially in urban areas such as Metro Manila.\nCommuters continue to shift to private vehicles because of a lack of reliable and convenient public\ntransport and poor infrastructure for non-motorized transport. The quality and performance of\npublic  transport  and  supporting  infrastructures  thus  require  significant  improvement.  The\nproposed project is closely aligned with these efforts and included in the BBB program.\n5. Worsening traffic on Epifanio de los Santos Avenue. EDSA is the most congested\nroad in Metro Manila. The Metro Manila Development Authority reported that annual average daily\n1  Metro Manila, also known as the National Capital Region, includes the city of Manila and 16 surrounding suburbs.  \n2  Government of the Philippines, National Economic and Development Authority. 2018. National Transport Policy and \nits Implementing Rules and Regulations. Manila.   \n3  World Bank. https://lpi.worldbank.org. \n4  The public capital stock of the Philippines was 35% of gross domestic product in 2015, significantly below the ASEAN \naverage of 69%. \n5  Philippine Infrastructure Transparency Portal. Build, Build, Build. ", "2 \ntraffic on EDSA reached 405,882 vehicles per day in 2019.6 The worsening traffic congestion has \ncaused a myriad of problems. Daily economic losses because of congestion are estimated at \u20b12.1\nbillion, which could rise to \u20b13.3 billion a day in 2035 if no action is taken.7 Deteriorating air quality\nand road safety are also causes for concern. To reverse these negative trends and improve the \ntransport system, the government has been expanding urban rail networks in Metro Manila, with \nprojects including the Metro Manila Subway, the North\u2013South Commuter Railway, Metro Rail\nTransit (MRT) lines 4 and 7, and the extension of Light Rail Transit (LRT) lines 1 and 2.8 Creating \nconvenient and attractive interchanges within and among public transport modes will encourage \ngreater use of public transport, leading to reduced traffic congestion. \n6. Poor pedestrian facilities. Pedestrians are the most vulnerable road users. Of the\nrecorded traffic accidents in Metro Manila, pedestrians account for more than 40% of annual traffic\nfatalities on average.9 Facilities designed to accommodate pedestrian needs are severely lacking.\nImproving pedestrian safety while reducing conflict at the street level between pedestrians and\nmotor vehicles is a pressing issue. Resolving this issue will require adequate provision of space\nand facilities to support improved pedestrian safety and comfort, such as separating pedestrians\nfrom traffic through elevated walkways. Existing pedestrian facilities are poorly designed and\nhighly unsafe for walking. Pedestrian walkways are narrow, lack adequate protection from the\nelements (e.g., rain and direct sunlight), and are not well-connected. In addition, security is\nundermined by a lack of lighting to ensure safe walkability at night. Pedestrian-friendly measures\naround mass transit stations are required to improve comfort and safety for pedestrians.\n7. Enhanced mobility for all. Government priorities have been shifting to people-mobility\nover vehicle-mobility to improve inclusive mobility and accessibility (footnote 2). Physical design\nfeatures that are friendly to women, the elderly, PWDs, and people traveling with small children\nare required to improve the pedestrian environment. These features can vary according to\nexpected number of users, and can include features such as elevators, ramps, sufficient space\nfor people movement, and adequate lighting. The project will adopt a people-friendly approach to\nenhance the pedestrian experience for all types of users, irrespective of age, gender, or mobility.\n8. Alignment with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. The project supports ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, as\nsummarized in Table 1.10 The project is also in line with the country partnership strategy 2018-\n2023 by supporting its strategic pillar 1: accelerating infrastructure and long-term investment.11\nTable 1: Strategy 2030 Operational Priorities and Project\u2019s Contribution\nStrategy 2030   Project\u2019s Contributions\nOperational Priorities \nAccelerating progress in gender  The project will promote safety and mobility for women in urban infrastructure in \nequality (OP2)  Metro Manila and support gender equality by encouraging contractors to \nincrease employment opportunities for women in all stages of civil works. \n6  Metro Manila Development Authority. 2020.

Recovery from coronavirus disease. While the project was planned much earlier, it will \nsupport the Philippines\u2019 recovery from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The civil \nworks contracts will be awarded in the first half of 2021. The project will create 2.8 million person-\ndays of jobs in Metro Manila, and local materials equivalent to \u20b13.0 billion will be purchased \nthrough the civil works contracts. The developed walkways will encourage walking and will also \nprovide covered space for queuing for public transport users, with proper social distancing \nprocedures to deal with any future pandemics. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n10.  The  project  is  aligned with  the  following  impact:  Inclusive mobility  and  accessibility \nachieved through the prioritization of people-mobility over vehicle-mobility (footnote 2). The \nproject  will  have  the  following  outcome:  number  of  pedestrians  increased,  and  pedestrian \nexperience improved.12 \n  \n11.  Output: Pedestrian walkways built. The project will build a total of 5 kilometers of \nelevated walkways, including construction of new disaster-resilient walkways and replacement or \nwidening of existing footbridges at four locations along EDSA: Balintawak, Cubao, Guadalupe, \nand Taft stations. The elevated walkways will be covered and properly lit. Elevators will be \nattached to the elevated walkways to address the needs of the elderly, pregnant women, PWDs, \nand people traveling with small children. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n12.  Since 2017, ADB has supported the government to accelerate preparation and improve \nthe quality of the BBB program (footnote 5). ADB\u2019s Infrastructure Preparation and Innovation \nFacility (IPIF) and other complementary technical assistance are providing support in identification \nof priority projects, feasibility studies, designs, tender process, and capacity development of \nimplementing agencies.13 ADB\u2019s continuous support has helped to accelerate project preparation \nand contributed to improve the quality of projects.

The project will have synergies with the MRT-3 Rehabilitation Project implemented by the \nDOTr and financed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency.14 Three out of the four project \nareas include MRT-3 stations. While the MRT-3 Rehabilitation Project will increase the capacity \nof the MRT-3, the proposed project will improve pedestrian environment to promote the use of \nthe MRT-3. \n \nBox: Noteworthy Features of the Project \n\u2022  The project will improve current poor pedestrian environment in the four project areas along Epifanio \nde los Santos Avenue (EDSA) through building and/or improving a total of 5 kilometers of elevated \nwalkways.  The elevated walkways will be connected to mass transit stations to help promote the use \nof public transport.  \n\u2022  Elevators will be attached to the elevated walkways to address the needs of the elderly, pregnant \nwomen, persons with disabilities, and people traveling with small children. The elevated walkways will \nhave a roof protecting pedestrians from direct sunlight and rains and be equipped with sufficient \nlighting and monitoring cameras to provide a safe and secure pedestrian environment.  \n\u2022  Disaster resilience is embedded in the designs to ensure hazard-resistant structures. \n\u2022  The project areas are highly urbanized along one of the busiest corridors in the Philippines. Intensive \nassessments and consultations with stakeholders for the design and construction plan have been \nundertaken, so that the elevated walkways can be built and/or improved without sacrificing traffic \nlanes on EDSA after construction, and with minimum traffic disturbance during construction.  \n\u2022  The project includes measures to ensure sustainable operation and maintenance (O&M) of the project \nfacilities. The elevated walkways will have space for advertisements and small kiosks, and the income \ngenerated from these is projected to be more than sufficient to cover the costs of routine O&M. The \nDepartment of Transportation will also make arrangements with private sector entities, government-\nowned and controlled corporations, and/or local government units for continuous routine O&M. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n14.  The project is estimated to cost $179.3 million (Table 2).

The government has requested a regular loan of $123.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources (A loan) and $15.0 million from the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund (AIF) (B loan) \nthrough its ASEAN Catalytic Green Finance Facility, to help finance the project. The A loan will \nhave a 28-year term, including a grace period of 9 years; an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement for ordinary capital resources. Based on the custom-tailored repayment method, \nthe average loan maturity is 19.0 years and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.20% per \nyear. The B loan will have a 10-year term, including a grace period of 7 years; an annual interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment charge of \n0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement for AIF. \nBased on the straight line repayment method, the average maturity is 8.75 years, and there is no \nmaturity premium.  \n \n16.  The summary financing plan is in Table 3. The A loan will finance expenditures in relation \nto civil works, and consulting services for project management and construction supervision. The \nB loan will finance expenditures in relation to civil works, to be disbursed prorated with the A loan \nfor the same category. The B loan will be administered by ADB.

Since EDSA is one of the busiest corridors in Metro Manila and the project sites are highly \nurbanized with only narrow sidewalks, the consultants conducted intensive assessments and \nprepared plans to relocate public utilities and traffic management before and during construction \nas well as coordinating these plans with other ongoing and/or planned infrastructure projects in \nthe same areas. Elevated walkways will be built overhanging to EDSA carriageway with cantilever \nstructure to create additional space for pedestrians without sacrificing congested traffic lanes of \nEDSA. Although the cantilever structure requires larger foundations, the consultants developed \nthe reference construction plan which will allow the constructions to be done within the restricted \nspace on EDSA. To minimize the disturbance to EDSA traffic during construction, the reference \nconstruction plan adopted a twenty-four hour construction scheme. These factors have increased \ncost implications that has been factored in the cost estimate.  \n \n22.  The sites are in proximity to the West Valley Fault and are exposed to multiple hazards \nincluding earthquakes, liquefaction, tsunamis, and floods18 Disaster resilience is being embedded \nin the schematic designs to ensure hazard-resistant structures, and will also be taken into account \nin the detailed engineering designs. The elevated walkways will have a width of 5 meters with a \nroof protecting pedestrians from direct sunlight and rain. The elevated walkways will be equipped \n \n18 The West Valley Fault cuts through six cities of Metro Manila: Makati, Marikina, Muntinlupa, Pasig, Quezon, and \nTaguig. \n ", " \n7 \nwith  sufficient  lighting  and  monitoring  cameras  to  provide  a  safe  and  secure  pedestrian \nenvironment. The environment underneath the elevated walkways will be also improved by \nrefurbishing pavement and providing lightings.  \n \n23.  The impact of COVID-19 is evolving. The project will be responsive and flexible in meeting \nemerging  needs  and  new  best  practices  in  construction.  The  implementing  agency,  the \nconstruction supervision consultants, and the contractor will incorporate emerging international \nconstruction best practices on managing COVID-19 risks. Such practices will also consider \ngovernment guidance on safe working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n24.  Economic and financial analyses undertaken concluded that the project is economically \nviable and financially sustainable. The main benefit of the project is an improved pedestrian \nexperience, reflected in shorter perceived travel times for pedestrians. The overall economic \ninternal rate of return of the project is estimated to be 21.8%. Each of the four project locations is \neconomically viable, with economic rates of return exceeding 10.0%.19 The project\u2019s elevated \nwalkways will not be tolled and the government will shoulder the capital cost. \n  \nC.  Sustainability \n \n25.  The DOTr will own the constructed walkways and be primarily responsible for operation \nand  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the  walkways.  The  elevated  walkways  will  have  space  for \nadvertisements and small kiosks, and the income generated from these is projected to be more \nthan sufficient to cover the costs of routine O&M. The DOTr will make arrangements with private \nsector entities, government-owned and controlled corporations and/or local government units for \ncontinuous routine O&M. The DOTr has experience in O&M of public transport assets and in \nmaking arrangements with private companies to build connections between MRT-3 stations and \nprivately owned facilities.20 \n \nD.  Governance \n \n26.  The financial management assessment was prepared following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nFinancial Management and Analysis of Projects, Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note, \nand related technical guidance notes.21 The assessment found that the DOTr has sound financial \nand accounting systems; adheres to the procedures, manuals, policies, guidelines, and reporting \nframework prescribed by the Commission on Audit of the Government of the Philippines; follows \naccrual-based  accounting  using  an  Enterprise  Resource  Planning  system  based  on  the \nPhilippines Public Sector Accounting Standards; and has an internal control system with a \nseparate  internal  audit  division.  The  assessed  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is \nsubstantial, mainly because an insufficient number of DOTr staff are capable of accounting and \ninternal auditing. Appropriate risk mitigation measures will be in place.

The DOTr also has experience in opening direct connection from MRT-3 \nstations to neighboring malls or buildings. The DOTr signs memorandums of agreement with private companies \nsetting out the terms and conditions for such connections.   \n21 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.

ADB will review procurement-related documents at all major milestones before proceeding \nwith the procurement process. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and the DOTr. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n28.  The  project  will  improve  the  pedestrian  environment  and  facilitate  access  to  public \ntransport. Public transport users and pedestrians are the beneficiaries of the project, and they are \nlargely from poor and vulnerable segments. Better access to public transport and improved \npedestrian safety will directly improve users\u2019 quality of life. Particular attention will be given to \nensuring suitable design features for PWDs, women, the elderly, and people traveling with \nsmall children. \n \n29.  Gender action plan. The project, categorized as effective gender mainstreaming, seeks \nto address the following gender issues: (i) inaccessible, unsafe, and inconvenient pedestrian \nfacilities for women and marginalized groups (elderly, PWDs, children, and sexual minorities); (ii) \nunequal  access  to  women  and  marginalized  sectors,  compared  with  able-bodied  men,  to \nemployment opportunities generated by the project; and (iii) sexual exploitation, abuse, and \nharassment committed during civil works construction and in overall project implementation. Key \ngender action plan (GAP) activities include (i) integration of physical design features to make \ninfrastructure accessible, convenient, and safe for all users (e.g., glass elevators, barricades, grab \nrails, tactile surfaces and signage, provisions for passive surveillance, rest areas, and greenery); \n(ii) proactive participation of women and PWDs in employment opportunities created by the \nproject, and ensuring gender-sensitive and inclusive workplaces for them; (iii) awareness-raising \nand setting up of mechanisms to protect women, children, sexual minorities, and elderly from \nsexual exploitation, abuse, and other gender-based violence in the context of the project\u2019s \nconstruction of civil works and overall project implementation; and (iv) ensuring effective GAP \nimplementation and sustainability of gains. The GAP was informed by extensive consultations \nwith stakeholders including civil society groups representing women, children, the elderly, PWDs, \nand the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender communities. Its final formulation is the outcome \nof a series of workshops and discussions with government counterparts, including the DOTr \nGender and Development Focal Point System for Road Sector. \n \n30.  HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. Transport and road projects pose a potential increase \nin HIV/AIDS and human trafficking cases, as they involve an influx of workers during construction. \nThe construction supervision consultants will be tasked to design and implement information \ndissemination activities to raise awareness of sexual harassment, sexually transmitted diseases, \nHIV/AIDS, human trafficking prevention, city ordinances on women and gender and PWDs, and \ngender and disability sensitivity. The construction supervision consultants will raise the awareness \nof all contractors\u2019 workers and residents of surrounding barangays of the four stations on gender \nequality and social inclusion in transport and infrastructure.23   \n \n \n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Barangay is the smallest public administrative division in the Philippines. Cities and municipalities are subdivided \ninto barangays. \n ", " \n9 \nF.  Safeguards \n \n31.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.24  \n \n32.  Environment (category B). The project is classified category B for environment under \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. An initial environmental examination was prepared and \ndisclosed on the project website.25 Under the Philippine Environmental Impact Statement System, \nthe project is not subject to an environmental compliance certificate.26 The project is expected to \ngenerate  significant  public  health  and  well-being  benefits  by  promoting  safe,  all-weather, \ninclusive, and zero-emission pedestrian transport facilities. The project will promote diversion of \npassengers from vehicular modes to walking and will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by an \nestimated 886 tons per year. Some adverse impacts on environment are anticipated during \nproject implementation, primarily construction noise and dust, temporary traffic disturbances, and \ncommunity and occupational safety hazard during construction. These impacts and risks will be \ntemporary and site-specific and can readily be mitigated to acceptable levels through good \nconstruction  practices  and  standard  mitigation  measures  outlined  in  the  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP). The EMP will be a part of the bidding documents for the civil works. \nThe PMO, with the support of project management consultants to be hired under the A loan, will \nhave primary responsibility to ensure that contractors comply with the provisions of the EMP and \nthe  environmental  regulatory  framework  of  the  Philippines.  PMO  staff  will  be  trained  in \nenvironmental safeguard requirements through ADB technical assistance.27 Meaningful public \nconsultations  involving  243  people  confirmed  broad  community  support  for  the  project. \nCommunity concerns and complaints will be promptly addressed through the project\u2019s grievance \nredress mechanism (para. 34). \n \n33.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for \ninvoluntary resettlement under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Resettlement impacts have \nbeen minimized by confining the design and construction works within the road right-of-way. \nAbout 250 affected persons have been identified in the four station areas, including ambulant \nvendors and private individual landowners. With respect to the total land to be acquired (6,430 \nsquare meters), about 26.5% (1,705 square meters) belong to private individuals and corporations \nor 13 affected persons, the rest being public and/or government land. Of the 13 affected persons, \nonly three (two corporations and one individual) will lose 10% or more of their lands. Four \nresettlement plans have been prepared\u2014one for each of the four walkway locations. The plans \nespouse both national laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) to \naddress the following involuntary resettlement impacts: (i) permanent loss of land from public \n(government and government corporations) and private (individuals and corporations) entities; \n(ii) permanent damage to secondary private and community structures mostly made of semi-\npermanent materials and public utility structures; (iii) temporary loss of access to business \nestablishments during construction works and disruption of city services because of required \nrelocation  of  electric  posts;  (iv)  temporary  physical  displacement  of  ambulant  vendors  to \nalternative selling sites and displacement of one homeless individual; and (v) disruption of city \nservices because of required relocation of electric posts. \n \n \n24 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n25 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 The DOTr secured a certificate of non-coverage from the Environmental Management Bureau of the Department of \nEnvironment and Natural Resources on 9 July 2019. \n27 ADB. 2017.

The four resettlement plans will be updated based on the schematic designs of the \nwalkways. The schematic design-based resettlement plans will reflect results of surveys including \nindependent property appraisals and detailed measurement surveys.28 The resettlement plans \nmitigate  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  by  providing  compensation  at  replacement  cost. \nMeasures have been incorporated to improve the living standards of vulnerable affected people \nspecifically through special assistance and livelihood restoration actions. As the DOTr has limited \nexperience in implementing resettlement plans, ADB will provide capacity development training \nunder ADB technical assistance (footnote 13) for staff of the Environment, Social and Right-of-\nWay Division on provisions of the resettlement plans and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009).  A grievance redress mechanism for resettlement and environmental issues has been put \nin place. The government will finance implementation of the resettlement plans. The resettlement \nplans have been disclosed on ADB\u2019s website and to affected households. \n \n35.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Indigenous peoples are not present in the project \narea.  The  project  is  classified  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n36.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan (footnote 22). \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nDelay in procurement  \u2022 A  consulting  firm  has been  mobilized  under  the  IPIF  to  prepare  the \nschematic designs and bid documents and provide procurement support. \n\u2022 Two  individual  consultants  have  been  mobilized  under  ADB  TA,  \nStrengthening Infrastructure Capacity and Innovation for Inclusive Growth \n(footnote 13), to develop the capacity of DOTr staff. \nDelay in utility relocation  \u2022 The DOTr organizes consultation meetings with the utility owners, including \nprivate electricity, communication, gas, and water supply companies, the \nDepartment of Public Works and Highways, and local government units.  \n\u2022 The consultants mobilized under the IPIF are facilitating consultations with \nutility owners to implement the relocations in a timely manner. \nFinancial management of the project  \u2022 The CSC will include a national financial management specialist on its team \nis not carried out effectively  to support the PMO in reviewing and processing the claims for payment to \nthe contractors/consultants. \nInsufficient  qualified  counterpart  \u2022 A PMO will be established in the DOTr and a CSC will be mobilized to \nstaff  mitigate the lack of experience in project management. \n\u2022 Training for DOTr staff will be provided under ADB TA, Strengthening \nInfrastructure Capacity and Innovation for Inclusive Growth (footnote 13), \nincluding  training  on  environmental  and  involuntary  resettlement \nsafeguards, gender mainstreaming, civil works contract management, and \naccounting. \nDelayed  and  insufficient  provision  \u2022 Consultants mobilized under the IPIF will propose various types of O&M \nfor O&M, since the government will  arrangements, identify the legal and regulatory requirements for each type, \napprove  O&M  budget  every  year  and help the PMO select the most appropriate type of arrangement. \nand  there  is  no  guarantee  that  \u2022 The CSC will be mobilized to facilitate the discussion with stakeholders and \nprepare budget scheme proposals for the government, if necessary. \n \n28 Detailed measurement surveys are social surveys that include measurements or inventory of losses, census and \nsocioeconomic survey of affected households, and property appraisal. Under the DOTr right-of-way and site \nacquisition manual, a qualified, professional geodetic engineer is to conduct a detailed measurement survey well in \nadvance of construction, and qualified property assessors from a government financial institution and/or independent \nproperty appraisers are to conduct property appraisals to provide valuations of the land, assets, structures and \nimprovements, crops, and trees, as appropriate. \n ", " \n11 \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nrevenue generated will be utilized \nfor O&M of the project facilities. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CSC = construction supervision consultant, DOTr = Department of Transportation, \nIPIF = Infrastructure Preparation and Innovation Facility, O&M = operation and maintenance,  PMO = project \nmanagement office, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.
