The investment program will upgrade and maintain about 2,200 kilometers (km) of \nrural access roads to all-weather standard; rehabilitate and maintain to a good condition about \n400 km of national roads; and improve the capacity of road agencies\u2014including the Ministry of \nHighways,  Ports  and  Shipping  (MOHPS),  the  Road  Development  Authority  (RDA),  provincial \nroad  agencies,  and  local  authorities\u2014with  respect  to  road  asset  management,  project \nmanagement, and contract administration.2 The investment program  will play a catalytic role in \nthe sustainable development of Sri Lanka.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nSri Lanka occupies a strategic position near the main sea trade routes between Asia and \n3. \nEurope, which allowed Colombo to develop as an international port city, and subsequently as a \ntransshipment point for cargo originating in or destined for the Indian subcontinent. The island \ncountry consists mostly of flat or rolling coastal plains, with mountains in the south\u2013central core. \nAbout 85% of Sri Lanka\u2019s population (20.3 million in 2012) lives in rural and peri-urban areas.3 \n \n4. \nSri Lanka has experienced strong economic growth  following  the end of civil conflict in \nMay 2009.  Economic growth was 8% in 2010 and 2011; slowed to 6.4% in 2012 due to weak \nexternal demand, drought, and floods; and then rebounded to 7.3% in 2013. It is envisaged that \nan improving external environment, higher investment, and a recovery in domestic consumption \nwill sustain a rapid economic growth during 2014\u20132015.4 Sri Lanka\u2019s economic expansion has \nbeen  driven  by  the  industry  and  services  sectors,  which  account  for  89%  of  gross  domestic \nproduct, followed by the agriculture sector, which contributed the remaining 11%.5 As a result of \nthe robust growth, the national poverty headcount ratio fell to just below 9% in 2010 from over \n15% in 2006. Nevertheless, less-developed areas did not exhibit consistently higher elasticity of \npoverty reduction (proportional change in poverty per unit growth in gross domestic product per \ncapita).6 The poor transport infrastructure, in particular the provincial and local authority roads, \nhas hindered the spread of economic activities and access to basic social resources. \n \nSector  road  map. Sri Lanka\u2019s road network is dense and well laid out, providing basic \n5. \naccess to the country\u2019s population and economic activity centers. The 132,693 km road network \n\n                                                 \n1  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  Integrated  Road \n\nOperation and Development Investment Program (TA 8473-SRI). \n\n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  World  Bank  and  United  Nations  Human  Settlements  Programme  (UN-Habitat).  2012.

Washington, DC. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nin  Sri  Lanka  is  classified  into  national,  provincial,  and  local  authority  roads,  according  to \nadministrative responsibility.7 Notable progress has been achieved since 2007 in addressing the \nimmediate  trunk  road  network  deficiencies, 8  but  progress  on  provincial  and  rural  roads  is \nrelatively slow.9 The main challenges facing road connectivity are that most rural access roads, \nincluding  provincial  and  local  roads,  cannot  provide  all-weather  access,  and  part  of  the  trunk \nroad  network  is  in  poor  condition.  These  issues  arise  because  of  (i)  competition  for  budget \nallocations with other sectors; (ii) inadequate fundraising in both the public and private sectors; \n(iii) inadequate rural road design standards and construction specifications; and (iv) the limited \ncapacity of road agencies, particularly at the provincial and local levels. \n \n6. \nA  road  asset  management  system  is  functioning  in  RDA  to  plan  and  program  road \nprojects.  The  government  established  a  road  maintenance  trust  fund  in  2005.  The  fund  has \nserved a useful purpose in terms of securing a maintenance budget, and raising awareness of \nthe importance of maintenance.  In the long term, the government plans to expand the fund to \ncover provincial and rural roads, but this will require that a harmonized approach to road asset \nmanagement be adopted by the various road agencies. \n \n7. \nStrategic  context.  The  government\u2019s  national  strategy  for  2010\u20132020  aims  to \naccelerate  economic  growth,  improve  social  indicators,  eradicate  hard-core  poverty,  and \nimprove  the  environment.10 Inadequate,  poor-quality  infrastructure  is  identified  by  the  strategy \nas a major constraint to sustaining rapid economic growth, and the strategy places the highest \npriority on improving the country\u2019s road network. The road network development investment in \n2011 at national, provincial, and local levels was about six times higher in nominal terms than in \n2005. The public investment strategy proposes to sustain annual public investment at more than \n$1.3 billion until 2016, which would thereafter help develop and maintain the road network.11 \n \n8. \nIn  line  with  the  government\u2019s  national  strategy,  the  country  partnership  strategy  2012\u2013\n2016  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  aims  to  address  the  major  constraints  for \nsustaining inclusive growth in post-war Sri Lanka.12 The transport sector is one of the key areas \nin implementing the strategy. As agreed with the government, ADB will contribute to the sector \noutcome of improved nationwide connectivity. \n \nPolicy  framework.  The  central  government  is  responsible  for  transport  policy  and \n9. \ninterprovincial  (national)  road  transport  infrastructure.  Provincial  governments  are  responsible \nfor  provincial  roads,  and  local  authorities  for  the  local  authority  roads.  The  government  has \nadopted  a  two-tier  strategy  to  provide  nationwide  connectivity:  (i)  establishing  a  trunk  road \nnetwork  with  expressways  and  well-connected  national  roads,  and  (ii)  completing  a  rural  road \nnetwork to connect the rural population to trunk roads. RDA\u2019s project management capacity has \nbeen well developed through large-scale projects, beginning in 2007. A skills transfer program is \n\n                                                 \n7  National roads, comprising about 11,922 km of class A and class B roads, are managed by the central government \nthrough the RDA. The provincial road network, comprising 15,975 km of class C and class D roads, is managed by \nthe provincial councils. In addition, about 80,000 km of local roads (class E) are managed by local governments. \n8  The proportion of national roads in good condition rose from 35% in 2007 to 48% in 2011, those in fair condition \n\ndropped from 19% to 11%, and those in poor condition declined from 46% to 41%. \n\n9  The government has established Maga Neguma, a rural road program, to improve rural roads through  RDA. The \nprogram has improved about 10,000 km of rural roads at the request of local authorities since 2004, but about 90% \nof the rural road network still requires rehabilitation. \n\n10 Government  of  Sri  Lanka,  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Planning,  Department  of  National  Planning.  2010.

The development of the national road network is guided by the national road master \nplan.13 Improvements  to  rural  access  roads,  including  provincial  and  local  authority  roads,  are \nscheduled  annually  to  address  the  community  demands.  To  supplement  the  capacity  of \nprovincial governments and local authorities, RDA, the provincial road agencies, and the local \nauthority jointly implement rural road improvement works. \n \nIn line with the two-tier strategy, the government plans to implement an investment plan \n10. \nfor rural road connectivity. The plan is designed to provide physical infrastructure and capacity \nto enhance the road connectivity of rural areas. About 1,000 rural communities will be selected \nas rural hubs according to their population and development potential. Access routes\u2014including \nlocal  authority,  provincial,  and  national  roads\u2014will  be  upgraded  or  rehabilitated.  The  total \ninvestment  demand  is  about  $1.8  billion.  The  government  requests  that  ADB  finance  the \nprogram  in  five  provinces  (Southern  Province,  Sabaragamuwa  Province,  Central  Province, \nNorth Central Province, and North Western Province) and one rural district (Kalutara District of \nWestern  Province).  The  government  has  also  requested  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency to finance projects in the other areas to complement ADB\u2019s assistance.  \n \n11. \nThe investment program is in line with the government\u2019s sector objective of establishing \na  modern  transport  system.  An  MFF  is  proposed  as  the  financing  modality  for  the  investment \nprogram because it will allow long-term partnership between the government and ADB on policy \ndialogue  and  capacity  development  within  a  large-scale  program.14 A  portfolio  review  of  ADB-\nfunded road projects confirmed that the implementation capacity in Sri Lanka is adequate. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n(i) \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nThe  impact  of  the  investment  program  will  be  improved  connectivity  between  rural \ncommunities and socioeconomic centers in Sri Lanka. The outcome will be increased transport \nefficiency on project roads. \n \nC. \n \n13. \nThe  investment  program  will  deliver  two  outputs:  (i)  improved  road  conditions  between \nthe selected rural communities and socioeconomic centers, and (ii) enhanced capacity of road \nagencies. The two outputs will be achieved through two components of the investment program. \nRoad  improvement  component.  This  component  will  design,  improve,  and \nmaintain  about  2,200  km  of  rural  access  roads,  including  provincial  and  local \nauthority roads, and about 400 km of national roads. The rural access roads will \nbe  improved  to  all-weather  standards,  and  be  maintained  for  3  years.  Selected \nnational  road  corridors  will  be  improved  and/or  maintained  for  7  years,  while \nshort, isolated sections will be maintained for 3 years after improvement. \nCapacity  development  component.  This  component  will  build  the  capacity  of \nroad  agencies  in  road  asset  management,  project  management,  and  contract \nadministration.  RDA  will  take  the  lead  in  developing  a  harmonized  approach  to \nroad asset management in central, provincial, and local governments. Consulting \nservices will be engaged to assist with development of the RDA\u2019s capacity, and \nthe transfer of skills from RDA to provincial and local road agencies.  \n\n(ii) \n\n                                                 \n13  RDA, Planning Division. 2007.

This support \nwill also alleviate the government\u2019s budget and capacity constraints on road maintenance. \n17 Framework Financing Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n     5 \n\n17. \nThe  MFF  combines  OCR  and  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  financing  up  to  the \naggregate  MFF  amount.  The  provision  of  any  ADF  resources  will  be  balanced  by  a \ncorresponding  reduction  in  available  OCR  financing  (and  vice  versa),  with  total  financing \nprovided under the MFF not to exceed the aggregate MFF total of $800 million equivalent. Any \nADF allocation will be subject to (i) the availability of ADF resources; (ii) Sri Lanka\u2019s access to \nsuch  resources  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Graduation  Policy,18 and  the  requirements  of  ADF  donors; \nand (iii) the availability of such resources to Sri Lanka given ADB\u2019s policy on performance-based \nallocation of ADF resources.19 \n \n18. \nDisbursement-based  approach  and  time-slice  financing.  The financing plan and an \nindicative  tranche  schedule  are  in  Table  2.  The  MFF  will  finance  slices  of  long-term  contract \npackages under the investment program. Each tranche will finance slices of a group of contracts \nfor civil works or consulting services. Each contract is sliced according to the indicative tranche \nschedule. 20  The  amount  of  each  tranche  will  be  requested  according  to  the  disbursement \nprogress  and  projection.  The  tranche  schedule  is  based  on  the  disbursement  projection  to \nimprove the disbursement ratio and minimize financing charges. \n \n19. \nThe preconstruction activities, such as appraisal and procurement, will be all advanced \nto  the  first  2\u20133  years  of  the  investment  program.  The  government  has  completed  preparation \nand due diligence for project 1, and will complete the preparation of other projects by October \n2014. Following the disbursement-based approach, the government intends to request tranche \n1 together with the facility to finance the first slice of project 1, and to request tranche 2 by the \nend of 2014 to finance the first slice of other projects. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n800.0 \n106.0 \n906.0 \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n88.3 \n11.7 \n100.0 \n\nIndicative Tranche Schedule and Amount ($ million) \n6 \n1 \n(2020) \n(2014) \n100.0 \n100.0 \n12.0 \n18.0 \n112.0 \n118.0 \n\n2 \n(2014) \n100.0 \n15.0 \n115.0 \n\n4 \n(2017) \n150.0 \n18.0 \n168.0 \n\n3 \n(2016) \n200.0 \n25.0 \n225.0 \n\n5 \n(2018) \n150.0 \n18.0 \n168.0 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nProject  1  and  tranche  1.

For  provincial  and  rural  roads,  a  context-sensitive  design \napproach  is  adopted  to  incorporate  community  concerns.  Construction  will  use  proven \ntechnology and standard materials compatible with local conditions. Project 1 of the investment \nprogram  has  two  groups  of  civil  works  contracts:  (i)  conventional  road  contracts,  including \nconstruction and 3-year performance-based maintenance; and (ii) road management contracts, \nincluding 7 years of rehabilitation and maintenance to deliver a predefined level of services. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n23. \nIn addition to the large vehicle operating cost and time savings, all-weather rural access \nroad will result in significant benefits, such as increased agriculture productivity, easier access \nto  health  and  education,  poverty  reduction,  and  better  employment  opportunities  for  the  rural \npopulation.  These  social  benefits  are  not  captured  by  the  conventional  economic  analysis \nmodel.  Therefore,  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  threshold  of  10%  is  adopted  for \nrural access roads. For national roads, a threshold of 12% EIRR is used. The economic analysis \nof  project  1  indicated  it  is  economically  viable,  with  an  overall  EIRR  of  19.1%.24 A  sensitivity \nanalysis on capital costs, benefits, and implementation delays confirmed its economic viability. \n \n24. \nThe unit costs related to operation and maintenance of project roads will decrease after \nconstruction  is  completed.  Recent  trends  indicate  that  future  budget  allocations  for  national \nroads will be adequate. The government envisages that in the long term, the road maintenance \ntrust fund will allow access by provincial and local road agencies. The investment program will \nbuild  the  capacity  of  provincial  and  local  road  agencies  to  facilitate  the  process  of  granting \naccess of the trust fund to non-national roads, and to enhance their financial sustainability. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nPolicy  and  legal.  The  implementation  arrangements  of  the  investment  program  will \n25. \ninvolve  three  levels  of  government:  central,  provincial,  and  local.  At  the  central  level,  the \nMOHPS  is  responsible  for  the  formulation  of  policies  and  performance  monitoring.  RDA  was \nestablished  as  a  statutory  authority  with  a  separate  legal  status  by  the  Road  Development \nAuthority Act in 1981. RDA\u2019s chairperson reports to the secretary of MOHPS. At the provincial \nand  local  levels,  the  provincial  councils  are  responsible  for  the  work  of  the  respective  local \nauthorities within the provincial councils, under the 13th amendment to the Constitution enacted \nin 1987 and the Pradheshiya Sabha Act No 15 in 1987. In keeping with the devolution norm of \nSri Lanka, RDA acts as if contracted by the provincial authorities to construct roads that belong \nto the local authorities, and a memorandum of understanding to this effect will be executed. The \narrangements  follow  existing  practice  in  Sri  Lanka,  where  local  authorities  generally  lack  the \ncapacity and resources for such projects. \n \n26. \nThe implementation arrangements satisfy the RDA Act, which requires that RDA consult \nwith  other  government  agencies  regarding  projects  within  their  respective  areas.  The  national \nsteering committee and provincial coordination committees will ensure proper coordination. \n \n27. \nInstitutional capacity. MOHPS and RDA have sufficient capacity, past experience, and \ninstitutional  strength  to  procure  the  civil  works,  select  consultants,  and  administer  contracts. \nParticipation  of  provincial,  district  and  local  authorities  in  the  steering  and  coordination \ncommittees has been arranged, with consideration of their respective institutional capacity. \n\n                                                 \n24 Economic and Financial Analysis: Project 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n28. \nFinancial management. A financial management assessment was carried out for RDA. \nRDA  has  prior  and  ongoing  experience  implementing  ADB-funded  projects.  It  has  satisfactory \ncapacity  in  project  financial  accounting  and  in  ADB  disbursement  procedures.  RDA  has  a \ndedicated  project  accounting  and  finance  team  with  suitably  qualified  accountants.  RDA  will \nestablish and maintain separate project records and accounts to identify the financing resources \nreceived  and  expenditures  made  for  the  project,  thus  ensuring  an  adequate  audit  trail.  The \ngovernment\u2019s Auditor General\u2019s Department will annually audit the project accounts and related \nfinancial statements in accordance with international auditing standards. \n \n29. \nProcurement  and  anticorruption.  Procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). The Bribery Act, No. 11 of 1954 \n(as amended from time to time), the Declaration of Asset and Liabilities Act, No. 1 of 1975, and \nthe Permanent Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption Act, No. 19 of \n1994  provide  a  legal  basis  to  deal  with  bribery  and  corruption.  The  auditor  general  monitors \nprocurement activities. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government, the MOHPS, and RDA. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the facility administration manual. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n30. \nPoverty  reduction  and  social  impacts.  Project  1  will  improve  the  socioeconomic \nsituation and enhance poverty reduction in Southern Province. About 1.2 million people live in \nthe 45 divisions within project areas. Consultation and social surveys were conducted along all \nproject roads, and covered 4,899 households (approximately 38% of the households along the \nproject roads), with 14 focus group discussions. The current road conditions were described as \nbad by 80% of surveyed households. Communities indicated that the poor conditions prevented \nsafe travel, and cited that positive benefits will include improved access to education and health, \nbetter  transport  services,  and  increased  job  opportunities.  Communities  will  be  consulted \nthrough a transect walk to ensure that the final design of provincial and rural roads incorporate \ntheir concerns on construction, social and environmental issues, and road safety.25 \n \nGender  and  development.  The  country  now  ranks  midway  on  the  United  Nations \n31. \ngender-related development index. The social study found that women were actively engaged in \nfamily  and  community  activities  and  decision-making  processes:  80%  always  participating  in \nfamily  decision  making,  54%  contributed  to  household  income,  and  53%  were  involved  in \ncommunity  activities.  Sixty-two  percent  of  women  stated  they  were  willing  to  participate  in  the \nproject through (i) working as maintenance laborer or civil works wage laborer, and (ii) operating \na  small  business  to  provide  services  to  contractors.  Women  indicated  that  improved  road \naccessibility will provide better access to health, education, social, and economic opportunities. \nA gender action plan has been prepared for project 1.26 Gender mainstreaming activities include \n(i) ensuring that at least 40% of the people consulted in the final design of rural access roads \nare  women;  (ii)  integrating  features  that  increase  safety  and  meet  the  needs  of  the  elderly, \nwomen, children and the disabled; (iii) ensuring that at least 30% of local employees hired for \nroad maintenance are women and that they receive equal wages for equal work; (iv) providing \ntraining in road maintenance to all employed women; and (v) encouraging women\u2019s participation \nin awareness campaigns on road safety, sexually transmitted infections, and human trafficking. \n\n                                                 \n25 Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy:  Project  1  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n26 Gender Action Plan: Project 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n     9 \n\nSafeguards \n\nrequirements \n\n \n32. \nHIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking.  The  HIV  prevalence  rate  is  low  in  Sri  Lanka.  The \nestablishment  of  the  National  Program  for  Sexually  Transmitted  Diseases  and  AIDS  Control \nhelps refurbish health clinics and establish outreach and awareness programs. This investment \nprogram  has  incorporated  measures  to  mitigate  HIV/AIDS  risks  by  undertaking  awareness \ntraining  for  civil  works  contractors  and  for  project-affected  communities  at  prominent  village \nlocations.  Awareness-raising  activities  will  be  conducted  separately  for  men  and  women.  The \nsocial impact assessment did not identify human trafficking as a significant issue in the project \narea. It is anticipated that civil works contractors will hire local laborers and not require migrant \nworkers. Affected communities will be provided with awareness training on human trafficking. \n \nE. \n \n33. \nInvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. Project 1 is classified as category \nB in involuntary resettlement in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The \nimprovement of rural access roads and national roads will be within the existing alignment with \nno widening. Due diligence for project 1 identified no impacts to land, structures, private trees, \nor  community  resource  properties.27 However,  resettlement  impacts  may  be  encountered  at  a \nlater stage of the 7-year road management contract. A grievance redressal mechanism will be \nset  up  in  all  project  areas.  A  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  to  guide  compliance \nwith  social  safeguard  requirements  in  succeeding  projects. 28 If  land  is  required  for  the  rural \naccess roads when implementing succeeding projects, the voluntary land donation system will \nbe used. The system has been used effectively under other rural development programs in Sri \nLanka.  Specific  procedural \ninvolving  comprehensive \nfor \nconsultations  with  the  communities,  have  been  prepared  in  the  resettlement  framework.  The \ngovernment will ensure that land donation is undertaken without coercion and documented in a \ntransparent manner, and will have the process verified by an independent monitor. For national \nroads  requiring  land,  acquisition  will  take  place  in  accordance  with  requirements  of  the \ngovernment and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, per the resettlement framework. Project 1 \nis  not  expected  to  impact  indigenous  peoples  and  is  consequently  designated  category  C.  An \nindigenous  peoples  planning  framework  has  been  prepared  to  guide  the  planning  and \npreparation of future projects.29  The due diligence report, the resettlement framework and the \nindigenous peoples planning framework have been disclosed on the ADB website. \n \n34. \nEnvironmental  impact. The scope of works under project 1 involves rehabilitation and \nmaintenance  of  existing  rural  and  national  roads.  Therefore  project  1  has  been  designated \ncategory  B  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  A  consolidated  provincial-\nlevel initial environmental examination (IEE) report has been prepared,30 and an environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  has  been  prepared  to  guide  compliance  with  the \nenvironmental  safeguard  requirements  of  the  government  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  in  succeeding  projects. 31 The  IEE  and  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework fulfill ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements and have been disclosed on \nthe  ADB  website.  Anticipated  environmental  impacts  under  project  1  entail  typical  road \nconstruction-related issues such as generation of dust, noise, exhaust, waste from construction \nsites  and  worker  camps,  water  contamination,  occupational  health  and  safety,  erosion,  and \nsiltation.  Mitigation  measures  have  been  included  in  a  standard  environmental  management \n                                                 \n27 Resettlement Due Diligence Report: Project 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Initial Environmental Examination: Project 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nland  donation, \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nplan  (EMP)  as  part  of  the  IEE.  The  contractor  will  be  required  to  prepare  contract  package-\nspecific  EMPs  based  on  their  final  design,  road-specific  environment  checklists,  and  the \nstandard EMP. Consultations have been conducted during the project preparation, and the IEE \nincorporates the concerns of the affected persons and stakeholders. \n \n35. \nRDA has an experienced environment and social development division to manage both \nsafeguard  issues,  and  a  safeguard  team  from  the  division  will  be  deputed  under  the  project \nimplementation unit. The unit will also be supported by consultants for monitoring and reporting \non safeguard implementation. Safeguard training workshops will be held regularly. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe  overall  risk  assessment  is  medium  without  mitigation  and  low  with  mitigation. \n36. \nIntegrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  costs.  Major  risks  and  mitigating \nmeasures  are  detailed  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 32 The  key  risk  is \nfrequent implementation delays resulting from the need to prepare detailed engineering designs \nand prolonged land acquisition and resettlement. To mitigate this risk, engineering design and \nbidding documents have been prepared in advance, and land requirements minimized. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n37. \nThe government, the MOHPS, and the RDA have assured ADB that implementation of \nthe investment program shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the facility administration manual and loan documents. \n \n38. \nThe  government,  the  MOHPS,  and  the  RDA  have  given  ADB  certain  undertakings  for \nthe MFF, which are set forth in the framework financing agreement.
