THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $50,000,000 in PAG Growth II L.P. \n \n2.  PAG Growth II L.P. (PAGG II, the fund) is a private equity fund established as a Cayman \nIslands exempted limited partnership with an expected size of $500 million. [This information has \nbeen removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, \npara. 17.2.(v)] \n \n3.  PAGG II aims to provide growth capital to a portfolio of 10\u201315 companies operating \nprimarily in the health care, financial services, education, and information technology (IT) sectors \nmainly in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).1 The investment is in line with the objectives of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) to promote private sector development in the PRC, especially \nin secondary and tertiary markets such as Yantai, Nanjing, and Taizhou where equity capital \navailability is limited, and accessing traditional bank financing without hard assets to pledge as \ncollateral remains challenging for growing companies.2 PAGG II is expected to identify and \nsupport promising and talented business leaders, thereby helping to foster a new generation of \nentrepreneurs in the PRC.  Through investments in IT-related businesses, the fund is also \nexpected to promote innovation and technology adoption.3 In terms of value addition, ADB will \nhelp PAGGC to further enhance its environmental and social management system (ESMS) and \nincorporate gender-inclusive practices in its operations. \n \nII.  THE FUND \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n4.  Description.  The  PAG  Group,  a  relatively  well-known  and  established  investment \nmanager in the PRC, employs more than 400 staff, including 190 investment professionals, \nacross 10 offices in Asia. The PAG Group manages investments across three distinct asset \nclasses\u2014(i) private equity, (ii) real estate, and (iii) absolute returns\u2014each of which is managed \nby separate investment teams. [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception \nto disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n5.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n6.  Investment identification. ADB first met with the PAG Group in 2016 when it was raising \nPAGG I. Since then, ADB has closely tracked PAGPE and PAGG I\u2019s performance through several \nfollow-up meetings and due diligence sessions with managing director Kevin Xu, who leads \nPAGGC. [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n7.  Through the investment, ADB seeks to participate in high-growth opportunities in the PRC, \nparticularly in \u201cnew economy\u201d sectors that are supported by secular consumption tailwinds. \n \n1  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n2  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n3  A climate change target amount cannot be specified as this is an investment into a fund (as opposed to an investment \ninto a company) and the composition of the underlying investee companies is not yet known. \n ", "2 \nCompanies operating in the new economy are focusing on innovation to update existing or build \nnew business models that improve the quality and accessibility of their products and services, \nincluding in the health care, financial services, and education sectors. The focus on new economy \ninvestments is consistent with the Government of the PRC\u2019s emphasis on policies to boost the \ngrowth of domestic innovative businesses and enhance local capabilities.4 [This information has \nbeen removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, \npara. 17.2.(v)] \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n8.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] PAGG II seeks to invest in a portfolio of 10\u201315 \ncompanies primarily through equity and equity-like instruments. Focus sectors include health \ncare, financial services, education, and IT. \n \n9.

[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n17.  Advisory committee. PAGG II will form an advisory committee representing PAGG II\u2019s \nlimited partners to be appointed by the general partner. ADB is expected to be represented on \nPAGG II\u2019s advisory committee, which will opine on matters related to certain potential conflicts of \ninterest, exercise its right to consent to certain matters in accordance with the provisions of the \nlimited partnership agreement, and act in a governance advisory role to the general partner and \nits advisor. \n \n \n4  J.

The Assistance \n \n19.  ADB intends to make an equity investment of up to $50 million in PAGG II, representing \n10% of the expected fund size. ADB\u2019s investment will not exceed 25% of PAGG II\u2019s total \ncommitted capital and will not result in ADB being the single largest investor in PAGG II. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis of Expected Returns and Assumptions \n \n20.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n \n22.  Reporting arrangements. The general partner will be required to provide ADB with \nunaudited quarterly reports, audited annual reports with financial statements, a fund overview, \nannual development effectiveness monitoring reports, and an overview of the portfolio. ADB will \nreview this information and follow-up with the general partner if more information or clarification is \nneeded. If the information received from the general partner raises issues that could impair the \nvalue of ADB\u2019s investment in PAGG II, ADB could decide to put the fund on a watch list for more \nfrequent and detailed reviews. \n \nD.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n23.  Gender. The general partner and PAGCC have committed to working with ADB to adopt \nmeasures to achieve a more gender-equitable workforce at PAGPE and the fund\u2019s portfolio \ncompanies. [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in \nADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n24.  Environmental, social, standards. ADB's participation will obligate the general partner \nto  ensure  that  PAGG  II's  investee  companies  comply  with  ADB's  environment  and  social \nsafeguard standards, and report on development indicators. \n \n25.  Governance  oversight.  ADB,  along  with  other  members  of  PAGG  II's  advisory \ncommittee, will also provide oversight on important governance matters including issues relating \nto conflicts of interest. \n \n26.  Cofinancing opportunities. PAGCC values ADB\u2019s ability to provide both debt and equity \nfinancing directly to its portfolio companies to fund growth plans. ADB can also help mobilize \nadditional financing from third-party sources. \n \n   \n ", "4 \nE.  Risks \n \n27.

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcomes, and Outputs \n \n33.  Impact. Accessibility to and quality of goods and services in the health care, financial \nservices, and education sectors in the PRC are improved. \n \n34.  Outcomes.  Financial  sustainability  and  operational  value  addition  of  private  equity \ninvestments are achieved, and goods and services to target sectors in the PRC are expanded. \n \n35.  Outputs. PAGG II is established; capital to support greater economic development in the \nPRC is invested; gender equality at the investee level is improved; and gender inclusiveness at \nthe PAGPE level is enhanced. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n36.  Consistency with ADB strategy. The investment in PAGG II aligns with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030 operational priority 1 (addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities), which \nmandates ADB to undertake efforts to contribute to the overarching goal of universal health \ncoverage and to generate quality jobs to support inclusive growth for all.5 This engagement also \naccelerates progress in gender equality, contributing to Strategy 2030 operational priority 2. \n \n37.  Consistency with country strategies. The investment is consistent with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for the PRC, 2021\u20132025, which seeks to address key challenges in adapting \nto an aging society, increasing national and regional health security, promoting food safety and \nsecurity, and delivering quality social services through private sector solutions.6 \n \n5  ADB. 2018.

Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The investment in \nPAGG II is consistent with (i) ADB\u2019s operational plan for private sector operations, which supports \ninvestments in private equity funds that enable ADB to efficiently deploy and mobilize equity \ncapital  to  support  companies  in  realizing  their  expansion  plans,  thereby  generating  strong \nmultiplier effects on ADB\u2019s capital;7 and (ii) ADB\u2019s operational plan for health, which encourages \nprivate sector investments to address issues on quality, affordability, and accessibility in the \nhealth sector.8 \n \n39.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n40.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (SPS) (2009).9 \n \n41.  Category FI. ADB has assessed the investment's potential environmental and social \nimpacts, its risks associated with PAGG I\u2019s existing and PAGG II\u2019s likely future portfolio, and its \ncommitment and capacity for environmental and social management. [This information has been \nremoved as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. \n17.2.(v)]. \n \n42.  The general partner has agreed that the revised ESMS will be developed and maintained \nin a form and with content that is satisfactory to ADB prior to ADB\u2019s first capital disbursement. 10 \nThe fund will be required to carry out due diligence to confirm that investments using ADB\u2019s capital \ncomply with ADB\u2019s SPS and applicable national laws and regulations. The revised ESMS will set \nout requirements, as applicable, for compliance with national labor laws and measures to comply \nwith the internationally recognized core labor standards, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy. ADB is seeking a right to be excused from contributing capital to any proposed portfolio \ncompany investment (i) that is categorized A across all ADB\u2019s SPS safeguard categories or (ii) \nthat ADB determines is not in accordance with the revised ESMS. The revised ESMS will also \ncontain requirements, as applicable, for information disclosure and consultation with affected \npeople in accordance with ADB\u2019s requirements. The general partner will include in its annual \nreporting  information  to  ADB  (i)  the  nature  of  the  fund\u2019s  portfolio  and  categorization,  (ii) \ncompliance with the safeguard and social requirements, and (iii) compliance with applicable \nnational and international laws and standards. \n \n43.  Some  gender  elements.  PAGPE  is  committed  to  providing  an  enabling  working \nenvironment based on equal opportunities, and diversity. While the PRC is showing strong \nfemale-to-male labor force participation ratio and high presence of women in professional and \ntechnical jobs, women continue to be underrepresented in leadership positions.11 Following \n \n7  ADB. 2019.

Anticorruption Policy \n \n44.  The general partner was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international \npractice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB \nwill  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event \nof noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n45.  The proposed equity investment is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and \nsingle exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n46.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),13 \nADB will proceed with the assistance upon establishing that the governments of ADB member \ncountries where PAGG II will invest using ADB finance have no objection to the proposed \nassistance to PAGG II. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance \nsatisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n47.  I am satisfied that the proposed equity investment would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nequity investment of up to $50,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources in PAG Growth II \nL.P., with such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this \nreport, and as may be reported to the Board. \n48.   \nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n \n7 May 2021 \n \n12 ADB. 2003.
