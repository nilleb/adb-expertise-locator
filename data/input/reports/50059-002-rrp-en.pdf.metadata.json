The report \nalso  describes  the  proposed  administration  of  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  be  provided  by  the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Strengthening the Capacity of Nepal\u2019s Energy Sector to \nDeliver  Gender  Equality  and  Social  Inclusion  (GESI)  Results,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \n2. \nThe  project  will  enhance  the  distribution  capacity  and  improve  reliability  and  quality  of \nelectricity supply in the Kathmandu Valley by reducing distribution system overloads and technical \nand  commercial  losses,  and  strengthen  associated  transmission  lines  through  the  Nepal \nElectricity  Authority  (NEA).  The  project  will  also  support  the  implementation  of  other  system \nefficiency upgrades and energy efficiency measures, such as advanced grid operations software, \ndistribution system automation, and smart metering.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nReliable  electricity  service  is  a  necessary  requirement  for  accelerating  economic \n3. \ndevelopment of a country and is also considered an important input in improving the quality of \nlife.  Energy  development  in  Nepal  has  been  slow  largely  because  of  a  history  of  weak  and \ninconsistent  policies,  absence  of  an  independent  electricity  regulator,  lack  of  comprehensive \nplanning,  public  sector  financing  limits,  NEA\u2019s  credit  and  offtake  risks,  and  difficulty  in  land \nacquisition and transmission line right-of-way issues. Nepal\u2019s overall electricity demand has far \noutgrown  the  supply:  estimated  peak  demand  in  FY2016  was  around  1,385  megawatt  (MW) \nversus  installed  generation  capacity  of  835  MW,  resulting  in  a  deficit  of  about  550  MW.  As  a \nconsequence,  Nepal  has  been  suffering  from  a  severe  shortage  of  power  with  frequent  load \nshedding. The quality  of  electricity  supply  in Nepal  is  among  the  poorest  in the  world, ranking \n137th out of 147 countries.3  \n \nAs a government corporation responsible for generation, transmission, and distribution, \n4. \nNEA has dominated Nepal\u2019s electricity subsector. It has recorded poor operational and financial \nperformance, and at the end of FY2015, its accumulated losses had reached NRs26.8 billion. In \nFY2015  alone,  NEA  incurred  losses  of  NRs6.5 billion.4 The financial  position  of  NEA  is further \ndeteriorating because of factors such as (i) lack of cost-based tariff adjustments; (ii) high cost of \nservice arising from an elevated internal purchase price at generation point, the annual escalation \nof costs in purchasing power from independent producers, operation of thermal plants, import of \nrelatively high-cost seasonal energy from India, and increased operation and maintenance costs; \n(iii)  high  system  losses  at  over  24%;  and  (iv)  increased  arrears  largely  from  the  public  sector, \nincluding municipalities.  \n \n5. \nThe Government of Nepal endorsed an action plan in February 2016 to end the energy \ncrisis  within  2  years.  The  Ministry  of  Energy  prepared  a  concrete  action plan  to reduce  power \nshortages within 1 year and eliminate them altogether within 2 years. The government has also \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Power Transmission \n\nand Distribution Efficiency Enhancement Project (TA 9144-NEP). \n\n3  ADB. 2015. Asian Development Outlook. Manila. \n4  NEA. 2015. Annual Report. Kathmandu. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ndeclared the National Energy Crisis Reduction and Electricity Development Decades, an action \nplan  comprising  99  specific  activities  that  are  relevant  to  sector  operations,  including  that  of \nimproving  service  delivery  by  modernizing  the  electricity  distribution  system.  Some  visible \ndevelopments are noticed recently in terms of NEA\u2019s operational performance through significant \nreduction  in  load  shedding  in  Kathmandu  Valley  and  other  major  cities of  Nepal  together  with \nelectricity theft control measures. Ultimately, the reform program will be successful only if energy \nand  electricity  pricing  is  rationalized  and  the  sector  shifts  to  a  fully  commercial  basis,  since \ngovernment budgets have not been sufficient to cover energy subsidies. \n \n6. \nElectricity  supplies  are  expected  to  increase  rapidly  during  the  next  several  years  via \n(i) imports from India through the first 400 kilovolt (kV) cross-border line,5 (ii) commissioning of \nthe 456 MW Upper Tamakoshi hydropower project in 2019, and (iii) an additional 1,635 MW from \nmultiple  hydropower  projects  with  planned  commissioning  by  2022.  Therefore,  existing \ntransmission and distribution systems need to be immediately rehabilitated and upgraded for the \nnetwork to be able to deliver the additional electricity supplies to consumers. Given this, electricity \nnetwork enhancement has been a priority and is included in the government\u2019s action plan to end \nthe  power  crisis  and  provide  reliable  and  affordable  electricity,  and  universal  access  for  all  by \n2030.  This  effort  is  consistent  with  achieving  Sustainable  Development  Goal  #7  (Sustainable \nEnergy  for  All)  as  well  as  Nepal\u2019s  Nationally  Determined  Contributions  to  the  United  Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change. \n \n7. \nThe Kathmandu Valley accounts for approximately 400,000 consumers or about 16% of \nNEA\u2019s total consumers in the country, and contributes to about 27% of the total revenue generated \nfrom the sale of electricity. There are 11 distribution centers which operate distribution networks \ncomprising 11.0 kV primary feeders and 0.4 kV lines. Power made available in the Kathmandu \nValley  is  about  400  MW,  and  the  existing  distribution  network  cannot  handle  more  than  this \namount  without  rehabilitation.  This  became  clear  in  2015,  when  liquefied  petroleum  gas  was \nlacking and households were forced to use electricity for cooking, which meant an additional load \nof  200  MW.  The  distribution  network  could  not  handle  the  resulting  overload,  and  numerous \ndistribution transformers were damaged. Moreover, energy consumption in the Kathmandu Valley \n(1,038 gigawatt-hours in FY2016) is rising more than 10% per year, which will lead to a doubling \nof demand every 7 years.  \n \n8. \nThe maintenance and reinforcement of the Kathmandu Valley electricity network have not \nkept pace with growth in electricity demand and the number of consumers added to the network.6 \nIt  is  imperative  to  enhance  the  distribution  capacity  and  improve  the  reliability  and  quality  of \nelectricity  supply  by  reducing  system  overloads  as  well  as  technical  and  commercial  losses \n(currently about 15%). In addition, the existing substation capacity needs to be augmented so that \nadditionally  incoming  power  can  be  accommodated.  Also,  implementation  of  other  system \nefficiency  upgrades  and  efficiency  measures\u2014such  as  advanced  grid  operation  software, \ndistribution  system  automation,  and  smart  metering  that  will  provide  consumers  with  more \ninformation about their own electricity use and greater flexibility in managing their own accounts\u2014\nwill  modernize  the  distribution  system  and  bring  it  technologically  up  to  date.  Further,  system \nefficiency improvements and loss reductions to about 10% will improve NEA\u2019s financial health, \nwhile customers will benefit from more reliable and better electricity supply and less dependence \non diesel generators. Operational upgrades will also aid the integration of new generation capacity \n\n                                                \n5  This line has a capacity of at least 1,000 MW. \n6  The last planned systematic reinforcement was carried out about 15 years ago with the assistance from the Japan \n\nInternational Cooperation Agency. \n\n\fscheduled to come on line in the next 3\u20134 years. A project that covers these specific areas can \neasily be replicated in other cities in the country. \n \n9. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  the  leading  partner  in  Nepal\u2019s  energy \nsector, supporting a broad spectrum of interventions in generation, transmission, distribution, and \naccess to energy. Since 2014, ADB\u2019s overall investment strategy has followed a logical sequence: \n(i) improve reliability and quality of grid-supplied electricity through network expansion, efficiency \nimprovements,  and  expanded  imports;  (ii)  rationalize  tariffs,  with  eventual  elimination  of  non-\nlifeline  subsidies;  (iii)  mobilize  TA  to  develop  large-scale  hydropower  generation;  (iv) provide \nadditional  financing  for  national  grid  connected  utility-sale  solar  power  development;  and  (v) \ncontinue financing for access to energy via renewable energy mini grids, supply-side efficiency, \nand  other  \u201clast  mile\u201d  interventions.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2013\u20132017  for  Nepal \nsupports the government's development objective of accelerated and inclusive economic growth, \nand tackles infrastructure bottlenecks in key areas such as energy services in order to create an \nenabling environment for increased business and employment opportunities.7 This project will be \nADB\u2019s first  investment  in Nepal  that  specifically focuses  on  energy  efficiency  by  improving the \ndistribution system.8 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact will be reliable and efficient electricity supply for all achieved, aligned with the \n10. \nGovernment of Nepal\u2019s action plan to overcome the country\u2019s energy crisis.9 The outcome will be \nimproved access to efficient, adequate, and high-quality power supply in the Kathmandu Valley. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \n\nThe main outputs of this project will be: \n(i) \n\nTransmission grid capacity to feed the primary distribution networks for the \nKathmandu Valley strengthened. Six new grid gas-insulated substations will be \nincluded  under  this  component.  A  220/132  kV  160  MVA  substation  each  at \nBarhabise  and  Laphsiphedi  and  a  132/11  kV  45  MVA  substation  at \nChangunarayan  are  necessary  to  help  complete  the  Tamakoshi\u2013Kathmandu \n220/400 kV transmission line project, which will then provide vital power supply to \nKathmandu from the power-generating stations that are being constructed in the \nKhimti (Tamakoshi) and Barhabise areas. Another three 132/11 kV 45 MVA each \nsubstations in Chapagaun, Mulpani, and Phutung will feed in necessary power to \nthe Kathmandu Valley. \nKathmandu Valley distribution network rehabilitated and capacity increased. \nThis  covers  distribution  system  automation  and  the  rehabilitation  of  low-voltage \nand  medium-voltage  networks,  initially  in  the  central  and  northern  distribution \ncenters of the Kathmandu Valley. The majority of the new and existing construction \nwill be underground, since overhead distribution is impractical in densely populated \nareas where access roads are very narrow. \nOperational and financial performance of NEA distribution centers enhanced. \nSingle-phase  and  three-phase  smart  meters  with  associated  communication \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n                                                \n7  ADB. 2013.

The \nestablishment of a dedicated PMD for ADB projects and streamlined internal NEA management \npractices (such as having a managing director to make all procurement decisions) has improved \nNEA\u2019s performance in project implementation. Project supervision consultants will be recruited to \nsupport  NEA  in  implementing  the  project.  All  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). As requested \nby NEA, advance contracting and retroactive financing will be considered, subject to a ceiling of \n20% and a time limit of not more than 12 months prior to the date of the loan agreement. ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) will be followed. \n \n16. \nThe project is expected to be completed by December 2021. With the exception of  one \nsupply  contract,  turnkey  contracts  will  be  tendered  for  project  implementation.  Construction \nactivities will require 48 months to complete. The total time for project implementation after loan \neffectiveness  is  estimated  at  4.5  years  for  detailed  design,  engineering,  tender  preparation, \nevaluation, contract award, construction, and commissioning. The government will set up a high-\nlevel coordination committee representing key government agencies and other stakeholders to \nensure proper coordination between different agencies dealing with road, water supply, sewage, \ntelecommunication office, and cable television operators during the implementation of this project. \n \n17. \nthe project administration manual.12 \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated loan closing date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)   Key implementing agencies \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing and/or advance \ncontracting \nDisbursement \n\nArrangements \nJuly 2017\u2013December 2021 \n31 December 2021  \n30 June 2022 \n\nSteering committee chaired by Secretary, Ministry of Energy  \nNepal Electricity Authority \nProject Management Directorate, Nepal Electricity Authority \nProject Management Directorate (Matatirtha office) \nInternational \ncompetitive bidding \nQuality- and cost-\nbased selection \n\n7 contracts \n\n$143.7 million \n\n$6.3 million \n\n1 contract \n329 person-months \n(125 international and \n204 national) \n\nAdvance contracting for goods, works and consulting services, and \nretroactive financing for works up to a maximum of 20% of loan amount. \nThe loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time), \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time), and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the \ngovernment and ADB. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, JFPR = Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Nepal Electricity Authority. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n\nCapacity development TA is attached to the loan and supported by the Japan Fund for \n18. \nPoverty  Reduction.

An  international  consultancy  firm,  in  partnership  with  a  national  nongovernment \norganization or a firm, will provide technical support for TA implementation. Consultants will be \nrecruited  using  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime). A GESI action plan of the project includes all activities under the TA support.  Necessary \nconsultations were held with NEA and ESSD officials, and the National Association of Community \nElectricity Users Nepal, and the TA concept and its implementation modality were agreed upon. \nDetails are included in the attached TA.14 \n \nThe  TA  will  provide  much-needed  capacity  development  support  to  ensure  that  under \n19. \nNEA\u2019s  operations,  the  energy  needs  of  poor  and  disadvantaged  communities  are  addressed; \nsocial  safeguard  risks minimized;  and GESI results  and  impacts maximized,  documented,  and \nreported upon. The TA, estimated to cost $2 million, will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, \noffice space and supplies, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n20. \nThe  project  aims  to  enhance  the  quantity  and  quality  of  power  supplied  to  NEA\u2019s \ncustomers in Kathmandu Valley which would require (i) augmentation of transmission substation \nfor  supply  to  Kathmandu  Valley;  (ii)  reconstruction  and  upgrading  of  medium  voltage  and  low \nvoltage distribution networks in Kathmandu Valley; and (iii) introduction of smart grid elements in \nKathmandu  Valley.  With  this  objective  and  due  to  the  inherent  interconnectedness  of  each  of \nthese areas, technical due diligence was undertaken on all outputs and confirmed that the cost \nestimates are reasonable and unit costs compare favorably with similar recent projects in India \nand Nepal. The work program provides for grid substations to complete the 400 kV transmission \nlink  (initially  operated  at  220  kV)  from  Tamakoshi  to  Kathmandu  and  to  bring  much-needed \ntransmission capacity to the Kathmandu Valley. In addition, new grid substations will interconnect \nwith the 400 kV transmission line to the medium-voltage system inside the Kathmandu Valley. \nThis will ensure reliable and secure electricity services to NEA\u2019s customers. \n \nThe distribution components include, in a first phase, the rehabilitation of low-voltage and \n21. \nmedium-voltage  networks  in  NEA\u2019s  central  and  northern  distribution  centers,  which  supply \nelectricity  to  more  than  90,000  existing  customers  in  Kathmandu\u2019s  central  city  area,  including \n\n                                                \n13 The firm engaged will also help NEA in ensuring the implementation and monitoring of resettlement and rehabilitation \n\nefforts of people affected by the project. \n\n14  Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fgovernment offices and many hotels, restaurants, and establishments critical to the local economy \nand the tourism industry. The project will introduce single-phase and three-phase smart meters \nin  keeping  with  modern  international  practice.  This  will  allow  automated  remote  customer \nmetering with the ability for both prepayment and post-payment, enhance the consumer interface, \neliminate  manual  meter  reading  with  its  inherent  errors,  and  contribute  significantly  to  the \nreduction in nontechnical losses. \n \n22. \nThe proposed transmission facilities follow planning and design practices already being \nimplemented by NEA in other projects. The proposed distribution system investment will introduce \nnew  planning  and  design  practices  and  innovative  technology  to  NEA  and  Nepal,  reflecting \ninternational  best  practice.  Overall,  the  proposed  works  are  in keeping  with  international  good \npractice and are considered technically acceptable. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n23. \nFinancial analysis of the project was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nFinancial Management and Analysis of Projects.15 All financial costs and benefits are expressed \nin constant 2016 prices. NEA\u2019s weighted average cost of capital was estimated at 0.5% (in pretax \nreal terms). On the basis that the average retail electricity does not decline further in real terms, \nthe project is forecast to deliver a financial internal rate of return of 7.9%. \n \n24. \nThe project was analyzed for economic viability in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nEconomic  Analysis. 16  A  \u201cwith  project\u201d  and  \u201cwithout  project\u201d  framework  was  adopted.  The \neconomic internal rate of return of the project is 14.1%, above the economic hurdle rate of 9%. \nSensitivity analysis demonstrates that the project\u2019s expected economic performance is somewhat \nsensitive to demand growth. However, the analysis considers that the benefits of the project are \nnot  expected  to  be fully  realized  until further  investments  are  made to improve the  distribution \nsystem in Kathmandu Valley.  \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n25. \nThe  assessment  of  NEA\u2019s  financial  management,  prepared  in  2014,  was  updated  in \naccordance  with  ADB  guidelines. 17  Key  financial  management  risks  include  (i)  the  current \nspreadsheet-based accounting system, which is inflexible, prone to errors, and inadequate for an \nentity of NEA\u2019s size and complexity; (ii) inflated assets and liabilities requiring write-down; and (iii) \ninadequate resolution of audit issues, among others. A further concern arises from the foreign \nexchange risk on development partner loans, including those of ADB, being transferred to NEA. \nA time-bound financial management action plan has been developed and agreed upon with the \ngovernment and NEA, and will be implemented in close consultation with ADB.18 Based on the \nabove, NEA\u2019s overall pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial.  \n \n26. \nA procurement capacity assessment of NEA was conducted as part of the due diligence. \nNEA  has  sufficient  capacity  and  experience  in  local  and  foreign  procurement,  including  ADB \nstandard bidding procedures, under domestic projects and external assistance from international \n\n                                                \n15 ADB. 2005.

The  results  of  the  integrity  due  diligence  conducted  for  NEA  were \nsatisfactory. \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and NEA. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n\n \nPoverty and Social  \n\nD. \n\n28. \nNepal\u2019s per capita gross domestic product is one of the lowest in the world at around $766. \nMost of the country\u2019s population (about 80%) live in rural areas where poverty is more prevalent \nand severe. The Government of Nepal, through the Sustainable Development Goal #1, aims to \nfurther reduce poverty significantly by the end of 2030. However, limited access to modern energy \nresources and inefficient grid connectivity have been hindering development. The project aims to \nenhance the distribution capacity and improve the reliability and quality of electricity supply in the \nKathmandu Valley. The project will also relieve the existing distribution system of overloading and \nhelp reduce technical losses in the project areas. This will improve the efficiency of energy use \nand  grid  connectivity,  and  control  electricity  leakage,  as  needed.  Further,  the  project  activities \nalso  create  employment  for  the  local  poor  and  socially  disadvantaged  people  during  the \nimplementation phase. People, including poor or vulnerable consumers and women, will benefit \nfrom  the  project  thanks  to  jobs  for  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  during  construction  and  beyond. \nMoreover,  using cleaner  energy  will  improve urban  and  rural  air quality, people\u2019s  health,  living \nconditions, and the quality of life. The project includes a GESI action plan supported through the \nattached TA,  which  ensures  participation  in,  access to,  and benefits for women, the  poor,  and \nexcluded groups from the project activities. The TA aims to boost community awareness of safe \nand efficient electricity use,  and provide energy-based enterprise development training to poor \nwomen members of electricity user cooperatives, and GESI capacity building for members of the \nNational Association of Community Electricity Users Nepal, which will help improve the livelihoods \nof poor communities. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment.  The  project \n\nis  classified  as  environment  category  B.  An \n\ninitial \n29. \nenvironmental  examination  was  prepared  following  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009) \nand the government's environmental regulations, and disclosed on the ADB website on 8 May \n2017. Public consultations were held in the project areas, and more consultations with a special \nfocus on women and vulnerable groups will take place going forward. NEA will set up a grievance \nredress  mechanism.  The  project  is  not  expected  to  cause  significant  environmental  impacts. \nPotential impacts may arise from earthmoving for new substations and from burying distribution \nlines.  The  potential  impacts  are  temporary,  predictable,  and  reversible  and  can  be  mitigated \nthrough adherence to national and international standards, design criteria, and implementation of \nenvironmental management plans (EMPs). The project is not located within or adjacent to cultural \nsites, national parks, sanctuaries, or protected areas. A 400 kV transmission line was identified \nas the associated facility of the project. Environmental and social assessments of the transmission \nline  were  prepared  in  accordance  with  Government  of  Nepal  and  ADB  requirements,  and  no \nissues related to environmental management exist. The EMPs include budgets that are sufficient \nto  ensure  proper  implementation  of  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures.  Environmental  and \nsocial safeguard experts are included in the scope of implementation consulting services. NEA\u2019s \nPMD will supervise EMP implementation, and submit environmental monitoring reports to ADB \nsemiannually during construction and annually during operation. Contractors will be required to \ncomply  with the  EMPs  during  preconstruction  and construction,  closely monitored  by  a  project \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fsupervision consultant and NEA. EMPs will be updated as necessary if unanticipated impacts are \nidentified  during  implementation.  NEA  has  experience  in  implementing  ADB  projects,  and \nsufficient  capacity  to  implement  the  environment  safeguards,  using  third-party  services  as \nnecessary. \n \n30. \nResettlement and indigenous peoples. The project is categorized as A for involuntary \nresettlement and C for indigenous peoples. Six substations require the acquisition of private land, \n22.62 hectares in total, which will affect an estimated 174 households with 997 people. Further, \neight  permanent  and  four  temporary  structures  need  to  be  relocated.  Among  the  affected \nhouseholds,  142  are  losing  more  than  10%  of  their  land.  Surface  disturbance  during  the \nconstruction of underground distribution lines and overhead line restringing will have temporary \nimpacts. Social surveys and consultations were undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. The project\u2019s social impacts were adequately assessed, and compensation will \nbe paid to the affected people commensurate with the impacts. A resettlement plan covering all \ncomponents  was  prepared  and  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  on  5 May  2017.  Budgetary \nprovisions are in place to compensate affected people, including non-titleholders, for their losses \nin  a  timely  manner.  The  loan  agreement  will  include  a  standard  assurance  related  to  the \nresettlement impacts and social matters. NEA has its own environment division, which also covers \nsocial  aspects,  and  they  have  previous  experience  with  land  acquisition.  The  PMD  to  be \nestablished for the project will include a social specialist, and implementing consultants will be \nengaged to assist the PMD and strengthen its capacity. The implementation of the resettlement \nplan will be monitored and supervised by NEA and an external monitoring agency, and monitoring \nreports will be submitted to ADB semiannually. The resettlement plan covers due diligence for the \nindigenous peoples, and the project does not have any impacts on their dignity, human rights, \nlivelihood system, culture territories, or natural resources. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.19 The overall risk, after mitigation measures are \nput in place, is low to moderate. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh \nthe costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nPoor financial health of NEA \n\nWeak internal controls and \ncorporate governance \n\nRegulatory function does not \nensure cost-reflective tariffs \n(wholesale and retail) \n\nMitigating Measures \n(i) NEA will submit a financial restructuring plan to the government to convert debt into \nequity, write down assets, and recover receivable arrears. (ii) A foreign exchange risk \nmanagement policy will be established. (iii) The government will exempt NEA from all \ntaxes  and  duties  on  project-related  procurement,  except  for  1%  customs  levy  on \nimported  equipment  and  13%  value-added  tax  on construction.  (iv)  Annual  inflation-\nlinked tariff adjustments, with lifeline tariffs, will be in place for poor consumers. \nNEA  will  disclose  on  the  project  website  the  audited  project  financial  statements, \nproject  progress,  procurement  short  lists,  invitations  for  bid,  and  contract  awards.  A \nrisk-based internal audit manual will be approved and put in place. \n(i)  ETFC  needs  to  evolve  into  an  independent  regulatory  agency  free  from  political \ninterference.  To  do  so  successfully,  ETFC  should  receive  advisory  services  and \ncapacity  building.  (ii)  The  government  is  pursuing  various  policy  reforms  where  the \nissue of cost-effective tariffs will be addressed.  \n\n                                                \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nEnergy sector governance \ndoes not evolve,  absence of \neffective coordination, and \nfull project benefits not \nrealized due to delay in other \nplanned generation, \ntransmission and distribution \nprojects   \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ETFC = Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission, NEA = Nepal Electricity Authority. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nMitigating Measures \nNEA and the government will continue to implement reforms and obligations under prior \ncommitments to ADB and other development  partners, and respond positively to the \ncontinuing policy dialogue with ADB in this regard. The government will set up a high-\nlevel  coordination  committee  to  liaise  with  different  agencies  involved  in  urban \ninfrastructure and service delivery. NEA and the government will also continue pushing \nfor other generation, transmission and distribution projects implementation in parallel.  \n\n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe  government  and  NEA  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \n32. \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n33. \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \n\nThe government  and  NEA  have agreed with ADB  on  certain covenants for  the  project, \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n34. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR109,229,000  ($150,000,000  equivalent)20 to  Nepal  for  the  Power \nTransmission  and  Distribution  Efficiency  Enhancement  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources in concessional terms, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per year during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth \nin the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board.  \n \n \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n \n\n8 June 2017 \n \n\n                                                \n20 $1 = SDR0.724213 as of 19 May 2017. \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nReliable and efficient electricity supply for all achieved by 2030 (National Energy Crisis Reduction and \nElectricity Development)a \n\n \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nAccess to efficient, \nadequate, and high-\nquality power supply in \nthe Kathmandu Valley \nimproved \n\nOutputs \n1.

Kathmandu Valley has 200 MW of diesel gensets, which produced 340,000 \nMWh in 2012\u20132013. Assuming that this is all displaced by a mix of hydropower and imports from India, the greenhouse \ngas reductions will be 340,000 MWh/y x 0.16 tCO2e/MWh = 54,400 tCO2e/y. The effective emission factor for Upper \nTamakoshi plus India grid is calculated as: 1,997,280/7,008,000 x 0.82 = 0.64 tCO2e/MWh. This is subtracted from the \ndiesel emission factor to calculate net greenhouse gas reduction:  0.8 \u2013 0.64 = 0.16 tCO2e/MWh. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/RRPs/?id=50059-002-3  \n\nLoan Agreement \n\nProject Agreement \n\nSector Assessment (Summary): Energy \n\nProject Administration Manual \n\nContribution to the ADB Results Framework \n\nDevelopment Coordination \n\nAttached Technical Assistance \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nCountry Economic Indicators \n\nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n\nGender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan \n\nInitial Environmental Examination \n\nResettlement Plan \n\nRisk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nSupplementary Documents \n\nDetailed Technical Description \n\nTechnical and Economic Review of Distribution Voltage in Kathmandu Valley \n\nFinancial Management Assessment \n\nProject Climate Risk Assessment and Management Report \n\n \n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\n10. \n\n11. \n\n12. \n\n13. \n\n14. \n\n15. \n\n \n\n16. \n\n17. \n\n18. \n\n19. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 22 May 2017) \n= \n= \n= \n", "Currency unit \nNRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "Nepalese rupee/s (NRe/NRs) \n$0.0096659 \nNRs103.4560 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nEMP \nESSD \nGESI \nkV \nMW \nNEA \nPAM \nPMD \nTA \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nenvironmental management plan \nEnvironment and Social Studies Department \ngender equality and social inclusion \nkilovolt \nmegawatt \nNepal Electricity Authority \nproject administration manual \nProject Management Directorate \ntechnical assistance \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government of Nepal and its agencies ends on 15 July. \n\u201cFY\u201d before a calendar year denotes the year in which the fiscal year ends, e.g., \nFY2015 ends on 15 July 2015.  \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n", "W.
