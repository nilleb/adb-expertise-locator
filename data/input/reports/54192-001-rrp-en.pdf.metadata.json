THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure \nSupport (CARES) Program under the Countercyclical Support Facility COVID-19 pandemic \nresponse option (CPRO).1 \n \n2.  Afghanistan is classified as a fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCAS) country. The \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has adversely impacted Afghanistan\u2019s economy and \nits population. To mitigate these impacts, the government has adopted emergency pro-poor \ncountercyclical measures and expenditures to strengthen the health system, expand social \nprotection, and support macroeconomic stabilization and job creation. The proposed program will \nsupport the government\u2019s COVID-19 countercyclical pandemic response and financing needs to \nhelp mitigate the adverse health, social, and economic impacts of the crisis, while targeting poor \nand vulnerable groups and ensuring gender mainstreaming.2  \n \n3.  Afghanistan meets all the criteria required to access the CPRO under the Countercyclical \nSupport Facility (Table 1 and Appendix 4). The program is fully aligned with the operational \npriorities in Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2019s Strategy 2030 (with a differentiated approach for \nFCAS) related to (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, (ii) accelerating \nprogress in gender equality, (iii) promoting rural development and food security, (iv) strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity, and (v) fostering regional cooperation and integration.3  \n \nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria for COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option  \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \n1.  Adverse impact  As of 23 November 2020, 44,706 COVID-19 cases were reported with 1,687 deaths. The \nof  economy has deteriorated during the pandemic with business lockdowns, disruptions in \nexogenous  supply chains, a downturn in trade and remittances, and a drop in consumer income and \nshocks  demand. The IMF\u2019s 2020 projections indicate (i) a GDP contraction of 5.0% in contrast to a \nGDP growth of 3.9% in 2019, (ii) a widening of the current account deficit\u2013GDP ratio \n(excluding official transfers) to 30.6% from 27.0% in 2019, and (iii) a widening of the budget \ndeficit\u2013GDP ratio (excluding grants and loans) to 21.2% from 13.9% in 2019. The budget \ndeficit\u2013GDP ratio (including grants and loans) is projected to increase to 3.0% in 2020 from \n1.1% in 2019. Official reserves remain stable at $8.9 billion with 14.3 months of import \ncoverage in 2020. The afghani\u2013dollar exchange rate has appreciated by 1%, driven by lower \nimports and high currency demand by Afghan nationals in provinces. The national poverty \nrate is projected to reach at least 61.0% (and potentially 72.0%) in 2020 from 54.5% in 2017, \nwith an additional 1.9 million\u20136.0 million people falling into poverty. The unemployment rate \nis projected to rise to 37.9% in 2020 from 23.9% in 2019. \n2.  Countercyclical  On 16 March 2020, the government established the High-level Committee for COVID-19 as \ndevelopment  an inter-ministerial taskforce, chaired by the president and the first vice-president, and rolled \nexpenditures  out its pro-poor countercyclical pandemic response package with gender focus covering \nhealth-related  measures  aligned  with  the  NERP,  social  protection  measures  and \nmacroeconomic  stabilization  measures  (paras.  17\u221220).  Under  the  instructions  of  this \ncommittee, the MOF made two amendments to the 2020 national budget approved by the \npresident\u2014in April 2020 and July 2020\u2014and a revision during the midyear review in \nSeptember 2020, approved by the cabinet, to reprioritize resources for the pandemic \nresponse package of $633.92 million (3.3% of GDP). \n3.  Pre-shock  Afghanistan  has  maintained  a  generally  sound  pre-shock  record  of  macroeconomic \nrecord of  management, anchored to the structural reforms under the IMF\u2019s ECF during 2016\u22122019. \ngenerally  Pre-shock GDP growth was 2.6% in 2017, 1.2% in 2018, and 3.9% in 2019. Inflation has \nfallen from 5.0% in 2017 to 0.6% in 2018 and 2.3% in 2019. A broadly balanced fiscal stance \n \n1 Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2020.

", "2   \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nsound  has been maintained with pre-shock budget deficit (including grants and loans)\u2013 GDP ratios \nmacroeconomic  of 0.7% in 2017 and 1.1% in 2019, while having a surplus of 1.6% in 2018. International \nmanagement  reserves (more than $8 billion during 2017\u22122019) accounted for 14.5 months of imports in \n2019. The public debt\u2013GDP ratio has been stable at around 6% with concessional external \nborrowing. The current account surplus including official transfers has increased from 7.6% \nin 2017 to 12.2% in 2018 and 11.7% in 2019. Macroeconomic management during the \npandemic has been on track. \n4.  Structural  The MOPH approved the NERP and an action plan in March 2020. A national lockdown and \nreforms (health  travel  restrictions  were introduced  in  March  2020, followed  by  social distancing  and \nsector  containment measures until August 2020. Provincial emergency committees were formed in \nresponse)  April 2020 in 34 provinces. The MOPH has undertaken the following public health  measures: \n(i) strengthening medical facilities, testing laboratories, and surveillance; (ii) procuring \nmedical equipment; (iii) recruiting, training, and providing incentive payments for medical \nstaff; and (iv) running a public awareness campaign. The medium- and long-term measures \ninclude the strategy for national health security agenda for all hazards and pandemic \npreparedness, and capacity building of the MOPH by development partners. \n5.  Debt  The IMF provided concessional budget support loans totaling $590 million in 2020. The \nsustainability  government received infrastructure project loans of $208 million from some development \npartners. Based on ADB\u2019s recent DSA,a these loans will increase the public debt\u2013GDP ratio \nfrom 6.3% of GDP in 2019 to 10.7% in 2020 and 16.6% in 2021, but the ratio is projected to \ndecline to 13.4% in 2024. These loans will not increase the annual debt service obligations, \nand debt sustainability will not be significantly affected. The public debt consisting of \nconcessional loans will stay moderately low. ADB\u2019s $100 million grant will help create fiscal \nspace and improve debt sustainability. The IMF\u2019s DSA (pre-shock and after the pandemic) \nand ADB\u2019s recent DSA rate Afghanistan at high risk of debt distress in the medium and long \nterm, mainly because of an expected decline in grants, which finance fiscal and external \ndeficits. Afghanistan is eligible for the DSSI and will benefit from potential DSSI savings. \n6.  Coordination  The government has worked closely with the IMF, supporting its countercyclical measures. \nwith the IMF  IMF approved two budget support loans: SDR161.9 million ($220 million) under RCF in April \n2020 and SDR259.04 million ($370 million) under ECF in November 2020. Afghanistan \nreceived debt service relief of SDR4.8 million ($6.8 million) in 2020 under CCRT. IMF \nprovided  its  assessment  report  under  the  ECF,  confirming  sound  macroeconomic \nmanagement.

Since the first COVID-19 case was reported on 23 February \n2020, based on World Health Organization (WHO) data the number of confirmed cases reached \n44,706 with 1,687 deaths as of 23 November 2020. The government\u2019s capacity constraints in the \nhealth sector and limited infrastructure have affected the developmental and health-related \nservices.4 An ongoing armed conflict and political uncertainties, including about the intra-Afghan \npeace negotiations during 2020, have further complicated the fragile health situation.5  \n \n4  Afghanistan ranks 170th out of 180 economies in the human development index (overall 0.496, 0.360 for women and \n0.583 for men) in 2019. Only 32% of the population have access to grid-connected electricity and 43% use improved \nsanitation facilities. United Nations Development Programme. 2019.

Afghanistan is a landlocked country with a population of 38.9 million. It borders Iran, the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, Pakistan, as well as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan in the \nCentral Asia region, which are vital for regional trade and employment. The influx of 671,759 \nreturning Afghan migrants and refugees from Iran and Pakistan during January\u2212October 2020 \nhas accelerated the spread of the virus because of the limited border surveillance, testing, and \nquarantine capacity.6 According to the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian \nAffairs, about 400,000 people were internally displaced as a result of the conflict or disasters from \nnatural hazards in 2019, with an additional 86,419 people displaced by the end of May 2020. \nThese factors have complicated the provision of health and social services during the pandemic.  \n \n6.  A health emergency of such magnitude has aggravated the pressures on the country\u2019s \npublic-sector-led health care system, providing mainly basic health care (with limited private \nhealth care providers), due to large deficiencies in hospital beds, medical personnel, equipment, \nand testing capacity.7 Hospitals also faced challenges to provide health services in areas of active \nconflict. The health care expenditures are primarily borne by high out-of-pocket expenditures of \nthe households (73%) because of lack of health insurance, while the rest is covered by the \ngovernment  (6%)  and  international  donors  (21%). 8  With  inadequate  personal  protective \nequipment, as of October 2020, 10% of the COVID-19 infections were among health care \nprofessionals, and their subsequent deaths are undermining the response capacity.9 Afghanistan \nranks 161st out of 195 economies in its capacity to rapidly respond to and mitigate the spread of \nthe epidemic, with a score of 23.6 out of 100 based on the Global Health Security Index in 2019.10 \nBecause there is no national death register, COVID-19 cases and deaths are underreported.11 \nUnder the scenario of easing community restrictions, daily infections (including those not tested) \ncould reach 36,840 by 1 March 2021 with 2,808 deaths, requiring 10,797 hospital beds (2,002 \nintensive care unit beds) compared to 5,286 beds (440 intensive care unit beds) available.12 \n \n7.  Pre-shock record of generally sound macroeconomic management. Despite political \nuncertainties and economic shocks triggered by natural hazards, Afghanistan has maintained a \nsound  record  of  macroeconomic  management  leading  up  to  the  crisis. 13 The  structural \nmacroeconomic, fiscal, and governance reforms have been anchored under the Extended Credit \nFacility  (ECF)  of  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),14 implemented  from  July  2016 to \n \na peace agreement with the Taliban remain uncertain. Despite calls for a ceasefire, attacks have led to 3,403 civilian \ndeaths and 6,989 injuries in 2019, and 2,117 deaths and 3,822 injuries during January\u2212September 2020.  \n6  United Nations International Organization for Migration.

The number of health care professionals \nhas been low, with 2.7 physicians and 3.2 nurses and midwives per 10,000 population in 2015.

Afghanistan achieved gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth of 2.6% in 2017, 1.2% in 2018, and 3.9% in 2019. The Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) \nhas been committed to price stability supported by exchange rate flexibility. Inflation has fallen \nfrom 5.0% in 2017 to 0.6% in 2018 and 2.3% in 2019. DAB has strengthened the financial \nsupervision by establishing the Financial Stability Committee. With continued aid inflows (about \n40% of GDP), the government has maintained a balanced fiscal stance with budget deficit \n(including grants and loans)\u2013GDP ratios of 0.7% in 2017 and 1.1% in 2019, while having a fiscal \nsurplus of 1.6% in 2018. International reserves (more than $8 billion during 2017\u22122019) have \nremained comfortable at 14.5 months of imports in 2019. The public debt\u2013GDP ratio has remained \nstable at about 6% under highly concessional borrowing. The current account surplus including \nofficial transfers has increased from 7.6% in 2017 to 12.2% in 2018 and 11.7% in 2019.  \n \n8.  Economic  impact  of  the  pandemic.  The  government  tightened  the  containment \nmeasures by placing Kabul and other urban centers under lockdown from late March until early \nAugust 2020. While the pre-shock macroeconomic management has been sound, the pandemic \nhas had a substantial negative economic impact because of the business closures, disruptions in \nsupply chains, downturn in trade and remittances, and drop in consumer demand. Based on IMF \nestimates, the economy is projected to contract by 5.0% in 2020 with a downturn in industry and \nservices, in contrast to the pre-COVID-19 GDP growth projection of 3.5% for 2020. In 2021, the \nGDP growth is projected to rebound to 4.0%.15 Under a more pessimistic scenario based on World \nBank estimates,16 incorporating the risks related to the second wave of infection, weather-related \nshocks, security challenges, political uncertainty, and potential decline in international grants, \nGDP contraction could range between 5.5% and 7.4% in 2020 with only 1.0% GDP growth in \n2021. ADB estimates GDP contraction of 5% in 2020 and 1.5% GDP growth in 2021.17  \n \n9.  Fiscal pressure. Based on IMF estimates, domestic revenues are projected to decline to \n$2.31 billion (12.1% of GDP) in 2020 compared to $2.66 billion (14.1% of GDP) in 2019 and the \npre-COVID-19 2020 projection of $2.71 billion (13.0% of GDP). Expenditures are projected to \nincrease to $6.35 billion (33.3% of GDP) in 2020 driven by COVID-19 and pro-poor-related \nspending, compared to $5.28 billion (28.0% of GDP) in 2019 and the pre-COVID-19 2020 \nprojection of $5.56 billion (26.6% of GDP). The budget deficit excluding grants and budget support \nloans is projected to increase to $4.04 billion (21.2% of GDP) in 2020, compared to $2.62 billion \n(13.9% of GDP) in 2019 and the pre-COVID-19 2020 projection of $2.85 billion (13.6% of GDP).18 \n \n10.  International trade, reserves, and exchange rate. Between March and May 2020, \nalmost all border points with neighboring countries were closed with limited incoming shipments. \nBy the end of June 2020, most border points were reopened.19 Because of disruptions to land \nand air transport and lower demand in export markets, merchandise exports are projected to \ncontract by 35.4% and imports by 2.4% in 2020. The current account deficit\u2013GDP ratio is \nprojected to increase from 27.0% in 2019 to 30.6% in 2020. The current account including official \ntransfers as a share of GDP is projected to have a smaller surplus of 9.3% in 2020 compared to \n11.7% in 2019. The official reserves will increase to $8.9 billion in 2020 (compared to $8.6 billion \nin 2019), equivalent to 14.3 months of import coverage.

In 2019, the main export destinations are \nIndia (62%), Pakistan (21%), and the People\u2019s Republic of China (5%). Afghan imports come from the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (19%), Iran (18%), and Pakistan (14%). \n ", "5 \nslightly appreciated, driven by lower imports and increased demand for afghanis in provinces near \nPakistan, where its use was promoted instead of Pakistan rupees for domestic transactions.  \n \n11.  Inflation. Given Afghanistan\u2019s dependence on imported food and nonfood products, \nconsumer price inflation surged during the pandemic. The IMF figures indicate that inflation \nincreased from 2.3% in 2019 to 5.4% in 2020 and is forecast to remain high at 4.8% in 2021. The \nfood price inflation spiked in the first half of 2020 following imposition of border control and \nlockdown measures in urban centers. The food price inflation is forecast to reach 17.5% by the \nend of 2020 (with its period-average rate projected at 13.3% for the full year).20 Price volatility has \nmoderated  since  April  2020,  following  distribution  of  wheat  from  strategic  grain  reserves, \nenforcement of anti-price-gouging regulations, and the border reopening for food imports.  \n \n12.  Banking  sector.  Financial  soundness  and  profitability  of  the  banking  sector  have \ndeteriorated during the pandemic.21 Driven by withdrawal of savings and working capital by firms \nto meet business costs in the face of revenue declines, total banking sector deposits declined by \n3% in the first quarter of 2020. Annual growth in net credit to the private sector is projected to \ndrop from 1.8% in 2019 to 1.0% in 2020 because of the economic downturn and increasing risk \naversion by banks in response to declining debt servicing and repayment capacity of businesses. \nAs of June 2020, while the ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets stood at 26.7% (higher than the \nthresholds of 8.0% under Basel II and 10.5% under Basel III), the ratio of nonperforming loans to \ngross loans increased to 29.4% compared from 14.5% at the end of 2019.  \n \n13.  Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises and unemployment. Nearly 250,000 \nregistered micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) have been hit hard by the \npandemic.22 An impact assessment during May\u2013June 2020 showed that lockdowns and fall in \nconsumer demand have placed pressures on MSMEs because of supply chain disruptions, input \nshortages, loss of labor, forced sale of assets, limited working capital, cash flow shortages, \nrevenue losses, and lack of access to credit.23 Because of urban lockdowns, travel to retail stores \nand workplaces dropped by 50%. Financial inclusion is very weak, with only 15% of the adult \npopulation having a bank account and only 5% of MSMEs having access to a line of bank credit, \nwith most of the financing handled through hawalas (a money transfer arrangement in the informal \nsector) (footnote 9). MSMEs accounted for nearly 1.6 million jobs in services and industry, and \nMSMEs with less than 10 employees accounted for more than 80% of nonagricultural employment \nbefore the pandemic. The unemployment rate (including the informal sector) is projected to \nincrease from 23.9% in 2019 to 37.9% by the end of 2020. 24 If underemployment is added, the \nfigure will reach 53.5% of the labor force, corresponding to nearly 4.8 million people being either \nunemployed or underemployed in 2020 (an increase of 1.5 million people from previous year). \n \n14.  Remittances. Economic downturn in countries with large Afghan diasporas (e.g., Iran and \nPakistan) has affected households that rely on remittances. It is projected that remittances will fall \nby more than 50% in 2020 from the nearly $868 million received in 2019 (footnote 16). \n \n20 Afghanistan relies on wheat imports from Kazakhstan (61%) and Pakistan (23%). With border closures, restrictions \non wheat exports by Kazakhstan in the first quarter of 2020 and panic buying in March 2020, wheat prices increased \nby 32% in Kabul by May 2020. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the wheat \nprices in September 2020 remained 25% higher than the pre-pandemic price level.  \n21 The banking sector made a loss in the first quarter of 2020, with a return on asset ratio of \u20130.13% compared to 0.83% \nin December 2019.

Poverty. The World Bank estimates that because of COVID-19, the national poverty rate \ncould increase to at least 61.0% (and potentially to 72.0%) from 54.5% in 2017, 25 forcing an \nadditional 1.9 million\u20136.0 million people into poverty by the end of 2020 (footnote 16). Lockdown \nmeasures, supply disruptions, and reduced crop sales have impacted the agriculture sector, \naccounting  for  44%  of the  workforce  and  60%  of  household  incomes.  The  pandemic  has \ndeteriorated the livelihoods of urban households, especially for daily wage earners in the informal \nsector. Day labor from activities like shopkeeping, street or market sales, construction, or personal \nservices accounts for more than 40% of non-agricultural employment for the bottom quintile, \ncorresponding to 2 million households (15 million Afghans). Up to 80% of employment is in the \ninformal sector, with no social and legal protection for workers. Spikes in prices of staple foods \ndue to shortages or disruptions in food supply have adversely affected households in the bottom \n60%, for whom food purchases comprise half of their total consumption. About 12.4 million \nAfghans could be pushed into food insecurity, disproportionately affecting women and children.26  \n  \n16.  Impact on women and the vulnerable population. The pandemic has exacerbated the \ngender-based inequalities27 as a result of (i) increased restrictions on women\u2019s participation in \nsocial and economic life because of the nationwide lockdown in addition to restrictions from the \ntraditional and patriarchal norms; (ii) limited access to gender-sensitive health care services, with \nonly 15% of nurses and 2% of medical doctors being female, and social norms prohibiting female \npatients  from  being  treated  by  male  doctors;  (iii)  inadequate  dissemination  of  COVID-19 \ninformation  because  of  lower  female  literacy  (18%)  compared  to  male  literacy  (62%);  (iv) \nincreasing economic dependence and risk of food insecurity as women have limited labor force \nparticipation (29% for working-age women in 2016) 28 and old-age pension coverage29 as well as \nhigher job losses compared to men, with more than 50% of employed women in MSMEs not able \nto come to work during the pandemic; (v) vulnerability to gender-based violence; and (vi) poor \naccess  to  sanitation.30 Ongoing  conflict  causing  casualties,  lockdown  measures,  and  the \npressures on the health system have aggravated the hardship faced by the families of the military \nand civilians killed during conflicts, and disabled veterans and civilians with special needs. \nInternally  displaced  families,  returning  migrants  and  refugees  face  difficulties  in  finding \nemployment and paying for basic food and housing, which have increased their debt. The \npandemic has affected 9 million school-age children, of which 39% are girls. Around 20% of \nwomen and 41% of children under 5 years of age are malnourished as of 2019 and this will likely \nincrease, underscoring the importance of food distribution for humanitarian assistance. \n \nB.  ADB Support through COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \n \n17.  Countercyclical COVID-19 pandemic response measures. On 16 March 2020, the \ngovernment established the High-level Committee for COVID-19 as an inter-ministerial task force, \nchaired by the president and the first vice-president, and rolled out its comprehensive pro-poor \ncountercyclical pandemic response package with gender focus. Under the instruction of this \ncommittee, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) made two amendments to the 2020 national budget\u2014\n \n25 The Afghanistan Living Conditions Survey reported that national poverty rate rose from 38% in 2012 to 54.5% in \n2017 due to worsening security and economic situation.

Health-related measures. The government responded to the COVID-19 emergency by \nintroducing a nationwide lockdown in late March 2020 followed by preventive social distancing \nand containment measures such as requirement for masks; closures of schools, businesses, and \npublic places; release of prisoners; and restrictions on public transportation until early August \n2020. Border crossings and flights resumed in mid-July 2020. Schools and universities reopened \nin phases since 22 August 2020. Provincial emergency committees were formed in April 2020, \ncomprising local administrators, civil society, and development partners in 34 provinces. The \npreventive measures have been implemented under the authority of the provincial governments. \nThe National Emergency Response Plan (NERP) for COVID-19 was approved by the Ministry of \nPublic Health (MOPH) in March 2020 and a new structure within the MOPH was created to \nimplement the NERP and the national action plan. The MOPH has been strengthening the \nreadiness and capacity of the medical facilities, including emergency procurement of medical \n ", "8   \nsupplies and equipment. These measures also have a gender focus with the establishment of \nwomen-only  treatment  facilities  in  hospitals  and  provision  of  appropriately  sized  personal \nprotective gear for female health workers.31 Fourteen COVID-19 testing labs were established \nacross the country with five in Kabul. Including the tests by the private hospitals, a capacity of \n5,500 tests per day has been reached. As of 19 November 2020, 133,691 tests were conducted, \nwhich is only 30% of the estimated need. In addition to the 525 MOPH sites, surveillance sites in \nairports, borders, and city entrances have been set up and mobile teams trained. The MOPH has \nrecruited and trained more than 6,000 medical staff with 3,000 new staff planned to be hired. \nMedical staff have been provided with salaries and incentive payments. A gender-sensitive public \nawareness campaign has been carried out by the MOPH and Ministry of Women Affairs in all \nprovinces, distributing more than 10 million pieces of COVID-19-related information, and a call \ncenter was set up at the MOPH. Given low female literacy, the Ministry of Women Affairs visited \nwomen in hospitals, jails, shelters, businesses, orphanages, and banks across 26 provinces to \nraise awareness and share gender-sensitive information. The street children were also supported \nwith sanitary kits. The medium- and long-term public health and preventive measures include the \nstrategy for national health security agenda for all hazards and pandemic preparedness under \nthe NERP, and capacity building of the MOPH with support from development partners. \n \n19.  Social protection measures. The government has undertaken several measures to \nmitigate the risks of food insecurity and rising poverty, and expand the coverage of social safety \nnets, targeting women and vulnerable people. The MOF provided an emergency cash transfer of \n$31.43 million to all provinces through the Independent Directorate of Local Governance given \nthe essential role of local governments in implementing containment measures and providing \nservices  and  social  support.  In  April,  to  address  food  shortages  and  stabilize  prices,  the \ngovernment opened the national food reserves for public use. A bread distribution program, \nsupervised by the first vice-president, was launched in all provinces in May 2020 and implemented \nby the local governments and municipalities. The program benefited more than 310,000 families \nbelow the poverty line, with bread distributed through local bakeries. One-time unconditional in-\nkind support of 4.5 kilograms of wheat was distributed to 1,000 poor families in Kabul in April 2020. \nIn coordination with the COVID-19 Emergency Committee and the Kabul mayor\u2019s office, the \ngovernment covered the water and electricity bills of 350,000 poor families, who had a bill equal \nto or less than AF1,000 ($13) for 2 months during the lockdown in April\u2013May 2020, providing relief \nto 1.5 million residents (50% of utility users) in Kabul. About 10% of the total households have \nbeen targeted as households headed by women for these in-kind and financial relief measures. \nThe government has continued coverage of 99,368 old-age pensioners, of whom 5,468 are \nwomen and 30,943 are female heirs. Out of 130,311 pensioners and female heirs (inclusive of \n9,379 new beneficiaries in 2020), 86,404 have biometric registration under the Electronic National \nIdentification Document (E-NID). A one-time cash transfer of AF6,000 per person was provided \nto 41,500 internally displaced persons and refugees. At the beginning of 2020, remuneration was \nprovided to 338,056 people, comprising both military and civilian disabled people and the families \n(including female heirs) of people killed during conflicts. Out of the total, 272,006 were civilians. \nDuring 2020, the remuneration coverage has been increased by 32,570 additional military and \ncivilian disabled people, and families of those killed during conflicts.  \n  \n20.  Macroeconomic stabilization measures. The government has rolled out measures to \nsupport the affected sectors and promote pro-poor and gender-inclusive job creation. Although \nthe government did not introduce any large tax waivers or deferrals, it extended tax filing deadlines \nfor the first and second quarters of the fiscal year by 45 days for individuals and business \ntaxpayers to ease tax compliance. The government supported the power utility company, Da \n \n31 Details on the NERP and enhancement of medical facilities are in Appendix 4 under the structural reforms. \n ", "9 \nAfghanistan Breshna Sherkat, by covering its losses from lower electricity demand and past-due \nelectricity bills of the government agencies pending for the last few years. To create nearly 1.9 \nmillion temporary jobs and 60,000 permanent jobs, the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and \nLivestock has supported processing and packaging units and cold storage at the rural community \nlevel under the government\u2019s Afghanistan Crop Management Project to prevent wastage of high-\nvalue perishable fresh fruit and vegetables that could not be exported. On 1 October 2020, the \nHigh Economic Council of Afghanistan approved a 2-year MSME support package for $294.8 \nmillion, with $200.0 million to be provided in 2021 and the remainder in 2022. It provides (i) \nexemptions or deferments of tax penalties, municipality fees, and property rent for government \nland and buildings; (ii) first-loss fund to cover banks\u2019 losses from MSME lending; (iii) subsidized \nloans; (iv) support for industrial parks; (v) vocational training; and (vi) support for access to \ninternational markets (details in Appendix 4). On the monetary side, DAB has reduced the \nprovisioning requirements for loans covered by risk guarantees from the Afghan Credit Guarantee \nFoundation (ACGF) to sustain private sector lending.32 With this policy, bank credit to MSMEs \n(with ACGF guarantees) as a share of total bank lending is projected to be at least 17% by the \nend of 2021. The frequency of Financial Stability Committee meetings of DAB has been increased. \nThe DAB has developed a post-COVID-19 improvement plan for the banking sector until the end \nof 2021. DAB has (i) enforced the prudential requirements but also suspended the penalties and \nfees  with  no  retrospective  applications  for  breaches  or  noncompliance  until  July  2020,  (ii) \npostponed the implementation of the international financial reporting standards (IFRS-9) to June \n2021, and (iii) frozen loan classifications at the end of February 2020.33  \n \n21.  Debt sustainability analysis. Afghanistan has become eligible for the Debt Service \nSuspension Initiative (DSSI), endorsed by the World Bank\u2019s Development Committee and the \nG20 finance ministers in April 2020.34 The IMF has provided debt service relief of SDR4.80 million \n($6.8 million) under two tranches in April 2020 and October 2020, with a total relief of SDR10.05 \nmillion ($14.4 million) by 2022 under the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust.35 During the \npandemic, the IMF provided a concessional loan of SDR161.9 million ($220.0 million) under the \nRapid Credit Facility, approved on 29 April 2020 (footnote 13). A concessional IMF loan of \nSDR259.04 million ($370 million) under the 3.5-year ECF arrangement was approved on 6 \nNovember 2020.36 In 2020, Afghanistan also received infrastructure project loans of $208 million \nfrom some development partners. Based on ADB\u2019s recent debt sustainability analysis (DSA),37 \nthese loans will increase the public debt\u2013GDP ratio from 6.3% of GDP in 2019 to 10.7% in 2020 \nand 16.6% in 2021 but the ratio is projected to decline to 13.4% in 2024. They will not significantly \nincrease the annual debt service obligations or affect debt sustainability. ADB\u2019s $100 million grant \nwill help create fiscal space and improve debt sustainability. Public debt will stay moderately low, \nwith liabilities mostly consisting of concessional loans. This keeps borrowing costs low and limits \nrollover and interest rate risks, although the foreign currency denomination of public external debt \n \n32 The ACGF, a foundation based in Germany, supports partner banks and microfinance institutions for MSME \nfinancing. The ACGF provides guarantees for loans of $10,000\u2013$500,000 or equivalent in afghani. As of March 2020, \nthe ACGF cumulatively provided 5,500 guarantees for $238 million worth of MSME loans.

Coordination with the International Monetary Fund and development partners. ADB \nhas effectively coordinated with the IMF, the World Bank, and other development partners for \npandemic-related  assistance.39 The  coordination  primarily  rests  on  (i)  the  Geneva  Mutual \nAccountability Framework (GMAF), adopted in November 2018 and updated during the pledging \nconference on Afghanistan on 23\u221224 November 2020; and (ii) the monthly meetings between the \ndonor countries, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, the World Bank, and ADB. \nThe  COVID-19-related  grants  and  loans  of  the  development  partners  are  additional  and \ncomplement the government\u2019s pandemic response package by expanding its scope and outreach \nand  building  implementation  capacity.  The  IMF  plays  a  critical  role  in  strengthening  the \nmacroeconomic management in Afghanistan in line with the GMAF requirements. To create the \nfiscal space during the pandemic, the IMF approved two budget support loans of SDR161.9 \nmillion ($220.0 million) under the Rapid Credit Facility in April 2020 and SDR259.04 million \n($370.0 million) under the ECF in November 2020. The World Bank has approved several COVID-\n19-related grants, financed by the 2020\u22122023 commitments of the International Development \nAssociation and the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund and/or savings generated from the \nexisting projects.40 The World Bank\u2019s health and social sector projects and budget support have \nhelped mitigate pandemic risks, keep basic infrastructure functioning, and support the recovery. \nThe World Bank\u2019s social protection projects are estimated to cover more than 90% of the country \nunder  the  president\u2019s  Destarkhwan-e-Milli  program,  benefitting  4.1  million  households  with \nincomes of less than $2/day. Other development partners such as the WHO, the United Nations, \nthe European Union, and bilateral donors have provided medical equipment and supplies, support \nfor pandemic management, cash transfers, in-kind food, and relief packages. \n \nC.

The grants, approved in August 2020, included (i) $100 million under the Emergency Agriculture and \nFood Supply Project (EATS) to improve food security; and (ii) $280 million for the COVID-19 Relief Effort for Afghan \nCommunities and Households (REACH) Project to provide in-kind and cash support through community development \ncouncils for 2 million urban and peri-urban households, 363,000 urban households outside of Kabul, and 500,000 \nhouseholds in Kabul (of which 10% of the total households are targeted as households headed by women). Other \ngrants include (i) $100 million for the Strengthening Afghanistan\u2019s Financial Intermediation Project to support \nMSMEs; (ii) $193 million additional financing for the Citizens\u2019 Charter Afghanistan Project; (iii) $200 million for the \nAfghanistan Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Institutional Support Project; and (iv) $200 million for the Drought Early \nWarning, Finance, and Action Project to provide cash transfers to 500,000 households in 78 drought-prone districts.  \n ", "11 \n24.  Impact. The program is aligned with the following impact: adverse impacts of COVID-19 \non the population\u2019s health, incomes, and economic opportunities as well as macroeconomic \nstability mitigated. The effect of the program is the COVID-19 outbreak more effectively managed \nand its adverse social and economic impacts reduced. The program has three outputs: (i) COVID-\n19 response and health system strengthening measures implemented, (ii) social protection for the \npoor households expanded, and (iii) affected sectors supported to prevent job losses from the \neconomic downturn. The program is aligned with the ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2017\u2013\n2021 for Afghanistan41 and the government\u2019s development strategy.42 \n \n25.  Lessons learned. The program draws on lessons from ADB\u2019s operations in Afghanistan43 \nand incorporates key elements of FCAS-sensitive program design:44 (i) strengthening institutional \ncapacity  of  line  ministries  in  coordination  with  development  partners,  (ii)  governance  risk \nmitigation through enhanced oversight and due diligence, (iii) targeted social assistance and \nservice delivery for the poor and vulnerable people, and (iv) mainstreaming gender inclusion and \nequity.45 The program design incorporates key lessons from ADB\u2019s Countercyclical Support \nFacility loans: (i) adequate, timely, and flexible budget support for stabilization measures without \njeopardizing fiscal sustainability; (ii) targeting social protection; (iii) establishing mechanisms for \nexpenditure tracking and independent verification; and (iv) providing TA when country systems \nare weak. The program incorporates lessons from the budget support loans of other development \npartners in Afghanistan, such as (i) leveraging community-based institutions for targeting social \nassistance and (ii) focusing on economic recovery through multisector support. \n  \n26.  ADB\u2019s value addition. The CARES Program design is based on ADB\u2019s extensive policy \ndialogue with the government to enhance the scope of the pandemic response to include support \nfor MSMEs and expand social protection. The program is part of ADB\u2019s comprehensive support \nfor  COVID-19  in  Afghanistan.  It  complements  two  regional  TA  projects  to  increase  health \ncooperation in the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) countries and the \nCaucasus and to address the outbreak of COVID-19 and other communicable diseases,46 as well \nas the $40 million grant under the Emergency Assistance for COVID-19 Pandemic Response.47 \nADB\u2019s combined health sector support is a unique value addition for two reasons: (i) it strengthens \nthe readiness of the national health system by establishing treatment facilities in vulnerable \nprovinces; and (ii) it improves the resilience to future health emergencies by strengthening the \npreventive health care, which is critical for containing the pressures on the public health system \nin the event of a second wave of infections.

The emergency \nassistance covers (i) rehabilitation of five hospitals and the construction of 15 new hospitals; (ii) provision of capacity \nbuilding, medical equipment, and supplies for these hospitals; and (iii) capacity building of the MOPH for pandemic \nmanagement. There is no overlap between the emergency assistance and the CARES Program, which supports the \nMOPH\u2019s nationwide health measures (para. 18) that are funded under MOPH\u2019s own discretionary budget.  \n ", "12   \n2030,48 especially its operational cluster on human development and control of pandemic risks \nand communicable diseases. The program complements the ADB\u2019s ongoing and future support \nto Afghanistan in energy and transport infrastructure, private sector and rural development, fiscal \nmanagement, regional cooperation and trade facilitation through CAREC corridors. These areas \naddress the key development constraints for an inclusive post-COVID-19 economic recovery.  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n27.  Based on IMF estimates, the budget deficit excluding grants and loans has increased to \n$4.04 billion (21.2% of GDP) in 2020 compared to the pre-COVID-19 2020 projection of $2.85 \nbillion (13.6% of GDP) because of a sharp decline in revenues and rise in expenditures, including \nthe countercyclical pandemic response measures (paras. 17\u221220). The budget deficit, including \ngrants and loans, is projected to increase to $577.92 million (3.0% of GDP) in 2020 compared to \nthe pre-COVID-19 2020 projection of $161.04 million (0.8% of GDP) (Table 3). The government \nwill finance the deficit through the grant of $100 million from the CARES Program, its cash \nreserves, and other sources given that there is no government securities market for domestic \nborrowing. The government has requested a grant not exceeding $100 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund). The grant is expected to be disbursed in December \n2020. The grant size is based on Afghanistan\u2019s financing needs and development spending. \n \nTable 3: Development Financing Needs and Budget Support for 2020 \n($ million) \n \n2020 Projection \nItem  Pre-COVID-19a  Post- COVID-19  \nI.

Adverse Impact of  Health impact. Since the first COVID-19 case was reported in Herat on 23 February 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak \nExogenous Shocks  has reached 44,706 confirmed cases with 1,617 deaths as of 23 November 2020 based on WHO data. A public health \nemergency  caused  by  the  pandemic  has  aggravated  the  pressures  on  the  constrained  health  care  system \ninfrastructure and capacity due to large deficiencies in hospital beds, medical equipment, personnel, and testing \ncapacity. The fragile health situation in Afghanistan is further complicated by the ongoing armed conflict, insecurity \nand political uncertainties, influx of 666,257 Afghan migrants and refugees from Iran and 5,502 from Pakistan during \nJanuary\u2013October 2020, and more than 86,419 IDPs by the end of May 2020 due to conflict and disasters triggered by \nnatural hazards. Due to limited public health resources and testing capacity, reluctance of people coming forward for \ntesting due to social stigma on COVID-19, as well as the absence of a national death register, confirmed cases of and \ndeaths from COVID-19 are likely to be underreported across Afghanistan. The WHO notes that the official numbers \nare unlikely to be capturing the full scale of the situation since testing remains limited to only the most severe cases. \n \nBesides the challenges faced by hospitals to treat patients with COVID-19 and maintain health services, especially in \nareas of active conflict, the COVID-19 pandemic has put additional financial burden on the citizens, infected with the \nvirus. While the MOPH provides a basic package of health services (introduced in 2003) and an essential package of \nhospital services (introduced in 2005) together with the nongovernmental organizations, which are free for Afghan \ncitizens, in the absence of comprehensive health insurance, the cost of the health care expenditures is primarily borne \nby high out-of-pocket expenditures of the households (73%) while the rest is covered by the government (6%) and \ninternational donors (21%). The World Bank, the European Union, and the USAID are the three largest donors to both \npackages. With support from the USAID, the MOPH had earlier developed a document for health financing policy for \n2012\u22122020 and a strategy. However, absence of a legal framework for state-funded insurance schemes, gaps in the \ntaxation system and lack of risk pooling mechanisms for households have impeded the health insurance development. \n \nEconomic impact. Because of the lockdown measures since late March 2020 impacting local businesses, disruptions \nin supply chains, regional trade, and a drop in consumer demand with income shock borne by the households, the \npandemic has led to a sharp contraction in the economy. Based on the IMF estimates, in contrast to the pre-COVID-\n19 GDP growth projection of 3.5% for 2020, the economy is projected to contract by 5.0% in 2020 from a growth of \n3.9% in 2019. A growth of 5% in agriculture sector due to favorable weather conditions is offset by the projected \ncontraction in industry by 5% and in services by 9.6% in 2020.  \n \nFiscal pressure. The pandemic is creating significant fiscal pressure on Afghanistan. Based on IMF estimates, \ndomestic revenues are projected to decline to $2.31 billion (12.1% of GDP) in 2020 compared to $2.66 billion (14.1% \nof GDP) in 2019 and the pre-COVID-19 2020 projection of $2.71 billion (13.0% of GDP). Expenditures are projected \nto increase to $6.35 billion (33.3% of GDP) in 2020 driven by COVID-19 and pro-poor related spending compared to \n$5.28 billion (28.0% of GDP) in 2019 and the pre-COVID-19 2020 projection of $5.56 billion (26.6% of GDP).  \n \n ", "          Appendix 4  27 \nAccess Criteria  Asian Development Bank Assessment \n  The budget deficit excluding grants and loans is projected to increase to $4.04 billion (21.2% of GDP) in 2020 \ncompared to $2.62 billion (13.9% of GDP) in 2019 and the pre-COVID-19 2020 projection of $2.85 billion (13.6% of \nGDP). The pro-poor spending is projected to increase from 3.7% of GDP in 2019 to 5.3% of GDP in 2020 with \nadditional COVID-19 related expenditures undertaken, equivalent to 2.9% of GDP in 2020. The budget deficit including \ngrants and loans is projected to increase to $577.92 million (3.0% of GDP) in 2020 compared to the pre-COVID-19 \n2020 projection of $161.04 million (0.8% of GDP). \n  \nInternational trade, reserves, and exchange rate. Due to border closures, disruptions to land and air transport, and \nlower demand in Afghanistan\u2019s export markets, the merchandise exports are projected contract by 35.4% and the \nimports by 2.4% in 2020. The current account deficit\u2212GDP ratio is projected to widen from 27.0% in 2019 to 30.6% in \n2020. On the other hand, the current account including official transfers as a share of GDP is projected to have a \nsurplus of 9.3% in 2020 (compared to 11.7% in 2019). The official reserves will increase to $8.9 billion in 2020 \n(compared to $8.6 billion in 2019) equivalent to 14.3 months of import coverage. The afghani\u2013dollar exchange rate \nhas slightly appreciated (about 1%) driven by lower imports and increased demand for  afghanis in provinces \nneighboring Pakistan where its use was promoted instead of Pakistani rupees for domestic transactions. \n \nInflation. Given Afghanistan\u2019s dependence on imported food and non-food products, consumer price inflation (driven \nby food prices) is projected to increase from 2.3% in 2019 to 5.4% in 2020 and will remain high at 4.8% in 2021. The \nfood price inflation spiked in the first half of 2020 following the border controls and lockdown measures in urban \ncenters. The food price inflation is forecast to reach 17.5% by the end of 2020 (with its period-average rate projected \nat 13.3% for the full year). Price volatility has moderated since April 2020, following distribution of wheat from strategic \ngrain reserves, enforcement of anti-price-gouging regulations, and the reopening of borders for food imports.  \n \nBanking sector. With the pandemic, financial soundness and profitability of the banking sector have deteriorated. \nDriven by withdrawal of savings and working capital by firms due to economic difficulties, total deposits in the banking \nsector declined by 3% over the first four months of 2020. Credit growth to private sector is projected to drop from 1.8% \nin 2019 to 1.0% in 2020 because of the economic downturn and increasing risk aversion by banks in response to \ndeclining debt servicing and repayment capacity of businesses. As of June 2020, while the ratio of capital to risk-\nweighted assets stood at 26.7% (higher than the thresholds of 8.0% under Basel II and 10.5% under Basel III), the \nratio of nonperforming loans to gross loans increased to 29.4% compared from 14.5% at the end of 2019. The banking \nsector made a loss in the first quarter of 2020 reflected in a return on asset ratio of negative 0.13% down from a \npositive ratio of 0.83% in December 2019. The DAB has intensified monitoring and supervision of the banking sector.  \n \nMicro, small and medium-sized enterprises. Nearly 250,000 MSMEs that play a crucial role for the private sector \nhave been hit hard during the pandemic. The MSMEs accounted for nearly 1.6 million jobs in services and industry, \nand the MSMEs with less than 10 employees accounted for over 80% of non-agricultural employment before the \npandemic. Services accounted for 52.6% of Afghanistan\u2019s GDP while industry accounted for 24.1% and agriculture \n18.6% in 2018. As of August 2020, there were 218,226 micro enterprises; 7,776 small businesses; 20,187 medium-\nsized businesses; and 1,787 large businesses across Afghanistan. Around 62% of MSMEs operate in the provinces \n ", "28  Appendix 4 \nAccess Criteria  Asian Development Bank Assessment \nand the rest in Kabul. Micro enterprises comprise 88% of MSMEs. Out of 29,750 small, medium-sized and large \nbusinesses, only 10.6% are in manufacturing and the rest is in services sector. \n \nLockdown measures and fall in consumer demand have put immediate pressures on MSMEs due to disruption of \nsupply chains, shortage of inputs, loss of labor, forced sale of firms\u2019 assets, limited working capital, cash flow shortages \nin covering operating costs, loss of revenues and lack of access to credit. Due to urban lockdowns, travel to retail \nstores, transit service locations, and workplaces dropped by 50%. Financial inclusion is very weak in Afghanistan with \nonly 15% of the adult population having a bank account and only 5% of MSMEs having access to a line of bank credit. \nOver 50% of Afghan MSMEs are financially constrained with most of the financing handled through the informal sector \nmoney transfers (hawalas). The MSMEs owned or managed by women represent only 2% of the MSME financing. \n \nUnemployment. Job losses caused by business closures carry the risk of large-scale unemployment, estimated to \nincrease from 23.9% in 2019 to 37.9% by the end of 2020. If underemployment is added, the figure will reach 53.5% \nof the labor force, corresponding to nearly 4.8 million people (an increase of 1.5 million people from 2019) will be \neither unemployed or under-employed by the end of 2020. \n \nRemittances. Economic downturn in countries with large Afghan diasporas (e.g. Iran and Pakistan) has affected \nhouseholds that rely on remittances. It is projected that the remittances will fall by more than 50% in 2020 compared \nto nearly $868 million received in 2019. Over 50% of household income in the poorest quintile, corresponding to 15 \nmillion Afghans depend on remittances or income from informal sector activities. There are regions like Ghazni and \nKhost where over 20% of households heavily depend on remittances. \n \nPoverty. According to World Bank, the national poverty rate is projected to reach at least 61.0% (and potentially to \n72.0%) from a baseline of 54.5% in 2017, forcing an additional 1.9 million\u20136.0 million people into poverty by the end \nof 2020. Lockdown measures, supply disruptions and reduced crop sales have impacted the agriculture sector, \naccounting for 44% of the workforce and 60% of household income. The impact of the pandemic on urban households, \nespecially for daily wage earners in the informal sector, is more regressive. Day labor from activities like shop keeping, \nstreet or market sales, construction, or personal services accounts for more than 40% of non-agricultural employment \nfor the bottom quintile, corresponding to 2 million households (15 million Afghans). Up to 80% of employment is in the \ninformal sector with no social and legal protection for the workers. Spikes in import prices due to shortages or \ndisruptions in food supply have adversely affected households in the bottom 60%, for whom food purchase comprises \nhalf of their total consumption. About 12.4 million Afghans face the risk of being pushed into food security deprivation. \n \nImpact on women and the vulnerable population. Afghanistan ranked 143rd out of 162 economies on the Gender \nInequality Index in 2018 (compared to 154th out of 159 countries in 2016). The pandemic exacerbated the gender-\nbased inequalities because of (i) increased restrictions on women\u2019s participation in social and economic life due to \nnationwide lockdown in addition to restrictions from the traditional and patriarchal norms; (ii) limited access to gender-\nsensitive health care services, with only 15% of nurses and 2% of medical doctors being female, and social norms \nprohibiting female patients from being treated by male doctors; (iii) inadequate dissemination of COVID-19 information \n ", "          Appendix 4  29 \nAccess Criteria  Asian Development Bank Assessment \n  due to lower female literacy (18%) compared to male literacy (62%); (iv) increasing economic dependence and risk of \nfood insecurity as women have limited labor force participation (29% for working age women in 2016) and old-age \npension coverage as well as higher job losses compared to men with over 50% of the employed women in MSMEs \nnot able to come to work during the pandemic; (v) vulnerability to gender-based violence; and (vi) poor access to \nsanitation. About 70% of the employed women (both formal and informal) are in the agricultural sector while 24% are \nin manufacturing. The share of women in wage employment in non-agricultural sector is only 10% as of 2018. Pension \nspending is 0.6% of GDP covering only 9.2% of population over 64 years of age and 8% of the labor force. Ongoing \nconflict causing casualties, lockdown measures, and the pressures on the health care system have aggravated the \nhardship faced by the families of the military and civilian people killed during conflicts, and disabled civilians and \nveterans with special needs. The pandemic has affected 9 million school-age children, of which 39% are girls. Around \n20% of women and 41% of children under 5 years of age are malnourished as of 2019 and this will likely increase, \nunderscoring the importance of food distribution for humanitarian assistance. \n \n2. Countercyclical  On 16 March 2020, the Government of Afghanistan established the High-level Committee for COVID-19 as an inter-\nDevelopment  ministerial task force, chaired by the president and the first vice president and rolled out its comprehensive pro-poor \nExpenditures  countercyclical pandemic response package with gender focus. The High-level Committee has comprised MOF, \nMOPH, Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, IDLG, National Statistics and Information Authority, Ministry \nof Commerce and Industry, and Kabul Municipality. The MOF was tasked with the coordination of the development \npartner support while MOPH with the implementation of the health sector support.  \n \nUnder the instructions of the committee, MOF made two amendments to the 2020 national budget \u2014on 7 April 2020, \napproved by Presidential Decree No. 82, and on 29 July 2020, approved by Presidential Decree No. 47\u2014and a \nrevision during the midyear review on 28 September 2020, approved by the cabinet, to reprioritize resources for \nresponding to the economic downturn, and undertaking the countercyclical pandemic response package. The \npandemic response package amounts to $633.92 million (3.3% of GDP), comprising health-related measures ($70.35 \nmillion), social protection measures ($169.71 million) and macroeconomic stabilization measures ($393.86 million).  \n \nHealth-related measures. Aligned with NERP, the MOPH has undertaken (i) strengthening of the capacity of medical \nfacilities, testing laboratories and surveillance sites, including at border crossings; (ii) emergency procurement of the \nnecessary medicines and medical equipment such as testing kits, ventilators, medical masks; (iii) recruitment, training \nand incentive payments of the medical staff, and (iv) gender-sensitive public awareness campaign (details on health \nsector related expenditures provided under Criteria 4).  \n \nSocial protection measures. The government has undertaken countercyclical measures to expand the social \nprotection to mitigate the risks of food insecurity and rising poverty. Coverage of the social safety nets has been \nexpanded to include women and vulnerable people such as children, old-age pensioners and their female heirs, IDPs \nand refugees, military and civilian disabled people and the families of the killed people during conflicts, who have been \ndisproportionally impacted by the adverse impacts of the pandemic. The MOF provided an emergency cash transfer \nof AF2.42 billion ($31.43 million) to all 34 provinces through IDLG given the essential role of the local governments in \n ", "30  Appendix 4 \nAccess Criteria  Asian Development Bank Assessment \nimplementation of containment measures and provision of vital services and social support to communities. The total \nIDLG budget was raised by $45.3 million since the beginning of 2020 to augment pandemic response capacity.  \n \nTo address food shortages and stabilize the food prices, the government opened the national food reserves for public \nuse in April. A bread distribution program, supervised by the first vice-president, was launched in all provinces in May \n2020 and implemented by the local governments and municipalities. The program benefited more than 310,000 \nfamilies below the poverty line. District and village-level monitoring committees have been formed to identify and \ndocument the people in need and supervise the bread distribution process through local bakeries. Packages with 4.5 \nkilograms of wheat were distributed to 1,000 families in Kabul during the business closures. In coordination with the \nCOVID-19 Emergency Committee and the Kabul mayor\u2019s office, the government covered the water and electricity bills \nof 350,000 poor families, who had a bill equal to or less than AF1,000 ($13) for 2 months during the lockdown in April\u2013\nMay 2020, providing relief to 1.5 million residents (50% of utility users) in Kabul. About 10% of the total households \nhave been targeted as households headed by women for these in-kind and financial relief measures. The government \nhas supported the coverage of 99,368 old-age pensioners, of which 5,468 are women and 30,943 female heirs. Out \nof the total 130,311 pensioners and their female heirs (inclusive of 9,379 new beneficiaries in 2020), 86,404 have \nbiometric registration under E-NID, which will improve targeting of these beneficiaries. The Ministry of Refugees and \nRepatriation provides one-time cash transfer benefitting 41,500 IDPs and refugees from Iran and Pakistan. At the \nbeginning of 2020, remuneration was provided to 338,056 people, comprising both military and civilian disabled people \nand the families (including female heirs) of people killed during conflicts. Out of the total, 272,006 were civilians. During \n2020, the remuneration coverage has been increased by 32,570 additional military and civilian disabled people, and \nfamilies of those killed during conflicts \n \nMacroeconomic  stabilization  measures.  The  government  has  rolled  out  countercyclical  macroeconomic \nstabilization measures to strengthen the monetary policy, provide fiscal relief, strengthen support for a critical SOE, \nthe MSMEs and affected sectors, and promote pro-poor and gender-inclusive job creation. Although the government \nhas not introduced any large tax waivers or deferrals, it has extended filing deadlines for the first and second quarters \nof the fiscal year by 45 days for individuals and business taxpayers to ease tax compliance. The government also \nprovided financial support to the power utility company, Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat to cover the losses from \nlower electricity demand and past due electricity bills of the government agencies which were pending for the last few \nyears. This is aligned with the reforms supported by the World Bank and ADB to improve the operational efficiency \nand financial sustainability of the power sector. To create nearly 1.9 million temporary jobs and 60,000 permanent \njobs, the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock has supported processing and packaging units and cold \nstorage at the rural community level under the government\u2019s Afghanistan Crop Management Project to prevent \nwastage of high value perishable fresh fruit and vegetables that could not be exported. Agriculture sector is critical for \nwomen\u2019s livelihoods as 70% of female employment mainly takes place in this sector.  \n \nOn 1 October 2020, the High Economic Council of Afghanistan approved a 2-year MSME support package for $294.8 \nmillion, with $200 million to be provided in 2021 and the remainder in 2022. It provides (i) $44.80 million for exemptions \nor deferments of tax penalties, municipality fees, property rent for government land and buildings, (ii) $120 million for \n ", "          Appendix 4  31 \nAccess Criteria  Asian Development Bank Assessment \n  first loss fund to cover banks\u2019 losses from MSME lending, (iii) $50 million subsidized loans, (iv) $50 million for support \nfor industrial parks, (v) $10 million for vocational training and (vi) $20 million support for access to international \nmarkets. The support will also help streamline existing MSME-related programs at Ministry of Industry and Commerce \nand Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs, including the program for Women Rural Development and Women Economic \nEmpowerment. Exemptions and deferments of tax penalties, municipal fees and rental expenses on government \nproperty have been partially introduced in 2020 and will continue to provide fiscal relief to MSMEs during the \nimplementation as well. The support includes a first-loss fund, managed by the MOF and DAB including support from \nthe ACGF, to cover banking sector losses from MSME lending as well as subsidized loans to MSMEs provided by \nstate-owned and private sector banks in Afghanistan.  \n \nIn 2020, there are 7 private commercial banks, one private Islamic bank, 3 state-owned banks, and 2 foreign bank \nbranches in Afghanistan. There is also a formal microfinance sector, consisting Microfinance Investment Support \nFacility for Afghanistan and 6 microfinance institutions.  \n \nSmall-scale MSMEs in the manufacturing sector will be supported in industrial parks in five major cities (Kabul, \nKandahar, Nangarhar, Mazar, and Herat). Local universities will support incubators for entrepreneurs. The vocational \ntraining will be provided in collaboration with the Technical and Vocational Education and Training Directorate, Ministry \nof Higher Education, Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs and nongovernmental organizations. Trade-related support \naims at strengthening access of the MSMEs to international markets and increasing integration of Afghanistan\u2019s \nchambers of commerce and entrepreneurs with regional partners. \n \nOn the monetary side, the DAB has reduced the provisioning requirements for loans that are covered by risk \nguarantees from the ACGF to sustain lending to the private sector. With this policy, bank credit to MSMEs with ACGF \nguarantees as a share of total bank lending is projected to be at least 17% by end 2021. To strengthen the banking \nsector, DAB has been regularly monitoring early signs of stress and stands ready to provide liquidity to the financial \nsector as needed. The frequency of Financial Stability Committee meetings has been increased. The DAB developed \na post-COVID-19 improvement plan for the banking sector from July 2020 until December 2021. The DAB has (i) \nenforced the prudential requirements but at the same time suspended the administrative penalties and fees with no \nretrospective applications for breaches or noncompliance as a form of regulatory forbearance until July 2020; (ii) \npostponed the implementation of international financial reporting standards (IFRS-9) to June 2021; and (iii) frozen \nloan classifications at the end of February 2020 as a pre-pandemic cutoff date. \n \n3. Pre-shock Record of  Despite the difficult security situation, elevated political uncertainties and external shocks triggered by natural hazards \nGenerally Sound  that hampered economic activity, Afghanistan has maintained a generally sound pre-shock record of macroeconomic \nMacroeconomic  management  leading  up to the crisis. Afghanistan\u2019s macroeconomic and financial  management policies were \nManagement  anchored under the IMF\u2019s 3.5-year ECF arrangement, approved in July 2016, and completed in December 2019. The \nECF was a critical driver of structural macroeconomic, fiscal and governance reforms, strengthening (i) tax system \nwith value added tax, (ii) monetary policy for price and exchange rate stability, (iii) fiscal governance, (iv) anti-\n ", "32  Appendix 4 \nAccess Criteria  Asian Development Bank Assessment \ncorruption, (v) state-owned banks, (vi) management of public investment, fiscal risks and spending efficiency, (vii) \nasset declaration, and (viii) social protection.  \n \nAfghanistan achieved GDP growth of 2.6% in 2017, 1.2% in 2018 and 3.9% in 2019 driven by the agriculture sector\u2019s \nrecovery. The DAB has lowered the inflation from 5.0% in 2017 to 0.6% in 2018 and 2.3% in 2019. It has also taken \nmeasures to improve the capital adequacy, governance, and liquidity of the banking sector, and strengthened the \nfinancial supervisory framework by establishing the Financial Stability Committee. To strengthen the financial inclusion \nand financial sector intermediation, the government has started implementation of the National Financial Inclusion \nStrategy, 2019\u20132024 since September 2019.  \n \nWith continued aid inflows (reaching nearly 40% of GDP), the government has maintained a broadly balanced fiscal \nstance with budget deficit (including grants and loans)\u2212GDP ratios of 0.7% in 2017 and 1.1% in 2019 while having a \nsurplus of 1.6% in 2018. Reflecting improvements in budget execution and prioritization, operating expenditures\u2212GDP \nratio has declined from 19.7% of GDP in 2017 to 18.5% in 2019, while the development expenditures\u2212GDP ratio has \nincreased from 8.0% in 2017 to 9.5% in 2019 and pro-poor spending\u2212GDP ratio has increased from 3.0% in 2017 to \n3.7%  in 2019. Reflecting prudent fiscal  and debt  management, international reserves (over  $8 billion during \n2017\u22122019) have accounted for 14.5 months of imports in 2019 and public debt\u2212GDP ratio has remained stable at \nabout 6% under a policy of highly concessional external borrowing. Domestic borrowing is negligible in Afghanistan \nwith only two promissory note issuances worth 1.2% of GDP in 2017 and 0.5% of GDP in 2018 but the issuances \nwere discontinued in 2019 and 2020.  \n \nLarge current account deficits have continued to be financed by donor grants. The current account surplus including \nofficial transfers has increased from 7.6% in 2017 to 12.2% in 2018 and 11.7% in 2019. To reduce aid dependence, \nthe government has adopted measures to promote exports and regional trade. Tax reforms have been initiated in \n2019 for expansion of tax base, adoption of value-added tax, planned by early 2022 and increased tax collection \nefficiency by consolidating large taxpayers (accounting for 16% of domestic revenues including customs) under Single \nLarge Taxpayer Office. These reforms have improved the revenue\u2212GDP ratio from 13.1% in 2017 to 14.1% in 2019.  \n \nThe macroeconomic management during the pandemic has been on track and further supported by the IMF\u2019s ECF, \napproved in November 2020. The government remains committed to implementation of macroeconomic structural \nreforms and PFM reforms to improve the effectiveness of the countercyclical pandemic response measures. \n \n4. Structural Reforms  The government has promptly responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by introducing strict nationwide containment \n(Health Sector  measures to prevent the community transmission and strengthening the capacity and readiness of the health system \nResponse)   for the pandemic and future health emergencies over the medium and long term. The government\u2019s health sector \nstructural reforms have been pro-poor with strong gender focus. \n \nSocial distancing and containment measures. To prevent community spread after the first case was diagnosed on \n23 February 2020, a nation-wide lockdown was introduced in late March 2020, followed by imposition of preventive \n ", "          Appendix 4  33 \nAccess Criteria  Asian Development Bank Assessment \nsocial distancing and containment measures. On 6 June 2020, the nationwide lockdown was extended for three more \nmonths until early August, with new health guidelines, (i) requiring face masks in public places at all times and older \npeople staying home; (ii) introducing restrictions on public transport and screening at ports of entry; (iii) closing all \neducational centers and public places for gathering; (iv) disinfecting workplaces; and (v) reducing business hours for \ngovernment and nongovernmental organizations. MOPH in coordination with Kabul Municipality has disinfected \nresidential buildings, roads, and government offices (including ministries, jails, and hospitals) and provided guidelines \non disinfection. On 26 March 2020, over 12,000 prisoners were released and directed to stay in home quarantine for \n14 days with a presidential decree as part of the COVID-19 prevention measures. Since mid-July, border crossings \nand domestic and international flights have resumed. Public schools (11th and 12th Grades) and both public and \nprivate universities have reopened on 22 August 2020. The 1st \u2013 10th grades of the public schools have been \nreopened since 3 October 2020. However, the private schools (1st \u2013 12th Grade) have been conditionally opened \nsince 22 August 2020 if they provide the minimum health measures such as masks, social distancing, etc.  \n \nInstitutional framework of health sector measures. The MOPH approved the NERP for COVID-19 in March 2020 \nand developed an action plan for the preventive measures. A new structure within MOPH was created to implement \nthe NERP and the action plan. The NERP details the medium and long-term strategy for a robust national health \nsecurity agenda for all hazards and pandemic preparedness, as well as the resource requirements and development \ncoordination for (i) surveillance and detection; (ii) early diagnosis, isolation, and case management; (iii) infection \nprevention and control in health facilities and communities; (iv) risk mitigation; and (v) resource allocation for logistics \nand procurement for emergency responses based on the COVID-19 preparedness and response plans of the WHO \nand the UNICEF. Based on NERP, the estimated health sector resource requirement for the pandemic response \n(using three scenarios of low to high transmission) ranges between $123 million to $892 million.  \n \nIn April 2020, provincial emergency committees for COVID-19 were formed in all 34 provinces, comprising governors, \nprovincial councils, provincial health administrations, municipalities, and civil society in collaboration with WHO and \nrelevant UN agencies for surveillance, health care services, and risk communication. The local governments play a \ncritical role in implementation of national containment measures as well as provision of vital services and social \nprotection support. \n \nImplementation of health sector measures. Based on the national action plan, the MOPH has been strengthening \nthe capacity of medical facilities with strong gender focus such as establishment of women-only treatment areas at \nidentified medical facilities and provision of appropriately sized personal protective gears, including individual \npackages for female health workers. Nearly 570,000 units of personal protective equipment were provided to health \nworkers nationwide as of 12 November 2020 with support from development partners such as WHO, World Bank, \nUNICEF and bilateral donors. Furthermore, 8 hospitals have been designated for exclusive use by the COVID-19 \npatients; around 3,100 beds in 34 provinces have been assigned to COVID-19 patients, from which 1,030 are for \ncritical patients. Medical equipment has been provided for 1,642 isolation beds across all 34 provinces. A new 100-\nbed COVID-19 hospital has been opened in Herat province. In Kabul, the Darulaman Palace (300 beds) as well as \nKabul and Polytechnic universities\u2019 dormitories have been converted to isolation facilities. MOPH has been preparing \n ", "34  Appendix 4 \nAccess Criteria  Asian Development Bank Assessment \n10 additional 50-bed medical facilities in Herat, Farrah, Neemruz and Kabul. Development partners, including ADB \nhave been providing support to MOPH to rehabilitate and expand new treatment facilities including prefabricated ones. \n \nA total of 14 COVID-19 testing labs across the country with 5 labs in Kabul were established, equipped with 500 \nventilators purchased through the National Procurement Authority, polymerase chain reaction machines and testing \nkits. As of 12 November 2020, 4,350 healthcare workers received training on infection prevention and control, 3,931 \nhealthcare workers on surveillance and risk communication, 444 healthcare workers on intensive care and 193 \nhealthcare workers on medical laboratory testing. With the private hospitals also allowed to conduct tests, Afghanistan \nhas reached the capacity to carry out 5,500 tests per day and as of 19 November 2020, 133,691 tests were conducted.  \n \nTo strengthen surveillance and early detection, in addition to 525 MOPH sites, COVID-19 surveillance sites in airports, \nborders, and city entrance points have been established and mobile teams have been trained. As of 12 November \n2020, 519,023 people have been medically screened at points-of-entry and the surveillance systems have traced \n591,232 people since the start of the crisis in March 2020. Nearly 4,000 governmental and nongovernmental units \noperate  across  the  country  to  gather  information  daily  and  share  with  the  national  and  international  health \norganizations. MOPH has recruited and trained more than 6,000 medical staff with additional 3,000 medical staff \nplanned to be hired. Medical staff has been provided salaries with incentive payments. \n \nA nationwide gender-sensitive public awareness campaign on COVID-19 has been carried out by the MOPH and \nMinistry of Women Affairs. Using mosques, educational institutions as well as national print and broadcasting media, \nsocial media, billboards, cell phone messages, around 10 million pieces of COVID-19 related informational documents \nhave been distributed. Nearly 3 million people have been sensitized about hygiene promotion through handwashing \nstations and distribution of hygiene kits. Ministry of Women Affairs has been involved in 117 districts in 26 provinces \nby (i) visiting women jails, safe homes, shelters, businesses headed by women, orphanages, private banks, hospitals \nand clinics to distribute gender-sensitive information and sanitary kits, (ii) monitoring adherence to safety measures, \nand (iii) facilitating gender-sensitive services for women, particularly in hospitals with all women-only treatment \nfacilities. Health kits for street children have been distributed. A call center was set up at MOPH.  \n \nDevelopment partner support. The government has also received support from the WHO, United Nations agencies, \nand development partners for procurement of medical equipment and supplies, expansion of health sector capacity \nwith new facilities, capacity building on pandemic management and provision of health services for the vulnerable \ncommunities such as IDPs, refugees, women and children during the pandemic. Besides the health sector measures, \nthe  government\u2019s response includes  expansion of  social protection for  the  poor  and vulnerable people, and \nmacroeconomic stabilization measures with further details provided under criteria 2.  \n \n5. Debt Sustainability  Afghanistan has become eligible for DSSI, endorsed in April 2020 by the World Bank\u2019s Development Committee and \nthe G20 finance ministers in response to a call by the World Bank and the IMF to grant debt service suspension to the \npoorest countries. In return, beneficiaries of DSSI commit to use freed-up resources to increase social, health, or \neconomic spending in response to the pandemic while disclosing all public sector financial commitments (involving \n ", "          Appendix 4  35 \nAccess Criteria  Asian Development Bank Assessment \ndebt and debt-like instruments) and limiting their non-concessional borrowing as supported by ceilings under the IMF \nprograms and the World Bank\u2019s non-concessional borrowing policies. Around $4 million of interest and principal \npayments to bilateral creditors during May\u2212December 2020 will be paid starting 2022. Afghanistan\u2019s potential DSSI \nsavings are $39.1 million (0.2% of 2019 GDP) based on estimated debt service payments. Furthermore, the IMF has \nprovided debt service relief of SDR4.8 million ($6.8 million) under two tranches in April 2020 and October 2020 with \na total relief of SDR10.05 million ($14.4 million) by 2022 under the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust. \n \nDuring the pandemic, the IMF provided a concessional loan of SDR161.9 million ($220 million) under the Rapid Credit \nFacility, approved on 29 April 2020. An additional concessional IMF loan of SDR259.04 million ($370 million) under \nthe ECF arrangement was approved on 6 November 2020. These budget support loans represent 49% of outstanding \npublic debt stock of $1.2 billion. In 2020, Afghanistan also received infrastructure project loans of $208 million from \nsome development partners adding another 17% to the public debt stock. Based on ADB\u2019s DSA, which simulated \nscenarios on drivers of debt dynamics such as growth, exchange rate, real interest rate, and primary deficit, these \nloans will increase the public debt\u2212GDP ratio from 6.3% in 2019 to 10.7% in 2020 and 16.6% of GDP in 2021, however \nthe ratio is projected to decline to 13.4% in 2024. These loans will not significantly increase the annual debt service \nobligations and debt sustainability as the public debt will stay moderately low. ADB\u2019s $100 million grant under the \nCARES Program will help create fiscal space and improve debt sustainability during the pandemic.  \n \nAfghanistan\u2019s public debt sustainability hinges on continuing net inflows of highly concessional development finance \nover the medium and long term. Liabilities consist mostly of concessional and project-based loans from multilateral \nand bilateral creditors. This keeps borrowing costs low and limits rollover and interest-rate risks, although the foreign-\ncurrency denomination of public external debt constitutes currency risk.  \n \nNevertheless, the IMF\u2019s pre-shock DSA under Article IV consultation report in 2019 and its DSA after the pandemic \nin Rapid Credit Facility report in April 2020 and in ECF report in November 2020 as well as ADB\u2019s recent DSA rate \nAfghanistan at high risk of debt distress mainly because of an expected decline of grants financing fiscal and external \ndeficits in the medium and long term. Key factors for the high risk of debt distress are (i) high dependence on donor \ngrant inflows, which finance substantial fiscal and external deficits, (ii) the expected replacement of grants by debt \nfinancing over time, which will increase the debt service burden given the weak debt carrying and low revenue \ngeneration capacities, (iii) export shocks, and (iv) the fragile political and security situation.  \n \nTo facilitate transitioning of the low-income countries (including Afghanistan) to non-concessional borrowing, the IMF \nand World Bank have approved the SDFP in effect from 1 July 2020 to strengthen public debt management framework. \nThis is aligned with the IMF and the World Bank support for the implementation of the DSSI\u2014by monitoring spending, \nenhancing public debt transparency, and ensuring prudent borrowing. ADB will continue to support debt sustainability \nduring the Asian Development Fund 13 period (2021\u22122024) through additional TA for its developing member countries \nfor the implementation the SDFP. \n \n ", "36  Appendix 4 \nAccess Criteria  Asian Development Bank Assessment \n6. Coordination with the  ADB, the IMF and the World Bank have maintained close coordination for the design of the CARES Program. They \nInternational Monetary  have consulted extensively on the impact of the pandemic, the macroeconomic projections, and the policy advice to \nFund  the government for appropriate countercyclical response measures. The IMF supports the ADB\u2019s CARES Program. \n \nThe government has recently completed the implementation of the 2016\u22122019 program under the IMF\u2019s ECF, \nproviding a loan of SDR32.4 million ($44.7 million) in December 2019.  To create the fiscal space in the context of \nfiscal deterioration caused by pandemic, maintain macroeconomic stability, and lay the ground for sustained post-\npandemic recovery, IMF approved a concessional loan of SDR161.9 million ($220 million) under the Rapid Credit \nFacility on 29 April 2020. An additional concessional IMF loan of SDR259.04 million ($370 million) under the ECF \narrangement was approved on 6 November 2020.  \n \nThe IMF Assessment is provided in the ECF report, approved on 6 November 2020, accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2. The report is provided in lieu of the IMF Assessment Letter as per guidance received from \nthe IMF that since the report was approved within 6 months, a separate IMF Assessment Letter will not be provided. \nIts content includes the\u202fcountry's macroeconomic policy framework before the COVID-19 crisis, during the pandemic \nand the country's updated debt sustainability situation.
