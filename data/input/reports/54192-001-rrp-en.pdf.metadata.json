The \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has adversely impacted Afghanistan\u2019s economy and \nits  population.  To  mitigate  these  impacts,  the  government  has  adopted  emergency  pro-poor \ncountercyclical  measures  and  expenditures  to  strengthen  the  health  system,  expand  social \nprotection, and support macroeconomic stabilization and job creation. The proposed program will \nsupport the government\u2019s COVID-19 countercyclical pandemic response and financing needs to \nhelp mitigate the adverse health, social, and economic impacts of the crisis, while targeting poor \nand vulnerable groups and ensuring gender mainstreaming.2  \n\n \nAfghanistan meets all the criteria required to access the CPRO under the Countercyclical \n3. \nSupport  Facility  (Table  1  and  Appendix  4).  The  program  is  fully  aligned  with  the  operational \npriorities in Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2019s Strategy 2030 (with a differentiated approach for \nFCAS)  related  to  (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  (ii)  accelerating \nprogress in gender equality, (iii) promoting rural development and food security, (iv) strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity, and (v) fostering regional cooperation and integration.3  \n \n\nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria for COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option  \n\nAccess Criteria \n1.

Pre-shock \n\nrecord of \ngenerally \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nAs of 23 November 2020, 44,706 COVID-19 cases were reported with 1,687 deaths. The \neconomy  has  deteriorated  during  the  pandemic  with  business  lockdowns,  disruptions  in \nsupply chains, a downturn in trade and remittances, and a drop in consumer  income and \ndemand. The IMF\u2019s 2020 projections indicate (i) a GDP contraction of 5.0% in contrast to a \nGDP  growth  of  3.9%  in  2019,  (ii)  a  widening  of  the  current  account  deficit\u2013GDP  ratio \n(excluding official transfers) to 30.6% from 27.0% in 2019, and (iii) a widening of the budget \ndeficit\u2013GDP ratio (excluding grants and loans)  to 21.2% from 13.9% in 2019. The budget \ndeficit\u2013GDP ratio (including grants and loans) is projected to increase to 3.0% in 2020 from \n1.1%  in  2019.  Official  reserves  remain  stable  at  $8.9  billion  with  14.3  months  of  import \ncoverage in 2020. The afghani\u2013dollar exchange rate has appreciated by 1%, driven by lower \nimports and high currency demand by Afghan nationals in provinces. The national poverty \nrate is projected to reach at least 61.0% (and potentially 72.0%) in 2020 from 54.5% in 2017, \nwith an additional 1.9 million\u20136.0 million people falling into poverty. The unemployment rate \nis projected to rise to 37.9% in 2020 from 23.9% in 2019. \nOn 16 March 2020, the government established the High-level Committee for COVID-19 as \nan inter-ministerial taskforce, chaired by the president and the first vice-president, and rolled \nout  its  pro-poor  countercyclical  pandemic  response  package  with  gender  focus  covering \nhealth-related  measures  aligned  with  the  NERP,  social  protection  measures  and \nmacroeconomic  stabilization  measures  (paras.  17\u221220).  Under  the  instructions  of  this \ncommittee, the MOF made two amendments to the 2020 national budget approved by the \npresident\u2014in  April  2020  and  July  2020\u2014and  a  revision  during  the  midyear  review  in \nSeptember  2020,  approved  by  the  cabinet,  to  reprioritize  resources  for  the  pandemic \nresponse package of $633.92 million (3.3% of GDP). \nAfghanistan  has  maintained  a  generally  sound  pre-shock  record  of  macroeconomic \nmanagement, anchored to the structural reforms under the IMF\u2019s ECF during 2016\u22122019. \nPre-shock GDP growth was 2.6% in 2017, 1.2% in 2018, and 3.9% in 2019. Inflation has \nfallen from 5.0% in 2017 to 0.6% in 2018 and 2.3% in 2019. A broadly balanced fiscal stance \n\n1 Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2020.

Coordination \nwith the IMF \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nhas been maintained with pre-shock budget deficit (including grants and loans)\u2013 GDP ratios \nof  0.7% in  2017 and  1.1%  in 2019,  while having  a  surplus of  1.6% in  2018. International \nreserves (more than $8 billion during 2017\u22122019) accounted for 14.5 months of imports in \n2019. The public debt\u2013GDP ratio has been stable at around 6% with concessional external \nborrowing. The current account surplus including official transfers has increased from 7.6% \nin  2017  to  12.2%  in  2018  and  11.7%  in  2019.  Macroeconomic  management  during  the \npandemic has been on track. \nThe MOPH approved the NERP and an action plan in March 2020. A national lockdown and \ntravel  restrictions  were  introduced  in  March  2020,  followed  by  social  distancing  and \ncontainment measures until August 2020. Provincial emergency committees were formed in \nApril 2020 in 34 provinces. The MOPH has undertaken the following public health  measures: \n(i)  strengthening  medical  facilities,  testing  laboratories,  and  surveillance;  (ii)  procuring \nmedical  equipment;  (iii)  recruiting,  training,  and  providing  incentive  payments  for  medical \nstaff; and (iv) running a public awareness campaign. The medium- and long-term measures \ninclude  the  strategy  for  national  health  security  agenda  for  all  hazards  and  pandemic \npreparedness, and capacity building of the MOPH by development partners. \nThe  IMF  provided  concessional  budget  support  loans  totaling  $590  million  in  2020.  The \ngovernment  received  infrastructure  project  loans  of  $208  million  from  some  development \npartners. Based on ADB\u2019s recent DSA,a these loans will increase the public debt\u2013GDP ratio \nfrom 6.3% of GDP in 2019 to 10.7% in 2020 and 16.6% in 2021, but the ratio is projected to \ndecline to 13.4% in 2024. These loans will not increase the annual debt service obligations, \nand  debt  sustainability  will  not  be  significantly  affected.  The  public  debt  consisting  of \nconcessional loans will stay moderately low. ADB\u2019s $100 million grant will help create fiscal \nspace and improve debt sustainability. The IMF\u2019s DSA (pre-shock and after the pandemic) \nand ADB\u2019s recent DSA rate Afghanistan at high risk of debt distress in the medium and long \nterm,  mainly  because  of  an  expected  decline  in  grants,  which  finance  fiscal  and  external \ndeficits. Afghanistan is eligible for the DSSI and will benefit from potential DSSI savings. \nThe government has worked closely with the IMF, supporting its countercyclical measures. \nIMF approved two budget support loans: SDR161.9 million ($220 million) under RCF in April \n2020  and  SDR259.04  million  ($370  million)  under  ECF  in  November  2020.  Afghanistan \nreceived  debt  service  relief  of  SDR4.8  million  ($6.8  million)  in  2020  under  CCRT.  IMF \nprovided  its  assessment  report  under  the  ECF,  confirming  sound  macroeconomic \nmanagement.

Since the first COVID-19 case was reported on 23 February \n2020, based on World Health Organization (WHO) data the number of confirmed cases reached \n44,706 with 1,687 deaths as of 23 November 2020. The government\u2019s capacity constraints in the \nhealth  sector  and  limited  infrastructure  have  affected  the  developmental  and  health-related \nservices.4 An ongoing armed conflict and political uncertainties, including about the intra-Afghan \npeace negotiations during 2020, have further complicated the fragile health situation.5  \n\n \n\n4  Afghanistan ranks 170th out of 180 economies in the human development index (overall 0.496, 0.360 for women and \n0.583 for men) in 2019. Only 32% of the population have access to grid-connected electricity and 43% use improved \nsanitation facilities. United Nations Development Programme. 2019. Afghanistan Human Development Indicators.  \n5  A peace deal was signed between the United States and the Taliban in February 2020. The political impasse over \nthe presidential elections concluded with two leading candidates making an agreement in May 2020. Prospects for \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAfghanistan is a landlocked country with a population of 38.9 million. It borders Iran, the \n5. \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, Pakistan, as well as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan in the \nCentral  Asia  region,  which  are  vital  for  regional  trade  and  employment.  The  influx  of  671,759 \nreturning  Afghan migrants and refugees from  Iran  and  Pakistan  during  January\u2212October  2020 \nhas accelerated the spread of the virus because of the limited border surveillance, testing, and \nquarantine  capacity.6 According  to  the  United  Nations  Office  for  Coordination  of  Humanitarian \nAffairs, about 400,000 people were internally displaced as a result of the conflict or disasters from \nnatural  hazards  in  2019,  with  an  additional  86,419  people  displaced  by  the  end  of  May  2020. \nThese factors have complicated the provision of health and social services during the pandemic.  \n \n6. \nA health emergency of such magnitude has aggravated the pressures on the country\u2019s \npublic-sector-led  health  care  system,  providing  mainly  basic  health  care  (with  limited  private \nhealth care providers), due to large deficiencies in hospital beds, medical personnel, equipment, \nand testing capacity.7 Hospitals also faced challenges to provide health services in areas of active \nconflict. The health care expenditures are primarily borne by high out-of-pocket expenditures of \nthe  households  (73%)  because  of  lack  of  health  insurance,  while  the  rest  is  covered  by  the \ngovernment  (6%)  and  international  donors  (21%). 8  With  inadequate  personal  protective \nequipment,  as  of  October  2020,  10%  of  the  COVID-19  infections  were  among  health  care \nprofessionals, and their subsequent deaths are undermining the response capacity.9 Afghanistan \nranks 161st out of 195 economies in its capacity to rapidly respond to and mitigate the spread of \nthe epidemic, with a score of 23.6 out of 100 based on the Global Health Security Index in 2019.10 \nBecause there is no national death register, COVID-19 cases and deaths are underreported.11 \nUnder the scenario of easing community restrictions, daily infections (including those not tested) \ncould reach 36,840 by 1 March 2021 with 2,808 deaths, requiring 10,797 hospital beds (2,002 \nintensive care unit beds) compared to 5,286 beds (440 intensive care unit beds) available.12 \n \n7. \nPre-shock record of generally sound macroeconomic management. Despite political \nuncertainties and economic shocks triggered by natural hazards, Afghanistan has maintained a \nsound  record  of  macroeconomic  management  leading  up  to  the  crisis. 13  The  structural \nmacroeconomic, fiscal, and governance reforms have been anchored under the Extended Credit \nFacility  (ECF)  of  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF), 14  implemented  from  July  2016  to \n\n \n\na peace agreement with the Taliban remain uncertain. Despite calls for a ceasefire, attacks have led to 3,403 civilian \ndeaths and 6,989 injuries in 2019, and 2,117 deaths and 3,822 injuries during January\u2212September 2020.  \n\n6  United Nations International Organization for Migration.

Staff Report for the 2019 Article IV Consultation and the Sixth Review Under the Extended Credit Facility \nArrangement\u2212Press  release;  Staff  Report  and  Statement  by  the  Executive  Director  for  Islamic  Republic  of \nAfghanistan. IMF Country Report No. 19/382. Washington, DC. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nDecember 2019. The macroeconomic management during the pandemic has been supported by \nthe IMF\u2019s ECF, approved on 6 November 2020. Afghanistan achieved gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth of 2.6% in 2017, 1.2% in 2018, and 3.9% in 2019. The Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) \nhas been committed to price stability supported by exchange rate flexibility. Inflation has  fallen \nfrom  5.0%  in  2017  to  0.6%  in  2018  and  2.3%  in  2019.  DAB  has  strengthened  the  financial \nsupervision by establishing the Financial Stability Committee. With continued aid inflows (about \n40%  of  GDP),  the  government  has  maintained  a  balanced  fiscal  stance  with  budget  deficit \n(including grants and loans)\u2013GDP ratios of 0.7% in 2017 and 1.1% in 2019, while having a fiscal \nsurplus  of  1.6%  in  2018.  International  reserves  (more  than  $8  billion  during  2017\u22122019)  have \nremained comfortable at 14.5 months of imports in 2019. The public debt\u2013GDP ratio has remained \nstable at about 6% under highly concessional borrowing. The current account surplus including \nofficial transfers has increased from 7.6% in 2017 to 12.2% in 2018 and 11.7% in 2019.  \n \n8. \nEconomic  impact  of  the  pandemic.  The  government  tightened  the  containment \nmeasures by placing Kabul and other urban centers under lockdown from late March until early \nAugust 2020. While the pre-shock macroeconomic management has been sound, the pandemic \nhas had a substantial negative economic impact because of the business closures, disruptions in \nsupply chains, downturn in trade and remittances, and drop in consumer demand. Based on IMF \nestimates, the economy is projected to contract by 5.0% in 2020 with a downturn in industry and \nservices, in contrast to the pre-COVID-19 GDP growth projection of 3.5% for 2020. In 2021, the \nGDP growth is projected to rebound to 4.0%.15 Under a more pessimistic scenario based on World \nBank estimates,16 incorporating the risks related to the second wave of infection, weather-related \nshocks,  security  challenges,  political  uncertainty,  and  potential  decline  in  international  grants, \nGDP  contraction could  range  between  5.5%  and  7.4%  in  2020  with  only  1.0%  GDP  growth  in \n2021. ADB estimates GDP contraction of 5% in 2020 and 1.5% GDP growth in 2021.17  \n\n \n9. \nFiscal pressure. Based on IMF estimates, domestic revenues are projected to decline to \n$2.31 billion (12.1% of GDP) in 2020 compared to $2.66 billion (14.1% of GDP) in 2019 and the \npre-COVID-19  2020  projection  of  $2.71  billion  (13.0%  of  GDP).  Expenditures  are  projected  to \nincrease  to  $6.35  billion  (33.3%  of  GDP)  in  2020  driven  by  COVID-19  and  pro-poor-related \nspending,  compared  to  $5.28  billion  (28.0%  of  GDP)  in  2019  and  the  pre-COVID-19  2020 \nprojection of $5.56 billion (26.6% of GDP). The budget deficit excluding grants and budget support \nloans is projected to increase to $4.04 billion (21.2% of GDP) in 2020, compared to $2.62 billion \n(13.9% of GDP) in 2019 and the pre-COVID-19 2020 projection of $2.85 billion (13.6% of GDP).18 \n \n10. \nInternational  trade,  reserves,  and  exchange  rate.  Between  March  and  May  2020, \nalmost all border points with neighboring countries were closed with limited incoming shipments. \nBy the end of June 2020, most border points  were reopened.19 Because of disruptions to land \nand  air  transport  and  lower  demand  in  export  markets,  merchandise  exports  are  projected  to \ncontract  by  35.4%  and  imports  by  2.4%  in  2020.  The  current  account  deficit\u2013GDP  ratio  is \nprojected to increase from 27.0% in 2019 to 30.6% in 2020. The current account including official \ntransfers as a share of GDP is projected to have a smaller surplus of 9.3% in 2020 compared to \n11.7% in 2019. The official reserves will increase to $8.9 billion in 2020 (compared to $8.6 billion \nin 2019), equivalent to 14.3 months of import coverage.

Afghanistan Development Update Surviving the Storm. July. Washington, DC. \n17 ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook Update September. Manila. \n18 Fiscal analysis is in the Debt Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 More than 90% of Afghanistan\u2019s exports are in agricultural commodities. In 2019, the main export destinations are \nIndia  (62%),  Pakistan  (21%),  and  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (5%).  Afghan  imports  come  from  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (19%), Iran (18%), and Pakistan (14%). \n\n \n\n\fslightly appreciated, driven by lower imports and increased demand for afghanis in provinces near \nPakistan, where its use was promoted instead of Pakistan rupees for domestic transactions.  \n \n11. \nInflation.  Given  Afghanistan\u2019s  dependence  on  imported  food  and  nonfood  products, \nconsumer  price  inflation  surged  during  the  pandemic.  The  IMF  figures  indicate  that  inflation \nincreased from 2.3% in 2019 to 5.4% in 2020 and is forecast to remain high at 4.8% in 2021. The \nfood  price  inflation  spiked  in  the  first  half  of  2020  following  imposition  of  border  control  and \nlockdown measures in urban centers. The food price inflation is forecast to reach 17.5% by the \nend of 2020 (with its period-average rate projected at 13.3% for the full year).20 Price volatility has \nmoderated  since  April  2020,  following  distribution  of  wheat  from  strategic  grain  reserves, \nenforcement of anti-price-gouging regulations, and the border reopening for food imports.  \n\n \nBanking  sector.  Financial  soundness  and  profitability  of  the  banking  sector  have \n12. \ndeteriorated during the pandemic.21 Driven by withdrawal of savings and working capital by firms \nto meet business costs in the face of revenue declines, total banking sector deposits declined by \n3% in the first quarter of 2020. Annual growth in net credit to the private sector is projected to \ndrop from 1.8% in 2019 to 1.0% in 2020 because of the economic downturn and increasing risk \naversion by banks in response to declining debt servicing and repayment capacity of businesses. \nAs of June 2020, while the ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets stood at 26.7% (higher than the \nthresholds of 8.0% under Basel II and 10.5% under Basel III), the ratio of nonperforming loans to \ngross loans increased to 29.4% compared from 14.5% at the end of 2019.  \n \n13.  Micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  and  unemployment.  Nearly  250,000 \nregistered  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs)  have  been  hit  hard  by  the \npandemic.22 An  impact  assessment  during  May\u2013June  2020  showed  that  lockdowns  and  fall  in \nconsumer demand have placed pressures on MSMEs because of supply chain disruptions, input \nshortages,  loss  of  labor,  forced  sale  of  assets,  limited  working  capital,  cash  flow  shortages, \nrevenue losses, and lack of access to credit.23 Because of urban lockdowns, travel to retail stores \nand  workplaces  dropped  by  50%.  Financial  inclusion  is  very  weak,  with  only  15%  of  the  adult \npopulation having a bank account and only 5% of MSMEs having access to a line of bank credit, \nwith most of the financing handled through hawalas (a money transfer arrangement in the informal \nsector) (footnote 9). MSMEs accounted for nearly 1.6 million jobs in services and industry, and \nMSMEs with less than 10 employees accounted for more than 80% of nonagricultural employment \nbefore  the  pandemic.  The  unemployment  rate  (including  the  informal  sector)  is  projected  to \nincrease from 23.9% in 2019 to 37.9% by the end of 2020. 24 If underemployment is added, the \nfigure will reach 53.5% of the labor force, corresponding to nearly 4.8 million people being either \nunemployed or underemployed in 2020 (an increase of 1.5 million people from previous year). \n \n14. \nRemittances. Economic downturn in countries with large Afghan diasporas (e.g., Iran and \nPakistan) has affected households that rely on remittances. It is projected that remittances will fall \nby more than 50% in 2020 from the nearly $868 million received in 2019 (footnote 16). \n\n \n\n20 Afghanistan relies on wheat imports from Kazakhstan (61%) and Pakistan (23%). With border closures, restrictions \non wheat exports by Kazakhstan in the first quarter of 2020 and panic buying in March 2020, wheat prices increased \nby 32% in Kabul by May 2020. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the wheat \nprices in September 2020 remained 25% higher than the pre-pandemic price level.  \n\n21 The banking sector made a loss in the first quarter of 2020, with a return on asset ratio of \u20130.13% compared to 0.83% \nin December 2019.

Kabul. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nPoverty. The World Bank estimates that because of COVID-19, the national poverty rate \n15. \ncould  increase  to  at  least  61.0%  (and  potentially  to  72.0%)  from  54.5%  in  2017, 25 forcing  an \nadditional 1.9 million\u20136.0 million people into poverty by the end of 2020 (footnote 16). Lockdown \nmeasures,  supply  disruptions,  and  reduced  crop  sales  have  impacted  the  agriculture  sector, \naccounting  for  44%  of  the  workforce  and  60%  of  household  incomes.  The  pandemic  has \ndeteriorated the livelihoods of urban households, especially for daily wage earners in the informal \nsector. Day labor from activities like shopkeeping, street or market sales, construction, or personal \nservices  accounts  for  more  than  40%  of  non-agricultural  employment  for  the  bottom  quintile, \ncorresponding to 2 million households (15 million Afghans). Up to 80% of employment is in the \ninformal sector, with no social and legal protection for workers. Spikes in prices of staple foods \ndue to shortages or disruptions in food supply have adversely affected households in the bottom \n60%,  for  whom  food  purchases  comprise  half  of  their  total  consumption.  About  12.4  million \nAfghans could be pushed into food insecurity, disproportionately affecting women and children.26  \n  \n16. \nImpact on women and the vulnerable population. The pandemic has exacerbated the \ngender-based  inequalities27 as  a  result  of  (i)  increased  restrictions  on  women\u2019s  participation  in \nsocial and economic life because of the nationwide lockdown in addition to restrictions from the \ntraditional and patriarchal norms; (ii) limited access to gender-sensitive health care services, with \nonly 15% of nurses and 2% of medical doctors being female, and social norms prohibiting female \npatients  from  being  treated  by  male  doctors;  (iii)  inadequate  dissemination  of  COVID-19 \ninformation  because  of  lower  female  literacy  (18%)  compared  to  male  literacy  (62%);  (iv) \nincreasing economic dependence and risk of food insecurity as women have limited labor force \nparticipation (29% for working-age women in 2016) 28 and old-age pension coverage29 as well as \nhigher job losses compared to men, with more than 50% of employed women in MSMEs not able \nto come to work during the pandemic; (v) vulnerability to gender-based violence; and (vi) poor \naccess  to  sanitation. 30  Ongoing  conflict  causing  casualties,  lockdown  measures,  and  the \npressures on the health system have aggravated the hardship faced by the families of the military \nand  civilians  killed  during  conflicts,  and  disabled  veterans  and  civilians  with  special  needs. \nInternally  displaced  families,  returning  migrants  and  refugees  face  difficulties  in  finding \nemployment  and  paying  for  basic  food  and  housing,  which  have  increased  their  debt.  The \npandemic  has  affected  9  million  school-age  children,  of  which  39%  are  girls.  Around  20%  of \nwomen and 41% of children under 5 years of age are malnourished as of 2019 and this will likely \nincrease, underscoring the importance of food distribution for humanitarian assistance. \n \nB. \n \nCountercyclical  COVID-19  pandemic  response  measures.  On  16  March  2020,  the \n17. \ngovernment established the High-level Committee for COVID-19 as an inter-ministerial task force, \nchaired by the president and the first vice-president, and rolled out its comprehensive pro-poor \ncountercyclical  pandemic  response  package  with  gender  focus.  Under  the  instruction  of  this \ncommittee, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) made two amendments to the 2020 national budget\u2014\n\nADB Support through COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \n\n \n\n25 The Afghanistan Living Conditions Survey reported that national  poverty rate  rose from 38% in 2012 to 54.5% in \n2017 due to worsening security and economic situation.

The government responded to the COVID-19 emergency by \nintroducing a nationwide lockdown in late March 2020 followed by  preventive social distancing \nand containment measures such as requirement for masks; closures of schools, businesses, and \npublic  places;  release  of  prisoners;  and  restrictions  on  public  transportation  until  early  August \n2020. Border crossings and flights resumed in mid-July 2020. Schools and universities reopened \nin phases since 22 August 2020. Provincial emergency committees were formed in April 2020, \ncomprising  local  administrators,  civil  society,  and  development  partners  in  34  provinces.  The \npreventive measures have been implemented under the authority of the provincial governments. \nThe National Emergency Response Plan (NERP) for COVID-19 was approved by the Ministry of \nPublic  Health  (MOPH)  in  March  2020  and  a  new  structure  within  the  MOPH  was  created  to \nimplement  the  NERP  and  the  national  action  plan.  The  MOPH  has  been  strengthening  the \nreadiness  and  capacity  of  the  medical  facilities,  including  emergency  procurement  of  medical \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nsupplies  and  equipment.  These  measures  also  have  a  gender focus  with  the  establishment  of \nwomen-only  treatment  facilities  in  hospitals  and  provision  of  appropriately  sized  personal \nprotective  gear  for  female  health  workers.31 Fourteen  COVID-19  testing  labs  were  established \nacross the country with five in Kabul. Including the tests by the private hospitals,  a capacity of \n5,500 tests per day has been reached. As of 19 November 2020, 133,691 tests were conducted, \nwhich is only 30% of the estimated need. In addition to the 525 MOPH sites, surveillance sites in \nairports, borders, and city entrances have been set up and mobile teams trained. The MOPH has \nrecruited  and  trained  more  than  6,000 medical  staff  with  3,000  new  staff  planned  to  be  hired. \nMedical staff have been provided with salaries and incentive payments. A gender-sensitive public \nawareness campaign  has  been  carried  out  by  the  MOPH  and  Ministry  of  Women  Affairs  in  all \nprovinces, distributing more than 10 million pieces of COVID-19-related information, and a call \ncenter was set up at the MOPH. Given low female literacy, the Ministry of Women Affairs visited \nwomen in hospitals, jails, shelters, businesses, orphanages, and banks across 26 provinces to \nraise awareness and share gender-sensitive information. The street children were also supported \nwith sanitary kits. The medium- and long-term public health and preventive measures include the \nstrategy for national health security agenda for all hazards and pandemic preparedness under \nthe NERP, and capacity building of the MOPH with support from development partners. \n \n19. \nSocial  protection  measures.  The  government  has  undertaken  several  measures  to \nmitigate the risks of food insecurity and rising poverty, and expand the coverage of social safety \nnets, targeting women and vulnerable people. The MOF provided an emergency cash transfer of \n$31.43 million to all provinces through the Independent Directorate of Local Governance given \nthe  essential  role  of  local  governments  in  implementing  containment  measures  and  providing \nservices  and  social  support.  In  April,  to  address  food  shortages  and  stabilize  prices,  the \ngovernment  opened  the  national  food  reserves  for  public  use.  A  bread  distribution  program, \nsupervised by the first vice-president, was launched in all provinces in May 2020 and implemented \nby the local governments and municipalities. The program benefited more than 310,000 families \nbelow the poverty line, with bread distributed through local bakeries. One-time unconditional in-\nkind support of 4.5 kilograms of wheat was distributed to 1,000 poor families in Kabul in April 2020. \nIn  coordination  with  the  COVID-19  Emergency  Committee  and  the  Kabul  mayor\u2019s  office,  the \ngovernment covered the water and electricity bills of 350,000 poor families, who had a bill equal \nto or less than AF1,000 ($13) for 2 months during the lockdown in April\u2013May 2020, providing relief \nto 1.5 million residents (50% of utility users) in Kabul. About 10% of the total households have \nbeen targeted as households headed by women for these in-kind and financial relief measures. \nThe  government  has  continued  coverage  of  99,368  old-age  pensioners,  of  whom  5,468  are \nwomen and 30,943 are female heirs. Out of 130,311 pensioners and female heirs (inclusive of \n9,379 new beneficiaries in 2020), 86,404 have biometric registration under the Electronic National \nIdentification Document (E-NID). A one-time cash transfer of AF6,000 per person was provided \nto 41,500 internally displaced persons and refugees. At the beginning of 2020, remuneration was \nprovided to 338,056 people, comprising both military and civilian disabled people and the families \n(including female heirs) of people killed during conflicts. Out of the total, 272,006 were civilians. \nDuring 2020, the remuneration coverage has been increased by 32,570 additional military and \ncivilian disabled people, and families of those killed during conflicts.  \n  \n20.  Macroeconomic stabilization measures. The government has rolled out measures  to \nsupport the affected sectors and promote pro-poor and gender-inclusive job creation. Although \nthe government did not introduce any large tax waivers or deferrals, it extended tax filing deadlines \nfor  the  first  and  second  quarters  of  the  fiscal  year  by  45  days  for  individuals  and  business \ntaxpayers  to  ease  tax  compliance.  The  government  supported  the  power  utility  company,  Da \n\n31 Details on the NERP and enhancement of medical facilities are in Appendix 4 under the structural reforms. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAfghanistan Breshna Sherkat, by covering its losses from lower electricity demand and past-due \nelectricity bills of the government agencies pending for the last few years. To create nearly 1.9 \nmillion  temporary  jobs  and  60,000  permanent  jobs,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Irrigation  and \nLivestock has supported processing and packaging units and cold storage at the rural community \nlevel under the government\u2019s Afghanistan Crop Management Project to prevent wastage of high-\nvalue perishable fresh fruit and vegetables that could not be exported. On 1 October 2020, the \nHigh  Economic  Council  of  Afghanistan  approved  a  2-year  MSME  support  package  for  $294.8 \nmillion,  with  $200.0  million  to  be  provided  in  2021  and  the  remainder  in  2022.  It  provides  (i) \nexemptions or deferments of tax penalties, municipality fees, and property rent for government \nland and buildings; (ii) first-loss fund to cover banks\u2019 losses from MSME lending; (iii) subsidized \nloans;  (iv)  support  for  industrial  parks;  (v)  vocational  training;  and  (vi)  support  for  access  to \ninternational  markets  (details  in  Appendix  4).  On  the  monetary  side,  DAB  has  reduced  the \nprovisioning requirements for loans covered by risk guarantees from the Afghan Credit Guarantee \nFoundation  (ACGF) to  sustain  private  sector  lending.32 With  this  policy,  bank  credit  to MSMEs \n(with ACGF guarantees) as a share of total bank lending is projected to be at least 17% by the \nend of 2021. The frequency of Financial Stability Committee meetings of DAB has been increased. \nThe DAB has developed a post-COVID-19 improvement plan for the banking sector until the end \nof 2021. DAB has (i) enforced the prudential requirements but also suspended the penalties and \nfees  with  no  retrospective  applications  for  breaches  or  noncompliance  until  July  2020,  (ii) \npostponed the implementation of the international financial reporting standards (IFRS-9) to June \n2021, and (iii) frozen loan classifications at the end of February 2020.33  \n \n21. \nDebt  sustainability  analysis.  Afghanistan  has  become  eligible  for  the  Debt  Service \nSuspension  Initiative  (DSSI),  endorsed  by  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Development  Committee  and  the \nG20 finance ministers in April 2020.34 The IMF has provided debt service relief of SDR4.80 million \n($6.8 million) under two tranches in April 2020 and October 2020, with a total relief of SDR10.05 \nmillion ($14.4 million) by 2022 under the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust.35 During the \npandemic, the IMF provided a concessional loan of SDR161.9 million ($220.0 million) under the \nRapid  Credit  Facility,  approved  on  29  April  2020  (footnote  13).  A  concessional  IMF  loan  of \nSDR259.04  million  ($370  million)  under  the  3.5-year  ECF  arrangement  was  approved  on  6 \nNovember 2020.36 In 2020, Afghanistan also received infrastructure project loans of $208 million \nfrom some development partners. Based on ADB\u2019s recent debt sustainability analysis (DSA),37 \nthese loans will increase the public debt\u2013GDP ratio from 6.3% of GDP in 2019 to 10.7% in 2020 \nand 16.6% in 2021 but the ratio is projected to decline to 13.4% in 2024. They will not significantly \nincrease the annual debt service obligations or affect debt sustainability. ADB\u2019s $100 million grant \nwill help create fiscal space and improve debt sustainability. Public debt will stay moderately low, \nwith liabilities mostly consisting of concessional loans. This keeps borrowing costs low and limits \nrollover and interest rate risks, although the foreign currency denomination of public external debt \n\n \n\n32  The  ACGF,  a  foundation  based  in  Germany,  supports  partner  banks  and  microfinance  institutions  for  MSME \nfinancing. The ACGF provides guarantees for loans of $10,000\u2013$500,000 or equivalent in afghani. As of March 2020, \nthe  ACGF  cumulatively  provided  5,500  guarantees  for  $238  million  worth  of  MSME  loans.  The  partial  credit \nguarantees supported about 550 loans, with an outstanding guaranteed portfolio of $20.7 million (footnote 9). \n\n33 IMF. 2020.

ADB will \nsupport debt sustainability during the Asian Development Fund 13 period (2021\u22122024) through \nadditional technical assistance (TA) for its developing member countries for the implementation \nof the Sustainable Development Finance Policy.38  \n \n22. \nCoordination with the International Monetary Fund and development partners. ADB \nhas  effectively  coordinated  with  the  IMF,  the  World  Bank,  and  other  development  partners  for \npandemic-related  assistance. 39  The  coordination  primarily  rests  on  (i)  the  Geneva  Mutual \nAccountability Framework (GMAF), adopted in November 2018 and updated during the pledging \nconference on Afghanistan on 23\u221224 November 2020; and (ii) the monthly meetings between the \ndonor countries, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, the World Bank, and ADB. \nThe  COVID-19-related  grants  and  loans  of  the  development  partners  are  additional  and \ncomplement the government\u2019s pandemic response package by expanding its scope and outreach \nand  building  implementation  capacity.  The  IMF  plays  a  critical  role  in  strengthening  the \nmacroeconomic management in Afghanistan in line with the GMAF requirements. To create the \nfiscal  space  during  the  pandemic,  the  IMF  approved  two  budget  support  loans  of  SDR161.9 \nmillion  ($220.0  million)  under  the  Rapid  Credit  Facility  in  April  2020  and  SDR259.04  million \n($370.0 million) under the ECF in November 2020. The World Bank has approved several COVID-\n19-related  grants,  financed  by  the  2020\u22122023  commitments  of  the  International  Development \nAssociation and the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund and/or savings generated from the \nexisting projects.40 The World Bank\u2019s health and social sector projects and budget support have \nhelped mitigate pandemic risks, keep basic infrastructure functioning, and support the recovery. \nThe World Bank\u2019s social protection projects are estimated to cover more than 90% of the country \nunder  the  president\u2019s  Destarkhwan-e-Milli  program,  benefitting  4.1  million  households  with \nincomes of less than $2/day. Other development partners such as the WHO, the United Nations, \nthe European Union, and bilateral donors have provided medical equipment and supplies, support \nfor pandemic management, cash transfers, in-kind food, and relief packages. \n \nC. \n \n23. \nADB\u2019s proposed program. The CARES Program provides budget support to meet the \ndevelopment financing needs arising from the government\u2019s countercyclical pandemic response \nmeasures  (paras.  17\u221220).  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1)  presents  the \nindicators reflecting the government\u2019s pandemic response. \n\nProposed Program, Impacts, Lessons Learned, and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\n \n\n38 World Bank. 2020. Sustainable Development Finance Policy. Washington, DC. \n39 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n40 The  World  Bank  approved  two  budget  support  grants:  $400  million  in  May  2020  under  the  Incentive  Program \nDevelopment Policy Grant, and $200 million in July 2020 under the COVID-19 Response Development Policy Grant. \nIn  April  2020,  it  approved  a $100.4  million  grant  under  the  COVID-19  Emergency  Response  and  Health  System \nPreparedness. The grants, approved in August 2020, included (i) $100 million under the Emergency Agriculture and \nFood Supply Project (EATS) to improve food security; and (ii) $280 million for the COVID-19 Relief Effort for Afghan \nCommunities and Households (REACH) Project to provide in-kind and cash support through community development \ncouncils for 2 million urban and peri-urban households, 363,000 urban households outside of Kabul, and 500,000 \nhouseholds in Kabul (of which 10% of the total households are targeted as households headed by women). Other \ngrants  include  (i)  $100  million  for  the  Strengthening  Afghanistan\u2019s  Financial  Intermediation  Project  to  support \nMSMEs; (ii) $193 million additional financing for the Citizens\u2019 Charter Afghanistan Project; (iii) $200 million for the \nAfghanistan Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Institutional Support Project; and (iv) $200 million for the Drought Early \nWarning, Finance, and Action Project to provide cash transfers to 500,000 households in 78 drought-prone districts.  \n\n \n\n\fImpact. The program is aligned with the following impact: adverse impacts of COVID-19 \n24. \non  the  population\u2019s  health,  incomes,  and  economic  opportunities  as  well  as  macroeconomic \nstability mitigated. The effect of the program is the COVID-19 outbreak more effectively managed \nand its adverse social and economic impacts reduced. The program has three outputs: (i) COVID-\n19 response and health system strengthening measures implemented, (ii) social protection for the \npoor households expanded, and (iii) affected sectors supported to prevent job losses from the \neconomic downturn. The program is aligned with the ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2017\u2013\n2021 for Afghanistan41 and the government\u2019s development strategy.42 \n \nLessons learned. The program draws on lessons from ADB\u2019s operations in Afghanistan43 \n25. \nand incorporates key elements of FCAS-sensitive program design:44 (i) strengthening institutional \ncapacity  of  line  ministries  in  coordination  with  development  partners,  (ii)  governance  risk \nmitigation  through  enhanced  oversight  and  due  diligence,  (iii)  targeted  social  assistance  and \nservice delivery for the poor and vulnerable people, and (iv) mainstreaming gender inclusion and \nequity. 45 The  program  design  incorporates  key  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  Countercyclical  Support \nFacility loans: (i) adequate, timely, and flexible budget support for stabilization measures without \njeopardizing fiscal sustainability; (ii) targeting social protection; (iii) establishing mechanisms for \nexpenditure tracking and independent verification; and (iv) providing TA when country systems \nare weak. The program incorporates lessons from the budget support loans of other development \npartners in Afghanistan, such as (i) leveraging community-based institutions for targeting social \nassistance and (ii) focusing on economic recovery through multisector support. \n  \n26. \nADB\u2019s value addition. The CARES Program design is based on ADB\u2019s extensive policy \ndialogue with the government to enhance the scope of the pandemic response to include support \nfor MSMEs and expand social protection. The program is part of ADB\u2019s comprehensive support \nfor  COVID-19  in  Afghanistan.  It  complements  two  regional  TA  projects  to  increase  health \ncooperation  in  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  countries  and  the \nCaucasus and to address the outbreak of COVID-19 and other communicable diseases,46 as well \nas the $40 million grant under the Emergency Assistance for COVID-19 Pandemic Response.47 \nADB\u2019s combined health sector support is a unique value addition for two reasons: (i) it strengthens \nthe  readiness  of  the  national  health  system  by  establishing  treatment  facilities  in  vulnerable \nprovinces; and (ii) it improves the resilience to future health emergencies  by strengthening the \npreventive health care, which is critical for containing the pressures on the public health system \nin  the  event  of  a  second  wave  of  infections.

These areas \naddress the key development constraints for an inclusive post-COVID-19 economic recovery.  \n \nD. \n \nBased on IMF estimates, the budget deficit excluding grants and loans has increased to \n27. \n$4.04 billion (21.2% of GDP) in 2020 compared to the pre-COVID-19 2020 projection of $2.85 \nbillion (13.6% of GDP) because of a sharp decline in revenues and rise in expenditures, including \nthe countercyclical pandemic response measures (paras. 17\u221220). The budget deficit, including \ngrants and loans, is projected to increase to $577.92 million (3.0% of GDP) in 2020 compared to \nthe pre-COVID-19 2020 projection of $161.04 million (0.8% of GDP) (Table 3). The government \nwill  finance  the  deficit  through  the  grant  of  $100  million  from  the  CARES  Program,  its  cash \nreserves,  and  other  sources  given  that  there  is  no  government  securities  market  for  domestic \nborrowing. The government has requested a grant not exceeding $100 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund). The grant is expected to be disbursed in December \n2020. The grant size is based on Afghanistan\u2019s financing needs and development spending. \n \n\nTable 3: Development Financing Needs and Budget Support for 2020 \n($ million) \n\nItem \nI.

The  ECF  approved  in  November \n2020 will support fiscal governance, financial sector, anti\n\ncorruption, value-added tax and social safety net. \n\n61 Assessment of Public Financial Management System in Afghanistan (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\u2011\n\nAppendix 2). \n\n62 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n63 Gender Monitoring Matrix (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f60,000  permanent  agriculture  sector jobs,  of  which  at  least  30% are  provided  to  women,  as  a \nresult of sector-specific incentives.  \n \n32. \nSafeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \nis classified category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. It is \nnot expected to have any environmental or social safeguard impacts.64 \n\n \nRisk mitigating measures. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table \n\n33. \n4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.65 \n\n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nThe COVID-19 pandemic is prolonged, leading to \nwidespread  economic  disruptions, \nloss  of \nemployment, and increasing poverty, necessitating \nmore financial resources than originally envisaged. \nPolitical risks after the presidential election and the \ndeterioration  of  the  security  situation  could  divert \nthe  government\u2019s  attention  from  the  program \nimplementation.  \nGaps  in  the  government\u2019s  institutional  capacity \ncoupled with highly overstretched staff responding \nto  the  pandemic  undermine  achievement  of  the \nexpected results. \nWeak  PFM  systems  undermine \ntransparent, \nefficient,  and  cost-effective  allocation  of  public \nresources  and  implementation  of  countercyclical \npandemic response measures. \n\nMitigation Measures \nThe  government  supports  the  affected  sectors,  job  creation, \nand social safety nets. It engages with development partners, \nincluding  ADB,  to  obtain  financial  and  technical  support  to \nmitigate the impact of the pandemic. \nThe  government  is  committed  to  the  implementation  of  the \ncountercyclical measures, which are not considered political in \nnature  even  in  a  conflict-affected  environment,  and  are  also \nstrongly supported by development partners.  \nContinuous  engagement  between \nthe  government  and \ndevelopment partners strengthens the capacity to deal with the \npandemic,  as  well  as  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the \ncountercyclical measures. ADB TA provides capacity building. \nThe  IMF,  ADB,  and  development  partners  support  PFM \nimprovements,  anticorruption  measures,  and  governance  as \nthe  government\u2019s  high-priority  reforms.  ADB  provides  TA  to \nstrengthen  PFM,  fiscal  and  debt management,  procurement, \nand safeguards systems.  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, IMF = International Monetary Fund, PFM = public \nfinancial management, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \n34. \nall  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  financial  management,  and  disbursement,  as \ndescribed in detail in the grant agreement. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION  \n\n \n35. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the grant not exceeding \n$100,000,000 to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian \nDevelopment Fund) for the COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program, on \nterms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft grant \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \n\n25 November 2020 \n\n \n\n64 Safeguard Assessment Matrix (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n65 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nResults Chain \nEffect of the \nProgram \nCOVID-19 outbreak \nmore effectively \nmanaged and its \nadverse social and \neconomic impacts \nreducedb  \n\nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nAdverse impacts of COVID-19 on the population\u2019s health, incomes, and economic opportunities as well \nas macroeconomic stability mitigateda \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPerformance Indicators with Targets \nand Baselines \n\nBy 31 December 2021: \n \na.

Since the first COVID-19 case was reported in Herat on 23 February 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak \nhas reached 44,706 confirmed cases with 1,617 deaths as of 23 November 2020 based on WHO data. A public health \nemergency  caused  by  the  pandemic  has  aggravated  the  pressures  on  the  constrained  health  care  system \ninfrastructure  and  capacity  due  to  large  deficiencies  in  hospital  beds,  medical  equipment,  personnel,  and  testing \ncapacity. The fragile health situation in Afghanistan is further complicated by the ongoing armed conflict, insecurity \nand political uncertainties, influx of 666,257 Afghan migrants and refugees from Iran and 5,502 from Pakistan during \nJanuary\u2013October 2020, and more than 86,419 IDPs by the end of May 2020 due to conflict and disasters triggered by \nnatural hazards. Due to limited public health resources and testing capacity, reluctance of people coming forward for \ntesting due to social stigma on COVID-19, as well as the absence of a national death register, confirmed cases of and \ndeaths from COVID-19 are likely to be underreported across Afghanistan. The WHO notes that the official numbers \nare unlikely to be capturing the full scale of the situation since testing remains limited to only the most severe cases. \n \nBesides the challenges faced by hospitals to treat patients with COVID-19 and maintain health services, especially in \nareas of active conflict, the COVID-19 pandemic has put additional financial burden on the citizens, infected with the \nvirus. While the MOPH provides a basic package of health services (introduced in 2003) and an essential package of \nhospital services (introduced in 2005) together with the nongovernmental organizations, which  are free for Afghan \ncitizens, in the absence of comprehensive health insurance, the cost of the health care expenditures is primarily borne \nby high out-of-pocket expenditures of the households (73%) while the rest is covered by the government (6%) and \ninternational donors (21%). The World Bank, the European Union, and the USAID are the three largest donors to both \npackages. With support from the USAID, the MOPH had earlier developed a document for health financing policy for \n2012\u22122020 and a strategy. However, absence of a legal framework for state-funded insurance schemes, gaps in the \ntaxation system and lack of risk pooling mechanisms for households have impeded the health insurance development. \n \nEconomic impact. Because of the lockdown measures since late March 2020 impacting local businesses, disruptions \nin supply chains, regional trade, and a drop in consumer demand with income shock borne by the households, the \npandemic has led to a sharp contraction in the economy. Based on the IMF estimates, in contrast to the pre-COVID-\n19 GDP growth projection of 3.5% for 2020, the economy is projected to contract by 5.0% in 2020 from a growth of \n3.9%  in  2019.  A  growth  of  5%  in  agriculture  sector  due  to  favorable  weather  conditions  is  offset  by  the  projected \ncontraction in industry by 5% and in services by 9.6% in 2020.  \n \nFiscal  pressure.  The  pandemic  is  creating  significant  fiscal  pressure  on  Afghanistan.  Based  on  IMF  estimates, \ndomestic revenues are projected to decline to $2.31 billion (12.1% of GDP) in 2020 compared to $2.66 billion (14.1% \nof GDP) in 2019 and the pre-COVID-19 2020 projection of $2.71 billion (13.0% of GDP). Expenditures are projected \nto increase to $6.35 billion (33.3% of GDP) in 2020 driven by COVID-19 and pro-poor related spending compared to \n$5.28 billion (28.0% of GDP) in 2019 and the pre-COVID-19 2020 projection of $5.56 billion (26.6% of GDP).  \n \n\n\f \n\nAccess Criteria \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n27 \n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \nThe  budget  deficit  excluding  grants  and  loans  is  projected  to  increase  to  $4.04  billion  (21.2%  of  GDP)  in  2020 \ncompared to $2.62 billion (13.9% of GDP) in 2019 and the pre-COVID-19 2020 projection of $2.85 billion (13.6% of \nGDP).  The  pro-poor  spending  is  projected  to  increase  from  3.7%  of  GDP  in  2019  to  5.3%  of  GDP  in  2020  with \nadditional COVID-19 related expenditures undertaken, equivalent to 2.9% of GDP in 2020. The budget deficit including \ngrants and loans is projected to increase to $577.92 million (3.0% of GDP) in 2020 compared to the pre-COVID-19 \n2020 projection of $161.04 million (0.8% of GDP). \n  \nInternational trade, reserves, and exchange rate. Due to border closures, disruptions to land and air transport, and \nlower  demand in Afghanistan\u2019s export markets, the  merchandise exports are projected contract by  35.4% and the \nimports by 2.4% in 2020. The current account deficit\u2212GDP ratio is projected to widen from 27.0% in 2019 to 30.6% in \n2020. On the other hand, the current account including official transfers as a share of GDP is projected to have a \nsurplus  of  9.3%  in  2020  (compared  to  11.7%  in  2019).  The  official  reserves  will  increase  to  $8.9  billion  in  2020 \n(compared to $8.6 billion in 2019) equivalent to 14.3 months of import coverage.  The afghani\u2013dollar exchange rate \nhas  slightly  appreciated  (about  1%)  driven  by  lower  imports  and  increased  demand  for  afghanis  in  provinces \nneighboring Pakistan where its use was promoted instead of Pakistani rupees for domestic transactions. \n \nInflation. Given Afghanistan\u2019s dependence on imported food and non-food products, consumer price inflation (driven \nby food prices) is projected to increase from 2.3% in 2019 to 5.4% in 2020 and will remain high at 4.8% in 2021. The \nfood  price  inflation  spiked  in  the  first  half  of  2020  following  the  border  controls  and  lockdown  measures  in  urban \ncenters. The food price inflation is forecast to reach 17.5% by the end of 2020 (with its period-average rate projected \nat 13.3% for the full year). Price volatility has moderated since April 2020, following distribution of wheat from strategic \ngrain reserves, enforcement of anti-price-gouging regulations, and the reopening of borders for food imports.  \n \nBanking sector. With the pandemic, financial soundness and profitability of the banking sector have deteriorated. \nDriven by withdrawal of savings and working capital by firms due to economic difficulties, total deposits in the banking \nsector declined by 3% over the first four months of 2020. Credit growth to private sector is projected to drop from 1.8% \nin 2019 to 1.0% in 2020 because of the economic downturn and increasing risk aversion by banks in response to \ndeclining debt servicing  and repayment capacity of businesses.  As  of June 2020, while the ratio of capital to risk-\nweighted assets stood at 26.7% (higher than the thresholds of 8.0% under Basel II and 10.5% under Basel III), the \nratio of nonperforming loans to gross loans increased to 29.4% compared from 14.5% at the end of 2019. The banking \nsector made a loss in  the first quarter of 2020 reflected  in  a return on asset ratio of  negative 0.13% down  from a \npositive ratio of 0.83% in December 2019. The DAB has intensified monitoring and supervision of the banking sector.  \n \nMicro, small and medium-sized enterprises. Nearly 250,000 MSMEs that play a crucial role for the private sector \nhave been hit hard during the pandemic. The MSMEs accounted for nearly 1.6 million jobs in services and industry, \nand  the  MSMEs  with  less  than  10  employees  accounted  for  over  80%  of  non-agricultural  employment  before  the \npandemic. Services accounted for 52.6% of Afghanistan\u2019s GDP while industry accounted for 24.1% and agriculture \n18.6% in 2018. As of August 2020, there were 218,226 micro enterprises; 7,776 small businesses; 20,187 medium-\nsized businesses; and 1,787 large businesses across Afghanistan. Around 62% of MSMEs operate in the provinces \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nAccess Criteria \n\n \n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \nand  the  rest  in  Kabul.  Micro  enterprises  comprise  88%  of  MSMEs.  Out  of  29,750  small,  medium-sized  and  large \nbusinesses, only 10.6% are in manufacturing and the rest is in services sector. \n \nLockdown  measures and fall in consumer demand  have put immediate  pressures on  MSMEs due to disruption of \nsupply chains, shortage of inputs, loss of labor, forced sale of firms\u2019 assets, limited working capital, cash flow shortages \nin covering operating costs, loss of revenues and lack of access to credit. Due to urban lockdowns, travel to retail \nstores, transit service locations, and workplaces dropped by 50%. Financial inclusion is very weak in Afghanistan with \nonly 15% of the adult population having a bank account and only 5% of MSMEs having access to a line of bank credit. \nOver 50% of Afghan MSMEs are financially constrained with most of the financing handled through the informal sector \nmoney transfers (hawalas). The MSMEs owned or managed by women represent only 2% of the MSME financing. \n \nUnemployment. Job losses caused by business closures carry the risk of large-scale unemployment, estimated to \nincrease from 23.9% in 2019 to 37.9% by the end of 2020. If underemployment is added, the figure will reach 53.5% \nof the  labor force, corresponding to nearly 4.8  million people (an increase  of 1.5 million  people from 2019) will  be \neither unemployed or under-employed by the end of 2020. \n \nRemittances.  Economic  downturn  in  countries  with  large  Afghan  diasporas  (e.g.  Iran  and  Pakistan)  has  affected \nhouseholds that rely on remittances. It is projected that the remittances will fall by more than 50% in 2020 compared \nto nearly $868 million received in 2019. Over 50% of household income in the poorest quintile, corresponding to 15 \nmillion Afghans depend on remittances or income from informal sector activities. There are regions like Ghazni and \nKhost where over 20% of households heavily depend on remittances. \n \nPoverty. According to World Bank, the national poverty rate is projected to reach at least 61.0% (and potentially to \n72.0%) from a baseline of 54.5% in 2017, forcing an additional 1.9 million\u20136.0 million people into poverty by the end \nof  2020.  Lockdown  measures,  supply  disruptions  and  reduced  crop  sales  have  impacted  the  agriculture  sector, \naccounting for 44% of the workforce and 60% of household income. The impact of the pandemic on urban households, \nespecially for daily wage earners in the informal sector, is more regressive. Day labor from activities like shop keeping, \nstreet or market sales, construction, or personal services accounts for more than 40% of non-agricultural employment \nfor the bottom quintile, corresponding to 2 million households (15 million Afghans). Up to 80% of employment is in the \ninformal  sector  with  no  social  and  legal  protection  for  the  workers.  Spikes  in  import  prices  due  to  shortages  or \ndisruptions in food supply have adversely affected households in the bottom 60%, for whom food purchase comprises \nhalf of their total consumption. About 12.4 million Afghans face the risk of being pushed into food security deprivation. \n \nImpact on women and the vulnerable population. Afghanistan ranked 143rd out of 162 economies on the Gender \nInequality Index in 2018 (compared to 154th out of 159 countries in 2016). The pandemic exacerbated the gender-\nbased inequalities because of (i) increased restrictions on women\u2019s participation in social and economic life due to \nnationwide lockdown in addition to restrictions from the traditional and patriarchal norms; (ii) limited access to gender-\nsensitive health care services, with only 15% of nurses and 2% of medical doctors being female, and social norms \nprohibiting female patients from being treated by male doctors; (iii) inadequate dissemination of COVID-19 information \n\n\f \n\nAccess Criteria \n \n\n2. Countercyclical \nDevelopment \nExpenditures \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n29 \n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \ndue to lower female literacy (18%) compared to male literacy (62%); (iv) increasing economic dependence and risk of \nfood insecurity as women have limited labor  force participation (29% for working age women in 2016) and old-age \npension coverage as well as higher job losses compared to men with over 50% of the employed women in MSMEs \nnot  able to come to work  during the  pandemic; (v) vulnerability to gender-based violence; and (vi)  poor  access to \nsanitation. About 70% of the employed women (both formal and informal) are in the agricultural sector while 24% are \nin manufacturing. The share of women in wage employment in non-agricultural sector is only 10% as of 2018. Pension \nspending is 0.6% of GDP covering only 9.2% of population over 64 years of age and 8% of the labor force. Ongoing \nconflict causing casualties, lockdown measures, and the pressures on the health care system have aggravated the \nhardship  faced  by  the  families  of  the  military  and  civilian  people  killed  during  conflicts,  and  disabled  civilians  and \nveterans with special needs. The pandemic has affected 9 million school-age children, of which 39% are girls. Around \n20% of women and 41% of children under 5 years of age are malnourished as of 2019 and this will likely increase, \nunderscoring the importance of food distribution for humanitarian assistance. \n \nOn 16 March 2020, the Government of Afghanistan established the High-level Committee for COVID-19 as an inter-\nministerial task force, chaired by the president and the first vice president and rolled out its comprehensive pro-poor \ncountercyclical  pandemic  response  package  with  gender  focus.  The  High-level  Committee  has  comprised  MOF, \nMOPH, Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, IDLG, National Statistics and Information Authority, Ministry \nof Commerce and Industry, and Kabul Municipality. The MOF was tasked with the coordination of the development \npartner support while MOPH with the implementation of the health sector support.  \n \nUnder the instructions of the committee, MOF made two amendments to the 2020 national budget \u2014on 7 April 2020, \napproved  by  Presidential  Decree  No.  82,  and  on  29  July  2020,  approved  by  Presidential  Decree  No.  47\u2014and  a \nrevision  during  the  midyear  review  on  28  September  2020,  approved  by  the  cabinet,  to  reprioritize  resources  for \nresponding  to  the  economic  downturn,  and  undertaking  the  countercyclical  pandemic  response  package.  The \npandemic response package amounts to $633.92 million (3.3% of GDP), comprising health-related measures ($70.35 \nmillion), social protection measures ($169.71 million) and macroeconomic stabilization measures ($393.86 million).  \n \nHealth-related measures. Aligned with NERP, the MOPH has undertaken (i) strengthening of the capacity of medical \nfacilities, testing laboratories and surveillance sites, including at border crossings; (ii) emergency procurement of the \nnecessary medicines and medical equipment such as testing kits, ventilators, medical masks; (iii) recruitment, training \nand incentive payments of the medical staff, and (iv) gender-sensitive public awareness campaign (details on health \nsector related expenditures provided under Criteria 4).  \n \nSocial  protection  measures.  The  government  has  undertaken  countercyclical  measures  to  expand  the  social \nprotection  to  mitigate  the  risks  of  food  insecurity  and  rising  poverty.  Coverage  of  the  social  safety  nets  has  been \nexpanded to include women and vulnerable people such as children, old-age pensioners and their female heirs, IDPs \nand refugees, military and civilian disabled people and the families of the killed people during conflicts, who have been \ndisproportionally impacted by the adverse impacts of the pandemic. The MOF provided an emergency cash transfer \nof AF2.42 billion ($31.43 million) to all 34 provinces through IDLG given the essential role of the local governments in \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nAccess Criteria \n\n \n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \nimplementation of containment measures and provision of vital services and social support to communities. The total \nIDLG budget was raised by $45.3 million since the beginning of 2020 to augment pandemic response capacity.  \n \nTo address food shortages and stabilize the food prices, the government opened the national food reserves for public \nuse in April. A bread distribution program, supervised by the first vice-president, was launched in all provinces in May \n2020  and  implemented  by  the  local  governments  and  municipalities.  The  program  benefited  more  than  310,000 \nfamilies  below  the  poverty  line.  District  and  village-level  monitoring  committees  have  been  formed  to  identify  and \ndocument the people in need and supervise the bread distribution process through local bakeries. Packages with 4.5 \nkilograms of wheat were distributed to 1,000 families in Kabul during the business closures. In coordination with the \nCOVID-19 Emergency Committee and the Kabul mayor\u2019s office, the government covered the water and electricity bills \nof 350,000 poor families, who had a bill equal to or less than AF1,000 ($13) for 2 months during the lockdown in April\u2013\nMay 2020, providing relief to 1.5 million residents (50% of utility users) in Kabul. About 10% of the total households \nhave been targeted as households headed by women for these in-kind and financial relief measures. The government \nhas supported the coverage of 99,368 old-age pensioners, of which 5,468 are women and 30,943 female heirs. Out \nof the total 130,311 pensioners and their female heirs (inclusive of 9,379 new beneficiaries  in 2020), 86,404 have \nbiometric registration under E-NID, which will improve targeting of these beneficiaries. The Ministry of Refugees and \nRepatriation provides one-time cash transfer benefitting 41,500 IDPs and refugees from  Iran  and Pakistan.  At the \nbeginning of 2020, remuneration was provided to 338,056 people, comprising both military and civilian disabled people \nand the families (including female heirs) of people killed during conflicts. Out of the total, 272,006 were civilians. During \n2020, the remuneration coverage has been increased by 32,570 additional military and civilian disabled people, and \nfamilies of those killed during conflicts \n \nMacroeconomic  stabilization  measures.  The  government  has  rolled  out  countercyclical  macroeconomic \nstabilization measures to strengthen the monetary policy, provide fiscal relief, strengthen support for a critical SOE, \nthe MSMEs and affected sectors, and promote pro-poor and gender-inclusive job creation. Although the government \nhas not introduced any large tax waivers or deferrals, it has extended filing deadlines for the first and second quarters \nof the fiscal year by 45 days for individuals and business taxpayers to ease tax compliance. The government also \nprovided financial support to the power utility company, Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat to cover the losses from \nlower electricity demand and past due electricity bills of the government agencies which were pending for the last few \nyears. This is aligned with the reforms supported by the World Bank and ADB to improve the operational efficiency \nand financial sustainability of the power sector. To create nearly 1.9 million temporary jobs and  60,000 permanent \njobs,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Irrigation  and  Livestock  has  supported  processing  and  packaging  units  and  cold \nstorage  at  the  rural  community  level  under  the  government\u2019s  Afghanistan  Crop  Management  Project  to  prevent \nwastage of high value perishable fresh fruit and vegetables that could not be exported. Agriculture sector is critical for \nwomen\u2019s livelihoods as 70% of female employment mainly takes place in this sector.  \n \nOn 1 October 2020, the High Economic Council of Afghanistan approved a 2-year MSME support package for $294.8 \nmillion, with $200 million to be provided in 2021 and the remainder in 2022. It provides (i) $44.80 million for exemptions \nor deferments of tax penalties, municipality fees, property rent for government land and buildings, (ii) $120 million for \n\n\f \n\nAccess Criteria \n \n\n3. Pre-shock Record of \nGenerally Sound \nMacroeconomic \nManagement \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n31 \n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \nfirst loss fund to cover banks\u2019 losses from MSME lending, (iii) $50 million subsidized loans, (iv) $50 million for support \nfor  industrial  parks,  (v)  $10  million  for  vocational  training  and  (vi)  $20  million  support  for  access  to  international \nmarkets. The support will also help streamline existing MSME-related programs at Ministry of Industry and Commerce \nand  Ministry  of  Women\u2019s  Affairs,  including  the  program  for  Women  Rural  Development  and  Women  Economic \nEmpowerment.  Exemptions  and  deferments  of  tax  penalties,  municipal  fees  and  rental  expenses  on  government \nproperty  have  been  partially  introduced  in  2020  and  will  continue  to  provide  fiscal  relief  to  MSMEs  during  the \nimplementation as well. The support includes a first-loss fund, managed by the MOF and DAB including support from \nthe ACGF, to cover banking sector losses from MSME lending as well as subsidized loans to MSMEs provided by \nstate-owned and private sector banks in Afghanistan.  \n \nIn 2020, there are 7 private commercial banks, one private Islamic bank, 3 state-owned banks, and 2 foreign bank \nbranches  in  Afghanistan.  There  is  also  a  formal  microfinance  sector,  consisting  Microfinance  Investment  Support \nFacility for Afghanistan and 6 microfinance institutions.  \n \nSmall-scale  MSMEs  in  the  manufacturing  sector  will  be  supported  in  industrial  parks  in  five  major  cities  (Kabul, \nKandahar, Nangarhar, Mazar, and Herat). Local universities will support incubators for entrepreneurs. The vocational \ntraining will be provided in collaboration with the Technical and Vocational Education and Training Directorate, Ministry \nof Higher Education, Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs and nongovernmental organizations. Trade-related support \naims  at  strengthening  access  of  the  MSMEs  to  international  markets  and  increasing  integration  of  Afghanistan\u2019s \nchambers of commerce and entrepreneurs with regional partners. \n \nOn  the  monetary  side,  the  DAB  has  reduced  the  provisioning  requirements  for  loans  that  are  covered  by  risk \nguarantees from the ACGF to sustain lending to the private sector. With this policy, bank credit to MSMEs with ACGF \nguarantees as a share of total bank lending is projected to be at least 17% by end 2021. To strengthen the banking \nsector, DAB has been regularly monitoring early signs of stress and stands ready to provide liquidity to the financial \nsector as needed. The frequency of Financial Stability Committee meetings has been increased. The DAB developed \na post-COVID-19 improvement plan  for the banking  sector  from July 2020  until December 2021. The DAB has (i) \nenforced the prudential requirements but at the same time suspended the administrative penalties and fees with no \nretrospective  applications  for  breaches  or  noncompliance  as  a  form  of  regulatory  forbearance  until  July  2020;  (ii) \npostponed the  implementation  of international financial reporting standards (IFRS-9) to June 2021;  and (iii) frozen \nloan classifications at the end of February 2020 as a pre-pandemic cutoff date. \n \nDespite the difficult security situation, elevated political uncertainties and external shocks triggered by natural hazards \nthat hampered economic activity, Afghanistan has maintained a generally sound pre-shock record of macroeconomic \nmanagement  leading  up  to  the  crisis.  Afghanistan\u2019s  macroeconomic  and  financial  management  policies  were \nanchored under the IMF\u2019s 3.5-year ECF arrangement, approved in July 2016, and completed in December 2019. The \nECF was a critical driver of structural macroeconomic, fiscal and governance reforms, strengthening (i) tax system \nwith  value  added  tax,  (ii)  monetary  policy  for  price  and  exchange  rate  stability,  (iii)  fiscal  governance,  (iv)  anti-\n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nAccess Criteria \n\n4. Structural Reforms \n(Health Sector \nResponse)  \n\n \n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \ncorruption, (v) state-owned banks, (vi)  management  of public investment, fiscal risks and spending efficiency, (vii) \nasset declaration, and (viii) social protection.  \n \nAfghanistan achieved GDP growth of 2.6% in 2017, 1.2% in 2018 and 3.9% in 2019 driven by the agriculture sector\u2019s \nrecovery. The DAB has lowered the inflation from 5.0% in 2017 to 0.6% in 2018 and 2.3% in 2019. It has also taken \nmeasures to  improve the capital adequacy, governance, and  liquidity  of the banking sector, and strengthened  the \nfinancial supervisory framework by establishing the Financial Stability Committee. To strengthen the financial inclusion \nand financial sector intermediation,  the  government has started  implementation  of the National Financial Inclusion \nStrategy, 2019\u20132024 since September 2019.  \n \nWith continued aid inflows (reaching nearly 40% of GDP), the government has maintained a broadly balanced fiscal \nstance with budget deficit (including grants and loans)\u2212GDP ratios of 0.7% in 2017 and 1.1% in 2019 while having a \nsurplus of 1.6% in 2018. Reflecting improvements in budget execution and prioritization, operating expenditures\u2212GDP \nratio has declined from 19.7% of GDP in 2017 to 18.5% in 2019, while the development expenditures\u2212GDP ratio has \nincreased from 8.0% in 2017 to 9.5% in 2019 and pro-poor spending\u2212GDP ratio has increased from 3.0% in 2017 to \n3.7%  in  2019.  Reflecting  prudent  fiscal  and  debt  management,  international  reserves  (over  $8  billion  during \n2017\u22122019) have accounted for 14.5 months of imports in 2019 and public debt\u2212GDP ratio has remained stable at \nabout 6% under a policy of highly concessional external borrowing. Domestic borrowing is negligible in Afghanistan \nwith only two promissory note issuances worth 1.2% of GDP in 2017 and 0.5% of GDP in 2018 but the issuances \nwere discontinued in 2019 and 2020.  \n \nLarge current account deficits have continued to be financed by donor grants. The current account surplus including \nofficial transfers has increased from 7.6% in 2017 to 12.2% in 2018 and 11.7% in 2019. To reduce aid dependence, \nthe government has adopted measures to promote exports and regional trade.  Tax reforms have been  initiated in \n2019  for  expansion  of  tax  base,  adoption  of  value-added  tax,  planned  by  early  2022  and  increased  tax  collection \nefficiency by consolidating large taxpayers (accounting for 16% of domestic revenues including customs) under Single \nLarge Taxpayer Office. These reforms have improved the revenue\u2212GDP ratio from 13.1% in 2017 to 14.1% in 2019.  \n \nThe macroeconomic management during the pandemic has been on track and further supported by the IMF\u2019s ECF, \napproved  in  November  2020.  The  government  remains  committed  to  implementation  of  macroeconomic  structural \nreforms and PFM reforms to improve the effectiveness of the countercyclical pandemic response measures. \n \nThe government has promptly responded  to the COVID-19 pandemic by introducing  strict nationwide containment \nmeasures to prevent the community transmission and strengthening the capacity and readiness of the health system \nfor the  pandemic and future health emergencies over the  medium and  long term.  The government\u2019s health sector \nstructural reforms have been pro-poor with strong gender focus. \n \nSocial distancing and containment measures. To prevent community spread after the first case was diagnosed on \n23 February 2020, a nation-wide lockdown was introduced in late March 2020, followed by imposition of preventive \n\n\f \n\nAccess Criteria \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n33 \n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \nsocial distancing and containment measures. On 6 June 2020, the nationwide lockdown was extended for three more \nmonths until early August, with new health guidelines, (i) requiring face masks in public places at all times and older \npeople staying home; (ii) introducing restrictions on public transport and screening at ports of entry; (iii) closing all \neducational centers and public places for gathering; (iv) disinfecting workplaces; and (v) reducing business hours for \ngovernment  and  nongovernmental  organizations.  MOPH  in  coordination  with  Kabul  Municipality  has  disinfected \nresidential buildings, roads, and government offices (including ministries, jails, and hospitals) and provided guidelines \non disinfection. On 26 March 2020, over 12,000 prisoners were released and directed to stay in home quarantine for \n14 days with a presidential decree as part of the COVID-19 prevention measures. Since mid-July, border crossings \nand  domestic  and  international  flights  have  resumed.  Public  schools  (11th  and  12th  Grades)  and  both  public  and \nprivate  universities  have  reopened  on  22  August  2020.  The  1st  \u2013  10th  grades  of  the  public  schools  have  been \nreopened since 3 October  2020. However, the private schools (1st \u2013 12th Grade) have been conditionally opened \nsince 22 August 2020 if they provide the minimum health measures such as masks, social distancing, etc.  \n \nInstitutional framework of health sector measures. The MOPH approved the NERP for COVID-19 in March 2020 \nand developed an action plan for the preventive measures. A new structure within MOPH was created to implement \nthe  NERP  and  the  action  plan.  The  NERP  details  the  medium  and  long-term  strategy  for  a  robust  national  health \nsecurity agenda for all hazards and pandemic preparedness, as well as the resource requirements and development \ncoordination  for  (i)  surveillance  and  detection;  (ii)  early  diagnosis,  isolation,  and  case  management;  (iii)  infection \nprevention and control in health facilities and communities; (iv) risk mitigation; and (v) resource allocation for logistics \nand procurement for emergency responses based on the COVID-19 preparedness and response plans of the WHO \nand  the  UNICEF.  Based  on  NERP,  the  estimated  health  sector  resource  requirement  for  the  pandemic  response \n(using three scenarios of low to high transmission) ranges between $123 million to $892 million.  \n \nIn April 2020, provincial emergency committees for COVID-19 were formed in all 34 provinces, comprising governors, \nprovincial councils, provincial health administrations, municipalities, and civil society in collaboration with WHO and \nrelevant UN agencies for surveillance, health care services, and risk communication. The local governments play a \ncritical  role  in  implementation  of  national  containment  measures  as  well  as  provision  of  vital  services  and  social \nprotection support. \n \nImplementation of health sector measures. Based on the national action plan, the MOPH has been strengthening \nthe capacity of medical facilities with strong gender focus such as establishment of women-only treatment areas at \nidentified  medical  facilities  and  provision  of  appropriately  sized  personal  protective  gears,  including  individual \npackages for female health workers. Nearly 570,000 units of personal protective equipment were provided to health \nworkers nationwide as of 12 November 2020 with support from development partners such as WHO, World Bank, \nUNICEF  and  bilateral  donors.  Furthermore,  8  hospitals  have  been  designated  for  exclusive  use  by  the  COVID-19 \npatients; around 3,100 beds in 34 provinces have  been  assigned  to  COVID-19  patients, from which  1,030 are for \ncritical patients. Medical equipment has been provided for 1,642 isolation beds across all 34 provinces. A new 100-\nbed COVID-19 hospital has been opened in Herat province. In Kabul, the Darulaman Palace (300 beds) as well as \nKabul and Polytechnic universities\u2019 dormitories have been converted to isolation facilities. MOPH has been preparing \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nAccess Criteria \n\n5. Debt Sustainability \n\n \n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \n10 additional 50-bed medical facilities in Herat, Farrah, Neemruz and Kabul. Development partners, including ADB \nhave been providing support to MOPH to rehabilitate and expand new treatment facilities including prefabricated ones. \n \nA  total  of  14  COVID-19  testing  labs  across  the  country  with  5  labs  in  Kabul  were  established,  equipped  with  500 \nventilators purchased through the National Procurement Authority, polymerase chain reaction machines and testing \nkits. As of 12 November 2020, 4,350 healthcare workers received training on infection prevention and control, 3,931 \nhealthcare  workers  on  surveillance  and  risk  communication,  444  healthcare  workers  on  intensive  care  and  193 \nhealthcare workers on medical laboratory testing. With the private hospitals also allowed to conduct tests, Afghanistan \nhas reached the capacity to carry out 5,500 tests per day and as of 19 November 2020, 133,691 tests were conducted.  \n \nTo strengthen surveillance and early detection, in addition to 525 MOPH sites, COVID-19 surveillance sites in airports, \nborders, and city entrance points have been established and mobile teams have been trained.  As of 12 November \n2020,  519,023  people  have  been  medically  screened  at  points-of-entry  and  the  surveillance  systems  have  traced \n591,232 people since the start of the crisis in March 2020.  Nearly 4,000 governmental and nongovernmental units \noperate  across  the  country  to  gather  information  daily  and  share  with  the  national  and  international  health \norganizations.  MOPH  has  recruited  and  trained  more  than  6,000  medical  staff  with  additional  3,000  medical  staff \nplanned to be hired. Medical staff has been provided salaries with incentive payments. \n \nA  nationwide  gender-sensitive  public  awareness  campaign  on  COVID-19  has  been  carried  out  by  the  MOPH  and \nMinistry of Women Affairs. Using mosques, educational institutions as well as national print and broadcasting media, \nsocial media, billboards, cell phone messages, around 10 million pieces of COVID-19 related informational documents \nhave been distributed. Nearly 3 million people have been sensitized about hygiene promotion through handwashing \nstations and distribution of hygiene kits. Ministry of Women Affairs has been involved in 117 districts in 26 provinces \nby (i) visiting women jails, safe homes, shelters, businesses headed by women, orphanages, private banks, hospitals \nand clinics to distribute gender-sensitive information and sanitary kits, (ii) monitoring adherence to safety measures, \nand  (iii)  facilitating  gender-sensitive  services  for  women,  particularly  in  hospitals  with  all  women-only  treatment \nfacilities. Health kits for street children have been distributed. A call center was set up at MOPH.  \n \nDevelopment partner support. The government has also received support from the WHO, United Nations agencies, \nand development partners for procurement of medical equipment and supplies, expansion of health sector capacity \nwith new facilities,  capacity building on pandemic management and provision of  health services for the vulnerable \ncommunities such as IDPs, refugees, women and children during the pandemic. Besides the health sector measures, \nthe  government\u2019s  response  includes  expansion  of  social  protection  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable  people,  and \nmacroeconomic stabilization measures with further details provided under criteria 2.  \n \nAfghanistan has become eligible for DSSI, endorsed in April 2020 by the World Bank\u2019s Development Committee and \nthe G20 finance ministers in response to a call by the World Bank and the IMF to grant debt service suspension to the \npoorest  countries.  In  return,  beneficiaries  of  DSSI  commit  to  use  freed-up  resources  to  increase  social,  health,  or \neconomic spending in response to the pandemic while disclosing all public sector financial commitments (involving \n\n\f \n\nAccess Criteria \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n35 \n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \ndebt and debt-like instruments) and limiting their non-concessional borrowing as supported by ceilings under the IMF \nprograms  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  non-concessional  borrowing  policies.  Around  $4  million  of  interest  and  principal \npayments to bilateral creditors during May\u2212December 2020 will be paid starting 2022. Afghanistan\u2019s potential DSSI \nsavings are $39.1 million (0.2% of 2019 GDP) based on estimated debt service payments. Furthermore, the IMF has \nprovided debt service relief of SDR4.8 million ($6.8 million) under two tranches in April 2020 and October 2020 with \na total relief of SDR10.05 million ($14.4 million) by 2022 under the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust. \n \nDuring the pandemic, the IMF provided a concessional loan of SDR161.9 million ($220 million) under the Rapid Credit \nFacility, approved on 29 April 2020. An additional concessional IMF loan of SDR259.04 million ($370 million) under \nthe ECF arrangement was approved on 6 November 2020. These budget support loans represent 49% of outstanding \npublic debt stock of $1.2 billion. In 2020, Afghanistan also received infrastructure project loans of $208 million from \nsome development partners adding another 17% to the public debt stock. Based on ADB\u2019s DSA, which simulated \nscenarios on drivers of debt dynamics such as growth, exchange rate, real interest rate, and primary deficit, these \nloans will increase the public debt\u2212GDP ratio from 6.3% in 2019 to 10.7% in 2020 and 16.6% of GDP in 2021, however \nthe ratio is projected to decline to 13.4% in 2024. These loans will not significantly increase the annual debt service \nobligations and debt sustainability as the  public debt  will stay moderately low.  ADB\u2019s $100  million grant  under the \nCARES Program will help create fiscal space and improve debt sustainability during the pandemic.  \n \nAfghanistan\u2019s public debt sustainability hinges on continuing net inflows of highly concessional development finance \nover the medium and long term. Liabilities consist mostly of concessional and project-based loans from multilateral \nand bilateral creditors. This keeps borrowing costs low and limits rollover and interest-rate risks, although the foreign-\ncurrency denomination of public external debt constitutes currency risk.  \n \nNevertheless, the IMF\u2019s pre-shock DSA under Article IV consultation report in 2019 and its DSA after the pandemic \nin Rapid Credit Facility report in April 2020 and in ECF report in November 2020 as well as ADB\u2019s recent DSA rate \nAfghanistan at high risk of debt distress mainly because of an expected decline of grants financing fiscal and external \ndeficits in the medium and long term. Key factors for the high risk of debt distress are (i) high dependence on donor \ngrant inflows, which finance substantial fiscal and external  deficits, (ii) the expected replacement of  grants by debt \nfinancing  over  time,  which  will  increase  the  debt  service  burden  given  the  weak  debt  carrying  and  low  revenue \ngeneration capacities, (iii) export shocks, and (iv) the fragile political and security situation.  \n \nTo facilitate transitioning of the low-income countries (including Afghanistan) to non-concessional borrowing, the IMF \nand World Bank have approved the SDFP in effect from 1 July 2020 to strengthen public debt management framework. \nThis is aligned with the IMF and the World Bank support for the implementation of the DSSI\u2014by monitoring spending, \nenhancing public debt transparency, and ensuring prudent borrowing. ADB will continue to support debt sustainability \nduring the Asian Development Fund 13 period (2021\u22122024) through additional TA for its developing member countries \nfor the implementation the SDFP. \n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nAccess Criteria \n6.
