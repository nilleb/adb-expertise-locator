THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nwithout  government  guarantee  to Columbia  Asia  Hospitals  Private  Limited  (CAH)  of  up to \nRs1,642 million ($38.6 million equivalent), to develop 10 hospitals in India. The hospitals will be \nin the cities of Bangalore (where two will be developed), Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Ghaziabad, \nGurgaon, Lucknow, Mysore, Patiala, and Pune. The 10 projects are collectively referred to as \nthe  Project.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  and  the  development  effectiveness \nframework are in Appendix 1. \nII.  BACKGROUND \n2.  Human capital is often the only asset of the poor, and its development is of fundamental \nimportance in poverty reduction.1Investment in health care is an investment in human capital \nnecessary to ensure higher productivity and efficient participation of its human resources in the \neconomy\u2019s development and growth. Adequate levels of expenditure on health care are also \nnecessary to ensure improvements in life expectancy. Econometric evidence indicates that a 5-\nyear gain in life expectancy is associated with a 0.06\u20130.58 percentage point increase in the \ngross domestic product (GDP) per capita.2\n3.  The share of public resources devoted to health care spending in India was only 1.2% \nof GDP in 2003.3 As a result, the available public health care infrastructure is overcrowded, \nlacks adequate medical equipment and resources, and is poorly managed. As resources are \nstretched, there is inadequate implementation of regulatory and monitoring systems for medical \nservices, resulting in a wide discrepancy in the quality of services provided. Improving the \nstandard of health care services in India is of vital importance to ensuring an efficient investment \nin human capital thereby ensuring economic development and a better quality of life. \nA.  Health Sector in India \n4.  India has made significant progress in improving the health conditions of its population \nand its health-related statistics have improved over the last 50 years. Since the 1960s, female \nlife expectancy has improved from 41 years in 1961 to 59 years in 1990 and 64 in 2005. Infant \nmortality rates have improved from 84 per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 56 in 2005. However, \ncompared with other countries in Asia, India lags behind. The People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC), for example, had a female life expectancy of 74 in 2005 and an infant mortality rate of \n23, and for Indonesia the estimate for female life expectancy was 70 in 2005 and for the infant \nmortality rate it was 28.  \n5.  Demand for health care services is increasing, with the economy projected to grow at \nover 8% per annum. Consumer expenditure on health is expected to increase from $43 billion in \n2006 to $92 billion by 2011.4Health care spending on a per capita basis in 2006 was $41 in \nIndia compared with an average of $226 for Asia and Australasia. Health care is gaining in \nimportance and becoming a vital driver of growth. Indicator scores in business ranking models \nput the health of the Indian workforce over the period 2002\u20132006 at 1, which is much lower than \n                                                \n1\nADB. 2004.

", "2\nthe regional average of 3.2 (footnote 4).5 For India to sustain its growth and to attract private \nand  foreign  investors,  the  productivity  of  the  workforce  has  to  improve.  A  reliable  and \nwidespread health care infrastructure is a key factor in achieving higher labor productivity. The \nexisting medical facilities and services are inadequate to meet the rising demand for health \nservices. \n6.  In India the number of hospital beds is 0.7 per thousand compared with 2.6 in the PRC \nand the global average of 3.2.6 A limited supply of health care services and infrastructure has \nprevented India from achieving better health standards and there remains significant scope for \nimprovement.  \n7.  The national epidemiological profile is changing due to economic growth, demographic \nchanges, access to health insurance, and urbanization. Economic growth is leading to an \nexpansion of the middle class, which is looking beyond the basic requirements and demands \nbetter preventive health care services. With the increase in life expectancy, the number of older \npeople in the population is also increasing. In 2001 the percentage of the population over 60 \nyears of age was 6.9%, this increased to 7.5% in 2006 and is projected to increase to 8.3% by \n2011. This section of society has greater need for medical services. It is estimated that fewer \nthan 50 million Indians have health insurance although this is expected to increase to 160 \nmillion  by  2010.  Corporations  and  other  employers  are  instituting  health  insurance  and \npreventive health care measures to improve labor productivity and working conditions for their \nemployees. Demand for health care services is also increasing given changes in lifestyles, \nespecially in an urban environment as individuals become more inclined toward preventive \nhealth care. This is reflected by an increase in the percentage of private expenditure on health, \nwhich increased from 3.5% in 1993 to 5.5% in 2000. All these factors will further increase the \nshortfall between health care services available and required. The size of the health care \nindustry is estimated to be $37.5 billion in 2007 (which was about 3.3% of the GDP) and is \nexpected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 15% over the next 5 years reaching \n$75 billion by 2012.7\n8.  Both the public and private sectors have a role to play in the delivery of health care in \nIndia; however, public expenditure on health is lower than in other developing countries and \nhence, the health care industry is dominated by the private sector. Historically, the Government \nwas the main provider of health services; however, with demand far exceeding supply of such \nservices, the private sector has been increasingly filling the gap. At present it is estimated that \nthe private sector operates 93% of all the hospitals and provides 64% of the hospital beds \nnationwide. In the absence of a significant increase in public resources for health care, public \nresources alone are inadequate for developing a satisfactory health care infrastructure. Further, \nthe scarce public health facilities are used by the high and middle income groups limiting access \nof the poor to these. \n9.  The private health care sector includes private, for-profit and non-profit, health care \nproviders. Their range of practice varies from solo practice and small nursing homes (inpatient \nfacilities with usually fewer than 30 beds) to large corporate hospitals. It is estimated that over \n                                                \n5  The business ranking model measures the attractiveness of the business environment based on ten separate \ncategories. Each category has indicators which are scored on a scale of 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good \nfor business). Health of the workforce is 1 of the 12 indicators for the labor market category and is measured on a \nquantitative basis. \n6  World Health Organization. 2007. World Health Statistics 2007. Geneva. \n7  Technopak. 2008. Ten industry trends. Health Care Outlook. Volume 4.", "3\n90% of private health care is being serviced by the unorganized sector.8 The large share of the \nunorganized and unregulated sector has implications for the quality of care provided as the \ninfrastructure is mostly substandard and attracts low-quality or untrained staff. In the absence of \na mandatory central quality protocol for health care providers, unorganized and unregulated \nhealth care units have mushroomed all over the country, especially those providing secondary \nhealth care services. \n10.  The organized sector refers to bigger hospitals with 100 or more beds which are usually \nnon-profit charitable hospitals or corporate hospitals. This size of a hospital attracts proper \nplanning  and  investments,  modern  technology  and  high-quality  staff  to  promote  optimum \nutilization of resources. Such hospitals are mostly concentrated in metropolitan centers. The \nabsence of such infrastructure in smaller towns provides a big opportunity for investment in the \nsector. Surveys on the use of health services indicate that over 80% of people use the private \nsector for outpatient curative services as a first line of treatment in both urban and rural areas \nand over 58% of the rural population prefers to undergo treatment at private hospitals. The \nprimary reasons for the shift in usage towards private health care are the inadequate availability \nof  medical  and  nonmedical  personnel  at  the  public  health  establishments,  and  archaic \ninfrastructure with obsolete or redundant technology. With few exceptions, there have been \nnegligible investments in the public health system for expansion or upgrading. \n11.  Access to high-quality health care in the private sector has been limited by the high cost \nfor the vast majority of India\u2019s population. However, this is changing and health insurance is \nbecoming a preferred tool to finance most health care expenditures. The insurance industry is \nregulated by the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA).  The IRDA has the duty \nto regulate, promote and ensure orderly growth of the insurance business and re-insurance \nbusiness. With the IRDA stipulating that 5% of insurance companies\u2019 business should be from \nthe rural sector, a slew of innovative schemes and better coverage is emerging.  Community \nhealth insurance schemes are slowly penetrating the rural market and at present there are more \nthan 25 schemes covering over 8 million people all over India.  \n12.  The health insurance companies work in conjunction with third party administrators \n(TPAs)  to  administer  health  policies.  These  are  intermediaries  that  coordinate  insurance \ncompanies and hospitals. While the insured benefit from better service, insurers benefit from a \nreduction in their administrative costs by outsourcing their management and administrative \nactivities, including settlement of claims. Both the TPAs and the insurance companies come \nunder the purview of the IRDA. Because of their large volumes of patients, the TPAs can \nnegotiate  competitive  prices  from  the  health  service  providers  and  prevent  providers  from \novercharging.9 To  some  extent,  the  existence  of  health  insurance  companies  and  TPAs \nmitigates the lack of adequate regulation and monitoring of the health care sector.  \n13.  The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India and the Indian health \nindustry  have  established  the  National  Accreditation  Board  for  Hospitals  and  Health  Care \nProviders (NABH), a constituent board of the Quality Council of India. NABH accreditation of \nfacilities confirms quality assurance and its standards focus on patient safety and the quality of \npatient care. NABH standards have been based on a comparative analysis of various aspects of \nhealth care, including the standards in Australia, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and United \nStates, which have been customized to the Indian health care setting. NABH standards also \n                                                \n8  The unorganized sector refers to nursing homes, for-profit or not-for-profit hospitals, most of which have fewer than \n30 beds. \n9  There are at present 27 TPAs registered under IRDA (as of 31 August 2007). ", "4\ninclude all the 49 applicable licenses and statutory obligations required under Indian law. The \ncost  and  timelines  incurred  in  acquiring  NABH  accreditation  are  less  than  those  of  other \ninternational accreditations. NABH is now an institutional member of the International Society for \nQuality  in  Health  Care,  an  independent  international  umbrella  health  care  accreditation \norganization which grants approval to health care accreditation bodies as a mark of equivalence \nof accreditation programs of member countries.10\nB.  Government Policies and Plans  \n14.  Given the large gap in the supply of health care infrastructure and the limited availability \nof public resources, the Government is attempting to attract private investors through investor-\nfriendly policies and tax incentives. The Government is using its own resources to focus on \ndelivery of effective and affordable health care services to the vulnerable sections of population \nresiding in rural areas through its common minimum program and national rural health mission, \nwhile encouraging the private sector to provide the health care infrastructure for urban middle- \nand high-income categories.\n15.  To promote private investment in health care and bridge the gap between supply and \ndemand, steps taken by the Government include according infrastructure status to hospitals, \npermitting 100% foreign direct investment for all health-related services, and allowing lower \ntariffs and higher depreciation on medical equipment. The Government has also amended the \nIncome Tax Act and proposed a 5-year tax holiday for new hospitals located in nonmetropolitan \nareas11 effective from April 2009. \n16.  The Government realizes the significance of the health care industry for achieving \nsustainable growth and as an important service industry and recognizes its own constraints in \nproviding adequate services. Therefore, its focus has been primarily on public health programs \nsuch as immunization programs, medical education, primary health care, and sustaining the \nexisting infrastructure. Realizing their inability to provide adequate health care infrastructure and \nservices, some state governments have recently started exploring the possibility of purchasing \nhealth insurance for below poverty families (BPL) as an alternative to its role in health care \ndelivery. This in turn will empower the less privileged classes to choose health care service \nproviders including private providers. In support of this, the federal Government announced the \nRashtriya Swasthaya Bima Yojna, a new health insurance scheme for BPL families, on 15 \nAugust 2007. About 75% of the financing is provided by the Government of India, while the \nremainder is paid by the state government. BPL families are entitled to more than 700 inpatient \nmedical procedures with a cost of up to 30,000 rupees per annum for a nominal registration fee \nof 30 rupees.  Coverage allows for pre-existing medical conditions, and there is no age limit. It is \na cashless service in case of hospitalization, and outpatient consultation is free. By 1 April 2008, \nalmost every large state government had expressed its intention of joining the scheme and \nfifteen  states  (Delhi,  Rajasthan,  Gujarat,  Haryana,  Bihar,  Uttrakhand,  Kerala,  Punjab, \nChhattisgarh,  Karnataka,  Maharashtra,  Tamil  Nadu,  Uttar  Pradesh,  West  Bengal,  and \nJharkhand) have already issued advertisements announcing the scheme. The Government\u2019s \nplans  are  in  line  with  the  long-term  objectives  of  the  CAH  initiative.  The  CAH  model  of \ndecentralized and affordable community health care has potential spin-offs for health care in \nsemi-urban and rural areas in the future.  \n                                                \n10 Joint Commission International, a well known international accreditation agency, and NABH are both members of \nthe International Society for Quality in Health Care. \n11 The excluded areas are the urban agglomerations of Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Greater Mumbai, \nHyderabad, and Kolkata, and the districts of Faridabad, Gandhinagar, Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon, \nand Secunderabad. ", "5\nC.  ADB\u2019s Operations  \n1.  ADB's Country Strategy \n17.  Private  sector  development  is  an  integral  part  of  ADB's  draft  country  partnership \nstrategy (CPS) for India for 2008\u20132012. The CPS identifies private sector investments for \nphysical  infrastructure  for  health  care.  It  encourages  greater  private  investment  by  ADB, \nparticularly as a complement to public investment in easing critical infrastructure constraints. \nThe Project will help address major health care infrastructure supply shortages by expanding \naccess to medical services of international quality to a large population across the country. \n2.  ADB's Sector Strategy \n18.  The  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB's  health  sector  policy,12 which  recognizes  the \nimportance of the private sector in health care and supports increased private provision of \nhealth care services. Assisting the health sector in developing member countries provides a \nmeans to achieve ADB's key strategic development objectives of economic growth and poverty \nreduction.  Improvements  in  health  support  economic  growth  through  (i)  increased  work \nproductivity, (ii) increased returns to investments in education, (iii) increased returns to other \nfactors  of  production,  and  (iv)  freeing  up  financial  resources  by  preventing  diseases.  It \nrecognizes that private sector interest in health care is already growing rapidly in the region and \naccounts for the majority of health expenditures. ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u2013\n2020 (Strategy 2020)13 confirms that health is vital to development, productivity, social inclusion, \nand  gender  equity  and  that  ADB  engages  in  well  defined  partnerships  with  specialized \nagencies. It also recognizes the relevance of access to affordable health care to achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals. ADB\u2019s draft operational plan for improving health access and \noutcomes under Strategy 202014 recommends health care investments when these are included \nin the CPS and are private sector operations. CAH is a private sector entity with specialized \nexperience  and  expertise  in  providing  efficient  and  high  quality  health  care  services  at \naffordable prices.  \nIII.  THE BORROWER AND THE SPONSOR \nA.  Background \n19. The Borrower.  CAH, a limited liability company owned by ICU, is incorporated in India \nunder the Companies Act, 1956 and its registered office is in the state of Karnataka, India. \nFurther to its charter, CAH is to establish, construct, maintain, develop, acquire and operate \nhospitals, dispensaries, clinics, pathological laboratories, and other associated facilities. The \nProject is a key part of its overall business.  \n20. Columbia Asia Group.  ICU also owns 99.9% of Columbia Asia Healthcare Sendirian \nBerhad (CAHM), a company incorporated in Malaysia which owns, operates, and manages its \noperations in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Viet Nam. CAH and CAHM are collectively referred to as \nthe Columbia Asia Group (CAG). CAG currently has three medical facilities in operation in India, \nfour in Malaysia, and two in Viet Nam. Its first community hospital was built and completed in \n                                                \n12 ADB. 1999. Policy for the Health Sector. Manila. \n13 ADB. 2008.

CAH  has  an  experienced  management  team \nheaded  by  Dr.  Nandakumar  Jairam,  who  has  over  30  years  of  national  and  international \nexperience. CAH also draws on the international experience of the group and three of the seven \nboard members are non-Indians closely associated with the CAG\u2019s international activity. This \nmix on the Board is an optimal blend of Indian and international expertise and knowledge of the \nindustry.\n22.  In addition to the 10 hospitals under the Project, CAH has a facility at the new airport in \nBangalore. It is a single-bed emergency center with a nurse and doctor available 24 hours all \ndays of the year and a pharmacy attached. The medical center at the airport is responsible for \nemergency medical services in the event of a disaster. CAH was selected by the developers of \nthe airport in recognition of its capacity to provide quality services and because the CAH Hebbal \nfacility is the closest hospital to the airport.   \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Project Description \n23.  The Project will establish an integrated network of medical facilities consisting of nine \nsecondary hospitals and one tertiary hospital. The Project will be a systematic implementation of \na new business model in the health care sector offering high-quality and affordable health \nservices to the middle-income category. In the absence of such projects, the middle income \ngroups would access public hospitals which would redirect health financing for the poor to the \nbetter off. The Project enables government resources to focus on the provision of health care \nneeds in rural areas and for the lower income categories. The nine secondary hospitals are \nlocated  at  Bangalore  (Hebbal),  Gurgaon,  Patiala,  Mysore,  Chandigarh,  Lucknow,  Pune, \nGhaziabad, and Ahmedabad.  \n24.  The CAH model represents a paradigm shift in the delivery of secondary care. CAH is \ninstitutionalizing the practice of secondary health care that was hitherto delivered predominantly \nin  nursing  homes.  The  CAH  model  typically  has  about  100  inpatient  beds  and  provides \nsecondary care health care services focusing on specialties such as internal medicine, surgery, \nobstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, orthopedics, and ear, nose, throat (ENT), with basic \nlaboratory and diagnostic facilities and operating theaters. Each secondary medical center will \noffer  24-hour  pharmacy  and  pathology  services.  The  secondary  hospitals  will  function  as \ncommunity hospitals and cater to a population within a radius of 10 kilometers. The tertiary \nhospital will offer outpatient consultations and specialty surgeries. It is a 160-bed multispecialty \nhospital and will focus on providing services in cardiology, neurosurgery, gastroenterology, \noncology, cardiothoracic vascular surgery, and transplants. It has high-end diagnostic facilities \nsuch as computerized tomography scanning and magnetic resonance imaging.  \n25.  The 100-bed secondary care hospital model is considered to be the optimum size for \ndelivery of a well-defined set of products and services that meet about 85% of the medical \nrequirements of any ordinary Indian family. This model can be replicated easily and optimizes \noperational  management.  A  100-bed  hospital  can  be  established  more  quickly  than  a \ncomparable  350-bed  multi-specialty  hospital,  with  lower  capital  expenditure,  without \ncompromising on the quality of services. This model is less likely to run the risk of asset ", "7\nunderutilization than a bigger facility. The hospital fits well with the image of a community or \nneighborhood hospital catering to a catchment area of 5\u201310 kilometers in radius. \n26.  Of the 10 facilities being considered under the Project, 3 have been completed and are \noperational, 2 are under construction (Mysore and Patiala), and for the other 5 land has been \nprocured and detailed designing is in various stages for the different sites. All construction will \nbe completed by July 2010 (Table 1). \nTable 1: Project Details \nConstruction \nNumber  Cost  Completion\nProject Ownership  of Floors  Beds (Rs million)  (date/status) \nHebbal, Bangalore  Land and building  B+G+1   81  218  In operation since \non lease  July 2005 \nYeshwantpur,  Land and building  B+G+4  160  564  In operation since \nBangalore  on lease  July 2008 \n(tertiary hospital) \nGurgaon  Land and  B+G+1    90  588  In operation since \nBuilding owned   July 2008 \nPatiala   Land on Lease  B+G+2   100  528  Construction ends \nBuilding owned  July 2009 \nMysore   Land and  B+G+1    84  637  Construction ends \nBuilding owned  July 2009 \nChandigarh   Land and  B+G+2   100  707  Construction ends \nBuilding owned  October 2009 \nLucknow   Land and  B+G+3   100  605  Construction ends \nBuilding owned  April 2010 \nPune   Land and  B+G+2   100  709  Construction ends \nBuilding owned   April 2010\nGhaziabad   Land and  B+G+2   100  673  Construction ends \nBuilding owned   July 2010\nAhmedabad  Land and  B+G+2   100  707  Construction ends \nBuilding owned   July 2010\n  B = basement, G = ground. \n  Source: Columbia Asia Hospitals Private Limited. \n27.  The group owns the architectural and engineering plans for its hospital models, and \nutilizes  proprietary  operating  software  and  service.  All  services  of  the  group  adhere  to \ninternational standard medical procedures and evidence-based medicine.  CAG recommends, \nwhere possible, non-invasive treatment using advanced medical technologies. This is effective \nand safe, resulting in shorter hospital stays and cost savings. CAH will also save costs by \ncentralizing  back-office  operations  such  as  accounting  and  reporting,  procurement  and \npurchasing, project management, and by using recent technology for tele-imaging. \nB.

CAH has two specialized project management teams, one for the construction of the \nnew facilities and the other for the procurement of medical equipment. Members of the project \nmanagement team have extensive experience in project and construction management. The \nconstruction contracts, including detailed designs, are tendered competitively to pre-qualified \nlocal companies, thus ensuring a competitive cost. CAH will award contracts to a single principal \ncontractor on a fixed-cost, date-certain basis, and the construction cost will have adequate \npenalties for delay.  \n30.  CAH  has  appointed  different  project  management  service  providers  for  its  various \nfacilities. The CAH team and the project management contractors (PMC) constantly monitor the \nprogress  of  work  and the  contractor  has  to  submit  weekly  updates and  monthly  progress \nreports.\n3.  Project Operational Arrangements \n31.  CAH has set up a number of committees to improve the quality of medical service.15\nThe required and applicable standard operating procedures for the entire hospital, hospital \nadministration, human resource department, intensive care unit, blood bank, and the operation \ntheater complex established for CAH were reviewed by the technical consultants and were \nfound to be NABH-compliant. The hospital management at each CAH hospital constitutes a \nteam  with  the  requisite  skill  sets  in  hospital administration,  nursing  management,  infection \ncontrol procedures, medical record management and biomedical waste disposal to oversee \nimplementation  and  compliance  with  the  requisite  standards.  This  helps  in  streamlining \nprocedures and protocols in the facility.16\n32.  The  CAH  guidelines  will  ensure  quality  of  service,  standard  pricing,  and  the  most \neffective medicine prescribed in all facilities. All the physicians and medical staff of CAH are \nrequired to follow the clinical guidelines and standard operating procedures. To cover potential \nliabilities for medical malpractice, all medical facilities as well as doctors and medical staff of \nCAH will be insured with medical malpractice insurance. The performance of all consultants will \nbe evaluated every month. Underperforming medical personnel will be referred for retraining \nand, if the problem persists, the contract will be terminated. \n33.  All the facilities of CAH are linked through a hospital management information system \nusing CAH\u2019s own software, CARE21. The hospital information system stores patients' records \nelectronically and these can be accessed at any CAH medical facility. CAH has established a \nnumber of operational targets to improve its services, e.g., on consultation time, and maintains \nrecords of its consultants\u2019 performance. These targets are also monitored regularly by the \n                                                \n15 These include a drugs committee, an intensive care unit committee, a medical practices community, a quality \nassurance and safety committee, a medical records committee, an operation theater committee, and an infection \ncontrol committee. \n16 Medical protocols refer to a set of rules followed by health care providers for a medical treatment. They include a \ntreatment plan and summarized consensus statements, and they address practical issues. Medical protocols are a \nsuperset of clinical treatment guidelines and clinical processes as they often carry the weight of law. ", "9\nsoftware. CAH will be the first medical entity in India to have a fully integrated electronic medical \nrecords and management system. \n34.  CAH has obtained NABH accreditation for its Hebbal, Bangalore hospital and is in the \nprocess of obtaining accreditation for Gurgaon and the tertiary hospital in Bangalore. Although \nNABH certification is not required, CAH plans to get all its facilities accredited and to obtain the \nrelevant certifications of the International Organization for Standardization. \nC.  Environmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n35.  The Project has been classified as category B because it is unlikely to create any \nsignificant environmental impacts during the construction and operation of the hospitals.  An \ninitial  environmental  examination  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  environmental \nassessment  requirements  of  ADB  and  its  summary  included  a  generic  environmental \nmanagement plan with mitigation measures and monitoring program.  The Project does not \nexpect to adversely affect natural resources, and the facilities are not located in or near any \necologically sensitive or cultural and/or historic sites.  A limited number of specific environmental \nimpacts resulting from project implementation are anticipated.  However, such impacts are \ntemporary  and  will  be  mitigated  by  the  Project\u2019s  environmental  management  plan \nimplementation.  The summary initial environmental examination is attached as Appendix 2. \n36.  A comprehensive program of storing, transporting, and disposing of biomedical wastes \nfor the project hospitals is in place, following international best practices and Indian rules and \nstandards  laid  down  by  the  National  Accreditation  Board  of  Hospitals  (NABH)  and  with \nclearance from the state pollution control boards (SPCBs). The audit conducted for operating \nhospitals found the program and its implementation adequate.  \n37.  The  Project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement.  Land  and/or \nbuildings required for the Project were either purchased or leased from private owners on a \nwilling-buyer/lessee-to-willing-seller/lessor basis and at prices negotiated at market rates. The \nconstruction of the hospitals will not cause any involuntary resettlement, affect any physical \nstructures, or lead to loss of livelihoods. The Project will have socioeconomic benefits, including \nproviding limited employment to people living near the hospitals. The most direct socioeconomic \nbenefit will be the smooth access to quality, reliable and affordable medical services. \n38.  The  10  hospitals  are  located  in  developed  areas  in  urban  centers.  There  are  no \nindigenous peoples living close to or within the 10 project sites; hence, the Project is classified \nas category C for indigenous people.  \nD.  Development Impacts \n1.  Impact, Outcome, and Output \n39.  The  Project  contributes  to  human  development  and  increased  productivity  of  the \nworkforce  in  India  by  improving  the  health  care  services.  The  Project  will  institutionalize \nsecondary health care based on international best practices and provide community health \nservices  at  affordable  prices.  Private  sector  provision  of  these  services  will  allow  the \nGovernment to use its limited resources for primary health care and for meeting the needs of \nlow-income categories and people living in remote rural areas that are not attractive to the \nprivate sector. The Project\u2019s output will be a network of secondary hospitals, a tertiary hospital, \nthe practice of efficient medical protocols and evidenced-based medicine and the promotion of ", "10\npreventive  health  care.  The  Project  will  raise  the  standards  for  the  healthcare  industry, \nimplement a new business model of low cost, high quality health care which in future can be \nreplicated in semi-urban and rural areas, and create employment opportunities and train local \nmedical personnel in international best practice. Corporatization of hospital care supported by \nthis Project will indirectly assist in strengthening self regulation of quality of care, support \ndeepening of insurance markets, and in accelerating public-private partnerships in the sector. \nThe Project\u2019s design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.\n2.  Development Effectiveness \n40.  The development effectiveness of the Project will be assessed in terms of private sector \ndevelopment,  business  success,  and  economic  sustainability  as  per  the  guidelines  for \nimplementing  the  Good  Practice  Standards  for  Evaluation  of  Private  Sector  Investment \nOperations,17 prepared by the Evaluation Cooperation Group of the multilateral development \nbanks. The Project will lead to the development of high-quality health care services in the \nprivate sector and will set an international quality standard for other private sector operators. \nCatastrophic hospital expenditures are one of the main reasons for households regressing into \npoverty due to the poor penetration of health insurance. One of the main barriers to deepening \nof health insurance markets is the high level of fragmentation of hospital care segment and \nweak institutional support. The Project, by accelerating the corporatization of hospital care will \nassist in deepening of health insurance markets in India, and indirectly assist in reducing the \nincidence of poverty. Corporatization of hospital care can also assist in new forms of public-\nprivate partnerships and lead to outsourcing of health care by the government to the private \nsector. Corporate hospitals can train more paramedical and nursing staff in high quality health \ncare  services.  The  Project  is  financially  and  economically  sustainable,  and  adopts \nenvironmentally sound operational and waste disposal practices. The Project\u2019s development \neffectiveness framework is provided in Appendix 1. \nV.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \nA.  Loan \n41.  ADB will provide a local currency loan of up to Rs1,642 million from its ordinary capital \nresources without a government guarantee. Proceeds from the loan will be used for eligible \nexpenditures by CAH for the purposes of one tertiary and nine secondary hospitals in India.. \nB.  Justification for ADB's Assistance \n42.  ADB's assistance for the Project is justified for the following reasons: \n(i)  The proposed loan is consistent with ADB\u2019s draft country partnership strategy \n(CPS) 2008\u20132012 for India, which emphasizes private sector participation in \nphysical  infrastructure  development.  The  CPS  recommends  public\u2013private \npartnerships  for  the  health  sector  and  underscores  that  private  sector \ndevelopment is an integral part of ADB's strategy in the country.  \n(ii)  Developing the private health care infrastructure and services for the middle-\nincome category releases public resources for policy and regulatory work and \nallows public resources to focus better on the needs of the rural and poorer \n                                                \n17  Multilateral Development Banks Evaluation Cooperation Group. 2006. Good Practice Standards for Evaluation of \nPrivate Sector Investment Operations \u2013 Third Edition.", "11\nsections  of  society.  India\u2019s  middle-income  group  is  growing  rapidly  and  its \ndemand  for  health  care  services  is  expanding.  Public  sector  resources  are \nstretched  and  committed  to  the  minimum  needs  program  for  delivering \naffordable  health  services  to  the  vulnerable sections  of  the  population.  The \nProject will support private sector investment for the development of quality and \naffordable health care services in India for the middle-income population, freeing \npublic resources for treatment of the poor. \n(iii)  Private health care development has so far focused on tertiary health care. The \nprovision of institutionalized secondary health care is relatively new in India. The \npresence of ADB has catalyzed financing in this transaction among local banks. \nAvailability of long-term fixed-interest rate credit will increase the stability of the \nProject\u2019s  financing  plan,  reduce  its  financing  uncertainty,  and  ultimately \ncontribute to providing affordable health care services. \n(iv)  The Project is consistent with ADB's paper Policy for the Health Sector, 18 which \npromotes the private provision of hospital services. It is also consistent with the \ncurrent draft of An Operational Plan for Improving Health Access and Outcomes \nunder Strategy 2020.\n(v)  The proposed loan addresses the short supply of affordable and high-quality \nhealth care services to the middle-income class in India. This will lead to an \nimprovement  in  the  productivity  of  the  workforce  and  reduce  incidence  of \nmorbidity.\n(vi)  The Project will contribute to sustainable economic growth in India by expanding \naccess to international standard medical services and improving the productivity \nand quality of the workforce. Improved health and productivity of the workforce \nthrough  the  provision  of  modern  medical  services  will  accelerate  efficient \neconomic growth and also induce foreign direct investment. The Project will \nindirectly contribute to poverty reduction through economic growth. \n(vii)  ADB's  participation  in  the  Project  will  demonstrate  that  commercially  viable \nprivate  health  care  projects  can  be  undertaken  through  long-term  project \nfinance. The Project\u2019s successful implementation will provide a new business \nmodel for India and other developing member countries.  \n(viii)  The Project is expected to be the source of best practices for the industry by \ninstituting professional health care, management and training. The Project will be \na showcase of modern medical practices and will therefore have a beneficial \neffect  on  the  entire  health  sector  and  raise  the  overall  standard  of  medical \npractice in India. \n(ix)  The Project will provide employment for over 5,600 staff by the end of its third \nyear of operation, and will help train local medical staff as per international \nstandards,  thus  increasing  the  supply  of  highly-qualified  local  medical \nprofessionals.\n(x)  ADB\u2019s participation in the Project will ensure that it is implemented with due \nconsideration for safeguard aspects (especially environmental), there are well \ndesigned countermeasures for any adverse impacts, and such measures are \nproperly implemented and monitored.  \nC.

Introduction \n1.  Columbia Asia Hospitals Private Limited (CAH) a subsidiary of Columbia Asia Group \n(CAG)1 has requested support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the development and \noperation of 10 hospitals in India (the Project).  The tertiary2 hospital is located at Yeshwantpur in \nBangalore while the nine secondary3hospitals are located at Hebbal in Bangalore, Gurgaon, \nPatiala, Mysore, Chandigarh, Lucknow, Pune, Ghaziabad, and Ahmedabad. This aims to provide \naffordable international standard health care to the growing middle-income class of India by \ndelivering quality health care service.\n2.  CAH carried out an environmental analysis as part of the market, financial and operational \ndue diligence of the Project through a consultant, Technopak Advisors Private Limited for the 10 \noperational and upcoming hospitals. Environmental due diligence also included a detailed waste \nmanagement practice study in one operational secondary hospital through consultant EPTRI and \nan initial environmental examination (IEE) through a staff consultant for the tertiary hospital. In \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines \n(2003),  this  summary  initial  environment  examination  (SIEE)  is  prepared  in  line  with  the \nenvironmental assessment requirements for environmental category B4 project. The SIEE covers \nthe general assessment of the anticipated environmental impacts of the Project in consideration of \ncommon design criteria, performance standards and guidelines, general and specific features \nsuch as environmental, social and economic settings, permitting requirements and status, and the \nenvironmental and waste management practices of the operational and upcoming CAH hospitals.  \nA generic environmental management plan (EMP) for the Project was also prepared, based on \nthe IEE for the tertiary hospital at Brigades Gateway, Yeshwantpur, Bangalore, Karnataka State, \nin which impacts and appropriate mitigating measures were identified.   \n3.  A comprehensive program of storing, transporting, and disposing of biomedical wastes for \nthe  project  hospitals  is  in  place,  following  international  best  practices  and  Indian  rules  and \nstandards laid down by the National Accreditation Board of Hospitals (NABH) and with clearances \nfrom the state pollution control boards (SPCB).  The audit conducted for operating hospitals found \nthe program and its implementation to be adequate.5\n4.  The Project does not expect to adversely affect natural resources, and the facilities are not \nlocated in or near any ecologically sensitive or cultural and/or historic sites.  A limited number of \nspecific environmental impacts resulting from project implementation are anticipated.  However, \n                                                \n1  Columbia Asia Group (CAG) is a regional health care company with medical centers in Malaysia, Viet Nam, \nIndonesia, and India providing multispecialty health care facilities including out patient and inpatient services. \n2   A  tertiary  health  care  hospital  provides  multispecialty  services  in  cardiology,  neurosurgery,  gastroenterology, \noncology, cardiothoracic vascular surgery and transplants and has high end diagnostic facilities like computerized \ntomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging. \n3  A secondary health care hospital provides services focusing on specialties like medicine, surgery, obstetrics and \ngynecology, pediatrics, orthopaedics, and ear nose throat (ENT), with basic laboratory and diagnostic facilities and \noperating theaters. \n4  A project is classified as category B if its potential adverse environmental impacts on human populations or \nenvironmentally sensitive areas are less adverse than those of category A projects. \n5\n The audit was carried out at the hospital in Hebbal to: (i) assess existing systems and processes; (ii) determine \ncompliance level as per standards prescribed by the hospital management; (iii) benchmark existing standards and \nprocesses with national level quality guidelines and best practices; and (iv) recommend corrective and preventive \nactions to streamline and improve the processes. The methodology included direct observations of process flows, \npatient flows, departments and facility as a whole, mapping of systems and processes with NABH standards by \nmeans of a checklist, interviews of staff, patients and visitors, and analysis of documents.", "18 Appendix 2\nsuch impacts are temporary and will be avoided or mitigated by adhering to the Project\u2019s EMP \nimplementation.  \nB.  Project Description \n1.  Project Components \n5.  The Project will establish an integrated network of medical facilities consisting of a tertiary \nhospital and nine secondary hospitals. Three of these are operational and seven are in various \nstages of design and construction.

Forthcoming hospitals will follow the typical CAH secondary model design: (i) 100 inpatient \nbeds;  (ii)  secondary  care  multispecialty  hospital  focusing  on  specialties  such  as  medicine, \nsurgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, pediatrics, orthopaedics, ear nose throat (ENT) with basic \nlaboratory and diagnostic facilities; (iii) internationally accepted standard policies and procedures; \n(iv) proprietary operating software and electronic medical records; (v) unique, modern and efficient \ndesign and; (vi) modern medical equipment. These hospitals are in various stages of design and \nconstruction and are being planned to follow the same design and operational benchmarks as the \nexisting facilities.", "Appendix 2          19\n2.  Status of Compliance with Environmental Laws and Regulations \n7.  The environmental clearances and environmentally related permits have been issued for \nCAH\u2019s operational hospitals and are being processed and/or will be obtained for the forthcoming \nhospitals from the respective State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs).  Environmentally related \npermits include the Consent for Establishment (CFE), the Consent for Operation (CFO), the \nannual Water Consent as per the Water Pollution Control and Prevention Act, 1974 and Air \nConsent  as  per  the  Air  Pollution  Control  and  Prevention  Act  1981,  and  the  No  Objection \nCertificate (NOC) as per Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) notified Biomedical Waste \nManagement and Handling Rules, 1998. \n3.  Biomedical Waste and Liquid Wastes Management Practices  \n8.  The biomedical wastes generated at CAH operational facilities are collected, segregated, \nstored  and  disposed  off  at  a  common  biomedical  waste  treatment  facility.  The  operational \nhospitals at Hebbal and Yeshwantpur outsource biomedical waste management services to M/s \nSembRamky Environmental Management, an authorized agency by Karnataka State Pollution \nControl Board, while the hospital at Gurgaon outsources services to Vulcan Waste Management \nCompany.  \n9.  A detailed waste management study was carried out for the hospital in Hebbal to assess \nits waste management practices and environmental measures. The hospital  follows the MoEF \nnotified  Biomedical  Waste  Management  and  Handling  Rules, 1998  with  respect  to  waste \nsegregation, collection, following the color coding norms for collecting different categories of \nwaste and usage of symbols on the collection containers, internal transportation and storing of the \nwaste. The hospital separates the infectious waste from the noninfectious waste and the waste is \ncollected in color-coded bags by housekeeping in three shifts; morning, afternoon, and evening or \nas  required  when  a  waste  bin  or  sharps  bin  is  75%  full.  Mobile  garbage  bins  are  used. \nHousekeeping staff wear heavy duty gloves, masks and rubber boots while collecting waste. The \nquantities of waste generated per day are presented in Table A2.2. \nTable A2.2: Daily Waste Generation at Hospital in Hebbal \nQuantity of \nwaste generated \nColor Container Category  /day \n(in kilograms) \nBlue Blue plastic  Tubing\u2019s, catheters, IV tubes, blood bags,  57\nInfectious (Non  bag in plastic  drains, gloves, aprons and endotracheal \nbiodegradable)  bin tubes\nRed Red plastic  Cotton, gauze, bandages, plaster,  46\nInfectious bag in plastic  dressing.\n(Biodegradable) bin\nYellow Yellow Human tissues, organs, body parts,  3\n(Organ and  plastic bag in  placenta, pathological and surgical waste, \ntissue waste)  plastic bin  microbiology and biotechnology waste \nBlack  Black bag in  General paper waste; and also kitchen  40\nplastic bin  waste, that is disposed separately. \nIV = intravenous. \nSource: Due Diligence Report, Technopak Advisors Private Limited, 2008. \n10.  The biomedical wastes are weighed and stored in the airconditioned waste holding room \nbefore  they  are  taken by  the  contracted  agency  for  treatment  and  disposal  at the  common ", "20 Appendix 2\nbiomedical waste treatment facility. The segregation and disposal of biomedical waste is recorded \nand log books are maintained on a day to day basis. \n11.  The hospital has a biomedical waste management protocol with trained staff in hospital \nwaste management.  A maintenance engineer, with mechanical engineering background looks \nafter the overall biomedical waste management and other environmental aspects. The practice for \nthe biomedical waste disposal conforms with the prescribed requirements and the biomedical \nwaste management protocol. \n12.  The liquid wastes generated from the hospital wards and the sewage from cafeteria and \ntoilets are combined and treated in a sewage treatment plant. The total quantity of wastewater \nentering the facility is 39 kiloliters per day (KLD); 31 KLD of domestic wastewater and 8 KLD of \nchemical wastewater from different wards. The treated water is reused for gardening within the \npremises. CAH follows a typical design for its hospitals, replicating the liquid waste management \nand design of the sewage treatment plant. \nC.  Description of the Environment \n13.

A specific description of the existing environmental conditions is provided below for the \ntertiary  hospital  in  Yeshwantpur,  Bangalore.  Although  these  conditions  are  specific  to \nYeshwantpur, the urban setting in which the facility is located can be considered general to all \nproject hospitals.   ", "Appendix 2          23\na.  Topography, Soil and Land Use \n25.  The hospital site is relatively flat and sparsely covered with trees and vegetation. The soil \nis generally red with yellow clayey silty sand down to a depth of 5 meters (m) followed by silty \nsand strata which is highly disintegrated rock down to a depth of 10 m reaching stable strata.   \n26.  The present land use pattern in the immediate surroundings of the project site is a mixture \nof commercial and residential areas with very little or no farming activities. \nb.  Climate \n27.  The mean monthly wind speed values for a 4-year period during 2000\u20132003 recorded at \nthe India Meteorological Department (IMD) station at Bangalore showed that the highest wind \nspeed of 9.8 kilometers per hour (km/hr) was recorded in June 2001 and lowest at 2.9 km/hr in \nOctober 2000. In the middle months of the year the prevailing wind direction is westerly, while it is \neasterly in the remaining months, which are influenced by the southwest and northeast monsoon, \nrespectively.\n28.  The site in Bangalore has an equitable temperature regime. The  hottest months are \nMarch, April and May, with monthly mean maximum temperatures ranging from 32.4 degrees \ncentigrade (0C) to 32.70C followed by a perceptible drop of nearly 4.50C in the month of June, \nsignaling the onset of monsoon season. The monthly mean temperatures for these months are in \nthe  range  260C\u201327.50C.  The  coolest  month  is  December  with  mean  maximum  temperature \nbetween 160C.\n29.  Average annual rainfall in Bangalore over the 30-year period from 1951 to 1980 is 970 \nmillimeters (mm), with 60 days of rainfall. The wettest months are September and October, while \nthe driest period is between January and March. In recent years the city received significantly less \naverage rainfall, e.g., 767 mm in 2002 and 727 mm in 2003. \nc.  Air Quality \n30.  There are no industries near the hospital site. The source of air pollution can be attributed \nto the movement of vehicles. Records of ambient air quality within a 3-km radius from the project \nsite indicate that values of suspended particulate matter ranging from 50 micrograms per cubic \nmeter (\u00b5g/m3) to 150 \u00b5g/m3, sulfur dioxide from 7 to 23 \u00b5g/m3, and oxides of nitrogen from 4.5 to \n23.5 \u00b5g/m3are within the National Ambient Air Quality Monitoring standards prescribed by Central \nPollution Control Board.6\nd.  Noise Level \n31.  Data on the ambient noise levels gathered from the 10 locations near the hospital site \nindicate a high value due to considerable human, commercial and vehicular activities in the \nsurrounding areas. The day-time maximum noise levels around the project site range from 57.80 \ndecibels, (dB(A)) to 97.90 dB(A). Noise levels at the project site are in the range of 58.7 dB(A) to \n60.6 dB(A).7\n                                                \n6  Based on Environment (Protection) Rules (1986), ambient air standards for residential, rural and other areas are 140 - \n200 microgram per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m3) for suspended particulate matter (SPM) and 60\u201380 \u00b5g/m3 for both sulfur \ndioxide (SO ) and oxides of nitrogen (NO ).\n2 2\n7 Based on Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules (2000), noise limits for residential areas are 55 dB(A) for day \ntime (6:00 am to 10:00 pm) and 45 dB(A) for night time (10:00 pm to 6:00 am). ", "24 Appendix 2\ne.  Water Quality \n32.  There are no significant surface water bodies in the vicinity, except the Sankey Tank and \nthe Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) open sewer (Arkavathy valley) which \nare  at  some  distance  from  the  hospital  site.  Groundwater  around  the  hospital  site  has  no \nobjectionable odor, has good taste and color, and is within the permissible limit of 5 Hazen units \nprescribed for potable water. The maximum total dissolved solids (TDS) levels are in the range of \n850 to 950 milligrams per liter (mg/L) and nitrate levels are in the range of 100 to116 mg/L8.\n3.  Biological Environment  \n33.  The hospital site and immediate surroundings have been thoroughly urbanized. Habitats \nfor flora and fauna are very limited due to the intensive commercial and residential development. \nNo wildlife sanctuary or game reserve is located in the vicinity of the study area.  \n34.  The  hospital  area  has  no  vegetation  cover  and/or  forest  lands  nor  environmentally \nsensitive or protected areas.   \n4.  Socioeconomic Environment \n35.  The population is considered totally urban with no farming or agricultural activities of \ncommercial scale. Education facilities such as colleges and technical training institutes are well \nestablished. Telecommunication, power, water supply and transportation facilities are available \nand adequate.  \n36.  There are no settlements or residences at the hospital site. Therefore, no resettlement is \nrequired.\n37.  No archaeological, historical and religious sites exist in the hospital area. No indigenous \ngroup of people was identified. \nD.  Anticipated Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n38.  An  assessment  of  the  potential  environmental  impacts  and  identification  of  mitigating \nmeasures  was  carried  out  for  the  tertiary  hospital  in  Yeshwantpur  to  prepare  a  generic \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) for the all project hospitals.  \n39.  There are no significant differences in the potential impacts and mitigation measures of the \ndifferent hospitals, nor between the tertiary and the secondary hospitals. The anticipated impacts \nand mitigation measures are considered relevant and are essentially the same, if of larger scale, \nfor the remaining project hospitals.  The key environmental issues associated with the hospitals \nand impacts on various environmental components and the appropriate mitigating measures have \nbeen assessed for construction and operational phases. \n1.  Impacts during construction \n40.  The Project will build hospitals, including facilities such as the water system and sewage \ntreatment plants. The construction activities would create the environmental disturbance normally \n                                                \n8  Based on Drinking Water Quality Standards (IS:10500) the permissible limit for total dissolved solids (TDS) is 2,000 \nmilligrams per liter (mg/L) and for nitrate 100 mg/L as NO .\n3", "Appendix 2          25\nassociated  with  major  construction  works,  such  as  dust,  noise,  exhaust  emissions  from \nconstruction equipment and vehicles, and waste generation. As construction will be confined to \nthe hospital compound and there are no nearby settlements, the impacts of such environmental \ndisturbances will be insignificant. The Project and its Contractors will comply with applicable \ngovernment environmental legislative requirements.\n41.  Dust  generated  during  construction  is  expected  to  have  some  impact  on  air  quality. \nHowever, this will be mitigated by regular spraying paths of heavy vehicles with water, and \ncontrolling  the  speed  and  limiting  movement  of  construction  equipment  and  vehicles.  All \nequipment and vehicles will undergo routine maintenance to reduce engine emissions. Vehicles \ntransporting construction materials will be covered with tarpaulin to avoid spills. \n42.  Noise will be generated during construction. Construction activities will be planned to avoid \nnoisy operations. Efforts will be made to limit the sound of powered mechanical equipment such \nas bulldozers, air compressors, concrete pumps, excavators, and concrete mixers. Protective \ndevices will be provided to workers to minimize the effects of high noise levels.  Specific mitigation \nmeasures and appropriate techniques for the control of noise will include (i) siting fixed pieces of \nequipment, such as generators, away from settlements; (ii) fitting pneumatic tools operated near \nsettlements  with  effective  air  exhaust  ports;  (iii)  fixing  noise  labels  to  air  compressors;  \n(iv) maintaining noise suppression devices on construction vehicles and equipment; (v) notifying \nlandowners  of  intended  work  and  duration  if  noise  from  construction  activities  is  likely,  and  \n(vi) considering construction works schedules to mitigate noise emission impacts during the day \nand night time. \n43.  Solid wastes generated during construction include trash and scrap metal (which will be \nreused and recycled if possible). During the peak of the construction phase, laborers will be \nemployed  locally  and  temporary  construction  camps  will  be  established.  Sewage  from \nconstruction camps and wastewater from the contractor\u2019s workshop and equipment washing yard \nwill be generated. Labor camps will be provided with adequate sanitation infrastructure and \namenities. Sewer drains will lead to an onsite disposal area for treatment or holding in septic tanks \nwith leach fields. \n2.  Impacts during Operations \na.  Air and Noise Quality \n44.  One source of likely air pollution will be the operation of diesel generators.  To reduce \npollution, the fuel to be used for the diesel generators will have a low sulfur content (less than \n0.05%) and diesel generators will be used during emergencies and power shortages only. The \nexpected emission of SO  and particulate matters will be mitigated by installing an exhaust \n2\nchimney with height to be prescribed by respective State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs). \n45.  The noise impact on the surrounding areas because of the commissioning of the hospital \nwill be insignificant. The diesel generators will be the only major noise generating sources in the \nproject hospitals. Adequate precautions will be taken to prevent noise and vibration at the source \nby proper acoustic treatment, anti-vibration mountings, and acoustic enclosure to keep noise \nlevels within the stipulated limits.9\n                                                \n9Based on Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules (2000), noise limits for silence zone, e.g., hospital are 50 \ndB(A) for day time (6:00 am\u201310:00 pm) and 40 dB(A) for night time (10:00 pm\u20136:00 am). ", "26 Appendix 2\nb.  Water and Wastewater Quality \n46.  Potable water will be sourced from local water companies and from existing bore wells \nwithin the hospital site. The water requirement of 10,000 liters (10 m3) per day will not have a \nsevere impact on groundwater resource (such as depletion or subsidence). \n47.  The wastewater to be generated from the wards, kitchen, cafeteria, toilets, and other parts \nof the hospital will be combined and treated in an onsite sewage treatment plant.  The treated \nwater will be reused for gardening within the hospital premises. \n48.  The sewage treatment plant will conduct primary and secondary treatment with an aeration \nsystem followed by filtration through pressure sand filters and an activated carbon column and \nfinally with chlorination. Rooftop rain water harvesting, coupled with storm water harvesting and \nimpoundment in an artificially created water body, will help to recharge the groundwater table near \nthe hospital.                                                                                                                                                             \nc.  Terrestrial Environment \n49.  No major impacts on the terrestrial environment are anticipated. Each tree that is cut to \ngive way for the development of the forthcoming hospitals will be replaced by planting a minimum \nof two trees or saplings. A green belt along the periphery of the hospital sites will be implemented \nto enhance the aesthetics at the same time as a measure to reduce air and noise pollution.  \n50.  To avoid soil or land contamination, the general standards prescribed for treated effluents \nfor discharging on land for irrigation10 will be met before they are reused on land for lawns, \ngardening, and plantations.  \nd.  Biomedical and Domestic Waste Management \n51.  The process of biomedical waste management in India has been well established under \nthe Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) Biomedical Management and Handling Rules \n1998.  The guidelines required all health care establishments to undertake the proper method of \nsegregation, storage, treatment and disposal. The types of containers, color coding and the labels \nto be used for segregation and storage are defined in the guidelines. The sources of hospital \nwastes include the emergency room, pharmacy, laboratory, day care, operation theater, dialysis \nsection, and radiology division. Infectious and noninfectious wastes must be segregated and \nplaced  in  color  coded  bags  properly  labeled  and  stored  in  the  waste  holding  room  before \ncollection, treatment, and disposal to a common biomedical waste treatment facility. The waste \nholding room must have proper storage and temperature control facilities. Wastes should be\nstored at 4oC in the holding room in case they have to be stored for more than 48 hours before \ncollection for final treatment and disposal by waste management firms. There are specialized \nwaste management firms in all states, registered with SPCBs. These have to collect and process \nwaste for disposal at government-approved sites as a precondition for establishing any hospital \nand as part of the environment clearance process. These rules will be strictly followed by the \nproject hospital management. This ensures that the impacts and risks will be minimal, and will be \nstrictly monitored.\n                                                \n10 Standards for treated effluents for discharging on land for irrigation (plantation) per IS 2490 are as follows: (i) color \nand odor = remove as far as practicable; (ii) suspended solids, milligrams per liter (mg/L) = 200; (iii) pH = 5.5 to 9.0; \n(iv) Oil and Grease, mg/L = 10; (v) biochemical oxygen demand, mg/L = 100; (vi) arsenic (as As), mg/L = 0.2; (vii) \ncyanide (as Cn), mg/L = 0.2; (viii) alfa emitters, millicurie per milliliter = 10-8; (ix) beta emitters microcurie/milliliter =10-7\nand (x) bioassay test = 90% survival of fish after 96 hours in 100% effluent. ", "Appendix 2          27\n52.  Domestic waste generated by the hospital staff and patients will be collected separately \nfrom  the  biomedical  waste.  It  will  be  collected  by  municipal  waste  corporations  for  further \ntreatment and final disposal. \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan \n1.  Environmental Management Plan \n53.  The Project\u2019s environmental management plan (EMP) is formulated as a generic one that \ncan be applicable to all project hospitals.  CAH has committed to update the EMP as part of the \nIEEs for the remaining project hospitals and the environmental clearance process.  CAH will \nprovide adequate staff and budget to ensure EMP implementation in the project hospitals. ADB \nwill review the IEEs, including the site-specific EMPs, of the remaining hospitals when available.     \n54.  The generic EMP commits CAH to manage and mitigate the environmental impacts of the \nproject hospitals. It provides the actions to be undertaken during the preconstruction, construction, \nand operation phases as well as the responsible entities for implementation (in Appendix 1 of the \nEMP).\n55.  Environmental  monitoring  will  be  undertaken.  All  project  hospitals  will  have  a  mini-\nlaboratory exclusively for regular monitoring and testing of the quality of the treated wastewater to \nensure that it is suitable for reuse for plantation. The mini-laboratory will handle basic parameters \nsuch as pH, total suspended solids, dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and \nbiochemical oxygen demand (BOD).  \n56.  All project hospitals will have a maintenance engineer with a mechanical engineering \nbackground who will look after the overall biomedical waste management and other environmental \naspects. The engineer will also carry out the periodic monitoring of the emissions from the \nchimneys, ensure the smooth operation of the sewage treatment plant, and prepare reports that \nare statutory requirements of the respective SPCBs. Annual environmental monitoring reports will \nbe submitted to ADB. \nF.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n57.  CAH  undertook  a  comprehensive  market  and  feasibility  study,  including  informal \ndiscussions with officials of the major cities, before deciding on the location of the hospitals. \nProject sites are either part of property development that has been ongoing for several years, are \npart of an overall town planning exercise, or are on industrial estates sold by the government to \nprivate developers.  \n58.  The  hospital  in  Yeshwantpur  is  inside  a  self-contained  integrated  township,  Brigades \nGateway, under a lease agreement with Brigade Enterprises. Public consultation was carried out \nas part of the township development phase and it included discussion on social services that \nwould be provided as part of the complex, including health facilities such as a hospital. Township \nresidents have expressed strong support for the hospital as it would generate employment and \ncontribute to local and regional economic development by ensuring a healthy workforce. \nG.  Findings and Recommendations \n59.  A comprehensive program of storing, transporting, and disposing of biomedical wastes for \nthe project hospitals is in place, following international best practices and Indian standards, laid \ndown  by  the  National  Accreditation  Board  of  Hospitals  (NABH),  with  clearances  from  the ", "28 Appendix 2\nrespective State Pollution Control Boards.  The audit conducted on the three operating hospitals \nfound the program and its implementation adequate.  \n60.  The biomedical waste management guidelines as stipulated and required by MoEF will be \nstrictly followed by management  in each hospital. All biomedical wastes generated will be sent to \na  common  biomedical  waste  treatment  and  disposal  facility  operated  by  a  private  agency \napproved by the respective SPCBs.\n61.  No  significant  environmental  impacts  are  expected  during  construction  and  operation \nbecause of the nature of the Project and the hospitals\u2019 location. The generic EMP to mitigate \npotential environmental impacts, including air and water quality, has been prepared and will be \nupdated if necessary, and will be strictly implemented during the construction and operation \nphases of each project hospital.  \nH.  Conclusion \n62.  The  Project  will  support  private  sector  investment  in  the  development  of  quality  and \naffordable health care services in India for the urban middle-income categories. \n63.  The Project\u2019s potential environmental impacts can be mitigated effectively provided the \nmitigating measures are implemented properly. The maintenance engineer designated by the \nProject will oversee and monitor all environmental activities. The engineer will ensure that national \nand local regulatory requirements (on air, water quality and biomedical waste management) are \nproperly handled and complied with.  \n64.  The IEE suffices as the environmental assessment of the Project. Potential environmental \nimpacts are well understood. The Project\u2019s environmental management plan isa generic one that \ncan be applied to all project hospitals.  CAH has committed to update the generic EMP as part of \nthe IEEs for the remaining project hospitals and the environmental clearance process.  CAH will \nprovide adequate staff and budget to ensure EMP implementation in the Project hospitals. ADB \nwill review the IEEs, including the site-specific EMPs of the remaining Project hospitals when they \nbecome available. No further environmental investigation is necessary.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describe how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the\npartner country. \nIn 2002, roughly two thirds of the 15,393 hospitals in India were public. After years of underfunding, most public health \nfacilities are inefficient, inadequately managed and staffed, have poorly maintained medical equipment, and provide only \nbasic care. ADB's draft country partnership strategy for India (2008\u20132012) confirmed ADB's support for private sector \ndevelopment of infrastructure, which includes health care.a The Project will support private sector investment in quality and \naffordable health care services in India, especially for the middle-income population. This will free public sector resources for\nthe treatment of the poor. The Project is consistent with the Government of India\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan, which aims to \nenhance the contribution of the private sector to the provision of primary, secondary, and tertiary services, including through\npartnership with the government. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  General intervention\n1. Key Issues\nThe Project will provide international quality secondary health care services to the middle-income group and raise standards \nof the health care industry. This will allow the Government to use its limited resources to provide health care services for the\nlower-income categories.  \n2. Design Features.   The Project is the development and operation of 10 hospitals (9 secondary and 1 tertiary) by Columbia \nAsia Hospitals (CAH). \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending\n1. Discuss the impact channels of the policy reform(s) (direct and indirect, short and medium term) to the country and major \ngroups affected.   N/A \n2. Discuss the impact of the policy reform(s) on vulnerable groups and ways to address it/them.  N/A \n3. Discuss how the policy reform(s) contribute(s) to poverty reduction, pro-poor growth, and the MDGs. N/A \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nThe Project will indirectly improve the socioeconomic condition of key cities in India where the CAH hospitals are located by \ngenerating jobs for qualified medical staff, leading to improved health standards, life expectancy, and infant mortality rates.\nWith respect to land requirements for the hospitals, all hospitals will either be constructed on land owned by the company or \nleased from private landowners.  For example, the proposed 120-bed Bangalore Brigades Gateway hospital will lease about \n1.5 ha of land inside the 16.9 hectares (ha) of the Brigades Gateway complex owned by Brigade Enterprises Pvt. Ltd.  No \narchaeological, historical and religious sites exist in the project areas. No indigenous peoples were identified among the local\npopulations. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing  Consultation   Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n2.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes  No  If a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to \nimplement the plan (including budget, consultant input, etc.). If no, explain why.  \nThe project sponsor undertook a comprehensive market and feasibility study, including informal discussions with the officials \nof the major cities before deciding on the location of the hospitals. For the Bangalore Brigades Gateway Hospital, public \nconsultation was carried out as part of the township development phase. This included a discussion on the social services \nthat would be provided as part of the complex, including health facilities such as a hospital. Township residents have \nexpressed  strong  support  for  the  hospital  as  it  would  generate  jobs  and  contribute  to  local  and  regional  economic \ndevelopment by ensuring a healthy workforce.
