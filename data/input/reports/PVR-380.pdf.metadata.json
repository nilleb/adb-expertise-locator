The  increase  in  the  prices  of  steel, \ncement,  pipes,  and  petroleum  products  increased  the  overall  construction  cost  of  the  water \nsupply  infrastructure.  Whereas,  climate-related  occurrences  limited  the  use  of  water  sources \nlocated  near  the  villages,  resulting  in  the  need  to  connect  to  distant  water  sources. \nConsequently,  this  increased  the  scale  and  cost  of  the  subprojects,  and  ultimately  made  the \ntotal available funding insufficient to meet the original targets of the loan-funded project.  \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n1  The  project  completion  report  (PCR)  could  have  commented  on  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  being  eligible  for  a  100% \n\nAsian Development Fund grant financing for 2007\u20132008 and tapping a grant in lieu of a loan. \n\n2  ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to the Kyrgyz \n\nRepublic for the Community-Based Infrastructure Services Sector Project (Supplementary).

These  indicators  are \nreflected  in  the  RRP\u2019s  design  and  monitoring  framework  (DMF)  as  an  additional  indicator, \n\u201cpublic  satisfaction  with  the  availability,  quality,  and  quantity  of  water  is  increased.\u201d  Some \nindicators  may  be  more  appropriate  at  the  project  outcome  level.  The  use  of  perception  or \nbeneficiary satisfaction rate is deemed a weak indicator and should only be a support indicator. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nThe  DMFs  of  the  RRP  and  the  project  completion  report  (PCR)  stated  the  expected \noutcome  to  be  \u201csafe,  adequate,  and  efficient  water  supply  and  sanitation  services.\u201d3  The \nfollowing  performance  indicators  and  targets  were  to  be  achieved  by  2012:  (i)  environmental \ndegradation  controlled  and  natural  resources  appropriately  tapped  in  200  villages  to  meet \ncommunity  demand;  (ii)  water  supply  and  sanitation  assets  strengthened  and  community  fully \ninvolved  in  operating  and  maintaining  the  subprojects;  and  (iii)  service  delivery  improved \nthrough adequate supply and better quality of water.   \n \n4. \nThe  identified  indicators  were  qualitative  and  difficult  to  assess.  The  outcome  and \npurpose-level  indicator\u2014strengthened  water  supply  and  sanitation  assets  and  full  community \ninvolvement in operating and maintaining the subprojects by 2012\u2014was similar to the output 2 \nindicator, which was that communities would undertake preventive maintenance of systems. \n \nD. \n \nThe  outputs  per  the  RRP\u2019s  DMF  are:  (i)  output  1\u2014rehabilitated  and  newly  constructed \n5. \nwater supply and sanitation systems in project villages; (ii) output 2\u2014water supply systems and \ntariff collection managed by communities to recover cost; and (iii) output 3\u2014government-issued \nsector development policy and legal and regulatory framework for rural water asset creation and \nservice delivery. The supplementary grant was to cover 122 subprojects (not covered under the \nloan project) in about 200 villages with a total population of about 300,000. Sanitation was to be \nan integral part of each subproject (RRP, para. 14 [i]). Other than these, the indicators were not \nobjectively verifiable\u2014for instance, output 1 had no breakdown in the number of subprojects to \nrehabilitate or construct. \n \nE. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  at  loan  closing  was  $9.8  million  or  26%  of  the  total  estimated \n6. \nproject cost of $37.5 million. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) was to provide $30.0 million \nas  grant,  but  only  $8.16  million  was  disbursed  while  the  unused  grant  of  $21.84  million  was \ncanceled  on  3  June  2013.  Of  the  government\u2019s  estimated  share  of  $6.15  million,  only  $1.39 \nmillion (23%) was expended while the beneficiaries\u2019 contribution amounted to $0.28 million out \nof  the  estimated  $1.35  million.  Before  the  cancellation,  project  implementation  and  grant \ndisbursements  were  suspended  in  June  2012  because  of  the  findings  of  ADB\u2019s  Office  of \nAnticorruption  and  Integrity  review.  The  review  identified  project  implementation  weaknesses \n\nProvision of Inputs \n\nOutputs  \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n3\u00a0\u00a0 ADB.  2014.  Completion  Report:  Community-Based  Infrastructure  Services  Sector  Project  (Supplementary)  in  the \n\nKyrgyz Republic. Manila. \n\n\f3\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nduring  2009\u20132012:  the executing  agency  was  changed  three  times,  the  project  had  difficulties \nfollowing  procurement  and  disbursement  procedures,  and  procurement  irregularities  resulted \nfrom poorly managed and supervised project activities.  \n \nF. \n \n7. \nProject  implementation  arrangements  were  modified  to  include  (i)  the  changes  in  the \nexecuting agency from the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources, and Processing Industry to \nthe Department of Rural Water Supply, with the latter involving rural water supply professionals \nfrom its oblast (province); and (ii) the mandatory involvement of the ayil okmotu (village council) \nto provide back-up support to community unions for drinking water users. Technical consultants \nwere appointed to ensure third party quality assurance and provide overall support to the project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU).  A  project  steering  committee  was  established  in  February  2009  to \nselect subprojects and monitor the institutional development program, among others. A project \ncoordination  committee  was  established  in  2009  but  the  committee  never  met  due  to  the \nrestructuring of the government. A joint project management unit established in 2008 managed \nthe  project  at  the  central  government  level,  especially  to  implement  rural  water  supply  and \nsanitation  (WSS)  projects.  Project  implementation  units  established  at  the  oblasts  during  the \nloan  project  supervised  the  subprojects.  During  the  3.5-year  implementation,  the  executing \nagency  was  changed  four  times,  to  the  Department  of  Rural  Water  Supply,  the  Ministry  of \nNatural Resources, the State Committee on Water Melioration, and the Community Investment \nand Development Agency (ARIS). The project director was also changed three times.  \n \n8. \nOf the 26 grant covenants, the government failed to comply with 12 covenants, partially \ncomplied  with  7  covenants,  and  fully  complied  with  5;  while  2  covenants  were  not  applicable. \nNoncompliance resulted from poor project administration and financial management such as (i) \nfrequent changes in the executing agency; (ii) the nonfunctional project coordination committee; \n(iii)  problems  associated  with  bid  evaluation  and  contract  awards;  (iv)  failure  to  submit  initial \nenvironmental examinations, environmental management plans, and environmental clearances \non time;4 (v) failure to comply with ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (PCR, para. 18, and Appendix 8) \nand  incorporate  its  relevant  clauses  in  the  contract  documents;  and  (vi)  failure  to  establish  a \nproject  performance  monitoring  system.  The  government  also  failed  to  issue  a  sector \ndevelopment  policy,  and  a  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  creating  rural  water  assets  and \ndelivering services. \n \n9. \nThree  consulting  services  packages  were  included  under  the  project:  (i)  technical \ndesign,  (ii)  national  consultant  for  technical  supervision,  and  (iii)  national  consultant  for \ncommunity  mobilization.  The  project  hired  consultants  for  technical  design,  community \nmobilization,  and  hygiene  and  sanitation  education.  No  firm  was  hired  for  construction \nsupervision. \n\nII. \n\nEVALUATION OF PERFORMANCE AND RATINGS \n\nA. \n\nRelevance of Design and Formulation \n\n10. \nThe PCR rated the project less than relevant. On alignment with ADB and government \nstrategies,  the  PCR  emphasized  that  at  project  completion,  the  grant  renewed  focus  on  water \nsupply  and  sanitation.  As  such,  both  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  medium-term  development  plan \n2012\u20132014  and  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  2013\u20132017  explicitly  supported  WSS. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n4\u00a0\u00a0 The project was classified as environmental category\u00a0B.\u00a0\n\n\f\u00a04\n\nHowever, the PCR stated that at project inception, there was no enabling environment such that \n(i) no rural WSS policy was in place; and (ii) a legal and regulatory framework for community-\nbased WSS service provision was unsuitable and weak. \n \nThis  validation  notes  conflicting  circumstances  against  which  the  project  is  being  rated \n11. \nless  than  relevant.  In  particular,  the  PCR  stated  that  the  project  was  conceived  without  the \nnecessary  policy  environment,  but  the  project  design  tried  to  rectify  this  by  including  as  an \nintervention the development of a policy, and a legal and regulatory framework for rural WSS. \nThus,  as  designed,  the  project  would  have  addressed  the  unsupportive  policy  environment \nissue; however, no resources were allocated for the component (PCR, para. 27).  \n \n12. \nOn  relevance  of  design,  approach  (modalities),  and  responsiveness  to  identified \ndevelopment  problem,  this  validation  is  inclined  to  comment  that  using  a  grant  to  finance \ninfrastructure  projects  may  not  be  an  appropriate  modality  as  the  proponent  agency  will  not \nhave the incentive to ensure the efficient use of funds. However, the loan project had likewise \nnot delivered its intended outputs, which indicates that the mode of financing had no impact on \nproject  outcomes.  The  main  shortcoming  in  the  design  of  the  supplementary  grant  was  the \ninadequate funds allocated to each subproject. \n\n \n13. \nGiven  that  the  cost  of  the  average  subprojects  under  the  loan  project  was  already \n$437,000 during implementation, it is not clear why the average cost for the grant subprojects \nwas estimated to be $290,000.   \n \n14. \nThe  second  design  issue  was  risk  mitigation.  Three  sources  of  risk  were  identified  at \nappraisal:  PMU  capacity,  selection  of  contractors,  and  community  participation.  Mitigation \nmeasures were also identified to address these risks such as further strengthening of the PMU \nand  the  project  implementation  unit,  stringent  criteria  for  prequalification  of  contractors, \nimproved guidelines for involving communities in identifying and selecting water sources and in \nimplementing  the  project  to  ensure  ownership.  These  risks  proved  to  hinder  project \nmanagement and progress.  \n \n15. \nThis  validation  agrees  that  project  implementation  arrangements  were  weak  mainly \nbecause the project had retained the old PMU that was responsible for nondelivery of outcomes \nand outputs of the loan project. The supplementary nature of the grant project would also have \nprohibited  a  stringent  assessment  of  the  soundness  of  the  implementation  arrangements \nbecause  of  an  overlap  in  the  implementation  period.  The  grant  was  made  effective  on  19 \nDecember 2008 while the loan was still ongoing with a completion date of 30 April 2009 and a \nloan closing date of 27 January 2010. The PCR noted that lessons derived from the loan project \nwere  dealt  with  in  the  design  of  the  grant  project  but  focus  was  on  the  subproject  (local \nimplementation). No mention was made on the thoroughness of assessing the implementation \narrangement particularly on overall project management, which was tagged as the root cause of \nmismanagement. Quality at entry was poor and was not rectified during implementation.  \n \nThis validation rates the project less than relevant because the following design failures \n16. \nwere  repeated  under  the  loan  to  which  the  grant  was  supplementary:  (i)  use  of  similar \nimplementation arrangements as the loan project with no major changes proposed,                (ii) \nunderestimation of costs, and (iii) insufficient measures to mitigate the impact of known risks. \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\f5\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nEffectiveness in Achieving Project Outcome and Outputs \n\nB. \n \n17. \nThe PCR rated the project ineffective. This validation agrees with the PCR\u2019s rating. The \nproject  aimed  to  deliver  nine  output  indicators  under  the  three  main  components  (Table  1). \nBased  on  the  PCR\u2019s  DMF,  only  one  output  was  delivered\u2014the  provision  of  tools  and \nmaintenance equipment to communities. One output was marginally achieved\u2014the provision of \ncontinuous  potable  water  supply.  Of  the  122  target  subprojects  in  200  villages  to  benefit  a \npopulation  of  300,000,  only  12  subprojects  were  rehabilitated,  benefiting  55,000  people  in  33 \nvillages, roughly 10% of the target facilities and 18% of the target population. Even in these 33 \nvillages,  the  water  supplied  was  not  safe,  adequate,  or  efficient.  The  remaining  seven \nsubprojects\u2014which  were  deemed  to  be  interventions  to  ensure  sustainability  (communities \ncapacitated  to  manage  water  supply  and  the  policy  environment)\u2014were  not  achieved.  The \nsanitation  component,  which  was  requested  by  the  beneficiaries  who  were  already  having \ndifficulty  collecting  contributions  for  the  subprojects,  which  included  sanitation\u2014was  not \nimplemented (PCR, para. 17). \n \n\nTable 1: Summary of Indicators \n\nOutcome Level \n\nProject purpose/outcome \n   Total Output \nOutput 1  \nOutput 2 \nOutput 3 \nSource: ADB Independent Evaluation Department. \n\nTotal \nIndicators \n3 \n9 \n3 \n3 \n3 \n\nAchieved/ \nSubstantial \n \n1 \n1 \n \n \n\nPartial/ \nMarginal \n2 \n1 \n1 \n \n \n\nNot  \nAchieved \n1 \n7 \n1 \n3 \n3 \n\nEfficiency of Resource Use in Achieving Outcomes and Outputs \n\n \nC. \n \n18. \nThe PCR rated the project inefficient based on the project\u2019s wastage of resources. The \nvalue of the achievements was less than the resources used\u2014the project used roughly 26% of \nits $37.5 million estimated cost to deliver 10% of the target facilities, and reached only 18% of \nthe  target  population  with  a  recomputed  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  that  was  less \nthan appraised. This validation agrees with the PCR rating.  \n \n19. \nProcess  efficiency.  The  PCR  noted  multiple  procurement  issues,  including  (i)  the \nprocurement of 12 civil works contracts, 7 of which were found to be consistent with collusive or \ncorrupt  procurement;  and  (ii)  PMU  noncompliance  with  ADB  procurement  process  and \nguidelines  (for  example,  in  using  national  competitive  bidding  despite  ADB  advice  to  use \ninternational competitive bidding for contract costs estimated at more than $1 million), resulting \nin  misprocurement  (PCR,  para.  52).  On  implementation  arrangements,  the  frequent  change in \nexecuting  agency  and  management  resulted  in  changes  to  critical  decisions  made  by  the \nprevious executing agency, delaying the project (PCR, para. 43). By 2011, the project faced an \nincreasing  number  of  implementation  issues,  including  cost  overruns,  weak  administration, \nsubstandard work, irregularities in procurement, poor performance of contractors, and integrity \nissues (PCR, para. 6). \n \n20. \nResource-use efficiency. The recalculated EIRR for four subprojects ranged from 1.2% \nto 21.2%, which the PCR noted to be significantly lower than the appraisal estimates of 26.6% \nto  33.9%.  The  PCR  emphasized  that  the  low  EIRRs  are  for  subprojects  with  significant  cost \nescalation  and  high  capital  costs.  The  subprojects  with  higher  EIRRs  capital  costs  that  were \n\n\f\u00a06\n\nPreliminary Assessment of Sustainability \n\ndeemed more reasonable. In quality, review missions and beneficiaries noted deficiencies in the \nconstruction  of  civil  works  and  in  the  quality  of  materials  provided.  The  fielding  of  the  design \nconsultants  was  ill-timed,  resulting  in  the  non-tendering  and  waste  of  already  prepared \ndocuments and subprojects design. At completion, 26% of the project budget was expanded but \nonly about 10% of project outputs were completed. This validation rates project implementation \ninefficient. \n \nD. \n \n21. \nThe  PCR  assessed  sustainability  less  than  likely.  This  validation  deems  components \nand/or outputs 2 and 3 to be the interventions that would ensure sustainability, as the output of \n\u201ccommunities  capacitated  to  manage  water  supply  and  the  policy,  legal  and  regulatory \nenvironment\u201d  was  not  achieved.  The  PCR  stated  that  tariff  collections  were  not  sufficient, \nranging  from  only  40%  to  60%  against  the  target  of  80%.  Outputs  were  reported  to  be  either \npartially  operating  or  unlikely  sustainable.  The  subprojects  in  Bujum  and  Orto  Azia  showed \npositive  results.  In  summary,  this  validation  notes  that  the  project  lacked  the  following:  (i) \ngovernment  or  executing  agency  commitment  and  capacity  to  provide  the  needed  operational \nand  recurrent  funds  and  human  resources  after  project  completion,  including  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  costs;  (ii)  cost  recovery  through  income  generation,  particularly  for \ninvestment projects relating to nonpublic goods; (iii) clear O&M policy, capacity, and practices in \nimplementing agencies; and (iv) commitment to carry out needed policy reforms to sustain the \nbenefits. Based on these considerations, this validation rates the project benefits less than likely \nsustainable. \n \nE. \n \n22. \nThe  PCR  assessed  the  project  impact  negligible  given  the  extent  of  coverage  at  only \n10% of the rehabilitation target. This validation agrees with the PCR\u2019s rating and notes that the \nPCR  did  not  cite  the  source  of  information  pertaining  to  the  impact  of  the  12  completed \nsubprojects on the living conditions of the beneficiaries (PCR, para. 61). \n \n23. \nAn  unintended  outcome  mentioned  in  the  rationale  section  of  the  PCR  is  the  renewed \nfocus  on  water  supply  and  sanitation,  following  the  problems  or  issues  encountered  by  the \nproject. This has resulted in both the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s medium-term development plan 2012\u2013\n2014 and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy 2013\u20132017 explicitly supporting WSS. \n \n\n Impact \n\nIII. \n\nOTHER PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS  \n\nPerformance of the Borrower and Executing Agency \n\n \nA. \n \n24. \nThe  PCR  rated  the  performance  of  the  borrower  and  executing  agency  unsatisfactory, \nciting  issues  relating  to  project  management,  integrity,  procurement,  delays,  complying  with \nADB  procedures,  complying  with  covenants,  and  ignoring  ADB  advice.  This  validation  agrees \nwith the unsatisfactory rating. However, this validation finds the PCR lacking in the borrower\u2019s \npoint of view even if this does not improve the rating. \n \nB. \n \nThe  PCR  rated  ADB\u2019s  performance  satisfactory.  From  the  review  of  mission  reports, \n25. \nADB  efforts  to  address  the  problems  faced  were  consistent,  holding  weekly  supervision \nmeetings, field technical reviews of subprojects, and the pivotal action to involve ADB\u2019s Office of \nAnticorruption  and  Integrity  team,  following  disagreements  with  the  PMU  and  the  executing \n\nPerformance of the Asian Development Bank \n\n\f7\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nagency  on  procurement-related  activities.  This  validation  found  that  ADB  took  some  time  to \ninvestigate the procurement issues. In the overall analysis, ADB\u2019s efforts during implementation \nwere not enough to overcome major design issues, which stemmed from retaining the original \nPMU and the grant recipient\u2019s lack of ownership of the project interventions. Consequently, the \nproject did not succeed overall largely because the performance of the preceding loan-funded \nproject  was  weak.  Lessons  from  the  preceding  project  were  not  adequately  learned  and \nmistakes were repeated. This validation rates ADB performance less than satisfactory. \n \n\nIV. \n\nOVERALL ASSESSMENT, LESSONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nOverall assessment and Ratings \n\n \nA. \n \nThe project was rated unsuccessful.

In this light, ADB may devise an action plan or a matrix of \nfollow-up actions, identifying the responsible entities and timelines. This validation agrees with \nthe  recommendations  for  further  action  or  follow-up,  and  especially  for  the  government  to         \n(i)  provide  funds  to  rectify  the  deficiencies  of  the  subprojects,  including  leaking  pipes,  broken \ntaps  of  stand  pipes,  and  water  treatment  units;  and  (ii)  reform  the  WSS  sector  by  adopting  a \nWSS policy, and revise institutional, regulatory, and legal frameworks. \n \n\nV. \n\nOTHER CONSIDERATIONS AND FOLLOW-UP \n\nComments on Project Completion Report Quality \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation, and Utilization  \n\n \nA. \n \n31. \nThere  was  no  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  at  the  onset  as  the  RRP  did  not \nindicate  any  system,  except  for  the  DMF.  On  the  other  hand,  the  DMF  did  not  sufficiently \nidentify the indicators that were supposed to be monitored. \n \nB. \n \nThis validation finds the PCR diligent in supporting its claims, and rates the quality of the \n32. \nPCR satisfactory. The PCR is clearly written and the logical flow, leading to the lessons learned \nand recommendations, is easy to follow. However, this validation finds the report lacking in the \nborrower\u2019s  point  of  view  on  significant  issues  such  as  project  management,  non-allocation  of \nfunds for critical activities, and the lack of data source for the stated project impact. \n \nC. \n \nApart  from  the  PCR,  the  RRP  and  mission  reports  were  available  and  used  for  this \n33. \nvalidation. This validation also benefited from the PCR of the Community-Based Infrastructure \nServices Sector Project in the Kyrgyz Republic.  \n \nD. \n \n34. \nAs  the  project  was  canceled  in  June  2013  and  no  additional  activity  is  envisaged,  the \nproject  performance  evaluation  report  could  be  conducted  any  time.  Despite  the  limited \nachievements of the supplementary project, much can be learned about preparing a follow-on \nproject  to  an  unsuccessful  project,  such  as  that  a  follow-on  project  should  not  be  avoided  but \nwill need special arrangements.     \n\nRecommendation for Independent Evaluation Department Follow-Up \n\nData Sources for Validation \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n5\u00a0\u00a0 The  PCR  of  the  preceding  project  (ADB.  2010.
