PROJECT DESCRIPTION \nA.  Rationale \n \n1.  This supplementary grant1 was needed to address the funding gap for the Community-\nBased Infrastructure Services Sector Project, which had stemmed from significant issues, such \nas price increases in critical project inputs, climate changes, and droughts, as explained in the \nreport  and  recommendation  of  the  President2  (RRP).  The  increase  in  the  prices  of  steel, \ncement, pipes, and petroleum products increased the overall construction cost of the water \nsupply infrastructure. Whereas, climate-related occurrences limited the use of water sources \nlocated  near  the  villages,  resulting  in  the  need  to  connect  to  distant  water  sources. \nConsequently, this increased the scale and cost of the subprojects, and ultimately made the \ntotal available funding insufficient to meet the original targets of the loan-funded project.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n1  The project completion report (PCR) could have commented on the Kyrgyz Republic being eligible for a 100% \nAsian Development Fund grant financing for 2007\u20132008 and tapping a grant in lieu of a loan. \n2  ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to the Kyrgyz \nRepublic for the Community-Based Infrastructure Services Sector Project (Supplementary). Manila. \n\u00a0", "2 \u00a0\nB.  Expected Impact \n \n2.  The RRP stated that it has as both project impact and outcome the improvement of \npublic health and environment in project villages, namely: (i) increased coverage of safe water \nfrom 32% of the population to 100%; and (ii) reduced incidence of waterborne diseases, from \n30% of the population to 5% over the project period (RRP, para. 6). These indicators are \nreflected in the RRP\u2019s design and monitoring framework (DMF) as an additional indicator, \n\u201cpublic  satisfaction  with  the  availability,  quality,  and  quantity  of  water  is  increased.\u201d  Some \nindicators may be more appropriate at the project outcome level. The use of perception or \nbeneficiary satisfaction rate is deemed a weak indicator and should only be a support indicator. \n \nC.  Objectives or Expected Outcomes \n \n3.  The DMFs of the RRP and the project completion report (PCR) stated the expected \noutcome  to  be  \u201csafe,  adequate,  and  efficient  water  supply  and  sanitation  services.\u201d3  The \nfollowing performance indicators and targets were to be achieved by 2012: (i) environmental \ndegradation  controlled  and  natural  resources  appropriately  tapped  in  200  villages  to  meet \ncommunity demand; (ii) water supply and sanitation assets strengthened and community fully \ninvolved  in  operating  and  maintaining  the  subprojects;  and  (iii)  service  delivery  improved \nthrough adequate supply and better quality of water.   \n \n4.  The  identified  indicators  were  qualitative  and  difficult  to  assess.  The  outcome  and \npurpose-level indicator\u2014strengthened water supply and sanitation assets and full community \ninvolvement in operating and maintaining the subprojects by 2012\u2014was similar to the output 2 \nindicator, which was that communities would undertake preventive maintenance of systems. \n \nD.  Outputs  \n \n5.  The outputs per the RRP\u2019s DMF are: (i) output 1\u2014rehabilitated and newly constructed \nwater supply and sanitation systems in project villages; (ii) output 2\u2014water supply systems and \ntariff collection managed by communities to recover cost; and (iii) output 3\u2014government-issued \nsector development policy and legal and regulatory framework for rural water asset creation and \nservice delivery. The supplementary grant was to cover 122 subprojects (not covered under the \nloan project) in about 200 villages with a total population of about 300,000. Sanitation was to be \nan integral part of each subproject (RRP, para. 14 [i]). Other than these, the indicators were not \nobjectively verifiable\u2014for instance, output 1 had no breakdown in the number of subprojects to \nrehabilitate or construct. \n \nE.  Provision of Inputs \n \n6.  The total project cost at loan closing was $9.8 million or 26% of the total estimated \nproject cost of $37.5 million. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) was to provide $30.0 million \nas grant, but only $8.16 million was disbursed while the unused grant of $21.84 million was \ncanceled on 3 June 2013. Of the government\u2019s estimated share of $6.15 million, only $1.39 \nmillion (23%) was expended while the beneficiaries\u2019 contribution amounted to $0.28 million out \nof  the  estimated  $1.35  million.  Before  the  cancellation,  project  implementation  and  grant \ndisbursements  were  suspended  in  June  2012  because  of  the  findings  of  ADB\u2019s  Office  of \nAnticorruption and Integrity review. The review identified project implementation weaknesses \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n3\u00a0\u00a0ADB. 2014. Completion Report: Community-Based Infrastructure Services Sector Project (Supplementary) in the \nKyrgyz Republic. Manila. ", "3\u00a0\n\u00a0\nduring 2009\u20132012: the executing agency was changed three times, the project had difficulties \nfollowing procurement and disbursement procedures, and procurement irregularities resulted \nfrom poorly managed and supervised project activities.  \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n7.  Project implementation arrangements were modified to include (i) the changes in the \nexecuting agency from the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources, and Processing Industry to \nthe Department of Rural Water Supply, with the latter involving rural water supply professionals \nfrom its oblast (province); and (ii) the mandatory involvement of the ayil okmotu (village council) \nto provide back-up support to community unions for drinking water users. Technical consultants \nwere appointed to ensure third party quality assurance and provide overall support to the project \nmanagement unit (PMU). A project steering committee was established in February 2009 to \nselect subprojects and monitor the institutional development program, among others. A project \ncoordination  committee  was  established  in  2009  but  the  committee  never  met  due  to  the \nrestructuring of the government. A joint project management unit established in 2008 managed \nthe project at the central government level, especially to implement rural water supply and \nsanitation (WSS) projects. Project implementation units established at the oblasts during the \nloan project supervised the subprojects. During the 3.5-year implementation, the executing \nagency was changed four times, to the Department of Rural Water Supply, the Ministry of \nNatural Resources, the State Committee on Water Melioration, and the Community Investment \nand Development Agency (ARIS). The project director was also changed three times.  \n \n8.  Of the 26 grant covenants, the government failed to comply with 12 covenants, partially \ncomplied with 7 covenants, and fully complied with 5; while 2 covenants were not applicable. \nNoncompliance resulted from poor project administration and financial management such as (i) \nfrequent changes in the executing agency; (ii) the nonfunctional project coordination committee; \n(iii) problems associated with bid evaluation and contract awards; (iv) failure to submit initial \nenvironmental examinations, environmental management plans, and environmental clearances \non time;4 (v) failure to comply with ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (PCR, para. 18, and Appendix 8) \nand incorporate its relevant clauses in the contract documents; and (vi) failure to establish a \nproject  performance  monitoring  system.  The  government  also  failed  to  issue  a  sector \ndevelopment policy, and a legal and regulatory framework for creating rural water assets and \ndelivering services. \n \n9.  Three  consulting  services  packages  were  included  under  the  project:  (i)  technical \ndesign,  (ii)  national  consultant  for  technical  supervision,  and  (iii)  national  consultant  for \ncommunity  mobilization.  The  project  hired  consultants  for  technical  design,  community \nmobilization,  and  hygiene  and  sanitation  education.  No  firm  was  hired  for  construction \nsupervision. \nII.  EVALUATION OF PERFORMANCE AND RATINGS \nA.  Relevance of Design and Formulation \n10.  The PCR rated the project less than relevant. On alignment with ADB and government \nstrategies, the PCR emphasized that at project completion, the grant renewed focus on water \nsupply and sanitation. As such, both the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s medium-term development plan \n2012\u20132014  and  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  2013\u20132017  explicitly  supported  WSS. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n4\u00a0\u00a0The project was classified as environmental category\u00a0B.\u00a0", "4 \u00a0\nHowever, the PCR stated that at project inception, there was no enabling environment such that \n(i) no rural WSS policy was in place; and (ii) a legal and regulatory framework for community-\nbased WSS service provision was unsuitable and weak. \n \n11.  This validation notes conflicting circumstances against which the project is being rated \nless than relevant. In particular, the PCR stated that the project was conceived without the \nnecessary policy environment, but the project design tried to rectify this by including as an \nintervention the development of a policy, and a legal and regulatory framework for rural WSS. \nThus, as designed, the project would have addressed the unsupportive policy environment \nissue; however, no resources were allocated for the component (PCR, para. 27).  \n \n12.  On  relevance  of  design,  approach  (modalities),  and  responsiveness  to  identified \ndevelopment  problem,  this  validation  is inclined  to  comment  that  using  a  grant  to  finance \ninfrastructure projects may not be an appropriate modality as the proponent agency will not \nhave the incentive to ensure the efficient use of funds. However, the loan project had likewise \nnot delivered its intended outputs, which indicates that the mode of financing had no impact on \nproject outcomes. The main shortcoming in the design of the supplementary grant was the \ninadequate funds allocated to each subproject. \n \n13.  Given that the cost of the average subprojects under the loan project was already \n$437,000 during implementation, it is not clear why the average cost for the grant subprojects \nwas estimated to be $290,000.   \n \n14.  The second design issue was risk mitigation. Three sources of risk were identified at \nappraisal:  PMU  capacity,  selection  of  contractors,  and  community  participation.  Mitigation \nmeasures were also identified to address these risks such as further strengthening of the PMU \nand  the  project  implementation  unit,  stringent  criteria  for  prequalification  of  contractors, \nimproved guidelines for involving communities in identifying and selecting water sources and in \nimplementing  the  project  to  ensure  ownership.  These  risks  proved  to  hinder  project \nmanagement and progress.  \n \n15.  This  validation  agrees  that  project  implementation  arrangements  were  weak  mainly \nbecause the project had retained the old PMU that was responsible for nondelivery of outcomes \nand outputs of the loan project. The supplementary nature of the grant project would also have \nprohibited  a  stringent  assessment  of  the  soundness  of  the  implementation  arrangements \nbecause of an overlap in the implementation period. The grant was made effective on 19 \nDecember 2008 while the loan was still ongoing with a completion date of 30 April 2009 and a \nloan closing date of 27 January 2010. The PCR noted that lessons derived from the loan project \nwere dealt with in the design of the grant project but focus was on the subproject (local \nimplementation). No mention was made on the thoroughness of assessing the implementation \narrangement particularly on overall project management, which was tagged as the root cause of \nmismanagement. Quality at entry was poor and was not rectified during implementation.  \n \n16.  This validation rates the project less than relevant because the following design failures \nwere  repeated  under  the  loan  to  which  the  grant  was  supplementary:  (i)  use  of  similar \nimplementation arrangements as the loan project with no major changes proposed,                (ii) \nunderestimation of costs, and (iii) insufficient measures to mitigate the impact of known risks. \n \n \n \n ", "5\u00a0\n\u00a0\nB.  Effectiveness in Achieving Project Outcome and Outputs \n \n17.  The PCR rated the project ineffective. This validation agrees with the PCR\u2019s rating. The \nproject aimed to deliver nine output indicators under the three main components (Table 1). \nBased  on  the  PCR\u2019s  DMF,  only  one  output  was  delivered\u2014the  provision  of  tools  and \nmaintenance equipment to communities. One output was marginally achieved\u2014the provision of \ncontinuous potable water supply. Of the 122 target subprojects in 200 villages to benefit a \npopulation of 300,000, only 12 subprojects were rehabilitated, benefiting 55,000 people in 33 \nvillages, roughly 10% of the target facilities and 18% of the target population. Even in these 33 \nvillages,  the  water  supplied  was  not  safe,  adequate,  or  efficient.  The  remaining  seven \nsubprojects\u2014which were deemed to be interventions to ensure sustainability (communities \ncapacitated to manage water supply and the policy environment)\u2014were not achieved. The \nsanitation component, which was requested by the beneficiaries who were already having \ndifficulty  collecting  contributions  for  the  subprojects,  which  included  sanitation\u2014was  not \nimplemented (PCR, para. 17). \n \nTable 1: Summary of Indicators \nTotal  Achieved/  Partial/  Not  \nOutcome Level \nIndicators  Substantial  Marginal  Achieved \nProject purpose/outcome  3    2  1 \n   Total Output  9  1  1  7 \nOutput 1   3  1  1  1 \nOutput 2  3      3 \nOutput 3  3      3 \nSource: ADB Independent Evaluation Department. \n \nC.  Efficiency of Resource Use in Achieving Outcomes and Outputs \n \n18.  The PCR rated the project inefficient based on the project\u2019s wastage of resources. The \nvalue of the achievements was less than the resources used\u2014the project used roughly 26% of \nits $37.5 million estimated cost to deliver 10% of the target facilities, and reached only 18% of \nthe target population with a recomputed economic internal rate of return (EIRR) that was less \nthan appraised. This validation agrees with the PCR rating.  \n \n19.  Process  efficiency.  The  PCR  noted  multiple  procurement  issues,  including  (i)  the \nprocurement of 12 civil works contracts, 7 of which were found to be consistent with collusive or \ncorrupt  procurement;  and  (ii)  PMU  noncompliance  with  ADB  procurement  process  and \nguidelines  (for  example,  in  using  national  competitive  bidding  despite  ADB  advice  to  use \ninternational competitive bidding for contract costs estimated at more than $1 million), resulting \nin misprocurement (PCR, para. 52). On implementation arrangements, the frequent change in \nexecuting  agency  and  management  resulted  in  changes  to  critical  decisions  made  by  the \nprevious executing agency, delaying the project (PCR, para. 43). By 2011, the project faced an \nincreasing  number  of  implementation  issues,  including  cost  overruns,  weak  administration, \nsubstandard work, irregularities in procurement, poor performance of contractors, and integrity \nissues (PCR, para. 6). \n \n20.  Resource-use efficiency. The recalculated EIRR for four subprojects ranged from 1.2% \nto 21.2%, which the PCR noted to be significantly lower than the appraisal estimates of 26.6% \nto 33.9%. The PCR emphasized that the low EIRRs are for subprojects with significant cost \nescalation and high capital costs. The subprojects with higher EIRRs capital costs that were ", "6 \u00a0\ndeemed more reasonable. In quality, review missions and beneficiaries noted deficiencies in the \nconstruction of civil works and in the quality of materials provided. The fielding of the design \nconsultants  was  ill-timed,  resulting  in  the  non-tendering  and  waste  of  already  prepared \ndocuments and subprojects design. At completion, 26% of the project budget was expanded but \nonly about 10% of project outputs were completed. This validation rates project implementation \ninefficient. \n \nD.  Preliminary Assessment of Sustainability \n \n21.  The PCR assessed sustainability less than likely. This validation deems components \nand/or outputs 2 and 3 to be the interventions that would ensure sustainability, as the output of \n\u201ccommunities  capacitated  to  manage  water  supply  and  the  policy,  legal  and  regulatory \nenvironment\u201d  was  not  achieved.  The  PCR  stated  that  tariff  collections  were  not  sufficient, \nranging from only 40% to 60% against the target of 80%. Outputs were reported to be either \npartially operating or unlikely sustainable. The subprojects in Bujum and Orto Azia showed \npositive results. In summary, this validation notes that the project lacked the following: (i) \ngovernment or executing agency commitment and capacity to provide the needed operational \nand recurrent funds and human resources after project completion, including operation and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  costs;  (ii)  cost  recovery  through  income  generation,  particularly  for \ninvestment projects relating to nonpublic goods; (iii) clear O&M policy, capacity, and practices in \nimplementing agencies; and (iv) commitment to carry out needed policy reforms to sustain the \nbenefits. Based on these considerations, this validation rates the project benefits less than likely \nsustainable. \n \nE.   Impact \n \n22.  The PCR assessed the project impact negligible given the extent of coverage at only \n10% of the rehabilitation target. This validation agrees with the PCR\u2019s rating and notes that the \nPCR  did  not  cite  the  source  of  information  pertaining  to  the  impact  of  the  12  completed \nsubprojects on the living conditions of the beneficiaries (PCR, para. 61). \n \n23.  An unintended outcome mentioned in the rationale section of the PCR is the renewed \nfocus on water supply and sanitation, following the problems or issues encountered by the \nproject. This has resulted in both the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s medium-term development plan 2012\u2013\n2014 and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy 2013\u20132017 explicitly supporting WSS. \n \nIII.  OTHER PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS  \n \nA.  Performance of the Borrower and Executing Agency \n \n24.  The PCR rated the performance of the borrower and executing agency unsatisfactory, \nciting issues relating to project management, integrity, procurement, delays, complying with \nADB procedures, complying with covenants, and ignoring ADB advice. This validation agrees \nwith the unsatisfactory rating. However, this validation finds the PCR lacking in the borrower\u2019s \npoint of view even if this does not improve the rating. \n \nB.  Performance of the Asian Development Bank \n \n25.  The PCR rated ADB\u2019s performance satisfactory. From the review of mission reports, \nADB  efforts  to  address  the  problems  faced  were  consistent,  holding  weekly  supervision \nmeetings, field technical reviews of subprojects, and the pivotal action to involve ADB\u2019s Office of \nAnticorruption and Integrity team, following disagreements with the PMU and the executing ", "7\u00a0\n\u00a0\nagency on procurement-related activities. This validation found that ADB took some time to \ninvestigate the procurement issues. In the overall analysis, ADB\u2019s efforts during implementation \nwere not enough to overcome major design issues, which stemmed from retaining the original \nPMU and the grant recipient\u2019s lack of ownership of the project interventions. Consequently, the \nproject did not succeed overall largely because the performance of the preceding loan-funded \nproject  was  weak.  Lessons  from  the  preceding  project  were  not  adequately  learned  and \nmistakes were repeated. This validation rates ADB performance less than satisfactory. \n \nIV.

The performance of the supplementary grant was lower in comparison with the original \nloan project despite both projects having the same objective of providing \u201csafe, adequate, and \nefficient water supply and sanitation services.\u201d In the validation, the loan project was rated \nrelevant,  less  effective,  less  efficient,  and  likely  sustainable  for  an  overall  rating  of  partly \nsuccessful, while this validation rates the supplementary grant unsuccessful.

Lessons \n \n28.  This validation agrees with the following PCR lessons: (i) the government must first \ndemonstrate its commitment and ownership by creating an enabling environment for delivering \nsustainable outputs before engaging in poorly performing sectors; (ii) at appraisal, the root \ncauses and identification of innovative solutions of past project implementation issues should be \nthoroughly reviewed; (iii) due diligence should not be sacrificed for the urgency of additional ", "9\u00a0\n\u00a0\nfinancing; the government must ensure that sufficient resources cover the scope of the project; \n(iv)  resources  should  be  allocated  for  additional  support  to  strengthen  areas  where \nimplementation is weak.   \n \n29.  These lessons fully acknowledge the mistakes in designing the supplementary project. \nAs noted in the PCR, these lessons are applicable to follow-on projects of earlier interventions \nin the same sector that have experienced implementation difficulties.5 \n \nC.  Recommendations  \n \n30.  The PCR\u2019s recommendations focused on the actions required to sustain the subprojects \nwithin the purview of the government. In this light, ADB may devise an action plan or a matrix of \nfollow-up actions, identifying the responsible entities and timelines. This validation agrees with \nthe  recommendations  for  further  action  or  follow-up,  and  especially for  the  government  to         \n(i) provide funds to rectify the deficiencies of the subprojects, including leaking pipes, broken \ntaps of stand pipes, and water treatment units; and (ii) reform the WSS sector by adopting a \nWSS policy, and revise institutional, regulatory, and legal frameworks. \n \nV.  OTHER CONSIDERATIONS AND FOLLOW-UP \n \nA.  Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation, and Utilization  \n \n31.  There was no monitoring and evaluation system at the onset as the RRP did not \nindicate any system, except for the DMF. On the other hand, the DMF did not sufficiently \nidentify the indicators that were supposed to be monitored. \n \nB.  Comments on Project Completion Report Quality \n \n32.  This validation finds the PCR diligent in supporting its claims, and rates the quality of the \nPCR satisfactory. The PCR is clearly written and the logical flow, leading to the lessons learned \nand recommendations, is easy to follow. However, this validation finds the report lacking in the \nborrower\u2019s point of view on significant issues such as project management, non-allocation of \nfunds for critical activities, and the lack of data source for the stated project impact. \n \nC.  Data Sources for Validation \n \n33.  Apart from the PCR, the RRP and mission reports were available and used for this \nvalidation. This validation also benefited from the PCR of the Community-Based Infrastructure \nServices Sector Project in the Kyrgyz Republic.  \n \nD.  Recommendation for Independent Evaluation Department Follow-Up \n \n34.  As the project was canceled in June 2013 and no additional activity is envisaged, the \nproject  performance  evaluation  report  could  be  conducted  any  time.  Despite  the  limited \nachievements of the supplementary project, much can be learned about preparing a follow-on \nproject to an unsuccessful project, such as that a follow-on project should not be avoided but \nwill need special arrangements.     \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n5\u00a0\u00a0The PCR of the preceding project (ADB. 2010.
