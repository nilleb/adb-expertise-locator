However, it will \nsupport transport projects listed in the COBP of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka.2 \nKnowledge  exchange  among  government  agencies,  nongovernmental  organizations  (NGOs), \nthink tanks, and the private sector will be one of the key methods of including innovative features \nin projects. Others will involve capacity building through technical advice and training programs. \nInnovative  features  may  include  subjects  related  to  road  and  rail  safety,  engineering  design, \nresettlement and rehabilitation, environment, disaster risk management,  gender mainstreaming, \ncommunication, asset management and project finance.3 The TA facility approach is suitable as \nit will (i) provide project preparation and implementation support to a number of projects; (ii) enable \nefficient use of resources by having the same consultants or NGOs and think tanks work for a \nnumber of projects, avoiding repeated lengthy recruitment processes; and (iii) ease knowledge \nexchange and capacity building activities for a number of executing agencies  and implementing \nagencies.  \n \n2. \nThe  TA  will  initially  provide  project  preparation  support  to  the  following  projects  in  the \npipeline: (i) BAN: Dhaka Metro Line 5 North Investment Program; (ii) BAN: Railway Rolling Stock \nMaintenance  Project;  (iii)  IND:  Indore  Metro  Rail  Project;  and  (iv)  SRI:  Railway  Investment \nProgram. For projects under implementation, capacity building and technical support will initially \nbe provided to (i) BAN: Chittagong \u2013 Cox\u2019s Bazaar Rail Project; (ii) BHU: SASEC Transport, Trade \nFacilitation and Logistics Project, and iii) NEP: SASEC Road Connectivity Improvement Project.4 \nThese  projects \nissues  which  are \noverwhelming  the  implementing  agency  and  executing  agency,  and  could  potentially  cause \ndelays in project implementation.5  Hence, additional technical and capacity building support is \nnecessary.  This  will  require  additional  funds  exceeding  the  budget  available  for  the  projects. \nDetailed information for each project is provided in Appendix 1. \n\ninvolve  challenging  environmental  and  resettlement \n\n                                                \n1  Innovative features are activities or new ideas that are being designed or implemented for the first time in the state \n\nor country or region. \n\n2  ADB. 2017.

The  aide  memoire  of  the  respective  missions  documents  discussions  on  the \nproposed scope of the TA.  \n\n5  The Bangladesh SASEC Chittagong\u2013Cox\u2019s Bazaar Rail Project, for instance, involves the construction of a 102 km \ngreenfield rail line that passes through three protected areas and several elephant crossings. Innovative mitigation \nmeasures  proposed  under  the  project  include:  (i)  elephant  overpasses  (first  of  its  kind  in  the  world),  (ii)  wildlife \nunderpasses, (iii) funnel fencing, and (iv) sensor systems to provide early warning to train drivers on presence of \nelephants near the railway line (also first of its kind in the world).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nThe  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region  is  experiencing  change  in  various  fronts  due  to  rapid \n3. \neconomic growth. This creates an evolving financial landscape with shifting development needs. \nThis is the key principle on which the ADB Strategy 2020 is based. Rapid economic growth brings \na host of challenges identified  in Strategy 2020 such as (i) continued poverty, (ii) disparities in \nwell-being within and among developing member countries (DMCs), (iii) the growing strain on the \nnatural environment, (iv) inadequate infrastructure to deliver social services, (v) the need for better \nregional  cooperation  and  integration,  and  (vi)  the  need  for  more  emphasis  on  innovation, \ntechnology, and higher education.  \n \n4. \nThe  existence  of  an  evolving  business  environment  among  DMCs  combined  with  the \nOCR-ADF  merger  has  pushed  ADB\u2019s  regional  departments  to  prepare  projects  that  are \nincreasingly  complex  in  nature  and  are  of  a  larger  scale. 6 In  the  South  Asia  Transport  and \nCommunications (SATC) division, this has translated into a significant increase in the total number \nof projects and lending volume, accounting for 44% in 2016 and 30% in 2017 of the overall ADB \ntransport sector lending. Transport sector lending in South Asia Department (SARD) comprised \n32%  in  2016  and  29%  in  2017.7 Between  2006  and  2015,  SATC  has  processed  an  annual \naverage of six projects with a total value of $1.2 billion. In 2016, 11 projects worth $2.075 billion \nand in 2017, nine projects worth $2.034 billion were approved. This trend is expected to continue, \nwith approximately 10 projects each in the pipeline for approval in 2018 and 2019.  \n\n \nThe  Bangladesh  SASEC  Chittagong\u2013Cox\u2019s  Bazaar  Railway  Project,  Phase  1  (SCCB) \n5. \nworth $2.2 billion, with ADB financing of $1.5 billion, was approved in 2016. This was the largest \nproject approved by ADB that year and the largest project approved in SATC in the past 10 years. \nIn the same year, the India Bihar New Ganga Bridge (BNGB) Project worth $832 million with ADB \nfinancing  of  $500  million  was  also  approved.  Support  for  such  mega  flagship  projects  are \nincreasingly  being  requested  by  ADB  DMCs.  Inevitably,  these  projects  come  with  major \nchallenges  and  risks,  and  test  the  capacity  of  all  project  participants  including  government \nimplementing  agencies.  Mitigating  risks  of  flagship  projects  require  world  class  engineering \ndesign,  thorough  financial  and  economic  analysis  including  investigating  private  sector \nparticipation, and innovative maintenance systems to ensure sustainability of the infrastructure. \nThe  complexity  of  safeguard  issues  is  immensely  compounded.  For  example,  the  social  and \nenvironment safeguards categories for both the SCCB and BNGB projects are A as they lead to \nsignificant impact on involuntary resettlement and involve highly sensitive environmental issues. \nMandatory climate change assessment is rapidly advancing at a global level, hence, the project \nteam and government require additional support in meeting evolving requirements during project \npreparation  and  implementation. 8  These  challenges  call  for  engaging  high  quality  technical \nexperts, implementing innovative ideas, and collaborating closely with executing agencies.  \n \n6. \nSimilar challenges arise in projects among SARD DMCs due to geographic proximity and \nsimilar  institutional  systems.  For  example,  Bhutan  and  Nepal  are  both  landlocked  and \nmountainous  countries  that  suffer  from  severe  road  blocks  due  to  landslides  every  monsoon. \nHence,  similar  slope  protection  measures  and  road  maintenance  systems  could  be  applied. \nFlooding is common in Bangladesh, in some states in India, and the Terai region of Nepal, hence, \nrequiring similar flood and drainage management systems. SATC has been implementing  rural \nroad  projects  in  India  and  Sri  Lanka  where  similar  challenges  are  faced on  road  design,  road \n\n                                                \n6 The  merger  is  a  groundbreaking  initiative  of  ADB  to  combine  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) approved by the ADB board in 2016. It became effective in January 2017 and is expected \nto expand ADB\u2019s lending capacity by as much as 50%.  \n\n7   Including cofinancing. \n8   In place since 2014. \n\n\f3 \n \n\nsafety,  climate  resilience,  land  donation  and  public  consultations.  Significant  involuntary \nresettlement is being encountered for projects in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka with \nsimilar  types  of  social  risks,  compensation  and  rehabilitation-related  issues.  Road  safety  is  a \nparamount concern in all SARD DMCs where large numbers of railway and road accidents occur \nin Bangladesh and India. Many common environmental issues such as those related to wildlife \nexist across SARD DMCs. SATC is currently implementing one rail project in Bangladesh and two \nroad  projects  in  Nepal  and  Bhutan  with  elephant  routes  crossing  the  road.9 All  these  projects \ninvolve  innovative  wildlife  impact  mitigation  measures.  Finally,  communication  with  external \nstakeholders  remains  a  challenge  in  most  transport  projects.  Good  practices  under  the  India \nJaipur Metro Rail Project and Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project, could be shared \nand replicated in similar projects in South Asia.10  \n \nCommon  issues  and  challenges  within  and  among  the  SARD  DMCs  bring tremendous \n7. \nopportunities  for  regional  cooperation,  collaborative  learning  and  South-South  collaboration. \nUnder  the  standard  framework  of  investment  projects  and  TAs  where  resource  packaging  is \nlargely project-focused and country-focused, it is difficult to exchange knowledge and expertise \non  regional  and  global  best  practices  which  is  often  more  efficient  and  more  likely  to  bring \nsuccessful results. There are limited avenues for government officials to collaborate with NGOs, \nthink tanks or the private sector within and outside South Asia on topics such as road and rail \nsafety,  engineering  design,  resettlement  and  rehabilitation,  environment  management,  climate \nresilience, gender mainstreaming, asset management, and project finance.  \n \nB. \n \nOutput 1: Innovative features developed and/or implemented. The TA will support the \n8. \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  innovative  features  in  at  least  four  projects  being \nimplemented  in  2018\u20132020  or  proposed  for  approval  in  2019\u20132020.  Innovative  features  may \ninclude specific subject matters under road and rail safety, engineering design, resettlement and \nrehabilitation,  environmental  issues,  disaster  risk  management  including  climate  change  risks, \ngender  mainstreaming,  communication,  asset  management,  and  project  finance.  This  may  be \naccomplished  through knowledge exchange, collaborative learning, or South-South partnership.  \n \nOutput  2:  Knowledge  products  disseminated.  To  document  the  innovative  features, \n9. \nknowledge  exchange,  collaborative  activities  developed  and/or  implemented,  at  least  three \nknowledge products will be prepared based on activities under output 1. \n \n\nOutputs and Activities \n\nCooperation \n\n                                                \n9  ADB. 2016.
