THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for the Maternal and Child Health Integrated Care Project. \n \n2.  The project supports Tajikistan\u2019s commitment to attaining Sustainable Development Goal \n3 (SDG 3) and in particular its targets for maternal and child health (MCH).  The project will help \nintegrate MCH services at the primary and secondary levels to deliver better quality of healthcare \nin three districts with the highest rates of maternal and child mortality.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Tajikistan is a small, landlocked country located in the southeastern region of Central Asia. \nIts territory covers 142,600 square kilometers and is bordered by Uzbekistan and the Kyrgyz \nRepublic to the west and north, the People\u2019s Republic of China to the east, and Afghanistan to \nthe south. It is a low-middle income country with a gross national income per capita of $1,110; a \npopulation of 8.7 million; and a poverty headcount rate of 31.3%.2 \n \n4.  Tajikistan is committed to the attainment of SDG3 targets for neonatal and infant mortality \n\u2013\u201312 neonatal and 25 infant deaths per 1,000 live births. The country\u2019s current child mortality \nrates are 20 neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births and 37 infant mortality rate.3 Maternal mortality \nalso is higher in Tajikistan\u2013\u201332 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2017\u2013\u2013than in other Central \nAsian or European countries, which averaged 23 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2017.4  \n \n5.  The attainment of the MCH-related SDG3 targets is constrained by systemic health sector \nissues such as inadequate funding for and delivery of quality health care services, insufficient \nhuman resources, and the population\u2019s limited awareness of the importance of MCH. Other \nimpediments to MCH outcomes outside the health sector are poverty, geography, and lack of \naccess to clean water. \n  \n6.  Achieving better health for all is an important part of Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) \nStrategy 2030 which aims to address remaining poverty and reducing inequalities in Asia and the \nPacific. The strategy regards ADB\u2019s support for improving quality and coverage of health services \nand  reducing  the  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred  by  the  poor  as  essential  in  addressing \nimpoverishment.  \n \n7.  Health services delivery. MCH care suffers from fragmented links and communication \nbetween primary health care (PHC) and hospital care, nonfunctioning referral pathways, and an \nabsence of patient follow-up practices. Apart from being fragmented, the service delivery system \nis duplicative. For instance, antenatal care, immunization, and child health care are provided at \n                                                \n1 To select the districts, Ministry of Health and Social Protection of the Population of the Republic of Tajikistan and ADB \ndeveloped a three-step process that included ranking of district using indicators depicting MCH continuum of care \nand socio-economic status, exclusion of  districts with significant donor presence, and identifying readiness for \nreforms through  focus group discussions and surveys. Criteria for Selection of Project Districts (accessible from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n2  Current US$, Atlas method.  World Bank. 2018.

Alongside these are specialized institutions such as the Center for Immunization \nand the Center for Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses, which can also provide \nconsultations on MCH. These specialized centers are vertical programs that directly report to the \nMinistry of Health and Social Protection of the Population of the Republic of Tajikistan (MOHSPP). \nSome of them also provide limited inpatient care. \n \n8.  Most patients go directly to secondary- and tertiary-level hospitals, bypassing most rural \nhospitals for child delivery and during child illness. Bypassing leads to disrupted patient care and \na more expensive health service delivery. Although regulations on a referral system exist, its \nimplementation is not enforced. \n  \n9.  Health facilities in remote districts are in poor condition after years of underinvestment, \nand available technology and equipment are often obsolete. About 65% of the facilities were built \nbetween 1938 and 1990, and most do not meet basic technical requirements and put both patients \nand staff at risk.5 Some lack electricity during winter, many have inadequate sanitation, and \ninfection-preventing measures are not always adhered to.6 \n \n10.  Human resources for health. The poor qualifications of health care workers are another \nconstraint. In a small-scale study of selected health care providers in rural areas, physicians and \nmidwives on average answered less than 50% of 52 knowledge questions about maternity care \ncorrectly.7 Continuous medical education (CME) is regulated by a special decree. Publicly \nfinanced slots are scarce, and neither the health facilities nor the physicians can afford to pay for \ntraining. Demand for paid CME courses is low unless they are financed by development partners.8 \nThe quality of care has also suffered from a serious brain drain, beginning with the civil war and \ncontinuing into the present, as health workers seek higher wages abroad. \n \n11.  Health financing. All the problems above are exacerbated by limited financing for health. \nDespite the political commitment to public health,9 the health sector commands only 7.0% of the \ntotal government budget, compared with 12.0% in the Kyrgyz Republic and an 11.5% global \nweighted average.10 Consequently, households\u2019 shoulder most of the health care costs.11 \n \n12.  A World Bank review of public health expenditure noted an oversupply of beds and too \nmany avoidable inpatient admissions (an estimated one-third of these cases could have been \ntreated in outpatient settings).12 This situation is compounded by the current health financing \nmodalities, whereby the government provides funds through line-item budgeting, which allocates \npublic funds to institutions based on their bed capacity, number of staff, and historical utility costs. \n                                                \n5  KfW. 2013.

World Development Indicators. \n11 Data from the 2015 Tajikistan health accounts show that 63.3% of total health expenditures are met by households\u2019 \nout-of-pocket payments. \n12 World Bank. 2013. Tajikistan Public Expenditure Review. \n \n ", "3 \nIn contrast, many countries have shifted to a case-based payment system, which reimburses \nhospitals at a predetermined fixed rate for each treated case.13 \n \n13.  Knowledge of maternal and child health. The share of pregnant women delivering in \nhospitals has steadily increased in Tajikistan\u2019s urban centers, but in rural and often remote areas, \nawareness of the need for timely and good-quality MCH care remains low. Limited access to \nhospitals and cultural issues are only part of the story. The rural population also lacks important \ninformation on childcare practices. A coherent and culturally sensitive strategy to change the \nhealth-seeking behavior of rural families does not exist, and rural health workers also lack the \nskills to communicate effectively with these communities.  \n \n14.  Government\u2019s sector strategies. The pursuit of SDG3 is echoed in the National Health \nStrategy for Tajikistan, 2010\u20132020, which envisions strengthening maternal, newborn, child, and \nadolescent health; preventing and controlling infectious diseases; decreasing the burden of \npreventable noncommunicable diseases; and improving PHC. The government approved the \nStrategic Plan for the Rationalization of Medical Facilities in the Republic of Tajikistan for 2010\u2013\n2020 (No. 169 dated 1 April 2011) to rationalize health service delivery. The plan envisions the \nintegration of health services across levels of care and types of providers. \n \n15.  Lessons.  The project will build upon achievements and lessons learned from ADB\u2019s past \nsupport to health sector in Tajikistan. A major lesson learned from the Health Sector Reform \nProject is that rationalization of health facilities and provision of adequate health financing should \ngo hand in hand.14 The completion report noted the value of conducting comprehensive needs \nassessment before drawing up civil works and equipment lists to ensure right inputs are made, \nand the need for intensive information campaigns to ensure community participation. \n \n16.  ADB value addition. ADB will contribute to the integration of primary and secondary care \nby concentrating on MCH, which is key for better-quality and efficient provision of services. The \nproject will consolidate different pilots of development partners that focus on either PHC or \nsecondary care into an integrated concept. Integrated care refers to integration and coordination \nof all levels of health services (primary, secondary, and tertiary) to provide patients with more \neffective and continuous care.15 ADB will bring in regional lessons on integrating health care \nservices and improving efficiencies in health service delivery to inform the project and the \ncountry\u2019s ongoing health reforms.  \n \n17.  Development partner support. German development cooperation through KfW has \nbeen supporting the rationalization of hospitals in Khatlon Oblast since 2011, while the World \nBank,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  and  German  development  cooperation \nthrough Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) have been supporting \nPHC. United Nations agencies such as the World Health Organization, the United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Development Programme, and the United Nations \nPopulation Fund are also providing policy and implementation support to the sector. KfW\u2019s \nplanned financing of the Mother, Child and Emergency Care VI program will align with the project \nto complete the continuum of MCH care: the ADB project focuses on primary and secondary care, \n                                                \n13 J.

Economic and Financial \n \n26.  Economic analysis.  An economic analysis was conducted by ADB staff in accordance \nwith relevant ADB guidelines.23 Two main streams of project benefits are quantifiable. First, the \nproject will lead to cost savings in MCH care for vulnerable households. Second, the project will \nlead to higher productivity of beneficiaries by helping reduce morbidity and mortality. The resulting \nbase-case  economic  internal  rate of  return  (EIRR)  is  9.1%,  indicating  that the  program  is \neconomically viable because its value is above the opportunity cost of investment for social sector \nprojects of 6% (footnote 23). A sensitivity analysis indicates that the EIRR is sensitive to changes \nin costs and benefits. All the scenarios yield EIRR rates above the 6% return on investment for \nsocial sector projects. \n \n27.  Financial analysis.  ADB staff undertook a fiscal impact and sustainability analysis on the \ngovernment\u2019s ability to cover provision of counterpart funds, recurrent and maintenance costs. \nThe analysis confirms that the government has adequate financial resources and will be able to \nfulfill all its financial obligations under the project. The tax exemption cost is significantly less than \n1% of the government\u2019s total annual expenditure and total health expenditure.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n28.  Financial management.  An  assessment of the financial management arrangements for \nthe project concluded that the risk rating is substantial for the following reasons:  (i) insufficient \nfinancial management capacity of the executing and implementing agencies, (ii) a partially \nautomated payment system, (iii) weak internal audit capacity,(iv) lack of an integrated financial \nmanagement information system; (v) no external audits, and (vi) lack of experience with ADB\u2019s \nfinancial management requirements and disbursement procedures. The risk will be mitigated with \nan  action  plan  that  includes:  (i)  conducting  regular  training  for  project  staff  on  financial \nmanagement and providing consultant support to PAG; (ii) developing a financial manual that will \nalso define internal control measures such as segregation of duties, authorizations, obligations, \nand reconciliations; (iii) providing technical support to  create an internal audit manual and \nmethodology, as well as an internal audit charter to guide PAG activities; (iv) having project \nfinancial statements audited by independent auditors based on terms of reference agreed with \nthe ADB; (v) installing of a fully automated accounting system that will generate interim financial \nreports to be submitted to ADB regularly and on time; and (vi) adopting a project accounting \nsystem to ensure quality and reliable accounting and reporting. \n \n29.  Procurement.  An assessment of the procurement arrangements concluded that the \nprocurement risk is substantial because of limited capacity for following ADB procedures. The risk \nwill be mitigated by hiring experienced procurement specialists for the PAG. All procurement \n(including consulting services and advance actions) will be undertaken in full conformity with the \nADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for \nADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time) as indicated in the PAM (footnote 21). The \nprocurement plan will be updated at least annually, and proposed changes will require ADB \napproval. ADB will be responsible for oversight and monitoring, including posting the initial \nprocurement plan and any subsequent changes. Civil works will be procured through open \ncompetitive bidding. \n \n30.  Executing/implementing agency has been recommended to consider direct contracting \nwith UNICEF related to some activities in Output 1 and 3, subject to ADB review. UNICEF has \n                                                \n23 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila.  \n ", "8 \nrich experience in maternal and child health and behavior change communication in Tajikistan \nand most of the output activities in continuous quality improvement, supportive supervision, and \nbehavior  change  communication  strategy  are  continuation  of  previous  work  done  by \nUNICEF.24   The choice of UNICEF allows for an expeditious contracting and commencement of \nimplementation of soft components of the project and there are financial advantages due to \nmultiplier effect of investments.  \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the MOHSPP. The policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 21). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n32.  The project addresses key poverty and social issues by bringing improved and accessible \nhealth services closer to patients. The primary beneficiaries of the project will be the rural \npopulation, especially, women of reproductive age, pregnant women, and children who are \nfrequent users of health services. The project will also benefit health workers across the entire \nhealth system, but most particularly those working on MCH services in hospitals or at PHC \nfacilities in project districts. The project will assist the poor and vulnerable by better preparing \nclinical staff to diagnose, treat, counsel, and adhere to MCH referral protocols, and thus better \nrespond to the health concerns of the community. The project will also involve the community in \nBCC activities by engaging with community leaders, religious leaders, and representatives of \nwomen\u2019s committees to raise people\u2019s awareness of MCH and other health issues and improve \naccess to quality health care services. TRTA prepared a poverty reduction and social strategy \nthat includes measures to manage social impacts and enhance the distribution of benefits from \nthe project. \n \n33.  Gender. The project is classified as gender equity because it directly tackles the problem \nof poor access to MCH health services. Specifically, it targets a significant increase in the number \nof women and children who seek health care services, and the timely and quality provision of \nantenatal,  delivery,  postnatal,  and  well-child  care  and  services.  It  will  build  or  rehabilitate \nobstetrics and gynecological units in the district hospitals and equip them with the necessary \nmedical equipment, as well as women- and child-friendly facilities such as private examination \nrooms, sex-segregated toilets, and diaper-changing rooms. The project will also help develop \ngender-sensitive referral protocols and ensure continuous training of professional MCH staff such \nas family doctors, nurses, and midwives. Finally, the project will address the sociocultural attitudes \nthat keep the population from seeking timely MCH services by launching a BCC campaign that \ntargets women of reproductive age, husbands, and mothers-in-law, as well as middle and high \nschool  students.  The  project  has  a  gender  action  plan  that  outlines  the  gender  equality \ninterventions that will improve women\u2019s access to quality health services. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n34.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.25 \n \n35.  Environment (category B). The project is classified B for environment under ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  2009  (SPS  2009).  In  accordance  with  SPS  2009  an  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) report, including an environmental management plan (EMP), \n                                                \n24 Paragraph 2.17, provision of ADB Procurement Strategy (2017, as amended from time to time). \n25 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "9 \nhas been prepared, covering all facilities to be rehabilitated under this project. Potential negative \nenvironmental impacts are largely related to construction activities under output 2. The main \nidentified impacts during construction or reconstruction are dust, solid waste, and occupational \nand community health risks, such as those arising from removal, handling, and disposal of old \nasbestos sheeting. Dust and/or solid waste impacts will also arise from small-scale outdoor \nconstruction activities\u2014such as building septic tanks and repairing water supply and canalization \nsystems\u2014and when replacing old equipment. Impacts during operation are expected from the \nstorage and disposal of medical waste. The EMP defines mitigation measures and monitoring \nrequirements and will be included as an appendix in all bidding and contract documents. A site-\nspecific EMP will be prepared by the contractor before construction and approved by the PAG. \nThe institutional capacity of the borrower to manage environmental risks and operational tasks in \nconnection with health care waste is limited. To raise awareness and develop the capacity of \nMOHSPP,  hospitals,  health  centers,  and  district  administrations,  project  activities  to  build \nenvironmental  management  capacity  will  include  training  programs  at  hospitals  and  health \ncenters that specifically deal with hospital and domestic waste management. The IEE provides \nguidance for contractors on preparing a waste management plan. The cost for implementing the \nEMP will be borne by the project, while the costs of mitigating measures will be included in the \nconstruction contracts, and the cost for environmental monitoring and training of the PAG will be \nincluded  in  the  consulting  services  of  the  construction  supervision  consultants.  A  full-time \nenvironment specialist in the PAG will oversee and monitor the implementation of the EMP and \nsite-specific plans. \n \n36.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). Social safeguards due diligence confirmed that \nthe  project  activities  will  neither  require  land  acquisition  nor  resettlement.  Construction  or \nrehabilitation of district hospitals and DHCs will take place within the existing land. If any changes \nor additional land requirements or involuntary resettlement impacts are identified during the \nproject implementation stage, a resettlement plan will be prepared in accordance with the ADB \nSPS (2009) and national requirements. The resettlement plan needs to be fully implemented \nbefore any works start at the impact sites. A resettlement framework is not required as under the \ninvoluntary resettlement category C. \n \n37.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  C).  No  indigenous  peoples,  as  defined  in  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement, live in the project area, so the project is classified as category C for \nindigenous peoples impacts. \n \n38.  Public disclosure. The IEE and EMP will be endorsed and disclosed publicly once the \ngovernment has endorsed the project and before approval by the ADB Board of Directors.  \nInformation  about  the  project  including  general  project  information,  contact  details,  project \nprogress, procurement, and audited financial statements of the project, will be publicly disclosed.  \n \nF.

ASSURANCES  \n \n40.  The government and MOHSPP have assured ADB that the implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and grant documents. \n \n41.  The  government  and  MOHSPP  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  and \nconditions for the project, which are set forth in the draft grant agreement. Signing of a tri-partite \nagreement between MOHSSP, Ministry of Finance and the district governments of the project \ndistricts on the adoption of the masterplan for the development of MCH services is a condition to \ndisbursement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n42.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the grant not exceeding \n$32,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian \nDevelopment Fund) for the Maternal and Child Health Integrated Care Project, on terms and \nconditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement \npresented to the Board.  \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n2 November 2018 \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with  \nHealth status and well-being of mothers and children in the project districts improved (Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 3)a  \n \nData Sources \nPerformance Indicators with Targets \nResults Chain  and Reporting  Risks \nand Baselines \nMechanisms \nOutcome  By 2026:     \nCoverage of  1.
