The road section is also part of \nthe key corridors under the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program. The \nproject is the latest attempt to complete this road section and will be taking the fragile and conflict-\naffected  situation (FCAS)  approach  to give  the  contractors more flexibility  in security  provision \nand  arrangement. 1 It  will  also  include  capacity  development  programs  for  the  implementing \nagency. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nSurrounded by six countries, Afghanistan is in a strategic location along the ancient Silk \nRoute and is the crucial link for Central Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East. It is also a conduit \nto access ports in Pakistan and on the Caspian Sea for trade with Europe and the Middle East. \nHowever, prolonged wars and conflict have devastated Afghanistan\u2019s economy by destroying the \nminimal economic infrastructure and institutions this country once possessed and driving more \nthan 2.5 million Afghans away from their homes and livelihoods. Following the fall of the Taliban \nregime,  Afghanistan  received  billions  of  dollars  for  reconstruction  of  the  country  through \ninternational assistance, which has dramatically boosted its gross domestic product to more than \n$20  billion\u2014five  times  higher  than  in  2002.  However,  the  country  is  still  at  the  beginning  of \nrecreating an economy that can ensure stable and sustainable development. \n \nRehabilitation of the transport infrastructure was one of the key development strategies, \n4. \nand the Ring Road, with a total length of 2,210 km, was the government\u2019s top priority because it \nis  considered  the  backbone  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  transport  system  and  the  principal  conduit  for \nnational  and  international  passenger  and  freight  traffic.  More  than  80%  of  Afghans  live  within \n50 km from the road alignment.  Reconstruction of  the  Ring  Road started in 2002  and to date, \n1,925 km have been completed under the assistance of the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  World  Bank,  Government  of  Saudi \nArabia, and Asian Development Bank (ADB).  The ongoing construction of the 52-km section from \nArmalik to Leman, financed by the Government of Saudi Arabia, is expected to be completed by \nDecember 2017. Therefore, the 233-km section from Qaisar to Leman is virtually the only missing \nlink of the Ring Road. This link is strategically important, as it passes through one of Afghanistan\u2019s \nmost remote and insecure regions. \n \n5. \nWith ADB\u2019s support, the government has made multiple attempts since 2005 to complete \nconstruction of this missing link of the Ring Road.  First, in 2005, ADB approved $55 million under \nGrant 0012-AFG: Qaisar\u2013Bala Murghab Road Project to finance the construction of the 90-km \nsection from Qaisar to Bala Murghab,2 and subsequently, in 2007, approved $176 million under \n\n                                                \n1  M.

Engaging  with  fragile  and  conflict-affected  states:  An  alternative  approach  to  theory, \nmeasurement, and practice. https://www.wider.unu.edu/publication/engaging-fragile-and-conflict-affected-states. \n\n2  ADB. Islamic Republic of Afghanistan: Qaisar-Bala Murghab Road Project. \n\nhttps://www.adb.org/projects/documents/qaisar-bala-murghab-road-project-rrp. \n\n \n\n\fGrant 0081-AFG: Road Network Development Project 1 to finance the 143-km section from Bala \nMurghab to Leman.3 The Ministry of Finance (MOF) was the executing agency and the Ministry \nof Public Works (MPW) through its Program Management Office (PMO) was the implementing \nagency  for  both  projects.  The  implementation  of  Qaisar\u2013Bala  Murghab  Road  Project  was \nhampered  by  significant  security  challenges,  including  the  kidnappings  of  two  contractor \npersonnel,  one  of  whom  was  subsequently  killed.  Due  to  the  security  threats  and  a  lack  of \nconstruction progress, the contract was terminated for convenience in November 2009. For the \nBala  Murghab\u2013Leman  Project,  the  civil  works  procurement  failed  in  all  three  attempts  made \nbetween 2007 and 2009, as each was unable to attract any bids from qualified contractors. As of \nDecember 2009, the combined physical progress of these two projects was approximately 5%, \nand the combined undisbursed amount was $202 million.  \n \nThe rising prices for construction materials and labor during the prolonged construction \n6. \ndelay, and the need for additional funds for project security, led to a significant shortfall in project \nfinancing. To fill the funding gap and complete the entire 233-km section from Qaisar to Leman, \nin  December  2010,  ADB  approved  $340  million  under  Grant  0244-AFG:  Road  Network \nDevelopment  Investment  Program  Tranche  2  (Project  2)  under  the  Multi-tranche  Financing \nFacility Road Network Development Investment Program (the MFF) to finance the cost overruns \nunder both sections.4 As a result, the total amount of ADB financing for the entire road section \nfrom  Qaisar  to  Leman  increased  to  $542  million,  comprising  the  newly  approved  $340  million \nunder  Grant  0244  and  the  undisbursed  $202  million  under  Grants  0012  and  0081.  In  a  new \napproach,  the  civil  works  contract  was  re-tendered  as  one  large  design-build  contract  with  an \nintention to attract bids from quality international firms capable of managing the complex risks in \nthe Afghanistan context. The contract was awarded in December 2011 to a joint venture of U.S. \nand Turkish firms in the amount of $477.8 million. To ensure the works could proceed in a secure \nenvironment, $30 million of the overall contract amount was allocated for community development \nand $50 million of the overall contract amount was allocated for security services from the Afghan \nPublic  Protection  Force  (APPF),  the  Government  of  Afghanistan-controlled  security  service \nprovider.  \n \n7. \nPoor  coordination  among  the  MPW/PMO,  the  contractor  and  the  consultant  caused \nsubstantial  implementation  delays  and  several  contractual  disputes.  The  security  threats \nremained a major challenge. During implementation, the contractor only had access to the 82-km \nsection from Leman to Dari Bum while the remaining 151 km from Qaisar to Dari Bum was not \nhanded over as it remained unsecured. The contract was terminated in August 2014 after a series \nof  contract  disputes  with  the  overall  physical  progress  standing  at  approximately  15%.  The \ndisbursements of the three grants under Project 2 at the time of contract termination was $208 \nmillion. \n \n8. \nFollowing  the  change  in  the  MPW\u2019s  leadership  in  May  2015,  the  government,  with  the \nsupport  of  ADB,  made  a  major  change  in  the  PMO\u2019s  personnel  to  strengthen  its  project \nimplementation  capacity.  In  addition,  to  manage  the  persistent  security  threats,  the  FCAS \napproach has been adopted for the ongoing ADB financed projects. The contractors were given \ndispensation to make their own security arrangements with third party security firms instead of \nbeing required to use the APPF. These changes have led to significant progress for two ongoing \n\n                                                \n3  ADB. Islamic Republic of Afghanistan: Road Network Development Project 1. \n\nhttps://www.adb.org/projects/documents/road-network-development-project-i-rrp. \n\n4  ADB.  2010.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of \nAfghanistan:  Road  Network  Development  Investment  Program  Tranche  2.  Manila.  The  MFF  was  approved  on  \n27 November 2008 for $400 million. Financing for tranche 1 was utilized to fill the financing gap for the Andkhoy\u2013\nQaisar Road Project and North\u2013South Corridor Project.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fADB-financed projects in the security-volatile provinces of Helmand and Paktika, where contract \nawards  and  disbursements  have  proceeded  apace.  In  addition,  the  National  Procurement \nAuthority  was  introduced  in  2015  to  provide  oversight  support  for  procurement  and  greatly \nimproved transparency in Afghanistan\u2019s public procurement processes. In parallel, the Leman\u2013\nDari Bum section, which was left uncompleted under the terminated contract, was re-tendered in \ntwo international  competitive  bidding  packages and  the  contracts  were  awarded in  September \n2017. Recruitment of a consulting firm to carry out the detailed design of the Qaisar\u2013Dari Bum \nsection is in progress and mobilization is expected by March 2018. \n \n9. \nWhile making efforts to resume the work, the government requires additional funding, as \n$232 million has been spent under the previous contract on the civil works, security services and \ncontractual dispute. The remaining amount of $310 million under the three grants is inadequate \nto finance the remaining work of the Qaisar-Leman section. An estimated $130 million is required \nto complete the unfinished 82-km section from Leman to Dari Bum, and an estimated $330 million \nto complete the 151-km section from Qaisar to Dari Bum. Furthermore, Grant 0244, under which \nan uncommitted amount of $220 million still remains, will expire on 28 November 2018 because \nthe MFF expires. Based on the current progress of Project 2, it will take the government at least \n5 more years, i.e., until June 2022, to utilize all the funds, which will exceed the MFF availability \nperiod  by  3.5  years. To ensure  sufficient funds for  completing the  Ring Road,  the government \nrequested  to  restructure  Project  2\u2019s  financing  by  (i)  cancelling  $180 million  from  Grant  0244,  \n(ii) combining the cancelled amount of $180 million with $150 million of the 2017 allocation for \nAfghanistan, and (iii) utilizing the combined amount of $330 million to finance a new stand-alone \nproject for construction of the 151-km section from Qaisar to Dari Bum. The remaining amount of  \n$130 million ($40 million under Grant 0244 and $90 million under Grant 0081) will be sufficient to \nfinance the uncompleted Leman\u2013Dari Bum section. \n \n10. \nLessons learned. To ensure the successful implementation of the project, ADB and the \ngovernment  have  taken  the  lessons from  the  failures  of  the  previous  attempts  and  introduced \npreventive and corrective measures using an FCAS approach5 as follows:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nContractors to manage their own security. Based on the improved performance \nof the ongoing projects in Helmand and Paktika following the adoption of FCAS \napproach, the civil works contractors will be allowed to arrange their own project \nsecurity, which will be made a pay item of the contract. To ensure that the security \nbudget is effectively spent, the payments for security will be linked to the physical \nprogress  of  the  project.  In  addition,  the  project  scope  includes  community \ndevelopment  works  to  help  obtain  the  support  of  local  communities  and  thus \nindirectly improve the project\u2019s security.   \n \nProject  implementation  capacity  strengthened.  The  change  in  the  MPW\u2019s \nleadership  and  the  PMO\u2019s  personnel  in  2015  have  significantly  improved  the \ngovernment\u2019s  implementing  capacity.  Continued  strengthening  of  the  PMO \nthrough  the  ongoing  ADB-financed  projects  and  the  capacity-building  programs \nunder this project should ensure the sustainability of the implementing capacity in \nthe short and medium term. \n \nDesign-bid-build  modality with  contract  size suitable for  local contractors. \nThe  change  in  project  modality  from  a  large  design\u2013build  contract  to  the \nconventional design\u2013bid\u2013build contracts of smaller sizes was made to improve the \n\n                                                \n5  ADB. 2016.

The civil works will be tendered \nin three packages to attract the capable local firms and hence increase competition. \nTo  minimize  procurement  delays, \nthe  single-stage\u2013one-envelope  bidding \nprocedure  will  be  used  instead  of  the  single-stage\u2013two-envelopes  bidding \nprocedure under the predecessor projects. \n\n \n11. \nValue added by ADB assistance. Its rugged terrain and arid climate make Afghanistan \nprone to a wide range of natural hazards such as floods, droughts, landslides, avalanches, and \nearthquakes. Disasters triggered by these hazards have devastating impacts on lives, livelihoods, \nand physical infrastructure, including roads. Recent estimates by the World Bank indicate that the \nmodeled economic impacts of a 1-in-50-years flood could be $30 million for the road subsector \nalone, and $5.5 billion in the event of a 1-in-50-years earthquake.6 Moreover, climate change is \nexpected to lead to an increase in temperature and spring precipitation patterns, and alter the \nintensity and frequency of extreme weather events. These changes will have serious implications \nfor road planning, design, construction, and operation and maintenance. Accordingly, the project \nwill  also  develop  the  capacity  for  strengthening  the  disaster  and  climate  resilience  of  road \ninfrastructure. \n \n12. \nStrategic context. The project is ranked first among the investment priorities of the road \nimprovement  master  plan  and  is  programmed  under  the  Afghanistan  National  Development \nStrategy.7 The road is part of a strategic international and regional corridor. The recently updated \nTransport Master Plan under TA 8687-AFG considers the completion of the Ring Road as a critical \nelement  in  enabling  regional  connectivity, 8 improving  road  transport  services,  and  promoting \ninclusive economic growth in Afghanistan. The project is consistent with the country partnership \nstrategy for Afghanistan, 2017\u20132021,9 and is included in the country operations business plan for \nAfghanistan, 2017\u20132019.10 \n \nB. \n \n13. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: national trade in and through northwestern \nAfghanistan increased. The project will have the following outcome: an efficient and reliable road \nnetwork in northwestern Afghanistan developed.11 \n \nC. \n \n14. \nOutput 1: Qaisar\u2013Dari Bum link of the national Ring Road constructed. Output 1 will \nbe  a  151-km,  two-lane  national  highway  from  Qaisar  to  Dari  Bum,  with  appropriate  drainage \nstructures and highway safety features.  \n \n15. \nOutput  2:  Roadside  infrastructure  facilities  for  60  local  communities  installed  or \nconstructed.  Output  2  will  provide  basic  infrastructure  such  as  rural  access  roads,  culverts, \nsmall-scale irrigation schemes, schools, and clinics. The community development program will be \ndesigned based on needs assessment and culturally appropriate consultation with women. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n6  The World Bank. 2017.

The consultant for detailed engineering design is expected to be mobilized \nby  March  2018.  In  parallel,  the  bid  documents  are  being  prepared  by  the  PMO\u2019s  international \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\nspecialists. The preliminary design from the 2004 feasibility study is being improved using high-\nresolution  satellite  imagery.13 The  bid  documents  are  being  prepared  based  on  the  improved \npreliminary design and expected to be ready by August 2017. The civil works will be procured in \nthree packages (40 km\u201360 km each). For project security, the government has agreed that the \ncontractors  will  be  allowed  to  have  their  own  security  arrangements,  including  selection  of  a \nsecurity  subcontractor.  The  MPW  will  hold  consultations  with  the  local  communities to  assess \ntheir needs for basic infrastructure as soon as the detailed design consultant is mobilized. \n \nThe  project  will  undertake  a climate  change  and  disaster  risk  assessment  for  the  road \n22. \nsubsector, including a probabilistic flood risk assessment of the road section that passes through \nBadghis and Faryab provinces, to inform the detailed design. The assessment proposed under \nthe  project  will  provide  a  better  understanding  of  the  potential  impacts  of  climate  change  and \ndisaster  risk  on  the  road  infrastructure,  and  help  identify  critical  road  sections,  the  expected \nannual losses (of key hazards) for the critical sections, and recommendations on measures to \nmanage the risk. The  assessment  will  build on  the  disaster  risk  management  decision-making \ntool  developed  by  the  MPW  with  support  from  the  World  Bank  and  currently  focusing  on \nearthquakes and landslides, and expand its scope to include data on flood risk.14 \n \nB. \n \nBeing the last missing link of the national Ring Road and a high-priority part of one of the \n23. \ncorridors under the CAREC Program, the project road will have a strategic impact on the efficiency \nof the transport corridor. The complete Ring Road will substantially improve regional connectivity, \nraise intercity travel speeds, reduce vehicle operating costs, and increase communities\u2019 access \nto  social  services  and  infrastructure.  The  community  development  component  will  build  basic \ninfrastructure  such  as  rural  access  roads,  culverts,  schools,  clinics,  and  small-scale  irrigation \nschemes. Thus, the project will benefit the economy as a whole by improving the investment and \njob-creation conditions in the areas. The economic evaluation of the project was undertaken using \nADB's  Guidelines for the  Economic Analysis  of  Projects.15 The results  show  that  the  project  is \neconomically feasible with an estimated economic internal rate of return of 12.4%. The results of \nsensitivity  tests  indicate  that  the  project  will  remain  economically  viable  even  when  assuming \nadverse developments of traffic and project cost. A 29.5% increase in project cost will reduce the \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  to  9%.  A  reduction  in  traffic  by  24.3%  would  have  the  same \nimpact. \n \n24. \nGovernment funding for maintenance is considered a major risk in Afghanistan. Given the \ncountry\u2019s narrow economic base and competing claims on scarce budget resources, Afghanistan \nwill in the foreseeable future have to rely on donor contributions to finance road maintenance.16 \nThe  government  needs  about  $250  million  annually  to  maintain  its  roads,  while  the  revenue \ncollected in 2016 through road user fees and taxes totaled $83 million. However, revenues from \nroad users are not earmarked for road financing but are part of the general budget. Supported by \ndonors,  the  government  has  taken  steps  to  introduce  a  road  asset  management  system  that \n\n                                                \n13 The satellite imagery used for improving the preliminary design provides an accuracy of 1 meter  for the horizontal \n\ndimension and 0.10 meters for the vertical dimension. \n\n14 MPW has recently developed an online decision-making support system that allows analysis and visualization of \npotential  disaster  risk  scenarios  for  the  Baghlan\u2013Bamiyan  road  and  the  Salang  Highway.  The  system  currently \nincludes  the  risks  from  earthquakes,  landslides  (dry),  and  avalanches.  The  system  also  provides  disaster  risk \nreduction strategies at the transport corridor scale, such as slope stabilization using vegetation.  \n\n15 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n16 ADB. Islamic Republic of Afghanistan: Road Asset Management Project. \n\nhttps://www.adb.org/projects/documents/afg-road-asset-management-project-rrp. \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nwould enable a more rational and systematic operation and maintenance regime. A review of road \nuser  charges  and  their  allocation  is  underway.  The  effective  introduction  of  a  road  asset \nmanagement system and the envisaged restructuring of road user charges entail major reforms. \nBased  on  ADB\u2019s  experience  with  such  reforms  and  Afghanistan\u2019s  fragile  and  conflict-affected \nsituation, it difficult to determine a time-bound target for the conclusion of the reforms. \n \nC. \n \nThe financial management risk is moderate\u2014while the PMO has a fully functional finance \n25. \nsection  with  adequate  financial  management  capacity  and  the  overall  capacity  of  the  PMO \ncontinues  to  improve,  delays  may  occur  in  the  submission  of  the  audited  project  financial \nstatements and country-level corruption is prevalent.  \n \n26. \nInstitutional capacity. The overall capacity of the MPW is still inadequate to implement \nthe ADB transport program with a portfolio value of about $1.4 billion. Therefore, the reliance on \nthe PMO (also financed by ADB) is inevitable. During the change in 2015, the program director \nand  several  key  staff  were  removed  because  of  their  weak  capacity,  poor  performance,  and \ngovernance issues. The vacant positions were filled by new staff who were jointly selected by the \nMPW,  MOF,  and  ADB  in  a  transparent  recruitment  process.  Later,  three  international  experts \nwere  engaged  to  support  the  PMO  in  the  field  of  highway  design,  contract  management,  and \ninvoluntary resettlement. These changes have significantly improved the overall capacity of the \nPMO, as verified by the steady improvement in the portfolio performance from January 2016 to \ndate. With its current staffing (22 professionals and 30 supporting staff), the PMO\u2019s capacity is \ndeemed adequate to implement the ADB transport program, including this project.  \n \n27. \nFinancial management. An updated financial management assessment of the MPW and \nPMO  took  into  consideration  their  overall  capacity,  including  governance,  staffing,  budgeting, \nfund-flow arrangements, accounting and financial reporting systems, internal control procedures, \nfinancial information systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. It was found that, \nfrom a financial management perspective, the overall control risk is moderate, and that the MPW \nand PMO have adequate experience and capacity in financial management to manage the project \nfunds  as  well  as  adequate  fund  flow,  accounting,  and  budgeting  arrangements.  The  2015 \nstrengthening  of  the  PMO  has  significantly  improved  its  overall  capacity.  The  PMO\u2019s  finance \nsection staff includes a section manager, five accountants, and a trainee. To support the finance \nsection more efficiently in the conduct of financial management and further strengthen the staff\u2019s \ncapacity, the PMO is currently recruiting an international financial management specialist.  \n \n28. \nThe MPW conducts internal audits periodically, and annual external audits have yielded \nsatisfactory results since ADB\u2019s engagement with the MPW in 2003. The MPW is responsible for \nensuring an adequate audit trail, and an independent auditor acceptable to ADB has been auditing \nthe  annual  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  auditing  standards.  Although  the  financial \nmanagement risk is assessed to be moderate, major delays were observed in the submission of \nthe audited project financial statements, and this needs to be monitored closely.  \n \nProcurement and anticorruption. For the procurement of project-related goods, works, \n29. \nand non-consulting and consulting services, ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from \ntime to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to \ntime) shall apply. The civil works will be packaged in three open competitive bidding packages, \nfor  about  40  km\u201360  km  each.  To  mitigate  procurement  delay,  the  single-stage\u2013one-envelope \nbidding  procedure  will  be  used.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  MOF.  Policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 12). \n \nD. \n \n30. \nPoverty and social. Socially, the improved road is expected to ameliorate the mobility \nconstraint in accessing education, health services, employment, and wage labor. Better mobility \nmay  contribute  to  increased  market-based  production,  enabling  small  farmers  and  herders  to \nimprove food security and income. (The poverty and social assessment conducted for the project \nrevealed the extent of poverty in the country\u2014including, among other factors, (i) a high rate of \nfood  insecurity  affecting  one-third  of  the  population,  (ii)  a  lack  of  access  to  improved  water \nresources, and (iii) limited access to education and health services.)  \n \n31. \nGender. The gender assessment revealed high maternal and infant mortality rates, less \nmobility  of  women than of men,  and  women\u2019s  overall  low  status. While  the  project\u2019s  long-term \nimpact is expected to improve women\u2019s physical access to education, health, and other services \nby shortening travel times and making roads safer, these benefits are indirect. The project will \nensure equal pay for equal work among men and women. The project will attempt to benefit the \nwomen  and  children  in  communities  along  the  road  alignment  through  the  community \ndevelopment  component.  To  ensure  that  women\u2019s  needs  are  dealt  with  meaningfully, \ninfrastructure subprojects will be selected based on separate consultations with the communities\u2019 \nwomen, instituted in a culturally appropriate manner. \n \nE. \n \n32. \nsafeguard categories are as follows.17 \n \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  project  road  will  mostly  follow  the  existing  dirt  track\u2019s \n33. \nalignment, so the environmental impacts are expected to be minimal. The initial environmental \nexamination prepared for Project 2 in 2010 was updated in accordance with ADB\u2019s SPS, and was \ndisclosed in August 2017. The initial environmental examination will be updated by the detailed \ndesign consultant, whose mobilization is expected by October 2017. It is anticipated that the major \nenvironmental impacts of the project will occur during construction and will include soil erosion, \nair and water pollution, noise impacts, occupational health and safety issues, and cutting of trees. \nAdequate  mitigation  measures  are  included  in,  and  will  be  implemented  through,  an \nenvironmental management plan. Emissions from the increased traffic volume will be minimized \nby  vehicle  speed  control.  The  environmental  management  plan  stipulates  that  capacity \ndevelopment  be  provided  through  training  workshops  before  and  during  construction.  Due  to \nsecurity issues on the site, additional public consultations will be conducted during the detailed \ndesign stage (before construction). The proposed subprojects under the community development \ncomponent  (output  2)  will  be  screened  by  the  PMO.  The  proposals  that  will  cause  significant \nimpacts on the environment (category B or A) will not be considered. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  Most  of  the  road  improvement  work  will  be \n34. \ncarried out within the existing right-of-way. However, acquisition of privately owned land presently \nbeing  used  for  agricultural,  residential,  and  commercial  purposes  will  be  needed  to  meet  the \nminimum standard pavement and embankment width of 12 meters for national roads. Based on \na  preliminary  assessment,  works  in  all  three  road  sections  (Dari  Bum\u2013Bala  Murghab,  Bala \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS)  (2009),  the  project\u2019s \n\n                                                \n17  ADB.

It  is \nestimated  that  491  households  (3,437  individuals)  will  be  affected.  Of  these,  168 persons  will \nexperience  significant  impacts,  i.e.,  be  displaced  from  housing  or  lose  10%  or  more  of  their \nproductive assets. Access to the project sites is difficult at this time because of security threats. \nThe anticipated land acquisition impact was assessed by using satellite imagery in combination \nwith highway design software. Based on this and consultation with village representatives, three \ndraft  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans,  one  for  each  road  section,  were  prepared  in \naccordance with Afghanistan law and ADB\u2019s SPS. The draft plans were endorsed by the MPW \nand disclosed on the ADB website by 15 August 2017. These will be updated following detailed \ndesign, consultations, detailed measurement surveys, and valuation of assets.  \n \n35. \nLand acquisition and resettlement plan implementation will be monitored, and semi-annual \nmonitoring reports will be submitted to ADB and the MPW for review and disclosure. The proposed \nworks under the community development component will involve land acquisition. The proposals \nthat  will  have  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  will  not  be  considered.  The  PMO  will  screen \ncommunity proposals to ensure that this requirement is met. \n \n36. \nThe  MPW has  demonstrated  a commitment to  manage  social  risks  while implementing \nthe three tranches of an ongoing MFF Transport Network Development Investment Program. This \nhas also enabled the continuation of the PMO\u2019s environmental and social safeguards unit beyond \nits initial establishment. The unit exhibits a good level of proficiency in understanding the laws, \nrules,  and  procedures  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement-related  tasks,  and  the  social \nsafeguards requirements of ADB. MPW officers as well as PMO project managers will participate \nin orientation workshops on ADB\u2019s SPS and other land acquisition and resettlement topics to be \nconducted under RETA 7433.18 \n \nIndigenous peoples (category  C). Communities along the project alignment comprise \n37. \nmainly  Pashtuns  and  some  other,  smaller  ethnic  groups.  These  are  all  mainstreamed  into \nAfghanistan's  general  society  and  culture  and  cannot  be  considered  as  indigenous  people  as \ndefined under ADB\u2019s SPS. \n \nF. \n \n38. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.19 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nVolatile \nsecurity in \nproject area \n\nUncertain \nfinancial \nsustainability \nof O&M \n\nMitigation Measures \nCivil works will be procured in small and medium-sized packages to involve local \ncontractors.
