The Project will (i) improve quality, access\nand  awareness  of  essential  RH  services  for  the  poor  and\nunderserved  in  34  districts;  and  (ii)  strengthen  the  sector\u2019s\ncapacity  for  RH  services  in  the  context  of  the  Government\u2019s\nrestructuring  process,  including  strengthening  district\nmanagement,  human  resource  development,  private  sector\ntraining,  and  support  of  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).\nThe  Project  promotes  human  resource  development  through\npreservice  and  in-service  training  and  upgrading  training\ninstitutions. It will also assist the Government to strengthen its\npartnerships with NGOs by supporting small contracts for NGOs\nto provide RH services in the targeted districts. The Project will\nuse a participatory approach based on district plans involving the\nclients (including males), local leaders, and NGOs.\nClassification Poverty classification: Core poverty intervention\nThematic classification: Gender and development\nEnvironmental Category C. Environmental implications were reviewed, and no\nAssessment significant adverse environmental impacts were identified.\nRationale Pakistan\u2019s  rapid  population  growth  has  negated  the  impact  of\ndevelopment, and poverty has worsened during the last decade.\nHowever,  there  is  visible  evidence  that  the  transition  to  lower\nfertility has begun, and that there is potential for accelerating this\ntransition. The total fertility rate has declined from 7.1 in 1965-\n1969  to  4.8  in  2000.  The  contraceptive  prevalence  rate  has\nincreased from 12 percent to 28 percent in the last 10 years, while\nunmet demand increased from 28 percent to 38 percent.\nThe health status of women and infants is poor and has improved\nlittle over the past decade. Each year, about 20,000 women die\nfrom largely avoidable maternal complications, and 9 percent of\ninfants do not reach their first birthday. This is due to inadequate\nRH services, particularly community-based care and emergency\nobstetric care for the poor, coupled with weak management and\nlow  levels  of  investment.  In  addition,  traditional  practices  limit\nwomen\u2019s  rights  to  use  RH  services  for  themselves  and  their\nchildren.\nThe Government is concerned about the poor health status of\nwomen  and  children,  and  the  implications  of  high  population", "iii\ngrowth  for  family  welfare,  the  environment,  and  economic\ndevelopment. It wants to accelerate the pace of decline in fertility,\nintroduce  comprehensive  reproductive  services,  and  promote\ngender equity and women empowerment. The Government plans\na transition from separate family planning, and maternal and child\nhealth  services  to  the  integrated  RH  approach  to  improve  the\nacceptability,  efficiency,  and  impact  of  these  services.  It  is\nstrengthening  its  policy  framework,  in  particular  for  safe\nmotherhood.  It  is  merging  the  community-based  family  health\nworkers of the two ministries of health and population welfare. It is\nalso in the process of decentralizing health and population welfare\nprograms  to  the  provinces,  and  devolving  the  provincial\nresponsibilities  to  the  districts  as  part  of  a  larger  restructuring\neffort. The Government gives priority to expanding RH to the poor\nin  the  least-developed  and  underserved  districts.  It  wants  to\ninvolve local leaders and males in RH, and educate adolescents.\nIt wants NGOs and the private sector to expand RH services. The\nGovernment  has  requested  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)\nassistance with expanding, improving, integrating and devolving\nits  RH  services.  The  proposed  interventions  are  simple,\ninexpensive, and cost-effective; address the needs of the poor;\nand support sustainable development. The Project is fully in line\nwith ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy, and health and population\npolicies.\nObjectives and Scope The overall goal of the Project is to improve the RH status of\nfamilies,  reduce  maternal  and  infant  mortality,  and  reduce\npopulation  growth.  The  outcome  will  contribute  to  improving\nwomen\u2019s social status and reducing poverty. The objectives are to\n(i) increase the use of RH services in 34 poor and underserved\ndistricts, and (ii) strengthen the sector\u2019s capacity for RH services\nin the context of the Government\u2019s restructuring process.\nThe  Project  will  help  improve  the  use  of  RH  services  by\n(i) improving the quality and range of RH services through skills-\nbased in-service training, essential equipment and supplies, and\nquality control through supervision and monitoring; (ii) increasing\naccess of the rural poor to community-based RH services through\nfamily health workers, and selective upgrading of family planning\nand obstetric care services; and (iii) increasing awareness about\nRH services, and changing practices among specific target groups\nthrough  information,  education  and  communication  (IEC),  and\nadvocacy among local leaders. The Project will help to strengthen\nthe sector\u2019s capacity for RH services by (iv) strengthening national\nand provincial RH structures and management capacity in support\nof the RH approach, integration of RH services, and devolution of\nresponsibilities  and  authorities  to  the  districts;  and  develop\nprovincial RH programs; (v) developing human resources for RH\nby  improving  preservice  training  capacity;  and  (vi) harnessing\nNGOs  and  private  sector  capacity  with  financial  support  and\ntraining to develop RH services.", "iv\nCost Estimates The  total  cost  of  the  Project  including  physical  and  price\ncontingencies, and taxes and duties is estimated at $45.0 million\nequivalent, comprising a foreign exchange cost of $15.7 million\nequivalent (35 percent), and local currency cost of $29.3 million\nequivalent (65 percent).\nFinancing Plan\n                                         ($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nSource Exchange Currency Cost Percent\nAsian Development 15.7 20.3 36.0 80\nBank\nGovernment   0.0 9.0 9.0 20\nTotal 15.7 29.3 45.0     100\nSources:  ADB estimates, Government.\nLoan Amount and Terms ADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  SDR28,454,000  ($36,000,000\nequivalent) from its Special Funds resources.

About 50 percent of the\npopulation in these districts are poor, and more than 50 percent of\nthe beneficiaries of the Project will be poor. Depending on the type\nof intervention, about one third of the poor in these districts will\ndirectly benefit from the Project. Women and infants will benefit\nfrom increased awareness among males about RH issues, better\nRH care at home, and better access to quality RH services. It is\nestimated that the Project will prevent 11,000 maternal deaths,\nprevent 150,000 obstetric disabilities, save 100,000 infants, and\nprevent one million unwanted pregnancies. In addition, the Project\nwill accelerate the integration and decentralization of services of\nhealth  and  population  welfare  services,  operating  within  the\nframework of the devolution plan to strengthen the district health\nsystem.", "vi", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Reproductive Health Project.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. The Government of Pakistan recognizes the serious implications of poor women\u2019s health\nand high population growth, and desires to improve the reproductive health (RH) status of\nwomen and accelerate the pace of fertility decline. It plans to do so by strengthening the\nPopulation  Welfare  Program  (PWP)  of  the  Ministry  of  Population  Welfare  (MOPW)  and\nprovincial  population  welfare  departments  (PPWDs),  and  the  National  Program  of  Family\nPlanning and Primary Health Care (NPFP) of the Ministry of Health (MOH) and provincial health\ndepartments (PHDs). The Government aims to introduce the RH approach in line with the 1994\nCairo Resolution, promoting an integrated package of RH interventions aligned to the priorities\nof the people. In Pakistan, these priorities are family planning (FP), maternal care, infant care,\nand control of reproductive tract infections (RTI) and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The\nGovernment is planning to integrate maternal and child health (MCH) and FP services into the\nRH approach to make them more acceptable, efficient, and effective; and extend basic RH\nservices to all Pakistani. Many poor rural communities do not have access to basic RH services\nat present. As part of its overall restructuring of the public sector, the Government plans to\nmerge the population welfare and health structures, decentralize RH programs to the provinces,\nand devolve administrative powers to the district level.\n3. The support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to the health and population welfare\nsectors has contributed substantially to meeting the Government\u2019s targets for the eighth five-\nyear plan, 1993-1998.1 Under the umbrella of the Social Action Program (SAP), the Government\nhas requested ADB to help introduce the RH approach, and expand RH services in poor\ndistricts not included in ADB\u2019s Women\u2019s Health Project or other projects.2 Project preparatory\ntechnical assistance3 for the Reproductive Health Project was done from July to December\n2000. A participatory approach was used with extensive consultations of government officers,\nfield staff, beneficiaries, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and the private sector. The\nAppraisal Mission4 visited Punjab, Sindh, and North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) and met\nwith the Government, aid agencies, and NGO representatives to discuss the proposed Project,\nincluding possible cofinancing. The project framework is in Appendix 1.\n                  \n1  Loan 1200-PAK: Health Care Development Project, for $60 million, approved on 1 December 1992 ; Loan 1277-\nPAK: Population Project, for $25 million, approved on 2 December 1993; Loan 1301-PAK: Social Action Program\n(Sector) Project (SAPPI), for $100 million, approved on 23 June 1994; Loan 1493-PAK: Second Social Action\nProgram (Sector) Project (SAPPII), for $200 million, approved on  28 November 1996;\n2  Loan 1671-PAK: Women\u2019s Health Project, for $47.0 million, approved on 16 March 1999.

Pakistan is the seventh most populous country in the world with an estimated 143 million\npeople in 2001. At the current population growth of 2.3 percent, it will have 243 million people in\n2025.5 The rapid population growth has negated the impact of development and exacerbated\npoverty.  Pakistan  has  poor  human  development  indicators,  marked  by  inequities  between\nwomen and men, income groups, and urban and rural populations. The social sector has been\nneglected for many years; public sector expenditure for the social sector is still very small\u2014\naround 2 percent of gross domestic product for education, and less than 1 percent for health.\nSAP, initiated in 1992, resulted in only modest improvement of the country's social indicators, as\nit had to overcome major political, economic, and institutional constraints. Continuous social\nsector  reform  and  substantially  increased  investments  are  required  to  build  human  and\ninstitutional capacity, change attitudes and practices, and improve family health.\n5. The social structure, customs, and beliefs in Pakistan\u2019s more traditional society result in\nwomen and girls having less access to nutrition, education, health care, and employment.\nLevels of literacy and educational attainment remain very low, especially for rural women. The\n1998 census shows that in rural areas only 21 percent of women and 47 percent of men were\nliterate, compared with 55.6 percent of urban women and 72.6 percent of urban men. Women's\nparticipation in formal employment was only 13.6 percent. The social conditions of women\ninhibit them from making decisions and choices about their health, nutrition, and child bearing,\nparticularly in rural Pakistan, which has the highest fertility and maternal mortality ratios.\n6. The national per capita income was about $446 equivalent in 2000. Poverty increased,\nand income distribution worsened in the 1990s. Poverty increased to about 30-35 percent of the\npopulation.6  Based  on  the  head  count  approach,  the  proportion  of  poor  rural  and  urban\nhouseholds increased, respectively, from 18 to 35 percent, and 15 to 26 percent in the period\nFY 1987/88-FY1998/99. 7 Poverty is deeper and more rampant in rural areas, where it is closely\nlinked to land ownership, large family size, unemployment, and lack of social services. Poverty\nis more prevalent in rural Sindh and Balochistan. Forty-four percent of the population works in\nagriculture, which was hit by persistent drought in the past few years.\n7. In  addition  to  rising  poverty,  Pakistan  faces  severe  macroeconomic  imbalances,\ndeclining  economic  growth,  and  underdeveloped  human  capital.  Pakistan's  overall  fiscal\nsituation is precarious following several national and international events. In FY2001, the budget\ndeficit was reduced to 5.2 percent, which is the lowest deficit in 20 years.  However, chronic\nfiscal and external deficits have resulted in the accumulation of large domestic and external\ndebt, equal to 115 percent of gross domestic product in 2001. The country has successfully\nnegotiated a poverty reduction growth facility program with the International Monetary Fund,\nwhich is expected to be approved in December 2001.\n                  \n5  National Institute of Population Studies. 2000.

While the population is still growing due to the large number of young couples entering\nreproductive age, the fertility of couples has actually been declining in rural and urban areas.\nPakistan\u2019s total fertility rate declined from 7.1 in 1965-1969 to 4.8 in 2000, compared with 3.7 in\nBangladesh and 2.3 in Sri Lanka. Important causes of the decline include higher average age at\nmarriage  and  higher  use  of  contraceptives  among  women  beyond  30  years  of  age.  The\ncontraceptive prevalence rate has increased remarkably from 12 to 28 percent in the last\ndecade. The rise in the contraceptive prevalence rate is conspicuous in rural areas, where it is\nlinked to the increasing number of community-based workers and economic pressures on the\nhousehold.  Knowledge  of  contraceptive  methods  has  now  reached  almost  every  married\ncouple. As a result of the increasing desire to limit family size, the unmet need for contraception\nincreased from 28 to 38 percent between 1990/91 and 1996/97, indicating a major shortfall in\nservices. 8\n9. Each year, about 5 million children are born in Pakistan. While the use of antenatal\nservices  among  rural  women  has  increased  from  13  to  31  percent  in  the  past  decade,\nmotherhood has not become much safer. Most rural women deliver at home, where malnutrition\nand illness, obstetric complications, and harmful birth practices of traditional birth attendants\n(TBAs) and relatives often result in maternal disabilities and deaths that could have been\nprevented  if  basic  quality  obstetric  care  was  available.  About  18  percent  of  women  use\ninstitutions for childbirth. These women do not always receive quality care, which discourages\ninstitutional delivery. About 20,000 Pakistani women die from maternal complications each year,\nand one third of women suffer an obstetric disability. In 1997, the maternal mortality ratio\nestimate ranged from 340 to 600 per 100,000 live births.9 Rural women are at much greater\nrisk(cid:190) the maternal mortality ratio is often twice as high in poor rural communities. Childbearing\nbegins at an early age, when the risk of maternal complications is very high. Abortions and\nviolence against women also contribute to maternal mortality.\n10. About 450.000 million infants of the 5 million born each year die before reaching their\nfirst birthday. The infant mortality rate has fallen from 137 per 1,000 live births in 1960 to 89 per\n1,000 live births in 1998,10 but this is still high compared with 15 per 1,000 live births in Sri\nLanka.11 One quarter of all children are born with low birth weight, mainly due to maternal\nmalnutrition. About half of infant mortality occurs within one month after birth, and is closely\nrelated  to  maternal  care.  Respiratory  infections  and  diarrheal  diseases  cause  most  infant\ndeaths. Childhood diseases like tetanus and measles are declining as immunization coverage of\nwomen and infants has reached respectively 31 and 45 percent.\n11. In addition to limited acceptance of FP and neglect of women's RH needs, the emerging\nacquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) threat and other STDs have created the impetus\nto target men in RH programs. Males and adolescents know little about prevention of STDs. The\nWorld Health Organization estimates that there are about 80,000 human immunodeficiency\nvirus (HIV) carriers in Pakistan.12 In the absence of adequate control efforts, 2-5 percent of the\n                  \n8  Government of Pakistan, National Institute for Population Studies. 1997.

Since the 1950s, the RH sector has progressed through several distinct phases. It\nstarted with the provision of services through female paramedics, followed by the introduction of\nthe FP program, the expansion of rural health services, and mass media education. Community-\nbased services first developed in the 1980s through lady health visitors (LHVs) on an outreach\nbasis, followed by training of TBAs and family health workers (FHWs) form the local community.\nThe current approach aims to increase access to RH care through FHWs; making quality\nemergency obstetric care (EmOC) available; education of males; NGO support; and social\nmarketing. A summary of the RH sector is in Appendix 3.\n13. The impact of population programs in the first four decades was less than expected. In\naddition  to  an  initial  public  resistance  against  modern  FP  methods,  there  were  some\nprogrammatic issues: (i) weak political commitment, (ii) frequent policy and structural changes,\n(iii) lack of an integrated service delivery approach, (iv) exclusive focus on married women as\nthe target group, (v) limited coverage of services, (vi) interference of local leaders, (vii) weak\ngovernance, and (viii) inadequate investments.\n14. A noticeable change in FP appeared in the 1990s, with stronger political commitment,\nmore funds, better governance, and the introduction of FHWs. But efforts in making motherhood\nsafer met with far less success. First, safe motherhood requires effective services at various\nlevels in the health system and cannot be addressed on a campaign basis. Second, because\nmaternal mortality affects mainly poor rural women at home, it has not received priority from\nleaders and health services managers. Growing awareness of the suffering of these women(cid:190)\nfor  every  maternal  death,  30  more  women  become  disabled(cid:190) and  the  socioeconomic\nconsequences of their disability or death in poor households led to an increasing Government\ncommitment to reach poor women to make motherhood safer. At the same time, there is greater\npublic openness and concern about the increase in RTIs, STDs, and adolescent health.\n15. MOPW is responsible for population policies and the PWP. The PWP is implemented\nthrough the PPWDs in each of the four provinces, and in federal areas and institutions directly\nunder MOPW. PPWDs have not been established as full provincial departments, but this may\nchange  as  federal  staff  is  currently  being  transferred  to  the  provincial  administration.  The\ndelivery system includes 1,688 family welfare centers, 266 RH services centers, and 131 mobile\nservice units. It also included 12,072 female village-based family planning workers (VBFPWs)\nthat  have  been  transferred  to  the  NPFP.  The  1,052  male  VBFPWs,  responsible  for  male\neducation on FP, remain with the PWP. Each family welfare center, managed or headed by a\nparamedic family welfare worker, offers FP counseling, nonsurgical contraceptives, and MCH\ncare for about 6,000 people. A token amount is charged for contraceptives. The RH services\ncenters provide surgical and clinical contraception. Twelve regional training institutes provide\nclinical training; and three population welfare training institutes, nonclinical training.\n16. MOH is responsible for health policies and operates eight federal programs, including\nthe NPFP and five tertiary hospitals. PHDs operate in the four provincial governments. Their\ncombined  delivery  system  includes  918  district  and  subdistrict  hospitals,  559  rural  health\ncenters,  4,718  basic  health  units,  935  MCH  centers,  and  dispensaries.  In  each  province,\npromotive, preventive, and curative health services are delivered through a four-tier system:\nFHWs at community level, primary care facilities at union council level, first referral hospitals at", "5\nsubdistrict and district levels, and tertiary hospitals and other services at provincial level. The\nGovernment has combined the 43,000 lady health workers and 12,072 female VBFPW into\nFHWs under the NPFP. The FHW carries out registration, counseling, minor treatment, FP\nservices, and referral. She visits households each month in a catchment population of up to\n1,000. Further integration of RH services of is being planned.\n17. On 14 August 2001, the Government established the district government and devolved\npowers to the district government through the promulgation of the Local Government Ordinance\nby all the provinces. The district government will appoint a district executive officer (health) who\nwill be responsible for managing the district health and population team (DHPT) including all\nhealth and population welfare services in the district. This is likely to become fully effective by 1\nJuly 2002 under the proposed name of District Health Group.\n18. The private sector accounts for nearly two thirds of all health expenditure and is largely\nurban-based,  providing  curative  services.  A  small  percentage  of  private  practitioners  offer\ncomprehensive RH service to both females and males, and less than 2 percent received FP\ntraining  in  the  past  three  years.  The  NGO  sector,  almost  nonexistent  at  the  time  of\nindependence,  has  steadily  grown  over  the  years,  particularly  the  last  two  decades.  It  is\nestimated that there are now more than 16,000 NGOs: the majority of them are working at the\ncommunity level, about 25 percent at the subdistrict or district level, and about 5 percent at the\nnational level. Some of them supplement public sector efforts with RH advocacy, education, and\nservices.  In  1994,  the  Government  established  an  autonomous  umbrella  organization,  the\nNational Trust for Population Welfare. It has supported about 200 NGO proposals for FP\nservices. Two social marketing projects, \"Key\" and \"Green Star\", have made some progress in\nproviding contraceptives but their market shares remain small.\n4. Health Sector Financing\n19. In 1992, the Government initiated the SAP to address the serious neglect of the social\nsectors. Among others, this was done by increasing government expenditure on social services.\nThe first phase of the SAP (1992-1996) achieved its expenditure and performance targets in the\nhealth and population welfare sector. At present, the Government is implementing the second\nphase (1997-2002). However, the second phase coincided with a series of external events\nkeeping Pakistan in a fiscal crisis. The drastic shortfall in federal revenue transfers caused a\nsharp drop in provincial expenditures. SAP expenditures remained relatively protected, but full\nprotection of SAP expenditures became impossible. As a result, social sector expenditures that\nhad increased during Social Action Program (Sector) Project (SAPPI) stagnated during the\nSecond Social Action Program (Sector) Project (SAPPII), including the nonsalary expenditures,\nthereby affecting the quality of services.\n20.   After the SAPPI period, public health sector spending has been persistently low at about\n0.8  percent  of  gross  domestic  product.  The  Public  Sector  Development  Program  2000/01\ncosting PRs120.5 billion allocated PRs14 billion for basic health services, including PRs2.2\nbillion for PWP. This is about $2 of public health spending per person per year, compared with\nan estimated total private expenditure of $6 per person per year, and a requirement of at least\n$12 per person per year.13 The financing of the RH sector showed a somewhat more positive\ntrend until recently. The PWP allocation doubled between 1993/94 and 2000/01, and spending\nin the RH sector was further increased by the NPFP, resulting in a fourfold increase in public\nspending on RH.\n                  \n13 Government of Pakistan, Federal SAP Secretariat. 2000. Restructuring of the Social Action Program. Islamabad.", "6\n21.  During  the  8th  five-year  plan  (1993-1998),  the  aid  agency  share  was  32  percent.\nFollowing the closing of ADB and World Bank population projects in December 2000, most\nexternal assistance for the RH sector is through SAPPII, currently financing 40 percent of the\nPWP and 20 percent of the NPFP, and due to close in June 2002. Due to the Government's\nacute fiscal constraints, the 2001/02 budget for the PWP is only PRs1.6 billion instead of the\nprojected PRs2.6 billion needed to sustain program efforts. The NPFP also shows a 30 percent\nshortfall. Through SAP, efforts are being made to increase allocations this fiscal year, including\na \u00a35.2 million grant ($7.3 million equivalent) from the Department for International Development\n(DFID). The Government is planning to increase the PWP budget to PRs3.0 billion next year.\n5.  Key Issues\n22. High  mortality  and  disability  of  women  and  infants,  and  high  fertility  result  from  a\ncombination of early pregnancy, lack of birth spacing, malnutrition, violence, abortion, poor\nhygiene, late referral, and unavailability of appropriate and affordable services. The underlying\nfactors are well known(cid:190) ignorance, low social status of women, limited mobility, poverty, weak\ngovernance, and resource constraints. These need to be addressed at community, services,\nand governing levels. The following issues directly affect RH status:\n(i)  Commitment and capacity for RH. The Government's commitment to women's\nhealth and population control has not been assimilated at lower levels (e.g., like\nfor  polio  eradication),  and  districts  are  not  assessed  in  terms  of  their  RH\nperformance. The sector has been fragmented, lacking an overarching RH policy\nframework, funding, and capacity at provincial and district levels, resulting in\nweak effort in the RH subsector. Based on the national policy framework for RH,\nthe introduction of the RH approach provides an opportunity to develop provincial\nRH programs with improved quality of services and an integrated referral system.\nUnclear  responsibilities,  weak  management  skills,  and  financial  constraints\nbecome even more pertinent with devolution and need to be addressed.\n(ii)  Range and quality of services. Many of the primary care facilities designed and\nequipped to provide routine maternal care and FP services do not provide these\nservices  due  to  mismanagement  and  staff  constraints.  Typically,  female\nparamedics assigned to MCH and FP assist medical officers with curative work,\nand medical officers pay little attention to RH. The staff lack skills in counseling,\ncase management, and rational use of drugs and diagnostics. Their services are\nirregular due to social and communication constraints.\n(iii)  Access for the poor. Half the population, particularly those in rural areas, do not\nhave  access  to  FHWs  providing  RH  care.  Access  to  obstetric  emergency\nservices  is  poor  as  only  few  hospitals  provide  such  services  regularly.  The\ncapacity for surgical contraception, a very popular method, is inadequate. The\npoor often cannot afford services due to a shortage of supplies in public facilities.\n(iv)  Male's  attitude.  Males  often  lack  awareness  of  women\u2019s  health  needs.\nTraditional  local  leaders  and  males  often  restrict  the  mobility  of  women,\nparticularly in seeking access to FP and obstetric surgical services.\n(v)  Unbalanced human resource development. Human resources do not match to\nthe health needs of the population. There are four times as many doctors as", "7\nfemale paramedics, which should be the reverse. Although, private universities\ncontinue to increase, they are inadequate in preparing doctors for primary health\ncare (PHC), in particular RH. Paramedical schools use outdated curricula and\nequipment and provide little skills training.\n(vi)  Involving NGOs and the private sector. The Government\u2019s long-term policy is\nto support NGOs in providing RH services. However, the Government has so far\nprovided little support for NGOs, and NGOs are reluctant to take Government\ncontracts.  The  institution  assigned  to  contract  NGOs  has  had  governance\nconstraints. There are no RH policy and regulatory guidelines for the private\nsector. Meanwhile, about 50 NGOs are interested in expanding RH services with\nGovernment incentives, and private practitioners are interested in RH training.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n23. Since the 1950s, the Government has been implementing various policies to address the\npoor  health  status  of  women  and  children  and  high  population  growth  through  MCH/FP\nprograms (Appendix 4).14 The policies show distinct phases: (i) providing static MCH services\nthrough female paramedics, (ii) introducing selective FP programs, (iii) posting doctors in rural\nareas, (iv) adding outreach services, (v) expanding health infrastructure, (vi) training TBAs, (vii)\nimproving obstetric services, (viii) introducing community-based workers, (ix) increasing support\nfor NGOs, and (x) introducing social marketing.15 While the Family Planning Association of\nPakistan started services as early as 1953, the role of NGOs has remained small.\n24. These frequent policy changes reflect initial problems with achieving impact. It took time\nto develop support for women\u2019s health and fertility regulation in a nonconducive environment.\nThere was inadequate political commitment and support among leaders. Frequent changes in\npolicies and structures reduced implementation efforts. Plans did not consider how difficult it is\nfor women to travel and work in isolated places, while doctors lacked interest in FP services.\nAfter substantial investments in training TBAs, it was realized that it was difficult to change their\nbehavior even with proper training and support. The lack of an integrated approach resulted in\nFP services not being available in the large network of health facilities. Leadership in the sector\nkept  changing  and  weak  management  affected  staff  productivity.  Inadequate  funding  and\nlogistics resulted in shortages of drugs and contraceptives.\n25. In the 1990s, the overall climate for women\u2019s health and FP became more conducive.\nThe  Government  formulated  policies  to  respond  to  the  1994  International  Conference  on\nPopulation and Development, for incorporation in the 9th five-year plan (1998-2003). MOPW and\nMOH jointly formulated a national vision and package for RH services in Pakistan.16 MOPW\nadopted a comprehensive population and development policy, aimed at broadening the scope\nof services for a transition from FP services to the RH approach, without losing focus on fertility\ncontrol.  The  present  Government  expresses  great  concern  about  the  implications  of  high\npopulation  growth  for  poverty  and  economic  development.  It  seeks  to  reduce  fertility  and\nmaternal and infant mortality rates, and promote gender equity and women empowerment. On\nWorld Population Day, 11 July 2000, the chief executive admonished the nation to address the\npopulation explosion on a war footing; and devise strategies to bring down the population\n                  \n14The focus of MCH/FP programs is on maternal and child care and family planning.\n15Ministry of Planning and Development, Planning Commission.

He announced a broad framework for national\npopulation planning and RH policy.\n26. The interim poverty reduction strategy of the Government17 proposes the reorganization\nof the district health offices, consolidation of the PHC network, integration of vertical programs,\npromotion  of  child  spacing  as  a  component  of  RH  services,  improvement  in  hospital\nadministration and financial management, and regulation of the private sector and the sale of\ndrugs. Long-term policy measures include redefining the role of the various levels, and cost\nrecovery and subsidy for the poor. Strategies include strengthening the PHC network including\nFP services, replicating the Women's Health Project, training and retraining staff, public-private\npartnership, autonomy for teaching hospitals, and involving civil society in governance in the\nhealth sector. The national health policy18also gives high priority to RH services.\n27. Based  on  the  RH  approach  of  integrating  FP  with  health  services,  and  promoting\nwomen\u2019s  health  status,  the  Government  has  defined  an  RH  services  package  of  nine\ncomponents and a constellation of services to be adopted over the next 10-15 years. The\nTechnical Working Group on RH formed under SAP has identified four components of the\npackage as priorities during the 9th five-year plan (1998\u20132003), including the most cost-effective\ninterventions addressing the needs of the poor.19 These are FP, maternal health and safe\nmotherhood, infant health care, and RTIs and STDs. Strategic priorities are targeted public\neducation,  increasing  coverage  of  FHWs,  integrated  health  and  FP  services,  training  of\nmidwives, and emergency obstetric care.\n28. The Government is currently undertaking major institutional reforms in the RH sector.\nThe initial plan to merge MOH and MOPW into one ministry of health and population welfare\nhas been put on hold and is under review by a Government committee. MOPW is moving\ntoward further integration with social services and women's development. At the provincial level,\nservices will continue to be integrated. The community-based lady health workers (LHWs) and\nfemale VBFPWs have been merged into FHWs under the NPFP. The provinces would like to\ntake  over  the  PWP  and  the  NPFP,  but  cannot  do  so  due  to  financial  constraints.  The\nGovernment has agreed to decentralize these programs while continuing to finance them during\nthe next plan period, as part of the provincial RH programs. While this reflects strong political\ncommitment to the sector, such commitment has not been matched by financial resources\n(para. 21).\n29. The situation is further complicated under the Government\u2019s devolving policy of power.\nDevolution to the district level took place in August 2001, with transfer of many provincial\nfunctions to the districts. Each district government will be given a block grant, part of which is to\nbe used by the DHPT for health and population welfare. In principle, it is up to the district to\ndecide how to spend the funds, although initially there will be certain directives for spending in\neach sector. As the province will have no direct control, it may be reluctant to get involved in\ndistrict priority setting. Regulations, procedures, and guidelines for the district government are\nstill being developed and are expected to be in place by 1 July 2002.\n                  \n17 Government of Pakistan, Poverty Reduction Cell, Planning Commission, and Policy Wing, Finance Division. 2001.\nInterim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP).

ADB  has  been  supporting  the  health  and  population  sector  through  six  projects,\nincluding one population project, three health sector projects, and two integrated social sector\nprojects. Assistance from other funding agencies includes support for the PWP, projects in\nMOH, and RH activities in the private and NGO sectors (Appendix 5). The PWP, with a total\nbudget  of  PRs2.6  billion  in  FY2001,  is  receiving  mainly  external  assistance  from  SAPPII\nsources,  UN  agencies,  and  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA).  Due  to  a\nshortfall in external assistance and a fiscal crisis in FY2001, SAPPII finances 40 percent of the\nPWP  and  20  percent  of  federal  MOH  programs  with  RH-related  activities  (programs  for\nimmunization,  LHWs,  health  education,  HIV/AIDS  control,  and  malaria  control).  However,\nSAPPII financing will stop in June 2002. JICA recently completed a hospital in Islamabad for\ntraining and referral services. The World Bank and DFID are funding the Northern Areas Health\nProject ($27 million). ADB, United Nation\u2019s Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and the Organization of\nPetroleum-Exporting Countries support the Women\u2019s Health Project (footnote 2). This project\nsupports the development of 20 women-friendly district health systems; it also supports federal\nprograms, human resource development, and NGOs targeting these districts.\n31. Several  bilateral  sources  are  providing  assistance  that  directly  complements  the\nProject's activities in the RH sector. ADB maintains close coordination with these sources. DFID\nis assisting NGOs to provide RH services and social marketing of contraceptives (\u00a312 million,\n$17 million equivalent). The Kredietanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau has also financed social marketing.\nThe European Commission (EC), through the Rural Social Development Program, is assisting\nfive umbrella NGOs and the EC/United Nation\u2019s Population Fund (UNFPA) initiative for RH\n($2.8 million). The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) assists NGOs through a\nsmall-scale Women-in-Development Project (Canadian $5.2 million). JICA plans to expand RH\nactivities countrywide, targeting the poor through local NGOs. DFID, EC, the United States\nAgency for International Development, and others are planning to increase support for the NGO\nsector.\n32. ADB also maintains close cooperation with the UN agencies involved in RH. UNFPA\naims to enhance the RH status of women, men, and adolescents; promote RH and reproductive\nrights,  gender  equity,  and  equality;  and  achieve  sustainable  development.  UNICEF  has\nlaunched a Women's Health Program to create awareness about people\u2019s responsibility for\nsaving women from unnecessary deaths, enhance women's status and self-esteem, provide\nEmOC, and train birth attendants. UNICEF in Sindh Province is upgrading safe motherhood\nservices in two districts with the support of the Bill Gates Foundation.\n33. Among  other  benefits,  SAP  provided  a  mechanism  for  better  aid  coordination  and\ntargeting. UN agencies and JICA also participated in SAP aid coordination meetings. During\nSAP missions, it became evident that there was a major gap in financing the RH program,\nparticularly after the close of SAPPII in June 2002. The Government requested ADB to support\nthe RH sector. The provinces requested ADB to target those districts not receiving any external\nassistance for RH so far, including many of the poorer districts. The coordinating mechanisms\nestablished under SAP will be maintained even after the close of SAPPII.", "10\nD.  Lessons Learned\n34. According to the sector synthesis,20 the designs of ADB-financed health and population\nprojects21 were generally in line with the Government's priorities and programs, and appropriate\nin scope and strategies. The projects had a strong focus on improving access to basic health\nservices for the poor, women, and children; and training of female health staff and managers.\nThe evaluation noted further that merely providing health facilities was not sufficient to improve\ncoverage, and more attention should have been given to district management and training.\nMore recent projects present an integrated health systems development approach based on in-\ndepth analysis of institutional constraints and efforts to address the shortfall through policy and\ninstitutional reforms, capacity building, and partnerships.\n35. Implementation problems caused on average two years of project delay. The project\nperformance  audit  report  of  the  Second  Health  and  Population  Project22  noted  several\nproblems:  (i)  lack  of  preparedness  of  the  Government  agencies  concerned,  (ii)  lack  of\nmanagement  skills  and  understanding  of  ADB  procedures,  (iii)  frequent  transfers  of  key\npersonnel, (iv) lack of aid agency cooperation, and (v) slow implementation of civil works.\nProject Directors were appointed late and transferred frequently, and often lacked competency\nand authority. The SAPPII midterm review in 2000 observed that the limited staff capacity at\nprovincial and district levels is slowing down program implementation.\n36. A review of other external assistance identified a number of critical factors that improve\noutcomes: strong political commitment, alignment with the Government's core program, building\na  pool  of  public  health  professionals,  access  to  technical  assistance,  streamlining  of\nadministrative procedures, and incentive packages. The sustainability of project benefits largely\ndepended on (i) Government commitment, (ii) the level of incremental costs of projects, (iii) the\ninclusion of these costs in the regular budget, and (iv) the continuing presence of adequately\ntrained staff. The project design provides several actions to mitigate delays and improve project\nquality. The Project will enhance management capacity by training, delegating responsibilities,\nstrengthening RH Directorates, and providing additional staff inputs.\n37. Regarding RH, the projects show that FHWs are effective, and that it is possible to\nrecruit them from traditional communities. Communication strategies have generally also been\nsuccessful. However, the fact that the district executive officer (health) and medical officers in\ncharge of health facilities often do not give priority to MCH/FP services has hampered the\nimpact of MCH/FP programs. Therefore, a strong institutional commitment to RH is essential.\nRH projects should be an integral part of district health system development. This will also\nimprove  the  sustainability  of  RH  interventions.  The  international  aid  community,  urgently\nseeking  results,  has  shifted  to  a  revival  of  vertical  programs  for  the  control  of  infectious\ndiseases, resulting in a fragmented and unsustainable campaign approach to resolving public\nhealth  problems.  It  is  important  that  the  Government  and  funding  agencies  adhere  to  an\nintegrated PHC approach in Pakistan.\n                  \n20Asian Development Bank. 1997.

ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n38. ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy23 recognizes human capital as the primary asset of the\npoor, and its development as of fundamental importance in the war against poverty. It states\nthat every person must have access to basic education and PHC. It emphasizes the correlation\nbetween  family  size  and  self-perpetuating  poverty,  and  promotes  enhancing  the  quality  of\nwomen's lives by giving priority to providing accessible RH services. The Project addresses the\nthree core pillars of the strategy: it is targeting RH services for the poor, which will help them\nimprove their livelihood. ADB's poverty reduction strategy also emphasizes that denial of basic\nservices to the poor is not just a matter of lack of investment, but often a result of governance\nproblems  and  lack  of  participation  by  the  poor.  The  strategy  promotes  sound  public\nadministration  and  expenditure  management  to  promote  pro-poor  growth  and  social\ndevelopment; and devolution of public services to the lowest appropriate level of government.\nThe Project contributes to improving governance and devolving services.\n39. ADB's country assistance plan for Pakistan's health sector focuses on (i) improving\npublic  sector  governance  and  efficiency  by  strengthening  management  and  public-private\npartnership, and (ii) increasing equity by improving access of women to quality health services.\nIn addition, ADB's focus on girls' education offer important opportunities for synergy.\n40. In line with ADB's health policy, ADB's approach in the health sector is threefold.24 First,\nit aims to ensure that the poor and vulnerable have access to PHC. Pakistan's PHC network is\nquite extensive. However, women have less access to PHC and carry the burden of high\nfertility. Therefore, ADB focuses on improving women's health, including RH, while other funding\nagencies provide complementary support for control of communicable diseases. Second, it aims\nto improve governance, efficiency, and sustainability in the health sector through health sector\nreform, including support for integration of services, devolution, public-private partnership, and\nprivate  sector  regulation.  Third,  it  aims  to  improve  the  quality  of  project  design  and\nimplementation  through  a  health  systems  approach,  district  level  participatory  planning,\nmanagement capacity building, and monitoring and evaluation including district surveys. These\npriorities are reflected in the project design.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n41. ADB  has  been  in  continuous  dialogue  with  the  Government  on  programmatic  and\ninstitutional strategies to improve the RH sector. Through SAP and directly, ADB staff have\nmaintained dialogue with the ministries, provinces, funding agencies, and other agencies on RH\nissues. ADB is supporting a long-term RH consultant25 who serves as the secretary to the\nTechnical  Working  Group  for  RH  of  SAP.  ADB  has  been  assisting  with  development  of\nprovincial RH policies and programs. These programs would combine Government and aid\nagency inputs into a comprehensive RH approach for each province. The Project has been\ndesigned to support the development of these provincial policies and programs.\n42. The Government's Ten Year Perspective Plan (2001-2011)26 promotes integration of\nhealth and FP services, primarily because FP has become more acceptable and combined\nservices are more efficient.

Integration of health and FP services\nwas initiated through combined annual operational plans under SAP. ADB has also highlighted\nthe risks of integration that need to be mitigated, including possible loss of focus on FP. The\nintegration of FP services within the larger domain of health services requires prior action in\nbuilding the capacity of RH Directorates, DHPTs, and health services.\n43. ADB has been discussing options to safeguard financing of RH activities at the district\nlevel.  Under the devolution, district governments have been given administrative and financial\npowers to assume many of the functions previously held by the provinces. The role of the\nprovincial level will eventually be limited to ensuring good governance, policy and technical\nguidance, training, monitoring and resource mobilization. The implementation of RH activities\nwill depend on the district government\u2019s political priorities. ADB has been discussing ways to\nsafeguard health services including RH, targeting allocations and performance standards. The\nProject will help to promote, manage, and finance RH services in the devolved system.\n44. ADB has been promoting the rationalization of the package of RH services, so that\nlimited public resources are used for the most cost-effective interventions benefiting mainly the\npoor. A broad-based planning process has resulted in a rationalized RH package including\nfamily planning, maternal care, infant care, control of RTI and STDs, and related education. This\nis to be made available to the entire population.\n45. Compared  with  FP  services  and  control  of  infectious  diseases,  safe  motherhood\nservices are seriously neglected. ADB has also supported Pakistan through a regional technical\nassistance to strengthen the safe motherhood approach.27 ADB and UNICEF are currently\ndiscussing with MOH and MOPW how to further develop safe motherhood policies within the\nframework of the RH approach, which hinges on birth preparedness, timely referral, and access\nto  quality  EmOC.  MOH's  commitment  to  redress  these  imbalances  is  increasing.  The\nGovernment  is  highly  concerned  about  harmful  practices  of  untrained  TBAs  and  unsafe\nabortions that continue to contribute significantly to maternal mortality. The Government wants\nevery birth to be attended by a skilled person. ADB has proposed that FHWs who have done\nwell be given the opportunity to become a domiciliary midwife or enter the career development\nsystem of LHV and public health nurse. Within the public health services, the shortage of female\nstaff is created partly by a limited number of positions for female staff, and by the fact that some\nof these positions are being occupied by male staff. Adding a female paramedics in each rural\nfacility would help reduce female staff absenteeism, and improve 24-hour coverage and social\nacceptability.\n46. ADB and the Government have been discussing the pricing of contraceptives. The\nGovernment carries the burden of paying for contraceptives used in the public services. While\nexpenditures for contraceptives are currently reimbursable under SAPPII, there is no definite\nplan for financing contraceptives after SAPPII closes in June 2002. The chronic shortage of\ncontraceptives in the vast network of health services is partly due to a policy difference between\nMOPW and MOH in pricing contraceptives. MOPW's policy is to charge a nominal fee for\ncontraceptives to improve accountability. PHDs provide contraceptives free. This issue has\nbeen brought to the attention of the Government, which, in view of the high level of poverty in\nrural communities and urban slums, decided to allow FHWs to provide contraceptives free of\ncharge at grassroots level.\n                  \n27TA 5825-REG: Strengthening Safe Motherhood Programs, for $700,000, approved on 24 December 1998.", "13\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n47. Pakistan's rapid population growth at the rate of 2.3 percent per annum has exacerbated\npoverty and negated the impact of development in the last decade. While fertility is declining, it\nhas the potential to accelerate given the high unmet demand for FP. Health status indicators\nhave not improved much over the past decade. The maternal mortality ratio is still very high due\nto poor birth practices at community, primary, and hospital levels. Much more work is needed at\nall levels to make motherhood safer. Better maternal care would substantially reduce infant\nmortality, including that caused by infections and malnutrition.\n48. The Government accords high priority to improving the poor health status of women and\nchildren, and reducing high population growth. It seeks to accelerate the pace of fertility decline,\nintroduce quality RH services, and promote gender equity and women empowerment. It is\nstrengthening its RH policy, particularly for safe motherhood. The Government plans a transition\nfrom separate FP and MCH services to the RH approach to improve the acceptability and\nefficiency  of  RH  services.  The  Government  gives  priority  to  expanding  RH  in  poor  and\nunderserved  districts,  and  involving  NGOs  and  other  stakeholders.  The  Government\u2019s\ncommitment to RH has been demonstrated by a significant increase in its funding for RH in the\npast decade.\n49. The Project is targeting 34 districts in the third and fourth quartiles in terms of social\nranking, excluding those targeted by other projects. At least 50 percent of project beneficiaries\nwill be poor. The proposed interventions are simple, inexpensive, and cost-effective; they will\naddress the needs of the poor and support sustainable development. ADB has successfully\nassisted the Government's PWP to achieve the targets for the 8th five-year plan. Recurrent cost\nimplications after project completion are estimated at only 2 percent of the Government's health\nbudget. The project design is in line with ADB's poverty reduction strategy, policy for the health\nsector, and country strategy.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n50. The overall goal of the Project is to improve the RH status of families, reduce maternal\nand infant mortality, and reduce population growth. The Project will contribute to improving\nwomen\u2019s health and social status and reducing poverty. The objectives are to: (i) improve the\nquality, access and acceptance of RH services in 34 poor and underserved districts, and (ii)\nstrengthen the sector\u2019s capacity for RH services in the context of the Government\u2019s restructuring\nprocess, including though NGOs and the private sector.\n51. The Project will be implemented nation-wide, with focus on 34 selected districts in 4\nprovinces (10 in Punjab and 8 each in Balochistan, North-West Frontier Province and Sindh).\nSix components will address the project objectives:\n1. Improve the Quality of RH Services\n52. The Project will improve the quality of RH services by introducing the RH package,\nproviding  in-service  training,  and  integrating  services.  With  the  assistance  of  the  technical\nworking group, the Project will develop the RH package and delivery system into a skills-based\ntraining program. Consulting services will be provided for developing standard RH practices and", "14\ncurricula, and training of trainers. The Project will provide in-service training for LHWs, male\nVBFPWs, midwives, LHVs, family welfare workers, and female and male medical officers, and\norientation of other staff in the targeted districts. The in-service training will be use modern\nteaching  methodologies  with  substantial  hands-on  practice.  The  training  will  focus  on  FP,\nmaternal health including safe motherhood, infant health, and management of RTI including\nHIV/AIDS. The Project will also introduce a standardized technical and managerial supervision\nsystem, with logistic support for monitoring and field supervision. The Project will upgrade basic\nEmOC services in 250 rural health centers and subdistrict hospitals. It will also assist about\n2,500 basic health and population welfare facilities in the targeted districts with minor repairs\nand supplementary equipment and supplies.\n2. Improve Access to RH Care for the Poor\n53. The Project will improve access at community and hospital levels. The Project will train,\nsupply, and supervise 4,400 female and 1,200 male FHWs in the targeted districts. Twenty-\neight mobile service units will be added and 19 will be refurbished for areas where women\u2019s\nmobility is restricted and where it is difficult to operate facilities. The Project will add 33 RH\ncenters  and  upgrade  8  RH  centers  to  respond  to  the  increasing  demand  for  surgical\ncontraception. Only 20 percent of hospitals in the project area provide 24-hour comprehensive\nemergency  obstetric  services.  In  each  district,  one  hospital  will  be  upgraded  to  provide\ncomprehensive EmOC. The referral system will be promoted and made more user-friendly\nthrough better marketing.\n3. Promote RH for Specific Target Groups\n54. The Project will promote awareness of RH needs and services, and create a more\nconducive environment through advocacy among specific target groups using interpersonal\ncommunications (IPC), group media, and mass media. The Project will revive the Federal\nCommunication Advisory Group to implement the IEC component, assist funding agencies to\ncomplement each other\u2019s work, adopt common themes and standardize messages, and utilize\nresources in the most effective manner. The Health Education and Nutrition Cells in the targeted\ndistricts will be supported with training in new IEC methods, materials and operational support.\n55. The Project will develop IPC skills of FHWs and health staff through on-the-job training,\nand provide IEC materials and support services through the district health and nutrition officers.\nA telephone hotline will be introduced at the district level. Religious scholars and male FHWs\nwill discuss RH-related issues with local leaders and males. Group media activities will include\n\u201cvideo on wheels\u201d based on successful experiences in other countries. The activity will be\ncarried out in collaboration with \"town storming\", a multimedia marketing strategy used for\nadvocacy among local leaders, men, women, and adolescents. Commercial spots will be used\nduring shows to help offset the costs. FHWs, in collaboration with local NGOs, will organize\nward meetings. Private sector firms will produce videos on different topics for these ward\nmeetings, which will be dubbed in six local languages. Audio/video materials developed by\nNGOs will also be acquired and used. As television and radio also reach the low-income\npopulation, these mass media will be used to convey information regarding FP, EmOC, and\nother RH issues. The Project will support three formats: short spots, songs, and drama serials.\nRadio producers from the 18 radio stations in Pakistan will be trained in producing RH spots and\nprograms for radio broadcast.", "15\n4. Strengthen RH Management Capacity\n56. The Project will assist the Government to strengthen the planning, management, and\nmonitoring of RH services, within the context of integration of services, decentralization to the\nprovinces,  and  devolution  to  the  districts.  The  federal  and  provincial  joint  coordination\ncommittees will provide guidance and each steering committee will oversee implementation.\nThe Project will strengthen the federal and provincial directorates of RH and project coordinating\nunits (PCUs) with consulting services, staff, training, and logistics to support implementation in\ndistricts and training institutions, and plan a comprehensive RH program in each province. It will\nalso strengthen the health education directorates through fellowships.\n57. The Project will support the DHPT in each targeted district through additional staff,\ntraining, and technical support. Guidelines and training material developed under the Women's\nHealth Project will be used to conduct district surveys, prepare five year and annual plans, and\nprovide training for the district and subdistrict management teams in planning, procurement,\nlogistics, monitoring, and personnel and financial management. A project cell in the district\nhealth office, with a full-time planning/procurement officer and an accounts assistant, will serve\nas the project implementation unit at district level.\n5. Develop Human Resources for RH\n58. The component will strengthen the preservice training capacity for health staff concerned\nwith RH services. The Project will upgrade 12 midwifery schools in the targeted districts, and\nsupport 2,000 students from underserved areas to attend midwifery school.  The Project will\nimprove 23 public health schools to improve the training of LHVs. Trainers will be trained in\nmodern teaching methodologies, evaluation techniques, curriculum development, IPC skills, and\nhands-on supervised clinical training. In addition, new sites for practical training will be identified\nsuch as subdistrict hospitals, to improve skills training. Adequate facilities, equipment, transport,\nfurniture, and supplies will be made available as needed. The Project will upgrade 3 population\nwelfare training institutes for training of male VBFPWs in RH management; and add 3 and\nupgrade 7 regional training schools for training in clinical RH services. The training of LHWs will\nbe relocated from PHC centers to subdistrict hospitals to improve skills training.\n6. Harnessing NGO and Private Sector capacity\n59. The Project aims to use the potential of NGOs and the private sector to expand RH\nservices. The Project will provide training and supportive activities to 2,500 private practitioners,\n4,000 female paramedics, and 8,000 drug shopkeepers to expand and improve the quality of\nRH  services.  A  large  number  of  NGOs  are  providing  RH  services  including  advocacy  for\nwomen\u2019s  status  and  rights,  community  mobilization,  human  resource  development,  health\neducation and communication, preventive and curative RH services, and social marketing of\ncontraceptives. Studies have shown that the poor are paying for emergency services (mostly for\ndrugs that are out of stock), at the \"free\" public sector facilities,28 and are willing to pay at private\nsector facilities near their homes, provided the charges are reasonable.29 Through established\nNGOs, the Project will support contracting of NGOS to expand RH services in the targeted\ndistricts, including social mobilization and education activities, training, contracting of staff,\n                  \n28 TA 2576-PAK: Public Private Health Partnership in Health, approved on 31 May 1996 for $ 450,000 (JSF).  \n29Faisel, A. 1998.

MOPW may contract a coordinating NGO or make any\nother arrangements to the satisfaction of ADB to administer the contracting of implementing\nNGOs. The component will also support capacity building of NGOs and innovative activities.\nC. Cost Estimates\n60. The total cost of the Project including physical and price contingencies, and taxes and\nduties, is estimated at $45.0 million equivalent, comprising a foreign exchange cost of $15.7\nmillion equivalent (35 percent), and local currency cost of $29.3 million equivalent (65 percent).\nTable 1 summarizes the cost estimates by component.

Financing Plan\n61. It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of SDR28,454,000 ($36 million equivalent) from\nits Special Funds resources to finance up to 80 percent of the total project cost (Table 2). This", "17\nwill cover the total foreign exchange cost, and an estimated $20.3 million equivalent in local\ncurrency cost (69 percent of the total local currency cost). The term of the proposed loan will be\n32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1.0 percent per annum\nduring the grace period, and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter. CIDA, DFID, and UNFPA\nindicated their interest in supporting project implementation through separate contributions for\nconsulting  services,  curriculum  development,  and  medical  and  contraceptive  supplies.  The\nGovernment will finance $9.0 million equivalent of the project cost. During the project period, the\ncounterpart funds for federal programs will continue to be paid from the federal budget in case\nfederal programs are decentralized to the provinces.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total Percent\nExchange Currency Cost\nADB 15.7 20.3 36.0 80\nGovernment 0.0    9.0 9.0 20\nTotal 15.7 29.3 45.0 100\n      Source: ADB estimates.\n62. The provision of financing for the local currency cost is considered justified under ADB\u2019s\nlocal currency financing policy.30 Assistance is required to meet the local currency cost of\ndevelopment projects because public finance is under serious pressure, and a low level of per\ncapita income constrains national savings. The Government has taken steps to improve the rate\nof  national  savings  by  enhancing  revenue  collections,  improving  the  efficiency  of  public\nexpenditure, improving incentives for private sector participation in revenue-generating capital\nmarket  reforms,  and  encouraging  private  sector  participation  in  revenue-generating  public\nsector projects. However, the current international crisis has significantly increased the resource\ngap, which will continue for some time due to a slowdown in large capital investments.\n63. From a technical perspective, the financing of local currency costs is also justified. RH\nservices under the Project disproportionately benefit the poor, but involve few foreign exchange\ncosts. Most inputs required for RH services are locally available, and thus the foreign exchange\ncost is modest.\nE.  Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Project Management\n64. At federal level, a joint coordination committee will meet quarterly to provide overall\npolicy  and  program  guidance  aiming  at  expanding,  improving  the  quality,  integrating  and\ndecentralizing RH services. The committee will be co-chaired by the secretaries health and\npopulation welfare and include representation of the ministries of finance and planning and\ndevelopment,  the  provinces,  and  civil  society.  Each  province  will  have  a  provincial  joint\ncoordination committee for policy and program guidance, which will meet quarterly. It will be\nchaired by the additional chief secretary or chairperson of the planning board and include\nrepresentatives of the departments of finance and planning and development, districts and civil\n                  \n30Asian Development Bank. 1995. R1-95: A Review of Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditure on\nProjects.  ", "18\nsociety. At district level, the DHPT will be advised by its district government. The organization\nchart is in Appendix 7.\n65. In view of the Government's decentralization policy, there will be six executing agencies\n(EAs): at federal level, MOPW and MOH, and four PHDs, one in each of the 4 provinces. Each\nEA will have a steering committee that meets at least once a month to review project activities\nunder the responsibility of the EA and take steps to improve implementation. Each EA will be\nstrengthened with a PCU to coordinate project implementation with ADB and the concerned\ndistricts, directorates, programs, and institutions. Staff for each PCU will include a full-time\nproject coordinator (reporting to the director of RH or equivalent), a training expert, an accounts\nofficer, and a monitoring officer (all with qualifications and experience acceptable to ADB). A\nproject implementation unit will be established in each PPWD, with a project implementation\nofficer and an accounts officer. MOPW will be responsible for overall coordination.\n66. As the basis for devolved project implementation, each DHPT will prepare five year and\nannual district health plans, with the support of the PHD and PPWD. The concerned joint\ncoordination committee will approve the district plans. The district plans will specify RH activities\nin the district, including advocacy, education, training, services, rehabilitation, procurement, and\nmonitoring. Each DHPT will have a small project cell with an assistant project coordinator and\naccounts assistant to coordinate and monitor project implementation activities.\n67. Each EA has its responsibilities in supporting the districts to develop RH services.\nMOPW will be responsible for developing population welfare and RH training institutions, media\nactivities, curriculum development, contracting NGOs, and major civil works. PPWDs will be\nresponsible for upgrading their clinical and nonclinical services, male VBFPWs, and private\nsector  training.  MOH  will,  through  NPFP,  work  with  the  targeted  districts  to  increase  the\ncoverage and improve the quality of LHWs. PHDs will upgrade primary and hospital EmOC\nservices and improve the training of midwives, paramedics, and doctors.\n2.  Implementation Schedule\n68. The Project will be implemented over six years, from January 2002 to December 2007.\nThe implementation schedule is in Appendix 8.\n3.  Procurement of Goods and Services\n69. All procurement for the ADB-financed portion of the Project will be in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The project coordinators of the PCUs will be responsible for\nprocurement  under  the  guidance  and  supervision  of  the  concerned  steering  committee.  A\nprocurement  consultant  will  assist  the  project  coordinators.  The  PCU  will  (i)  propose  bid\npackages and procurement methods; (ii) prepare detailed materials lists and specifications; (iii)\nwhere  applicable,  determine  prequalification  criteria,  evaluation  criteria,  and  completion  of\ndelivery  periods;  and  (iv)  evaluate  bids  and  certify  payments.  The  project  coordinator  will\napprove contracts and certify payments. Where required, copies of contracts and supporting\ndocuments will be forwarded to ADB for record and if necessary for approval. Detailed needs\nassessment will be done before initiating any civil works or procurement of equipment.\na.  Civil Works\n70. The Project will upgrade hospitals for EmOC and RH services, and improve training\nfacilities. As all civil works contracts under the Project will be small in value, scattered, and", "19\nunlikely to attract the interest of international contractors, they will be packaged, and awarded\non the basis of local competitive bidding in accordance with Government procedures acceptable\nto ADB. Civil works contracts costing less than $50,000 may be awarded by force account\nprocedures of the respective EAs. Government engineers will prepare the plans for civil works.\nThe packages will be prepared based on the district plans.\nb.  Equipment and Materials\n71. Related equipment and material will be combined into packages to simplify procurement.\nSupply contracts costing more than $500,000 will be procured by international competitive\nbidding procedures. Supply contracts of $500,000 equivalent or less will follow international\nshopping procedures, except for vehicles and basic equipment and supplies for health facilities\nand  training  institutions  such  as  hospital  beds  and  furniture.  These  items  are  locally\nmanufactured  and  unlikely  to  attract  foreign  suppliers,  and  will  be  procured  through  local\ncompetitive bidding in accordance with Government procedures acceptable to ADB. Equipment\nor  materials  costing  less  than  $100,000  per  item  may  be  procured  by  direct  purchase.\nEquipment and materials costing less than $1,000 may be procured by the DHPT according to\nGovernment procedures acceptable to ADB.\nc. Consulting Services\n72. The Project will support about 30 person-months of international, and about 180 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services, to be contracted through a firm. The international\nconsultants (person-months) will include a training specialist (6); an IEC specialist (6); a health\nmanagement  specialist  (6);  a  financial  management  specialist  (6  person-months),  and  a\nmonitoring  and  evaluation  consultant  (6).  The  domestic  consultants  will  include  the  chief\ntechnical adviser (60), an IEC specialist (24), a training specialist (48), a procurement specialist\n(12), a financial management specialist (18), and a monitoring and evaluation consultant (18).\nInternational and domestic consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB's\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other procedures acceptable to ADB for recruiting\ndomestic consultants. The consultants may be attached to any PCU, but support all EAs. ADB\nhas agreed to the Government's request that the international consultants collaborate with the\ndomestic consultants. To ensure timely recruitment of consultants, the Government will prepare\nthe  invitation  to  bid  before  loan  effectiveness.  The  indicative  terms  of  reference  for  the\nconsultants are in Appendix 9.\nd. Contracting of NGOs\n73. MOPW will award prequalified implementing NGOs with a contract to provide expansion\nof RH services according to the Government's local competitive bidding procedures acceptable\nto ADB. The contract will be based on a defined package of services proposed by the DHPT in\na particular district. The packages will generally be small, costing less than $100,000 per\ndistrict, and will be awarded according to Government procedures acceptable to ADB. The\npackages will include all necessary details to enable the implementing NGOs to make a fair\nassessment of the amount of work, and the Government to assess NGO performance. The\nsteering committee of MOPW will evaluate the proposals and award the contracts to the NGOs.\n74. In view of limited capacity of the Government to administer NGOs, MOPW will contract\ncoordinating  NGOs,  or  make  any  other  arrangement  acceptable  to  ADB,  to  carry  out  the\nadministrative processing for the selection of these implementing NGOs to expand RH services.\nThe coordinating NGO may be a national or international firm with suitable qualifications. The", "20\nresponsibilities of a coordinating NGO may include to (i) assist districts to prepare packages for\ncontracting  out  to  NGOs;  (ii)  provide  orientation  for  interested  NGOs;  (iii)  propose  the\nprocedures, criteria and documentation for the prequalifying, selecting and monitoring NGOs;\n(iv)  validate  NGO  capacity;  (v)  manage  the  contracting  procedures;  (vi)  provide  technical\nassistance and training; and (vii) monitor and report performance of NGOs. The coordinating\nNGO  will  be  appointed  through  the  Government's  local  competitive  bidding  procedure\nacceptable to ADB. The coordinating NGO will maintain accounting and auditing standards\nacceptable to the Government and ADB.\n4. Accounts and Audit\n75. The Government and provinces, acting through MOPW, MOH, and PHDs, will maintain\nrecords and accounts adequate to identify goods and services financed from the proceeds of\nthe loan. The district health offices will also maintain separate accounts for project activities\nfollowing  the  same  standards.  Under  the  devolution  plan,  procedures  and  guidelines  in\nproviding  targeted  funds  to  the  district  are  available.  The  Government  will  ensure  full\ncompliance  with  the  guidelines  for  devolved  financial  management,  to  be  issued  by  the\nGovernment, in each province and district. The Government will hire an international and a\ndomestic  financial  management  specialist  at  the  start  of  the  Project  to  bring  the  project\naccounting system up to accounting standards acceptable to the Government and ADB, with\nsufficient internal control, and accounting and financial reporting systems in the first project\nyear. In each PCU, a suitably qualified and trained accounting staff will be made available for\nthe Project. In each district, accounting standards will be verified before allowing use of the loan\nproceeds, and checked regularly. All EAs will ensure that accounts and financial statements are\naudited by auditors acceptable to ADB. In view of the dispersed scope of the Project, the EAs\nwill submit to ADB certified copies of audited accounts and financial statements, and the report\nof the auditor on these, not later than 12 months after the close of each fiscal year.\n5. Disbursement Procedures\n76. To expedite project implementation, imprest accounts will be made available to the six\nEAs to provide cash advances for small expenditures. ADB will initially deposit an amount\nbased on the estimated expenditures of six months and not exceeding $250,000, into an\nimprest account with the State Bank of Pakistan or a commercial bank acceptable to ADB under\nthe  authority  of  MOPW,  MOH,  and  each  PHD.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  established,\nmanaged, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook\nof January 2001, as amended, and with detailed arrangements agreed by the Government and\nADB. The statement of expenditure procedure may be used for reimbursing eligible local and\nforeign expenditures not exceeding $50,000 per expenditure, and to liquidate advances made\ninto the imprest accounts in accordance with the same guidelines. Because project activities will\ntake place in dispersed geographic areas where communication is difficult, simple mechanisms\nare  required  to  disburse  small  funds  quickly  through  decentralized  decision  making  while\nmaintaining acceptable levels of financial control. Accordingly, subaccounts will be established,\nand managed in the districts and institutions, following the same guidelines. The initial amount\nin these district and institution accounts will not exceed $10,000. The EA will provide funds to\nthe subaccounts at districts and institutions according to annual plans approved by the steering\ncommittee. The fund transfer mechanism will be finalized after January 2002 when the general\nadministrative  rules,  regulations,  and  guidelines  for  devolved  financial  management  are\nexpected to be in place.", "21\n6. Reporting\n77. The PCU will prepare quarterly monitoring reports and submit them to ADB within one\nmonth of the end of each quarter. The reports will include (i) progress made, including aspects\nof quality; (ii) delays and problems encountered, and actions taken to resolve the issues;\n(iii) compliance with loan covenants; (iv) proposed program of activities and inputs required\nduring the next three months; and (v) maintenance and repairs. Each district and institution will\nreport to the PCU. The Government will also provide the baseline and end-of-project survey\nreports in the second and sixth year of the Project. Within three months of physical completion\nof the Project, the Government will submit to ADB a project completion report. The report will\ninclude the costs and compliance with loan covenants.\n7. Midterm Review\n78. In addition to regular reviews, the Government and ADB will jointly undertake a midterm\nreview  of  the  Project  after  three  years  of  implementation.  This  will  be  preceded  by  a\nGovernment review led by MOPW, and will involve discussions with field staff and beneficiaries.\nThe report will indicate progress toward quantitative and qualitative targets, and likely project\nimpact and sustainability. The midterm review will appraise the project scope, cost estimates,\nimplementation arrangements, and compliance with loan covenants; and identify any issues to\nbe addressed to improve project impact and sustainability. The Government and ADB will jointly\ndecide on any changes needed in the design and implementation of the Project.\n8.  Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n79. Benefit monitoring and evaluation will play an important role in the success of the Project\nby helping it to remain focused on project performance and impact. In keeping with ADB\u2019s\nHandbook on benefit monitoring and evaluation, a small set of input, process, output, coverage\nand impact indicators has been selected to establish district baselines and targets. These data\nwill be collected using the regular monitoring system and surveys. The chief technical adviser\nand the monitoring and evaluation expert will supervise project evaluation. A summary of the\nbenefit monitoring and evaluation process and indicators is in Appendix 10.\n80. The districts, with support of PCUs, will carry out baseline and end-of-project household\nsurveys in years 2 and 6 of the Project to obtain coverage and impact performance. These\nsurveys will also serve general district health planning purposes for the district government. To\nassess whether project benefits are reaching the poor, data will be collected to construct a\nwealth index. The household surveys will use the methodology and organizational approach\nused for the Women's Health Project, and use standardized indicators allowing comparison with\nother surveys.  Simple health services surveys will also be carried out in years 2, 4 and 6 to\nobtain basic information on the resources and use of services, which will help, identify priorities\nfor improving service delivery and procurement.\n81. The existing management information systems will be used for routine monitoring. They\nwill be improved as needed. The information systems will track project inputs and service\nprocesses and outputs, aggregated by district. The supervision system will track performance\nand quality of service using a standardized checklist of indicators. Client satisfaction will be\nmonitored  through  surveys,  supervision  visits,  and  group  discussions.  The  districts  will  be\nresponsible for collecting data and reporting to the Government and ADB.", "22\n9. Good governance\n82. The Mission explained the ADB anticorruption policy, particularly the section on fraud\nand corruption, as stated in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants.\nF. The Executing Agency\n83. MOPW, MOH and PHDs have gained experience in project implementation in previous\nADB projects in the health and population sector. MOH and PHDs are currently implementing\nthe Women\u2019s Health Project. Staff with training and experience in ADB procedures are available\nat federal and provincial levels. Transfer of project coordinators has become less frequent. The\nGovernment  has  given  assurance  that  capable  project  staff  will  be  appointed  in  a  timely\nmanner.  Under  the  devolution  plan,  the  Government  supports  the  delegation  of  financial\nauthority to the DHPT. The Government has given the assurance that competent staff will be\navailable at district level to coordinate project implementation and manage the accounts.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environment\n84. The Project will have minimal adverse environmental impact. The Government assured\nthat the site, design construction, and operations for any improvements made to the physical\nfacilities  under  the  Project  will  follow  the  Government's  own  guidelines  and  ADB's\nEnvironmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects. The Government will ensure that\nproper waste disposal is included in the design of health facilities. Measures for handling refuse\nand disposing of hazardous medical waste, e.g., syringes and needles, will be specifically\naddressed in the design and operation of all health facilities. The Project will provide training\nand guidelines for provincial and district health office staff to ensure proper medical waste\nmanagement in all health facilities under their responsibility. In the medium to long term, the\nProject will have beneficial environmental impact through population control, as has been shown\nin estimates of international environmental agencies.\n2. Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n85. The Government will ensure that any government-owned land used for construction\nunder the Project does not involve any involuntary resettlement. In the event such land has a\nsquatter settlement, the Government will address the concerns of the squatter population in line\nwith ADB's policy on involuntary resettlement.\n3. Social Analysis\na. Poor People\n86. About 50 percent of the population in the targeted districts are poor. The poor cannot be\ndetermined by location or clan, but by the socioeconomic conditions of the household. Poor\nfamilies are found in any village, so low-cost services are needed in each village. About two\nthirds of Pakistan\u2019s population do not have access to adequate basic infrastructure.31 Poor\n                  \n31Asian Development Bank. 2000. Reducing Poverty in Pakistan: Priorities for the Asian Development Bank.", "23\nvillage people form a major part of the population without access to health services or FHWs.\nThis is further discussed in the social assessment and action matrix (Appendix 11).\nb. Traditional Communities\n87. Among traditional rural communities, the strong influence of religious leaders on the\nsocial and moral acceptability of FP hinders the use of RH services. The fear of negative stigma\nand  apprehensions  over  sideeffects  are  major  reasons  for  men's  nonacceptance  of\ncontraceptives. In particular, poor and illiterate mothers face the husband\u2019s opposition to RH\ncare including FP. Couples\u2019 contraceptive use often depends on whether they have a son.32\nEven if delay in EmOC does not lead to a fatal outcome, it often results in lifelong disabilities of\nthe  mother  and  the  child.  The  Project  includes  several  strategies  to  face  these\nconstraints(cid:190) media campaigns, IPC with religious leaders and male VBFPWs, improving access\nto LHWs, subsidy for essential drugs and contraceptives, and marketing of services.\nc. Ethnic Minorities\n88. Ethnic  minorities  including  Hindus  and  Christians  constitute  only  5  percent  of  the\npopulation. These minority groups are generally not restricted in terms of female mobility, have\naccess to RH services, and often receive some form of support from NGOs or aid agencies. The\napproach to providing services to these minorities is to make the project efforts suited to the\nculture and conditions of the local community, e.g., education programs in the local language\nand tradition; training of minority community members as FHW and midwife; and providing\nmobile clinics where it is difficult to post female staff. DHPTs will be instructed to address the\nissues of ethnic minorities in the district plan.\nd. Gender Aspects\n89. The  Project  primarily  addresses  women\u2019s  health  and  nutrition  status  through\ninterventions targeted at women. Family health improvements resulting from the Project will also\nbenefit women by reducing the risk and burden of pregnancy and delivery, and the time spent\ncaring for family members. Women's social status would benefit from educating males and\nhealth staff. Also, the Project will primarily target female health staff, and provide employment\nfor 4,400 village women. Scholarships will be available to help village women get additional\nbasic education if required before technical training. Health centers will be modified to provide\nprivacy for women during examination and treatment. Gender issues will be incorporated in the\ntraining courses. Women\u2019s use of health services will be monitored with specific indicators. The\nproject management will seek to appoint female staff.\ne. Stakeholder Participation\n90. Stakeholders were extensively consulted and involved during the preparation of the\nProject. There were discussions with 500 beneficiaries, health staff, and officers through field\nstudies, workshops and meetings, covering all provinces. Results of group discussions with\nbeneficiaries in catchment areas of previous health sector projects were used in the project\ndesign.  This  information  was  supplemented  with  a  household  survey,  which  provided\ninformation on health service availability, health-seeking behaviors, and financing of disease\nepisodes. Major health projects were reviewed and discussed with external funding agencies,\n                  \n32 Mahmood, N. and D. Nayab. 1998. Gender Dimensions of Demographic Change in Pakistan. The Pakistan\nDevelopment Review 37(4):705-725.", "24\nincluding issues relating to project management and lessons learned. Teams visited targeted\ndistricts, consulted with local officials, and conducted a detailed needs assessment. Finally, the\neconomic  affairs  division,  planning  and  development  departments,  MOPW,  MOH,  PHDs,\nPPWDs,  and  50  NGOS  provided  substantial  guidance  for  the  project  design.  During\nimplementation, beneficiaries will participate in (i) advising on the health services, (ii) selecting\nand supporting FHWs, (iii) health promotion activities, and (iv) giving poor families access to\nhealth services, including EmOC. Project evaluation will consult beneficiaries through focus\ngroup discussions and surveys.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Financial and Economic Analysis\n1. Financial Analysis\n91. The Project has been designed to support the Government\u2019s efforts to contain public\nsector expansion and recurrent costs. The Project supports basic integrated health and FP\nservices, focusing on the most cost-effective interventions. The civil works have been limited to\nupgrading and rehabilitating existing facilities. Three types of incremental recurrent costs are\nnecessary,  namely  (i)  contracting  FHWs  to  reach  populations  not  reached  so  far;  (ii)\nsupplementing the supply of essential drugs and contraceptives, partly paid for by households;\nand (iii) improving the quality of services. The result will be better utilization and more efficient\nuse of existing infrastructure and human resources. However, a sustained increase in budget\nallocation for salaries, supplies, training and supervision will also be needed. The total recurrent\nexpenditure for maintaining activities after project completion is estimated at 2 percent of total\npublic health expenditure.\n92. Arrangements are in place to sustain the modest increase in recurrent costs resulting\nfrom the Project and to increase sector spending for RH: (i) a policy framework giving high\npriority  to  RH,  (ii)  the  follow-up  to  a  SAP  framework  to  improve  financing  of  basic  social\nservices, and (iii) several policies to improve efficiency in the health sector. The Project will also\nsupport RH promotion and capacity building in the RH directorates to increase sustainability.\nSAP has given high priority to nonsalary allocation, which has increased in all provinces to\nabout one third of the total recurrent allocation. The Project also supports the Government\u2019s\nefforts to improve efficiency by devolving federal and provincial responsibilities to the districts.\nThe merger of female VBFPWs and LHWs will also improve efficiency. An increased focus on\npromotive and preventive services should reduce the burden on curative services. Public-private\ninitiatives such as training of private practitioners and NGO support will help develop nonpublic\nservices.\n2. Economic Analysis\na. Public Sector Intervention\n93. Public investment in RH services can be justified in terms of efficiency and equity. Equity\narguments in favor of subsidized health services are strong in Pakistan, where income and\nexpenditure surveys suggest that about one third of the population live below the poverty line.", "25\n94. The provision of services by the public sector, in addition to their financing, is justified in\ncases where either private provision is inadequate, the public sector is a more efficient provider,\nand/or consumers exhibit a clear preference for public services. The Pakistan Fertility and\nFamily Planning Survey, 1996/97, shows that 72 percent of clients obtained contraceptive pills\nfrom the private sector outlets, while 60 percent sourced the pills from the public sector, 20 from\nsocial marketing, and 20 from the commercial sector. Similarly, 37 percent of clients obtained\ninjections from the private sector, and 4 percent from NGOs, but 91 percent of the injections\nwere financed by the Government. This suggests that the public sector has an important role in\nfinancing contraceptives, while the private sector is important in delivering them. However, this\nbalance needs to be understood in terms of market and institutional constraints. For rural areas,\nthe public sector will continue to have an important delivery function in the near future.\n95. The private sector often does not provide a full range of RH services; and the costs are\nsubstantially higher than in the public sector. However, given the limited public sector capacity,\nthe private sector, wherever it is capable of providing goods and services in an efficient and\ncost-effective manner, should be encouraged, and the possibility of public subsidies considered.\n \n96. It appears that a higher proportion of the poor perceive RH problems as less important,\ndespite their being more common among the poor. In view of the population\u2019s low willingness\nand ability to pay, and with the profit-motivated private sector providing the services, it is feared\nthat the real \u201ctarget class\u201d i.e., the poor class, will be marginalized and the relatively affluent\nclasses, mostly residing in urban centers, will be served. Thus, to ensure wider coverage of\nservices for the rural poor, direct public service delivery is required.\n97. If the public sector invests directly in RH service delivery rather than merely depending\non regulation, it will not only address the issue of poverty reduction, but also improve equity by\nreducing rural/urban imbalances. Gender balance, too, will improve as RH interventions address\nwomen's health besides promoting female employment.\nb. Justification for Increased Funding\n98. The level of public sector funding is concerned with the requirements to meet public\npolicy objectives and the existing capacity of the public sector delivery system.33 The budget for\nPWP is relatively small, and the budget for RH activities under the PHDs is not much larger.\nGiven the large unmet needs of RH in the sector, a substantial increase in allocations is\njustified. In view of the current tight fiscal situation in the provinces, the federal Government has\nagreed to continue financing the federal programs during the next plan period.\n99. The overall rate of utilization for the population and health sector allocations was above\n80 percent during the 1990s. Devolving the administrative and delivery system is expected to\nimprove program effort. This will include procurement of drugs and contraceptives. Making\nallocations available early in the fiscal year will also improve absorptive capacity and efficiency.\nc. User Charges\n100. The share of health care expenditures in the total household budget, about 3 percent,\nremains  low  across  income  groups.  The  low-income  classes  in  Pakistan  dissave,  i.e.,  on\naverage, spend more than their incomes. This reflects their very low ability to pay for more, or\n                  \n33 All activities related to the population welfare sector are treated as development expenditure.", "26\nmore expensive services. The average monthly expenditures on health care increase as income\nlevels rise, reflecting that people want to pay for more or better health care if they can afford to.\n101. The estimated cost of protection against conception for one year per couple is low.  The\nmonthly price of oral contraceptive pills, condoms, intrauterine devices, and depot injections are\nonly PRs3.00 in the public sector, reflecting a policy of subsidy for contraceptives.34 Imposition\nor increase of user charges on social services is a major issue in Pakistan. It is not known\nwhether raising the price of RH services will affect the users' ability to pay, and significantly\nreduce demand. MOPW suggests that a small fee may increase the use of services as people\nexpect to receive better services. While RH services are provided at nominal costs, clients often\nhave to purchase their own medicines and other supplies. As reported by one study, delivering\nin a Government facility costs on average PRs590 compared with the average nominal charge\nof PRs24, as patients have to purchase their own medicines from private drug stores. NGOs\nand private clinics were found to be more expensive.35\n102. The rationale is strong for not increasing user charges for the services assisted by the\nProject. The Project is targeting poor and underserved rural women. While families may be\nwilling to pay for medical expenses, these may not be within the household budget, or may\naffect other essential expenditures like for food. Because of the low social status of women, they\nmay be denied services if user charges are increased. Costs attached to using public health\nservices such as transportation, medicine, and informal charges are already substantial. Given\nthe low level of public confidence in services at present, a substantial increase in user charges\nis likely to result in reduced utilization of services and efficiency. Experience has shown that\ncost recovery in these conditions can barely cover the administrative costs. Therefore, while\nincreasing  user  charges  may  have  potential  benefits  in  terms  of  improving  ownership,\naccountability, and transparency, it may have adverse effects on the poor, and will not help in\nfinancing health services. In this context, the social benefits of providing the service to low-\nincome groups most certainly outweigh the efficiency gains from cost recovery.\nd. Cost Effectiveness\n103. In health projects, an alternative approach in estimating project benefits is the disability\nadjusted life years approach. This approach involves the construction of a composite index of\nthe years of health life lost due to disease, disability, or death, and the benefits that can be\nachieved by saving those lost years. Based on the available data for RH diseases, the cost per\ndisability adjusted life years saved was calculated as $21. This is considered cost-effective by\ninternational standards (Appendix 12).\nB. Social Dimensions and Poverty Impact\n1. Poverty and Health\n104. There is a strong relationship between poverty and health. In the poorest households,\neven basic health care may not be affordable. Any serious illness including chronic diseases like\ntuberculosis or conditions requiring hospitalization, and any loss of labor that reduces the\nfamily\u2019s production capacity will result in food shortage and impoverishment. Access to quality\nhealth services provided under the Project will not only reduce direct and indirect costs of health\n                  \n34Multi-donor Support Unit, Social Action Programme. 2000.

", "27\ncare, but decrease workdays lost due to disease and increase productivity. Further, savings in\nhousehold expenditures may help to reduce food shortages, and overcome income fluctuations\nthat may result in loss of assets, bonded labor, and migration. The very poor include single\nparents, parents with many young children, and families with chronically ill or disabled persons.\n2. Targeting the Poor\n105. The Project aims to help overcome the gap in RH services for the poor by improving\naccess to quality RH services in the least developed districts. Using a participatory approach, 34\nrural districts were selected on the basis of social ranking (districts in the bottom and third\nquartiles in terms of socioeconomic development), low ratio of female FHWs, and availability of\nexternal assistance.36 In addition, the Project will target the poor: (i) focusing on providing basic\nservices where the poor are more likely to capture the benefits of Government subsidies, (ii)\nselectively investing in services that directly support RH; (iii) addressing RH conditions that\ndisproportionately  affect  the  poor;  and  (iv) identifying,  setting  targets,  and  monitoring  the\nProject\u2019s impact on the very poor through local committees and surveys. It is expected that\nmore than 50 percent of the project beneficiaries will be poor (see Appendix 11).\n3. Demand for RH Services \n106. Despite an increasing awareness about health and health services, a significant number\nof these women either do not get health care or seek traditional means of health care. About 50\npercent of the women, most of them living in small villages, do not have access to basic health\nservices such as a LHW providing education, FP, and basic medical care. Many couples want to\nuse modern contraceptives, but find services unavailable within their vicinity. While poverty can\nincrease the vulnerability to RH risks, ignorance and misconceptions about RH-related issues\noften aggravate existing problems. Delay in using health services is often caused by lack of\nawareness about women\u2019s health needs and risks. These attitudes of the husband and family\ntowards pregnancy, emergencies and hospitals often cause delays. Restrictions on the mobility\nof women due to purdah (seclusion) are based on sociocultural and religious traditions. In more\nrural areas, lack of motorized transport is a major problem. Concerns about the costs and\nopportunity costs of health services are also an important factor.\nC. Benefits\n107. The Project will target the poor and underserved populations in both rural and urban\nareas nationwide. The targeted districts are most of Pakistan\u2019s poorest districts from the bottom\nand third quartiles with the poorest socioeconomic indicators and a majority of poor people.  The\nProject will cover 42 million people, including 7.7 million women of reproductive age and one\nmillion infants.\n108. The target groups, particularly women and infants, will benefit from increased awareness\nabout RH issues and better medical care at home (through well-trained LHWs), at the health\nfacilities, and at the hospitals (through 24-hour EmOC). Contraceptive prevalence will rise,\nfertility levels will fall, and both maternal and infant morbidity and mortality rates will decline. The\nprevalence of anemia and incidence of STDs will decrease. The Project will directly benefit\nabout one third of the population in the targeted districts; reduce the burden of disease for poor\nwomen and infants by 10-30 percent depending on the type of intervention; prevent 11,000\n                  \n36 Ghaus, A and H.

", "28\nmaternal deaths, obstetric disabilities in 150,000 women, and 1 million unwanted births; and\nsave 100,000 infants.\n109. Through  social  mobilization,  advisory  services,  and  education,  the  Project  aims  to\nreduce neglect and abuse of women, and help improve the quality of their life. The better health\nand productivity of women will contribute to women empowerment, and educational, financial\nand social benefits. This will lead to better health care for children and greater incentives for\ngirls' education. The Project will improve gender sensitivity of health staff to female staff and\npatients, and of the general public to female staff.\n110. The Project will provide employment to 4,400 LHWs and 1,200 male VBFPWs; pre-\nservice training to 2,000 midwives, and in-service training to all health staff and community\nworkers in the targeted districts.\n111. Complementary  to  the  Women\u2019s  Health  Project,  the  Project  will  accelerate  the\nintegration of MOH and MOPW, and introduce RH services operating within the framework of\nthe devolution plan to strengthen the district health system. The Project supports capacity\nbuilding in the targeted districts under the devolved set up. It will aim to strengthen management\nstructures at the district level; and strengthen coordinating, monitoring, and supply systems at\nprovincial levels. The Project\u2019s interventions will bring radical changes in pre-service training of\nFHWs and paramedics. It will upgrade training capacity in district and subdistrict hospitals,\nmidwifery and public health schools, regional and population welfare training institutes, and\nmedical colleges.\n112. The Project is highly cost-effective. The improved health status and fertility reduction of\nthe target population will increase economic productivity and contribute to poverty reduction.\nThe Project will contribute to improving equity by reducing gender, income, rural-urban, and\ninterdistrict imbalances.\n113. The  Project  will  have  a  beneficial  environmental  impact  through  its  contribution  to\nreducing rural population growth. Health education on sanitation and waste disposal is also\nexpected to improve living conditions, reduce pests, and contain the spread of diseases.\nD. Risks\n114. Pakistan\u2019s social sector spending has been adversely affected by slow economic growth,\nlow revenue collection, and declining external assistance. The persistent drought in Balochistan\nand Sindh has seriously affected the living conditions of the poor. A sharp drop in foreign\ninvestment followed the terrorist attack on 11 September 2001. The Government and provinces\nare  facing  an  acute  fiscal  crisis  for  a  combination  of  reasons,  including  the  decline  in\ninvestments and exports, drought, refugees, and a shortfall in revenues. Encouraged by aid\nagencies, the Government, however, is determined to give high priority to the social sector.\n115. While the Government is not planning to expand the network of facilities, it is currently\nnot spending enough to adequately operate the network and finance better services. Improving\nthe quality of care will result in higher recurrent costs as it will increase utilization rates, and\nincrease unit cost per patient for quality inputs. The Government's exposure to health sector\nspending is very modest at about 0.8 percent of gross domestic product. The Government will\nhave to increase this percentage in the years ahead, or reduce the network of services and\nstaff.  An  analysis  of  the  counterpart  fund  requirements  suggests  that  the  recurrent  cost\nimplications of the Project are as low as 2 percent of sector spending, mainly for new FHWs.", "29\nThe Government is also working on improving efficiency, e.g., through devolution and hospital\nautonomy. ADB is providing advisory technical assistance to develop a master plan for health\nsector reform in NWFP.37 As the provincial governments are facing a tight fiscal situation, the\nprovincial contributions have been kept low, and the federal government will continue financing\nthe federal PWP and NPFP.\n116. Pakistan is in a major social and governance transition. Devolution of powers to the\ndistrict, which requires new administrative procedures, took place in August 2001. Under the\ndevolved structure, the district government initially may not give high priority to RH. Religious\ngroups may object to promoting RH interventions like FP and education of adolescents, unless\nthe  interventions  fully  recognize  and  respect  local  sociocultural  and  religious  values.  The\nGovernment has made a commitment to protect social sector spending, and provide districts\nwith targeted funds for RH. The design of the Project provides powerful incentives to bring RH\ninto the mainstream of district health activities, such as media campaigns, support for the district\nplanning  process,  and  a  substantial  district  budget  for  RH  activities.  The  Project  will  help\nincrease  district  management  capacity,  provide  service  standards,  and  monitor  district\nperformance.\n117. Sector changes may also affect project implementation. The Government has postponed\nthe merger of MOPW and MOH into one Ministry of Health and Population Welfare and has\nplaced this proposal under a review committee. Progress is being made at the provincial level,\nas MOPW has started transferring its field staff to the provincial administration. The Project is\nplaced within the RH directorates, to ensure mainstreaming and sustainability of the project\nactivities. The impact of training is often diluted due to frequent transfer of staff, but this is\ncountered by training all staff in the targeted districts, as the staff are usually rotated within the\ndistrict. Staff performance has been affected due to limited career opportunities and incentives,\nand  because  working  in  rural  areas  is  socially  and  financially  less  attractive  to  staff.\nImprovement in governance and devolution are expected to improve staff performance.\n118. Contracting of NGOs by the Government has been slow. The Project provides for a\ncoordinating NGO to help administer the contracting of NGOs. Most NGOs working in the RH\nsector require capacity building in planning, management, and accounting if working with the\nGovernment and ADB. Capacity building is being provided through SAPPII and projects of\nseveral aid agencies and international NGOs. However, the coordinating NGO will also provide\nproject orientation, training, and technical support to the districts and NGOs.\nVI.  ASSURANCES\nA. Specific Assurances\n119. The Government and the provinces have given the following assurances, in addition to\nthe standard assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  Within three months after loan effectiveness, each PHD will establish a PCU\nwithin  the  RH  directorate  or  equivalent  with  adequate  staff  including,  at  the\n                  \n37 TA3386-PAK: Health Sector Reform in North-West Frontier Province, for $ 500,000, approved on 29 December\n1999.", "30\nminimum, a project coordinator, a training officer, an accounts officer and a\nmonitoring and evaluation officer.\n(ii)  Within three months after loan effectiveness, each PPWD will establish a project\nimplementation unit with adequate staff including, at the minimum, a project\nimplementation officer and an accounts officer.\n(iii)  Within six months after loan effectiveness, MOPW will engage a core team of\nconsultants including the chief technical adviser.\n(iv)  Within nine months after loan effectiveness, each province will ensure that the\nDHPT in each district covered by the Project will prepare a five-year health plan\nto improve RH, for the approval of the concerned Joint Coordination Committee\n(JCC) and ADB.

Condition of Loan Effectiveness\n120. MOPW will establish a PCU at the federal level and appoint adequate staff in the PCU,\nincluding, at least, a full-time project coordinator, an accounts officer, and a monitoring and\nevaluation officer, all with qualifications and experience acceptable to ADB.\nVII.

Demography. Pakistan's population has increased fourfold since independence in 1947.\nMales have outnumbered females in all censuses, however, a slow but constant change has\nbeen noted, from 117 males per 100 females in 1951 to 108 males per 100 females in 1998. A\nsteady fall in mortality since the 1950s has led to substantial improvement in life expectancy at\nbirth, especially for females, with an increase from 48.7 to 64.6 years between 1962-1965 and\n1996, compared to males from 52.4 to 63.9 over the same period. The average age at first time\nmarriage increased from 17 years in 1951 to 22 years in 1997 for females, and from 22 years in\n1951 to 26.5 years in 1997 for males.1\n2. Fertility. The  change in Pakistan\u2019s fertility  has remained slow in earlier decades as the\ntotal fertility rate remained above six births per woman for almost three decades. However, a\ndeclining trend has become evident, especially over the last decade. The estimates indicate that\nthe total fertility rate at present is 4.8 compared with 7.1 in 1965-1969 (in Bangladesh, total\nfertility rate is currently 3.7). The observed decline in fertility rate is closely related to changes in\nthe desired and ideal family size. Available data shows a systemic decline in the perceived ideal\nfamily size from 4.9 children in 1984-1985 to 3.6 in 1994-1995. A preference for a son partially\naccounts for the current average of 4.2 children per married woman.\n3. Infant Mortality. Infant mortality rate fell from 137 to 89 deaths per 1,000 live births in\nthe first year of life in 1960-1999. Currently, about 400,000 infants die each year in Pakistan.\nAbout 59 percent of deaths occur in the first month.2 Largely preventable causes of infant death\nin the first month are prematurity, growth retardation, low birth weight, asphyxia, birth injuries,\nand infections of the newborn including neonatal tetanus. About 25 percent  of infants are born\nwith low birth weight, due mainly to maternal malnutrition. In the remaining 11 months, poor care\nof acute respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases remain the major causes of death.\n4. Maternal Mortality. The maternal mortality ratio was 340 per 100,000 live births in 1994,\nand varied from 286 per 100,000 live births in the squatter settlements of Karachi to 630 per\n100,000 live births in Balochistan, a province with a high proportion of small and isolated\nvillages at great distance from health services.3 The maternal mortality ratio is not expected to\nhave changed much since then. Women at increased risk of maternal mortality and morbidity\nare young and first-time mothers, mothers with five or more deliveries, and those with poor\npregnancy history. Other medical risk factors are malnutrition and smoking. Social risk factors\nare illiteracy, poverty, induced abortion, and violence against women associated with about 14\npercent of maternal deaths. However, all pregnant women are at risk from complications in\npregnancy, childbirth, and postnatal period such as bleeding, hypertension, obstructed labor,\nand sepsis.\n5. Maternal Disability. Most maternal mortality is avoidable and results from delay in\nappropriate care\u2014delays in decision making for referral, transportation to appropriate facilities,\nand  treatment  at  the  facility.  Most  maternal  complications  can  be  managed  with  routine\nprocedures at primary or first referral level, which explains the extremely low maternal mortality\nratio in developed countries. Poor management of maternal complications contributes to the\n                  \n1 National Institute for Population Studies (NIPS). 1997.

One  third  of  adult  women  in  rural  communities  have  permanent\ndisabilities including prolapse  incontinence, fistula, and chronic infections.\n6. Abortion. Abortion is a highly underestimated problem in Pakistan. A hospital-based\nstudy found that 11 percent of maternal deaths were due to abortion. While wealthy women\nhave access to professional assistance for illegal abortion services, poor women invariably seek\nthe assistance of traditional birth attendants (TBAs). These untrained women often employ\ndangerous techniques resulting in often fatal complications such as bleeding, uterus perforation,\nand sepsis.\n7. Maternal Malnutrition. Anemia is common, affecting about one third of the women.4\nIodine deficiency affects up to half of women in rural communities causing mental impairment in\ntheir offspring.\n 8. Reproductive Tract Infection (RTI). The prevalence of RTI in both sexes is not known,\nbut is estimated to be high. Women are at a higher risk from RTI and its complications, including\npelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, tubo-ovarian abscesses, and ectopic pregnancies.  In the\nproject preparatory field study in four provinces, 48 percent of 214 women reported suffering\nfrom symptoms related to RTI.\n9. Acquired  Immunodeficiency  Syndrome  (AIDS).  Since  the  initiation  of  laboratory\ndetection in 1986, only 1487 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive cases have been\nreported to the National AIDS Program. The number is expected to be much higher because of\nseveral  risk  factors  including  HIV-positive  professional  blood  donors,  prostitutes  not  using\ncondoms, sharing of needles among drug users, and migrant workers returning from abroad.5\nAccording to the World Health Organization, HIV prevalence is about 0.06 percent or there are\nsome 80,000 HIV positive cases at present. With inadequate control efforts, about 2-5 percent\nof the population may be HIV positive by 2015.\n10. Cancers.  Hospital-based data shows that breast and cervical cancers are common\namong women in Pakistan. Population-based data are lacking. Surgery for these conditions is\nonly available for those who can gain access to the larger hospitals. Chemotherapy is not\naffordable to most. Screening services are expanding slowly.\n11. RH Issues for Adolescents.  No national studies are available on the indicators related\nto adolescents\u2019 RH. According to a qualitative study of 177 girls and 133 boys in four cities, an\noverwhelming majority of girls and boys mentioned that they had heard and discussed RH\nissues related to menstruation, sexual intercourse, pregnancy, and contraceptive methods.6 In\ngeneral, the main source of information for adolescents is their peer group, which often provided\nill-perceived and incorrect information.\n12. Antenatal and Delivery Care. Currently, there are 29 million women of reproductive\nage, and over 5 million become pregnant each year. In 1996-1997, 36 percent of females who\nhad given birth in the last three years had prenatal consultation during their last pregnancy. The\nattendance rate was 76 percent in major urban areas compared with 22 percent in rural areas\n(footnote 1). In 1998, 31 percent of pregnant women had received two or more doses of tetanus\n                  \n4 National Health Survey of Pakistan. 1994.\n5 Social Marketing Pakistan. 1999.

Only 8 percent of births\nare in government centers or hospitals, and 10 percent in private facilities. However, with the\nincrease in availability of female staff, a noticeable improvement in the utilization of maternal\ncare and FP services has been recorded (Table A2.1.).\nTable A2.1: Trends in Antenatal Care, FP, and Immunization, 1993-1999\nTotal Percent\nServices facilities 1993 1998 Increase\nPrenatal care visits 105 11,682   21,583 84\nFP total visits       100     4,796 8,473 77\nFP new clients visits       100     2,676 4,916 84\nIntrauterine device inserted       100        891 1,674 88\nContraceptive injections       100        969 2,786 188\nTetanus toxoid vaccinations 29,942 35,134 17\n(second dose or more)\n        FP= family planning, IUD= intrauterine device.\n13. Family Planning. Although the contraceptive prevalence rate in Pakistan is lower than\nin many developing nations, it has increased in the last decade, reaching 28 percent in 2000-\n2001 from 12 percent in 1990-1991. The rise is conspicuous in rural areas from 5 percent in\n1991 to 18.6 percent in 1996-1997. Knowledge of contraceptive methods has reached most\nmarried couples, resulting in an increasing demand for FP. Unmet demand for contraception\nhas risen from 28 percent in 1990-1991 to 38 percent in 1996-1997.\n14. Men\u2019s Role in RH. Men's role in FP is limited. The use of condoms accounts for 18\npercent of the total use of contraceptives. The number of vasectomies performed is negligible.\nKnowledge and use of traditional methods is also limited.8 Men usually attend private clinics for\nRH problems including sexually transmitted diseases. Men's knowledge of RH needs of women,\nincluding timely provision of emergency obstetric care, is limited.\n15. Adolescents RH. Adolescents have very limited sources of information about RH, and\nmainly  obtain  inappropriate  information  from  peers.  However,  an  increasing  interest  in\nadolescent RH education from different parts of civil society has been noticed, and education in\nthis field is increasingly acceptable.\n16. Rural sector performance.  The RH status and use of health and FP services in rural\nareas is lower than in urban areas.

In this period, infrastructure\nand human resources for the health and population welfare services expanded in both public\nand private sectors. The Government operates an extensive network of health and population\nwelfare facilities through the Ministry of Health and its departments, the Ministry of Population\nWelfare and its departments, and municipal and local governments. Health services are also\nprovided  by  autonomous  public  institutions,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  private\nhospitals and clinics, drug shops, informal providers including quacks, and traditional healers\nand birth attendants. Table A3.1 illustrates the development of infrastructure in the health and\npopulation welfare sector. Formal private sector spending has increased rapidly, and is now\nabout 3 times public spending.\nTable A3.1: Growth in Physical Infrastructure in the Health Sector Since 1947\nSector Infrastructure 1947 2000\nHealth/local Dispensaries 2,000 4,793\ngovernment\nHealth Hospitals 453a 918\nRural health centers 0 559\nBasic health units 0 4,718\nMaternal and child health centers 140 935\nPopulation Reproductive health services centers 0 266\nwelfare Family welfare centers 0 1,688\nMobile support units 0 131\na\nFigure includes hospitals in both East and West Pakistan.\nSource: Ministry of Planning and Development, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Population Welfare.\n2. Human resources in the health and population sectors are not balanced. Table A3.2\nillustrates that there is a serious mismatch between doctors, nurses, and paramedics. While\nthere are as many female as male medical graduates, few female doctors work in rural areas.\nTable A3.2: Growth in Human Resources in the Health Sector Since 1947\nSector Human Resources 1947 2000\nPublic and Doctors 6,000 91,308\nprivate Nurses 1,600 24,776\nsector Trained traditional birth attendants 1,100 58,000\nHealth Lady health visitors 200 4,407\nLady health workers 0 43,000\nPopulation Family welfare workers 0 4,000\nwelfare Village-based FP workers( female) 0 12,072\nVillage-based FP workers(male) 0 1,052\nSource: Ministry of Planning and Development, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Population Welfare.\nB. Ministry of Population Welfare and Population Welfare Departments\n3. The Ministry of Population Welfare (MOPW) is responsible for population welfare in\nterms of policy formulation, planning, coordination, and monitoring; managing the population\nwelfare program (PWP) through provincial population welfare departments (PPWDs) headed by\nsecretaries in the provinces; information, education and communication (IEC) activities; and", "41\nAppendix 3, page 2\nmanaging  population  welfare  services  through  NGOs,  autonomous  institutions,  and  the\nprograms in federal areas. The PWP is still a vertical program. However, federal staff of MOPW\nworking  in  the  provinces  under  the  PPWDs  are  being  transferred  to  the  provincial\nadministration.\n4. MOPW operates a service delivery system that includes 1,688 family welfare centers,\n266 reproductive health services centers types A and B, 131 mobile service units, and 1,052\nmale village-based family planning workers (VBFPWs). The 12,072 female VBFPWs have been\ntransferred to the Ministry of Health (MOH). Each family welfare center covers a population of\n5,000-7,000, and is managed by a female paramedic with support staff offering family planning\n(FP) counseling, nonsurgical contraceptives, and maternal and child health (MCH) services. The\n105 type A RHSCs are separate units in the compound of public hospitals with a female doctor,\na staff nurse, two family welfare workers, a family welfare assistant, technical assistants, and\nadministrative staff. The 161 type B RHSCs are designated public, NGO, or private hospitals\nthat provide surgical contraceptive services, and other family planning(FP) and MCH services.\nMobile service units provide family welfare center type services in remote areas. The male\nVBFPWs register eligible couples, and target husbands for changing RH behavior and accept\nFP methods. Each is expected to reach males in 12-15 villages. MOPW also works with large\nautonomous  public  sector  industries  referred  to  as  target  group  institutions.  MOPW  has\nestablished  12  regional  training  institutes  for  clinical  training,  and  three  population  welfare\ntraining institutes providing nonclinical training. Except for from the training institutions, it is likely\nthat these services will be handed over to the district government.\nC. Ministry of Health and Provincial Health Departments\n5. MOH is responsible for the health sector in terms of national policy formulation, planning,\ncoordination  and  monitoring;  federal  institutions  and  hospitals,  and  execution  of  vertical\nprograms like the National FP and Primary Health Care Program (NPFP), Expanded Program of\nImmunization  (EPI);  and  control  programs  of  priority  infectious  diseases  like  tuberculosis,\nmalaria, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Under NPFP, community-based\nservices are provided by 43,000 lady health workers and 12,072 female VBFPWs transferred\nfrom MOPW, and combined as family health worker (FHW). Female FHWs maintain registration\nof births and deaths in the catchment population, conduct home visits for counseling, and\nprovide basic medical and FP services. This vertical program is managed through provincial and\ndistrict coordinators.\n6. Unlike PPWDs, the provincial health departments (PHDs) are fully established provincial\ndepartments  responsible  for  formulating  provincial  health  policy,  planning,  and  monitoring;\nmanaging  teaching  hospitals,  schools,  and  special  institutions;  and  supporting  district\ngovernments with health services. The provincial secretary health heads the PHD. The director\ngeneral of the PHD is responsible for implementing preventive and curative services through\ndirectorates headed by program directors, including the reproductive health (RH) directorate.\n7. With FHWs at community level, PHDs provide services through primary care facilities,\ndistrict and subdistrict hospitals, and tertiary care facilities. Primary care facilities include 935\nMCH, 4,718 basic health units (BHUs), and 599 rural health centers (RHCs). MCH centers are\nusually in urban areas and managed by lady health visitors (LHVs) providing basic maternal\ncare and treatment of minor ailments for women and children. Each union council of 10,000-\n20,000 people has at least a basic health unit, providing primary curative, MCH, FP, and\npreventive services; and staffed by 10 people including a medical officer-in-charge, lady health\nvisitors,  an  unqualified  midwife,  and  a  vaccinator.  Reproductive  health  centers  provide\noutpatient services and some in-patient services for a catchment population of about 50,000-", "42\nAppendix 3, page 3\n100,000 people, with approximately 30 staff including a female medical officer. A typical district\nhas  a  district  hospital  and  about  5-10  subdistrict  hospitals.  The  latter  serve  a  catchment\npopulation of about 100,000-300,000 people, have 50-100 beds and diagnostic and surgical\nfacilities. District hospitals serve catchment population of about 1 milliion-2 million people, have\nabout 100-400 beds and at least eight specialist positions. However, many of these hospitals do\nnot provide surgical services for lack of a surgeon and anesthetist, or do not provide these\nservices  at  night.  This  has  a  major  impact  on  maternal  mortality.  There  are  29  teaching\nhospitals at tertiary level.\nD. District Health Group\n8. Under the newly devolved structure, program implementation at district level will be\nunder  the  district  executive  officer  for  health.  Upon  promulgation  of  the  ordinance,  the\nadministrative and financial authority for the management of the offices will be decentralized to\nthe district government. The health and population welfare offices have been grouped under the\ndistrict health group.2 The composition of the district health group as given in the ordinance is as\nfollows: public health, basic and rural health, children and women's health, population welfare,\nand district and subdistrict hospitals. This implies that most of the above mentioned services will\nbe devolved to the district governments. The district health group will be headed by the district\nexecutive officer for health, who will be responsible for administration, discipline, and proper\nconduct of business assigned to the offices. The district health group will be responsible for\ndistrict  planning,  general  management  of  services,  personnel  management,  financial\nmanagement, participation of communities, integrated service delivery, and monitoring. The\ndistrict  government  will  determine  to  what  extent  family  planning  and  reproductive  health\nservices should be given priority in the district in terms of public spending.\nE. Public Sector Institutions\n9. There are 14 major public sector organizations including the Pakistan Armed Forces,\nPakistan Railways, Water and Power Development Authority, Fauji Foundation and Pakistan\nInternational Airlines, employing a workforce of more than one million people. These institutions\nmaintain their own health infrastructure of hospitals, dispensaries, and MCH centers for their\nemployees and their families. A total of 118 gynecologists, 51 medical officers, 132 paramedics,\nand 14 motivators of the health outlets provide these services. MOPW has designated these\norganizations as target group institutions, and supports FP services through the 450 health\noutlets of these institutions.\nF. National Trust for Population Welfare\n10. The National Trust for Population Welfare is an autonomous umbrella organization,\nestablished  in  1994  under  the  Charitable  Endowment  Act  1890.  It  replaced  the  NGO\nCoordinating  Committee,  which  was  a  government  organization  established  to  involve  the\nNGOs in population activities. The Government provided an endowment of Rs104 million to\nNational Trust for Population Welfare, and authorized it to administer and receive funds from\nwithin Pakistan and external donors.1 The main objective was to support, strengthen, and\nincrease  the  contribution  of  NGOs,  private  voluntary  organizations,  and  community-based\nadministrative units working for population welfare, and serve as a forum to provide grants to\n                  \n1 NATPOW. 1994.

The National Trust for Population Welfare has one head office and eight field\noffices. Many smaller NGOs, representing about 70 percent of the districts, have registered with\nNational Trust for Population Welfare. These NGOs have submitted their own proposal for RH\nservice delivery to the National Trust for Population Welfare.\nG. Nongovernment Organizations\n11. NGOs  include  nonprofit  organizations  providing  charitable  services,  undertaking\ndevelopment work, conducting advocacy, or engaging in relief work. Of the more than 16,000\nNGOs,  the  majority  are  community-based  organizations,  usually  for  a  single  community\nengaged in multiple sectors. About 25 percent are midlevel NGOs working at the city or district\nlevel. About 5 percent are umbrella NGOs that work at provincial or national level, and are often\nengaged in funding and building capacity of smaller NGOs and community-based organizations.\nMany mid-level and umbrella NGOs have substantial experience in RH activities, providing\nadvocacy for women\u2019s status and rights, community mobilization, human resource development,\nhealth education and communication, preventive and curative RH services, involvement of men\nas partners in RH, adolescent health and social marketing.  The cost of NGO outlets is not\nmuch higher than public sector facilities, as the latter often lacks medicines and contraceptives,\nand patients are referred to the private drug shops to procure these. There is substantial scope\nto supplement government's efforts in RH through NGOs. During project preparation, about 50\nNGOs submitted proposals for expansion of RH, including for social marketing of contraceptives\nand delivery kits. The Government aims to strengthen the role of NGOs in the sector, and\nassists  NGOs  through  loans,  grants,  and  direct  funding  of  activities  like  social  marketing.\nHowever, both the Government and NGOs also have their reservations about public-private\npartnership, and the public funding mechanisms for NGOs have been cumbersome.\nH. For-Profit Private Sector\n12. The for-profit private health sector has been expanding rapidly. Household expenditure\nfor privately provided services is about three times public health expenditure. However, the\nimpact of these curative services is limited due to poor quality, and negligence of disease\nprevention and health promotion.\n13. Qualified registered practitioners include specialists, general practitioners and private\nhospitals. General practitioners are graduates with hospital-based undergraduate training, but\nusually without training in family medicine. General practitioners are commonly paid for the\nmedicines  dispensed  by  them,  and  not  for  the  consultation,  which  promotes  malpractice.\nContinuing medical education programs for the 50,000 general practitioners are organized by\nprofessional organizations and pharmaceutical companies. Traditional healers have a limited\nrole in RH, but are popular for a wide range of RH problems, including miscarriage, infertility,\nand infections. Paramedics run clinics for minor illnesses and routine maternal care. However,\nthey also treat many RH problems for which they have not been trained. Unqualified and\nuntrained drug shop keepers, quacks and traditional birth attendants provide health services for\nthe rural poor. These individuals have often worked in clinics and chemist shops as assistants,\nand by their exposure have gained some basic information about symptomatic treatments and\nmedicines. They indulge in dispensing a wide variety of medicines for a number of symptoms to\nilliterate ignorant clients. Untrained traditional birth attendants conduct 40 percent of deliveries,\nand often cause harm due to the use of force and drugs, and poor hygiene. Sexual health clinics\nfor men also exist throughout the country, providing immediately acting but harmful pills for\nmagical effects, especially on impotence.", "                                                                           44\nAppendix 4, page1\nGOVERNMENT POLICIES AND PLANS FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH\n1. Since independence, the Government has undertaken maternal and child health (MCH)\nand  family  planning  (FP)  programs  to  address  high  maternal  and  infant  mortality.  These\nMCH/FP programs passed through distinct phases under successive five-year plans (Table A4).\nThe  Government  moved  from  separate  MCH  and  FP  services  to  a  more  comprehensive\nreproductive health (RH) approach including target groups other than women of reproductive\nage, in response to the International Conference on Population and Development Plan of\nAction, 1994. Recently, the Government developed comprehensive poverty, population and\nhealth policies to improve health and population indicators.\n2. The Ministry of Population Welfare (MOPW) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) jointly\ndeveloped  the  RH  services  package1  for  implementing  standardized  RH  services  from  all\nMOPW and MOH outlets. This document contains a national vision statement for RH and\nidentifies nine components based on the national requirements of Pakistan:\n(i)  maternal health care, including safe motherhood and care of complications of\npregnancy and abortions\n(ii)  infant health care (newborn to children aged less than 1 year)\n(iii)  family planning\n(iv)  reproductive tract infections(RTI)/sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and\nhuman immunodeficiency virus(HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency\nsyndrome(AIDS)\n(v)  RH-related problems of adolescents\n(vi)  RH-related problems of women, like cancers\n(vii)  infertility\n(viii)  detection of breast and cervical cancers\n(ix)  RH issues related to men\n3. In  June  2000,  MOPW,  MOH,  and  the  provincial  population  welfare  and  health\ndepartments further selected the first four components of this package for implementation over\nthe next five years.\n4. In terms of organizational reforms, the interim poverty reduction strategy and other\ndocuments of the Government2 propose the following for the RH sector:\n(i)  redefining federal, provincial, district roles in the context of devolution;\n(ii)  establishing district health groups under the district government;\n(iii)  consolidating the primary health care network;\n(iv)  integrating health and family planning services and vertical programs;\n(v)  replicating the women's health project in other districts in Pakistan;\n(vi)  improving hospital administration and financial management;\n(vii)  making teaching hospitals autonomous;\n(viii)  regulating the private sector and the sale of drugs;\n(ix)  cost recovery and subsidy for the poor;\n(x)  developing human resources, in particular female paramedics; and\n(xi)  establishing district and community health boards.\n                                            \n1 Pakistan, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Population Welfare. 1999.

The purpose of the benefit monitoring and evaluation system is to (i) provide accurate,\ntimely, and systemized information on the qualitative and quantitative performance of the project\ncomponents; (ii) ensure that problems and opportunities are identified, analyzed, shared, and\nresponded to in a timely manner; and (iii) make the project impact known one year after\ncompletion of the Project. The system will be tracking selected input, process, output, coverage,\nand impact indicators.1\n2. Under the devolution plan, each district is expected to carry out its baseline health\nsurvey  to  assess  the  coverage  and  impact  of  health  services.  This  project  will  support  a\nbaseline survey in year 2 in all the targeted districts, with a follow-up survey in year 6. Existing\nsurvey instruments developed under the Women's Health Project have been adjusted for this\npurpose.  For  monitoring,  existing  management  information  systems  for  the  health  and\npopulation welfare sectors will be used. The reports of the project coordination unit (PCU) will\nbe used to track project inputs and activities.\n3. Component 1. Inputs and processes will be reported through the reports of PCUs. The\nquality of services and skills of providers will be monitored using supervisory checklists and\nhealth services surveys. Utilization of services, as an indicator of client satisfaction, will be\nmonitored through existing management information systems.\n4. Component 2. The inputs and activities for improving access to reproductive health\nservices will be monitored through PCU reports.  Output will be monitored through existing\nmanagement information systems that will be improved. District household surveys will provide\ncoverage and impact indicators. Similar indicators will be used as those used for the national\nsurveys, so that performance of the project districts and provinces can be compared.\n5. Component 3.  Improved awareness and change in behavior of the target groups\nrequires  special  evaluation  studies  to  determine  impact.  The  federal  health  education  and\ncommunication unit will submit monthly reports to monitor input, process, and output indicators.\n6. Components 4 and 5. The human resource development and institutional strengthening\nwill be monitored by PCUs using input, process, and output indicators. Impact will be assessed\nthrough special evaluation studies.\n7.  Component 6. Support to nongovernment organizations (NGOs) will be monitored with\nthe help of coordinating NGOs, in case these have been contracted to administer implementing\nNGOs. Private sector training will be monitored through PCU reports.\n                  \n1 Input includes hardware and software, including policies and guidelines.

Vulnerable Groups\n1. The Poor\n1. Pakistan's  human  development  index,  and  poverty  and  literacy  indicators  are\ncomparable with those of Bangladesh and India. Sri Lanka has a high literacy level, but its\npoverty level is similar to that of Pakistan (Table A11.1). Based on calorie intake, Pakistan's\npoverty level was about 30 percent in 2000-01, compared with 20 percent in 1992-1993. More\nthan a third of poor households are headed by aged persons dependent on transfer incomes.\nUrban poverty is common in households with a large number of children, but less common in\nhouseholds with female heads. Rural poverty is slightly more common in households with\nfemale heads and among unskilled laborers. Poverty is particularly high in Balochistan, southern\nSindh (Thatta, Badin, Tharparkar and Umarkot), southern Punjab (Siraiki belt), and in the tribal\nareas  of  North-West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP),  Kohistan,  Batgram  and  Dir.  Some  of  the\nreasons for high poverty levels in Balochistan and Sindh include feudal/tribal land ownership\npatterns and overall climate and soil conditions. The districts in Balochistan, except Quetta, are\nalso the most underdeveloped in terms of social status and services.\nTable A11.1: Regional Comparison of GDP, Poverty, and Literacy\nItem Pakistan Bangladesh India Sri Lanka\nGNP per capita ($) 1998 0.52 0.46 0.56 0.73\nPopulation below income poverty 34 36 31 35\nline ($1/day per person), 1997/1998\nAdult literacy, female (%) 29 29 44 88\nAdult literacy, male (%) 58 51 67 94\nSource: Government of Pakistan. 2001. Poverty Reduction Cell, Planning Commission and Policy Wing, Finance Division. 2001.\nInterim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Islamabad.\n2. Women\n2. About 21 percent of women in rural areas are literate. Population subgroups resistant to\nFamily Planning (FP) services are mostly illiterate and belong to low-income households with\nstrong adherence to traditional and social values. Such groups are largely concentrated in\nnorthern parts of NWFP, southern parts of Punjab, most of Balochistan, and landless poor\nfarmers in rural Sindh where the female status is low and their education is discouraged due to\nstrong Biradari and Sardari systems or tribal traditions.1 Seclusion norms are also observed in\nthe semi-irrigated regions where a great proportion of women observe purdah within the village\ncompared with those in peri-urban and relatively more developed regions.2 Girls marry at an\nearly age, especially in rural areas. Most marriages are arranged by parents or elders in the\nfamily. Many young women and adolescent girls begin to bear children at a very young age,\nwith great risk to themselves and often resulting in life-long disability.\n                  \n1 Mahmood, N. 1999.

Pakistani distinguish themselves not only by their social class, gender, and occupation,\nbut also by their distinct ethnolinguistic groups and related social customs. Despite this regional\nand cultural diversity, people in Pakistan are united by one common ideology, Islam, the religion\nof 95 percent of the population. Among minorities, the Christians and Hindus are the more\nprominent, living mainly in, respectively, eastern Punjab and eastern Sindh. Christians are\ncommonly found in low-pay jobs such as housekeeping, and many Hindus are employed in the\ncarpet and textile industries. They are mobile and accept the use of health services, but being\npoor, often may not be able to afford such services. Strong social support systems and charity\nservices that are typical among the wealthier minority groups such as Ismaeli and Parsi are less\nevident.  The  project  will  aim  to  include  poor  minorities  by  selecting  family  health  workers\n(FHWs) from among them, and incorporate their particular needs, like translation and adaptation\nof education materials, in district health plans.\nB. Needs and Demands\n1. Perceived Needs\n4. In  traditional  rural  villages,  the  woman\u2019s  role  is  perceived  to  be  responsibility  for\ndomestic chores, labor near home, and preserving the honor and reputation of the family by not\nexposing herself to the outside world. From a young age onward, girls in traditional households\nare taught to provide, much less to receive. When they get married, they have internalized this\nrole and pass it on to their daughters. Women's mobility is often restricted, and women have\nless access to adequate nutrition and health services. Many of the health and nutrition problems\nof women are perceived as a normal part of life. There is also stigma associated with certain\ndiseases. Women who believe that they may be suffering from a reproductive or urinary tract\ninfection  are  often  hesitant  to  discuss  the  problem  with  others  and  to  seek  appropriate\ntreatment.3 Because of these constraints, women often turn to traditional healers (hakims) or\nspiritual leaders (pirs) within their village for cure for their RH problems.\n2. Family Planning\n5. Various studies have documented the social barriers to and disincentives in the use\ncontraception for limiting and spacing births4. The main reason is of course the desire to have\nmore children. Other reasons cited by rural women for not using FP and health services are\nhusbands\u2019 disapproval, lack of knowledge, religious and fatalistic attitudes, and fear of side\neffects (Table A11.2). Distance and travel costs to reach service outlets and religious values are\nother reasons commonly mentioned as a hindrance to the use of FP services.5\n                  \n3 Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Health/UNAIDS. 2000.

More than half of the women report that they have read nothing in the Quran or Hadith\nthat either favors or opposes FP, whereas 32.3 percent say they have read something against\nFP, and 46.6 percent report that they have heard messages against FP from imams and pirs.6 A\nsubstantial proportion of the population believes that fertility is controlled by fate, and having the\ndesired number of children or approval of FP is not a matter of choice. The project preparatory\ntechnical assistance field study showed that among poor rural women, a husband\u2019s opposition\nto FP use and desire for more children were the prominent reasons for nonuse. Among adult\nmales, fears of negative stigma, and apprehensions about side effects came out as prominent\nreasons for nonuse of contraceptives. The majority of participants in the TA study thought that\ninvolving religious leaders and scholars in dispelling people\u2019s misconceptions about FP issues\nwould make a significant difference in people\u2019s attitudes and behavior.\n3. Women's Reproductive Health (RH) Care\n7. Despite a substantial change in attitudes, a significant number of women and men in\npoor rural communities seek traditional means of health care. The findings from a study in rural\nPunjab show that the majority of the respondents (65 percent) believed that traditional healers\n(hakim,  homeopaths,  and  spiritual  healer)  cured  all  diseases  to  some  extent,  diagnosed\ncorrectly,  and  gave  medicines  that  had  no  side  effects,  but  60  percent  utilized  traditional\nmedicines in cases of severe disease. A large number expressed the view that as a result of\ndissatisfaction with modern medicines and doctors primarily due to high cost, side effects, and\nthe unfavorable attitude of doctors, many women resorted to traditional sources of health care.7\nEvidence from the focus group discussions shows that men perceive hakims and traditional\nhealers as more discrete about their RH problems, whereas other service providers considered\nthose problems unimportant and psychological.8\n8. Regular checkups during pregnancy and after childbirth are important for the health of\nthe  mother  and  child  in  terms  of  early  assessment  of  complications  and  related  risks  for\ndelivery. Yet, only one third of married women (36 percent) report using antenatal care during\npregnancy; about 24 percent received post-natal care and only 11 percent receiving advice on\nFP within three months of delivery. Women\u2019s access to and utilization of these services are\n                  \n6 National Institute for Population Studies (NIPS). 1997.

Traditional means of health care include using traditional birth attendants (TBAs) and\nmothers-in-law as service providers for delivery.9 The evidence shows that about 90 percent of\ndeliveries take place at home in rural areas compared with 62 percent in urban areas (Table\nA11. 4). The reasons given for using a TBA or mother-in-law assistance are their availability at\nhome, lower expense, convenience as it does not require travel and leaving home, and the\nnormative behavior in the village. According to a study in rural parts of Sargodha district,\nPunjab, poor women believe that the major causes of reproductive complications are food\ndeficiency,  inadequate  information  regarding  RH,  frequent  giving  birth,  absence  of  female\ndoctors at the facility, excessive household work, and lack of attention to their own health.10\nTable A11.4: Place of Delivery (percent)\nReligion                   Home                      Public                   Private\nAll                              82.7                          7.8                          9.4\nUrban                         61.8                        15.6                        22.6\nRural                          89.9                          4.3                          5.0\nProvince\nPunjab                        83.8                          7.8                         8.3\nSindh                          72.1                          9.8                       17.9\nNWFP                         88.6                          7.0                         4.4\nBalochistan                 92.6                          3.3                         4.0\n     Source: National Institute of Population Studies, 1998.\n10. About half of the women respondents reported that they had symptoms suggestive of\nurinary tract infections or reproductive tract infections during the past one year.

Men's Role in Reproductive Health\n11. Men\u2019s knowledge about the methods through which pregnancy can be delayed is high,\nand their attitude toward FP is often positive. According to one study, about 29 percent did not\nwant any more children, and 20 percent reported that they wanted to postpone another birth for\n                  \n9 Zafar, S. 1999.

However, when husbands who oppose their wives\u2019 use of FP were approached by service\nproviders and the methods and benefits of FP were explained to them, many became more\nsupportive of their wives' use of contraceptives.12\n12. The findings of the field study on adult males also showed high knowledge (94 percent)\nand use of FP among couples (41 percent). The most commonly used methods reported by\nmen were the condom and the injection for women. About 43 percent of men had discussed\nwith their wives the number of children they would like to have and spacing of children. Men\nwho opposed the idea of interspousal communication said that was normative not to discuss\nthese matters with women, and also that children were God\u2019s will, so there was no need to\ndiscuss it with others and interfere with nature.\u201d The field study further revealed that very few\nmen had awareness and sufficient knowledge about warning signs of maternal complications in\npregnancy and childbirth. However, the majority of the respondents (85 percent) had awareness\nof sexual diseases, but did not have enough information about their spread and what could be\ndone to prevent or cure them. The majority mentioned their preference for going to the hakim for\nthe treatment of sexually transmitted disease (STD)/reproductive tract infection (RTI), while\nothers mentioned self-medication and use of traditional medicines.\n5. Health Care for the Poor\n13. In poor population groups where there are great economic pressures on households to\nacquire even the basic necessities of life, issues such as the necessity of FP or the dangers\npresented  by  RH  infections  are  not,  perhaps,  of  immediate  concern.  In  this  regard,  the\nprevention of STD/RTI may not have high priority in the face of many other social and economic\nproblems. Hence, the needs and demands of the client groups for RH services vary by age,\nsocioeconomic status, ethnic group, residence, and gender.\n14. Low utilization of RH services is evident among rural poor households. The national\nhealth survey data show that rural poor men and young adults make fewer visits to FP and\nhealth  care  outlets  than  women  and  children  do.  Rural  men  rely  more  on  dispensers,\nparamedics and traditional healers than urban residents do. Moreover, the private sector has\nbecome  a  prominent  source  of  RH  care  in  urban  parts  of  the  country  including  hakims,\nhomeopaths, and private practitioners.13\n15. Evidence shows that family size is larger in quintiles with low per capita expenditure, and\nthat the contraceptive prevalence rate and number of couples wanting no more children are\nlower among poor than rich households. The findings of a study in the cities of Faisalabad and\nLarkana  show  that  the  use  of  contraceptives  increases  with  income  (Table  A11.5).  This\nsuggests that, to ensure that costs of contraceptives have to be kept low.14\nTable A11.5: Percent Age of Women Reporting Use of Modern Methods by Income, 1996\nIncome Condom Injection IUD Oral\n(PRs) Contraceptives\n<2000 3.1 0.3 3.5 1.7\n2000-3999 8.0 2.9 4.3 1.4\n4000+ 9.3 3.5 6.6 2.2\n  Source: A.

Selection of Districts\n16. The Project aims to benefit poor and underserved populations including women and men\nof reproductive age, infants (<1 year) and adolescents. The ranking of districts is shown in\nTable A11.7. The selection criteria are (i) poverty and low social ranking; (ii) low coverage by\nfamily health workers; and (iii) not having comparable external support. These criteria were\ndiscussed during provincial workshops and meetings with stakeholders, who also identified the\nfeasibility of implementation in the districts. A list of 34 project districts was prepared: including\n10 in Punjab, 8 in Sindh, 8 in NWFP, and 8 in Balochistan. Most of the selected districts are\nfrom the bottom quartile with poor social indicators. About 50 percent of the people in the\ntargeted districts are poor.\n2. Expected Beneficiaries\n17. Using the 1998 district census, it is estimated that the project will benefit about onethird\nof a total population of 42 million in the targeted districts. These will mainly be poor people,\ninclude 7.7 million women of reproductive age, 8.8 million men (20-59), 5.4 million adolescent\ngirls, 4.8 million adolescent boys and 1 million infants less than 1 year). About 20 percent of the\npoor are expected to directly benefit from the services. Estimates of target beneficiaries by\nprovince are in Table A 11.6.\nTable A11.6: Estimates of Target Population by Province (in millions)\nTotal\nAdolescent Population\nWomen Men Infants Girls Adolescent Boys of Selected No. of\nProvince (15-49) (20-59) (<1year ) (10-19) (10-19) Districts Districts\nTotal 7.7 8.8 1.0 4.8 5.4 41.98 34\nPunjab 3.8 4.5 0.5 2.3 2.7 20.74 10\nSindh 2.4 2.9 0.3 1.4 1.7 13.46 8\nNWFP 1.0 1.0 0.1 0.6 0.7   5.32 8\nBalochistan 0.5 0.5 1.0 0.5 0.3   2.46 8\n18.

The Rationale for Public Sector Intervention\n1. Public investment in reproductive health (RH) services is justified on grounds of efficiency\nand  equity.  Some  services  are  public  goods  like  mass  media  education,  or  have  positive\nexternalities. Improvements in maternal health and nutrition increase the survival probabilities and\nwell-being of young children. Increased chances of child survival will lead to lower fertility and\neconomic and environmental gains. In the absence of public financing, the effective demand for\nand providing them RH services are likely to remain below a socially desirable level. The provision\nof services by the public sector, in addition to financing, is also justified in cases where private\nprovision is inadequate, the public sector is a more efficient provider, and/or consumers exhibit a\nclear preference for public services.\n2. Equity arguments in favor of subsidized health services are also strong in Pakistan; income\nand expenditure surveys suggest that one third of the population live below the poverty line.  The\npoor in Pakistan have lesser access to RH services, for its monetary and non-monetary price is\nunaffordable to many. Heads of poor household often view family planning (FP) and RH issues as\nproblems of lesser importance. As such, public sector intervention in the form of regulating RH\nservices through price or quality control to protect consumers, rather than direct service delivery,\nwill not be effective. In the face of the target population\u2019s low ability to pay and low ranking of FP\nand RH issues, it is very likely that, when the profit-motivated private sector provides the services,\nthe poor will be marginalized and the relatively affluent classes, residing mostly in urban centers,\nwill be served.  Direct public investment can improve equity by reducing rural/urban imbalances.\nGender  balance,  too,  will  be  enhanced,  as  RH  interventions  will  improve  female  health  and\npromote female employment.\nB. Analysis of Demand and Need\n1.   Sources of Family Planning Supplies and Services\n3. Recent surveys indicate that in Pakistan, especially in the rural areas, RH services are\nobtained mainly from government sources.  According to the Pakistan Fertility and Family Planning\nSurvey 1996/97, 41 percent of urban women and 65 percent of rural women obtained FP methods\nthrough government sources. Results also show that more than 53 percent of FP clients received\ntheir intrauterile device (IUDs), injectables, and surgery from public sector facilities. Forty five\npercent acquired their contraceptives from private sector outlets, and a negligible proportion (1.4\npercent) obtained theirs from nongovernment organization (NGO) outlets.1\n4. The Pakistan Fertility and Family Planning Survey  also shows that, although 72 percent of\nthe clients obtained contraceptive pills from private sector outlets, the actual sources are as\nfollows: 60 percent from the public sector, 20 percent from social marketing, and 20 percent from\nthe commercial sector. Similarly, 91 percent of injections came from the public sector, 8 percent\nfrom  social  marketing,  and  only  1  percent  from  the  commercial  sector.  The  majority  of  the\npopulation, particularly rural residents, depend heavily on services provided by the public sector.\nThus, the public sector continues to play the central role in the health sector. Where the private\nsector provides FP and RH services, the costs to the consumers are higher than those in the public\nsector (paras. 12-13).\n                                                \n1 Pricing RH Services in Pakistan. Social Action Program MSU. Islamabad. August 2000.", " 68\nAppendix 12, page 2\n2. Unmet Need and Demand\n5. Despite the fact that knowledge about FP and RH has become almost universal among\nwomen and men (98 percent), a wide gap exists in utilizing that knowledge for contraceptive use.\nThere is evidence of unmet need for family planning among couples, as many couples who want to\nstop or delay another pregnancy are unable to do so. The Pakistan Fertility and Family Planning\nSurvey reported that about 46 percent of currently married women (58 percent urban and 41\npercent rural) do not want more children, but of these 38 percent are not using any contraceptive.\nThe survey further indicates that the overall demand for FP is 61.4 percent, of which 43 percent is\nfor limiting births and 18.5 percent for spacing births; however, only about 24 percent are currently\nusing contraceptives, 18.8 percent for limiting births, and only 5.1 percent for birth spacing.\n6. Among provinces, North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) has the highest unmet need (40.6\npercent) and Sindh has the lowest (34.2 percent). Overall, more than one third of married women\nare in need of FP in all provinces. There is unmet need for family planning in all population strata,\nincluding among poor and illiterate mothers. Factors contributing to high unmet need relate to\ntraditional social and cultural values, low status and limited mobility of women, and problems of\naccess to the services. Unmet need results in a high number of unwanted pregnancies, which\noften lead women to resort abortion. Studies indicate that induced abortions, which can endanger\nthe mother\u2019s life, may be attempted in some way in 10-20 percent of all pregnancies. A focus on\nreaching women and men with unmet need through this Project will reduce fertility significantly and\nimprove mortality and health status indicators among the poor.\nC.

The major components of RH services relate to comprehensive maternal and child care\nincluding safe motherhood, emergency obstetric services, FP, and control of reproductive tract\ninfections (RTI) and sexually transmitted diseases (STD). Specific expenditure data on RH services\nare not routinely collected in Pakistan. The Social Action Program (SAP) expenditure on basic\nhealth and population welfare program can be used to estimate the expenditures on RH. In its\n2000/01  Public  Sector  Development  Program  of  PRs120.5  billion,  the  Government  allocated\nPRs14.0 billion to basic health services, about one third of which would have been spent on RH,\nand PRs2.2 billion to the population welfare program (PWP). Hence, the RH budget is estimated at\nabout PRs7 billion ($117 million) per year.\n8. Since the inception of the PWP, total funding to the population program had risen slowly\nuntil the late 1970s. Subsequently the Government\u2019s commitment to PWP was demonstrated by\nthe significant increase in its funding from PRs2.3 billion during 1983-1988 to PRs15 billion for the\nperiod  1998-2003.  During  the  Eighth  Five-Year  Plan  (1993-1998),  the  share  of  international\nassistance was 32 percent. Current aid agency support for PWP is mainly through SAP and the\nUnited Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA). The health sector has also received major\nexternal support for the RH-related federal programs, and for maternal and child health (MCH)/FP\nservices. The current major external support for the RH sector comes from SAP, the UNFPA\nprogram, and the Women\u2019s Health Project. The annual recurrent cost of the proposed Project is\nabout 2 percent of public spending in the health sector.\n9. The issue of adequacy of public sector funding could be viewed from the perspective of\nrequirements to meet the objectives of public policy and the existing capacity of the public sector", "69\nAppendix 12, page 3\ndelivery system.2 Presently, the RH program comprises a small proportion of the budget. Given the\nlarge unmet needs of the population and the rationale for public sector involvement, there is\nadequate justification for a substantial increase in allocations. There is no doubt that, at present,\nthe public sector faces a severe fiscal constraint in view of the Government\u2019s other obligations, in\nparticular debt services and defense expenditures. There is little room for bringing about a major\nincrease in public health spending without external support.\n2.  Households\u2019 Ability to Pay\n10. According to the Household Integrated Economic Survey of 1996/97, the average monthly\nexpenditures on health care increase as income levels rise, except for the lowest income group (up\nto PRs1,000) in urban areas, for which health expenditures appear relatively higher than those for\nhigher income groups.  For each income group, as well as for the overall population, the share of\nhealth care expenditures in the total household budget is higher for rural residents (3.1 percent)\nthan for those in urban areas (2.4 percent); this is mainly due to the lower household budgets of\nrural people.  Nevertheless, this share of health care expenditures in the overall household budget\nis very low, i.e., it varies between 2 and 3 percent for all income classes.\n11. While household spending on health care is low, statistical evidence for Pakistan suggests\nthat the low-income classes in both urban as well rural areas dissave, i.e., on average, spend more\nthan their incomes, up to monthly income levels of almost PRs3,500-PRs4,000.  This reflects a\nvery low ability to pay for any extra expenditure due to either more services consumed or higher\ncharges for existing services.\n3. User Charges in Reproductive Health\n12. Imposition or increase of user charges on social services is a major issue in Pakistan. In\nthis context, the social benefits of providing the service to low-income groups outweigh the private\nbenefits. However, the key question is whether raising the price of RH services will affect the users\u2019\nability to pay and significantly reduce the use of service demanded, and whether some form of\nsubsidy is required.\n13. RH services are provided at a nominal cost. In population welfare services, clients pay for\ncommodities. In the health services, clients pay a registration fee. Family health workers do not\nhave  to  charge.  This  difference  in  pricing  policy  has  resulted  in  frequent  nonavailability  of\ncontraceptives in health services. In addition, clients report having paid more for services in public\nhealth outlets. One study3 estimated that an average client's mean expenditures on delivery in\nGovernment hospitals are PRs590 (ranging from PRs258 to PRs2,096) compared with the formal\naverage charges of PRs24. However, these services cost more in NGOs and private clinics.\n4.  Potential for Cost Recovery\n14. The estimated cost of protection against conception for one year per couple varies by\nmethod, but in any case is low. The prices charged by the public sector reflect a policy support for\nintrauterine devices and injectables. More recently, there was a debate about charging more for\ncontraceptives in view of limited public resources and unavailability of grant financing.\n                                                \n2 All activities in the population welfare sector are treated as development expenditure and are financed from the PSDP.\n3 Kadir, M . 1997:  Expenses borne by the Users of Obstetric Services at Government Hospitals; College of Physicians\nand Surgeons, Karachi.", " 70\nAppendix 12, page 4\n22.   Given the present nominal costs of FP modes, it is not surprising to observe that only a\nnegligible percentage (0.4 percent in urban and 0.9 percent in rural areas) of respondents in a\nnational survey stated \u201ccosts too much\u201d as a reason for nonuse of FP.  However, full cost recovery\nby raising prices of RH services is presently not advisable as it would reduce affordability to a large\nproportion of current users and adversely affect the demand for such services.4 Improvements in\nquality of care, however, may encourage higher levels of service utilization and justify a small\nincrease in user charges at a later date. A small increase in user charges for FP methods may not\nhave any apparent affect on contraceptive prevalence in view of large unmet demand for these\nservices. However, it may affect the poor who would benefit most from FP. Moreover, unit costs in\nPakistan is expected to stay low for the next few years as international evidence suggests that unit\ncosts start to rise once contraceptive prevalence is above 40-50 percent.\nD. Cost Effectiveness of RH services\n15. Benefits from the Project are estimated using the disabilityadjusted life years approach.\nThis approach entails constructing a composite index of the years of health life lost due to disease,\ndisability, or death, and the years of life gained. The procedure for calculating the disabilityadjusted\nlife years is detailed in ADB\u2019s Economic Analysis of Health Sector Projects.\n16. Based on the health conditions for which data are available in Pakistan, i.e., maternal,\nnutrition, infant-related, childhood cluster, and STDs, the Project\u2019s cost-effectiveness is calculated.\nSince Pakistan has been classified as a \u201cdata poor\u201d country in the context of disabilityadjusted life\nyears  calculations,  \u201ccrude\u201d  estimates  are  given.  Table  A12.1  presents  the  total  number  of\ndisabilityadjusted life years that can be potentially saved by the six-year Project. Incidence of\ndiseases and disability-adjusted life years are based on the 1994 National Health Survey of\nPakistan and are calculated for a typical year during the project implementation period and four\nyears after. The incidence and disability-adjusted life years were increased by 20 percent to adjust\nfor poor rural populations being targeted under the Project. The Project is assumed to reduce most\ntypes of morbidity by only 10 percent, which is low but reflects a realistic estimate of coverage,\nabsorptive capacity and effectiveness of interventions in the districts.\n17. The Project is estimated to save a disabilityadjusted life years at $21, well within the range\nof costs given in Jamison, et al.\u2019s Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries, 1993.5 For\nclinical services for pregnancy and delivery care, the range is $30-$250; for FP promotion, the\nrange is $15-$75. It is low because of the large target population being reached with low-cost\ninterventions. In the Project, the cost per disabilityadjusted life years saved is low because of the\nlarge target population being reached through low cost interventions.\n                                                \n4 The Project is also focused on the poorest segments of population in Pakistan.\n5 Jamison, D. et al. 1993.
