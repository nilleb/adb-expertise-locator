The  Project  will  (i) improve  quality,  access\nand  awareness  of  essential  RH  services  for  the  poor  and\nunderserved  in  34  districts;  and  (ii)  strengthen  the  sector\u2019s\ncapacity  for  RH  services  in  the  context  of  the  Government\u2019s\nrestructuring \ndistrict\nincluding \nmanagement,  human  resource  development,  private  sector\ntraining,  and  support  of  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).\nThe  Project  promotes  human  resource  development  through\npreservice  and \ntraining\ninstitutions.  It  will  also  assist  the  Government  to  strengthen  its\npartnerships  with  NGOs  by  supporting  small  contracts  for  NGOs\nto  provide  RH  services  in  the  targeted  districts.  The  Project  will\nuse a participatory approach based on district plans involving the\nclients (including males), local leaders, and NGOs.\n\ntraining  and  upgrading \n\nstrengthening \n\nin-service \n\nprocess, \n\nPoverty classification:\nThematic classification:\n\nCore poverty intervention\nGender and development\n\nCategory C. Environmental implications were reviewed, and no\nsignificant adverse environmental impacts were identified.\n\nPakistan\u2019s  rapid  population  growth  has  negated  the  impact  of\ndevelopment,  and  poverty  has  worsened  during  the  last  decade.\nHowever,  there  is  visible  evidence  that  the  transition  to  lower\nfertility has begun, and that there is potential for accelerating this\ntransition.  The  total  fertility  rate  has  declined  from  7.1  in  1965-\n1969  to  4.8  in  2000.  The  contraceptive  prevalence  rate  has\nincreased from 12 percent to 28 percent in the last 10 years, while\nunmet demand increased from 28 percent to 38 percent.\n\nThe health status of women and infants is poor and has improved\nlittle  over  the  past  decade.  Each  year,  about  20,000  women  die\nfrom  largely  avoidable  maternal  complications,  and  9  percent  of\ninfants do not reach their first birthday. This is due to inadequate\nRH  services,  particularly  community-based  care  and  emergency\nobstetric  care  for  the  poor,  coupled  with  weak  management  and\nlow  levels  of  investment.  In  addition,  traditional  practices  limit\nwomen\u2019s  rights  to  use  RH  services  for  themselves  and  their\nchildren.\n\nThe  Government  is  concerned  about  the  poor  health  status  of\nwomen  and  children,  and  the  implications  of  high  population\n\n\fObjectives and Scope\n\niii\n\nfor \n\nits  policy \n\nin  particular \n\nfamily  welfare, \n\nthe  environment,  and  economic\ngrowth \ndevelopment. It wants to accelerate the pace of decline in fertility,\nintroduce  comprehensive  reproductive  services,  and  promote\ngender equity and women empowerment. The Government plans\na transition from separate family planning, and maternal and child\nhealth  services  to  the  integrated  RH  approach  to  improve  the\nacceptability,  efficiency,  and  impact  of  these  services.  It  is\nstrengthening \nfor  safe\nframework, \nmotherhood.  It  is  merging  the  community-based  family  health\nworkers of the two ministries of health and population welfare. It is\nalso in the process of decentralizing health and population welfare\nprograms \nthe  provincial\nthe  provinces,  and  devolving \nresponsibilities  to  the  districts  as  part  of  a  larger  restructuring\neffort. The Government gives priority to expanding RH to the poor\nin  the  least-developed  and  underserved  districts.  It  wants  to\ninvolve local leaders and males in RH, and educate adolescents.\nIt wants NGOs and the private sector to expand RH services. The\nGovernment  has  requested  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)\nassistance  with  expanding,  improving,  integrating  and  devolving\nits  RH  services.  The  proposed \ninterventions  are  simple,\ninexpensive,  and  cost-effective;  address  the  needs  of  the  poor;\nand  support  sustainable  development.  The  Project  is  fully  in  line\nwith ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy, and health and population\npolicies.\n\nto \n\nThe  overall  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  RH  status  of\nfamilies,  reduce  maternal  and \ninfant  mortality,  and  reduce\npopulation  growth.  The  outcome  will  contribute  to  improving\nwomen\u2019s social status and reducing poverty. The objectives are to\n(i) increase  the  use  of  RH  services  in  34  poor  and  underserved\ndistricts,  and  (ii)  strengthen  the  sector\u2019s  capacity  for  RH  services\nin the context of the Government\u2019s restructuring process.\n\nThe  Project  will  help  improve  the  use  of  RH  services  by\n(i) improving  the  quality  and  range  of  RH  services  through  skills-\nbased  in-service  training,  essential  equipment  and  supplies,  and\nquality  control  through  supervision  and  monitoring;  (ii) increasing\naccess of the rural poor to community-based RH services through\nfamily  health  workers,  and  selective  upgrading  of  family  planning\nand  obstetric  care  services;  and  (iii)  increasing  awareness  about\nRH services, and changing practices among specific target groups\nthrough  information,  education  and  communication  (IEC),  and\nadvocacy among local leaders. The Project will help to strengthen\nthe sector\u2019s capacity for RH services by (iv) strengthening national\nand provincial RH structures and management capacity in support\nof the RH approach, integration of RH services, and devolution of\nresponsibilities  and  authorities  to  the  districts;  and  develop\nprovincial  RH  programs;  (v) developing  human  resources  for  RH\nby  improving  preservice  training  capacity;  and  (vi) harnessing\nNGOs  and  private  sector  capacity  with  financial  support  and\ntraining to develop RH services.\n\n\fCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan\n\niv\n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  including  physical  and  price\ncontingencies,  and  taxes  and  duties  is  estimated  at  $45.0  million\nequivalent,  comprising  a  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $15.7  million\nequivalent  (35  percent),  and  local  currency  cost  of  $29.3  million\nequivalent (65 percent).\n\nSource\nAsian Development\nBank\nGovernment\n\n                                         ($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n15.7\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n20.3\n\nTotal\nCost\n36.0\n\nPercent\n80\n\n9.0\n\n9.0\n\n20\n\nTotal\n\n29.3\n\n45.0\n\n    100\n\n  0.0\n\n15.7\n\nLoan Amount and Terms ADB  will  provide  a \n\nSources:  ADB estimates, Government.\n\nloan  of  SDR28,454,000  ($36,000,000\nequivalent) from its Special Funds resources.

About 50 percent of the\npopulation in these districts are poor, and more than 50 percent of\nthe beneficiaries of the Project will be poor. Depending on the type\nof  intervention,  about  one  third  of  the  poor  in  these  districts  will\ndirectly  benefit  from  the  Project.  Women  and  infants  will  benefit\nfrom increased awareness among males about RH issues, better\nRH  care  at  home,  and  better  access  to  quality  RH  services.  It  is\nestimated  that  the  Project  will  prevent  11,000  maternal  deaths,\nprevent  150,000  obstetric  disabilities,  save  100,000  infants,  and\nprevent one million unwanted pregnancies. In addition, the Project\nwill  accelerate  the  integration  and  decentralization  of  services  of\nhealth  and  population  welfare  services,  operating  within  the\nframework  of  the  devolution  plan  to  strengthen  the  district  health\nsystem.\n\n\fvi\n\n\fI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\n\n1.\nloan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Reproductive Health Project.\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nThe Government of Pakistan recognizes the serious implications of poor women\u2019s health\nand  high  population  growth,  and  desires  to  improve  the  reproductive  health  (RH)  status  of\nwomen  and  accelerate  the  pace  of  fertility  decline.  It  plans  to  do  so  by  strengthening  the\nPopulation  Welfare  Program  (PWP)  of  the  Ministry  of  Population  Welfare  (MOPW)  and\nprovincial  population  welfare  departments  (PPWDs),  and  the  National  Program  of  Family\nPlanning and Primary Health Care (NPFP) of the Ministry of Health (MOH) and provincial health\ndepartments (PHDs). The Government aims to introduce the RH approach in line with the 1994\nCairo Resolution, promoting an integrated package of RH interventions aligned to the priorities\nof the people. In Pakistan, these priorities are family planning (FP), maternal care, infant care,\nand control of reproductive tract infections (RTI) and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The\nGovernment is planning to integrate maternal and child health (MCH) and FP services into the\nRH  approach  to  make  them  more  acceptable,  efficient,  and  effective;  and  extend  basic  RH\nservices to all Pakistani. Many poor rural communities do not have access to basic RH services\nat  present.  As  part  of  its  overall  restructuring  of  the  public  sector,  the  Government  plans  to\nmerge the population welfare and health structures, decentralize RH programs to the provinces,\nand devolve administrative powers to the district level.\n\n3.\nThe support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to the health and population welfare\nsectors  has  contributed  substantially  to  meeting  the  Government\u2019s  targets  for  the  eighth  five-\nyear plan, 1993-1998.1 Under the umbrella of the Social Action Program (SAP), the Government\nhas  requested  ADB  to  help  introduce  the  RH  approach,  and  expand  RH  services  in  poor\ndistricts  not  included  in  ADB\u2019s  Women\u2019s  Health  Project  or  other  projects.2  Project  preparatory\ntechnical  assistance3  for  the  Reproductive  Health  Project  was  done  from  July  to  December\n2000.  A  participatory  approach  was  used  with  extensive  consultations  of  government  officers,\nfield  staff,  beneficiaries,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  the  private  sector.  The\nAppraisal  Mission4  visited  Punjab,  Sindh,  and  North-West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP)  and  met\nwith the Government, aid agencies, and NGO representatives to discuss the proposed Project,\nincluding possible cofinancing. The project framework is in Appendix 1.\n\n                  \n\n1  Loan 1200-PAK: Health Care Development Project, for $60 million, approved on 1 December 1992 ; Loan 1277-\nPAK: Population Project, for $25 million, approved on 2 December 1993; Loan 1301-PAK: Social Action Program\n(Sector) Project  (SAPPI),  for  $100  million,  approved  on  23  June  1994;  Loan  1493-PAK:  Second Social Action\nProgram (Sector) Project (SAPPII), for $200 million, approved on  28 November 1996;\n\n2  Loan 1671-PAK: Women\u2019s Health Project, for $47.0 million, approved on 16 March 1999. The project is supporting\ndistrict health system development in 20 districts with a focus on women's health services including reproductive\nhealth.\n\n3  TA 3387-PAK: Reproductive Health Project, for $300,000, approved on 29 December 1999.\n4  The Mission was carried out from 10 September to 22 October 2001. It comprised V. de Wit, Mission Leader and\nSr.  Health  Specialist;  S.  Nanwani,  Sr.  Counsel;  L.  Gutierrez,  Project  Economist,  M.  Hyatt,  Consultant;  and  J.\nChishtie, Consultant. The Mission was assisted by S. Abbas, Sr. Project Implementation Officer, Pakistan Resident\nMission.\n\n\f2\n\nIII.  BACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\n\n1. \n\nEconomic and Social Context\n\n4.\nPakistan is the seventh most populous country in the world with an estimated 143 million\npeople in 2001. At the current population growth of 2.3 percent, it will have 243 million people in\n2025.5  The  rapid  population  growth  has  negated  the  impact  of  development  and  exacerbated\npoverty.  Pakistan  has  poor  human  development  indicators,  marked  by  inequities  between\nwomen and men, income groups, and urban and rural populations. The social sector has been\nneglected  for  many  years;  public  sector  expenditure  for  the  social  sector  is  still  very  small\u2014\naround  2 percent of gross  domestic product for education, and less than 1 percent for health.\nSAP, initiated in 1992, resulted in only modest improvement of the country's social indicators, as\nit  had  to  overcome  major  political,  economic,  and  institutional  constraints.  Continuous  social\nsector  reform  and  substantially  increased  investments  are  required  to  build  human  and\ninstitutional capacity, change attitudes and practices, and improve family health.\n\n5.\nThe social structure, customs, and beliefs in Pakistan\u2019s more traditional society result in\nwomen  and  girls  having  less  access  to  nutrition,  education,  health  care,  and  employment.\nLevels of literacy and educational attainment remain very low, especially for rural women. The\n1998 census shows that in rural areas only 21 percent of women and 47 percent of men were\nliterate, compared with 55.6 percent of urban women and 72.6 percent of urban men. Women's\nparticipation  in  formal  employment  was  only  13.6  percent.  The  social  conditions  of  women\ninhibit them from making decisions and choices about their health, nutrition, and child bearing,\nparticularly in rural Pakistan, which has the highest fertility and maternal mortality ratios.\n\nThe national per capita income was about $446 equivalent in 2000. Poverty increased,\n6.\nand income distribution worsened in the 1990s. Poverty increased to about 30-35 percent of the\npopulation.6  Based  on  the  head  count  approach,  the  proportion  of  poor  rural  and  urban\nhouseholds increased, respectively, from 18 to 35 percent, and 15 to 26 percent in the period\nFY 1987/88-FY1998/99. 7 Poverty is deeper and more rampant in rural areas, where it is closely\nlinked to land ownership, large family size, unemployment, and lack of social services. Poverty\nis more prevalent in rural Sindh and Balochistan. Forty-four percent of the population works in\nagriculture, which was hit by persistent drought in the past few years.\n\n7.\nIn  addition  to  rising  poverty,  Pakistan  faces  severe  macroeconomic  imbalances,\ndeclining  economic  growth,  and  underdeveloped  human  capital.  Pakistan's  overall  fiscal\nsituation is precarious following several national and international events. In FY2001, the budget\ndeficit  was  reduced  to  5.2  percent,  which  is  the  lowest  deficit  in  20  years.    However,  chronic\nfiscal  and  external  deficits  have  resulted  in  the  accumulation  of  large  domestic  and  external\ndebt,  equal  to  115  percent  of  gross  domestic  product  in  2001.  The  country  has  successfully\nnegotiated  a  poverty  reduction  growth  facility  program  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund,\nwhich is expected to be approved in December 2001.\n\n                  \n\n5    National  Institute  of  Population  Studies.  2000.

Important causes of the decline include higher average age at\nmarriage  and  higher  use  of  contraceptives  among  women  beyond  30  years  of  age.  The\ncontraceptive  prevalence  rate  has  increased  remarkably  from  12  to  28  percent  in  the  last\ndecade. The rise in the contraceptive prevalence rate is conspicuous in rural areas, where it is\nlinked  to  the  increasing  number  of  community-based  workers  and  economic  pressures  on  the\nhousehold.  Knowledge  of  contraceptive  methods  has  now  reached  almost  every  married\ncouple. As a result of the increasing desire to limit family size, the unmet need for contraception\nincreased from 28 to 38 percent between 1990/91 and 1996/97, indicating a major shortfall in\nservices. 8\n\nEach  year,  about  5  million  children  are  born  in  Pakistan.  While  the  use  of  antenatal\n9.\nservices  among  rural  women  has  increased  from  13  to  31  percent  in  the  past  decade,\nmotherhood has not become much safer. Most rural women deliver at home, where malnutrition\nand  illness,  obstetric  complications,  and  harmful  birth  practices  of  traditional  birth  attendants\n(TBAs)  and  relatives  often  result  in  maternal  disabilities  and  deaths  that  could  have  been\nprevented  if  basic  quality  obstetric  care  was  available.  About  18  percent  of  women  use\ninstitutions for childbirth. These women do not always receive quality care, which discourages\ninstitutional delivery. About 20,000 Pakistani women die from maternal complications each year,\nand  one  third  of  women  suffer  an  obstetric  disability.  In  1997,  the  maternal  mortality  ratio\nestimate  ranged  from  340  to  600  per  100,000  live  births.9  Rural  women  are  at  much  greater\nrisk(cid:190)\nthe maternal mortality ratio is often twice as high in poor rural communities. Childbearing\nbegins  at  an  early  age,  when  the  risk  of  maternal  complications  is  very  high.  Abortions  and\nviolence against women also contribute to maternal mortality.\n\n10.\nAbout  450.000  million  infants  of  the  5  million  born  each  year  die  before  reaching  their\nfirst birthday. The infant mortality rate has fallen from 137 per 1,000 live births in 1960 to 89 per\n1,000  live  births  in  1998,10  but  this  is  still  high  compared  with  15  per  1,000  live  births  in  Sri\nLanka.11  One  quarter  of  all  children  are  born  with  low  birth  weight,  mainly  due  to  maternal\nmalnutrition.  About  half  of  infant  mortality  occurs  within  one  month  after  birth,  and  is  closely\nrelated  to  maternal  care.  Respiratory  infections  and  diarrheal  diseases  cause  most  infant\ndeaths. Childhood diseases like tetanus and measles are declining as immunization coverage of\nwomen and infants has reached respectively 31 and 45 percent.\n\n11.\nIn addition to limited acceptance of FP and neglect of women's RH needs, the emerging\nacquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) threat and other STDs have created the impetus\nto target men in RH programs. Males and adolescents know little about prevention of STDs. The\nWorld  Health  Organization  estimates  that  there  are  about  80,000  human  immunodeficiency\nvirus (HIV) carriers in Pakistan.12 In the absence of adequate control efforts, 2-5 percent of the\n\n                  \n\n8    Government  of  Pakistan,  National  Institute  for  Population  Studies.  1997.

The  World  Bank  is  planning  an  HIV/AIDS  project.\nPakistan's RH status is summarized in Appendix 2.\n\n3.\n\nThe Reproductive Health Sector\n\n12.\nSince  the  1950s,  the  RH  sector  has  progressed  through  several  distinct  phases.  It\nstarted with the provision of services through female paramedics, followed by the introduction of\nthe FP program, the expansion of rural health services, and mass media education. Community-\nbased services first developed in the 1980s through lady health visitors (LHVs) on an outreach\nbasis, followed by training of TBAs and family health workers (FHWs) form the local community.\nThe  current  approach  aims  to  increase  access  to  RH  care  through  FHWs;  making  quality\nemergency  obstetric  care  (EmOC)  available;  education  of  males;  NGO  support;  and  social\nmarketing. A summary of the RH sector is in Appendix 3.\n\n13.\nThe impact of population programs in the first four decades was less than expected. In\naddition  to  an  initial  public  resistance  against  modern  FP  methods,  there  were  some\nprogrammatic issues: (i) weak political commitment, (ii) frequent policy and structural changes,\n(iii) lack of an integrated  service delivery approach, (iv) exclusive focus on married women as\nthe  target  group,  (v)  limited  coverage  of  services,  (vi)  interference  of  local  leaders,  (vii)  weak\ngovernance, and (viii) inadequate investments.\n\n14.\nA  noticeable  change  in  FP  appeared  in  the  1990s,  with  stronger  political  commitment,\nmore funds, better governance, and the introduction of FHWs. But efforts in making motherhood\nsafer  met  with  far  less  success.  First,  safe  motherhood  requires  effective  services  at  various\nlevels  in  the  health  system  and  cannot  be  addressed  on  a  campaign  basis.  Second,  because\nmaternal  mortality  affects  mainly  poor  rural  women  at  home,  it  has  not  received  priority  from\nleaders and health services managers. Growing awareness of the suffering of these women(cid:190)\nfor  every  maternal  death,  30  more  women  become  disabled(cid:190) and  the  socioeconomic\nconsequences of their disability or death in poor households led to an increasing Government\ncommitment to reach poor women to make motherhood safer. At the same time, there is greater\npublic openness and concern about the increase in RTIs, STDs, and adolescent health.\n\nMOPW  is  responsible  for  population  policies  and  the  PWP.  The  PWP  is  implemented\n15.\nthrough the PPWDs in each of the four provinces, and in federal areas and institutions directly\nunder  MOPW. PPWDs  have  not  been established as full provincial departments, but this may\nchange  as  federal  staff  is  currently  being  transferred  to  the  provincial  administration.  The\ndelivery system includes 1,688 family welfare centers, 266 RH services centers, and 131 mobile\nservice  units.  It  also  included  12,072  female  village-based  family  planning  workers  (VBFPWs)\nthat  have  been  transferred  to  the  NPFP.  The  1,052  male  VBFPWs,  responsible  for  male\neducation on FP, remain with the PWP. Each family welfare center, managed or headed by a\nparamedic  family  welfare  worker,  offers  FP  counseling,  nonsurgical  contraceptives,  and  MCH\ncare  for  about  6,000  people.  A  token  amount  is  charged  for  contraceptives.  The  RH  services\ncenters  provide  surgical  and  clinical  contraception.  Twelve  regional  training  institutes  provide\nclinical training; and three population welfare training institutes, nonclinical training.\n\n16.\nMOH  is  responsible  for  health  policies  and  operates  eight  federal  programs,  including\nthe  NPFP  and  five  tertiary  hospitals.  PHDs  operate  in  the  four  provincial  governments.  Their\ncombined  delivery  system  includes  918  district  and  subdistrict  hospitals,  559  rural  health\ncenters,  4,718  basic  health  units,  935  MCH  centers,  and  dispensaries.  In  each  province,\npromotive,  preventive,  and  curative  health  services  are  delivered  through  a  four-tier  system:\nFHWs at community level, primary care facilities at union council level, first referral hospitals at\n\n\f5\n\nsubdistrict  and  district  levels,  and  tertiary  hospitals  and  other  services  at  provincial  level.  The\nGovernment  has  combined  the  43,000  lady  health  workers  and  12,072  female  VBFPW  into\nFHWs  under  the  NPFP.  The  FHW  carries  out  registration,  counseling,  minor  treatment,  FP\nservices,  and  referral.  She  visits  households  each  month  in  a  catchment  population  of  up  to\n1,000. Further integration of RH services of is being planned.\n\n17.\nOn 14 August 2001, the Government established the district government and devolved\npowers to the district government through the promulgation of the Local Government Ordinance\nby all the provinces. The district government will appoint a district executive officer (health) who\nwill  be  responsible  for  managing  the  district  health  and  population  team  (DHPT)  including  all\nhealth and population welfare services in the district. This is likely to become fully effective by 1\nJuly 2002 under the proposed name of District Health Group.\n\n18.\nThe private sector accounts for nearly two thirds of all health expenditure and is largely\nurban-based,  providing  curative  services.  A  small  percentage  of  private  practitioners  offer\ncomprehensive  RH  service  to  both  females  and  males,  and  less  than  2  percent  received  FP\ntraining  in  the  past  three  years.  The  NGO  sector,  almost  nonexistent  at  the  time  of\nindependence,  has  steadily  grown  over  the  years,  particularly  the  last  two  decades.  It  is\nestimated that there are now more than 16,000 NGOs: the majority of them are working at the\ncommunity level, about 25 percent at the subdistrict or district level, and about 5 percent at the\nnational level. Some of them supplement public sector efforts with RH advocacy, education, and\nservices.  In  1994,  the  Government  established  an  autonomous  umbrella  organization,  the\nNational  Trust  for  Population  Welfare.  It  has  supported  about  200  NGO  proposals  for  FP\nservices. Two social marketing projects, \"Key\" and \"Green Star\", have made some progress in\nproviding contraceptives but their market shares remain small.\n\n4.\n\nHealth Sector Financing\n\nIn 1992, the Government initiated the SAP to address the serious neglect of the social\n19.\nsectors. Among others, this was done by increasing government expenditure on social services.\nThe first phase of the SAP (1992-1996) achieved its expenditure and performance targets in the\nhealth  and  population  welfare  sector.  At  present,  the  Government  is  implementing  the  second\nphase  (1997-2002).  However,  the  second  phase  coincided  with  a  series  of  external  events\nkeeping  Pakistan  in  a  fiscal  crisis.  The  drastic  shortfall  in  federal  revenue  transfers  caused  a\nsharp drop in provincial expenditures. SAP expenditures remained relatively protected, but full\nprotection of SAP expenditures became impossible. As a result, social sector expenditures that\nhad  increased  during  Social  Action  Program  (Sector)  Project  (SAPPI)  stagnated  during  the\nSecond Social Action Program (Sector) Project (SAPPII), including the nonsalary expenditures,\nthereby affecting the quality of services.\n\n20.   After the SAPPI period, public health sector spending has been persistently low at about\n0.8  percent  of  gross  domestic  product.  The  Public  Sector  Development  Program  2000/01\ncosting  PRs120.5  billion  allocated  PRs14  billion  for  basic  health  services,  including  PRs2.2\nbillion for PWP. This is about $2 of public health spending per person per year, compared with\nan estimated total private expenditure of $6 per person per year, and a requirement of at least\n$12 per person per year.13 The financing of the RH sector showed a somewhat more positive\ntrend until recently. The PWP allocation doubled between 1993/94 and 2000/01, and spending\nin  the  RH  sector  was  further  increased  by  the  NPFP,  resulting  in  a  fourfold  increase  in  public\nspending on RH.\n\n13 Government of Pakistan, Federal SAP Secretariat. 2000. Restructuring of the Social Action Program. Islamabad.\n\n                  \n\n\f6\n\nDuring  the  8th  five-year  plan  (1993-1998),  the  aid  agency  share  was  32  percent.\n21. \nFollowing  the  closing  of  ADB  and  World  Bank  population  projects  in  December  2000,  most\nexternal  assistance  for  the  RH  sector  is  through  SAPPII,  currently  financing  40  percent  of  the\nPWP  and  20  percent  of  the  NPFP,  and  due  to  close  in  June  2002.  Due  to  the  Government's\nacute  fiscal  constraints,  the  2001/02  budget  for  the  PWP  is  only  PRs1.6  billion  instead  of  the\nprojected PRs2.6 billion needed to sustain program efforts. The NPFP also shows a 30 percent\nshortfall. Through SAP, efforts are being made to increase allocations this fiscal year, including\na \u00a35.2 million grant ($7.3 million equivalent) from the Department for International Development\n(DFID). The Government is planning to increase the PWP budget to PRs3.0 billion next year.\n\n5. \n\nKey Issues\n\n22.\nHigh  mortality  and  disability  of  women  and  infants,  and  high  fertility  result  from  a\ncombination  of  early  pregnancy,  lack  of  birth  spacing,  malnutrition,  violence,  abortion,  poor\nhygiene, late referral, and unavailability of appropriate and affordable services. The underlying\nfactors are well known(cid:190)\nignorance, low social status of women, limited mobility, poverty, weak\ngovernance,  and  resource  constraints.  These  need  to  be  addressed  at  community,  services,\nand governing levels. The following issues directly affect RH status:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nCommitment and capacity for RH. The Government's commitment to women's\nhealth and population control has not been assimilated at lower levels (e.g., like\nfor  polio  eradication),  and  districts  are  not  assessed  in  terms  of  their  RH\nperformance. The sector has been fragmented, lacking an overarching RH policy\nframework,  funding,  and  capacity  at  provincial  and  district  levels,  resulting  in\nweak effort in the RH subsector. Based on the national policy framework for RH,\nthe introduction of the RH approach provides an opportunity to develop provincial\nRH programs with improved quality of services and an integrated referral system.\nUnclear  responsibilities,  weak  management  skills,  and  financial  constraints\nbecome even more pertinent with devolution and need to be addressed.\n\nRange and quality of services. Many of the primary care facilities designed and\nequipped to provide routine maternal care and FP services do not provide these\nservices  due  to  mismanagement  and  staff  constraints.  Typically,  female\nparamedics assigned to MCH and FP assist medical officers with curative work,\nand medical officers pay little attention to RH. The staff lack skills in counseling,\ncase management, and rational use of drugs and diagnostics. Their services are\nirregular due to social and communication constraints.\n\nAccess for the poor. Half the population, particularly those in rural areas, do not\nhave  access  to  FHWs  providing  RH  care.  Access  to  obstetric  emergency\nservices  is  poor  as  only  few  hospitals  provide  such  services  regularly.  The\ncapacity  for  surgical  contraception,  a  very  popular  method,  is  inadequate.  The\npoor often cannot afford services due to a shortage of supplies in public facilities.\n\n(iv)  Male's  attitude.  Males  often  lack  awareness  of  women\u2019s  health  needs.\nTraditional  local  leaders  and  males  often  restrict  the  mobility  of  women,\nparticularly in seeking access to FP and obstetric surgical services.\n\n(v) \n\nUnbalanced human resource development. Human resources do not match to\nthe  health  needs  of  the  population.  There  are  four  times  as  many  doctors  as\n\n\f7\n\nfemale  paramedics,  which  should  be  the  reverse.  Although,  private  universities\ncontinue to increase, they are inadequate in preparing doctors for primary health\ncare  (PHC),  in  particular  RH.  Paramedical  schools  use  outdated  curricula  and\nequipment and provide little skills training.\n\n(vi) \n\nInvolving NGOs and the private sector. The Government\u2019s long-term policy is\nto support NGOs in providing RH services. However, the Government has so far\nprovided  little  support  for  NGOs,  and  NGOs  are  reluctant  to  take  Government\ncontracts.  The  institution  assigned  to  contract  NGOs  has  had  governance\nconstraints.  There  are  no  RH  policy  and  regulatory  guidelines  for  the  private\nsector. Meanwhile, about 50 NGOs are interested in expanding RH services with\nGovernment incentives, and private practitioners are interested in RH training.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n23.\nSince the 1950s, the Government has been implementing various policies to address the\npoor  health  status  of  women  and  children  and  high  population  growth  through  MCH/FP\nprograms  (Appendix  4).14  The  policies  show  distinct  phases:  (i)  providing  static  MCH  services\nthrough female paramedics, (ii) introducing selective FP programs, (iii) posting doctors in rural\nareas, (iv) adding outreach services, (v) expanding health infrastructure, (vi) training TBAs, (vii)\nimproving obstetric services, (viii) introducing community-based workers, (ix) increasing support\nfor  NGOs,  and  (x) introducing  social  marketing.15  While  the  Family  Planning  Association  of\nPakistan started services as early as 1953, the role of NGOs has remained small.\n\nThese frequent policy changes reflect initial problems with achieving impact. It took time\n24.\nto  develop  support  for  women\u2019s  health  and  fertility  regulation  in  a  nonconducive  environment.\nThere  was  inadequate  political  commitment  and  support  among  leaders.  Frequent  changes  in\npolicies and structures reduced implementation efforts. Plans did not consider how difficult it is\nfor  women  to  travel  and  work  in  isolated  places,  while  doctors  lacked  interest  in  FP  services.\nAfter substantial investments in training TBAs, it was realized that it was difficult to change their\nbehavior even with proper training and support. The lack of an integrated approach resulted in\nFP services not being available in the large network of health facilities. Leadership in the sector\nkept  changing  and  weak  management  affected  staff  productivity.  Inadequate  funding  and\nlogistics resulted in shortages of drugs and contraceptives.\n\n25.\nIn  the  1990s,  the  overall  climate  for  women\u2019s  health  and  FP  became  more  conducive.\nThe  Government  formulated  policies  to  respond  to  the  1994  International  Conference  on\nPopulation and Development, for incorporation in the 9th five-year plan (1998-2003). MOPW and\nMOH  jointly  formulated  a  national  vision  and  package  for  RH  services  in  Pakistan.16  MOPW\nadopted a comprehensive population and development policy, aimed at broadening the scope\nof services for a transition from FP services to the RH approach, without losing focus on fertility\ncontrol.  The  present  Government  expresses  great  concern  about  the  implications  of  high\npopulation  growth  for  poverty  and  economic  development.  It  seeks  to  reduce  fertility  and\nmaternal and infant mortality rates, and promote gender equity and women empowerment. On\nWorld Population Day, 11 July 2000, the chief executive admonished the nation to address the\npopulation  explosion  on  a  war  footing;  and  devise  strategies  to  bring  down  the  population\n\n                  \n\n14 The focus of MCH/FP programs is on maternal and child care and family planning.\n15 Ministry of Planning and Development, Planning Commission.

He  announced  a  broad  framework  for  national\npopulation planning and RH policy.\n\nThe interim poverty reduction strategy of the Government17 proposes the reorganization\n26.\nof the district health offices, consolidation of the PHC network, integration of vertical programs,\npromotion  of  child  spacing  as  a  component  of  RH  services,  improvement  in  hospital\nadministration  and  financial  management,  and  regulation  of  the  private  sector  and  the  sale  of\ndrugs.  Long-term  policy  measures  include  redefining  the  role  of  the  various  levels,  and  cost\nrecovery and subsidy for the poor. Strategies include strengthening the PHC network including\nFP services, replicating the Women's Health Project, training and retraining staff, public-private\npartnership,  autonomy  for  teaching  hospitals,  and  involving  civil  society  in  governance  in  the\nhealth sector. The national health policy18also gives high priority to RH services.\n\n27.\nBased  on  the  RH  approach  of  integrating  FP  with  health  services,  and  promoting\nwomen\u2019s  health  status,  the  Government  has  defined  an  RH  services  package  of  nine\ncomponents  and  a  constellation  of  services  to  be  adopted  over  the  next  10-15  years.  The\nTechnical  Working  Group  on  RH  formed  under  SAP  has  identified  four  components  of  the\npackage as priorities during the 9th five-year plan (1998\u20132003), including the most cost-effective\ninterventions  addressing  the  needs  of  the  poor.19  These  are  FP,  maternal  health  and  safe\nmotherhood,  infant  health  care,  and  RTIs  and  STDs.  Strategic  priorities  are  targeted  public\neducation,  increasing  coverage  of  FHWs,  integrated  health  and  FP  services,  training  of\nmidwives, and emergency obstetric care.\n\n28.\nThe  Government  is  currently  undertaking  major  institutional  reforms  in  the  RH  sector.\nThe  initial  plan  to  merge  MOH  and  MOPW  into  one  ministry  of  health  and  population  welfare\nhas  been  put  on  hold  and  is  under  review  by  a  Government  committee.  MOPW  is  moving\ntoward further integration with social services and women's development. At the provincial level,\nservices will continue to be integrated. The community-based lady health workers (LHWs) and\nfemale  VBFPWs  have  been  merged  into  FHWs  under  the  NPFP.  The  provinces  would  like  to\ntake  over  the  PWP  and  the  NPFP,  but  cannot  do  so  due  to  financial  constraints.  The\nGovernment has agreed to decentralize these programs while continuing to finance them during\nthe  next  plan  period,  as  part  of  the  provincial  RH  programs.  While  this  reflects  strong  political\ncommitment  to  the  sector,  such  commitment  has  not  been  matched  by  financial  resources\n(para. 21).\n\n29.\nThe situation is further complicated under the Government\u2019s devolving policy of power.\nDevolution  to  the  district  level  took  place  in  August  2001,  with  transfer  of  many  provincial\nfunctions to the districts. Each district government will be given a block grant, part of which is to\nbe  used  by  the  DHPT  for  health  and  population  welfare.  In  principle,  it  is  up  to  the  district  to\ndecide how to spend the funds, although initially there will be certain directives for spending in\neach  sector.  As  the  province  will  have  no  direct  control,  it  may  be  reluctant  to  get  involved  in\ndistrict  priority  setting.  Regulations,  procedures,  and  guidelines  for  the  district  government  are\nstill being developed and are expected to be in place by 1 July 2002.\n\n                  \n\n17 Government of Pakistan, Poverty Reduction Cell, Planning Commission, and Policy Wing, Finance Division. 2001.\n\nInterim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP).

Assistance  from  other  funding  agencies  includes  support  for  the  PWP,  projects  in\nMOH,  and  RH  activities  in  the  private  and  NGO  sectors  (Appendix  5).  The  PWP,  with  a  total\nbudget  of  PRs2.6  billion  in  FY2001,  is  receiving  mainly  external  assistance  from  SAPPII\nsources,  UN  agencies,  and  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA).  Due  to  a\nshortfall in external assistance and a fiscal crisis in FY2001, SAPPII finances 40 percent of the\nPWP  and  20  percent  of  federal  MOH  programs  with  RH-related  activities  (programs  for\nimmunization,  LHWs,  health  education,  HIV/AIDS  control,  and  malaria  control).  However,\nSAPPII  financing  will  stop  in  June  2002.  JICA  recently  completed  a  hospital  in  Islamabad  for\ntraining and referral services. The World Bank and DFID are funding the Northern Areas Health\nProject ($27 million). ADB, United Nation\u2019s Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and the Organization of\nPetroleum-Exporting  Countries  support  the  Women\u2019s  Health  Project  (footnote  2).  This  project\nsupports the development of 20 women-friendly district health systems; it also supports federal\nprograms, human resource development, and NGOs targeting these districts.\n\n31.\nSeveral  bilateral  sources  are  providing  assistance  that  directly  complements  the\nProject's activities in the RH sector. ADB maintains close coordination with these sources. DFID\nis  assisting  NGOs to  provide RH services and social marketing of contraceptives (\u00a312 million,\n$17 million equivalent). The Kredietanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau has also financed social marketing.\nThe European Commission (EC), through the Rural Social Development Program, is assisting\nfive  umbrella  NGOs  and  the  EC/United  Nation\u2019s  Population  Fund  (UNFPA)  initiative  for  RH\n($2.8 million). The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) assists NGOs through a\nsmall-scale Women-in-Development Project (Canadian $5.2 million). JICA plans to expand RH\nactivities  countrywide,  targeting  the  poor  through  local  NGOs.  DFID,  EC,  the  United  States\nAgency for International Development, and others are planning to increase support for the NGO\nsector.\n\n32.\nADB  also  maintains  close  cooperation  with  the  UN  agencies  involved  in  RH.  UNFPA\naims to enhance the RH status of women, men, and adolescents; promote RH and reproductive\nrights,  gender  equity,  and  equality;  and  achieve  sustainable  development.  UNICEF  has\nlaunched  a  Women's  Health  Program  to  create  awareness  about  people\u2019s  responsibility  for\nsaving  women  from  unnecessary  deaths,  enhance  women's  status  and  self-esteem,  provide\nEmOC,  and  train  birth  attendants.  UNICEF  in  Sindh  Province  is  upgrading  safe  motherhood\nservices in two districts with the support of the Bill Gates Foundation.\n\n33.\nAmong  other  benefits,  SAP  provided  a  mechanism  for  better  aid  coordination  and\ntargeting.  UN  agencies  and  JICA  also  participated  in  SAP  aid  coordination  meetings.  During\nSAP  missions,  it  became  evident  that  there  was  a  major  gap  in  financing  the  RH  program,\nparticularly after the close of SAPPII in June 2002. The Government requested ADB to support\nthe RH sector. The provinces requested ADB to target those districts not receiving any external\nassistance for RH so far, including many of the poorer districts. The coordinating mechanisms\nestablished under SAP will be maintained even after the close of SAPPII.\n\n\f10\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\nAccording to the sector synthesis,20 the designs of ADB-financed health and population\n34.\nprojects21 were generally in line with the Government's priorities and programs, and appropriate\nin  scope  and  strategies.  The  projects  had  a  strong  focus  on  improving  access  to  basic  health\nservices for the poor, women, and children; and training of female health staff and managers.\nThe evaluation noted further that merely providing health facilities was not sufficient to improve\ncoverage,  and  more  attention  should  have  been  given  to  district  management  and  training.\nMore recent projects present an integrated health systems development approach based on in-\ndepth analysis of institutional constraints and efforts to address the shortfall through policy and\ninstitutional reforms, capacity building, and partnerships.\n\nImplementation  problems  caused  on  average  two  years  of  project  delay.  The  project\n35.\nperformance  audit  report  of  the  Second  Health  and  Population  Project22  noted  several\nproblems:  (i)  lack  of  preparedness  of  the  Government  agencies  concerned,  (ii)  lack  of\nmanagement  skills  and  understanding  of  ADB  procedures,  (iii)  frequent  transfers  of  key\npersonnel,  (iv)  lack  of  aid  agency  cooperation,  and  (v) slow  implementation  of  civil  works.\nProject Directors were appointed late and transferred frequently, and often lacked competency\nand  authority.  The  SAPPII  midterm  review  in  2000  observed  that  the  limited  staff  capacity  at\nprovincial and district levels is slowing down program implementation.\n\n36.\nA review of other external assistance identified a number of critical factors that improve\noutcomes: strong political commitment, alignment with the Government's core program, building\na  pool  of  public  health  professionals,  access  to  technical  assistance,  streamlining  of\nadministrative procedures, and incentive packages. The sustainability of project benefits largely\ndepended on (i) Government commitment, (ii) the level of incremental costs of projects, (iii) the\ninclusion  of  these  costs  in  the  regular  budget,  and  (iv)  the  continuing  presence  of  adequately\ntrained staff. The project design provides several actions to mitigate delays and improve project\nquality. The Project will enhance management capacity by training, delegating responsibilities,\nstrengthening RH Directorates, and providing additional staff inputs.\n\n37.\nRegarding  RH,  the  projects  show  that  FHWs  are  effective,  and  that  it  is  possible  to\nrecruit them from traditional communities. Communication strategies have generally also been\nsuccessful.  However,  the  fact  that  the  district  executive  officer  (health)  and  medical  officers  in\ncharge  of  health  facilities  often  do  not  give  priority  to  MCH/FP  services  has  hampered  the\nimpact  of  MCH/FP  programs.  Therefore,  a  strong  institutional  commitment  to  RH  is  essential.\nRH  projects  should  be  an  integral  part  of  district  health  system  development.  This  will  also\nimprove  the  sustainability  of  RH  interventions.  The  international  aid  community,  urgently\nseeking  results,  has  shifted  to  a  revival  of  vertical  programs  for  the  control  of  infectious\ndiseases,  resulting  in  a  fragmented  and  unsustainable  campaign  approach  to  resolving  public\nhealth  problems.  It  is  important  that  the  Government  and  funding  agencies  adhere  to  an\nintegrated PHC approach in Pakistan.\n\n                  \n\n20 Asian Development Bank. 1997.

It  states\nthat every person must have access to basic education and PHC. It emphasizes the correlation\nbetween  family  size  and  self-perpetuating  poverty,  and  promotes  enhancing  the  quality  of\nwomen's lives by giving priority to providing accessible RH services. The Project addresses the\nthree  core  pillars  of  the  strategy:  it  is  targeting  RH  services  for  the  poor,  which  will  help  them\nimprove their livelihood. ADB's poverty reduction strategy also emphasizes that denial of basic\nservices to the poor is not just a matter of lack of investment, but often a result of governance\nproblems  and  lack  of  participation  by  the  poor.  The  strategy  promotes  sound  public\nadministration  and  expenditure  management \nto  promote  pro-poor  growth  and  social\ndevelopment;  and  devolution  of  public  services  to  the  lowest  appropriate  level  of  government.\nThe Project contributes to improving governance and devolving services.\n\n39.\nADB's  country  assistance  plan  for  Pakistan's  health  sector  focuses  on  (i)  improving\npublic  sector  governance  and  efficiency  by  strengthening  management  and  public-private\npartnership, and (ii) increasing equity by improving access of women to quality health services.\nIn addition, ADB's focus on girls' education offer important opportunities for synergy.\n\nIn line with ADB's health policy, ADB's approach in the health sector is threefold.24 First,\n40.\nit aims to ensure that the poor and vulnerable have access to PHC. Pakistan's PHC network is\nquite  extensive.  However,  women  have  less  access  to  PHC  and  carry  the  burden  of  high\nfertility. Therefore, ADB focuses on improving women's health, including RH, while other funding\nagencies provide complementary support for control of communicable diseases. Second, it aims\nto improve governance, efficiency, and sustainability in the health sector through health sector\nreform, including support for integration of services, devolution, public-private partnership, and\nprivate  sector  regulation.  Third,  it  aims  to  improve  the  quality  of  project  design  and\nimplementation  through  a  health  systems  approach,  district  level  participatory  planning,\nmanagement capacity building, and monitoring and evaluation including district surveys. These\npriorities are reflected in the project design.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n41.\nADB  has  been  in  continuous  dialogue  with  the  Government  on  programmatic  and\ninstitutional  strategies  to  improve  the  RH  sector.  Through  SAP  and  directly,  ADB  staff  have\nmaintained dialogue with the ministries, provinces, funding agencies, and other agencies on RH\nissues.  ADB  is  supporting  a  long-term  RH  consultant25  who  serves  as  the  secretary  to  the\nTechnical  Working  Group  for  RH  of  SAP.  ADB  has  been  assisting  with  development  of\nprovincial  RH  policies  and  programs.  These  programs  would  combine  Government  and  aid\nagency  inputs  into  a  comprehensive  RH  approach  for  each  province.  The  Project  has  been\ndesigned to support the development of these provincial policies and programs.\n\nThe  Government's  Ten  Year  Perspective  Plan  (2001-2011)26  promotes  integration  of\n42.\nhealth  and  FP  services,  primarily  because  FP  has  become  more  acceptable  and  combined\nservices are more efficient. The Planning and Development Division has produced district maps\n\n                  \n\n23 Asian Development Bank. 1999.

Islamabad.\n\n\f12\n\nshowing  all  public  health  and  population  services  to  help  rationalize  the  network  of  services.\nADB has been supportive  of this integration of services. Integration of health and FP services\nwas initiated through combined annual operational plans under SAP. ADB has also highlighted\nthe  risks  of  integration  that  need  to  be  mitigated,  including  possible  loss  of  focus  on  FP.  The\nintegration  of  FP  services  within  the  larger  domain  of  health  services  requires  prior  action  in\nbuilding the capacity of RH Directorates, DHPTs, and health services.\n\n43.\nADB  has  been  discussing  options  to  safeguard  financing  of  RH  activities  at  the  district\nlevel.  Under the devolution, district governments have been given administrative and financial\npowers  to  assume  many  of  the  functions  previously  held  by  the  provinces.  The  role  of  the\nprovincial  level  will  eventually  be  limited  to  ensuring  good  governance,  policy  and  technical\nguidance,  training,  monitoring  and  resource  mobilization.  The  implementation  of  RH  activities\nwill  depend  on  the  district  government\u2019s  political  priorities.  ADB  has  been  discussing  ways  to\nsafeguard health services including RH, targeting allocations and performance standards. The\nProject will help to promote, manage, and finance RH services in the devolved system.\n\nADB  has  been  promoting  the  rationalization  of  the  package  of  RH  services,  so  that\n44.\nlimited public resources are used for the most cost-effective interventions benefiting mainly the\npoor.  A  broad-based  planning  process  has  resulted  in  a  rationalized  RH  package  including\nfamily planning, maternal care, infant care, control of RTI and STDs, and related education. This\nis to be made available to the entire population.\n\n45.\nCompared  with  FP  services  and  control  of  infectious  diseases,  safe  motherhood\nservices are seriously neglected. ADB has also supported Pakistan through a regional technical\nassistance  to  strengthen  the  safe  motherhood  approach.27  ADB  and  UNICEF  are  currently\ndiscussing  with  MOH  and  MOPW  how  to  further  develop  safe  motherhood  policies  within  the\nframework of the RH approach, which hinges on birth preparedness, timely referral, and access\nto  quality  EmOC.  MOH's  commitment  to  redress  these  imbalances  is  increasing.  The\nGovernment  is  highly  concerned  about  harmful  practices  of  untrained  TBAs  and  unsafe\nabortions that continue to contribute significantly to maternal mortality. The Government wants\nevery  birth  to  be  attended  by  a  skilled  person.  ADB  has  proposed  that  FHWs  who  have  done\nwell be given the opportunity to become a domiciliary midwife or enter the career development\nsystem of LHV and public health nurse. Within the public health services, the shortage of female\nstaff is created partly by a limited number of positions for female staff, and by the fact that some\nof these positions are being occupied by male staff. Adding a female paramedics in each rural\nfacility would help reduce female staff absenteeism, and improve 24-hour coverage and social\nacceptability.\n\n46.\nADB  and  the  Government  have  been  discussing  the  pricing  of  contraceptives.  The\nGovernment carries the burden of paying for contraceptives used in the public services. While\nexpenditures  for  contraceptives  are  currently  reimbursable  under  SAPPII,  there  is  no  definite\nplan  for  financing  contraceptives  after  SAPPII  closes  in  June  2002.  The  chronic  shortage  of\ncontraceptives in the vast network of health services is partly due to a policy difference between\nMOPW  and  MOH  in  pricing  contraceptives.  MOPW's  policy  is  to  charge  a  nominal  fee  for\ncontraceptives  to  improve  accountability.  PHDs  provide  contraceptives  free.  This  issue  has\nbeen brought to the attention of the Government, which, in view of the high level of poverty in\nrural  communities  and  urban  slums,  decided  to  allow  FHWs  to  provide  contraceptives  free  of\ncharge at grassroots level.\n\n27 TA 5825-REG: Strengthening Safe Motherhood Programs, for $700,000, approved on 24 December 1998.\n\n                  \n\n\f13\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nPakistan's rapid population growth at the rate of 2.3 percent per annum has exacerbated\n47.\npoverty and negated the impact of development in the last decade. While fertility is declining, it\nhas  the  potential  to  accelerate  given  the  high  unmet  demand  for  FP.  Health  status  indicators\nhave not improved much over the past decade. The maternal mortality ratio is still very high due\nto poor birth practices at community, primary, and hospital levels. Much more work is needed at\nall  levels  to  make  motherhood  safer.  Better  maternal  care  would  substantially  reduce  infant\nmortality, including that caused by infections and malnutrition.\n\n48.\nThe Government accords high priority to improving the poor health status of women and\nchildren, and reducing high population growth. It seeks to accelerate the pace of fertility decline,\nintroduce  quality  RH  services,  and  promote  gender  equity  and  women  empowerment.  It  is\nstrengthening its RH policy, particularly for safe motherhood. The Government plans a transition\nfrom  separate  FP  and  MCH  services  to  the  RH  approach  to  improve  the  acceptability  and\nefficiency  of  RH  services.  The  Government  gives  priority  to  expanding  RH  in  poor  and\nunderserved  districts,  and  involving  NGOs  and  other  stakeholders.  The  Government\u2019s\ncommitment to RH has been demonstrated by a significant increase in its funding for RH in the\npast decade.\n\n49.\nThe  Project  is  targeting  34  districts  in  the  third  and  fourth  quartiles  in  terms  of  social\nranking, excluding those targeted by other projects. At least 50 percent of project beneficiaries\nwill  be  poor.  The  proposed  interventions  are  simple,  inexpensive,  and  cost-effective;  they  will\naddress  the  needs  of  the  poor  and  support  sustainable  development.  ADB  has  successfully\nassisted the Government's PWP to achieve the targets for the 8th five-year plan. Recurrent cost\nimplications after project completion are estimated at only 2 percent of the Government's health\nbudget. The project design is in line with ADB's poverty reduction strategy, policy for the health\nsector, and country strategy.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n50.\nThe overall goal of the Project is to improve the RH status of families, reduce maternal\nand  infant  mortality,  and  reduce  population  growth.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  improving\nwomen\u2019s  health  and  social  status  and  reducing  poverty.  The  objectives  are  to:  (i)  improve  the\nquality,  access  and  acceptance  of  RH  services  in  34  poor  and  underserved  districts,  and  (ii)\nstrengthen the sector\u2019s capacity for RH services in the context of the Government\u2019s restructuring\nprocess, including though NGOs and the private sector.\n\n51.\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  nation-wide,  with  focus  on  34  selected  districts  in  4\nprovinces  (10  in  Punjab  and  8  each  in  Balochistan,  North-West  Frontier  Province  and  Sindh).\nSix components will address the project objectives:\n\n1.\n\nImprove the Quality of RH Services\n\n52.\nThe  Project  will  improve  the  quality  of  RH  services  by  introducing  the  RH  package,\nproviding  in-service  training,  and  integrating  services.  With  the  assistance  of  the  technical\nworking group, the Project will develop the RH package and delivery system into a skills-based\ntraining program. Consulting services will be provided for developing standard RH practices and\n\n\f14\n\ncurricula,  and  training  of  trainers.  The  Project  will  provide  in-service  training  for  LHWs,  male\nVBFPWs, midwives, LHVs, family welfare workers, and female and male medical officers, and\norientation  of  other  staff  in  the  targeted  districts.  The  in-service  training  will  be  use  modern\nteaching  methodologies  with  substantial  hands-on  practice.  The  training  will  focus  on  FP,\nmaternal  health  including  safe  motherhood,  infant  health,  and  management  of  RTI  including\nHIV/AIDS. The Project will also introduce a standardized technical and managerial supervision\nsystem, with logistic support for monitoring and field supervision. The Project will upgrade basic\nEmOC  services  in  250  rural  health  centers  and  subdistrict  hospitals.  It  will  also  assist  about\n2,500  basic  health  and  population  welfare  facilities  in  the  targeted  districts  with  minor  repairs\nand supplementary equipment and supplies.\n\n2.\n\nImprove Access to RH Care for the Poor\n\n53.\nThe Project will improve access at community and hospital levels. The Project will train,\nsupply,  and  supervise  4,400  female  and  1,200  male  FHWs  in  the  targeted  districts.  Twenty-\neight  mobile  service  units  will  be  added  and  19  will  be  refurbished  for  areas  where  women\u2019s\nmobility  is  restricted  and  where  it  is  difficult  to  operate  facilities.  The  Project  will  add  33  RH\ncenters  and  upgrade  8  RH  centers  to  respond  to  the  increasing  demand  for  surgical\ncontraception. Only 20 percent of hospitals in the project area provide 24-hour comprehensive\nemergency  obstetric  services.  In  each  district,  one  hospital  will  be  upgraded  to  provide\ncomprehensive  EmOC.  The  referral  system  will  be  promoted  and  made  more  user-friendly\nthrough better marketing.\n\n3.\n\nPromote RH for Specific Target Groups\n\n54.\nThe  Project  will  promote  awareness  of  RH  needs  and  services,  and  create  a  more\nconducive  environment  through  advocacy  among  specific  target  groups  using  interpersonal\ncommunications  (IPC),  group  media,  and  mass  media.  The  Project  will  revive  the  Federal\nCommunication  Advisory  Group  to  implement  the  IEC  component,  assist  funding  agencies  to\ncomplement each other\u2019s work, adopt common themes and standardize messages, and utilize\nresources in the most effective manner. The Health Education and Nutrition Cells in the targeted\ndistricts will be supported with training in new IEC methods, materials and operational support.\n\n55.\nThe Project will develop IPC skills of FHWs and health staff through on-the-job training,\nand provide IEC materials and support services through the district health and nutrition officers.\nA  telephone  hotline  will  be  introduced  at  the  district  level.  Religious  scholars  and  male  FHWs\nwill discuss RH-related issues with local leaders and males. Group media activities will include\n\u201cvideo  on  wheels\u201d  based  on  successful  experiences  in  other  countries.  The  activity  will  be\ncarried  out  in  collaboration  with  \"town  storming\",  a  multimedia  marketing  strategy  used  for\nadvocacy among local leaders, men, women, and adolescents. Commercial spots will be used\nduring  shows  to  help  offset  the  costs.  FHWs,  in  collaboration  with  local  NGOs,  will  organize\nward  meetings.  Private  sector  firms  will  produce  videos  on  different  topics  for  these  ward\nmeetings,  which  will  be  dubbed  in  six  local  languages.  Audio/video  materials  developed  by\nNGOs  will  also  be  acquired  and  used.  As  television  and  radio  also  reach  the  low-income\npopulation,  these  mass  media  will  be  used  to  convey  information  regarding  FP,  EmOC,  and\nother RH issues. The Project will support three formats: short spots, songs, and drama serials.\nRadio producers from the 18 radio stations in Pakistan will be trained in producing RH spots and\nprograms for radio broadcast.\n\n\f15\n\n4.\n\nStrengthen RH Management Capacity\n\n56.\nThe  Project  will  assist  the  Government  to  strengthen  the  planning,  management,  and\nmonitoring  of  RH  services,  within  the  context  of  integration  of  services,  decentralization  to  the\nprovinces,  and  devolution  to  the  districts.  The  federal  and  provincial  joint  coordination\ncommittees  will  provide  guidance  and  each  steering  committee  will  oversee  implementation.\nThe Project will strengthen the federal and provincial directorates of RH and project coordinating\nunits (PCUs) with consulting services, staff, training, and logistics to support implementation in\ndistricts and training institutions, and plan a comprehensive RH program in each province. It will\nalso strengthen the health education directorates through fellowships.\n\n57.\nThe  Project  will  support  the  DHPT  in  each  targeted  district  through  additional  staff,\ntraining, and technical support. Guidelines and training material developed under the Women's\nHealth Project will be used to conduct district surveys, prepare five year and annual plans, and\nprovide  training  for  the  district  and  subdistrict  management  teams  in  planning,  procurement,\nlogistics,  monitoring,  and  personnel  and  financial  management.  A  project  cell  in  the  district\nhealth office, with a full-time planning/procurement officer and an accounts assistant, will serve\nas the project implementation unit at district level.\n\n5.\n\nDevelop Human Resources for RH\n\n58.\nThe component will strengthen the preservice training capacity for health staff concerned\nwith  RH  services.  The  Project  will  upgrade  12  midwifery  schools  in  the  targeted  districts,  and\nsupport  2,000  students  from  underserved  areas  to  attend  midwifery  school.    The  Project  will\nimprove  23  public  health  schools  to  improve  the  training  of  LHVs.  Trainers  will  be  trained  in\nmodern teaching methodologies, evaluation techniques, curriculum development, IPC skills, and\nhands-on supervised clinical training. In addition, new sites for practical training will be identified\nsuch as subdistrict hospitals, to improve skills training. Adequate facilities, equipment, transport,\nfurniture, and supplies will be made available as needed. The Project will upgrade 3 population\nwelfare  training  institutes  for  training  of  male  VBFPWs  in  RH  management;  and  add  3  and\nupgrade 7 regional training schools for training in clinical RH services. The training of LHWs will\nbe relocated from PHC centers to subdistrict hospitals to improve skills training.\n\n6.\n\nHarnessing NGO and Private Sector capacity\n\n59.\nThe  Project  aims  to  use  the  potential  of  NGOs  and  the  private  sector  to  expand  RH\nservices. The Project will provide training and supportive activities to 2,500 private practitioners,\n4,000  female  paramedics,  and  8,000  drug  shopkeepers  to  expand  and  improve  the  quality  of\nRH  services.  A  large  number  of  NGOs  are  providing  RH  services  including  advocacy  for\nwomen\u2019s  status  and  rights,  community  mobilization,  human  resource  development,  health\neducation  and  communication,  preventive  and  curative  RH  services,  and  social  marketing  of\ncontraceptives. Studies have shown that the poor are paying for emergency services (mostly for\ndrugs that are out of stock), at the \"free\" public sector facilities,28 and are willing to pay at private\nsector facilities near their homes, provided the charges are reasonable.29 Through established\nNGOs,  the  Project  will  support  contracting  of  NGOS  to  expand  RH  services  in  the  targeted\ndistricts,  including  social  mobilization  and  education  activities,  training,  contracting  of  staff,\n\n                  \n\n28 TA 2576-PAK: Public Private Health Partnership in Health, approved on 31 May 1996 for $ 450,000 (JSF).   \n29 Faisel, A. 1998.

This\n\n\f17\n\nwill  cover  the  total  foreign  exchange  cost,  and  an  estimated  $20.3  million  equivalent  in  local\ncurrency cost (69 percent of the total local currency cost). The term of the proposed loan will be\n32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1.0 percent per annum\nduring  the  grace  period,  and  1.5  percent  per  annum  thereafter.  CIDA,  DFID,  and  UNFPA\nindicated  their  interest  in  supporting  project  implementation  through  separate  contributions  for\nconsulting  services,  curriculum  development,  and  medical  and  contraceptive  supplies.  The\nGovernment will finance $9.0 million equivalent of the project cost. During the project period, the\ncounterpart funds for federal programs will continue to be paid from the federal budget in case\nfederal programs are decentralized to the provinces.\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nSource\n\nADB\nGovernment\nTotal\n\n     \n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nPercent\n\n15.7\n0.0\n15.7\n\n20.3\n   9.0\n29.3\n\n36.0\n9.0\n45.0\n\n80\n20\n100\n\n62.\nThe provision of financing for the local currency cost is considered justified under ADB\u2019s\nlocal  currency  financing  policy.30  Assistance  is  required  to  meet  the  local  currency  cost  of\ndevelopment projects because public finance is under serious pressure, and a low level of per\ncapita income constrains national savings. The Government has taken steps to improve the rate\nof  national  savings  by  enhancing  revenue  collections,  improving  the  efficiency  of  public\nexpenditure,  improving  incentives  for  private  sector  participation  in  revenue-generating  capital\nmarket  reforms,  and  encouraging  private  sector  participation  in  revenue-generating  public\nsector projects. However, the current international crisis has significantly increased the resource\ngap, which will continue for some time due to a slowdown in large capital investments.\n\n63.\nFrom a technical perspective, the financing of local currency costs is also justified. RH\nservices under the Project disproportionately benefit the poor, but involve few foreign exchange\ncosts. Most inputs required for RH services are locally available, and thus the foreign exchange\ncost is modest.\n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nProject Management\n\nAt  federal  level,  a  joint  coordination  committee  will  meet  quarterly  to  provide  overall\n64.\npolicy  and  program  guidance  aiming  at  expanding,  improving  the  quality,  integrating  and\ndecentralizing  RH  services.  The  committee  will  be  co-chaired  by  the  secretaries  health  and\npopulation  welfare  and  include  representation  of  the  ministries  of  finance  and  planning  and\ndevelopment,  the  provinces,  and  civil  society.  Each  province  will  have  a  provincial  joint\ncoordination  committee  for  policy  and  program  guidance,  which  will  meet  quarterly.  It  will  be\nchaired  by  the  additional  chief  secretary  or  chairperson  of  the  planning  board  and  include\nrepresentatives of the departments of finance and planning and development, districts and civil\n\n30 Asian Development Bank. 1995.

At district level, the DHPT will be advised by its district government. The organization\nchart is in Appendix 7.\n\n65.\nIn view of the Government's decentralization policy, there will be six executing agencies\n(EAs): at federal level, MOPW and MOH, and four PHDs, one in each of the 4 provinces. Each\nEA will have a steering committee that meets at least once a month to review project activities\nunder  the  responsibility  of  the  EA  and  take  steps  to  improve  implementation.  Each  EA  will  be\nstrengthened  with  a  PCU  to  coordinate  project  implementation  with  ADB  and  the  concerned\ndistricts,  directorates,  programs,  and  institutions.  Staff  for  each  PCU  will  include  a  full-time\nproject coordinator (reporting to the director of RH or equivalent), a training expert, an accounts\nofficer,  and  a  monitoring  officer  (all  with  qualifications  and  experience  acceptable  to  ADB).  A\nproject  implementation  unit  will  be  established  in  each  PPWD,  with  a  project  implementation\nofficer and an accounts officer. MOPW will be responsible for overall coordination.\n\n66.\nAs the basis for devolved project implementation, each DHPT will prepare five year and\nannual  district  health  plans,  with  the  support  of  the  PHD  and  PPWD.  The  concerned  joint\ncoordination committee will approve the district plans. The district plans will specify RH activities\nin the district, including advocacy, education, training, services, rehabilitation, procurement, and\nmonitoring. Each DHPT will have a small project cell with an assistant project coordinator and\naccounts assistant to coordinate and monitor project implementation activities.\n\n67.\nEach  EA  has  its  responsibilities  in  supporting  the  districts  to  develop  RH  services.\nMOPW will be responsible for developing population welfare and RH training institutions, media\nactivities,  curriculum  development,  contracting  NGOs,  and  major  civil  works.  PPWDs  will  be\nresponsible  for  upgrading  their  clinical  and  nonclinical  services,  male  VBFPWs,  and  private\nsector  training.  MOH  will,  through  NPFP,  work  with  the  targeted  districts  to  increase  the\ncoverage  and  improve  the  quality  of  LHWs.  PHDs  will  upgrade  primary  and  hospital  EmOC\nservices and improve the training of midwives, paramedics, and doctors.\n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nThe Project will be implemented over six years, from January 2002 to December 2007.\n\n68.\nThe implementation schedule is in Appendix 8.\n\n3. \n\nProcurement of Goods and Services\n\nAll  procurement  for  the  ADB-financed  portion  of  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with\n69.\nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The project coordinators of the PCUs will be responsible for\nprocurement  under  the  guidance  and  supervision  of  the  concerned  steering  committee.  A\nprocurement  consultant  will  assist  the  project  coordinators.  The  PCU  will  (i)  propose  bid\npackages and procurement methods; (ii) prepare detailed materials lists and specifications; (iii)\nwhere  applicable,  determine  prequalification  criteria,  evaluation  criteria,  and  completion  of\ndelivery  periods;  and  (iv)  evaluate  bids  and  certify  payments.  The  project  coordinator  will\napprove  contracts  and  certify  payments.  Where  required,  copies  of  contracts  and  supporting\ndocuments  will  be  forwarded  to  ADB  for  record  and  if  necessary  for  approval.  Detailed  needs\nassessment will be done before initiating any civil works or procurement of equipment.\n\na. \n\nCivil Works\n\n70.\nThe  Project  will  upgrade  hospitals  for  EmOC  and  RH  services,  and  improve  training\nfacilities.  As  all  civil  works  contracts  under  the  Project  will  be  small  in  value,  scattered,  and\n\n\f19\n\nunlikely to attract the interest of international contractors, they will be packaged, and awarded\non the basis of local competitive bidding in accordance with Government procedures acceptable\nto  ADB.  Civil  works  contracts  costing  less  than  $50,000  may  be  awarded  by  force  account\nprocedures of the respective EAs. Government engineers will prepare the plans for civil works.\nThe packages will be prepared based on the district plans.\n\nb. \n\nEquipment and Materials\n\nRelated equipment and material will be combined into packages to simplify procurement.\n71.\nSupply  contracts  costing  more  than  $500,000  will  be  procured  by  international  competitive\nbidding  procedures.  Supply  contracts  of  $500,000  equivalent  or  less  will  follow  international\nshopping procedures, except for vehicles and basic equipment and supplies for health facilities\nand  training  institutions  such  as  hospital  beds  and  furniture.  These  items  are  locally\nmanufactured  and  unlikely  to  attract  foreign  suppliers,  and  will  be  procured  through  local\ncompetitive bidding in accordance with Government procedures acceptable to ADB. Equipment\nor  materials  costing  less  than  $100,000  per  item  may  be  procured  by  direct  purchase.\nEquipment and materials costing less than $1,000 may be procured by the DHPT according to\nGovernment procedures acceptable to ADB.\n\nc.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n72.\nThe Project will support about 30 person-months of international, and about 180 person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  services,  to  be  contracted  through  a  firm.  The  international\nconsultants (person-months) will include a training specialist (6); an IEC specialist (6); a health\nmanagement  specialist  (6);  a  financial  management  specialist  (6  person-months),  and  a\nmonitoring  and  evaluation  consultant  (6).  The  domestic  consultants  will  include  the  chief\ntechnical adviser (60), an IEC specialist (24), a training specialist (48), a procurement specialist\n(12), a financial management specialist (18), and a monitoring and evaluation consultant (18).\nInternational and domestic consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB's\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and  other  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  for  recruiting\ndomestic consultants. The consultants may be attached to any PCU, but support all EAs. ADB\nhas agreed to the Government's request that the international consultants collaborate with the\ndomestic consultants. To ensure timely recruitment of consultants, the Government will prepare\nthe  invitation  to  bid  before  loan  effectiveness.  The  indicative  terms  of  reference  for  the\nconsultants are in Appendix 9.\n\nd.\n\nContracting of NGOs\n\n73.\nMOPW will award prequalified implementing NGOs with a contract to provide expansion\nof RH services according to the Government's local competitive bidding procedures acceptable\nto ADB. The contract will be based on a defined package of services proposed by the DHPT in\na  particular  district.  The  packages  will  generally  be  small,  costing  less  than  $100,000  per\ndistrict,  and  will  be  awarded  according  to  Government  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The\npackages  will  include  all  necessary  details  to  enable  the  implementing  NGOs  to  make  a  fair\nassessment  of  the  amount  of  work,  and  the  Government  to  assess  NGO  performance.  The\nsteering committee of MOPW will evaluate the proposals and award the contracts to the NGOs.\n\n74.\nIn view of limited capacity of the Government to administer NGOs, MOPW will contract\ncoordinating  NGOs,  or  make  any  other  arrangement  acceptable  to  ADB,  to  carry  out  the\nadministrative processing for the selection of these implementing NGOs to expand RH services.\nThe  coordinating  NGO  may  be  a  national  or  international  firm  with  suitable  qualifications.  The\n\n\f20\n\nresponsibilities of a coordinating NGO may include to (i) assist districts to prepare packages for\ncontracting  out  to  NGOs;  (ii)  provide  orientation  for  interested  NGOs;  (iii)  propose  the\nprocedures,  criteria  and  documentation  for  the  prequalifying,  selecting  and  monitoring  NGOs;\n(iv)  validate  NGO  capacity;  (v)  manage  the  contracting  procedures;  (vi)  provide  technical\nassistance  and  training;  and  (vii)  monitor  and  report  performance  of  NGOs.  The  coordinating\nNGO  will  be  appointed  through  the  Government's  local  competitive  bidding  procedure\nacceptable  to  ADB.  The  coordinating  NGO  will  maintain  accounting  and  auditing  standards\nacceptable to the Government and ADB.\n\n4.\n\nAccounts and Audit\n\n75.\nThe Government and provinces, acting through MOPW, MOH, and PHDs, will maintain\nrecords  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  proceeds  of\nthe  loan.  The  district  health  offices  will  also  maintain  separate  accounts  for  project  activities\nfollowing  the  same  standards.  Under  the  devolution  plan,  procedures  and  guidelines  in\nproviding  targeted  funds  to  the  district  are  available.  The  Government  will  ensure  full\ncompliance  with  the  guidelines  for  devolved  financial  management,  to  be  issued  by  the\nGovernment,  in  each  province  and  district.  The  Government  will  hire  an  international  and  a\ndomestic  financial  management  specialist  at  the  start  of  the  Project  to  bring  the  project\naccounting  system  up  to  accounting  standards  acceptable  to  the  Government  and  ADB,  with\nsufficient  internal  control,  and  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems  in  the  first  project\nyear.  In  each PCU,  a suitably qualified and trained accounting staff will be made available for\nthe Project. In each district, accounting standards will be verified before allowing use of the loan\nproceeds, and checked regularly. All EAs will ensure that accounts and financial statements are\naudited by auditors acceptable to ADB. In view of the dispersed scope of the Project, the EAs\nwill submit to ADB certified copies of audited accounts and financial statements, and the report\nof the auditor on these, not later than 12 months after the close of each fiscal year.\n\n5.\n\nDisbursement Procedures\n\n76.\nTo  expedite  project  implementation,  imprest  accounts  will  be  made  available  to  the  six\nEAs  to  provide  cash  advances  for  small  expenditures.  ADB  will  initially  deposit  an  amount\nbased  on  the  estimated  expenditures  of  six  months  and  not  exceeding  $250,000,  into  an\nimprest account with the State Bank of Pakistan or a commercial bank acceptable to ADB under\nthe  authority  of  MOPW,  MOH,  and  each  PHD.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  established,\nmanaged, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook\nof January 2001, as amended, and with detailed arrangements agreed by the Government and\nADB.  The  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  may  be  used  for  reimbursing  eligible  local  and\nforeign  expenditures  not  exceeding  $50,000  per  expenditure,  and  to  liquidate  advances  made\ninto the imprest accounts in accordance with the same guidelines. Because project activities will\ntake place in dispersed geographic areas where communication is difficult, simple mechanisms\nare  required  to  disburse  small  funds  quickly  through  decentralized  decision  making  while\nmaintaining acceptable levels of financial control. Accordingly, subaccounts will be established,\nand managed in the districts and institutions, following the same guidelines. The initial amount\nin these district and institution accounts will not exceed $10,000. The EA will provide funds to\nthe subaccounts at districts and institutions according to annual plans approved by the steering\ncommittee. The fund transfer mechanism will be finalized after January 2002 when the general\nadministrative  rules,  regulations,  and  guidelines  for  devolved  financial  management  are\nexpected to be in place.\n\n\f21\n\n6.\n\nReporting\n\n77.\nThe  PCU  will  prepare  quarterly  monitoring  reports  and  submit  them  to  ADB  within  one\nmonth of the end of each quarter. The reports will include (i) progress made, including aspects\nof  quality;  (ii)  delays  and  problems  encountered,  and  actions  taken  to  resolve  the  issues;\n(iii) compliance  with  loan  covenants;  (iv)  proposed  program  of  activities  and  inputs  required\nduring the next three months; and (v) maintenance and repairs. Each district and institution will\nreport  to  the  PCU.  The  Government  will  also  provide  the  baseline  and  end-of-project  survey\nreports in the second and sixth year of the Project. Within three months of physical completion\nof  the  Project,  the  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report.  The  report  will\ninclude the costs and compliance with loan covenants.\n\n7.\n\nMidterm Review\n\n78.\nIn addition to regular reviews, the Government and ADB will jointly undertake a midterm\nreview  of  the  Project  after  three  years  of  implementation.  This  will  be  preceded  by  a\nGovernment review led by MOPW, and will involve discussions with field staff and beneficiaries.\nThe  report  will  indicate  progress  toward  quantitative  and  qualitative  targets,  and  likely  project\nimpact  and  sustainability.  The  midterm  review  will  appraise  the  project  scope,  cost  estimates,\nimplementation arrangements, and compliance with loan covenants; and identify any issues to\nbe addressed to improve project impact and sustainability. The Government and ADB will jointly\ndecide on any changes needed in the design and implementation of the Project.\n\n8. \n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n79.\nBenefit monitoring and evaluation will play an important role in the success of the Project\nby  helping  it  to  remain  focused  on  project  performance  and  impact.  In  keeping  with  ADB\u2019s\nHandbook on benefit monitoring and evaluation, a small set of input, process, output, coverage\nand impact indicators has been selected to establish district baselines and targets. These data\nwill  be  collected  using  the  regular  monitoring  system  and  surveys.  The  chief  technical  adviser\nand  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  expert  will  supervise  project  evaluation.  A  summary  of  the\nbenefit monitoring and evaluation process and indicators is in Appendix 10.\n\n80.\nThe districts, with support of PCUs, will carry out baseline and end-of-project household\nsurveys  in  years  2  and  6  of  the  Project  to  obtain  coverage  and  impact  performance.  These\nsurveys will also serve general district health planning purposes for the district government. To\nassess  whether  project  benefits  are  reaching  the  poor,  data  will  be  collected  to  construct  a\nwealth  index.  The  household  surveys  will  use  the  methodology  and  organizational  approach\nused for the Women's Health Project, and use standardized indicators allowing comparison with\nother  surveys.    Simple  health  services  surveys  will  also  be  carried  out  in  years  2,  4  and  6  to\nobtain basic information on the resources and use of services, which will help, identify priorities\nfor improving service delivery and procurement.\n\nThe existing management information systems will be used for routine monitoring. They\n81.\nwill  be  improved  as  needed.  The  information  systems  will  track  project  inputs  and  service\nprocesses  and  outputs,  aggregated  by  district.  The  supervision  system  will  track  performance\nand  quality  of  service  using  a  standardized  checklist  of  indicators.  Client  satisfaction  will  be\nmonitored  through  surveys,  supervision  visits,  and  group  discussions.  The  districts  will  be\nresponsible for collecting data and reporting to the Government and ADB.\n\n\f22\n\n9.\n\nGood governance\n\n82.\nThe  Mission  explained  the  ADB  anticorruption  policy,  particularly  the  section  on  fraud\nand  corruption,  as  stated  in  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement  and Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants.\n\nF.\n\nThe Executing Agency\n\nMOPW, MOH and PHDs have gained experience in project implementation in previous\n83.\nADB  projects  in  the  health  and  population  sector.  MOH  and  PHDs  are  currently  implementing\nthe Women\u2019s Health Project. Staff with training and experience in ADB procedures are available\nat federal and provincial levels. Transfer of project coordinators has become less frequent. The\nGovernment  has  given  assurance  that  capable  project  staff  will  be  appointed  in  a  timely\nmanner.  Under  the  devolution  plan,  the  Government  supports  the  delegation  of  financial\nauthority  to  the  DHPT.  The  Government  has  given  the  assurance  that  competent  staff  will  be\navailable at district level to coordinate project implementation and manage the accounts.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\nfollow \n\nthe  Project  will \n\n84.\nThe Project will have minimal adverse environmental impact. The Government assured\nthat  the  site,  design  construction,  and  operations  for  any  improvements  made  to  the  physical\nfacilities  under \nthe  Government's  own  guidelines  and  ADB's\nEnvironmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects. The Government will ensure that\nproper waste disposal is included in the design of health facilities. Measures for handling refuse\nand  disposing  of  hazardous  medical  waste,  e.g.,  syringes  and  needles,  will  be  specifically\naddressed  in  the  design  and  operation  of  all  health  facilities.  The  Project  will  provide  training\nand  guidelines  for  provincial  and  district  health  office  staff  to  ensure  proper  medical  waste\nmanagement  in  all  health  facilities  under  their  responsibility.  In  the  medium  to  long  term,  the\nProject will have beneficial environmental impact through population control, as has been shown\nin estimates of international environmental agencies.\n\n2.\n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement\n\n85.\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  any  government-owned  land  used  for  construction\nunder  the  Project  does  not  involve  any  involuntary  resettlement.  In  the  event  such  land  has  a\nsquatter settlement, the Government will address the concerns of the squatter population in line\nwith ADB's policy on involuntary resettlement.\n\n3.\n\nSocial Analysis\n\na.\n\nPoor People\n\nAbout 50 percent of the population in the targeted districts are poor. The poor cannot be\n86.\ndetermined  by  location  or  clan,  but  by  the  socioeconomic  conditions  of  the  household.  Poor\nfamilies  are  found  in  any  village,  so  low-cost  services  are  needed  in  each  village.  About  two\nthirds  of  Pakistan\u2019s  population  do  not  have  access  to  adequate  basic  infrastructure.31  Poor\n\n31 Asian Development Bank. 2000. Reducing Poverty in Pakistan: Priorities for the Asian Development Bank.\n\n                  \n\n\f23\n\nvillage people form a major part of the population without access to health services or FHWs.\nThis is further discussed in the social assessment and action matrix (Appendix 11).\n\nb.\n\nTraditional Communities\n\n87.\nAmong  traditional  rural  communities,  the  strong  influence  of  religious  leaders  on  the\nsocial and moral acceptability of FP hinders the use of RH services. The fear of negative stigma\nand  apprehensions  over  sideeffects  are  major  reasons \nfor  men's  nonacceptance  of\ncontraceptives.  In  particular,  poor  and  illiterate  mothers  face  the  husband\u2019s  opposition  to  RH\ncare  including  FP.  Couples\u2019  contraceptive  use  often  depends  on  whether  they  have  a  son.32\nEven if delay in EmOC does not lead to a fatal outcome, it often results in lifelong disabilities of\nthe  mother  and \nthese\nconstraints(cid:190) media campaigns, IPC with religious leaders and male VBFPWs, improving access\nto LHWs, subsidy for essential drugs and contraceptives, and marketing of services.\n\nincludes  several  strategies \n\nthe  child.  The  Project \n\nface \n\nto \n\nc.\n\nEthnic Minorities\n\n88.\nEthnic  minorities  including  Hindus  and  Christians  constitute  only  5  percent  of  the\npopulation. These minority groups are generally not restricted in terms of female mobility, have\naccess to RH services, and often receive some form of support from NGOs or aid agencies. The\napproach  to  providing  services  to  these  minorities  is  to  make  the  project  efforts  suited  to  the\nculture  and  conditions  of  the  local  community,  e.g.,  education  programs  in  the  local  language\nand  tradition;  training  of  minority  community  members  as  FHW  and  midwife;  and  providing\nmobile  clinics  where  it  is  difficult  to  post  female  staff.  DHPTs  will  be  instructed  to  address  the\nissues of ethnic minorities in the district plan.\n\nd.\n\nGender Aspects\n\nthrough\nThe  Project  primarily  addresses  women\u2019s  health  and  nutrition  status \n89.\ninterventions targeted at women. Family health improvements resulting from the Project will also\nbenefit women by reducing the risk and burden of pregnancy and delivery, and the time spent\ncaring  for  family  members.  Women's  social  status  would  benefit  from  educating  males  and\nhealth staff. Also, the  Project will  primarily target female health staff, and provide employment\nfor  4,400  village  women.  Scholarships  will  be  available  to  help  village  women  get  additional\nbasic education if required before technical training. Health centers will be modified to provide\nprivacy for women during examination and treatment. Gender issues will be incorporated in the\ntraining courses. Women\u2019s use of health services will be monitored with specific indicators. The\nproject management will seek to appoint female staff.\n\ne.\n\nStakeholder Participation\n\n90.\nStakeholders  were  extensively  consulted  and  involved  during  the  preparation  of  the\nProject.  There  were  discussions  with  500  beneficiaries,  health  staff,  and  officers  through  field\nstudies,  workshops  and  meetings,  covering  all  provinces.  Results  of  group  discussions  with\nbeneficiaries  in  catchment  areas  of  previous  health  sector  projects  were  used  in  the  project\ndesign.  This  information  was  supplemented  with  a  household  survey,  which  provided\ninformation  on  health  service  availability,  health-seeking  behaviors,  and  financing  of  disease\nepisodes.  Major  health  projects  were  reviewed  and  discussed  with  external  funding  agencies,\n\n32  Mahmood,  N.  and  D.  Nayab.  1998.  Gender  Dimensions  of  Demographic  Change  in  Pakistan.

Teams  visited  targeted\ndistricts, consulted with local officials, and conducted a detailed needs assessment. Finally, the\neconomic  affairs  division,  planning  and  development  departments,  MOPW,  MOH,  PHDs,\nPPWDs,  and  50  NGOS  provided  substantial  guidance  for  the  project  design.  During\nimplementation, beneficiaries will participate in (i) advising on the health services, (ii) selecting\nand  supporting  FHWs,  (iii)  health  promotion  activities,  and  (iv) giving  poor  families  access  to\nhealth  services,  including  EmOC.  Project  evaluation  will  consult  beneficiaries  through  focus\ngroup discussions and surveys.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nFinancial and Economic Analysis\n\n1.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n91.\nThe  Project  has  been  designed  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  contain  public\nsector  expansion  and  recurrent  costs.  The  Project  supports  basic  integrated  health  and  FP\nservices, focusing on the most cost-effective interventions. The civil works have been limited to\nupgrading  and  rehabilitating  existing  facilities.  Three  types  of  incremental  recurrent  costs  are\nnecessary,  namely  (i)  contracting  FHWs  to  reach  populations  not  reached  so  far;  (ii)\nsupplementing the supply of essential drugs and contraceptives, partly paid for by households;\nand (iii) improving the quality of services. The result will be better utilization and more efficient\nuse  of  existing  infrastructure  and  human  resources.  However,  a  sustained  increase  in  budget\nallocation for salaries, supplies, training and supervision will also be needed. The total recurrent\nexpenditure for maintaining activities after project completion is estimated at 2 percent of total\npublic health expenditure.\n\n92.\nArrangements  are  in  place  to  sustain  the  modest  increase  in  recurrent  costs  resulting\nfrom  the  Project  and  to  increase  sector  spending  for  RH:  (i)  a  policy  framework  giving  high\npriority  to  RH,  (ii)  the  follow-up  to  a  SAP  framework  to  improve  financing  of  basic  social\nservices, and (iii) several policies to improve efficiency in the health sector. The Project will also\nsupport  RH  promotion  and  capacity  building  in  the  RH  directorates  to  increase  sustainability.\nSAP  has  given  high  priority  to  nonsalary  allocation,  which  has  increased  in  all  provinces  to\nabout  one  third  of  the  total  recurrent  allocation.  The  Project  also  supports  the  Government\u2019s\nefforts to improve efficiency by devolving federal and provincial responsibilities to the districts.\nThe merger of female VBFPWs and LHWs will also improve efficiency. An increased focus on\npromotive and preventive services should reduce the burden on curative services. Public-private\ninitiatives such as training of private practitioners and NGO support will help develop nonpublic\nservices.\n\n2.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\na.\n\nPublic Sector Intervention\n\n93.\nPublic investment in RH services can be justified in terms of efficiency and equity. Equity\narguments  in  favor  of  subsidized  health  services  are  strong  in  Pakistan,  where  income  and\nexpenditure surveys suggest that about one third of the population live below the poverty line.\n\n\f25\n\nThe provision of services by the public sector, in addition to their financing, is justified in\n94.\ncases where either private provision is inadequate, the public sector is a more efficient provider,\nand/or  consumers  exhibit  a  clear  preference  for  public  services.  The  Pakistan  Fertility  and\nFamily Planning Survey, 1996/97, shows that 72 percent of clients obtained contraceptive pills\nfrom the private sector outlets, while 60 percent sourced the pills from the public sector, 20 from\nsocial  marketing,  and  20  from  the  commercial  sector.  Similarly,  37  percent  of  clients  obtained\ninjections  from  the  private  sector,  and  4  percent  from  NGOs,  but  91  percent  of  the  injections\nwere financed by the Government. This suggests that the public sector has an important role in\nfinancing contraceptives, while the private sector is important in delivering them. However, this\nbalance needs to be understood in terms of market and institutional constraints. For rural areas,\nthe public sector will continue to have an important delivery function in the near future.\n\nThe private sector often does not provide a full range of RH services; and the costs are\n95.\nsubstantially higher than in the public sector. However, given the limited public sector capacity,\nthe  private  sector,  wherever  it  is  capable  of  providing  goods  and  services  in  an  efficient  and\ncost-effective manner, should be encouraged, and the possibility of public subsidies considered.\n \n96.\nIt appears that a higher proportion of the poor perceive RH problems as less important,\ndespite  their  being  more  common  among  the  poor.  In  view  of  the  population\u2019s  low  willingness\nand ability to pay, and with the profit-motivated private sector providing the services, it is feared\nthat  the  real  \u201ctarget  class\u201d  i.e.,  the  poor  class,  will  be  marginalized  and  the  relatively  affluent\nclasses,  mostly  residing  in  urban  centers,  will  be  served.  Thus,  to  ensure  wider  coverage  of\nservices for the rural poor, direct public service delivery is required.\n\nIf the public sector invests directly in RH service delivery rather than merely depending\n97.\non regulation, it will not only address the issue of poverty reduction, but also improve equity by\nreducing rural/urban imbalances. Gender balance, too, will improve as RH interventions address\nwomen's health besides promoting female employment.\n\nb.\n\nJustification for Increased Funding\n\n98.\nThe  level  of  public  sector  funding  is  concerned  with  the  requirements  to  meet  public\npolicy objectives and the existing capacity of the public sector delivery system.33 The budget for\nPWP  is  relatively  small,  and  the  budget  for  RH  activities  under  the  PHDs  is  not  much  larger.\nGiven  the  large  unmet  needs  of  RH  in  the  sector,  a  substantial  increase  in  allocations  is\njustified. In view of the current tight fiscal situation in the provinces, the federal Government has\nagreed to continue financing the federal programs during the next plan period.\n\n99.\nThe overall rate of utilization for the population and health sector allocations was above\n80  percent  during  the  1990s.  Devolving  the  administrative  and  delivery  system  is  expected  to\nimprove  program  effort.  This  will  include  procurement  of  drugs  and  contraceptives.  Making\nallocations available early in the fiscal year will also improve absorptive capacity and efficiency.\n\nc.\n\nUser Charges\n\n100.\nThe  share  of  health  care  expenditures  in  the  total  household  budget,  about  3  percent,\nremains  low  across  income  groups.  The  low-income  classes  in  Pakistan  dissave,  i.e.,  on\naverage, spend more than their incomes. This reflects their very low ability to pay for more, or\n\n33 All activities related to the population welfare sector are treated as development expenditure.\n\n                  \n\n\f26\n\nmore expensive services. The average monthly expenditures on health care increase as income\nlevels rise, reflecting that people want to pay for more or better health care if they can afford to.\n\n101.\nThe estimated cost of protection against conception for one year per couple is low.  The\nmonthly price of oral contraceptive pills, condoms, intrauterine devices, and depot injections are\nonly PRs3.00 in the public sector, reflecting a policy of subsidy for contraceptives.34 Imposition\nor  increase  of  user  charges  on  social  services  is  a  major  issue  in  Pakistan.  It  is  not  known\nwhether  raising  the  price  of  RH  services  will  affect  the  users'  ability  to  pay,  and  significantly\nreduce demand. MOPW suggests that a small fee may increase the use of services as people\nexpect to receive better services. While RH services are provided at nominal costs, clients often\nhave to purchase their own medicines and other supplies. As reported by one study, delivering\nin a Government facility costs on average PRs590 compared with the average nominal charge\nof  PRs24,  as  patients  have  to  purchase  their  own  medicines  from  private  drug  stores.  NGOs\nand private clinics were found to be more expensive.35\n\n102.\nThe rationale is strong for not increasing user charges for the services assisted by the\nProject.  The  Project  is  targeting  poor  and  underserved  rural  women.  While  families  may  be\nwilling  to  pay  for  medical  expenses,  these  may  not  be  within  the  household  budget,  or  may\naffect other essential expenditures like for food. Because of the low social status of women, they\nmay  be  denied  services  if  user  charges  are  increased.  Costs  attached  to  using  public  health\nservices such as transportation, medicine, and informal charges are already substantial. Given\nthe low level of public confidence in services at present, a substantial increase in user charges\nis  likely  to  result  in  reduced  utilization  of  services  and  efficiency.  Experience  has  shown  that\ncost  recovery  in  these  conditions  can  barely  cover  the  administrative  costs.  Therefore,  while\nincreasing  user  charges  may  have  potential  benefits  in  terms  of  improving  ownership,\naccountability, and transparency, it may have adverse effects on the poor, and will not help in\nfinancing  health  services.  In  this  context,  the  social  benefits  of  providing  the  service  to  low-\nincome groups most certainly outweigh the efficiency gains from cost recovery.\n\nd.\n\nCost Effectiveness\n\n103.\nIn health projects, an alternative approach in estimating project benefits is the disability\nadjusted  life  years  approach.  This  approach  involves  the  construction  of  a  composite  index  of\nthe  years  of  health  life  lost  due  to  disease,  disability,  or  death,  and  the  benefits  that  can  be\nachieved by saving those lost years. Based on the available data for RH diseases, the cost per\ndisability adjusted life years saved was calculated as $21. This is considered cost-effective by\ninternational standards (Appendix 12).\n\nB.\n\nSocial Dimensions and Poverty Impact\n\n1.\n\nPoverty and Health\n\n104.\nThere  is  a  strong  relationship  between  poverty  and  health.  In  the  poorest  households,\neven basic health care may not be affordable. Any serious illness including chronic diseases like\ntuberculosis  or  conditions  requiring  hospitalization,  and  any  loss  of  labor  that  reduces  the\nfamily\u2019s production capacity will result in food shortage and impoverishment. Access to quality\nhealth services provided under the Project will not only reduce direct and indirect costs of health\n\n                  \n\n34 Multi-donor Support Unit, Social Action Programme. 2000.

Further, savings in\nhousehold expenditures may help to reduce food shortages, and overcome income fluctuations\nthat  may  result  in  loss  of  assets,  bonded  labor,  and  migration.  The  very  poor  include  single\nparents, parents with many young children, and families with chronically ill or disabled persons.\n\n2.\n\nTargeting the Poor\n\n105.\nThe  Project  aims  to  help  overcome  the  gap  in  RH  services  for  the  poor  by  improving\naccess to quality RH services in the least developed districts. Using a participatory approach, 34\nrural  districts  were  selected  on  the  basis  of  social  ranking  (districts  in  the  bottom  and  third\nquartiles in terms of socioeconomic development), low ratio of female FHWs, and availability of\nexternal assistance.36 In addition, the Project will target the poor: (i) focusing on providing basic\nservices  where  the  poor  are  more  likely  to  capture  the  benefits  of  Government  subsidies,  (ii)\nselectively  investing  in  services  that  directly  support  RH;  (iii) addressing  RH  conditions  that\ndisproportionately  affect  the  poor;  and  (iv) identifying,  setting  targets,  and  monitoring  the\nProject\u2019s  impact  on  the  very  poor  through  local  committees  and  surveys.  It  is  expected  that\nmore than 50 percent of the project beneficiaries will be poor (see Appendix 11).\n\n3.\n\nDemand for RH Services \n\n106. Despite an increasing awareness about health and health services, a significant number\nof these women either do not get health care or seek traditional means of health care. About 50\npercent of the women, most of them living in small villages, do not have access to basic health\nservices such as a LHW providing education, FP, and basic medical care. Many couples want to\nuse modern contraceptives, but find services unavailable within their vicinity. While poverty can\nincrease  the  vulnerability  to  RH  risks,  ignorance  and  misconceptions  about  RH-related  issues\noften  aggravate  existing  problems.  Delay  in  using  health  services  is  often  caused  by  lack  of\nawareness about women\u2019s health needs and risks. These attitudes of the husband and family\ntowards pregnancy, emergencies and hospitals often cause delays. Restrictions on the mobility\nof women due to purdah (seclusion) are based on sociocultural and religious traditions. In more\nrural  areas,  lack  of  motorized  transport  is  a  major  problem.  Concerns  about  the  costs  and\nopportunity costs of health services are also an important factor.\n\nC.\n\nBenefits\n\n107.\nThe  Project  will  target  the  poor  and  underserved  populations  in  both  rural  and  urban\nareas nationwide. The targeted districts are most of Pakistan\u2019s poorest districts from the bottom\nand third quartiles with the poorest socioeconomic indicators and a majority of poor people.  The\nProject  will  cover  42  million  people,  including  7.7  million  women  of  reproductive  age  and  one\nmillion infants.\n\n108.\nThe target groups, particularly women and infants, will benefit from increased awareness\nabout  RH  issues  and  better  medical  care  at  home  (through  well-trained  LHWs),  at  the  health\nfacilities,  and  at  the  hospitals  (through  24-hour  EmOC).  Contraceptive  prevalence  will  rise,\nfertility levels will fall, and both maternal and infant morbidity and mortality rates will decline. The\nprevalence  of  anemia  and  incidence  of  STDs  will  decrease.  The  Project  will  directly  benefit\nabout one third of the population in the targeted districts; reduce the burden of disease for poor\nwomen  and  infants  by  10-30  percent  depending  on  the  type  of  intervention;  prevent  11,000\n\n                  \n\n36  Ghaus,  A  and  H.

The better health\nand  productivity  of  women  will  contribute  to  women  empowerment,  and  educational,  financial\nand  social  benefits.  This  will  lead  to  better  health  care  for  children  and  greater  incentives  for\ngirls'  education.  The  Project  will  improve  gender  sensitivity  of  health  staff  to  female  staff  and\npatients, and of the general public to female staff.\n\n110.\nThe  Project  will  provide  employment  to  4,400  LHWs  and  1,200  male  VBFPWs;  pre-\nservice  training  to  2,000  midwives,  and  in-service  training  to  all  health  staff  and  community\nworkers in the targeted districts.\n\n111. Complementary  to  the  Women\u2019s  Health  Project,  the  Project  will  accelerate  the\nintegration  of  MOH  and  MOPW,  and  introduce  RH  services  operating  within  the  framework  of\nthe  devolution  plan  to  strengthen  the  district  health  system.  The  Project  supports  capacity\nbuilding in the targeted districts under the devolved set up. It will aim to strengthen management\nstructures  at  the  district  level;  and  strengthen  coordinating,  monitoring,  and  supply  systems  at\nprovincial levels. The Project\u2019s interventions will bring radical changes in pre-service training of\nFHWs  and  paramedics.  It  will  upgrade  training  capacity  in  district  and  subdistrict  hospitals,\nmidwifery  and  public  health  schools,  regional  and  population  welfare  training  institutes,  and\nmedical colleges.\n\nThe Project is highly cost-effective. The improved health status and fertility reduction of\n112.\nthe  target  population  will  increase  economic  productivity  and  contribute  to  poverty  reduction.\nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  improving  equity  by  reducing  gender,  income,  rural-urban,  and\ninterdistrict imbalances.\n\n113.\nThe  Project  will  have  a  beneficial  environmental  impact  through  its  contribution  to\nreducing  rural  population  growth.  Health  education  on  sanitation  and  waste  disposal  is  also\nexpected to improve living conditions, reduce pests, and contain the spread of diseases.\n\nD.\n\nRisks\n\n114. Pakistan\u2019s social sector spending has been adversely affected by slow economic growth,\nlow revenue collection, and declining external assistance. The persistent drought in Balochistan\nand  Sindh  has  seriously  affected  the  living  conditions  of  the  poor.  A  sharp  drop  in  foreign\ninvestment followed the terrorist attack on 11 September 2001. The Government and provinces\nare  facing  an  acute  fiscal  crisis  for  a  combination  of  reasons,  including  the  decline  in\ninvestments  and  exports,  drought,  refugees,  and  a  shortfall  in  revenues.  Encouraged  by  aid\nagencies, the Government, however, is determined to give high priority to the social sector.\n\n115. While the Government is not planning to expand the network of facilities, it is currently\nnot spending enough to adequately operate the network and finance better services. Improving\nthe  quality  of  care  will  result  in  higher  recurrent  costs  as  it  will  increase  utilization  rates,  and\nincrease  unit  cost  per  patient  for  quality  inputs.  The  Government's  exposure  to  health  sector\nspending is very modest at about 0.8 percent of gross domestic product. The Government will\nhave  to  increase  this  percentage  in  the  years  ahead,  or  reduce  the  network  of  services  and\nstaff.  An  analysis  of  the  counterpart  fund  requirements  suggests  that  the  recurrent  cost\nimplications  of  the  Project  are  as  low  as  2  percent  of  sector  spending,  mainly  for  new  FHWs.\n\n\f29\n\nThe Government is also working on improving efficiency, e.g., through devolution and hospital\nautonomy. ADB is providing advisory technical assistance to develop a master plan for health\nsector  reform  in  NWFP.37  As  the  provincial  governments  are  facing  a  tight  fiscal  situation,  the\nprovincial contributions have been kept low, and the federal government will continue financing\nthe federal PWP and NPFP.\n\n116. Pakistan  is  in  a  major  social  and  governance  transition.  Devolution  of  powers  to  the\ndistrict,  which  requires  new  administrative  procedures,  took  place  in  August  2001.  Under  the\ndevolved  structure,  the  district  government  initially  may  not  give  high  priority  to  RH.  Religious\ngroups may object to promoting RH interventions like FP and education of adolescents, unless\nthe  interventions  fully  recognize  and  respect  local  sociocultural  and  religious  values.  The\nGovernment  has  made  a  commitment  to  protect  social  sector  spending,  and  provide  districts\nwith targeted funds for RH. The design of the Project provides powerful incentives to bring RH\ninto the mainstream of district health activities, such as media campaigns, support for the district\nplanning  process,  and  a  substantial  district  budget  for  RH  activities.  The  Project  will  help\nincrease  district  management  capacity,  provide  service  standards,  and  monitor  district\nperformance.\n\n117. Sector changes may also affect project implementation. The Government has postponed\nthe  merger  of  MOPW  and  MOH  into  one  Ministry  of  Health  and  Population  Welfare  and  has\nplaced this proposal under a review committee. Progress is being made at the provincial level,\nas  MOPW  has  started  transferring  its field staff to the provincial administration. The Project is\nplaced  within  the  RH  directorates,  to  ensure  mainstreaming  and  sustainability  of  the  project\nactivities.  The  impact  of  training  is  often  diluted  due  to  frequent  transfer  of  staff,  but  this  is\ncountered by training all staff in the targeted districts, as the staff are usually rotated within the\ndistrict. Staff performance has been affected due to limited career opportunities and incentives,\nand  because  working  in  rural  areas  is  socially  and  financially  less  attractive  to  staff.\nImprovement in governance and devolution are expected to improve staff performance.\n\n118. Contracting  of  NGOs  by  the  Government  has  been  slow.  The  Project  provides  for  a\ncoordinating  NGO to  help  administer the contracting of NGOs. Most NGOs working in the RH\nsector  require  capacity  building  in  planning,  management,  and  accounting  if  working  with  the\nGovernment  and  ADB.  Capacity  building  is  being  provided  through  SAPPII  and  projects  of\nseveral aid agencies and international NGOs.

Pakistan's population has increased fourfold since independence in 1947.\nMales  have  outnumbered  females  in  all  censuses,  however,  a  slow  but  constant  change  has\nbeen noted, from 117 males per 100 females in 1951 to 108 males per 100 females in 1998. A\nsteady fall in mortality since the 1950s has led to substantial improvement in life expectancy at\nbirth, especially for females, with an increase from 48.7 to 64.6 years between 1962-1965 and\n1996, compared to males from 52.4 to 63.9 over the same period. The average age at first time\nmarriage increased from 17 years in 1951 to 22 years in 1997 for females, and from 22 years in\n1951 to 26.5 years in 1997 for males.1\n\nFertility. The  change in Pakistan\u2019s fertility  has remained slow in earlier decades as the\n2.\ntotal  fertility  rate  remained  above  six  births  per  woman  for  almost  three  decades.  However,  a\ndeclining trend has become evident, especially over the last decade. The estimates indicate that\nthe  total  fertility  rate  at  present  is  4.8  compared  with  7.1  in  1965-1969  (in  Bangladesh,  total\nfertility rate is currently 3.7). The observed decline in fertility rate is closely related to changes in\nthe desired and ideal family size. Available data shows a systemic decline in the perceived ideal\nfamily size from 4.9 children in 1984-1985 to 3.6 in 1994-1995. A preference for a son partially\naccounts for the current average of 4.2 children per married woman.\n\n3.\nInfant Mortality. Infant mortality rate fell from 137 to 89 deaths per 1,000 live births in\nthe  first  year  of  life  in  1960-1999.  Currently,  about  400,000  infants  die  each  year  in  Pakistan.\nAbout 59 percent of deaths occur in the first month.2 Largely preventable causes of infant death\nin  the  first  month  are  prematurity,  growth  retardation,  low  birth  weight,  asphyxia,  birth  injuries,\nand infections of the newborn including neonatal tetanus. About 25 percent  of infants are born\nwith low birth weight, due mainly to maternal malnutrition. In the remaining 11 months, poor care\nof acute respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases remain the major causes of death.\n\n4.\nMaternal Mortality. The maternal mortality ratio was 340 per 100,000 live births in 1994,\nand  varied  from  286  per  100,000  live  births  in  the  squatter  settlements  of  Karachi  to  630  per\n100,000  live  births  in  Balochistan,  a  province  with  a  high  proportion  of  small  and  isolated\nvillages at great distance from health services.3 The maternal mortality ratio is not expected to\nhave  changed  much  since  then.  Women  at  increased  risk  of  maternal  mortality  and  morbidity\nare  young  and  first-time  mothers,  mothers  with  five  or  more  deliveries,  and  those  with  poor\npregnancy  history.  Other  medical  risk  factors  are  malnutrition  and  smoking.  Social  risk  factors\nare illiteracy, poverty, induced abortion, and violence against women associated with about 14\npercent  of  maternal  deaths.  However,  all  pregnant  women  are  at  risk  from  complications  in\npregnancy,  childbirth,  and  postnatal  period  such  as  bleeding,  hypertension,  obstructed  labor,\nand sepsis.\n\n5.\nMaternal  Disability.  Most  maternal  mortality  is  avoidable  and  results  from  delay  in\nappropriate care\u2014delays in decision making for referral, transportation to appropriate facilities,\nand  treatment  at  the  facility.  Most  maternal  complications  can  be  managed  with  routine\nprocedures at primary or first referral level, which explains the extremely low maternal mortality\nratio  in  developed  countries.  Poor  management  of  maternal  complications  contributes  to  the\n\n                  \n\n1 National  Institute  for  Population  Studies  (NIPS).  1997.

One  third  of  adult  women  in  rural  communities  have  permanent\ndisabilities including prolapse  incontinence, fistula, and chronic infections.\n\n6.\nAbortion.  Abortion  is  a  highly  underestimated  problem  in  Pakistan.  A  hospital-based\nstudy  found  that  11  percent  of  maternal  deaths  were  due  to  abortion.  While  wealthy  women\nhave access to professional assistance for illegal abortion services, poor women invariably seek\nthe  assistance  of  traditional  birth  attendants  (TBAs).  These  untrained  women  often  employ\ndangerous techniques resulting in often fatal complications such as bleeding, uterus perforation,\nand sepsis.\n\nMaternal  Malnutrition.  Anemia  is  common,  affecting  about  one  third  of  the  women.4\n7.\nIodine deficiency affects up to half of women in rural communities causing mental impairment in\ntheir offspring.\n\n 8.\nReproductive Tract Infection (RTI). The prevalence of RTI in both sexes is not known,\nbut is estimated to be high. Women are at a higher risk from RTI and its complications, including\npelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, tubo-ovarian abscesses, and ectopic pregnancies.  In the\nproject  preparatory  field  study  in  four  provinces,  48  percent  of  214  women  reported  suffering\nfrom symptoms related to RTI.\n\nAcquired  Immunodeficiency  Syndrome  (AIDS).  Since  the  initiation  of  laboratory\n9.\ndetection  in  1986,  only  1487  human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV)-positive  cases  have  been\nreported to the National AIDS Program. The number is expected to be much higher because of\nseveral  risk  factors  including  HIV-positive  professional  blood  donors,  prostitutes  not  using\ncondoms,  sharing  of  needles  among  drug  users,  and  migrant  workers  returning  from  abroad.5\nAccording to the World Health Organization, HIV prevalence is about 0.06 percent or there are\nsome 80,000 HIV positive cases at present. With inadequate control efforts, about 2-5 percent\nof the population may be HIV positive by 2015.\n\n10.\nCancers.    Hospital-based  data  shows  that  breast  and  cervical  cancers  are  common\namong women in Pakistan. Population-based data are lacking. Surgery for these conditions is\nonly  available  for  those  who  can  gain  access  to  the  larger  hospitals.  Chemotherapy  is  not\naffordable to most. Screening services are expanding slowly.\n\n11.\nRH Issues for Adolescents.  No national studies are available on the indicators related\nto adolescents\u2019 RH. According to a qualitative study of 177 girls and 133 boys in four cities, an\noverwhelming  majority  of  girls  and  boys  mentioned  that  they  had  heard  and  discussed  RH\nissues  related  to menstruation, sexual intercourse, pregnancy, and contraceptive methods.6  In\ngeneral, the main source of information for adolescents is their peer group, which often provided\nill-perceived and incorrect information.\n\n12.\nAntenatal  and  Delivery  Care.  Currently,  there  are  29  million  women  of  reproductive\nage, and over 5 million become pregnant each year. In 1996-1997, 36 percent of females who\nhad given birth in the last three years had prenatal consultation during their last pregnancy. The\nattendance rate was 76 percent in major urban areas compared with 22 percent in rural areas\n(footnote 1). In 1998, 31 percent of pregnant women had received two or more doses of tetanus\n\n                  \n\n4 National Health Survey of Pakistan. 1994.\n5 Social Marketing Pakistan. 1999.

However,  with  the\nincrease  in  availability  of  female  staff,  a  noticeable  improvement  in  the  utilization  of  maternal\ncare and FP services has been recorded (Table A2.1.).\n\nTable A2.1: Trends in Antenatal Care, FP, and Immunization, 1993-1999\nPercent\nTotal\nfacilities\nIncrease\n105\n      100\n      100\n      100\n      100\n\nServices\nPrenatal care visits\nFP total visits\nFP new clients visits\nIntrauterine device inserted\nContraceptive injections\nTetanus toxoid vaccinations\n(second dose or more)\n\n1993\n11,682\n    4,796\n    2,676\n       891\n       969\n29,942\n\n1998\n  21,583\n8,473\n4,916\n1,674\n2,786\n35,134\n\n84\n77\n84\n88\n188\n17\n\n        FP= family planning, IUD= intrauterine device.\n\n13.\nFamily Planning. Although the contraceptive prevalence rate in Pakistan is lower than\nin many developing nations, it has increased in the last decade, reaching 28 percent in 2000-\n2001  from  12  percent  in  1990-1991.  The  rise  is  conspicuous  in  rural  areas  from  5  percent  in\n1991  to  18.6  percent  in  1996-1997.  Knowledge  of  contraceptive  methods  has  reached  most\nmarried  couples,  resulting  in  an  increasing  demand  for  FP.  Unmet  demand  for  contraception\nhas risen from 28 percent in 1990-1991 to 38 percent in 1996-1997.\n\nMen\u2019s  Role  in  RH.  Men's  role  in  FP  is  limited.  The  use  of  condoms  accounts  for  18\n14.\npercent of the total use of contraceptives. The number of vasectomies performed is negligible.\nKnowledge and use of traditional methods is also limited.8 Men usually attend private clinics for\nRH problems including sexually transmitted diseases. Men's knowledge of RH needs of women,\nincluding timely provision of emergency obstetric care, is limited.\n\n15.\nAdolescents RH. Adolescents have very limited sources of information about RH, and\nmainly  obtain  inappropriate  information  from  peers.  However,  an  increasing  interest  in\nadolescent RH education from different parts of civil society has been noticed, and education in\nthis field is increasingly acceptable.\n\nRural sector performance.  The RH status and use of health and FP services in rural\n\n16.\nareas is lower than in urban areas.

In this period, infrastructure\n1.\nand  human  resources  for  the  health  and  population  welfare  services  expanded  in  both  public\nand  private  sectors.  The  Government  operates  an  extensive  network  of  health  and  population\nwelfare facilities through the Ministry of Health and its departments, the Ministry of Population\nWelfare  and  its  departments,  and  municipal  and  local  governments.  Health  services  are  also\nprovided  by  autonomous  public  institutions,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  private\nhospitals  and  clinics,  drug  shops,  informal  providers  including  quacks,  and  traditional  healers\nand birth attendants. Table A3.1 illustrates the development of infrastructure in the health and\npopulation  welfare  sector.  Formal  private  sector  spending  has  increased  rapidly,  and  is  now\nabout 3 times public spending.\n\nSector\nHealth/local\ngovernment\nHealth\n\nTable A3.1: Growth in Physical Infrastructure in the Health Sector Since 1947\n2000\n4,793\n\nInfrastructure\nDispensaries\n\n1947\n2,000\n\nHospitals\nRural health centers\nBasic health units\nMaternal and child health centers\nReproductive health services centers\nFamily welfare centers\nMobile support units\na Figure includes hospitals in both East and West Pakistan.\nSource: Ministry of Planning and Development, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Population Welfare.\n\n453a\n0\n0\n140\n0\n0\n0\n\nPopulation\nwelfare\n\n918\n559\n4,718\n935\n266\n1,688\n131\n\n2.\nHuman  resources  in  the  health  and  population  sectors  are  not  balanced.  Table  A3.2\nillustrates  that  there  is  a  serious  mismatch  between  doctors,  nurses,  and  paramedics.  While\nthere are as many female as male medical graduates, few female doctors work in rural areas.\n\nTable A3.2: Growth in Human Resources in the Health Sector Since 1947\n\nSector\nPublic and\nprivate\nsector\nHealth\n\nPopulation\nwelfare\n\nHuman Resources\nDoctors\nNurses\nTrained traditional birth attendants\nLady health visitors\nLady health workers\nFamily welfare workers\nVillage-based FP workers( female)\nVillage-based FP workers(male)\n\n1947\n6,000\n1,600\n1,100\n200\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n2000\n91,308\n24,776\n58,000\n4,407\n43,000\n4,000\n12,072\n1,052\n\nSource: Ministry of Planning and Development, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Population Welfare.\n\nB.\n\nMinistry of Population Welfare and Population Welfare Departments\n\nThe  Ministry  of  Population  Welfare  (MOPW)  is  responsible  for  population  welfare  in\n3.\nterms  of  policy  formulation,  planning,  coordination,  and  monitoring;  managing  the  population\nwelfare program (PWP) through provincial population welfare departments (PPWDs) headed by\nsecretaries  in  the  provinces;  information,  education  and  communication  (IEC)  activities;  and\n\n\f41\n\nAppendix 3, page 2\n\nmanaging  population  welfare  services  through  NGOs,  autonomous  institutions,  and  the\nprograms in federal areas. The PWP is still a vertical program. However, federal staff of MOPW\nworking \nthe  provincial\nadministration.\n\nthe  PPWDs  are  being \n\nthe  provinces  under \n\ntransferred \n\nto \n\nin \n\n4.\nMOPW  operates  a  service  delivery  system  that  includes  1,688  family  welfare  centers,\n266  reproductive  health  services  centers  types  A  and  B,  131  mobile  service  units,  and  1,052\nmale village-based family planning workers (VBFPWs). The 12,072 female VBFPWs have been\ntransferred to the Ministry of Health (MOH). Each family welfare center covers a population of\n5,000-7,000, and is managed by a female paramedic with support staff offering family planning\n(FP) counseling, nonsurgical contraceptives, and maternal and child health (MCH) services. The\n105 type A RHSCs are separate units in the compound of public hospitals with a female doctor,\na  staff  nurse,  two  family  welfare  workers,  a  family  welfare  assistant,  technical  assistants,  and\nadministrative  staff.  The  161  type  B  RHSCs  are  designated  public,  NGO,  or  private  hospitals\nthat provide surgical contraceptive services, and other family planning(FP) and MCH services.\nMobile  service  units  provide  family  welfare  center  type  services  in  remote  areas.  The  male\nVBFPWs  register  eligible  couples,  and  target  husbands  for  changing  RH  behavior  and  accept\nFP methods. Each is expected to reach males in 12-15 villages. MOPW also works with large\nautonomous  public  sector  industries  referred  to  as  target  group  institutions.  MOPW  has\nestablished  12  regional  training  institutes  for  clinical  training,  and  three  population  welfare\ntraining institutes providing nonclinical training. Except for from the training institutions, it is likely\nthat these services will be handed over to the district government.\n\nC.\n\nMinistry of Health and Provincial Health Departments\n\n5.\nMOH is responsible for the health sector in terms of national policy formulation, planning,\ncoordination  and  monitoring;  federal  institutions  and  hospitals,  and  execution  of  vertical\nprograms like the National FP and Primary Health Care Program (NPFP), Expanded Program of\nImmunization  (EPI);  and  control  programs  of  priority  infectious  diseases  like  tuberculosis,\nmalaria,  and  acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome  (AIDS).  Under  NPFP,  community-based\nservices  are  provided  by  43,000  lady  health  workers  and  12,072  female  VBFPWs  transferred\nfrom MOPW, and combined as family health worker (FHW). Female FHWs maintain registration\nof  births  and  deaths  in  the  catchment  population,  conduct  home  visits  for  counseling,  and\nprovide basic medical and FP services. This vertical program is managed through provincial and\ndistrict coordinators.\n\nUnlike PPWDs, the provincial health departments (PHDs) are fully established provincial\n6.\ndepartments  responsible  for  formulating  provincial  health  policy,  planning,  and  monitoring;\nmanaging  teaching  hospitals,  schools,  and  special  institutions;  and  supporting  district\ngovernments with health services. The provincial secretary health heads the PHD. The director\ngeneral  of  the  PHD  is  responsible  for  implementing  preventive  and  curative  services  through\ndirectorates headed by program directors, including the reproductive health (RH) directorate.\n\n7.\nWith  FHWs  at  community  level,  PHDs  provide  services  through  primary  care  facilities,\ndistrict  and  subdistrict  hospitals,  and  tertiary  care  facilities.  Primary  care  facilities  include  935\nMCH, 4,718 basic health units (BHUs), and 599 rural health centers (RHCs). MCH centers are\nusually  in  urban  areas  and  managed  by  lady  health  visitors  (LHVs)  providing  basic  maternal\ncare  and  treatment  of  minor  ailments  for  women  and  children.  Each  union  council  of  10,000-\n20,000  people  has  at  least  a  basic  health  unit,  providing  primary  curative,  MCH,  FP,  and\npreventive services; and staffed by 10 people including a medical officer-in-charge, lady health\nvisitors,  an  unqualified  midwife,  and  a  vaccinator.  Reproductive  health  centers  provide\noutpatient  services  and  some  in-patient  services  for  a  catchment  population  of  about  50,000-\n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 3, page 3\n\n100,000 people, with approximately 30 staff including a female medical officer. A typical district\nhas  a  district  hospital  and  about  5-10  subdistrict  hospitals.  The  latter  serve  a  catchment\npopulation  of  about  100,000-300,000  people,  have  50-100  beds  and  diagnostic  and  surgical\nfacilities. District hospitals serve catchment population of about 1 milliion-2 million people, have\nabout 100-400 beds and at least eight specialist positions. However, many of these hospitals do\nnot  provide  surgical  services  for  lack  of  a  surgeon  and  anesthetist,  or  do  not  provide  these\nservices  at  night.  This  has  a  major  impact  on  maternal  mortality.  There  are  29  teaching\nhospitals at tertiary level.\n\nD.\n\nDistrict Health Group\n\n8.\nUnder  the  newly  devolved  structure,  program  implementation  at  district  level  will  be\nunder  the  district  executive  officer  for  health.  Upon  promulgation  of  the  ordinance,  the\nadministrative and financial authority for the management of the offices will be decentralized to\nthe district government. The health and population welfare offices have been grouped under the\ndistrict health group.2 The composition of the district health group as given in the ordinance is as\nfollows: public health, basic and rural health, children and women's health, population welfare,\nand district and subdistrict hospitals. This implies that most of the above mentioned services will\nbe devolved to the district governments. The district health group will be headed by the district\nexecutive  officer  for  health,  who  will  be  responsible  for  administration,  discipline,  and  proper\nconduct  of  business  assigned  to  the  offices.  The  district  health  group  will  be  responsible  for\ndistrict  planning,  general  management  of  services,  personnel  management, \nfinancial\nmanagement,  participation  of  communities,  integrated  service  delivery,  and  monitoring.  The\ndistrict  government  will  determine  to  what  extent  family  planning  and  reproductive  health\nservices should be given priority in the district in terms of public spending.\n\nE.\n\nPublic Sector Institutions\n\n9.\nThere  are  14  major  public  sector  organizations  including  the  Pakistan  Armed  Forces,\nPakistan  Railways,  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority,  Fauji  Foundation  and  Pakistan\nInternational Airlines, employing a workforce of more than one million people. These institutions\nmaintain  their  own  health  infrastructure  of  hospitals,  dispensaries,  and  MCH  centers  for  their\nemployees and their families. A total of 118 gynecologists, 51 medical officers, 132 paramedics,\nand  14  motivators  of  the  health  outlets  provide  these  services.  MOPW  has  designated  these\norganizations  as  target  group  institutions,  and  supports  FP  services  through  the  450  health\noutlets of these institutions.\n\nF.\n\nNational Trust for Population Welfare\n\nThe  National  Trust  for  Population  Welfare  is  an  autonomous  umbrella  organization,\n10.\nestablished  in  1994  under  the  Charitable  Endowment  Act  1890.  It  replaced  the  NGO\nCoordinating  Committee,  which  was  a  government  organization  established  to  involve  the\nNGOs  in  population  activities.  The  Government  provided  an  endowment  of  Rs104  million  to\nNational  Trust  for  Population  Welfare,  and  authorized  it  to  administer  and  receive  funds  from\nwithin  Pakistan  and  external  donors.1  The  main  objective  was  to  support,  strengthen,  and\nincrease  the  contribution  of  NGOs,  private  voluntary  organizations,  and  community-based\nadministrative  units  working  for  population  welfare,  and  serve  as  a  forum  to  provide  grants  to\n\n                  \n\n1 NATPOW. 1994. The Scheme of Administration for NATPOW.\n2   As the District Health Group is not yet in place, the Project uses the term District Health Population (DHPT).\n\n\f43\n\nAppendix 3, page 4\n\nbeneficiaries.  The  National  Trust  for  Population  Welfare  has  one  head  office  and  eight  field\noffices. Many smaller NGOs, representing about 70 percent of the districts, have registered with\nNational Trust for Population Welfare. These NGOs have submitted their own proposal for RH\nservice delivery to the National Trust for Population Welfare.\n\nG.\n\nNongovernment Organizations\n\nNGOs \n\n11.\ninclude  nonprofit  organizations  providing  charitable  services,  undertaking\ndevelopment  work,  conducting  advocacy,  or  engaging  in  relief  work.  Of  the  more  than  16,000\nNGOs,  the  majority  are  community-based  organizations,  usually  for  a  single  community\nengaged in multiple sectors. About 25 percent are midlevel NGOs working at the city or district\nlevel. About 5 percent are umbrella NGOs that work at provincial or national level, and are often\nengaged in funding and building capacity of smaller NGOs and community-based organizations.\nMany  mid-level  and  umbrella  NGOs  have  substantial  experience  in  RH  activities,  providing\nadvocacy for women\u2019s status and rights, community mobilization, human resource development,\nhealth education and communication, preventive and curative RH services, involvement of men\nas  partners  in  RH,  adolescent  health  and  social  marketing.    The  cost  of  NGO  outlets  is  not\nmuch higher than public sector facilities, as the latter often lacks medicines and contraceptives,\nand patients are referred to the private drug shops to procure these. There is substantial scope\nto supplement government's efforts in RH through NGOs. During project preparation, about 50\nNGOs submitted proposals for expansion of RH, including for social marketing of contraceptives\nand  delivery  kits.  The  Government  aims  to  strengthen  the  role  of  NGOs  in  the  sector,  and\nassists  NGOs  through  loans,  grants,  and  direct  funding  of  activities  like  social  marketing.\nHowever,  both  the  Government  and  NGOs  also  have  their  reservations  about  public-private\npartnership, and the public funding mechanisms for NGOs have been cumbersome.\n\nH.\n\nFor-Profit Private Sector\n\nThe for-profit private health sector has been expanding rapidly. Household expenditure\n12.\nfor  privately  provided  services  is  about  three  times  public  health  expenditure.  However,  the\nimpact  of  these  curative  services  is  limited  due  to  poor  quality,  and  negligence  of  disease\nprevention and health promotion.\n\n13.\nQualified  registered  practitioners  include  specialists,  general  practitioners  and  private\nhospitals.  General  practitioners  are  graduates  with  hospital-based  undergraduate  training,  but\nusually  without  training  in  family  medicine.  General  practitioners  are  commonly  paid  for  the\nmedicines  dispensed  by  them,  and  not  for  the  consultation,  which  promotes  malpractice.\nContinuing  medical  education  programs  for  the  50,000  general  practitioners  are  organized  by\nprofessional  organizations  and  pharmaceutical  companies.  Traditional  healers  have  a  limited\nrole  in  RH,  but  are  popular  for  a  wide  range  of  RH  problems,  including  miscarriage,  infertility,\nand infections. Paramedics run clinics for minor illnesses and routine maternal care. However,\nthey  also  treat  many  RH  problems  for  which  they  have  not  been  trained.  Unqualified  and\nuntrained drug shop keepers, quacks and traditional birth attendants provide health services for\nthe rural poor. These individuals have often worked in clinics and chemist shops as assistants,\nand by their exposure have gained some basic information about symptomatic treatments and\nmedicines. They indulge in dispensing a wide variety of medicines for a number of symptoms to\nilliterate ignorant clients. Untrained traditional birth attendants conduct 40 percent of deliveries,\nand often cause harm due to the use of force and drugs, and poor hygiene. Sexual health clinics\nfor  men  also  exist  throughout  the  country,  providing  immediately  acting  but  harmful  pills  for\nmagical effects, especially on impotence.\n\n\f                                                                           44\n\nAppendix 4, page1\n\nGOVERNMENT POLICIES AND PLANS FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH\n\n1.\nSince independence, the Government has undertaken maternal and child health (MCH)\nand  family  planning  (FP)  programs  to  address  high  maternal  and  infant  mortality.  These\nMCH/FP programs passed through distinct phases under successive five-year plans (Table A4).\nThe  Government  moved  from  separate  MCH  and  FP  services  to  a  more  comprehensive\nreproductive  health  (RH)  approach  including  target  groups  other  than  women  of  reproductive\nage,  in  response  to  the  International  Conference  on  Population  and  Development  Plan  of\nAction,  1994.  Recently,  the  Government  developed  comprehensive  poverty,  population  and\nhealth policies to improve health and population indicators.\n\n2.\nThe  Ministry  of  Population  Welfare  (MOPW)  and  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  jointly\ndeveloped  the  RH  services  package1  for  implementing  standardized  RH  services  from  all\nMOPW  and  MOH  outlets.

systemized information on the qualitative and quantitative performance of the project\ncomponents;  (ii)  ensure  that  problems  and  opportunities  are  identified,  analyzed,  shared,  and\nresponded  to  in  a  timely  manner;  and  (iii)  make  the  project  impact  known  one  year  after\ncompletion of the Project. The system will be tracking selected input, process, output, coverage,\nand impact indicators.1\n\n2.\nUnder  the  devolution  plan,  each  district  is  expected  to  carry  out  its  baseline  health\nsurvey  to  assess  the  coverage  and  impact  of  health  services.  This  project  will  support  a\nbaseline survey in year 2 in all the targeted districts, with a follow-up survey in year 6. Existing\nsurvey  instruments  developed  under  the  Women's  Health  Project  have  been  adjusted  for  this\npurpose.  For  monitoring,  existing  management  information  systems  for  the  health  and\npopulation welfare sectors will be used. The reports of the project coordination unit (PCU) will\nbe used to track project inputs and activities.\n\n3.\nComponent 1. Inputs and processes will be reported through the reports of PCUs. The\nquality  of  services  and  skills  of  providers  will  be  monitored  using  supervisory  checklists  and\nhealth  services  surveys.  Utilization  of  services,  as  an  indicator  of  client  satisfaction,  will  be\nmonitored through existing management information systems.\n\n4.\nComponent  2.  The  inputs  and  activities  for  improving  access  to  reproductive  health\nservices  will  be  monitored  through  PCU  reports.    Output  will  be  monitored  through  existing\nmanagement information systems that will be improved. District household surveys will provide\ncoverage  and  impact  indicators.  Similar  indicators  will  be  used  as  those  used  for  the  national\nsurveys, so that performance of the project districts and provinces can be compared.\n\n5.\nComponent  3.    Improved  awareness  and  change  in  behavior  of  the  target  groups\nrequires  special  evaluation  studies  to  determine  impact.  The  federal  health  education  and\ncommunication unit will submit monthly reports to monitor input, process, and output indicators.\n\n6.\nComponents 4 and 5. The human resource development and institutional strengthening\nwill be monitored by PCUs using input, process, and output indicators. Impact will be assessed\nthrough special evaluation studies.\n\n7. \nComponent 6. Support to nongovernment organizations (NGOs) will be monitored with\nthe help of coordinating NGOs, in case these have been contracted to administer implementing\nNGOs. Private sector training will be monitored through PCU reports.\n\n                  \n\n1 Input  includes  hardware  and  software,  including  policies  and  guidelines.  The  process  refers  to  the  quality  and\nquantity  of  activities  performed.  Output  refers  to  the  product  of  health  care  delivery  as  measured  at  the  point  of\nservice provision and includes utilization and patient satisfaction. Coverage refers to the proportion of a population\nthat  used  particular  services.  refers  to  the  proportion  of  a  population  that  has  achieved  a  certain  health  status\nbelieved to be associated with the interventions.\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nTable A10: Indicators, Baseline Values and Targets for 34 Districts\n\nIndicator\n\nPakistan\nIndicators\nLatest\nEstimates\n\nTarget\nDistricts\nBaseline\nEstimates\n\nTarget\n(percent)\n\nSource\n\nImpact\nCrude Birth Rate/1,000 people\nTotal fertility rate\nMaternal mortality ratio/100,000 live births\nInfant mortality rate rural\nInfant mortality rate rural poor girls\n\nCoverage\nContraceptive prevalence rate\nWomen using LHWs in past year (%)\nRural pregnant women receiving prenatal care (%)\nRural pregnant women who received two or more\ntetanus toxoid doses in the last pregnancy\nRural deliveries conducted by skilled birth\nattendants (%)\nRural children delivered in institutions (%)\n\nOutput\nFemale outpatient visits/month as percentage of\ntotal female population\n\nDeliveries through caesarian section as\npercentage of total expected deliveries per month\nin catchment area (public and private)\n\nProcess\nLHWs trained/year (preservice)\nMale VBFPWs trained/year (preservice)\nMidwives trained/year\nSurgical Services started/year\n\n35\n4.8\n       340-600\n95\n110\n\n45\n5.5\n600\n112\n145\n\n40 (10)\n5.0 (10)\n350 (30)\n90 (20)\n110 (25)\n\n    Survey\n    Survey\n    Survey\n    Survey\n    Survey\n\n28\n30\n22\n23\n\n12\n\n18\n\nna\n\nna\n\n22 (50)\n30 (100)\n22 (50)\n20 (100)\n\nSurvey\nSurvey\nSurvey\nSurvey\n\n10 (100)\n\nSurvey\n\n20 (100)\n\nSurvey\n\n4 (100)\n\nHealth\nmanagement\ninformation\nsystem\nSurvey\n\n<5\n\n10 (100)\n\n900\n250\n400\n6\n\nNPFP\nMOPW\nMOH\nPHD\n\n15\n15\n15\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n<2\n\n0\n0\n0\n40\n\nFP= family planning, NPFP= National Program for Family Planning and Primary Health Care, LHW= lady health\nworker, MOH = Ministry of Health, MOPW = Ministry of Population Welfare, PHC= primary health care,\nPHD=Provincial Health Department,VBFPW = village based family planning worker.\n.\nSources: Government of Pakistan, Social Action Program Multidonor-Support Unit.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 11, page 1\n\nSOCIAL ASSESSMENT AND ACTION MATRIX\n\nA.\n\nVulnerable Groups\n\n1.\n\nThe Poor\n\nliteracy \n\nindex,  and  poverty  and \n\nPakistan's  human  development \n\nindicators  are\n1.\ncomparable  with  those  of  Bangladesh  and  India.  Sri  Lanka  has  a  high  literacy  level,  but  its\npoverty  level  is  similar  to  that  of  Pakistan  (Table  A11.1).  Based  on  calorie  intake,  Pakistan's\npoverty level was about 30 percent in 2000-01, compared with 20 percent in 1992-1993. More\nthan a third of poor households are headed by aged persons dependent on transfer incomes.\nUrban  poverty  is  common  in  households  with  a  large  number  of  children,  but  less  common  in\nhouseholds  with  female  heads.  Rural  poverty  is  slightly  more  common  in  households  with\nfemale heads and among unskilled laborers. Poverty is particularly high in Balochistan, southern\nSindh (Thatta, Badin, Tharparkar and Umarkot), southern Punjab (Siraiki belt), and in the tribal\nareas  of  North-West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP),  Kohistan,  Batgram  and  Dir.  Some  of  the\nreasons  for  high  poverty  levels  in  Balochistan  and  Sindh  include  feudal/tribal  land  ownership\npatterns and overall climate and soil conditions. The districts in Balochistan, except Quetta, are\nalso the most underdeveloped in terms of social status and services.\n\nTable A11.1: Regional Comparison of GDP, Poverty, and Literacy\n\nItem\nGNP per capita ($) 1998\n\nPakistan\n0.52\n\nBangladesh\n0.46\n\nIndia\n0.56\n\nSri Lanka\n\n0.73\n\nPopulation below income poverty\nline ($1/day per person), 1997/1998\nAdult literacy, female (%)\nAdult literacy, male (%)\n\n34\n\n29\n58\n\n36\n\n29\n51\n\n31\n\n44\n67\n\n35\n\n88\n94\n\nSource: Government of Pakistan. 2001.

Population subgroups resistant to\nFamily  Planning  (FP)  services  are  mostly  illiterate  and  belong  to  low-income  households  with\nstrong  adherence  to  traditional  and  social  values.  Such  groups  are  largely  concentrated  in\nnorthern  parts  of  NWFP,  southern  parts  of  Punjab,  most  of  Balochistan,  and  landless  poor\nfarmers in rural Sindh where the female status is low and their education is discouraged due to\nstrong Biradari and Sardari systems or tribal traditions.1 Seclusion norms are also observed in\nthe semi-irrigated regions where a great proportion of women observe purdah within the village\ncompared  with  those  in  peri-urban  and  relatively  more  developed  regions.2  Girls  marry  at  an\nearly  age,  especially  in  rural  areas.  Most  marriages  are  arranged  by  parents  or  elders  in  the\nfamily.  Many  young  women  and  adolescent  girls  begin  to  bear  children  at  a  very  young  age,\nwith great risk to themselves and often resulting in life-long disability.\n\n                  \n\n1 Mahmood,  N.  1999.

Despite this regional\nand cultural diversity, people in Pakistan are united by one common ideology, Islam, the religion\nof  95  percent  of  the  population.  Among  minorities,  the  Christians  and  Hindus  are  the  more\nprominent,  living  mainly  in,  respectively,  eastern  Punjab  and  eastern  Sindh.  Christians  are\ncommonly found in low-pay jobs such as housekeeping, and many Hindus are employed in the\ncarpet and textile industries. They are mobile and accept the use of health services, but being\npoor, often may not be able to afford such services. Strong social support systems and charity\nservices that are typical among the wealthier minority groups such as Ismaeli and Parsi are less\nevident.  The  project  will  aim  to  include  poor  minorities  by  selecting  family  health  workers\n(FHWs) from among them, and incorporate their particular needs, like translation and adaptation\nof education materials, in district health plans.\n\nB.\n\nNeeds and Demands\n\n1.\n\nPerceived Needs\n\nIn  traditional  rural  villages,  the  woman\u2019s  role  is  perceived  to  be  responsibility  for\n4.\ndomestic chores, labor near home, and preserving the honor and reputation of the family by not\nexposing herself to the outside world. From a young age onward, girls in traditional households\nare taught to provide, much less to receive. When they get married, they have internalized this\nrole  and  pass  it  on  to  their  daughters.  Women's  mobility  is  often  restricted,  and  women  have\nless access to adequate nutrition and health services. Many of the health and nutrition problems\nof  women  are  perceived  as  a  normal  part  of  life.  There  is  also  stigma  associated  with  certain\ndiseases.  Women  who  believe  that  they  may  be  suffering  from  a  reproductive  or  urinary  tract\ninfection  are  often  hesitant  to  discuss  the  problem  with  others  and  to  seek  appropriate\ntreatment.3  Because  of  these  constraints,  women  often  turn  to  traditional  healers  (hakims)  or\nspiritual leaders (pirs) within their village for cure for their RH problems.\n\n2.\n\nFamily Planning\n\n5.\nVarious  studies  have  documented  the  social  barriers  to  and  disincentives  in  the  use\ncontraception for limiting and spacing births4. The main reason is of course the desire to have\nmore  children.  Other  reasons  cited  by  rural  women  for  not  using  FP  and  health  services  are\nhusbands\u2019  disapproval,  lack  of  knowledge,  religious  and  fatalistic  attitudes,  and  fear  of  side\neffects (Table A11.2). Distance and travel costs to reach service outlets and religious values are\nother reasons commonly mentioned as a hindrance to the use of FP services.5\n\n                  \n\nAnalysis.

The project preparatory\ntechnical assistance field study showed that among poor rural women, a husband\u2019s opposition\nto  FP  use  and  desire  for  more  children  were  the  prominent  reasons  for  nonuse.  Among  adult\nmales, fears of negative stigma, and apprehensions about side effects came out as prominent\nreasons for nonuse of contraceptives. The majority of participants in the TA study thought that\ninvolving religious leaders and scholars in dispelling people\u2019s misconceptions about FP issues\nwould make a significant difference in people\u2019s attitudes and behavior.\n\n3.\n\nWomen's Reproductive Health (RH) Care\n\nDespite  a  substantial  change  in  attitudes,  a  significant  number  of  women  and  men  in\n7.\npoor rural communities seek traditional means of health care. The findings from a study in rural\nPunjab show that the majority of the respondents (65 percent) believed that traditional healers\n(hakim,  homeopaths,  and  spiritual  healer)  cured  all  diseases  to  some  extent,  diagnosed\ncorrectly,  and  gave  medicines  that  had  no  side  effects,  but  60  percent  utilized  traditional\nmedicines  in  cases  of  severe  disease.  A  large  number  expressed  the  view  that  as  a  result  of\ndissatisfaction with modern medicines and doctors primarily due to high cost, side effects, and\nthe unfavorable attitude of doctors, many women resorted to traditional sources of health care.7\nEvidence  from  the  focus  group  discussions  shows  that  men  perceive  hakims  and  traditional\nhealers as more discrete about their RH problems, whereas other service providers considered\nthose problems unimportant and psychological.8\n\nRegular  checkups  during  pregnancy  and  after  childbirth  are  important  for  the  health  of\n8.\nthe  mother  and  child  in  terms  of  early  assessment  of  complications  and  related  risks  for\ndelivery. Yet, only one third of married women (36 percent) report using antenatal care during\npregnancy; about 24 percent received post-natal care and only 11 percent receiving advice on\nFP  within  three  months  of  delivery.

The reasons given for using a TBA or mother-in-law assistance are their availability at\nhome,  lower  expense,  convenience  as  it  does  not  require  travel  and  leaving  home,  and  the\nnormative  behavior  in  the  village.  According  to  a  study  in  rural  parts  of  Sargodha  district,\nPunjab,  poor  women  believe  that  the  major  causes  of  reproductive  complications  are  food\ndeficiency,  inadequate  information  regarding  RH,  frequent  giving  birth,  absence  of  female\ndoctors at the facility, excessive household work, and lack of attention to their own health.10\n\nTable A11.4: Place of Delivery (percent)\n\nReligion                   Home                      Public                   Private\nAll                              82.7                          7.8                          9.4\nUrban                         61.8                        15.6                        22.6\nRural                          89.9                          4.3                          5.0\nProvince\nPunjab                        83.8                          7.8                         8.3\nSindh                          72.1                          9.8                       17.9\nNWFP                         88.6                          7.0                         4.4\nBalochistan                 92.6                          3.3                         4.0\n\n \n\n   Source: National Institute of Population Studies, 1998.\n\n10.\nAbout  half  of  the  women  respondents  reported  that  they  had  symptoms  suggestive  of\nurinary  tract  infections  or  reproductive  tract  infections  during  the  past  one  year.

However, when husbands who oppose their wives\u2019 use of FP were approached by service\nproviders  and  the  methods  and  benefits  of  FP  were  explained  to  them,  many  became  more\nsupportive of their wives' use of contraceptives.12\n\n12.\nThe findings of the field study on adult males also showed high knowledge (94 percent)\nand  use  of  FP  among  couples  (41  percent).  The  most  commonly  used  methods  reported  by\nmen  were  the  condom  and  the  injection  for  women.  About  43  percent  of  men  had  discussed\nwith  their  wives  the  number  of  children  they  would  like  to  have  and  spacing  of  children.  Men\nwho  opposed  the  idea  of  interspousal  communication  said  that  was  normative  not  to  discuss\nthese  matters  with  women,  and  also  that  children  were  God\u2019s  will,  so  there  was  no  need  to\ndiscuss  it  with  others  and  interfere  with  nature.\u201d  The  field  study  further  revealed  that  very  few\nmen had awareness and sufficient knowledge about warning signs of maternal complications in\npregnancy and childbirth. However, the majority of the respondents (85 percent) had awareness\nof sexual diseases, but did not have enough information about their spread and what could be\ndone to prevent or cure them. The majority mentioned their preference for going to the hakim for\nthe  treatment  of  sexually  transmitted  disease  (STD)/reproductive  tract  infection  (RTI),  while\nothers mentioned self-medication and use of traditional medicines.\n\n5.\n\nHealth Care for the Poor\n\n13.\nIn poor population groups where there are great economic pressures on households to\nacquire  even  the  basic  necessities  of  life,  issues  such  as  the  necessity  of  FP  or  the  dangers\npresented  by  RH  infections  are  not,  perhaps,  of  immediate  concern.  In  this  regard,  the\nprevention of STD/RTI may not have high priority in the face of many other social and economic\nproblems.  Hence,  the  needs  and  demands  of  the  client  groups  for  RH  services  vary  by  age,\nsocioeconomic status, ethnic group, residence, and gender.\n\n14.\nLow  utilization  of  RH  services  is  evident  among  rural  poor  households.  The  national\nhealth  survey  data  show  that  rural  poor  men  and  young  adults  make  fewer  visits  to  FP  and\nhealth  care  outlets  than  women  and  children  do.  Rural  men  rely  more  on  dispensers,\nparamedics  and  traditional  healers  than  urban  residents  do.  Moreover,  the  private  sector  has\nbecome  a  prominent  source  of  RH  care  in  urban  parts  of  the  country  including  hakims,\nhomeopaths, and private practitioners.13\n\nEvidence shows that family size is larger in quintiles with low per capita expenditure, and\n15.\nthat  the  contraceptive  prevalence  rate  and  number  of  couples  wanting  no  more  children  are\nlower among poor than rich households. The findings of a study in the cities of Faisalabad and\nLarkana  show  that  the  use  of  contraceptives  increases  with  income  (Table  A11.5).  This\nsuggests that, to ensure that costs of contraceptives have to be kept low.14\n\nTable A11.5: Percent Age of Women Reporting Use of Modern Methods by Income, 1996\n\nCondom\n\nInjection\n\nIUD\n\nIncome\n(PRs)\n<2000\n2000-3999\n4000+\nSource: A.

The  ranking  of  districts  is  shown  in\nTable  A11.7.  The  selection  criteria  are  (i)  poverty  and  low  social  ranking;  (ii)  low  coverage  by\nfamily  health  workers;  and  (iii)  not  having  comparable  external  support.  These  criteria  were\ndiscussed during provincial workshops and meetings with stakeholders, who also identified the\nfeasibility of implementation in the districts. A list of 34 project districts was prepared: including\n10  in  Punjab,  8  in  Sindh,  8  in  NWFP,  and  8  in  Balochistan.  Most  of  the  selected  districts  are\nfrom  the  bottom  quartile  with  poor  social  indicators.  About  50  percent  of  the  people  in  the\ntargeted districts are poor.\n\n2.\n\nExpected Beneficiaries\n\nUsing the 1998 district census, it is estimated that the project will benefit about onethird\n17.\nof  a  total  population  of  42  million  in  the  targeted  districts.  These  will  mainly  be  poor  people,\ninclude 7.7 million women of reproductive age, 8.8 million men (20-59), 5.4 million adolescent\ngirls, 4.8 million adolescent boys and 1 million infants less than 1 year).

Some  services  are  public  goods  like  mass  media  education,  or  have  positive\nexternalities. Improvements in maternal health and nutrition increase the survival probabilities and\nwell-being  of  young  children.  Increased  chances  of  child  survival  will  lead  to  lower  fertility  and\neconomic  and  environmental  gains.  In  the  absence  of  public  financing,  the  effective  demand  for\nand providing them RH services are likely to remain below a socially desirable level. The provision\nof  services  by  the  public  sector,  in  addition  to  financing,  is  also  justified  in  cases  where  private\nprovision is inadequate, the public sector is a more efficient provider, and/or consumers exhibit a\nclear preference for public services.\n\n2.\nEquity arguments in favor of subsidized health services are also strong in Pakistan; income\nand expenditure surveys suggest that one third of the population live below the poverty line.  The\npoor  in  Pakistan  have  lesser  access  to  RH  services,  for  its  monetary  and  non-monetary  price  is\nunaffordable to many. Heads of poor household often view family planning (FP) and RH issues as\nproblems  of  lesser  importance.  As  such,  public  sector  intervention  in  the  form  of  regulating  RH\nservices through price or quality control to protect consumers, rather than direct service delivery,\nwill not be effective. In the face of the target population\u2019s low ability to pay and low ranking of FP\nand RH issues, it is very likely that, when the profit-motivated private sector provides the services,\nthe poor will be marginalized and the relatively affluent classes, residing mostly in urban centers,\nwill  be  served.    Direct  public  investment  can  improve  equity  by  reducing  rural/urban  imbalances.\nGender  balance,  too,  will  be  enhanced,  as  RH  interventions  will  improve  female  health  and\npromote female employment.\n\nB.\n\nAnalysis of Demand and Need\n\n1.  \n\nSources of Family Planning Supplies and Services\n\n3.\nRecent  surveys  indicate  that  in  Pakistan,  especially  in  the  rural  areas,  RH  services  are\nobtained mainly from government sources.  According to the Pakistan Fertility and Family Planning\nSurvey 1996/97, 41 percent of urban women and 65 percent of rural women obtained FP methods\nthrough government sources. Results also show that more than 53 percent of FP clients received\ntheir  intrauterile  device  (IUDs),  injectables,  and  surgery  from  public  sector  facilities.  Forty  five\npercent  acquired  their  contraceptives  from  private  sector  outlets,  and  a  negligible  proportion  (1.4\npercent) obtained theirs from nongovernment organization (NGO) outlets.1\n\n4.\nThe Pakistan Fertility and Family Planning Survey  also shows that, although 72 percent of\nthe  clients  obtained  contraceptive  pills  from  private  sector  outlets,  the  actual  sources  are  as\nfollows: 60 percent from the public sector, 20 percent from social marketing, and 20 percent from\nthe  commercial  sector.  Similarly,  91  percent  of  injections  came  from  the  public  sector,  8  percent\nfrom  social  marketing,  and  only  1  percent  from  the  commercial  sector.  The  majority  of  the\npopulation,  particularly  rural  residents,  depend  heavily  on  services  provided  by  the  public  sector.\nThus,  the  public  sector  continues  to  play  the  central  role  in  the  health  sector.  Where  the  private\nsector provides FP and RH services, the costs to the consumers are higher than those in the public\nsector (paras. 12-13).\n\n                                                \n1 Pricing RH Services in Pakistan. Social Action Program MSU. Islamabad. August 2000.\n\n\f 68\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\n2.\n\nUnmet Need and Demand\n\n5.\nDespite  the  fact  that  knowledge  about  FP  and  RH  has  become  almost  universal  among\nwomen and men (98 percent), a wide gap exists in utilizing that knowledge for contraceptive use.\nThere is evidence of unmet need for family planning among couples, as many couples who want to\nstop or delay another pregnancy are unable to do so. The Pakistan Fertility and Family Planning\nSurvey  reported  that  about  46  percent  of  currently  married  women  (58  percent  urban  and  41\npercent rural) do not want more children, but of these 38 percent are not using any contraceptive.\nThe survey further indicates that the overall demand for FP is 61.4 percent, of which 43 percent is\nfor limiting births and 18.5 percent for spacing births; however, only about 24 percent are currently\nusing contraceptives, 18.8 percent for limiting births, and only 5.1 percent for birth spacing.\n\n6.\nAmong provinces, North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) has the highest unmet need (40.6\npercent) and Sindh has the lowest (34.2 percent). Overall, more than one third of married women\nare in need of FP in all provinces. There is unmet need for family planning in all population strata,\nincluding  among  poor  and  illiterate  mothers.  Factors  contributing  to  high  unmet  need  relate  to\ntraditional  social  and  cultural  values,  low  status  and  limited  mobility  of  women,  and  problems  of\naccess  to  the  services.  Unmet  need  results  in  a  high  number  of  unwanted  pregnancies,  which\noften lead women to resort abortion. Studies indicate that induced abortions, which can endanger\nthe mother\u2019s life, may be attempted in some way in 10-20 percent of all pregnancies. A focus on\nreaching women and men with unmet need through this Project will reduce fertility significantly and\nimprove mortality and health status indicators among the poor.\n\nC.\n\nFinancing RH Expenditures\n\n1.  \n\nAllocations and Expenditures\n\nThe  major  components  of  RH  services  relate  to  comprehensive  maternal  and  child  care\n7.\nincluding  safe  motherhood,  emergency  obstetric  services,  FP,  and  control  of  reproductive  tract\ninfections (RTI) and sexually transmitted diseases (STD). Specific expenditure data on RH services\nare  not  routinely  collected  in  Pakistan.  The  Social  Action  Program  (SAP)  expenditure  on  basic\nhealth  and  population  welfare  program  can  be  used  to  estimate  the  expenditures  on  RH.  In  its\n2000/01  Public  Sector  Development  Program  of  PRs120.5  billion,  the  Government  allocated\nPRs14.0 billion to basic health services, about one third of which would have been spent on RH,\nand PRs2.2 billion to the population welfare program (PWP). Hence, the RH budget is estimated at\nabout PRs7 billion ($117 million) per year.\n\n8.\nSince  the  inception  of  the  PWP,  total  funding  to  the  population  program  had  risen  slowly\nuntil  the  late  1970s.  Subsequently  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  PWP  was  demonstrated  by\nthe significant increase in its funding from PRs2.3 billion during 1983-1988 to PRs15 billion for the\nperiod  1998-2003.  During  the  Eighth  Five-Year  Plan  (1993-1998),  the  share  of  international\nassistance  was  32  percent.  Current  aid  agency  support  for  PWP  is  mainly  through  SAP  and  the\nUnited Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA). The health sector has also received major\nexternal support for the RH-related federal programs, and for maternal and child health (MCH)/FP\nservices.  The  current  major  external  support  for  the  RH  sector  comes  from  SAP,  the  UNFPA\nprogram,  and  the  Women\u2019s  Health  Project.  The  annual  recurrent  cost  of  the  proposed  Project  is\nabout 2 percent of public spending in the health sector.\n\n9.\nThe  issue  of  adequacy  of  public  sector  funding  could  be  viewed  from  the  perspective  of\nrequirements to meet the objectives of public policy and the existing capacity of the public sector\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\ndelivery system.2 Presently, the RH program comprises a small proportion of the budget. Given the\nlarge  unmet  needs  of  the  population  and  the  rationale  for  public  sector  involvement,  there  is\nadequate  justification  for  a  substantial  increase  in  allocations.  There  is  no  doubt  that,  at  present,\nthe public sector faces a severe fiscal constraint in view of the Government\u2019s other obligations, in\nparticular debt services and defense expenditures. There is little room for bringing about a major\nincrease in public health spending without external support.\n\n2. \n\nHouseholds\u2019 Ability to Pay\n\nAccording to the Household Integrated Economic Survey of 1996/97, the average monthly\n10.\nexpenditures on health care increase as income levels rise, except for the lowest income group (up\nto PRs1,000) in urban areas, for which health expenditures appear relatively higher than those for\nhigher income groups.  For each income group, as well as for the overall population, the share of\nhealth  care  expenditures  in  the  total  household  budget  is  higher  for  rural  residents  (3.1  percent)\nthan for those in urban areas (2.4 percent); this is mainly due to the lower household budgets of\nrural people.  Nevertheless, this share of health care expenditures in the overall household budget\nis very low, i.e., it varies between 2 and 3 percent for all income classes.\n\n11. While household spending on health care is low, statistical evidence for Pakistan suggests\nthat the low-income classes in both urban as well rural areas dissave, i.e., on average, spend more\nthan  their  incomes,  up  to  monthly  income  levels  of  almost  PRs3,500-PRs4,000.    This  reflects  a\nvery low ability to pay for any extra expenditure due to either more services consumed or higher\ncharges for existing services.\n\n3.\n\nUser Charges in Reproductive Health\n\n12.\nImposition  or  increase  of  user  charges  on  social  services  is  a  major  issue  in  Pakistan.  In\nthis context, the social benefits of providing the service to low-income groups outweigh the private\nbenefits. However, the key question is whether raising the price of RH services will affect the users\u2019\nability  to  pay  and  significantly  reduce  the  use  of  service  demanded,  and  whether  some  form  of\nsubsidy is required.\n\nRH services are provided at a nominal cost. In population welfare services, clients pay for\n13.\ncommodities.  In  the  health  services,  clients  pay  a  registration  fee.  Family  health  workers  do  not\nhave  to  charge.  This  difference  in  pricing  policy  has  resulted  in  frequent  nonavailability  of\ncontraceptives in health services. In addition, clients report having paid more for services in public\nhealth  outlets.  One  study3  estimated  that  an  average  client's  mean  expenditures  on  delivery  in\nGovernment hospitals are PRs590 (ranging from PRs258 to PRs2,096) compared with the formal\naverage charges of PRs24. However, these services cost more in NGOs and private clinics.\n\n4. \n\nPotential for Cost Recovery\n\n14.\nThe  estimated  cost  of  protection  against  conception  for  one  year  per  couple  varies  by\nmethod, but in any case is low. The prices charged by the public sector reflect a policy support for\nintrauterine  devices  and  injectables.  More  recently,  there  was  a  debate  about  charging  more  for\ncontraceptives in view of limited public resources and unavailability of grant financing.\n\n                                                \n2 All activities in the population welfare sector are treated as development expenditure and are financed from the PSDP.\n3 Kadir, M . 1997:  Expenses borne by the Users of Obstetric Services at Government Hospitals; College of Physicians\n\nand Surgeons, Karachi.\n\n\f 70\n\nAppendix 12, page 4\n\n22.   Given  the  present  nominal  costs  of  FP  modes,  it  is  not  surprising  to  observe  that  only  a\nnegligible  percentage  (0.4  percent  in  urban  and  0.9  percent  in  rural  areas)  of  respondents  in  a\nnational survey stated \u201ccosts too much\u201d as a reason for nonuse of FP.  However, full cost recovery\nby raising prices of RH services is presently not advisable as it would reduce affordability to a large\nproportion of current users and adversely affect the demand for such services.4 Improvements in\nquality  of  care,  however,  may  encourage  higher  levels  of  service  utilization  and  justify  a  small\nincrease in user charges at a later date. A small increase in user charges for FP methods may not\nhave  any  apparent  affect  on  contraceptive  prevalence  in  view  of  large  unmet  demand  for  these\nservices. However, it may affect the poor who would benefit most from FP. Moreover, unit costs in\nPakistan is expected to stay low for the next few years as international evidence suggests that unit\ncosts start to rise once contraceptive prevalence is above 40-50 percent.\n\nD.\n\nCost Effectiveness of RH services\n\n15.\nBenefits  from  the  Project  are  estimated  using  the  disabilityadjusted  life  years  approach.\nThis approach entails constructing a composite index of the years of health life lost due to disease,\ndisability, or death, and the years of life gained. The procedure for calculating the disabilityadjusted\nlife years is detailed in ADB\u2019s Economic Analysis of Health Sector Projects.\n\n16.\nBased  on  the  health  conditions  for  which  data  are  available  in  Pakistan,  i.e.,  maternal,\nnutrition, infant-related, childhood cluster, and STDs, the Project\u2019s cost-effectiveness is calculated.\nSince Pakistan has been classified as a \u201cdata poor\u201d country in the context of disabilityadjusted life\nyears  calculations,  \u201ccrude\u201d  estimates  are  given.  Table  A12.1  presents  the  total  number  of\ndisabilityadjusted  life  years  that  can  be  potentially  saved  by  the  six-year  Project.  Incidence  of\ndiseases  and  disability-adjusted  life  years  are  based  on  the  1994  National  Health  Survey  of\nPakistan  and  are  calculated  for  a  typical  year  during  the  project  implementation  period  and  four\nyears after. The incidence and disability-adjusted life years were increased by 20 percent to adjust\nfor poor rural populations being targeted under the Project. The Project is assumed to reduce most\ntypes  of  morbidity  by  only  10  percent,  which  is  low  but  reflects  a  realistic  estimate  of  coverage,\nabsorptive capacity and effectiveness of interventions in the districts.\n\n17.\nThe Project is estimated to save a disabilityadjusted life years at $21, well within the range\nof  costs  given  in  Jamison,  et  al.\u2019s Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries,  1993.5  For\nclinical  services  for  pregnancy  and  delivery  care,  the  range  is  $30-$250;  for  FP  promotion,  the\nrange  is  $15-$75.  It  is  low  because  of  the  large  target  population  being  reached  with  low-cost\ninterventions. In the Project, the cost per disabilityadjusted life years saved is low because of the\nlarge target population being reached through low cost interventions.\n\n                                                \n4 The Project is also focused on the poorest segments of population in Pakistan.\n5 Jamison, D. et al. 1993.
