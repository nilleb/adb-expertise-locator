In \nparticular, the capacity building will include support to build  Ministry of \nFinance  (MOF)  capacity  in  the  maintenance  of  the  GFMIS  and \nmanagement of associated databases. \n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n \n\nRationale  \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\nlocal \n\nlines, \n\nthroughout \n\nprocurement \n\ntelecommunication \n\nThe second component will comprise development and implementation \nof  a  GFMIS.  It  will  provide  financing  for  (i) procurement,  setting  of \nparameters,  installation  and  deployment  of  an  integrated  treasury \nsoftware  application  package  with  associated  documentation  and \ntraining  services;  (ii)  supply  of  main  servers  for  the  central  treasury \noffice  and  a  back-up processing center in Tashkent; (iii) supply of the \ncomputers  and  networking  items  to  equip  the  treasury  offices  being \nestablished \nof \nUzbekistan; \ntelecommunications equipment; and (v) local area networking, including \ndedicated \nlocal  area  network \ninfrastructure,  power  supply,  monitoring,  and  alarm  systems  for  local \noffices. \n \nThe \nthird  component  will  comprise  establishment  of  a  project \nmanagement  office  (PMO)  under  MOF  to  manage  day-to-day  project \nactivities. The PMO will work in close cooperation with MOF, Treasury, \nand its offices at central and local levels. \n \nThe  proposed  Project  is  in  line  with  the  principles  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  for \nUzbekistan,  endorsed  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of Directors  in  March  2006.  It \naims  to  support  the  country\u2019s  transition  to  a  market-based  economy \nand  promote  good  governance.  Uzbekistan  has recently  developed  a \npublic  finance  management  (PFM)  reform  strategy  which  outlines  an \naction plan  for  the next 12 years to (i) establish a functioning  treasury \nsystem,  (ii)  adopt  and  implement  a  modern  unified  budget  and \naccounting  system,  and \nintroduce  a  medium-term  budget \nframework  (MTBF)  and  program  budgeting.  The  Project  will  provide \nsupport  mainly  for  implementing  and  refining  the  PFM  strategy.  The \nPFM reform will have significant implications for the country\u2019s economic \nmanagement,  leading  to  more  effective  and  efficient  management  of \npublic  resources.  The  proposed  Project  will  also  provide  a  good \nfoundation for future dialogue and cooperation between the authorities \nand ADB in further PFM reform over the next 10\u201312 years.   \n \nThe  project  impact  will  be  improved  planning  and  utilization  of  public \nresources.  The  project  outcome  will  be  improved  effectiveness, \nefficiency, \ntransparency  and  accountability  of  budget  execution \nprocesses.  The  Project  impact  and  outcome  will  be  mo nitored  and \nmeasured mainly by the performance indicators as described in paras. \n9\u201310  of  the  main  text,  and  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  in \nAppendix 1.  \n \n \n\n(iii) \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  The  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $37.36 million.  The \ncost estimates include $3.95 million for taxes and duties, $1.28 million \nfor  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  estimated  financing  charges \nduring  implementation  (comprising  interest  during  implementation  and \na commitment charge) of $2.61 million. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\niii \n\nA  loan  of  $20.70 million from  ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources  will be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term  including  a  grace \nperiod of 4 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.35%  per \nannum  on  undisbursed  loan  amount,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  set forth  in the  draft  loan  agreement.  The  Borrower  will  be \nthe  Republic  of  Uzbekistan.  The  requested  level  of  financing  will \ncomprise 55% of the total project cost. The Government will contribute \n$16.66  million  toward  the  project  cost,  including  $10  million  for \nfinancing refurbishment of treasury offices nationwide, $2.61 million for \nfinancing  charges  during  implementation,  and  $3.95  million  in  taxes \nand duties.  \n \n \n \n\n Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of Uzbekistan \n \n\nTotal \n\n   Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n20.70 \n16.66 \n37.36 \n\nPercent \n55 \n45 \n100 \n\n \nUntil 31 July 2012 \n \n31 January 2012  \n\n \nMinistry of Finance \n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  4  years.  Project \nactivities  will  include  the  selection  of  a  vendor  for  development  and \ninstallation  of  the  GFMIS,  procurement  of  hardware  and  networking \nequipment,  and  development  and \nimplementation  of  a  project \nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  The  establishment  of \nthe  treasury  institutional  network  and  support  for  capacity  building  in \nbudget reform will be implemented in line with progress in development \nand implementation of the GFMIS.  \n \nGoods  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The \nGovernment  will  furnish  a  project  procurement  plan  for  ADB  approval. \nThe Government  will  implement  the  procurement  plan  as  approved  by \nADB,  and  will  update  the  procurement  plan  annually,  or  as  needed. \nADB  will  disclose  the  plan  and  its  updates  to  the  public  after  the \napproval of related financing. Major contracts to be financed by ADB\u2019s \nloan  for  information  technology  (IT)  software  and  equipment  and \ncosting  $0.5  million  equivalent  or  more  will  be  awarded  through \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB). \n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nProcurement \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\nConsulting Services \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\nIT  certification  company  engaged  on \n\nShopping  procedure  will  be  used  for  contracts  valued  at  $100,000 \nequivalent  or  less.  For  the  procurement  of  items  valued  at  less  than \n$10,000,  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)   may  purchase  the  items  directly \nfrom the supplier. In such cases, ADB should be satisfied that the price \npaid is reasonable.  \n \nAll goods and services financed by the loan  will be procured from ADB \nmember  countries.  In  addition,  where  the  value  of  goods  financed  by \nthe loan exceeds $1 million, a preshipment certificate from a reputable \nagency acceptable to ADB may be required. The award of all contracts \nand  substantial  contract  variations  will  be  subject  to  prior  approval  by \nADB. \n \nAbout 10  IT specialists from MOF will be trained in the following areas: \n(i)  database  administration,  (ii)  operational  systems  engineering,  and \n(iii)  network  technology  engineering.  The  training  and  certification  will \nin \nbe  provided  during  the  first  year  of  project  implementation \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time), under a contract between the PMO and an \nauthorized \nthe  basis  of \nconsultant\u2019s qualifications selection method.  \n \nAn  international  IT and  procurement  consultant  will  provide  8  person-\nmonths  of  consultancy  input  to  assist  the  PMO  in  conducting  ICB \nprocurements  of  the  various  GFMIS  components,  in  particular  the \ndevelopment and implementation of  the GFMIS software (procurement \npackage  1).  MOF  will  engage  an  individual  international  consultant  in \naccordance with ADB procedures for recruiting individual consultants.  \n \nThe  outcome  of \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  project  will  be \nstrengthened  capacity  of  the  Government  in  budget  preparation  and \nexecution  using  the  revised  budget  classification.  The TA  project  will \naddress the immediate capacity-building needs and focus on the areas \nnot covered by other donors either now or in the near future. \n \nThe  TA  project  will  have  two  components:  (i)  support  for  budget \npreparation,  and  (ii)  support  for  budget  execution  through  treasury \noperations  using  the  GFMIS.  The  TA  project  outputs  will  comprise  (i) \ndevelopment  of  user  manuals  on  budget  preparation  and  treasury \noperation under the  revised  budget  classifications; (ii) development of \ntraining  modules  and  materials  in  budget  preparation  and  execution \nusing  the  revised  budget  classification  system;  (iii)  development  of \nperformance  indicators  for  the  education  sector;  and  (iv)  training  of  17 \nstaff  from  MOF  Treasury,  Budget  Department, and  Treasury  Training \nCenter  in  budget  preparation  and  budget  execution  based  on  the \nrevised budget classification. \n \n \n\nthe \n\n\f \n\nv \n\nThe TA project will be implemented over a period of 24 months, starting \nin  January  2008. MOF will be the EA for the  TA  project. MOF  Budget \nDepartment  will  be  the  main  counterpart  for  budget  preparation \nactivities while the  Treasury  will  coordinate the budget execution. The \nTA  project  will  require  international  (24  person-months)  and  national \n(48 person-months) consultants with the following areas of expertise: (i) \nperformance-based  budget  preparation,  and  (ii)  budget  execution \nthrough  treasury  operations.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  and \nengaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB  procedures  for  recruiting \nindividual consultants. \n \nThe major benefits of the  Project will be indirect, and will be reflected in \n(i)  improved  budget  quality,  (ii)  budget execution  efficiency  and  linkage \nbetween budgeting and policy objectives as well as program outcomes, \n(iii) greater transparency and accountability in PFM, underpinned by the \nestablished  treasury  institutional  network  and  modern  treasury  system; \nand  (iv)  progress  in  the  introduction  of  the  MTBF  and  program \nbudgeting.  Direct  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  will be  the  savings \nderived  from  better  cash  management  and  thus  reduced  interest \npayments. \n \nBeneficiaries of the Project will include (i) policy makers  and institutions \nwho,  with  the  help  of  the  modern  treasury,  will  be  able  to  make \ndecisions  and,  if  necessary,  fiscal  adjustments,  based  on  the  timely \navailability of better-classified information; (ii) stakeholders, including the \ngeneral  public  and  parliament,  who  will  be  able  to  better  assess  and \nmonitor  the  effect  of  the  PFM;  and  (iii)  the  general  public,  who  will \nbenefit  from  the  provision  of  public  goods  and  services  that  are \nfacilitated by improved payment and budget execution processes. \n  \nThe continued Government commitment to, and ownership of, the PFM \nreform will be crucial for the Project\u2019s success and the achievement of \nthe  intended  outcome  and  impact.  This  is  especially  true  when  reform \nin  the  MTBF  and  program  budgeting  becomes  further  advanced.  It  is \nrecognized  that  this  is  a  long-term,  complex  task  and  sometimes  an \niterative  process,  and  will  require  institutional  changes  and  significant \ncapacity  building  of  relevant  institutions,  especially  in  formulation  of \nsector policies and development of performance indicators to measure \nand  monitor  the  effect  of  the  reform.  Currently,  the  Government  is \nreceiving  assistance  in  this  area  from  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme  (UNDP)  and  European  Union  Technical  Assistance  to  the \nCommonwealth  of  Independent  States  (TACIS).  It  is  unclear  to  date \nwhether  this  assistance  will  be  adequate,  as  the  needs  may  evolve. \nConsequently  this  will  be  one  of  the  main  areas  for  future  dialogue \nbetween the Government and ADB. Depending on the country\u2019s needs \nand  the  implementation  of  other  development-partner  programs  in \ncapacity  building,  ADB  will  design  its  future  program  in  this  area \naccordingly. \n\n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAnother  risk  is  that  staff  assigned  to  the  newly  established  treasury \noffices  will  be  inadequately  skilled.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  a  targeted \ntraining  program  is  planned.  This  program will be carefully sequenced \nin  line  with  the  progress  in  development  and  implementation  of  the \nGFMIS, and will include provisions that will help prevent the loss of key \ntrained  staff.  Ongoing  and  planned  commitment  by  other  development \npartners in this area will also help mitigate the risks. \n \nFrequent  turnover  of  PMO  staff  is  a  potential  risk.  ADB  will  work  with \nthe  Government  to  minimize  staff  turnover  and  ensure  the  PMO  is \nequipped with competent, full-time staff. \n \nEffective  coordination  with  development  partners  will  be  important  to \nmeet  the  country\u2019s  long-term  needs  for  capacity  building.  Such \ncoordination  during  the  project  preparation  stage  has  been  very  good; \nADB  will  work  to  maintain  close  cooperation.  The  fact  that  ADB\u2019s \nUzbekistan  Resident  Mission  is  leading  the  project  preparation  and \nimplementation will help the coordination.  \n  \n\n\f \n\n \n\nv\n\ni\ni\n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Republic  of  Uzb ekistan for  the  Public  Finance  Management  Reform  Project.1 The  report \nalso  describes \nfinance \ntechnical  assistance  (TA) \nmanagement  (PFM)  reforms.  If  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \napproves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will \napprove the TA.  \n \n\nfor  supporting  public \n\nthe  proposed \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nUzbekistan is the most populous country in the Central  Asia region and has the second-\nlargest  economy.  Located  strategically  in  the  center  of  the  region,  it  borders  the  four  other \nCentral Asian countries, and  Afghanistan. It is  one of the few \u201cdouble land-locked\u201d countries in \nthe world (i.e., surrounded only by other landlocked countries). Uzbekistan has abundant natural \nresources,  including  gold,  natural  gas,  copper  and  uranium.  It  has  an  economy  dominated  by \nagriculture,  with  almost  70%  of  the  population  living  in  rural  areas.  It  also  has  a  young \npopulation, with more than 50% of the people under the age of 19.   \n \n3. \nAt  independence  in  1991,  Uzbekistan  inherited  a  difficult  economic  situation.  The \neconomy  then  underwent  significant  changes,  declining  considerably  until  1996 when it began \nto show some modest growth.  Economic growth  has accelerated  during 2004-2006. The gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  grew  by  7.3%  on  average  during  this  period,  compared  with  4.2% \nduring  1999\u20132003.  Favorable  external  prices  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  major  exports and real growth of \nnoncommodity  exports  have  contributed  to  this  recent  growth.  However,  economic  growth \nremains  narrowly  based  and  the  economy  has  yet  to  realize  its  growth  potential.  Uzbekistan \nremains a low-income country, with per capita GDP estimated at $606 in 2006.  \n \n4. \nThe economy  experienced significant macroeconomic imbalances until 2000. Since then \nmacroeconomic management has improved; monetary policies were tightened and distortions in \nexchange rates reduced, leading to unification of exchange rates and the introduction of current \naccount  convertibility  in  October  2003.  However,  the  overall  progress  in  macroeconomic  and \nstructural  reforms  has  been  mixed.  There  are  many  daunting  challenges  facing  the  country  in \ncarrying out economic reforms, especially in the banking and trade sectors.  \n \n5. \nProgress  on the fiscal  reform  has been encouraging.  Lending from the  Central  Bank of \nUzbekistan  (CBU)  to  the  budget  has  been  discontinued.  Government  expenditure  has  been \nreduced from 45% of GDP in 1998 to about 32% in 2006.  After reaching 10% of GDP in 1998\u2013\n1999, fiscal deficits were  subsequently  reduced  significantly  and  have been largely  eliminated \nsince 2004. Debt levels have improved with the adoption of prudent fiscal policy and a zero-net-\nborrowing strategy. A more detailed sector and subsector analysis is given in Appendix 2. \n  \n6. \nAfter  a  number  of  years of  piloting  various  elements  of  fiscal  reforms,  the  Government \nhas adopted a long-term strategic approach to advancing the reform process.  In May 2007, the \nMinistry  of  Finance  (MOF) developed  a  PFM  reform strategy  for  2007\u20132018 (Appendix 3) with \nsupport from the  IMF Fiscal  Affairs Department  and  ADB. The strategy outlines an action plan \n\n                                                 \n1   The project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n\f2 \n\nThe  PFM  reform  will  have  significant  implications \n\n \n \nfor  the  next  12  years  which  will  (i)  establish  a  functioning  treasury  system;  (ii)  adopt  and \nimplement a modern, unified budget and accounting system; and (iii) introduce a medium-term \nbudget framework (MTBF) and program budgeting. \n \n7. \nA  central  element  of  the  PFM  reform  is  to  improve  the  budget  execution  process \nsignificantly over the next 5 years. The PFM reform strategy has planned to set up a nationwide \nnetwork of  treasury  offices  with a  central  treasury  in MOF,  local  treasury  departments  at  the \nregional 2 (oblast)  level  and  branches  at  the  district  (rayon)  level.  These  treasury  offices  will \nprovide services to the budget organizations of both national and subnational governments.  It is \nalso  planned  to  consolidate  the  currently  fragmented  treasury  banking  operations  under  a \ntreasury single account (TSA) at the CBU, to be supported by the computerized GFMIS. \n \n8. \nfor  the  country\u2019s  economic \nmanagement.  As envisaged by the strategy, the focus of the reform over the  medium term (3\u20135 \nyears) will be mainly on improving the efficiency, effectiveness, transparency, and accountability \nof  the  budget  execution  process.  Over  the  long  term  (10\u201312  years)  the  reform  will  gradually \nmove its focus to improving the results of the budget. \n \n9. \nKey  performance  indicators  to  measure  and monitor  the  progress and  achievement  of \nthe  reform  objective  over  the  medium  term  include  (i)  the  existence  of  a  clear annual budget \ncalendar,  (ii)  the  requirement  of  appropriation  of  public  expenditure  by  parliament,  (iii)  the \nadoption  of  an  expenditure  commitment  control  scheme  that  can  effectively  limit  the \ncommitments  to  actual  cash  availability  to  approved  budget  allocations  for  most  types  of \nexpenditure, and (iv) the preparation and regular update of cash flow forecasts on the basis of \nactual cash inflows and outflows.  \n  \n10. \nKey  performance  indicators  over  the  long  term  include  (i)  linkage  between  budget  and \npolicy  objectives  and  programs;  (ii)  budget  preparation  and  allocation  made  with  a  multi-year \nperspective  based  on  reasonable  forecasts  of  major  fiscal  aggregate  for  the next  3 years; (iii) \ninclusion of  cost  implications  in  the  preparation  of  selected  sector  strategies;  and  (iv)  annual \npublication of  an  approved  and  executed  budget  with  a  gradual  increase  in  the  coverage  and \ncontent, moving toward greater uniformity with international standards and including economic, \nfunctional, administrative, and program classifications, as well as underlying policy assumptions. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nKey Problems \n\n11. \nBudget  Preparation.  Uzbekistan  inherited  the  budget  preparation  process  that  is \ncommon  to  all  other  countries  that  were  part  of  the  former  Soviet  Union.  Currently,   budget \nentities prepare their budget requests largely on the basis of previous inputs rather according to \nclear  policies  and  policy  objectives  linked  to  defined  programs  with  performance  indicators. \nMOF receives budget requests from  a large number of budget  agencies,  many of  which lack \ncapacity  in  making  policy  choices.  MOF  reviews  the  budget  requests  in  terms  of  their \nconsistency  with  current  regulations,  and  applies  cuts  mainly  to  the  fourth  category  of \nexpenditure,3  which  often  leads  to  a  lack  of  funds  for  maintenance  and  current  supplies.  The \n\n                                                 \n2 The 12 oblasts of Uzbekistan, the city of Tashkent, and the Autonomous Republic of Karakalpakstan.  \n3  Total  expenditures  are  classified  into  four  major  categories:  (i)  social  sphere  expenditure,  (ii)  expenditure  on  the \neconomy, (iii) expenditure on state power and administration, and (iv) other expenditures.  \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\navailable  time  and  data  do not give MOF the opportunity to undertake  in-depth analysis of the \nlinks between proposed or existing economic policies and the state budget scenarios.  \n \nUntil recently the budget also suffered from the lack of a medium-term perspective, such \n12. \nas  a  medium-term  fiscal  framework  (MTFF)  that  would  project  important  macroeconomic \nvariables\u2014including  GDP,  balance  of  payments,  inflation,  and  interest  rates\u2014over  a  3\u20135-year \nperiod. Such an MTFF would form  the basis for more reliable revenue estimates. In conjunction \nwith  the  Government\u2019s  deficit  target,  these  revenue  estimates  would  (i)  establish  an  overall \nspending  limit,  (ii)  allow  for  the  establishment  of  sector  spending  limits,  and  (iii)  enable  the \ndevelopment of  a coherent  and  sustainable  aggregate  and  sector  expenditure  policy.  In effect \nthere  are  two  budget  preparation  processes:  the  first  covers  the  recurrent  budget, the second \ncovers  investment  expenditures  under  the  public  investment  program.  The  lack  of  a  medium-\nterm perspective in the recurrent budget preparation, and lack of a link between the two budget \nprocesses, leads to inaccurate and incomplete costing of sector programs. As a result, this often \nleads to mismatches in recurrent and investment expenditure plans.  \n \n13. \nThere  is  no  medium-term,  bottom-up  budget  exercise  to  accompany  the  top-down \napproach  underpinned  by  the  MTFF.  Such  an  exercise  would  properly  cost  and  evaluate \nexpenditure programs and allocate scarce public resources to those that are most effective. \n \n14. \nA  significant  portion  of  general  government  expenditure  is  not  covered  by  the  budget \nprocess.  In  addition,  most  budget  organizations  are  allowed  to  supplement  their  finances  by \nraising budget revenues and retaining part of them in extra-budgetary funds. As a consequence, \npolicy  decisions  are  often  made  without  comprehensive  analysis  of  the  overall  fiscal  resource \nenvelopes and expenditure requirements. \n \n15. \nUntil recently the budget was prepared using a classification system that did not permit \nindependent  functional  and  economic  analysis.  As  there  is  a  mix  of  functional  elements  and \neconomic  categories  in  the  budget  classification,  proper  evaluation  and  accountability  in \nassessing  the  budget\u2019s  effect  when  compared  against  government  policy  objectives  and \npriorities was not possible. \n \n16. \nBudget  Execution.  Budget  execution  arrangements  are  fragmented,  resulting  in \ndispersal  of  cash  resources  and  weak  payment  control.  There  are  almost  50,000  budget \norganizations  controlling  over  100,000  bank  accounts,  mostly  in  commercial  banks.  Line \nministries  have  poor  control  over  the  budget  organizations  that  operate  in  their  areas  of \nresponsibility.  Such  organizational  arrangements  make  it  difficult  for  MOF  to  reconcile  cash-\naccount balances and monitor budget execution effectively.  \n  \nBudgetary  monitoring  and  accounting  is  weak,  and  the  system  for  fiscal  reporting  is \n17. \nelaborate but ineffective. Currently  CBU submits a daily report on the aggregate cash position, \nwhile  line  ministries  prepare  a  monthly  report  on  cash  payments  (aggregated  by  broad \neconomic  categories)  and  detailed  quarterly  reports  that  cover  both  cash  payments  and \nexpenditures.  However,  this  reporting  system  is  not  sufficient  to  give  timely  and  complete \ninformation  on  budget  execution,  partly  as  the  reports  of  the  numerous  spending  units  are \nprepared  and  processed  manually.  Such  processing  of  reports  is  time  consuming  and  as  a \nresult  detailed  information  for  each  spending  unit is  often  not  available  to  MOF,  making cash \nplanning difficult. \n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n \n\n18. \nThere  is  a  lack  of  segregation  of  duties,  i.e.,  separation  between  the  release  of  the \nauthority to spend and the release of cash to  agencies, with cash being transferred to spending \nunits  through  the  system  of  bank  accounts  of  line  ministries.  This procedure allows spending \nagencies and the intermediate government institutions to build up idle cash balances, and thus \nincreases MOF\u2019s gross-borrowing requirements. \n \n19. \nThe accounting and reporting system is weak and cumbersome.  Budget  organizations \nand MOF\u2019s  budget and  financial departments in oblasts and rayons financed directly from MOF \nmaintain their accounts in accordance with a COA prescribed by the Government of the former \nSoviet Union  in  1986.  A  separate  COA  is  issued  to  account  for  periodic  cash  releases  to  line \nministries during the budget execution process. The budget and financial departments in oblasts \nand rayons use yet another COA to account for cash releases made to the budget organizations \nunder  their  jurisdiction.  The  CBU,  its  regional  branches,  and  accredited  commercial  banks \ncontinue to record and report on government cash transactions in accordance with a COA that \ncaptures  major  economic  categories  of  expenditure  and  tax  revenues  by  type  of  taxes.  In \naddition,  much  of  the  accounting  and  reporting  is  processed  manually.  Because  there  is  no \nuniform  COA  for  government  operations  at  different  levels  of  Government,  MOF  is  able  to \nconsolidate  only  the  cash  account  for  the  central  government  on  a  regular  basis.  Budget \norganizations  have  to  reference  other  classification  systems  to  account  for  and  report  other \ntransaction flows and stocks.  A detailed sector and subsector analysis is presented in  Appendix \n2. \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment Initiatives and Opportunities \n\nSince 2000 the Government has undertaken measures to address these weaknesses.  \n\n20. \n  \n21. \nLegal  Framework.  The  parliament  approved  the  Budget  System  Law  (BSL)  in \nDecember 2000, providing a  legal  basis for budget  management. The law sets out the process \nof preparation of the annual budgets by the national and subnational governments. It also lays \ndown  the  parliamentary  authority  for  setting  public  debt  limits  and  provisions  for  giving  state \nguarantees. The Treasury Law was passed in 2004, authorizing the creation of a Treasury. The \nmain tasks provided for by the law include  (i) control and management of the  state budget cash \nresources, (ii) registration of contracts of budget organizations, (iii) accounting of all government \ntransactions, (iv) servicing of public debt, and (v) execution of national government guarantees. \nThe  Treasury  Law  also  authorized  creation  of  TSA  at  CBU  to  hold  all  government  cash \nresources.  During  subsequent  years,  the  Government  has  recognized  the  need  for  further \nimprovements  in  these  laws and is committed to  refining  them, in  particular  by  (i)  harmonizing \nthe BSL and Treasury Law on budget execution; (ii) providing for parliamentary appropriation of \nthe  state  budget,  and  progressive  provision  for  budget  organization  extra-budgetary  funds; (iii) \nprogressively improving disclosure of the state budget and budget organization extra-budgetary \nfunds; (iv) eventually producing annual accounts, audited by independent external auditors; and \n(v) certifying and submi tting reports to the parliament, and the publication of these reports. \n \nBudget  Preparation.  A  major  step  has  been  undertaken  to  improve  the  quality  of  the \n22. \nbudget  by  preparing  a  3-year  MTFF  in  accordance  with  the  essence  of  the  interim  Welfare \nImprovement  Strategy  and  Program.  Starting  with  2005,  a  rolling  MTFF  has  been  prepared, \nestablishing  targets  for  revenues  and  expenditures  for  the  subsequent  3  years.  This  is \nconsistent  with  medium-term  projections  for  GDP,  ceilings  for  the  budget  deficit  and  public \nborrowing,  as  well  as  with  other  macroeconomic  parameters.  A  working  group  consisting  of \nrepresentatives of MOF, the Ministry of Economy (MOE), and CBU has developed projections of \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nmain  macroeconomic  parameters,  revenues,  and  expenditures  for  the state budget, and basic \ndirections  for  budgetary  policy  for  2005\u201307,  thus  laying  the  foundation  for  an  MTBF  for \nexpenditure consistent with the MTFF. As part of the reform process, sector expenditure ceilings \nwere set for the first time in the 2005 budget. \n  \n23.  Work  has  also  begun  to  formulate  the  budget  on  the  basis  of  programs  and  policy \nobjectives  rather  than  input  norms.  This is being done  by  the  introduction  of an experimental \nprogram  budgeting  process  in  selected  ministries,  including  the  Ministry  of  Education.  This \nbottom-up approach will complement the top-down MTFF reform. \n \n24.  With  external  assistance,  considerable  work  has  been  done  in  developing  a  revised \nbudget classification system. The revised classification is in line with best international practices \nas  laid  down  in  the  International  Monetary  Fund\u2019s  (IMF\u2019s)  Government  Finance  Statistics \nManual (GFSM 2001). \n \nIt  will  take  some  years  before  this  fundamental  change  in  the  mode  of  budget \n25. \npreparation  becomes  comprehensive  and  systemized.  The  MTFF  process,  including  the \nprocess of setting sector expenditure ceilings, is still in the early stages of development and will \nrequire  considerable  further  enhancement  using  sound  economic  data  before  it  can  meet \naccepted international standards. Development of the MTBF on a rolling basis will also require \nsome  institutional  changes  and  capacity  building  of  relevant  institutions,  especially  line \nministries, in understanding and formulating sector strategic policies and investment programs. \n \nBudget  Execution.  The  Government established a  central  Treasury  in  MOF  following \n26. \nthe  passage  of  the  Treasury  Law  in  2004.   In  April  2005, the  Government  began  developing \ntreasury  procedures  for  ex-ante  checking  of  the  expenditures  of  budget  organizations  and \napplying commitment controls by preregistration of contracts in two pilot regions (Tashkent  city \nand Samarkand oblast) and their associated districts. \n \n27. \nBy  the  end  of  2006  the  pilot  program  had  been  extended  to  six  other  regions  and \ndistricts.  Implementation  of  the  treasury  system  to  the  remaining  regions  and  districts  is  set  to \nbe completed by  the  end  of  2007.  Treasury  offices  have  opened  consolidated  bank  accounts, \nclosing  down  the  many  bank  accounts  held  by  budget  organizations  for  budget  operations  in \nthese  pilot  regions.  Treasury  operations  are  now  conducted  using  a  mix  of  manual  and \ninformation \nlimited  but  core \nfunctionalities. \n \n28. \nIn  February  2007,  the  Government  approved  the  organizational  structure  and  staffing \nplan for the central Treasury and treasury departments and branches in the oblasts and rayons,4 \nand in March 2007 appointed the Head of Treasury. \n \n29. \nPFM  Reform  Strategy. Recognizing  that  the reform  is  a  long-term  and complex  task, \nthe Government has begun to take a  holistic,  long-term view.  In  May  2007, MOF developed a \nPFM reform strategy for the period 2007\u20132018. As described in paras. 6-7, the strategy outlines \nan action plan for the next 12 years to develop a modern  treasury system, implement a unified \nbudget  and  accounting  system,  and  introduce  an  MTBF  and  program  budgeting  in  selected \nsectors.  An  important  element  of  the  strategy  is  to  develop  a  GFMIS  which  will  enable \n\n(IT)  systems  developed \n\nin-house,  covering \n\ntechnology \n\n                                                 \n4   Presidential Resolution No. PP-594 was issued  on 28 February 2007 \u201cOn measures for further development of a \n\nsystem of treasury execution of the State Budget\u201d. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n \nconsolidation  of  the  bank  accounts  of  all  budget  organizations  under  the  TSA  at  CBU.  The \nGFMIS will  progressively  cover  all  fiscal  operations,  including  those  of  extra-budgetary  funds, \nand  also  consolidate  the  accounting  and  reporting  functions  of  all  fiscal  operations.  The \ninitiatives  taken  by  the  Government  since  2000  have  established  a  sound  basis  for \nadvancement of PFM reform and provided a good opportunity for ADB to support the reform.  \n \n\n3. \n\nADB Strategy \n\nThe Board endorsed ADB\u2019s CSP  for Uzbekistan (2006\u20132010) in March 2006,5 calling for \n30. \ncontinued support for the country\u2019s transition toward a marked-based economy. The CSP seeks \nto be increase ADB\u2019s results orientation and proposes to focus ADB\u2019s operations on four priority \nareas:  (i)  acceleration  of  rural  development,  (ii)  private  sector  development,  (iii)  promotion  of \nregional cooperation, and (iv) improvement of human capital and the quality of basic education. \nIn  addition,  the  CSP  attaches  great  importance  to  good  governance  in  all  ADB\u2019s  operations  in \nthe country.  \n \nThe  proposed  Project  is  in  line  with  the  essence  of  the  CSP to  support  the  country\u2019s \n31. \ntransition \nimproving \nto  a  market-based  economy  and  promote  good  governance  by \ntransparency  and accountability  in  budget  management.  Although  the  proposed  Project  does \nnot fall into any of the four CSP priority areas, on a broader level it will help the country manage \nits  public  resources  more  effectively.  This  will  have  positive  implications  for  all  public \ninvestments, including those supported  by  ADB. The proposed Project will  also provide a good \nfoundation for future dialogue and cooperation between the authorities and ADB in  the area of \nPFM  reform  over  the  next  10\u201312  years,  and  for  considering  follow-up operations  to  continue \nsupporting the reform, depending on its progress and the country\u2019s needs.  \n \n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n32. \nSince  the  launch of the PFM reform initiative, the Government has received assistance \nfrom a number of  multilateral and bilateral agencies. The French Treasury  and French Ministry \nof  Economy,  Finance  and  Industry  established  an  ongoing  technical  assistance  program  in \n2001,  involving  an  annual  internship  at  the  French  Treasury,  missions  to  Uzbekistan  and  a \nstudy tour to France. The United States Treasury provided a resident budget advisor to assist in \nthe preparation of the revised budget classification in 2003. In addition to sending frequent PFM \nconsultation  missions, IMF  has fielded a resident treasury advisor in Uzbekistan for most of the \ntime  since  2003.  The  Islamic  Development  Bank  has  committed  to  support  the  training  with \nrespect to budget execution and treasury operations. The World Bank carried out a study on the \npublic  expenditure  review  in  2003,  and  subsequently  worked  on  the  preparation  of  a  loan \nproject.6 The Government of Japan provided grant funding for the TA project carried out by the \nWorld Bank in 2005 and by IMF since 2003. \n \n33. \nThe  World  Bank  recently  approved  a  grant-financed  project  that  aims  to  improve  the \ncountry\u2019s capacity in internal and external auditing. The implementation of this project started in \nApril  2007  and  is  expected  to  take  about  10  months  to  complete.  The  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme  (UNDP)  has  recently  begun  implementing  a  3-year project to assist \nthe Government in tax reforms, further development of an MTBF and pilot program budgeting. \n                                                 \n5   ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program Uzbekistan 2006\u20142010. Manila. \n6   The  World  Bank  provided  significant  support  to  the  PFM  reform  and  has  continued  its  support  in  the  area  of \ninternal  and  external  audit.  At  present,  the  World  Bank\u2019s  interim  strategy,  adopted  in  mid-2006,  focuses  its \nassistance on provision of advisory services and selected lending in social sectors. \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\n \n34. \nThe  European  Union\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent \nStates (TACIS) program began funding technical assistance in 2002, and the work is ongoing. It \nhas provided  (i)  budget  advisers to assist with the  development  of  the  MTFF  and  introductory \nwork on an MTBF and pilot program budgeting, (ii) treasury and human resources management \nadvisers  on  the  functional  and  institutional  aspects  of  the  treasury  system,  and  (iii)  a \ncommitment  to  funding  the  development  of  a  treasury  training  facility.  Most  of  the  TACIS\u2019s \nongoing assistance is expected to  be  complete  by  the  end of  2007.  In  addition,  the  TACIS  is \ndiscussing  with  the  Government  a  possible  future  assistance  program,  mainly  in  building  the \ncountry\u2019s  capacity  in  PFM reform  implementation.  At  this  stage,  the  results  of  discussions are \nunclear.  \n \n35. \nThe need for  a  TA  project  remains large  given the  complex nature  of the  PFM  reform \nand the time required  for implementation.  In the short term, the need to  improve the country\u2019s \ncapacity  for  budget  preparation  and  execution  using  the  revised  budget  classification  is \nparticularly acute. During the preparation of the Project, ADB worked closely with IMF\u2019s resident \nadvisor,  and  collaborated  with  TACIS  and  other  agencies.  Major  external  assistance  to  the \nsector is detailed in Appendix  4. \n \n\n5. \n\nLessons \n\n36. \nStudies  by  ADB,  previous  ADB  projects,  and  World  Bank  treasury  projects  in  other \ncountries  highlighted  the  following  lessons,  which  were  considered  during  the  design  of  the \nproposed Project. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nGovernment  commitment  to  ownership  of  PFM  reform.  The  Government  is \ncommitted to PFM reform; as noted earlier, it initiated the reform process in 2000. \nSince then the reform has advanced steadily with external assistance and its own \ninitiatives. The  Presidential  Resolution  issued  in  February  2007,  and  the  PFM \nreform strategy prepared by MOF in  May 2007, have indicated the Government\u2019s \ncontinued strong commitment to the reform.   \n\nClear  MOF  ownership  of  the  project  design. The World Bank\u2019s experience of \ntreasury  reforms  in  the  Central  Asia  region  indicates  the  importance  of  careful \nproject preparation that ensures  clear  understanding  and  ownership  of  the  final \nproject design by  the implementing agency. During the  project preparation, ADB \nmissions  discussed  various  aspects  of  the  Project  and  reached  an  agreement \nwith  MOF  on  its  objective,  scope  and  implementation  arrangements.  MOF \nworked  intensively  to  form  its  own  views  on  the  output  of  the  Project  and \nassociated critical milestones and performance indicators.  \n\nComplementary TA to support  the required capacity building. Previous ADB \nprojects  indicate  the  need  to  ensure  sufficient  TA  resources  are  available  for \ncapacity  building  because  of  the  complexity  and  iterative  nature  of  reform \nimplementation.  ADB\u2019s special studies on its public expenditure management TA \nprojects  for  selected  countries  and  TA  projects  for  Kazakhstan  and  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  both  carried  out  by  the  Operations  Evaluation  Department,  indicated \nthat (a) capacity building is a long-term task and needs long-term TA, and (b) TA \nprojects should be designed with considerable understanding of the existing local \ncapacity,  gaps, and constraints to ensure it takes into account the context rather \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n  \n\n \n \n\nthan  addresses  the  issues  separately  and  ineffectively.  Partly  based  on  these \nlessons, complementary TA is included as an integral part of the Project. The TA \nwill be implemented within  2 years and will focus on addressing identified  gaps \nand  immediate  needs  in  budget  preparation  and  execution  using  the  revised \nbudget classification. While the TA does not intend, and will not be able, to meet \nall  the  capacity-building  requirements,  it  is  designed  to  complement  other \nongoing  TA  projects supported by  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies.  It  is \nalso  designed  to  leave  plenty  of  room  for  future  possible  assistance  by  other \ndevelopment  partners.  If  necessary,  ADB  can  consider  providing  additional \ncapacity-building  support  from  its  future  operation  program, as  it  will continue to \nconsult with authorities on progress in PFM reform  implementation.       \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\n37. \nThe  project  impact  will be  improved  planning  and  utilization  of  public  resources.  The \nproject outcome will  be  improved  effectiveness,  efficiency,  transparency,  and  accountability  of \nbudget execution processes. The project impact and  outcome will be monitored  and measured \nmainly by the performance indicators as described earlier  (paras. 9\u201310) and in  the design and \nmonitoring framework in Appendix 1.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs and Components \n\n38. \nProject  outputs  will  comprise  (i)  establishment  of  a  modern  Treasury with a nationwide \nnetwork  of  treasury  offices  servicing  budget  organizations  of  national  and  subnational \ngovernments  and  revenue  collection  agencies,  and  development  of  a  functioning  GFMIS  to \nfacilitate  treasury  operations;  (ii)  consolidated  and  streamlined  treasury  banking  operations \nunder the established TSA; (iii) creation of a central accounting system using a  unified  COA  in \nline  with  the  revised  budget  classification,  the  GFSM  2001  and  IPSAS;   (iv)  a  refined  legal \nframework; and (v) application of the revised budget classification to the budget preparation and \nexecution with improved pilot program budgeting in selected sectors. \n \n39. \nThe  Project  will  have  three  components:  (i)  establishment  of  a  nationwide  institutional \nnetwork  of  treasury  offices  and  support  for  capacity  building;  (ii)  modernization  of  treasury \noperations; and (iii) project management, monitoring, and evaluation. \n \n\n1. \n\nEstablishment  of  a  Nationwide  Institutional  Network  of  Treasury  Offices \nand Support for Capacity Building  \n\n40. \nThis component will provide assistance for the establishment of a nationwide institutional \nnetwork of  treasury offices  and  associated  capacity  building  in  areas  where  gaps  have  been \nidentified  and  the  needs  are  acute.    In  particular,  the capacity building will  include  support  to \nbuild  MOF\u2019s  capacity  in  the  maintenance  of  the  GFMIS  and  management  of  associated \ndatabases. \n \n41. \nThis  component  will  include  two  subcomponents,   the  first  being  the  refurbishment  of \ntreasury offices. These treasury offices at regional and district levels will be  established prior to \nthe introduction of the GFMIS. The Government  will  finance the refurbishment  in  two  phases, \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nwith  $5.8  million  during  2008  and  $4.2  million  during  2009,  out  of  its  own  resources  and  in \naccordance with its procurement procedures. \n \nThe second subcomponent will provide specialized training and certification for about 10 \n42. \nIT specialists from MOF in the GFMIS maintenance and associated database management. The \ntraining  aspects  will  include  (i)  database  administration, (ii)  operational  systems  engineering, \nand  (iii)  network  technology  engineering.  This  training  will  be  provided  by  a  specialized  IT \ncertification  company  for  the  following  reasons:  (i)  the  training  will  be  completed  before  the \nselection of the GFMIS vendor7 to build the capacity of  treasury staff in the transition to a new \ntreasury  system  and  to  coordinate  with  the  GFMIS  vendor  during  the  software  design  and \ndevelopment  phase,  and  (ii)  there  is  a  risk  that  the  GFMIS  vendor  may  not  be  able  to  provide \ntraining  on  all  aspects  required  by  MOF.  The  GFMIS  vendor  will  be  responsible  for  providing \nhands-on training  for  GFMIS  functions,  operation  and  maintenance.  Therefore,  the  IT  training \nand  certification  will be provided  during  the  first  year  of  project  implementation  in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time), under a \ncontract between the PMO  and an authorized  IT certification company engaged on the basis of \nconsultant\u2019s qualifications selection method.  \n\n2. \n\nModernization of Treasury Operations \n\n43. \nThis component will comprise development and implementation of a GFMIS. The GFMIS \nwill include six procurement packages, outlined below. Treasury functions, GFMIS functionality \nand technical requirements are available on request as a supplementary appendix.  \n \n44. \nPackage 1: Development and implementation of GFMIS software. This includes the \nfollowing  elements:  (i)  supply  of  an  integrated  software  package;  (ii)  setting the  parameters  of \nthe package according to MOF\u2019s specific requirements; (iii) development of integration modules \nfor  data  exchange  with  other  organizations,  including  as  CBU,  commercial  banks,  State \nTaxation  Committee  and  State  Customs  Committee;  (iv)  development  of  user  documentation \nand training modules in local languages; (v) installation, testing and deployment of the GFMIS in \nall  treasury  locations;  (vi)  training  of  treasury  staff  in  use  of  the  GFMIS;  and  (vii)  technical \ntraining of MOF and treasury IT staff to enable them to support the GFMIS. Procurement of this \npackage will commence as soon as possible after loan effectiveness. \n \n45. \nPackage 2:  Supply of  Main  Servers. This procurement covers the supply, installation, \ncommissioning and support of the main server hardware and data storage equipment required \nto  operate  the  GFMIS  application  in  the  main  treasury computer center in Tashkent, plus  the \nsupply of a  set of equipment in a back-up  computer  center. These sites will be linked by high- \nspeed data lines and connected to the full treasury network. \n \n46. \nAs  the  technical  specifications  of  these  items  will  be  dependent  on  the  design  and \nspecification  of  the  GFMIS  software  to  be  procured  in  package  1,  the  bidding  documents  for \npackage 2 will be finalized in consultation with the contractor for package 1.  It  will be important \nto  gain  contractual  assurance  from  vendors  that  all  elements  (both  software  and  hardware)  of \nthe  GFMIS  will  meet  the  performance  requirements  of  the  Project.  The  contracts  for  both \npackage 1 and package 2 will take this into consideration.  \n \n\n                                                 \n7  The GFMIS vendor is expected to be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s two-stage: two-envelope procedure at the \n\nend of the first year of project implementation. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n \n\n47. \nPackage 3: Supply of Computers and Networking Equipment for Treasury Offices. \nThe establishment of treasury offices throughout Uzbekistan is proceeding rapidly and there is \nan  urgent  need  to  procure  IT  equipment  at  an  early  stage  of  treasury  development.  This \npackage covers the procurement of 580 computers, printers, related local servers and electronic \nsecurity facilities for these offices. These items will be  used initially for standard office functions \nand  to  access  MOF\u2019s  interim  \u201cTreasury  One\u201d  software  system,  and  will  subsequently  be \navailable for use with the GFMIS.  \n \n48. \nPackage  4:  Further  Computers  and  Networking  Equipment  for  Treasury  Offices. \nUnder  this  package  a  further  1,048  computers  (including  uninterruptible  power  supplies  and \noffice software) will be procured to fully equip oblast and rayon level treasury offices by the time \npiloting of the GFMIS application is ready to proceed. \n \n49. \nPackage 5: Supply of Telecommunication Networking Equipment. This procurement \npackage  covers  the  networking  equipment  (including  routers,  firewalls, and  internet  telephony \ndevices) required to interconnect all treasury locations. \n \n50. \nPackage  6:  Local  Support  Systems.  This procurement  package  covers  supply  and \ninstallation  of  cabling,  local  area  network  switches,  telecommunications  cabling,  uninterruptible \npower supplies,  fiber-optic  connections,  alarm  and  monitoring  systems, and fire detection and \nsuppression equipment. \n\n \nProcurement  of  these  six  packages  will  be  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  and  will  be \n\n51. \nprocured through international competitive bidding (ICB).  \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n\nThis  component  will  comprise  establishment  of  a  PMO  under  MOF  to  manage  day-to-\n52. \nday  project  operations.  MOF  will  appoint  (i)  a  full-time  project  manager;  (ii)  specialists  in \nfinancial management, procurement, treasury and  IT; and (iii) support staff with experience and \nqualifications acceptable to ADB.  The  PMO  will  work  in  close  cooperation  with  MOF,  treasury, \nand its offices at central and local levels. \n \nC. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe total cost of the  Project  is  estimated  at  $37.36  million.  The  cost  estimates  include \n53. \n$3.95  million  for  taxes  and  duties,  $1.28  million  for  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and \nestimated  financing  charges  during  implementation  (comprising  interest  during  implementation \nand a commitment charge) of $2.61 million.

The  Deputy  Finance  Minister \n(who also is the Head of Treasury) will act as the project director and will oversee overall project \nimplementation.   The  PMO,  headed  by  a  full-time  project  manager  nominated  by  MOF,  will \nmanage  daily  project  activities.  The  PMO  will  comprise  full-time  financial  management, \nprocurement,  treasury,  and  accounting  specialists.  All  PMO  staff  will  have  experience  and \nqualifications  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  PMO  will  regularly  report  to  the  Head of  Treasury  and \nADB.  A project steering committee (PSC), comprising senior staff of  MOF, CBU, MOE, Ministry \nof  Foreign  Economic  Relations,  Investment  and  Trade,  State  Tax  Committee,  State  Customs \nCommittee,  and  other  government  agencies  will  be  formed  to  provide  policy  guidance  in \nimplementing  the  project  and  monitoring  the  project  impact.  The  PSC  will  be  formed  prior  to \nloan effectiveness. The management organization chart is given in Appendix 6. \n\n \n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n56. \nThe Project will be implemented over  a period of  4 years. Project activities will  include \nthe  selection  of  a  vendor  for  development  and  installation  of  the  GFMIS,  procurement  of \nhardware  and  networking  equipment,  and  development  and  implementation  of  a  project \nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  The  training  and  capacity-building component \nwill be implemented in line with the progress in development and implementation of the GFMIS. \nThe project implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 7. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nGoods and services will be procured in accordance with  ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n57. \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Before  loan  negotiations,  the  Borrower  will  furnish  for \nADB  approval  a  project  procurement  plan.  The  Government  shall  implement  the  procurement \nplan as approved by ADB, and shall update the procurement plan annually, or as needed. ADB \nwill disclose the plan and its updates to the public after the approval of related financing. Major \ncontracts for IT software and equipment costing $0.5 million equivalent or more will be awarded \nthrough  ICB.  Shopping  procedure  will  be  used  for  contracts  valued  at  $100,000  equivalent  or \nless. For the procurement of items below $10,000,  MOF  may  purchase  the  items  directly  from \nthe supplier. In such cases, ADB should be satisfied that the price paid is reasonable.  \n \n58. \nAll  goods  and  services  financed  by  the  loan  shall  be  procured  from  ADB  member \ncountries.  In  addition,  where  the  value  of  goods  financed  by  the  loan  exceeds  $1  million,  a \npreshipment  certificate  from  a  reputable  agency  acceptable  to  ADB  may  be  required.  The \nawarding of all contracts and substantial contract variations will be subject to prior approval by \nADB. The project procurement plan is in Appendix  8.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n59. \nAbout  10  IT  specialists  from  MOF  will  be  trained  in  the  following  areas:  (i)  database \nadministration,  (ii)  operational  systems  engineering,  and  (iii)  network  technology  engineering. \nThe  training  and  certification  will  be  provided  during the first year of project implementation  in \naccordance with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\ntime), under a contract between the PMO and an authorized IT certification company engaged \non the basis of consultant\u2019s qualifications selection method.  \n \nAn  international  IT  and  procurement  consultant  will  assist  the  PMO  in  conducting  ICB \n60. \nprocurements  of \nthe  various  GFMIS  components,  in  particular  the  development  and \nimplementation  of  software  (procurement  package  1).  MOF  will  engage  an  international \nconsultant in accordance with  ADB procedures for recruiting individual consultants.  The outline \nterms of reference for the consultant are given in Appendix 9. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \nThe proceeds of the ADB loan will be disbursed according to  ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \n61. \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  For  consulting  services  and  equipment \ncontracts awarded following ICB procedures, loan funds will be disbursed using direct payment. \nFor  contracts  awarded  on  the  basis  of  shopping,  direct  contracting,  and  small  operational \nexpenditures  of  the  PMO,  statement  of  expenditure  and  imprest  account  procedures  will  be \nused.  An  imprest  account  will  be  established  in  a  bank  in  Uzbekistan  acceptable  to  ADB,  for \nexclusive  use  of  the  Project.  The  initial  and  total  amounts  of  advance  are  not  to  exceed  the \nestimated ADB share of eligible project expenditures to be financed through the imprest account \nfor  the  next  6  months,  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  For  simplified \ndocumentation,  the  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  may  be  used  to  reimburse  and \nliquidate  advances  made  into  the  imprest  account  for  eligible  expenditures  with  individual \ncontracts of $100,000 or less. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n62. \nMOF  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  financial  statements,  in  accordance \nwith  the  provisions  of  the  Loan  Agreement  and  ADB  Guidelines8 and  will  have  them  audited \nannually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  During  project  implementation,  within  6 \nmonths  of  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year,  MOF  will  submit  to  ADB  certified  copies  of  the  annual \naudited  project  accounts  and  financial  statements,  as  well  as  the  auditor\u2019s  report,  which  will \ninclude  a  separate  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditures, \nand management letter, all in English.  MOF  has been advised of ADB\u2019s requirement for timely \nsubmission  of  audited  project  accounts  and  financial  statements,  and  the  suspension  of \ndisbursements of the ADB loan in case of noncompliance.  \n \n63. \nMOF,  through  the  PMO,  will  submit  quarterly  and  annual  reports  to  ADB,  indicating \nprogress made, problems encountered, and steps taken to remedy the problems, a program of \nactivities,  and  expected  progress  during  the  remaining  implementation  period.  The  reports  will \nincorporate  the  project  performance  monitoring  data  and  all  relevant  financial  data.  MOF  will \nalso  provide  reports  and  information  relating  to  the  Project  as  ADB  may  reasonably  request. \nWithin  3 months after project completion,  MOF  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report \ndetailing information on project implementation, use of the loan proceeds, and accomplishment \nof the project objectives.  \n \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2002.

A \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  unit  will  be  established  under  the  PMO.  The  PMO  manager  and \nfinancial  management  specialist  will  have  primary  responsibility \nfor  monitoring  project \nimplementation  progress  and  will  provide  regular  reports  to  MOF  and  ADB.  The  monitoring \nindicators in the project design and monitoring framework will form the core of the data required \nfor assessment. For periodic monitoring, key indicators will be confirmed at project inception by \nMOF, and baseline data will be incorporated into the system focusing on outcomes and outputs \nconsistent  with  existing  international  and  local  reporting  standards,  and  the project framework. \nWithin  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  PMO  will  develop  a  gender  action  plan  and  will \nensure  its  implementation  in  a  timely  manner  over  the  project  period.  The  plan  will  ensure \neffective involvement of women in the implementation,  monitoring and evaluation of the Project. \nGender-related indicators will be included in  the project performance  monitoring and evaluation \nsystem  and  reported  to  ADB  twice  a  year.  In  addition,  project  implementation  arrangements, \nincluding  capacity-development  activities,  will  be  monitored  during  the  annual  country  portfolio \nreview exercise. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n65. \nThe Government and ADB will jointly review implementation of the Project at least once \na  year.  After  2  years  of  implementation,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  jointly  carry  out  a \nmidterm  review  of  the  Project  to  identify  any  problems  or  constraints  encountered  and  assess \nthe need for modification of project scope, implementation, and financing arrangements. Project \nobjectives  will  be  measured  against  the  performance  criteria  agreed  by  the  Government  and \nADB.  The  parameters \n(i) \nimplementation  status,  (ii)  GFMIS  functionality  and  quality,  (iii)  physical  progress  and \ndisbursements  related  to  the  implementation  schedule,  (iv)  status  of  compliance  with  loan \ncovenants,  (v)  achievement  of  the  Project\u2019s  development  objectives,  (vi)  progress  of  policy \nreforms, and (vii) the need for any changes in the project scope to achieve project impact. On \ncompletion, the Project will be evaluated according to a schedule and terms of reference to be \nagreed upon by the Government and ADB.  \n \n\nimplementation  milestones  will \n\nfor  assessing \n\ninclude \n\nthe \n\n9. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n66. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability, and \ntransparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine the records and accounts of MOF and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  The  Government  shall  undertake  necessary \nmeasures  to  publicly  disclose  Project-related  procurement  actions  such  as  information  on \nadopted  bidding  procedures,  specifications  of  goods,  works  and  consulting  services, \nparticipating bidders, and awarding of contracts. \n \n\n\fIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n\n15 \n\nA grant TA project of up to $600,000  will be provided as an integral part of the Project, \n\n67. \nmainly to meet the immediate needs for capacity building in implementing the PFM reform.  \n\n68. \nThe impact of the TA project will be improved budget preparation and execution under a \nbudget classification  system  consistent  with  international  best  practices, and improved linkage \nbetween  budgeting  and  policy  objectives  and  investment  programs.  The  outcome  of  the  TA \nproject  will  be  strengthened  capacity  of  the  Government  in  budget  preparation  and  execution \nusing the revised budget classification. The TA project is to address immediate capacity-building \nneeds  and  focus  on  the  areas  not  covered  by  other  donors  either now  or  in  the  near  future. \nWhile the TA project will aim to have a nationwide impact, its training program  will pay special \nattention  to  strengthening  the  capacity  of  relevant  staff  from  MOF\u2019s  Treasury,  local  treasury \noffices, Budget Department, MOE, and line ministries selected for pilot program budgeting.  \n \nThe  TA  project  will  have  two  components:  (i)  support  for  budget  preparation,  and  (ii) \n69. \nsupport  for  budget  execution  through  treasury  operations  using  the  GFMIS.  The  TA  project \noutputs  will  comprise  (i)  development  of  user  manuals  on  budget  preparation  and  treasury \noperation  under  the  revised  budget  classification;  (ii)  development  of  training  modules  and \nmaterials  in  budget  preparation  and  execution  using  the  revised  budget  classification;  (iii) \ndevelopment of performance indicators for the education sector; and (iv) training of 17 staff from \nMOF  Treasury,  Budget  Department,  and  Treasury  Training  Center  on  budget  preparation  and \nbudget execution based on the revised budget classification. \n \n70. \nThe TA project is estimated to cost $720,000. ADB will provide a grant of $600,000 from \nits TA  funding  program.  The  Government  will  finance  the  balance  of  $120,000  through  in-kind \ncontributions for office accommodation, logistical support, local travel, and counterpart staff.  \n \n71. \nThe  TA  project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  24  months,  starting  in  January \n2008.  MOF  will  be  the  EA  for  the  TA  project.  MOF  Budget  Department  will  be  the  main \ncounterpart for budget preparation activities while the  Treasury will coordinate budget execution \nactivities. The  TA  project  will  require  24  person-months  of  international  and  48  person-months \nof  national  consultants  with  the  following  expertise:  (i)  performance-based  budget  preparation, \nand  (ii)  budget  execution  through  treasury  operation.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  and \nengaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB  procedures  for  recruiting  individual  consultants. \nRecruitment of consultants on an individual basis is justified on the following grounds: (i) there is \na  clear  distinction  between  the  tasks  of  budget  preparation  consultants  and  budget execution \nconsultants, as their outputs can be achieved independently and will not require a team effort or \nfirm  supervision;  and  (ii)  the  specific  nature  of  proposed  consultancy  inputs  assumes  good \nunderstanding  of  the  treasury  and  budget  execution  functions  and  familiarity  with  the  local \nenvironment.  To  facilitate  the  work  of  national  consultants  and  communication  with  MOF \nTreasury and Budget Department, the  international consultants will procure office equipment in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Upon \ncompletion of the TA project this equipment will be passed to MOF. The consultants will interact \nclosely  with  staff  of  MOF,  Treasury,  the  PMO  for  the  loan  project,  as  well  as  with  the \ninternational  donor  community  active  in  this  area.  Detailed  TA  project  description  and  cost \nestimates are in Appendix 10. \n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses \n\n72. \nThe  main  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  are  indirect  and  will  be  reflected  in  (i) \nimproved  budget  quality,  (ii)  budget  execution  efficiency and  linkage  between  budgeting  and \npolicy  objectives  as  well  as  program  outcomes,  (iii)  greater  transparency  and  accountability  in \nPFM underpinned by the established treasury institutional network and modern treasury system, \nand (iv) progress in the  introduction of the MTBF and program budgeting.  The direct economic \nbenefits of the Project are the savings derived from better cash management and thus reduced \ninterest payments. \n\n73. \nThe  beneficiaries  of the Project include  (i)  policy  makers  and  institutions  who,  with  the \nhelp of the modern treasury, will be able to make decisions and, if necessary, fiscal adjustments \nbased on  the  timely  availability of  better-classified  information;  (ii)  stakeholders,  including  the \ngeneral public and parliament, who will be able to better assess and monitor the effect of public \nfinance management; and (iii) the general public, which will benefit from the provision of public \ngoods and services that are facilitated by improved payment and budget execution processes. \n \nB. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement, Indigenous People, and Environmental Assessment  \n\n74. \nThe Project is not expected to  cause direct or indirect involuntary resettlements, nor  will \nit  lead  to  any  issues  affecting  indigenous  people  as  no  project  activities  would  imply \nresettlement  of  people  from  their  traditional  habitations.  It  is  anticipated  that  the  proposed  civil \nworks  will  not  trigger  ADB's  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy.9 Based  on  the  discussions  with \nMOF,  it  was  confirmed  that  all  civil  works related to  the  refurbishment of treasury offices and \ndevelopment  of  local  area  networking  will  be  carried  out  in  strict  compliance  with  applicable \nlocal legislation and will be subject to environmental  monitoring by an authorized environmental \nagency.  Thus,  it  is  anticipated  that  the  Project  is  unlikely  to  have  any  significant  adverse \nenvironmental impacts. \n \nC. \n\nRisk Assessment  \n\n75. \nThe Government\u2019s continued commitment to, and ownership of, the PFM reform process \nwill be  crucial  to  the  Project\u2019s  success,  and  to the  achievement of  the intended  outcome and \nimpact. This is  especially  true  with  further  advancement of the reforms in  MTBF  and  program \nbudgeting.  It  is  recognized  that  this  is  a  long-term,  complex  task  and  a  sometimes  iterative \nprocess.  It  will  require  institutional  changes  and  capacity  building  of  relevant  institutions, \nespecially  in  formulation  of  sector  policies  and  development  of  performance  indicators  to \nmeasure and monitor the effect of the reform. Currently the Government is receiving assistance \nin  this  area  from  UNDP  and  TACIS.  As  yet  it  is  unclear  whether  this  assistance  will  be \nadequate, as new needs may evolve. In any case, this will be one of the main areas for future \ndialogue  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  Depending  on  the  country\u2019s  needs  and  the \nimplementation  of other development-partner programs in capacity building,  ADB will design its \nfuture program in this area accordingly. \n  \n \n\n                                                 \n9 ADB. 1995.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\n76. \nAnother  risk  is  that  staff  assigned  to  the  newly  established  treasury  offices  will  be  \ninadequately skilled, and that the Government will not be able to retain trained staff. To mitigate \nthese risks, a  targeted  training program is planned.  It  will  be  carefully sequenced in line with \nprogress in the development and implementation of the GFMIS, and will include provisions that \nwill help prevent the loss of key trained staff.  \n \n77. \nFrequent turnover of PMO staff is a potential risk. ADB will work with the Government to \nminimize staff turnover in the PMO and ensure  the  PMO  is equipped  with  competent,  full-time \nstaff. \n \n78. \nEffective coordination with development partners will be important to meet the country\u2019s \nlong-term  needs  for  capacity  building.  Such  coordination  during  the  project  preparation  stage \nhas been very good, and  ADB will  maintain close cooperation. The fact that  ADB\u2019s Uzbekistan \nresident mission is leading the project preparation and implementation will help the coordination.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nTo  ensure  the  achievement  of  the  intended  impact  and  outcome,  the following specific \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n79. \nassurances will be reflected in the loan agreements.  \n \n\n1. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Framework \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nThe  Government  will  initiate  actions  to  improve  the  BSL  and Treasury  Law and \nthe MOF will prepare draft amendments by January 2008 for review by all other \ngovernment agencies.  \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure \nimplementing  rules  and \nregulations  on  budget  preparation  and  execution  are  adopted  or  revised  in \ncompliance  with  the  BSL  and  Treasury  Law  or  their  successor  law(s)  prior  to \nimplementation of the revised budget classification and new COA. \n\nthat  all  necessary \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Capacity \n\n(i) \n\nThe Government will ensure that  a nationwide network  of treasury offices  under \ndirect subordination of MOF is established by January 2008. \n\n3. \n\nRevised Budget Classification \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  revised  budget  classification  based  on  the \nGFSM 2001 classification structure is approved during 2007. \n\nThe Government will ensure that all staff in budget organizations and MOF who \nare  engaged  in  budget  preparation  have  completed  training  on  the  revised \nbudget classification during 2008. \n\nThe Government will ensure that all staff in budget organizations and MOF who \nare engaged in budget execution have completed training on the revised budget \nclassification and unified COA during 2008. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  Government  will  endeavor  to  introduce  the  new  budget  classification  by \nJanuary 2009 but in any case prior to full implementation of the GFMIS.  \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  unified  COA  (consistent  with  the  revised \nbudget classification and IPSAS) that has been approved by MOF and registered \nby the Ministry of Justice will be included in the bidding documents for the GFMIS \nand  will  ensure  that  an  instruction  on  accounting  entries  using  the  COA  will be \napproved by January 2008. \n\n4. \n\nBudget Coverage \n\nThe  Government  will  take  necessary  steps  to  progressively  cover  and  include \nextra-budgetary  revenues  and  expenditures  of  all  budgetary  organizations  in \npreparing and reporting the budget. \n\nBy not later than January 2009, the Government will establish an interministerial \ntaskforce comprising representatives of MOF, MOE and other relevant agencies \nwith  a  mandate  to  review  and  develop  appropriate  business  processes  for \nreporting  expenditures  on  externally  financed  investment  projects  to  MOF  for \ntheir integration into budget and treasury accounting. \n\nThe Government  shall ensure that its Cabinet of Ministers undertakes necessary \nmeasures  so  that  parliamentary  appropriation  progressively  covers  extra-\nbudgetary funds of budget organizations. \n\n5. \n\nBanking Operations \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Treasury  bank  account  for  the  Republican \nbudget  established  in  March  2007,  will  cover  all  treasury  operations  of  the \nRepublican budget by January 2008, and that the  TSA will be established by the \ntime the GFMIS is fully operational. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  all  extra-budgetary  accounts  of  budget \norganizations at commercial banks are progressively closed and are consolidated \nunder treasury bank accounts. \n\n6. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  none  of  the  project  components,  activities  or \ncivil works  will  entail  any  land  acquisition,  conversion, donation or restrictions of \naccess that will trigger ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy. \n\nConditions for Disbursement \n\nB. \n \n80. \nAs a condition for loan disbursement, the Government will issue a government resolution \nestablishing the PSC (as referred to in para. 55) and the PMO, and the latter will be staffed and \nbecome operational in a manner satisfactory to ADB. \n \n\n\fVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n\n19 \n\n81. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  $20.70 \nmillion  to  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  Public  Finance  Management  Reform  Project from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;

This  has \nsupported  the  unification  of  exchange  rates  and  the  formal  introduction  of  convertibility  in \nOctober 2003, which has removed one of the main obstacles to private investment. There has \nalso been a policy of  progressively  hardening  budget  constraints  for  state  enterprises,  through \nmeasures  such  as  the  use  of  energy  and  utility  tariff  increases,  mandatory  prepayments  for \npower and gas consumers, and stronger efforts to boost collection. As a result, the quasi fiscal \ndeficit in the energy sector has been significantly reduced, although tariff adjustments have also \nbegun to adversely affect lower-income groups, particularly in urban areas.  \n \n2. \nimprovement.  Government \nexpenditure  had  been  reduced  from  about  45% of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  1998  to \nabout 32% in 2006, and fiscal deficits had been eliminated by 2006 after having reached 10% in \n1998-99.  \n \nConsistent with tighter fiscal policy, real-exchange-rate devaluation in the period leading \n3. \nup  to  the  unification  of  the  exchange  rates,  and  continued  administrative  restrictions  against \nimports,  the  external  balance  has  improved  significantly  over  the  past  3  years.  The  current \naccount moved from a position of small deficits in the late 1990s to a surplus of 19.5% of GDP \nin  2006,  and  reserves  have  risen  since  2001  to  reach  about  the  equivalent  of  12  months  of \nimports in 2006. High prices for Uzbekistan\u2019s two key export commodities, cotton and gold, have \nsupported this turnaround, as have rising gas exports to the Russian Federation. Following real-\nexchange-rate  depreciation  over  the  period  2000\u20132002,  the  ratio  of  external  debt  to  GDP  has \ndeclined significantly. Provided that the current tight external borrowing policies are maintained, \nthe  debt-to-GDP  ratio  should  decline  to  about  24%  by  the  end  of  the  decade, and  the  debt-\nservice-to-exports  ratio  to  about  10%.  Nonetheless,  the  economic  growth  recorded  in  recent \nyears  has  not  been  sufficient  to  improve  the  economic  welfare  of  much  of  the  population  with \nlow incomes.  \n \nB.  \n \nThe authorities recognize that there are serious weaknesses in budget preparation and \n4. \nexecution  in  Uzbekistan.  These  are  common  to  all  countries  that  inherited  their public finance \nmanagement systems from the former Soviet Union.  \n \n \n \n5. \nLack  of  Medium-Term  Perspectives  and  Weak  Links with  Policy  Objectives: The \nGovernment has been conscious of the weaknesses in the preparation of annual budgets. Most \nfiscal  decisions  in  Uzbekistan  are  taken  within  the  tight  time  constraints  of  the  annual budget \ncalendar.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  receives  budget  requests  from  13 ministries,  more \nthan 180 independent agencies of the  state  budget  as  well  as  the 14 regions  that  consolidate \nthe  budget  request  of  213  rayons  (districts).  The  Cabinet  of  Ministers  indicates  areas  of \nparticular priority, such as education, at the beginning of the budget preparation process. MOF \nreviews  the  budget  requests  in  terms  of  their  consistency  with  current  regulations,  and  applies \n\nPublic Finance Management \n\nBudget Preparation \n\n1. \n\n \n \n \n\n\f24          Appendix 2 \n\ncuts  mainly  to  the  fourth  category  of  expenditure,10  which  often  leads  to  a  lack  of  funds  for \nmaintenance  and  current  supplies.  However,  the  available  time  and  data  do  not  give  MOF  the \nopportunity  to  undertake  in-depth  analysis  of  the  links  between  proposed  or  existing  economic \npolicies and the state budget scenarios.  \n \nUntil recently the budget has also suffered from lack of a medium-term perspective, such \n6. \nas the preparation of a  macroeconomic framework that would project important macroeconomic \nvariables\u2014including  GDP,  balance  of  payments,  inflation,  and  interest  rates\u2014over  a  3\u20135-year \nperiod.  Such  a  macroeconomic  framework  would  form  the  basis  for  more  reliable  revenue \nestimates.  In  combination  with  the  government\u2019s  deficit  target,  the  revenue  estimates  would \nimpose an overall spending limit and allow for the establishment of sector spending limits, and a \ncoherent and sustainable aggregate and sector expenditure policy. \n \nFor the top-down approach and sector spending limits to be meaningful and sustainable \n7. \nrather  than  arbitrary  and  transient,  they  need  to  be  combined  with  a  bottom-up  exercise  that \nproperly  costs  and  evaluates  expenditure  programs  and  allocates  scarce  resources  to  those \nthat are most  effective. Currently the budget entities prepare their budget requests on the basis \nof input norms rather than on clear policies and policy objectives linked to defined programs with \nperformance indicators.  \n \n8. \nA  major  step  has  been  taken  to  improve  the  quality  of  budget  by  preparing  a  3-year \nmedium-term  fiscal  framework  (MTFF)  in  accordance  with  the  Interim  Welfare  Improvement \nStrategy  and  Program  (IWISP).  Starting  with  2005,  a  rolling  MTFF  has  been  prepared, \nestablishing  targets  for  revenues  and  expenditures  for  the  next  3  years,  consistent  with  the \nmedium-term projections of GDP, ceilings for the budget deficit and public borrowing, as well as \nwith  other  macroeconomic  parameters.  A  working  group  consisting  of  representatives  of  MOF, \nthe  Ministry  of  Economy  (MOE),  and  CBU  has  developed  projections  of  main  macroeconomic \nparameters,  revenues,  and  expenditures  of  the  state  budget,  and  basic  directions  of  the \nbudgetary  policy  for  2005\u20132007,  laying  the  foundation  for  a  medium-term  budget  framework \n(MTBF) consistent with the MTFF. In the 2005 budget, sector expenditure ceilings were set  for \nthe  first  time.  Work  has  begun  to  formulate  the  budget  on  the  basis  of  programs  and  policy \nobjectives rather than input norms by introducing an experimental program budgeting process in \nselected  ministries.  It  will,  however,  take  some  years  before  this  fundamental  change  in  the \nmode of budget preparation become s comprehensive and systemized.  \n \n9. \nThe  greatest  challenges  for  the  preparation  of  an  MTBF  are  to  (i)  develop  institutional \nmechanisms  to  link  policymaking  to  budgeting,  (ii)  enhance  the  capacity  in  the  formulation  of \neconomic  policies,  and  (iii)  improve  the  quality  and  reliability  of  the  main  economic  data.  The \nMTFF  process,  including  the  process  of  setting  expenditure  ceilings,  is  at  an  early  stage  of \ndevelopment.  It  will  require  considerable  further  enhancement  to  meet  accepted  international \nstandards in medium-term budgeting. \n \n10. \nOutdated  Classification  Structure.  As  there  has  been  a  mixing  of  functional  and \neconomic  categories  in  the  classification,  the  budget  has  been  prepared  using  a  classification \nsystem  that  does  not  have  independent  functional  or  economic  analysis.  Accordingly,  the \nclassification is not in line with the international standard laid down in the International Monetary \nFund\u2019s  (IMF\u2019s)  Government  Finance  Statistics  Manual  (GFSM  2001),  thereby  undermining  the \ndevelopment of a public finance management  (PFM) system that can be benchmarked against \ninternational best practices.  \n \n\n                                                 \n10     Total  expenditure  is  classified  into  four  major  categories:  (i)  social  sphere  expenditure,  (ii)  expenditure  on \n\neconomy, (iii) expenditure on state power and administration, and (iv) other expenditures. \n\n\fAppendix 2         25 \n\n11.  With assistance from the United States Treasury,  IMF, and the French Treasury, in the \nlast 3 years considerable work has been done to prepare a revised classification structure  that \ncorresponds to the GFSM 2001. It is expected the revised budget classification will be approved \nby the end of 2007. \n \nBudget  Coverage  not  Comprehensive.  A  relatively  high  proportion  of  general \n12. \ngovernment  expenditure  is  not  covered  by  the  budget.  As  shown  in  the  table  below, there are \ncurrently 22 extra-budgetary funds not included in the budget, the first five of which  account for \napproximately  26%  of  expenditure,  with  the  pension  fund  alone  accounting  for  18%  of  total \nexpenditure in 2004.  \n \n\nList of Extra-Budgetary Funds \n\n \n\n1.  Pension Fund \n2.  State Unemployment Fund \n3.  Special State Assets Account \n4.  Republic Road Fund \n5.  Fund for Reconstruction and Development \n6.

Rehabilitation Fund \nSource: Ministry of Finance of Uzbekistan  \n \nMost  budget organizations  are  allowed  to  supplement  their  budget  revenues  by  raising \n13. \nadditional  revenues  and retaining  them  in  extra-budgetary  funds.  It  has  been  estimated  that \nthese  extra-budgetary-fund  expenditures  correspond  in  total  to  10%\u201315%  of  budgeted \nexpenditure. In addition, capital and current expenditure financed by external loans or grants is \ncurrently not included in the budget. \n \n14. \nAs  a  result,  the  budget  is  fragmented,  and  integrated  policy  decision  making,  budget \npreparation  and  budget  execution  are  undermined.  The  authorities  recognize  this  problem  and \nare  committed  to  integrating  the  budgetary  system  as  a  fundamental  component  of  improving \nthe  quality  of  the  public  finance  management  system,  and  hence  its  effectiveness  and \nefficiency.  \n \nLack of  Transparency.  Budget documentation, including detailed budget and line-item \n15. \nexpenditures,  as  well  as  planned  policies  regarding  revenue  and  expenditures,  has  not  been \nmade public  until recently.  The authorities have begun publishing summaries of the  approved \n \n \n \n\n\f26          Appendix 2 \n\n2. \n\nBudget Execution \n\nbudgets  since  2004  and  adopting  a  more  detailed  breakdown  of  budget  execution.  They  are \ncommitted to extending the level of detail of budget data to be published in future. \n \n16. \nInstitutional  Weaknesses  Impeding  Budget  Preparation  Reform.  The  lead  agency \nfor the investment budget, responsible for the Public Investment Program (PIP), is not MOF but \nMOE.  Although  MOF  officials  are  involved  in  the  formulation  of  the  PIP  and  all  projects  are \nformally  subject  to  a  process  of  appraisal,  they  are  not  evaluated  together  with  other  public \nresources  being  assigned  to  a  particular  sector,  within  the  sector\u2019s  budgetary  envelope.  In \naddition, key decisions in the PIP are taken outside the formal budget process (for example, a-\npriori  decisions  on  the  number  of  schools  and  hospitals  to  be  constructed).  There  is  minimal \ninvolvement  and  hence  accountability  of  line  ministries  in  investment  budget  preparation  and \nexecution.  \n \nThe  budgetary  preparation  functions  of  MOF  are  distributed  across  a  number  of \n17. \ndepartments  reporting  to  different  deputy  ministers,  who  are  also  responsible  for  functions \nunrelated  to  budget  preparation.  Moreover,  MOF  does  not  have  a  separate  department  for \nmacroeconomic  analysis  and  forecasting,  which  will  be  necessary  for  MOF  to  be  able  to  both \ngive  informed  policy  advice  on  fiscal  policy  and  to  form  a  basis  for  the  development  of  the \nresource envelope for the budget. The authorities recognize these problems and are adopting a \ngradual approach to their resolution.  \n \n \n \nThere  are  thousands  of  bank  accounts  in  use  outside  MOF\u2019s  control,  resulting  in \n18. \nresources  and  poor  payment  control.  Current  organizational \nfragmentation  of  cash \nimpossible.  There  are \narrangements  make  effective  monitoring  of  budget  execution \napproximately 50,000 budget organizations operating over 100,000 of their own bank accounts, \nmostly in commercial banks, for both budgetary and extra-budgetary funds. Line ministries have \nweak  control  over  the  budget  organizations  that  operate  in  their  areas  of  responsibility,  and  \nMOF does not have a full inventory of these accounts. \n \n19. \nThere  is  a  lack  of  segregation  of  duties  between  the  release  of  the  authority  to  spend \nand the release of cash to spending units, with cash being transferred to  budget organizations \nby  crediting  their  bank  accounts.  These  procedures  allow  spending  agencies  to  build  up  idle \ncash balances, thus increasing MOF's gross-borrowing requirement. \n \n20. \nIn principle, budget funds are released to  budget organizations on the basis of monthly \nexpenditure  plans  prepared  after  the  adoption  of  the  budget,  but  to  keep  cash  under  control \nthese  releases  are  not  automatic  and  are  prioritized  by  MOF,  which  issues  a  certificate  to \nauthorize  them.  Cash  management  is  currently  focused  on  the  distribution  of  cash  to  settle \ndifferent categories of payables. Strenuous efforts are made to ensure that wages, salaries and \nsimilar  payments  that  represent  income  to  individuals  are  paid  either  on  time  or  within  a  few \ndays  of  the  due  dates,  including  by  arranging  short-term  loans.  The  situation  has  been \naggravated by CBU\u2019s rationing of cash in the banking system. The result has been that although \nfunds  are  made  available  through  the  banking  system  to  budget  organizations,  these \norganizations are unable to make payments in cash to final recipients. The result has been that, \nparticularly  outside  Tashkent,  arrears  of  two  or  more  months  have  occurred  in  wage  and \npension payments.  \n \nBecause of the multitude of bank accounts and the ways in which they are funded and \n21. \nused, there is no direct coordination of bank balances in order to optimize the application of the \naggregate cash available to MOF. The existence of budget organizations\u2019 extra-budgetary funds \n(with  independent  receipts,  payments  and  bank  accounts)  exacerbates  MOF\u2019s  difficulties  in \n\n\fAppendix 2         27 \n\ntrying  to  optimize  cash  management.  The  authorities  recognize  these  problems  and  are \ncommitted to introducing a comprehensive treasury single account (TSA) system for the general \ngovernment sector and systematic cash planning and management. \n \n22.  Weak  and  Cumbersome  Accounting  and  Reporting.  Budget  organizations,  MOF\u2019s \nfinancial  departments  in  oblasts  and  rayons,  and  line  ministries  financed  directly  from  MOF \nmaintain  their  accounts  in  accordance  with  a  chart  of  accounts  (COA)  prescribed  by  the \ngovernment of the former Soviet Union in 1986. A separate COA is issued to account for such \nperiodic  cash  releases  to  line  ministries  during  the  budget  execution  process.  The  financial \ndepartments in oblasts (regions) and rayons (districts) use yet another COA to account for the \ncash releases made by them to the  budget  organizations  under  their  jurisdiction.  The  CBU,  its \nregional  branches,  and  accredited  commercial  banks  continue  to  record  and  report  on \ngovernment  cash  transactions  in  accordance  with  a  COA  that  captures  major  economic \ncategories  of  expenditure  and  tax  revenues  by  types  of  taxes.  Many  of  the  accounting  and \nreporting operations are performed manually, reducing their timeliness and accuracy.  \n \n23. \nBecause  there  is  no  uniform  COA  for  government  operations  at  different  levels  of \ngovernment, MOF is able to consolidate only the cash account of the central government on a \nregular basis. In order to be able to account for and report transactions, other flows, and stocks, \nbudget organizations  have  to  reference  other  classification  systems.  This  reduces  the  speed \nand  accuracy  of  their  accounting,  including  reconciliation.  The  authorities  recognize  these \nproblems  and  have  approved  a  unified  COA  to  be  used  until  the  new  GFMIS  allows \ncomprehensive and timely accounting and reporting.  \n\n3. \n\nIn  general, \n\ninternational \n\nState of Internal and External Audit \n\ninternal  audit  standards  are  designed \n\n \n \n24. \nThe  Control and Revision Department  in  MOF  and  its territorial divisions in  oblasts are \nresponsible  for  internal  auditing.  Its  current  role  includes  monitoring  compliance  with  budgets \nand  other  financial  legislation  and  regulation,  in  particular  (i)  the  timeliness  and  priority  of \npayments,  (ii)  the  targeted application of expenditures, and  (iii)  the observance of expenditure \nlimits.  Modern  internal  audit  process,  with  its  focus  on  mitigating  risks,  has  a  much  broader \nfocus than this.  \n \nto  complement \n25. \ninternational external audit standards. In Uzbekistan, the Chamber of Accounts was established \nas  the  supreme  audit  institution  in  mid-2002  (revised  in  2005),  but  there  is  no  provision  for \nadherence to international external auditing standards. The Chamber of Accounts reports to the \npresident and  parliament,  but  it  is  not  envisaged  that  its  reports  will  be  published.  It  currently \nhas a staff of  about 20  people  and  it  is  expected  that  this  will  be  increased  to  60.  Much  of  its \nwork  is  carried  out  using  staff  of  the  Control  and  Revision  Department  and  private  auditing \ncompanies. Membership of the Chamber of Accounts board  consists of 13 senior ministers and \nofficials, with only two members from the parliament. \n  \n26.  While steps are needed to strengthen internal audit functioning (starting with MOF) and \nintroduce international internal audit standards, there is also a need to enhance the role of  the \nChamber  of  Accounts  if  it  is  to  function  as  an  effective  external  audit  agency  according  to \ninternational  benchmarks.  Its  institutional  capacity  needs  to  be  substantially  increased  and  its \nindependence from executive needs assured.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f28          Appendix 2 \n\nC. \n\nPublic Finance Management Reform Strategy  \n\n \n27. \nThe  Government  recognizes  the  problems  arising  from  the  fragmented  nature  of  the \nbudget  and  has  assured  that  these  issues  will  be  addressed  under  the  proposed  PFM  reform \ninitiative.  The  PFM  reform  strategy  has been  developed by  MOF  with inputs from  the  Fiscal \nAffairs Department of IMF and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to comprehensively address \nthe modernization issues of budget preparation and budget execution.  A central element of the \nreform is the plan to set up  a modern treasury system to replace the current budget execution \nsystem, which is dependent on the transfer of resources through thousands of bank accounts. \n \n\n1. \n\nLegal Framework \n\n \n28. \nThe Budget System Law, approved in December 2000, provides a basic legal framework \nfor  fiscal  management.  It  sets  out  the  process  of  preparation  of  the  annual  budgets  by  the \nnational  and subnational governments, their consolidation into a  state  budget, and a timetable \nfor  submission  of  budget  documents  and  adoption  of  uniform  functional,  organizational  and \neconomic  classification.  It  also  lays  down  the  parliamentary  authority  for  setting  public  debt \nlimits  and  provisions  for  giving  state  guarantees.  Some  flexibility  is  also  provided  to  the \nexecutive for amending the budget appropriations during execution.  \n \n29. \nIn  August  2004,  the  country  passed  a  law  on  treasury  execution  of  the  state  budget \n(Treasury Law), aimed at creating a central Treasury in MOF to service national and subnational \ngovernment  budget  organizations.  The  main  tasks  of  the  Treasury  provided  for  by  the  law \ninclude (i) control and management of the cash resources of the  state budget, (ii) registration of \ncontracts  of  budget  organizations,  (iii)  accounting  for  all  government  transactions,  (iv)  the \nservicing of public debt, and (v) the execution of national government guarantees. The law also \nauthorized creation of a TSA at the central bank to hold all government cash resources. \n\n \n30. \nThere  was  also  a  decree issued in April 2005  which  had  the  objective of strengthening \nthe organizational activity of the  Chamber  of  Accounts.  The  chamber  was established in 2002 \nfor  external  monitoring  of  execution  of  the  state  budget  and  to  report  on  the  results  to  the \npresident  and  the  two  chambers  of  parliament  (Oliy  Majlis),  thereby  creating  an  external  audit \ninstitution.  However,  the Chamber of Accounts  comprises  13  senior  ministers  and  government \nofficials  with  only  one  member  being  drawn  from  each  house  of  the  parliament, and  so  has \nlimited institutional support. \n \n31. \nReview of  Statutory  Framework.  The  Government  recognizes  the  need  for  review  of \nthe  existing  legislation  on  budget  preparation,  external  audit,  and  treasury  operations  in  the \ncontext of the reform dynamics. Amendments to ensure the following are under consideration: \n \n\nharmonization  of  the  Budget  System  Law  and  the  Treasury  Law  on  budget \nexecution; \n\nprovision  for  parliamentary  appropriation  of  the  state  budget,  and  progressive \nprovision for budget organization extra-budgetary funds; \n\npermission  for  MOF  to  reduce  the  appropriations  if  financial  exigencies  so \nrequire; \n\nprogressive  improvement  in  disclosure  of \norganization extra-budgetary funds; and \n\nthe  state  budget  and  budget \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2         29 \n\n(v) \n\neventual  production  of  annual  accounts  and  their  audit  by  independent  external \nauditors; certification and submission of reports to the parliament, and publication \nof the reports. \n\n2. \n\nBudget Preparation Reform \n\n \n \n \n32. \nBudget  Classification.  The revised budget classification  system  based on  the  GFSM \n2001  has  been  prepared  with  external  technical  assistance.  The  training  needs  for  the \nintroduction  of  the  revised  budget  classification  need  to  be  met  after  development  of  an \nappropriate training program. The Government has agreed that this would be completed in time \nfor the 2009 budget.  \n \n33. \nMTBF  and  Program  Budgeting. A prepilot MTBF was used by MOF in 2005, assisting \nit  to  evaluate  the  fiscal  policy  implications  and  impact  of  new  policies  on  expenditures. This is \nexpected  to  be  extended  to  a  full  pilot  in  the  2008  budget.  This  is  predominantly  a  top-down \nexercise involving MOF and MOE to improve the sustainability of the annual budget and better \nintegrate capital and current expenditure budgeting. \n \n34. \nAt the same time it is also planned to introduce program budgeting in selected ministries \nby  developing  policy  objectives  and  priorities  with  some  modification  of  existing  budget \nclassification in the preparation of the 2008 budget. \n \n35. \nImproved  Integration  of  the  Budget.  The  Government  has  also  assured  that  an \ninterministerial committee to examine and finalize the business processes for integration of the \nexpenditures on PIP financed from external sources would be established before January 2009. \nIt  would  also  take  steps  to  bring  within  the  parliamentary  appropriation  process  all  budget \norganization extra-budgetary funds.  \n \n \n \n36. \nInstitutional  Capacity  Building.  A  Treasury  has  been  established  as  a  department  of \nMOF.  At  the  end  of  2006  it  had  branches  in  eight  oblasts  and  their  districts,  after  successfully \ntesting the core functions of the treasury system at the beginning of 2006 in two major oblasts \n(including Tashkent city). The current main functions of the treasury branch offices comprise: \n \n\nDevelopment of Treasury Operations \n\n3. \n\nclosing  down  the  bank  accounts  of  the  budget organizations  in  their  areas  for \nbudget operations, bringing them under the consolidated treasury bank accounts \nand  meeting  the  payment  needs  of  the  budget organizations  from  the  treasury \nbank accounts; \n\npreregistering  budget  organizations\u2019  contracts  for  goods  and  services  to  ensure \navailability of funds; \n\nex-ante checking of payment requests from the  budget organizations against the \nbudget allocation and registered contracts; and \n\nprimary  accounting  of  transactions  and  reporting  to  central  Treasury  for \nconsolidation and bank reconciliation. \n\n \nBy expanding the treasury network  the Government has planned to extend the scope of \n37. \ntreasury  operations  to  all  oblasts  and  rayons  before  the  end  of  2007.  It  will  finance  the \nacquisition,  renovation  or  construction  of  the  premises  for  treasury  offices.  The  Government \n \n \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n\f30          Appendix 2 \n\n4. \n\nImprovement of the Accounting System \n\nissued a Presidential Resolution in February 200711, which outlined the organizational structure \nand  staffing  plan  for  the  treasury  offices.  Subsequently  a  Cabinet  of  Ministers  resolution  was \nissued which appointed a deputy minister of MOF to be the head of treasury.  \n \n38. \nCurrently  MOF\u2019s financial departments  in oblasts and rayons have some degree of dual \nsubordination  to  the  local  governments  and  MOF.  The  government  has  assured  that the local \ntreasury offices will be brought under direct MOF control after the Treasury is fully established. \n \n \n \n39. \nAs the  treasury is  established  nationwide,  the  need  for  a  robust  accounting  system  to \ncapture  the  data  at  the  transaction  stage  becomes  a  priority.  The  current  accounting  and \ntreasury system depends on a mixture of manual and computer driven processes, and uses two \ndisparate  IT  systems  developed  for  specific  purposes  such  as  preregistration  of  contracts  and \npayment request verification and consolidation of accounting reports.  \n \n40. \nA  new  unified  COA  has  been  developed  and  approved  as  part  of  the  preparatory  work \nfor the implementation of the GFMIS with external technical assistance. Owing to the constraints \nand limited functionality of the IT systems now used by MOF, the new united COA cannot yet be \nimplemented.  It  will,  however,  be  the  backbone  of  a  modern  accounting  system  when  the \nGFMIS  is  implemented.  Meanwhile,  it  is  important  that  the  interim  systems  are  modified  to  the \nextent possible to facilitate early implementation of the revised  budget  classification by January \n2009. \n \n41. \nApart  from  the  essential  program  modifications  needed  to  implement  the  revised \nclassification  from  2009,  the  authorities  intend  to  organize  major  training  programs  for  budget \nand treasury staff prior to January 2009. This is a critical area and needs priority attention. \n \n \n  \n42. \nThis is the cornerstone of the Government\u2019s reform strategy. Without a GFMIS it will be \ndifficult  to  sustain  the  reforms  in  the  budget  preparation,  treasury  operations,  and  improved \nfiscal  management and accounting already made, and to make further progress. Outputs of the \nproject for GFMIS implementation and the associated process reforms will be the following. \n \n\nPlanning and Implementation of GFMIS \n\n5. \n\nCentralized  support  for  nationwide  treasury  operations  servicing  almost  50,000 \nbudget organizations of all levels of government (national and subnational). \n\nUse  of  a  modern  accounting  system  with  a  uniform  COA  reflecting  revised \nbudget  classification  (GFSM  2001),  but  capturing  all  financial  flows,  including \nbudget  organization  extra-budgetary  funds  and  expenditure  financed  from \nexternal sources. Initially it will be on a cash basis, but will have the flexibility to \nallow  seamless  future  migration  to  accrual-based  international  accounting \nstandards.  \n\nRelease of budget appropriations according to financial plans and forward cash- \nflow forecasting to facilitate payment financing. \n\nImproved  cash  management  due  to  consolidation  of  all  government  cash \nresources under a TSA at CBU and reduction in the cost of budget financing. \n\n                                                 \n11  Presidential  Resolution  No.  PP-594  of  28  February  2007  \u201cOn  measures  for  further  development  of  a  system of \n\ntreasury execution of the State Budget\u201d. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n\n\fLiability  management  through  commitment  control  and  avoidance  of  budget \noverruns, misdirection of budget funds, and payment arrears. \n\nCentralized payment processing eliminating delays in payment cycles, enhancing \nsuppliers\u2019 confidence in the government system. \n\nAppendix 2         31 \n\nTimely production of accurate fiscal reports for national and subnational agencies \nto meet diverse user needs.  \n\n \n(viii)  Assistance  for  internal and  external  audit  by  independent  external  agency such \n\nas the Chamber of Accounts, which will promote transparency. \n\nAssistance  for  budget  management,  PIP  reviews,  and  in-year  adjustments  by \ntimely generation of reports and preparation of more realistic annual budgets. \n\nSupport  for  review  of  MTBF  by  providing  data  for  trend  analysis, and  program \nbudget reforms through production of program cost profiles. \n\n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n \n(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\n \n \n \n\n\f32          Appendix 3 \n\nPublic Finance Management Reform Strategy 2007\u20132018 \n \nThe Ministry of Finance \n \nUzbekistan \n \nApril 2007 \n \n \nCONTENTS \n\nINTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW \nPurpose \nUltimate Objective \nIntermediate Objective \nTimeframe \nSequencing \n\nCENTRALIZED TREASURY SYSTEM \nEstablishment of Treasury \nBenefits of Treasury Establishment \nFunctions of Treasury \n\nB. \n2.1 \n2.2  \n2.3 \n2.4   MOF Treasury \n2.5 \nGFMIS \n2.6 \nTreasury Single Account \n\nACCOUNTING REFORM \nPrinciples of New Accounting System \nPhasing \nBenefits \n\nBUDGET PREPARATION REFORM \n\nBudget Classifications \nMTBF and Program Budgeting \nAppropriation System \nInter-governmental Fiscal Relationships \nDisclosure of Budget and Financial Information \n\nSTATUTORY FRAMEWORK \n\nSTAFF TRAINING \n\nPFM REFORM ACTION PLAN \n\n \n\nA. \n1.1 \n1.2 \n1.3 \n1.4 \n1.5 \n\nC. \n3.1 \n3.2  \n3.3 \n\nD. \n4.1 \n4.2 \n4.3  \n4.4 \n4.5 \n\nE. \n\nF. \n\nG. \n \n\n \n\n33 \n33 \n33 \n33 \n33 \n34 \n\n34 \n34 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n36 \n36 \n\n37 \n37 \n37 \n38 \n\n38 \n38 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n39 \n\n40 \n\n41 \n\n42 \n\n\fAppendix 3          33 \n\n1.1  \n\nPurpose \n\nA.  INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW \n\nThe  President  of  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  has  during  recent  years  directed  the  executive \nauthorities  to  undertake  actions  to  design  and  execute  a  Public  Financial Management (PFM) \nreform strategy.  \n \nThe purpose of this information document, which has been approved by the Minister of Finance, \nis to: \n \n\u2022 \n \n\u2022 \n\nIdentify the reform  priorities  and  sequencing  of  reform  measures  in  order  to  guide  the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) in the execution of the strategy; and \n\nSummarize the strategy; \n\n \n\u2022 \n \n1.2   Ultimate Objective \n\nSet out the PFM reform action plan.  \n\nThe  ultimate  objective  of  the  PFM  strategy  is  to  improve  control  over  the  PFM  system  in  the \nRepublic of Uzbekistan. Improved control is necessary to: \n\nAllocate  resources  in  accordance  with  the  priorities  and  policies  of  the  Government  of \nUzbekistan; \n\nDeliver services efficiently in terms of the use of resources; \n\nMaintain aggregate fiscal discipline.  \n\nIntermediate Objective \n\nThe intermediate objective is to modernize key processes in the PFM system via the: \n \n\u2022 \n \n\u2022 \n\nEstablishment of a modern centralized treasury system;  \n\nIntroduction  of  a  modern,  comprehensive  and  unified  budget  and  accounting  system \nincluding a new budget classification and a new chart of accounts (COA); and \n\nIntroduction of a medium-term budget framework (MTBF) and program budgeting.  \n\n \n\u2022 \n \n1.4   Timeframe \n\nThe  strategy  envisages  reform  actions  until  2018.  This  is  the  currently  planned  date  for \ncompleting  the  phasing-in  of  international  public  sector  accounting  standards  (IPSAS). \nHowever,  it  is  possible  that  the  end  date  of  2018  will  change,  for  example  if  the  accounting \nstandards  are  phased  in  more  quickly  or  slowly  than  currently  envisaged,  or  if  further  reform \nmeasures are decided on.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n\u2022 \n \n\u2022 \n \n1.3  \n\n\f34          Appendix 3 \n\n1.5   Sequencing \n\nInformation  System \n\nThe  new  Government  Financial  Management \n(GFMIS),  budget \nclassifications and COA are planned to  become  fully  operational  on  January  1,  2011.  On the \nsame date, the Treasury is planned to become fully operational.  In  order  to  prepare  for  this,  a \nDepartment  for  Methodology  and  Introduction  of  Treasury  Execution  for  the  State  Budget  was \nestablished in the MOF. \n \nCompliance  with  IPSAS  and  the  Government  Finance  Statistics  Manual  (GFSM)  2001  is \nplanned to be phased in until 2018. \n \nThe  2008  budget  is  planned  to  be  prepared  in  the  context  of  an  MTBF  and  pilot  program \nbudgeting.  \n \nThe 2009 and 2010 budgets are planned to be prepared on the basis of expanded pilot program \nbudgeting, with full program budgeting introduced from January 1, 2011.  \n \nThe new budget classifications are planned to be introduced at the latest from January 1, 2011, \nbut might be introduced earlier, from January 1, 2009 or January 1, 2010.  \n \n\nB.  CENTRALIZED TREASURY SYSTEM \n\n2.1 \n\nEstablishment of Treasury \n\nThe  Department  for  Methodology  and  Introduction  of  Treasury  Execution  for  the  State  Budget \nwas established in May 2005 in order to introduce progressively the Treasury execution system \nfor  the  State  Budget.  Its  operations  now  cover  the  whole  country  and  it  is  planned  to cover all \nbudgetary  expenditures  by  December  31,  2007.  The  President\u2019s  Resolution  #594  of February \n28, 2007 established the MOF Treasury on the basis of this Department. \n  \n2.2   Benefits of Treasury Establishment  \n\nThe MOF plans to improve control over the PFM system via the establishment of the Treasury \nby: \n \n\u2022 \n\nImproved  control  over  cash  by  consolidating  government  banking  arrangements  and \nintroducing systematic cash planning and management. Currently, budget organizations \nhave their own bank accounts in commercial banks, the MOF does not receive accurate \nand timely information on Government cash flows and balances, and therefore system-\nwide control over cash is loose;12 \n\nImproved  control  over  payments,  ensuring  that  they  conform  to  appropriations.  Final \ncontrol  over  payments  has  been  exercised  by  commercial  banks  and  has  been  loose \nlack  of \nbecause  of  weak \naccountability of banks to the MOF) and technical infrastructure (broad budget economic \nclassification, paper-based information systems); \n\nrelationships \n\nrelationship, \n\n(bank-client \n\ninstitutional \n\n                                                 \n12 It has been estimated that there are approximately 47,000 budget organizations in the Republic of Uzbekistan, at \ncentral, regional and local government levels, using 120,000 bank accounts. \n\n \n\u2022 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3          35 \n\nEstablishing  control  over  commitments,  e.g.,  before  contracts  for  the  supply  of  goods \nand  services  become  valid.    This  should  make  the  expenditure  process  more  orderly, \nincreasing compliance with budget expenditure appropriations and reducing expenditure \narrears. Hitherto, there has been no commitment control; \n\nImproving  information  collection,  synthesis  and  analysis,  via  a  GFMIS  that  generates \nimmediate  information  on  budget  execution  and  other  general  government  financial \ntransactions.    \n\n \nIn  turn,  strengthened  fiscal  control  should  make:  fiscal  policies  more  stable  and  sustainable, \nwith attendant macroeconomic benefits; monetary policies more effective by making fiscal flows \nmore  transparent;  banking  systems  more  effective  by  eliminating  the  budget  execution  role  of \ncommercial  banks;  and  budgetary  policies  more  effective  by  improved  information  and \nstrengthened control over resources. \n \nThe  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  has  in  the  past  been  successful  in  aggregate  expenditure  control, \nbut this has required immense effort which has been to the detriment of other PFM functions. \n \n2.3 \n\nFunctions of Treasury \n\nWhen it is fully operational, the Treasury is planned to have four groups of functions: performing \ncertain central financial functions; developing and issuing standards; promulgating instructions; \nand preparing proposals for the MOF. In fulfilling its functions, the Treasury should endeavor to \nmeet international standards. \n\nThe planned central finance functions of the Treasury are to: \n\nAccept,  record  and  fulfill  all  requests  for  payment  authorized  to  be  made  by  all \norganizations of the general government sector; \n\nAccept, record and deposit all receipts authorized to be received by all organizations of \nthe general government sector; \n\nManage the banking relationships of the general government sector; \n\nManage  the  Soum-denominated  debt,  financial  assets,  contingent  liabilities  and \ncontingent  assets13  of  the  general  government  sector  within  the  framework  of  policies \ndetermined  by  statutory  instruments  enacted  by  the  Oliy  Majlis  and  regulatory \ninstruments promulgated by the President and the Cabinet of Ministers;   \n\nProduce  financial  statements  and  management  reports  on  the  financial  operations  and \nfinancial position of the general government sector and its organizations,   including as \nprovided for in legislation and regulations; \n\nControl other aspects of budget execution by: controlling the conformity of certificates of \npurpose  and  payment  requests  with  budgetary  authorities  and  with  requirements  of \nstatutory and regulatory instruments; cash planning, that is the preparation of payment \nand  receipt  forecast  schedules;  cash  management;  commitment  control;  and  advising \n\n                                                 \n13 Foreign currency-denominated debt, financial assets, contingent liabilities and contingent assets are not planned to \n\nbe managed by the Treasury in the foreseeable future. \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n\n\f36          Appendix 3 \n\nthe  MOF  of  potential  or  expected  divergences  in  the  course  of  the  financial  year \nbetween budgets as executed and budgets as approved, and of possible consequences \nof, and responses to, such divergences. \n\nThe planned functions of the Treasury in respect of issuing standards are to assist the MOF to \nissue standards in respect of the general government sector for accounting and internal audit. \n\nThe  planned  functions  of  the  Treasury  in  respect  of  promulgating  instructions  are  to  assist  the \nMOF  to  promulgate  instructions  in  respect  of  the  general  government  sector  for:  processing \npayments  and  receipts;  cash  planning;  cash  management;  accounting  for  and  otherwise \nrecording  payments  and  receipts;  accounting  for  and  otherwise  recording  transactions  other \nthan  payments  and  receipts,  including  other  economic  flows  and  stocks,  and  contingent \nliabilities and assets (guarantees and other); financial and management reporting; commitment \ncontrol;  procedures  in  respect  of  the  approval  of  transactions  giving  rise  to  contingent  assets \nand  liabilities  (guarantees  and  other);  internal  control;    internal  audit;  and  other  aspects  of \nbudget execution. \n\nThe planned functions of the Treasury in respect of advising the MOF are to provide advice on \nappropriate  policies,  relevant  to  the  Treasury\u2019s  functions  listed  above,  to  achieve  the  ultimate \nobjective of the PFM strategy. \n\n2.4   MOF Treasury \n\nThe pilot  MOF  Treasury  is  applying  commitment  and  payment  controls  and  cash  management \nwith  limited  tailor-made  software.  Progressively,  the  coverage  of  the  different  types  of \nexpenditure  is  being  expanded  and  budget  organization  bank  accounts  are  being  closed.  By \nDecember 31, 2007, it is planned for all types of expenditure to be covered by the Treasury and \nall  budget  organization  bank  accounts  used  for  budgetary  expenditures  to  be  closed.  It  is  also \nplanned that all budgetary transactions from that date on until the implementation of the GFMIS \non  January  1,  2011  will  be  processed  via  one  Treasury  bank  account  for  each  budget \n(Republican, oblast or rayon). \n \n2.5 \n\nGFMIS \n\nIt  is  planned  to  procure  a  customized  off-the-shelf  GFMIS  to  enable  the  Treasury  to  fulfill  its \nfunctions  efficiently.  The  procurement  process  is  planned  to  begin  in  late-2007,  with \nimplementation  commencing  in  2010  and  the  full  operation  by  the  Treasury  of  the  GFMIS \ncommencing on January 1, 2011.  \n \n2.6 \n\nTreasury Single Account \n\nThe Treasury Single Account, to be located at the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU), is planned \nto  apply  to  the  whole  of  the  general  government  sector.  However,  in  order  to  effect  the \ndisbursement  of  notes  to  pay  salaries  etc,  a  separate  Treasury  bank  account for each budget \nmay be necessary; at this stage, it is planned to maintain such cash disbursement accounts, but \nthis is subject to review and may change. \n \nThe Treasury bank account for the Republican budget was opened in March 2007. It is planned \nfor  this  bank  account  to  cover  all  Treasury  operations  of  the  Republican  budget  by  end-\nDecember  2007, and  for  the  Treasury  Single  Account  to  be established  on  January  1,  2011, \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3          37 \n\nwhen  the  GFMIS  is  fully  operational.  At  this  time,  it  is  planned  to  close  all  budget organization \nbank accounts used for extra-budgetary expenditures. \n \n\nC.  ACCOUNTING REFORM \n\n3.1 \n\nPrinciples of New Accounting System \n\nThe  MOF  has  decided  that  the  efficiency  of  the  accounting  system  should  be  maximized  in \norder to be able to support improved control. To this end, the system is planned to be uniform \nthroughout  the  general  government  sector  and  to  comply  with  international  standards. \nAccordingly, it is planned to: promulgate new Uzbekistan public sector accounting standards in \nline with accrual basis IPSAS; comply with GFSM 2001; and undertake budget accounting on a \ncash basis reflecting the GFSM 2001 classification structure. To this end, a uniform COA for the \ngeneral  government  sector  to  enable  accounting  and  reporting  on  these  bases  has  been \ndesigned and promulgated. For technical efficiency reasons, the structure of the new COA has \nbeen based on the GFSM 2001 classification structure. \n \n3.2   Phasing \n\nThe new accounting system is planned to replace an existing system which is fragmented; parts \nof the system are on a cash basis and part is on an outdated accrual basis. The MOF currently \nplans to implement the new system broadly as follows: \n \n\nPhase and Activities  \n\n2009-\n10 \n\n2011 \n\n2012-\n2015 \n\n2016-\n2018 \n\nPhase  0:  Pre-GFMIS  (if  the  GFSM  2001  budget  classification \nintroduced before the GFMIS implementation; otherwise in Phase 1) \n1.      Aggregate  budget  execution  reports  are  prepared  that  are  largely \n\nis \n\n \n_ _ _ _  \n\ncompliant with GFSM 2001 and Cash Basis IPSAS. \n\n\u2022 \n\nPhase 1: GFMIS Operational \n\n2.    Accrual IPSAS and GFSM 2001 information is prepared and provided as \n\n3.

The accrual IPSAS supplementary disclosures include segmental analyses \n\n(i.e., republican, oblast, and rayon budget levels). \n\n5.      Non-exchange  revenues  (e.g.,  taxes)  accounted  for  on  modified  accrual \n\nbasis. \n\n\u2022 \n\nPhase 2: GFSM 2001 Compliance (Excluding Land Valuation) \n\n6.     Indexation approach to revaluing assets is discontinued. \n\n7.      Contingent  assets  and  liabilities  are  identified  and  disclosed  for  budget \n\n8.

BUDGET PREPARATION REFORM \n\n4.1 \n\nBudget Classifications \n\nThe  MOF  plans  to  introduce  new  GFSM  2001-based  budget  classifications  at  the  latest  from \nJanuary 1, 2011, together with the new GFMIS. These new classifications have been designed \nand reflected in the design of the  new GFMIS. The MOF may introduce the new classifications \nearlier than January 1, 2011, on January 1, 2009 or January 1, 2010. \n \nThe  GFSM  2001-based  economic  classification  is  planned  to  be  used  for  appropriation \npurposes,  as  is  the  GFSM  2001-based  functional  classification  until  an  independent  program \nclassification  is  introduced  after  which  the  functional  classification  is  planned  to  be  used  for \nreporting purposes only. A GFSM 2001-compliant classification of balances and transactions of \nfinancial assets and liabilities by sector is intended to be introduced for reporting purposes only \n \nA  new  fund  classification  is  also  planned  to  be  introduced,  to  be  used  for  appropriation  and \ncontrol purposes.  \n \nThe  GFMIS  has  been  designed  to  incorporate  an  independent  program  classification.  It  is \nplanned to be activated when program budgeting is fully introduced on January 1, 2011.  \n \nThese  new  classifications  will  be  necessary  to  fully  realize  the  planned  benefits  from  the \nintroduction of the new Treasury.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3          39 \n\n \n4.2 \n\nMTBF and Program Budgeting  \n\nA  pre-pilot  MTBF  was  used  by  the  MOF  in  2004,  assisting  it  to  identify  the  consequences  of \nfiscal policy in future years and the impact of new policies on expenditure baselines. The MTBF \nprocess is planned to be extended in 2008 budget preparation into a full pilot. This is planned to \nbe initially predominantly a top-down exercise (the Medium-Term Financial Framework [MTFF]) \ninvolving the MOF and the Ministry of Economy (MOE) to ensure the sustainability of the annual \nbudget,  better  integration  of  capital  and  current  expenditure  budgeting  and  to  derive  financial \nceilings for annual budget proposals. \n \nIt is also planned that line ministries will introduce the MTBF in 2008 budget preparation on the \nbasis  of  pilot  programs,  on  a  bottom-up  basis. This  will  build  on  the  pre-pilot, in the MOF and \nselected  line  ministries,  to  give  policy  objectives,  priorities  and  results  greater  emphasis  in \nbudget  proposals  and  to  de-emphasize  the  use  of  cost  norms.  It  is  not  intended  to  introduce \nprogram  budgeting  fully  until  after  the  successful  implementation  of  the  full  pilot  and  with  the \nintroduction of the new Treasury system including the GFMIS, currently planned to be January \n1, 2011. \n \n4.3   Appropriation System   \n\nThe MOF plans to introduce appropriations of expenditure by the Oliy Majlis, on a cash basis, at \nthe  time  the  new  budget  classifications  are  introduced.  It  is  planned  that  appropriation  by  the \nOliy  Majlis  will  cover  the  republican,  oblast  and  rayon  budgets  as  currently  defined,  plus  the \nbudgets of State Targeted Funds (STFs) and the extra-budgetary funds of budget organizations \n(BO-EBFs). The MOF expects that Oliy Majlis appropriation will improve control of expenditure.  \n \nIt is planned that the appropriation of expenditure by the Oliy Majlis will be at more aggregated \nlevels  of  the  classifications,  and  that  these  appropriations  will  be  disaggregated  into  more \ndetailed budget allocations approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. \n \nIt is not planned to appropriate by programs until program budgeting is implemented fully. The \napplication of the appropriation system to STFs and BO-EBFs is planned to be progressive.  \n \n4.4 \n\nInter-governmental Fiscal Relationships \n\nThe MOF plans to develop clearer legal and institutional distinctions between different levels of \ngovernment,  basing  revenue  shares  and  transfers  to  regional  and  local  governments  on  more \nstable and predictable criteria. The MOF expects that this would improve control. The MOF also \nexpects  that  the  introduction  of  program  budgeting  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  the \ndistribution of policy responsibilities, and hence on the distribution of expenditure responsibilities \nas between central and local government. Accordingly, the MOF plans to commence a review of \ninter-governmental  fiscal  relations  once  the  shape  of  the  future  program  budgeting  system \nbecomes clearer. \n \n4.5 \n\nDisclosure of Budget and Financial Information \n\nSince  the  2003  budget  execution  report,  the  budget  and  budget  execution  reports  have  been \npublished on a summary basis.  Over the next decade, planned changes in the structure of the \nbudget  and  improvements  in  the  availability  of  budget  and  related  information  will  require \nfrequent fresh decisions to be made on the detail of the information to be disclosed to the Oliy \n\n \n\n\f40          Appendix 3 \n\n \n\nMajlis and the public. The  MOF plans to increase progressively the range and depth of budget, \nbudget execution and other information on public finances that is disclosed publicly. \n\nE.  STATUTORY FRAMEWORK \n\nThe  MOF  plans  to  initiate  amendments  to  the  Budget  System  Law  (BSL)  in  2008  as  set  out \nbelow.  \n \n1.  Revocation of BSL provisions that conflict with the provisions of the Law  On Treasury Execution of the \nState Budget \n \n2.  Authorization  for  the  MOF  to  promulgate,  without  further  legislative  approval,  the  following  budget \nclassifications that will be used for appropriation as well as for disclosure purposes; these classifications \nwill comply with the prevailing international standard for the classification of Government finance statistics \n(currently GFSM 2001): an economic classification for revenue, expenditure, and assets and liabilities; a \nfunctional  classification  of  expense  (expenditure);  an  organizational  classification;  a  program \nclassification; a fund classification; and any other required classifications. \n \n3.  Definition  of  budget  and  associated  disclosure  requirements,  including  publication  of  the  annual \nbudget, budget execution reports and associated ex ante and ex post documents, in conformity with the \nrelevant provisions of the  Code  of  Good  Practices  on  Fiscal  Transparency  of  the  IMF.  The  associated \ndocuments  will  include,  but  not  be  limited  to:  MTBF  documents;  financial  statements;  and  disclosures \nrelating  to  operations  within  the  general  government  sector  and  outside  the  budgetary  sector  (notably \nextra-budgetary funds of budget  organizations). The format of the associated documents will conform in \nparticular  with  the  prevailing  international  standard  for  the  classification  of  government  finance  statistics \nand prevailing international public sector accounting standards. \n \n4. Definition of new budget preparation procedures conforming with the relevant provisions of the Code of \nGood  Practices  on  Fiscal  Transparency  and  providing  for:  the  preparation  and  updating  of  an  MTBF \ndocument; the preparation of an annual budget strategy document; budget submissions to be constrained \nby expenditure ceilings; the definition of budget submissions in terms of policies, objectives and results as \nwell as input costs; and systematic new and existing policy reviews by the Government. \n \n5.

Since then \nthe  Government  has  undertaken  a  number  of  steps  to  advance  the  reform  process.  One  of \nthese  steps  was  the  development  of a PFM reform strategy  for  2007\u20132018 by  the  Ministry of \nFinance  (MOF)  in  April  2007.  The  strategy  outlines  an action plan  for  the  next  12  years  to  (i) \nestablish a functioning treasury system, (ii) adopt and implement a modern unified budget and \naccounting  system,  and  (iii)  introduce  a  medium-term  budget  framework  (MTBF) and program \nbudget. \n \n2. \nA central element of the PFM reform is to improve budget execution process significantly \nover the next 5 years. The strategy plans to set up a nationwide network of treasury offices with \na central treasury in MOF, local treasury departments at regional1 (oblast) level and branches at \ndistrict (rayon) level. These treasury offices will provide services to the  budget organizations of \nboth  national  and  subnational  governments.  The  currently  fragmented  treasury  banking \noperations  will  be  consolidated  under  a  treasury  single  account  at  the  Central  Bank  of \nUzbekistan, supported by a computerized information system. \n \n3. \nSome  of  the  preparatory  work  is  already  underway.  Since  April  2005,  pilot  treasury \noperations  with  limited  but  core  functionalities  have  started  in  Tashkent  city  and  Samarkand \noblast  and  their  associated  district  treasuries.  These  functionalities  include  procedures  for  ex-\nante checking of  budget organization  expenditures  and  application  of  commitment  controls  by \npreregistration of budget organization contracts. The pilot program extended to six other regions \nby the end of 2006, and there are plans to further cover the whole country. \n  \n4. \nMOF  has  done  the  groundwork  for  development  of  an  integrated  IT  system  (the \ngovernment  financial  management  information  system  [GFMIS])  for  use  by  all  treasury branch \noffices and the  central  treasury.  The  GFMIS  will  enhance  the  treasury  functions, substantially \nchanging business processes. It will help  to (i) streamline treasury banking and single\u2013account \noperations,  (ii)  release  budget  appropriations  according  to  financial  plans  and  use  cash-flow \nforecasting  to  smooth  payment  financing, and (iii)  create  a  central  accounting  system  using  a \nchart  of  accounts  built  to  reflect  the  revised  budget  classification  in  line  with  the  Government \nFinance  Statistics  Manual  (GFSM  2001)  and  the  International  Public  Sector  Accounting \nStandards  and  off-budget flows.  The GFMIS  will  also  have  a  report  generation  facility  to  meet \nbudget  performance  needs  for  in-year  adjustments  and  policy  analysis.  It  will  also  assist \npromotion  of  the  quality  of  annual  budgets  by  its  timely  reporting  on  fiscal  performance,  and \nprovide  data  for  checking  validity  of  assumptions,  time -series  comparisons, and trend analysis \nfor the medium-term budget framework (MTBF). \n \n5. \nOver the same period, the Government has also undertaken steps to improve the quality \nof  the  budget.  In  2005,  a  medium-term  fiscal  framework  (MTFF)  was  prepared,  establishing \ntargets  for  revenues  and  expenditures  for  the  next  3  years  consistent  with  the  medium-term \nprojections  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  A  working  group  consisting  of  representatives  of \nMOF,  Ministry  of  Economy  and  the  Central  Bank of  Uzbekistan  developed  projections  of  main \nmacroeconomic  parameters,  revenues,  and  expenditures  of  the  state  budget,  and  basic \n\n                                                 \n1   The 12 oblasts of Uzbekistan, the city of Tashkent, and the Autonomous Republic of Karakalpakstan.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56          Appendix 10 \n\nTechnical Assistance Impact, Outcome, Outputs and Components \n\ndirections of the budgetary policy for 2005\u20132007, laying the foundation for an MTBF consistent \nwith the MTFF.  \n \n6. \nWork  has  also  begun  to  formulate  the  budget  on  the  basis  of  output  and  policy \nobjectives  rather  than  input  norms.  An  experimental  budgeting  program  is being introduced in \nselected  ministries.  Considerable  work  has  been  done  in  developing  a  revised  budget \nclassification  system  in  line  with  international  standards  as  laid  down  in  the  GFSM  2001.  This \nincludes development of a unified  chart  of  accounts  to  reflect  the  revised  budget  classification \nand detailed accounting instructions \n \nB.  \n \nThe impact of the technical assistance (T A) project will be improved budget preparation \n7. \nand  execution  under  a  budget  classification  consistent  with  international  best  practices,  and \nimproved  linkage  between  budgeting  and  policy  objectives  and  investment  programs.  The \noutcome  of  the  TA  project  will  be  strengthened  capacity  of  the  Government  in  budget \npreparation and execution using the revised budget classification. The  TA  project is to address \nthe  immediate  capacity-building  needs  and  focus  on  the  areas  not  covered  by  other  donors \neither now or  in  the  near future. While the  TA  project  will  aim  to  have  a  nationwide impact, its \ntraining program  will  pay  special  attention  to  strengthening  the  capacity  of  relevant  staff  from \nMOF, Treasury, local treasury offices, Budget Department, MOE, and line ministries selected for \npilot program budgeting.  \n \n8. \nThe  TA  project  will  have  two  components:  (i)  support  for  budget  preparation,  and  (ii) \nsupport  for  budget  execution  through  treasury  operations  using  the  GFMIS.  The  TA  project \noutputs  will  comprise  (i)  development  of  user  manuals  on  budget  preparation  and  treasury \noperation  under  the  revised  budget  classification;  (ii)  development  of  training  modules  and \nmaterials  in  budget  preparation  and  execution  using  the  revised  budget  classification  system; \n(iii) development of performance indicators for the education sector; and (iv) training of 17 staff \nfrom MOF, Treasury,  Budget Department, and Treasury Training Center on budget preparation \nand execution based on the revised budget classification. \n \nC.  \n \n9. \nThe TA project will be implemented over 24 months, starting in January 2008. MOF will \nbe the Executing Agency for the  TA project. The TA project will require 24 person-months input \nby  international  consultants  and  48  person-months  by  national  consultants  with  the  following \nareas of expertise: (i) performance-based budget preparation, and (ii) budget execution through \ntreasury  operations. The consultants will be selected and engaged by  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB) in accordance with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). The consultants will interact closely with staff of MOF, Treasury, the PMO for \nthe loan project, as well as with the international donor community active in this area. A tentative \ntraining schedule is set out in Table A10.1 below. \n \nD. \n \n10. \nThe consultants will submit a short inception report after the start of the assignments and \nafter  agreement  with  MOF  on  the  content  of  the  training  modules  and  target  groups.  On \ncompletion  of  the  assignment,  the  consultants  will  submit  a  comprehensive  final  report \nhighlighting  all  activities  carried  out,  achievements  with  regard  to  improvement  of  skills  of \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nReporting \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10          57 \n\nCost Estimates and Financing \n\ngovernment  staff  concerned,  and  recommendations  on  further  steps  for  strengthening  staff \ncapacity in budget preparation and execution. \n \nE. \n \n11. \nThe  TA  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $720,000  equivalent.  ADB\u2019s  TA  project  funding \nprogram will provide a grant of $600,000. The Government will finance the balance of $120,000 \nby  providing  in-kind  contribution  for  office  accommodation,  logistical  support,  local  travel, and \ncounterpart staff. The TA project will be financed from ADB\u2019s TA project funding program. The \ndetailed cost estimate is presented in Table A10.2 below. \n \nF. \n \n\nConsultant Qualification Requirements and Description of Tasks \n\n1. \n\nBudget Preparation Specialist (international, 12 person-months) \n\n \n12. \nThe  consultant  will  have  (i)  at  least  a  university  degree  in  economics,  preferably  a \nMasters or above; (ii) a minimum of 5 years international experience in transition economies or \ndeveloping  countries;  (iii)  government  budget  experience;  (iv)  familiarity  with  setting  up  an \nMTFF  or  MTBF;  and  (v)  performance-based  budgeting  experience.
