An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was \nundertaken.  The  summary  EIA  was  circulated  to  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  Board  along  with  the  environmental \nmanagement plan on 30 September 2005.  \n \nThe  Project  is  in  Shandong  Province,  the  northwestern  part  of \nwhich is in the Hai River Basin (HRB) that drains into Bohai Bay. \nThe  Project  is  one  of  the  planned  wastewater  management \nprojects  under  the  national  Hai  River  Basin  Pollution  Prevention \nand Control Plan. Shandong provincial government (SPG) issued \nits  Shandong  Hai  River  Basin  (SHRB)  Environmental  Protection \nPlan in 2003. The proposed Project\u2019s areas have been prioritized \nfor implementation under the SHRB Plan. \n \nfour \ninto \nThe  Project \ncomponents: \n(ii)  municipal \nwastewater  management  (MWM),  (iii)  solid  waste  management \n(SWM),  and  (iv)  industrial  wastewater  management  (IWM).  The \nproposed  Project  will  be  implemented  in  secondary  cities  and \ncounties  in  four  municipalities:  Binzhou,  Dezhou,  Jinan,  and \nLiaocheng. \n \nWith  the  lack  of  environmental  infrastructure,  particularly  in \nsecondary  cities  and  counties,  and  inadequate  management  of \nthe  wastewater  and  solid  waste  services,  SPG  would  have \ndifficulty achieving the pollution control targets in the SHRB Plan. \nThe  proposed  Project  will  (i)  support  institutional  changes  and \nphysical  investments  to  reduce  the  high  levels  of  untreated \nwastewater,  (ii)  adopt  cleaner  technologies,  (iii)  promote  water \nreuse  to  augment  water  resources,  and  (iv)  control  non-point \nsource of pollution through effective SWM. The Project is a major \nurban  infrastructure  initiative  under  Shandong\u2019s  Tenth  5-Year \nPlan.  \n \n\nincludes  nine  subprojects  grouped \ninstitutional  development, \n(i) \n\n\f \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan \n \nFinancing Plan \n\nlocal \n\nin  SHRB; \n\nsolid  waste \n\nThe  Project  aims  to  address  the  key  sectoral  issues  and \nconstraints by (i) employing an integrated multisector approach to \nenvironmental  pollution  control \n(ii)  supporting \ninstitutional  aspects  related  to  effective  environmental  pollution \nlevels;  (iii)  addressing  water \ncontrol  management  at \nconservation  issues;  (iv)  enhancing  capacity  in  environmental \npollution  control  through  improved  management  of  municipal, \nindustrial  wastewater,  and \nservices;  and \n(v) development  of  sustainable  wastewater  treatment  and  SWM \ncompanies. \n \nThe impact of the Project is to improve the urban environment and \npublic  health  in  Shandong  province  by  reducing  pollution  of  the \nHRB from different sources. Major outcomes of the Project are to \n(i)  provide  improved  and  sustainable  wastewater  and  SWM \nservices,  on  economically  and  environmentally  sound  principles \nand  practices,  through  establishment  of  appropriate  wastewater \nand solid waste utility companies in the project cities/counties; and \n(ii)  implement  an  integrated  approach  for  the  management  and \ncontrol of solid waste, and municipal and industrial wastewater. In \neach project city/county, the service area will encompass most of \nthe  urbanized  area,  maximizing  potential  downstream  benefits  of \nimproved  water  quality  through  point  and  non-point  source \npollution control. \n \nThe Project is estimated to cost $160.36 million equivalent.  \n \n\n \n\nSource \nADB Loan \nGovernment \n\n \n\n \nTotal \n     80.00\n\n     80.36 \n\n \n\n \nPercent \n     49.90 \n\n     50.10  \n \n\n100.00  \n\nTotal \n\n \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n   160.36\n\n \nADB will provide a loan of $80 million equivalent to finance 49.9% \nof  the  cost  of  the  Project.  County/city/municipal  finance  bureaus, \nand  self-financing  by  the  implementing  agencies  (IA),  will  cover \nthe remaining financing requirements. \n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  ADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $80  million  from  its  ordinary  capital \nresources under its London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a \ngrace period of 5 years; an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility;  and  a  commitment \ncharge  of  0.75%  per  year,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions \nset forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \n\n \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\nThe  Borrower  will  be  the  PRC,  which  will  relend  to  SPG  on  the \nsame  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan.  SPG  will \nonlend  to  municipal  governments,  which  will  onlend  to  city  and \ncounty  governments.  The  city/county  governments  then  will \nonlend  to  the  IAs.  All  relending  and  onlending  arrangements  for \nMWM  and  SWM  subprojects  will  be  on  the  same  terms  and \nconditions  as  the  ADB  loan.  For  IWM  subprojects,  a  repayment \nperiod  of  12  years  including  grace  period  of  4  years  will  apply. \nSPG  will  charge  a  service  fee  of  0.2%  on  the  MWM  and  SWM \ncomponents,  and  0.5%  on  the  IWM  component,  as  part  of  the \nsubsidiary  loan  agreement.  The  IAs  will  assume  the  foreign \nexchange and interest rate variation risks for the ADB loan. \n \nUntil 30 June 2012 \n \n31 December 2011 \n\n \nSPG  will  be  responsible  for  overseeing  implementation  of  the \nProject.  A  project  leading  group  headed  by  Shandong  Province\u2019 \nvice  governor,  and  a  Shandong  provincial  project  management \noffice (SPMO) headed by the deputy director general of Shandong \nProvincial  Construction  Bureau,  have  been  established.  The \nSPMO  includes  members  from  the  Shandong  Provincial  Finance \nBureau,  Shandong  Provincial  Development  and  Reform \nCommission,  and  Shandong  Provincial  Environmental  Protection \nBureau.  The  SPMO  will  oversee  project  implementation  and \ncoordinate the work of the nine IAs and local governments.  \n \nShandong Provincial Government  \n \nADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement,  and  in  accordance  with \nthe  PRC\u2019s  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  and  procurement \nregulations. Civil works valued at less than $10 million equivalent \nwill  be  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB) \nin  accordance  with  government  procedures \nprocedures, \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Foreign  contractors  may  participate  in  the \nbidding for NCB contracts, in accordance with ADB requirements. \nEquipment  and  materials  estimated  at  $1  million  or  more  will  be \nprocured  using  international  competitive  bidding  procedures,  and \nthose  valued  at  less  than  $1  million  will  be  procured  through \nlimited  international  bidding  and/or  NCB.  Goods  valued  up  to \n$100,000 will be procured through shopping. \n \nSPG  will  select  and  engage  an  international  consulting  firm  in \nassociation  with  domestic  consultants,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants. \nThe  consulting \nlocal  project \nmanagement  offices,  and  the  IAs  in project implementation and \n\nfirm  will  assist \n\nthe  SPMO, \n\nv \n\n \n\n\f \nProject  Benefits \nBeneficiaries \n\nand \n\nmanagement,  and  capacity  building  under  the  Project.  The \ninternational consulting firm will be recruited using ADB\u2019s quality- \nand  cost-based  selection  method.  The  Project  will  provide  51 \nperson-months  of \ninternational  and  168  person-months  of \ndomestic  consulting  services,  covering  (i)  project  management, \npredesign pilot studies, and implementation support; (ii) review of \ndetailed  design,  and  assistance  with  tender  documentation  and \nbid  evaluation;  (iii)  construction  management  and  efficient \noperating procedures; (iv) organization and operations structuring; \n(v)  development  of \nfinancial  management  and  accounting, \nmanagement  information  system,  and  human  resource  systems; \n(vi)  corporate  strategic  planning, \nincluding  private  sector \nparticipation  (PSP);  and  (vii)  social  impact  and  environmental \nmonitoring.  Least  cost  selection  and/or  consultants\u2019  qualifications \nselection  will  be  used \nfor  clean  development  mechanism \nimplementation and marketing. \n \nThe Project will benefit more than 3.9 million people in the project \nareas,  including  2.2  million  in  the  direct  project  area  and  1.7 \nmillion  in  the  indirect  project  area.  The  Project  will  contribute  to \npollution control in the HRB, particularly in the Tuhai\u2013Majia River \nsystem.  The  multisector  and  multimedia  approach  to  pollution \nprevention in the HRB will provide the most sustainable prospects \nfor  (i) reducing  waterborne  pollution,  (ii)  achieving  the  surface \nwater quality targets, and (iii) improving the living conditions in the \nproject areas. \n \nImplementation  of  the  institutional  development  component  will \nfollow  an  agreed  road  map,  which  aims  to  establish  SWM  and \nMWM companies that are managerially autonomous, operationally \nefficient,  and  financially  self-sustainable.  This  goal,  especially  in \nthe  financial  area,  is  a  pioneering  attempt  in  the  local  areas \nconcerned,  as  well  as  for  SWM  in  general  in  the  PRC.  The \ngradual  changes  proposed  under  the  Project  are  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s long-term strategy to (i) reduce direct Government \ninvolvement  in  waste  operations  and  management,  (ii)  expand \nservice coverage, and (iii) improve operational efficiencies. \n \nBy improving environmental and sanitary conditions in the project \nareas,  the  Project  is  expected  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  water- \nand  vector-related  diseases,  and  improve  living  conditions  of  the \npopulation.  Health  benefit  estimates \nfor  2009\u20132024  show \nsignificant cost savings accruing to project beneficiaries. \n \n\n \n\nvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nOf  the  beneficiary  population,  6.5%  live  below  the  local  poverty \nline.  The  poverty  and  social  analysis  shows  that  the  Project  will \ncontribute to (i) improved wastewater and solid waste facilities and \nservices;  (ii)  reduced  air,  surface,  and  groundwater  pollution;  (iii) \nreduced  risks  of  exposure  to  disease  vectors;  (iv)  increased \nemployment  opportunities  and  income-generating  activities;  (v) \nreduced risks of people falling into poverty due to closure of paper \nmills;  and  (vi)  improved  urban  living  environment  and  quality  of \nlife. An affordability analysis was undertaken of two representative \nhousehold groups: the average-income group and the low-income \ngroup. The proposed tariffs will be set at levels that are affordable \nfor  both  groups,  with  the  monthly  water  and  wastewater  bill \naccounting for 2.5% of the income of average family and 4.0% of \nthat  of  the  low-income  households.  The  solid  waste  disposal  bill \nwill account for 0.4% of the income of the average family and 1% \nof that of the low-income family. For the poorest households, the \ncity/county  governments  provide  a  minimum  living  standard \nscheme, which includes a provision for lifeline utility services. The \ncounty  and  city  governments  also  provide  a \nrebate  on \nwater/wastewater  bills  to  all  households  qualifying  for  social \nassistance  with  the  recent  increase  in  water  and  wastewater \ntariffs. \n \nPotential  project  risks  involve  mainly  institutional  and  financial \nfactors:  (i)  inadequate  political  support  for  institutional  reform  in \nSWM  and  MWM  sectors,  corporatization,  PSP  and  integration \nprocess;  unfamiliarity  with  performance-driven  commercial \noperations;  and  lack  of  staffing;  (ii)  resistance  to  required  tariff-\nfee \nsetting  and  collection  mechanisms;  and  (iii) \ncollections \nsustainability. \nfinancial \nthreaten \nComprehensive  institutional  development  and  training  programs \nwill  be  implemented  in  coordination  with  relevant  departments  to \nensure  support  for  the  proper  restructuring  of  SWM  sector,  and \nimplementation of the agreed road map. The detailed tariff-setting \nand collection mechanisms and procedures will be developed in a \nparticipatory  way,  with  a  view  to  strengthening  the  regulatory \nfunctions  of  the  local  authorities.  Other  potential  risks  include \nweak  enforcement  of  separate  collection  of  hazardous  and \nmunicipal wastes, and pretreatment of industrial wastewater. The \nProject will address these risks by developing detailed guidelines \nfor  collection  and  reporting  procedures,  including  (i)  handling  of \nhazardous  waste;  (ii)  training  for  waste

\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Shandong Hai River Basin Pollution Control Project \n(the Project). \n \n2. \nThe proposed Project is in Shandong Province, the northwestern part of which is in the Hai \nRiver Basin (HRB), which drains into Bohai Bay through nine tributaries.1 The Project is one of the \nplanned wastewater management projects under the national Hai River Basin Pollution Prevention \nand  Control  Plan  (HRB  Plan),  funded  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB). 2  Shandong \nprovincial government (SPG) issued its Shandong HRB (SHRB) Environmental Protection Plan in \n2003. The proposed Project\u2019s areas have been prioritized for implementation under the SHRB Plan. \nThe project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe pace of environmental pollution in the PRC has been increasing rapidly in step with the \ncountry\u2019s swift economic growth over the past decade. Surface water and groundwater in particular \nhave  been  affected,  with  water  quality  worsening  in  the  major  river  basins  of  the  PRC.  Of  the \ncountry\u2019s  seven  major  river  basins,  52%  of  water  bodies  do  not  meet  class  III  national  quality \nstandards.3 \n \nIncreasing discharge of untreated or partially treated municipal and industrial wastewater is \n4. \na  direct  and  major  cause  of  river  pollution.  Due  to  rapid  economic  growth,  industrial  wastewater \ncomprises more than 70% of total wastewater generated in some cities. For example, the output \nfrom  the  paper  industry,  which  is  an  important  economic  activity  in  Shandong  and  many  other \nprovinces,4 has  grown  more  than  tenfold  in  the  past  2  decades.  The  industry  is  associated  with \nsignificant environmental pollution.  \n \n5. \nIn 2003, the PRC generated about 550 million tons of municipal solid waste. Approximately \n85% of it was disposed of in simple landfills or open dumps that do not meet acceptable sanitary \nrequirements. In addition to direct adverse impacts on public health, the growing and uncontrolled \ndisposal  of  solid  waste  contributes  to  increasing  contamination  of  groundwater  supplies  through \ninadequate leachate collection systems.5 \n \n6. \nIn its Tenth 5-year Plan (T5YP) (2001\u20132005), the Government focused on pollution control \nplans  for  the  key  river  basins,  including  the  HRB.  This  basin,  which  is  about  265,000  square \n\n                                                 \n1   Shandong Province also includes parts of Huai River Basin and Yellow River Basin. \n2   ADB. 1998.

Manila (Loan 2207-PRC).  \n\n3   The PRC has five water quality standards, with class I designated for drinking water resources and nationally protected \n\nbodies of water, and class V only for industrial use. Class III is the minimum quality for municipal water supply. \n\n4   Shandong Province produces almost 15% of the national production of paper. \n5  Leachate is liquid percolated from solid waste landfills or dumps; it can contain undesirable or toxic chemicals. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n  \n\nkilometers (km2), includes Shandong Province in the south and southeast.6 More than 117 million \npeople live in the HRB, which includes a number of megacities. The basin is one of the PRC's most \nimportant industrial regions, accounting for 15% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP).   \n \n7. \nA  severe  water  crisis  in  the  densely  populated  HRB,  especially  in  its  southeastern  areas, \nhas  resulted  from  a  combination  of  (i)  fast  economic  growth;  (ii)  overexploitation  of  surface  and \ngroundwater  for  domestic,  industrial,  and  agricultural  uses;  and  (iii)  lack  of  adequate  wastewater \nand solid waste treatment facilities. This situation has affected people\u2019s lives and health seriously, \nand  constrained  local  socioeconomic  development  and  productivity.  Major  urban  areas,  including \nseveral  megacities,  have  only  partial  wastewater  treatment.  More  than  80%  of  the  surface  water \nand 50% of the groundwater are classified as polluted sources of raw water.  \n \n8. \nShandong  Province  comprises  17  municipalities  and  139  counties,  districts,  and  cities, \nspread  over  156,700  km2  with  a  population  of  91.82  million.  Shandong  Province  borders  Hebei \nProvince to the north, and faces Bohai Bay and the Yellow Sea to the east. Since 1990, provincial \nGDP has grown at more than 10% per year on average. Shandong accounted for about 11% of the \nnational GDP in 2004.  \n \n9. \nThe  northwestern  part  of  Shandong  Province\u2014the  HRB  portion\u2014covers  approximately \n26,000  km2  and  includes  four  municipalities  (Binzhou,  Dezhou,  Jinan,  and  Liaocheng)  with  26 \ncounties and a population of 15.5 million. As in other parts of the HRB, groundwater overdraft and \npollution are threatening the sustainable use of aquifers in Shandong. Monitoring records from 180 \nwater quality control sections in the SHRB show that most sections monitored are class V or worse, \nwith a few sections rated class IV. Only one third of urban wastewater is being treated, and the rate \nof wastewater treatment and reuse is significantly lower. Solid waste infrastructure and sanitation \nservices are deficient in most cities and counties in Shandong, putting public health at risk. \n \n10. \nSHRB  consists  of  two  river  systems,  the  Zhang\u2013Wei-Nan  and  the  Tuhai\u2013Majia.  The \nproposed project areas are mainly in the Tuhai\u2013Majia system, and include the Dehuixin, Majia, and \nTuhai tributaries. Most sections in these rivers and tributaries are classified as worse than class V.  \n \n11. \nSPG recognizes the need to address environmental pollution. Investments in environmental \ninfrastructure (water supply and sanitation, water conservation, and environmental management) in \nShandong Province reportedly totaled about $3.2 billion over the past 4 years, which is equivalent \nto 2.6% of provincial GDP. Wastewater charges are being increased gradually to cover the full cost \nplus a reasonable profit margin to provide commercial incentives to invest in wastewater treatment \nfacilities.  However,  to  enhance  the  quality  of  urban  life  and  ensure  a  sustainable  foundation  for \neconomic  growth  in  the  entire  SHRB,  more  investment  and  institutional  reforms  are  required  to \naddress wastewater and solid waste pollution control.  \n \nB. \n \n12. \nKey problems and opportunities include (i) groundwater and surface water pollution in the \nSHRB, (ii) scarcity of good quality water resources, (iii) inadequate wastewater treatment capacity, \n(iv) lack of integrated management for industrial and municipal wastewaters, (v) inadequate solid \nwaste  management  (SWM)  facilities  and  services,  (vi)  need  to  enhance  efficiency  of  industries \nthrough adoption of clean production technologies, and (vii) need to build operational efficiencies \nand managerial capacities of the utilities. \n \nThe  HRB  Plan.  The  Government  recognizes  that  adequate  environmental  protection  and \n13. \npollution control are prerequisites for sustainable economic growth. The HRB has been identified \n                                                 \n6   The  HRB  also  includes  the  provinces  of  Hebei,  Henan,  Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region,  Shanxi,  and  the \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nmunicipalities of Beijing and Tianjin.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\n \n\n3\n\nthrough \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Construction, \n\nas one of three river basins and three lake basins in the PRC with the highest priority for improving \nwater  quality.  The  HRB  Plan,  an  action  program  under  the  PRC\u2019s  Green  Plan,7 sets  pollution \ncontrol targets for 2000 and 2010. The key parameters used for water quality planning are annual \nchemical oxygen demand (COD)8 and ammonia nitrogen loads.  \n \nthe  provincial  and  municipal  construction \n14. \ncommissions,  is  responsible  for  overseeing  urban  plans  for  major  cities,  including  plans  and \ninvestments  for  urban  wastewater  treatment  and  water  resources  protection.  The  State \nEnvironmental Protection Administration, through its policies and programs, plays an important role \nin the development of sound environmental practices in the PRC water sector.  \n \nThe T5YP and ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program9 for the PRC prioritize investments for \n15. \nimproving  environmental  management,  water  conservation,  and  reducing  water  pollution.  The \nGovernment  plans  to  (i)  increase  centralized  urban  wastewater  treatment  during  the  T5YP  by  26 \nmillion cubic meters (m3), (ii) raise the treatment rate of municipal wastewater from 34% to 45%, \nand  (iii) increase  the  use  of  recycled  water  by  industries  from  50%  in  2000  to  60%  in  2005.  \nEnvironmental  protection  continues  to  be  important  focus  of  the  Government  in  the  11th  5-Year \nPlan (2006\u20132010). \n \n16. \nThe  SHRB  Plan  sets  the  standards  for  pollutant  discharges  from  water  sub-basins, \nincluding  those  from  solid  waste.  Under  this  plan,  all  municipalities  and  counties  are  required  to \ntake the following actions on pollution control: (i) surface waters supplying raw water for urban use \nare  required  to  meet  class  III;  (ii)  water  quality  in  the  main  rivers  and  canals  needs  to  improve \nbefore 2006, with target reductions in pollutant discharges of COD;10 (iii) 45% of urban wastewater \nmust  receive  secondary  treatment;  (iv)  paper  mills  are  required  to  meet  industrial  discharge \nstandards;11 and (v) solid waste pollution must be controlled, while construction of SWM facilities is \naccelerated. \n \nProject  Rationale. With the lack of environmental infrastructure, particularly in secondary \n17. \ncities and counties, and inadequate management of the wastewater and solid waste services, SPG \nwould  have  difficulty  achieving  the  pollution  control  targets  in  the  SHRB  Plan.  The  Project  will  (i) \nsupport  institutional  changes  and  physical  investments  to  reduce  the  high  levels  of  untreated \nwastewater; (ii) adopt cleaner technologies, and promote water reuse to augment water resources; \nand (iii) control non-point source of pollution through effective SWM. The Project is a major urban \ninfrastructure initiative under Shandong\u2019s T5YP.  \n \nAddressing urban environmental problems and water resources protection is a high priority \n18. \nin ADB\u2019s  Country Strategy and Program for the PRC. The Project builds on experience gained and \nlessons learned from ADB\u2019s past and current activities in the wastewater sector and environmental \nimprovement initiatives in the HRB (footnote 2 and paras. 25\u201327).  \n \n19. \nThe  Project  aims  to  address  the  key  sectoral  issues  and  constraints  by  (i)  employing  an \nintegrated  multisector  approach  to  environmental  pollution  control  in  SHRB;  (ii)  supporting \ninstitutional reforms related to effective environmental pollution control management at local levels; \n\n                                                 \n7  The Green Plan was a key element in the Government\u2019s Ninth 5-Year Plan (1996\u20132000). \n8  COD, a measure of water quality, indicates the quantity of oxygen required in biological and non-biological oxidation of \nmaterials in water. The T5YP has set quantitative reduction targets for the COD and ammonia nitrogen in 2005, which \nare 26% and 22% from the 2000 levels, respectively. \n\n9   ADB. 2003. People\u2019s Republic of China: Country Strategy and Program (2004\u20132006). Manila. \n10  COD  discharges  into  rivers  are  required  to  be  reduced  to  69,300  tons  per  year,  and  ammonia  nitrogen  pollutant \n\ndischarges to 12,700 tons per year. \n\n11  They must reach 300 milligrams per liter (mg/l) COD in 2007 and 120 mg/l in 2010. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n  \n\n(iii)  addressing  water  conservation  issues;  (iv)  enhancing  capacity  in  environmental  pollution \ncontrol  through  improved  management  of  municipal,  industrial  wastewater,  and  solid  waste \nservices;  (v)  developing  sustainable  wastewater  treatment  and  SWM  companies;  and  (vi) \nevaluating realistic  options for  potential  private  sector  participation  (PSP). The use of previous \ninvestments in wastewater collection and treatment facilities will be optimized.12 The Project, which \nis  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Water  Policy, 13  will  help  the  Government  to  achieve  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals of environmental sustainability and increased access to improved sanitation. \n \n20. \nPolicy  Dialogue. In line with broader ADB\u2013Government policy dialogue, extensive project \npolicy  dialogue  focused  on  (i)  developing  an  integrated  approach  to  all  urban  waste  sources, \nincluding municipal and industrial wastewater and municipal solid waste; (ii) developing integrated \nmanagement  of  the  chain  from  collection  to  treatment  to  reuse  for  municipal  wastewater \nmanagement  (MWM)  and  SWM;  (iii)  controlling  industrial  pollution  through  utilization  of  clean \nproduction  technologies  and  resource  recovery;  (iv)  corporatizing  MWM  and  SWM,  and \ncommercialization  reforms; 14  (v)  developing  appropriate  PSP  strategies  for  MWM,  SWM,  and \nindustrial  enterprises;  (vi)  achieving  full  cost  recovery,  and  tariff  and  regulatory  reforms;  and  (vii) \nusing  the  clean  development  mechanism  (CDM)  to  provide  environmental  benefits  and  financial \nleverage to SWM for efficient extraction and utilization of landfill gas (LFG). SPG and ADB agreed \non  these  goals  for  MWM  and  SWM  operational  efficiency  and  sustainability.  In  addition,  they \nrecognized the need for gradual changes in institutional and local government structures, and the \nneed to ensure full participation of all stakeholders.  \n \n21.  While  national  Government\u2019s  policies  propound  market-oriented  reform  for  utility  services, \nthe absence of detailed guidelines has led to slow implementation of reforms at lower government \nlevels. Thus, policy discussions with SPG and local project management offices (LPMO) focused \non achieving (i) managerially independent and financially sustainable utility companies, (ii) reforms \nin  tariff-setting  and collection  mechanisms,  (iii) separate  regulatory  and  monitoring  functions,  and \n(iv) PSP potential.   \n \n22. \nPSP policy discussions focused on the appropriate objectives and pace of reforms for the \nProject\u2019s implementing agencies (IA). Talks also addressed the development of appropriate sector \nand  institutional  capacities  for  MWM  and  SWM  subprojects  to  achieve  equal  opportunities  for  all \nPSP stakeholders. As such, the project design catalyzes a PSP enabling environment through its \ninstitutional development program; and incorporates measures for introducing PSP to the Project\u2019s \nIAs, including the paper mills (Appendix 2 and Supplementary Appendix A). \n \nThe potential use of CDM for the SWM component was discussed extensively (Section III C \n23. \nand Appendix 3). The use of CDM will encourage foreign private sector involvement. Further, it will \nprovide financial incentives to the IAs to enhance (i) waste collection, (ii) storm water drainage and \nleachate treatment, (iii) LFG extraction and treatment, and (iv) methane utilization (approximately \n50% of LFG is methane, a valuable energy source). \n \n24.   Other policy issues discussed included (i) enforcement of local regulations to meet effluent \ndischarge standards, (ii) proper closure of landfills and waste storage lagoons, and (iii) the need for \n\n                                                 \n12  Many  of  the  wastewater  treatment  plants  (WWTP)  in  the  PRC  are  not  operating  at  full  capacity.  A  recent  study  by \nShandong  Provincial  Construction  Bureau  found  that  about  56%  of  the  treatment  plants  in  Shandong  Province  are \noperating below their respective design capacities. One stated reason is a slow pace of transition of WWTPs into self-\nsustaining enterprises. \n\n13  ADB 2001. Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank.

The People\u2019s Republic of China Resident Mission recently undertook a \nperformance portfolio review of the water supply, sanitation, and waste management sector. This \nprocess  identified  successes  and  deficiencies,  as  well  as  lessons  learned,  from  portfolio \nperformance. 16 Major  issues  identified  included  (i) delays  in  the  startup  of  projects  and  in  the \nprocurement  process,  (ii)  institutional  arrangements  for  project  implementation  and  sustainable \noperations,  and  (iii)  loan  savings  accompanied  by  cancellation  of  surplus  loan  amounts.  These \nissues were reviewed and the lessons learned were incorporated in the project design. \n \n26. \nLessons  learned  from  previous  ADB  projects  in  relevant  sectors,  as  well  as  from  two \nongoing  World  Bank  projects  implemented  by  SPG,  have  been  taken  into  consideration.  These \nincluded: (i) timely completion of the projects was achieved because of the strong commitment of \nthe    municipal/provincial  governments  in  making  the  project  facilities  operational  as  quickly  as \npossible;  (ii)  support  from  local  governments  and  consumers  for  tariff  adjustments  contributed  to \nproject sustainability; (iii) disbursements under the ADB loan and domestic onlending procedures, \nneed to be synchronized better; (iv) all parties concerned must take ownership of the projects, and \nclose coordination between the provincial/local governments and the utility companies is needed; \n(v)  utility  companies  need  to  be  encouraged  to  commercialize  their  operations;  (vi)  local \ngovernment\u2019s  regulatory  role  in  the  urban  infrastructure  sector  needs  to  improve;  and  (vii)  more \npractical  methodologies  for  the  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  need  to  be \nestablished during project design and implementation.   \n \n27. \nThe  build-operate-transfer  arrangements  for  wastewater  treatment  plants  (WWTP)  in \nShandong  Province  were  reviewed.  Notably,  in  the  absence  of  strong  regulatory  capacity  at  the \nlocal levels, the arrangements are linked to external factors (such as the term cycles of the local \nofficials)  and  they  do  not  result  in  fair  financial  and  contractual  arrangements.  These  lessons \nlearned, reflected in Supplementary Appendix B, have been considered in designing the Project.  \n \n28. \nExternal Assistance. Since 1993, ADB has provided 14 loans totaling about $1.4 billion for \nurban  environmental  improvement  and  pollution  control,  urban  water  supply,  and  wastewater \nmanagement  (Appendix  4).17 Specifically,  two  loans  in  the  HRB\u2014in  Hebei  Province  and  Tianjin \nmunicipality\u2014support pollution control and water quality improvement in the basin. ADB also has \nprovided  more  than  42  technical  assistance  (TA)  grants  for  about  $30  million  to  prepare  these \nprojects,  as  well  as  to  study  key  issues  in  water  resources  and  pollution  control,  water  supply, \nMWM, and SWM. ADB\u2019s assistance has contributed to (i) rational pricing of water and wastewater; \n(ii)  implementation  of  commercialization  in  utility  operations;  (iii)  improved  environmental \nmanagement, including SWM; (iv) formulation of effluent standards and development of regulatory \naspects; and (iv) introduction of PSP.18 \n \nThe World Bank, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and many bilateral \n29. \naid  agencies  also  have  provided  financial  and  technical  assistance  to  the  PRC  in  the  urban \n                                                 \n15  Local governments provide social assistance or minimum living guarantee levels for households  with incomes below \nthe  poverty  line  and  for  vulnerable  groups  of  population  to  protect  them  from  increases  in  waste-related  tariffs  and \nfees. \n\n16  ADB. 2005. Final Report PRC: Water Supply, Sanitation and Waste Management Portfolio Performance Review.  \n17  The  loans  were  provided  to  support  projects  in  Liaoning  Province  (Dalian  City),  Zhejiang  Province  (Wenzhou  City), \nFujian Province (Fuzhou City), Heilongjiang Province (Harbin City), Sichuan Province (Chengdu City), Hubei Province \n(Wuhan City), Hebei Province, Henan Province, Jilin Province, and Shanghai and Tianjin municipalities.  \n\n18  ADB provided a TA to help the Government prepare ADB\u2019s first PSP project in water supply (Chengdu). Subsequently, \nADB  provided  a  $26.5  million  loan  and  a  complementary  loan  of  $21.5  million  to  finance  the  project.  ADB  also  has \nprovided TA to strengthen policy reform on the use of market-based instruments in enhancing PSP in public utilities. A \nTA to assist the Nanjing Water Utility in exploring financing options in the commercial market is continuing. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n  \n\nenvironmental  protection  and  management  sector.  World  Bank  has  provided  financial  assistance \nfor 26 urban environmental improvement projects. JBIC is the largest bilateral source of aid to the \nPRC. Germany, through the German Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau is supporting SWM and MWM \nprojects. Other bilateral agencies from Australia, Canada, Finland, Italy, Norway, Sweden, United \nKingdom, and United States also support environmental management projects on a smaller scale \nthan multilateral development agencies. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  proposed  Project  has  nine  subprojects  grouped  into  four  components:  (i)  institutional \n\n \nA. \n \n30. \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  urban  environment  and  public  health  in \nShandong Province by reducing pollution of the HRB from different sources. The Project involves (i) \nimproving  municipal  wastewater  collection,  treatment,  and  reuse;  (ii)  providing  municipal  solid \nwaste  collection  and  disposal;  (iii)  adopting  clean  industrial  processes  and  improving  waste \nmanagement;  and  (iv)  supporting  the  institutional  development  of  utilities.  One  of  the  major \noutcomes  of  the  Project  is  improved  and  sustainable  wastewater  and  SWM  services  on \neconomically  and  environmentally  sound  principles  and  practices.  Another  outcome  is  the \nimplementation of an integrated approach for the management of municipal wastewater and solid \nwaste  point  and  non-point  pollution  sources.  The  proposed  Project  will  be  implemented  in \nsecondary cities and counties within four municipalities: Binzhou, Dezhou, Jinan, and Liaocheng.  \n \nB. \n \n31. \ndevelopment; (ii) MWM; (iii) SWM; and (iv) industrial wastewater management (IWM).  \n \n32. \nInstitutional  Development.  This  component  aims  to  develop  financially  sustainable, \noperationally  efficient,  and  managerially  autonomous  utility  companies  in  MWM  and  SWM \nsubprojects.  These  utilities  would  effectively  manage  project-created  assets  for  efficient  service \ndelivery. The institutions responsible for implementing the four MWM and three SWM subprojects \nare at an early stage of development and need assistance in streamlining their processes. \n \n33. \nThe  Shandong  Project  Management  Office  (SPMO),  LPMOs,  and  IAs  have  agreed  on  a \nroad map for institutional development under the Project, which includes a series of gradual steps \nfor  achieving  the  component\u2019s  objectives.  Utility  companies  for  each  of  the  four  MWM  and  three \nSWM  subprojects  will  be  established  and  registered  before  loan  negotiations.  Institutional \nconsultants will work with the LPMOs and IAs to develop and implement the road map during loan \nimplementation (Appendix 2).   \n \n34.  Municipal Wastewater Management. This component has four subprojects in:  \n \n(i) \n\nBinzhou  City  (Economic  Development  Zone),  which  includes  40,000  ton  per  day  (t/d) \ncapacity WWTP, 30,000 t/d reuse water treatment plant, approximately 65 kilometers (km) \nof sewer and 17 km of reuse water piping, and 30,000 t/d lift station; \nGaotang  County,  which  includes  40,000  t/d  WWTP  (phase  II),  40,000  t/d  reuse  water \ntreatment plant, 23 km of sewer, trunk sewer, and reuse water piping;  \nLinqing City, which includes 100,000 t/d WWTP, 50,000 t/d reuse water treatment plant, 12 \nkm of trunk sewer, reuse water piping, and treatment effluent discharge lines;19 and  \nShanghe County, which includes 40,000 t/d WWTP, 21 km of sewer, and two lift stations, \nwith a 10,000 t/d and 30,000 t/d capacity, respectively. \n\n(iv) \n\n(iii) \n\n(ii) \n\n                                                 \n19  This subproject also plays an important role in the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\n \n\n7\n\n35. \nThe  MWM  component  will  reduce  the  pollutants  discharged  into  HRB  immediately  upon \ncommissioning of the WWTPs (the average COD removal rate is 75%). With other HRB pollution \ncontrol measures long-term improvements are expected. This component will eliminate a source of \npollution to the local groundwater, and promote reuse treated wastewater to reduce the demand for \nwater resources. \n \n36. \nSolid  Waste  Management.  This component  includes three subprojects, each with a new \nlined  sanitary  landfill  with  leachate  collection  and  treatment  systems,  and  associated  equipment. \nThe subprojects are in (i) Linyi County, with a landfill with 200 t/d, 20-year capacity; (ii) Linqing City, \nwith 400 t/d, 15-year capacity; and (iii) Zouping County, with 400 t/d, 15-year capacity. \n \n37. \nCurrently,  the  typical  solid  waste  landfill  in  the  project  areas  is  an  unlined  open  dump, \nwhere  industrial  and  municipal  waste  is  dumped  without  control  or  daily  cover.  This  generates \nleachate,  as  well  as  odors  and  pests,  which  pose  significant  threats  to  the  local  groundwater, \nnearby  residents,  and  the  environment.  Upon  completion,  this  component  will  improve  local \nresidents\u2019 quality of life and eliminate a major source of pollution in the future. Pollution reduction to \nHRB will be indirect, but with long-term effects. \n \n38. \n \n\nIndustrial Wastewater Management. This component includes two paper mill subprojects: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nChangyuan Paper Mill, including 1,800 m3/day black liquor20 recovery system with 200 t/d \nof  solid  capacity,  43  t/d  sodium  hydroxide  recovery,  45,000  m3/day  middle-wastewater \ntreatment, 15,000 m3/day white liquor recycling system, and associated structures; and \nQuanlin Paper Mill, including 11,470 m3/day black liquor recovery system with 2,440 t/d of \nsolid capacity, 536 t/d sodium hydroxide and 485 t/d lime recovery systems.  \n\n \n39. \nPaper  and  pulp  production  is  a  major  industry  in  the  local  economy  (Quanlin  Paper  Mill \nemploys  11,000  people).  The  current  technological  processes  produce  \u201cblack  liquor\u201d,  and  the \ntreatment  processes  add  high  concentrations  of  unregulated  salts  to  the  effluent,  creating  a \ncontinuous  source  of  surface  and  groundwater  contamination.  Under  the  PRC\u2019s  pollution  control \npolicy,  the  paper  mills  are  required  to  comply  with  more  stringent  discharge  standards  by  2007. \nThe  mills  that  do  not  comply  would  be  shut  down,  with  major  socioeconomic  implications  for  the \nlocal  economies  and  livelihood  of  the  population. 21  An  effective  alkali 22  recovery  and  middle-\nwastewater  treatment  system  significantly  reduces  regulated  pollutants  (300,000  t/y  of  COD  and \n(200,000  t/y  of  inorganic  salts)  discharged  into  HRB,  improves  resource  recovery  (alkali  and \nenergy  in  steams),  and  eliminates  a  source  of  groundwater  pollution.  Investments  under  the \nProject  will  not  enhance  productive  capacity  of  the  paper  companies.  In  recognition  of  the \ncommercial nature of the IAs for IWM, the onlending arrangement for IWM will have shorter grace \nand repayment periods of 4 years and 8 years, respectively.23 \n \n40. \nThe  proposed  investments  were  determined  based  on  (i)  feasibility  studies  for  each \nsubproject, prepared by qualified domestic design institutes, after analysis of technical options for \n\n                                                 \n20  Black  liquor  is  a  by-product  of  paper  production,  containing  inorganic  chemicals  and  large  amounts  of  organic \nsubstances.  White  liquor  is  the  wastewater  from  making  paper,  which  contains  bleached  (white)  fibers  that  could  be \nrecovered for paper making. \n\n21 The livelihoods of many people associated with the paper mill\u2019s operations, including employees and their dependents, \n\nfarmers supplying wheat straw, wholesalers, and retailers, would be affected. \n\n22 Alkali is a general term for all basic chemicals that are not acid. \n23  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Policy  recognizes  that  \u201cwhen  properly  regulated  and  operating  under  competitive  market \nconditions,  the  private  sector  can  generally  use  resources  more  efficiently  than  the  public  sector.\u201d  However,  ADB \ninvolvement  in  funding  the  subproject  is  justified  on  three  grounds:  (i)  in  compliance  with  regulations,  and  \nenvironmental pollution control measures in addressing the existing externality; (ii) local socioeconomic considerations; \nand  (iii)  as  a  catalyst  in  improving  the  potential  of  the  enterprise  to  attract  the  private  sector  subsequent  to  its \nenvironmental upgrade. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n  \n\nSpecial Features \n\ntechnology,  capacity,  and  location  to  determine  least-cost  solutions;  (ii)  review  and  analysis  of \nfeasibility  studies  by  international  consultants;  and  (iii)  review  by  ADB.  The  project  design  is \nconsidered technically sound and draws on best engineering practices (Appendix 5). \n \nC. \n \n41. \nThe Project adopts a multisectoral approach to environmental pollution control, as well as \nintegrated management of the chain from collection and treatment to reuse for MWM, SWM, and \nIWM (paras. 19\u201320). Special features are described below (paras. 42\u201348). \n \n42. \nUse  of  Reclaimed  Wastewater.  This  is a new frontier in the PRC. In Shandong Province \nthe scarcity of water resources is inhibiting economic growth and undermining residents\u2019 quality of \nlife.  The  Project  provides  wastewater  reclamation  in  three  cities/counties  and  promotes  industrial \nuse of the reclaimed water, conserving good quality water for drinking or other domestic uses. \n \n43. \n Pioneering  Institutional  Arrangements  for  SWM.  The  PRC  has  made  considerable \nprogress  in  MWM  reforms,  though  SWM  institutional  reform  is  still  at  an  early  stage.  Only  a  few \ncities, such as Hangzhou and Chongqing, have started SWM corporatization reform. The creation \nof  landfills  alone  will  not  address  sustainability  issues,  and  a  focus  on  management  and \noperational  efficiencies  is  needed.  Under  the  Project,  transparent  and  efficient  tariff-setting  and \ncollection mechanisms will be implemented. Corporatization will establish three state-owned SWM \ncompanies with autonomous management, operations, and financial systems. These changes will \nfacilitate (i) the reflection of the true cost of all SWM services in tariffs; (ii) financial sustainability; (ii) \nPSP; and (iv) innovative processes, such as waste-to-energy (para. 44). \n \nCarbon  Emission  Credits  for  SWM.  During  project  preparation,  the  potential  for  using \n44. \nCDM for SWM subprojects was considered. CDM, created as one of three market mechanisms to \nmitigate  global  climate  change  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  of  the  United  Nations  Framework \nConvention on Climate Change, is intended as a \u201cwin-win\u201d solution to reducing global greenhouse \ngas (GHG) emissions and promoting sustainable development (Appendix 3).  \n \n45. \nBased on preliminary data and under a conservative scenario, the three SWM subprojects \nhave the potential to reduce 1.2 million\u20131.6 million tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent (tCO2e) during \nthe  first  10  years  of  the  Project.24 The  financial  value  of  these  emission  reductions  (ER)  would \nrange  from  $8  million  to  $16  million,  assuming  a  price  of  $6.5\u2013$10  per  tCO2e. 25 ERs  will  be \nachieved  by  reducing  the  venting  into  the  atmosphere  of  methane,  a  highly  potent  GHG  that \ncomprises approximately 50% of LFG; and displacement of more carbon-intensive fuels, such as \ncoal used in boilers. The potential financial incentive from the application of the CDM to the SWM \ncomponent  will  (i)  promote  significant  improvement  in  solid  waste  collection  and  management \nefficiency,  (ii)  address  technological  barriers  to  efficient  extraction  and  utilization  of  LFG,  and  (iii) \nalleviate financial burdens for the use of LFG as fuel.  \n \nTo  maximize  the  future  financial  benefits  of  the  CDM,  sufficient  budget  to  enhance \n46. \nefficiency  of  LFG  collection,  utilization,  and  destruction  has  been  allocated  for  the  SWM \nsubprojects. At the request of the SPMO and SWM IAs, ADB conducted further technical, financial, \nand  institutional  due  diligence  on  the  subject.  The  CDM  feature  of  the  SWM  component  was \nconfirmed  at  appraisal.  The  SPMO  will  act  as  the  representative  for  the  SWM  subprojects  in \nnegotiating  with  potential  buyers  of  carbon  credits  resulting  from  the  application  of  CDM.  To \nenhance the value of the Project to carbon credit buyers and achieve better contract terms for the \n\n                                                 \n24 Once  emission  reductions  (ER)  are  verified  by  a  third  party  and  registered  with  the  CDM  executive  board,  they  are \ncalled certified emission reductions. ERs and certified emission reductions often are referred to as \u201ccarbon credits\u201d. \n25 Financial  value  might  be  much  higher,  with  European  Union  emission  allowance  prices  ranging  near  \u20ac20  per  tCO2e \n\nsince the Kyoto Protocol took effect in February 2005. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\n \n\n9\n\nIAs,  ADB\u2019s  CDM  facility  will  provide  comprehensive  support  to  the  Project  to  develop  CDM \ndocumentation and conduct capacity-building seminars before loan effectiveness. This support will \nfocus  on  the  design  and  operation  of  landfills  with  enhanced  LFG  recovery,  and  utilization  and \nimprovement in SWM management efficiency. \n \nAdoption  of  Clean  Technology  for  Paper  Mills. Under the IWM component, the Project \n47. \nwill modernize the processes of the two paper mills to incorporate cleaner technology. Aside from \nthe  direct  reduction  of  conventional  pollutants,  such  as  COD,  biochemical  oxygen  demand,  and \nammonia,  in  their  WWTPs,  the  Project  will  (i)  facilitate  the  reuse  of  steam  energy  and  cooking \nchemicals,  (ii)  conserve  chemicals  that  otherwise  would  be  consumed  for  wastewater  treatment, \nand (iii) prevent a large amount of unregulated salts from entering the HRB.  \n \n48. \nPotential  for  PSP.  The  institutional  development  component  incorporates  realistic  PSP \nstrategies  for  the  smaller  cities/counties,  including  measures  to  assess  PSP  options  relevant  for \neach  IA.  PSP  options  include  operations  and  management  (O&M)  contracts,  joint  ventures,  and \nothers  as  applicable.  PSP  action  plans  for  most  IAs  will  be  completed  within  2  years  from  loan \neffectiveness,  with  implementation  to  start  following  agreement  with  SPG  and  ADB  (Appendix  2 \nand Supplementary Appendix A). For the IWM (paper mills) and Binzhou MWM subprojects, PSP \nplans  will  be  developed  within  18  months  and  implementation  will  begin  by  the  third  year.  The \nformulation of specific PSP strategies for each MWM, SWM, and IWM IAs can be models for future \nutility reforms in the PRC. \n \nD. \n \n49. \nin Table 1.  \n \n\nThe project cost is estimated at $160.36 million equivalent.

The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; \nan  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility  and  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  year;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \n51. \nThe  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an \nassurance  that  the  Government  made  these  choices  independently  and  did  not  rely  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB.   \n \nThe ADB loan will cover about 49.9% of project cost (or 76.1% of the foreign exchange cost \n52. \nand 0.3% of the local currency cost). The Borrower will be the PRC, which will relend to SPG on \nthe  same  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan.  SPG  will  onlend  to  municipal \ngovernments, which will onlend to city and county governments. The city and county governments \nthen  will  onlend  to  the  IAs.  SPG  will  retain  $1.5  million  of  the  loan  proceeds  for  capacity \nbuilding/training programs under the Project.26 All relending and onlending for the MWM and SWM \nsubprojects  will  be  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  the  ADB  loan.  The  onlending \narrangements for IWM subprojects will have a repayment period of 12 years including grace period \nof  4  years.  SPG  will  charge  a  service  fee  of  0.2%  to  MWM  and  SWM  components,  and  0.5%  to \npaper mills, as part of its onlending arrangements.27 The IAs will assume the foreign exchange and \ninterest rate variation risks for the ADB loan. Appendix 6 illustrates the flow of funds. \n \nCounterpart  funds  will  come  from  county/municipal  finance  bureaus  and  self-financing  by \n53. \nIAs. The IAs will fund the amounts required to be repaid to the city/county governments under the \nonlending  arrangements  through  user  charges  and  local  government  funds,  where  necessary. \nThese amounts, in turn, will be repaid to ADB through the municipal governments and SPG (Table \n2, Appendix 7, and Supplementary Appendix C). The nine subproject local governments confirmed \nin writing the availability of counterpart financing. \n \n54. \nExcept  for  civil  works,  disbursements  will  be  made  on  the  basis  of  up  to  100%  of  eligible \nclaims  received  up  to  the  allocated  amount.  Disbursements  for  civil  works  will  be  made  on  the \nbasis of the ratios specified in the Loan Agreement. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank Loan \nMunicipal/County Governments \nTotal \n\nTotal \n     80.00 \n     80.36 \n160.36 \n\n        % \n     49.90  \n     50.10  \n100.00 \n\n \n\n   Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n                                                 \n26  The cost of capacity building/training is $1.99 million, which is to be financed as follows: $1.50 million (ADB loan) and \n\n27  The fee will cover an interest gap arising due to different timing of withdrawals by Shandong Provincial Finance Bureau \n\n$0.49 (counterpart funds). \n\n(SPFB) from ADB, and by the IAs from SPFB.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n  \n\n11\n \n\n \n55.  SPG will be the Executing Agency responsible for overseeing implementation of the Project. \nIt has established a project leading group, headed by the vice governor of Shandong Province, and \nan SPMO headed by the deputy director general of Shandong Provincial Construction Bureau. The \nSPMO  includes  members  from  the  Shandong  Provincial  Finance  Bureau  (SPFB),  Shandong \nProvincial  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  and  Shandong  Provincial  Environmental \nProtection Bureau. The SPMO will oversee project implementation, and coordinate the work of the \nnine  IAs  and  local  governments.  The  SPMO  is  well-organized,  with  experience  implementing \nseveral World Bank-funded projects. \n \n \nEach of the six local city/county governments involved in the Project also has established a \n56. \nleading group and an LPMO to oversee project preparation and implementation in its locality. The \nLPMO  working  groups  comprise  local  governmental  representatives,  including  from  the  relevant \nconstruction  bureau,  development  and  reform  commission,  finance  bureau,  price  bureau,  and \nenvironmental  protection  bureau.  The  LPMOs  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  with  SPMO \nthroughout the Project. Until the IAs are fully established and operational, the LPMOs will assist in \noverseeing/implementing activities required in the early stages of the Project.  \n \nThe IAs will be responsible for implementation of the subprojects during the Project, as well \n57. \nas the subsequent operation of the constructed facilities and provision of the services. A financial \nmanagement  assessment  of  the  IAs  (Supplementary  Appendix  D)  determined  that  the  IWM  IAs \nwere registered and had adequate operational  systems and procedures in place. For MWM and \nSWM IAs, state-owned companies have been established and registered with structures, systems, \nprocesses,  and  financial  management  to  be  developed  under  the  institutional  development \ncomponent. An implementation arrangements chart is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n58. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  from  2006  to  2011  (Appendix  9  and  Supplementary \nAppendix  E).  This  schedule  is  considered  realistic  and  achievable,  because  the  project \nimplementation structure is in place and preparatory work is under way.  \n \n\n \n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n59. \nADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement.  Civil  works  valued  at  $10  million  equivalent  or  more  will  be  procured  using \ninternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  in  accordance  with  Government  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. Civil works for less than $10 million will be procured using national competitive \nbidding (NCB). Local contractors possess the experience, expertise, and capacity to undertake the \nproposed civil works. In accordance with ADB requirements, foreign contractors may participate in \nthe  bidding  for  NCB  contracts.  Equipment  and  materials  estimated  at  $1  million  or  more  will  be \nprocured  using  international  competitive  bidding  procedures  and/or  NCB,  while  those  valued  at \nless  than  $1  million  will  be  procured  through  limited  international  bidding  procedures.  Goods \nvalued up to $100,000 will be procured through shopping. The internationally tendered equipment \npackages  for  the  main  process  equipment  will  include  the  technical  support  for  ensuring  system \ncoordination, as well as installation, testing, commissioning, and training. The procurement plan is \nin Appendix 10 and in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n  \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n60. \n SPG  will  select  and  engage  an  international  consulting  firm  in  association  with  domestic \nconsultants,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  consultants.  The  local  design  institutes \nwill  be  hired  by  IAs  to  be  funded  by  counterpart  funds  to  undertake  detailed  engineering  design \nand cost estimates. The international consulting firm will assist the SPMO, LPMOs, and the IAs in \nproject implementation and management, and related capacity building. The firm will be recruited \nusing ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection method. The Project will provide 51 person-months \nof  international  consulting  services  and  168  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services. \nConsulting services will cover (i) project management, predesign pilot studies, and implementation \nsupport;  (ii)  review  of  detailed  design  with  tender  documentation  and  bid  evaluation;  (iii) \nconstruction management and operating procedures; (iv) organization and operations structuring, \n(v)  development  of  financial  management,  management  information  system  (MIS),  and  human \nresource systems; (vi) corporate strategic planning, including tariff reforms, asset integration, and \nPSP; and (vii) social impact and environmental monitoring.  \n \nLeast  cost  selection  and/or  consultants\u2019  qualifications  selection  will  be  used  for  CDM \n61. \nimplementation  and  marketing.  The  scope  of  consulting  services  correspond  to  the  project \nobjectives  and  intended  outcomes,  the  multisector  nature  of  the  Project,  and  the  geographical \nspread  of  the  nine  IAs.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix G. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Action for Consultant Selection and Retroactive Financing \n\n \nAdvance  procurement  is  required  for  consulting  services  for  project  implementation  and \n62. \ntraining.  In  addition,  retroactive  financing  of  $1  million  equivalent  is  necessary  to  cover  the \nexpenditures  for  consulting  services  incurred  prior  to  loan  effectiveness,  but  not  earlier  than  the \nfirst day of loan appraisal or a maximum of 12 months prior to loan signing, whichever is later. The \nadvance recruitment of consultants will be carried out in conformity with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  early  recruitment  of \nconsultants does not commit ADB to approving or otherwise financing the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nResettlement Monitoring \n\n \n63. \nADB requires internal and external monitoring of implementation of resettlement plans (RP). \nSPMO will provide ADB with semi-annual reports on the progress of implementing the RPs. One \ninternational social development specialist under  consulting services will assist SPMO and IAs in \nfacilitating  the  internal  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  resettlement,  and  preparing  the  semiannual \nprogress reports. The SPMO and IAs will recruit an independent agency for semiannual monitoring \nand annual evaluation of land acquisition and resettlement until 2 years after the completion of land \nacquisition and resettlement. The external monitor will (i) conduct site visits, (ii) review resettlement \nprogress,  (iii)  implement  the  agreed  policy,  (iv)  restore  the  income  of  the  affected  people  (AP), \n(v) support  the  training  programs,  and  (vi)  make  recommendations  to  resolve  any  issues. \nMonitoring  and  evaluation  reports  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB,  SPMO,  and  IAs,  and \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s Web site.  \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n64. \nThe  ADB  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  procedures  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (January  2001).  To  expedite  project  implementation  through  timely \nrelease of loan proceeds, the SPFB (on behalf of SPG) will establish an imprest account promptly \nafter loan effectiveness at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. Disbursements from the imprest \naccount  will  be  supported  by  an  appropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related  documentation. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\n13\n \n\nThis  documentation  will  demonstrate,  among  other  things,  that  goods  and/or  services  were \nproduced in and procured from ADB member countries, and were eligible for ADB financing. The \nceiling and the initial amount to be deposited into the imprest account should not exceed 6 months \nof  estimated  expenditures,  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of \nexpenditures  procedure  will  be  used  to  reimburse  expenditures  and  liquidate  advances  not \nexceeding $200,000 equivalent per payment.  \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \nThe  SPMO  will  submit  semi-annual  and  annual  progress  reports  to  ADB,  indicating \n65. \nprogress  made  and  problems  encountered  during  the  review  period,  and  a  proposed  program  of \nactivities.  The  SPMO  will  ensure  that  reports  are  consolidated  and  submitted  to  ADB  in  a  timely \nmanner.  Within  three  (3)  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  the  SPMO,  with  support \nfrom  the  LPMOs  and  IAs,  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  with  details  about \nimplementation,  actual  costs  incurred  relative  to  estimates,  benefits,  progress  in  the  institutional \narea, and other information that ADB might request. \n \n \nThe  Executing  Agency  will  maintain  records  and  accounts that  will  identify  the  goods  and \n66. \nservices financed from the loan, expenditures incurred for the Project, and the use of local funds. \nThe  IAs  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  records.  The  project  accounts  and  financial \nstatements will be established and maintained in accordance with sound accounting principles and \npractices as prescribed by the Accounting Law of the PRC, which requires enterprises to prepare \nfinancial  statements  and  generally  follow  internationally  accepted  accounting  standards.  Project \naccounts and annual corporate financial statements for the IAs will be subject to an annual external \naudit  (and  subsequent  translation)  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  External  audits  will  be  carried \nout in accordance with the State Council-approved regulations for auditing (1993), and will have to \nmeet  ADB  requirements. The  annual  audit  reports  will  include  an  auditor\u2019s  opinion  on  the  use  of \nthe  loan  proceeds  and  compliance  with  the  financial  covenants,  and  use  of  the  imprest  account \nand  statement  of  expenditures  procedures.  The  SPMO  will  provide  ADB  with  the  IAs'  annual \naudited  financial  statements,  audited  project  accounts,  audit  reports,  and  management  letters  in \nEnglish no later than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year during project implementation. \n \n67. \nThe Government was informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of audited accounts, which \ncovers failure to submit audited accounts and financial statements by due dates. If submission of a \nfinancial  statement  is  delayed  more  than  6  months,  a  commitment  letter  will  not  be  issued  (if \napplicable), and ADB might not approve new contract awards. If the delay is more than 12 months, \nloan disbursements might be suspended or the loan canceled. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n68. \nPPMS  indicators  were  disclosed  between  ADB  and  the  Borrower  and  it  was  agreed  that \nindicators  related  to  human  dimensions  are  more  relevant  than  physical  infrastructure  measures. \nThe  agreed  indicators  include  (i)  service  levels,  (ii)  treated  wastewater  quality,  (iii)  solid  waste \nservices,  (iv)  other  measures  of  operational  performance,  (v)  percentage  of  wastewater  collected \nand  treated,  (vi)  user  satisfaction  with  the  urban  environment,  and  (vii)  relevant  economic  and \nhealth  data  to  monitor  project  impacts.  The  relevance  and  practicability  of  data  collection  for  the \nindicators were confirmed with the SPMO and IAs.  \n \n \n69. \nAt  the  beginning  of  project  implementation,  the  SPMO,  LPMOs,  and  IAs,  supported  by \nconsultants,  will  develop  comprehensive  PPMS  procedures  to  generate  data  for  environmental, \nsocioeconomic, and health indicators to measure project impacts. ADB will provide grant support \nfor  a  pilot  and  demonstration  activity  (PDA),  one  objective  of  which  will  be  to  assist  with  the \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n  \n\ndevelopment  of  public  health  impact  indicators  (Supplementary  Appendix  H). 28 The  PPMS \nframework will be refined to confirm achievable targets and monitoring arrangements, and will be \nfinalized  no  later  than  6  months  after  project  inception.  Under  the  PPMS  framework,  LPMOs  will \nreport baseline and progress data at the requisite time intervals, including semiannual reporting on \nthe environmental management plan (EMP). With the assistance of the consultants, the SPMO will \nmonitor activities, analyze and consolidate the data through its MIS, and provide biannual PPMS \nmonitoring  reports  and  annual  reports  to  ADB  until  project  completion.  The  PPMS  reporting  will \ncontinue for 5 years after project completion. The PPMS will be designed with adequate flexibility \nto adopt remedial action regarding project design, schedules, activities, and development impacts. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n70. \nThe  Government,  SPG,  IAs,  and  ADB  will  review  the  Project  jointly  on  an  annual  basis  \nthroughout  implementation.  The  reviews  will  cover  institutional  development,  tariff  structures, \ndesign quality, construction standards, scope, overall implementation, resettlement, and status of \ncompliance  with  loan  covenants.  A  midterm  review  will  be  carried  out  during  the  third  year  of \nimplementation,  covering  a  comprehensive  discussion  of  the  Project\u2019s  institutional  development \ncomponent,  and  identifying  potential  loan  savings  and  items  for  reallocation  of  loan  proceeds. \nFeedback from the PPMS will be addressed during review missions. \n \n\n \n\n \n11. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to,  and  discussed  with,  the  Government  and \n71. \nSPG. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nreserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent, \ncollusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, relevant provisions \nof ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for \nthe Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include \nprovisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the \nExecuting Agency and the IAs, as well as all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service \nproviders as they relate to the Project. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n \nEnvironmental  Benefits.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  pollution  control  in  the  HRB, \n72. \nparticularly in the Tuhai\u2013Majia River system. The multisector and multimedia approach to pollution \nprevention  in  the  HRB  will  provide  the  most  sustainable  prospects  for  reducing  waterborne \npollution,  achieving  surface  water  quality  targets,  and  improving  living  conditions  in  the  project \nareas. \n \n73. \nThe  improved  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  systems  will  contribute  to  a  significant \nreduction  of  COD  (75%)  and  ammonia  nitrogen  (50%)  in  the  receiving  rivers,  enabling  each \nsubproject  area  to  attain  the  limits  set  by  the  T5YP.  The  industrial  reuse  of  treated  effluent  will \nmeet the need for water conservation facing the project areas.  \n \n74. \nUnder the SWM component, improvement of collection, transport, and disposal will address \nthe  need  to  treat  the  growing  volume  of  solid  waste  in  an  environmentally  sound  manner  and \nreduce contamination of the urban environment. The new sanitary landfills with leachate collection \nwill  minimize  the  waste  constituents  discharge  into  the  relevant  aquifers,  reducing  groundwater \ncontamination.  The  efficient  collection  of  LFG  with  the  use  of  CDM  will  reduce  environmental \n\n                                                 \n28 ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for Promoting Effective Water Management Policies and Practices\u2014Phase 3. Manila \n\n(TA 6123-REG, approved on 3 October). Under this RETA, $75,000 has been applied for to support this PDA. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\n15\n \n\nhazards  to  the  surrounding  communities,  while  destruction/utilization  of  methane  will  mitigate \nemissions of GHGs that contributes to global climate change. \n  \n75. \nThe  new  alkali  recovery  processes  for  the  paper  mills  will  reduce  significantly  volumes  of \nCOD.29 The  use  of  chemicals  in  the  pulp  paper  making  and  wastewater  treatment,  and  save  the \nenergy  and  water  consumption.  With  the  new  alkali  recovery  processes,  the  unlined  lagoons  for \ntreated  black  liquor  and  lignin30 storage  will  not  be  used  and  will  be  closed,  reducing  the  risks of \ngroundwater contamination.     \n \nThe  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  for  each  subproject  covers  all  phases  from \n76. \nproject design to construction and operation. All EIAs conclude that the Project will have positive \nimpacts  on  the  environment,  and  that  environmentally  adverse  impacts  generated  by  the  Project \ncould be reduced to acceptable levels through mitigation and monitoring measures specified in the \nEMP.  The  summary  EIA,  which  describes  the  environmental  impacts,  mitigation  measures,  and \nmonitoring plans, is in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n77. \nInstitutional  Reforms.  The  institutional  development  component  aims  to  establish \nmanagerially  autonomous,  operationally  efficient,  and  financially  self-sustaining  SWM  and  MWM \ncompanies.  This  is  a  pioneering  attempt  in  the  SWM  sector  in  the  PRC,  which  is  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s strategy to reduce its direct involvement in waste management. Key actions include \n(i)  legal  and  corporate  institutional  strengthening;  (ii)  strategic  planning  for  SWM  and  MWM \ncompanies, including phased integration of all value chain assets, corporate governance, and PSP \ndevelopment;  (iii)  development  of  operations  manual, \nfinancial  systems,  and  MIS;  (iv) \nestablishment  of  effective  tariff-setting  and  collection  systems;  and  (v)  training  of  key  staff \n(Supplementary Appendix J).  \n \n78. \nFor  IWM,  the  Project  will  catalyze  the  development  of  explicit  PSP  strategies  for  the  two \npaper  mills.  Consultants  will  work  with  the  two  companies  and  stakeholders  in  assessing  and \nrecommending  PSP  options,  as  a  basis  for  subsequent  implementation.  The  options  include  (i) \ncapital  markets  listing  on  Shanghai  or  a  similar  stock  exchange,  with  the  Government\u2019s  stake \nsubstantially  reduced;  (ii)  sale  of  equity  in  the  company  to  a  private  sector  entity;  and  (iii) \nestablishing joint ventures (Appendix 2 and Supplementary Appendix A).  \n \n79. \nHealth  Benefits. The causal link between poor sanitation and the incidence of water- and \nvector-related diseases is well established.31 The World Health Organization reports that sufficient \nevidence  exists  that  improved  water  supply  and  sanitation  significantly  affect  human  health.32 By \nimproving  environmental  and  sanitary  conditions  in  the  project  areas,  the  Project  is  expected  to \nreduce  the  incidence  of  water-  and  vector-related  diseases,  and  improve  living  conditions  of  the \npopulation. Based on project survey data of 1,200 respondents, health costs have been computed \nand health benefits have been estimated for 2009\u20132024 (Supplementary Appendix K). The PPMS, \nin  conjunction  with  the  proposed  PDA  (Supplementary  Appendix  H),  will  develop  indicators  for \nmonitoring the public health impact of the Project. \n \n80. \nPoverty Reduction. A poverty and social analysis (PSA) report was prepared focusing on \ndisadvantaged  stakeholders,  and  analyzing  positive  and  negative  social  impacts.  In  addition,  an \naffordability analysis was conducted on two representative household groups: the average-income \ngroup,  and  the  low-income  group.33 The  proposed  tariff  is  affordable  for  both  groups,  with  the \n                                                 \n29 About 292,200 t/y for Quanlin Paper Mill and 1,550 t/y for Changyuan Paper Mill. \n30 Lignin is a leftover substance from plants after the pulp-making process. \n31  See Supplementary Appendix D on definitions and disease categorization. \n32  Such improvements, for example, lead to potential 80\u2013100% reductions in morbidity for cholera and typhoid, and 40\u2013\n50% reductions for diarrheal diseases, dysentery, and gastroenteritis (World Health Organization. 1992. Seminar on \nWater and Public Health. Geneva).  \n\n33  Defined as the households\u2019 earning for the average of the lowest 10th percentile of income distribution.  \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n  \n\nmonthly water and wastewater bill accounting for 2.5% of the income of average family and 4.0% \nof that of the low-income households. The solid waste disposal bill accounts for 0.4% of the income \nof the average family and 1.0% of that of the low-income family. For the poorest households, the \ncity/county  governments  provide  minimum  living  standard  scheme  (MLSS),  which  includes  a \nprovision  for  lifeline  utility  services. 34  The  county/city  governments  also  provide  rebates  on \nwater/wastewater  bills  to  all  households  qualifying  for  social  assistance  with  the  recent  tariff \nincrease.   \n \n81. \nThe  Project  will  benefit  more  than  3.9  million  people  in  the  project  areas,  including  2.2 \nmillion  in  the  direct  project  area  and  1.7  million  in  the  indirect  project  area.  Of  the  beneficiary \npopulation, 6.5% live below the local poverty line. The PSA shows that the Project will contribute to \n(i)  improved  wastewater  and  solid  waste  facilities  and  services;  (ii)  reduced  air,  surface,  and \ngroundwater pollution; (iii) reduced risks of exposure to disease vectors; (iv) increased employment \nand income-generating activities; (v) reduced risks of people falling into poverty due to closure of \npaper mills; and (vi) improved urban living environment and increased quality of life. \n \n82. \nConstruction  works  under  the  Project  will  create  jobs  for  the  local  community,  particularly \nfor the poor. The Project will require an estimated 14,000 person-months of work, including 40% of \ndirect employment and 60% of indirect employment opportunities for local people including women \nand the poor. Women in the project area will be engaged for the public education and awareness \nprogram  to  promote  hygiene  education  and  social  acceptance  of  tariff  increases  (see  draft  PDA \nproposal). The PPMS, RPs, and EMP will include gender-disaggregated data where relevant. The \nsocioeconomic survey indicates that less than 1% of the population in the project areas belongs to \nethnic  minorities,  and  they  have  no  norms  and  settlements  distinct  from  the  major  ethnic  group. \nConsequently, ADB\u2019s Indigenous Peoples Policy does not apply to the Project (Appendix 11). \n \n83. \nLand Acquisition and Resettlement. The Project will affect people through (i) permanent \nacquisition  of  land  for  the  WWTP,  SWM,  and  pumping  stations;  (ii)  temporary  use  of  land  for \ninstallation of trunk sewers and water pipelines; and (iii) demolition of buildings. Seven of the nine \nsubprojects will have land acquisition and resettlement impacts affecting seven villages and three \nenterprises. Resettlement requirements have been considered carefully and incorporated into the \nproject  design.35 Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  estimated  to  cost  CNY71  million,  including \ncontingencies and taxes. \n \n84. \nRPs  for  the  seven  subprojects  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  PRC  Land \nAdministration Law (1998), the State Council Decision to Deepen Reform and Strictly Enforce Land \nAdministration  (2004),  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995).  The  RPs  provide  a \nsocioeconomic profile of APs and the scope of impacts. They also address (i) APs\u2019 entitlements to \ncompensation,  (ii)  legal  framework,  (iii)  public  consultations,  (iv)  grievance  procedures,  (v) \nrehabilitation  measures,  (vi)  budget,  and  (vii)  implementation  milestones.  SPG  has  confirmed  its \nsupport  for  the  resettlement  activities,  and  all  concerned  IAs  have  confirmed  funding.  The \nsummary RP is in Appendix 12. \n \n85. \nSPG  and  the  IAs  have  complied  with  the  ADB  full  disclosure  policy  for  the  resettlement \nactivities: (i) the draft RPs, or Resettlement Information Booklet, have been distributed to affected \nhouseholds  and  village  offices;  (ii)  the  final  RPs  will  be  made  available  in  village  offices  and \n\n                                                 \n34  The  county  and  city  governments  also  provide  rebate  on  water/wastewater  bills  to  households  qualifying  for  social \n\nassistance with the recent increase in water/wastewater tariffs. \n\n35  The  Project  will  acquire  permanently  about  101.5  hectares  (ha)  of  land,  of  which  37%  is  farmland.  Permanent  land \nacquisition will affect approximately 610 people in 123 households and three enterprises. The Project also will require \ntemporary  acquisition  of  39  ha  of  land,  most  of  which  is  urban  roadways.  No  households  will  need  to  be  relocated. \nAbout  30,450  m2  of  structures  will  be  demolished,  all  of  which  are  old  or  abandoned  buildings  belonging  to  the \nenterprises. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\n17\n \n\nresident committees; and (iii) the RPs have been uploaded to the ADB Web site. The respective \nIAs  will  establish  project  resettlement  units  for  supervising  implementation,  continuing  public \nconsultation, monitoring progress, and responding to grievances. Resettlement training workshops \nwere  held  for  local  government  officials,  local  land  departments,  and  the  IAs  during  project \npreparation. To ensure that APs have been compensated adequately and rehabilitated, SPG and \nthe  IAs  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  RP  implementation  through  semi-annual  and  annual  progress \nreports  until  resettlement  is  complete.  In  addition,  they  will  prepare  and  submit  resettlement \ncompletion  reports.  SPG  and  the  IAs  will  engage  an  independent  agency  for  semiannual \nmonitoring  and  annual  evaluation  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  until  2  years  after  the \ncompletion of resettlement.  \n \n86. \nFinancial  Analysis.  To  assess  the  financial  viability  and  sustainability  of  the  Project, \nfinancial projections have been prepared for each of the IAs in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \non  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  the  ADB.  Based \non  these  financial  projections,  operating  ratios,  current  ratios,  and  debt-equity  ratios  will  be  at \nacceptable levels for all IAs. A summary of the financial analysis is in Appendix 13, and details are \nprovided in Supplementary Appendix L. Currently, with multilayered and multi-agency involvement \nin the SWM, ascertaining the true cost of services is difficult. Under the Project, more transparent \nfee-setting  and  collection  mechanisms  will  be  implemented  in  conjunction  with  corporatization  so \nthat user fees will be sufficient to cover the costs of waste collection, transport, and disposal. The \nincorporation of CDM into SWM through LFG recovery has created an incremental revenue stream \nof emission credits, and has provided incentive to SWM companies to be more efficient in landfill \noperations. \n \n87. \nAn affordability analysis of MWM and SWM subprojects showed that proposed wastewater \ntariffs and solid waste fees should be set at levels affordable to average and poorer households. \nBased on the detailed assessment (Appendix 13), the potential risk that the proposed fees might \nexceed household affordability is considered minimal. An analysis of municipal finances indicates \nthat requirements for project counterpart funds in the cities/counties concerned are affordable and \nfunds have been earmarked by cities/counties to assure timely availability of counterpart funds.  \n \n88. \nThe financial evaluation of MWM and SWM subprojects was undertaken in real terms using \nconstant 2005 prices. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR), computed on an after-tax basis, \nranges  from  5%  to  8%  for  MWM  subprojects.  For  SWM  subprojects,  the  range  is  from  7.1%  to \n9.1%. This compares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 3.4%, which \nalso  was  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis.  Sensitivity  and  risk  analysis  indicates  that  the  FIRR  is \nrobust  under  adverse  conditions.  Financial  analysis  of  IWM  subprojects  indicates  the  financial \nsoundness of the IAs, which achieve minimum thresholds for debt service coverage.  \n \n89. \nEconomic Analysis. The economic analysis of the Project shows that the legal standards \nand environmental targets are consistent with economic principles for water quality management, \nand conform to international practices. The Project is an integral component of the SHRB Plan, as \nwell  as  of  the  municipal,  provincial,  and  basin-wide  environmental  programs  to  meet  the  water \nquality targets for the HRB and to achieve least-cost pollution control in the project areas. \n \n90.  Major  benefits  of  the  Project  resulting  from  improved  MWM  and  SWM  services  are  a \ncleaner and more sustainable urban environment. Disease prevention/mitigation and environment \ncleanup, as well as reduction in time lost to diseases, generated cost savings. Anticipated benefits \njustify undertaking the Project from the economic point of view. Economic internal rates of return \n(EIRR),  calculated  for  all  subprojects,  are  higher  than  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital \n(EOCC) of 12%. The following EIRRs were calculated: (i) for MWM subprojects, 17.5% for Binzhou, \n17.7%  for  Gaotang,  17.9%  for  Linqing,  and  15.8%  for  Shanghe;  (ii)  for  SWM  subprojects,  21.7% \nfor  Linqing,  19.4%  for  Linyi,  and  22.4%  for  Zouping;  and  (iii)  for  IWM  subprojects,  19.8%  for \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n  \n\nChangyuan  paper  mill  and  23.9%  for  Quanlin  paper  mill.  A  detailed  economic  analysis  is  in \nAppendix 14 and in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \n91. \nProject  Risks. Potential project risks relate mainly to institutional and financial factors: (i) \ninadequate  political  support  for  institutional  reforms  in  SWM  and  MWM  sectors,  corporatization, \nand  integration  process;  resistance  to  change  to  commercial  operations;  and  lack  of  staffing \nresources;  (ii)  resistance  to  required  tariff  setting/collection  mechanisms;  (iii)  low  user  fee \ncollections that threaten financial sustainability; and (iv) decline in private sector interest triggered \nby external factors. To mitigate these risks, a comprehensive institutional development program will \nbe developed and implemented in coordination with all relevant departments to ensure support for \nthe  proper  restructuring  of  SWM  sector.  Training  programs  for  the  new  companies  will  be \ndeveloped under the Project. The detailed tariff-setting/collection mechanisms will be developed in \na participatory way, with a view to strengthening the regulatory functions of the local authorities.   \n \n92. \nAnother  potential  risk  involves  weak  enforcement  of separate  collection  of  hazardous  and \nmunicipal  wastes,  and  pretreatment  of  industrial  wastewater.  Changes  in  design  standards  and \nenvironmental  compliance  requirements  to  be  introduced  in  the  11th  5-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010) \ncould  pose  another  risk.  However,  these  risks  will  be  minimized  by  (i)  developing  detailed \nguidelines  for  collection  and  reporting  procedures,  including  handling  of  hazardous  wastes;  (ii) \ntraining  waste  collectors  to  avoid  mixed  collection;  (iii)  implementing  spot  checks  and  surveys \naround  landfill  sites;  and  (iv)  collaboration  closely  with,  and  sharing  information  among,  local \nEnvironmental Protection Bureaus (EPBs) and provincial/country EPBs.  \n \n93. \nSustainability. The pollution reduction, institutional, and financial benefits of the Project are \nexpected to be sustainable, mainly because of the commitment at all levels of the Government to \npollution control in river basins, particularly in the HRB. Several other factors also will contribute to \nproject  sustainability:  (i)  the  actions  already  taken  to  establish  wastewater  companies  that  will \noperate on commercial basis, (ii) enactment of Tariff Regulation 1192 to ensure financial viability, \n(iii) financial covenants under the Project to ensure adequacy of tariffs, and (iv) provision of actions \nfor institutional development and capacity building under the Project.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n94. \nthe following assurances in the legal documents:36 \n \n(i) \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government and SPG have agreed to include \n\nEach  of  the  Linqing,  Linyi,  and  Zouping  SWM  companies  shall,  in  accordance  with  PRC \nenvironmental  requirements,  close  their  existing  solid  waste  landfills  (a)  by  31  December \n2007, (b) within 12 months from the commencement of Project landfill operations, and (c) \nwithin 18 months of the commencement of Project landfill operations, respectively.

These  plans  shall  be  acceptable  to  and  agreed  with  ADB,  and \nimplementation of agreed options shall (a) commence within 5 years of loan effectiveness \nfor the MWM and SWM IAs, and (b) commence within 3 years of loan effectiveness for the \nBinzhou MWM IA and the IWM IAs. \nIn an effort to formalize and streamline the tariff setting process and collection mechanisms, \neach  of  the  local  governments  shall  devise  an  individual  tariff  and  regulatory  reform  plan \nthat  (a)  establishes  clear  and  transparent  policies,  guidelines,  and  criteria  for  setting  tariff \nrates,  including,  without  limitation,  procedures  for  the  MWM  and  SWM  IAs  to  file  periodic \ntariff  adjustment  applications;  (b)  assesses \ntariff  collection \nmechanisms to be implemented between the MWM and SWM IAs and the appropriate end \nusers,  with  guidelines  for  such  tariffs  to  be  retained  by  the  MWM  and  SWM  IAs;  and  (c) \nconsiders the feasibility of direct agreements to be entered into between the MWM IAs and \nthe  relevant  water  suppliers  whereby  the  MWM  IAs  directly  receive  from  and  retain  the \nMWM tariffs collected by such water supply companies on behalf of the MWM IAs from end \nusers.  These  plans  shall  be  acceptable  to  and  agreed  with  ADB,  and  implementation  of \nagreed options shall commence within 5 years of loan effectiveness. \nPrior  to  31  December  2008,  each  of  the  local  governments  shall  establish  integrated \nregulatory systems that incorporate the relevant local pricing bureau, finance bureau, public \nutilities bureau, and other appropriate agencies to institute clear and transparent guidelines \nand  procedures  for  (a)  regulating  and  monitoring  MWM  and  SWM  IA  performance;  (b) \nsetting,  reviewing,  and  approving  proposed  MWM  and  SWM  tariff  increases  and \nadjustments; and (c) entering into performance-based contracts.  \n\nthe  options \n\nfor  direct \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  No entity, agency, or institution of any local government, nor any enterprise, regardless of \nownership, shall be granted (a) an exemption MWM and/or SWM tariffs, (b) a preferential \ntariff rate, or (c) excused for delays in payment of such MWM and/or SWM tariffs, without \npenalty. \nEach of the local governments, by 1 January 2011, shall establish, implement, and enforce \ntariffs for wastewater treatment and solid waste disposal, in each case, at full cost recovery \nlevels. Such tariffs shall (a) be phased in gradually; (b) be set at levels sufficient to cover \noperation and maintenance, depreciation, and debt service obligations, as well as provide a \nreasonable profit margin for the MWM and SWM IAs; (c) in the case of MWM subprojects, \nbe set at levels sufficient to cover integrated MWM operations, including collection, transfer, \nand  treatment;  (d)  in  the  case  of  SWM  subprojects,  be  set  at  levels  sufficient  to  cover \nintegrated SWM operations, including collection, transfer, disposal, and treatment; and (e) \nbe collected in accordance with the tariff collection mechanisms devised and implemented \nunder the relevant tariff and regulatory reform plans. \nEach of the local governments, during the period where full cost recovery tariffs are being \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  clause  (ix)  above,  shall  provide  adequate  financial \n\n(x) \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n  \n\n(xi) \n\nresources  and/or  financial  subsidies  to  each  of  the  MWM  and  SWM  IAs  as  required  for \nsuch IAs to satisfy their respective operation and maintenance costs, debt service coverage \nrequirements,  and  current  depreciation  costs.    Such  financial  resources  and/or  subsidies \nshall  be  phased  out  gradually  to  ensure  that  there  is  no  negative  impact  on  the  financial \nsustainability of the MWM or SWM IAs. \nEach  local  government  shall  (a)  continue  to  provide  the  existing  solid  waste  disposal  and \nwastewater tariff waiver in accordance with the minimum living social standards so as not to \nhave an adverse effect on the living standard of the poor, (b) review the impact of increased \nwastewater  and  solid  waste  tariffs  on  the  poor  to  ensure  that  the  poor  are  provided  the \nsame  level  of  service  as  other  members  of  the  community,  and  (c)  provide  the  required \nwater and wastewater rebates to qualifying households.  \n\n(xii)  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  SPMO  and  the  SWM  IAs  shall  enter  into  a  legally \nbinding  agreement,  in  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  pursuant  to  which  the \nparties agree that SPMO shall have the exclusive right to represent the interests of each of \nthe  SWM  IAs  in  the  negotiations  with  potential  purchasers  of  carbon  emissions  from  the \nSWM subprojects. \n\n(xiii)  Each of the IAs shall maintain (a) a minimum debt service ratio of 1.2:1, (b) a debt-equity \nratio of 70:30, and (c) a minimum current ratio of 2:1.

The implementing agencies (IA) \nfor  municipal  wastewater  management  (MWM)  and  solid  waste  management  (SWM)  are  in  the \nearly  stages  of  development.  As  such,  this  component  initially  establishes  and  strengthens \ninstitutional  structures  for  the  IAs.  This  component  focuses  on  assisting  the  IAs  to  financial  and \noperational  independence,  efficiency,  and  sustainability;  as  well  as  on  strategic  development, \nincluding private sector participation (PSP).  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  IAs\u2019  financial  management  and  institutional  capacity  were  assessed  using  financial \nmanagement  questionnaires,  which  cover  (i)  legal  structure;  (ii)  operational  structure;  (iii) \nprocesses;  and  (iv)  financial,  human  resources,  and  MIS  systems  (Supplementary  Appendix  E). \nOne  MWM  IA  is  registered  as  a  company  (though  it  is  non-operational),  while  the  other  three \nMWMs  IAs  and  three  SWM  IAs  are  to  be  registered  before  loan  negotiations.  Thus,  the  seven \nMWM  and  SWM  companies  require  organizational,  operational,  human  resources,  and  MIS \nsystems; as well as corporate planning development.  \n \n3. \nThe  MWM  and  SWM  value  chain  assets  (e.g.,  existing  sewerage  network,  and  new \ntreatment  plants  and  landfills)  and  processes  are  industrial  wastewater  management  (IWM) \nsubprojects  for  existing  paper  mills.  These  have  company  structures,  operational  procedures, \nfinancial management, and human resources development systems. \n \nLocal  project  management  offices  (LPMO)  have  been  set  up  to  monitor  the  project \n4. \nconstruction phase. The LPMOs are in the early stages of development, with only senior level staff \nassigned,  and  require  additional  staffing  and  training  in  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nprocedures.  While  the  Shandong  Project  Management  Office  (SPMO)  has  experience  with  the \nWorld  Bank,  it  does  not  have  any  experience  with  implementing  ADB  loans.  Thus,  the  SPMO \nneeds strengthening during project implementation. \n \nB. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  \u201cmarketization  reform  policy\u201d  for  the  MWM  and  SWM  sectors  aims  to \n5. \nincrease  efficiencies,  reduce  overhead  costs,  achieve  true  cost  accounting,  and  improve  service \ndelivery.1 The  policy  advocates  operational  and  managerial  reforms  to  create  sustainable  MWM \nand  SWM  utilities  through  the  promotion  of  market  economy  principles,  PSP,  and  user  fees  that \nallow  full  cost  recovery.2 Some  large  city  utilities  have  been  reformed  into  such  market-oriented \ncompanies,  promoting  competition  and  commercialization  of  operations  management.  However, \nwith few detailed guidelines for implementing the national policy, the fourth-tier local governments \nneed assistance in implementing such reforms, especially in the SWM sector.  \n \n6. \nFor  the  MWM  and  SWM  subprojects,  the  goal  of  institutional  development  is  to  establish \nfinancially  sustainable,  operationally  efficient,  and  managerially  autonomous  enterprises  that  can \naddress long-term sector requirements. Discussions with the Government produced an agreement \non corporatization, tariff reform, PSP, and accountability for operations and debt repayment to the \nenterprises  for  MWM  and  SWM  sectors,  which  require  short-term  Government  support.  For  the \nIWM subprojects, the focus is on the evaluation and implementation of PSP.  \n\nProposed Institutional Strengthening Program \n\n                                                 \n1 Marketization implies a gradual move towards commercial operations and include accountability of management, cost \n\nrecovery, operational efficiency, and financial sustainability with gradual reduction in government subsidies. \n\n2 ADB. 2003.

The \nconceptualized structure for each SWM subproject includes integrating, eventually, the entire value \nchain (waste collection to landfill treatment) into one corporate body. This takes into consideration \n(i)  separating  monitoring  and  regulation  from  operations;  (ii)  identifying  a  single  body  to  be \naccountable for all SWM functions; (iii) generating alternative sources of funds in the long term; (iv) \ndeveloping  PSP  in  the  long  term,  including  outsourcing  and  joint  ventures  (JVs)  for  future  SWM \noperations;  and  (v)  ensuring  financial  sustainability,  managerial  efficiency,  and  good  governance \n(Supplementary Appendix H). \n \nA  road  map  has  been  developed  that  presents  a  gradual  and  phased  approach  for  the \n8. \nsubprojects. From this road map, actions to be undertaken during loan implementation have been \nidentified (Figure A2.1). \n \nFor the MWM and SWM IAs, the short-term goal is the establishment of a well-structured \n9. \nand efficient company to manage project-created assets. The medium-term goal is to consolidate \nthe  existing  and  new  (i.e.,  the  project  facilities)  MWM  and  SWM  assets  and  processes  in  the \nproject  areas,  formalize  tariff-setting  processes,  and  structure  tariff-collection  mechanisms. \nInstitutional  development  consultants  will  take  specific  actions  during  loan  implementation, \nincluding  (i)  legal  and  organizational  structuring,  (ii)  operational  structuring,  (iii)  strategic \norganizational  planning  (developing  a  time-based  action  plan),  and  (iv)  capacity  building  at  the \nlocal  government  level.  The  detailed  action  steps  matrix  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  H.  An \nestimated  12  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  36  person-months  of \ndomestic consulting services will be needed for the institutional development activities. \n \nC. \n\nProposed PSP Strategy for MWM and SWM   \n\n10. \nADB  policy  considers  private  sector  development  to  be  \u201ccrucial  for  the  long-term,  rapid \neconomic  growth  of  a  country,  a  necessary  condition  for  sustained  poverty  reduction.\u201d 3 \nRecognizing  this  strategy,  the  Project  evaluated  the  introduction  of  PSP  into  the  subprojects \nthrough extensive dialogue with the provincial and local governments, IAs, and public and private \nsector entities in the relevant sectors. As discussed in Supplementary Appendix A, the Project also \nresearched past experiences and best practices.  \n \nInvolving the private sector in the subprojects before construction is considered unrealistic, \n11. \nin light of the (i) small-scale capacities of subprojects; (ii) subproject locations in counties with low \neconomic  development;  (iii)  local  government  capacity  constraints  and  limited  experience  with \ncommercial  market  principles  and  practices,  performance  benchmarks,  and  regulatory  and  tariff \nstructures;  (iv)  inefficient  and  fragmented  nature  of  MWM  and  SWM  operations  without  links  to \nexisting MWM sewerage networks, SWM collection, and transfer processes; and (v) likelihood that \nPSP  in  new  asset  construction  only  would  lead  to  potential  underinvestment  in  assets  remaining \noutside  the  scope  of  an  early  PSP.  Stakeholders  have  identified  distortions  where  PSP  was \nintroduced without  sufficient  regard  to  sector  reform.  This  has  led  to  new  assets  operating  under \ncapacity and paying for fixed usage capacities per contract, poor performance monitoring, etc. \n \n12. \nThe  institutional  development  component,  therefore,  addresses  overall  sector  structure \nissues to implicitly catalyze sustainable PSP in the subprojects. Under this component, consultants \nwill assist each MWM and SWM IA in evaluating potential options for PSP, leading to a viable PSP \noption  with  a  realistic  and  detailed  timetable  for  implementation.  PSP  options  that  can  be \nconsidered include (i) joint ventures between MWM IAs and private sector entities; (ii) development \nof private holding company structures for all MWM and/or SWM assets in the local areas, with PSP \n\n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2000. Private Sector Development Strategy. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nProposed PSP Strategy for IWM: Quanlin and Changyuan Paper Mills \n\noptions at the holding company level; (iii) flotation of larger holding companies; and (iv) operations \nand  maintenance  (O&M)  contracts  for  SWM  landfills/treatment  plants.  The  IAs  expressed  keen \ninterest in developing these PSP options.  \n \n13. \nThe PSP action plan for each MWM/SWM IA is to be completed within 2 years from loan \neffectiveness.  Once  approved  by  ADB  and  SPG,  the  recommended  PSP  option  will  be \nimplemented  within  5  years  from  loan  effectiveness.  Since  a  successful  listing  process  or  JV \nagreement also depends on external factors, however, completion of the chosen PSP option might \ntake more time.  \n \n14. \nBinzhou MWM. The Binzhou MWM subproject has a more conducive environment for PSP \nsince  it  has  a  captive  customer  base  in  the  economic  development  zone,  and  the  LPMO  and  IA \nhave  expressed  strong  interest  in  PSP.  Thus,  in  addition  to  corporatization,  an  accelerated  PSP \nstrategy formation is to be pursued, probably leading to private sector equity involvement in the IA. \nLoan  consultants,  therefore,  will  evaluate  and  recommend  time-bound  options  for  PSP,  including \nJV and other potential PSP arrangements, within 18 months of loan effectiveness. Following ADB \nand SPG approval, implementation of the agreed PSP option is to commence in the third year from \nloan effectiveness.  \n \nD. \n \n15. \nPulp  and  paper  mills  are  large  contributors  to  environmental  pollution  in  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China\u2019s (PRC). Thus, an effective environmental pollution control project is needed to \naddress this issue. Noting that the non-wood pulping sector produces 44% of all industrial chemical \noxygen demand (COD) pollutants, the World Bank has provided financial support for the Chengwu \nPaper  Mills  in  Anhui  Province.4 Quanlin  Paper  Mill\u2019s  discharges  of  74,900  cubic  meter  per  day \n(m3/day) of water to the river only meet current discharge standards of 300 milligram per liter (mg/l) \nCOD  through  existing  water  treatment  processes.  Changyuan  paper  mill\u2019s  discharges  of  20,000 \nm3/day  are  at  400  mg/l  COD  levels.  As  both  will  be  unable  to  comply  with  the  new  discharge \nstandards of 120 mg/l COD levels by 2010, they require new and more effective water treatment \nsystems.  \n \nPrivate  sector  funding  for  the  required  environmental  improvements  is  not  available, \n16. \nbecause commercial banks are unwilling to lend to projects that do not generate revenue, such as \nenvironmental  pollution  control  improvements.  Further,  in  the  absence  of  commercial  bank \nfinancing,  the  threat  of  closure  will  dampen  potential  interest  from  private  sector  entities  at  this \nstage. \n \n17. \nIf  the  required  environmental  measures  are  not  implemented,  the  potential  closure  of  the \npaper mills poses a major threat to the local economies. In addition to employees and their families, \nlocal  farmers  supplying  straw  are  dependent  on  the  paper  mills  for  employment  and  income. \nQuanlin  employs  11,000  and  Changyuan  employs  1,500,  and  both  mills  support  large  pulp \nplantations  in  their  counties.  The  Project  will  fund  the  construction  of  effective  black  liquor \ntreatment  and  wastewater  treatment  facilities  at  the  two  paper  mills  to  (i) serve  as  environmental \npollution control measures in addressing the existing externality, (ii) protect the local economy, and \n(iii)  catalyze  improvements  in  the  potential  of  the  enterprise  to  attract  PSP  following  its \nenvironmental upgrade.  \n \nThe  institutional  development  component  explicitly  includes  introducing  PSP  in  the  two \n18. \npaper  mills.  Both  companies  have  agreed  to  develop  a  time-bound  strategy  for  PSP,  which  will \n\n                                                 \n4 World Bank. 1997.

Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n27\n\ninclude (i) capital markets listing on the Shanghai or similar stock exchange, with the Government \nstake  reduced  substantially;  (ii)  sale  of  Government  equity  to  a  private  sector  entity;  and  (iii) \nstrategic  alliance  with  a  private  sector  entity,  combined  with  a  contracting  out  and  outsourcing \nstrategy. The first option was considered more likely for Quanlin paper mill, while the third option \nseemed more likely for the smaller Changyuan paper mill.  \n \n19. \nDuring project implementation, the consultants will work with Quanlin and Changyuan, local \ngovernments,  and  potential  private  sector  entities  to  evaluate  PSP  options.  The  consultants  will \nrecommend a viable PSP strategy and time-bound action plan for implementing the approved PSP \noption.  The  evaluation  will  include  (i)  stock  market  regulatory  requirements,  (ii)  market  demand \nassessment, (iii) employee equity participation, and (iv) discussions with private sector entities on \nvaluations.  The  recommended  PSP  strategy  and  action  plan  will  be  completed  and  submitted  to \nSPMO,  local  governments,  and  ADB  within  18  months  from  loan  effectiveness.  The  concerned \nparties will review, discuss, and approve them within 6 months. The agreed PSP strategy then will \nbe implemented starting in third year from loan effectiveness.  \n \nA  capital  market  listing  would  involve  (i)  applying  for  regulatory  clearance  for  a  stock \n20. \nexchange  (SE)  listing,  (ii)  organizing  structural  changes  as  required,  (iii)  appointing  investment \nbanks  and  legal  advisors,  and  (iv)  marketing  and  promotions.  Any  further  ADB  involvement  to \nassist in supporting the implementation process will be considered at the midterm review.  \n \n21. \nThe  PSP  strategies  included  in  this  appendix  are  considered  realistic,  given  the  PRC\u2019s \nexperience in this sector in the PRC. As shown by Shandong Chenming Paper Mill, a former state-\nowned  enterprise  (SOE)  now  listed  domestically,  joint  ventures  and  stock  market  flotations  are \npossible. Therefore, the Project is catalyzing a move towards PSP for the two paper mills. In turn, \nthis is linked with funding the required environmental pollution control assets for IWMs to achieve \nthe pollution control targets in the Shandong Hai River Basin.  \n \n\n \n\n\f2\n8\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n2\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n  \n  \n\n \n\n                                                                                         Table A2: Institutional Development Road Map\n \nLoan Approval Period\n\n                     Loan Implementation Period  (2006\u20132010)\n\n                          Operational Period (from 2011)\n\nComponent 1 - SPMOs/Local Government PMOs\nStrengthening of SPMO and\n\nLPMOs (local govt.

The  Kyoto  Protocol  sets  targets  for \nindustrialized  countries  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions.  These  targets  became \nlegally  binding  on  16  February  2005.  The  CDM  is  intended  as  a  \u201cwin-win\u201d  solution  to  reducing \nglobal GHG emissions.  \n \n2. \nThe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) ratified the UNFCCC on 5 January 1993 and the \nKyoto Protocol on 30 August 2002. A designated national authority (DNA) has been established, \nwhich  is  co-chaired  by  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  (NDRC)  and  the \nMinistry of Science and Technology (MOST). Provisional CDM regulations have been issued, and \ntook effect in June 2004. With numerous projects under development, including three financed by \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  PRC  is  expected  to  become  one  of  the  largest  host \ncountries of the CDM.1    \n \n3. \nAs  part  of  ADB's  efforts  to  promote  clean  energy  initiatives  and  minimize  adverse  local, \nregional,  and  global  impacts,  the  CDM  facility  was  established  in  ADB  in  August  2003.  This \nfacility focuses on bridging the gaps in the evolving carbon market in the Asia and Pacific region. \nIt  also  assists  with  CDM  project  activity  identification,  development,  validation,  and  registration. \nThe facility does not purchase the emission reductions (ER), known as carbon credits. Rather, it \nplays the role of a facilitator in the carbon market by bringing in multiple buyers for negotiation. \n \n4. \nThe  Project  has  a  potential  to  reduce  GHG  emissions  and  benefit  from  the  use  of  the \nCDM. The ADB CDM facility identified the CDM potential of the solid waste management (SWM) \nsubprojects, as shown in Table A3.1. \n\n \nTable A3.1: Basic Characteristics of Proposed SWM Subprojects \nLand \nCapacity \nArea \n(t/day) \n(ha) \n\nService \npopulation \n2015 \n\nService Area \n(km2), 2010 \n\nDesign \nLife \n(yrs) \n\nTreatment \nProcess \n\nLeachate \nTreatment \n(m3/day) \n\n400 \n\n200 \n\n400 \n\nSanitary \nLandfill \nSanitary \nLandfill \nSanitary \nLandfill \n\n15 \n\n20 \n\n15 \n \n\n24.5 \n\n20.4 \n\n41.8 \n\n15.0 \n\n40.0 \n\n24.8 \n\n417,000 \n\n178,000 \n\n382,000 \n\n150 \n\n80 \n\n150 \n\nItem \n\nLinqing \nCity  \nLinyi \nCounty \nZouping \nCounty \n\nha = hectare, km = kilometer, m3/day = cubic meter per day, SWM = solid waste management, t/day = ton per day. \nSource: Feasibility study reports by Design Institutes, June 2005. \n\n \n5. \nThe  proposed  SWM  subprojects  will  install  proper  landfill  gas  (LFG)  extraction  and  flare \nand utilization systems. These will reduce emissions of methane, a highly potent GHG contained \nin LFG (approximately 40\u201350%), as well as mitigate environmental and safety hazards to nearby \ncommunities.  LFG  emissions  from  landfills  result  from  the  biological  decomposition  of  organic \nwaste. Gas production typically ramps up, peaking between years 8 and 10 of landfill operation.  \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2003.

Under a conservative scenario of LFG generation and collection and \nutilization,  the  Linqing  SWM  subprojects  have  the  potential  to  reduce  approximately  400,000, \n200,000, and 400,000 tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent (tCO2e) of GHGs, respectively, over the \n10-year  crediting  period. 2 The  potential  value  of  these  ERs  is  estimated  at  $6.5  million\u2013$10 \nmillion.3 Through ADB\u2019s CDM facility, which facilitates the bidding process and allows negotiation \nof  credit  sales  with  multiple  buyers,  (i)  required  preparation  time  could  be  reduced,  (ii)  value  of \ncredits  could  be  maximized,  and  (iii)  direct  transaction  costs  could  be  minimized.4 The  financial \nanalysis  demonstrates  that  the  value  of  these  ERs  will  more  than  offset  the  additional  costs \nassociated  with  developing  the  project  in  accordance  with  CDM  requirements,  including  capital \ncosts for gas collection and flaring/utilization.  \n \n8. \nimportant benefits:  \n(i) \n\nOther  CDM  Benefits.  Application  of  CDM  to  the  SWM  component  will  provide  other \n\nImprove  waste  collection  efficiency.  The  amount  of  LFG  generation  depends heavily \non  disposed  waste  volume  and  its  organic  content.  Efficient  collection  of  organic  waste \nwill contribute to environmental benefits throughout the project areas. Large amounts of \nfood  and  agricultural  waste  that  is  currently  uncollected  and  piled  in  the  fields  or  along \nstreets are often sources of odor, rodents, and water contamination.  \nProperly  seal  the  sides  and  top  of  the  landfill. Rather than escaping randomly, LFG \nwill  be  collected  through  the  intended  chambers  for  the  gas  to  be  utilized,  which  will \nreduce the amount of uncollected LFG causing odor and affecting nearby communities.  \nProperly compact the waste. By preventing air from entering the cells, a higher ratio of \nmethane in LFG to be utilized will be maintained, which will extend the life of the landfills. \nUtilize  LFG  as  an  alternative  source  of  energy  for  heat,  hot  water,  and  electricity. \nThis  will  give  additional  carbon  revenues,  as  SWM  entities  claim  GHG  reductions  from \navoided coal use. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n                                                 \n2   The Kyoto Protocol defines three \u201ccommitments periods\u201d: 2008\u20132012 (first period), 2013\u20132017 (second), 2018\u20132022 \n(third). At this time, the signatories to the protocol have agreed to mandatory reduction commitments only during the \nfirst period.  \n\n3   Using a price of $6.5\u2013$10 per tCO2e. Carbon prices have been rising steadily, and several reports predict prices to \nbe  well  above  $10  per  tCO2e  by  2010.  Since  the  Kyoto  Protocol  came  into  effect  in  February  2005,  the  European \nUnion emission allowance prices range near \u20ac20 per tCO2e. \n\n4   The CDM facility recovers the direct costs incurred once an emission reduction purchase agreement is successfully \n\nnegotiated between a buyer and the project developer. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n31 \n\nThe  estimated  financial  benefits  for  these  SWM  subprojects  are  $3.25  million\u2013$7.50 \n9. \nmillion,  assuming  an  average  price  of  $6.5\u2013$10.0  per  tCO2e  and  500,000\u2013750,000  tCO2e  of \nGHGs  during  the  first  10  years.  To  maximize  the  future  financial  benefits  of  CDM,  sufficient \nbudget  has  been  allocated  to  SWM  subprojects  to  enhance  the  efficiency  of  LFG  collection, \nutilization,  and  destruction.  Upon  further  due  diligence  and  confirmation  of  financial,  technical, \nand institutional feasibilities, ADB\u2019s CDM facility will provide comprehensive support to the Project \nto develop CDM documentation, as well as negotiate with potential buyers of carbon credits. This \nwill  include  (i) supporting  CDM  registration  through  preparation  of  the  project  design  document \nand  new  baseline/monitoring  methodologies  (if necessary), assistance in  obtaining host  country \napproval,  and  facilitation  of  validation  by  a  designated  operational  entity  (DOE);  (ii)  assisting  in \nmarketing  and  negotiating  the  carbon  credits  by  identifying  potential  buyer(s),  and  preparing  a \ndraft  emission  reduction  purchase  agreement  (ERPA)  between  the  project  developer  and \nbuyer(s);  and  (iii)  providing  capacity  building  for  project  staff  (including  conducting  basic  and \nadvanced  training)  of  the  project  developer  and  any  other  stakeholders,  as  required,  during  the \nCDM project development process. \n \nThe CDM facility offers these services on a no-risk,5 conditional cost recovery basis.6 Only \n10. \nif  the  project  is  registered  successfully  with  the  CDM  Environmental  Bureau,  and  a  transaction \nwith buyer(s) is made, the direct costs (with no margin or fees) will be recovered from the project \ndeveloper or the buyer(s). \n \n\n                                                 \n5   No-risk for the project developer. ADB only will recover direct costs if the CDM facility is successful in achieving the \nfollowing:  registering  the  project  with  the  CDM  Environmental  Bureau,  and  negotiating  an  ERPA  on  the  project \ndeveloper\u2019s behalf. \n\n6   Costs would be recovered from the first payments to the project developer under an ERPA. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTable A4.4: External Assistance Funded by Asian

\n1. \nThe physical infrastructure components of the Project consist of (i) municipal wastewater \nmanagement  (MWM)  in  four  subprojects,  (ii)  industrial  wastewater  management  (IWM)  in  two \nsubprojects, and (iii) solid waste management (SWM) in three subprojects. \n  \nA. \n \n2. \nBinzhou  City.  The  service  area  is  the  Binzhou  Economic  Development  Zone  (BEDZ), \nwhich covers 86,000 people. BEDZ does not have a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and \napproximately 24,000 tons/day (t/d) of untreated wastewater is discharged into the Xisha River. \nThis  subproject  consists  of  a  40,000  t/d  secondary  WWTP,  a  30,000  t/d  tertiary  reuse  water \ntreatment plant, 65 kilometers (km) of sewer and 17 km of reuse water piping, and a 30,000 t/d \ncapacity  lift  station.  This  WWTP  is  expected  to  have  sufficient  capacity  beyond  2015. \nApproximately  75%  of  the  secondary  treatment  effluent  will  be  purified  further  for  industrial \nreuse. The remaining 10,000 t/d of secondary treatment effluent will be discharged to the Xisha \nRiver.  Sludge  generated  from  this  WWTP  will  be  dewatered  and  disposed  of  in  a  municipal \nlandfill.  \n \n3. \nGaotang  County. The service area has about 150,000 people. Approximately 100,000 \nt/d of untreated wastewater is discharged into the Majia River, a tributary in the Hai River Basin \n(HRB). This subproject includes (i) a 40,000 t/d secondary WWTP; (ii) a 40,000 t/d tertiary reuse \nwater  treatment  plant;  and  (iii)  23  km  of  sewer,  trunk  sewer,  and  reuse  water  piping.  The \nwastewater  will  undergo  tertiary  treatment  for  industrial  reuse.  The  dewatered  sludge  will  be \nused as fertilizer in Quanlin Paper Mill\u2019s reed (a material for straw pulp) planting field.  \n \n4. \nLinqing  City.  The  existing  30,000  t/d  WWTP  is  sufficient  for  25%  of  the  wastewater \ngenerated in the service area, which has 280,000 people. The untreated and improperly treated \nwastewaters  are  discharged  directly  into  the  Weiyun  and  Xiaoyun  canals.  This  subproject \nincludes (i) a 100,000 t/d secondary WWTP; (ii) a 50,000 t/d tertiary water reuse treatment plant; \nand (iii) 12 km of trunk sewer, reuse water piping, and treatment effluent discharge lines. Half of \nthe effluent will be treated further for industrial reuse. Sludge generated from this WWTP will be \ndisposed of in a new municipal landfill to be built under this Project. This proposed subproject is \nexpected to reduce chemical oxygen demand (COD) loading in the HRB by more than 12,000 \ntons per year. It also plays an important role in the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. \n \n5. \nShanghe  County.  The  service  area  has  53,000  people,  though  the  anticipated  rapid \ngrowth will result in a threefold increase by the design year of 2015. As this area does not have \na WWTP, the wastewater (15,000 t/d) is discharged into the Dehuixin and Shangzhong rivers. \nThis  proposed  subproject  includes  a  40,000  t/d  WWTP,  21  km  of  sewer,  and  two  lift  stations. \nShanghe  County  does  not  have  a  sanitary  landfill.  In  the  short  term,  the  sludge  will  be \ncomposted, and then used as fertilizer in forestry.  \n \n6. \nWith  an  average  COD  removal  rate  of  75%,  the  proposed  MWM  subprojects  are \nexpected to reduce pollutants in the HRB. Water quality in HRB tributaries might not improve in \nthe  short  term.  However,  with  other  HRB  pollution  control measures,  long-term  effects  can  be \nanticipated. This component will improve local residents\u2019 quality of life and eliminate a source of \npollution to the local groundwater.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nIndustrial Wastewater Management  \n\nB. \n \n7. \nDezhou Changyuan Paper Mill. Changyuan Paper Mill produces 65,000 tons per year \nof  straw  pulp.  With  the  mill\u2019s  outdated  ammonia  cooking  method,  the  valuable  cooking \nchemicals  cannot  be  reused.  The  current  treatment  method  for  the  spent  chemicals,  called \nblack liquor, is inefficient and ineffective. The WWTP for the midsection wastewater is unreliable, \nand would not meet the stringent standards after 2007. The black liquor and other wastewater \nthat cannot be treated are stored in a large unlined storage lagoon or discharged without proper \ntreatment. This lagoon is a major source of groundwater contamination. This subproject consists \nof  (i)  a  1,800  cubic  meter  per  day  (m3/day)  black  liquor  recovery  system  with  200  t/d  solid \ncapacity and 43 t/d sodium hydroxide recovery; (ii) a 45,000 m3/day WWTP; and (iii) a 15,000 \nm3/day  process  water  recycling  system.  The  proposed  subproject  is  expected  to  eliminate  a \nsignificant amount of pollutants (approximately 1,550 tons per year of COD) discharged into the \nHRB. Further, more efficient reuse of the black liquor saves energy and valuable materials. The \nwastewater  storage  lagoon  will  be  closed  within  6  months  after  the  start  of  project \nimplementation. Proper closure of the lagoon will be a loan assurance, eliminating this long-term \ngroundwater pollution source. \n \n8. \nGaotang Quanlin Paper Mill. Quanlin Paper Mill employs 11,000 people and produces \n350,000 tons per year of straw pulp. The black liquor generation rate (6,580 t/d) is projected to \ndouble  when  a  new  300,000  ton-per-year  wood  pulp  production  line  is  added  in  2007.  The \ncurrent  black  liquor  pretreatment  involves  an  outdated  technology,  which  adds  sulfuric  acid  to \nextract  lignin  to  use  as  pellet  fertilizer.  This  process  destroys  alkali  that  otherwise  could  be \nrecovered,  and  consumes  large  quantities  of  sulfuric  acid.  The  resulting  wastewater  contains \nextremely  high  concentrations  of  salts,  which  typical  wastewater  treatment  processes  cannot \nremove. Discharge of this treatment effluent into rivers would increase the salt contents in the \nreceiving water bodies greatly, gradually rendering the river water unuseable for irrigation. The \nblack liquor pretreatment (i.e., acidic lignin extraction) process requires high maintenance, and \nthe  extracted  lignin  cannot  be  reused  readily.  As  such,  Quanlin  Paper  Mill  also  has  a  large \nunlined  storage  lagoon  to  hold  the  unused  lignin  slurry.  This  lagoon  is  a  major  continuous \nsource  of  groundwater  contamination.  This  subproject  consists  of  (i)  an  11,470  m3/day  black \nliquor recovery system with 2,440 t/d of solid capacity, (ii) a 536 t/d sodium hydroxide recovery, \nand  (iii)  a  485  t/d  lime  recovery  system  and  accessories.  This  subproject  is  expected  to \neliminated  a  significant  amount  of  regulated  pollutants  (292,200  tons  per  year  of  COD)  and \n200,000  tons  per  year  of  unregulated  inorganic  salts.  Recovery  of  alkali  will  save  valuable \nresources,  while  greatly  reducing  the  quantity  of  wastewater.  Reducing  the  unregulated  salts \ninvaluable  environmental  benefits.  The \nfrom \nImplementing Agency (IA) has developed a plan to close the lignin storage lagoon properly by \nJune 2006.  \n \nC. \n \n9. \nLinqing City. The existing solid waste landfill is an unlined open dump off a main road. \nIndustrial and municipal wastes are dumped without control or daily cover. Leachate, as well as \nodors  and  pests  generated  from  this  dumpsite,  present  significant  threats  to  the  local \ngroundwater,  nearby  residents,  and  the  environment.  The  contamination  of  groundwater,  a \nmajor  drinking  water  source,  has  negative  impacts  on  many  more  residents  in  the  area.  This \nsubproject includes (i) a new lined landfill, (ii) leachate collection and treatment systems, and (iii) \nassociated  machinery  and  equipment.  Design  life  of  the  landfill  is  15  years  with  a  400  t/d \ncapacity. A low-cost early leak detection system will be considered in the design. If necessary\u2014 \n\nSolid Waste Management \n\ntreatment  effluent  has \n\nthe  wastewater \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n35 \n\nif liner failure occurs, for example\u2014this system can be converted into a leachate extraction and \ngroundwater remediation system. The old landfill will be closed by the end of 2007.  \n \n10. \nLinyi  County.    Linyi  County  is  using  a  temporary  unlined  open  dump  to  dispose of  its \nsolid waste. This open dump, which has been in use for approximately 2 years, is reaching its \ncapacity. Wastes are dumped without control or daily cover. This subproject includes (i) a new \nlined landfill, (ii) leachate collection and treatment systems, and (iii) associated machinery and \nequipment.  Design  life  of  the  landfill  is  20  years  with  a  200  t/d  capacity.  The  proposed  flood \nprotection measure will satisfy the 50-year frequency flood requirements, and will include a low-\ncost  early  leak  detection  system  in  the  design.  Groundwater  elevations  are  relatively  high, \napproximately 3 meters below ground surface. The old landfill will be closed within 1 year from \nthe date the proposed landfill begins operation.  \n \n11. \nZouping  County.  Zouping\u2019s  solid  waste  landfill  is  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the \nselected new site. It is a single-lined, simplified sanitary landfill with a leachate collection system. \nHowever, it does not have leachate treatment system. This subproject includes (i) a new 400 t/d \ncapacity  lined  landfill,  (ii)  a  100  t/d  transfer  station,  (iii)  leachate  collection  and  treatment \nsystems,  and  (iv)  associated  machinery  and  equipment.  Design  life  of  the  landfill  is  15  years. \nThe  average  elevation  of  the  selected  site  is  slightly  lower  than  the  100-year  flood  warning \nelevation. With the proposed protective dikes outside the landfill perimeter, however, the flood \ncontrol requirement will be satisfied. As in the other two SWM subprojects, a low-cost early leak \ndetection  system  will  be  included  in  the  design.  Proper  closure  of  the  old  landfill  has  been \nincluded in this Project. Because of the proximity of the new and the existing landfills, they can \nshare a leachate treatment system. \n \n12. \nmechanism and greenhouse gas initiatives will be pilot-tested in the three SWM subprojects. \n \nInvestments  have  been  determined  based  on  feasibility  studies  for  each  subproject, \n13. \nprepared  by  high-quality  domestic  design  institutes,  after  analysis  of  technical  options  for \ntechnology,  capacity,  location,  etc.,  to  determine  least-cost  solutions.  International  consultants \nalso reviewed and analyzed the feasibility studies. The project design is technically sound and \ndraws on best sanitary engineering practice.  \n \n \n\nPollution reduction to HRB will be indirect, but with long-term effects.

This, in turn, will reduce surface and groundwater pollution and improve \nthe urban environment and public health, and increase the quality of life of project beneficiaries. In addition, the Project \nwill (i) increase employment and income-generating opportunities, (ii) increase the yield and value of irrigated crops, and \n(iii) reduce risks of paper mills closure. The Project will benefit more than 3.9 million people in the project area, including \n2.2 million in the direct project area and 1.7 million in the indirect project area. Of the beneficiary population, 6.5% live \nbelow the local poverty  line. The poverty and social analysis shows that the Project  will help to (i) improve  wastewater \nand solid waste facilities and services; (ii) reduce air, surface, and groundwater pollution; (iii) reduce risks of exposure to \ndisease  vectors;  (iv)  increase  employment  opportunities  and  income-generating  activities;  (v)  reduce  risks  of  people \nfalling into poverty due to closure of paper mills; and (vi) improve urban living environment and increase quality of life. \n \nThe effluent reuse of the treated  wastewater is expected to provide  water for irrigation and industrial use in the project \nareas. As a result, environmental and socioeconomic benefits will be generated for the local population. The poor, due to \ntheir higher vulnerability to environmental conditions and lack of financial resources, will benefit disproportionately from \nimproved environmental quality and health benefits. A health impact analysis was conducted to determine an indicative \nestimate  of  the  health  benefits  associated  with  the  Project.  Available  information  on  the  health  status  of  the  project \npopulation  was  derived  from  the  socioeconomic  survey  conducted  by  Shandong  Provincial  Statistical  Bureau  in  March \n2005, as well as the latest secondary information from provincial and city/county health bureaus. The analysis shows that \nthe population exposed to waterborne-related disease and medical costs will be reduced, and the number of school days \nand  workdays  lost  due  to  sickness  will  also  be  reduced.  (A  detailed  health  impact  assessment  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  J.)    However,  for  the  full  benefit  to  be  realized,  other  improvements  will  be  required,  including  (i)  parallel \nimprovements  in  public  health  education;  (ii)  higher  standard  of  personal  hygiene;  and  (iii)  disease  prevention  control, \nparticularly for the poor who are likely to suffer from the incidence of pollution-related diseases. \n \nA survey of towns (1,200 respondents) was undertaken to assess the demand for improved wastewater and solid waste \nmanagement  services.  The  overwhelming  majority  of  cities/counties  strongly  supported  the  Project.  The  Project  will \ncreate  a  number  of  employment  opportunities  for  the  local  community  for  construction,  particularly  for  the  poor.  The \nProject  will  require  an  estimated  13,940  person-months  of  employment,  including  5,360  person-months  of  direct \nemployment and 8,577 person-months of indirect and induced employment opportunities for local people. About 40% of \nthe  unskilled  jobs  will  be  provided  to  the  poor  and  women.  The  type  of  jobs  for  unskilled  labor  include  leveling  land, \nexcavation for foundation, soil and earth transportation, construction, etc. The operation of the Project will create 2,360 \nfull-time jobs, including 910 direct jobs and 1,450 indirect and induced jobs. Most of the unskilled jobs will go to the poor \nand women, such as drivers, garbage collectors, sweepers, etc.   \n \nThe reduced risks of Changyuan and Quanlin paper mills closure due to failure to meet wastewater discharge standards \nstipulated by the State Environmental Protection Agency after 1997 will benefit 12,320 employees of both companies and \naround  1.3  million  farmers  of  raw  materials.  This,  in  turn,  will  prevent  the  income  loss  of  CNY143  million  of  the  paper \nmill\u2019s employees and CNY1, 242 million for the raw material suppliers. In addition, the industrial wastewater treatment of \npaper mill also will reduce the associated risk of business closures in the surrounding areas of the paper mills as a result \nof the paper mills shutting down. As a result, the Project will prevent the possibility of mill workers, raw material suppliers, \nand associated business employees falling into poverty. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  does  not  have  an  official  urban  poverty  line.  The  National  Bureau  of  Statistics  \ndiagnostic  urban  poverty  line  was  CNY1,875  income  per  capita  in  2000.  In  2002,  the  urban  poverty  rate  in  the  PRC \nreached 4.1% or 19.6 million, excluding the poor floating population of 40 million. The PRC also has other urban poverty \nlines  set as benchmarks,  below which a person is entitled to  poverty relief  benefits under  the minimum living standard  \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n45 \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nscheme  (MLSS). The city government has primary responsibility for financial assistance to the urban poor under MLSS. \nEach city sets its own poverty or benefit line, which is adjusted periodically.  \n \nIn 2003, Shandong Province\u2019s population was 91.25 million, which included 1.12 million (or 1.2% of the population) living \nbelow  the  MLSS.  The  poverty  ratio  in  the  eight  project  areas  (Binzhou,  Changyuan,  Gaotang,  Linqing  city,  Linyi  city, \nQuanlin, Shanghe, and Zouping) ranges from 2.9% in Changyuan and to 14.4% in Shanghe. The average poverty ratio is \n6.5%.  Shandong  Province  has  10  national  poverty  counties  and  20  provincial  poverty  counties,  and  Shanghe  is  a \ndesignated  county.  All  the  project  counties  have  higher  poverty  ratios  than  the  provincial  poverty  ratio  (6.5%  versus \n1.2%). The  MLSS  ranges  from  CNY1,440  per  capita  per  year  in  Shanghe  to  CNY2,040  per  capita  per  year  in  Quanlin \nand Gaotang. Since city government sets its own poverty or benefit line, poorer cities tend to use a severe definition of \npoverty and richer cities a more lenient definition.   \n \nThe  socioeconomic  survey  showed  that  most  of  the  urban  poor  are  unemployed  workers,  part-time  workers,  disabled \npeople,  and  old  and  retirees  without  any  family  members.  The  primary  cause  of  urban  poverty  has  been  the  loss  of \nemployment  due  to  downsizing  of  state-owned  enterprises  and  limited  opportunities  for  alternative  income-earning \nactivities. Urban poverty is often reinforced by environmental pollution at the household level. The poor could not afford \nthe service of basic infrastructure and facilities, such as clean water, wastewater, and solid waste services, and had less \nability to cope with pollution and a degraded environment. They often suffer from serious water supply shortages, poor \nwater quality, wastewater pollution, and poor urban environmental sanitation, which increase their exposure to water and \nair pollution. This puts them at high risk for diseases related to water and air pollution, such as diarrhea, hepatitis, and \nrespiratory diseases. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nStakeholder  analysis  was  conducted  during  the  poverty  and  social  analysis  (PSA).  Various  methods  and  approaches \nhave  been  employed,  including  PSA,  random  sampling  socioeconomic  survey  (1,200  respondents),  stakeholder \nconsultation  meetings  and  workshops,  focus  group  discussions,  and  key  informant  interviews.  The  main  stakeholder \ngroups  are  (i)  urban  and  rural  residents;  (ii)  beneficiary  communities;  (iii)  industrial/commercial  users;  (iv)  business \nconsumers;  (v)  downstream  irrigation  farmers;  (vi)  paper  mill  employees  and  management;  (vii)  local  decision  makers, \nincluding  relevant  government  agencies  at  provincial  city/county  levels;  (viii)  project  management  office;  (ix)  project \nimplementation agencies; and (x) private sector. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nA public education and awareness program (PEAP) will be conducted to promote hygiene education, recycling program, \nand  social  acceptance  of  tariff  increases.a    The  following  results  are  expected  through  the  PEAP:  (i)  increased \nparticipation of the local population in project implementation and monitoring, (ii) increased awareness of project benefits \nand  acceptance  of  the  Project,  (iii)  increased  hygiene  knowledge  and  reduced  incidence  of  water-  and  vector-borne \ndiseases,  and  (iv)  increased  participation  of  beneficiaries  in  the  garbage  recycling  programs  as  part  of  solid  waste \nmanagement program. Furthermore, stakeholder consultation and disclosure of information on the implementation of the \nresettlement plan (RP) and environmental management plan will be conducted during project implementation.   \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe  health  benefits  would  be  greater  for  women,  elderly,  children,  and  the  poor,  as  they  are  most  vulnerable  to  such \ndiseases. With more chances of contact with water from domestic chores, women will benefit disproportionately from the \nimprovement in water quality and urban environment. Women also will benefit from the Project due to the employment \nopportunities  during  construction  and  operations.  Furthermore,  15%  of  women  employees  in  the  two  industrial  paper \nmills  and  20%  of  women  raw  material  suppliers  could  maintain  their  employment  opportunities,  thus  not  fallling  into \npoverty level due to paper mill closures. \n \nWomen in the community will be engaged actively for the PEAP to promote (i) hygiene education, (ii) garbage recycling, \nand (iii) social acceptance of tariff increases. For the PEAP, the Project will work closely with local women\u2019s \norganizations, such as All Chinese Women Association and women\u2019s street committee. The project performance \nmanagement system, RP, and environmental management plan will include gender disaggregated data, where relevant. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n   Yes               \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n   No \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\n   Appendix 11 \n\n \nE.

The proposed tariff \nincreased  is  affordable  for  both  groups,  with  the \nwater/wastewater  bills  accounting  for  0.5%  of  the \nincome of for average-income households and 0.9% \nof  the  low-income  households.  Solid  waste  disposal \nbills  account  for  less  than  1%  for  both  groups.  For \nthe  city/county \nthe  very  poorest  household, \ngovernments  provide  MLSS,  which \nincludes  a \nprovision  for  lifeline  utility  services.  The  county  and \ncity  governments  also  provide \nrebates  on \nwater/wastewater  to  all  households  qualifying  for \nsocial  assistance  with  the  recent  increase  in  water \nand wastewater tariffs. In Gaotang and Shanghe, the \nlocal governments waive the first 5\u201310 cubic meters \nof water consumed by qualifying MLSS households. \n \nThe  Project  will  create  jobs  during  construction.  No \nlabor retrenchment is anticipated.  \n \n\n \nLess  than  1%  of  the  population  in  the  project  areas \nare  ethnic  minorities,  i.e.,  Hui  and  Manchurian.  The \nsociocultural  ethnic  minorities  have  been  integrated \ninto  the  majority  Han  ethnic  group.  The  ethnic \nminorities do not share distinctive customs economic \nactivities.  The  detailed  socioeconomic  survey \nindicates  the  Project  will  not  affect  any  ethnic \nminority  groups.  Therefore,  based  on  ADB\u2019s \nIndigenous People Policy (OM F3/BP), the Project is \nclassified  as  category  C.  An  indigenous  people \ndevelopment plan or specific action is not required. \n \n \nHealth  and  safety  training  will  be  provided  to  the \nconstruction  workers.

The others, which involve \nimproved  waste  management  for  two  paper  mills,  have  sufficient  land  for  construction.  The \nresettlement  planning,  and  implementation  is  designed  to  ensure  that  the  affected  persons  will  be \nbetter off, or at least not worse off, as a result of the Project.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe impacts of the Project are summarized in Table A12. Land acquisition and resettlement \nwill affect seven villages. The Project will acquire about 101.5 hectares (ha) of land, 37% of which is \nclassified as cultivated farmland. Permanent land acquisition will affect approximately 610 people in \n123 households and three enterprises. The Project will require the temporary acquisition of 39 ha of \nland. No households will need to be relocated. About 30,450 square meters (m2) of structures will be \ndemolished, most of which are old abandoned buildings belonging to the Yinhe Paper Mill in Linqing \nCity.  Two  brick  kilns  will  be  closed  due  to  environmental  regulations  effective  2004.  The  Zouping \nsolid waste management (SWM) component will affect a state-owned farm, and the 27 workers have \nbeen  transferred  to  the  SWM  plant.  Most  of  the  affected  people  are  rural,  though  many  have \ndiversified  income  sources.  Thus,  the  loss  of  land  is  not  considered  serious.  Although  temporary \nland occupation due to sewer pipeline construction will affect about 1,441 persons, compensation is \nnot needed because the disturbances will be short and contractors will restore conditions quickly. \n \n3. \ncommittees were consulted. \n  \n\nTo  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  local  officials  and  village  street \n\nTable A12: Summary of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n\nProject \nComponent \n\nPermanent Land \nAcquisition \n\nTemporary \nOccupation of \nState-Owned \nLand \n\nBuilding \nDemolition \n\nDirectly \nAffected \nHouse- \nholds \n\nDirectly \nAffected \nPersons \n\nPersons \nIndirectly \nAffected by \nTemporary Land \nAcquisition \n(AP) \n\nTotal \n\n (ha) \n\nCultivated \nLand \n(ha) \n\nSubtotal MWM \n\n20.63 \n\n11.13 \n\nShanghe MWM \n\n4.66 \n\nBinzhou MWM \n\nGaotang MWM \n\nLinqing MWM \n\nLinqing SWM \n\nLinyi SWM \n\n4.53 \n\n6.17 \n\n5.27 \n\n18.67 \n\n20.40 \n\nZouping SWM \n\n41.80 \n\nSubtotal SWM \n\n80.87 \n\nTotal  101.50 \n\n4.33 \n\n3.84 \n\n2.96 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n26.67 \n\n26.67 \n\n37.80 \n\n (ha) \n\n6.87 \n\n20.63 \n\n5.48 \n\n6.00 \n\n38.98 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n38.98 \n\n(m2) \n\n(HH) \n\n(AP) \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n28,000 \n\n28,000 \n\n450 \n\n2,000 \n\n0 \n\n2,450 \n\n30,450 \n\n52 \n\n47 \n\n19 \n\n0 \n\n118 \n\n1 brickfield\n\n1 brickfield\n1 farm and \n5 HH \n\n5 \n\n123 \n\n245 \n\n185 \n\n76 \n\n0 \n\n506 \n\n26 \n\n46 \n\n32 \n\n104 \n\n610 \n\n69 \n\n184 \n\n471 \n\n717 \n\n1,441 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n1,441 \n\nAP  =  affected  person,  ha  =  hectare,  HH  =  household,  m2 =  square  meter,  MWM  =  municipal  wastewater  management, \nSWM = solid waste management. \nSource: Resettlement plans, by county government implementing agencies.

House demolition is based on \nthe  Provincial  and  Municipal  Urban  Housing  Demolition  Administration  Regulations.  Seven \nresettlement plans (RP) were prepared to comply with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Policy \non Involuntary Resettlement. Based on consultations with local governments and those affected, the \nrespective implementing agencies (IA) adopted compensation standards based on the replacement \ncost. The resettlement principles established for the Project are (i) land acquisition and involuntary \nresettlement should be avoided, where feasible,  by developing and comparing design alternatives; \n(ii) compensation  and  entitlements  provided  are  based  on  market/replacement  value  and  must  be \nadequate  to  allow  those  affected  to  at  least  maintain  their  pre-project  standard  of  living,  with \nimprovement; (iii) land temporarily occupied and the period for disruption are to be minimized; (iv) all \naffected  people,  legal  and  illegal,  are  to  be  accounted  for;  (v)  per  capita  landholding  after  land \nacquisition  will  be  sufficient  to  maintain  the  previous  livelihood  standard;  (vi) other  income-\ngenerating activities will be provided where land allocation per capita is not sufficient to maintain the \nprevious  livelihood  standards;  (vii)  a  preferential  policy  will  be  provided  to  vulnerable  groups  in \ncompensation,  housing,  transfer,  and  employment;  (viii)  all  those  affected  will  be  adequately \ninformed  about  eligibility,  compensation  rates  and  standards,  livelihood  and  income-restoration \nplans, and project timing; and (ix) close monitoring and timely actions will be carried out to resolve \nany problems.  \n \n5. \nFor  land  acquisition,  part  of  the  compensation  will  be  paid  to  the  affected  village  and  the \nresettlement subsidy will be paid to the affected households. For enterprises, compensation will be \npaid to owners. The payment will be made in cash, according to the appraised value of the property. \nCompensation for standing crops, auxiliaries, and other assets also will be paid directly to affected \nfarmers.  Income  losses  resulting  from  reduced  production/sales  and  wages  caused  by  the  Project \nwill be compensated in cash. \n \nD. \n \n6. \nThe  resettlement  strategy  encompasses  the  restoration  of  livelihood  and  income.  The \nrespective project implementation units, IAs, and local government will assistance with the relocation \nof two brick kilns. No individual residential building will be demolished. \n \n7. \nThe  economic  rehabilitation  measures  include  (i)  providing  jobs  during  the  project \nconstruction  and  operational  phases;  (ii)  arranging  for  those  affected  to  be  employed  in  local \nenterprises and businesses; (iii) redistributing land, where possible; (iv) intensifying and diversifying \nfarm operations to raise the value of production and income per unit of land; (v) supporting animal \nbreeding  income-generating  activities;  (vi)  promoting  and  developing  new  enterprises  and  self-\nemployed  tertiary  businesses  (i.e.,  transportation,  entertainment,  and  catering  services);  and  (vii) \ntraining  in  scientific  and  diversified  agricultural  business,  technology  on  animal  husbandry  and \neconomic  crops  planting,  and  technology  on  planting  vegetables  in  greenhouses  to  help  affected \npeople increase their incomes. The compensation paid to village committees will be used to improve \nvillage  production  and  infrastructure.  For  affected  small-scale  enterprises,  the  IA  will  reemploy \naffected employees, or they will be provided assistance to secure other jobs. \n \n8. \nThe survey identified two vulnerable households (three persons) for the Shanghe municipal \nwastewater management (MWM) project. For the vulnerable people, the project management office \n(PMO)  will  establish  a  special  CNY50,000  fund  for  them  to  improve  their  living  standards.  The \ncounty  civil  affairs  bureau  will  manage  the  fund.  The  IA  will  supervise  implementation  to  ensure \n\nResettlement and Rehabilitation  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n49 \n\nInstitutional Responsibilities  \n\nResettlement Cost and Fund Management  \n\nInformation Disclosure, Participation, and Grievance \n\nthese  vulnerable  persons  receive  adequate  compensation,  special  fund,  and  assistance  to  restore \ntheir living conditions and incomes. \n \nE. \n \nThe cost estimate for land acquisition and resettlement is $8.75 million, equivalent to CNY71 \n9. \nmillion  in  2005  prices,  including  contingencies,  taxes,  and  duties.  The  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  cost  is  included  as  part  of  project  cost.  According  to  the  compensation  policies  and \nstandards defined in the RP, the internal monitoring agencies will supervise the payment and usage \nof compensation funds, while the external monitoring agency will conduct regular reviews. Detailed \nmeasurement  surveys  will  be  conducted  in  each  village  and  enterprise,  and  the  compensation \ncontracts will be negotiated and signed with village committees, households, and enterprises. \n \nF. \n \n10. \nThe  people  affected  have  been  notified  about  the  key  elements  of  the  RP,  and  results  of \ncommunity  consultations  have  been  integrated  into  the  RPs.  The  draft  RPs,  or  Resettlement \nInformation  Booklets  (RIB),  were  disseminated  to  affected  households  and  village  offices  in  April \n2005. The revised RIBs were disclosed to affected households on 15 August 2005. The RPs were \nposted in village offices and resident committees on 15 August 2005, and on the ADB Web site on 8 \nDecember 2005.  The IAs will establish project resettlement units for (i) supervising implementation, \n(ii)  continuing  public  consultation,  (iii)  monitoring  progress,  and  (iv) responding  to  grievances.  The \ngrievance address procedures are well established and included in the RPs. \n   \nG. \n \n11. \nThe provincial PMO will be responsible for overseeing project implementation. Each project \nimplementation unit and IA will have at least two full-time staff responsible for land acquisition and \nresettlement,  respectively.  The  staff  from  each  component  resettlement  unit  will  have  primary \nresponsibility  for  coordinating  the  planning,  implementation,  financing,  and  monitoring  of  land \nacquisition and resettlement. They will work closely with relevant village officials, land administration \nbureaus,  and  house  demolishment  offices.  Further,  they  will  be  responsible  for  supervising  and \nmonitoring  resettlement  (e.g.,  delivery  of  entitlements,  restoration  of  incomes,  provision  of \nreplacement  land,  and  other  economic  measures).  A  resettlement  training  workshop  for  local \ngovernment officials, local land departments, and IAs was conducted in Jinan on 28 July 2005. \n \nH. \n \nRP implementation will be monitored internally and externally. Monitoring methodologies are \n12. \nspecified in the RPs. Each IA will conduct internal supervision and monitoring to ensure compliance \nwith the provisions of the RP. The PMO and IAs have agreed to a set of supervision milestones with \nADB  to  ensure  timely  implementation  of  resettlement  activities.  The  provincial  PMO  and  IAs  will \nengage an independent agency for semiannual monitoring in the first year, and annual evaluation of \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  until  2  years  after  the  completion  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement. External monitoring reports will be forwarded directly to the PMO and ADB. \n \nI. \n \n13. \nResettlement  implementation  will  be  scheduled  to  precede  the  subproject  construction \nschedules.  Most  resettlement  activities  will  begin  in  April  2006.  Resettlement  will  be  completed \nbefore component construction.  \n \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nResettlement Milestones  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\n    Appendix 13 \n\nSUMMARY FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nIntroduction \n\nFinancial Analysis Methodology \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  financial  analyses  of  municipal  wastewater  management  (MWM),  solid  waste \n1. \nmanagement  (SWM),  and \nindustrial  wastewater  management  (IWM)  subprojects  were \nundertaken in accordance with the Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of \nInvestment  Projects  Financed  by  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  Framework  for  the \nEconomic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects of ADB.1 The financial \nanalysis of the Project was undertaken in conjunction with the institutional analysis (Appendix 2). \n \nB. \n \nThe  financial  analysis  established  the  requirements  for  financial  sustainability.  It \n2. \nmeasured the ability of each subproject to generate sufficient revenues from operations to meet \nall  company  costs,  including  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  debt  servicing  (ADB  loan), \ndepreciation,  and  a  reasonable  rate  of  return  on  investment.  The  analysis  incorporated  the \nrequired  tariff  increases  into  the  financial  model,  and  compared  these  with  affordability  of \nhouseholds,  in  line  with  the  Government  policy  of  full  cost  recovery  for  the  MWM  and  SWM \nsectors. The base case model compared each subproject financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \nwith the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess \nthe impact of changes in O&M costs and revenues. \n \n3. \nFinancial projections (balance sheet, and income and cash flow statements) have been \ndeveloped  for  each  of  the  MWM  and  SWM  companies  based  on  projected  operational \nperformance of the subprojects and the impact of any existing assets. The financial analysis is \nbased on incremental cash flow effects from the Project (Supplementary Appendix L). For IWM \nsubprojects,  financial  projections  have  taken  into  account  the  existing  operations,  project \nfacilities\u2019 operations, and planned future investments.2 \n \nC.  Definitions and Assumptions \n \n4. \nAll analysis was conducted in real terms at 2005 prices. The FIRR was calculated for the \nMWM  and  SWM  subprojects3 using  incremental  annual  cash  flows  over  25  years  (in  line  with \ndebt repayment). Project assets were assumed to be fully depreciated at the end of the 25-year \nperiod,  leaving  zero  residual  value.  The  new  SWM  companies  are  assumed  to  integrate  all \nSWM  operations\u2014 \ntreatment\u2014upon  project \ncompletion.4 \n \n5. \nProject  capital  expenditures  are  estimated  based  on  the  proposed  implementation \nschedule,  and  include physical  contingencies  of  8%  for  civil  works  and  5%  for  equipment  and \n                                                 \n1 ADB  2002.  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB. \n\ntransport,  disposal,  and \n\nfrom  collection, \n\nManila. \n\n2 The  IWM  subproject  is  non-revenue  generating.  However,  because  it  will  result  in  financial  cost  savings  to  the \n\ncompanies, \u201cpseudo-FIRR\u201d was estimated to determine the impact of these savings on the Project. \n\n3   All  companies  are  assumed  to  be  fully  operational  upon  project  completion  and  commissioning.  The  Gaotang \nMWM component will be under the existing Gaotang WWTP company, while new companies have been formed for \nBinzhou MWM, Shanghe MWM, Linqing MWM, Linyi SWM, Linqing SWM, and Zouping SWM.  \n\n4  This was confirmed with the IAs based on the need to integrate the collection, transport, disposal, and treatment for \nmore  cost-efficient  operations.  Currently,  the  Environmental  Sanitation  Department  (ESD)  in  Linqing  county  is  in \ncharge  of  SWM  operations,  but  needs  to  integrate  with  village  communities  to  ensure  efficient  collection.  In \nZouping, the ESD is in charge of landfill operations and the City Administration Bureau is in charge of secondary \ncollection  and  transport  to  landfill,  with  village  communities  being  in  charge  of  primary  collection.  In  Linyi  county, \nESD does all SWM collection. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n51 \n\nmaterial.  O&M  costs  include  only  incremental  costs  incurred  under  the  Project.  Revenues  for \nthe MWM and SWM subprojects are calculated as a function of MWM/SWM generated volumes, \ntariff  rates,  and  tariff  collection  efficiencies.  Tariffs  have  been  calculated  to  cover  all  costs  as \nwell as provide a reasonable rate of return (1\u20133%). The base case assumes an improvement in \ntariff collection rates from 75% in 2006 to 95% in 2011. This is reasonable since the Project will \nhelp  improve  (i)  service  delivery,  (ii)  efficiency  gains,  (iii)  tariff  structuring,  (iv)  billing \ntransparency, (v) consumer participation, and (vi) education and awareness of tariff increases. \n \nDuring  construction,  wastewater  and  solid  waste  tariffs  will  cover  all  O&M  and \n6. \ndepreciation.5   By  2010,  when  loan  repayment  begins,  tariffs  need  to  cover  debt  service,  and \nlocal governments will need adequate tariff increases or subsidies to sustain the service levels.  \n \nThe WACC varies based on the ADB loan and local government equity contributions for \n7. \neach subproject. With an overall ADB project loan share of 49.9% and IAs share of 50.1%, the \noverall project WACC is 3.4%. The cost of ADB funds is calculated at 4.66% London interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)  plus  60  basis  points  spread,  except  for  the  first  year,  where  a  20  basis \npoints discount is applied). Additionally, 0.2% (for the MWM and  SWM subprojects) and 0.5% \n(IWM subprojects) have been added to the ADB cost of funds to account for the service fee that \nShandong  Provincial  Finance  Bureau  (SPFB)  will  charge  to  the  subproject  IAs.6 The  cost  of \nlocal government funds is assumed to be 6.03%.7  \n \n8. \nInternational inflation is estimated at 1.9%, while domestic inflation is estimated at 2.5% \nin 2005, 2.6% in 2006, 2.8% in 2007, and 3% thereafter. Depreciation is assumed at 2.5% for \ncivil  works and  5%  for equipment.  The  ADB  loan  repayment  period  is 25  years  (with  a  5-year \ngrace  period)  for  MWM  and  SWM  subprojects,  and  12  years  (with  a  4-year  grace  period)  for \nIWM subprojects. \n  \nD. \n\nResults \u2013 MWM Subprojects \n\n9. \nFIRRs  exceed  the  WACC,  indicating  financial  viability  of  MWM  subprojects  (Table \nA13.1). Sensitivity tests show that the Shanghe subproject is most vulnerable to a decrease in \nrevenues. A combined 10% revenue decrease and 10% cost increase, or a revenue decrease \nby  20%  alone,  has  an  adverse  affect  on  all  the  subprojects  and  would  require  further  tariff \nincreases or short-term subsidies from the local governments.  \n \n10. \nThe  MWM  subprojects  are  sustainable,  and  key  ratios  for  2010  (Table  A13.2)  are \nconsidered adequate. With tariff collection rates rising to 80% after project completion, focus on \nservice delivery is considered critical to financial sustainability of the MWM companies.  \n \nE. \n\nResults \u2013 SWM Subprojects \n\nThe  Linyi,  Linqing,  and  Zouping  SWM  subprojects  have  indicated  their  willingness  to \n11. \nincorporate the clean development mechanism (CDM). The model incorporates CDM equipment \ncost revenues received from the sale of carbon credits, as well as the O&M costs in running the \nCDM facility, allowing more tariff flexibility in SWM subprojects. The inclusion of CDM enhanced \nthe financial viability of SWM subprojects. With FIRRs exceeding the WACC, SWM subprojects \nare considered financially viable.

Financial  soundness  was  measured  in  terms  of  the  minimum \nthresholds for debt service coverage, and current and quick ratio of its operations. Though the \nIWM subproject is non-revenue generating, it provides cost savings to the company. As such, a \n\u201cpseudo-FIRR\u201d  was  calculated  to  determine  the  financial  viability  of  the  investment.

During this period, \na gradual shift to integrated collection, transport, disposal, and treatment will be developed, and \nsynchronized with transparent SWM fee collection schemes in the service areas. Costs will be \ncompared  with  SWM  revenues  received  by  the  Finance  Bureau  to  determine  the  appropriate \nlevels of subsidy required for SWM, if collected user fees are inadequate. Tariff reforms will be \nundertaken in conjunction with corporatization11 to ensure the synergy of managerial autonomy, \nsector reengineering, and integration of SWM functions.  \n \n16. \nThe  calculated  wastewater  full  cost  recovery  tariffs  (starting  from  2010)  were  tested \nagainst the affordability of low-income and average-income households.12 The proposed tariff is \naffordable for both groups, with the combined monthly water and wastewater bill accounting for \n2.5%  of  the  income  of  average-income  household  and  4.0%  of  that  of  the  low-income \nhouseholds.  For  the  poorest  households,  the  city/county  governments  provide  minimum  living \nstandard schemes, which include a provision for lifeline utility services. The counties and cities \nalso provide rebates on water/wastewater bills to all households qualifying for social assistance \nwith the recent increase in water and wastewater tariffs. \n \nThe  current  SWM  fees  of  CNY3\u20135  per  household  per  month  do  not  cover  all  costs  of \n17. \nSWM  operations  due  to  inefficiencies  (multi-agency  service  provision/tariff  collection)  and  lack \nof full cost accounting. Socioeconomic survey results show higher willingness to pay as long as \nservices  are  improved.  Lower-income  groups  have  an  average  willingness  to  pay  (WTP)  of \nCNY8  per  household.  The  average  WTP  per  household  per  month  is  CNY8.0  in  Linqing, \nCNY7.5 in Linyi, and CNY7.5 in Zouping.  \n \n18. \nTherefore,  the  analysis  requires  that  SWM  fees  be  gradually  increased  before  project \ncommissioning  to  CNY8  per  household  per  month  by  2008,  and  a  full  cost  recovery  level  of \nCNY10  per  household  per  month  in  2010,  when  project  facilities  are  operational  and  debt \nrepayments  begin.  This  is  still  within  the  affordability  limits  of  CNY11  for  the  lowest-income \ngroup  and  average  CNY16  for  average-income  groups.  The  proposed  SWM  fees  account  for \naround 0.5\u20130.7% of the income of an average-income family and around 1% of the low-income \nfamily  (Table  A13.5).  As  envisaged,  rising  income  levels  will  benefit  the  affordability  of  the \nlower-  and  middle-income  groups,  impacting  their  willingness  to  pay  and  allowing  for  tariff \nincreases. Concurrently, SWM companies need to bring in efficiencies in fee collections, service \nstandards, and effective tariff mechanisms. \n\n                                                 \n11  Refer to footnote 14 in the maintext. \n12  Defined as the households earning for the average of the lowest 10th percentile of income distribution. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14  \n\n55 \n\nSUMMARY ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\n2. \n\nIntroduction \n\nAnalysis of the Overall Project \n\n \nA. \n \ne  economic  analysis  covers  the  Shandong  Hai  River  Basin  (HRB)  Pollution  Control \n1. \nProject  (the  Project)  and  its  subprojects.  For  the  overall  Project,  the  analysis  covers  (i)  the \neconomic  rationale  for  public  intervention,  (ii)  the  goals  of  the  investment  plan,  and  (iii)  the \ndesign of the plan. The economic analysis also evaluates the subprojects relative to least-cost \nanalysis criteria and standard benefit-cost analysis. The technical description of the Project, with \nits outputs and impacts, are in Appendix 5. The detailed economic analysis is in Supplementary \nAppendix M. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nRationale  for  Public  Intervention.  The  Project  is  the  fourth  in  a  series  of \nenvironmental pollution improvements financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) to manage water quality in the HRB. The HRB is considered \none of the PRC\u2019s most polluted basins, with more than 80% of river bodies failing to meet their \ntargeted  water  quality.  ADB-funded  projects  have  (i)  helped  develop  and  refine  the  national \nHRB  Pollution  Prevention  and  Control  Plan  (HRB  Plan),  (ii)  financed  activities  in  Tianjin \nmunicipality  and  Hebei  Province  (ongoing),  and  (iii)  assisted  with  the  preparation  of  a  sector \nproject in Henan Province.1  \n \n3. \nThe HRB is one of three river basins and three lake basins in the PRC with the \nhighest priority for improving water quality. It includes about 120 million people, and intersects \nfour  provinces  (Hebei,  Shanxi,  Henan,  and  Shandong)  and  two  provincial-level  cities  (Beijing \nand Tianjin). The Shandong HRB (SHRB) includes 26 counties/municipalities/districts with 15.5 \nmillion people. The project area located in the northwestern part of Shandong Province is within \nthe  HRB,  and  covers  approximately  26,000  square  kilometers  (km2)  and  four  municipalities \n(Binzhou, Dezhou, Jinan, and Liaocheng). The SHRB consists of two river systems\u2014the Zhang-\nWei-Nan and Tuhai-Majia systems. \n \n4. \nThe  HRB  Plan  involves  government  intervention  at  central,  provincial,  and \nmunicipal levels. Government involvement is justified at each level in controlling the externalities \nfrom discharges of untreated wastewater, as well as managing surface water quality in a more \ncoordinated manner. Central Government involvement is justified since the HRB spans several \nprovinces  and  cities.  Likewise,  government  involvement  in  individual  projects  is  justified  since \nmunicipal wastewater management (MWM) and solid waste management (SWM) are (i) natural \nmonopolies,  (ii)  owned  by  local  governments,  and  (iii)  to  be  managed  as  independent  public \nenterprises. \n \nSimilarly, industrial paper mills are state-owned, economically sound enterprises \n5. \nthat  employ  a  significant  number  of  people.  They  provide  livelihood  opportunities  to  those \nassociated  with  the  paper  mills\u2019  operations  (farmers,  wholesalers,  and  retailers),  as  well  as \nconsiderable tax revenues to municipal governments to support local government services.

In Shandong, the World Bank has helped paper mills adopt clean production technology \nand wastewater treatment processes.  \n \n6. \nGoals and Design of the HRB Plan. In the PRC, the central and provincial levels have \ngeneral  plans  for  sustaining  economic  growth  and  development.  These  serve  as  the  basis  or \neconomic context for the goals specified and detailed in various investment plans. The Tenth 5-\nYear  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  (T5YP)  for  Shandong  Province  aims  to  sustain  high  economic  growth \nrates.  The  T5YP  recognizes  the  need  to  address  environmental  protection,  and  improve  and \nmaintain  environmental  quality  by  meeting  goals  for  surface  water  quality  and  pollutant \nreduction targets specified in the HRB Plan. \n\n7. \nIn July 2003, Shandong provincial government (SPG) developed a subsidiary plan\u2014the \nShandong HRB Environmental Protection Plan (SHRB Plan)\u2014for managing water quality in the \npart  of  the  province  that  is  within  the  HRB.  The  surface  water  quality  targets  identified  in  the \nSHRB  Plan  are  similar  to  those  in  the  HRB  Plan.2 Municipal  and  county  governments  were \nrequired to make investments in wastewater and solid waste management, and to manage the \ncompleted  facilities.  The  SHRB  Plan  is  reasonably  sound  and  integrated  with  the  overall \nplanning  process.  Moreover,  it  is  in  line  with  the  national  approach  of  targeting  major  point-\nsource polluters as the most cost-effective measure in improving water quality. \n \n \nAll subprojects in the proposed Project are an integral component in the SHRB Plan, and \n8. \nwill contribute to meeting the established water quality targets in the receiving water bodies, and \nin  meeting  the  targets  of  the  HRB  Plan:  (i)  protection  of  important  drinking  water  sources;  (ii) \ncentralized wastewater treatment for protection of Bohai Bay; and (iii) clean production, waste \nminimization,  and  recycling.  The  SHRB  Plan  specifically  states  that  rehabilitation  of  the  Tuhai \nRiver and Majia River are priority projects, and requires that all municipalities and counties take \nappropriate  action  on  pollution  control.  All  proposed  subprojects  are  in  the  Tuhai\u2013Majia  River \nsystem. \n \n9. \nEach  municipal  wastewater  treatment  plant  (WWTP)  will  be  designed  at  least \ncost,  in  terms  of  location,  scale  (planning  horizon),  and  treatment  technology.  Detailed \nevaluation  of  options  has  been  undertaken  to  meet  the  least-cost  criterion.3 The  design  has \nincorporated three crucial factors: (i) all significant point sources in the surrounding areas were \nto be controlled, (ii) all wastewater generators should face the same effluent charge, and (iii) the \ncharge  will  approximate  the  marginal  cost  of  processing  wastewater  at  the  municipal  WWTP. \nAccording to standard economic theory, these principles can be considered sufficient to provide \neconomic incentives for least-cost management of wastewater across all point sources.4    \n \n\n9. \n\n                                                 \n2   See  Appendix  6  and  the  main  text  of  this  report  for  several  important  targets  on  chemical  oxygen  demand  and \n\nammonia nitrogen for the project areas. \n\n3  The  least-cost  analysis  of  municipal  WWTPs  for  Binzhou,  Gaotang,  and  Shanghe  has  compared  the  technical \nalternatives of an anoxic/oxic (A/O) process, an oxidation ditch, and an intermittent cycle extension aeration system \n(ICEAS) process. The A/O process had the lowest average incremental economic cost (AIEC). For Linqing WWTP, \nthe alternatives examined were the submerged biological filter, the aerated biological filter, and an oxidation ditch. \nThe submerged biological filter had the lowest AIEC. \n\n4   Hanley,  N.J.

The  Project  is  a  critical \ncomponent  of  the  established  SHRB  Plan,  and  represents  a  least-cost  approach  to  achieving \nincremental improvements in environmental quality. Though limited in scope, it achieves public \nsupport  through  public  participation  in  the  planning  process,  stakeholder  consultations,  and \nsurveys  undertaken  as  part  of  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  Of  the  800 \nrespondents  in  project  areas,  52%  ranked  MWM  and  SWM  improvements  as  priority \ninvestments.  A  majority  of  survey  respondents  were  willing  to  pay  directly  for  environmental \nfacilities and services.  \n \nC. \n \n11. \nIn addition to being part of the HRB Plan, each subproject is economically justified on its \nown. Economic internal rates of return (EIRR) were estimated for MWM, industrial wastewater \nmanagement  (IWM),  and  SWM  subprojects.  The  EIRRs  were  compared  with  economic \nopportunity  cost  of  capital  (EOCC),  which  was  assumed  to  be  12%.  Major  economic  benefits \nthat were quantified for each component include the following:   \n \n\nEvaluation of Individual Subprojects \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ntechnology \n\nMunicipal wastewater management: (a) tariff revenues paid by nonindustrial and \nindustrial  customers;  (b)  cost  savings  on  environmental  cleanup  of  canals  and \nwaterways  by  municipal  governments;  and  (c)  recycled  effluent  (100%  for \nGaotang WWTP, 50% for Linqing WWTP, and 75% for Binzhou WWTP).   \nIndustrial wastewater management: Direct economic benefits of adopting cleaner \nfrom  (a)  direct  reduction  of \nproduction \nconventional  pollutants,  such  as  chemical  oxygen  demand  (COD),  biochemical \noxygen  demand,  and  ammonia  in  their  WWTPs;  (b)  reuse  of  steam  energy  and \ncooking  chemicals;  (c)  industrial  reuse  of  the  reclaimed  water,  sparing  good \nquality  water  for  drinking  or  other  domestic  uses;  and  (d)  preventing  substantial \namounts of unregulated salts from entering the HRB. \nSolid waste management: (a) willingness to pay; and (b) cost savings on disease \nprevention/eradication, and environment cleanup. \n\ninclude  cost  savings \n\n \n12. \nEconomic analysis was conducted over 25 years, including project construction in 2006 \nand  completion  in  2011.  Economic  benefits  and  costs  are  denominated  in  domestic  price \nnumeraire  at  constant  2005  prices.  Foreign  currency  costs  were  converted  to  local  currency \ncosts  using  an  exchange  rate  of  CNY8.11  per  $1  and  adjusted  based  on  purchasing  power \nparity  assumption.  Project  tradable  components  were  adjusted  to  economic  prices  using \nshadow exchange rate factor of 1.013 and nontradable components valued at domestic market \nprices. Project costs and benefits were estimated on a without- and with-project basis. Transfer \npayments  were  excluded  in  the  valuation  of  cost  estimates  in  economic  prices.  Standard \nsensitivity tests, and additional tests for 1-year implementation delay and 20% increase in costs, \nwere conducted. Sensitivity indicator (SI) and switching value (SV) were calculated.5 \n \n13.  Municipal  Wastewater  Management.

The  Changyuan  Paper  Mill  and  Quanlin  Paper \nMill subprojects intend to replace the outdated technology of black liquor pretreatment with an \nalkali recovery process, which is a cleaner production technology. The current pollution control \nfacilities  of  these  two  paper  mills  would  not  meet  the  new  standards  that  the  PRC  has \nestablished for paper mills in 2007. The cleaner production processes will reduce the pollutant \nin the final effluent discharge to the rivers, which will enable the paper mills to meet the COD \ntarget  of  120  milligrams  per  liter  (mg/l)  by  2010  from  400  mg/l  in  2005.6   With  the  new  alkali \nrecovery  processes,  wastewater  quantity  will  be  reduced  greatly.  In  addition,  the  unlined \nlagoons  for  treated  black  liquor  and  lignin  storage  will  be  closed,  reducing  the  risks  of \ngroundwater  contamination.  The  paper  mills  are  vital  in  providing  livelihood  to  people \n(employees  and their families, farmers, wholesalers/retailers), as well as tax revenues to local \ngovernments.

Considering the economic growth for the next 15\u201320 years, \n15. \nand  the  projected  increase  in  waste  generation,  the  proposed  improvement  in  collection, \ntransport,  and  disposal  will  reduce  urban  pollution  in  Linyi  and  Zouping  counties  and  Linqing \ncity.7 Improving SWM services will safeguard and improve public health through the reduction in \nmany of the physical vectors that can transmit diseases (Supplementary Appendix K) .The new \nsanitary landfills with leachate and methane collection will minimize the waste discharge into the \naquifer,  reduce  groundwater  contamination,  reduce  the  greenhouse  gases  (GHG),  and  treat \nsolid  waste  in  a  more  environmentally  sound  manner.  The  clean  development  mechanism \n(CDM)  facility  and  GHG  emission  credits  will  be  pilot  tested.  Appendix  3  describes  the \napplication of the CDM facility for three SWM subprojects, which will encourage foreign private \nsector  involvement  and  provide  financial  incentives  to  implementing  agencies  to  enhance  (i) \nwaste  collection,  (ii)  landfill  gas  (LFG)  extraction,  and  (iii)  methane  destruction/utilization \n(methane comprises approximately 50% of LFG). Economic analyses were undertaken with the \nCDM facility. Economic benefits were estimated based on willingness to pay per household per \nmonth,  households  served,  cost  savings  from  disease  prevention  and  mitigation  costs  of  local \ngovernments8. The EIRRs calculated for the SWM subprojects were higher than the EOCC. The \nanalysis  further  indicated  that  SWM  subprojects  are  feasible  under  various  sensitivity  tests. \nBased on SI and SV parameters, the subprojects are more sensitive to a reduction in benefits \nthan an increase in costs.9   \n\n \n\nScenario \n \n \n\n \nBase Case \nCase 1: 10% increase \nin costs \nCase 2: 10% decrease in \nbenefits \nCase 3: 10% increase in costs \nand 10% decrease in benefits \nCase 4: one-year \nimplementation delay \nCase 5: Costs increase by \n20% \nCase 6: WWTP benefits only \n \n\nTable A14.3: Results of Economic Analysis of SWM Subprojects \nZouping SWM \n\nLinqing SWM \nSI \n\nSV \n\nLinyi SWM \nSI \n\nSV \n\nEIRR  NPV \n(106 \n(%) \nCNY) \n \n48.2 \n39.7 \n\n \n21.7 \n19.5 \n\n \n\n \n\nEIRR  NPV \n(106 \n(%) \nCNY) \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n1.7 \n\n \n56.7 \n\n19.4 \n16.8 \n\n23.6 \n16.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n3.22  30.98 \n\nSI \n\nSV \n\nEIRR  NPV \n(106 \n(%) \nCNY) \n50.4 \n41.7 \n36.7 \n\n 22.4 \n20.0 \n19.7 \n\n \n\n \n\n1.7 \n2.7 \n\n \n\n \n57.9 \n36.7 \n\n19.2 \n\n34.9 \n\n2.7 \n\n36.2 \n\n16.5 \n\n13.6 \n\n4.2 \n\n23.66 \n\n17.5 \n\n28.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n17.1 \n\n26.4 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n13.9 \n\n6.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n22.3 \n\n48.6 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n21.6 \n\n46.4 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n19.3 \n\n22.6 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n17.9 \n\n33.0 \n\n1.7 \n\n58.0 \n\n17.5 \n\n31.2 \n\n1.7 \n\n56.7 \n\n14.4 \n\n8.4 \n\n3.2 \n\n31.1 \n\n12.2 \n\n1.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n12.6 \n\n2.5 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n(35.9) \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEIRR  =  economic  internal  rate  of  return,  NPV  =  net  present  value,  SI  =  sensitivity  indicator,  SV  =  switching  value, \nSWM = solid waste management, WTP = willingness to pay. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n7 The subprojects include a new lined landfill, leachate collection and treatment systems, and associated rolling stock \nand  equipment.
