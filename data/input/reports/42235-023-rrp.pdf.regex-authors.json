I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for subprogram 2 of the Microfinance \nDevelopment Program.1 \n \n2.  The programmatic approach  comprises two subprograms sequenced to support the \ngovernment in developing a sustainable market-oriented microfinance2 in line with the Vietnam \nMicrofinance Development Strategy, 2011\u20132020.3 It focuses on (i) creating a supportive policy \nand  regulatory  environment,  (ii)  enhancing  supervisory  and  regulatory  capacities,  \n(iii) strengthening financial institutions involved in microfinance, and (iv) developing financial \ninfrastructure.  The  proposed  policy-based  loan  will  support  subprogram  2.  The  Viet  Nam \ncountry  partnership  strategy  2012\u20132015  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  highlights \nmicrofinance as a key area for ADB assistance.4  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Extensive outreach in microcredit delivery needing sustainability. ADB\u2019s special \nevaluation study on the Microfinance Development Strategy 20005 found that, as of 2010, Viet \nNam attained a much higher penetration rate of 75% of microcredit delivery relative to other \nAsian countries. The Vietnam Bank for Social Policies (VBSP)6 has remarkable microcredit \noutreach to 98% of 11,000 communes with almost 7 million borrowers, of which 50% are \ncategorized as poor. VBSP has a dominant share of 67% of total microfinance borrowers and \n65% of outstanding microfinance loans in 2010. However, the extensive outreach achieved \nthrough the current state-driven approach cannot be sustained into the future. \n \n4.  Achievement  with  an  adverse  impact.  The  notably  high  outreach  of  microcredit \ndelivery has, however, resulted in adverse impacts: (i) increased fiscal burden through financing \noperations and interest rate subsidies, and budget allocation to lending resources, making the \nsystem unsustainable; and (ii) unequal treatment with the state-driven approach discouraging \nthe entry and expansion of market-based financial institutions. With persistent budget deficit \nrecorded since 2009, the sustainability of VBSP became at risk.  \n \n5.  Sector reform with policy change. Against this background, in 2010, the government \nrefocused microfinance as a formal banking service from a social protection tool. This policy \nchange  was  a  timely  response  to  the  rising  demands  of  low-income  household  and \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB\u2019s microfinance development strategy defines microfinance as \u201cthe provision of a broad range of financial \nservices such as deposits, loans, payment services, money transfers, and insurance to poor and low-income \nhouseholds and, their microenterprises\u201d (ADB. 2000. Finance for the Poor: Microfinance Development Strategy, \nManila). \n3  Vietnam Microfinance Development Strategy, 2011\u20132020 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n4  ADB. 2012.

Manila: ADB. \n6  VBSP is a government-owned policy bank operating social policy lending programs. \n ", "2 \nmicroenterprise clients needing diverse financial services suitable to them.7 The new direction \ncalled for sector-wide reform to transform state-led credit delivery to a wider variety of market-\ndriven financial services including savings, credit, remittances and insurance. \n \n6.  Formulation of the national microfinance development strategy. In December 2011, \nthe Prime Minister announced the Vietnam Microfinance Development Strategy, 2011\u20132020 \nformulated with ADB assistance.8  The national strategy provides a road map to developing a \nmarket-oriented  system,  relying  more  on  self-sustaining  financial  institutions  in  providing \nmarket-based  financial  services,  while  the  government  provides  an  enabling  environment \nthrough  regulations  and  supervision,  capacity  development,  and  financial  infrastructure \nsupportive  to  microfinance  transactions.  The  Microfinance  Working  Committee 9  guides \nimplementation of the national strategy and provides policy advice and coordination to the work \nplan. Further, the implementation of the national strategy requires a comprehensive program \nwhich ADB agreed to support.  \n \n7.  ADB assistance. On 5 July 2012, ADB approved the programmatic approach for the \nMicrofinance Development Program and a $40 million policy-based loan for subprogram 1 and \n$0.5 million attached technical assistance (TA).10 It was the first full-scale ADB assistance after \nover a decade of TA projects in nurturing formal microfinance institutions (MFIs).11 The program \nsupports government initiatives to develop a vibrant microfinance sector and improve access to \nformal  financial  services  for  the  poor,  especially  in  rural  areas.  It  aims  to  promote  fair \ncompetition  among  diverse  financial  institutions,  and  support  a  market  orientation  in \nmicrofinance, thereby gradually reducing the government\u2019s direct involvement in microfinance \noperations. Lessons from the past ADB assistance and other development partners identified \nthe following four major requirements still lacking in Viet Nam: \n \n(i)  Supportive policy and regulatory environment. The development of inclusive \nand  sustainable  microfinance  requires  a  supportive  policy  and  regulatory \nenvironment. This includes key development policy and banking legislation to \npromote microfinance; \n(ii)  Enhanced  supervisory  capacity  for  effective  supervision  and  regulation \nover microfinance. To promote quality financial services, supervisory capacity \nneeds to be enhanced. This can be achieved through training on supervisory \nskills and procedures, securing a pool of microfinance supervisors;  \n(iii)  Strengthened  financial  institutions  involved  in  microfinance.  A  vibrant \nmicrofinance sector can be developed by strengthening three different types of \nfinancial  institutions  involved  in  microfinance;  VBSP  seeking  self-sustaining \n                                                \n7  In Viet Nam, the microenterprise is defined as \u201ca business entity with less than 10 employees\u201d by Government \nDecree  No.  56/2009/ND-CP  of  30  June  2009  on  assistance  for  development  of  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises. \n8  ADB. 2010.

Manila (TA7499-VIE). \n9  Microfinance Working Committee was established in March 2014, by virtue of the Prime Minister Decision 381/QD-\nTTg. The committee comprises SBV governor as the chair; SBV vice governor as the vice chair, high-level \nrepresentatives from the concerned agencies as well as Vietnam Women\u2019s Union, Vietnam Farmers Association, \nVietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, Vietnam Bank for Social Policies, and the Cooperative Bank. \n10 ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n11 In Viet Nam, the microfinance institution is defined as \u201ca credit institution engaged in banking activities with the aim \nof serving low-income individuals, households and microenterprises\u201d by Credit Institutions Law 2010, Article 4. 5.  \n ", "3 \noperations,  people\u2019s  credit  funds  (PCFs)  supported  by  an  effective  apex \ninstitution, and MFIs strengthening their operational capacity. \n(iv)  Financial  infrastructure  supportive  to  microfinance.  Sound  microfinance \ndevelopment  requires  supportive  financial  infrastructure  including  training \ninstitutes to enhance overall sector capacity, a microcredit information exchange \nsystem to secure loan portfolio quality, and financial literacy programs aiming to \nenhance knowledge in microfinance and protect clients. \n \n8.  Following the achievements in subprogram 1, subprogram 2 has continued to support \nthe government in implementing comprehensive microfinance sector reform by focusing on \nthese four broad areas (para. 7), aiming to achieve self-sustaining operations and improved \nfinancial services, leading to greater financial inclusion, and a deepened finance sector. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact will be greater financial inclusion and deepened finance sector. The outcome \nwill  be  increased  access  of  low-income  clients  to  diverse,  sustainable,  and  affordable \nmicrofinance services.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n10.  All  policy  actions  including  9  triggers  and  12  milestones  have  been  complied  with \n(Appendix 4). There were minor modifications to five policy actions. Policy actions 2-2, 2-3 and \n2-15  were  revised from  the  issuance  of  implementing rules  and  regulations  (IRRs)  to  the \nformulation of IRRs. The IRRs, in the form of State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) circulars, are \nexpected to be issued in early 2015 after a careful approval process of the government which \nincluded impact studies. Policy action 2-4 was revised to reflect the overachievement of the \naction.12  Policy action 2-9 was revised to more precisely reflect the government action, to the \nissuance of IRRs on MFI supervision, from original action of approval and implementation of the \nManual of Supervision for MFIs. This is because an MFI is supervised as a credit institution \nunder the prudential norms applicable to the banking sector, requiring microfinance specific \nIRRs but not a separate supervision manual. Subprogram 2, through implementation of its \npolicy actions, has delivered the following outputs. \n \n11.  Output 1: A policy and regulatory environment conducive to the development of \nan  inclusive  and  sustainable  market-oriented  microfinance  sector.  Following  the \nformulation of a development strategy for microfinance under subprogram 1, subprogram 2 \nhelped the government implement the strategy and formulate detailed regulations. Detailed \nregulations  on  MFI  licensing  and  sound  operations  are  needed  to  support  the  increasing \nnumber of semiformal MFIs becoming formal financial institutions under SBV prudential norms. \nFormalization will help these MFIs achieve the full potential to provide a variety of formal \nfinancial services while complying with prudential requirements. Following the promulgation of \nthe Credit Institutions Law, 2010 and the formulation of the Vietnam Microfinance Development \nStrategy, 2011\u20132020 under subprogram 1, the Banking Supervision Agency (BSA) of SBV \nformulated rules and regulations on sound microfinance operations, governance structure, and \n                                                \n12 The original policy action called for the conduct of a study on options for fiscal and regulatory incentives to promote \nthe microfinance sector. Following the study, the government introduced incentives for MFIs in the form of lower \ncorporate income tax. Flexible interest rates were also allowed for microfinance services. These fiscal and \nregulatory incentives promote the sustainability of microfinance operations.  \n ", "4 \nconsumer protection. An SBV circular on PCF licensing, organization structure and operations \nwas formulated to guide PCFs in the conduct of sustainable microfinance operations for their \nclients under subprogram 2. SBV circulars on MFI licensing, ownership, and governance, and \non MFI prudential requirements were formulated as well to promote sustainable growth of MFIs. \n \n12.  The government also responded to the growing demand for insurance services suitable \nand accessible to the low-income segment with a two-step approach to setting up the regulatory \nframework.  While  the  Insurance  Supervisory  Agency  at  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  is \nformulating the microinsurance regulations for issuance and implementation in 2015, it has \nissued  a  set  of  regulations  guiding  the  sound  operation  of  approved  microinsurance  pilot \nprojects. This interim regulation meets the growing demand for microinsurance with a semi-\nformal status, while ensuring its reliability until the final regulatory framework is formulated. The \npolicy and advisory TA attached to the subprogram 1 loan has provided policy advice and \nsupported the formulation of the microinsurance regulations (footnote 10).  \n \n13.  Output 2: Strengthened supervisory and regulatory capacities of the microfinance \nsector regulators. The supervisory capacity of SBV and MOF over microfinance needs to be \nstrengthened through training to supervisors based on newly issued microfinance rules and \nregulations. Subprogram 1 initiatives helped the inclusion of microfinance as a formal banking \nservice under the SBV\u2019s supervision. Under subprogram 2, an associated capacity development \nTA has been providing supervisory training sessions, and supporting regulatory agencies to \ndeploy an adequate number of qualified and experienced supervisors in charge of microfinance \noperations.13 The ADB TA has been coordinated with the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement \nand the World Bank in strengthening BSA\u2019s supervision over the PCF system and MFIs in \nconducting  microfinance  operations.  Further,  subprogram  2  complements  the  assistance \nprovided by the Government of Canada to enhance BSA\u2019s regulation over the banking sector as \na whole. ADB has been working closely with the International Finance Corporation in conducting \na diagnostic study on responsible finance in Viet Nam. Results of the study will enable the ADB \nTA further develop microfinance training modules.14  \n \n14.  Since MFIs and PCFs are allowed to mobilize deposits, prudential regulations based on \ninternational banking supervisory standards are applied to ensure the stability of these financial \ninstitutions and protect their depositors. At the same time, considering the unique characteristics \nof  microfinance,15 supervisory  practices  and  procedures  have  been  adapted  to  maintain  a \nminimal  cost  to  the  supervised  financial  institutions,  as  cost  affects  the  efficiency  of  a \nmicrofinance  operation  given  its  labor-intensive  business  model  dealing  with  many  small \naccounts.  Subprogram  2,  with  the  policy  and  advisory  TA  inputs,  has  encouraged  both \nmicrofinance supervisors and operators to rely on the globally accepted loan monitoring system \nin  generating  reports  to  comply  with  supervisory  requirements  based  on  a  risk-based \napproach.16 The recommended loan monitoring practice has been included in training provided \nby the capacity development TA, helping strengthen microfinance supervision and operation.   \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Strengthening Microfinance Sector \nOperation and Supervision. Manila (TA 8391-VIE).  \n14 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Microfinance lending is provided in a smaller amount than traditional lending, not secured by a traditional collateral \nsuch as land, land use right and chattels, but by the borrower\u2019s future cash flow.  \n16 For  supervisors,  loan  monitoring  for  microfinance  should  be  a  risk-based  approach  focusing  on  financial \ninstitutions' risk management capacity and procedures, given a huge number of small accounts involved in \nmicrofinance.  Peculiar  features of microfinance  should  be  well  understood by  supervisors  to  examine  how \neffectively a monitoring system works. Microfinance operators should demonstrate their monitoring procedures, \norganizational structure, appropriate skills mix, and other related capacities needed by adequacy requirements. \n ", "5 \n \n15.  Output 3: Credit institutions involved in microfinance strengthened to provide \naffordable and sustainable services to the poor. Following reforms initiated by subprogram \n1,  subprogram  2  has  strengthened  three  major  types  of  financial  institutions  providing \nmicrofinance in Viet Nam: VBSP, PCFs and MFIs. \n \n16.  Vietnam Bank for Social Policies. Despite its leading status in microcredit delivery, \nVBSP\u2019s over dependence on government resources and its focus on social policy lending have \nresulted in the following adverse impacts: \n \n(i)  growing fiscal burden caused by the public financing of VBSP operations, posing \na serious threat to the sustainability of future VBSP operations;  \n(ii)  traditional focus on credit delivery not meeting client needs for other financial \nservices  such  as  savings,  which  could  have  supported  VBSP\u2019s  lending \noperations and enhanced self-sustainability; and \n(iii)  unequal treatment due to government subsidies to VBSP, which can discourage \nthe entry of other market-based microfinance operators and hamper a sound \ncompetition. \n \n17.  Following policy dialogue on VBSP reform under subprogram 1, subprogram 2 called for \nand confirmed two key policy actions: (i) the Prime Minister\u2019s approval of the development \nstrategy  of  VBSP  to  2020  aiming  to  transform  VBSP  to  a  more  self-sustaining  financial \ninstitution, and (ii) strengthening of the capacity of VBSP and its savings and credit groups for \nmarket-based operations through training and advocacy along with ADB\u2019s capacity development \nTA. The average interest rate of VBSP\u2019s lending has come closer to the market rate, accounting \nfor  about  80%  of  the  market  rate,  improved  from  about  40%  since  2012.  The  program\u2019s \nmedium-term direction requires close monitoring of the review process on the government\u2019s role \nin micro-credit delivery; and the shift of VBSP operations to self-sustenance with further market \norientation through increased deposit mobilization, enhanced information technology solutions, \nand financial product development. \n \n18.  People\u2019s  credit  fund  system. A key thrust in strengthening the PCF system is to \nestablish an apex institution supportive to financing and capacity development needs of member \nPCFs  and  small  community-based  financial  institutions.  The  traditional  role  of  the  Central \nPeople\u2019s Credit Fund (CCF) has been enhanced with clear mandates and greater authority \ngranted to its successor \u2013 Cooperative Bank under subprogram 2. Cooperative Bank is vested \nwith the deputized authority to supervise PCFs and the mandate to help PCFs strengthen their \noperational capacity and financial positions. The government\u2019s capital injection to Cooperative \nBank assisted in developing the PCF system during the subprogram 2 period.  \n \n19.  Emerging microfinance  institutions. Subprogram 1 supported formalization of two \nMFIs licensed by SBV under the old licensing requirements. New regulations were formulated \nunder subprogram 2 to facilitate formalization of an increasing number of MFIs. The impacts of \nformalization includes: (i) diversification of funding source including deposits from the public and \ndonor funding; (ii) enhanced operating capacity with qualified staff motivated by the formalized \nstatus; (iii) a wider variety of savings products offered to clients; and (iv) an extended outreach \nto clients.  As of December 2013, clients of licensed and unlicensed MFIs accounted for only \n7%  of  all  microfinance  clients.  However,  MFI  operations  have  been  growing  rapidly  with \n ", "6 \ngovernment support and ADB assistance.17 During 2010-2012, five major MFIs under ADB\u2019s \nearlier  assistance18 increased  their  client  number  by  92%,  credit  provision  by  180%,  and \nsavings mobilized by 364%. Other MFIs participating in the ADB project also increased their \noutreach to clients by 20% on average during the same period. The proven growth potential of \nprivate  sector-led  MFIs  should  be further  promoted  by facilitating formalization  under  SBV \nprudential norms. The number of newly licensed MFIs is expected to grow in the future under \nthe development framework formulated by subprogram 2.  \n \n20.  Table 1 provides an overview of microfinance lending by financial institutions in 2010 \nand 2013. All three types of financial institutions covered by the program (i.e., VBSP, PCFs, and \nMFIs)  achieved  steady  growth  in  their  loan  portfolios,  taking  a  share  of  the  microfinance \noperations  of  the  Vietnam  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development,  a  state-owned \ncommercial bank. \n \nTable 1: Microfinance Lendinga by Financial Institutions \n  Number of Borrowers  Loans Outstanding  Average  \n(million)  ($ million)  Loan Size ($) \nInstitution  2010  2013  2010  2013  2010  2013 \nVietnam Bank for Social    7.8b   7.0  4,398  5,350    564    764 \nPolicies \nVietnam Bank for Agriculture  3.2  1.5  3,500  1,390  1,094    927 \nand Rural Development \nPeople\u2019s credit funds  1.0  1.1  1,006  1,294  1,006  1,176 \nMicrofinance institutionsc  0.6  0.8     122     189     203     236 \na Based on the State Bank of Vietnam definition of a microfinance lending with the amount up to D30 million ($1,423). \nb In 2010, Vietnam Bank for Social Policies (VBSP) recorded a borrower as an individual. In 2012, VBSP started to \nrecord a borrower by a household, which includes several VBSP borrowers. This ongoing change resulted in the \nnumber of VBSP borrowers decreasing.   \nc Microfinance institutions include formal (licensed) and semi-formal (unlicensed) institutions involved in microfinance \nservices. \nSources: Vietnam Bank for Social Policies, Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, Central People's \nCredit Fund, and Viet Nam Microfinance Sector Assessment and its updates prepared by ADB. 2010, 2011, 2012, \n2013, 2014.

Under subprogram 2, the Microfinance Center was set up within \nthe Banking Academy19 through an SBV Decision.20  A budget allocation was also made for its \noperation in 2013 and 2014. It is a leading training institute for the microfinance industry, \ncollaborating with other training institutes such as training units of VBSP, Cooperative Bank, the \nVietnam Microfinance Working Group, as well as large MFIs. In cooperation with these partners, \nthe Microfinance Center has responded, on a fee basis, to needs for capacity development \nthrough training, research, and training needs assessment. ADB\u2019s capacity development TA has \nbeen collaborating with the Microfinance Center in strengthening capacity for operation and \nsupervision in the microfinance sector, and supporting knowledge sharing on microfinance. In \nthe medium term, the Microfinance Center is expected to play a hub role in enhancing the \noverall capacity of microfinance stakeholders ranging from policy makers to practitioners in \nconducting best practices in microfinance. \n \n24.  Microcredit  information  exchange  system.  SBV  issued  Circular  No.  03/2013/TT-\nNHNN on 28 January 2013 mandating all credit institutions to report all credit information to the \nCredit Information Center (CIC) in SBV. Prior to the circular, only loans of D50 million and above \nwere required for reporting, thus microcredit information was not covered by the CIC system. \nSubprogram 2 and the policy and advisory TA attached to the subprogram 1 loan (footnote 10) \nhelped CIC set up a microcredit information exchange system. The new system accesses all \nformal financial institutions operating microfinance which, in turn, upload and access credit \ninformation at the CIC system in an effective and cost-efficient manner, helping ensure the \nquality of the loan portfolio through proper client selection and credit management. \n \n25.  Formulation and implementation of financial literacy programs. The government \nhas allocated budget to VBSP and CCF in formulating and implementing advocacy and financial \nliteracy  programs  on  sustainable  microfinance  and  customer  protection  to  their  clients, \nmanagement and staff, credit and savings groups, and government agencies concerned. ADB\u2019s \ncapacity development TA will complement the implementation. The programs help promote \nbetter understanding of stakeholders on the importance of sustainable microfinance, relevant \nrules  and  regulations,  and  client-protection  practices  including  pricing  transparency  and \ngrievance  procedures.  It  empowers  clients  to make  informed  choices for  useful  access  to \nmicrofinance services and protects them from inappropriate transactions. The financial literacy \nprograms under subprogram 2 should be further developed to a nationwide program in the \nmedium  term,  helping  establish  a  unified  vision  and  common  understanding  on  the  basic \nprinciples and good practices in a robust and responsive microfinance sector. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n26.  The program is a programmatic approach comprising two single-tranche subprograms. \nSubprogram 1 comprises a single tranche loan of SDR25,919,000 covering April 2008\u2013June \n2012. Subprogram 2, with an amount of SDR33,723,000, covers July 2012\u2013September 2014.  \n \n27.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR33,723,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance subprogram 2. The loan \nwill have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \n                                                \n19 The Banking Academy is a national university under the auspices of the Ministry of Education and the State Bank \nof Vietnam providing professional training and research in the fields of economics, finance, and banking.  \n20 SBV Decision No. 278/QD-HV-TCCB of 27 December 2012. \n ", "8 \nloan  agreement.  The  proceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  disbursed  upon  loan \neffectiveness  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.21 The government will use the local \ncurrency counterpart funds generated by the loan proceeds to meet program expenditures and \nassociated costs of reform, and will provide the necessary budget appropriations to finance the \ncosts relating to the implementation of reforms under the program.  \n \n28.  The programmatic approach has supported reforms outlined in the development policy \nletter (Appendix 3) and policy matrix (Appendix 4). The loan amount is determined by the \nsignificance  of the microfinance  sector to  the overall  economy, the  expected  development \nimpact  of  the  policy  package,  and  the  development  financing  needs  of  the  government, \nincluding costs for (i) developing the formal MFI sector to improve services to clients; (ii) helping \nVBSP  to  increase  its  self-sustainability  along  with  its  development  strategy;  \n(iii)  supporting  the  transformation  of  CCF  to  Cooperative  Bank  and  improving  the  PCF\u2019s \ncapacity  to  better  serve  their  clients;  and  (iv)  helping  the  Banking  Academy  establish  the \nMicrofinance Center to provide capacity development services to the microfinance sector. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n29.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 2.  SBV, as the executing \nagency, established a steering committee to provide overall policy direction and coordination for \nprogram implementation. The steering committee is chaired by the SBV deputy governor, with \nhigh officials representing stakeholders including MOF, VBSP, Cooperative Bank, CIC, and the \nBanking Academy as members. SBV also established a program management unit to provide \ntechnical support to the steering committee. The unit oversees loan implementation, confirms \npolicy  actions  taken,  coordinates  associated  TA  activities  among  implementing  agencies, \nundertakes program administration, and communicates with ADB on behalf of the government.  \nThe implementing agencies will be SBV, MOF, VBSP, Cooperative Bank, CIC, and the Banking \nAcademy, each of which is responsible for compliance with policy actions tasked for, program \nreporting, and discussing implementing issues with SBV.  \n \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  July 2012\u2013September 2014 \nEstimated completion date  June 2015 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Steering committee chaired by the SBV deputy governor, with agencies and \nstakeholders representing the Ministry of Finance, VBSP, Cooperative Bank, \nCIC, and the Banking Academy. \n(ii)   Executing agency  SBV \n(iii)  Implementing agencies  MOF, VBSP, Cooperative Bank, CIC, and the Banking Academy \nDisbursement  The $50 million loan will be disbursed in a single tranche. \nCIC = Credit Information Center, MOF= Ministry of Finance, SBV = State Bank of Vietnam, VBSP = Vietnam Bank for \nSocial Policies. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nIII.

An assessment of the benefits and costs of the policy reforms under subprogram 2 will \nprovide an estimate of net benefits accounting for nearly $250 million, equivalent to 0.15% of \ngross domestic product. Benefits are brought by economic growth from allocative efficiency \nresulting from an enabling policy and regulatory environment for sustainable market-oriented \nmicrofinance, improvement in savings mobilization,  increased sustainability of VBSP, lower \nfiscal  burden  from  the  reduction  of  direct  subsidies,  strengthened  PCF  network,  and \nformalization of MFIs. Estimated gross benefits account for some $450 million. Costs, estimated \nat around $200 million, comprise (i) administrative costs incurred by legislative and/or regulatory \ninitiatives,  and  policy  and  strategy  formulation  and  implementation;  (ii)  enforcement  costs \nincurred by SBV supervision and examination over Cooperative Bank, PCFs, VBSP, and MFIs; \nMOF  supervision  over  VBSP;  and  microinsurance;  and  (iii)  fiscal  costs  incurred  by  equity \ninfusion into Cooperative Bank, budgetary allocation to the Microfinance Center, and reduced \ntax rate applied to MFIs.22  \n \nB.  Governance \n \n31.  The  government\u2019s  public  management  reforms  include  the  enactment  of  the  Anti-\nCorruption Law, 2005 establishing a legal framework to protect and reward whistle-blowers. The \nBudget Law, 2002 is under review to improve budget execution and monitoring by enhancing \nthe  implementation  of  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework  and  performance-based \nbudgeting. Aggregate public debt information has been disclosed through the implementation of \nthe National External Debt and Public Debt Strategy, 2011\u20132020. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government.   \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n32.  The  government\u2019s  5-year  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132015  aims  to \nachieve a sustainable economic development and reduce the poverty rate by 2% each year \nthrough  various  economic  reforms,  including  reforms  of  commercial  banks  and  financial \ninstitutions.23 The  program  aims  at  an  overall  reform to  develop  microfinance  as  a formal \nbanking  service  in  response  to  the  rising  demands  of  microenterprise  and  low-income \nhousehold clients in need for diverse financial services suitable and accessible to them in \nconducting  their  businesses  and  livelihood  activities.  The  program  encourages  a  sound \ncompetition  among  diverse  types  of  microfinance  providers  in  an  improved  enabling \nenvironment for operations, which will benefit their clients with easier access to lower cost and \nmore  flexible  financial  services.  Moreover,  the  program  supports  strategic  reform  and \ndevelopment of VBSP to a self-sustaining microfinance operating financial institution, increasing \nfiscal space for social development purposes. Subprogram 2 is categorized as providing some \ngender  benefits.  The  microcredit  information  exchange  system  developed  will  report  sex-\ndisaggregated client data, helping formulate initiatives to promote gender empowerment (para. \n26). \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n33.  Subprogram  2  is  categorized  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples.  \n                                                \n22 Summary Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Poverty rate in 2013 is 10% according to Government Statistics Office estimate in 2014. \n ", "10 \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n34.  Subprogram  2  assumes  political  and  macroeconomic  stability  in  the  country  and \ncontinued adoption of sound macroeconomic policies. Despite the sound track record of Viet \nNam, implementation of the program is still subject to risks described in Table 3. Major risks and \nmitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.24 \n \nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisk  Mitigating Measures \nExogenous,  The government is strengthening its monetary policy framework, expanding the tax \ninternational  base, and strengthening public expenditure management with the assistance of \nfinancial shock,  development partners. ADB and other development partners in Viet Nam, including \nand  the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, hold regular consultative \nmacroeconomic  meetings with the government on macroeconomic policy and the stability and \ninstability  development of the financial sector.  \nPolitical resistance  The government has shown strong commitment to the reform agenda. Its \nand vested  commitment is also manifested in the scope of policy and regulatory reforms across \ninterest against  the finance sector. The Microfinance Development Program reduces this risk by \nthe reform  focusing policy actions on key reforms, which will have a high impact, with firm and \nwide support from the government and stakeholders. \nPoor governance  The government is increasingly adopting a tougher stance on corruption and has \nand corruption  recently taken measures, including enacting the Anti-Corruption Law, 2005 and \nsetting up a steering committee against corruption. Results of investigations against \ncorruption overseen by the government inspectorate have been disclosed, and a \nlegal framework is established to protect and reward whistle-blowers. \nADB = Asian Development Bank.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n35.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \ndocuments. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n36.
