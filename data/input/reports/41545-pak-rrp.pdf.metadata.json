Large  and  long-standing \ndifferences between rural and urban economic and social structures in \nSindh  have  created  a  dual  economy:  (i)  an  industry-  and  service-\ndominated economy in Karachi and to a lesser extent in Hyderabad and \nSukkhur,  and  (ii)  an  agrarian  economy  in  the  rest  of  the  province, \ngenerally referred to as rural Sindh. The urban\u2013rural divide is so striking \nin  Sindh  that  it  should  be  taken  into  account  in  any  evaluation  of \nconstraints, opportunities, and development strategies for the province.  \n \nEconomic growth in Sindh in recent decades has been characterized by \nlarge  fluctuations.  As  a  consequence,  long-term  growth  has  been \nmoderate, which has had several implications. First, living standards \nhave improved rather slowly; from fiscal year 1995 to fiscal year 2005, \nper capita income grew by only 0.9% annually. Second, poverty has \nremained  widespread,  with  more  than  20%  of  the  population  living \nbelow the national poverty line. Third, there is general disenchantment \nwith government policies and economic prospects, with over 80% of \nprovincial residents perceiving no improvement in their lives in recent \nyears. Fourth, without faster growth, Sindh faces high unemployment. \nHaving a dynamic economy that generates income and jobs is essential \nfor ensuring prosperity and social cohesion. \n \n \n ", "ii   \nRural Sindh has over 50% of the province\u2019s population and accounts for \nabout 30% of the gross domestic product. Slow rural growth means \nwidespread rural poverty with the poverty head count ratio at 30%, \ndouble that of urban areas. The large rural\u2013urban divide is a serious \nconcern for the welfare of the rural population. Accelerating growth and \nimproving the income of the rural poor are essential for economic and \nsocial stability in Sindh.   \n  \nThe  government  of  Sindh  (GoS)  is  committed  to  improving  living \nstandards and particularly welfare and services in rural areas. The draft \nSindh  Vision  2030  envisages  \u201ca  united,  just,  resilient,  productive, \ninnovative,  industrialized,  and  prosperous  Sindh  with  a  disciplined, \ncaring society comprising of healthy, happy, and educated people.\u201d To \nachieve  this  vision,  Sindh  needs  to  embark  upon  an  accelerated, \ninclusive,  and  sustainable  development  path.  Revitalizing  the  rural \neconomy is particularly important in this regard. \n \n   \nProgram  The proposed SGARRP will promote broad-based growth. Its outcomes \nDescription  include greater private sector participation across the economy, more \nefficient  public  expenditure  management,  and  increased  investment \nand service delivery in rural areas. \n \nThese outcomes will be achieved through reforms in three core policy \nareas (CPAs): \n \n(i)  CPA  1:  Promote  private  sector  participation  by \n(a) establishing  an  institutional  basis  for  public\u2013private \npartnerships  (PPPs)  in  infrastructure  and  social  service \nprovision,  and  (b)  withdrawing  the  Government\u2019s  direct \ninvolvement in commercial activities.   \n(ii)  CPA  2:  Strengthen  public  expenditure  management  by \nimproving (a) the efficiency of public investment; (b) monitoring \nand evaluation (M&E); (c) internal controls, audit compliance, \nand  legislative  oversight;  and  (d)  the  policy,  financing, \nadministration, and delivery of employee benefits. \n(iii)  CPA 3: Revitalize the rural economy by (a) increasing and \nsustaining  public  investment  in  rural  areas,  (b)  creating  an \nenabling environment for private investment by clarifying land \ntitling and reducing barriers to entry, and (c) facilitating PPP in \nservice delivery. \n \nThe SGARRP will undertake a combination of actions in the short term \n(1\u20132  years),  medium  term  (3\u20134  years),  and  long  term  (5\u20136  years) \nperiod.  Accordingly,  it is  structured  as a  cluster  that  includes  three \nsingle-tranche subprograms. The single-tranche modality is adopted to \nprovide flexibility to meet emerging reform needs and build program \nlending as a platform for the evolving policy dialogue.  \n  \nFinancing Plan  Subprogram 1 of the SGARRP will comprise a loan of $100 million \nequivalent from ADB\u2019s Asian Development Fund. The loan will have a ", "  iii\nterm of 24 years including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter, and other \nterms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  program \nagreements.  \n \nThe Islamic Republic of Pakistan will be the borrower. It will relend the \nlocal currency generated from the loan proceeds to GoS. The terms \nand conditions will be the same as those extended by ADB to Pakistan. \nGoS will assume foreign exchange and interest rate risks.   \n \nBased on the current resource envelope, subprogram 2 is provisionally \nincluded at $80 million and subprogram 3 at $120 million. GoS has \nrequested $140 million each for subprograms 2 and 3. The specific loan \nsize  and  composition  will  be  confirmed  during  the  processing  of \nsubprograms 2 and 3, on the basis of reform progress, requirements \nand availability of resources. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  GoS will ensure that the local currency counterpart funds generated by \nthe loan will be used to increase rural investment and improve rural \nservice  delivery;  support  projects  to  improve  land  records  and \ncomputerized M&E of development projects; finance seed capital for \nthe viability gap fund and the project development fund of PPP; and \nfund  restructuring  and  adjustment  costs  related  to  public  sector \nenterprises divestment or restructuring. \n   \nProgram Period and  The subprogram 1 implementation period is from April 2007 to October \nTranching  2008.  The  proceeds  of  the  $100  million  equivalent  Special  Funds \nresources  loan  will  be  available  for  withdrawal  in  a  single  tranche \nfollowing satisfactory completion of all subprogram 1 policy actions, \nloan effectiveness, and no action that materially reverses the objectives \nof SGARRP having occurred. The report and recommendation of the \nPresident for the subprogram 2 loan will be submitted for ADB Board of \nDirectors consideration about 18\u201324 months after the subprogram 1 \nloan becomes effective, subject to GoS\u2019s readiness to continue with its \nreform  agenda.  Similarly,  the  report  and  recommendation  of  the \nPresident for subprogram 3 will be submitted for Board consideration \nabout 18\u201324 months after the subprogram 2 loan becomes effective, \nagain subject to GoS\u2019s readiness to continue with the reform agenda.   \n   \nExecuting Agency   The Planning and Development Department (P&DD) of GoS will be the \nexecuting agency.  \n   \nImplementation  The executing agency will be responsible for the overall implementation \nArrangements  of subprogram 1, including coordinating the implementation of policy \nactions  by  various  departments,  program  administration, \ndisbursements, and maintenance of program records. P&DD will set up \na program management unit. To ensure line department ownership and \nimplementation effectiveness, an economic reform unit will be set up in \nthe  Finance  Department  and  a  project  management  unit  for  the \ncomputerization of land records will be set up in the Board of Revenue. \nThese  two  units  will  act  as  subprogram  management  units  of  the \n ", "iv   \nSGARRP  and  coordinate  with  the  project  management  unit  on \nimplementation.  \n \nA  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  additional  chief  secretary  for \ndevelopment, will guide SGARRP implementation. The committee will \nmeet quarterly to monitor progress and oversee the implementation of \nthe program and will post its major decisions and recommendations on \nthe SGARRP website, to be established shortly after the program loan \nbecomes effective. The major implementing agencies are P&DD; Board \nof Revenue; and the Finance, Agriculture, and Industries departments.   \n   \nProcurement and  The loan proceeds will finance the costs, excluding local duties and \nDisbursement  taxes,  of  items  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB\u2019s  member \ncountries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other \nbilateral and multilateral sources. ADB will have the right to audit the \nuse of the loan proceeds and verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s \ncertification.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Borrower \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and \nRelated Requirements for Program Loans (1998).  \n   \nProgram Benefits  The SGARRP is expected to provide substantial benefits to the people \nand Beneficiaries  of Sindh in rural and urban areas, including the following: \n \n(i)  Streamlined  role  of  the  government  and  increased  private \nsector participation. The restructuring and divestment of poorly \nperforming  public  corporations,  including  industrial  estates  and \nagricultural  markets,  will  reduce  fiscal  costs  and  promote  the \nprivate sector. The establishment of policy, institutional, financial, \nand risk-management mechanisms for PPPs will enable Sindh to \naugment more resources for investment and growth.   \n \n(ii)  More  efficient  public  investment.  The budget, planning, and \nproject-implementation  process  for  public  investments  will  be \nimproved in part by reducing the number of underfunded projects \nand  directing  scarce  resources  into  priority  projects  to  bring \ngreater  focus  and  integrity  to  the  annual  development  plan. \nProject M&E will be strengthened to ensure results. Tightening \ninternal  control  mechanisms  and  external  auditing  will  improve \nefficiency and accountability in the use of public funds.  \n \n(iii)  Improved  financial  sustainability  of  pension  and  other \nemployee  benefits.  Unifying  investment  functions,  developing \nbetter  policy  frameworks,  and  strengthening  governance  for \npension and other employee benefits will free up fiscal resources \nand reduce contingent liabilities. Improved employee benefits will \nboost  morale.  Secondary  benefits  in  the  longer  term  include \nincreased savings and asset accumulation, both contributing to \neconomic growth.   \n \n(iv)  Improved  rural  growth  and  service  delivery.  GoS  wants  to \naddress  the  imbalances  between  urban  and  rural  areas.  The ", "  v\nmajor  changes  planned  include  improving  land  records  and \namending the outdated and inappropriate agricultural market law. \nThese reforms seek to change conditions that have persisted for \ndecades if not centuries. The expected benefits from successfully \nimplementing  these  reforms  are  tremendous.  These  changes, \ntogether with the prioritization of government investment in rural \nareas and contracting out of services such as basic health care, \nwill spur rural growth and improve living standards in rural Sindh. \n \nOverall,  the  changes  will  improve  growth,  employment,  income \ngeneration, service delivery, and poverty alleviation particularly in rural \nareas.    \n   \nRisks and Mitigating  Political Risks. GoS is run by a coalition of parties, and reforms are \nMeasures  subject to agreements being reached. There is clearly a certain amount \nof tenuousness in this regard. Yet, ownership of the reform program \ncuts across political affiliations, which provides greater assurance that \nthe program is durable. The cluster modality provides for flexibility on \nspecific actions as well as timing.  \n \nGovernance Risks. SGARRP will introduce greater transparency and \naccountability in both the public and private sector, which may affect \nthose  who  benefit  from  existing  opaque  systems.  Land  titling  and, \nagricultural market reforms, a disciplined management of the annual \ndevelopment program are examples. Senior leadership in GoS is aware \nof these risks, but it requested that reforms be comprehensive. Internal \ncontrols are weak and so are external audit mechanisms. SGARRP has \nmeasures  to  deal  with  both.  Concomitant  procurement  reforms \nimplemented will reduce leakage of public funds.  \n \nMacroeconomic  Risks.  Pakistan\u2019s  macroeconomic  situation  has \nworsened significantly in recent months. The fiscal pressure on the \nfederal Government exerted by these factors is expected to flow down \nto provincial governments. The fiscal year 2009 budget of Sindh has \nfactored in this effect and reflects expectations of a higher deficit. The \ncommitment of the GoS to pushing through structural reforms by means \nof  the  SGARRP  remains  unfettered,  despite  the  heightened \nmacroeconomic risks. The SGARRP measures to tackle institutional \nand policy impediments to growth in Sindh, particularly in rural areas, \nare timely, and will help to improve the economic resilience of Sindh \nand Pakistan in the medium term. \n \nInstitutional  and  Implementation  Risks.  SGARRP  is  orientated \ntoward increased private sector participation in economic activity and \nservice delivery. This focus will reduce implementation risks that would \nnormally be caused by a bureaucracy with weak capacity. However, \nreform actions will be spearheaded by government departments and \nagencies.  Institutional  and  operational  risks  are  arguably  the  most \nimportant risks threatening the SGARRP day to day, but these are also \nrisks that GoS and ADB can work together to mitigate. \n   \n ", "vi   \n \nTechnical  Advisory TA of $800,000 equivalent from the TA funding program will \nAssistance Grant  improve  private  sector  participation  and  public  expenditure \nmanagement, supporting the effective implementation of the SGARRP. \nMajor TA activities include capacity building for PPP; proposing options \nfor introducing private management or divesting a number of public \nsector entities, introducing a computer-based M&E system for public \ninvestment; analysis of employee benefits; designing a road map for \nimplementing the computerization of the land records in the province; \nand  supporting  a  survey  of  citizens\u2019  satisfaction  with  public  service \ndelivery.  The  TA  will  also  support  the  stakeholder  consultation  and \ninteragency coordination required by the SGARRP.   \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram  cluster  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Sindh  Growth  and  Rural \nRevitalization Program (SGARRP), comprising three subprograms, and (ii) a proposed loan for \nsubprogram 1 of the SGARRP.1 This report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) \nfor improving private sector participation and public expenditure management and, if the Board \napproves the proposed program cluster and loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me \nby the Board, will approve the TA. \n \nII.  MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \nA.  The National Economy \n2.  The economy of Pakistan expanded strongly from fiscal year (FY) 2003 to FY2007. \nAnnual gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged about 7.0%. This robust growth has \nlifted per capita income, generated employment, and reduced poverty. From FY2003 to FY2007, \nper capita income grew at an average annual rate of above 13.0%, about 8.6 million new jobs \nwere created, and the poverty rate declined by 15 percentage points from 35.3% to 20.0%.2 \n \n3.  Growth momentum moderated, however, in FY2008. The GDP grew by 5.6%, compared \nwith 6.8% in the previous year. Agriculture grew by only 1.5% because of adverse weather and \npolicy constraints such as the delayed announcement of the wheat support price in FY2007. \nManufacturing has been affected by a series of shocks including international oil price hikes, \nsevere energy shortages, a slowdown in international economic activity, political uncertainty, \nand social disruption in late 2007. The sector grew by a modest 5.4%, as compared with 8.2% \nthe previous year. Pakistan\u2019s growth in recent years has been led by consumption. Enhancing \nthe role of investment in propelling sustainable growth remains a key challenge for Pakistan. \n \n4.  Macroeconomic conditions in Pakistan have especially deteriorated significantly since \nearly 2008, aggravated by the rising global food and fuel prices. The slowdown in economic \ngrowth  has  coincided  with  rising  fiscal  and  current  account  deficits  and  inflation.  Foreign \nexchange reserves have declined to historic low levels and the rupee has depreciated. Security \nconcerns are impacting on investor and consumer confidence. The global financial market \nturmoil has also compounded domestic economic woes. Restoring macroeconomic stability and \ngrowth momentum is urgently required in Pakistan. In this direction, the Government of Pakistan \nhas signed a Letter of Intent on 20 November 2008 seeking a $7.6 billion stand-by arrangement \nfrom the International Monetary Fund, as part of which broad-ranging macroeconomic reforms \nhave been agreed upon. \n \nB.  The Sindh Economy  \n5.  Sindh is Pakistan\u2019s second largest economy and second most populous province after \nPunjab. Its estimated provincial GDP (PGDP) is about $34 billion, and its estimated population \nis about 38 million. The Sindh economy grew strongly from FY2002 to FY2007 with provincial \n                                                 \n1  Appendix 1 presents the design and monitoring framework of the SGARRP. \n2  Economic Affair\u2019s Wing, Finance Division, Government of Pakistan. 2008. Pakistan Economic Survey 2007-08. \nIslamabad.  \n ", " 2 \nGDP growth averaged about 7.0%.3 The poverty ratio declined from 35.3%4 in FY2002 to \n22.4% in FY2005. \n  \n6.  Sindh\u2019s recent economic performance closely tracks the performance of Pakistan. While \nthe latest provincial growth data are not available, Sindh\u2019s economy has been affected by the \nsame adverse international and domestic factors affecting the national economy. It is likely that \nthe provincial economy has significantly slowed during the past fiscal year. Fiscal conditions \nhave  already  deteriorated.  The  FY2009  budget  estimates  that  the  fiscal  deficit  will  reach \nPRs14.1 billion (about $175 million, or about 0.6% of provincial GDP), 72% higher than the \nprevious year. Total provincial development expenditure grew at a staggering rate of 68.7% \nfrom  FY2003  to  FY2008.  This  rate  is  expected  to  decline  to  24.2%  in  FY2009,  with  net \nprovincial development outlay expected to be PRs77.3 billion.5 The budgeted size of the annual \ndevelopment plan (ADP) reflects efforts by the government of Sindh (GoS) to maintain relatively \nstrong growth in development spending. The rate of increase of recurrent expenditure has been \nkept at 14.1%, which is low real growth given the current high rate of inflation.    \n  \nIII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, ISSUES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Long-Term Economic Performance, Challenges, and Emerging Opportunities6 \n7.  Social and Economic Landscape. Sindh is an ethnically diverse province that has \nattracted many migrants from neighboring regions. Large differences between rural and urban \neconomic and social structures have created a dual economy: (i) an industry- and service-\ndominated economy in Karachi and to a lesser extent in Hyderabad and Sukkhur and (ii) an \nagrarian economy in the rest of the province, generally referred to as rural Sindh. Large-scale \nmigration to Karachi has given Sindh Pakistan\u2019s most urbanized population at nearly 50%, \ncompared  with  33%  for  the  nation  as  a  whole.  Any  evaluation  of  Sindh\u2019s  constraints, \nopportunities, and development strategies needs to take into account the urban\u2013rural divide.  \n \n8.  Subdued Long-Term Economic Performance. Sindh enjoys the advantages of having \na strategic coastal location, high levels of industrialization, and a rich endowment of labor and \nnatural resources. Yet, despite the recent economic recovery, the province has not been able to \nfully capitalize on these advantages in recent decades. There has been major fluctuation in the \ngrowth trajectory. Figure 1 shows that the degree of economic fluctuation in Sindh is more \npronounced.  Consequently,  while  GDP  growth  averaged  4.8%  from  FY1992  to  FY2005  in \nPakistan as a whole, the corresponding growth rate for Sindh was 4.3%. Many factors have \ncontributed to the inconsistent economic performance. The social unrest and ethnic conflict of \nthe 1970s, late 1980s, and late 1990s took a particular toll on Sindh\u2019s economy.  \n \n9.  Moderate  long-term  growth  has  a  number  of  consequences.  First,  the  pace  of \nimprovement in overall living standards in Sindh has been slow. From FY1995 to FY2005, per \n                                                 \n3  As official national income accounts for the provinces are not prepared in Pakistan, the PGDP data used in this \nreport are from preliminary estimates of the Sindh PGDP by the World Bank.  \n4  The poverty data is from Anwar, Talat. 2006. Trends in Absolute Poverty and Governance in Pakistan: 1998/99 \nand 2004/05, Pakistan Development Review 45:4 Part II (Winter 2006) pages 777\u2013793. The GoS believes that the \nfigures underestimate the true incidence of poverty in the province. The current paucity in data, however, prevents \nthe verification of this view. \n5  This excludes the district government development expenditure of PRs12 billion in FY2009.  \n6 This section draws from World Bank and ADB. 2006. Sindh Economic Report - Pakistan: Securing Sindh\u2019s Future -\nThe Prospects and Challenges Ahead. Islamabad (Report No. 35001, draft).  \n ", "  3\ncapita income in Sindh grew by only 0.9% annually, compared with 2.1% for Pakistan as a \nwhole. Second, slower growth pushed up Sindh\u2019s poverty headcount ratio from 23.4% to 35.3% \nbetween FY1996 and FY2002. While the poverty ratio has declined in recent years, over 20% of \nthe  population  still  lives  below  the  poverty  line.  Third,  Sindh\u2019s  population  is  becoming \ndisenchanted. Over 80% of Sindh residents perceived no improvement in their lives in recent \nyears.  Fourth,  without  increasing  investments  and  faster  growth,  Sindh  faces  a  serious \nunemployment problem. The State Bank of Pakistan7 estimated that the unemployment rate \nincreased  from  5.2%  in  FY2002  to  nearly  6.0%  in  FY2004.  Sindh\u2019s  population  has  been \nincreasing at a faster pace than that of Pakistan because of the large number of migrants. \nHaving a dynamic economy that generates income and employment is essential for ensuring \neconomic prosperity and maintaining social harmony.      \n \nFigure 1: Growth Rate of Provincial GDP \n(annual average percentage change [%]) \n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n1991/92 1993/94 1995/96 1997/98 1999/00 2001/02 2003/04\n-2\n-4\nSindh Pakistan  \nGDP = gross domestic product \nSource: World Bank estimates. \n \n10.  Stagnant Rural Economy. Rural Sindh has over 50% of the province\u2019s population and \nabout 30% of the provincial economy. More than 70% of rural residents derive their livelihood \nfrom agriculture, livestock, forestry, or fishing. This contrasts dramatically with urban Sindh, \nespecially Karachi,  where  about 95%  of  the  population  is  employed  in  manufacturing  and \nservices. While the manufacturing sector grew by about 6.4% from FY1992 to FY2005, the \ncomparable figure for agriculture was 3.5%. The slow growth of the rural economy has created \na large and widening income gap between urban and rural Sindh. The poverty headcount ratio \nof around 30% in rural areas is double that of urban areas. The large rural\u2013urban divide is a \nserious  concern  for  the  welfare  of  the  rural  population  and  is  potentially  destabilizing. \nAccelerating rural growth is urgently needed to lift the well-being of the rural poor and for the \nbenefit of overall economic growth and social cohesion.   \n  \n11.  Emerging Opportunities. A number of positive developments have emerged in recent \nyears. First, Sindh has led other provinces in poverty reduction since FY2001. Second, the \nannual population growth rate in Sindh has declined from 4% in the early 1980s to 2% in the \nlate 1990s and is expected to fall below 1.5% by 2010. The transformation in the composition of \nthe population away from \u201cvery young\u201d to \u201cyoung and mature\u201d is expected to lead to greater \nprivate  saving  and  less  pressure  on  public  finances.  Third,  there  has  been  a  general \n                                                 \n7  State Bank of Pakistan. 2005. Annual Report 2004/05.

These conditions provide a helpful setting for GoS \nto embark upon reform programs to put the economy on a firm and sustainable footing. \n \nB.  The Government of Sindh\u2019s Vision and Strategy and ADB's Strategy \n12.  The Vision. The draft Sindh Vision 20308 of GoS envisages by 2030 \u201ca united, just, \nresilient, productive, innovative, industrialized, and prosperous Sindh with a disciplined, caring \nsociety comprising of healthy, happy, and educated people.\u201d It further states that the realization \nof this vision requires \u201cenabling competitiveness in agriculture, business, and industry.\u201d To \nsupport the realization of the vision through concrete steps, GoS is in the process of updating its \nMedium  Term  Fiscal  Framework,  FY2009\u2013FY2011  and  preparing  a  medium  term  rural \ninvestment plan.        \n \n13.  The  Strategy.  Sindh\u2019s  recent  development  has  been  marred  by  social  and  ethnic \ndivisions that have periodically dampened growth. Consequent low growth and high inequality \nhave prevented social convergence. To break out of this vicious cycle, Sindh needs to embark \nupon an accelerated, inclusive, and sustainable development path. The basic development \nstrategy rests on the following aspects. \n \n14.  First, Sindh must not develop in isolated urban or rural pockets but must rather grow in a \ncohesive province-wide manner. Dynamic urban areas serve as powerful engines that pull the \nrural economy up with them, and urban Sindh's development is far from satisfactory. Second, \nattention must be paid to stimulating rural growth. Third, rural growth needs to be supported by \nstrong agricultural growth. However, growth in the agricultural sector alone will not be sufficient. \nStrengthening rural and urban linkages and diversifying the rural economy into off-farm activities \nare needed to generate income and reduce the risks related to fluctuations in agricultural output. \nFourth, attaining strong growth requires that the private sector play a critical role in generating \nwealth. Sindh\u2019s development expenditure budget per capita was less than $25 in FY2008. \nDramatically increasing public finance is not possible in the short term. It is critical that an \nenabling environment be created to attract private investment to build the province\u2019s social and \nphysical  infrastructure.  Fifth,  private  sector  development  will  not  completely  replace  public \ninvestment.  To  improve  development  impacts,  Sindh  needs  to  significantly  enhance  the \nefficiency of public expenditure.    \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s Strategy. The emphasis on promoting growth in general, and particularly rural \ngrowth, is in line with ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008-2020 (Strategy 2020),9 which \nstresses  that  poverty  reduction  can  be  sustained  only  if  more  people  are  economically \nproductive. Strategy 2020 identifies poverty and widening disparity in well-being within and \nbetween developing member countries as two of the central challenges facing the Asia and \nPacific region. The draft country program and strategy for Pakistan (2007\u20132011) emphasizes \nthe need to build up a resilient economy based on increased private sector participation and \nsupporting the balanced development of urban and rural economies. \n \n                                                 \n8  Planning and Development Department, Government of Sindh. 2007.

Essentially, the proposed SGARRP looks at the need in Sindh for \n \n(i)  the public sector doing less, but acting strategically to attract greater private sector \nparticipation; \n(ii)  the public sector doing things better, such as managing resources effectively and \nwith greater accountability; and  \n(iii)  revitalizing  rural  growth  in  a  strategic  manner  by  facilitating  the  unfettered \noperation of agricultural markets, among other reforms. \n \n1.  Need for More Private Sector Participation \n18.  Background. Sindh\u2019s private sector plays a very important role in Pakistan. In FY2005, \nits share of national large-scale manufacturing was 48.7%, mining and quarrying 66.6%, and \nfinance and administration 38.2%. Yet, the development of the private sector in Sindh faces a \nnumber of constraints.  \n \na.  Need to Reduce the Inefficiency of Public Enterprises  \n \n19.  The strong growth of an economy requires a sound demarcation of the respective roles \nof the private and public sectors. Early experience of heavy and direct public sector involvement \nin commerce created a bloated public sector and large budget deficits. Recognizing this, GoS \nhas divested itself of most of its commercial entities. However, it still operates a number of \npublic enterprises that are unable to cover their operating costs. Examples of such entities \ninclude the Sindh Small Industries Corporation, the Sindh Industrial Trading Estates, and the 71 \nagricultural  markets  currently  administered  by  government-appointed  officials.  There  is  an \nopportunity for GoS to reexamine its investment in and management of public corporations and \nto rid itself of the resulting fiscal drain by allowing the private sector to participate in their \nownership and administration, or by divesting them completely.  \n \nb.  Need to Create an Enabling Environment for Public\u2013Private \nPartnerships \n \n20.  Public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs)11  can  improve  the  availability  of  resources  and \nenhance the efficiency of public goods and service delivery. The implementation of PPP in \ninfrastructure and social services will be particularly beneficial for Sindh, as underinvestment \nover many decades has created bottlenecks that undermine economic growth and poverty \nreduction. To take advantage of the potential created by PPP, Sindh needs to put in place policy, \ninstitutional, financial, and risk-sharing mechanisms that it currently lacks.     \n \n21.  Projects need to be bankable before they can attract private sector investment. Even in \nstable political and macroeconomic environments, a project for public purpose may face serious \nviability gaps. Such risks may be mitigated by the public sector\u2019s sharing risks and providing \n                                                 \n11 PPPs are contractual arrangements between the public sector and a private sector party for the private delivery of \npublic services, in particular infrastructure services. They range across service contracts; management contracts; \nleases;  and  concessions  such  as  build-own-operate-transfer  contracts,  divestiture,  and  build-own-operate \ncontracts. They frequently involve complementary investments and/or services. Examples that are under provincial \njurisdiction include the private sector management and operation of water utilities and sanitation and waste \nmanagement facilities, private investments in urban transport that are complemented by upfront public investments \nthrough capital grants for large projects, and the implementation of a network of feeder roads or provision of land \nby the public sector to supplement a privately financed and operated toll road. At the federal level, the power and \ntransport sectors have major potential for PPP. ", "  7\nupfront viability gap funding. But the fiscal authority needs to carefully evaluate the costs and \nbenefits  to  properly  set  the  extent  of  public  investment  in,  or  support  for,  a  project.  The \nGovernment can consider initial capital grants or partial operational support if a stable revenue \nstream or significant benefits to the public can be demonstrated. Given acute capacity and \nfinancial constraints on the province, GoS needs to examine its role in projects for public \npurposes  and  the  potential  for  private  delivery  of  them.  Establishing  a  sound  policy  and \ninstitutional environment, allocating resources for project development, putting in place the \nviability gap fund (VGF) mechanism, and carrying out intensive capacity building for PPP are \nneeded in the province.  \n \n2.  Need for Better Public Expenditure Management \n22.  Like  any  large  province,  Sindh  has  its  share  of  major  issues  in  public  resource \nmanagement. The proposed SGARRP concentrates on two principal issues. The first is the \nneed for managing public funds well by investing them prudently and monitoring their utilization \neffectively. The second is the need for managing the province\u2019s contingent liabilities, specifically \npension and other employee benefits, prudently to create fiscal space and reduce fiscal risks.  \n \na.  Need for Efficient Public Investment Management \n \n23.  Background. Public investment in Sindh is implemented through ADPs. The Sindh ADP \nballooned from PRs5.7 billion in FY2003 to PRs54 billion in FY2008. The tenfold increase in \nresources has stretched implementation capacity and brought to the fore many systematic \nproblems in ADP management.   \n \n24.  Too Many Projects, Too Little Funding. The ADP for FY2009 contains about 1,890 \nprojects. Of these, 70% suffer serious delays in implementation. The recently completed Public \nFinancial Management and Accountability Assessment (PFMAA)12 of Sindh concluded that \nexpenditure  effectiveness  in  the  province  is  undermined  by  a  lack  of  realism  in  budget \npreparation.  During  planning,  departments  submit  a  list  of  projects  without  being  explicitly \ninformed of the resources available. While it is commonly understood that annual budgets rise \nincrementally, departments compile proposals without considering budgetary constraints. Little \nprioritization is undertaken, and many schemes are included in the ADP. As a result, available \nresources are thinly spread and implementation is delayed. In many cases, newly approved \nschemes receive only a symbolic or token allocation far below the initially estimated amount. \nThe large number of schemes in the ADP and relatively small allocation per scheme builds up \nthrow forward in the development portfolio, stretches the implementing capacity of departments, \nand  results  in  under  spending  of  budget  allocations.  The  consequent  two  seemingly \ncontradictory  phenomena\u2014throw  forward  and  under  spending\u2014seriously  undermine  the \nbenefits of public investment.     \n \n25.  Bypassing Procedures. Regular procedures are bypassed in response to pressure to \nensure that projects continue to be funded, irrespective of resource availability or prioritization. It \nis a common practice to include unapproved new schemes in the ADP. Worse, the unapproved \nschemes are sometimes carried forward as ongoing schemes from one ADP to the next. In \nother words, the ADP contains schemes that have never been sanctioned by a competent \nauthority, never undertaken before, and perhaps never evaluated on the basis of their feasibility \nor viability.      \n                                                 \n12 Government  of  Sindh  and  development  partners.  2008.  Public  Financial  Management  and  Accountability \nAssessment. Sindh (March). A summary of the assessment is provided in Appendix 3.  \n ", " 8 \n26.  Weak  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  The  Directorate  General  of  Monitoring  and \nEvaluation in P&DD is responsible for monitoring development schemes. Review of the ADP \nportfolio can result in the issuance of reprimands to those departments with nonperforming \nschemes, but corrective measures are not undertaken and bad performance is not taken into \naccount  when  deciding  the  next  year\u2019s  budgetary  allocations.  The  Directorate  General  of \nMonitoring and Evaluation is currently understaffed, with only five officials assigned to the task \nof monitoring the entire ADP portfolio of 976 ongoing projects, 723 new projects, and about 200 \nspecial projects. There is thus minimal monitoring of development project execution. It is not \nclear that merely increasing the number of staff would be sufficient to strengthen monitoring. \nMore fundamental action may be required, including a disciplined approach to restructuring or \nthe termination of nonperforming projects. \n \n27.  Weak External Auditing and Internal Control Mechanisms. The Office of the Auditor \nGeneral of Sindh conducts fairly regular external audits of all GoS spending units. The audit \nreports  contain  many  audit  observations  (commonly  referred  to  as  \u2018paras\u2019  in  Pakistan) \naddressed to the departments, which remain unsettled due to lack of discipline in holding \nregular departmental accounts committee (DAC) meetings, which act as a prelude to eventual \nsettlement by the provincial accounts committee. In many cases, DACs are systematically \nneglected. In some departments, the backlog is as long as 5 years. The internal control process \nsuffers from a lack of control mechanisms, institutions, and practices. One major issue is the \npoor  system  of  managing  movable  assets.  Inventory  controls  on  movable  assets  in  all \ndepartments are not carried out, potentially allowing losses to the exchequer. The standard \noperating  procedures  for  asset  disposal  are  archaic,  involving  numerous  approvals. \nDepartments are supposed to record any asset worth PRs100,000 or more in a dead stock \nregister and establish a maintenance record, but the practice is seldom followed.   \n \nb.  Need for Better Employee Benefit Management \n \n28.  Background. GoS is the largest employer in the province, with more than 421,000 \nemployees. It pays monthly pensions to an estimated 108,000 pensioners and their surviving \ndependants. It provides to its civil servants a two-layered old-age protection system consisting \nof a pension scheme with an unfunded defined benefit and a general provident fund (GPF) with \na notional defined contribution. GoS provides additional employee benefits: a benevolent fund to \nhelp  defray  the  costs  of  life  events;  group  life  insurance  provided  through  the  State  Life \nInsurance Company; an additional in-service death benefit paid from a self-funded pool; and \nhealth care coverage and leave salary in case of sickness. Establishing an efficient system for \nmanaging employee benefits is essential for creating fiscal space, reducing contingent liability, \nand improving public sector employee welfare. \n \n29.  Growing Liabilities of Employee Benefits. Employee benefits are paid from the GoS \nbudget on a pay-as-you-go basis. Life insurance death benefits are paid from the State Life \nInsurance Company as the underwriter of the policies. Expenditures for employee benefits are \ngrowing rapidly. Pensions grew by 13.0% from FY2007 to FY2008, reaching PRs7.54 billion.13 \nExpenditures for GPF are expected to exceed PRs2 billion in FY2008, while expenditures for \nthe benevolent fund and group insurance approach PRs500 million each. \n \n30.  In  recognition  of  the  need  to  better  manage  its  growing  benefit  liabilities,  GoS \nestablished the Sindh Pension Fund (SPF) in August 2002 with seed money of PRs1.2 billion \nsupplemented by an annual government allocation of PRs3 billion. The current value of the SPF \n                                                 \n13 Finance Department, Government of Sindh. 2008. Brief about Sindh Pension Investment Fund. Sindh. ", "  9\nstands  at  PRs12.888  billion.  Simultaneously,  annual  expenditure  from  the  GoS  budget  for \npensions has increased to PRs6.782 billion.14 In May 2007, GoS approved the creation of the \nSindh General Provident Investment Fund (SGPIF) and transferred seed money of PRs2 billion \nfrom the FY2008 budget. The SGPIF will be supplemented annually by a budget transfer of \nPRs2 billion and the net receipts of GPF contributions from civil servants.15 GoS\u2019s intention is to \ncontinue budget transfers to overcome GPF liabilities in the next 10\u201315 years. The management \nof  the  funds  and  investment  decisions  are  undertaken  by  a  high-powered  committee  that \nincludes the chief secretary, secretary general of administration, and secretary of finance. The \nprivate sector has just one representative on the SGPIF board.  \n \n31.  Lack of Accuracy and Timeliness in Record Keeping, Administration, and Service \nDelivery. The process of record keeping, benefit calculation, and benefit payment is still largely \nmanual and on paper but is being replaced by an automated system under the Project for \nImprovement in Financial Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA)16 using SAP/R3 software (named for \n\u201cstandard  accounting  procedures\u201d).  Currently,  neither  the  Finance  Department  nor  the \nAccountant General of Sindh (AGS) can utilize the pension and GPF modules because of the \nbacklog in transferring pension information and wage history data from paper records to an \nonline format. This information gathering is time-consuming, adding burden to the daily tasks of \nAGS clerks.  \n \n32.  The present process of GPF payment is onerous, requiring the claimant to go through a \nlengthy process to generate a pension payment order that needs to be cleared by the claimant\u2019s \nfinal employing department and approved by the district accounts office. Leakage in the system \nin the form of \u201cghost\u201d employees and pensioners is believed to be significant. Another weakness \nin the disbursement of pension and GPF benefits occurs when the retirement benefits are \nactually being paid out. The benefits are paid through the local branches of the National Bank of \nPakistan. Fraud is countered by requiring the beneficiary to appear in person, though in practice \nthis is not required on a monthly basis. Further procedures require that a local district official \nmake a life certification of a pensioner, but this too is not routinely enforced, resulting in \nfraudulent benefit claims continued past death. Moreover, there is no mechanism for triggering \nan action when questionable transactions occur. The identification of claims for the employee \nbenefits  can  be  considerably  improved.  The  claim  process,  managed  by  the  drawing  and \ndisbursement  officer  for  each  department,  is  flawed  by  administrative  inefficiencies  and \nmalpractices.   \n \n33.  Weak Employee Benefit Structure. The Federal and provincial governments share \nvirtually the same federally designed pension and GPF benefits. Certain features of the current \npension scheme have led to inequitable and arbitrary outcomes. For instance, the employee\u2019s \nfinal monthly payroll is used as the basis for calculating the pension. This creates an incentive \nfor employees to secure a pay raise or promotion immediately before retirement. Most of the \nworkers who joined the government after 2004 are not entitled to pensions or GPF benefits \nbecause of the contractual nature of employment. Concerns have been expressed that the \ncurrent policy restricts GoS\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified staff and that morale is \ndamaged as employees with different benefits work side by side. There is a lot of dissatisfaction. \nGoS, as the employer, is dissatisfied over escalating costs. Employees are dissatisfied with the \nclaims process and inadequate payment amounts. Furthermore, there is a considerable overlap \n                                                 \n14 Shaikh, Khalid Mehmood. 2008. Pension Privatization in Pakistan. Sindh.

Streamlining \nthese programs is highly desirable.   \n \n3.  Need to Revitalize the Rural Economy \n34.  About 50% of the province\u2019s population resides in rural areas, and about 30%, or 5.5 \nmillion people, live below the official poverty line. More than 70% of rural residents derive their \nlivelihood from agriculture. However, over the period from FY1999 to FY2005, the growth rate of \nagricultural added value was only 2.3% per year and, in per capita terms, only 0.2% per year. \nThe landless ratio in Sindh is 62%, the highest among Pakistan\u2019s four provinces, making off-\nfarm income important. A number of impediments to rural growth are discussed below.     \n \n35.  Neglect of Rural Investments. Historically, ADPs have neglected rural areas in favor of \ninvestment in urban areas. There is a need to translate the redefined provincial priority into a \nrural investment plan that addresses critical constraints in the rural economy. Infusing a medium \nterm perspective by carrying out multiple year (e.g., 3-year) forward planning and ensuring that \nrural investment plans are integrated into the provincial Medium Term Fiscal Framework will \ncontribute to sustained rural development.  \n \n36.  Need for a Computerized Land Titling and Record-Keeping System. Land markets \nin Sindh are thin, with less than 0.5% of land sold or bought each year. One key impediment to \ncreating a flexible land market is the ambiguity of the agrarian law regarding title to land. The \nentries on the land and revenue records provide only presumptive status of rights, and these \nrights have been challenged in various courts.17 Furthermore, there are serious defects in the \nBoard of Revenue (BOR) system of preparing, maintaining, and updating land records. An \narchaic, paper-based regime for maintaining land records, which disproportionately empowers \nthe tapedar (the lowest-level revenue functionary) to maintain exclusive custody of the land \nrecord, lends itself to making fraudulent entries accompanied by bribes, further putting into \ndispute an already presumptive title. Such insecurity in land titling acts as a disincentive to \ninvestment and land transactions. The low frequency of land transactions perpetuates the highly \nunequal distribution of land. The lack of clear land title also impedes access to credit, as banks \nare reluctant to lend money using land as collateral because they do not trust the current \nrecording system.  \n \n37.  Poorly Functioning Agricultural Markets. An important piece of legislation in Sindh \nthat affects farmers is the Agricultural Produce Markets Act (1939) (Supplementary Appendix A), \nwhich restricts wholesale transactions for agricultural commodities such as fruit and vegetables \nto regulated markets run exclusively by government-appointed registered commission agents. \nThis system favors intermediaries, locally referred to as arhti, at the expense of farmers. Under \nSection 4 (2) of the legislation, a license is required from the provincial government to establish \na market within a notified area, which is to be managed by a market committee that issues \nlicenses to dealers and brokers to operate in the market and allots shops in the market. The \ncommittee has monopolistic power and control over the bulk and wholesale purchase process \nand sale of farmer produce in the area. This monopolistic role played by the Government and its \ndirect  engagement  in  the  operations  of  the  markets  have  made  the  governing  body  less \naccountable and increased the possibility of collusion between intermediaries and management, \nto the disadvantage of farmers, especially small and marginal ones. There is evidence that rent \n                                                 \n17 World Bank and ADB. 2006.

", "  11\nseeking and corruption are common in the collection of market fees, issuance of trader licenses, \nand allotment of shops.18 There are currently 71 markets in Sindh, yet only six are operated by \ncommittees,  with  the  remainder  administered  by  Agriculture  Department  officials.  The \nappointment of a government official to administer a market further weakens the accountability \nand administrative oversight of the market.   \n \n38.  Lack and Poor Quality of Social Service Delivery. Social service delivery in Sindh is \ntainted by high absenteeism and the low quality of service delivery. Progress in social indicators \nhas been slow. In recent years, several large nongovernment organization (NGO) programs \nsupported by the federal and provincial governments and international donors have undertaken \nrural development efforts. In Sindh, the most notable of these are the National Rural Support \nProgram, Sindh Rural Support Organization (SRSO), Sindh Agricultural and Forestry Workers \nCoordinating  Organization  (SAFWCO),  and  Thardeep  Rural  Development  Program.  These \nprograms have achieved substantial success in organizing rural communities,19 building local \ninfrastructure,  and  delivering  services.  The  People\u2019s  Primary  Health  Initiative  (PPHI)  has \nachieved  through  enhanced  accountability  and  incentives  for  service  providers  significant \nimprovement  in  primary  health  service  in  10  districts  of  Sindh.  The  vertical  nature  of  the \nprogram has, however, raised questions about its sustainability. This has been a common \nproblem with other rural support organizations. Attention needs to be paid to ensuring that \nalternative models of service delivery by NGOs are financially viable, have sound governance \nstructures, and are sustainable.   \n \nD.  External Assistance \n39.  ADB has supported GoS in governance reforms and infrastructure improvements. ADB\u2019s \nfirst program loan to Sindh was through the Sindh Devolved Social Services Program (SDSSP). \nIt was implemented between 2002 and 2008 and was part of a concerted effort by ADB to \nsupport improved social services from local governments. SDSSP was the first such provincial \nprogram, and its design has served as a blueprint for Devolved Social Services Programs in \nPunjab and Balochistan. The SDSSP aims to improve local government capacity and improve \nservice delivery in health, education, and water supply and sanitation. As SDSSP drew to a \nclose,  GoS  expressed  a  desire  to  implement  a  two-pronged  strategy  to  engage  with \ndevelopment  partners  on  policy-based  lending  to  (i)  deepen  social  sector  reforms  through \nimplementing single sector programs and (ii) tackle institutional and policy impediments to \ngrowth and revitalize the rural economy. The SGARRP is a response to the governments\u2019 \nsecond desired strategy. Building on the SDSSP, the SGARRP pays particular attention to \nintroducing PPPs for better service delivery. GoS has also requested ADB to explore the \nprospects for designing a Millennium Development Goal program, of the type that has been \npursued in the Punjab, with the objective of reducing infant and maternal mortality. \n \n                                                 \n18 See, for example, Sustainable and Development Unit, South Asia Region, World Bank. 2007.

A subproject entitled Supporting Fiscal and Public Financial Management Reforms in \nSindh  was  approved  by  the  TA  cluster  steering  committee  in  December  2007.  This  TA \nsubproject has provided domestic and international expertise to help GoS improve its public \nfinancial management. Efforts have been made to coordinate the work under this TA and the \nSGARRP,  with  TA  findings  reflected  in  program  design.  This  complementary  relationship \nbetween the TA and the SGARRP will continue into the design and implementation phases of \nsubprogram 2 of the SGARRP.      \n \n41.  ADB has processed the Sindh Cities Improvement Program to improve water supply and \nwaste water and solid waste management services in clusters of secondary cities through an \nintegrated program of institutional reforms and priority investments, with focus on improving \nservice delivery. The processing of the Karachi Urban Transport Program (tentative title) is also \nunderway. This will help improve the quality of life for urban residents including the poor. Thus \nSGARRP, the Sindh Cities Improvement Investment Program, and the Karachi Urban Transport \nProgram are complementary in reform and investment areas, as well as address the urban-rural \nimbalances.  \n \n42.  The World Bank is an active development partner in Sindh. It is introducing reforms in \nirrigation through its Sindh Water Sector Improvement Project (2007\u20132013).21 This project aims \nto expand community involvement in the management and maintenance of distal irrigation \ninfrastructure to improve efficiencies in three major canal command areas. Similarly, the World \nBank\u2019s  On-Farm  Water  Management  Project  (2004\u20132008)22  supports  improvements  in  the \nefficiency  and  equity  of  irrigation  water  distribution  by  strengthening  the  role  of  farmers\u2019 \norganizations and supporting complementary technologies in land levelling, tillage, sprinkler and \ndrip systems, and integrated pest management.   \n \n43.  There has been substantial donor interest in the social sectors, with education and \nhealth  in  particular  receiving  considerable  attention.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  Education  Sector \nDevelopment Policy Credit aims to improve participation and retention, reduce gender and \nregional disparities, and improve quality in elementary and secondary education. Its first phase \nwas  implemented  in  2007  and  2008  at  a  cost  of  $100  million.  The  European  Union  is \ncomplementing the World Bank program through TA (2007\u20132011) directed toward improved \ndistrict  management  for  better  educational  outcomes.  ADB  supported  SDSSP  focused  on \nintroducing a well-regarded conditional grant mechanism to increase the quality and quantity of \nhealth, education and sanitation services at the local government levels.    \n \n44.  An important World Bank initiative in the area of public financial management is the \nPIFRA. The first phase of the PIFRA was implemented between 1996 and 2005. The second \nphase started in October 2005 and will be completed in 2010. The PIFRA encompasses federal, \nprovincial, and district government actions aiming to improve the accuracy, comprehensiveness, \nreliability, and timeliness of accounting, auditing, and reporting. Improving pension and wage \nrecords is an important component of the PIFRA. ADB and World Bank assistance are fully \ncomplementary. In public financial management, for example, the World Bank\u2018s PIFRA focuses \n                                                 \n20 ADB. 2007.

In \npension reform, the PIFRA has worked to improve records, while ADB has worked to improve \npension administration, service delivery, and policy. \n \n45.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  is  another  major \ndonor. Through its $47 million project, Widening Harmonized Access to Microfinance, USAID \nhas  supported  microfinance  loans  and  is  providing  training  and  technology  support  to  the \nconduit banks, enabling them to cater better to the needs of Sindh\u2019s micro, small, and medium-\nsized enterprises. USAID has helped establish a competitiveness support fund to accelerate the \nadoption of practices that enhance competitiveness and will spur economic growth and poverty \nalleviation  in  Pakistan.  In  Sindh,  this  fund  developed  an  action  plan  for  rehabilitating  and \nimproving the management of the Karachi Fish Harbor and provided $8 million for implementing \nthe  plan,  with  GoS  funding  another  $2  million.  More  information  on  donor  coordination  is \nincluded in the development coordination matrix (Appendix 4).    \n \nE.  Lessons \n46.  The experience of ADB in policy-based lending over the past decades offers useful \nexamples  of  how  to  improve  program  design  and  implementation.  Key  lessons  that  have \nemerged are outlined below.   \n \n47.  Strong Government Ownership. A prerequisite for successful program implementation \nis strong ownership by the government. This encompasses ownership by both the bureaucracy \nand political leaders. Thus, active dialogue with both the bureaucracy and political leaders is \nimportant for the success of a program. Because reform programs are long term, identifying \nreform areas that cut across political differences and have wide support is critical.  \n \n48.  Policy Conditions Should Be Flexible. Changing circumstances will require policy \nadjustments during implementation. Policy conditions should be geared to respond to evolving \ncircumstances and structured around open and informed debate to nurture desired changes.   \n \n49.  Realistic Program Design. Program designs that are too complex are likely to fail. This \nlesson is highlighted by ADB\u2019s country assistance program evaluation for Pakistan (2007).23 \nIdentifying feasible and significant actions toward reform goals is essential. This suggests an \nincremental, evolutionary, and sustainable approach to reform. \n \n50.  Institutional Development. The success of a program depends on its ability to nurture \ninstitutional  development.  Building  capacity  in  executing  and  implementing  agencies  is \nimportant for both program implementation and the sustainability of reforms. TA can play an \nimportant role in this regard.   \n \n51.  The country assistance program evaluation for Pakistan (2007) of ADB identified lessons \nspecific to Pakistan that are broadly consistent with these lessons. Overly complex design, lack \nof  government  ownership,  and  rigid  implementation  mechanisms  are  cited  as  reasons  for \nproject failure. The ADB\u2019s Evaluation on Policy-Based Lending (2007)24 outlines a number of \nstrategies for enhancing program lending. These include (i) making available enough staff to \n                                                 \n23 Operations Evaluation Department, ADB. 2007.

Manila. \n ", " 14 \ndesign  strategies  and  programs  and  effectively  engage  in  policy  dialogue;  (ii)  conducting \nrigorous analytical work;25 (iii) willingness to innovate (with tolerance for a higher degree of risk \nthat is still within acceptable bounds to accommodate this) in ways that take into account \npolitical economy factors and incentive structures; (iv) balancing lending; (v) economic, sector, \nand thematic work and continuous policy dialogue; and (vi) ensuring that judicious use is made \nof conditions to help reformers manage the process but not to control it. \n \n52.  Experiences  in  implementing  program  loans  such  as  the  Financial  Markets  and \nGovernance Program; Pakistan Access to Justice Program; Pakistan Decentralization Support \nProgram; Small and Medium Enterprise Development Program; Provincial Public Resource \nManagement Program in Punjab and Baluchistan; and provincial Devolved Social Services \nPrograms in Sindh, Punjab, and Balochistan; Second Generation Capital Market Program; \nPrivate Participation in Infrastructure Program; Agriculture Sector Programs; and Accelerating \nEconomic Transformation Program are all generally consistent with the lessons outlined above. \nThese programs highlight two specific lessons in addition to those mentioned above. First, \nincluding large TA loans in programs has generally not worked because of low utilization and \nthe ad hoc nature of the outputs produced. Many factors have led to this result, including the \nlack of ownership by, and implementation capacity of, the government; excessive pre-auditing \nand the rigidities of ADB rules and procedures; the lack of systematic identification and a \nparticipatory approach to TA activities; and the lack of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of \noutputs. Second, just having a centralized program implementation unit, without an adequate \nmechanism  to  secure  line  department  ownership,  can  weaken  the  participation  of  line \ndepartments.   \n \n53.  The proposed SGARRP incorporates these general and country-specific lessons. In \nparticular,  it  adopts  a  single-tranche,  program  cluster  approach  to  provide  a  platform  for \ndeveloping a long-term partnership between ADB and GoS. The areas in the SGARRP have \nbeen selected after carefully assessing institutional capacity and commitment to reforms in each \ncase. The design of the program was significantly changed in response to GoS\u2019s strong request \nfor ADB assistance in the areas finally included. Spurred by its strong ownership, GoS is \nstrengthening provincial capacity to implement the actions. The Finance Department expressed \na  strong  desire  to  improve  pension  and  other  employee  benefit  systems.  Basic  fund-\nmanagement capacity has been established in the department, and GoS is in the process of \nestablishing  a  professional  fund  management  house  (FMH).  BOR  has  initiated  work  on \nimproving land titles and records. A project management unit will be set up and the budgets \nallocated  for  three  Planning  Commission  pro-forma  applications, 26   specifically  for \ncomputerization of land records, preservation of old land records, and geographic information \nsystem, have been approved. Drawing on past lessons, the SGARRP will include subprogram \nmanagement units in key implementing agencies (IAs) and focal persons in other IAs.  \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED SINDH GROWTH AND RURAL REVITALIZATION PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n54.  The proposed SGARRP aims to promote broad-based growth across the province and \nspur growth in the depressed rural economy. The impacts of the SGARRP will be higher and \nsustained economic growth, reduced poverty, and lower rural\u2013urban inequality in Sindh. The \n                                                 \n25 The World Bank and ADB\u2019s Sindh Economic Report - Pakistan: Securing Sindh\u2019s Future-The Prospects and \nChallenges Ahead. Islamabad (Report no. 35001) (draft, 2006) has provided much analytical backing for the \ndesign of the SGARRP. \n26 This refers to project proposals. ", "  15\noutcomes of the SGARRP include greater private sector participation across the economy, more \nefficient  public  expenditure  management,  and  increased  investment  and  improved  service \ndelivery in rural areas.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n55.  The SGARRP supports policy actions in three core policy areas (CPAs): \n \n(i)  CPA  1:  Promote  private  sector  participation  by  (a)  promoting  PPPs  in \ninfrastructure and social service provision, and (b) reducing the government\u2019s \ndirect involvement in commercial activities.   \n \n(ii)  CPA  2:  Strengthen  public  expenditure  management  by  improving  the \n(a) efficiency  of  public  investment;  (b)  M&E;  (c)  audit  compliance,  legislative \noversight,  and  internal  control;  and  (d)  policy,  financing,  administration,  and \ndelivery of employee benefits. \n \n(iii)  CPA 3: Revitalize the rural economy by (a) increasing and sustaining rural \ninvestments, (b) creating an enabling investment environment in rural areas by \nclarifying land titling and reducing market distortions and barriers to entry, and \n(c) facilitating PPP in rural service delivery and empowerment. \n \n56.  The SGARRP will undertake a combination of actions in the short term (1\u20132 years), \nmedium term (3\u20134 years), and long term (4\u20135 years) period. Accordingly, it is designed as a \ncluster with three subprograms. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The \ndevelopment policy letter is in Appendix 5. The policy matrix is in Appendix 6. An action plan for \nachieving subprogram 1 actions is in Supplementary Appendix B. The program structure of the \nSGARRP is presented in Figure 3, and the reform actions under each CPA are described below. \nSection C below summarizes the areas where substantial progress has been made as part of \nsubprogram 1 of SGARRP. \n \n ", " 16 \nFigure 3.

Core Policy Area 1: Promote Private Sector Participation  \na.  Promote Public\u2013Private Partnerships \n57.  The  objective  of  this  subcomponent  is  to  enhance  the  role  of  PPP  in  augmenting \nresources,  improving  efficiency,  and  mitigating  risks.  Subprogram  1  will  support  the \nimplementation of key steps towards introducing PPP policy, institutional, regulatory, financial, \nand concession-management frameworks in Sindh. It includes the preparation of a concept \npaper outlining a key steps for the province to develop comprehensive PPP frameworks. The \nPPP Unit, housed in the Finance Department, will have the mandate to develop PPP policies \nand support project development. The PPP Unit has drafted a PPP guidance document that is \nbeing discussed with line departments and agencies. It will be strengthened further with ADB TA \nsupport, resulting in two key documents: a PPP policy and regulatory framework and detailed \nimplementation guidelines. The PPP Unit will ensure that PPP projects in the province are \nundertaken through open, transparent, and competitive procurement procedures and clearly \ndefined concession agreements.  \n ", "  17\n58.  During subprogram 2, the PPP policy and regulatory framework will be adopted and a \nproject development fund and a VGF will be established to prepare PPP projects and provide \ntargeted  and  properly  budgeted  capital  grants  and  subsidies  for  PPP  projects  that  are \neconomically and socially justified but fall short of financial viability. At least two PPP projects \nwill  be  launched  through  competitive  bidding  and  governed  by  clearly  defined  concession \nagreements between GoS and private sector participants. The implementation of PPP projects \nwill offer valuable experiences through learning by doing and regulating through well-defined \ncontracts, and will facilitate policy development. Drawing on the experience of countries such as \nSingapore and Canada, the PPP Unit will analyze the applicability of establishing rules that \nrequire public investment exceeding a certain threshold to use PPP modalities. In subprogram 3, \nGoS will commission an independent review of PPP projects to date to assess their commercial \nrigor and the appropriateness of the risk-sharing arrangements. The lessons drawn from it will \nserve as inputs for designing further reforms.  \n \nb.  Improve the Efficiency of Public Sector Enterprises \n59.  The  objective  of  this  component  is  to  improve  efficiency  and  reduce  fiscal  losses \nstemming from government ownership of commercial entities. Under subprogram 1, the Finance \nDepartment  will  carry  out  a  stocktaking  exercise  to  ascertain  the  number  of  public  sector \ncorporations and gather information on their financial performance. The data and analysis will \nserve as an important instrument for monitoring public sector enterprise (PSE) performance. \nOne weak area identified by the PFMAA is inadequate oversight of PSEs by GoS. It is difficult \neven to gauge the number of PSEs in the province (Appendix 3). GoS will identify options to \nprivatize or introduce private management to a number of public sector corporations, including \nthe  Sindh  Small  Industries  Corporation,  Sindh  Industrial  Trading  Estates,  Sindh  Seed \nCorporation, and Sindh agricultural market committees. These entities have been shielded from \nmarket discipline and suffer ongoing losses. They are inefficient and crowd out or prohibit \nprivate sector entry. GoS will develop detailed divestment or contract management plans for \nthese  corporations  that  will  be  implemented  in  subprogram  2.  The  plans  will  incorporate \nmeasures to address adjustment costs, particularly the welfare issues faced by workers.     \n \n2.  Core Policy Area 2: Improve Public Expenditure Management  \na.  Improve the Efficiency of Pubic Investment \n60.  The objective of this subcomponent is to improve the quality and value for money of \npublic investment. One major factor that has caused the accumulation of projects and throw \nforward is the lack of budget discipline. An important requirement for making the budget process \nmore rigorous is to clearly convey the budget constraints of each department at the outset of \neach budget and planning year. This will help to improve transparency and predictability in ADP \nmanagement and subject planning agencies to hard budget constraints. Under subprogram 1, \nGoS will form a budget ceiling committee, which will determine the funding limit of the ADP for \neach department to be introduced in the next budget cycle. To reduce the excessive number of \ndevelopment projects, P&DD will advise departments that projects will be considered only within \nthe allocated budget limit. This will ensure that departments undertake expenditure prioritization.  \n \n61.  Another factor which has caused the excessive number of projects is token allocation. \nUnder subprogram 1, P&DD will cancel all projects that have received token allocations for 2 \nconsecutive years and institutionalize this discipline. Any such projects that departments still \nwish  to  pursue  will  need  to  be  resubmitted.  Other  measures  to  be  introduced  include \ndiscontinuing the practice of carrying forward the previous years' unapproved schemes into the \n ", " 18 \nnew ADP. These measures will reduce project overhang and the accumulation of projects. \nSubprogram 2 will support the introduction of budgeting based on medium term development \nplanning and performance.   \n \n62.  The M&E capacity of P&DD will be strengthened by adopting a computerized, results-\nbased M&E framework. Project M&E system software has been developed by the federal P&DD \nwith  support  from  ADB  TA.27  The  planning  commission  pro-forma  approval  template  was \nmodified in 2006 to include performance indicators used by the Government of Pakistan, and \nSindh has adopted this new template. The introduction of the computer-based project M&E \nsystem can effectively support the implementation of the new planning commission pro-forma \napproval requirement. In subprograms 2 and 3, an integrated database and system linking \nP&DD  with  line  departments  will  be  put  in  place  to  allow  regular  tracking  of  portfolio \nperformance. To identify systematic blockages to timely project implementation, P&DD will carry \nout in subprogram 1 a thorough study of five projects that suffered delays and, in subprogram 2, \ntake measures to address the causes. To improve accountability, P&DD will carry out third party \nevaluations for about 20 randomly-selected projects and institutionalize third party evaluation in \nsubprogram 2.  \n \n63.  To  ensure  the  prudent  use  of  public  resources  and  accountability,  a  schedule  for \nconvening  regular  DAC  meetings  will  be  observed  in  subprogram  1  by  selected  line \ndepartments, including Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries, Irrigation and Power, and Works \nand Services. The purpose of regular DAC meetings is to ensure progressive reduction in the \nbacklog of audit observations. To enhance internal control, a management system for movable \nassets will be established in subprogram 2 to safeguard public assets and reduce leakage. \n \nb.  Improve Employee Benefit Management \n64.  The  objective  of  the  proposed  intervention  is  to  improve  the  policy  framework  and \nadministration  of  pensions  and  other  employee  benefits  to  increase  fiscal  space,  reduce \ncontingent liability, and provide adequate income security for the civil service.   \n \ni.  Improve Financing of Employee Benefit Liabilities \n65.  This subcomponent will support the establishment of professionally managed investment \nfunds to finance pension and GPF liabilities. GoS has committed to the annual transfer of PRs3 \nbillion to the SPF and PRs2 billion to the SGPIF to address the growing contingent liability for \npensions  and  the  GPF.  The  funds  are  currently  managed  by  separate  boards,  with  the \ninvestment function based in the Finance Department. GoS is preparing to establish FMH, \nthrough which the SPF and the SGPIF will be managed in a professional manner by a single \nSindh Fund Management Board and an investment committee with expert advice from the \nprivate sector. During subprogram 1, the Finance Department will review the adequacy of \ninvestment  policy,  structure,  and  governance;  and  explore  possible  improvements  toward \nconformity  with  international  best  practice.  Based  on  the  options  identified,  the  Finance \nDepartment will prepare an action plan with milestones for establishing FMH. \n \n66.  Subprogram 2 will support the establishment of FMH. The design of arrangements for \nasset custody, investment management, and  governance oversight will require review and \n                                                 \n27 ADB. 2002.

The conformity of the investment policy to \ninternational best practice will combine securing opportunities for competitive investment returns \nwith maintaining an acceptable level of risk. FMH will be fully operational under subprogram 3. \n \nii.  Improve Record Keeping, Administration, and Delivery of \nEmployee Benefits \n67.  The aim of this subcomponent is to provide accurate and timely benefit payments to \npensioners and improve benefit delivery. A reliable record-keeping system in AGS is required, \nas well as a streamlined process for benefit calculation and processing. A major improvement in \nrecord keeping is expected to occur with the transition from a paper-based system to an \nautomated one using the SAP/R3 software for registering payroll, pension, and GPF data. \nVirtually all district account offices in Sindh now use the SAP/R3 payroll module.28 In January \n2008, AGS initiated a pilot to have the Karachi district account office enter the data of around \n100,000  employees  and  50,000  pensioners.  By  31  August  2008,  the  records  of  24,000 \npensioners and the wage history records, as registered in the ledgers, of more than 156,000 \nemployees had been entered into the system. Under subprogram 1, GoS created the Employee \nBenefit Administration Task Force to monitor the data collection and entry process, as well as \nthe reconciliation and accuracy verification of the data.  \n \n68.  Under subprogram 2, the Finance Department will look into options to create a Sindh \nprovincial government employee benefit house. The department intends to set up employee \nbenefit house to improve service delivery, enhance government employees' understanding of \ntheir  benefit  entitlements,  and  simplify  the  claim  process.  Under  subprograms  2  and  3, \nalternative designs and cost estimates for employee benefit house will be prepared before the \nmost appropriate design is selected and implemented. Under subprogram 2, claim procedures \nand business processes will be revised in line with the automated system, discontinuing reliance \non manual wage history reviews and approvals. Improvements in this area will allow GoS to \nreduce  the  time  needed  for  processing  claims  and  diminish  the  discretion  of  the  different \nauthorizing offices while, in the process, addressing rent seeking and other leakage. The full \ntransformation of the process can be initiated only once all line departments are linked to the \nSAP/R3  system  and  business  processes  are  adjusted  to  the  automated  system.  Under \nsubprogram 3, revisions to the claim, payment, and business processes will be implemented as \nline departments become automated.  \n \niii.  Improve Pension and Employee Benefit Policy \n \n69.  The aim of this subcomponent is to support GoS\u2019s review of reform options for the \nsystem  of  pensions  and  other  employee  benefits.  The  system  is  outdated  and  needs \ncomprehensive revision. Pension and employee benefit reform is part of a broader effort to \nrationalize public sector compensation. The actuarial valuation of these costs is a key element \nin the debate. The Office of the Chief Actuary in the Ministry of Finance of Pakistan is mandated \nto measure the accrued liabilities of civil service pension schemes, both for pension and GPF \nbenefits, and to advise on any proposed changes to them. Under subprogram 2, an actuarial \ncell will be created in the Finance Department to facilitate interaction with the federal actuarial \noffice, monitor the quality of the data, and carry out modeling of the pension and GPF reforms. \nUnder subprogram 2, the Finance Department will undertake a diagnostic study of existing \nemployee benefits to prepare recommendations for reform toward an integrated system of \n                                                 \n28 Out of 23 district offices, 22 use the payroll module. Out of those 22 district offices, most make payroll payments using the \nmodule. Not one utilizing office uses it at a rate of less than 70%, but five offices still have not yet passed the 90% mark.   \n ", " 20 \nemployee benefits. Based on the review, reform options will be proposed and discussed. Under \nsubprogram 3, the Finance Department will present the proposed systematic employee benefit \nreforms to the Provincial Assembly for those issues that fall under the provincial ambit and to \nthe federal Government for reform areas that are under its jurisdiction. \n \n3.  Core Policy Area 3: Revitalize the Rural Economy \na.  Institutionalize GoS Commitment to Rural Revitalization \n70.  The chief minister announced various interventions to address rural economic priorities \nin his budget speech to the Provincial Assembly on 16 June 2008. To spearhead rural reforms, \nGoS will establish under subprogram 1 an executive committee chaired by the chief secretary to \ndefine and guide the rural revitalization program. The committee will comprise key departmental \nsecretaries  and  nongovernmental  representatives  involved  in  rural  development  and  meet \nperiodically to review the progress of the rural revitalization program. The committee may, from \ntime to time, convene working groups of officials and experts on a particular sector or aspect to \nadvise the committee or perform specified tasks as required.  \n \nb.  Increase and Sustain Rural Investments \n71.  The renewed emphasis of GoS on revitalizing the rural economy has seen it commit to \ndeveloping under subprogram 1 a draft rural investment plan that will lay out government \npriorities for rural investment. The plan will be approved by the executive committee. Under \nsubprogram 2 the rural investment plan will be converted into a medium-term rural development \nframework, to be embedded in the province\u2019s Medium Term Fiscal Framework, and the ADP will \nbe  implemented  in  line  with  the  redevelopment  framework  and  the  Medium  Term  Fiscal \nFramework. GoS has decided that under subprogram 1 it will realign its investment portfolio by \nincreasing ADP allocations for the rural economy by at least 15% per annum over the new \nMedium  Term  Fiscal  Framework  period  (FY2009\u2013FY2011).  This  commitment  has  been \nreflected in increased annual allocations in the ADP of FY2009 for the rural economy by 28% \nover the previous year. Under subprograms 2 and 3, GoS will ensure that the rural investment \nplan and rural investment targets continue to be implemented and achieved.  \n \nc.  Improve Land Records \n72.  There are serious shortcomings in the preparation, maintenance, and updating of land \nrecords by functionaries in BOR. Whereas clear and undisputed land titles may be a distant goal, \ncomputerizing land records is one way of moving toward the eventual establishment of clearer \nland titles. Successfully accomplished, this process will bring more transparency, improve public \naccess to land records, and reduce the possibility of errors and fraud. Under subprogram 1, \nGoS has adopted a policy framework and approved budget to implement a computerized land \nrecord  and  titling  regime  throughout  the  province  based  on  surveys.  It  has  approved  the \nplanning commission pro-forma approval for a land administration and revenue management \ninformation system project with a total value of PRs922 million. Under subprogram 2 a pilot is to \nbe completed in 14 selected revenue estates by mid-2009. The result will be evaluated, and the \nprocess and software fine-tuned and finalized before the end of FY2009. Under subprogram 3, \nthe computerization will be implemented throughout the province, leading in the longer run to a \ndatabase of all revenue and land records: ownership, utilization information, tax assessment, \nand so forth. The database will be connected with information kiosks set up in the 121 talukas \n(towns), 23 districts, and the main servers at BOR. \n ", "  21\n73.  Under subprogram 1, BOR will obtain the opinion of the Law Department regarding the \nlegal status of computer-generated title deeds and other forms, e-passbooks, and the necessary \nrecord-keeping changes in light of the provisions of the Land Revenue Act (1967) and related \nrules. Necessary changes to the Land Revenue Act (1967) and related rules will be introduced \nunder  subprograms  2  and  3.  A  separate  complementary  planning  commission  pro-forma \napproval with a budget allocation of PRs649 million has been approved for the creation of a \ngeographic information system for land administration and revenue management to assist in \ndelineating  the  ownership  of  properties  and  lands.  A  third  planning  commission  pro-forma \napproval with the budget allocation of PRs364 million has been approved for preserving old \nrevenue  records;  revamping  of  BOR\u2019s  Survey,  Settlement,  and  Land  Records  Directorate; \nascertaining the record of rights; and demarcating state lands and properties as required under \nthe Sindh City Survey Act (1987), the Sindh City Survey Rules (1988), and the City Survey \nManual. Under subprogram 2, BOR will (i) complete the city survey and mapping in 11 rural \ntowns (as distinct from rural agricultural land) and (ii) prepare a planning commission pro-forma \napproval of survey and map preparation using satellite imagery and digitization. It will then \nembark on the city survey and mapping of the remaining 75 rural towns, completing work in at \nleast 15 towns under subprogram 3. The survey and mapping will be expanded to include urban \nareas over time.  \n \n74.  To ensure better coordination among these three parallel and complementary projects, a \ncombined project advisory committee has been notified, and BOR has started recruiting staff \nand  management  consultants  for  the  combined  program  management  unit  (PMU)  of  the \nprojects for land administration and revenue management information system, preservation of \nrevenue records, and geographic information system. The PMU will be fully staffed, equipped, \nand operational in early 2009. Under subprogram 2, BOR\u2019s Goth Abad Directorate will prepare a \nwork plan and budget, and GoS will provide funds for regularizing villages and issuing sanads \n(title  deeds)  in  all  village  settlements  with  more  than  50  households.  The  directorate  will \nimplement the work plan, complete surveys and the issuance of sanads in at least six districts, \nand then complete work in four districts each subsequent year until the entire province has been \ncovered. \n \nd.  Remove Regulatory Impediments to Market Access  \n75.  The Sindh Agricultural Produce Markets Act (1939) prohibits the establishment of private \nwholesale markets. To counter the anticompetitive nature of the act, GoS will submit under \nsubprogram 1 a summary to the chief minister proposing the amendment or repeal of this act to \nenable the private sector to establish and manage wholesale and bulk markets.29 Subprogram 2 \nwill implement the amendment or repeal of the Agricultural Produce Markets Act. GoS will \nidentify options for private sector management or divestment of government-owned agriculture \nmarkets.  These  actions  will  ultimately  bring  the  private  sector  in  to  replace  government \noperation of agricultural markets. Under subprogram 3, GoS will continue to expand the role of \nthe private sector in the agricultural sector by reducing regulatory barriers in other areas which \nfall under the provincial government mandate to enhance competition, efficiency, and market \naccess.  \n \n                                                 \n29 GoS is considering various options and a decision will be made in the next 2 months.  \n ", " 22 \ne.  Promote Private Sector and Civil Society Participation in Service \nDelivery and Rural Empowerment \n76.  The objective of this subcomponent is to improve social service delivery, which is vital \nfor building up human capital and improving the welfare of rural people. While public sector \nservice delivery infrastructure such as the number of basic health units (BHUs) has expanded in \nrecent years, actual service delivery has not improved visibly in rural Sindh (footnote 17). One \nreason  is  that  the  public  sector  has  been  hampered  by  high  absenteeism  and  a  lack  of \naccountability. While this is a problem common to the whole province and Pakistan in general, \nthe consequences are more acutely felt in rural areas because private sector alternatives are \nlacking. The unsatisfactory performance and slow progress by the public sector have prompted \nthe Government to search for alternative models of service delivery. In this regard, partnerships \nbetween GoS and NGOs have been fruitful.       \n \n77.  In  the  basic  health  area,  GoS  entered  into  a  partnership  agreement  with  PPHI,  a \nsubsidiary of SRSO. PPHI has managed BHUs in 10 districts since 2007. Through enhancing \nincentives, accountability, and community participation, PPHI has been able to significantly \nimprove  basic  health  service  delivery  in  these  10  districts.  Subprogram  1  will support  the \nexpansion of this partnership to 16 districts, and subprogram 2 will support expansion to all 23 \ndistricts  of  Sindh.  To  ensure  quality  services,  subprogram  1  will  support  the  adoption  of \nminimum service standards under PPHI and ensure that sufficient funding is provided to attain \nthem.    \n \n78.  In addition to primary health, GoS has entered into partnership with a number of rural \nsupport programs including National Rural Support Program, SRSO, SAFWCO, and TDRP, for \npromoting holistic rural development. The fiduciary assessments of National Rural Support \nProgram, SRSO, SAFWCO, and TDRP are in Supplementary Appendix C. The activities of \nthese organizations include providing productive assets through in-kind grants, micro-financing, \nmicro-insurance, skills development, and other activities. Subprogram 2 will introduce regular \ncitizens\u2019 satisfaction surveys on social services and publish the results to ensure consistently \nhigh quality of service delivery and improved accountability. Subprogram 2 will support the \ninstitutionalization of a PPP mechanism in public service delivery by adopting a policy and \nregulatory framework on contract management. The development of the PPP policy framework \nto institutionalize contract management will help to address the sustainability problem faced by \nNGO-managed public service delivery programs. The citizens\u2019 satisfaction surveys will help to \nsustain the good performance of NGOs through increased accountability, informed decision \nmaking, and consideration of citizens' preferences.     \n \nC.  Major Recent Achievements \n79.  This section summarizes the areas where GoS has made substantive progress as part \nof subprogram 1 of SGARRP.  \n \n1.  Promote Private Sector Participation  \n \n80.  Sound Delineation of Private and Public Sector Roles. GoS is unequivocal about the \nimportant role of the private sector in boosting growth, generating wealth, and reducing poverty; \nas well as of the facilitating role of government in laying down an enabling environment for the \nprivate sector. This point was emphasized in the chief minister\u2019s budget speech on 16 June \n2008. This thinking marks a sea change from the interventionalist approach of earlier years and \nlays a sound foundation for getting the policy direction right.  ", "  23\n81.  Streamlining the Role of the Government. GoS has started to identify options for \nwithdrawing from the ownership and management of such commercial activities as agricultural \nmarkets.30  \n \n82.  Promoting PPP. The PPP policy board, which is chaired by the chief minister and is \ncomprised of members from both the public and private sectors, has been notified to guide PPP \ndevelopment in the province. The Finance Department has developed a draft concept paper \noutlining the Government\u2019s decision to develop PPP in a holistic manner. Draft PPP policy \nguidelines have been prepared. A focal person in the Finance Department has been appointed \nand the establishment of a PPP Unit is underway. Line departments have identified a list of \nprojects  as  potential  candidates  for  PPP.  This  list  will  be  reviewed  by  technical  experts \nsupported by ADB TA, and tender documents will be developed for selected projects to procure \ntransaction advisory services from the domestic and international markets. GoS has published \nrequests for expressions of interest to select transaction advisory services and identify PPP \npartners for a road project from Hyderabad to Mirpur-Khas. It is also developing VGF and \nproject development fund operational guidelines, and the initial capital injection into these two \nfunds will be carried out in the next few months.  \n \n2.  Improve Public Expenditure Management \n \n83.  Enhancing the Efficiency of Public Investment. GoS has carried out a spring cleaning \nexercise and cancelled about 200 unapproved schemes that were carried forward from past \nyears as ongoing schemes. The new organogram of the M&E wing with significantly enhanced \nstaffing has been approved, and a planning commission pro-forma approval for improving M&E \nhas been drafted. AGS and the Finance Department have installed a unified server based on \nSAP/R3  that  will  provide  real-time  expenditure  data.  These  steps  will  streamline  fund-flow \nprocesses and assist in monitoring the expenditure pattern of the departments for improved \ninternal controls.  \n \n84.  Building  Up  Pension  and  General  Provident  Funds. GoS is leading the way in \nPakistan in taking steps to reduce pension and general provident contingent liability. It created a \npension fund in 2002 and the GPF in 2007 and transferred resources to them annually. The \ncombined size of the two funds is over PRs15 billion. A further PRs5 billion will be transferred in \nF2009. GoS is preparing to establish a professionally managed FMH. A major improvement in \nrecord keeping is expected as a result of the transition, which started in early 2008, from a \npaper-based system toward an automated one. A large number of wage and pension data have \nbeen input into the SAP/R3 module. GoS has created the Employee Benefit Administration Task \nForce to monitor the timeliness and accuracy of data entry.  \n \n  3.  Revitalizing the Rural Economy \n \n85.  Enhancing  Public  Investment.  GoS  has  translated  its  commitment  to  rural \nrevitalization into increased budget allocations. In the FY2009 budget, the investment in rural \ndevelopment projects increased by 28% relative to the previous year.  \n \n86.  Implementing  Institutional  and  Policy  Reforms. GoS has started to confront the \ndifficult issues surrounding land-titling reform. Three planning commission pro-forma approvals \nwith a combined budget allocation of PRs1.89 billion have been approved to carry out land \nadministration and revenue management information system, preserve revenue records, and \n                                                 \n30 The number of public enterprises is relatively small in Sindh at about 14.  \n ", " 24 \nestablish a geographic information system. GoS has shown strong resolve to deal with the \noutdated and anticompetitive Agricultural Produce Markets Act (1939). It has identified reform \noperation and began a process of consultation to amend or repeal the act to allow private \nentities to set up and manage wholesale markets.  \n \n87.  Improving Service Delivery and Empowering the Rural Poor. An alternative service \ndelivery module has been introduced through a partnership with PPHI in 10 districts. PPHI has \nintroduced higher remuneration for doctors, improved basic facilities in BHUs, and strengthened \nthe accountability of doctors. GoS is expanding PPHI service delivery to 16 districts and will \nexpand this initiative to all 23 districts in Sindh.    \n \nD.  Important Features \n88.  Strong Government Ownership. The new GoS has strong ownership of the policy \nactions in the program cluster. The overarching theme of the chief minister\u2019s 16 June 2008 \nbudget  speech  was  the  need  to  introduce  growth  and  pro-poor  orientation  in  the  budget. \nParticular priority has been placed on the revitalization of the rural economy that includes \nmanaging land titling records and creating partnerships with NGOs and the private sector to \ndeliver rural services. To achieve these objectives, GoS is committed to ensuring that public \nspending is prudent, effective, and makes a difference to people\u2019s lives. It is committed to \nimproving the policy environment for the private sector. Extensive dialogue with the government \nhas ensured that all the three core policy areas are in close alignment with GoS\u2019s policy \ndirections.  \n \n89.  Rural Revitalization. GoS is committed to addressing the issue of rural poverty and \nrural\u2013urban inequality. The factors that have created this inequality are complex and present \nformidable  challenges  to  GoS\u2019s  achieving  its  stated  objectives.  The  SGARRP  actions, \nparticularly in CPA 3, are designed to support GoS\u2019s rural revitalization program. The reforms, \nsuch as computerizing land records, seek to change conditions that have persisted for decades, \nif not centuries, and will take years to introduce successfully. The expected benefits from \nsuccessfully implementing the program are tremendous.  \n \n90.  A More Focused Approach. The program design recognizes the complexity of rural \ndevelopment and focuses on a subset of carefully selected measures to promote rural growth \nand reduce urban\u2013rural inequality. This selectivity has necessitated leaving out many other \nimportant  causes  of  rural  poverty,  such  as  the  tenant\u2013landlord  relationship  and  irrigation \nissues.31 The benefit of this approach is that it makes program implementation more focused \nand feasible, thereby improving the prospects of successful SGARRP implementation. \n \n91.  Facilitation of Private Sector Participation in Service Delivery. GoS has traditionally \nseen its role as that of a service provider, regulator, and policy formulator. However, it has not \nhad the institutional or financial capacity to undertake these multiple roles. Recognizing this \nlimitation, GoS intends to transform itself by contracting out essential service-delivery functions \nand divesting itself of functions that are better filled by the private sector. Examples of this new \napproach include the growing role of NGOs in providing basic health services, promoting banks\u2019 \nand  rural  support  programs\u2019  provision  of  much-needed  microfinance  in  rural  areas,  and \nsupporting the growing presence of private operators in the dairy sector. The SGARRP\u2019s first \nCPA supports the transition to removing government from inefficient operations.   \n                                                 \n31 Two factors underpin this choice. First, the issues are complex and require dedicated programs and projects. Second, the World \nBank has two projects on irrigation, and GoS is in the process of implementing the amended Sindh Tenancy Act (2002), which \nsupports a more balanced tenant\u2013landlord relationship.  ", "  25\n \n92.  Lending Modality. The use of the proposed single-tranche modality promotes ongoing \npolicy dialogue between the parties concerned and leads to a more robust program that is both \nflexible and sustainable. The provision that short-term actions must be completed prior to the \nprocessing  of  succeeding  subprograms  allows  GoS  to  proceed  at  a  reform  pace  that  is \nappropriate  to  its  circumstances  and  augments  the  accountability  of  both  GoS  and  its \ndevelopment partners.   \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n93.  Loan Size, Terms, and Conditions. A loan of $100 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources will be provided to finance subprogram 1 of the SGARRP. The loan \nwill have a term of 24 years including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter, and other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan and program agreements. Based on the current resource envelope, subprogram 2 \nis provisionally included in ADB\u2019s budget framework at $80 million and subprogram 3 at $120 \nmillion. GoS has requested $140 million each for subprograms 2 and 3. The specific loan size \nand composition will be confirmed during the processing of subprograms 2 and 3, on the basis \nof reform progress, requirements and availability of resources. Pakistan will be the borrower. \n   \nTable 1.  Major Reform Requirements under the SGARRP \n(PRs billion unless otherwise specified) \nItem  FY2009  FY2010  FY2011 \nPension fund capitalization  5.0  5.0  5.0 \nScaling up rural investmenta  5.0  3.5  4.0 \nLand titling  0.2  0.5  1.2 \nInfrastructure viability gap funding     1.0  2.0 \nReforming public sector enterprises     0.5  1.0 \nOther costs  0.1  0.4  0.8 \nTotal  10.3  10.9  14.0 \n$ Millionb  147.1  155.7  200.0 \na  The rural investment budget allocation increased by 28% from fiscal year (FY) 2008 to FY2009. GoS is \ncommitted to increasing rural investment by at least 15% from FY2009 to FY2011. The rates for FY2010 and \nFY2011 are assumed to be 15%. \nb  The conversion from the Pakistan rupees into US dollars uses an estimated average exchange rate between \nFY2006 and FY2009 with $1 = PRs70.0. \nSources: Government of Sindh Annual Budget 2008/09 and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n94.  The primary reason for the Government\u2019s decision to seek ADB\u2019s policy and financial \nsupport is to promote growth and reduce rural\u2013urban inequality. The financing requirements for \nimplementing  major  reform  actions  are  outlined  in  the  Table  1.  The  size  of  the  loan  is \ndetermined according to (i) the strength of the SGARRP and its development impact; (ii) the \ncosts associated with the implementation of reform and expenditure measures under SGARRP; \nand (iii) and the financing gap of GoS. The use of the subprogram 1 loan proceeds is described \nin greater detail in para.101 below.  \n \n95.  While there are short-term costs associated with reforms, the economic benefits will \ngreatly outweigh the costs in the long run. Increased investment in rural Sindh is essential to \nspur growth, reduce poverty, and improve social indicators in one of the neediest areas of \nPakistan. Computerizing land records will help remove one of the key barriers to investment. \n ", " 26 \nReducing market distortion and enhancing competition will benefit the rural poor. Improving \nmanagement of employee benefits will reduce contingent liability and enhance morale. The \ninstitutional reforms in the Finance Department, P&DD, and line departments will help improve \nthe  quality  of  expenditure  management.  Measures  to  support  PPP  and  reduce  direct \ngovernment  involvement  in  commercial  activities  will  spur  private  investment  and  improve \nefficiency. All these are important for good governance and improving value for money in public \nfinance. \n \n96.  Relending to GoS. The Government of Pakistan will relend local currency generated \nfrom the loan proceeds to GoS. The terms and conditions will be the same as those extended \nby ADB to Pakistan. GoS will assume foreign exchange and interest rate risks.      \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n \n97.  Sindh  P&DD  will  be  the  executing  agency.  It  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall \nimplementation of subprogram 1, including coordinating the implementation of policy actions by \nvarious departments, program administration, disbursements, and the maintenance of program \nrecords. P&DD will set up a PMU. To ensure line department ownership and implementation \neffectiveness, an economic reform unit will be set up in the Finance Department and a project \nmanagement unit for the computerization of land records will be set up in BOR. These two units \nwill act as subprogram management units (SPMUs) of the SGARRP and coordinate with the \nPMU on implementation. The major IAs are BOR and the Finance, Agriculture, Livestock and \nFisheries,  Industries,  Works  and  Services,  and  Irrigation  and  Power  departments.  A  focal \nperson will be appointed in all IAs except the Finance Department and BOR (The program \nimplementation arrangement is described in detail in Supplementary Appendix D). \n \n98.  An executive committee chaired by the chief secretary will be formed to provide overall \npolicy guidance and oversight to the rural revitalization program. A steering committee, chaired \nby the additional chief secretary (Development) and comprising secretaries from all of the IAs, \nwill oversee SGARRP implementation. The committee will meet quarterly and post its major \ndecisions on the SGARRP website that will be established shortly after the program loan \nbecomes effective. ADB may be invited to participate in meetings as an observer.    \n \n  2.  Implementation Period \n \n99.  The subprogram 1 implementation period is from April 2007 to October 2008. ADB has \nbeen  continuously  involved  in  policy  dialogue  with  GoS  throughout  this  period.  The \nimplementation period for subprogram 2 is November 2009\u2013April 2010 and for subprogram 3 \nMay 2010\u2013October 2011. A detailed action plan for subprogram 1 has been developed by GoS \nand ADB. Similar plans will be prepared for subprograms 2 and 3. The action plans will be \nadjusted through coordination between ADB and GoS. \n \n  3.  Tranching and Counterpart Financing \n \n100.  The loan proceeds will be available for withdrawal in a single tranche in the amount of \n$100 million equivalent for subprogram 1, to be released subject to satisfactory completion of all \nsubprogram 1 policy actions, loan effectiveness, and no action that materially reverses the \nobjectives of SGARRP having occurred. \n ", "  27\n101.  Counterpart  Funds.  GoS  will  ensure  that  the  local  currency  counterpart  funds \ngenerated by the loan for subprogram 1 are used to support investment and reforms in line with \nthe  SGARRP.  The  indicative  allocations  are  (i)  $65  million  equivalent  for  increasing  rural \ninvestment and improving rural service delivery; (ii) $1 million equivalent for GoS-managed, \ndemand-driven  TA-related  activities;  and  (iii)  $34  million  equivalent  for  computerizing  land \nrecords,  computerized  performance-based  M&E,  seed  capital  for  the  VGF  and  the  project \ndevelopment  fund,  and  restructuring  and  adjustment  costs  related  to  PSE  divestment  or \nrestructuring. GoS will certify the use of counterpart funds in line with the loan agreement \nthrough audited statements acceptable to ADB. \n \n4  Procurement and Disbursement  \n \n102.  The proceeds of the program loan will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs, \nexcluding local duties and taxes, of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, \nexcluding the items specified in the list of ineligible items (Appendix 7) and imports financed by \nother bilateral and multilateral sources. The proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to \nPakistan  as  the  Borrower,  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans (1998).  \n \n5.  Anticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n \n103.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the SGARRP. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the applicable loan \nregulations.  \n \n104.  The  draft  Sindh  PFMAA  identified  external  auditing  and  internal  control  as  key \nweaknesses of public financial management in Sindh. A core component of the SGARRP is \nimproving internal control, external auditing, and legislative oversight of public expenditure. The \nSGARRP includes reforms to improve public investment management, M&E, employee benefit \nmanagement, and budget planning and execution. Furthermore, the SGARRP supports the \nwithdrawal  of  GoS\u2019s  direct  involvement  in  commercial  activities,  such  as  establishing  and \nmanaging the agricultural markets and industrial sites whose weak governance structure has \ninduced rent seeking by public officials. The SGARRP promotes the conduct of regular citizens\u2019 \nsatisfaction surveys on public services. All these actions are expected to reduce leakage and \nimprove accountability in public expenditure management and service delivery.  \n \n6.  Accounting and Auditing \n \n105.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for withdrawal applications. Before withdrawal, the Government will \nopen a deposit account at the State Bank of Pakistan to receive all loan proceeds. The account \nwill be managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n7.  Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n \n106.  ADB and GoS will carry out periodic reviews of the progress of implementation and \nassess the impact of the SGARRP. The PMU and SPMUs will submit quarterly progress reports \nto  ADB  as  well  as  a  final  report.  GoS  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  the  outcome  of  policy \n ", " 28 \ndiscussions with other multilateral and bilateral agencies that have implications for SGARRP \nimplementation, and will provide ADB with the opportunity to comment on any resulting policy \nproposals. ADB will regularly carry out review missions to review progress and, based on the \nresult, prepare subprogram 2.    \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n107.  The proposed TA will help P&DD; BOR; and the Finance, Industries, and Agriculture \ndepartments to undertake diagnostic studies, identify and evaluate reform options, support \nimplementation,  and  monitor  results.  In  addition,  intensive  interagency  coordination  and \nstakeholder consultation is required. Major TA activities include designing a road map for PPP \nin  the  province,  identifying  options  for  introducing  private  management  or  divestiture  of  a \nnumber of public sector entities, introducing a computer-assisted M&E system, carrying out \nemployee benefit analysis, and assisting in the implementation of computerizing land records.  \n \n108.  The total cost of TA is estimated at $1 million equivalent. ADB will provide $800,000 \nequivalent as a grant from the TA funding program. GoS\u2019s contribution in kind of $200,000 \nequivalent will cover office accommodation, transport, counterpart staff support, and facilities for \nseminars  and  meetings.  A  team  of  international  and  national  consultants  will  be  recruited \nthrough a firm or as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The TA purpose, outputs, methodology, implementation \narrangements, and budget are set out in Appendix 8. This TA will be supplemented by a \nsubproject from ADB\u2019s ongoing Strengthening Fiscal and Public Financial Management in Sindh, \nwhich is financed by the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom. \n \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS  \nA.  Program Benefits \n109.  The  SGARRP  is  expected  to  provide  substantial  benefits  to  the  people  of  Sindh, \nespecially people in rural areas, including the following: \n \n(i)  Streamlined  role  of  the  government  and  enhanced  private  sector \nparticipation. GoS currently owns and manages several public enterprises that \nare at best a drain on fiscal resources and, at worst, crowd out the private sector \nand  distort  the  market.  The  restructuring  or  divestment  of  poorly  performing \npublic sector corporations will bring fiscal savings for GoS and promote a more \nrobust  and  efficient  private  sector  in  Sindh.  The  establishment  of  policy, \ninstitutional, financial, and risk-management mechanisms for PPP in the province \nwill enable Sindh to augment resources and strengths from both the private and \npublic sector for higher investment and growth.   \n(ii)  More efficient allocation of public resources. Budget, planning, and project \nimplementation processes will be improved, in part by reducing the large number \nof  highly  underfunded  projects,  which  divert  scarce  resources  from  priority \nprojects, and thereby bring greater focus and integrity to the ADP process. M&E \nwill be strengthened to ensure that intended project results are delivered to \nbeneficiaries.  Tightening  internal  control  mechanisms  and  improving  external \nauditing will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the use of public funds \nand reduce leakage.  \n(iii)  Improved financial sustainability of pension and other employee benefits. \nIncreases  in  the  contingent  liabilities  of  pension,  GPF,  and  other  employee ", "  29\nbenefits impose a growing and unsustainable burden on the GoS budget. GoS \nseeks to manage employee benefits better by unifying investment functions, \nimproving service delivery, enhancing the policy framework, and strengthening \ngovernance.  These  actions  are  designed  to  free  up  finances  and  reduce \ncontingent  liabilities.  The  improved  delivery  of  employee  benefits  will  boost \nemployee  morale.  Secondary  benefits  in  the  longer  term  include  increased \nsavings and asset accumulation, which can contribute to economic growth.   \n(iv)  Improved rural economic growth and service delivery. GoS is addressing the \nimbalance in economic growth and income gaps between urban and rural areas. \nIt will reform longstanding regulatory distortions that have impeded the entry of \nthe rural population into the market economy, including the archaic land-titling \nsystem  and  the  outdated  and  inappropriate  agricultural  market  law.  These \noutcomes, together with the prioritization of government investment in rural areas \nand contracting out of services that the government has been unable to deliver \neffectively, such as basic health care, will spur rural growth and contribute to \nimproved living standards in rural Sindh. \n \n110.  These benefits will collectively result in higher growth, greater employment, more income \ngeneration, better service delivery, and poverty alleviation in Sindh, particularly in rural areas.   \n \nB.  Program Impact \n111.  Economic and Poverty Reduction Impact. The reform measures in the program, if \neffectively implemented, will engender substantial improvements in the hitherto relatively low \nrates  of  long-term  economic  growth.  Promoting  PPPs  will  generate  more  resources  for \nproductive investments, while reducing GoS\u2019s direct engagement in commercial activities and \nallowing the private sector to manage assets efficiently will contribute to economic growth. \nImproved public expenditure management will bring greater efficiency and higher returns on \npublic  investment.  The  savings  that  will  be  achieved  in  the  medium  and  long  term  from \nemployee  benefit  reform  will  free  funds  for  use  in  financing  development  investments. \nInterventions to revitalize the rural economy will increase public investment and remove market \ndistortions that have constrained economic development in rural areas for decades. Overall, the \nprogram  will  directly  benefit  the  rural  poor  while  contributing  to  poverty  reduction  through \neconomic growth.   \n \n112.  Institutional Impact. The SGARRP will alter the institutional quality of the public sector \nin Sindh. Reforms that reduce direct government involvement in commercial activities and \nencourage PPP will help to streamline the role of government and remove it from inefficient and \nwasteful operations. Improved ADP management will significantly enhance the effectiveness \nand focus of GoS's development efforts, improving development results. The establishment of \nthe PPP Unit and FMH will directly strengthen provincial institutions. Land titling and agricultural \nmarket reforms are landmark institutional changes that have the potential to alter longstanding \ninequalities and will lead to other institutional developments such as the spread of microfinance \nin Sindh as collateral provided by land titles is secured.  \n \n113.  Social  Impact.  Several  major  positive  social  impacts  will  flow  from  the  SGARRP. \nAgricultural market reforms will improve market access for farmers, particularly smallholders. \nPPP in service delivery, community mobilization, and the improvement of social services will \nsignificantly improve the social environment in rural areas. Pension and other employee benefit \nimprovements will provide a social safety net for civil servants in Sindh. Finally, improvements in \n ", " 30 \nthe quality of life occasioned by economic and income growth will have positive social benefits. \nThe SGARRP poverty reduction and social strategy is outlined in Appendix 9.   \n \n114.  Resettlement, Indigenous People, and the Environment. The SGARRP will cause \nneither direct nor indirect involuntary resettlement nor any negative impacts on indigenous \npeoples (for which it is rated category C). The SGARRP is unlikely to have any adverse \nenvironmental impact (category C).  \n \nC.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n115.  The benefits and impacts of the SGARRP are contingent upon several assumptions and \nrisks. Provisions for mitigating measures have been incorporated into the SGARRP design to \nminimize the adverse impact of the risks.  \n \n116.  Political Risks. GoS is comprised of a coalition of parties. The fabric of the coalition is \ndelicate, and political instability could disrupt the progress of the reforms. However, ownership \nof the reform program cuts across political affiliations, which provides greater assurance that the \nprogram is durable. Furthermore, after the turbulent years from 1970s to early 1990s, political \nand social stability in Sindh has significantly improved since the late 1990s. The current GoS \ncoalition won an overwhelming majority in the February 2008 election, giving it a clear mandate \nfor reform. The flexibility inherent in the single-tranche modality is well suited to an environment \ncharacterized  by  potential  political  instability,  since  short-term  actions  can  be  modified  to \nrespond to changes in the policy environment and government priorities.  \n \n117.  Macroeconomic  Risks.  After  experiencing  a  relatively  benign  macroeconomic \nenvironment  for  several  years,  the  macroeconomic  situation  in  Pakistan  has  worsened \nsignificantly in recent months due to a combination of both domestic and international factors. \nGlobal  economic  conditions  have  deteriorated  amid  rising  commodity  prices  and  financial \nmarket turmoil. The oil price hike and rising food prices have particularly strained the fiscal and \nbalance of payments positions in Pakistan, and pushed up inflation. The fiscal pressure on the \nFederal  Government  exerted  by  these  factors  is  expected  to  flow  down  to  provincial \ngovernments. The FY2009 budget of Sindh has factored in this effect and reflects expectations \nof a higher deficit. The impacts of these economic factors have been compounded by the \ndeterioration  in  the  security  situation  across  the  country  which  has  seriously  undermined \nbusiness and consumer confidence. \n \n118.  The worsening macroeconomic conditions in Pakistan call for rigorous measures to \nrestore macroeconomic stability, and structural reforms to rekindle the growth momentum and to \nput growth on a sustainable path in Pakistan. Sustained economic growth and stability are also \nkey necessities for achieving peace and prosperity in the country. ADB is working closely with \nthe Government of Pakistan to put in place measures to both deal with short-term shocks and \naddress long-term structural issues through the Pakistan Accelerating Economic Transformation \nProgram. The commitment of the GoS to pushing through structural reforms by means of the \nSGARRP  remains  unfettered,  despite  the  heightened  macroeconomic  risks.  The  SGARRP \nmeasures to tackle institutional and policy impediments to growth in Sindh, particularly in rural \nareas, are timely, and will help to improve the economic resilience of Sindh and Pakistan in the \nmedium term. \n \n119.  Governance  Risks.  The  SGARRP  reforms  will  introduce  greater  transparency  and \naccountability in both the public and private sector, which may affect those who benefit from \nexisting opaque systems. In particular, land titling and agricultural market reforms will have a ", "  31\nmajor impact on the status quo and disturb vested interests. The effort to introduce more \ndisciplined ADP management is likely to be met with opposition, despite the overall benefits to \nthe province that should flow from this move. GoS\u2019s strong commitment to and ownership of the \nreform program will assist in mitigating this risk. Citizens\u2019 satisfaction surveys will improve \naccountability  in  service  delivery.  The  weak  external  audit  measures  and  internal  control \nmechanisms identified by PFMAA pose major governance and fiduciary risks. The SGARRP \nhas confronted this problem by explicitly introducing measures to strengthen external audit and \ninternal control procedures. The concomitant procurement reforms implemented by the province \nwill reduce the leakage of public finance (Appendix 3).  \n \n120.  Institutional and Implementation Risks. The SGARRP is orientated toward increased \nprivate sector participation in economic activity and service delivery. This focus will reduce \nimplementation risks that would normally be caused by a bureaucracy with weak capacity. \nHowever,  reform  actions  will  be  spearheaded  by  government  departments  and  agencies. \nInstitutional  and  operational  risks  are  arguably  the  most  important  risks  threatening  the \nSGARRP day to day, but these are also risks that GoS and ADB can work together to mitigate. \nA table containing risk identification and mitigating measures is attached in Appendix 10. \n \n121.  Reflecting  strong  ownership,  GoS  is  strengthening  key  departments\u2019  capacity  to \nimplement the reform measures. An executive committee chaired by the chief secretary and a \nsteering committee chaired by the additional chief secretary will be set up. More importantly, an \ninnovative program management structure will be put in place. First, in addition to having an \noverall PMU in P&DD, SPMUs will be established in the Finance Department and BOR to \nensure IA ownership and dedicated staff for program implementation. Focal persons will be \nappointed in all other IAs. Second, the ADB TA grant will support the engagement of a small \nprogram implementation team to work with GoS. Third, GoS is establishing the PPP Unit in the \nFinance Department and strengthening the M&E wing of P&DD. Substantial counterpart finance \nhas been allocated to the PMUs and SPMUs to undertake capacity building across GoS.   \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n122.  In addition to the standard assurances, GoS has given the following assurances, which \nhave been incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n(i)  GoS will carry out the policies and actions in accordance with the schedule of \nreforms in the policy matrix and ensure that the reforms are sustained for and \nbeyond the duration of the SGARRP period. \n(ii)  To help bring about the successful implementation of rural investment schemes, \nGoS will provide sufficient and timely budgetary allocations. \n(iii)  GoS will keep ADB informed of, and will consult with ADB on (a) proposals to \namend  or  repeal  the  Agricultural  Produce  Markets  Act  (1939)  to  eliminate \nrestrictions limiting the private sector in establishing and managing wholesale \nand bulk markets and (b) proposals for restructuring or divestiture of the Sindh \nSmall Industrial Estate Corporation, Sindh Industrial Trading Estate Company, \nSindh Seed Corporation, and Sindh agricultural market committees.  \n(iv)  GoS will use the counterpart funds to provide necessary budget appropriations in \nsupport  of  the  following:  (a)  $65,000,000  equivalent  for  increasing  rural \ninvestment and improving rural service delivery; (b) $1,000,000 equivalent for \nGoS-managed  demand-driven  TA-related  activities;  and  (c)  $34,000,000 \nequivalent  for  computerizing  land  records,  computerized  performance-based \n ", " 32 \nM&E,  seed  capital  for  the  VGF  and  the  project  development  fund,  and \nrestructuring and adjustment costs related to PSE divestment or restructuring.  \n(v)  GoS will ensure that a portion of counterpart funds to finance rural empowerment \nand  social mobilization  programs will  be channeled  through  a  consortium  of \nNGOs comprising NRSO, SRSO, SAFWCO, and Thardeep Rural Development \nProgram.   \n(vi)  GoS will provide the necessary financial and human resources in connection with \nthe computerization of land record keeping and improving the M&E of ADPs. \n(vii)  GoS will give due consideration to the findings and recommendations of the TA \nwhen formulating and carrying out policy reforms under the SGARRP.   \n \nIX.

This sector analysis provides a summary assessment of private sector participation, \npublic expenditure management, and issues relating to the rural economy in Sindh.   \n \nA.  Private Sector Participation  \n \n2.  Background. The private sector plays a key role in promoting and sustaining growth, \ncreating  jobs,  generating  income,  and  expanding  fiscal  resources.  Recognizing  this,  the \nGovernment of Pakistan initiated reforms in the 1990s to create an enabling environment and \nexpand the role of the private sector. A subsequent series of privatization deals have placed \nover 70% of Pakistan's commercial banking sector and telecommunications sector in private \nhands.  \n \n3.  The private sector has traditionally played a very important role in the economy of Sindh. \nThis is partly because Sindh\u2019s economy is more manufacturing oriented than that of other \nprovinces, with almost 24% of provincial gross domestic product coming from manufacturing, \ncompared with 16% nationwide. Because Karachi is a logistical and business hub, Sindh\u2019s \nvalue-added component also stems from services, particularly transport and financial services. \nPublic services play a smaller role in Sindh than in other provinces, accounting for 7% of \nprovincial gross domestic product. Sindh\u2019s private sector plays a very important role in Pakistan. \nIts large-scale manufacturing industry accounted for 48.7% of the national total in fiscal year (FY) \n2005; 66.6% of mining and quarrying, 40.2% of manufacturing, and 38.2%1 of finance and \nadministration in Pakistan are provided by Sindh. Major issues confronting the private sector are \ndiscussed below.  \n  \n4.  Government's  Involvement  in  the  Direct  Provision  of  Commercial  Goods  and \nServices. Government of Sindh (GoS) has divested itself of many public sector enterprises \n(PSEs) over the past decade. The public sector has not, however, totally withdrawn from direct \ncommercial activities. The remaining PSEs include the Sindh Government Press, the Sindh \nSmall Industries Corporation (SSIC), and the Sindh Industrial Trading Estates (SITE). The Sindh \nSeed Cooperation has been under consideration of being revived. Most of these PSEs suffer \nfinancial losses and provide poor-quality goods and services. Continued direct government \ninvolvement in commercial activities constitutes a fiscal drain. More harmfully, it has induced \ninefficiency and rent seeking. For example, the establishment of SSIC and SITE was carried out \nby directly allotting public land to individuals at below-market prices. Some estates remained \nvacant for several years after the allotment of land. The below-market allocation created an \nincentive  for  speculation  on  land  prices,  undermining  the  objectives  of  promoting \nindustrialization. While some estates have become operational, they generally suffer from poor \ninfrastructure and a lack of basic services (Box A2). The allotment of land in the eight Sindh \nagricultural export processing zones was done in a similar manner. Although the establishment \nof the zones started in FY2003, no zone, including the Karachi zone, has become operational. \nAll the zones remain virtually vacant. While exporters have shown interest in making the local \nzone work in Karachi, its development is being held back by the public sector\u2019s slow progress in \nputting in place basic infrastructure. Except for these well-known PSEs, knowledge in Sindh of \nthe number, status, and performance of PSEs is lacking, as information is scattered around \nindividual  departments.  The  draft  Sindh  Public  Financial  Management  and  Accountability \nAssessment (2008) has pointed out that there is very little government oversight of PSEs, and it \n                                                 \n1  The data are from World Bank and ADB. 2006.

The Finance Department is in \nthe process of establishing an overall PSE database. \nBox A2: The Sindh Industrial Trading Estate Company and SindhSmall Industrial Corporation \n \nThe SITE is a fully government-owned entity headed by a managing director from the public sector under the \noversight of a board of directors. The board is chaired by the secretary of industries, and over half of its \nmembership is drawn from the public sector. The SSIC is a corporation managed by the public sector, and its \nmanaging director reports to a board of directors headed by the Minister of Industries.   \n \nThe performance of both SITE and SSIC has been lackluster. Discussions with their staffs revealed that the \nprocess of identifying sites for locating industrial estates is vague and lacks objectivity, resulting in many \nmisplaced and hence uncolonized or undercolonized estates. Development works are executed by SITE and \nSSIC without properly prepared technical designs, resulting in low-quality common facilities and substantial \ndelays in completion. The plot pricing and allotment criteria used by both are archaic and not governed by \nobjective criteria. Many of the plots are kept as land banks for speculative gains. The allotment agreements do not \nstipulate any time frame for setting up and operating industrial and commercial operations. The estates that have \nbeen developed and colonized suffer a serious lack of maintenance of common facilities, which, without due \ninvolvement of the stakeholders, only encounter delayed and inadequate action. The condition of common \nfacilities in most estates is rundown. Faulty planning and designing mean there is very little provision for storage. \nThe management of even the fully colonized industrial estates has been retained by SITE and SSIC and not \npassed on to the stakeholders themselves. Likewise, there is reported to be leakage in the collection of dues. In \nthe case of SSIC, the corporation incurred a net annual loss of approximately PRs50 million in FY2008 on its \ncurrent  budget.  The  management  of  industrial  estates  in  Sindh  requires  urgent  remedial  measures.  The \nfundamental issue is the continued involvement of the public sector in activities that are better managed by the \nprivate sector. \n \nSources: ADB SGARRP team based on discussion with the board members and management of SSIC and SITE, and staff of \nthe Industries Department, Sindh.    \n \n \n5.  Lack of an Enabling Environment for Public\u2013Private Partnership (PPP). There is \nmounting evidence of the advantage of using PPP to deliver public goods and services, rather \nthan  relying  on  the  public  sector  alone.  The  implementation  of  PPP  in  areas  such  as \ninfrastructure will be particularly beneficial for Sindh. Poor infrastructure has been ranked the \ntop investment impediment by rural and urban firms alike. Viable partnerships with the private \nsector serve to improve the quality, quantity, and efficiency of public goods and service delivery \nin both urban and rural areas, which for historical, legal, or economic reasons have remained \nprimarily the responsibility of the public sector.  \n \n6.  The Government of Pakistan has introduced various measures to promote PPP in recent \nyears, including developing a PPP policy and guidelines. GoS also introduced the Sindh Local \nGovernment PPP Rules (2007). Some PPP elements have been considered for projects such \nas the Karachi Mass Transport System and the road from Hyderabad to Mirbur-Khas. However, \nthere is a dearth of capacity in implementing PPP in the province. A popular misperception is \nthat  any  transaction  involving  a  private  sector  and  public  sector  party  is  a  PPP.  This \nmisunderstanding is harmful, as it can lead to uncompetitive transactions based on subjective \nhandpicking by the government, instead of a transparent bidding process. There is no focused \nPPP institution to coordinate PPP development. To fully benefit from PPP, GoS needs to \nestablish institutional, policy, financial, risk-sharing, and concession management mechanisms. \nTransaction quality needs to be ensured through a transparent bidding process. Timely contract \ncompletion needs to be pursued through better project management and appropriate linking to \nincentives and sanctions. There is also a need for an effective mechanism for the independent \nand impartial review and audit of projects involving PPP. \n \n ", "40  Appendix 2 \nB.  Public Expenditure Management \n \n1.  Public Investment Management \n \n7.  Background.  The  budgeting  process  in  Sindh,  as  in  other  provinces  of  Pakistan, \nconsists of a dual system where the Finance Department prepares and executes the recurrent \n(non-development)  expenditure,  and  the  Planning  and  Development  Department  (P&DD) \nprepares and executes the annual development plan (ADP), which deals with public investment. \nThe Sindh ADP increased from PRs5.7 billion in FY2003 to PRs35 billion in FY2007, and the \ndevelopment budget for FY2009 is estimated to be at PRs77 billion. The significant increase \nhas  stretched  implementation  capacity  and  brought  many  systematic  problems  in  ADP \nmanagement to the fore. Because of improper management, the development of road, health, \neducation, and municipal service infrastructure remains underfunded, and existing infrastructure \nsuffers a serious deficit of resources for repair and maintenance.   \n \n8.  Too Many Projects, Too Little Funding. The ADP for FY2009 contains around 1,890 \nprojects, including new, ongoing, and special projects. Of these, some 70% suffer serious \ndelays in implementation. In the Budget Call Circular issued by the Finance Department in \nOctober each year, departments are asked to prepare their proposals for the next fiscal year's \noperations. No guidance is provided on the likely resources available, so that departments work \non the assumption that they will receive increases in nominal funding of 5\u201310%. Similarly, \nP&DD  issues  a  circular  in  October  requesting  proposals  for  the  following  fiscal  year's \ndevelopment  budget.  No  guidance  is  provided  on  the  limit  to  resources  available.  While \ndepartments are aware of the approximate budget ceiling, this has nonetheless not been taken \ninto account when preparing ADPs. Departments submit a list of projects with inadequate \nprioritization. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the departmental coordinating officer receives \nall proposals and simply forwards them to P&DD. Many proposals that are required to include a \nfeasibility study fail to do so. However, these proposals are not rejected but incorporated into \nthe planning process. This practice creates an unnecessary burden, poor quality proposals, and \nan  excess  of  projects  in  relation  to  available  resources.  As  the  ADP  is  prepared  without \nadequate  consideration  and  knowledge  of  the  resources  that  will  be  available  for \nimplementation, it includes more development projects than is optimal. This overcrowds the \nADP.  Consequently,  project  completion  is  delayed.  Besides  being  difficult  to  manage  and \nimplement,  a large number of projects means that more time is required to complete the \nschemes, eroding their economic and social benefits.  \n \n9.  Budget discipline can be introduced through notification of a budget ceiling in respect of \ndepartmental budgets. This would reduce the number of projects put forward by departments, \nenhance  the  quality  of  proposals,  and  improve  funding  outcomes  for  approved  projects. \nHowever, to be successful, such a system requires high-level political support to ensure that no \none,  including  cabinet  members,  will  circumvent  discipline  with  actions  taken  outside  the \napproved budget process.    \n \n10.  Low  Absorptive  Capacity  and  Large  Throw  Forward.  The  capacity  of  line \ndepartments to absorb the initial allocations has been stretched by the large number of projects \nput forward, causing them to under spend the ADP allocation. The low absorptive capacity, \ncoupled with the inclusion of a large number of new schemes, has resulted in the accumulation \nof  many  uncompleted  development  schemes,  which  has  given  rise  to  the  so-called  throw \nforward effect. From FY2007 to FY2008, the number of new schemes in ADP increased by 53%, \nwhile the number of ongoing schemes increased by 27%. According to the Finance Department \n ", "Appendix 2  41 \nand P&DD, the total amount of throw forward as of May 2008 stood at about PRs170 billion, \nwhich is 4.2 times the size of the current provincial ADP allocation.   \n \n11.  Poor  Performance  Orientation  in  Budget  Allocations. Allocation decisions made \nduring the preparation of the ADP are not supported by strategic planning at the policy-making \nlevel. This issue is compounded at the management level by the lack of prioritization criteria to \nguide allocation decisions across and within sectors. In P&DD, ADP allocations are determined \nincrementally, and the amount of resources that each department will receive is not related to its \nperformance in the previous fiscal year in terms of both resource utilization and physical project \ncompletion. An incremental approach also prevails in the line departments. A major shortcoming \nof the current incremental and input-oriented approach is that budget allocations fail to reflect \nservice-delivery goals. While development proposals are now required to submit performance \nmeasures and targets, these are input related and do not seem to be monitored, or is remedial \naction taken when targets are not reached. The lack of a robust mechanism for consolidating \nthe  current  and  development  budgets  and  aligning  expenditure  with  government  priorities \nmeans that it is difficult for governments to know the extent of the effort being applied to any of \nits stated goals.  Midyear monitoring of budget execution is limited to assessing whether the \nexpenditure  of  line  departments  conforms  to  budgeted  amounts,  while  actual  expenditure \nperformance  is  not  well  monitored.  To  improve  fiscal  discipline  and  the  efficiency  and \neffectiveness  of  government  expenditures,  there  should  be  phased  movement  toward  the \nadoption of a medium-term framework that eventually, in the medium- to long-term, focuses on \noutputs and outcomes. \n \n12.  Poor  Internal  Control.  Internal  control  is  important  for  ensuring  efficiency  and \neffectiveness in operations, the reliability of financial information, and compliance with rules and \nregulations. Poor internal controls leave institutions at risk of public resource wastage and \nundermine  the  accountability  process.  The  International  Organization  of  Supreme  Audit \nInstitutions classifies internal controls in five components:2 (i) control environment, reflecting the \ncommitment at the top toward internal controls and the capacity and skills prevalent in the \norganization; (ii) risk management, or identifying, assessing, and responding to risk in terms of \ntransfer, tolerance, and treatment; (iii) control activities, or delineating authorization processes \nand procedures and segregating duties; (iv) the availability of quality information and routine \ncommunication  between  staff  and  management;  and  (v)  ongoing  monitoring  and  periodic \nevaluation. Sindh suffers weaknesses in all of these areas.  \n \n13.  The Government of Pakistan, assisted by the World Bank, has launched the Project to \nImprove Financial Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA) in all accounting offices. The PIFRA has the \ntask of improving accounting and auditing functions by automating financial reporting systems \nwith the accounting software SAP/R3 in the federal, provincial, and district governments. As of \nJune 2008, all 23 district account offices in Sindh and that of the executive district officer for \nfinance and planning have been automated in terms of budget making and financial reporting. \nEight districts have prepared their district budgets on the system. Provincially, the Finance \nDepartment and the Office of the Accountant General of Sindh have SAP/R3 installed and the \nservers unified. Improvements have been made at both the provincial and the district level in \nterms of budget preparation under the new accounting model.  \n \n14.  While automation helps to improve the governance of the public financial management, \nmuch remains to be done to improve internal control. Auditor general reports point to numerous \n                                                 \n2  International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions. 2004. Guidelines for Internal Control Standards for the Public Sector. \nBrussels.  \n ", "42  Appendix 2 \ninstances across government of expenditure approvals that do not comply with budget limits, \nmisclassification of expenditure, and fraud and misuse of public funds and assets. One area in \nparticular that requires attention is the management of movable assets. Inventory controls in line \ndepartments on movable assets are not carried out. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this has \nbrought  substantial  losses  to  the  exchequer,  though  no  official  data  is  available  on  this. \nStandard  operating  procedures  for  asset  disposal  are  archaic  and  lengthy.  Government \ndepartments are required to record any asset worth PRs100,000 or more in a dead stock \nregister. However, the practice is seldom followed, bringing the risk of fraud. Introducing a \nsound management system for movable assets will reduce misuse and misappropriation and \nmake asset depreciation more transparent.  \n \n15.  Weak Audit Compliance and Legislative Oversight. The Office of the Auditor General \nconducts regular external audits of all GoS spending units. The audit reports contain many audit \nobservations  (commonly  referred  to  as  \u2018paras\u2019  in  Pakistan)  addressed  to  the  individual \ndepartments  concerned,  which  have  not  been  settled  because  of  departmental  accounts \ncommittee failure to meet. The departmental accounts committees are administrative bodies \ncomprising of the department officials and audit representatives. Their function is to settle the \ndraft audit observations. In FY2008, most departmental accounts committees met only twice a \nyear. The meeting of the public accounts committee, the legislative body of the Provincial \nAssembly, has not been convened regularly. The public accounts committee did not meet for \n15 years between 1983 and 1998 and has met only twice since 2000. Currently, the Office of \nthe Audit General conducts financial audits focused on compliance with accounting standards \nand  the  regularity  of  transactions  in  government  expenditure.  Its  capacity  to  conduct \nperformance audits for development projects and programs is limited. The examination of value \nfor money to determine whether the expenditure was incurred economically, efficiently, and \neffectively has not been carried out.   \n \n16.  Institutional  and  Legal  Framework  for  Public  Procurement.  Sindh  was  the  first \nprovince in Pakistan to adopt, in 2006, public procurement rules along the same lines as those \nintroduced by the federal Government in 2004. The Public Procurement Regulatory Authority \n(PPRA) Law is currently being vetted by the Law Department. When promulgated, it will fill the \nvacuum created by the lapse of the PPRA  Ordinance (2006). A PPRA has already been \nestablished  under  the  PPRA  Ordinance  (2006),  but  only  the  managing  director  has  been \nappointed. The Sindh PPRA was mandated to provide general principles of procurement and \nthen develop sectoral guidelines and other regulations. However, the sub-legislative work has \nnot  been  carried  out  because  the  capacity  of  PPRA  is  weak.  As  a  result,  most  public \nprocurement  still  takes  place  under  the  old  purchase  manual  procedures,  which  lack \ntransparency. \n \n2.  Pension and Other Employee Benefits \n \n17.  GoS provides pension and other employee benefits to 421,000 employees and pays \nmonthly  pensions  to  an  estimated  108,000  retired  employees  and  surviving  dependents. \nPension and general provident fund (GPF) benefits, defined in detail below, are a form of \ndeferred wages and are expressed as a percentage of basic pay scale. In addition, GoS \nemployees are covered by the benevolent fund and a group insurance policy that pays a death \nbenefit to the surviving dependents of GoS employees.  \n ", "Appendix 2  43 \na.  Employee Benefits for Retirement, Survival, and Life Events \n \n18.  The  pension  scheme  is  an  unfunded,  pay-as-you-go  defined-benefit  scheme.  No \nemployee  contributions  are  made  to  the  pension  scheme.  The  pension  pays  a  lifetime \nguaranteed monthly benefit to retired employees, pre- and post-retirement death benefits to \nsurviving dependents, and monthly income for qualifying permanently disabled employees. The \nbenefit is based on the final monthly basic pay scale wage times 2.33% for each year of service \ncompleted. Eligibility for a pension is contingent upon an employee completing a minimum of \n10 years of service.3 A maximum of 30 years of service can be computed to reach a 70% basic \npay scale replacement. Benefits can be paid once the minimum of 25 years of service is \nsatisfied, providing that the retirement age of 60 is attained. Employees have the option to elect \na commuted benefit of up to 35% of the pension amount due and receive reduced monthly \nbenefits for the remainder of their entitlement.  \n \n19.  In contrast to the monthly income structure of the pension benefit, the GPF pays a single \nsum  at  retirement  comprised  solely  of  employee  contributions  and  accrued  interest.  The \nmandatory contributions 4 are deducted from the civil servants\u2019 monthly pay and range between \n3%  and  8%,  based  on  the  basic  pay  scale.  The  GPF  is  an  unfunded  (notional)  defined-\ncontribution scheme. Interest rates are annually declared by the federal Ministry of Finance and \nhave averaged 15% annually over the past 35 years, well above market rates, placing an \nunnecessary burden on the budget of GoS.  \n \n20.  The  benevolent  fund  is  an  insurance  policy  managed  by  the  Service  and  General \nAdministration Department to reimburse employees for certain expenses related to life events\u2014\nprimarily in case of marriage, to cover funeral costs, and a small monthly grant paid to surviving \ndependents upon the death of the household\u2019s primary breadwinner. The fund is a mandated \ncontributory benefit that accumulates assets, with the investment managed by the Service and \nGeneral Administration Department. The employee claims process is fraught with conflicts, \ndelays, and great employee dissatisfaction. The application of claim payment rules is arbitrary \nand  capricious.  The  delays  and  small  amounts  paid  to  beneficiaries  further  diminish  this \nbenefit\u2019s reputation.  \n \n21.  The financial assistance program pays a death benefit to family members of employees \nwho die in service. The claims are paid through the Finance Department directly from the GoS \nbudget. There is no employee contribution or accumulation investment fund. The State Life \nInsurance Company (SLIC) underwrites the group life insurance benefit for GoS employees and \npays a death benefit to surviving family members. The compulsory contribution to the benefit is \ndeducted from the monthly pay of civil servants. About 80% of GoS employees are insured by \nSLIC for amounts of between PRs150,000 and PRs175,000 in the event of their death. The \nremaining 20% of employees are eligible for higher death benefits. A recent increase in SLIC \npremiums,  a  backlog  of  claims,  and  declining  service  standards  have  led  the  Finance \nDepartment to question whether the current arrangement of paying death benefits from different \nsources constitutes the most efficient option for life insurance.  \n                                                 \n3  For employees who fail to meet the minimum requirement of 10 years of service, a gratuity is paid, calculated at approximately \n1/5 of final month basic pay scale times the number of years of service completed. \n4  Employee GPF contributions became mandatory in 1986; previously the contribution rate was discretionary.  \n ", "44  Appendix 2 \nb.  Issues and Progress in Addressing Liabilities  \n \n22.  Despite redundancies, overlaps, and repetition in payments of old age and surviving \ndependents' income, employees are dissatisfied because benefits are inadequate and poorly \nadministered. On the other hand, GoS struggles to finance ever-increasing contingent liabilities \nfor  pension,  GPF,  and  other  benefits.  GoS  is  analyzing  reform  options  to  streamline  and \nimprove employee benefit record keeping, administration, and delivery. It is also exploring ways \nto  enhance  benefit  investment  functions  and  their  governance  structures  in  line  with \ninternational best practice.   \n \n23.  Table A2 reflects costs and revenues to and from the GoS budget for pension, GPF, and \nother employee benefits. \n \nTable A2: Government of Sindh Budget Allocations for Employee Benefits \n    Annual Budget  Benefits Paid  Total Budget  Contributions/ \n  Current Value of  Transfer into  from Budget Expenditure  Premiums from \nBenefits  Investment Fund Each Fund  (FY2008)  (FY2008)  Employees \nPension Scheme  PRs6 billion  PRs3 billion  PRs6.1 billion   PRs9.1 billion  Inapplicable \nSPF created in August  as of 1 July 2008 \n2002 \nGPF  PRs2 billion   PRs2 billion  PRs1.9 billion  PRs3.9 billion  PRs4.1 billion  \nSGPIF created in May  as of 1 July 2008 \n2007 \nBenevolent Fund  PRs163 million  Inapplicable  PRs484 million  PRs484 million  PRs245 million \nFund created 1990  as of 1 July 2008 \nGroup Life Insurance  Inapplicable    PRs860 million  Inapplicable  PRs414 million \npaid from SLIC   paid to SLIC \nFinancial assistance  Inapplicable    PRs379 million  PRs379 million  Inapplicable \n  Total   PRs8 billion  PRs5 billion  PRs8.9 billion  PRs13.9 billion PRs7.6 billion \nFY = fiscal year, GPF = general provident fund, SGPIF = Sindh General Provident Investment Fund, SLIC = State Life Insurance \nCompany, SPF = Sindh Pension Fund. \nSources: Government of Sindh (GoS) budget figures in Volume I, Annual Budget Statement FY2008; Finance Department, GoS. \nInformation on group life insurance was provided by SLIC. The amount is not from the GoS budget and reflects payments by SLIC in \nthe first quarter of 2008 for the 5-year period ending in December 2007. However, group life premiums reflect only a single year\u2019s \ncollection and were included in the Annual Budget Statement FY2008. The Finance Department provided information on the SPF \nand SGPIF values, and SGA&SD provided the information on the benevolent fund.  \n \n24.  In 2002, GoS created the Sindh Pension Fund (SPF) to finance future pension liabilities. \nIt has transferred funds to the SPF annually since then from the GoS budget. The Finance \nDepartment manages the investments of the SPF. All investment income has been reinvested \nand  not  used  for  financing  current  pension  outlay.  Between  FY2007  and  FY2008,  budget \nexpenditure on pensions increased by 40.6%, and it is expected to continue to rise. GoS will \ninitiate an actuarial valuation to determine pension liabilities and ascertain the amount of the \nimplicit debt. In 2007, GoS created the Sindh General Provident Investment Fund to finance \nfuture GPF liabilities and has since completed two annual transfers to it from the GoS budget. \nThe Finance Department manages the investments of the Sindh General Provident Investment \nFund. All investment income is reinvested and current payments are made from the GoS budget.  \n \n25.  The boards of pension and general provident funds comprise ex officio senior GoS \nofficials. Its investment approach has been conservative to ensure no loss of the principal and \nhas resulted in a portfolio that is made up solely of bank certificates of deposit. The Finance \nDepartment recently prepared a proposal recommending the creation of a fund management \nhouse (FMH), a unit manned by investment professionals. The Asian Development Bank is \nproviding  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  support  the  establishment  of  a  sound  fiduciary \n ", "Appendix 2  45 \nmechanism (a governance structure) that meets international best practice, the analysis of a full \nrange of investment options (an investment structure), and a broadening of the allowable range \nof investments (an investment policy). The TA supports an actuarial valuation of the pension \nand GPF liability. The Asian Development Bank TA will support the review of the cost and \nstructure of all benefits to determine the best options to finance and manage the benefits.  \n \n26.  The record keeping of the pensions and GPF is entering a new phase of data creation \nand retrieval and a new generation of management information. Until recently, virtually all \npension and GPF record keeping was manual, which is difficult to access and relied on a multi-\nstep, paper-driven system that was a source of rent seeking. The PIFRA has created an \nautomated  employee  payroll,  pension,  and  GPF  record-keeping  system.  The  Office  of  the \nAccountant General of Sindh has worked for over 2 years to transfer the paper-based wage and \nemployment histories into the new SAP/R3 system. Until this time-consuming and onerous \nexercise  is  completed,  the  PIFRA-created  software  cannot  be  fully  utilized.  Furthermore, \nmonthly  pensions  paid  from  the  budget  are  plagued  by  problems  of  \u201cghost\u201d  pensioners\u2014\nrecipients who have passed away or otherwise are not entitled to receive monthly payments but \nwhose records still exist in the paper-based system. The conversion from manual, paper-based \nrecords to the computerized system is expected to reduce the number of fraudulent pension \nclaims. The expected completion date for this task is December 2009. GoS is searching for a \nlong-term resolution to the growing contingent liability of employee benefits. The Sindh Growth \nand  Rural  Revitalization  Program  (SGARRP)  and  related  TA  will  support  GoS\u2019s  efforts  to \nidentify and implement options for improvement.  \n \nC.  Revitalizing the Rural Economy \n \n27.  Infrastructure. Rural Sindh has not been successful in exploiting its proximity to Karachi \nfor two reasons. First, the rural areas of Sindh are poorly connected with the rest of the province \nand especially with Karachi. Nearly 20% of rural communities in Sindh still lack basic motor \naccess, and 63% of communities lack paved access. The marketing of farm produce is often \nlimited to farm gates and nearby market sales for lack of transport services and limited access \nto credit. Production trips are mostly conducted along paths and tracks that do not permit the \noperation of vehicles capable of giving economies of scale. Improved connectivity with urban \nareas has been found to reduce the price of inputs and raise farm gate prices for agricultural \nproducts. Thus, improving rural areas\u2019 access to their nearest urban centers should remain a \npriority for GoS. \n \n28.  Cost of and Access to Finance. Access to formal credit has been rated by enterprises \nas a top constraint on the growth of rural enterprises. Limited access to formal credit in rural \nareas is a constraint on agricultural growth and a barrier to creating a more diversified rural \neconomy. The problem is particularly pressing in Sindh, because land is the most widely used \ncollateral in rural areas and Sindh has the lowest percentage of land-owning households in the \ncountry. A World Bank study5 (2007) found that, in Sindh, only 8% in villages and 14% in small \ntowns applied for a formal loan to finance investment or working capital in the 5 years preceding \nthe survey. A major barrier impeding access to finance is the ambiguity of land titles, which \nhinders the provision of collateral required by 80% of approved loans. Clarifying land titles is \nexpected to contribute to improved access to credit.   \n \n                                                 \n5  Sustainable and Development Unit, South Asia Region, World Bank. 2007.

Ambiguity in Land Titling and Outdated Land Record-Keeping System. Since rural \npoverty has increased despite reasonable agricultural growth during the 1990s, it has been \nargued that agricultural growth in Pakistan has become less inclusive. The problem appears \nmore acute in Sindh, as its agricultural sector grew more rapidly than the rest of the country \nduring the 1990s, and, paradoxically, its rural poverty increased more markedly than in other \nprovinces during the same period. Inequality in the ownership of land has been cited as one of \nthe reasons for the lack of inclusiveness in agricultural growth. Because land is the most widely \nused collateral in rural areas, and Sindh has the country\u2019s lowest percentage of land-owning \nhouseholds, land ownership has sharply limited access to finance. \n \n30.  Land markets in Sindh are thin, with less than 0.5% of land sold or bought each year. \nThe most important impediment to the creation of a flexible land market is the ambiguity of the \nagrarian law regarding records of land rights. According to the World Bank (2007) (footnote 5), \nthe present law does not provide for a state certificate of title to land under the aegis of a public \nauthority. Furthermore, there are serious defects in the system of preparing, maintaining, and \nupdating the land records used by the Sindh Board of Revenue (BOR). The entries on the land \nand revenue records provide only presumptive status of rights under the law and have been \nchallenged in various courts.6 Such insecurity of land titling and tenure serves as a disincentive \nto  investment,  reducing  growth  and  employment  opportunities.  The  low  frequency  of  land \ntransactions helps perpetuate the highly unequal distribution of land, hampers labor mobility, \nand reduces returns on family labor. Lack of secure title means landowners are less willing to \nrisk renting out land, which reduces access to land for landless households. Uncertainty over \nthe validity and enforceability of titles makes it harder to buy or sell land.  \n \n31.  Computerizing land records7 is one option for establishing clearer land records and \nreducing fraudulent dealings by land administration officials. It will help to clarify ownership \nrights and tenancy rights as both are covered under the Sindh Land Revenue Act (1967). In \nFY2004, GoS launched a pilot scheme for revenue assessment and computerizing billing and \nthe record of rights in the districts of Hyderabad, Kambar Shadadkot, Khairpur, Larkana, Matiari, \nMirpukhas, Sukkur, Tando Allah Yar, Tando Mohammad Khan, and Umerkot. This was based \non current records with no authentication of the revenue record, i.e., no field verification or \nupdating. The software developed made it cumbersome to accommodate changes in the record \nof  rights.  There  was  a  lack  of enthusiasm  on  the  part of  the  field  functionaries,  who  are \nperceived as beneficiaries of the current outdated system. The net result was that, even for the \nlimited output of computerized revenue bills, both the accuracy and the sustainability of system \nwere questionable. \n \n32.  Distorting  Regulations  and  Ineffective  Market  Facilities.  The  infrastructure, \nframework, and institutional arrangements for the marketing of agricultural products play very \nimportant roles in maximizing returns for farmers. One important piece of legislation in Sindh in \nthis regard is the Agricultural Produce Markets Act (1939), which regulates the purchase and \nsale of agricultural produce, including livestock and poultry. This act has been in place for \nseveral  decades  without  thorough  review  or  revision.  It  restricts  wholesale  transactions  in \nagricultural  commodities  to  regulated  markets  and  permits  wholesale  trade  only  through \n                                                 \n6  World Bank and ADB. 2006. Sindh Economic Report - Pakistan: Securing Sindh\u2019s Future - The Prospects and Challenges Ahead. \nIslamabad (Report No. 35001). \n7  Village land-related records are of two categories: (i) those that are prepared every year and (ii) those that are more permanent. \nTogether, they constitute the \u201cvillage accounts\u201d, and comprise 25 registers. The former category includes the field book and the \ndemand register regarding land revenue, local cess, agricultural income tax, water rate, and so forth. The latter category includes \nthe Record of Rights and the Register of Mutations.   \n ", "Appendix 2  47 \ngovernment-appointed,  registered  commission  agents.  This  setup  tends  to  benefit  the \nintermediaries, locally called arhatyas, at the expense of farmers. \n \n33.  The  marketing  committees  that  manage  and  supervise  the  operation  of  regulated \nmarkets are legally required to be elected by the users of the market. In reality, committees \nhave  been  managed  and  operated  by  government  officials  from  the  Agriculture  Extension \nDepartment,  usually  without  a  committee  being  formed  at  all.  Under  Section  4  (2)  of  the \nlegislation, a license is required from the provincial government to establish a market within a \nnotified area, which is to be managed by a market committee that issues licenses to dealers and \nbrokers and allots shops in the market. The appointment of government officials to administer \nthe  markets  has  weakened  the  accountability  and  administrative  oversight  of  the  market. \nFurther, it has provided potential rent-seeking opportunities to the administrators. Where market \ncommittees exist (in only a handful of the 71 government-operated markets in Sindh), GoS \nnominates the members and maintains significant control over the inflow of resources and \nassets  owned  by  the  market  committee.  This  arrangement  results  in  a  lack  of  committee \naccountability to market users and key stakeholders. The committee has monopolistic power \nand control over the bulk and wholesale purchase and sale of farmer produce in the area, which \nharms the interests of growers. Handling, weighing, and storage infrastructure is in disrepair. \nThese regulated markets impede trade rather than facilitate it.  \n \n34.  Lack  and  Poor  Quality  of  Social  Service  Delivery.  Economic growth and social \ndevelopment  in  rural  Sindh  require  substantial  improvements  in  rural  service  delivery. \nInvestments in human capital (education and health) will enhance the productivity of the poor in \nthe  rural  economy  and  enable  them  to  earn  higher  incomes  in  urban  areas.  Despite  the \nexpansion of  government  infrastructure,  social service  delivery  in  Sindh  is  tainted  by  high \nabsenteeism and low quality of delivery. Progress in social indicators has been slow. Poor \nservices related to health and education contribute to disparities between rural and urban Sindh \nin many social welfare indicators. In recent years, several large nongovernment organization \nprograms supported by international donors have undertaken major rural development efforts. \nIn Sindh, the most notable of these are the National Rural Support Program, Sindh Rural \nSupport  Organization,  and  Thardeep  Rural  Development  Program.  These  programs  have \nachieved  substantial  success  in  organizing  rural  communities,  building  local  community \ninfrastructure, and delivering basic health services. The People\u2019s Primary Health Initiative has \nachieved  through  enhanced  accountability  and  incentives  for  service  providers  significant \nimprovement in primary health services in 10 districts of Sindh. The vertical nature of the \nprogram and its integration with district governments, however, have raised questions about its \nsustainability. This has been a common problem with other rural support organizations.  \n \n35.  The proposed SGARRP aims to assist GoS in carrying out the necessary reforms to \naddress the issues noted above. Given the huge tasks required, the program is structured to \ntackle only some key issues directly (e.g., land titling), while others receive a less-intense focus \n(e.g., access to finance). The selection of reform areas partly reflects the need to complement, \nrather  than  duplicate,  other  donor  support  in  Sindh  (see  the  donor  coordination  matrix  in \nAppendix 4). The SGARRP aims to trigger a reform process that leads to more efficient public \nexpenditure and a more dynamic private sector to enhance growth and prosperity in Sindh.  \n \n ", "48  Appendix 3 \nASSESSMENT OF PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT  \nAND ACCOUNTABILITY IN SINDH  \n1.  The Public Financial Management and Accountability Assessment (PFMAA), 2008 for \nSindh was jointly carried out by the Asian Development Bank, World Bank, Department for \nInternational Development of the United Kingdom, and European Commission. The government \nof Sindh (GoS) welcomed the PFMAA as an independent external review of the province\u2019s \npublic financial management performance and a tool for identifying the reforms needed. A \nbaseline procurement performance assessment is part of the broader PFMAA for Sindh. This \nappendix briefly describes the results from the assessment.  \n \nA.  Public Financial Management and Accountability Assessment In Sindh \n2.  The  PFMAA  uses  the  commonly  accepted  public  expenditure  and  financial \naccountability framework, which covers 31 indicators across 7 core areas: (i) budget credibility; \n(ii) transparency and comprehensiveness; (iii) policy-based budgeting; (iv) predictability and \ncontrol in budget execution; (v) accounting, recording, and reporting; (vi) external scrutiny and \nauditing; and (vii) donor practices. The public financial management performance is assessed \nagainst each indicator, and ratings from A to D are assigned based on the criteria defined by the \npublic expenditure and financial accountability framework. A rating of A indicates international \npractice and B good performance, while ratings of C and D point to the need for improvement. \nTable A3.1 shows how GoS performed against each indicator.  \n \nTable A3.1: Public Financial Management and Accountability Assessment \nIndi- Indica-\ncators  Indicator  Rating    tors  Indicator  Rating \n  Budget credibility      PI-16  Predictability of available funds  B+ \nfor expenditure commitments \nPI-1  Aggregate expenditure out- C    PI-17  Recording and management of  B \nturn compared with original  cash balances, debt, and \napproved budget  guarantees \nPI-2  Composition of expenditure  D    PI-18  Effectiveness of payroll controls  C+ \nout-turn compared with original \napproved budget \nPI-3.

Although Sindh\u2019s performance in terms of budget credibility (realism in the budget and \nits planned implementation) has been generally unfavorable, the indicator for the aggregate \nrevenue  amount  compared  to  the  original  approved  budget  has  a  B  rating.  The \ncomprehensiveness and transparency of the budget system with regards to classification of \nbudget conforming to international standards, comprehensiveness of information included in the \nbudget document, and the transparency of inter-governmental fiscal relations achieved A and B \nratings respectively. The extent of unreported government operations, however, was rated as D. \nThe province\u2019s oversight of aggregate fiscal risks from public sector entities, and the ease of \naccess for the public to key fiscal information are areas where performance has been weak. \nStrengthening oversight of public sector entities is a reform area included in the Sindh Growth \nand Rural Revitalization Program.  \n \n4.  There have been mixed results for policy-based budgeting, where \u201dorderliness and \nparticipation in the annual budget process\u201d was on a par with international standards, but the \n\u201cmultiyear  perspective  in  fiscal  planning  and  expenditure  policy  and  budgeting\u201d  indicator \nindicated need for improvement. \n \n5.  Predictability and Control in Budget Execution. Transparency in defining taxpayer \nobligations and liabilities, the effectiveness of taxpayer registration, tax assessment, and tax \ncollection show poor results overall. There is, therefore, significant room for improvement in \nthese spheres of activity. While the predictability of available financial resources for expenditure \ncommitments and the overall management of cash balance, debt, and guarantees showed good \nperformance;  internal  controls,  internal  auditing,  and  transparency  and  controls  in  public \nprocurement showed weak performance.   \n \n6.  Accounting, Recording, and Reporting. While accounts are regularly reconciled, the \nfrequent carry-over of uncleared balances in suspended accounts undermines the \u201ctimeliness \nand regularity of account reconciliation.\u201d In the same vein, the quality and timeliness of in-year \nbudget execution reports is an area requiring significant improvement. GoS is making good \nprogress  in  preparing  and  presenting  financial  statements  that  are  consistent  with  the \nInternational  Pubic  Sector  Accounting  Standards.  The  province  scored  well  in  the  area  of \ninformation provision on resources received by service delivery units, as the budgeting for this \narea has been done down to a detailed spending level across the province. \n ", "50  Appendix 3 \n \n7.  External Scrutiny and Audit.  This is one area where performance across the province \nhas been weakest due to (i) the time taken before a completed audit report is certified by the \nauditor general and presented to the governor (in the case of provincial government) and (ii) the \nlack of vigor in following up on audit recommendations through the departmental accounts or \nZila (district) accounts committees. Auditing quality has started to improve, with the auditor \ngeneral having begun to use the new risk-based audit methodology according to the Financial \nAudit Manual, which is consistent with International Standards on Auditing. GoS has performed \nwell in its legislative scrutiny of the annual budget law, but the legislative scrutiny of external \naudit reports is weak.  \n \n8.  Donor  Practices.  The lack of consistency between donors\u2019 reporting systems and \nGoS\u2019s  own  budgeting  and  reporting  mechanisms  on  fund  flows  has  caused  difficulties  in \ncompliance.  The  Government  draws  its  budget  from  its  planning  commission  pro  forma \napprovals (project proposal), but the reporting units\u2014\u201cring-fenced\u201d project management units\u2014\ndo not report back on the same basis. Instead, the donors\u2019 reporting requirements become the \ncore reporting arrangements for the project. The proportion of aid funds that are managed by \nusing the government systems shows a better performance, as most aid (at least 75%) to the \nprovince has been in the form of budget support rather than project, or investment, aid.  \n \n9.  Overall,  the  ratings  are  relatively  higher  for  budgeting  but  weaker  in  accounting, \nrecording,  and,  in  particular,  external  auditing.  The  Sindh  Growth  and  Rural  Revitalization \nProgram will include measures to tackle a number of the weakness such as enhancing external \nauditing.  \nB.  The Baseline Procurement Performance Assessment Report of Sindh \n \n10.  The Baseline Procurement Performance Assessment Report provides an assessment of \nthe public procurement system in Sindh using the baseline indicator tool developed by the \nOrganization  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development\u2019s  Development  Assistance \nCommittee. The assessment forms part of the broader PFMAA. The baseline indicator tool \ncomprises four pillars and 12 indicators. Each of the indicators is further divided into several \nsub-indicators. The scoring system for assessment ranges from 3 to 0. A score of 3 indicates \nfull achievement of the stated standard. A score of 2 is given when the system exhibits less-\nthan-full achievement and needs some improvement. A score of 1 is for those areas where \nsubstantive work is needed, and a rating of 0 indicates a failure to meet the proposed standard.1  \n                                                 \n1  Some of the sub-indicators have no score for lack of relevance or where actions have just commenced and it is too early to \nassess achievements.    \n ", "Appendix 3  51 \n \nTable A3.2: Baseline Procurement Performance Assessment \nNo.  Indicator  Score \nA.

Overall, GoS\u2019s performance on procurement has been moderate. Most areas indicated \nare rated below 2, showing the need for improvement. GoS has shown a strong commitment to \nfurther improve the procurement system. The assessment provides a baseline for GoS against \nwhich progress in this area can be periodically evaluated. Continued procurement reforms will \nhelp to improve the efficiency of public resource management. Sindh was the first province in \nPakistan to adopt the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) Ordinance initiated by \nthe federal Government. Currently, the PPRA Ordinance is vetted to become a law, and PPRA \nrules have been developed. Reforms in these areas are expected to significantly improve the \nintegrity and effectiveness of public sector procurement.    \n \n ", " 52  Appendix 5 \n \nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIXa \n \n \nSelected Bilateral \nAsian Development Bank (ADB)  Other Multilateral Agencies \nAgencies \n \nSindh Devolved Social Services Program  World Bank  United States Agency for \n(SDSSP): The just-completed $220 million  Sindh Education Sector  International \nSDSSP (2003\u20132007) provided support to  Development Policy Credit: The  Development \nreduce poverty and gender imbalances by  $100 million Sindh Education Sector  Widening Harmonized \nimproving people\u2019s education, health, and  Development Policy Credit (FY2007\u2013 Access to Microfinance: \naccess to water supply and sanitation.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nTaken together, Pakistan\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, completed in 2003; the 2005 Medium Term \nDevelopment Framework (MTDF) 2005\u20132010, the draft Sindh Vision 2030a developed in 2007 and 2008, and the \nPRSP II currently being developed articulate the country\u2019s medium- and long-term development strategies and \ninvestment plans. Sindh Vision 2030 underlines the need for structural change and transformation and for the \nenhanced competitiveness of the economy aiming for \u201ca developed, industrialized, just and prosperous Pakistan \nthrough rapid and sustainable development in a resource constrained economy by deploying knowledge inputs.\u201d \nThe MTDF outlines specific action and investment plans until 2010 to ensure progress toward achieving the vision. \nIt prioritizes investments in five areas: balanced rural and urban development; accelerating output growth; \nupgrading physical infrastructure; achieving the Millennium Development Goals; and supporting private sector \ndevelopment. The PRSP II draft summary document confirms that the PRSP II has been aligned to the MTDF. \nWhile the MTDF focuses on economic growth to provide a framework for the realization of Sindh Vision 2030, the \nPRSP II itself \u201cpresents a strategy to ensure that the growth is broad-based and leads to effective poverty \nreduction.\u201d The PRSP II is built around seven strategic pillars: (i) creating \u201cworld class infrastructure,\u201d including \nwater  resources,  energy,  transport,  and  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs)  for  infrastructure  development; \n(ii) \u201cdrivers of economic growth,\u201d including urban and rural infrastructure as engines of growth, reaping the \n\u201cdemographic dividend,\u201d and taking advantage of globalization; (iii) \u201ccrafting a competitive advantage\u201d through \nprivate sector development, liberalization and deregulation, and enhancing productivity; (iv) \u201charnessing the \npotential  of  people\u201d  by  focusing  on  human  capital  development,  gender  mainstreaming,  and  employment \ngeneration; (v) \u201cfinancial sector deepening,\u201d which looks at a more vibrant role for financial and capital markets and \nat financial globalization; (vi) \u201ceffective governance and management,\u201d which includes second-generation reforms, \ndevolution, and improved service delivery; and (vii) \u201ctargeting the poor and vulnerable\u201d through social safety nets \nand microfinance. The Sindh Growth and Rural Revitalization Program (SGARRP) will directly and indirectly \nsupport increased investment in rural infrastructure (pillars i and ii, including the promotion of PPPs), promoting \nprivate sector development and increased agricultural productivity (pillar iii), prioritizing government of Sindh (GoS) \ninvestments in education in rural areas (pillar iv), reforms to improve financial governance and management and \nrural service delivery (pillar vi), and targeting the rural poor with comprehensive programs including microfinance \ndelivered by nongovernment organizations (NGOs). \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  is  finalizing  a  new  country  partnership  strategy  (2007\u20132011)  that  rests  on \ninterventions in four focal areas. These focal areas are fully aligned with the national development framework, \nincluding the PRSP-II draft summary document, and represent a carefully selected subset of priorities articulated in \nthe framework. The focal areas include (i) reforms and investment in major infrastructure sectors, (ii) second-\ngeneration reforms to strengthen governance and services to promote structural change, (iii) the development of \nthe urban and rural economy for balanced development, and (iv) effective implementation for development \neffectiveness  and  results.  The  SGARRP  will  introduce  reforms  and  interventions  through  GoS\u2019s  increased \nprioritization of investments in rural areas that directly address all four focal areas and are consistent with GoS and \nnational poverty-reduction priorities.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe slow growth of the rural economy has caused a large and widening income gap between urban and rural \nSindh. Average monthly per capita expenditure in rural areas is only about PRs1,047, about half of the urban \nfigure. Coupled with Sindh having historically suffered inequality, what has emerged is a typical dual economy \nwhose rural\u2013urban inequality is the most pronounced among Pakistan\u2019s four provinces. The rural\u2013urban duality is \nindicated in the economic as well as social sphere. With 99% gross primary enrollment, 72% literacy, and 87% of \nbabies fully immunized, urban Sindh\u2019s social indicators are on a par with those of other developing countries with \ncomparable per capita income. On the other hand, with 58% gross enrollment at the primary level, 38% literacy, \nand 62% of babies fully immunized, the level of human development in rural Sindh is among the lowest in South \n ", "78   Appendix 9 \n \nAsia. The large rural\u2013urban divide is a serious concern for the welfare of the rural population and because it is \npotentially destabilizing. Accelerating rural growth and improving the income of the rural poor are thus urgently \nneeded. Recognizing the importance of reducing rural poverty, it is also important to note that urban Sindh is far \nfrom poverty free. Furthermore, the incidence of poverty in small cities and towns even surpasses that of villages. \nThus, any poverty-reduction efforts should not focus solely on narrowly defined rural areas. \n \nThe SGARRP is a policy-based program that, while introducing policy change and prioritized GoS investment in \nrural areas, essentially provides budget support to GoS to undertake reforms. Core policy area (CPA) 1 promotes \nprivate sector participation in the economy by encouraging PPP and improving the efficiency of public enterprises. \nIt will indirectly contribute to poverty reduction by stimulating economic growth for the province as a whole. CPA 2 \nwill support improvements in public expenditure management that will directly contribute to overall economic \ngrowth, improved efficiency and equity in public expenditure, and poverty reduction. CPA 3 will revitalize the rural \neconomy with direct support for GoS poverty-reduction interventions. \n \n2. Design Features \n \nThe SGARRP will tackle poverty issues in Sindh by promoting economic growth and with more direct measures. \nThe review of the performance of public corporations and consideration of private sector management of them \nunder  CPA  1  will  encourage  greater  private  sector  participation  and  more  efficient  management  of  public \ncorporations, bringing improved performance and economic growth. The enhanced PPP supported by CPA 1 will \naugment resources for more and better public goods and service delivery. Improved budget prioritization and \nallocation under CPA 2 will benefit the poor in Sindh. Improved audit compliance and internal controls will bring \nbetter management of public expenditure and improve the effectiveness of government programs. Reforms to \npublic sector pension and employee benefit schemes will free up additional government resources for use in \nproductive investments to benefit the poor. CPA 3 involves the creation of a rural revitalization task force and the \npreparation of a prioritized rural investment plan for interventions that will contribute to reducing poverty in rural \nareas of Sindh. Other reforms will directly contribute to poverty reduction by (i) eliminating market distortions and \nbarriers to entry that reduce farmer incomes, in particular for smallholders; (ii) improving rural service delivery \nthrough NGOs that empower the rural poor; and (iii) improving agricultural productivity.     \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \n1.  Discuss the impact channels of the policy reform(s) (direct and indirect, short and medium term) to the \ncountry and major groups affected. \n \nIncreased private sector participation in enterprises previously operated by GoS will stimulate economic \ngrowth that indirectly benefits the poor. Better public expenditure management will improve the efficiency, \neffectiveness, and equity of public investment; ensure improved delivery of outputs to the people of Sindh; \nand provide finance to increase investments to benefit the poor. Greater emphasis on redressing the urban\u2013\nrural  inequalities  that  have  persisted  for  decades  in  Sindh,  typified  by  land-titling  arrangements  that \ndisadvantage the poor, and improvements in rural service delivery are important elements of GoS pro-poor \nreforms.  \n \n2.  Discuss the impact of the policy reform(s) on vulnerable groups and ways to address it/them (refer to social \nanalysis). \n \nThe program has no adverse impacts on vulnerable groups.  \n \n3.  Discuss how the policy reform(s) contribute(s) to poverty reduction, pro-poor growth, and the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. \n \nThe SGARRP will encourage greater private sector participation in operating activities that are currently run \ninefficiently by GoS. It will introduce more efficient and effective public sector management through improved \nbudget prioritization, monitoring and evaluation, audit compliance and internal controls, and management of \npension and employee benefit schemes. These measures will leave financial resources that can be used for \nproductive investments that benefit the poor and ensure good value for money for public expenditure. The \nrural revitalization component of the program will channel a substantially larger flow of public resources to \nrural areas, foster a dynamic private sector, improve service delivery, and improve the legal and regulatory \nenvironment to address more effectively the needs of the rural poor. \n ", "Appendix 9  79 \n \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nAs CPAs 1 and 2 address issues of inefficient public expenditure management, there are no specific targeted \nbeneficiaries. The reform program will benefit all citizens of Sindh, including the poor and vulnerable. The improved \nefficiency  and  effectiveness  of  public  expenditure  management  through  improved  resource  mobilization  and \nallocation and better audit and internal controls will ensure that public investments are of greater benefit to the public \nand more responsive to citizens\u2019 needs. The rural revitalization component of the program will allow GoS to target \nmore directly the most disadvantaged and poor people in Sindh and promote greater and more effective service \ndelivery by the private sector.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nDuring program preparation, extensive discussions  were held  with GoS\u2019s Finance Department; Planning and \nDevelopment Department; Board of Revenue; Excise and Taxation Department; Irrigation and Power Department; \nFood Department; Agriculture Department; Livestock and Fisheries Department; Local Government Department; \nEducation Department; Health Department; Sindh Seed Corporation; Sindh Irrigation Development Authority; and \ndistrict governments.
