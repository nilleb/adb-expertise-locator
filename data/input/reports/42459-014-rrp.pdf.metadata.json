The additional financing  will expand the \ncurrent  project,2 which  is  performing  well.  It  includes  (i)  improving  water  supply  systems  to \nmitigate the risks of  chronic kidney disease (CKD), (ii) improving local infrastructure and basic \nservices  delivery,  and  (iii)  advancing  policy  reform  and  strengthening  the  capacity  of  local \ngovernments.3  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nADB  support  to  local  governments.  Sri  Lanka  has  three  types  of  local  authorities \n3. \nunder  nine  provincial  councils:  (i)  municipal  councils  constituted  in  cities  and  large  towns,  (ii) \nurban councils for less urbanized areas, and (iii) Pradeshiya Sabhas (local authorities) in peri-\nurban  and  rural  areas.4 To  respond  to  the  need  to  improve  basic  infrastructure  and  services \nprovided  by  local  authorities,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  Local \nGovernment  Infrastructure  Improvement  Project  in  2005. 5  The  infrastructure  improvement \nproject  supported  subprojects  for  water  supply;  roads;  drainage  and  sewerage;  and  other \nmunicipal  facilities  such  as  public  libraries,  health  care  centers,  and  office  buildings,  under  a \nbottom-up,  demand-driven  approach  that  follows  the  priorities  set  out  by  local  authorities,  and \nimproves  the  financial  management  capacity  of  these  authorities.  One  limitation  of  the \ninfrastructure improvement project was that financial constraints prevented participation by poor \nand  financially  weak  Pradeshiya  Sabhas,  which  thus  were  unable  to  benefit. 6  The  current \nproject,  which  was  approved  in  2011  (footnote  2),  expanded  the  infrastructure  improvement \nproject\u2019s interventions by targeting poorer Pradeshiya Sabhas to improve basic service delivery \nin  less-developed  areas  in  seven  of  the  nine  provinces  (excluding  the  Northern  and  Eastern \nprovinces).  The  subprojects  selected  under  the  current  project  reflect  the  needs  of  the  local \npeople and are implemented by local authorities, who will remain responsible for operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of the assets that are being built. \n \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework of the project has been revised as Appendix 1. \n2   ADB.  2011.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Local Government  Enhancement Sector Project. Manila (Loan \n2790-SRI). \n\n3  Subproject  design,  preparation  of  bidding  documents,  costs  in  meeting  safeguards  requirements,  and  other  due \n\ndiligence for the additional financing were partially financed under the current loan. \n\n4  There  are 22 municipal  councils,  42  urban councils,  and  271  Pradeshiya  Sabhas  in  Sri Lanka  as  of  2016. Local \nauthorities are established under the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act Number 15 of 1987, and are the smallest political unit \nin peri-urban and rural areas. \n\n5  ADB.  2005.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nDemocratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri Lanka  for  the  Local  Government  Infrastructure  Improvement  Project.  Manila \n(Loan  2201-SRI).  All  local  authorities  (including  Pradeshiya  Sabhas)  of  the  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces  are \ncovered under the World Bank\u2019s North East Local Services Improvement Project. The infrastructure improvement \nproject also supported 19 Pradeshiya Sabhas in these two provinces. \n\n6  Under the infrastructure improvement project, Pradeshiya Sabhas had to borrow as well as contribute a part of the \n\nsubproject cost, which prevented financially weaker Pradeshiya Sabhas from fully benefiting. \n\n \n\n\flicensing,  and  approval  systems  and  processes;  (iii)  ensuring \n\nProject support for local infrastructure development. The local authorities under the \n4. \ncurrent  project  are  implementing  one  to  three  subprojects  each;  these  are  chosen  based  on \nlocal  priorities,  with  a  ceiling  of  SLRs50  million  (about  $0.4  million).7 The  focus  of  subprojects \ncompleted  or  under  implementation  includes  (i)  environmental  infrastructure,  (ii)  economic \ninfrastructure,  (iii)  public  health  infrastructure,  and  (iv)  other  local  authority  facilities.  Although \nthe  scale  of  the  investments  is  small,  the  interventions  are  having  a  tangible  development \nimpact  in  local  communities  because  they  address  critical  local  needs.  For  example,  the \nHuluganga bridge constructed in Panwila Pradeshiya Sabha in the Central Province enabled its \ninhabitants to commute to the adjacent town for basic services (e.g., health care, education, and \nmarkets);  prior  to  construction  of  the  bridge  they  had  to  take  a  circuitous  road,  which  was  10 \nkilometers  longer.  Public  health  and  other  facilities  built  by  the  current  project  have  enabled \nlocal authorities to provide better public services to their citizens. \n \n5. \nLocal  government  reforms. To receive support from the project, a Pradeshiya Sabha \nhad  to  agree  to  undertake  a  set  of  reforms.  This  has  proven  effective  in  advancing  reform  in \nlocal  authorities.  All  108  Pradeshiya  Sabhas  supported  under  the  current  project  have \ndeveloped  and  implemented  a  reform  plan  addressing  (i)  improving  service  delivery,  with  a \nfocus on local environmental improvement (including solid waste management); (ii) streamlining \ntaxation, \nthe  effective \nmanagement  of  the  government\u2019s  assets;  and  (iv)  improving  the  administration  systems  and \nmanagement.  Administration  of  Pradeshiya  Sabhas  has  improved  as  a  result  of  the  reforms, \nfacilitated by the use of information technology to unify and improve forms; produce computer-\ngenerated receipts  and approvals;  track  applications;  and  manage grievances,  property  taxes, \nand  libraries.  These  measures  are  increasing  own-source  revenues,  speeding  processing  of \ncitizen  applications,  reducing  workloads  for  citizens  and  local  officials  in  Pradeshiya  Sabhas, \nand resulting in provision of additional, more efficient services to citizens.8 Front office functions \nhave  been  established  in  more  than  90  Pradeshiya  Sabhas  to  provide  more  efficient,  citizen-\nfriendly one-stop services. \n \n6. \nSafe  drinking  water  supply  in  areas  affected  by  the  chronic  kidney  disease. \nSufficient  supply  of  safe  drinking  water  has  become  an  urgent  priority  in  the  dry  zones  of  the \ncountry,  particularly  in  the  North  Central  Province  and  in  some  areas  in  the  Central,  Eastern, \nNorthern,  North Western,  and  Uva  provinces,  where  CKD  of  unknown  etiology  is  becoming  a \nmajor  public  health  threat.9 Scarcity  of  safe  drinking  water  is  considered  as  one  of  the  most \nimportant  risk  factors  leading  to  CKD.  The  government  has  accorded  top  priority  to  mitigate \nCKD, and established the Presidential Task Force on Prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease in \n2015.  The  National Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board  (NWSDB)  has  been  tasked  to  prepare \nand  implement  projects  for  safe  drinking  water  supply  in  the  affected  areas  through  the \ninstallation  of  reverse  osmosis  plants,  the  procurement  of  water  tankers  to  carry  safe  drinking \nwater  to  remote  areas,  the  extension  of  the  existing  water  supply  network,  and  rainwater \nharvesting. 10  The  government  requested  ADB  support  for  sustainable  safe  drinking  water \nservices in CKD-affected areas. Seven schemes with a total of $3.9 million in funding are being \n                                                \n7  For Pradeshiya Sabhas implementing water supply subprojects, this ceiling did not apply. \n8  For  example,  Bingiriya  Pradeshiya  Sabha  in  the  North  Western  Province  was  able  to  (i)  increase  tax  collection \nefficiency from 44% in 2013 to 81% in 2015, (ii) increase the amount of tax collection by 93% during 2013\u20132015, \nand (iii) reduce arrears by 60% during 2013\u20132016.  \n\n9  There  are  an  estimated  70,000  CKD  patients  in  known  high-risk  areas,  with  a  majority  from  the  North  Central \nProvince. The annual death toll is about 2,000. The World Health Organization has recommended the provision of \nclean  drinking  water  in  CKD  endemic  areas,  which  can  be  done  through  central  treatment  facilities  and  a  piped \nnetwork. \n\n10 By  December  2015,  excluding  ADB\u2019s  financing,  NWSDB  implemented  water  supply  systems  improvement  worth \n\nabout SLRs1,000 million ($7 million) in CKD-affected areas in the six provinces. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fsupported by the current project, but the need is much greater, for which additional financing is \nrequired.  \n \n7. \nDemand for  expanding  the current  project\u2019s successful  model. The current project \nis rated on track. It has managed the risks identified during processing and implementation, and \nsuccessful implementation of the project is not threatened by major risks. Hence, expanding the \ncurrent project\u2019s model for the additional financing modality is suitable because of (i) strong links \nof  additional  financing  with  the  current  project  in  terms  of  design  and  implementation \narrangements, (ii) the urgency to support water supply improvement in areas affected by CKD, \n(iii)  the  opportunity  to  expand  the  benefits  of  the  current  project  in  terms  of  reforms  and  local \ninfrastructure improvement, and (iv) the high degree of project readiness. Through provision of \nadditional financing, the government is seeking to expand the successful investment and reform \nsupport provided under the current project and the preceding infrastructure improvement project \nto Pradeshiya Sabhas that did not receive prior support. As the capacity of Pradeshiya Sabhas \nin  less-developed  areas  is  generally  very  limited,  the  additional  financing  will  continue \nsupporting  reforms,  enabling  the  provision  of  citizen-centric  basic  services  by  Pradeshiya \nSabhas,  and  strengthening  their financial  and  administrative capacity. The additional financing \nwill also expand support for improvement of water supply systems in CKD-affected areas, which \nwill  be  the  first  large-scale  intervention  to  reduce  the  risk  of  CKD.  The  additional  financing  is \nconsistent  with  the  ADB  (i)  Water  Operational  Plan,  by  addressing  efficiencies  in  water  use \nwhile  improving  access  to  safe  drinking  water  supply;  and  (ii)  Operational  Plan  for  Health,  by \naiming to enhance health outcomes from water supply improvement.11 \n \n8. \nAdditional  financing  eligibility  criteria.  ADB  eligibility  criteria  for  additional  financing \nhave  been  met. 12  The  project  (i)  remains  technically  feasible,  economically  viable,  and \nfinancially  sound;  (ii)  is  accorded  high  priority  by  the  government;  (iii)  is  consistent  with  the \ncurrent  project\u2019s  development  objectives;  and  (iv)  is  consistent  with  the  current  country \npartnership  strategy,  which  prioritizes  inclusive  and  sustainable  economic  growth,  including \nimproving access to drinking water in lagging regions.13 The current project is performing well in \naccordance  with  ADB's  additional  financing  policy,  and  is  on  track  to  deliver  the  expected \noutputs. 14 As  of  11  July  2016,  cumulative  current  project  contract  awards  total  $48.5  million \n(92.8%  of  the  ADB  net  loan  amount),  and  disbursements,  $34.2  million  (65.1%).  Subprojects \nare relatively small in scale, and safeguards compliance has been met.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  will  be  local  authorities\u2019  capacity  financially  and technically  strengthened  in \n9. \nless-developed  areas  of  seven  provinces  in  Sri  Lanka.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  local \ninfrastructure  and  services  delivered  effectively  by  local  authorities  or  NWSDB  in  less-\ndeveloped  areas  of  seven  provinces  in  Sri  Lanka.  The  impact  statement  is  unchanged.  The \noutcome statement was changed because most of the water supply schemes in areas affected \nby  CKD  will  be  operated  by  NWSDB.  The  original  and  aggregate  targets  are  in  the  revised \ndesign and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \n\n                                                \n11 ADB.  2011.

Output 1 has been added \nfor  the  additional  financing.  The  additions  and  modifications  are  in  the  revised  design  and \nmonitoring framework. \n \n11. \nOutput  1:  Water  supply  systems  in  chronic  kidney  disease-affected  areas \nimproved.  The  additional  financing  will  support  development  and  expansion  of  water  supply \nsystems  in  CKD-affected  areas  in  the  four  provinces  (Central,  North  Central,  North  Western, \nand  Uva)  to  provide  a  continuous  supply  of  safe  drinking  water.  The  schemes  include  the \ndevelopment of new water supply systems and the expansion of existing systems, mostly run by \nNWSDB.  Facilities  such  as  raw  water  intakes,  water  treatment  plants,  overhead  tanks,  and \ntransmission  and  distribution  networks  leading  to  household  connections  are  eligible  for \nfinancing.15 About 30 schemes will be developed or expanded, and will be implemented by the \nrespective  provincial  councils  with  technical  inputs  and  supervision  support  from  NWSDB. \nConsidering the  nature and complexity  of  the  schemes, the  piped  network  will  be  operated  by \nNWSDB,  except  for  a  few  local  authorities  that  have  adequate  operational  capacity.  If  local \nauthorities  are  identified  to  be  the  appropriate  entity  to  implement  the  subprojects,  such  local \nauthorities  will  first  have  to  submit  a  reform  plan,  as  practiced  in  the  current  project,  prior  to \nimplementation of the subproject. The additional financing will also ensure efficient use of water \nthrough nonrevenue water reduction programs. \n \n12. \nOutput 2: Local infrastructure and basic services delivery improved. The additional \nfinancing  will  support  improvement  of  social  and  economic  infrastructure  in  29  Pradeshiya \nSabhas from five provinces (Central, North Western, Southern, Uva, and Western) that have not \nreceived support under either the infrastructure improvement project or the current project. The \napproach  will  remain  the  same;  these  Pradeshiya  Sabhas  will  have  to  submit  a  reform  plan \napproved through a council resolution, which will be reviewed and confirmed by the Ministerial \nCommittee of the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government (MPCLG) to ensure that \nthe  minimum  reform  requirements  are  met.  They  will  then  be  eligible  for  provision  of  a  capital \ngrant for infrastructure improvement. Eligible subprojects include (i) environmental infrastructure \nsuch  as  water  supply  and  sanitation  (including  sewerage),  drainage,  and  solid  waste \nmanagement;  (ii)  economic  infrastructure  such  as  roads  and  bridges  (including  suspension \nbridges);  (iii)  public  health  infrastructure  such  as  maternity  and  health  care  centers;  and  (iv) \nother local authority facilities such as public markets. \n \nOutput  3:  Local  government  policy  reform  advanced  and  capacity  strengthened. \n13. \nThe  additional financing will  support  advancing  business  process  reengineering  and  additional \ncapacity-building  measures  in  the  original  and  additional  Pradeshiya  Sabhas.16 The  activities \nwill  include  (i)  support  for  implementing  the  guidelines  developed  under  the  capacity \ndevelopment  technical  assistance; 17  (ii)  establishment  and  implementation  of  information \n                                                \n15 When providing drinking water through a piped network proves too costly, installation of reverse osmosis plants to \npurify  groundwater  and  procurement  of  water  tankers  to  supply  the  treated  water  may  be  necessary.  These \nschemes will be fully financed by the government and are not included in the scope of the additional financing. \n16 The additional Pradeshiya Sabhas include the 29 under output 2, and those that will implement and operate water \n\nsupply system improvements under output 1. \n\n17 Thirteen  guidelines  have  been  developed  by  ADB.  2011.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Democratic  Socialist \nRepublic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Local  Government  Enhancement  Sector  Project.  Manila,  as  follows:  (i)  tax \nenforcement  and  arrears  recovery  manual,  (ii)  information  sources  available  for  local  authorities  to  increase \ncoverage,  (iii)  standard  agreement  template  for  lease,  (iv)  service  charge  rationalization  model,  (v)  extension  of \nbuilt-up  locality  in  Pradeshiya  Sabhas,  (vi)  incentive  scheme  for  revenue  collectors,  (vii)  standard  request  for \nproposal  for  selection  of  survey  agency  for  conducting  third-party  surveys,  (viii)  process  awareness,  (ix) \n\n \n\n\ftechnology  solutions  in  the  additional  Pradeshiya  Sabhas;  (iii)  continuation  of  support  and \nimprovement  of  information  technology  solutions  in  the  original  108  Pradeshiya  Sabhas, \nincluding  the  development  and  installation  of  additional  software  to  simplify  and  increase  the \nefficiency of local administration; (iv) support for implementing reform plans in the original and \nadditional  Pradeshiya  Sabhas;  and  (v)  capacity-building  programs  to  strengthen  technical, \nfinancial,  and  administrative  capacity  of  the  original  and  additional  Pradeshiya  Sabhas, \nprovincial councils, and MPCLG. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n14. \nThe  overall  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $128.84  million,  with  additional  financing  of \n$67.84  million  (Table  1).

MPCLG  will  continue  to  be  the  executing  agency,  through  its  existing  project \nmanagement unit (PMU), supported by the project management consultant and the design and \nsupervision consultants. Subproject coordination units (SPCUs) under the provincial councils of \nseven  provinces  will  also  continue  to  function  as  the  implementation  units  at  the  provincial \nlevel. 20 Provincial  councils  will  implement  all  subprojects  under  outputs  1  and  2  under  the \nadditional  financing.  NWSDB  will  prepare  detailed  designs,  and  provide  technical  assistance \nand supervision to the subprojects under output 1, for which it will assume O&M responsibility. It \nwill also be represented in the procurement committee and technical  bid evaluation committee \nof  these  subprojects.  The  close  involvement  of  NWSDB  will  ensure  technically  sound  design, \nimplementation,  and  operation.  For  output  2,  the  PMU,  through  the  design  and  supervision \nconsultants,  will  support  detailed  design  preparation  and  ensure  work  quality.  Pradeshiya \nSabhas  will  manage  the  assets  built  under  output  2,  as  is  the  case  for  the  current  project.  All \nprocurement  of  goods  and  civil  works  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as \namended from time to time), and consulting services will be engaged using ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 18).

These  subprojects  are  technically \nstraightforward  and  within  the  existing  capacity  of  NWSDB.  Technical  viability  has  been \nconfirmed for four water supply schemes in the North Central and North Western provinces, and \nwill  be  confirmed  for  the  remaining  schemes  during  subproject  preparation.  As  in  the  current \nproject,  the  technical  viability  of  subprojects  under  output  2  will  be  confirmed  during  feasibility \nstudies, with due consideration of local capacity to undertake O&M. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic  analysis.  The government  identified  water  supply  subprojects  under  output \n19. \n1. Subprojects under output 2 will be selected through a participatory consultation process. The \neconomic  analysis  was  carried  out  for  two  sample  water  supply  subprojects,  chosen  from \namong the identified subprojects in the North Central Province, and for which detailed designs \nhave  already  been  completed:  an  extension  of  the  distribution  network  in  Bendiwewa  and \ncapacity enhancement of the Minneriya water treatment plant. The estimated economic internal \nrates  of  return  of  the  two  sample  subprojects  range  from  16.4%  to  23.0%,  higher  than  the \neconomic opportunity cost of capital (estimated at 12.0%), indicating sufficient economic return. \nThe results of the sensitivity analysis are also satisfactory (except when all downside risks are \ncombined), against (i) capital costs overrun of 20%, (ii) O&M costs overrun of 20%, (iii) benefit \ndecrease of 20%, and (iv) 1-year implementation delay. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fFinancial  analysis.  Some  subprojects  expected  under  output  2\u2014such  as  roads, \n20. \nbridges,  and  drainage  improvements\u2014do  not  generate  cash  revenues,  while  water  supply \nsubprojects  under  output  1  do  generate  cash  revenues.  Therefore,  a  financial  analysis  was \nconducted for two sample representative water supply subprojects under output 1. The financial \ninternal  rates  of  return  were  estimated  at  4.4%  for  the  network  extension  in  Bendiwewa  and \n7.8%  for  the  capacity  enhancement  of  the  Minneriya  water  treatment  plant,  higher  than  the \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  2.8%,  indicating  sufficient  financial  return.  The  results  for \nboth  subprojects  are  also  satisfactory  against  downside  risks,  including  (i)  10%  increase  in \ncapital expenditure, (ii) 10% increase in O&M costs, (iii) 10% decrease in revenues, and (iv) a 1-\nyear  implementation  delay.  All  water  supply  subprojects  under  output  1  are  expected  to  be \nfinancially  viable  as  a  result  of  a  25%  water  tariff  increase  every  3  years,  and  100%  grant \nfunding  for  the  capital  cost.  Moreover,  confirming  the  financial  viability  of  revenue-generating \nsubprojects  under  outputs  1  and  2 is  one  of  the  subproject selection criteria.  For  nonrevenue-\ngenerating  subprojects  under  output  2,  the  PMU  will  assess  the  capacity  and  commitment  of \nlocal  authorities to  allocate  adequate  O&M  funding  to sustain  service  delivery  when  it  reviews \nthe subproject request from local authorities. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n21. \nProject-specific  governance  risks  were  identified  through  the  financial  management \nassessment of MPCLG, provincial councils, Pradeshiya Sabhas, and NWSDB.21 All entities are \nestablished  organizations  with  appropriate  accounting,  reporting,  internal  control,  and  audit \nmechanisms. Based on the assessment, the overall fiduciary risk is considered moderate,  and \nthe  proposed  risk-mitigating  actions  include  (i)  strengthening  the  internal  audit  divisions  by \nrecruiting  new  staff  in  provincial  councils  and  providing  adequate  training  with  the  support  of \nMPCLG;  and  (ii)  procurement  of  an  appropriate  accounting  package,  and  training  staff  in \nprovincial  councils  on  use  of  the  package.  The  current  project  has  implemented  capacity-\nbuilding  programs,  including  the  development  of  financial  accounting  and  asset-management \nsystems  of  Pradeshiya  Sabhas.  The  additional  financing  will  provide  further  support  for \nimproving the financial management capacity of entities concerned. \n \n22. \nAn  updated  procurement  assessment  confirmed  that  the  MPCLG  has  a  sound \nprocurement  system  in line  with ADB  guidelines.  The  procurement  system  is  accountable and \ntransparent, and the overall procurement risk is low. The PMU and the SPCUs have experience \nin  procurement  in  accordance  with  ADB  requirements  and  have  a  satisfactory  track  record. \nProcurement  for  civil  works  and  equipment  will  be  handled  either  at  the  central  or  at  the \nprovincial level to reduce procurement risks, as the PMU and SPCUs have higher capacity and \nmore  experience  than  do  local  authorities.  Transparency  in  procurement,  financing,  and  other \nmatters  will  be  maximized  under  the  project  through  such  measures  as  development  by  the \nPMU  of  a  website  to  disclose  project  information  and  thereby  reduce  corruption  risk  and \nimprove  governance.  Implementation  of  reform  plans  by  local  authorities  will  improve \ngovernance,  through  measures  such  as  enhancing  citizens\u2019  participation,  improving  financial \nmanagement, and establishing a grievance redress mechanism (GRM), as proven in the current \nproject. \n \n23. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \n\n                                                \n21 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n24. \nThe project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. While Sri Lanka has a good \ntrack  record  in  gender  equality,  and  in  particular  in  education  and  health,  many  women  are \ndisadvantaged  owing  to  poor  roads,  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  other  public  services, \nparticularly  in  less-developed  areas  of  the  country.  Limited  access  to  safe  drinking  water \nrequires  household  members,  primarily  women  and  children,  to  spend  considerable  time  and \neffort on fetching water. Inadequate and poor-quality roads limit access by poor communities to \nmarkets, health care centers, and schools, and create safety and security issues for women and \ngirls.  Subprojects  implemented  under  the  current  project  addressed  the  immediate  needs  of \nthese  communities,  including  women.  Construction  of  maternity  centers  and  day  care  centers \ndirectly  benefited  women,  and  improvement  of  water  supply  systems  eased  the  workload  of \nwomen  in  fetching  water.  Under  the  additional  financing,  all  local  authority  facilities,  including \nlibraries, public markets, and health care centers, will have a separate toilet for women and for \nthe disabled, as in the current project. More than 100,000 women will receive treated water that \nmeets  drinking  water  quality  standards.  An  updated  gender  action  plan  will  ensure  that  the \ninclusive  and  participatory  approach  will  be  followed  to  address  the  needs  of  women  and \nsocially marginalized groups. Resources are allocated for the implementation and monitoring of \nthe gender action plan. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n25. \nThe  safeguard  categories  are  the  same  as  for  the  current  project:  category  B  for  the \nenvironment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  Compliance  with  safeguard \nrequirements in the current project has been satisfactory and risks well-managed. The project-\nspecific GRM has been established and functional, with no pending grievance cases reported.22 \nThe  additional  financing  will  have  no  significant  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples, as subprojects with significant impacts will be excluded in \naccordance  with  the  subproject  selection  criteria.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework,  resettlement  framework,  and  indigenous  peoples  planning  framework  prepared for \nthe current project were updated to provide guidance in screening, categorizing, and preparing \nsubprojects,  and  for  impact  mitigation  planning  in  the  event  unanticipated  environmental, \nresettlement,  and/or  indigenous  peoples  impacts  arise  during  implementation.  Three  initial \nenvironmental examinations (IEEs) with environmental management plans prepared for sample \nsubprojects  confirmed \nthe \nthere  were  no  significant  environmental \nsubprojects  are  small  in  scale,  with  very  limited  impacts.  Subproject  sites  are  located  outside \nsensitive  areas,  and  any  impacts  during  construction  and  operation  can  be  avoided  and/or \nmitigated through proper design and high-quality construction and O&M practices. IEEs will form \npart  of  the  bidding  and  contract  documents  and  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review,  no \nobjection, and disclosure prior to contract awards. Due diligence reports on land acquisition and \nresettlement  were  prepared  for  the  same  three  sample  subprojects  to  confirm  there  are  no \nimpacts  on \nindigenous  peoples.  Consultation  and  public \nparticipation  will  continue  throughout  project  implementation,  and  any  safeguard-related \ngrievances  will  be  handled  in  accordance  with  the  existing  GRM.  The  three  framework \ndocuments, IEEs, and due diligence reports were disclosed on ADB and MPCLG websites. The \nproject has developed institutional capacity on safeguards, with safeguard managers in place in \nPMU and SPCUs, supported by specialists in project management and design, and supervision. \nThe semiannual safeguard monitoring reports will be submitted and disclosed on ADB website. \n\ninvoluntary  resettlement  and \n\nimpacts,  because \n\n                                                \n22 A total of nine grievance cases were recorded, and all cases have been satisfactorily resolved. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n26.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  are  described  in \ndetail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.23 Intended  benefits  are  expected  to \noutweigh costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nAudits by the Auditor \nGeneral\u2019s Department are \ndelayed. \n\nMitigating Measures \nADB\u2019s Sri Lanka Resident Mission is engaged in  ongoing dialogue with the Auditor \nGeneral\u2019s  Department  to  undertake  audits  on  time.  Both  the  PMU  and  the  SPCUs \nhave experience with ADB-funded projects. Strengthening the internal audit divisions \nand training; and Procure appropriate accounting package and train staff  \nThe government constituted a committee to study all pending amendments, including \nthe  ones  recommended  under  ADB\u2019s  capacity  development  technical  assistance \nassociated with the current project, and propose final draft amendments to enhance \ndemocratic governance. Follow-on advisory support will be provided under output 3, \nif required. Policy dialogue with the MPCLG will continue. \nEach reform plan requires local authority approval through a council resolution.  The \nPMU  and  SPCUs  will  closely  monitor  the  implementation  of  reform  plans.  The \nsuccessful  implementation  of  reforms  under  the  reform  plans  is  a  key  factor  in \ndetermining budgetary support for local authorities. \n\nAmendments to acts and \nordinances governing the \nlocal government are not \napproved as planned and \nin a timely manner. \nChange in leadership in \nlocal authorities may derail \nreform plan \nimplementation. \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  MPCLG  =  Ministry  of  Provincial  Councils  and  Local  Government,  PMU  =  project \nmanagement unit, SPCU = subproject coordination unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n27. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the  PAM \nand loan documents. \n \n28. \nset forth in the loan agreement. \n \n\nThe  government  has  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n29. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR43,305,000  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for \nthe  additional  financing  of  the  Local  Government  Enhancement  Sector  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources,  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  2.0%  per  annum  during  the \ngrace period and thereafter for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \nloan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n5 September 2016 \n \n\n \n\n                                                \n23 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nCurrent project \nLocal authorities\u2019 capacity financially and technically strengthened in less-developed areas of seven provinces in Sri \nLanka (defined by project). \nOverall project \nUnchanged \n\nRisks \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAudits by the Auditor \n\nPerformance Indicators with \nTargets and Baselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n\n \nCurrent project \nBy the end of the project (2016): \na.
