THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR); (iii) a \nproposed loan, and (iv) a proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Government \nof Australia, both to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam; all for the Greater Mekong Subregion \n(GMS) Flood and Drought Risk Management and Mitigation Project.1 \n \n2.  The regional project is designed to assist three Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) countries: \nCambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam.2 This report and recommendation covers the project \ninterventions  and  proposed  financing  for  the  Lao  PDR  and  Viet  Nam.  The  report  and \nrecommendation covering project interventions and proposed financing for Cambodia will be \npresented to the Board separately upon confirmation of the availability of cofinancing. This two-\nstep processing approach does not compromise the overall integrity of the regional project in \ngeneral and the regional activities in particular. \n \n3.  The project will support the governments of the Lao PDR and Viet Nam to undertake \nstructural and nonstructural measures to prepare for and manage disaster risks linked to floods \nand  droughts.3 Project  interventions  will  (i)  enhance  the  regional  data,  information,  and \nknowledge base for the management of floods and droughts; (ii) upgrade or develop water \nmanagement infrastructure; and (iii) prepare communities to manage disasters such as floods \nand droughts and adapt to climate change. Improved drought management and irrigation water \nstructures will  benefit farmers  on  about  66,000 hectares  of  agricultural  lands and  at  least \n500,000 people will benefit from improved flood management. \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale4 \n4.  The Mekong River stretches from the eastern watershed of the Xizang5 Plateau to the \nMekong Delta flowing over 4,909 kilometers (km) through the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nMyanmar,  the  Lao  PDR,  Thailand,  Cambodia,  and  Viet  Nam  with  a  total  basin  area  of \n795,000 square kilometers (km2).6 The LMB is home to about 60 million people in Cambodia, \nthe Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The Mekong River, while being one of the 20 largest \nrivers in the world, stands apart because of the large fluctuations in seasonal discharge\u2014very \nlow flows in the dry season yet extensive flooding in the wet season.7 River flow is largely \nunaffected by water control structures and follows the seasonal hydrological cycle.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance.

Climate change. The anticipated impacts of climate change and sea level rise in the \nMekong River Basin indicate the water-related vulnerability will be exacerbated.8 Global and \nregional climate change scenario analyses indicate that in the LMB, temperatures as well as \nannual rainfall and runoff will increase and sea level will rise, resulting in increased agriculture \nand economic losses in the Mekong Delta.9 Floods and droughts are projected to become more \nfrequent and intense. \n \n6.  Floods. Annual floods in the LMB are beneficial, nourishing the wetlands and sustaining \nfisheries and biodiversity.10 Extreme floods, however, cause losses and damage to livelihoods, \nagriculture,  and  infrastructure.  The  average  annual  direct  cost  of  flooding  to  agriculture, \ninfrastructure, and buildings in the LMB is $60 million\u2013$70 million, while the average annual \nvalue of flood benefit is estimated at $8 billion\u2013$10 billion (footnote 10). The challenge for flood \nrisk management is to reduce the costs and impacts of flooding while preserving its benefits. \n \n7.  Physical exposure to flood risks in the LMB is high and this is translated into economic \nexposure.11 Damage in monetary terms is higher in Viet Nam, signifying the level of exposure \nresulting from higher development (agriculture and infrastructure) compared to Cambodia and \nthe Lao PDR. Typhoon Ketsana in September 2009 resulted in damage and losses estimated at \n$131 million in Cambodia, $58 million in the Lao PDR, and $800 million in Viet Nam.  \n \n8.  Droughts.12 Droughts, which occur as a result of periods of very low rainfall and river \nflow,  cause  disruption  to  the  livelihoods  of  farmers  and  food  supply  chains.  Droughts  are \nconsidered  disasters  because  they  significantly  affect  poor  and  vulnerable  communities, \nparticularly  by  increasing  household  food  insecurity.13 Water  shortages,  particularly  during \ncritical growth stages of crops, significantly reduce yields. Saline water intrusion in estuaries and \ncoastal areas\u2014exacerbated by the low flows, particularly in the delta area of Viet Nam\u2014is \nanother cause of concern that adversely impacts food production. \n \n9.  The direct costs of drought in the LMB relate to the impact of agricultural droughts\u2014\nreduced yields or total loss of crops, especially rice, together with reduced livestock and fishery \nyields. The 2004\u20132005 drought was severe for all LMB countries, with losses estimated at  \n$42 million in the delta and localized food shortages. The extreme low flows in the Mekong \nRiver during March\u2013April 2010 adversely impacted dry season crops along the Mekong River as \npumping stations were not able to draw water.  \n10.  Insufficient  disaster  preparedness.  Countries  in  the  LMB  have  varying  levels  of \ncapacity to prepare for and manage flood- and drought-related disasters. Actions are mostly \n                                                 \n8  United Nations Environment Programme. 2009.

Bangkok. \n12 Meteorological droughts, defined by low rainfall over the wet season (May\u2013November), reduce yields of rain-fed \nrice and other crops. The agricultural impacts of hydrological droughts are most severe during the dry season, \nwhen less than normal stream flows reduce irrigation and the yield of dry season crops. Hydrological droughts may \nalso occur during the wet season, for example, when less than normal stream flows reduce the volume and extent \nof flood waters stored in the Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia and the yield of its fishery.  \n13 Indirect costs that are difficult to assess are those of perpetuating structural poverty through early childhood \nstunting, ultimately resulting in loss of productivity.  \n ", "3 \nreactive,  rather  than  proactive,  and  are  uncoordinated.  Better  flood  and  drought  disaster \npreparedness requires (i) knowledge availability and sharing of potential changes to the spatial \nand temporal distribution of climate and hydrological variables over the basin as a whole; \n(ii) capacity  for  timely  flood  and  drought  forecasting  and  dissemination  of  warnings  to \ncommunities  at  risk;  (iii)  engagement  of  at-risk  communities  in  the  identification,  analysis, \ntreatment, monitoring, and evaluation of disaster risks in order to reduce their vulnerabilities and \nenhance their coping capacities; and (iv) improved condition of water control infrastructure. \n \n11.  Solutions and opportunities. Improving the disaster preparedness of countries and \ncommunities to manage and mitigate the potential impacts of extreme floods and droughts \nrequires structural and nonstructural initiatives. In terms of nonstructural measures, institutional \nand technical capacity building activities can strengthen regional information and knowledge \ngeneration and sharing with regard to water resources management in general and flood and \ndrought management in particular. Community-based disaster risk management (CBDRM) can \nequip communities, especially women, to access information on disaster risks and enhance \ntheir preparedness.14 Two-way channels for information sharing between local communities, \nriver basin management systems, national level early warning centers, and disaster forecasting \ncenters are necessary. Structural measures include rehabilitation of flood control embankments, \nwater control structures, and rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage structures. \n \n12.  Regional initiatives. The project is one of the flagship programs of the 2002 GMS \nEconomic Cooperation Program Strategic Framework as well as 2008 Vientiane Plan of Action. \nOn  the  regional  level,  the  Mekong  River  Commission  (MRC)  provides  a  framework  for \nsustainable  development  of  the  LMB.15 The  MRC  secretariat  plays  an  important  role  in \nsupporting national agencies and nongovernment organizations with technical services that \nhave regional relevance and also on transboundary issues. ADB and development partners are \nalso  supporting  natural  resource  management  and  climate  change  adaptation  through \nsubregional  initiatives  including  the  GMS  Core  Environment  Program  and  its  Biodiversity \nConservation Initiative and the GMS Core Agriculture Support Program.16  \n \n13.  Relevance  to  national  priorities. The project is aligned with the relevant policies, \nstrategies, and programs such as the following: (i) Lao PDR: Disaster Management Action \nFrameworks,  2003\u20132020;  (ii)  Viet  Nam:  National  Strategy  for  Natural  Disaster  Prevention, \nResponse and Mitigation approved by the Prime Minister in 2007 (Decision No. 172/2007), \nNational  Targeted  Program  to  Respond  to  Climate  Change,  Strategic  Direction  of  Water \nResources  Development  (to  2020  and  toward  2050),  the  Mekong  Delta  Master  Plan;  and \n(iii) Cambodia:  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy  and \nNational Water Resources Policy for Cambodia.17  \n \n14.  ADB support. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020, \nwhich identifies flood and drought mitigation (as part of disaster risk management) as one of the \ntwo urgent challenges to be addressed in the integrated water resource management process.18 \nThe project is also aligned with the ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004) as \n                                                 \n14 CBDRM is a process in which at-risk communities are actively engaged in the identification, analysis, treatment, \nmonitoring and evaluation of disaster risks in order to reduce their vulnerabilities and enhance their capacities. \nCBDRM seeks to strengthen community resilience to disaster-related shocks. \n15 The MRC was formed on 5 April 1995 by an agreement between the governments of Cambodia, the Lao PDR, \nThailand, and Viet Nam. The MRC secretariat is based in Vientiane, Lao PDR. \n16 The GMS initiatives are supported by several development partners, such as the Government of Finland (Core \nEnvironment Program Biodiversity Corridors Initiative pilot and second phases) and the Government of Sweden \n(Implementing the Core Agriculture Support Program Phase 2). \n17 Approved by the Council of Ministers on 16 January 2004. \n18  ADB. 2011.

The project benefits from lessons from past ADB assistance on irrigation development \nand flood management in the region.19  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The impact will be reduced economic losses resulting from floods and droughts. The \noutcome will be improved capacity and preparedness to manage and mitigate the impacts of \nflood and drought events.20 \n \nC.  Outputs  \n16.  The project will have four key outputs: \n(i)  Output 1: Enhanced regional data, information, and knowledge base for the \nmanagement of floods and droughts. The project will support (a) development \nof design criteria for water control infrastructure such as flood and drought risk \nmitigation schemes in the Mekong Delta for Viet Nam; (b) assessment of cross-\nborder  flood  management  options  in  Viet  Nam  and  Cambodia;  and \n(c) establishment of the National Early Warning Center in the Lao PDR.21 \n(ii)  Output  2:  Upgraded  water  management  infrastructure.  The  project  will \nsupport (a) rehabilitation of flood control embankments, associated water control \nstructures,  and  access  roads;  (b)  rehabilitation  of  drainage  canals,  including \nincreasing  flow  capacity  and  improving  water  control  infrastructure;  and \n(c) rehabilitation and extension of canals, water control structures, and irrigation \ndistribution networks. The subprojects in the Lao PDR are the Vientiane capital \nflood  protection  subproject  and  the  Vientiane  capital  irrigation  development \nsubproject. They include approximately 30 km of flood protection embankment, 8 \npumped irrigation schemes, 2 flood drainage pumps, and approximately 30 km of \nflood-proof road (about 4 km of single lane all-weather road and 26.4 km of \ndouble lane, black topped). In Viet Nam, four subprojects will be implemented in \nthe two southern provinces of Dong Thap and Tien Giang: (a) upgrading the \nmain canal system to drain and irrigate Plain of Reeds area (Dong Thap) to \nrehabilitate four canals by dredging about 80 km of canals; (b) Thuong Thoi Tien \nbank protection (Dong Thap) to upgrade and strengthen about 3 km of flood \nembankments to stabilize the left bank of the Tien River in the vicinity of Thuong \nThoi Tien town; (c) control and mitigation of flood risk for the Ba Rai-Phu An area \n(Tien Giang) to upgrade the flood control system by constructing approximately \n24 sluice gates to mitigate flood risks; and (d) upgrading the salinity intrusion \nsystem  for  the  Go-Cong  area  (Tien  Giang)  to  construct  approximately  three \nsluice gates to enhance control of tidal and brackish water movement from urban \nareas  permitting  flushing  while  retaining  additional  fresh  water  resources  in \npaddy growing areas.22 \n(iii)  Output  3:  Enhanced  capacity  for  community-based  disaster  risk \nmanagement. CBDRM activities will be implemented to ensure that communities \nare able to obtain the full benefit from improved water control infrastructure and \n                                                 \n19  ADB. 2003.

In the Lao PDR, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will be the executing agency \nand will delegate responsibility to its Department of Irrigation. The ministry will set up a national \nproject coordination office. Project implementation offices will be established at the Department \nof Meteorology and Hydrology, Department of Waterways, and the Vientiane Capital Provincial \nAgriculture and Forestry Office. In Viet Nam, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development \n                                                 \n24 A country's eligibility for ADF grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its risk of debt distress. \nThe latest debt sustainability analysis determined that the Lao PDR had a moderate risk of debt distress and was \ntherefore eligible to receive 50% of its ADF allocation as grants. \n25 Financing confirmed on 5 June 2012. Equivalent to A$5.85 million (conversion as of 27 June 2012). \n26 Transportation and insurance costs may be financed by ADB. See ADB. 2008. Cost Sharing and Eligibility of \nExpenditures for ADB Financing. Operations Manual. OM H3. Manila. \n27 The following principles were followed in determining the amount of taxes and duties to be financed by ADB: (i) the \namount does not represent an excessive share of the project, (ii) the taxes and duties apply only to ADB-financed \nexpenditures, (iii) the amount is within the thresholds identified during the country partnership strategy preparation \nprocess, and (iv) financing of taxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of the project. \n ", "7 \nwill be the executing agency and will delegate responsibility to its central project office, which \nwill set up a central project management unit in Can Tho City, to be close to the subproject \nsites.  Provincial  project  management  units  will  be  established  within  the  departments  of \nagriculture and rural development of the two participating provinces. \n22.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manuals.28 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  April 2013\u2013March 2019 (6 years) \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  National Steering Committee (Lao PDR) \n(ii)   Executing  Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (Lao PDR)  \nagencies  Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Viet Nam) \n(iii)  Key  Department of Meteorology and Hydrology, Department of Waterways, Vientiane Capital \nimplementing  Provincial Agriculture and Forestry Office (Lao PDR); provincial departments of agriculture \nagencies  and rural development in Tien Giang and Dong Thap (Viet Nam) \n(iv)  Implementation  National project coordination office and three project implementation offices (Lao PDR); \nunits  central project management unit and two provincial project management units (Viet Nam) \nProcurement    Lao PDR  Viet Nam \n  International competitive bidding  multiple contracts  multiple contracts  \n  $18.36 million  $38.70 million \nNational competitive bidding  multiple contracts  multiple contracts  \n$1.08 million  $0.26 million \nShopping  multiple contracts  multiple contracts  \n$ 0.09 million  $0.32 million \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection (80:20)  166 person-months  229 person-months \n$1.94 million  $2.46 million \n  Quality-based selection  $4.14 million  $5.22 million \n  Consultants\u2019 qualifications selection  $0.10 million  $0.13 million \nAdvance contracting  Approved for the recruitment of the project implementation consultants. \nDisbursement  The ADB loans and grant and Government of Australia grant proceeds will be disbursed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to \ntime) and detailed arrangements agreed upon by the governments and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \nSource: ADB estimates.  \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n23.  The structural subprojects involve the rehabilitation and upgrading of the existing water \ncontrol infrastructure. They were selected from sector road maps following these subproject \nselection criteria: alignment with the national strategy; adherence to integrated water resource \nmanagement  principles  of  efficiency,  equity,  and  sustainability;  and  status  of  investment \npreparation. The implementing agencies have the capacity to supervise and coordinate the \nconstruction  of  such  infrastructure.  The  design  capacities  of  flood  control  gates,  drainage \npumps,  and  irrigation  canals  are  based  on  international  norms,  hydrological  and  hydraulic \nanalyses, and hydrographic and topographical surveys of the project areas, and are suited to \nlocal conditions.  \nB.  Economic and Financial \n24.  For irrigation subprojects, incremental production was estimated and production valued \nat derived economic prices for internationally traded goods (in the case of rice). For flood \nprotection  initiatives,  the  prevention  of  loss  to  personal  property,  public  infrastructure, \n                                                 \n28 Project Administration Manuals (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \ncommercial activities, and temporary household relocation was estimated based on current \nlevels of economic activity. The economic internal rate of return estimates range from 12% for \nthe Thuong Thoi Tien embankment subproject to 24% for the Go Cong subproject. In general, \nsubprojects with impacts relating to flood prevention have a higher internal rate of return than \nthose with benefits dominated by irrigated agricultural production. The greatest sensitivity to \neconomic internal rate of return is from development cost escalations (Ba Rai-Phu An and Plain \nof Reeds subprojects) and reductions in flood benefits (Thuong Thoi Tien subproject).29  \nC.  Governance \n25.  All procurement to be financed by ADB loan and grant funds will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Project \nimplementation, procurement, and financial management will be aligned with the governments\u2019 \nstandard operating procedures. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (Lao PDR) and the \nMinistry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (Viet  Nam)  have  given  assurance  that  all \naccounts administered by the implementation units are consolidated and audited annually by \nauditors acceptable to ADB. Financial management assessments concluded that the existing \norganizational structures of the executing and implementing agencies are generally suitable for \nthe implementation of the project and fund flow arrangements are clear. There are shortfalls \nsuch as the lack of experience with ADB project management for some implementing agencies; \nhowever, this will be addressed through training. The project will strengthen staff capacities in \nthe implementation units, particularly in financial management procedures, to allow the efficient \noperation of advance accounts and the reporting of financial performance to the governments \nand  ADB.  The  project  will  establish  or  use  existing  ministerial  websites  to  (i)  disclose \nimplementation progress and bid notifications and their results, and (ii) provide a grievance \nmechanism against any corrupt practice.  \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the governments of the Lao PDR and Viet Nam. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manuals (footnote 28). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.   Benefits. The mitigation and improved management of the risks related to flood and \ndrought events will enable communities to benefit substantially from (i) avoiding loss of property \nand reducing casualties, (ii) increased agricultural productivity and incomes caused by the \nimproved management and availability of water, (iii) improved access through improved rural \nroads and canals, and (iv) reduction of economic losses from disruption of livelihoods.30  \n28.   Gender impacts. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. The key \ngender impacts of the project include increased women\u2019s engagement in (i) management of \ndata and information on floods and droughts, (ii) local disaster risk management activities, and \n(iii) employment generated through civil works and other project activities. The gender action \nplan contains the following gender design features to ensure that (i) at least 40% of trainees in \ndisaster risk assessment and analysis, prioritization, and implementation of locally appropriate \nrisk  management  measures  will  be  women;  (ii)  at  least  40%  of  participants  in  all  public \nconsultations for the development of safer village and commune plans will be women; (iii) at \nleast 40% of community facilitators of the public consultation will be women; (iv) at least 50% of \nthe implementers of the CBDRM measures will be women; (v) at least 40% of commune \nCBDRM coordination committee members will be women; (vi) contractors will prioritize the use \nof local unskilled labor for civil works and at least 30% of unskilled laborers (20% in the \nLao PDR) will be women and equal pay for equal work will be ensured; (vii) at least 30% of \n                                                 \n29 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nproject staff will be women; and (viii) gender-related performance indicators are included in the \nproject monitoring and evaluation framework.31 \nE.  Safeguards \n29.  Environment  (category  B).  The  governments  will  ensure  that  all  subprojects  are \nimplemented in strict conformity with relevant laws and regulations, the requirements of ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement,  and  all  measures  and  requirements  set  forth  in  the  initial \nenvironmental  examinations  (IEE)  and  environmental  management  plans  that  have  been \nprepared for each subproject and endorsed by the governments. The IEEs will be posted on \nADB\u2019s website upon Board approval of the Project.32 All identified adverse impacts resulting \nfrom the location, design, construction, and operation of the water management infrastructure \nare expected to be small to moderate and can be mitigated by adoption of specific measures. \nSpecial  environment-related  assurances  are  prepared  to  mitigate  any  project  impact  on \nadjacent wetlands.33 Further updating of the environmental management plans for individual \nsubprojects  will  be  undertaken  prior  to  the  commencement  of  site-specific  construction \nactivities.  \n \n30.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  A).  It  is  initially  estimated  that  about \n1,814 households (11,065 people) will be affected by the project, including 1,537 households \n(9,222  people)  in  Viet  Nam  and  277  households  (1,843  people)  in  the  Lao PDR.  In  both \ncountries, severely affected households are estimated at about 248 households (1,221 people), \npotentially losing more than 10% of their productive land and/or assets. The total land take is \nestimated at 75 hectares. Six resettlement plans, one for each subproject, have been endorsed \nby  the  governments  and  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website.34 The  resettlement  plans  and  their \nimplementation are designed to ensure that the affected persons will be no worse off as a result \nof  the  project.  The  governments  have  shown  commitment  to  manage  social  risks,  but \ninstitutional capacity building is still necessary and is included in the project. \n \n31.  Indigenous peoples (category C). No indigenous people maintaining distinct cultural \nidentities or separate cultural traditions were found to reside in the project areas.  \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n32.
