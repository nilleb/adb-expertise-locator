I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to Mongolia for the Improving Access to Health Services for \nDisadvantaged Groups Investment Program. \n \n2.  The investment program will reinforce past and ongoing sector reforms by expanding and \nimproving access to quality primary and secondary health services in marginalized areas of \nUlaanbaatar ger (traditional tent) areas, in Khovd and Uvs aimags (provinces), and in selected \nsoums (aimag subdistricts).1 It will also improve health financing systems and reduce out-of-\npocket health expenses nationwide. \n \nII.  RATIONALE \n \n3.  Sector background. Rapid urbanization in Mongolia over the past 30 years has increased \nthe burden on the provision of health and social services in Ulaanbaatar and aimag centers. This \nhas led to a shortage of human resources, funding, and equipment; and obsolete and poorly \nfunctioning health facilities that weaken the accessibility, quality, and equity of health care \nservices. Poor urban infrastructure and weakened government capacity to provide basic social \nservices have exacerbated the situation. Ulaanbaatar has been the main destination for migrants \nfrom Mongolia\u2019s rural areas, and now hosts more than 50% of the country\u2019s population. About \n60%  of  Ulaanbaatar\u2019s  population  lives  in  ger  areas,  with  limited  access  to  running  water, \nsanitation, and social services, including primary health care (PHC). Access to health care is \nchallenging, especially for the poor. Out-of-pocket health expenses are high and account for 41% \nof  total  health  expenditure; 2 one-third  of  household  out-of-pocket  health  expenses  are  for \nmedicines because of high prices and the inappropriate use of drugs. Over 90% of the population \nhas health insurance coverage, but the benefit package is limited to hospital services, with the \nresult that the poor use health services 2.5 times less than the nonpoor.3 In 2015, government \nexpenditure on health accounted for just 2.4% of gross domestic product, well below the 5% target \nof the World Health Organization. Addressing behavioral risk factors, particularly among men\u2014\nincluding obesity, alcohol and tobacco abuse, and gender-based violence\u2014and their associated \nhealth impacts remains a key challenge.4 \n \n4.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been Mongolia\u2019s key health sector development \npartner  since  1993,  providing  five  loans  totaling  $84.90  million,  seven  grants  totaling                \n$37.00 million, and 15 technical assistance (TA) projects totaling $10.65 million. The projects \nachieved significant results through comprehensive health system support and strengthening, \nincluding for PHC reform and investments, information and communications technology, medicine \nand  pharmaceutical  procurement  reforms,  establishment  of  health  insurance,  health \ninfrastructure, human resources for health, and sector governance. ADB has also strategically \nsupported the drafting and enactment of key health policies and laws, including the Health Law \n(2016) and laws related to health insurance, medicines and medical devices, and medical care \nand services.5 With support from ADB, Mongolia was able to achieve its Millennium Development \n \n1  Disadvantaged groups are those with limited access to basic socioeconomic services and have lower income. \n2  J.

It also \nmade significant progress toward the Millennium Development Goal targets of reducing poverty \nand malnutrition, and improving maternal health. \n \n5.  Despite  these  achievements,  Mongolia  faces  a  continuing  burden  from  both \ncommunicable and noncommunicable diseases, resulting in premature mortality and high levels \nof disability, which prevent the nation from fulfilling its economic potential. Economic growth since \n2001 has been strong, but one in five Mongolians still live below the national poverty line and face \nsignificant health care challenges that need to be addressed. \n \n6.  Inadequate provision and quality of primary health care. The rapid influx of rural \nmigrants to Ulaanbaatar\u2019s ger areas is overwhelming the health care infrastructure and the \ngovernment\u2019s capacity to provide health services. This is compounded by neglected laboratory \nand diagnostic services, poor facility maintenance, weak human resource capacity, and an \nunregulated private sector with limited quality control. The quality of Ulaanbaatar\u2019s emergency \ncare service is a concern because of missing equipment and a deficient ambulance fleet. PHC in \nrural  areas faces  challenges  resulting from scarce financing  and  inadequate maintenance. \nMongolia lacks integrated care models, resulting in poor coordination of primary and secondary \nhealth care services. The public\u2013private partnership (PPP) regulatory framework is not well-\ndeveloped and additional support is required to enable the private sector to be an important health \nservice provider. \n \n7.  Secondary health service needs. No district-level hospital service investments have \nbeen made since the 1980s, resulting in services that are inadequate and narrow in scope. District \nhospitals are unable to provide surgical and maternity services that meet national health service \ndelivery standards, and are often poorly maintained, with outdated equipment and inadequate \nstaffing. Most of Mongolia\u2019s population cannot afford care at the few existing private hospitals. \n \n8.  Inefficient health financing system. Mongolia\u2019s input-based health financing model is \noutdated and inefficient, compromising service quality which fail to meet medium- and long-term \nsector needs. The government lacks the capacity to (i) adequately plan, cost, and negotiate \nservices; and (ii) move toward a more efficient output-based financing model based on the \npurchase of services. \n \n9.  Constrained financial and procurement capacity. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has \nweak financial and audit capability, and needs significant improvement in financial management, \naccountability, and transparency. Contract awards and disbursements are often delayed because \nof MOH\u2019s poor capacity to manage complex procurement processes such as those needed for \nlarge-scale health infrastructure. This is worsened by high staff turnover, new procurement rules, \nand outdated financial and audit systems. \n \n10.  Road map, policy framework, and strategic context. In response to these challenges, \nthe Government of Mongolia has developed an integrated road map that includes a sustainable \ndevelopment vision with a clear policy and regulations, and is developing a health sector master \nplan, 2019\u20132027.6 Mongolia\u2019s Sustainable Development Vision 2030 confirms the government\u2019s \ncommitment to ensure access to universal health coverage (UHC) through the provision of \nequitable, accessible, and quality health services without financial hardship.7 The State Policy on \nHealth, 2017\u20132026 outlines Mongolia\u2019s goals to extend average life expectancy by improving the \n \n6  ADB. 2017.

The health sector master plan will provide a platform for a \ncoordinated response that ensures effective use of public and private investments. \n \n11.  The strong health sector road map will enable Mongolia to move toward UHC, focusing \non strengthening of health systems supported by robust and well-anchored financing structures. \nIncreasing investments in quality PHC is the most cost-effective way to ensure improved access \nto essential health care. Mongolia plans to allocate at least 5% of gross domestic product and \n12% of government spending on health and limit patients\u2019 out-of-pocket expenditures to 25% of \ntotal health spending. Building on past experiences, ADB will continue to closely engage in policy \ndialogue to ensure a strong, resilient, sustainable, and responsive health system. The government \nwill  prioritize  other  critical  elements,  including  sound  procurement  systems,  the  supply  of \nmedicines and health technologies, and well-functioning health information systems. Several \nMOH initiatives, including shifting to an output-based health financing system and strengthening \nof health sector governance, have contributed to ensuring access to essential packages of health \nservices  and  improving  the  implementation  of  the  health  insurance scheme.  Health  sector \ninvestments in human capital and capacity improvements will have a positive effect on economic \ngrowth. The proposed ADB investment program will provide physical and nonphysical support to \nsix out of eight health policy areas and will (i) improve primary and secondary health care services, \nand  \n(ii) strengthen the government\u2019s health financing system and financial and procurement capacity. \n \n12.  The government\u2019s health sector road map is consistent with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for \nHealth, 2015\u20132020, which supports government efforts to achieve UHC by improving the use of \nand access to health services, quality of health care, and health financial risk protection.9 The \ninvestment program will support the implementation of ADB's Strategy 2030 by (i) addressing \nremaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  (ii)  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equity,  \n(iii) tackling climate change and enhancing environmental sustainability, (iv) making cities more \nlivable, and (v) strengthening governance and institutional capacity.10 It is aligned with ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan, 2019\u20132021; and country partnership strategy, 2017\u20132020 for \nMongolia.11 \n \nIII.

The  program  will \nestablish 10 new gender and client-friendly family health centers (FHCs) providing expanded \nhealth services to target populations in Ulaanbaatar, and six new gender and client-friendly soum \nhealth centers (SHCs) in selected aimags to strengthen PHC. Low-carbon technology (LCT) will \nbe installed in three FHCs in selected aimags. Integrated primary and secondary health care \nmodels will be implemented in at least five districts and 10 aimags, and PPP models for equipment \nmaintenance and service delivery will be pilot-tested for FHCs.  \n \n15.  Output 2: District and aimag hospital services improved. The program will establish \na model, gender-sensitive district hospital in Chingeltei district, and upgrade Khan Uul district \nhospital in Ulaanbaatar by functionally linking in- and outpatient services for surgery, obstetrics, \ngynecology, and other disciplines. LCT energy sources will be installed in Khan Uul district \nhospital. Khovd and Uvs aimag hospitals will be expanded through a new outpatient department. \nPHC services will be improved through strengthening hospital autonomy in line with MOH \nregulations, and PHC management capacity will be enhanced.  \n \n16.  Output 3: Health financing system strengthened. The program will strengthen the \ncapacity of health staff and streamline health services by establishing a program for service \nquality monitoring, stewardship, and policy coordination for a strategic purchasing model involving \nthe health insurance organization (HIO), the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the MOH, and local \ngovernments based on issued regulations.13 Institutional capacity will be developed through a \nprogram for systems performance analysis and evidence-based decision making at the MOH.  \n \n17.  Output 4: Procurement and financial management capacity of government health \nentities strengthened. The program will support a continuous capacity building program for \nprocurement, financial, and risk management procedures for the government entities.  \n \n18.  Use of multitranche financing facility. These outputs are best financed by an MFF to \nefficiently  and  effectively  achieve the  outcome.14 The  government  has a  sector road map \nconsistent with the national development vision, and a health reform framework15 that is well-\naligned with the program. The investments are significant for the sector and will allow for a phased \napproach with a well-defined financial envelope. The MFF permits ADB to consolidate its long-\nterm partnership with the government on policy dialogue and capacity development, improves \nreadiness for subsequent tranches, reduces transaction costs, and enhances sustainability. It will \ngenerate knowledge and lessons that will benefit the design of subsequent tranches and other \nhealth projects across ADB. Performance records and independent reviews of previous projects \nindicate that MOH can manage and complete the investments within the MFF availability period. \nThe MFF allows ADB to assist in implementation of the policy framework combing infrastructure \ninvestments,  policy  dialogue  and  sector  reforms  through  a  strategic  partnership  with  the \ngovernment.

Tranche 1 will finance all activities listed under \n \n16 Introduction of LCT in health facilities will be funded by the Japan Fund for the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JFJCM) \ntrust fund (administered by ADB). \n ", "6 \nProject 1. Projects 2 and 3 will continue investments under tranche 1; each will be prepared in \nrelation to the previous project. \n \n20.  Development coordination. ADB is Mongolia\u2019s key development partner in the health \nsector; other partners support the prevention and control of communicable diseases and the \nimplementation of health programs. The World Bank supports digital health, while the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency and the Economic Development Cooperation Fund of the \nRepublic of Korea are setting up tertiary health facilities. MOH chairs the sector coordination \ncommittee, which aims to ensure effective coordination and synergies between development \npartners  and  key  stakeholders.  The  committee  also  provides  a  platform  for  improving \ncollaboration between public and private sector health operators. \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s value addition. Lessons learned from past ADB health sector projects in Mongolia \nhave been integrated into the proposed investment program. Recommendations from the project \nprocurement-related review (PPRR)17 conducted in 2017 led to the introduction of a design and \nbuild procurement methodology to avoid implementation and disbursement delays for outputs 1 \nand 2. Output 4 will reinforce a good governance approach to manage financial, audit, and \nprocurement  risks.  Key  innovations  in  output  3  include  helping  Mongolia\u2019s  HIO  focus  on \npurchasing rather than passively financing services. This will enhance equity in the distribution of \nresources, increase efficiency, manage expenditure growth, and promote quality in health service \ndelivery. The program will also introduce LCTs in health infrastructure in Ulaanbaatar, applying \nenergy-efficient heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems; highly insulated windows; \nrooftop photovoltaic power generation; and ground source heat pumps. Innovative gender design \nfeatures and a PPP pilot program, which will outsource medical equipment and health facility \nmaintenance, will also be introduced. ADB will provide complementary TA support for (i) preparing \nthe health sector master plan, 2019\u20132027; (ii) strengthening capacity on hospital autonomy; and \n(iii) building capacity on health financing.18 \n \nC.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n22.  The investment program is estimated to cost $163.51 million, including taxes and duties, \nphysical and price contingencies, interest, and other charges during implementation (Table 2). \n \n23.  Financing plan. The government has requested an MFF of up to $158.34 million from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance part of the investment program. The MFF will \nconsist of three tranches, subject to the government\u2019s submission of related periodic financing \nrequests, execution of the related loan agreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms and \nconditions and undertakings in the framework financing agreement. The first tranche of the MFF \nwill comprise a regular loan of $66.14 million and a concessional loan of $10.00 million. The \nregular loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 6 years; an annual interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  (the  interest  and  other  charges  during \nconstruction to be capitalized in the loan); and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft loan agreements. Based on the straight-line method, the average maturity is 15.75 years, \nand the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per year. The concessional loan will have a \n25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2.0% per year during the \n \n17  Project Performance Under Past Assistance Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Footnote 6; ADB. 2015.

The first tranche will finance civil works for the construction of health facilities, medical and \ninformation technology equipment, air transportation for the NECC, consulting services, and \ncapacity building. The government will finance taxes and duties totaling $1.69 million. The Japan \nFund for the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JFJCM) will provide grant cofinancing for tranche 1 to \nfinance LCT and related costs in an amount equivalent to $3.48 million, to be administered by \nADB.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n27.  Due diligence confirmed that the application of imaging, laboratory, and sterilization \nmedical technology in health infrastructure will follow national guidelines. The climate change \nmitigation component will introduce technology already familiar in Mongolia. The JFJCM grant \nincludes strategic capacity building to ensure the sustainability of the investment and continued \nsupport for operation and maintenance. The investment program has allocated enough resources \nfor capacity building. The three TA projects supported by ADB will also provide targeted capacity \nbuilding to ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of the MFF (footnotes 6 and 16). \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n28.  Economic analysis. The economic analysis covers 30 years, including MFF 10-year \nperiod from 2019 to 2029. The estimated program economic benefits from improved access \n(geographic and financial) to quality health care include avoided loss of productive life years \nbecause of premature death and permanent disability, savings in medical care expenses, and \nproductivity gains from time savings. Other economic benefits were not quantified because of \npractical constraints. The economic value of land is nearly zero. The program investments are \neconomically justified, and each tranche has an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) above \nthe  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  6%,  based  on  a total  project financial  cost  of       \n$163.51 million. The base-case EIRR is from 13.5%\u201323.3%, while the EIRR for the overall project \nis 21.5%. A sensitivity analysis conducted by tranche and for the overall program indicates the \nEIRR remains robust under combined risk scenarios. The poverty impact ratio shows that 40% of \nthe economic benefits of the program will reach the poor, who comprise 27% of the country\u2019s total \npopulation; the program will therefore have a positive impact on poverty alleviation. \n \n29.  Financial  analysis.  The  program  has  no  revenue-generating  component,  and  the \nfinancial sustainability analysis therefore focused on the fiscal capacity of the government to \nfinance the counterpart funding and incremental recurrent costs after completion. The program \nwas found to be financially sustainable at the project level, because the average funds required \nduring MFF implementation (2019\u20132029) and throughout the program loan period (2019\u20132049) \nis at 1.45% of the annual budget forecast. This is within acceptable (2%\u20133%) limits as compared \nwith other programs of a similar nature. The total program requirements can be financed from the \nforecast unused budget balance, which has ranged from 3% (2017) to 10% (2012) of the approved \nannual budget. The predictability of the health care budget is low, which poses substantial risk. \nThis has historically resulted in health care service shortages and deficiencies, and inefficient \nhealth care system financing. To ensure project sustainability, the government has agreed to \nprovide assurances that operation, maintenance, and other required funding will be available on \na timely basis. Risks and mitigation measures are outlined in Table 5. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n30.  The MFF includes capacity development of the executing and implementing agencies, \nGPA, and program implementation unit (PIU) on managing (i) risks associated with delays in \ncontract awards and disbursements; and (ii) risk associated with compliance with ADB\u2019s project \nmanagement; procurement procedures; safeguards monitoring; and accounting, reporting, and \nauditing requirements. The financial management and procurement risk assessments concluded \nthat the financial management risk is substantial, the procurement risk is high, the internal and \nexternal audit functions are perceived to be weak, and the country and sector procurement risks \n ", "10 \nare high. Complex and high-value contracts are expected under the program. However, both the \nexecuting agency and the GPA will have adequate capacity to facilitate full compliance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB \nBorrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). Mitigation measures have been incorporated \ninto the program design (output 4) and their application will be closely monitored during program \nimplementation. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed  with  the  government  and  the  MOH.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the FAM (footnote 19). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n31.  The poverty and social analysis confirmed that all residents, including vulnerable groups \nin the program areas, will benefit from the proposed outputs. The program will create inclusive \nand gender-sensitive health services in the poorer and disadvantaged areas of Ulaanbaatar and \nin  selected  aimags  and  soums.  It  will  reduce  out-of-pocket  health  expenses  through  the \nimplementation of a new health financing model. About 200,000 people living in ger areas in \nUlaanbaatar (Khan Uul and Chingeltei districts) and 180,000 from the rural population (Khovd and \nUvs aimags and six selected soums) will directly benefit from the program. The social and gender \naction plan (SGAP) was prepared by ADB to ensure positive impact for all beneficiaries.20 The \nprogram will enhance staff capacity of the FHCs and SHCs to better respond to the differentiated \nrisk factors and specific health care needs of different vulnerable groups, including the poor, \nwomen, people with disability, and ethnic minorities. \n \n32.  Project 1 is classified gender equity as a theme. A combined SGAP for the MFF and \ntranche 1 was developed. Project 1 will (i) provide gender-sensitive and culturally respectful health \ncare services, (ii) create awareness and build capacity of staff on gender-based and domestic \nviolence cases, (iii) identify and develop gender-based violence guidelines for medical staff to \nidentify and refer cases to FHCs, (iv) improve the capacity of FHCs and SHCs to provide \ngynecological services, (v) build the capacity of medical staff and communities on key risks related \nto noncommunicable diseases, and (vi) integrate gender dimensions in the design of the health \nfinancing model. The executing and implementing agencies will monitor the implementation of the \nSGAP and will provide periodic progress reports. A social development and gender specialist will \nassist the executing and implementing agencies in the effective implementation and monitoring \nof the SGAP. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n33.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the safeguard categories \nof project 1 are as follows.21 \n \n34.  Environment (category B). An initial environmental examination and an environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP)  were  prepared  by  ADB  to  comply  with  the  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement.22 Subsequent tranches may be category B or C, but any activities that trigger category \nA are excluded from funding. Environmental impacts are anticipated during the construction and \ndemolition of structures, including dust and noise from earthworks, transport, and handling of \naggregate materials and waste; temporary traffic disturbances; and risks to community and \n \n20 SGAP of the MFF and Tranche 1; and Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 ADB. Safeguard Categories. Recategorization of safeguards will be undertaken for subsequent tranches. \n22 Initial Environmental Examination: Including Environmental Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "11 \noccupational  health  and  safety.  If renovation  or refurbishment  for  any  component  requires \nremoval of asbestos-containing materials, the particular activity will be dropped from the MFF \nprogram. Mitigation measures defined in the EMP, such as construction site management and \nregular monitoring of the project\u2019s environmental performance during construction and operation, \nwill  minimize  anticipated  impacts  and  reduce  other  construction-related  health  and  safety \nconcerns to acceptable levels. The environmental assessment and review framework (EARF) \nprovides guidance for selection, screening, and categorization; environmental assessment; and \npreparation  and  implementation  of  the  program\u2019s  environmental  safeguard  plans.  All  three \nprojects under the investment program must comply with EARF requirements to be eligible. The \nPIU and its environment and social safeguards specialist, assisted by implementation consultants, \nhave adequate capacity to implement mitigations required by the EMP for project 1, and the EARF \nfor subsequent projects 2 and 3. \n \n35.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The components under project 1 will not trigger \nany land acquisition or involuntary resettlement impacts. Due diligence confirmed that land \ncertificates and/or possessions have been issued, indicating ownership of land by the hospital, \ndiagnostic center, and FHCs. A resettlement framework has been prepared by ADB for the MFF \nto guide the screening, preparation, and implementation of a land acquisition and resettlement \nplan for any components with involuntary resettlement impacts in subsequent tranches. \n \n36.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The Khovd and Uvs aimags are home to the following \nethnic groups: Bayad, Buriad, Durvud, Kazakh, Khalimag, Khalk, Khoton, Myangad, Torguud, \nTuva, Uriankhai, Uuld, and Zakhchin. The poverty and social analysis found that ethnic minority \ngroups will not be adversely affected and that they will equally benefit from project 1. The SGAP \nincludes measures to enhance access to and promote socially inclusive and culturally responsive \nhealth care services. An indigenous peoples planning framework has been prepared by ADB for \nthe MFF to guide the screening, preparation, and implementation of ethnic minority development \nplans for any differentiated impacts on ethnic minorities for subsequent tranches.23 \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n37.
