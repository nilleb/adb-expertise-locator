In 2015, Bhutan\u2019s economic growth rate \nagain  increased  to  an  estimated  5.9%,  supported  by  the  easing  of  credit  restrictions  and \ncontinued  hydropower  construction.  Bhutan\u2019s  economic  growth,  which  is  likely  to  accelerate \nfurther, 5  has  been  fueling  rapid  urbanization.  Once  a  small  percentage  of  the  country\u2019s \npopulation,  Bhutan\u2019s  urban  population  is  estimated  to  have  grown  by  about  4.7%  each  year \nsince 2000 when it was only 25.4%, and now forms a third of the total population; this proportion \nis expected to reach 50% by 2020. This unprecedented urban growth is placing severe pressure \non  Bhutan\u2019s  cities,  and  has  created  a  shortfall  of  basic  urban  infrastructure  and  services  for \nresidents. Meeting the challenges of urban infrastructure development, urban management, and \nmunicipal finance has become a key objective of the developmental agenda of the Government \nof Bhutan and its development partners.6 \n \n4. \nEstablished in 1995, Thimphu is the largest and fastest-growing city in Bhutan. The city\u2019s \npopulation was estimated to be 116,0007 in 2015 (15.3% of the national population), and it is the \nmost densely populated place in Bhutan, with 3,046 persons per square kilometer.8 The city has \nbeen  struggling  to  manage  urban  expansion  to  the  north  and  south  of  the  city  center,  and  to \nprovide  sufficient  basic  urban  infrastructure.  As  a  part  of  the  government\u2019s  Thimphu  Structure \nPlan,9 the  government  adopted  an  area-wide  planned  development  strategy  involving  a  land-\npooling scheme, whereby each landowner contributes approximately 25% of his or her land in \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The project is included in ADB. 2015.

Thimphu. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nexchange for basic urban infrastructure, including internal access roads, drainage, water supply \nand sewerage infrastructure, and street lighting. Detailed local area plans (LAPs) were prepared \nfor 10 areas of Thimphu\u2014five in the north and five in the south. These areas were successfully \ndeveloped with the support of ADB and the World Bank.10 \n \n5. \nIn December 2006, ADB approved the provision of $24.6 million in funding for the Urban \nInfrastructure  Development  Project 11 to  improve  access  roads,  drainage,  water  supply,  and \nsanitation in four LAP areas (Babesa, Changbandu, Lungtenpu, and Simtokha) near the existing \nin  South  Thimphu. 12  This  stimulated  the  city\u2019s \nTashi  Chhodzong\u2013Babesa  Expressway \nsystematic expansion, especially housing and commercial development. To date, 532 structures \nhousing an estimated 19,000 persons (approximately 16% of Thimphu\u2019s population) have been \ndeveloped  in  these  four  areas,  significantly  increasing  the  amount  of  available  housing  in  the \ncity. A significant number of businesses are also now operating in these four LAP areas. \n \n6. \nThe  total  number  of  vehicles  in  the  country  has  increased  rapidly,  yielding  an  average \nannual growth rate of 11% from 1997 to 2012. Most of this growth occurred in Thimphu where, \nafter  slowing  briefly  during  2012\u20132014, 13 the  growth  rate  increased  by  5.2%  from  2015  to \n2016,14 This is putting significant stress on Thimphu\u2019s road infrastructure. The LAP was a rare \nsuccessful  example  of  a  land-pooling  scheme  in  the  developing  world;  however,  this  planned \nurbanization caused an unprecedented construction boom that has severely damaged the road \ninfrastructure  in  several  parts  of  the  city,  particularly  the  LAP  areas  in  the  south.  Thimphu\u2019s \nroads were designed for normal traffic conditions, and the influx of heavy construction vehicles \non residential and commercial streets has caused damage that cannot be repaired or restored \nby  routine  maintenance.  At  the  same  time,  a  rapid  increase  in  vehicular  traffic  is  creating \ncongestion, which is further aggravated by deteriorating road conditions. \n \n7. \nSeveral  sections  of  the  city\u2019s  roads  are  riddled  with  potholes  and  suffer  from \nwaterlogging  due  to  poor  drainage.  The  government  has  identified  road  repairs  and \nimprovements in Thimphu as its top priority, with road safety and traffic management as its key \nconcerns.  Addressing  these  issues  will  be  crucial  to  maintain  the  significant  benefits  of  the \nLAP\u2019s  successful  implementation  and  enable  this  strategy  to  be  widely  and  continuously \nreplicated in the future. Thus, the government has requested ADB support to prepare a project \nto address these key issues urgently. The project will ensure sustainable urban development in \nThimphu based on the Thimphu Structure Plan and the LAPs. \n \n8. \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  plans  and  strategies,  and  with  the \ninclusive social development objective of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Bhutan, which \n\n                                                \n10 Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Transport  (Urban  Roads  and  Traffic  Management)  (accessible  from  the  list  of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n11 ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical \nAssistance  Grant  to  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  for  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  Project.  Manila  (Loan  2258-\nBHU). \n\n12 The project constructed (i) 33.7 km of secondary and tertiary access roads with associated drainage to connect the \nfour local areas integrally to the expressway and major arterial roads; (ii)  a 31.6 km network of water distribution \npipes;  (iii)  a  28.5  km  sewerage  network,  including  819  manhole  chambers,  1,411  water  and  sewer  inspection \nchambers, and associated structures; and (iv) 25.7 km of ducting for power and telecommunication networks, with \n265 access shafts for cables and associated structures. \n\n13 To  curb  the  rapid  increase  in  the  number  of  vehicles,  the  government  raised  the  vehicle  tax  rate  in  2011  and \ntemporarily prohibited all vehicle importation from May 2012; this was lifted in July 2014 when the vehicle tax rate \nwas raised further. \n\n14 Source: Ministry of Information and Communication. The number of vehicles in Thimphu  increased by 6.6% from \n\nApril 2014 to April 2015, and by 5.2% from April 2015 to April 2016. \n\n\faims  to  improve  urban  infrastructure  and  services,  upgrade  city  planning,  and  strengthen  the \nplanning and management functions of municipalities.15 It is also consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm \nReview  of  Strategy  2020  as  it  contributes  to  the  envisaged  outcomes  of  environmentally \nsustainable  development  and  the  development  of  urban  infrastructure,  two  of  ADB\u2019s  five  core \nareas of specialization.16 Lessons learned from past and ongoing urban projects and the country \nassistance  program  evaluation  have  been  incorporated  into  the  project  design.  These  include \n(i) remaining  involved  in  the  sector  to  build  the  capacity  of  municipalities,  (ii)  meeting  the \nmunicipal  service  requirements  of  rapidly  growing  urban  populations,  and  (iii)  strengthening \nmunicipalities\u2019 technical capacity to manage O&M. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact will be improved mobility of residents in Thimphu Thromde, aligned with the \n9. \nThimphu  Structure  Plan.  The  outcome  will  be  safety  and  efficiency  of  the  road  network  in \nThimphu Thromde improved. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10. \nThe project\u2019s outputs will include (i) the repair, resurfacing, and improvement of roads in \nThimphu  Thromde,  with  existing  drains  and  footpaths  repaired,  new  drains  constructed,  new \nfootpaths constructed  along the  designated roads,  and existing  parking  spaces  improved;  and \n(ii) municipality\u2019s capacity for asset management and O&M strengthened. The output details are \nin Appendix 1: Design and Monitoring Framework. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nOutput  1:  Repair,  resurfacing,  and  improvement  of  roads  in  Thimphu \nThromde  completed.  The  project  will  improve  32.99  kilometers  (km)  of  urban \nroads,  involving  the  construction  of  9.15  km  of  drainage  and  4.83  km  of \nfootpaths,  by  2018.  The  project  will  also  widen  3.54  km  of  urban  roads  and \nimprove  4,239  square  meters  of  parking  space.  The  road  improvements  will \ncover the southern and northern LAPs, and city center of Thimphu. \nOutput  2:  Municipality\u2019s  capacity  for  asset  management  and  O&M \nstrengthened.  The  project  will  support  capacity  building  to  award  contracts \neffectively  and  meet  contract  completion  targets  on  time.  The  project  will  also \ntrain  10\u201315  key  staff  (at  least  30%  women)  in  project  planning,  design, \nconstruction, asset management, O&M, road safety, and traffic management. \n\n \nD. \n \n11. \n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $5.11 million (Table 1). \n\n                                                \n15 ADB. 2014.

The  first \npackage will have four lots to be procured in parallel for advance contracting,20 and the second \npackage will be bid out promptly afterwards. Contract awards are expected around the time of \ngrant  effectiveness.  To  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the  facilities  to  be  repaired  and  improved, \ncontracts  with  extended  defects  liability  periods  and  performance-based  remuneration  will  be \nadopted,  while  in-house  staff  capacity  will  be  strengthened  through  relevant  training.  The \nimplementation unit will coordinate with various departments of Thimphu Thromde and relevant \npublic utilities to minimize the re-digging of roads for various underground utilities. \n \n\n                                                \n20 The four lots in the first package correspond to the geographic locations of civil works within the city. Bidders will \nbe allowed to bid for one, two, three, or all four lots. Any bidder who wishes to bid for more than one lot is required \nto declare his or her (conditionally discounted) prices for each and every possible combination of lot awards. This \nprocess is expected to attract larger contractors to bid for multiple lots. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nThe project management and implementation units have sufficient experience with, and \n16. \nestablished  procedures  for,  road  repair,  resurfacing,  and  improvement  of  civil  works.  The \nengineering  designs  and  specifications for  road  repairs,  footpaths,  and  drainage  infrastructure \nhave  been  carefully  reviewed  to  ensure  their  cost  effectiveness,  technical  soundness, \nappropriateness  for  the  local  climate  and  topography,  and  road  safety.  Improved  road \ninfrastructure  asset management  and the stricter  regulation of  heavy  construction  vehicles  will \nalso be pursued under the project. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n17. \nThe  project\u2019s  economic and financial  viability  and sustainability  have been  assessed  in \naccordance  with  the  relevant  ADB  guidelines,  including  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic \nAnalysis of Projects and Key Areas of Economic Analysis of Investment Projects.21 By repairing \nand  resurfacing  relevant  road  sections,  the  project  will  reduce  road  users\u2019  travel  time  and \nvehicle operating costs. The project\u2019s economic internal rate of return is estimated at 19.2%. A \nsensitivity analysis showed that the project would remain economically viable in the event of a \n10%  increase  in  costs,  10%  reduction  in  benefits,  or  a  50%  decrease  in  fuel  costs.  In  the \nunlikely  event  of  a  simultaneous  10%  cost  increase  and  10%  benefit  reduction,  the  economic \ninternal rate of return would be 16%, which still exceeds the 12% benchmark.22 \n \nThe  financial  sustainability  of  recurrent  O&M  costs  was  assessed  for  the  project  as  a \n18. \nwhole.  After  project  completion,  annual  recurrent  O&M  costs  for  the  improved  roads  are \nestimated  to  account  for  1.5%  of  Thimphu  Thromde's  current  annual  expenditure  (Nu138.3 \nmillion  in  FY2015).  In  light  of  the  actual  budget  and  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to  provide \nadequate  funds  for  road  maintenance  under  the  Eleventh  Five  Year  Plan,  it  is  reasonable  to \nexpect  that  funds  will  be  available  to  meet  the  O&M  costs. 23  Thimphu  Thromde's  budget \nincreased  significantly  from  Nu88.1  million  in  FY2012  to  Nu138.3  million  in  FY2015,  and  the \nfinancial  analysis  indicated  that  Thimphu  Thromde  will  have  net  surpluses  throughout  the \nanalysis  period  after  project  completion.  This  will  enable  it  to  allocate  adequate  resources  for \nthe regular O&M of the assets repaired and created with the project\u2019s support. Historically, the \ngovernment has consistently provided Thimphu Thromde with yearly budget support and, as the \ngovernment has prioritized this project, it is expected to continue to do so. The government has \ncommitted  to  provide  adequate  road  maintenance  funds  under  the  plan.  Contracts  with \nextended defects liability periods and performance-based remuneration will also be adopted to \nensure the  sustainability  of the  repaired  and  improved  facilities  (para.  15). The  proposed  road \nimprovements  are  expected  to  decrease  the  road  maintenance  budget  substantially  as  a \nproportion  of  Thimphu  Thromde\u2019s  overall  expenditure.  Due  to  these  factors,  the  repaired  and \nimproved facilities will likely be sustainable. \n \n\n                                                \n21 ADB. 1997.

The overall financial management risk is moderate. An \nassessment of Thimphu Thromde\u2019s financial projections indicates that the municipality would be \nable to allocate adequate resources for the O&M of the improved infrastructure. \n \n20. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe project\u2019s poverty reduction, social effects, and gender impacts have been assessed, \n21. \nand relevant documents, including the summary poverty reduction and social strategy, prepared \nthrough  consultations  with  local  residents  and  other  concerned  parties.  The  project  is \ncategorized  as  having  some  gender  elements  and  the  project  design  incorporates  gender-\nresponsive features.25 \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental  impacts  have  been  assessed,  and  documents \n22. \noutlining  necessary  mitigation  measures,  including  environmental  management  plans,  have \nbeen  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  project  is \ncategorized  as  B  for  environment,  C  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  C  for  indigenous \npeoples.26 The  works  under  the  project  are  restricted  to  the  urban  area  of  Thimphu  and  fall \nwithin  existing  right-of-ways.  It  is  therefore  not  expected  to  require  involuntary  resettlement  or \nimpact indigenous people. \n \nThe  project  has  been  classified  as  medium\u2013high  risk  based  on  ADB\u2019s  climate  risk \n23. \nchecklist and preliminary screening.27 The project design incorporates such measures as (i) the \nconstruction  of  roadside  drainage  channels  in  areas  prone  to  flooding  and  waterlogging,  and \n(ii) the use of enhanced road specifications to deal with the increased risk of flooding. In light of \nthis particular risk profile, a further climate risk and vulnerability assessment is underway to help \nassess  the  project\u2019s  particular  vulnerabilities  to  climate  change  impacts  and  propose  feasible \nand appropriate risk-mitigating measures to be incorporated in the detailed engineering design. \nThese  measures  will  help  ensure  the  road  infrastructure\u2019s  climate  resilience  and  robust \noperation  during  extreme  weather  events  induced  by  climate  change.

However,  climate  model  projections  do  not  agree  that \nseasonal precipitation will increase in the project location, indicating a relatively high degree of uncertainty. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nproject\u2019s climate change management response are in the project climate risk assessment and \nmanagement report.28 \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n24. \nThe  project  is  categorized  as  low  risk.  Project  procurement  is  classified  as  category  B \nwith  moderate  procurement  risk,  and  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \noutweigh  the  costs.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.29 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nInadequate public financial \nmanagement system \n\nInadequate staff capacities for \nroad asset management \n\nProject implementation delays \n\nInappropriate technology for \nroad repair \n\nfor \n\nthe \n\nthat \n\nMitigating Measures \nA financial management assessment for the DES of the Ministry of \nWorks and Human Settlement, Thimphu Thromde, and the DPA of \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nthe  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of \nGuidelines \nProjects.a  The  assessment  concludes \nfinancial \nmanagement  systems  of  the  DES,  Thimphu  Thromde,  and  the \nDPA are satisfactory and that the overall risk is medium. The DES \nand Thimphu Thromde are guided by the Government of Bhutan\u2019s \nFinancial  Rules  and  Regulations  2001,  which  are  robust  as \nmeasured against international practices and standards. \nThe  capacity  of  key  staff  will  be  built  through  training  in  project \nplanning,  design,  construction,  asset  management,  O&M,  road \nsafety, and traffic management. \nAlthough  the  Urban  Infrastructure  Project  b is  experiencing  delays \nin  procuring  the  wastewater  treatment  plant  component,  project \nimplementation  delays  are  not  expected  primarily  because  the \nworks \nroutine  and  detailed  designs, \nspecifications, and drawings have already been prepared. At least \n50% of the works are expected to be bid out before the ADB Board \nof Directors  considers the  project. Mobilization delays  will also be \nminor,  as  the  works  are  within  the  capacity  of  local  contractors \n(larger contractors are also welcome to bid). \nBased  on  past  experience,  pavement  thickness  and  type  have \nbeen  selected  to  meet  the  changing  traffic  volume  and  location-\nspecific waterlogging problems. \nThe implementation will be timed for the dry season to prevent the \nmonsoon period from affecting bituminous works. \n\ninvolved  are \n\nlargely \n\nInappropriate timing of \nimplementation \nUncertain financial sustainabilityc  The  works  contracts  will  include  an  extended  3-year  defects \nliability  period,  and  the  grant  agreement  will  include  a  covenant \nrequiring  the  government  to  ensure  that  Thimphu  Thromde \nallocates adequate resources for road infrastructure O&M. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, DES = Department of Engineering Services, DPA = Department of Public Accounts, \nO&M = operation and maintenance. \na  ADB. 2005.
