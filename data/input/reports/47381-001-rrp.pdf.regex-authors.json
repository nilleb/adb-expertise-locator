I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the \nMahaweli Water Security Investment Program.1   \n \n2.  The investment program will accelerate the economic activities of Sri Lanka\u2019s northern \ndry zone region by transferring surplus water of the Mahaweli river basin for irrigation, drinking, \nand commercial purposes.2 It will develop bulk water conveyance and storage infrastructure \nplanned under the North Central Province Canal Program (NCPCP), a high priority development \nprogram of the government that will support completion of the Mahaweli Development Program \n(MDP), which started in 1970.3  \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Sri Lanka has abundant water resources, with annual rainfall of about 1,860 millimeters. \nHowever, the water distribution is skewed over time and space. Most of the rain falls during two \ndistinct monsoons: Maha season from December to February and Yala season from May to \nSeptember.4 The majority falls in the southwest and central highlands, called the wet zone, \nduring both monsoons, with annual rainfall typically exceeding 5,000 millimeters. In comparison, \nthe country\u2019s lowlands are dry\u2014particularly in the northern dry zone region, where annual \nrainfall is less than 1,500 millimeters, and droughts occur regularly. About 6.2 million people live \nin the dry zone region, or about 30% of the total population. Their access to freshwater is only \n1,200 cubic meters (m3) per person per annum.5 This is less than half of the national average of \n2,600 m3 and below the stress threshold of 1,700 m3. Water scarcity in the region is expected to \ndeteriorate because of increasing demand from population growth and a reduction in rainfall \nfrom anticipated climate change. \n      \n4.  Over  the  past  millennia,  local  communities  have  managed  this  water  stress  by \nconstructing many small cascade systems of reservoirs, transfer canals, and irrigation schemes. \nThese have been sufficient to provide supplementary irrigation for a single paddy crop only each \nyear,  and  limited  storage  for  drinking  water  supply.  In  many  places,  communities  rely  on \ngroundwater,  some  of  which  is  contaminated,  causing  high  incidences  of  chronic  kidney \ndisease.  Lack  of  year-round  access  to  water  resources  constrains  the  agricultural  and \ncommercial production of the region, suppressing social and economic development. Agriculture \ncontributes 19% to the local economy and provides livelihoods to 70% of the rural population. \nHowever, in 2012, average household incomes in the northern dry zone were 10% lower than \nother regions.6 \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The northern dry zone region comprises mainly the North Central Province, North Western Province, and Eastern \nProvince.  \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Water Resources \nDevelopment Program (TA 8633-SRI). \n4  These monsoon seasons are synonymous with the two cultivation seasons of Sri Lanka. \n5  This figure represents the annual per capita water endowment\u2014the notional volume of water available each year\u2014\nbased on the accessible and reliable freshwater. \n6  Government of Sri Lanka, Department of Census and Statistics. 2014. Household Income and Expenditure Survey \n\u2013 2012/13. Colombo. This excludes urban areas in the Western Province. ", "2   \n5.  In the 1970s, under the MDP, the government initiated developments to increase water \nwithin these cascade systems using large transfer canals and reservoirs. These initiatives used \navailable water resources from the Mahaweli River, the country\u2019s largest river, which starts in \nthe wet zone and has abundant river flows exceeding the projected future water demand in its \nriver  basin.  Key  components  of  the  MDP  were  finished  by  the  mid-1980s,  but  program \ncompletion was halted as a result of resource constraints and prolonged conflict. Since then, the \ngovernment has updated the MDP, taking into account socioeconomic changes and national \ndevelopment priorities. The government\u2019s latest priorities and investment road map for the \nirrigation  and  water-based  natural resources  management  subsectors are  described  in the \nPublic Investment Strategy, 2014\u20132016.7 These focus on nonphysical and physical investments \nto  ensure  availability  of  adequate  water  quantities.  Agricultural  production  from  irrigation \nsystems  will  be  increased  by  (i)  improving  water  management,  productivity,  and  system \nefficiencies to meet rising demands; (ii) minimizing spatial variations in water availability by \ndeveloping  trans-basin  diversions  to  transfer  available  water  to  dry  zone  areas;  and \n(iii) increasing  resilience  to  climate  change.  Providing  additional  and  clean  drinking  water \nsupplies to dry zone communities is also a key priority.  \n \n6.  These  priorities  will  be  addressed  by  completing  the  NCPCP,  which  comprises \noutstanding MDP components, and is estimated to cost $1.64 billion. The NCPCP will be \nimplemented in two phases. The investment program will finance NCPCP Phase 1, which \nincludes (i) key upstream investments of the NCPCP that will transfer water from the Mahaweli \nRiver to existing reservoirs in the Central Province, North Central Province, and North Western \nProvince; (ii) rehabilitation of an existing irrigation system located in the lower reach of the \nMahaweli River; and (iii) improved water management practices. The investment program also \nsupports preparation of NCPCP Phase 2, which will develop additional transfer canals and \nreservoirs to allow more water to be diverted from the Mahaweli River, and will extend the \nsystem to additional existing reservoirs in the North Central Province. The NCPCP and other \nprograms  supported  by  the  government  and  development  partner  that  improve  associated \ncommand areas and drinking water systems will complement each other.  \n \n7.  The investment program will implement physical investments to address water scarcity, \nfood security, and poverty issues in beneficiary areas by increasing and securing perennial \naccess to water for irrigation and nonagricultural users. Irrigation water conveyed by the new \ninfrastructure will service existing cultivated lands under existing major and minor irrigation \nschemes, to increase annual cropping intensities and minimize drought risk. The investment \nprogram also supports the government in addressing key nonphysical priorities, with a focus on \nimproving water management, system efficiencies, policy, and institutional arrangements.  \n \n8.  The investment program is in line with the government\u2019s development objectives of \nimproving connectivity and service delivery to lagging regions. It also supports the government\u2019s \nsector objectives of attaining food self-sufficiency and increasing water productivity, and is \naligned with the strategic and sector goals of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as articulated \nin ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 and its Midterm Review;8 and the Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 \nto  reduce  the  water  demand\u2013supply  gap  in  water-scarce  areas,  foster  integrated  water \nresources  management,  improve  water  governance  and  delivery  of  services,  and  improve \nresilience to climate change. The sector deviates from the key strategic focus of the current \n                                                \n7  Government of Sri Lanka, Ministry of Finance and Planning. 2013.

The government requested ADB support for developing key components of its sector \ninvestment road map using the MFF modality, as it is suitable for time-sliced financing and \nimplementation of large-scale investment projects. It also provides for a long-term partnership \nbetween ADB and the government for policy dialogue and capacity development, and ensures \ncontinuity in combining investments in physical infrastructure and nonphysical components for \nintegrated  water  resources  management.10 This  helps  the  investment  program  to  observe \nrecommendations from the earlier ADB-financed Water Resources Management Project that \nwas  rated  unsuccessful  because  of  incomplete  implementation  of  sector  reforms.11 The \npreconditions for use of the MFF\u2014a road map and strategy, policy framework, investment and \nfinancing plans, and reliable safeguard arrangements\u2014are all in place.12  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The investment program\u2019s impact will be improved agricultural production and sustained \neconomic growth in the North Central Province, Central Province, North Western Province, and \nEastern Province. Its outcome will be secured access to water resources for agricultural and \ndrinking purposes in project areas.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The outputs of the investment program will be (i) new and improved water conveyance \nand storage infrastructure constructed; (ii) systems for improving water resources management \nand  productivity  developed;  and  (iii) multidisciplinary  investment  program  management \noperational. Each tranche of the MFF finances slices of each output. Output 1 will include the \nfollowing three projects: \n(i)  The Upper Elahera Canal Project comprises two components: (a) the 9 kilometer \n(km) Kalu Ganga\u2013Moragahakanda Transfer Canal, including an 8 km tunnel that \ntransfers water between the Kalu Ganga and Moragahakanda reservoirs that are \nunder  construction;  and  (b) the  Upper  Elahera  Canal  that  connects \nMoragahakanda  Reservoir  to  existing  reservoirs  (Huruluwewa,  Manankattiya, \nEruwewa, and Mahakanadarawa) via 82 km of canals (including a total of 28 km \nof tunnels), which supply existing irrigation and water supply schemes. \n(ii)  The North Western Province Canal Project will construct 96 km of new and \nupgraded canals, including a 940 meter (m) tunnel, and two new 25 m tall earth \ngravity dams, impounding the new Mahakithula and Mahakirula reservoirs. It will \ntransfer  water  from  the  Dambulu  Oya  River  and  the  existing  Nalanda  and \nWemedilla reservoirs to command existing irrigation and water supply reservoirs. \n(iii)  The Minipe Left Bank Canal Rehabilitation Project, located in the downstream \nreaches of the Mahaweli River, will (a) add upstream storage by heightening the \nheadwork\u2019s weir by 3.5 m; (b) construct new intake gates to the left bank canal \nand emergency spill weirs to both left and right bank canals; and (c) rehabilitate \nthe 74 km Minipe Left Bank Canal to improve conveyance and reliability of \nservice to existing farmers.  \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2011.

Manila. \n12  The sector investment road map and policy framework are discussed in the Framework Financing Agreement \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4   \n \n12.  The first tranche of the investment program will implement (i) stage 1 of the Upper \nElahera Canal Project, comprising the first 6.2 km of open canals and associated structures of \nthe Upper Elahera Canal; (ii) stage 1 of the North Western Province Canal Project, comprising \ntwo  new  Mahakithula  and  Mahakirula  reservoirs  and  27  km  of  open  canals  linking  these \nreservoirs with the existing Wemedilla reservoir, and a 940 m tunnel; and (iii) all of the Minipe \nLeft Bank Canal Rehabilitation Project.  \n \n13.  Output  2  will  support  the  key  nonphysical  sector  priorities  through  two  consulting \npackages.  Under  the  first  tranche,  the  study  on  improving  system  efficiencies  and  water \nproductivity will investigate inefficiencies within the existing conveyance and irrigation systems \nand  constraints to  improving  water  productivity,  and recommend  on-farm  and  system-wide \nimprovements. Physical recommendations will be incorporated into civil works packages for \nimplementation under subsequent tranches and potentially under NCPCP Phase 2. The second \nconsulting package, strengthening institutions with integrated water resources management, will \nrecommend programs for modernizing policy and governance frameworks, and institutional \nstrengthening to improve national water resources planning and management, and operational \nand  maintenance  procedures.  Output  3  will  support  program  management  for  successful \ncompletion of the investment program. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n14.  The  cost  of  the  investment  program  is  estimated  at  $675  million  (Table  1).  The \ngovernment has requested an MFF in an amount up to $453 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  and  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund \n[ADF]) to help finance part of the investment program. The MFF will consist of 3 tranches, \nsubject to the government\u2019s submission of related periodic financing requests, execution of the \nrelated loan and project agreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms and conditions \nand undertakings set forth in the framework financing agreement.13 Approval for the second \ntranche is scheduled in 2017 and approval for the third tranche is scheduled in 2018. \n \n15.  The  MFF  combines OCR  and  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF) financing  up to the \naggregate  MFF  amount.  The  provision  of  any  ADF  resources  will  be  balanced  by  a \ncorresponding  reduction  in  available  OCR  financing  (and  vice  versa),  with  total  financing \nprovided under the MFF not to exceed the aggregate MFF total of $453 million equivalent. Any \nADF allocation will be subject to (i) the availability of ADF resources; (ii) Sri Lanka\u2019s access to \nsuch resources pursuant to ADB\u2019s Graduation Policy14 and the requirements of ADF donors; \nand (iii) the availability of such resources to Sri Lanka given ADB\u2019s policy on performance-based \nallocation of ADF resources.15 \n \n16.  The first tranche will be financed, in part, from a loan from ADB\u2019s OCR ($76 million) and \na loan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources ($74 million).16 The OCR loan will have a 26-year \nterm, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \n                                                \n13 Framework Financing Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 ADB. 2008.

DUE DILIGENCE  \nA.  Technical \n18.  Technical due diligence included a comprehensive review and updating of the projects\u2019 \nfeasibility  studies,  and  preparation  of  detailed  designs  and  cost  estimates,  based  on  site \ninvestigations. All aspects of the detailed feasibility studies were examined during the design \nprocess, including (i) confirming that the NCPCP water balance is sufficient in the long term and \nthat the projects avoid adverse downstream impacts to existing users and the environment; \n(ii) considering a range of technical alternatives and their technical and economic viability; \n(iii) assessing the capital and operating costs, and achievable cost savings; (iv) reviewing the \nrationale for the proposed design, specific components, and operational modes; (v) maximizing \nthe  beneficiary  areas  and  communities;  (vi) minimizing  adverse  environmental  and  social ", "    7 \nimpacts;  and  (vii) optimizing  timescales  for  project  implementation.  The  results  from  the \ntechnical evaluations are detailed in (i) a sector analysis and assessment; (ii) a water balance \nassessment; (iii) a climate risk and vulnerability assessment; (iv) individual technical review \nsummaries for the three projects and a specific geotechnical design assessment of the tunnel \nand  dam  components;  (v) an  institutional  and  policy  assessment;  and  (vi) detailed  project \nconstruction cost estimates.  \n \n19.  The investment program is inherently a climate change adaptation measure because it \nwill increase water storage and transfer water from wet to dry areas. However, the infrastructure \ndesigns include additional adaptation measures, such as provision for increased flows in canals \nand  cross-drainage  structures.  The  investment  program  also  includes  soft  components  for \nclimate resilience that will assist (i) irrigation managers to improve system water management; \n(ii) farmers to increase agriculture water productivity; and (iii) the government to improve its \npolicies and institutions based on integrated water resources management principles. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n20.  Economic and financial analyses undertaken for the investment program indicate that \nthe NCPCP is economically viable and financially sustainable. Increased agricultural production \nis the most important quantifiable economic benefit, accounting for about 90% of total benefits. \nOther quantifiable benefits include increased provision of raw water for domestic, municipal, and \nindustrial  uses;  and  increased  hydropower  generation.  The  indirect  benefits  of  induced \neconomic activities and investments by the NCPCP\u2019s upstream water infrastructure were not \nquantified, although expected to be significant. These include broader regional economic growth \nand improved food and political security. The economic internal rate of return is estimated at \n13.1%. The economic internal rate of return is sensitive to changes to the investment cost and \nlevel of project benefits. An 11% increase in total cost or decrease in benefits reduces the \neconomic internal rate of return to 12%, implying the need to monitor factors that may affect the \ncost and benefits.19 The government has committed to financing the operation and maintenance \ncosts and periodical replacement cost of the investment program infrastructures from its own \nresources; these will not exceed 2.3% of the total annual budget of the Ministry of Mahaweli \nDevelopment and Environment (MMDE) and the Department of Irrigation (DOI).20 \n \nC.  Governance \n21.  Financial management and procurement capacity assessments have been undertaken \nfor MMDE; the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka (MASL), an agency under MMDE; and the DOI \nunder the Ministry of Irrigation. MASL and DOI will be responsible for managing, operating, and \nmaintaining the infrastructure after its commissioning. The total annual budget allocation for \nMMDE, MASL, and DOI is over $400 million for capital works. MMDE, MASL, and DOI are \nexperienced in implementing large hydropower and water resources development initiatives. \nThe financial management assessment concludes that MMDE has sufficient experience and \ncapacity to manage the project funds as well as adequate fund flow, accounting, and budgeting \narrangements. The overall pre-mitigation financial management risk and procurement risk are \nboth  rated  substantial.  The  financial  management  and  procurement  arrangements  are \n                                                \n19 Although farmers\u2019 incomes are expected to increase, no revenue will flow directly to MMDE or the Mahaweli \nAuthority of Sri Lanka (MASL) from the project. Accordingly, an assessment of the financial internal rate of return of \nthe project and its comparison against the weighted average cost of capital is not meaningful. An incremental \nrecurrent cost analysis was performed instead to ensure that adequate budget provisions can be made to operate \nand maintain project assets.  \n20 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8   \nconsidered adequate. Improvements required are (i) commitment for adequate counterpart fund \nallocation;  (ii) preparing  a  detailed  procedural  manual,  and  training  in  ADB\u2019s  rules  and \nregulations in disbursement and procurement; and (iii) developing 5-year corporate plans. A \ndetailed financial management action plan is in the facility administration manual (footnote 20). \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the MMDE. The result of the financial management and procurement \ncapacity assessment, and the specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the facility administration manual. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n23.  The investment program will improve socioeconomic conditions in the northern dry zone. \nBy providing secured and increased irrigation water supplies, it will improve the livelihoods of \nmore than 70% of investment program-affected beneficiaries who cultivate land with irregular and \nuncertain irrigation water supplies. Since most paddy lands are cultivated in both Maha and Yala \ncultivation seasons, the rural poor who depend largely on occasional agricultural labor for their \nlivelihood, will benefit from more opportunities to improve their household incomes. By employing \nthe rural poor in construction activities, the investment program will help to reduce rural poverty in \nthe short term. The investment program will supply domestic water to about 358,000 people and \nthereby improve health conditions of people in beneficiary areas, where acute kidney diseases are \nprevalent. It will benefit men and women alike. The investment program will ensure women\u2019s \nparticipation in consultation processes that determine compensation entitlements, and income \ngeneration and improvement programs. During consultations held in investment program-affected \nareas, most respondents stated the investment program will improve their living standards and \nemployment opportunities.  \n \n24.  Contractors will be required to implement appropriate measures regarding the health and \nsafety of men and women who work at the construction sites. Contractors, in close coordination \nwith  the  program  management  unit,  will  conduct  awareness  programs  on  the  prevention  of \nsexually  transmitted  infections,  drug  use,  gender  issues,  and  core  labor  standards.  The \ninvestment program is classified as general intervention, since  it supports poverty reduction \nindirectly. Although tranches 1 and 2 will provide the same opportunities for women to work in the \nconstruction activities as men, they are classified as no gender elements because the activities \nwill be limited to construction of major infrastructure for conveying and storing water. Tranche 3 \ncould be classified as some gender benefits, since investments may improve secondary and \ntertiary distribution systems with farmers\u2019 organizations.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n25.  Involuntary resettlement. The first tranche is categorized B for involuntary resettlement \nimpacts. Land acquisition is required for only the North Western Province Canal Project, and a \nresettlement plan has been prepared. It will require 11.8 hectares of land from 128 households, \nwith 448 project-affected people. Of those, nine households with 27 project-affected people will \nbe physically displaced. The remaining 119 households will lose 2%\u20139% of their lands. All \nphysically displaced households have opted for self-relocation. No land acquisition is required \nfor the Upper Elahera Canal Project or Minipe Left Bank Canal Rehabilitation Project under the \nfirst tranche. A resettlement framework for the investment program has been prepared to guide \nthe formulation of resettlement plans for all tranches. Subsequent tranches are likely to be \ncategorized A for involuntary resettlement. Each tranche will implement comprehensive income \nrestoration and improvement programs for the project-affected people. The investment program ", "    9 \nwill  also  establish  a  project-level  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  resolve  problems  with \ncompensation calculation and payment, resettlement assistance, and income generation and \nimprovement. MMDE has adequate capacity to implement the resettlement plans, as it has \nimplemented several resettlement programs under the MDP.  \n \n26.  Indigenous people. Research and field surveys undertaken during project preparation \nfound that no indigenous people communities or individuals will be affected by the investment \nprogram. Hence, all tranches are category C for indigenous peoples impacts.  \n \n27.  Environment. All tranches of the investment program are categorized A for environment \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Individual  environmental \nassessments have been undertaken for the three projects. Environmental impact assessments \nfor the North Western Province Canal Project  and the Upper Elahera Canal Project, each \ncategorized  A,  and  an  initial  environmental  examination  for  the  Minipe  Left  Bank  Canal \nRehabilitation  Project  were  prepared.  Since  the  investment  program  is  time-sliced  and \nimplementation  of  all  three  projects  will  begin  under  the  first  tranche,  the  environmental \nassessments cover the entire investment program. An environmental assessment and review \nframework has also been developed for the investment program. Stakeholders have been \nconsulted  and  will  continue  to  be  consulted  during  implementation  as  described  in  the \nstakeholder communications strategy. A grievance redress mechanism to address both social \nand environmental issues will be established prior to project implementation. \n \n28.  Based  on  the  findings  of  a  strategic  environment  assessment  undertaken  by  the \ngovernment for the updated MDP, the cumulative impacts on two key areas of biodiversity and \nhydrology were assessed for the investment program and the Kalu Ganga and Moragahakanda \nreservoirs (associated facilities under construction).21 For these combined investments, about \n11,600 hectares of natural habitat (moist semi-evergreen, dry mixed evergreen, and riverine \nforests and scrublands) will be impacted, but the projects under the investment program affect \nonly about 1,100 hectares, or about 0.0005% of the natural habitat available in Sri Lanka. \nSeveral alternative options were considered in designing the canal routes to minimize adverse \nimpacts to communities, biodiversity, and natural resources. The final routes include about \n36 km of tunnels, primarily to minimize impacts to forest and wildlife reserves. Appropriate off-\nset measures have also been included in the investment program, such as compensatory \nplanting of degraded forest areas. The water balance study also demonstrates that downstream \nwater uses and environmental flows will not be impacted by the planned water diversions.   \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n29.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.22 The integrated benefits and impacts of the \ninvestment program are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInherent risks associated  Comprehensive ground investigations have been undertaken during the design \nwith construction of dams  process. A tunnel boring machine will be used to construct the 26 km tunnel, which \nand tunnels  will help expedite implementation and minimize construction risks. The contracts \nfor tunnel construction may also include performance and penalty clauses.

ASSURANCES \n30.  The government and MMDE have assured ADB that implementation of the investment \nprogram shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the facility administration manual and loan documents. \n \n31.  The government and MMDE have given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, which \nare  set  forth  in  the  framework  financing  agreement.  Specific  covenants  agreed  by  the \ngovernment and MMDE with respect to individual tranches under the MFF are set forth in the \nloan and project agreements for the respective tranches.  \n \nV.
