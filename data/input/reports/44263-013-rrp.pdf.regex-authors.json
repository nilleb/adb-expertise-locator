THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Inclusive Financial Sector Development Program, and (ii) a \nproposed policy-based loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for subprogram 1 of the Inclusive \nFinancial  Sector  Development  Program.  The  report  also  describes  the  proposed  technical \nassistance (TA), Implementing the Inclusive Financial Sector Development Program, to support \nprogram implementation, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The  program  represents  a  medium-  to  long-term  partnership  between  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the Government of Cambodia and seeks to improve financial \ninclusion  by  supporting  the  development  of  an  efficient  and  stable  financial  sector.  The \ngovernment\u2019s priority areas include (i) increasing access to finance for rural households, the \nagriculture sector, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); (ii) enhancing financial \nsystem stability; and (iii) upgrading financial sector infrastructure to support the introduction of \nnew financial services and products. The program is included in ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan, 2016\u20132018.2 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The development problem. Cambodia achieved and sustained high economic growth \nat an average of 6% of gross domestic product (GDP) per annum during 2007\u20132015. This \ngrowth supported a dramatic reduction in poverty, with poverty rates declining from 47.8% in \n2007 to 13.5% in 2014. However, economic growth could be more inclusive. Higher poverty \nlevels occur in rural areas (19.9% of the rural population in 2012), where 90.0% of poor people \nlive. In addition, a large share of the population remains vulnerable to poverty, having moved to \njust above the poverty line. In 2011, while only 10% of Cambodians lived on less than $1.25 per \nday (in purchasing power parity), 41% lived on less than $2 per day and 72% lived on less than  \n$3 per day.3 Financial inclusion is seen as one important channel to further reducing households\u2019 \nvulnerability to falling into poverty.4 Expansion of formal financial services and financial literacy \nis expected to address the issues of high transaction costs and overindebtedness of poor \nhouseholds. However, in 2015, a comprehensive financial inclusion study highlighted a major \nproblem of financial exclusion in the country.5 The study estimated that only 59% of the adult \npopulation has access to formal finance\u201468% in urban areas and only 55% in rural areas. \nFurther, the study indicated that 30% of the adult population is excluded from both formal and \ninformal financial services altogether. \n \n \n4.  Cambodia\u2019s banking industry grew rapidly between 2001 and 2015 with total assets at \n$19.9 billion. Credit to the private sector rose from 6.0% of GDP in 2001 to 62.7% of GDP in \n2015 and total deposits reached 58.5% of GDP in 2015 compared with 10.4% of GDP in 2001. \nBetween 2011 and 2015, the number of commercial banks operating in Cambodia increased \nfrom  31  to  36.  Microcredit  has  also  flourished  in  the  same  period  and  the  number  of \nmicrofinance institutions operating in Cambodia grew from 30 in 2011 to 58 in 2015. This \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: Cambodia, 2016\u20132018.

Phnom Penh. \n ", "2 \ndevelopment in the banking industry has been supported by the government\u2019s financial market \nreforms which have been sequenced in an orderly manner since 2001 (para. 11). Unlike the \nsituation in many of its regional peers, majority foreign ownership of financial institutions is \nallowed in Cambodia, the government neither  sets interest rates on loans or deposits nor \nimposes lending quotas or practice directed lending.\n \n \n5.  Despite this impressive growth in the banking industry, lending is fragmented with credit \nreadily available in urban centers while the rural areas remain underserved. The agriculture \nsector and small farmers in particular have been disadvantaged as agriculture-related lending is \nseen as relatively risky. Interest rates are typically higher to cover the risk, which increases the \ncost for the borrower. Additionally, there is a skewed distribution of bank branches which serves \nthe needs of urban rather than rural communities. In 2015, commercial banks had 36% of their \nbranches in Phnom Penh. While 64% are outside of the capital, most are owned by one of the \nleading  commercial  banks  with  a  large  national  network. The  nonbank  financial  subsector \n \n(insurance  and pension funds) is very small and this is also an impediment to the development \nof a more inclusive financial system. An incomplete legal framework for financial products, \nservices, and consumer protection; poor financial literacy among most of the population; and \ninsufficient  financial  infrastructure  (such  as  payments  systems)  have  all  contributed  to  a \nfinancial sector that is not inclusive enough.\n \n \n6.  At the same time, the banking industry is exposed to significant risks. The large number \nof  banks  operating  in  Cambodia,  combined  with  rapid  credit  expansion,  poses  formidable \nchallenges to implementing sound bank supervision. The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) \nestablished  a  prudential  bank  supervision  framework  in  2011  although  continued  capacity \ndevelopment support will be necessary. Cambodia has a highly dollarized economy, meaning \nthat the NBC has limited monetary policy options to manage financial system risks (i.e., limits to \nthe  NBC  as  a  lender  of  last  resort).  The  highly  dollarized  economy  also  impedes  the \ndevelopment of a local currency capital market. The government has been promoting local \ncurrency  through  relatively  small  recurrent  transactions  including  payrolls  and  utility  bills. \nHowever, money markets and government bond markets, which are the building blocks for a \ncapital market, do not yet exist. Local currency bond markets perform an essential function in \nproviding capital market participants with a risk-free yield curve reflecting sovereign credit. This \nyield  curve  provides  fundamental  price  discovery  and  serves  as  the  foundation  for  more \ncomprehensive financial sector development including growth in insurance and pension funds. \nMoreover,  the  introduction  of  more  advanced  products,  such  as  corporate  and  structured \nfinance, infrastructure finance, and eventually hedging mechanisms, is also dependent on the \ndevelopment of a risk-free government yield curve.\n \n \n7.  Binding constraints. The government has recognized the set of challenges it needs to \ndeal with to make the financial sector more inclusive and stable with supporting infrastructure,  \nincluding: (i) access to financial products and services to the poor are limited, (ii) financial sector \nstability  framework  is  weak,  and  (iii)  the  financial  infrastructure  is  underdeveloped.  These \nconstraints are discussed in paras. 8\u201310. \n \n8.  Access  to  financial  products  and  services  to  the  poor  is  limited.  Four  main \nconstraints  on  access  to  finance  need  to  be  addressed:  (i)  financial  literacy  among  the \npopulation is low, (ii) consumer protection from unfair business practices is lacking, (iii) the \nregulatory regime does not promote new financial products and services, and (iv) financing to \nsmall farmers and agriculture, and SMEs is limited. As a start, the financial sector would benefit \nfrom a comprehensive financial inclusion strategy that identifies short-, medium-, and long-term \ninterventions designed to make the financial sector more inclusive and to promote financial \n ", "3 \nliteracy.  Financial  literacy  programs  do  not  exist  in  school  curriculums,  government  public \noutreach programs, or the banking industry itself. There is no consumer protection law,6 which is \ncritical to establishing confidence in the financial sector. The regulatory regime for promoting \nnew financial products and services is insufficient. For example, the insurance law has been \namended  which  has  established  a  framework  for  entry  into  the  sector,  basic  prudential \nstandards, risk-based capital and solvency requirements, and micro insurance. However, the \nimplementing rules and regulations are still being developed. Agriculture financing for farmers \nand rural households is not readily available. The government-owned Rural Development Bank \n(RDB) promotes credit to the agriculture sector, but its financial performance has been poor \nbecause of operational inefficiencies related to lack of staff skills, poor risk management, and a \nlow capital base. The RDB requires restructuring to improve financial performance to increase \ncredit  availability.  The  financial  inclusion  survey  (footnote  5)  reported  that  SMEs  are  also \nunderserved because they are perceived to present higher risk. Therefore, SMEs would benefit \nfrom a market-based partial credit guarantee scheme that would help reduce banks\u2019 commercial \nrisks in lending to such enterprises. \n \n9.  Financial sector stability framework is weak. The government\u2019s primary approach to \nenhancing stability is to build confidence in the domestic financial system and in the use of local \ncurrency. To build confidence, the government is addressing three main constraints: (i) weak \nfinancial  market  coordination  among  key  government  agencies,  (ii)  absence  of  a  deposit \nprotection scheme, and (iii) the lack of a local currency government bond market. While the \nNBC has established a financial stability unit, coordination across key government departments \nand agencies requires strengthening. In particular, a coordination mechanism that includes the \nNBC (bank supervision), the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) (fiscal policy), and the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission of Cambodia (SECC) (capital market) is critical to ensure \nexchange of financial market information and a coordinated response in the event of a financial \ncrisis. With the rapidly expanding bank deposit base there is a need for a deposit protection \nscheme to ensure the continuing participation of depositors. Finally, while it will be a long-term \nchallenge, the development of a local currency government bond market is necessary to provide \nthe government with more effective monetary policy tools to manage financial system risks, and \nto develop a capital market and institutional investor base. \n \n10.  Financial infrastructure is underdeveloped. The infrastructure supporting the financial \nsector has critical gaps that inhibit wider participation by stakeholders and constrain financial \nsector development. Three constraints need to be addressed: (i) the payment system needs to \nbe upgraded, (ii) enabling laws for e-commerce financial services and trust products do not \nexist, and (iii) compliance with the global standards for anti-money laundering needs to be \nstrengthened.  With  support  from  ADB,  the  NBC  has  been  developing  a  payments  and \nsettlement system, and further upgrades will be necessary to ensure that the infrastructure \n(such as for e-payment and mobile remittance) promotes financial inclusion. There is a demand \nfor digital finance and e-commerce infrastructure as part of the solution to connecting the poor \nand rural communities with the financial sector. To allow this to happen, enabling laws on  \ne-commerce  are  necessary.  Enabling  laws  are  also  necessary  to  develop  other  financial \nproducts and services. For example, a trust law would provide critical investment vehicles for \nthe financial system, such as investment trusts. The government has strengthened its anti-\nmoney-laundering protocols and was removed from the grey list by the Financial Action Task \nForce in February 2015. Nevertheless, more needs to be done to achieve full compliance with \n                                                \n6  A consumer protection law sets up a regulatory framework to protect consumers from unfair business practices. To \nenforce the law, a consumer protection agency is normally established. \n ", "4 \nglobal standards so that global counterparties do not otherwise limit the nature and extent of \nfinancial transactions with Cambodian financial institutions. \n  \n11.  The government\u2019s sector strategy. The government has taken a sequenced approach \nto financial sector development. With ADB support, the government developed a series of rolling \nfinancial sector development strategies (FSDSs) covering 2001\u20132025 (figure 1). Beginning in \n2001, reforms focused on rehabilitating the banking industry through liberalizing bank licensing \nand  allowing  foreign  ownership.  The  government  (through  the  NBC)  then  focused  on \nestablishing prudential bank standards and supervision capabilities and developing the financial \nsector infrastructure such as a payments and settlement system. From 2011 to 2015, the NBC \nincreased its focus on developing the microfinance subsector. With continued support from \nADB, the FSDS is currently being updated as the FSDS, 2016\u20132025.7 The objective of the \nstrategy is to develop a sound financial sector that can contribute to poverty reduction by \nsupporting  economic  growth  and  increasing  poor  people\u2019s  access  to  finance.  The  FSDS,  \n2016\u20132025 continues to support the development of the nonbanking subsector and capital \nmarkets,  and  calls  for  the  alignment  of  regulations  and  supervision  practices  towards \ninternational  standards,  the  delivery  of  new  financial  services  and  products,  and  the \nestablishment of a formal crisis management mechanism. A specific emphasis will be placed on \nfinancial inclusion by providing financial products and services to the low-income segment of the \npopulation.  The  government  also  considers  its  commitments  under  the  ASEAN  Economic \nCommunity Blueprint 2015\u20132025 as a catalyst for continued domestic financial market reforms \nand capital market integration. \n \n \n               Figure 1: Asian Development Bank\u2019s Engagements in Financial Sector Development \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Source: ADB staff. \n \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s  experience. ADB has had a long productive engagement with Cambodia in \nsupport  of  financial  sector  development  through  a  series  of  well-sequenced  programmatic \napproaches and policy-based loans and TA, as well as grant projects all aligned with the FSDS \nseries (figure 1).8 Beginning in 2001, the first Financial Sector Program, 2001\u20132005 established \n                                                \n7  ADB provided project preparatory TA under the former name of the Fourth Financial Sector Program. \n8  ADB. 2001.

TA  was  provided  to  the  NBC  to  establish  a  financial \nintelligence unit in the National Bank of Cambodia (CAFIU) to counter money laundering and \nprevent the financing of terrorism. The Third Financial Sector Program, 2011\u20132015 initiated \nADB\u2019s first support to the capital market, and incorporated the recommendations of Cambodia\u2019s \nfirst  Financial  Sector  Assessment  Program.11 ADB  supported  the  eventual  adoption  of  a \nsubdecree  on  bankruptcy  and  a  code  of  corporate  governance  for  listed  companies,  and \nprovided capacity building to staff at the SECC, including scholarships for the certified financial \nanalyst program. To increase investor confidence, a national arbitration center for out-of-court \ndispute resolution was established. \n \n13.  Lessons learned from the experience. Three lessons have been learned during ADB\u2019s \nlong engagement in Cambodia\u2019s financial sector that have helped inform this program. First, \nADB\u2019s  experience  underscores  that  finance  sector  development  is  hierarchical  and  that \nsequencing  of  reforms  matters.  Key  foundation  reforms  to  the  banking  sector  must  be \nsuccessfully  implemented  before  moving  on  to  complex  or  higher  order  reforms  to  the  \nnonbanking sector including government and corporate bonds and capital market development. \nADB support started with the rehabilitation of the banking sector and has gradually expanded its \nassistance  to  nonbanking  sector  and  capital  market  development  and  promoting  financial \ninclusion. Second, government ownership of reforms articulated through a series of FSDSs has \nensured financial sector development is based on well-planned steps, where each step is \nsupported by solid technical inputs, and government consultations with stakeholders to achieve \nbroad support for reforms. For example, ADB support to the development of the payments \nsystem has followed sequenced approach starting with the development of the policy framework \nfollowed by the establishment of the legal regime and then implementation of the payments \nsystem  infrastructure.  Third,  to  make  the  financial  sector  more  inclusive  requires  a \ncomprehensive approach including policy and regulatory reforms to expand the coverage of \nfinancial products and services to the poor, consumer protection, promoting the use of digital \nfinance and e-commerce to connect the poor with the financial sector, and investing in financial \nliteracy of the population. \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s  value  added  to  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  program.  ADB \nprovided direct support to the program, which advances reforms from previous ADB programs \nand TAs (para. 12). For example, ADB will support the establishment of a forum between the \ngovernment and civil society to support the implementation of the National Strategy for Financial \n                                                                                                                                                       \nSector Program II.

Technical assistance will be provided to establish an SME credit guarantee scheme \nand a Depositor\u2019s Protection Scheme. ADB will also support the implementation of the revised \nInsurance Law to promote microinsurance. ADB will continue to support the development of \ndraft laws, including Trust and e-Commerce Laws, and will provide assistance to upgrade the \npayment system.   \n \n15.  Donor coordination. Support to financial sector development is coursed through NBC \nand anchored by the FSDSs. ADB is the lead donor and provides comprehensive support in \ncoordination with a number of bilateral and multilateral donors. Under the FSDSs, the World \nBank  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund  are  providing  support  to  financial  stability  and \ngovernance  issues.  The  Korea  International  Cooperation  Agency  is  providing  targeted \nassistance to capital market development, and in particular the equity market, while the United \nStates is supporting the development of a depositor\u2019s protection scheme. The International \nFinance  Corporation  is  supporting  access  to  finance,  including  secured  transactions.  The \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement has been working to commercialize the agriculture sector \nand is promoting agriculture finance. The United Nations Development Programme has recently \nlaunched a financial inclusion program. ADB staff joined the International Monetary Fund article \nIV mission for the first time in July 2016.  \n \n16.  The programmatic approach and policy-based loans. The use of a programmatic \napproach with policy-based loans providing budget support leverages a long-term policy reform \nprogram.  The  program  will  have  three  subprograms  as  part  of  the  implementation  of  the \nupdated FSDS, 2016\u20132025. The program will first support the completion of a draft national \nstrategy for financial inclusion for rural areas, agriculture, and SME development. The program \nwill then enhance financial stability and confidence, which represents a key prerequisite for \nfinancial inclusion. The program will also support the finalization of draft laws and lay the \nfoundation for strengthening financial system infrastructure. Combined with substantial TA, the \nprogram will also support capacity development for the relevant executing and implementing \nagencies. A medium-term agenda and expected results framework will be used to continue \nADB\u2019s engagement, assess program effectiveness, and provide an eventual pivot into wider \nfinancial inclusion efforts to supplement those of the government. \n \n17.  Economic impact. The program is designed to increase financial inclusion and support \nto expand the financial services. The economic gains from this program will be achieved by  \n(i) capturing efficiency gains in banking through a 2% reduction in net interest spreads and a \nreduction in the cost of credits, and (ii) increasing credit availability to microfinance institutions \nby shifting lending activity from the informal sector to the formal sector (para 29). \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n18.  The impact of the program will be the banking and financial sectors enhanced. The \noutcome will be a growing, resilient, inclusive, and efficient financial system with expanded \ncoverage. The Program will include a series of policy reforms and interventions and is designed \nto deliver three outputs. Subprogram 1 contains 15 policy actions, all of which have been \naccomplished. Subprogram 2 contains 15 policy actions, of which 8 actions are prior expected \nactions (triggers), and subprogram 3 contains 14 policy actions, of which 8 are triggers. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n19.   Output 1: Access to formal financial services to the poor expanded. Output 1 will \npromote wider and more inclusive participation in the financial sector and establish a framework \n ", "7 \nto  ensure  adequate  consumer  protection.

Under subprogram 2, the government will establish a joint financial stability technical \ngroup  and update its public debt management strategy 2019\u20132023 to incorporate the potential  \nissuance of government debt securities. Implementation plans for a DPS and the introduction of \nmicroinsurance will also be completed. Under subprogram 3, the government will establish a \nnational financial stability committee and complete a draft law to anchor the establishment of a \nDPS. The government will authorize and license microinsurance operators and will formulate a \nplan to develop a government debt market. \n \n23.  Output 3: Financial sector infrastructure upgraded. Output 3 will support the wider \ndevelopment of the financial sector by upgrading financial infrastructure and encouraging the \ndevelopment  of  a  wider  array  of  financial  products  and  services.  Accomplishments  under \nsubprogram 1 included: (i) the government launched \u201cfast payment\u201d as an alternative retail \nchannel for local currency fund transfer, (ii) the draft Comprehensive Trust Law was finalized \nand authorization was obtained to establish an e-Commerce Law, and (iii) coverage of the credit \ninformation database was expanded. \n \n24.

New financial products will be created under the trust scheme to enhance resource \nmobilization and the government will achieve full compliance with the Financial Action Task \nForce standards. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n25.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  \nSDR28,529,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance subprogram 1. The loan \nwill have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as \nset forth in the draft loan agreement. ADB will retain the right to audit the use of the loan \nproceeds and to verify the accuracy of withdrawal application certification. The closing date of \nthe loan is 30 June 2017, by which date all proceeds of the loan will have been fully disbursed. \nThe loan for subprogram 1 will be withdrawn in a single tranche upon loan effectiveness. The \nproceeds of the loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2015, as amended from time to time). \n \n26.  The size of the program is based on (i) the government\u2019s development financing needs \nas identified during country programming and strategy formulation, (ii) the development impact \nof the policy reform package, and (iii) the development spending arising from the reform The \n. \ngovernment will support the reforms through budget allocations such as recapitalization of the \nRDB,  and  upgrading  bank payment  and  settlement  system. In  2016,  the  budget  deficit  is \nexpected  to  be  $843  million,  or  4.3%  of  GDP,  and  will  be  financed  primarily  by  official \ndevelopment assistance. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n27.  The  NBC  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  MEF,  MOC,  and  SECC  will  be  the \nimplementing agencies. A financial sector steering committee, chaired by the governor of the \nNBC with implementing agencies as members, will oversee the implementation of the program. \nThe steering committee will be supported by a technical working group, also chaired by the \nNBC. The implementation period of subprogram 1 is from 30 June 2014 to 30 June 2016, \nsubprogram 2 implementation is from 30 June 2016 to 30 June 2018, and for subprogram 3, \nimplementation is from 30 June 2018 to 30 June 2020. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n28.  In response  to the government\u2019s request,  ADB  has  prepared the  Implementing  the \nInclusive Financial Sector Development Program TA to support the implementation of key policy \ntriggers under subprogram 2, as well as provide the government with timely policy advice on \ndemand. The TA is estimated to cost $0.68 million, of which $0.60 million will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The implementing agencies \n(MEF, MOC, NBC, and SECC) will provide counterpart support in the form of office space, \ncounterpart staff, support facilities, and other in-kind contributions. A total of 23 person-months \nof consulting inputs are required (15 international and 8 national). ADB will engage a firm on a \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  basis  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time) using a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. The NBC \nwill be the executing agency of the TA, and the MEF, MOC, and SECC will be the implementing \nagencies with implementation period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019. \n ", "9 \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n29.   The results of the PIA indicate that the program could produce potential gains to the \neconomy amounting to $391.2 million annually or 2.3% of GDP. These gains arise primarily \nfrom two channels. First, the program will increase the average annual volume of banking loans \nwhich, when combined with the expected reduction in interest margins, will add $230.1 million to \nGDP annually. In addition, reforms under the program will help reduce interest margins in the \nmicrofinance  sector  by  at  least  by  6.0%  which,  along  with  increased  lending  and  deposit \nmobilization, will shift borrowers out of more expensive informal lending schemes. This channel \ncould add as much as $161.1 million to GDP annually. These estimates ignore potentially \nlarger, second-round effects such as increased investment arising from increased mobilization \nof savings and the lower cost of capital, and increased employment within and outside of the \nsector. The benefits from the proposed reforms exceeded the investment costs of $140 million \nand the recurrent costs of $5 million.  \n \nB.  Governance \n \n30.  A  review  of the  country\u2019s  public  financial  management systems  was  carried  out  to \nunderstand fiduciary risks and determine appropriate fiduciary arrangements. Implementation of \npublic financial management reforms, through the implementation of financial management \ninformation  systems  at  the  MEF,  has  strengthened  budget  credibility  and  financial \naccountability. 12  The  assessment  also  considered  ADB\u2019s  report  on  Cambodia\u2019s  country \ngovernance risk assessment and risk management plan,13 and the public expenditure financial \naccountability  report.14 Nonetheless,  there  is  a  risk  that  the  government  commitment  is \ninsufficient to support successful and sustainable reforms.  \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  NBC.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, the government will continue its efforts to institute, maintain, \nand  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following  international  best  practices  on \nissues such as corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n32.  The program is categorized as a general intervention to support sustainable economic \ngrowth and it is expected to indirectly contribute to poverty reduction. Further, the promotion of \ninclusive finance facilitated by financial sector development expands the outreach of affordable \nformal financial services to poor and rural microenterprises, and so has direct impacts on \npoverty reduction. Subprogram 1 is categorized as having some gender elements. Financial \nsector reforms based on market principles are typically gender neutral. However, the program \nhas improved access to financial services, bringing more benefits to women in rural areas.  \n \n \n                                                \n12  External Advisory Panel. 2015.

In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified \ncategory C for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n34.  The  program  is  exposed  to  broad  national  and  macroeconomic  risks  and  risks \nassociated with public financial management and corruption, and mitigation measures are in \nplace to tackle these risks. 15 Program-level or contextual risks include maintaining coordination \nacross government, properly sequencing and executing complex reforms, managing the legal \nreforms, and capacity constraints to regulators. These risks are managed through program \ndesign and the utilization of TA. A comprehensive discussion of program risks and mitigating \nmeasures is contained in the risk assessment and risk management plan.16 With the design \nsafeguards, the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh any costs. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n35.  The government and the NBC have assured ADB that implementation of the program \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the loan agreement. No disbursement shall be made unless ADB is \nsatisfied that the government has completed the policy actions specified in the policy matrix \nrelating to the program. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n36.  I am satisfied that the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based loan would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n(i)  the  programmatic  approach  for  the  Inclusive  Financial  Sector  Development \nProgram, and \n(ii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR28,529,000 to the Kingdom of \nCambodia  for  subprogram  1  of  the  Inclusive  Financial  Sector  Development \nProgram, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate \nof 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a \nterm of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n26 October 2016 \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2016.
