Environmental assessment of the policy matrix was undertaken \nand is available as a supplementary appendix. \n \nSindh\u2019s  social \nits  economic \nindicators  have  remained  well  behind \nperformance,  with  high  levels  of  illiteracy,  malnutrition  and  mortality.  The \npoor  social  status  has  a  major  impact  on  its  economy,  environment,  and \nwater resources; and are directly linked to the poverty and gender complex \nthat  needs  to  be  addressed.  Public  social  services\u2014education,  health, \nnutrition,  population  welfare,  and  water  and  sanitation\u2014are  run-down, \nprimarily  due  to  chronic  problems  in  governance,  capacity,  and  financing. \nThe  Social  Action  Program  (1992\u20132002)  had  mixed  results  due  to  the \nprevailing  economic  problems  of  the  1990s,  the  time  it  took  to  generate \ncommitment for social services, and the lack of focus on service delivery and \nrelated governance.    \n \nIn the past 3 years, a policy framework has been put in place comprising the \nPoverty Reduction Strategy and Program, the  Local Government Ordinance, \nsector  specific  policies  and  program,  and  the  Sindh  Reform  Program.  The \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  supporting  administrative  and  fiscal \ndevolution  through  the  Decentralization  Support  Program,  while  the  Access \nto Justice Program supports legal and judiciary reforms. The Sindh  Reform \nProgram  is  addressing  macro  financial  and  administrative  issues  with  the \nsupport  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Structural  Adjustment  Credit.  The  Sindh \nProvincial Government (SPG) is committed to poverty reduction, devolution, \nand  social  sector  development  toward  the  Millennium  Development  Goals, \nand  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  program  support  for  devolved  social \nservices  in  the  province.  Pakistan\u2019s  devolution  provides  a  window  of \nopportunities \nInitial \nimprovements have been noted and local bodies are eager to move ahead. \nHowever, they need both technical and financial support to do so. The Local \nGovernment  Ordinance  supports  greater  involvement  of  community-based \norganizations  (CBOs),  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  the \nprivate  sector.  These  have  become  important  forces  in  social  services \nexpansion,  and  the  transition  provides  a  unique  opportunity  to  develop \npartnerships. The proposed approach\u2014flexible support to local governments \nto  carry  out  their  own  agenda  based  on  certain  terms  and  conditions  to \nensure accountability and maximize benefits for the poor\u2014reflects the major \nthrust that emerged from the participatory planning process undertaken.   \n\nthe  social  services. \n\nto  undertake \n\nreforms \n\nin \n\n\f \n\nObjectives and \nScope \n\niii \n\nThe  overall  goal  of  the  DSSP  is  to  improve people\u2019s education and health, \nthereby  helping  to  reduce  poverty  and  gender  imbalances.  The  broad \npurpose is to increase school enrolment, and coverage with health and clear \nwater and sanitation services. These objectives are to be primarily achieved \nby improving governance and financing of social services; that should result \nin increased  access  to  basic  social  services,  in  particular  for  women;  and \nimproved quality, efficiency, affordability and sustainability of services.  \n \nThe  Program  has  5  principal  policy  outcomes,  namely,  to  (i)  further \nadministrative  devolution  of  social  services,  (ii)  improve  social  sector \nfinancing  and  flow  of  funds,  (iii)  promote  participation,  linkages,  and  public \naccountability,  (iv)  rationalize  services  and  set  minimum  standards, and (v) \nencourage public-private partnership.  \n \nThe  DSSP  covers  all  16  districts  and  102 \ntaluka/town  municipal \nadministrations  (TMAs)  of  Sindh  for  a  time  slice  of  3  years  for  the  program \nloans and 4 years for the TA loan.  \n \nIn  the  education  sector,  SPG  will  expand  support  to  school  management \ncommittees of schools up to class 12 to improve and operate these schools; \nand  provide  additional  assistance  for  rehabilitating  schools,  constructing \nfacilities  for  functioning  but  shelterless  schools,  home  schools  for  girls, \ntextbooks, stipends for girls, and contracting local female teachers on merit.  \n \nIn the health, nutrition and population welfare sector, SPG will promote the \nbasic  package  of  health  services,  contract  female  staff,  support  the \nestablishment  of  health  board  and  patients  associations  to  improve  the \nmaintenance  and  operations  of  health  facilities,  and  introduce  financial \nreforms to improve the quality, affordability, and continuity of health services.  \n   \nIn  the  drinking  water  and  sanitation  sector,  SPG  will  build  the  capacity  of \nTMAs to conduct infrastructure and consumer surveys and develop master \nplans; develop interim policies for drinking water, sanitation, and solid waste \nmanagement;  and  improve  basic  water  and  sanitation  services  through \npartnership with communities.  \n \nSPG proposes five areas of policy actions focusing on good governance.   \n \nFirst,  as  per  Sindh\u2019s  Local  Governance  Ordinance,  SPG  plans  further \ndevolution  of  administrative  and  financial  powers  to  local  governments \n(LGs), including preparation of the annual development program, personnel \nmanagement,  and  financial  authority.  It  also  plans  to  strengthen  delegation \nwithin  the  local  governments  and  adjust  the  roles  of  provincial  line \ndepartments toward providing policy, monitoring and technical support. \n\n \n\nSecond, SPG proposes to increase social sector financing above the normal \nsocial  sector  share  of  total  revenues;  use  a  needs-based,  transparent \nformula  for  distributing  conditional  grants  for  social  sector  development; \nimprove the flow of funds; and improve financial management.   \n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nProgram Loan \nAmounts and \nTerms \n\n      \n\nThird,  SPG  proposes  to  improve  participation  and  accountability  by \nencouraging participatory planning in LGs, implementing the Gender Reform \nAction  Plan,  improving  public  information,  and  adopting  the  mechanism of \nmanagement  agreements  between  the  provincial  government  and  LGs \nspelling out the terms and conditions for grant support to LGs to ensure that \nfunds are well used while maintaining flexibility in the use of funds. \n \nFourth,  SPG  proposes  pro-poor  rationalization  of  services  and  setting \nminimum  standards,  using  the  annual  planning  cycle  and  access  to  grants \nfor  LG  plans.  It  proposes  restrictions  on  new  construction,  selective \nrecruitment of female staff, a minimal set of interventions to be considered in \nall plans, support of CBOs, and proper planning and monitoring procedures. \nSPG line departments will lead studies on sector policy reforms.  \n \nFifth,  SPG  proposes  financial  and  technical  support  for  CBOs  in  operating \nand  maintaining  social  services,  particularly  expanding  support  for  school \nmanagement  committees  in  all  schools,  but  also  encouraging  similar \ndevelopments in the health and water and sanitation sectors. \n \nThe  adjustment  and  other  costs  of  the  policy  and  institutional  reforms \naddressed  by  the  program  loans  are  estimated  to  be  at  least  $255  million \nequivalent.  \n \nSPG  has  requested  two  program  loans  equivalent  to  $210  million  to \nsupported  the  proposed  program  as  indicated  in  the  development  policy \nletter. The first, second, and third tranches, equivalent to, respectively, $100 \nmillion,  $70  million  and  $40  million,  will  be  made  available  upon  compliance \nwith tranche release conditions following loan effectiveness.     \n \nA  program  loan  is  proposed  in  an  amount  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing \nRights  69,843,000  (equivalent  to  $100  million)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources,  with  a  maturity  of  24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years; \ninterest of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft Loan and Program \nAgreements.  \n \nA  second  program  loan  is  proposed  in  an  amount  of  \u00a511,968,550,000  \n(equivalent  to  $110  million)  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  a \nterm  of  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  interest  to  be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility; and such other terms and conditions as set \nforth in the draft Loan and Program Agreements.     \n \n\nProgram Period   The program period will be from 1 February 2004 to 1 February 2007.  \n\nExecuting \nAgency \n \n\n \nThe Finance Department, SPG  \n \n\n\f \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nProcurement, \nDisbursement, \nand Counterpart \nFunds  \n\n \nThe Technical \nAssistance Loan \n\n \nCost Estimates \nand Financing \nPlan \n\n \nLoan Amount \nand Terms \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nExecuting \nAgency  \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \nunder the TA \n\n \n\nv\n\nto  ADB, \n\nto  support \n\nA steering committee representing relevant provincial departments, LGs, and \ncivil society will be established. The program support unit (PSU) and 16 local \nsupport  units  (LSUs)  financed  under  the  program  will  assist  with  planning, \ncoordinating, and monitoring the policy reform and development activities.  \n \nThe proceeds of the loan will finance the foreign exchange costs (excluding \nlocal  taxes  and  duties)  of  eligible  items  produced  in  and  procured  from \nADB\u2019s  member  countries.  The  Government  will  use  counterpart  funds  in \naccordance  with  arrangements  satisfactory \nthe \ndevelopment and reform of devolved social services in Sindh and adjustment \ncosts  associated  with  the  Program,  including  increased  costs  of  devolved \nadministration and rehabilitation of social services, and up-front financing of \nLGs and CBOs.    \n \nSPG  has  also  requested  for  a  TA  project  to  help  (i)  strengthen  sector  and \nprogram  management  and  monitoring,  (ii)  build  the  capacity  of  LGs  and \nCBOs in social sector governance and development, and (iii) support policy \nreforms.   \n \nThe TA is estimated to cost $14.2 million equivalent, comprising $1.9 million \nin foreign exchange and $12.3 million equivalent in local currency cost. ADB \nwill  finance  the  equivalent  of  $10  million,  and  the  Government  will  finance \n$4.2 million equivalent of the TA cost.   \n \nThe TA loan is proposed in an amount equivalent to Special Drawing Rights \n6,984,000  (equivalent  to  $10  million)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds resources, \nwith  a  maturity  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  interest  of \n1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter; and such other \nterms and conditions as set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements.  \n \nFrom 1 February 2004 to 1 February 2008  \n \n \nThe Finance Department, SPG  \n \n \nThe  TA  will  also  be  guided  by  the  steering  committee  established  for  the \nProgram,  and  will  primarily  support  program  implementation,  capacity \nbuilding and reforms through the PSU, 16 LSUs, and 3 line departments.   \n \nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  for  the  TA  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  Contract  packages  valued  for  $500,000 \nequivalent  or  less  will  follow  international  shopping  procedures,  except  for \nvehicles,  which  may  be  procured  through  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB). \nMinor  packages  costing  $100,000  equivalent  or  less  may  be  procured \nthrough LCB or direct purchase.  \n \n\n\fvi \n\nConsulting \nServices under \nthe TA \n\nProgram Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nSafeguards \n\n      \n\nthrough \n\nThe TA will provide a total of 36 person months of international and 1,926 of \ndomestic consulting services according to ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging \ndomestic  consultants.  The  international  consultant  will  be  a  governance \nspecialist. Domestic consultants include experts on finance and governance, \npoverty and gender, capacity building and training, community organization, \ncontracting  and  personnel  management,  engineering,  environment, \neconomics, sector reform, and monitoring and evaluation. The majority of the \nconsultants  will  be  district-based  and  recruited \nfirms.  The \nconsultants  for  the  PSU  and  line  departments  will  be  recruited  either  as \nindividuals or through firms.   \n \nThe  main  beneficiaries  of  the  DSSP  will  be  the  rural  and  urban  poor, \nparticularly  women  and  girls.  Special  attention  will  be  given  to  vulnerable \ngroups such as child laborers.  \n \nSindh\u2019s political instability, and therefore sustained commitment to the reform \nagenda,  is  considered  a  major  risk  for  the  Program.  This  is  to  be  mitigated \nby  generating  broad  public  support  and  institutionalizing  the  devolution \nreforms.  The  economic  and  financial  risks  are  considered  less  prominent \ngiven Pakistan\u2019s overall international and economic performance in the past \nfew  years,  but  depend  on  a  benign  external  environment  for  debt  servicing \nand  investment.  A  third  risk  is  the  limited  capacity  of  LGs.  Major  capacity-\nbuilding  efforts  that  will  benefit  the  social  sector  are  underway,  but  specific \nsupport for capacity building in the devolved social sector is largely lacking. \nIn particular the capacity of CBOs, and among these the health boards,  is of \nconcern. Lastly, the serious levels of poverty in rural areas and urban slums, \nin  combination  with  social  inequity,  pose  major  program  constraints.  A \nsustained  effort  will  be  needed  beyond  the  program  period  to  consolidate \nreforms.                \n\n \n \n \n\n\f\fI.  \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on: (i) two proposed \nprogram loans, and (ii) a proposed technical assistance loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan \nfor the Sindh Devolved Social Services Program (DSSP). \n \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT  \n \n\n \n\n2. \nPakistan\u2019s  economic  growth  of  about  6%  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  before  the \n1990s was largely based on external capital inflows, resulting in major structural imbalances in \npublic finance.1 In the 1990s, the country\u2019s rapid accumulation of debts resulted in serious fiscal \nconstraints and deterioration of social indicators despite efforts under the Social Action Program \n(SAP).  Since  2000,  however,  the  fiscal  balance  and  other  indicators  of  the  economy  have \nimproved dramatically. Because of macroeconomic stabilization, and economic and governance \nreforms  pursued  by  the  Government  of  Pakistan  (Government)  in  the  preceding  3  years,  and \nsome  developments  after  11  September  2001  key  macroeconomic  fundamentals  during \nFY2003 were much better than at any other time in the past decade. Despite this strong growth2 \nand  improvements  in  other  key  macroeconomic  indicators  such  as  inflation,  fiscal  deficits, \nexports,  and  reserve  holdings,  investment  failed  to  pick  up  due  partly  to  excess  capacity  in \nmany  industries  and  a  wait-and-see  attitude  of  investors  in  an  environment  of  political \nuncertainty.  Fixed  capital  accumulation  is  expected  to  pick  up  once  the  excess  capacity  is \nexhausted  and  if  economic  recovery  is  sustained.3 Economic  growth  will  depend  on  regional \nand  political  stability,  a  benign  external  environment  for  debt  servicing  and  investment,  and \nprogress  in  the  reform  and  development  agenda  under  the  new  political  and  administrative \nsetup after devolution.4   \n \n3. \nWhile the Government is on a fast track toward economic recovery and debt reduction, \nits tax reforms are slow. The situation causes pressure on public sector funding to implement \nthe  commitments  made  at  the  Pakistan  Development  Forum  and  threatens to undermine two \nmajor initiatives: (i) the Poverty Reduction Strategy and Program (PRSP), and (ii) the devolution \nprogram.  These  initiatives  are  expected  to  help  Pakistan  move  toward  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs); they also require major additional resources for pro-poor services, \nand administrative costs and up-front financing of local governments (LGs). Poverty reduction is \nthe key objective of the Government's economic policies.5 Under its poverty reduction strategy \nthe Government is committed to increasing poverty reducing public expenditure as a percentage \nof  GDP,  including  in  the  education,  health,  drinking  water  supply,  and  sanitation  sectors  by \nabout  15%  each  year.  Pro-poor  expenditure  incurred  in  FY2003  showed  a  sharp  increase  of \nnearly  30%  compared  with  that  in  FY2002,  but  fell  short  of  its  target  of  PRs161  billion.  As  a \npercentage of the annual GDP, the pro-poor expenditure increased from about 2.2% in FY2002 \n\n                                                 \n1   Sherani, S. 2002. Escaping the Debt Trap.

Pakistan Economic Update (July 2002\u2013June 2003). Manila.  \n4  On  18  June  2003,  the  Executive  Board  of  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  completed  the  fifth  review  of \nPakistan's performance under a 3-year, SDR1.03 billion (about $1.47 billion) Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility \narrangement, and approved the disbursement of an additional $123 million. After completion of the sixth review, the \nIMF  resident  office  in  Islamabad  is  hopeful  that  in  its  scheduled  meeting  in  October,  IMF  will  approve  further \ndisbursement  of  $240  million.  Pakistan  would  have  thus  drawn  a  total  of  $978  million  or  65%  of  the  Poverty \nReduction and Growth Facility. This is Pakistan's best ever record of compliance in an IMF program.  \n\n5   The  Poverty  Reduction  Cell  and  Planning  Commission  Policy  Wing,  Finance  Division.  2001.  Interim Poverty \n\nReduction Strategy Paper. Islamabad. \n\n\f2\n\n \n\n \n\nto 2.5% in FY2003. This large increase was mainly due to the sharp increase in the first half of \nthe year due to the base effect.  \n \n4. \nThe provinces are expected to contribute to financing these initiatives. Federal transfers \n(from the divisible pool of taxes and in the form of straight transfers) increased at an accelerated \nrate  of  20%  per  annum  between  FY1999  and  FY2003.  However,  this  was  not  enough  to \ncompensate  for  the  increased  provincial  obligations  to  support  LGs.  Responsibilities  for  basic \nservices were devolved without the modalities for fiscal decentralization in place. The situation \nis particularly acute in Sindh, which has some of the worst social indicators and underspending \nin  the  social  sector,  a  serious  budget  deficit,  and  a  complex  political  situation.  General \nadministrative  and  social  services  spending  has  doubled  in  5  years.  Sindh\u2019s  budget  has \nincreased from PRs51.7 billion in FY1999 to PRs99.3 billion in FY2003, while its budget deficit \nhas  increased  from  PRs9.9  billion  to  PRs18.6  billion  over  that  period.  Sindh  is  facing  a  debt \nstock of about PRs116 billion (about $2 billion) and debt servicing levels of PRs1.8 billion (about \n$300 million) per annum. To cope with the situation, the Sindh provincial government (SPG) has \nadopted a proactive strategy and retired about PRS 1.8 billion in expensive domestic debt in the \npast  2  years  to  create  more  fiscal  space.  However,  this  has  also  constrained  social  sector \nspending,  particularly  for  devolved  services,  which  is  still  only    $11  per  capita  for  education, \nhealth and drinking water supply and sanitation.  \n \nIn  FY2001,  SPG  embarked  on  the  Sindh  Reform  Program,  supported  by  the  World \n5. \nBank\u2019s  Sindh  structural  adjustment  credit  (SAC)  to  improve the overall governance and fiscal \nsituation.  The  program  includes  tax  and  civil  service  reforms,  improved  governance  in  the \nfinancial  sector,  and  creating  fiscal  space  for  increased  social  sector  spending.  Progress in \nachieving the objectives of the reform program was impressive in FY2001 and FY2002. Owing \nto  tighter  budgetary  controls,  exercise  of  greater  fiscal  prudence,  and  reprioritization  of \nexpenditures, the total spending of SPG grew at a slower pace of 16% per annum in FY2001 \nand FY2002 compared with 29% in FY1999 and FY2000. Revenues of the province from own \nsources, which contribute close to 16% of all provincial revenues, grew at 9% per annum during \nFY2000\u2013FY2002.  Since  FY2003,  however,  growth  in  provincial  revenues  has  slowed  down  to \nless  than  5%,  while  fiscal  stress  increased  due  to  accelerated  debt  repayments,  the  cost  of \ndevolution  and  the  poverty  reduction  agenda,  and  the  decision  of  the  federal  Government  to \nenhance salaries of government employees.  \n \n6. \nIt comes as no surprise then that Sindh\u2019s annual development plan is actually financed \nout  of  savings  that  occur  during  the  fiscal  year  and  from  foreign  project  assistance.  Put  in \nanother way, the entire annual development plan of SPG is a form of deficit financing, which is \nonly  met  by  savings  from  the  salary  component  or  cutting  down  on  nonsalary  expenditures. \nBecause  of  these  severe  fiscal  constraints,  SPG  is  forced  to  resort  to  a  number  of  tactics, \nincluding  delaying  releases  of  funds  and  cutting  down  on  nonsalary  and  development \ncomponents. At the same time, there is a huge gap between the functional obligations of LGs, \nincluding  district governments (DGs) and  taluka6/town  municipal  administrations  (TMAs),  and \nthe financial resources and tax bases within their control. The process of transferring property \ntaxes to TMAs has also been very slow, and TMAs have not been receiving their full  share of \nproperty taxes on time. While a total of PRs10 billion has been deducted at source for utilities to \nclear  all  arrears  up  to  December  2002,  it  left  TMAs  without  funds  for  water  and  sanitation \nservices.  \n \n\n                                                 \n6 Subdistrict.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n3\n\nSPG  has  made  some  headway  in  improving  its  financial  management  and  fiscal \n7. \nposition. It adopted a medium-term budgetary framework under the Sindh Reform Program and \nan  institutional  mechanism  under  the  Provincial  Finance  Commission    (PFC)  for  transparent, \nequitable distribution of funds. The restructuring problems have become more acute since the \nimplementation of the devolution plan, which entails delegation of fiscal powers, resources, and \nresponsibilities  to  the  LGs.  This  poses  two  kinds  of  risks  for  province-  level  financial \nmanagement.  First,  it  locks  in  financial  resources,  and  second,  it  involves  relinquishing \nbudgetary  controls  and  thus  exacerbates  the  cash-flow  problems.  Hence,  the  inclination  is  to \nretain financial control at province level, even for devolved services. \n\n \n\n8. \nSPG has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for support of the Sindh Reform \nProgram, its poverty reduction strategy and the devolution process over the next 3 years. This is \nin  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Pakistan  Country  Strategy  and  Program,  SPG  specifically requested ADB \nlong term support for devolved social services. 7 The program framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n \n \nTHE SECTOR \n\n \n\nIII. \n\n \nA. \n \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n \n\n1. \n\nPoverty and Social Status \n\n \n9. \nSindh is the southern province of Pakistan. Half of its population of about 35 million live \nin urban areas, most of them in Karachi, the economic hub of Pakistan with a population of 12 \nmillion.  The  average  per  capita  income  is  about  $450  per  person  per  year.  Poverty  has \nincreased from 27% in 1999 to 37% in 2001. About one third of the urban population and two \nthirds of the rural population live on less than about $1 a day. Drought is common in Sindh, and \nparticularly affects the population dependent on nonirrigated lands. Only 17% of the land area \nhas  sweet  water.  Rural  poverty,  unemployment,  high  fertility,  and  exploitation  result  in  high \nrural-urban migration, with Karachi\u2019s population growing at the rate of about 6% per year and a \nslum population of about 3 million.  \n \nDefining  poverty  as  overall  human  deprivation  comprising  limited  opportunities,  social \n10. \nexclusion,  and  vulnerability  to  exogenous  shocks,  an  estimated  50%  of  the  population  lives \nbelow  the  poverty  line.  In  addition  to  low  income,  poor  households  are  characterized  by  low \nlevels  of  education,  lack  of  safe  water,  and  unmet  needs  for  population  welfare  services.  The \nSocial Policy and Development Center8 ranked districts according to 11 social and 16 economic \ndevelopment  indicators.  The  Center  identified  Tharparkar,  Thatta,  Badin,  Jacobabad,  Ghotki, \nMirpur Khas, Sanghar and Shikarpur as the most deprived districts.  \n \nTwo  thirds  of  women  and  one  third  of  people  above  10  years  of  age  in  Sindh  are \n11. \nilliterate. Half of school-age children are not in school for reasons of poverty and lack of proper \nschools  and  instruction.  The  situation  is  worse  in  rural  areas.  Nearly  15,000  schools  are \nshelterless, while nearly 4,000 are closed due to nonavailability of resources. Participation rates \nhave stagnated. Women face the additional burden of gender discrimination. Gross enrollment \nis 38% for girls and 61% for boys. Key social indicators are in Appendix 2  (sector analysis). \n \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2003. Pakistan: Country Strategy and Program Update (2004-2006).

The \nmajority  of  women  have  anemia,  iodine  deficiency,  or  general  malnutrition.  About  5,000 \nmothers,  including  many  young  girls  aged  15\u201319,  die  each  year  due  to  pregnancy-related \ncomplications.  In  rural  areas,  women  face  many  difficulties  in  accessing  health  services.  For \nexample,  less  than  40%  of  women  deliver  in  health  facilities.  The  population  growth  rate  has \ngradually  fallen,  but  is  still  high  at  2.5%.  Due  to  the  population  momentum,  however,  Sindh\u2019s \npopulation  is  expected  to  double  in  the  next  30  years,  and  produce  major  strains  on  the \neconomy, the environment, and limited water resources.  \n \n13. \nAbout  10%  of  infants  die  before  1  year  of  age.  Pneumonia,  diarrheal  diseases,  and \nperinatal  diseases  account  for  70%  of  infant  deaths.  Only  50%  of  infants  are  fully  immunized. \nFrequent  illnesses,  food  shortages,  and  inadequate  care  cause  half  of  the  children  below  the \nage  of  5  to  be  underweight.  About  45%  of  rural  households  use  heavily  contaminated  water \nfrom uncovered wells, rivers, and ponds; and 53% do not have private toilet facilities. In urban \nareas,  major  problems  are  the  chronic  shortage  of  drinking  water,  pipe  leakage  and \ncontaminated water, and low cost recovery. Urban slum dwellers live in very poor environmental \nconditions, lacking services in solid waste management and access to sewerage systems. \n \n \n \nSPG  operates  an  extensive  network  of  education,  health,  and  drinking  water  supply \n14. \nservices.  Centrally  located  services  are  often  overused,  while  remote  facilities  are  often  run-\ndown or closed. Common problems among social services are (i) lack of funds for operation and \nmaintenance; (ii) poor quality of services due to poor staff performance; (iii) lack of access for \nwomen and girls due to a shortage of female staff, particularly in rural areas; (iv) prohibitive cost \nof  services  for  the  very  poor;  (v)  weak  management,  supervision,  and  monitoring  due  to \ngovernance problems; and (vi) limited stakeholder involvement and public accountability.   \n \nDuring the past decade, Sindh implemented SAP9 as an effort to uplift the social sector. \n15. \nThe SAP experience had mixed results.10 Primary and middle school enrollments could barely \nkeep up with population growth. Studies suggest run-down schools, costs, and opportunity costs \nin  association  with  poverty  and  drought  as  the  main  causes.  Immunization coverage, another \ncore  indicator,  also  stagnated,  perhaps  due  to  management  constraints  created  by  the  added \nburden of the polio eradication campaign. Child mortality was reduced, but this may in part be \nattributed to private sector development and secular trends. There was substantial progress in \nfamily  planning  services.  In  the  water  sector,  the  focus  was  on  handing  over  schemes  to \ncommunities, hence there was little improvement in access to safe drinking water.  \n \n16. \nOverall,  SAP  helped  increase  political  interest  in  the  sector,  focus  on  policies  and \nprograms  for  basic  services,  and  improve  the  annual  planning  and  budgeting  process.  It  also \ninitiated  support  for  school  management  committees  (SMCs)  and  village  development \nassociations  (VDAs),  and  made  improvements  in  governance  and  aid  coordination.  However, \nSAP  was  not  an  effective  instrument  to  engage districts  in  social  sector development  and  \n\n                                                 \n9   The SAP was supported by a consortium of external agencies including World Bank, ADB, European Commission, \nDepartment for International Development, and Netherlands Government.

The second phase of SAP \ncoincided  with  major  economic  and  governance  problems,  which  affected  its  performance.  As \nsocial sector financing declined, aid agencies engaged in micromanagement. Reimbursements \nslowed  down  pending  completion  of  the  reconciliation  process  demanded  by  those  agencies, \nand the sorting out of multiple audit queries created by the prevailing audit culture. Aid agency \nreimbursement  was  9%  of  SAP  expenditures  compared  with  a  commitment  of  25%.  In  short, \nSAP mainly helped improve the macroenvironment for social development.  The sector analysis \nis in Appendix 2.  The review of SAP is in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n  \n \n17. \nThe  lack  of  access  to  basic  social  services  of  adequate quality is considered a major \ncontributing factor to the alarming rise in poverty. The degradation of basic services owes itself \npartly to consistently low levels of investment in the social sector\u2014with per capita spending on \nsocial  sectors  in  Sindh  being  the  lowest  among  the  four  provinces11\u2014and partly on the social \nservices management infrastructure, which was highly centralized at the provincial level, out of \nstep with local requirements and, for the most part, noninclusive. Lack of appropriate planning \nprocesses and allocation of resources without evaluating needs and/or financial viability led to a \nlarge  stock  of  schools,  health  units,  and  water  supply  schemes  scattered  across  the  province \nthat were abandoned for lack of funds, poor design, or because they were simply not required in \nthose areas. In addition, local communities felt no sense of ownership for programs and projects \ndesigned by international, federal or provincial designed entities. The LGs and local people had \nvirtually no say in the development of those sector activities, which were driven by a one-size-\nfits-all  approach.  There  was  little  incentive  for  local  service  delivery  and  accountabilities  to \nimprove;  in  fact,  LGs  strategically  withdrew  from  provision  of  basic  services  in  education and \nhealth. Where they were asked to take over provincial schemes, especially in the water sector, \nthe LGs failed to maintain them due lack of either finances or sense of ownership.  \n \nIn  August  2001,  following  a  year  of  local  elections,  the  Government  implemented  the \n18. \ndevolution  plan  and,  in  one  go,  created  three  levels  of  LGs  entailing  political,  financial,  and \nadministrative  devolution.  In  Sindh,  it  created  16  DGs,  102  TMAs,  and  1,044  union \nadministrations  (UAs)  to  function  as  autonomous  local  bodies  with  their  own  responsibilities, \nfinancial shares, and revenue sources.12 DGs were made responsible for schools, colleges, and \ndistrict  health  services,  and  TMAs  for  water  supply  and  waste  disposal,  in  coordination  with \nUAs. The Local Government  Ordinance  (LGO)  provides  the  basic  political  and  administrative \nframework  for  the  devolution.  DGs  are  independent  LGs,  while  TMAs  and  UAs  have  been \ndesignated as autonomous corporate bodies. These new responsibilities require changes in the \nprovincial structures for those services and entailed a process of transfer of human and financial \nresources from the province to LGs, as well as a series of amendments in relevant laws, rules, \nsystems, procedures, and processes. Given the complexity of the task, it is not surprising that \nthe transfer of powers is still continuing. The new mandates clearly posed many new challenges \nfor  the  newly  created  LGs,  which  were  faced  with  heightened  public  expectations  on  the  one \nhand and large capacity gaps to handle these responsibilities, on the other. The new structure \nhas  shaken  up  administrative  relationships,  including  placement  of  the  local  administration \nunder  an elected  council  headed  by  a nazim,13and  relative  autonomy  of  LGs  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  \n\n                                                 \n11\n\n Social Policy and Development Center. 2001.

Karachi. \n\n12  While population sizes vary widely, particularly between urban and rural areas, districts have a population of about \n\n2 million (except Karachi district), subdistricts about 200,000, and unions about 20,000.  \n\n13  An elected district head. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\n \n\nprovincial  government.  The  role  of  provincial  line  departments  (PLDs)  in  policy  making, \nregulation, standard setting, quality control, and monitoring is still not clear. As to be expected, \nthere are also tensions between provincial and local elected representatives, and between DGs \nand  TMAs  that  need  to  be  diffused.  While  this  new  setup  will  take  time  to  strengthen  and \nconsolidate, it also needs the means to mature and demonstrate its potential.  \n \n19. \nDevolution  is  based  on  the  premise  that  locally  managed  basic  services will improve \nresponsiveness  to  local  needs  and  facilitate  improved  delivery,  as  it  provides  a  range  of \nopportunities for enhancing political commitment and greater accountability to the public. During \nthe  first  2  years  after  devolution,  social  sector  performance  showed  signs  of  improvement, \nalthough with great variation among districts. Councilors report improvement in staff attendance, \nstaff  report  improved  supplies,  and  several  nazims  emphasize  the  importance  of  operations \nabove  new  civil  works.  There  are the expected  problems\u2014political  transfer  of  staff,  and  non-\nmerit-based recruitment of staff and site selection for facilities. The DG budget barely covers the \nexpenses for the fixed obligations that were to operate the existing services transferred to them, \nso a general freeze on new construction is required. Salaries have not yet been transferred to \nthe  district,  so  DGs  have  little  control  over  provincial  staff  and  staff  transfers.  Despite  late \nreleases of funds and procedural constraints, however, use  of available development funds has \nbeen satisfactory in most places. Much of capacity building has so far concentrated on the DGs, \nwhile TMAs and UAs have received little attention. Under the Decentralization Support Program \n(DSP)  and  other  external  assistance,  efforts  are  under  way  to  improve  the  capacity  of  LGs. \nSpecial  efforts  are  made  to  improve  financial  management  and  the  audit  trail  for  tracking \nexpenditures. The Accountant General\u2019s office is preparing appropriation accounts for the DGs.  \nSteps  initiated  by  SPG  to  address  the  macro  and  microenvironment  issues  are  likely  to \ncontribute  to  the  improvement  of  social  sector  infrastructure  and  are  in  the  right  direction. \nHowever, they are clearly not enough as the social and financial gaps are both wide and deep. \nSupplementary Appendix B summarizes Pakistan\u2019s devolution program.      \n \n \n \n20. \nEducation, health, and drinking water and sanitation services collectively made up about \n28%  of  total  provincial  spending  from  FY1999  to  FY2003.  Between  FY2000  and  FY2002, \nexpenditure  for  education  and  health  increased,  respectively,  11%  and  9%  per  annum. \nHowever, the share of education and health in total provincial expenditures fell from 24% and \n7% in FY1999 to 20% and 6%, respectively, by FY2003. Nonsalary expenditures accounted for \na modest 9% of total spending on education and 26% on health, while development spending \non  education  and  health  was  8%  in  FY2003.  Spending  on  water  and  sanitation  has  been \nminimal  due  to  payment  of  utility  arrears.  SPG  now  commits  to  maintaining  education  and \nhealth spending as a share of provincial revenue, at about 30%, and expects to register growths \nof 12% and 22%, respectively, for education and health in FY2003.  \n \n21.  Much of the increase in spending is due to federally decided salary increases. Spending \non  the  nonsalary  components  and  on  developmental  activities  in  FY2003  was  significantly \nbelow budgetary estimates. In addition, cash flow problems resulted in inadequate and delayed \nreleases of funds to the service sites, thereby undermining the proper use of funds to finance \noperations and development. Thus, financing constraints impacted much more seriously on the \nefficiency  and  effectiveness  of  service  delivery  than  the  overall  spending  gap  would  suggest. \nThere  is  a  strong  case  for  improving  the  effective  and  efficient  use  of  available  resources  by \nincreasing  nonsalary  expenditures.  SPG  has  frozen  new  recruitment,  which  is,  however, \nmaintaining the gender imbalance in staffing pattern. SPG also wants to contain infrastructure. \nFurther  improvement  in  financing  is  proposed  by  increasing  the  fiscal  transfers  to  provincial \n\nSector Financing \n\n \n4. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n7\n\n5. \n\nEducation \n\ngovernments  and  LGs,  improving  the  flow  of  funds  to  LGs,  giving  LG  functionaries \nadministrative and financial authorities, improving  management capacity and procedures, and \ndeveloping partnership with local communities.  \n \nThe proposed  levels  of  funding  for  the  education  and  health  sectors  are  likely  to  be \n22. \nsustainable largely because the overall budget deficits will be much smaller eventually if there \ncontinues to be a sizable cushion provided by vacant sanctioned positions (which will be partly \nused up by pay rise) and there are timely inflows from other externally assisted programs and \nprojects. However, any substantial increase in allocations both in the provincial government and \nDG  budgets,  so  as  to  move  toward  MDGs,  will  be  contingent  upon  accelerated  repayment  of \nexpensive  debt  and  increase  in  the  share  of  the  provinces  to  at  least  40%  under  the  new \nNational Finance Commission Award expected to be finalized before the close of FY2004. \n \n \n \n23. \nThe  National  Education  Sector  Reform  Program  2001  lays  out  education  policies, \nprograms,  and  investment  requirements.  The  major  goals  are  (i)  universal  primary  enrollment \nfrom  about  70%  at  present;  (ii)  increase  in  middle  and  secondary  school  enrollments  from \nrespectively,  48%  and  30%  to  55%  and  40%;  (iii)  and  literacy  from  50%  to  60%  by  2005.14 \nSindh is following this reform program, and is in the process of defining its own targets.  \n \n24. \nAs per the devolution plan, SPG handed over 43,035 schools (and about 200 colleges) \nto DGs, along with the budget to operate and improve services, but excluded salaries and direct \nsupport  to  SMCs  to  improve  operation  and  maintenance  of  schools.15 About 3 million children \nare currently enrolled in primary school. This number needs to increase by 2 million in the next \n10 years, or 200,000 per year. Consequently, at least another 100,000 children per year should \nbe added to classes 6\u201312 to double current enrollment. Sector trends have started to reverse \nthe enrollment decline, with improvements in the quality of instruction and retention of children. \nSPG  has  provided  textbooks  and  stipends,  and  improved  primary  school  and  teacher salary \nconditions with the support of SAC. In FY2003, however, only about half the targeted number of \nadditional  children  were  enrolled  in  primary  schools  in  Sindh.  SPG  plans  to  hire  more  female \nteachers for primary schools, hire them on contract basis, and make the contract school-specific \nto increase capacity and make schools more attractive for boys and girls.  \n \n25. \nADB  has  just  approved  a  Sindh  Decentralized  Elementary  Education  Project  for \nupgrading  1,200  primary  schools  to  elementary  schools.16  SPG  wants  to  further  increase \nsupport  for  classes  6\u201312,  including  SMCs,  adding  female  teachers,  stipends  and  textbooks. \nSPG is also keen to improve katchi 17 classes, shelterless schools, and home schools for literacy \nof  girls.  The  European  Commission  (EC)  is  proposing  an  education  project  for  Sindh  in  2005, \nwhere  all  the  external  agencies  in  the  sector  will  work  toward  achieving  the  Sindh  education \nprogram through a sectorwide approach or similar arrangement. The United States Agency for \nInternational  Development  (USAID)  is  directly  supporting  teacher  training  and  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs)  in  4  districts.  Estimates  indicate  that,  considering  other  aid  agency \ncommitments, there is a minimal financing gap of PRs3 billion (about $50 million) per year  for \nschools up to class 12.    \n           \n\n                                                 \n14  Ministry of Education, Education Sector Reforms Action Plan, 2001\u20132005. \n15  For FY2004, the plan is to lump all sector budgets and transfer these as a one-line item to districts.   \n16 ADB. 2002.

SPG  is \npreparing  a  provincial  health  strategy  with  its  own  revised  targets.  The  child  mortality  rate  is \nexpected  to  drop  from  115  to  80  per  1,000  live  births  over  the  period  2000-2015,  and  the \nmaternal mortality ratio from about 400 to 250 per 100,000 live births in the same period.  \n \nAs per the devolution plan, SPG handed over 1,280 of 1,324 health facilities to the 16 \n27. \nDGs,  along  with  a  budget  to  operate  and  improve  these  services,  excluding  salaries.  A  major \nproblem of basic health facilities is the lack of a minimal budget for operation and maintenance. \nSPG  released  about  40%  of  the  provincial  health  budget  to  the  districts  to  provide  primary \nhealth  care  ranging  from  basic  health  units  to  district  hospitals.  The  remainder  is  spent  on  44 \nprovincial  institutions  and  tertiary  hospitals.  A  common  view  is  that  hospitals  were  neglected \nduring  SAP.  However,  hospitals  are  generally  in  a  better  state  than  the  basic  health  facilities \nthat  lack  staff,  medicines,  and  maintenance  and  repairs.  SPG  is  exploring  the  possibility  of \nmaking  hospitals  and  teaching  institutions  autonomous  to  improve  their  performance  and \ncontain  costs.  There  are  no  reliable  estimates  of  the  funding  gap  in  the  provincial  and  district \nhealth  services.  However,  minimum  international  standards  for  per  capita  spending  on  health \nvary between $12 and $75 per year, so a current public spending level of $2 per capita per year \nis in any case very low. The bulk of health sector financing comes from out-of-pocket spending, \nabout $9 per  person  per  year.  Many  poor  households  can\u2019t  afford  this,  and  resort  to  cheaper \nservices  of  poor  quality  offered  by  quacks  and  shops,  and  resulting  in  income  erosion.  Aside \nfrom  private  sector  regulation,  offering  alternative,  quality  public  services  is  important. Modest \nprogress has been made in contracting out services to NGOs. SPG plans to further encourage \npublic-private  partnership  (PPP)  in  the  sector  and  establish  health  boards  with  representation \nfrom civil society for all health facilities.         \n \nAbout  35%  of  the  health  budget  is  funded  through  various  federal  programs.  These \n28. \ninclude  the  expanded  program  for  immunization,  the  national  program  for  family  planning  and \nprimary  health  care,  the  national  population  program,  the  nutrition  program, and programs for \nthe  control  of  tuberculosis,  malaria,  and  the  acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome.  Federal \nInternational  Development  (DFID), \nprograms  are  supported  by  ADB,  Department \nGovernment of Japan, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, United Nations Population Fund, World \nBank, and other external agencies. The funding gap in these programs for Sindh is estimated at \nPRs1  billion  (about  $17  million)  per  year.18 While the delegation of these priority programs to \nDGs is important to strengthen devolution, funding and capacity are major constraints.        \n \n \n \nAs per the devolution plan, the Public Health Engineering Department has been merged \n29. \nwith  the  Local  Government  Department  and  will  continue  to  execute  large-scale development \nand extend technical support to TMAs. In collaboration with UAs, the TMAs are responsible for \nbasic water, sanitation, drainage, garbage collection, and solid waste management. \n \n30. \nSPG aims to increase rural access to safe drinking  water and proper sanitation. It uses \ntwo standards: (i) coverage with piped water and drainage schemes (respectively 10% and 7%) \nand basic coverage including hand pumps and pit latrines (respectively, 55% and 47%). In total, \nrural areas have 1,056 schemes for water supply and 730 for drainage.

Progress on Agenda for Health Sector Reform.  Islamabad. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n9\n\n8. \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\nsupply  schemes  have  been  transferred  to  VDAs,  and  about  one  quarter  are  not  working  for \nvarious reasons such as poor design, high utility charges, and lack of maintenance. SPG plans \nto update  its  rural  drinking  water  supply  policy.  It  is  based  on  the  uniform  policy  of  promoting \ncommunity ownership and management of services, but needs to be adjusted according to the \ndevolved  setup.  Priorities  in  the  rural  areas  are  the  categorization  of  existing  schemes, \nconsumer  demand  studies,  social  mobilization  to  hand  over  schemes,  a  master  plan  for  each \nTMA,  installation  of  non-mechanized  schemes  wherever  feasible,  and  rehabilitation  of \nnonfunctioning schemes after technical and financial feasibility studies. To build the capacity of \nTMAs and VDAs, SPG proposes strengthening the provincial training institutions. An investment \nof about PRs 68 billion (about $1.2 billion) is required for basic services over the next 10 years.    \n          \n31. \nFor urban areas, coverage with piped water and drainage schemes is, respectively, 79% \nand  82%.  Contamination  of  drinking  water  and  poor  environmental  sanitation  are  major \nproblems in urban areas. SPG proposes to improve water quality by repairing existing systems \nthrough separate projects pending major investments needed in the urban sector. SPG plans to \nupdate  the  policy  on  solid  waste  management,  incorporating  potential  collaboration  with  the \nprivate sector. The urban sector is plagued by a major funding gap of billions of rupees, while \naid funding had not been tight in recent years.        \n \n  \n \n32. \nPakistan\u2019s progress in the social sector reflects the local political economy. This situation \nis probably more extreme in Sindh province, which has a major urban-rural political divide and a \nfeudal/tribal  system  largely  intact  in  rural  areas.  Private  services  in  rural  areas  are  very  few, \nunlike in the cities and towns, where there is a well-developed private sector. The private sector \nhas  a  strong  spirit  of  entrepreneurship,  philanthropy,  and  self-regulation,  as  is  evident  in  the \nnumerous nonprofit organizations, self-sustaining schools and hospitals, and other services for \nthe poor. Without these, the social status in Sindh would have been much worse today. These \nurban  services  are  mostly  institutionalized,  and  are  often  operated  by  families  and  social \ngroups.  In  contrast,  local  initiatives  in  rural  areas  often  depend  on  individual  leadership  for \nsurvival.  This  leadership  at  the  village  level  can,  however,  have  a  major  impact.  Due  to \ndifferences in local leadership, two economically comparable villages can greatly differ in social \nindicators,  which  may  reflect  on  the  status  of  women,  community  support  mechanisms,  and \nvillage hygiene. A common problem is that communities lack confidence and know-how to take \ncontrol  of  their  social  services.  However,  the  transition  process  is  well  under  way  in  many \ncommunities where SMCs are now managing and improving schools. In Khairpur district, health \nboards operate government health facilities. About one quarter of water schemes are operated \nthrough  community-owned,  self-regulated  VDAs.  To  capture  these  developments,  a  favorable \ngovernance  and  financial  environment  is  necessary,  as  well  as  local,  hands-on  capacity \nbuilding. Indeed, given the political economy of Pakistan, the Government cannot be expected \nto operate social services effectively without strong community support. For a highly centralized \nGovernment  focusing  on  its  own  processes  of  control  and  audit,  this  is  a  major  challenge. \nDevolution provides the opportunity to take bold steps toward community owned social services.   \n \nThe traditional roles of men and women are deeply ingrained in Sindh\u2019s rural society. For \n33. \ntheir own security and the welfare of their children, women have internalized a submissive role \nsince  childhood.  Devolution  has  addressed  gender  issues  to  some  extent,  including  the \nreservation  of  one  third  of  reserve  seats  for  female  councilors.  In  practice,  however,  women \nhave  little  voice  except  in  positions  of  high  authority.  Many  external  agencies  provide  multiple \ntraining programs for women leaders, but mostly without adjusting structural impediments and \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10\n\n \n\n \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\nmobilizing public support. Major gender reforms are planned under the Gender Reform Action \nPlan (GRAP) supported by ADB and other agencies.  \n     \nB. \n \n34.  Multiple  Problems  and  Pervasive  Poverty.  Sindh\u2019s  many  problems  combined  with \npervasive  poverty  are  potentially  overwhelming  government  and  private  resources.  The \ntechnology for developing basic services in all sectors is more or less standard and available. \nThe policies and reform agendas for the education and health sectors are basically sound, while \nthose for the water and sanitation sector need to be developed. The social sectors are dissimilar \nin many respects but the major problems affecting them are comparable. While problems can\u2019t \nbe  linked  to  a  single  cause,  nor  addressed  in  an  isolated  manner,  governance,  and  the \nunderlying  political  economy  are  at  the  core  of  the  problems.  Social  sector  development, \nforemost,  requires  governance  reforms.  Poverty  reduction,  including  social  development, \nrequires  a  coordinated  governance  response  to  improve  social  sector  management  and \nfinancing under the  overall  umbrella  of  the  PRSP,  the  Sindh  Reform  Program,  and  the  LGO. \nThe sectors have improved following devolution, but further governance reforms are needed.   \n \n \n35. \nSlow Pace of Transfer of Powers. While it is clear that the responsibility for providing \nbasic  services  in  health,  education,  and  water  and  sanitation  have  been  assigned  to  the  LGs, \ncommensurate  administrative  authority  has  not  yet  been  fully  devolved.  For  example,  public \nhealth  engineering  staff  has  been  posted  to  districts  rather  than  to  TMAs.  Roles  and \nresponsibilities  of  line  departments  and  LGs  lack  clarity.  Areas  such  as  recruitment, \nprocurement, and intergovernmental relations in terms of monitoring responsibilities are still all \nfairly fluid and there are still no systems for establishing linkages among the LGs themselves. \nAlso,  personnel  management  is  not  yet  devolved.  The  provincial  government  continues  to \nexercise administrative powers over the transfers and postings of officers. This setup seriously \nhampers the ability of the LGs to rationalize and redeploy staff, enforce work discipline and hold \nstaff accountable for performance. Moreover,  LGs  lack  financial  control.  Devolution of political \npower  must  be  followed  by  a  process  of  gradual  fiscal  decentralization,  which  can  only  be \nactualized after fiscal powers have been transferred to the LGs.  \n \nPoorly  Distributed  Services  and  Shortage  of  Resources.  LGs  need  to  rationalize \n36. \nservices.  New  infrastructure  is  not  matched  with  a  budget  to  run  the  services.  This  imbalance \nmay  further  increase  unless  services  are  rationally  planned.  Staff  is  poorly  distributed  across \nSindh due to harsh living conditions. In particular, attention should be given to lack of access to \nservices  for  the  very  poor,  women  and  girls,  and  people  living  in  remote  hamlets.  In  the \neducation and health sectors, there is a major problem of shortage of female staff in rural areas. \nIn  the  health  sector,  there  are  also  major  imbalances  among  the  various  cadres.  In  the  water \nand  sanitation  sector  (WSS),  there  is  lack  of  trained  engineers  at  TMA  level.  Alternative \nstrategies  of  service  delivery  have  to  be  deployed  to  make  services  available  to  rural \npopulations,  such  as  the  recruitment  of  local  women,  provision  of  home  schools  for  girls,  and \nincentives  and  security  arrangements.  Social  sector  financing  also  needs  improvement.  SPG \nfinancing is not pro-poor and needs improvement in terms of allocation,  flow of funds, financial \nmanagement, accountability, and transparency.  The provinces in Pakistan have a very narrow \ntax  base.  As  a  result,  they  depend  heavily  on  transfers  from  the  federal  Government.  In  the \ncase  of  Sindh,  federal  transfers  account  for  75%  of  the  total  resources  available  to  SPG. \nBecause  these  transfers  are  either  irregular  or  incomplete,  they  cause  SPG  considerable \nproblems  in  cash  flow  management.  Consequently,  resource  flows  to  the  LGs\u2014whose own \nrevenue base is very limited and which in turn depend on provincial transfer\u2014are unpredictable, \nthereby preventing LGs from effectively planning and implementing development initiatives.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n11\n\n \n37. \nReluctance  of  Local  Governments  to  Involve  Communities.  The  Sindh  LGO \nenvisages  and  encourages  partnerships  between  the  LGs  and  civil  society.  However,  the \nperformance  of  citizens  community  boards  in  Sindh  is  poor. Similarly, in the case of schools, \nwhere the forum of SMCs has been strengthened, and the VDAs in the water sector to whom \nschemes are handed over for management after completion, there is a clear tilt toward involving \nthe community in various modes of engagement (coproducers, oversight roles, etc.). However, \na more concerted attempt to achieve these partnerships is needed.  \n \n38. \nLimited  Managerial  and  Technical  Capacity.  A  concerted,  cohesive,  organized  yet \nmultipronged approach is needed to build the capacity of LGs to levels that will enable them to \ndeliver basic services. The Government has already initiated the DSP, aimed at strengthening \nthe LGs by developing their capacities in basic areas such as audit, accounts, budgeting, and \ncommunication. Major efforts are needed to improve the managerial and technical skills of staff \nworking in the social sector. The DSP will be working closely with the DSSP and the Access to \nJustice Program, and the 3 programs will complement each other. \n \n39. \nOne-Time Opportunity for Major Governance Reforms with Devolution.  The social \nsector employs more than half of Sindh\u2019s civil servants. This is a one-time opportunity to reform \nthe social sector, which so far received limited support in the devolution process. The transition \nprovides  an  important  opportunity  to  mobilize  civil  society,  introduce  participatory  approaches, \npromote public-private partnership, and develop a new role for the PLDs.  \n \n40. \nPolitical  Will,  Local  Leaders,  and  Participation  to Achieve MDGs. Vested interests \nare opposed to devolution and may cause political instability and lack of commitment. Priorities \nof politicians may be in conflict with those that service the public interest best. Coordination with \nthe  DSP  and  other  programs  gives  opportunities  to  educate  and  groom  new  leaders,  and \ndevelop  local  institutions.  The  public  needs  to  be  informed  about  expectations  from  and  the \nperformance  of  local  leaders  on  such  topics  as  public  needs  and  rights,  and  the  quality  and \ndistribution of services.  Community-based organizations (CBOs) can be made responsible for \nroutine  services,  as  has  been  shown  in  the  education  sector.  The  proximity  of  beneficiaries \noffers a major opportunity to improve transparency, quality, and accountability of services on a \nsustainable basis. While this is a sensitive issue for LGs who have just assumed power, reforms \nmay be relatively easier now before the current system becomes entrenched. The private sector \nis growing rapidly in the urban sector. It is the leading provider in the health sector and will, in \nthe years ahead, operate about half the schools in Sindh. SPG has been exploring partnership \nand is keen to set up a fund to sponsor NGOs proposed by LGs to support CBOs and improve \nsocial services, e.g., through contracting out entire services or contracting in managers. At the \nsame  time,  the  private  sector  also  needs  support  to  become  more  effective  in  quality  of \nservices, possibly with the help of self-regulatory mechanisms.    \n\n \n41. \nSindh\u2019s social sector indicators show high levels of illiteracy, malnutrition, mortality and \npopulation  growth,  which  have  a  major  impact  on  Sindh\u2019s  economy,  environment,  and  water \nresources.  Public  social  services  are  run-down  due  to  chronic  problems  in  governance, \ncapacity,  and  financing.  The  current  public  sector  is  by  and  large  an  employment  scheme, \nspending  almost  exclusively  on  salaries  with  hardly  any  budget  to  operationalize  services. \nDevelopment  spending  has  also  declined  to  an  all-time  low.  The  Government  is  committed to \naddress the poverty trap and gender imbalance in a holistic manner including the development \nof  social  services.  It  is  evident  that  improving  of  efficiency,  equity,  effectiveness,  and \nsustainability  in  the  social  sector  requires  addressing  the  serious  problems  in  governance, \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12\n\n \n\n \n\nparticipation, and financing. Otherwise, it is unlikely that social indicators will move toward the \nMDGs.  \n  \n42. \nThe  SPG  is  committed  to  reduce  poverty  through  economic,  social,  legal  and  political \ndimensions  of  governance  by  forging  partnerships  with  civil  society  including  PPPs.  SPG has \ndeveloped  a  comprehensive  approach  to  uplift  public  and  community  services  for  the  poor, \nbased on a medium-term framework to improve key MDG indicators. In 2003, SPG prepared the \nSindh  PRSP. The Sindh Reform Program  and  the  Sindh  LGO  provide  the  basic  financial  and \ngovernance framework for social sector development. Sector reform programs have also been \nformulated  based  on  the  National  Education  Sector  Reform  Program  and  the  National  Health \nPolicy.  Uniform  policies  for  the  WSS  will  be  adapted  to  the  new  role  of  TMAs  in  the  devolved \nsetup.  \n \n43. \nThe Sindh  PRSP proposes  a  three-pronged  poverty  reduction  strategy  focusing  on  (i) \nequitable delivery of social services to the poor, (ii) creation of employment opportunities for the \npoor, and (iii) provision of an institutional arrangement for skills transfer and extension of micro \ncredit  to  the  poor.  In  the  social  sector,  it  aims  to  improve  performance  through  better \ngovernance,  stronger  partnership  with  civil  society,  and  need-based  allocation  of  resources. \nSPG  requested  ADB  to  provide  support  for  a  DSSP.  ADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Program \n(2002\u20132006) fully endorses Sindh\u2019s focus on poverty reduction, with governance as the central \npillar.  ADB\u2019s  major  thrusts  are  (i)  good  governance  including  decentralization  and  access  to \njustice, (ii) pro-poor economic growth, and (iii) inclusive social development. The Program gives \nsubstantial  emphasis  on  participation:  citizen  involvement,  especially  of  women,  and  private \nsector development. It also renews emphasis on water resource management. \n \n44. \nThe Sindh Reform Program aims to address governance and fiscal reforms as the root \ncauses  of  poverty  and  deprivation.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  SAC  supports  the  provincial  effort  to \nimprove  financing  and  administration,  and  to  pursue  civil  service  reforms.  SPG  has  already \nundertaken  a  number  of  initiatives  ranging  from  increasing  the  budget  outlays  on  health  and \neducation in recent years, embarking upon broad  governance reforms, and support for general \ncapacity building for LGs. For example, the allocations for maintenance and rehabilitation in the \nWSS increased by 58% in FY2003 and by 21% in FY2004. The proposed DSSP\u2019s support for \nreform and financing builds on the SAC inputs.     \n \n45. \nThe Sindh LGO offers major opportunities for social sector reforms. The LGs give a level \nof  political  representation  that  is  closer  to  and  more  dependent  on  public  interests.  However, \nthere  are  major  challenges  and  risks.  Local  leaders  have  just  taken  control,  have  limited \nexposure to working with other stakeholders in the social sector, and may not be ready to share \npowers.  LGs  are  ill  equipped  to  undertake  reforms,  particularly  in  the  social  sector,  and  risk \nrepeating  previous  mistakes  due  to  lack  of  technology  transfer.  Misuse  of  funds  for  projects \nselected not on the basis of merit is a real risk. To increase accountability, the LGO emphasizes \nstrengthening  the  role  of  the  community,  particularly  through  CBOs,  and  citizen  oversight \narrangements. It also favors expanding social services through PPP and the private sector. This \nlinks well with the realities on the ground, where communities and the private sector (including \nNGOs)  have  been  the  driving  forces  in  social  services  expansion.  However,  it  does  require  a \nchange of mind-set. Devolution provides a unique opportunity to make this happen.    \n \n46. \nADB\u2019s  DSP  supports  these  macro  governance,  gender,  and  financial  management \nreforms.  Several  technical  assistance  grants  (TA),  including  for  fiscal  decentralization  and \ngender reform, provide timely and critical inputs to implement these reforms. ADB\u2019s Access to \nJustice  Program  supports  major  reforms  in  the  judiciary  system  and  rule  of  law.  Two  ADB \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n13\n\nprojects,  the  Decentralized  Elementary  Education  Project  and  the  Women\u2019s  Health  Project \nalready support the sector.19 ADB, DFID and World Bank also support vertical health programs. \nUSAID is planning to expand support for the education sector, particularly teacher training and \nexpansion  of  services  through  NGOs.  The  EC  is  also  planning  support  for  Sindh\u2019s  education \nsector  starting  in  2005.  The  proposed  DSSP  will  provide  supportive  reforms  and  flexible \nfinancing to address the gaps in the social sector, complementary to other donor assistance. A \nsummary of the development coordination matrix is in Appendix 3.       \n \nBased  on  lessons  learned  during  SAP,  and  the  changed  relationship  with  LGs  after \n47. \ndevolution,  SPG  wanted  to  follow  an  approach  different  from  SAP.  As  reflected  in  its  project \nperformance audit report, the first SAP demonstrated (i) the importance of broadening the social \nplatform,  particularly  involving  beneficiaries  and  the  private  sector  in  service  delivery;  (ii)  the \nimportance of clear authority and flexibility to make decisions at the local level, given the nature \nof  services;  (iii)  the  value  of  keeping  systems  simple;  and  (iv)  the  importance  of  addressing \ngovernance,  fiscal,  and  financial  management  constraints.  The  SAP  demonstrated  that  social \nsector development requires a long-term approach, focusing on basic governance and services \nwhile avoiding micromanagement. Social development requires a large number of autonomous \nLGs  to  undertake  activities  in  widely  scattered  facilities  and  communities  throughout  Sindh. \nBased  on  extensive  consultations,  SPG  proposed  a  program  modality  to  provide  flexible \nfinancing  to  address  the  gaps  in  service  delivery,  and  support  reforms,  capacity  building,  and \nmonitoring and evaluation. Flexible support is required as local needs and priorities, while within \na  given  scope,  cannot  be  precisely  identified  and  costed  in  advance.  The  DSSP  links  flexible \nsupport with overall improvement of governance and financing, especially targeting the poor and \nwomen. There will be need for capacity building involving all stakeholders in the social sectors.  \n \n48. \nExtensive  stakeholder  consultation  supported  the  development  of  the  DSSP.  ADB \nprovided  TA  and  staff  consultants  to  assess  the  crosscutting  and  sector-specific issues in the \nsector and consult stakeholders through a national and three provincial workshops.20 Consulting \nof  stakeholders  during  the  Project  Completion  Review  mission  of  the  Second  Social  Action \nProgram (Sector) Project (SAPPII), jointly with the World Bank, also yielded  important insights \ninto both progress and constraints after devolution. The importance of continuing this dialogue \nwith stakeholders during program implementation needs to be emphasized.      \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\nThe  overall  goal  of  the  DSSP  is  to  improve  people\u2019s  education,  health21 and access to \n49. \nwater and sanitation, and thus help reduce poverty and gender imbalances. The broad purpose \nis  to  increase  school  enrolment,  and  coverage  with  health  and  clear  water  and  sanitation \nservices. These objectives are to be achieved by improving governance and financing of social \nservices, that should in turn result in increased access to basic social services, in particular for \nwomen,  better  quality  of  services,  and  improved  efficiency,  affordability,  and  sustainability  of \nservices. The program framework is in Appendix 1, and overall sector targets are in Appendix 2. \n  \n\n                                                 \n19 ADB. 1999.

The policy matrix is in Appendix 4. \n \n51. \nProgram  support  will  comprise  a  conditional  block  grant  support  to  LGs  to  undertake \nsocial  sector  development  according  to  local  priorities  within  the  defined  program  scope.  This \nflexibility, combined with local planning, ensures that funding for programs and projects will not \noverlap. In education, the program covers all schools, ranging from katchi class to class 10, or \nclass  12  for  a  few  higher  secondary  schools,  but  not  colleges.22 In health, the scope ranges \nfrom  community  health  workers  to  district  hospitals.  In  WSS,  within  the  authority  of  TMAs,  it \nincludes  surveys  and  mapping,  rehabilitation  of  mechanized  schemes  that  are  considered \ntechnically  and  financially  viable,  small  new  schemes  for  basic  drinking  water  supply,  small-\nscale  drainage,  health  education  and  promotion  of  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  management. \nThe  Program  also  supports  crosscutting  activities  such  as  women\u2019s  development,  advocacy, \nand leadership training. LGs will prepare annual sector plans to access funding. LGs will decide \non  the  priorities  but  the  plans  should  reflect  a  minimum  package  of  interventions  to  be \nundertaken  from  all  available  resources  (including  other  external  assistance)  and  adhere  to \ncertain items that cannot be financed from program proceeds, or only on certain conditions.  \n \n \n52. \nyears, and project support for a TA for strengthening social sector development for 4 years.  \n \n53. \nThe  TA  project  supports  (i)  sector  and  program  management  and  monitoring,  (ii)  LG \ncapacity  building  and  partnership  development,  and  (iii)  sector  specific  policy  reforms.  Further \nTA through a separate TA for international consulting services is planned for 2004 (para. 105).   \n \n54. \nThe DSSP supports the Sindh PRSP, the Sindh Reform Program, and the Sindh LGO. \nThe  Program  will  be  specifically  linked  to  the  SAC,  especially  on  fiscal  restructuring  and  civil \nservices reforms, and will build on the SAC reforms in the social sector under the medium term \nfinancing  framework  of  SPG.  It  will  also  be  specifically  linked  to  the  DSP  and  the  Access  to \nJustice  Program,  especially  on  governance  reforms,  devolution  of  powers,  and  administrative \nand  financial  capacity  building  and  gender  mainstreaming  (GRAP).  The  Program  will  be \ncoordinated  with  and  supplementary \nto  other  external  assistance.  The  development \ncoordination matrix is in Appendix 3.     \n \n55.    The recently established LGs are to uplift the run-down social services, rationalize them \nand make them more sustainable. The LGs face major constraints: limited capacity, continuing \ncontrol  exercised  by  the  province,  lack  of  clarity  on  the  role  of  the  districts  and  the  line \ndepartments,  lack  of  financial  autonomy,  lack  of  integration  of  federal  programs,  inability  or \nunwillingness to enter into a regular partnership with communities, and political, economic and \nsocial  constraints.  Policy  reforms  are  needed  in  financing,  transfer  and  use  of  funds, \ngovernance procedures, and community participation and responsiveness. \n \n56.    Uplifting  social  services  first  of  all  requires  action  to  improve  the  flow  of  funds  to  LGs, \nwhich have continued to be affected by fiscal constraints. Arrangements need to be put in place \nthat assure more consistent funding and timely release of funds to LGs. Second, planning and \nimplementation capacity needs to be strengthened to be able to use funds properly.   \n \n\n                                                 \n22 The Program also supports primary education grades 1\u20135 for activities not financed under SAC.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n15\n\n57.    As  elected  LGs  receive  delegated  powers,  they  urgently  need  assistance  to  develop  a \nmore  systematic  approach  in  operating  services  in  their  areas  of  jurisdiction.  There  is  a \nsubstantial  risk  that  management  will  be  ad  hoc  and  focused  on  new  facilities,  neglecting  the \noperation  of  existing  services.  Three  elements  are  needed.  First,  through  a  consultative \nprocess, the LG constituency should agree on a vision and set local priorities based on actual \nneeds. Second, the priorities need to be reflected in the financing and expenditure plans. Third, \nan  important  but  sensitive  area  is  to  undertake  consensus  building  with  local  stakeholders  to \ndecide  on  the  future  of  nonfunctioning  schemes  and  take  action  accordingly.  Similarly,  a  plan \nand  process  should  be  put  in  place  to  improve  staff  balance  through  adjustments  in  training, \npositions, postings, and retrenchment. These actions need to be preceded by documentation of \nfacilities  and  staff,  performance  and  needs  assessment,  and  consultation  of  potential \nbeneficiaries and local leaders. \n \n58.    Making  services  more  sustainable  requires  further  support  and  development  of  local \ninstitutions  to  develop  greater  local  autonomy  in  operating  services  based  on  the  principles  of \npartnership. Communities have to take an active role in improving service delivery through local \ninstitutions.  SMCs  need  to  be  further  institutionalized  to  operate  schools,  and  expanded  to \ninclude  secondary  schools.  VDAs  or  private  sector  arrangements  need  to  be  developed  to \nmanage  water  schemes.  SMCs  and  VDAs  need  capacity  building  to  develop  and  implement \nplans,  and  communities  need  to  understand  their  role  in  supporting  the  SMC  and  VDAs  in \nproviding  services.  The  health  sector,  by  the  nature  of  its  business,  is  more  complicated,  but \nalso offer opportunities to establish and strengthen patient associations and health boards, and \ngradually  make  health  services  more  autonomous,  self-sufficient,  and  accountable,  and  thus \nraise standards of health service delivery and mobilize other sources of financing.    \n \n59. \nFunding can be targeted to an area already supported by other sources to supplement \nexisting allocations, or it can be devoted to filling an investment gap, for example, by providing \ncritical infrastructure facilities missing in functional schools or by supporting the extension of the \nscope  of  the  government\u2019s  existing  program  for  providing  stipends  to  include  girls  enrolled  in \nsecondary  grades  (9\u201310),  thereby  addressing  the  issue  of  gender  disparity  and  improving \nretention  rates  among  girls.  A  similar  flexible  approach  will  be  used  in  the  other  sectors.  DGs \nwill be allowed to balance funding between the education and health sectors, and TMAs within \nthe water and sanitation subsectors.   \n \n60. \nFor example, program funds can finance the provision of essential infrastructure lacking \nin  primary  and  middle  schools,  e.g.,  additional  classrooms,  boundary  walls,  toilets,  drinking \nwater  supply,  furniture,  etc.  This  support  will  be  available  if  DGs  can  inventory  the  existing \ninfrastructure  in  schools  under  their  jurisdiction  and  identify  for  each  school  the  basic  facilities \nrequired. Infrastructural improvement that will be allowed should make the school operational, to \nensure that all new schools will be functioning. \n \n61. \nSince program funding will be targeted to specific areas or items from a specific positive \nlist, a system  of  conditional  grants  will  be  set  up  tying  availability  of  funds  to  the  fulfillment  of \ncertain conditions, with performance to be judged on the basis of outcomes (like a 6 percentage \npoint  increase  in  participation  and  completion  rates  by  gender)  in  the  medium  to  long  term, \noutputs (like enrollment levels consistent with the targeted participation rates in the short term), \nor performance with respect to process indicators (like share of education in total expenditure, \nspending  on  nonsalary  items  as  a  proportion  of  the  expenditure  on  education,  timely  release \nand use of funds, and number of schools completed through provision of facilities). To ensure \nthat  the  funds  provided  are  used  for  the  expressed  purposes,  SPG  will  enter  into  contractual \nagreements that define the rules of engagement between the respective LGs and SPG. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16\n\n \n\n \n\nSince the DGs and TMAs will be the implementing agencies for the bulk of the proposed \n62. \nreforms  and  interventions,  the  program  design  proposes  a  strengthening  of  the  financial \nautonomy of the LGs to permit spending on the basis of local needs and priorities, leading to a \nmore  efficient  use  of  scarce  resources.  To  this  end,  funding  for  the  Program  will  need  to  flow \ndirectly  to  the  LGs  through  Account  IV.  23 LGs will agree with SPG on minimal benchmarks to \nensure  that  program  funds  do  not  induce  a  diversion  of  resources  and  just  replace  current  or \nexpected levels of government expenditure on education and health. \n \nB. \n \n63. \nThe policy outcomes and related policy actions are summarized as follows. \n \n\nThe  policy  matrix  is  in  Appendix  4  and  the  development  policy  letter  is  in  Appendix  5. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n1. \n\nFurther Devolve Social Services to Local Governments \n\n64. \nSPG will further devolve administrative and financial powers in the three sectors to DGs \nand TMAs, including development planning, transfers, and financial authority. DGs, in turn, will \nensure proper delegation of responsibilities and authorities of executive district officers to district \nofficers and additional district officers to improve day-to-day management of services.      \n \nSPG will adjust and  strengthen the role of the PLDs to focus on policy reforms, regulate \n65. \nthe  sector,  and  monitor  and  evaluate  sector  performance;  and  will  strengthen  sector training \ninstitutions for capacity building and support of LGs.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImprove Social Sector Financing and Flow of Funds  \n\n66. \nSPG will ensure that  resource allocation for education, health, and water and sanitation \nwill  increase  based  on  an  agreed-upon  benchmark  of  a  30%  share  of  normal  incremental \nspending.  The  flow  of  funds  to  LGs  will  be  improved,  in  that  25%  of  nonsalary  funds  will  be \nreleased within one month of the start of the fiscal year, followed by timely monthly releases.  \n \n67. \nSocial sector allocations will be increased with an additional amount at least equivalent \nto the Asian Development Fund (ADF) contribution. The additional funds will be provided as a \nconditional grant and distributed based on a formula to be approved by the PFC. Funds will be \ntransferred  directly  to  LGs  through  Account  IV.  LGs  will  use  the  additional  funds  according  to \nlocal  priorities  within  certain  defined  parameters.  The  sector  financing  plan  and  targets  are  in \nAppendix 6.  \n \n68. \nSPG  will  establish  simple  guidelines,  criteria,  and  procedures  for  the  use  of  funds \ntransferred to LGs and CBOs. These will include an agreement on the scope of activities to be \nsupported,  and  procedures,  for  using  funds  (such  as  public  announcement  of  available  funds, \nannual  accounts  monitoring,  approved  annual  plan  and  budget  and  possible  matching  grant). \nLGs  will  ensure  that  they  will  adopt  the  general  guidelines  and  procedures  for  financial \nmanagement prepared under the DSP for use in the social sector. SPG will establish a system \nfor  verifying  the  registration  and  bookkeeping  capacity  of  CBOs  to  determine  this  eligibility  for \ntransfer of grant-in-aid, and to actively seek to improve their capacity to make them eligible for \nsupport.  \n \n\n                                                 \n23 Local government account. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n17\n\n3. \n\nPromote Participation, Linkages, and Public Accountability \n\nLGs will (i) maintain accounts in the manner prescribed, monitor services, and produce \n69. \nreports  on  prescribed  format  and  schedules; (ii)  install  procedures  to  improve  monitoring  of \nperformance;  and  (iii)  establish  annual  social  sector  growth  targets,  monitor  compliance, \norganize quarterly public awareness activities, and ensure transparency through public posting \nof LG and CBO performances. SPG will establish a third-party validation system to track the use \nof funds and impact, and ensure additionality of funding.   \n \n \n \n70. \nSPG will raise political and public awareness of the ongoing process to strengthen the \ndevolved social sector in terms of the scope of the program reforms and other important aspects \nof strengthening.    \n \n71. \nLGs will adopt a transparent participatory planning process for the annual planning and \nbudgeting  cycle  for  social  services.  The  LG  will  prepare  sector-specific work plans for social \nservices,  following  the  regular  budgeting  processes  of  getting  approval  from  the  budget  and \ndevelopment committees and seeking approval from the respective councils. SPG will establish \na system for approving conditional grants to DGs and TMAs to allow additional funding for plans \nthat meet eligibility criteria  in terms of stated priorities, scope of interventions, information on all \nmajor  sources  and  uses  of  funds,  compliance  with  basic  planning,  and  implementation  and \nmonitoring arrangements.    \n \n72. \nbudget and social sector committees and other actions agreed to under the GRAP. \n\nLGs will adopt the GRAP and adhere to the targets set for representation of women in \n\nRationalize Services and Set Minimum Standards  \n\n \n4. \n \nSPG  will  promote  targeting  the  poor,  women,  and  vulnerable  groups  and  include  this \n\n73. \nfocus to determine the eligibility of DG and TMA plans.  \n \n74. \nSPG  will  encourage  rational  distribution  of  services,  staff,  and  funds  through  the \nconditional grant mechanism. The LG will enter into partnership agreements with SPG to deliver \na  package  of  basic  services  within  the  sector,  with  funding  from  any  sources,  in  return  for \nreceiving  formula-based  grants  through  Account  IV.  The  plans  will  be  set  within  certain \nparameters  agreed  to  by  LGs,  to  ensure  that  funds  are  spent  on  public  sector  priorities. \nAccordingly,  the  LG  will  prepare  sectoral  work  plans  for  social  services, following the  regular \nbudgeting processes of getting approval from budget and development committees and seeking \napproval from the respective councils.  \n \n75. \nTo  address  the  chronic  yet  critical  issues  of  poor  prioritization,  overcommitment  of \nfinancial resources to new initiatives, and low investments in operation and maintenance, LGs \nshould agree to operationalize existing services where possible before embarking on expansion. \nIn case of opening closed services or new services, the LG will need to submit a technical and \nfinancial feasibility study to demonstrate how the services will be operationalized.  \n \n76. \nSPG  will  permit  selective,  location-specific  recruitment  of  female  teachers  and \nparamedics on merit and contract bases, and improve working conditions for female staff. SPG \nwill  also  implement  plans  to  reduce  staff  absenteeism  and  exploitation,  improve  staff \nmanagement and supervision, and enforce disciplinary decisions.     \n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18\n\n \n\n \n\nSPG  will  develop  interim  policies  for  solid  waste  management  and  rural  drinking  water \n\n77. \nsupply, integrating the uniform policy with the new role of TMAs.    \n \n\n5. \n\nEncourage Public-Private Partnership \n\n \n78. \nSPG  will  prepare  an  overall  plan  to  strengthen  the  role  of  CBOs.  SPG  will improve \nregistration  and  monitoring  of  CBOs  and  improve  their  capacity  to  achieve  the  required \nstandards  and  make  them  eligible  for  funding  through  a  simple  accreditation  and  training \nprocess. Under the TA, SPG will contract NGOs to build the capacity of social services. \n \n79. \nLGs will improve the funding of CBOs. LGs will distribute a share of their additional funds \ndirectly to CBOs (including SMCs, health boards, and VDAs) based on a formula approved by \nPFC. The share to CBOs is expected to increase to 25% of the total flow of funds to LGs. LGs \nwill  ensure  that  funds  allocated  for  SMCs  and  other  CBOs  are  transferred  to  their  accounts \nwithin 2 months of these CBOs becoming eligible for funding. To be eligible for funding, these \nCBOs  must  be  registered  entities  and  sign  a  memorandum  of  understanding  with  the  LG \nstipulating the terms and conditions of use of funds.  \n \n80. \nSMCs  will  receive  funding  to  improve  basic  school  conditions.  While  in  principle  any \neligible SMC can be supported, about two thirds of primary schools already receive Government \nfunding. The Program will support expansion of all SMCs of schools up to grade 12, including \nkindergarten but not colleges. Support to SMCs will be based on the number of pupils in school \nrather than classrooms, so that shelterless schools will also be supported. If the DG so desires, \nnongovernment schools may also be supported. The support will amount to PRs167 per child in \nschool, and will be  used for school operation and maintenance, and to provide textbooks, basic \nequipment, and furniture. SMCs will be allowed to hire teachers on contract basis, and assistant \nteachers for home schools and kindergarten. SMCs will be required to monitor the attendance of \nteachers and pupils.  \n \n81. \nEligible  health  boards,  patients  associations,  or  comparable  CBOs  will  receive  funding \nfor  specific  health  facilities  to  improve  operation  and  maintenance,  including  procurement  of \nequipment  and  supplies.  To  be  eligible,  health  boards  must  be  registered,  use  participatory \nplanning processes, have at least two female members, and maintain proper financial records. \nHealth  boards  will  be  allowed  to  retain  user  fees  and  use  the  earnings  for  the  facility.  There \nshould be clear advertisement of the fee structure and easy waiver arrangements. Examples of \nthese arrangements are in place in Khairpur district, which serves as a model.       \n \n82. \nVDAs and comparable CBOs will receive funding from TMAs to improve small water and \nsanitation  schemes,  offer  hygiene  education,  and  set  up  a  revolving  fund  to  install  household \nlatrines and improve garbage collection. Schools and clinics will be given priority. The subsidy \nwill be linked to population size.    \n \n83. \nDGs  and  TMAs  may  decide  to  use  part  of  the  funds  to  contract  NGOs  and  other  civil \nsociety organizations to improve social services, including  building the capacity of CBOs. While \nseveral competent NGOs are currently working in Sindh, overall capacity remains limited. The \nTA under the Program will, as required, build capacity of these NGOs to support CBOs. LGs will \nalso be supported with the selection and contracting of NGOs. For special purposes, NGOs may \nalso be contracted directly under the TA project.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n19\n\nImportant Features \n\nC. \n \n84. \nGiven  past  experiences,  the  importance  of  supporting  governance  reforms  in  devolved \nsocial  services  cannot  be  underestimated.  The  DSSP  is  primarily  a  governance  program  that \naims  to  build  local  responsibility  and  capacity  to  undertake  effective  planning  and  efficient \nexecution  of  demand-driven  plans  to  address  prioritized  needs  in  the  social  sector.  Technical \napproaches are more or less based on international standards, but may slightly vary from place \nto place according to local circumstances, technical capacity, and funds.    \n \n85. \n \n\nThe Program has four important features:  \n\nThe  Program  provides  for  an  enabling  environment  by  creating  fiscal  space, \nadequate  and  timely  flow  of  funds,  policy  support,  and  linkages  in  the  social \nsector. It provides for an innovative fund flow mechanism by channeling program \nfunds directly to LGs through Account IV.  \n\nThe  Program  offers  flexible  financial  and  technical  support  to  the  LGs  for \nadopting more effective, demand-driven, and participatory planning processes to \nidentify gaps, and rationalize and develop services. \n\nAt  this  early  stage  of  LG,  the  Program  pushes  community  participation  and \npartnership with NGOs. While it may be argued that this step may be premature, \nit  occurs  at  a  time  of  transition  when  routine  has  not  yet  been  established,  and \ngives the opportunity to strengthen the roles of the community and NGOs.  \n\nIn  addition  to  the  built-in  synergies  available  from  the  TA  component,  the \nProgram  provides  for  establishing  linkages  with  a  number  of  ongoing  initiatives \naimed  at  supporting  the  decentralized  system.  Foremost  among  these  is  the \nDSP, which is a program for building the capacity of LGs in basic areas such as \naccounting,  budgeting,  and  auditing  as  well  as  supporting  the  development  of \nnew  institutions  in  the  field  of  governance.  The  DSSP  will  be  implemented  in \nclose  coordination  with  the  DSP  to  ensure  complementarity  of  efforts.  In  fact, \nsome  outcomes  of  the  DSSP  will  ride  on  the  successful  outcomes  of  both  the \nDSP and SAC, the broad-based macro reforms agenda sponsored by the World \nBank. In the case of the DSP, successful implementation of the capacity-building \ninitiatives  in  budgeting  will,  for  example,  enable  the  DSSP  to  add  more  specific \nbudgeting and performance orientation techniques, while the civil service reforms \nand  fiscal  discipline  that  SAC  seeks  to  develop  will  provide  a  more  enabling \nenvironment for the DSSP components. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \nD. \n \n86. \nIn support of the Program, ADB proposes to provide a program loan of Special Drawing \nRights  (SDR)69,843,000  ($100  million  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Fund  resources  (ADF), \nand  a  program  loan  of  \u00a511,968,550,000  ($110  million  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  (OCR).  The  loans  will  support  the  policy  reforms  as  described  in  the  development \npolicy letter and the policy matrix. The resource cost of adjustment is estimated at $255 million \nequivalent over 3 years for devolving administrative powers to the LGs, up-front funding to LGs, \ncapacity building, policy reforms, augmenting and sustaining social services, and public-private \npartnerships. ADB will also support a TA project loan of SDR6,984,000 ($10 million equivalent) \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources (ADF), as described in para. 105 onwards.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20\n\n \n\n \n\nThe  ADF  loan  of  SDR69,843,000  (equivalent  to  $100  million)  will  have  a  term  of  24 \n87. \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  an  interest  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace \nperiod  and  1.5%  thereafter;  and  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and \nProgram  Agreements.  The  TA  loan  of  SDR6,984,000  ($10  million  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; an \ninterest of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter; and other terms and \nconditions as set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. Both loans will be transferred \nfrom  the  Government  to  SPG  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  are  applicable  to  the \nGovernment. The foreign exchange risk shall be borne by SPG. \n \n88. \nThe Government has requested a loan of \u00a511,968,550,000 (equivalent to $110 million) \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the Program. The loan will have a term of \n15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; an interest rate to be determined in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility  (LBL);  including  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum; a front-end fee of 0.5% of the loan amount; and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  as  are  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Program  Agreements.  The \nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for this decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LBL \nfacility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices \nwere its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice \nfrom ADB.  \n \n89. \nThe loans are in support of policy reforms that address long-standing issues in the social \nsector  and  propose  major,  permanent  adjustments  in  the  organization  of  social  services  to \nimprove social sector impact and participation of the poor. The reforms complement the reforms \ncarried out under World Bank\u2019s SAC, ADB\u2019s DSP, and proposed external assistance of the EC \nand USAID. The policy loans are justified by the content and expected impact of policy reforms \nand associated adjustment costs.  \n \nE. \n \n \n \nThe Sindh Finance Department will be the Executing Agency and will be responsible for \n90. \noverall  program  planning,  coordination,  monitoring,  and  TA  support.  The  Sindh  Planning  and \nDevelopment  Department  and  PLDs  will  plan,  implement  and  monitor  sector-specific  policy \nreforms. DGs will be the implementing agencies for the conditional grant support to DGs for the \neducation and health sectors, and TMAs for WSS. LGs will assume responsibility for CBOs as \ndevelopment partners and monitor their activities. Appendix 7 shows the program organization \nand responsibilities.   \n \nSPG will establish a steering committee to be chaired by the Additional Chief Secretary, \n91. \nPlanning and Development, and with members of the finance and line departments, DGs, TMAs \nand  civil  society.  The  committee  will  be  responsible  for  overall  strategic  guidance,  program \ncoordination,  monitoring,  and  reporting  to  SPG.  At  least  two  women  will  be  members  of  the \nsteering committee. The committee will advise the PFC on the distribution and use of funds.      \n \n92.      A  program  support  unit  (PSU)  will  be  established  in  the  Finance  Department  for  the \npurpose of program management and monitoring, and TA management. There will be 16 local \nsupport units (LSUs) supporting all districts and all TMAs in Sindh. The director of the PSU will \nbe a senior government officer not below grade 19. The PSU will have a Program coordinator \nwho may be a Government official or may be engaged on contract basis.   \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nExecuting Agency \n\n1. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n21\n\n2. \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\nThe program support and policy reforms will be implemented over 3 years, and will be \n\n \n \n93. \ncompleted on 1 February 2007.   \n \n \n \n94. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  finance  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  items  produced  in  and \nprocured from ADB member countries, excluding listed ineligible items and imports financed by \nother multilateral and bilateral sources (Appendix 8 lists the ineligible items). The Borrower will \ncertify  that  (i)  if  the  loan  proceeds  will  finance  goods  already  imported,  the  volume  of  eligible \nimports in the period concerned will exceed the amount of the requested withdrawal, or (ii) if the \nloan  proceeds  finance  items  to  be  imported,  the  value  of  the  eligible  imports  immediately \npreceding  a  1-year  period  will  be  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  requested \nwithdrawal  plus  all  other  amounts  expected  to  be  withdrawn  from  the  loan  account  during  the \nsucceeding  1-year  period.  The  program  loans  will  be  used  for  3  years,  1  February  2004\u20131 \nFebruary 2007. Disbursement will be made under the simplified procedures for program loans, \napproved by the ADB\u2019s Board on 16 April 1998. \n \n\n4. \n\nUse of Counterpart Funds \n\n \n95. \nCounterpart funds generated by loan proceeds will be used to provide budgetary support \nfor  devolved  social  services.  The  ADF  program  loan  of  $100  million  equivalent  and  OCR \nprogram loan of $110 million equivalent will be used over 3 years and released in periods of at \nleast one year, in three tranches\u2014the equivalent of $100 million, $70 million, and $40  million\u2014\nupon fulfillment of the respective conditions shown in the policy matrix (Appendix 4).  \n \n96. \nSPG,  through  the  steering  committee,  will  monitor  the  implementation  of  reforms \nenvisaged under the DSSP. Each year, SPG and ADB will carry out a policy review to assess \nthe achievement of policy reforms. Monitoring will also be an ongoing exercise through the PSU \nand LSUs, and through support from DSP. Monitorable and time-bound actions are reflected in \nthe policy matrix.       \n \n97. \nSPG will use the counterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the policy loans to \nfinance costs associated with implementing the package of policy reforms. SPG will include the \ncounterpart funds in the provincial consolidated fund (rather than outside the budget), under the \nprovincial  allocable  component  for  onward  distribution  to  LGs.  SPG  has  agreed  to  make \nprogram funds available as an additionality to be passed on as grant to DGs,  TMAs, and CBOs \nbased on a PFC-approved formula. SPG and ADB will set financial benchmarks and targets and \nmonitor the use of counterpart funds by tracking funds flow from PFC to LGs to beneficiaries. \nAnalyzing  the  distribution  and  use  of  funds  for  the  gender  and  poverty  reduction  goals  will \nreceive special attention. Appendix 9 summarizes the use of program funds.      \n \n98.  \nThe flow of funds has been elaborated in the policy actions. LGs will use the counterpart \nfunds in a flexible manner among the three sectors based on a participatory planning process to \nmeet the particular needs and priorities of the citizens. While LGs will be automatically eligible \nfor their formula-based allocations, there will be conditions on the use of funds to reinforce the \npolicy  reforms.  Overall  conditions  follow:  (i)  participatory  planning  will  include  female \nrepresentation  in  decision-making  bodies;  (ii)  plans  rationalize  the  scope  and  distribution  of \nservices, (iii) benefits will be targeted to poor populations, particularly women; (iv) plans have to \nfit the overall expenditure plan of the LG, and (v) monitoring and accounting arrangements are \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22\n\n \n\n \n\nin place. The annual plans will clearly show that the funds do not replace any other funds, and \nthat  regular  allocations  for  social  services  are  at  least  maintained  at  previous  levels.  Through \nworkshops,  SPG  will  finalize  with  LGs  the  overall  conditions  and  activities  for  which  the  funds \nmay be used, update these annually, and perhaps add conditions and incentives related to the \ndistribution of resources among locations, components and categories. However, the aim is to \nkeep funding as flexible as possible so as to encourage ownership. Joint review processes will \nneed to strike a careful balance between local autonomy and efficient use of resources.     \n \nIf LG performance is not satisfactory, the steering committee may decide to suspend the \n99.  \nflow  of  funds  to  the  concerned  LG  until  satisfactory  arrangements  have  been  put  in  place. \nDistribution  of  funds  to  CBOs  will  be  based  on  yearly  verification  of  their  needs-based, \ntransparent,  and  accountable  use  of  funds.  For  this  purpose,  CBOs  will  need  to  meet  certain \nbasic  requirements  like  having  books  of  account  that  can  be  audited,  and  record  of  staff \nattendance and utilization. Funds allocated to LGs, if unused, will lapse at the end of the fiscal \nyear and may be redistributed among the active LGs. CBOs funds may be retained for 2 years.  \nFunds allocated to CBOs may not be used or retained by LGs.     \n    \n100.  The LGs may also use the conditional grant for PPP with NGOs or the private sector, or \nseek support from provincial institutions for capacity building. This would need to be indicated in \nthe annual plan and otherwise fulfill certain criteria of scope, qualifications, accounts and audit.        \n \n \n \n101.  Prior  to  withdrawal,  Government  will  open  an  account  at  State  Bank  of  Pakistan  to \nreceive all loan proceeds. The account will be established, managed, operated, and liquidated \nin accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. The PSU will submit to ADB quarterly reports on \nthe policy reform measures.     \n \n102.  The inception report and quarterly reports must reach ADB not later than 6 weeks after \nthe  due  date.  The  annual  reports  and  program  completion  reports  must  reach  ADB  not  later \nthan 3 months after the due date. Based on an agreed-upon format, the reports will summarize \nprogress made in narrative form and according to key input and process indicators, corrective \nactions as necessary, and plans for the next period.  \n \n\nAuditing and Reporting \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nProgram Performance Management System \n\n103.  Closely linked to the DSP, program performance monitoring and evaluation will develop \na  system  to  monitor  SPG  inputs  (counterpart  funds,  sector  financing,  policy  reforms, \nrecruitments,  etc.)  based  on  reports,  sector  output  indicators  (disaggregated  utilization  and \nother indicators) using existing monitoring systems, and coverage and impact indicators based \non surveys that are disaggregated by districts. For the water sector, a separate monitoring and \nevaluation  instrument  will  be  developed.  The  PSU  will  be  responsible  for  the  program \nperformance  management  system,  including  monitoring  sector  financing,  policy  actions,  and \nprogram  indicators  based  on  the  policy  matrix.  At  quarterly  intervals,  the  PSU  will  prepare  a \nreport for the steering committee for review and action. SPG will support a basic record system \nto monitor funding and progress of DG, TMAs and CBOs to coordinate social sector financing. \nWorkshops,  field  visits,  and  other  participatory  activities  will  be  carried  out  to  consult \nstakeholders on progress.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n23\n\n \n\n7. \n\nProgram Review \n\n \n \n104.  SPG (PSU) will forward key reports of the program performance management system to \nADB  on  a  quarterly  basis.  SPG  will  also  prepare  the  inception  report,  quarterly  and  annual \nprogress  reports,  and  a  program  completion  report.  The  reports  will  use  clear  and  well-\ndocumented  indicators  for  monitoring  policy  reforms,  use  of  counterpart  funds,  and  program \nperformance. The Program focus on institutional reforms is complex and needs intensive follow-\nup and dialogue with SPG. ADB will carry out an inception mission, biannual review missions, \nand  a  program  completion  mission.  SPG  and  ADB,  with  the  assistance  of  an  independent \nexpert, will conduct a comprehensive midterm review in the last quarter of the second year of \nimplementation to evaluate progress with policy reforms including financial flows, LG activities, \npublic-private  initiatives,  service  delivery,  and  coverage  of  services.  During  each  mission, \nfindings will be discussed with SPG and an action plan agreed to. Similar to the DSP, the DSSP \nwill have an annual performance review to determine program progress, compliance with policy \nconditions for the tranche releases, and Government and ADB efforts; and agree on a plan of \naction. The review will use a participatory process with field visits, or may use the services of a \nconsultant to make an initial field assessment.     \n \n \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n\n \nA. \n\nObjectives \n \n\n105.  The  TA  aims  to  (i)  strengthen  sector  and  program  management  and  monitoring,  (ii) \ndevelop LGs and CBO governance capacity in social services, and (iii) support sector work on \nspecific  policy  reforms  to  improve  sector  performance.  This  includes  support  to  strengthen \nlinkages  and  cooperation  between  stakeholders,  establish  proper  accounting  practices, and \nmonitoring and evaluation of sector financing and performance. \n  \nB. \n\nComponents and Output \n\n1. \n\nProgram and Sector Management and Monitoring  \n\n2. \n\nGovernance Capacity Building  \n\n106.  The TA will support the PSU and LSUs to ensure that all initiatives envisioned under the \nDSSP  are  carried  out  as  per  the  agreed-upon  Policy  matrix.  The  PSU  will  be  responsible  for \nprogram  monitoring  and  TA  implementation.  The  PSU  and  LSUs  will  collaborate  with  LGs  to \ntrack  sector  financing  and  monitor  financial  management.  The  PSU  will  also  monitor  and \nevaluate sector performance using existing management information systems, improve these as \nappropriate, and work with other agencies conducting surveys.  \n \n \n \n107.  The  TA  will  support  capacity  building  for  the  social  sectors,  initially  through  PSU  and \nLSUs, but also through provincial training institutions, thereby supplementing efforts undertaken \nby the DSP and SAC, and efforts to be undertaken by EC and USAID in education. The PSU \nwill  organize  awareness  campaigns  about  the  poverty  reduction  strategy  and  devolved  social \nservices.  LSUs  will  strengthen  LGs  in  the  areas  of  annual  planning  and  budgeting  for  social \nservices  using  a  participatory  approach,  gender  mainstreaming,  sector  management  and \nmonitoring,  financial  management  as  required,  strengthening  linkages  of  governments  and \ncommunities, and capacity building of CBOs including SMCs, health boards and VDAs. The TA \nmay also support NGOs to prepare them for capacity building of CBOs or special services.     \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24\n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nSector-Specific Reforms \n\n \n \n108.  PLDs will be assisted to examine a range of policy issues in the social sector and work \non  specific  policy  reforms.  In  education,  this  includes  the  functioning  of  SMCs,  contracting \nteachers, and affordability of education.  In  the  health  sector,  the  critical  activity  is  to  establish \nhealth boards and patients associations to strengthen local participation in managing services. \nStudies  will  examine  contracting  arrangements  for  staff  and  PPP,  improving  the  financial \nsustainability of health facilities, and rationalizing and operationalizing closed health facilities. In \nthe WSS, technical support will support monitoring systems, categorizing schemes, consumer \nsurveys,  and  preparing  master  plans  for  TMAs.  Based  on  studies  and  using  a  participatory \nprocess,  interim  policies  for  the  sector  will  be  prepared,  including  policies  for  drinking  water \nsupply, and solid waste management in general and health facilities in particular.       \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nC. \n\n109.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $14.2  million  equivalent,  comprising  $1.9  million  (13%)  in \nforeign exchange and $12.3 million equivalent (87%) in local currency cost (Appendix 10).  ADB \nwill provide a loan of SDR6,984,000 from its Special Funds resources to finance up to 70% of \nthe  total  TA  cost.  The  loan  will  cover  the  total  foreign  exchange  cost  and  an  estimated  $8.1 \nmillion equivalent in local currency cost (66% of the total local currency cost). The term of the \nproposed loan will be 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period, and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the draft Technical Assistance Loan and Project Agreements. SPG \nwill  finance  $4.2  million  equivalent  of  the  TA  cost  for  rental  facilities  and  utilities,  counterpart \nstaff, communication, grants for civil society organizations, training and workshops, and taxes.   \n \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n \n1. \n \n\nExecuting Agency \n\n110.  The  Finance  Department,  Sindh,  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The  structure  for  TA \nsupervision is similar to that for the program loan. The TA will be managed by the PSU, as per \nadvice of the steering committee. In all DGs and TMAs, local counterparts will be identified to \nwork with the PSU and LSUs.    \n \n\nImplementation Period \n\n111.  The TA will be implemented for 4 years and be completed by 1 February 2008.      \n \n\nProcurement \n\n112.  All ADB-financed procurement for the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement.  Contract  packages  for  $500,000  equivalent  or  less  will  follow  international \nshopping  procedures,  except  for  vehicles,  which  may  be  procured  through  local  competitive \nbidding  (LCB).  Minor  packages  costing  $100,000  equivalent  or  less  may  be  procured  through \nLCB or direct purchase, as per SPG standard Procurement, acceptable to ADB.  \n \n \n \n113.  The  TA  will  require  consulting  services  of  36  person-months  (international)  and  1,926 \n(domestic).    Under  the  TA,  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  be  recruited  by  SPG \n\nConsulting Services \n\n4.  \n\n2. \n \n\n3. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n25\n\naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for the engaging domestic consultants. The international level program coordinator will \nbe hired as an individual on contract basis.24 The domestic consultants (with person-months) of \nthe PSU include a finance and governance specialist (33), a poverty and gender specialist (24), \na  capacity  building  and  training  specialist  (24),  a  community  organization  specialist  (24),  a \ncontracting  and  personnel  management  specialist  (24),  and  a  monitoring  and  evaluation \nspecialist  (33).  The  LSUs  will  include  finance  and  governance  experts  (528),  engineers  (528), \nand  monitoring  and  evaluation  experts  (528).  The  sector  reform  units  will  be  supported  by \neconomists  (72),  an  education  reform  specialist  (24),  a  health  sector  reform  specialist  (24),  a \nwater supply engineer (36), and an environment/solid waste management specialist (24). The \ndistrict consultants will be recruited through firms. The other consultants will be recruited either \nas  individuals  or  through  firms.  The  terms  of  reference  of  consulting  services  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix C. \n \n\nDisbursements and Reporting \n\n5. \n \n\n114.  SPG will open a dollar imprest account at the National Bank of Pakistan within 3 months \nof  loan  effectiveness.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and \nliquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Handbook on Loan Disbursements,  as amended from time \nto time. ADB will advance 6 months of estimated expenditures (about $1 million) into the imprest \naccount.  The  ADB  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  will  be  used  to  liquidate  and  replenish \nthe imprest account for individual payments not exceeding $50,000.   \n \n115.  SPG  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  the  imprest  fund  and  TA \nexpenditures in accordance with sound accounting principles. SPG will have such accounts and \nrecords audited by external auditors in accordance with standards acceptable to ADB. Certified \ncopies of audited accounts will be submitted to ADB within 9 months after the close of the fiscal \nyear.  \n \n116.  As  in  the  program  loans,  SPG  will  submit  the  inception  report  and  quarterly  reports  to \nADB  within  6  weeks  of  the  end  of  the  reporting  period.  In  addition,  SPG  will  submit to ADB \nannual reports and a TA completion report within 3 months of the end of the reporting period. \nBased on an agreed-upon format, the reports will summarize progress made in narrative form, \nprovide key input and process indicators, propose corrective actions as necessary, and propose \nplans  for  the  next  period.  The  annual  and  TA  completion  reports  will  include  a  summary \nfinancial account of the TA. SPG will ensure that the submission of reports, audited accounts, \nand financial statements comply with ADB\u2019s revised guidelines of 1998.  \n \n117.  The  Provincial  Steering  Committee  and  ADB  will  monitor  the  TA  as  an  integral  part  of \nthe program performance management system. The TA inputs, process, and output indicators \nwill  be  monitored  to  determine  how  they  affect  impact.  Capacity  building  requirements  will  be \ncontinuously monitored and reassessed so that capacity building can be tracked as an ongoing \nprocess.     \n \n118.  ADB  will  combine  TA  reviews  with  program  reviews  (para.  104).  The  missions will pay \nspecial attention to the capacity of the PSU and the LSU; the hiring and preparation of experts; \nand  the  work  of  experts,  including  the  time  spent  working  with  Government  counterparts, \n\n   \n\n                                                 \n24 A  separate  advisory  technical  assistance  grant  of  $400,000  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  program  for  2004  to \n\nfinance international advisers on social sector reform.     \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26\n\n \n\n \n\nworking  with  councils  to  improve  participatory  planning processes, and working with DGs and \nTMAs  to  improve  their  planning,  procurement,  management,  and  monitoring  activities.  After \nthese reviews, modifications of scope and implementation arrangements may be proposed.       \n \n \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nProgram Benefits   \n\nto  clarify  responsibilities  and \n\nA. \n \n119.  Social  Sector  Financing.  The  DSSP  will  result  in  an  increased  budget  for  the  social \nsector, a new funding mechanism for devolved social services, and better cash flow. Qualifying \nSMCs, health boards and water associations will be financed directly. SPG will also give grants \nto NGOs to build the capacity of CBOs and other activities. Water charges will be rationalized to \nmake them more pro-poor and consumption-driven in the case of water.        \n \n120.  Participatory  Planning.  The  DSSP  will  increase  capabilities  and  the  participation  of \ncommon  and  special  councilors  in  decision-making  bodies  in  DGs,  TMAs,  and  UAs.  Special \nattention  will  be  given  to  the  participation  of  female  councilors.  Efforts  will  be  made to ensure \nadequate representation of civil society and NGOs in district planning activities. Mechanisms will \nbe  set  up \nimprove  collaboration  among  political \nrepresentatives and bureaucrats and improve coordination of development activities.       \n \n121.  Rationalization of Services.  The TA will provide major support for building the capacity \nof DGs, TMAs, UAs, and CBOs to undertake proper planning, implementation, and monitoring \nand thus ensure efficient, equitable, and effective use of limited resources. Each district, and in \nthe  case  of  the  water  sector,  each  TMA  will  directly  be  supported  by  experts  who  will  provide \nhands-on experience in this field.       \n \n122.  Community Organizations.  SPG  will  use  the TA fund to build the capacity of CBOs, \nSMCs, health boards, and VDAs, to qualify them as recipients of SPG financing to improve local \nsocial  services.  Qualifying  organizations  will  eventually  be  allowed  to  operate  their  own \nservices,  including  contracting  of  staff.  Such  community  organization  will  also  benefit  other \nsectors and overall improve devolution and governance in the public sector.       \n \nB. \n\nthus \n\n \n\nImpacts \n \n1. \n \n\nSocial Sector Impact \n\n123.  The Program will result in higher school participation and completion rates, especially of \ngirls, due to (i) better access to schools for village children, (ii) contracting of female teachers, \n(iii)  better  school  conditions,  and  (iv)  more  affordable  secondary  schools.  Similarly,  improved \naccess  to  female  health  staff  and  field  workers,  will  improve  reproductive  health,  and  reduce \nmaternal  mortality,  and  curb  fertility  through  noninvasive  methods.  The  improvement  and \nreopening  of  schools  and  clinics  and  provision  of  accessible  clean  drinking  water  will  have  a \nmajor  impact  on  the  social  status  of  the  population.  The  currently  sourced  water  is  generally \nunfit for human consumption and carries the risk of waterborne diseases. Poor-quality water is \nresponsible  for  high  levels  of  infant  mortality,  while  high  levels  of  morbidity  cause  frequent \nschool absenteeism in children and loss of workdays for adults. The availability of basic services \nand  clean  water  will  create  better  living  conditions  for  the  people  and  will  enhance  their \nproductivity levels.  SPG aims to increase gross primary enrollment from 65% to 80%, increase \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n27\n\n2. \n\nPoverty and Gender Impact \n\nrural  access  to  safe  drinking  water  from  24  %  to  30%,  increase  full  immunization  coverage  of \nchildren from 50% to 85%, and reduce infant mortality from 80 to 70 per 1,000 live births.    \n     \n \n \n124.  Support for social services, devolution, and community participation and organization will \nhave  a  positive  impact  on  the  poor.  Funding,  access,  and  quality  of  social  services  are  all \nexpected to improve. More chiIdren will go to school, and receive better-quality education, which \nwill have an impact on the entire family. Better health care should also reduce income erosion \nand  improve  productivity.  The  Program  is  targeting  all  districts  in  Sindh  by  supporting  public \nsocial services used mostly by the poor. The majority of the beneficiaries are likely to be poor. \nThe summary poverty impact of policy actions is in Appendix 11.    \n \n125.  Female  councilors  will  be  assisted  to  learn  how  to  participate  in  council  meetings  and \nplanning activities. Many LGs and CBOs are keen to hire female teachers and paramedics, and \nimprove schools, and health and water and sanitation services that will particularly benefit girls. \nThe Program\u2019s impact will be monitored through surveys, including equity indicators.   \n \n126.  The Program and TA activities are intended to improve governance in the social sector. \nThe  result  should  be  more  pro-poor  allocation  and  more  efficient  use  of  resources.  Improved \ngovernance also involves disciplinary actions against poorly performing staff. Retrenchment of \nsome staff can be expected, with a possible adverse impact on their families. Currently, water \ncharges are deducted at source, and are invisible for some who do not pay any charges. The \npractice, however, often results in poor services and waste of funds that could be used for other \nservices.  Overall,  the  price  of  water  services  is  expected  to  fall  and  be  linked  to  actual \nconsumption.  The  water  experts  will  carry  out  a  consumer  survey  and  participator  planning \nprocess to assess the implications of proposed pricing reforms on the poor and how they can be \naddressed. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \n       \n \n127.  SPG  is  increasing  social sector spending under the PRSP to achieve its social sector \ngoals. The DSSP requires SPG to approve additional funds for the social sector, improve cash \nflow,  and  provide  up-front  financing.  The  program  costs  to  the  Government  are  $45  million \nhigher than the size of the program loans during the program period. SPG hopes to finance the \ncosts through debt reduction and a tax increase averaging 15% per year. It is believed that the \neconomic  returns  from  better  education,  health,  and  drinking  water  nearby  will  outweigh  the \ncosts of the tax increase. With infrastructure and salaries already paid for, a modest increase in \ntargeted spending for quality enhancing actions will greatly improve use and efficiency.  \n \n\nFinancial and Economic Impacts \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\nInstitutional Impact  \n\n \n128.  The  Program  will  contribute  to  the  overall  devolution  reform  process.  Foremost,  it  will \nstrengthen  LGs  to  contribute  to  one  of  the  largest  institutional  transition  in  Pakistan.  It  is \nexpected  to  have  a  major  impact  on  governance  in  the  social  sector  and  will  help  create a \nfavorable environment for improved transparency and accountability, empowerment of common \ncitizens,  and  the  rule  of  law.  The  Program  will  particularly  help  strengthen  and  increase  the \nnumber  of  CBOs\u2014including  SMCs,  health  boards,  and  VDAs.  Through  opportunities for PPP, \nthe Program will also strengthen local NGOs, and thereby help to expand the private sector.  \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5. \n\n1. \n\nRisks \n\nPolitical Risks \n\nEnvironmental Aspects  \n\n \n \n129.  The  DSSP  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  Apart  from  hospital  and  health \ncenter  wastes,  and  water  supply,  sanitation  and  garbage  collection,  no  major  environmental \nhazards are anticipated. The Environmental Protection Agency of SPG and the PSU, supported \nby  a  consultant,  will  prepare  environmental  plans  for  managing  hospital  and  health  center \nwastes  and  for  other  types  of  facilities  and  operations.  They  will  ensure  that  environmental \nmeasures are included in upgrading the operations of district health agencies and other types of \nservices  to  avoid  significant  environmental  impacts.  The  environmental assessment summary \nincluding  an  assessment  of  the  policy  actions  and  an  environmental  management  plan  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix D.   \n \nC. \n \n \n \n130.  Sindh\u2019s  political  instability,  and  therefore  sustained  commitment  to  the  devolution and \ngovernance  reform  agenda,  is  considered  a  major  risk  for  the  Program.  There are dissenting \nvoices  among  provincial  stakeholders.  Major  issues  in  Sindh  are  the  sharp  urban-rural divide, \nand resistance of those in control to giving up old privileges. That majority of the elected council \nheads  and  deputy  heads  are  from  landed  families  highlights  the  danger  of  capture  of  DGs  by \nlocal  elites,  and  subsequent  continuation  of  privileges.  While  there  are  early  signs  of \nimprovement, the conceptual framework of structural changes leading to greater accountability \nat the local level still needs to be demonstrated. Much exchange of ideas and clarification will be \nneeded to ensure political support at all levels and put a transparent and fair system in place.  \n \n \n \n131.  The  economic  and  financial  risks  are  considered  less  prominent.  There  are  sector \nfinancing risks linked to the economy, as was experienced during the SAP, which was seriously \naffected by the fiscal crisis of the 1990s. Continuing lack of funds resulted in staff shortages and \nlack  of  nonsalary  recurrent  allocations \nthe  services.  The  current \nmacroeconomic picture looks much better  given Pakistan\u2019s overall international and economic \nperformance  in  the  past  few  years,  a  healthy  budget  surplus,  fair  economic  growth,  and \nexpected  reduction  of  debt  to  4.5%  of  GDP  in  FY2003  and  4.0%  in  FY2004.  However, \ncontinuing economic growth will  depend  on  a  benign  external  environment  for  debt  servicing \nand investment, which is tied to the political situation in Pakistan. Furthermore, the drought of \nthe past few years demonstrated Pakistan\u2019s dependency on ecological conditions and the water \nresource management systems. The resulting increase in rural poverty is believed to have had \na major negative impact on school enrollment. The serious levels of poverty in rural areas and \nurban slums, in combination with social inequity, pose major program constraints.                     \n \n \n  \n132.  The  federal  Government  decided  to  opt  for  fast-track  devolution  with  remarkable \npolitical,  administrative,  and  fiscal  restructuring;  development  of  new  systems  and  guidelines; \nand  training  of  administrators  and  councilors,  all  within  the  span  of  1  year.  However,  the \ndevolved system still needs to be fully operationalized and PLDs should provide full support. A \nmajor concern is the limited capacity of the LGs and CBOs.  Major capacity-building efforts that \nwill  benefit  the  social  sector  are  underway,  but  specific  support  for  capacity  building  in  the \ndevolved social sector is largely lacking. In particular the capacity of CBOs is of concern.  \n\nEconomic and Financial Risks   \n\nCapacity Constraints   \n\nthat  undermined \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n29\n\n \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\n

the  Government  and  SPG  have  given  the \n\n133. \nfollowing assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nSPG  commits  to  give  devolved  social  services  appropriate  administrative, \nfinancial,  and  operational  autonomy  and  agrees  that  for  areas  where  powers \nhave  not  yet  been  devolved,  a  transition  arrangement  will  be  designed \naccording

With a population of 35 million and for its imperative socioeconomic growth, \nthe  province  of  Sindh  faces  the  immense  challenge  of  rampant  illiteracy.    Sindh's  literacy \nrate is 46%, the same as the nation's . The rural literacy rate is much lower than the urban \nrate, and for females it is much lower than for males (40% versus 13% in rural areas, and \n72% versus 52% in urban areas).  \n \n2. \nThe education sector under the Department of Education and Literacy is the biggest \ndevolved  sector  in  Sindh.  As  in  other  sectors,  there  is  much  disparity  between  urban  and \npoorer rural and slum areas and male and female students and teachers. Table A2.1 gives \nthe  distribution  of  schools,  students  and  services  according  to  the  Sindh  Education \nManagement Information census 2001\u20132002. \n \n\nTable A2.1: Public Education Establishments in Sindh \n\nLevel \n\nPrimary \nMiddle \nSecondary \nHigher Secondary \nIntermediate \nDegree \nPostgraduate \nProfessional \n\nTotal \n\nSchools  \n(no.) \n39,176 \n  2,240 \n 1,480 \n    139 \n     29 \n   158 \n       7 \n       6 \n      43,235 \n\nTeachers \n(no.) \n97,237 \n   9,691 \n 29,297 \n   4,106 \n      485 \n   4,640 \n      456 \n      104 \n      147,016 \n\nStudents \n(no.) \n2,309,222 \n   130,472 \n   511,558 \n   105,917 \n     13,146 \n   149,581 \n        8,873 \n        4,843 \n     3,233,612 \n\nSource: Education Monitoring Information System, Government of Sindh.              \n\n \n \n3. \nThere  are  about  7,000  private  schools  and  educational  institutions.  The  95.5%  of \nprivate  enrollment  in  Sindh  is  in  urban  areas.  Local nongovernment organizations (NGOs) \noperate  1\u20132 classroom-type  schools  in  villages.  Enrollment  indicators  over  the  past  years \nhave not changed. In addition to poor primary schools participation, there is a sudden drop in \nmiddle school attendance (Table A2.2).  \n \n\nTable A2.2: Total Net Enrolment Rates in Sindh \n\n \n\nType \nSchools \n \n \nSchools/College \nCollege \n \n\n \nLevel \n\nPrimary \nMiddle \nSecondary \nIntermediate \nDegree \nPostgraduate \n\n \nAge \n4\u20139 \n10\u201312 \n13\u201314 \n15\u201316 \n17\u201318 \n19\u201320 \n\nParticipation Rate (%) \nGirls \n34 \n15 \n16 \n13 \n   3 \n   0 \n\nTotal \n40 \n16 \n19 \n13 \n   3 \n   0 \n\nBoys \n46 \n18 \n21 \n13 \n  2 \n  0 \n\n             Source: Education Monitoring Information System, Government of Sindh.              \n \n4. \nKey Issues. Low participation rate is linked to the quality of education, poverty, and \nsocial  constraints.  Economic  stagnation  and  drought  of  the  past  few  years  have  caused \nstagnating enrollment. Similar to the findings of a study in Punjab,1 poverty in Sindh is seen \nas the main reason for children not attending school (Table A2.3). Other factors in Sindh are \nwalking distance, security, lack of basic amenities, and teacher absenteeism (in part due to \nprohibitive transport costs).    \n          \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Multidonor Support Unit. 2002.

Establishing SMCs has been the major initiative \n5. \nfor  improving  schools.  About  33%  have  received  grants  from  the  Government,  and  25% \nhave been able to mobilize additional funds from their respective communities. As the funds \nare linked to the number of classrooms, Government grants are biased against shelterless \nschools.  In  many  SMCs,  the  head  teacher  usually  decides  how  the  Government  grants \nshould  be  used,  rather  than  encouraging  parents  to  participate  in  decision  making.  Most \ncouncils  find  the  list  of  eligible  expenditure  categories  too  narrow  and  rigid  and  demand \ngreater flexibility in the use of funds.        \n   \n6. \nFacilities. School buildings are generally poor in rural areas compared with those in \nurban  areas  and  private  schools.  Of  the  15,000  shelterless  schools  in  rural  areas,  about \n3,100  are  being  upgraded  with  World  Bank  assistance.  Many  schools  in  urban  areas  are \novercrowded,  with  children  sitting  on  the  veranda,  under  the  trees,  and  on  the  roof.  The \neasier way to increase school enrollment is no doubt adding classrooms in urban areas, as \ndemand is high and teachers are in surplus. Lack of amenities, furniture, and maintenance \nare  problems  affecting  most  government  schools.  The  supply  of  textbooks  to  primary \nschools has improved with external assistance, and could be expanded to higher grades.  \n   \n7. \nHuman Resources. Even if 33\u201340% of posts were vacant, a ban on recruitment was \nmaintained  during  Social  Action  Program  (Sector)  Project  II,  as  part  of  public  sector \nrationalization.  This  was  expected  to  deal  with  surplus  teachers.  However,  due  to  politics, \npoor rural working conditions, and lack of incentives, redeployment has not been successful. \nIrregular transfer practices continue. The Government is now planning to introduce a policy \nof  exclusive  female  teachers  for  primary  schools,  so  as  to  make  coeducation  more \naccessible to girls. Hiring of  teachers on contract basis and from the community should also \nhelp  in  reducing  staff  absenteeism.  However,  there  is  no  evidence  to  suggest  that  locally \nhired  teachers,  including  for  private  schools,  perform  better.  Supervision,  monitoring,  and \ndisciplinary action are also needed.   \n \nQuality  of  Education.  Primary  instruction is notoriously poor (parrot method) and \n8. \nhas probably deteriorated. Many teachers are untrained. The Government is now following a \npolicy  of  hiring  matriculate  graduates  as  teachers  and  training  them  through  in-service \ntraining, rather than preservice training. However, the performance of trained teachers is not \nmuch  better,  for  a  variety  of  reasons.  Enrollment  data  are  misleading,  as  attendance  is \nusually much lower. Monitoring of pupil and teacher attendance is a priority. The curriculum \nand examination system need to be updated (this is a federal responsibility).   \n \n\n \n\n\f36\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nFinancing.  Education  up  to  class  10  has  been  made  free  in  Government  schools. \n9. \nUnder the World Bank\u2019s structural adjustment credit, the budget for education has increased. \nIn  2002\u20132003,  PRs19.9  billion  was  allocated  for  education:  PRs16.5  billion  for  salaries, \nPRs1.6  billion  for  nonsalary  recurrent  expenditures,  and  PRs1.6  billion  for  development \nexpenditures. The budget for primary school SMCs increased from PRs1.1 billion in 2001\u2013\n2002 to PRs4.5 billion in 2002\u20132003, on the basis of PRs167 per child per year for use on a \nneed basis. This does not include support for katchi class, shelterless schools, and class 6 \nupward.  PRs180  million  was  spent  to  distribute  free  textbooks  to  students  of  all  primary \nschools, and PRs270 million on scholarships for girl students of middle schools (classes 6\u2013\n8)  at  PRs100  per  child  per  month.  PRs50  million  from  the  regular  budget  of  2002\u20132003  is \nallocated to districts for teacher training.   \n \n10. \nPolicy.  The  National  Policy  of  Education,  1998\u20132010,  aims  for  universal  primary \neducation with 100% net participation, quality and functionality in the secondary stage with \nparticipation  increased  to  50%,  greater  emphasis  on  rural  female  education,  and \nimprovement in quality to meet the demands of the job market by 2004.  Targets continue to \nbe  high,  such  as  increasing  net  enrolment  rate  from  65%  in  2001  to  75%  in  2004,  and \nincreasing literacy from 47% to 60% in the same period. For a holistic approach to education \na sector-wide strategy entailing legislative, administrative, and financial actions at all levels \nhas  been  adopted. 2 The Education  Sector  Reforms  for  2001\u20132004,  a  3-year  action  plan  to \nimplement  the  policy,  includes  Literacy  through  Education  for  All  supported  by  the \nCompulsory Primary Education Ordinance. It includes  resource  mobilization  including  debt \nswap  for  education,  decentralization  under  the  devolution  plan,  public -private  partnership \nand  community  participation.  Its  actions  include  generating  political  will,  mainstreaming \nmadrassahs, 3  introducing  outcome-based  planning  and  budgeting,  and  demand-based \neducation.   \n \n11. \nPriority investments are (i) support for SMCs ($20 million), (ii) construction of 3,000 \nshelterless  schools  ($30  million),  (iii)  reopening  of  5,000  closed  schools  ($5  million),  (iv) \nupgrading primary schools to elementary schools ($150 million), (v) change of 1,000 schools \nto  English  medium  ($10  million),  and  (vi)  upgrading  of  middle  school  to  secondary  school \n($150 million per school). In- service teacher training is earmarked for major grant financing.        \n \nB. \n \n12. \nStatus. Sindh\u2019s important health indices are not good. Infant and child mortality rates \nper  1,000  live  births  are  85  and  103,  respectively,  in  particular  due  to  diarrhea  and \nrespiratory  infections.  About  40%  of  children  under  the  age  of  5  years  are  malnourished. \nOne  quarter  of  children  are  born  with  low  birth  weight.  Drug-resistant  tuberculosis  and \nmalaria  are  common.  The  number  of  maternal  deaths  has  declined  due  to  a  reduction  in \nfertility.  The  total  fertility  rate  has  dropped  from  around  6.3  to  4.7  in  15  years,  due  to  late \nmarriages and modern family planning practiced by 27% of married couples. However, the \nrisk  of  dying  during  pregnancy  has  not  declined  much.  The  maternal  mortality  ratio  has \nremained  at  about  350  maternal  deaths  per  100,000  live  births.  Sindh  is  also  facing \nincreasing  prevalence  of  noncommunicable  diseases.  About  50%  of  the  disease  burden  is \naccounted for by non-communicable diseases, 38% by communicable diseases, and 12% by \nmaternal and prenatal conditions. The prevalence of noncommunicable diseases is expected \nto  increase  to  70%  by  2020,  and  increase  the  demand  for  costly  interventions  in  chronic \nconditions.  \n  \n\nHealth, Nutrition, and Population Sector \n\n                                                 \n2   Zafar, F. 2002.  Recent  Developments  in  the  Education  Sector  in  Pakistan. Islamabad: Canadian International \n\nDevelopment Agency. \n\n3  Religious schools. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n                                      \n\n37\n\nServices. Coverage and output indicators show the shortcomings of service delivery. \n13. \nFull  immunization  coverage  of  infants  is  50%.  Less  than  40%  of  women  deliver  in  health \nfacilities, and less than 38% of them receive skilled assistance during delivery. Availability of \n24-hour  basic  and  comprehensive  emergency  obstetric  care  in  public  sector  facilities  is \nestimated  at  15%  and  25%,  respectively.  Health  services  are  an  inequitable  mixture  of  a \nfairly large network of run-down  public  services;  high-technology, expensive private sector \ncare; private practitioners; traditional healers; and shops and quacks. Provincial public health \nservices are extended through 1,324 facilities comprising 36 major hospitals, 73 district and \nsubdistrict hospitals, 98 rural health centers, 724 basic health units, 274 dispensaries, and \n119 other categories of facilities. The bed population ratio is 1:1,251. Following devolution, \nabout 400 facilities of defunct metropolitan and municipal corporations have been added. In \naddition,  the  federal  Government  runs  vertical  programs  for  immunization,  tuberculosis, \nmalaria, HIV/AIDS4 control, nutrition, population welfare; and the national program for family \nplanning  and  primary  health  care  supporting  lady  health  workers.  The  lady  health  workers \nreach about one quarter of the poor, and provide basic care for women and children. ADB\u2019s  \nWomen\u2019s Health Project supports four district governments to improve obstetric services and \ngenerally make communities and services more responsive to the health needs of women.  \n \n14. \nFinancing. The health sector received 5\u20137% of the total provincial program of Sindh \nin  the  postdevolution  years  (FY2002  and  FY2003).  Districts  received  about  43%  of  the \nbudget in FY2003 (although salaries were retained at provincial levels). The provincial share \nof  the  annual  development  program  increased  from  41%  in  FY2002  to  63%  in  FY2003.  In \nFY2003, of 83% PRs535 million was allocated to 5 medical colleges and 17% to 35 schools \nand  centers  for  paramedical,  nursing,  and  in-service  training.  The  same  year,  tertiary \nhospitals  were  allocated  25%  of  the  nondevelopment  budget.  Preventive  health  programs \nand foreign aided programs budgeted at PRs1.4 billion are linked to federal programs. The \ncounterpart  budgets  of  these  federal  programs  are  allocated  about  one  third  of  the \ndevelopment budget while the remaining is spent mostly on civil works. As a result, primary \ncare  is  seriously  underfunded.  Free  public  care  is  unavailable,  as  services  carry  both  a \nformal and informal charge. Out-of-pocket spending is estimated at $7 per person per year. \nThe poor often rely on quacks and shops, resulting in poor quality care and income erosion.   \n \n15. \nServices.  The  network  of  infrastructure  has  grown  beyond  the  financial  capacity  of \nthe  Government,  at  the  cost  of  primary  care  and  quality  enhancing  expenditures.  A  large \nnumber of small health facilities operate with very low attendance or are closed. Substantial \nrationalization  of  health  services  is  needed,  which  is  a  politically  sensitive  matter.  This \nshould  go  along  with  a  redistribution  of  staff  and  improving  the  quality  of  services  through \nbetter  supplies  and  supervision.  Vertical  programs  are  undermining  regular  services  and \nshould  be  integrated.  The  main  reason  for  pursuing  vertical  programs  is  that  it  fits  the \norientation of the international aid agencies that look for concrete objectives and measurable \noutcomes achieved in a stipulated period of time. These programs ignore the fact that they \ncan only be implemented because of existing health services.   \n \nHuman Resources. According to Department of Health estimates, the sector has an \n16. \napproximate  sanctioned  staff  strength  of  43,626.  An  additional  2,600  staffs  of  defunct \nmetropolitan and municipal corporations, district councils, and town committees have been \nbrought  under  the  district  after  devolution.  There  are  about  12,000  doctors,  2,000  nurses, \nand about 12,000  paramedics.  Among  the  doctors  in  general  cadre,  25%  are  female.  The \ndoctor population and nurse population are 1:2,932 and 1:8,653, reflecting a major shortage \nof nurses.  The shortage of female staff in Sindh is linked to traditional views on the chastity \nof  women.  There  are  quotas  allocated  to  each  district  for  initial  recruitment  and  persons \ndomiciled in a particular district are eligible for appointments. However, many staff members \noccupy  a  rural  post  while  working  in  an  urban  institution.  Besides  social  and  security \n                                                 \n4   Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nproblems,  working  in  rural  areas  is  less  rewarding  than  in  urban  areas.  Long  established \nstaff  deployment  practices  via  political  pressures  need  to  be  replaced  with  merit-based \nrecruitment, posting, and transfers.  \n \n17. \nDevolution.  The  devolved  health  sector  as  stated  in  Sindh  Local  Government \nOrdinance  2001  has  been  categorized  under  two  broad  functions,  public  health  and \npopulation  welfare.  The  latter,  however,  continues  to  be  vertical  and  federally  funded  and \nhas  not  been  devolved  at  administrative  and  financial  levels;  however,  but  functional \nintegration  at  service  delivery  level  has  been  achieved  to  a  certain  degree  in  the  districts. \nThere  is  considerable  resistance  on  the  part  of  officers  to  delegate  authority.  The  main \nobstacle  impeding  better  implementation  of  the  devolution  plan  in  the  sector  is  not  lack  of \nprofessionals with managerial and technical capabilities, but the politicization of these posts.  \n \nThe  formulation  of  annual  development  plans  has  now  been  devolved  and  is  the \n18. \nresponsibility  of  the  district  team.  Documents  such  as  \u201cdevolution  of  powers  and \nrestructuring  of  departments\u201d  prepared  by  health  offices  of  districts  Sukkur  and  Ghotki \nprovide useful information from which to assess the situation and to prioritize the tasks that \nlie  ahead.  Many  districts  have  not  yet  done  such  systematic  assessments,  identification  of \npriorities and indicators, and development of plans.  Several user-provider groups in Sindh \nare involved in such matters as setting user charges, repair and maintenance, determination \nof  opening  hours,  organizing  women  users  groups,  health  education,  counseling,  peer \nsupport, and arrangement of transport.    \n \n19. \nPolicy.  The National Health Policy, 2001, aims to (i) reduce widespread prevalence \nof communicable diseases, (ii) address imbalances in primary and secondary services, (iii) \nremove  professional  and  managerial  deficiencies  in  the  district  health  system,  (iv)  promote \ngreater gender equity, (v) bridge nutrition gaps in the target population, (vi) correct the urban \nbias in the health sector, (vii) introduce required regulation in the private sector, (viii) create \nmass awareness in public health matters, (ix) effect improvements in the drug sector, and (x) \nbuild capacity for health policy monitoring. The vision as stated in Population Policy, 2002, is \nto  achieve  population  stabilization  by  2020.  The  Government  of  Pakistan\u2019s  10-Year \nperspective plan (2001\u20132011) spells out the essential program elements that need to be in \nplace to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Sindh Poverty Reduction \nStrategy spells out the objectives in primary health care for the period 2001\u20132005.  \n \n20. \nTo capitalize on the opportunity of devolution in the health sector, a critical mass of \nactive and committed leaders will be needed. The medical associations and colleges should \nalso  be  brought  on  board.  Current  management  strengthening  needs  to  be  followed  with \nincreased  delegation  of  authority,  improved  planning  to  rationalize  services,  and improved \nflow  of  funds.  Strong  political  commitment  is  needed  to  contain  the  expansion  of  medical \ncolleges  and  tertiary  hospitals.  Training  and  working  conditions  for  female  staff  need  to  be \nimproved.  At  the  community  level,  efforts  should  be  made  to  develop  health  boards  to \nmaintain and operate the health services.  \n \nC. \n \n21. \nStatus.  Two  thirds  of  Sindh  lies  either  in  the  brackish  water  zone  or  in  the  desert \nzone, and 17% in the sweet water zone. Rainfall is very low, and most rural people get water \nfrom the Indus River and its irrigation system, which is also under threat. The 18 million rural \npeople  live  in  5,871  scattered  villages,  two  thirds  of  which  have  a  population  of  less  than \n5,000. In rural areas, piped water supply covers 14% and hand pumps 41%. The remaining \n45%  of  households  rely  on  unsafe  water,  such  as  uncovered  wells,  rivers,  and  rain-fed or \ncanal-fed ponds that are often located at considerable distance from the homes. The burden \nof fetching water usually falls on women and girls. Overdrawing with mechanized pumps and \npoor  maintenance  of  schemes  cause  water  shortages.  The  water  and  sanitation  sector \n\nRural Water Supply and Sanitation \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n                                      \n\n39\n\n(WSS) infrastructure was often developed without analyzing maintenance and recurrent cost \nneeds, and without a master plan. Several hundred schemes that were politically motivated \nand  poorly  designed  have  been  abandoned.  Experience  has  also  shown  that  most \ncommunities can afford only low -cost services.  \n \nIn both rural and urban areas, drinking  water is often polluted and distributed without \n22. \ntreatment. Sewerage treatment is absent except partially in Karachi. The lower income group \nis  most  affected  by  polluted  water  and  water-related  diseases.  About  53%  of  the  rural \npopulation  lacks  access  to  private  toilet  facilities  including  pit  latrines.  Many  schools  lack \nproper  latrines,  posing  a  problem  for  girls.  Garbage  litters  the  landscape.  With  the  current \ntrend, the MDGs for the water sector are unlikely to be reached.     \n \n \n23. \nRoles.  Since  devolution,  the  Public  Health  Engineering  Department  has  been \nmerged with the local government department and responsibilities for planning and operating \nschemes have been devolved to taluka/town municipal administrations (TMAs). The director \ngeneral  (Public  Health  Engineering)  at  Hyderabad  and  district  executive  officers  were  to \nprovide  support  for  TMAs.  The  taluka  officers  (Infrastructure)  were  made  responsible  for \nwater  supply  and  control  and  development  of  water  resources,  sewage  treatment  and \ndisposal,  drainage,  sanitation  and  solid  waste  collection,  among  others.  However,  TMAs \nhave not assumed this new role due to lack of funds, authority, and capacity to execute the \nnew responsibilities. For example, many engineers are still to be posted from the district to \nthe TMAs. The other bottleneck is the low procurement ceiling of goods and services.  \n \n24. \nThe  private  sector  has  been  discouraged  from  getting  involved  in  the  sector  due  to \ndifficulties  in  collecting  user  charges  and  lack  of  legislative  protection.  The  National  Rural \nSupport  Program,  the  Provincial  Rural  Support  Program,  and  other  large  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) are playing an important role in community development in the sector.  \n \n25. \nFinancing.  TMAs  can  barely  afford  the  establishment  charges  and  related  costs. \nIntegration  of  municipal  services  has  overstaffed  the  TMAs  whose  capacity  to  collect  local \nrevenue,  such  as  octroi,  has  also  been  curtailed.  Communities  have  come  to  rely  on  the \nGovernment  for  financing  the  operation   and  maintenance  costs  of  services.  Many \nhouseholds cannot afford the excessive billings due to mismanagement of schemes. The \ngovernment  of  Sindh  (SPG)  decided  to  deduct  payments  at  source,  resulting  in  an  almost \ntotal  lack  of  funds  for  operation  and  maintenance  for  the  past  2  years.  TMA  revenue \ncollection has also been curtailed.        \n \n26. \nPolicy  and  Plans. The SPG has resolved to continue implementing the rural WSS \nprograms  in  accordance  with  its  uniform  policy  framework,  which  is  promoting  community \nownership and management of operation and maintenance of schemes. However, the newly \ninstalled TMAs are not familiar with this approach. SPG plans to build the capacity of TMAs \nthrough  posting  of  professional  staff  and  training,  and  establish  TMAs  in  all  aspects \n(financial,  managerial,  technical  and  social  development)  to  manage  the  sector.  SPG  will \ntransfer funds directly to TMAs.  The  directorate  general  at  Hyderabad  and  district  support \nunits  will  have  a  coordinating  and  support  role.  The  Government  wants  to  involve  local \nNGOs in community development activities and to build the capacity of TMAs.  SPG wants \nto support each TMA to undertake surveys to (i) assess the technical and financial viability of \neach  scheme;  (ii)  operationalize  viable,  need-bas ed schemes; and (iii) execute small new \nwater supply and sanitation schemes in rural areas. To provide water supply to the presently \nuncovered population in Sindh, PRs67.5 billion or $1.2 billion would be required. SPG also \nplans  to  improve  garbage  disposal  with  the  assistance  of  the  private  sector,  provide \nincentives for latrines, and repair or replace urban sewerage systems. 5 \n                                                 \n5   ADB.  1998.

Masood\nSecretary Economic Affairs  Division\nMinistry  of Economic Affairs  and Statistics\nGovernment of Pakistan\nIslamabad\n\nAsian Development Bank Loan for the Sindh Devolved Social Services Proe:ram\n\nAt the onset of the new millennium, the Government of Pakistan (the Government) launched a\nnumber of initiatives to get Pakistan back on track, following a problematic period of the 1990s marked\nby slow economic growth and stagnation of social indicators. These initiatives include (a) the poverty\nreduction strategy and program, (b) the devolution program, and (c) macro economic stabilization and\ngrowth enhancing measures.\n\nIn  line  with  this  national  reform  agenda, the  Governrnent has  taken  bold  steps to  enhance\ngovernance and improve accountability  mechanisms. At  the core of  the governance reform  agenda is the\ndevolution  program,  which  has  created  a  new  structure  to  increase local  ownership,  participation,\nresponsiveness to local needs, and accountability to the public. Tbe~  reforms are expected to enhance the\nefficiency,  equity, effectiveness and sustainability of public service delivery.\n\nThe Government of  Sindh (Sindh) is fully  supportive of  these reforms program and has initiated\nits  own broad governance programs including  the SindhReforms  Program and furthered the devolution\nagenda through implementation of the Sindh Local Government Ordinance.  Sindh has also developed its\nPoverty Reduction Strategy to address poverty issues and create more economic opportunities.\n\nThe social indicators  of  Sindh, the second most populated province of  Pakistan, compare poorly\nwith  other South Asian  Countries  similarly  placed economically. The social indicators present a dismal\npicture  with  more than 50% of  the population  illiterate,  nearly half  the children  of  school going age not\nattending school, a high  infant  mortality  rate of  10%, half of the children  less than five  years of  age are\nmalnourished, and merely  15% of the rural  population having access to safe drinking  water and sanitation\nfacilities.  Moreover, the gender disparity  is substantial. The Gross Enrolment  Rate (GER) for  females, at\n38%,  is  much  lower  than  the  GER  for  boys  (61%),  while  Maternal  Mortality  Rate  (MMR) \nfor  the\nprovince I remains high due to poor access to health facilities, multiple births and malnutrition.\n\nSindh's social indicators have remained low due to a variety of  issues constraining the quality  of,\nand access to, social services, including  frequent policy  changes, insufficient  funding,  delayed release of\nfunds  for  operations  and  maintenance,  high  turnover  of  personnel  in  leadership  positions,  poor\n\nApproximately  5000 mothers, including  many aged 15-19, die each year due to pregnancy related complications\n\n~\n\nI ~\n\n\f'$0\n\nAppendix 5\n\nLetter of Development Policy-ADB\n\nNoveomer 14,2003\n\ngovernance practices and limited  stakeholder involvement  in  the  design and management of  service\ndelivery and weak public accountability. A key factor affecting the quality ofh1m1an capital development\nhas been the constrained fiscal  position  in  the province, with  interest payments alone consuming over\n$200  million  per  annum,  13%  of  the  total  budget  for  FY  04  and  greater than  the  entire  annual\n\ndevelopment program.\n\nCognizant of the need to develop human capital to nurture economic groWth and reduce poverty,\nSindh is according high priority  to the improvement in the delivery of social services. To  this end, it  has\nrealigned  expenditures both  at  the  provincial  and  the  district  levels  in  favour  of  social  services,\nparticularly  education and health  and enhanced the  transparency and efficiency  in  the  financing  and\nmanagement of  social  sectors, by  devolving  decision  making  and  finances to  lower  fonnations  of\ngovernment in 2001.  Responsibilities to manage basic health and education services have been delegated\nto  district  governments, while  water  and  sanitation  have  been  mandated to  the  Tehsil  Municipal\nAdministration  (TMAs).  It is encouraging that after only two years of devolution, the perfonnance of the\nsocial sector appears to be showing signs of progress with  variations among districts due to improv~ents\nin service facilities, staff attendance and supply. However, local governments require sustained support to\nenable them to overcome the challenges that they are facing in the transitory phase.\n\nSindh's social sector priorities  are an integral part of  its poverty alleviation  strategy reflected in\nthe Poverty Reduction Strategy and the overall refornl  agenda of  the Sindh Reform Program. The Sindh\nReform Program aims to reverse the declining trend in social indicators through a three pronged poverty\nreduction strategy focusing on achieving a more equitable delivery of  improved social services, creating\nemployment and skill  acquiring  opportunities  and extending micro  credit  to  the poor.  Sindh seeks to\ninstirute far reaching refonns in the social sectors by addressing the core governance issues constraining\nthe  efficient  delivery  of  serVices, by  opting  for  a need-based resource allocation  mechanism, and by\nfostering community involvement in the delivery of social services.\n\nRecognizing the  importance  of  education  for  economic  growth  and  social  hannony,  Sindh\ninitiated  a vigorous education sector refonn  program in  2001, targeted at increasing literacy  rates and\nimproving  the quality  of  education combined with  the critical  systemic, institutional  and .governance\nreforms required to improve public  service delivery. The key components of  the refonn  program include\nmaking  primary  education  compulsory,  providing  incentives  such  as free  textbooks  for  children  in\nprimary  classes and  stipends  to  girls  enrolled  in  middle  grades;  encouraging greater  community\nparticipation  in  the delivery  of  quality  education by reorganising and restructuring School Management\nCommittees (SMCs);  carrying  out  regular  teacher training  programs; improving  salary  packages for\nteachers; functionalising viable closed schools, and strengthening public-private partnerships.\n\nFurthermore, accountability  mechanisms are being strengthened by  the introduction  of  a merit\nbased system for  the recruitment of  teachers through entry tests administered by third  parties. It  is also\nrehabilitating  shelterless schools and providing  them with  essential infrastructure  to  ensure that  they\nfunction as effective institutions. As a result of these interventions, there have been notable improvements\nin  retention and enrolment rates, which  have also been facilitated  by  efforts  of  SMCs  throughout  the\n\nprOVInce.\n\nSindh is responsible for  financing the provision of health services and is currently  in the process\nof  developing a Provincial  Health Strategy. The district  governments have been allocated about 40% of\nthe provincial  health budget to finance the Operation and Maintenance (O&M)  expenditures  of  health\nfacilities,  ranging from basic health units to district hospitals, although allocations for O&M  expenditures\nfor  basic health units remain inadequate, and are major factors constraining the delivery  of  basic health\nservices.\n\n~\n\n\fLetter ofDevelop~t  Policy-ADB\n\nApp~ndix 5 \n\n51\nNovember  14, 2003\n\nSindh has a severe water shortage problem with the majority of its villages located in areas with\npolluted and brackish water. Even in urban areas the drinking water provided does not undergo proper\ntreatment for consumption. Only about 20% of the rural areas have access to drinking water and nearly\nhalf of  it comes from unprotected sources. Furthermore, water supply schemes are not being managed\nefficiently with over 400 schemes poorly  designed and about 200/0 of  all  rural  water schemes not\noperational. Access to sanitation facilities is also limited with only 10% of the rural population having\nhousehold latrine facilities.\n\nFollowing devolution, the Public Health Engineering Department has been merged with  the Local\nGovernment Department and continues to  carry  out the major  development schemes. TMAs  have been\nmade responsible for the provision  of basic water, sanitation, drainage, garbage collection  and solid waste\ndisposal services but  they  lack  the capacity to  manage these services adequately. There  is also lack  of.\nclarity  at the TMA  level on the policy  regarding the sharing of the operations and maintenance of existing\nwater  supply  schemes for  which  Sindh  is  planning  a  new  unifOm1 policy  based  on  community\nparticipation  in  the  development,  implementation  and  management of  new  schemes  and  On  the\noperational responsibilities of existing  water supply schemes not being run by VDAs.\n\nSindh is committed  to  continue  with  its  poverty  reduction  and governance refpm1 agendas. It\nwants to  address the above referred  weaknesses by  pursuing a strong policy  agenda that  will  result  in\ntangible  improvements in  the  social  sectors. It  is  in  this  context  that  the  Devolved  Social  Services\nProgram (DSSP) has been jointly  developed by  Sindh and the ADB,  fully  incorporating  the extensive\ndialogue that has taken place  with  local  governments, NGOs, service providers  and beneficiaries. The\ndesign of  DSSP is based on a basic set of  reforms which  will  create a conducive environment  for  local\ngovernments to finance the identified  institutional,  social,  fmancial and capacity needs in service delivery\nthat are not being covered by other sources of  funds.\n\nThe hallmark of  the DSSP will  be the flexible  nature of support that district  governments will  be\nable to access to fund sectoral investments based on local needs and priorities~ only  a \"short  negative list\"\nwill  resttict  the utilisation  of  funding  by specifying  activities on which the monies made available to the\nlocal governments would not be spent.\n\nThese reforms fonn  an integral part of  the wide-ranging \"economic and social sector reforms\nlaunched by Sindh with the support of a variety of multilateral and bilateral donors, such as the World\nBank (WE)  tlU\"ough the Sindh Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC) that aims to create fiscal space to\nfinance priority social sector expenditures and complements it  with  governance refonns critical  for\nimproving delivery of basic services; the Asian Development Bank (ADB) thr9ugh its Decentralization\nSupport Program that strengthens capacity of  local governments; the ADB  with  its  Access to Justice\nProgram to bring about judicial  reforms and specific sectoral investments through ADB' s Devolved\nElementary Education Project,; the ESRA funded by the USAID and other donor assisted projects in the\nsocial sectors.\n\nIn the education sector, the effectiveness of programs implemented during the last three years will\nbe evaluated and wherever necessary, they will  be reinforced and strengthened. To  enhance accountability\nmechanisms and address governance issues, the policy  of  contract based, institution  specific  recruitment\nof  teachers through  third  parties  with  adequate weightage for  locals  and  females  in  the  recruitment\nfonnula will  be continued.\n\nTo  improve education perfom1ance indicators such as enrolment levels and transition rates,\nincentives based programs such as the distribution of free textbooks and stipends will  be supported and\nfurther strengthened to enhance their efficacy in  the system. The scope of  the on-going program of\nstipends for girls enrolled in elementary grades would be extended to cover girls enrolled in secondary\n\nFinance  DeDartmcnt.

Building on such incentive structures would not only incentivize\nparents to enrol and retain their girls in schools but will  also reduce gender differentials in education\nindicators which are much wider  in higher grades.\n\nThe scope for funding  ofSMCs  will  be expanded to include classes up to grade 12. Moreover, the\ncapacity of the SMCs strengthened by giving  them requisite operational authority and financial  capability\nto  improve schooling conditions  for  all grades. To  facilitate  the SMCs efforts  in  improving  the learning\nenvironment in schools based on local needs and priorities,  they would be granted maxitmnn fleX1oility in\nthe utilisation  of ftmds with  only  a short negative list  of areas on which these resources may not be spent.\nThe  SMCs will  also be adequately empowered to monitor  and report teacher absenteeism to the relevant\nauthorities.  Such  measures would  generate greater  community  participation  in  the  monitoring  and\nmanagement of education related services.\n\n\u00a3indh recognizes that the rehabilitation of  existing infrastructure and the provision of  basic\nfacilities (such as additional classrooms, boundary walls, toilets, furniture, blackboards, drinking water\n-\nfacilities, etc.) can playa significant role in improving the quality of education. \n\n. \n\nDistrict Governments will  be able to access funding for  education and health on the basis of\nsimple plans identifying the overall strategy of the district government for the sector, providing a baseline\nfor all key outcome and perfonnance indicators indicating the past and expected levels of expendinIres on\neducation that would fa~ilitate the monitoring of refonn interventions.\n\nConsistent with the objective of increasing the involvement of civil society in the management of\nservice delivery, along the lines of the SMCs and Village Development Associations, Sindh will  foster the\ndevelopment .of  independent, self-sufficient and  accountable health  boards and  patient  welfare\nassociations to enable improvements in the functioning of public institutions and through that the delivery\nof services.\n\nTo facilitate the effective  functioning of health delivery outlets, the Sindh is planning to empower\ndistrict  governments to rehabilitate  BffiJs,  RHCs and THQs  without  allowing  the  construction  for  new\nfacilities.. Additional  resources could be used to recruit  essential staff  such as additional  community  and\nfemale health workers to improve maternal and child  health services. Resources could also be utilized  for\nprocurement of equipment and supplies, provide incentives to staff and for  operations and maintenance of\nhealth institutions.\n\n~....\n\nAs part of its efforts to improve the policy framework\"Sindh will  prepare interim policies for the\nwater and sanitation sector and for solid waste management. Sindh plans to improve the coverage and\ndelivery of drinking water supply, allow TMAs to access funds for financing simple, non-mechanized\nschemes (hand pumps etc.) and conduct surveys and prepare master plans for water supply systems.\n\nSince the bulk of the initiatives for the support of social services \\yill  have to be undertaken by\nthe local governments, the funding of these will  be routed through Accotmt No. IV.  A  system will  be\nestablished that ensures greater accessibility to funding for district governments and TMAs  and more\nefficient utilization of funds in a transparent manner, by adopting participatory demand driven processes\nof planning and monitoring.\n\n,,\n\nTo  enhance the  effectiveness  of  the  proposed  interventions,  a  set  of  policy  guidelines,  an\ninstitutional \nframework  and  terms  of  engagement clearly  delineating  the  roles  and  responsibilities\nbetween  collaborating  different  types  of  agencies is  also  being  considered.  This  combined  With  a\nconscious policy  of supporting efforts by the local governments to rationalize  serVices would  produce the\nkind  of  fiscal and planning discipline  that is needed to improve the performance of  the social sectors.\n\n\f..\n\n\\\n\n\"..t\n\n.\",\n\niii\n\n~;\n\nLetter ofDevelopent Policy-ADB\n\nAppendix  5\n\n53-.\n\nNovember 14, 2003\n\nThe Sindh also recognizes the need to  improve the capability of  local  go~ts, \n\nthrough a\ncombination  of  specific  and overarching capacity  building  efforts,  to  develop and implement sector\nspecific plans. For the first  two years, local governments will  be assisted in the preparation of these plans,\nwith  varying degrees of support, by the Program Support Unit (psu).\n\nA  very active, adequately resom-ced and well-equipped Program Support Unit  (pSU)  will  be\nestablished in the Finance Department at the provincial  level with Local Support Units in each district, to\nmanage the policy refonns  and implementation of  a program as iImovative and as fleX1ole as DSSP. A\nhigh-powered steering committee chaired by the Additional  Chief Secretary, P&D, with representation of\nall  the relevant departments, will  oversee program execution.\n\nThe Sindh is confident of die sustainability of the reform program because. (a) similar policies are\nbeing  pursued nationally;  (b)  die  fiscal simation will  improve substantially and d1ere will  be adequate\nfiscal  space for continuing with  program interventions in the future from the savings on debt servicing\narising  from the improved debt management and accelerated repayments of  debt under both Sindh SAC\nand DSSP; and (c) most of  the ftmding for  the proposed interventions will  be channelled through the\ndistrict Acco\\mt No. N.\n\nYou will  agree l\\t1r. Secretary that these initiatives  require substantial financial and other support\nbacked  up by  political  commitment, which  exist  at  all  levels of  government  The DSSP can make a\nsubstantialcontnoution to the achievement of this objective and we are confident that with the support of\nthe ADB,  Sindh can provide better and more efficient  and effective social services to its citizens.\n\nWith best regards\n\nYoms sincerely,\n\nKarachi\nPhone: 9221-9206519\nFax:  9221-920651.1\n\n~\"~\n\n,\n\n[:~ \n\n, .\n\n~-\n\n-\n\nlif'lii\n\n.  .\n. \"..\n;'i.,c:j\n'~I\n\n:~J\n\".\n\n. \n\n\"\"0:\n.0\n.,\n\n., \n\n.\n\n.

Pakistan\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  was  about  PRs3.73  billion \n($63.7 billion equivalent) in FY2002. Sindh\u2019s economy contributes 30% of the GDP compared to \na  population  share  of  about  25%,  the  difference  being  explained  by  the  economic  hub  of \nKarachi. Half of Sindh\u2019s population live in the urban areas. The per capita income is about $450 \nper  person  per  year.  Poverty  has  increased  from  27%  in  FY1999  to  37%  in  2001.  About  one \nthird of the urban and two thirds of the rural population are poor, living on less than a dollar a \nday.  \n \n2. \nSindh  Revenue.  The  budget  of the  Sindh  provincial  government  (SPG)  was  PRs80.7 \nbillion  ($1.4  billion)  in  FY2003,  or  7.2%  of  the  provincial  GDP,  to  serve  the  economy  of \napproximately 35 million people. The budget includes 82% federal transfers (taxes and nontax \ntransfers), 16% provincial revenue receipts, and 2% development grants. Federal transfers have \non  average  increased  17.6%  since  FY1998,  compared  with  an  annual  growth  of  12.7%  for \nprovincial receipts. The level of development grants has not been constant in the last 6  years; \nthe amount was close to zero in FY2000 but was PRs4.2 billion ($72 million) in FY2002 (Table \nA6.1). \n \n3. \nPublic Sector Budget. The total budget for FY2003 was PRs99.3 billion, including 94% \nrecurrent  expenditures  and  6%  development  expenditures,  including  the  annual  development \nprogram  and  foreign  project  assistance.  The  recurrent  expenditure  in  these  social  sectors \nincreased at an average annual growth rate of 16.7% in the past 6 years, exceeding receipts in \nthe  last  6  years.  Contrary  to  recurrent  spending, development  spending  decreased between \nFY1998 and FY2001 due to a decline in foreign project assistance, but recovered from FY2002 \nonward.  The  total  fiscal  deficit  in  FY2003  was  PRs18.7  billion  (about  $322  million).  Before  \nFY2001, SPG replaced federal loans with domestic borrowing. But in view of high  interest rates \nnow, SPG wants to replace  domestic  loans with foreign borrowing.  In  FY2003, SPG  reduced \ndomestic loans to 52% and  used foreign loans for  the remaining 48%. SPG had a total debt of \nPRs109.6 billion (about $2 billion)  in FY2001, of which 59%  was foreign, 39% federal, and 2% \ndomestic.  The  revenues  are  expected  to  increase  by  22%  in  FY2005,  and  by  11%  in  the \nfollowing years.      \n \nSocial  Sector  Budget.    The  recurrent  budget  for  major  social  services  (education, \n4. \nhealth,  and  water  and  sanitation)  was  29%, compared with  general administration  22%, and \ndebt servicing 14% in FY2002. The budgets for education, health and water and sanitation are \nrespectively, 73%, 24%, and 3% of total spending in the major social sectors in FY2003 (Table \nA6.2) The budget in the water and sanitation sector is currently at an all-time low. The recurrent \nbudget  in  education,  health  and  water  and  sanitation  was  respectively  83%,  93%,  and  77%. \nSimilarly,  the  nonsalary  budget  as  a  share  of  recurrent  budget  was  9%,  20%,  and  21%, \nrespectively.     \n \n \n5. \nOverall, the total social sector budget (both revenue and development expenditures) has \nincreased by  11.0%  per  year.  Between  FY2000  and  FY2003,  social  sector  recurrent  budgets \nhave  increased  by  11.4%  per  year  on  average  (10.7%  for  education,  13.5%  for  health,  and \n12.5% for [WSS]). The total social sector  development budget increased by an average annual \ngrowth rate of 6.9% (21.6% for education, and 10.2% for health, per year, while that for water \nsupply and sanitation declined by 29.8%).  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n55\n\n \n\nItem \n\nTable A6.1: Government of Sindh Budget, FY1998\u2013FY2003 \n(PRs million) \nFY1999 \n\n \n\nFY1998 \nFY2002 \nFY2000 \nRevised  Revised  Revised  Revised  Revised \n\nFY2001 \n\nFY2003 \nBudget \n\n2.

The  National  Poverty  Reduction \nStrategy sets a target of at least 15% increase in social sector spending per year. The increase \nin  Sindh  social  sector  spending  is  proposed  to  go  up  by  respectively  28%,  11% and  11%, \nimplying an average annual growth of  16%. The Government share will increase by 22% in the \nfirst  year  and  11%  in  the  second  and  third  year  according  to  its  expected  growth  without \nprogram support. The targets are based on a range of considerations including (i) the relative \ncushion in the salary budget due to unfilled vacancies, (ii) the federal decision to increase staff \nsalaries, and (iii) relatively low nonsalary and development budgets, and overall low spending in \nthe WSS sector. Tables A6.3 and A6.4 provided the rates and amounts for the relative growth of \nthe social sectors in salary, nonsalary recurrent and development expenditures, balanced in a \nmanner  that  should  result  in  a  more  balanced  social  sector  budget.  The  salary  component  is \nkept relatively low, while nonsalary recurrent and development spending is expected to increase \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n57\n\nmore sharply, particularly the WSS. The result would be half of the incremental budget flowing \ninto education, and one quarter each into health and WSS. \n \n7. \nThe proposed Program will add additional costs to carry out the policy reforms, including \nopening and rehabilitation of schools, health centers and water supply and sanitation schemes, \nhiring female teachers and paramedics, stipends and textbooks for school children, and up-front \nfunding  of  community-based  organizations.  The  total  additional  costs  have  been  estimated  at \n$703 million in 3 years (Table A6.4).  \n \n\nTable A6.3: Social Sector Growth Targets, FY2005\u2013FY2007 \n(%) \n\n3.

The  DSSP  provides  for  an  interim  support \nmechanism in the form of local support unit (LSUs). These LSUs will be housed in the districts \nand will comprise finance and governance officers, a monitoring and evaluation officer, and an \nengineer. The engineer will be assigned a cluster of TMAs and will assist them in development \nplanning, monitoring, and financial management and in water sector planning, respectively.  \n\nThese committees are not formed in all the districts, but where they do exist. They can provide \nguidance  and  input  in  relation  to  the  development  of  the  sector,  especially  in  reflecting local \nneeds and priorities. These committees can also help in monitoring activities in their respective \nsectors.  Where  such  committees  have  not  yet  been  formed  or  are  inactive,  the  DSSP  will \nencourage their formation. \n \nAccounts committees of the district and taluka/town councils are charged with the responsibility \nof  monitoring  the  use  of  funds  and  to  ensure  that  public  funds  are  used  in  a  responsible, \naccountable  manner.  The  accounts  committees  will  assist  in  tracking  expenditures   from  the \nDSSP  funds  and  focus  on  transparency  and  accountability  in  use  of  funds.  In  conjunction  with \nthe DSP, the DSSP will strengthen the work of the accounts committees. \n \nThe district planning committee is responsible for integrating development activity and planning \nin  a  DG.  It  will  prioritize  and  coordinate  inter-taluka developmental plans and set directions for \nrealizing the economic potential in a district. Chaired by the district  nazim (elected head of the \ndistrict)  and  comprising  the  district  coordinating  officer  and  TMA  and  union  administration \nnazims,  the  committee  can  help  create  a  shared  vision  for  health  and  education  in  the  district, \nleading  to  political  ownership  at  all  three  tiers  on  sector  plans,  targets,  and  approaches, \nprioritization of district-wide needs and also resolution of any outstanding issues among the three \ntiers.  These  committees  are  not  yet  fully  operational,  and  the  DSSP  and  DSP  can  combine \nresources to make them effective, active coordination units. \n \nThe councils at both the DG and TMA levels have the dual roles of approving the budgets and \nalso monitoring the working of the LG through a number of committees.

Community Arrangements \nCommunity-\nbased \norganizations  \n\nFollowing  the  ethos  expressed  in  the  Sindh  Local  Government  Ordinance,  which  aims  at \nimproving the breadth and width of civil society engagement with the public sector, the DSSP \nseeks to strengthen partnerships with community-based organizations (CBOs), by encouraging\u2014\nas  a  policy  action\u2014the active involvement of CBOs in improving the delivery of social services \nthrough  public-private  partnerships.  The  term  CBO  is  used  broadly  to  include  school \nmanagement committees (SMCs), health boards and patients associations, village development \nassociations (VDAs) for water and sanitation, citizen community boards (CCBs), NGOs, welfare \norganizations, and other representative bodies that are based in the community and/or represent \nand articulate the specific needs, concerns, and priorities of communities. CBO services may be \n(i)  building  the  capacity  to  assume  responsibility,    (ii)  managing  social  services,  (iii)  providing   \nsocial  services,  (iv)  performing  oversight  functions,  or  (v)  a  combination  (i)-(iv). The councils at \nboth  the  DG  and  TMA  levels  have  the  dual  roles  of  approving  the  budgets  and  monitoring  the \nworking  of  the  LG  through  a  number  of  committees.  Funding  of  CBOs  will  be  subject  to  yearly \napproval of the annual plans, and availability of funds in competition with other CBOs. The DSSP \nwill support the strengthening of the CBOs, council, and committees as outlined below along with \nthe DSP.   \n \nAs envisaged under  the Sindh Local Government Ordinance, the CCBs are to be established in \nthe  LGs  to  mobilize  the  community  for  development  and  improvement  in  service  delivery; \ndevelopment and management of a new or existing public facility; identification of development \nand  municipal  needs;  mobilization  of  stakeholders \nthe \nimprovement  and  maintenance  of  facilities;  welfare  of  the  handicapped,  destitute,  widows,  and \nfamilies  in  extreme  poverty;  establishment  of  farming,  marketing,  and  consumers  cooperatives.  \nDSSP  seeks  to  reinforce  this  mandate  and  encourages  the  formation  of  CCBs  and  their \nactivation by engaging them in development activity in the social sectors.  \n\nfor  community \n\ninvolvement \n\nin \n\nSMCs have been provided a number of powers  and responsibilities by the government of Sindh, \naimed  at  increasing  the  participation  of  communities  to  improve  school  operation  and \nmaintenance,  including  purchase  of  textbooks  and  school  supplies,  repairs  and  maintenance, \nproviding basic facilities and furniture, and contracting female teachers on site-specific contracts. \nThe DSSP will expand the current SMC funding coverage to all schools up to grade 12 if no other \nfinancing is available to them. The funds will be allocated according to the formula used by the \nprovincial government\u2014at the moment PRs167 per child\u2014and be deposited in their accounts by \nthe  DG.  Use  of  these  funds  will  be  subject  to  the  instructions  and  guidelines  issued  by  the \ngovernment of Sindh from time to time. Proper accounts of the funds will be maintained by the \nSMCs and will be subject to audit. \n\nAs  with  SMCs,  health  boards  and  patients  welfare  associations  can  play  an  important  role  in \nimproving basic amenities and services at health facilities. They may help through maintenance \nand repairs, provision of utilities, procurement of essential equipment and supplies, and provision \nof  incentives  and  facilities  for  female  staff.  Through  health  boards  and  patients  welfare \nassociations,  health  facilities  will  be  encouraged  to  become  financially  more  self-sufficient \nthrough a transparent and pro-poor system of user charges, whereby the earnings may be used \nfor  repairs  and  maintenance  of  the  health  facility  and  other  such  necessary  expenditure. The \nhealth boards and patients welfare associations will need to advertise the fee structures so as to \ntake the clientele into confidence and also to ensure that there is transparency and accountability \nin the process. The health boards will maintain proper accounts subject to audit. \n\nCitizen \ncommunity \nboards  \n\n \n\n \n\nSchool \nmanagement \ncommittees \n(SMCs) \n \n \n\nHealth boards \nand patients \nwelfare \nassociations \n \n \n \n\n \n\nVillage \ndevelopment \nassociations  \n\n \nVillage  development  associations  (VDAs)  were  established  to  take  over  water  schemes  in  the \nrural  areas  and  operate  them,  but  this  initiative  has  experienced  difficulties  because  (i) \noverdesigned  mechanized  schemes  became  unmanageable  after  the  Government  withdrew  its \nfinancial  support;  and  (ii)  the  frameworks  for  operations  of  VDAs  (such  as  fee  collection  and \ncapacity  to  maintain  records,  etc.)  themselves  were  unclear.  Under  the  DSSP,  an  effort will be \nmade  to  revive  the  VDAs  and  to  involve  them  in  not  only  identifying  viable  schemes,  but  in \ndeveloping the frameworks that will enable them to generate and use revenues for maintenance \nof  schemes.  VDAs  will  be  eligible  to  receive  funds  from  the  share of the TMAs earmarked for \nsupporting CBOs and the criteria for eligibility will be developed by Finance Department and the \nPSU.  VDAs  will  need  to  maintain  proper  accounts  of  the  funds.  The  PSU  and  LSUs,  in \ncollaboration  with  the  DSP,  will  undertake  initiatives  to  build  the  administrative  and  financial \ncapacities of VDAs.  \nSource: Sindh Provincial Government  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f         \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n63\n\nLIST OF INELIGIBLE ITEMS \n\n \n1. \nThe proceeds of the loan will be utilized to finance the foreign exchange expenditures for \nthe  reasonable  cost  of  imported  goods  (excluding  any  duties  or  taxes)  required  during  the \nexecution of the Sindh Devolved Social Services Program.

The PFC has announced an interim award, that has met the \napproval of all stakeholders, and is currently working on improving the design for a final award. \nThe  description  of  the  use  of  funds  is  divided  into  five  areas:  allocation,  transfer,  use, \naccountability, and sustainability.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  simplest  and  most  relevant  for  the  purpose  of  the  Devolved  Social  Services \nProgram  (DSSP)  is  the  method  used  to  transfer  funds  to  local  governments  from  the  Khushal \nPakistan  Program  (a  poverty  reduction  initiative  of  the  federal  Government),  which  distributes \nfunds  based  on  population  (70%)  and  backwardness  (30%).  The  population  data  is  sourced \nfrom the population census carried out by the federal Government in 1998, while backwardness \nis sourced from the deprivation index generated by the Social Policy and Development Center, \nranking  districts  in  Sindh  on  the  basis  of  26  socioeconomic  indicators.  The  DSSP  funds  are \nproposed  to  be  divided  as  follows:  education  (50%),  health  (20%),  and  water  and  sanitation \n(30%). To ensure that there is a definite role for civil society organizations, at least 25% of total \nfunds  will  be  earmarked  for  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  such  as  school \nmanagement  committees,  village  development  associations  and  health  boards,  and \nnongovernment  organizations.    During  the  first  year,  funds  are  not  proposed  for  union \nadministrations, but distribution to them may be considered from the second year onward.  \n \nC. \n \n3. \nThe  entire  share  of  the  district  governments  for  education  and  health,  and  that  of \ntaluka(subdistricts)/town  municipal  administration  (TMA)  for  water  and  sanitation  will  flow  from \nthe  provincial  government  to  the  district  fund  and  the  taluka  fund  directly  from  Account  no. IV \nwithin  an  agreed-upon  timeframe.  The  transfer  will  be  subject  to  the  local  government  (LG) \nconcerned  signing  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU)  with  the  provincial  government, \nagreeing to a set of conditions under which the funds can be used. These terms and conditions \nwill  include  minimum  standards,  ineligibility  lists,  and  reporting  requirements  for  the  use  of \nfunds. This direct transfer mechanism will create much-needed fiscal space and improve cash \nflow  for  run-down  social  services  within  LGs;  strengthen  local  ownership,  autonomy,  and \naccountability; and reduce the risk of using fungible foreign aid funds for other purposes.  \n \nD. \n \n4. \nOne of the principal features of the DSSP is the flexibility it provides in use of funds. This \nflexibility is being proposed in the light of experience with approaches that are prescriptive and \nbecause this proposal confirms the autonomous role of LGs. Program funds are subject to few \nsafeguards for accountable, responsible use. To become eligible for program funds, all LGs will \nhave to sign an MOU with the provincial government or any agency authorized by it. The MOU \nwill follow the general terms and conditions for use of funds, a negative list of ineligible items, \nand a minimal positive list. The general eligibility criteria of funding for annual plans of DGs and \nTMAs are as follows: \n \n\nTransfer of Funds \n\nUse of Funds  \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9  \n\n65\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nUse a participatory planning process including representation of women. \nPresent  the  annual  sector  plan  and  budget  for  all  sources  and  uses  of  funds  in \nthe sector. \nFocus on poverty and gender, specifying inputs and outputs targets. \nProvide implementation responsibilities and monitoring arrangements. \nEarmark 25% of the funds for CBOs and other partnership initiatives. \nInclude the minimum package of services for the sector. \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii)  Exclude ineligibility services. \n(viii)  Provide for accounting details to permit tracking of funds. \n(ix) \n\nEnsure adequate financial management capacity and agree to audit. \n\n \n5. \nThe  program  funds  will  form  part  of  the  district  or  taluka  fund  and  the  accounting \nprocedures  prescribed  by  the  Government  will  be  followed.  To  permit  tracking  of  funds, \nhowever,  separate  statements  of  expenditures  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  monthly  to  the \nprogram  management  unit.  Expenditures  made  with  program  funds  will  also  be  subject  to \nexternal audit as per procedure agreed-upon with the Sindh provincial government (SPG).  \n \n6. \nAll  procurements,  whether  for  goods  or  services  and  including  those  made  from  the \nprogram  funds,  will  follow  existing  government  rules  and  procedures,  the  provisions  of  the \nprocurement manual and/or any other rules/regulations governing procurement at the LG level.  \n \nE. \n \n7. \nThe flexibility in use of funds that is being proposed under the DSSP calls for sufficient \nsafeguards  against  misuse  of  funds  and  abuse  of  the  flexible  approach.  For  example,  (i)  the \nMOU will set out the plans; (ii) there will be participatory planning and monitoring, integration of \nthe program with the normal planning and budgeting process in local governments, monitoring \nand  evaluation  through  various  committees,  performance  standards  and  benchmarks,  and \nmeasures to ensure transparency and public information.  A disincentive for deviant behavior is \nproposed to be built in withholding further releases to the deviant local government in the year \nthat follows.  \n\nAccountability \n\n \n\nSustainability  \n\nF. \n \n8. \nTo provide sustenance to this initiative of supporting SPG to improve its fiscal space and \nincrease  investments  in  the  social  sectors,  SPG  will  need  to  (i)  prepare  a  medium-term \nbudgetary framework based on a realistic estimate of the sources of funds, and (ii) demonstrate \na level of political commitment and provide adequate assurances on the policy actions required \nto enable the program funds to have a meaningful impact on social services by institutionalizing \nprocesses for accountable use of these funds. The financial plan in Appendix 6 shows how the \nDSSP is expected to contribute to social sector spending.    \n \n9. \nThe  DSSP  also  has  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  loan  for  building  the  capacity  of  the \nsocial sector. This component has a separate fund managed by the program support unit. It is \nproposed that the TA funds follow the same approval mechanisms that are being used for TA \ninvestments under the Decentralization Support Program.  \n \n \n \n \n\n     \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN  \n\n($\u2019000) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n \n\n66\n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nItem \nA.

Sindh has the highest concentration of the poor in Pakistan with the figure \nincreasing from 27% in 1999 to 37% in 2001. Two thirds of the poor live in rural areas. Poverty; gender imbalance; \nweak management; and poor service delivery in education, health, and water supply have contributed to high mortality \nand malnutrition rates, stagnating school enrollment and high population growth in Sindh. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  and  program  calls  for  major  reforms  in  public sector governance, and \nincreased allocation and efforts for improving social services. The Sindh provincial government (SPG) has prepared a \npoverty reduction strategy and wants to strengthen devolution in the social sectors. The devolution is under way since \nAugust  2001.  Local  governments  (LGs)  are  functioning  at  the  district,  taluka,  and  union  level.  As  per  Local \nGovernment Ordinance, district governments have been given responsibility for basic education and health services, \nand taluka municipal administrations for water and sanitation services. The devolution policy anticipates that the LG \nstructure will improve the efficiency of allocating public resources in accordance with local needs, and enhance quality, \nefficiency, accountability, and ownership of such services.  \n \nThe poverty partnership agreement between the Government of Pakistan and Asian Development Bank (ADB) reflects \nthe Government\u2019s vision for poverty reduction, including the need for improving social services for the poor. The major \ntheme  of  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  program  is  governance  reform  including  in  the  social  sector.  ADB  supports  the \nGovernment\u2019s governance reforms through the Decentralization Support Program and other programs. The proposed \nSindh  Devolved  Social  Services  Program  (DSSP)  supports  the  Sindh  Reform  Program,  the  Poverty  Reduction \nStrategy and the devolution to LGs in the social sectors.  \n\n \nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nProposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \n\nAbout  one  third  of  Sindh\u2019s  population  live  on  less  than  a  dollar a day, about two thirds of them in rural areas, with \npockets of extreme poverty. Sindh faces lack of basic services, high incidence of health problems, low literacy rate, \nhigh  population  growth,  lack  of  rule  of  law,  lack  of  access  to  justice  and  empowerm ent,  inaccessibility  of  capital, \nincreased  unemployment,  and  weak  service  delivery.  Social  sector  indicators  in  Sindh  are  very  poor.  Half  of  the \nchildren below age of 5 years are malnourished, and 11% of them die before the age of 5.  Of the survivors, half do \nnot attend school. The total fertility rate is 5 children per woman. Only a quarter of the rural population have access to \nsafe drinking water. The poor social indicators are linked to complex political and social organizations, poverty, gender \ndiscrimination, run-down social services, and governance problems.        \n \nThe rural society of Sindh is heterogeneous in terms of ethnicity, tribes, and caste. Social relationships are based on \ncaste, tribe, and language. The two major rural groups are Sindhi and Baluchi. In addition, there are Punjabi, Pathan, \nBihari, and Hindu scheduled castes. The Hindu scheduled caste constitutes 6.5% of the population. The scheduled \ncaste includes Kholi, Bheel, Parkari Kulhis, Meghwar, and Khumber. Social groups found within rural areas of Sindh \ninclude landowner (zamindar) sharecroppers (Muslim and Hindu scheduled castes), small and middle farmers, wage \nlaborers, fisherfolk, artisans and service households. In addition to differences in castes there are seminomadic clans \nand,  in  some  areas  seasonal  migrants  and  the  boat  people  in  Manchar  Lake.  In  rural  Sindh,  status  and  power  are \nconferred by land ownership. The land ownership, relationships of tribes and caste determine much of the political and \nsocial organization and functioning of the society. The skewed land tenure pattern and high degree of landlessness is \nrelated  to  perpetuation  of  the  zamindar  system.  The  skewed  land  tenure  pattern,  very  low  rainfall  and  periodic \ndroughts, and salination of lands have seriously affected agricultural output, and are contributing to deep rural poverty \nand migration to urban areas at the rate of 6% per year.    \n \nDuring the past decade, Sindh implemented the Social Action Program (SAP) to improve the social sector. The SAP \nexperience has mixed  outcome.  The  interrelated  economic,  governance,  and  project  modalities  affected  SAP  effort. \nReforms  in  service  delivery  will  be  needed  to  improve  the  performance  of  the  public  sector  to  meet  the  Millennium \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n69\n\nDevelopment  Goals.  The  proposed  DSSP  will  support  capacity  building,  policy  reforms,  and  flexible  financing  for \ndevolved  social  services.  The  DSSP  aims  to  improve  people\u2019s  access  to  education,  health,  water  and  sanitation  in \nSindh  and  thereby  help  reduce  poverty  and  gender  imbalance.  The  DSSP  will  specifically  focus  on  (i)  building  the \ncapacity  of  LGs,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  community-based organizations (CBOs) to have timely \nand  flexible  funding  modalities  to  improve  the  quality  of  social  services;  (ii)  improve  technical  capacity,  participatory \nplanning  process,  accountability  and  transparency  of  LGs,  NGOs,  CBOs;  (iii)  community  outreach  and  social \nmobilization activities by LGs, NGOs, and CBOs to ensure access to social services by the poor, scheduled caste, and \nwomen; (iv) developing mechanisms for collaboration and partnership among LGs, NGOs, and  for cost sharing, and \nsustained  service  delivery;  (v)  developing  committees/working  groups  at  the  ward  level  (local  bodies)  representing \ndifferent  socioeconomic  groups,  women  for  planning  of  social  services  in  local  level;  (vi) strengthen  school \nmanagement  committees  through  increased  involvement  of  parents,  specifically  mothers,  in  monitoring  quality  of \neducation and school enrollment; and (vii) developing mechanism for community level monitoring of LGs and sectoral \nagencies providing social services and fund management. The DSSP will encourage CBOs to negotiate and mobilize \nthe landlords in the respective villages to provide the sharecroppers with access to social services planned under the \nDSSP.  The  DSSP  will  support  LGs  to  develop  strategies  to  target  particularly  vulnerable  populations,  and  track \nbenefits for the different ethnic and socioeconomic groups.   \n \nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\nStakeholder  analysis:  A  cross  section  of  stakeholders,  which  includes,  members  of  Sindh  assembly,  councilors, \ngovernment officials, representatives from all tiers of LGs, NGOs, CBOs, media, and members of civil society from 16 \ndistricts  participated  in  three  workshops.  The  proposed  DSSP  components  were  discussed and recommendations \nwere  made  related  to  finance  and  governance,  education,  health,  water  and  sanitation,  public  and  private \npartnerships, and gender issues.    \n\nParticipation  strategy:  The  reforms  and  capacity  building  for  LGs,  NGOs,  and  CBOs  will  strengthen the capacity of \nthese institutions for community outreach and secure the active involvement of different social and economic groups, \nscheduled  caste,  especially  poor  and  women  in  local-level  planning  and  monitoring  of  social  services  in  their \nrespective communities. The public and private partnerships, formation of working groups at the ward level and local-\nlevel monitoring will enhance local ownership, participation of different social groups, scheduled caste, the poor and \nwomen in improving access to social services. \n \nD. \n\nGender Strategy \n\nIn  particular  in  rural  Sindh,  but  also  in  urban  areas,  the  majority  of  women  continue  to  be  restricted  in  mobility, \ndiscriminated  against,  exploited,  and  denied  access  to  economic  resources  and  assets.  The  health  and  social \ndevelopment indicators for women are poor compared with those of men. The literacy rate is 40% for males and 13% \nfor  females  over  10  years  of  age  in  rural  areas.  Infant  mortality  rate  for  female  infants  is  105  per  1,000  live  births \ncompared with 93 per 1,000 live births for male infants. The Devolved Social Services Program (DSSP) will follow the \nGender Reform Action Plan to provide leadership and labor opportunities to women, and address and monitor social \nconstraints related to social service delivery for women, especially poor women.   \n \nThe  recent  Local  Government  Ordinance  introduced  33%  of  reserve  seats  for  women  in  local  governments.  The \nfollowing strategies will be followed during DSSP implementation:  \n \n\nContinue  policy  dialogue  with  the  provincial  and  local  governments  to  mobilize  support  for  the \nGender Reform Action Plan. \n\nProvide  capacity  building  for  all  women  councilors  of  local  governments  and  community-based \norganizations (CBOs), in coordination with other programs.  \n\nPromote inclusion of women councilors in local government committees, and inclusion of women in \ngeneral in decision-making bodies, including school management committees.  \n\nInclude  gender  issues  in  district  government  and  taluka/town  municipal  administration  plans  and \npolicy reform studies, including on affordability of services. \n\nGive preference to women\u2019s CBOs in selecting CBOs and building their institutional capacity.   \n\nInclude grassroots women leaders from different socioeconomic groups in planning social service \ndelivery at the village level; and design social mobilization activities to target poor women\u2019s active \ninvolvement in planning of social services and access to services. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv)  \n\n(v)  \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f70\n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n\n \n \nE. \n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLabor \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples (Ethnic \nMinorities) \n\nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities  \nExtreme Poverty \nAnd \nVulnerability \n\n(vii) \n\nStrengthen  existing  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems  to  allow  gender-disaggregated monitoring \nand  evaluation  of  social  services,  and,  to  the  extent  possible,  also  for  vulnerable  groups  like  poor \npeople and ethnic minorities.  \n\nProvide training for CBOs to use gender-disaggregated monitoring indicators.  \n\n(viii) \n \n3. \nThe DSSP includes the services of  a poverty and gender specialist for a period of 24 months, who will be \nbased in the Provincial Support Unit. The consultant will, in the context of the Gender Reform Action Plan, (i) identify \npriorities,  opportunities  and  constraints  for  addressing  gender  issues  during  DSSP  through  discussions  with  all \nstakeholders,  (ii)  prepare  a  gender  action  plan  to  operationalize  and  monitor  the  above  strategies  and  any  other \npriority activities identified during implementation; and (iii) support implementation and monitoring of the action plan. \n\nSocial Safeguards and other Social Risks \n\n \n\nSignificant/ \nNonsignificant/ \nNone  \n\n \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nPlan Required \n\nResettlement  \n\nNonsignificant  Monitoring construction of new schools and water schemes to \n\n No \n\nAffordability  \n\n  \n\nsee if there is any resettlement, in which case, action will be \ntaken as per standard ADB guidelines.  \nNonsignificant  DSSP will generally increase subsidy to the poor.
