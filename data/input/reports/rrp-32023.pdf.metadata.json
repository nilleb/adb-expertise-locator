Justice  is  a  function  of  the  relationship  between\ninstitutions  responsible  for  delivering  entitlements  (public\ngoods  and  services)  predictably,  affordably,  and\naccountably,  and  the  ability  of  citizens  to  secure  and\nsustain  their  access  to  key  sets  of  assets.  The  pro-poor\nrationale of this Program assumes that efforts to limit the\nvulnerability  of  the  poor  to  the  vagaries  of  systems  of\nadministrative,  political,  civil,  and  criminal  justice  are  at\nleast  as  important  as  macroeconomic  performance  in\npoverty reduction. In addition, the present legal framework\nand  the  performance  of  judicial  institutions  significantly\nin\nconstrain  market-based  economic  growth,  and \nparticular  hinder  foreign  direct  investment  as  well  as  the\ngrowth of small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n(iii) strengthen \n\nthereby  reduce \n\nThe key development objective of the AJP is to assist the\nGovernment  to  improve  access  to  justice  so  as  to\n(i) provide security and ensure equal protection under the\nlaw  to  citizens,  in  particular  the  poor;  (ii)  secure  and\nsustain  entitlements  and \nthe  poor's\nvulnerability; \nlegitimacy  of  state\ninstitutions;  and  (iv) create  conditions  conducive  to  pro-\npoor growth, especially by fostering investor\u2019s confidence.\nThe Program will contribute to this aim by supporting five\ninter-related  governance  objectives:  (i) providing  a  legal\nbasis  for  judicial,  policy,  and  administrative  reforms;\n(ii) improving  the  efficiency,  timeliness,  and  effectiveness\nin  judicial1  and  police  services;  (iii) supporting  greater\n\nthe \n\n                  \n\n1  The  term  \u201cjudicial,\u201d  unless  the  context  indicates  otherwise,  includes  institutions  responsible  for  the  delivery  of\n\nadministrative justice, such as the offices of the ombudsman at various levels.\n\n\f     Classification\n\nPoverty Intervention\n\n     Social Issues\n\n     Gender and Development\n\nii\n\nfor \n\n(iv) \n\njustice  services \n\nthe  mandates  of  reformed \n\nequity  and  accessibility \nin \nthe\nimproving  predictability  and\nvulnerable  poor; \nconsistency between fiscal and human resource allocation\nand \njudicial  and  police\ninstitutions at the federal, provincial and local government\ntransparency  and\nlevels;  and \naccountability  in  the  performance  of  the  judiciary,  the\npolice and administrative justice institutions.\n\n(v) ensuring  greater \n\nThematic: Good Governance\n                 Gender and Development\n\nThe  AJP  is  a  key  part  of  nationwide  efforts  to  positively\ninfluence  the  exercise  of  political,  administrative  and\njudicial power so as to improve the accessibility  of  public\nentitlements for all citizens, in particular the poor, women,\nand  minorities.  Although  no  adverse  social  impact  is\nanticipated, the AJP will actively prompt critical public and\nprofessional debate about important social issues and will\nbe  one  modest  part  of  larger  efforts  to  transform  the\nculture of governance in Pakistan.\n\nfairly  and  accountably.  Through \n\nThe AJP will tackle gender issues through the creation of\ncompetent  legal,  judicial  and  police  institutions  through\nrights  can  be\nwhich  existing  basic/constitutional \nthe\nimplemented \nreformed  Law  Commission  as  well  as  the  Women's\nCommission,  the  AJP  will  promote  research  and  debate\non  the  quality  and  equality  of  existing  laws  and  through\nthis  help  build  constituencies  for  change  and  build\nconsensus for reform. The institutional focus will articulate\ngender  interests  through  the  focus  on  the  quality  of\nservices  delivered  by  government  and  judicial  institutions\nand, on the \u201cdemand\u201d side, on the empowerment focus of\nthe  AJP.  Concrete  steps  will  include  revision  of  service\nrules for judges to remove gender biases and facilitate the\ninduction  of  more  women  judges,  offering  of  special\ncourses for potential women judges, and training courses\nin  gender  sensitization  for  the  judiciary  and  police,\nthat  promote  gender\ncoupled  with  service \nrules \nsensitization.  Civil  society  groups  engaged \nlegal\nempowerment  activities  will  be  eligible  to  tap  funding\nunder the Legal Empowerment Fund (LEF). Thus, through\na  combination  of  policy  changes,  capacity  building,  and\nsupport  for  civil  society  initiatives,  the  AJP  will  begin  to\naddress serious gender issues in the legal system.\n\nin \n\nNo  adverse  environmental \nis  anticipated.\nConsistent with its institutional focus, the AJP will support\nthe  enforcement  of  environmental  laws  through  the\nestablishment of environmental tribunals already provided\n\nimpact \n\n     Environmental Issues\n\n\fiii\n\nfor in the law, and by ensuring that any conflict of interest\nis  removed  by  different  persons  heading  the  provincial\nenvironmental  protection  agencies \nthe\nprovincial  environment  departments.

The Report also describes\nproposed TA for Supporting and Monitoring Progress under the AJP, and if the proposed loans\nare  approved  by  the  Board,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  shall\napprove this TA on a grant basis.\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nGovernance  has emerged  as Pakistan\u2019s foremost development priority. Corruption  and\npolitical  instability  in  the  1990s  have  resulted  in  waning  business  confidence,  lower  economic\ngrowth, increasing poverty, and a serious undermining of state institutions and the rule of law.\nCentral  to  this  malaise  is  the  alienation  of  the  citizenry  from  the  state  and  a  feeling  of\ndisempowerment against abuse of power by officials.\n\n3.\nCentral  to  the  Government's  commitment  to  governance  reforms  is  strengthening  the\nrule  of  law  and  reforming  key  institutions.  The  local  government  plan,  put  into  effect  on  14\nAugust 2001, has as one of its objectives to bring \u201cjustice to the doorstep\u201d of the people. The\nlong-term  impact  of  these  reforms  is  uncertain,  but  the  present  Government's  commitment,  in\nboth  policy  rhetoric  and  practice,  and  in  the  broad-ranging  scope  of  the  reforms  suggests\nreadiness  to  confront  serious  constraints  to  reforms  that  have  eluded  Pakistan  since\nIndependence. The most serious constraints are found in the political culture, and in sanctions\nand  incentives  bearing  on  the  judiciary,  police,  and  administration.  The  judiciary  has  been\nrepeatedly  compromised  by  political  practices,  and  has  not  garnered  the  necessary  degree  of\nindependence from the executive, especially in terms of securing an adequate and predictable\nlevel of resourcing. Similarly, the police services remain affected by a colonial legacy that sets\nthem  in  an  oppressive  relationship  with  the  citizenry  as  the  police  are  forced  to  extract  non-\nformal payments from citizens to secure even basic police services.\n\n4.\nGovernance reforms in Pakistan have been opposed by powerful pro-status quo vested\ninterests. The severe fiscal deficit puts additional restraints on a reform agenda. But Pakistan's\nlong  term  economic  recovery  depends  on  the  effectiveness  of  governance  reforms.  The  AJP\naddresses  some  of  the  most  fundamental  reforms  necessary  for  improved  governance,\nincluding  greater  transparency  and  accountability  of  officials,  improved  public  access  to  basic\nentitlements, and more predictable and adequate resourcing for the fundamental public good of\nlaw  and  order.  The  agreement  on  the  AJP  Program  Loan  is  reflected  in  the  Government\u2019s\nDevelopment Policy Letter and the attached Policy Matrix and Performance Review in Appendix\n1.\n\n5.\nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  support  for  legal  and  judicial  reform  in  Pakistan\ncomprises  two  completed  TAs1  and  two  ongoing  ones.2  Reform  proposals  have  been\nindigenously  driven  through  multilayered  stakeholder  participation.  A  Fact-Finding  Mission\nvisited Pakistan in 1999. Processing was suspended due to the change in regime and political\nuncertainties.  After  resumption  of  dialogue  with  the  new  Government  and  ADB\u2019s  further  TA\n\n                  \n\n1  TA  2979-PAK:  Strengthening  Government  Legal  Services  and  the  Subordinate  Judiciary,  for  US$150,000,\napproved on 31 December 1997; and TA 3015-PAK: Legal and Judicial Reform Project, for US$995,000, approved\non 7 May 1998.\n\n2  TA 3433-PAK: Strengthening of Institutional Capacity for Judicial and Legal Reform, for US$2,900,000, approved\non  27 April  2000;  and  TA  3640-PAK:  Supporting Access to Justice under the Local Government Plan,  for\nUS$150,000, approved on 19 March 2001.\n\n\fsupport, another Fact-finding Mission3 visited Pakistan from 20 June to 11 July 2001, followed\nby  an  Appraisal  Mission  from  20  August  to  12  September  20014  to  firm  up  the  scope  of  and\nimplementation arrangements for AJP.\n\n2\n\nIII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\n\nA. \n\nThe Economy\n\nPakistan  faces  severe  macroeconomic  imbalances,  declining  economic  growth,  rising\n6.\npoverty, and underdeveloped human capital. During the 1990s, the fiscal deficit and the current\naccount  deficit  as  proportions  of  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  averaged  6.9  percent  and\n4.5  percent,  respectively.  The  average  economic  growth  rate  decelerated  from  6.5  percent  in\nthe  1980s  to  5.4  percent  in  the  first  half  of  the  1990s,  and  to  3.6  percent  during  the  last  few\nyears. The incidence of poverty increased from less than 20 percent in the late-1980s to over 35\npercent today.\n\nDuring  FY2001,  the  Government  continued  to  pursue  macroeconomic  stabilization\n7.\npolicies coupled with structural reform, and the GDP growth was estimated at nearly 2.6 percent\nthat year. In addition, the savings and investment rates, at less than 15 percent of GDP in 2001,\nremained  low,  and  the  agriculture  sector  continued  to  dominate  the  economy.  Inflation,  as\nmeasured by changes in the Consumer Price Index, was 4.4 percent in FY2001 as against 3.6\npercent  in  FY2000.  The  higher  inflation  in  FY2001  is  mainly  attributable  to  an  increase  in\npetroleum  prices.  The  drought  (which  ended  only  recently),  weak  external  demand,  falling\ncommodity prices, and persistently high world oil prices adversely affected Pakistan\u2019s external\nsector  performance.  Declining  unit  prices  of  Pakistan  exports  resulted  in  failure  to  meet  the\nexport  target  of  US$10  billion  estimated  for  FY2001.  The  budget  deficit  of  5.2  percent  for\nFY2001 was the lowest fiscal deficit in 20 years. In FY2001, revenue collection increased by 12\npercent. Despite this growth in tax collection, overall tax revenue collection in FY2001 was 10\npercent lower than the target.\n\n8.\nCrises  in  the  management  of  public  finances  and  external  balances  dominated  the\neconomic  policy  agenda  in  Pakistan  during  the  1990s.  However,  despite  all  efforts,  and  three\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) programs between 1988 and 1999, adequate progress was\nnot  made  in  addressing  the  macroeconomic  imbalances.  Frequent  changes  of  government\nduring  this  period  contributed  to  uneven  commitment  to  reform,  with  an  attendant  negative\nimpact on growth. The imposition of economic sanctions following the nuclear tests of May 1998\nseriously affected an economy already weakened by a large public debt.\n\n9.\nChronic fiscal and external deficits have resulted in accumulation of large domestic and\nexternal debt. Total debt (both domestic and external) equaled 115 percent of GDP in FY2001,\nand  interest  payments  on  total  debt  accounted  for  almost  50  percent  of  the  total  current\nexpenditure of the Government. Of Pakistan\u2019s \u201ctwin\u201d debt problem, the external debt is the more\ncritical issue for short to medium term economic management. In FY 1998, the ratio of external\ndebt servicing to export earnings was nearly 35 percent and even after debt rescheduling, the\n\n                  \n\n3  The Fact-Finding Mission comprised H. Sharif, Senior Counsel (Co-Mission Leader); D. Porter, Senior Governance\nSpecialist, Program Department (West), Office of the Director; and B. Murg, Intern, Office of the General Counsel.\nMr. H.J Yu, Senior Programs Officer (Co-Mission Leader) joined the Mission from 9 to 11 July 2001.\n\n4  The  Mission  comprised  Messrs.  Hamid  Sharif,  Senior  Counsel  (Co-Mission  Leader),  Doug  Porter,  Senior\nGovernance Specialist, and Bradley Murg, Intern, Office of the General Counsel (20 August to 1 September 2001).\nMr.  H.J  Yu,  Senior  Programs  Officer  (Co-Mission  Leader)  joined  the  Mission  from  21  to  24  August  and  4  to\n12 September 2001. Mr. Sultan Hafeez Rahman, Manager, PW1 assisted the Mission for high level dialogue from\n6 to 12 September 2001.\n\n\f3\n\nexternal debt service ratio in FY2001 was over 23 percent. As of 30 June 2001, Pakistan\u2019s total\noutstanding external debt is estimated at PRs2,224 billion ($36 billion).\n\n10.\nIn the backdrop of such heavy indebtedness, Pakistan negotiated IMF Standby Program\namounting  to  US$600  million  in  November  2000.  Pakistan  has  successfully  completed  this\nprogram  as  indicated  in  IMF\u2019s  last  review  in  September  2001.  The  country  is  currently\nnegotiating a Poverty Reduction Growth Facility Program with IMF, to be put in place by the end\nof 2001.\n\nThe  terrorist  acts  in  the  United  States  (US)  on  11  September  2001  have  dramatically\n11.\naltered  the  situation  in  Pakistan.  The  Government\u2019s  immediate  and  strong  support  of  the  US\ngovernment  in  its  war  on  global  terrorism  has  resulted  in  the  lifting  of  sanctions  by  the  US  as\nwell as by Canada. The US has committed a US$600 million financial package and has plans to\nprovide substantially more assistance. Other governments have pledged an increase in aid. The\nUS  and  other  key  funders  have  also  offered  to  reschedule  or  forgive  substantial  amounts  of\nPakistan\u2019s  bilateral  debt.    While  there  is  expected  to  be  an  increased  inflow  of  financial\nassistance, the tensions in the region have placed Pakistan\u2019s exports under pressure, as export\norders  are  being  cancelled  in  such  key  items  as  cotton,  which  is  Pakistan\u2019s  most  important\nexport  crop.  The  import  trade  is  also  being  disrupted,  as  some  international  carriers,  due  to  a\nlack of coverage for war risk, are refusing port calls to Pakistan. Apart from the impacts on the\ntrade  side  and  the  balance  of  payments,  the  fiscal  deficit  and  inflation  could  rise.  A  general\nweakening  of  confidence  would  also  put  pressure  on  the  exchange  rate.  These  effects  would\nforce a further slowdown in GDP growth, estimated at only 2.9 percent in FY2001, which could\nderail prospects of a recovery over the medium term.\n\nB. \n\nPoverty and Justice in Pakistan\n\n12.\nIt  is  generally  accepted  that  poverty  fell  through  the  1980s,  but  rose  again  over  the\n1990s to 30-34 percent of the population.5 Poverty in Pakistan appears to exhibit seven features\nof  direct  relevance  to  the  approach  and  rationale  of  the  AJP.  First,  income  distribution  is\nrelatively  equal  compared  with  countries  of  similar  income  level.6  Second,  although  the\nincidence of poverty is high, turnover among the poor is also rapid. In one study, 46-51 percent\nof households left the category of \u201cpoverty\u201d from one year to the next. Rather than focusing on\nthe symptoms of poverty (such as income gap or social sector indicators), this suggests a focus\non the probable causes of entry and exit into poverty. Third, although rural areas appear to have\na  higher  incidence  of  poverty  than  urban  areas,  several  studies  report  a  trend  towards  the\nopposite, partly as a result of rapid urbanization (now 36 percent), which is high for South Asia\n(28  percent).  Fourth,  a  large  proportion  of  the  poor  are  dependent  on  informal  sector  wage\nlabor.\n\n13.\nThe fifth and sixth features of poverty in Pakistan provide further focus on vulnerability.\nWhile  relatively  egalitarian  in  terms  of  \u201cincome  poverty,\u201d  the  capacity  of  the  poor  to  access\npublic  entitlements\u2013like  political  processes  or  goods  and  services  that  determine  human\ndevelopment\u2013contrasts  strikingly  with  that  of  the  rich.  For  instance,  literacy,  which  is  critically\nimportant in awareness of and access to entitlements, is highly unequal. There are tremendous\ndisparities in human development (defined as enlarging people's choices in a way that enables\nthem to lead longer, healthier and fuller lives). Most key indicators, like infant mortality, fertility,\npopulation growth, literacy rates and primary school enrollment remain low compared with the\n\n                  \n\n5  At least four caveats are in order: (i) there is no consistent interpretation of poverty, or a \u201cpoverty line\u201d in Pakistan;\n(ii)  multiple,  conflicting  methodologies  makes  comparative  analysis  difficult;  (iii)  the  quality  of  studies  is  variable;\nand (iv) data is of poor quality.\n\n6  Income  inequality  appears  to  have  fallen  in  the  1960s,  increased  in  the  1970s,  fallen  in  the  early  and  middle\n\n1980s, and fallen again in the 1990s. The Gini coefficient in 1997/98 was 0.40.\n\n\f4\n\naverage for low-income countries, and most indicators are markedly worse for women and girls.\nFinally,  and  not  least  important,  a  seventh  feature  stands  out  in  the  poor's  perceptions  of\npoverty:  they  highlight  increasing  insecurity  and  vulnerability  arising  from  sectarian  violence,\ncommunal clashes, and declining law and order.\n\n1.\n\nPoverty, Governance, and Vulnerability\n\n14.\nPoverty  reflects  social  and  political  processes  that  are  mediated  through  a  range  of\ninstitutions.  Typically,  institutional  \u201cfailure\u201d  is  generalized  as  a  \u201cproblem  of  governance.\u201d  While\nPakistan  enjoyed  significant  annual  GDP  growth  for  over  50  years  (1947-1997),  the  control  of\npolitical  power  and  government  by  a  small  elite  ensured  that  institutionalized  decision  making\nwas  irrelevant  to  the  wider  needs  of  the  population  and,  as  a  consequence,  poverty  has\nremained widespread.7\n\n15.\nThe existence of high-quality public institutions that mediate people's access to services\nessential  for  human,  physical,  and  financial  capital  is  as  important  as  the  assets  themselves.\nThe capacity of public institutions indeed strongly influences whether a state is \u201cdevelopmental\u201d\nor  \u201cpredatory\u201d,  a  key  theme  in  the  AJP.  Understanding  the  relationship  among  \u201cgovernance,\u201d\npoverty,  and  vulnerability  from  the  viewpoint  of  the  poor  highlights  two  points  relevant  to  the\nrationale for the AJP. First, while poverty manifests as material deprivation\u2013hunger, the lack of\nfood, shelter, clothing\u2013the poor also highlight common psychological and political dimensions to\npoverty\u2013lack of power and voice; feelings of dependency, shame, and humiliation. Poor people\nhighlight  lack  of  access  to  basic  infrastructure  and  services.  But  whereas  official  accounts  of\npoverty  highlight  the  difference  between  rich  and  poor  in  indicators  of  educational,  health,  or\nother standards of attainment, the poor rarely have such a static view of what is required in their\nlives. Education is valued, for instance, but only if it offers an escape from poverty, not in its own\nright.  Lack  of  access  to  affordable,  effective  health  care  is  dreaded,  not  just  as  a  source  of  ill\nhealth,  important  though  that  is,  but  as  a  source  of  vulnerability  and,  ultimately,  destitution.\nFinally, while the poor are concerned about lack of income, they frequently attribute this to the\nconstraints they face in managing their assets (human, material, social, political), through which\nthey cope with their vulnerability.\n\n16.\nSecond,  most  poor  people  recognize  that  the  state  has  responsibilities  to  provide\naffordable,  effective,  and  equitable  public  goods  and  services.  They  feel  the  government  has\nfailed  to  deliver  and  indeed  that  their  interactions  with  local  state  institutions  are  marked  by\nrudeness,  humiliation,  harassment,  and  corruption.  The  poor  often  perceive  their  interactions\nwith these agencies as increasing their vulnerability to erosion of important household, political,\ncivil, natural resource, and social assets. Globally, the impact of a brutalizing police force and a\ncorrupt  judiciary  is,  for  instance,  remarked  by  the  poor  far  more  often  than  is  attended  to  in\nofficial accounts of indicators and causes of poverty focusing, for instance, on access to health\nor  education.8  These  intermediating  institutions,  in  particular  those  of  the  local  state,  are\nparticularly  demoralizing  for  the  poor,  who  already  feel  defenseless  against  the  power  of  the\nstate and the elite.\n\n                  \n\n7  Husain, I. 1999: Pakistan: The Economy of an Elitist State, Oxford University Press, Oxford.\n8 This  refers  to  global  experience.  In  Pakistan,  comparative  research  is  only  beginning.  For  instance,  under  a\nCIET/NRB survey of over 10,000 respondents (CIET 2001: 'Community Monitoring of public services and human\nrights  -  summaries'  draft  results),  52-60  percent  of  respondents  were  dissatisfied  or  very  dissatisfied  with  police\nservices, compared with 38-40 percent with the courts, 28 percent with government health services, and around\n15% with primary education.\n\n\f2.\n\nInstitutions and Access to Justice\n\n5\n\n17.\nIn  most  aspects  of  their  lives,  the  poor  rely  on  informal  justice  and  dispute  resolution\nforum  that  in  some  respects  have  been  more  effective  than  formal  mechanisms.  In  Pakistan,\nthis is especially true, although for the population overall, it appears that the courts remain the\nmost  popular  forums  for  dispute  resolution.9  Local  panchayats  (traditional  council  of  elders/\nleaders) are popular, in the main for their ability to maintain peace and harmony, their low cost,\nand  their  link  to  local  communities  and  families.  Panchayats  tend  not  to  be  known  for  their\ncommitment  to  the  truth  or  ability  to  avoid  vested  interests.  While  the  informal  legal  system\noffers  cheaper  resolution  of  disputes,  it  is  more  difficult  to  enforce  decisions,  and  its\ndeliberations are frequently manipulated by local elites (i.e., members of the dominant faction);\nas a result the panchayats are unable to hear both parties on an equal basis. Furthermore, the\ninformal  legal  system  is  insufficient  for  adequate  market-based  economic  growth,  and\nconstrains  significant  foreign  direct  investment  as  well  as  the  growth  of  small-  and  medium-\nsized enterprises.10\n\n18.\nThe  vulnerable  poor  are  especially  affected  by  their  relations  with  a  dysfunctional  and\npredatory local state. It is at this level that the connection between vulnerability and governance\nhas its greatest meaning. It is at this interface that dispensation of justice in the wider sense fails\nand  disempowers,  particularly  the  poor.  Vulnerability  is  exacerbated  by  the  everyday\nharassment, underperformance, exclusion, and denial of basic rights by public officials of people\nwho  are  disadvantaged  by  virtue  of  gender,  ethnicity,  or  economic  or  political  power.  This\nsource of vulnerability is marked in three aspects of the lives of the poor. Vulnerability is much\nincreased  by  local  officials  responsible  for  licensing  and  regulating  economic  activities  who\ntypically extract rent from informal sector workers. Further, and well known, the vulnerability of\nthe poor is continually reaffirmed by the corruption of local cadre/officials that hampers access\nto public goods and services \u2013 health, education, land management, etc. Finally, the failure of\ngovernment institutions to provide law and order and security is a function of the existent police,\nlegal, and judicial structures.\n\nA. \n\nBackground and Recent Performance\n\nIV. \n\nSECTOR CONTEXT\n\n19.\nVulnerability is greatly effected by the performance of public institutions responsible for\nfour domains of justice, viz., judicial, policing, administrative, and political. These institutions of\nthe provincial and local government act on, influence, or control the conditions under which the\npoor can secure, and sustain, assets that determine their vulnerability.\n\n1. \n\nJudiciary\n\n20.\nIn  Pakistan  today,  the  level  of  public  confidence  in  the  judiciary,  and  especially  the\nsubordinate  district  courts,  threatens  its  institutional  legitimacy.11  The  basic  legitimacy  of  the\nlegal  and  judicial  system  matters  a  great  deal  to  Pakistan's  economic,  political  and  social\ndevelopment and is profoundly important to improved access to justice in the administrative and\n\n                  \n\n9  Research  sponsored  under  TA  3640-PAK: Supporting Access to Justice Under the Local Government Plan,  for\n\nUS$150,000, approved on 18 October 2001, preliminary results.\n\n10  Greif,  Avner.  1994.  \u201cContracting,  Enforcement,  and  Efficiency:  Economic  Beyond  the  Law.\u201d  Proceedings of the\n\nAnnual Bank Conference on Development Economics, Washington D.C.

The  vast  majority  of  Pakistanis,  ranging  from  businesspeople  to  vulnerable\ngroups,  share  a  common  bond\u2013they  eschew  lawlessness  and  desire  a  more  predictable\nenvironment in which to conduct their affairs. \"The interests of powerful investment houses and\npowerless  Pakistani  citizens  in  a  functioning  legal  system  are  not  mutually  exclusive.\nPredictability and fairness are the hallmarks of a legal system that works.\"12\n\n21.\nThe  basic  problems  of  judicial  administration  in  Pakistan  relate  to  governance  and\nadministration,  case  management  and  delay  reduction,  automation  and  court  information\nsystems,  human  resources,  and  infrastructure.  The  practical  manifestations  of  these  problems\nin Pakistan include the following:\n\n(i) \n\nA high percentage of cases are filed but not dismissed,\n\n(ii) \n\nFew cases are settled before trial (90 percent go to trial),\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nA  high  level  of  \"unmet  demand\"  is  revealed  by  those  who  would  access  the\ncourts  with  meritorious  claims  but  for  the  unpredictable  results  that  attend  the\napplication  (unpredictability  being  a  core  element  of  illegitimacy  in  judicial\norgans),\n\nRelated to the previous point, confidence in the courts is so low that it provides\nthe  perverse  incentive  to  aggrieved  parties  to  remain  so,  rather  than  accessing\nthe courts, or even threatening to access the courts (because the threat provides\nno meaningful inducement for the injurer to settle),\n\n(v) \n\nA high percentage of cases are appealed,\n\n(vi) \n\nJudgments  enjoy  virtually  no  voluntary  compliance;  few  judgements  are  self-\nexecuting, and the execution of judgement is woefully delinquent, if it happens at\nall,\n\n(vii) \n\nThe legal/judicial system provides little, if any, socially beneficial deterrence,\n\n(viii)  The motivation to sue, and the ultimate goal of litigation, is mostly to delay,\n\n(ix) \n\nRisk allocation mechanisms, such as insurance, are woefully underdeveloped,\n\nSelf-help in criminal cases is traditional and sanctioned, in part, by law; criminal\nprosecution for resort to self-help is unlikely, and conviction absolutely remote,\n\nInformation known about the other party's case is virtually nil except through the\ntrial medium (less than 2 percent of cases have any discovery whatsoever).\n\n2. \n\nPolice\n\nA large body of research suggests that weak property rights amplify poverty. But the rule\n22.\nof law underpins more than property and contractual rights; in a society where up to 40 percent\nof  the  population  are  judged  as  living  in  poverty,  and  in  effect  unable  to  access  their\nentitlements  through  the  administrative,  judicial,  or  political  systems,  this  powerlessness  both\nmanifests in and exacerbates lawlessness. Ironically, while the just and effective application of\nlaws  governing  people's  access  to  basic  entitlements  is  highlighted  in  the  poor's  accounts  of\n\n12  Pakistan 2010 Study: an Agenda for More Effective Governance, 1998, p. 41.\n\n                  \n\n\f7\n\npoverty,  analysis  of  and  support  to  institutions  responsible  for  delivery  of  this  primary  'public\ngood  has,  until  the  present  ADB  initiative,  been  greatly  underplayed  in  externally  supported\ngovernment  poverty  reduction  efforts.13  It  has  now  been  acknowledged  that  a  weak  and\nunaccountable  police  forces  weakens  social  cohesion,  and  greatly  increases  poor  people's\nvulnerability  in  terms  of  access  to  public  services,  economic  livelihoods,  and  law  and  order.\nDisintegration  of  institutional  checks  and  balances  on  police  action  can  lead  to  immense\nrepression and exploitation.\n\nDeclining  professionalism,  weak \n\n23.\nincentive  and  sanction  systems,  and  political\ninterference  have  over  time  eroded  the  capacity  of  law  enforcement  agencies,  particularly  the\npolice. This has contributed to the difficulty of making informal sector survival strategies work,\nas small traders cannot be guaranteed the protection of law and may even be harassed by law\nenforcing agencies. The average cost of police services\u2013charges made on the public\u2013is on the\norder  of  PRs30,000-35,000  per  episode.14  The  severest  form  of  injustice  affecting  the  poor  is\npolice harassment of individuals. Minority or socially excluded groups are particularly vulnerable\nto police extortion and harassment. Patronage can be solicited, but this often forces the poor to\nsell their assets, thus pushing them further into poverty, humiliation, and silence.\n\n24.\nLack  of  professionalism  in  the  police  force  makes  people  vulnerable  to  threats,\nintimidation,  and  abuse  from  those  in  power.  Together  with  weak  social  cohesion,  declining\nconfidence in police, and an inadequate accountability system, this severely constrains people's\nability to hold officials to account, access public services, and sustain informal sector economic\nlivelihoods.  A  recent  focal  group  tasked  under  the  seven-point  reform  agenda  announced  in\nOctober  1999,  comprising  civil  and  police  officers,  lawyers,  journalists,  and  members  of  the\npublic,  concluded  that  the  police  were  incapable  of  confronting  the  challenges  posed  by\nfundamental  changes  in  the  nature  and  extent  of  crime  due  in  large  measure  to  an  outdated\nlegal and institutional framework, and arbitrary and whimsical mismanagement of the police by\nthe executive authority of the government at every level.\n\nSince  its  creation  under  the  Police  Act  of  1861,  the  predominant  function  of  the  police\n25.\nhas  been  simply  to  control.  From  its  inception,  police  mandates  were  not  funded.  This\nencouraged rent-seeking and extortion, which continue. Police mandates are still unfunded, with\nthe  average  budget  for  a  police  station  per  year  being  a  mere  PRs8,000  (US$120),  and  the\nforensic capacity of the police limited to distinguishing between human and animal blood.\n\n26.\nPoliticization  has  debilitated  professionalism  of  the  police  force.  This  has  weakened  its\ncapacity to serve the rule of law. Furthermore, an alliance between the local political elite, the\ndistrict administration, and the magistracy (under the control of the executive) has undermined\nconstitutional  rights  and  other  protections  provided  under  the  law.  Recruitment  based  on\npolitical patronage or corruption has led to a grave loss of public confidence in the police.\n\nProsecution functions are split among the provincial police, the department of law, and\n27.\nthe Office of the Advocate General. Arraignment procedures and lower classes of offenses are\nhandled  by  police  sub-inspectors.  The  current  prosecution  service  is  understaffed  and\nundertrained.  Lack  of  operational  independence  enhances  the  misuse  of  the  office,  and\nfacilitates political influence and prosecutorial misconduct. All of this has resulted in a conviction\nrate  of  37  percent  or  even  less  in  some  provinces,  well  below  the  international  average.  This\n\n                  \n\n13  The  initiatives  and  recommendations  under  the  AJP  have  also  been  incorporated  recently  in  the  current  draft\nInterim  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper  (Ministry  of  Finance,  July  2001),  which  is  perhaps  the  first  official\nrecognition of the links between policing and poverty.\n\n14 CIET/NRB survey of over 10,000 respondents (CIET 2001: 'Community Monitoring of public services and human\n\nrights - summaries' draft results).\n\n\fhas  decreased  public  trust  in  the  legal  system,  while  increasing  the  propensity  of  criminals  to\ncommit crimes.\n\n8\n\n3. \n\nAdministrative Services\n\nAnalysis  of  the  performance  of  administrative  services  reveals  serious  inadequacies.\n28.\nFirst, while the poor rely on public services (health, education, etc.), utilization is low as a result\nof  poor  delivery,  access  constraints  due  to  corruption,  and  poor  service-orientation  of  staff.\nSecond, the capacity of government to convert scarce resources into services is poor.15 Third,\nthe imposition of extra-legal taxes, fees, and other payments for all services places enormous\nburdens on the poor. Many households borrow large sums of money, sell assets, and/or remove\nchildren from school to meet the expense of poor quality public services.\n\nThe  office  of  the  Federal  Ombudsman  was  established  in  1981  to  deal  with\n29.\n\u201cmaladministration,\u201d  including  corruption,  and  to  improve  the  responsiveness  of  public\ninstitutions.  The  system,  now  extended  to  all  provinces  except  North  West  Frontier  Province\n(NWFP), has provided some relief in individual cases, but has not dealt with systemic failures\nthat  lead  to  individual  grievances  in  the  first  place.  The  number  of  complaints  filed  with  the\nFederal  Ombudsman  against  officials  more  than  tripled  during  1985-1998.  Most  complaints\nrelated to public utilities. The proportion of complaints concerning arbitrary decisions has risen\nprecipitously.  Complaints  are  placed  in  one  of  five  categories:  delay,  inattention,  neglect,\narbitrary decisions, and corruption.16 While alarming, these trends say nothing of those who are\nactually silenced by dysfunctional institutions:\n\nIf  anybody  complains  or  protests  against  this  corruption,  they  are  struck  off  the\nlists of  all  support  services,  because it is the same Local Zakat Committee that\nrecommends  names  for  the  assistance  programs  run  by  different  Government\nDepartments.17\n\nAmong the administrative issues most important to the vulnerable poor, in particular to\n30.\nindigenous people, are land titling and property rights. The current system of cadastral mapping,\ntitling, and registration leads to manipulation by the relatively well off and erodes the expansion\nof property rights to the poor.  The result has been a massive influx of land-related cases to the\ncourts. Due to the antiquated system in which entries in the registers are rebuttable, claims and\ncounterclaims  continue  for  years  and  often  lead  to  criminal  cases.  These  civil  and  criminal\ncases add to the growing delays in courts.\n\n4. \n\nPolitical Justice\n\n31.\nBetter  enforcement  of  political  rights  has  been  shown,  across  the  board,  to  reduce  the\npotential for conflict, thereby averting major sources of social and economic vulnerability for the\npoor. Throughout Pakistan's modern history, participation in the exercise of political rights and\nentitlements  has  been  limited,  and  women  and  the  poor  in  particular  lack  a  political  voice.\nConcentration  of  power  at  the  federal  and  provincial  levels  has  limited  broader  participation\nwhich has led to overrepresentation of feudal and business interests. Local government bodies\n\n                  \n\n15  The  unit  costs  of  local  service  in  education,  for  instance,  are  about  40  percent  higher  in  Pakistan  than  in\ncomparable countries, and dropout rates are high, both indicating substantial wastage of public resources.

The voice of the women is often muted.\n\nThrough  devolution  under  the  new  local  government  structure,  the  Government  is\n32.\ncommitted  to  a  citizen-oriented,  transparent,  and  accountable  government.  Elections  for  the\nlocal  government  bodies  (which  have  a  mandatory  30  percent  representation  for  women  and\nguaranteed representation of labor) have been completed, and the establishment of the intricate\nnetwork  of  local  government  institutions  is  now  under  way.  The  Government  has  also\nannounced for a return to democracy, with elections to be held in October 2002.\n\nB. \n\nConstraints and Issues\n\n33.\nAt  least  eight  law  reform  commissions  have  been  constituted  since  1958  to  review  the\nadministration  of  justice  in  Pakistan.18  Many  have  contained  unassailable  recommendations.\nWhy have these not been implemented? Lack of political will is important, but the reasons are\nmore complex. Three reasons can be cited. First, political and economic instability provide fertile\nground for compromising rules as different groups compete for security. Second, just as repeat\ntransactions  in  the  private  realm  build  trust,  repeat  non-implementation  in  the  public  realm\nbreeds  distrust  and  erodes  legitimacy.  Third,  institutional  reform  in  such  an  environment  is\ndifficult.  Confidence-building  measures  must  be  consistently,  responsively,  and  flexibly\nsequenced, to pierce the veil of cynicism, and to attract supportive constituencies. The principal\nconstraints  to  an  efficient,  citizen-oriented  judicial  system,  each  dealt  with  by  the  AJP,  are\nsummarized in paras. 34-43.\n\n34. Weak Governance and Administration. There is no coordinating body for developing\nlegal and judicial policy, and no system for collecting empirical data to evaluate the performance\nof the system, improve accountability, or recommend reforms. For example, initial results under\nan  ongoing  study  suggest  that  most  disputes  (civil  and  criminal)  relate  to  land.19  This  would\nsuggest a serious inquiry into the land titling and record management systems. Yet nothing has\nbeen done in this respect.\n\nLong Delays. Case management and delay constitute a chronic problem exacting major\n35.\ncosts to Pakistan's economy. Inflation creates incentives to delay because there is no statutory\nadjustment for inflation when a final settlement is reached. The causes of delay are many. Such\nas inadequate and/or incompetent judges, dilatory tactics by the bar, and nonobservance of the\ncivil procedure code.\n\n                  \n\n18 The eight law reform commissions were the: (i) Law Reform Commission of 1958, (ii) Law Reform Commission of\n(1967-1970), (iii)  \"High-Powered\" Law Reforms Committee of 1974 (otherwise known as the Hamood-ur-Rahman\nCommission), (iv) Law Reforms Committee for Recommending Measures for Speedy Disposal of Civil Litigation of\n1978, (v) Secretaries' Committee of 1979, (xi) Salahuddin Ahmed Committee of 1980, (xii) The Committee on the\nIslamization of Laws and Establishment of Qazi Courts of 1980, and (xiii) Commission on the Reform of Civil Law\nof 1993.  Other committees on penal law and the law related to women have published reports since 1993.\n\n19 Preliminary results of TA 3640-PAK: Supporting Access to Justice under the Local Government Plan, US$150,000,\n\napproved on 19  March 2001.\n\n\f10\n\n36.\nLack of Professional Management. There are no professional managers in the courts\nto  handle  budgeting,  personnel,  technology,  or  case  and  court  management.  Record-keeping\nsystems are inadequate.\n\n37.\nLack of Client Focus. The judicial system does not adequately meet the needs of the\npublic.  For  example,  access  to  basic  information  about  court  procedures  is  lacking,  and  court\npublic facilities, especially for women, are inadequate.\n\n38.\nLack  of  Budget  Resources  and  Poor  Incentive  Systems.  International  standards\nindicate at least 15-20 percent of the judicial budget is necessary to cover essential nonsalary\ninputs.  Yet, at the civil court level, the nonsalary percentage of the budget ranges from a mere\n2  percent  in  Sindh  to  4  percent  in  Balochistan,  7  percent  in  NWFP  and  8  percent  in  Punjab.\nNonsalary inputs have declined as a percentage of the budget over the past 10 years to one of\nthe  lowest  in  the  world.20  Incentive  and  sanction  systems  for  the  subordinate  judiciary  are\narchaic  and  fail  to  promote  efficiency  and  a  citizen-oriented  culture  in  which  the  judicial  and\nnonjudicial staff can be held accountable.\n\nInadequate Infrastructure. Court infrastructure is a serious impediment to the effective\n39.\nadministration  of  justice.  The  parlous  state  of  subordinate  court  facilities  conveys  a  negative\nimage of the judicial system, seriously undermining the status and dignity of judicial institutions,\nand is a severe disincentive to attracting capable legal professionals.\n\n40.\nLegal  Empowerment.  The  lack  of  a  tradition  to  disclose  information  relating  to  public\ninstitutions  lies  at  the  root  of  some  of  the  fundamental  barriers  to  accessing  justice  in  the\ncountry. Even when policies are translated into law, the laws are published in English, thereby\ndisenfranchising  the  majority  of  the  population  (the  basic  literacy  rate  is  about  45  percent  in\nUrdu,  the  official  language  of  the  country).  A  large  proportion  of  the  population,  especially\nwomen (women\u2019s literacy is only 33 percent) and the poor remain unaware of their legal rights.\n\nGrievance  Procedures.  The  lack  of  an  established  redress  system  for  citizen\u2019s\n41.\ncomplaints against public institutions has caused both the ombudsman's office and the courts to\nbe overburdened with petty, avoidable, and fruitless litigation.\n\nGender Imbalance. Underrepresentation of women in the judicial system as judges and\n42.\nlawyers  is  particularly  disturbing  at  a  time  when  the  number  of  women  accessing  the  courts,\nespecially in family disputes, is increasing.21\n\nHuman  Resources  in  the  Courts  and  the  Legal  Profession.  The  decline  in  both\n43.\nprofessional standards and in the quality of legal education has adversely effected the quality of\nthe judiciary. All eight major Law Commission reports since 1958 have strongly recommended\nstrengthening the quality of faculty, students, standards, curriculum, and facilities in law schools.\nHowever,  virtually  none  of  those  recommendations  were  implemented.  There  exists  no\ninstitution to promote dialogue about the role and responsibilities of the legal profession, nor to\nset,  monitor,  and  enforce  standards  in  legal  education.  The  Federal  Judicial  Academy  (FJA),\nwell equipped with excellent infrastructure and hostel facilities for trainees, was set up in 1988.\nHowever,  FJA  is  not  fully  operational,  as  most  of  the  positions  lie  vacant  or  are  filled  on  an\nacting basis only, and it has inadequate budget.\n\n                  \n\n1999, p. 65-66.\n\n20  The Asia Foundation. 1999: TA 3015-PAK: Legal and Judicial Reform Project, ADB, Integrated Report, September\n\n21 The sociolegal study under TA 3015-PAK shows that an increasing number of women are parties to suits filed in\nthe  courts.  The  difficulties  of  accessing  of  courts  by  women  underline  the  need  to  improve  the  capacity  of  the\nformal court system to deliver justice. Without such improved capacity, women are effectively disempowered.\n\n\f11\n\n44. With respect to the police, the major constraints and issues are given in paras. 45-50.\n\n45.\nPoliticization  of  the  Police.  The  police  has  been  politicized,  and  professionalism  has\nsuffered. There is an urgent need for a reorganization of the police that insulates it from political\ninterference.\n\n46.\nLack  of  Professional  Organization.  The  police  needs  to  be  reorganized  along\nprofessional lines. Currently the watch and ward,22 and the investigation functions of the police\nare  handled  by  the  same  officers,  with  the  result  that  the  former  takes  precedence  over  the\nlatter. This partly contributes to the very low conviction rates in Pakistan.\n\n47.\nLack  of  Modern  Technology.  The  technical  capacity  of  the  police  is  severely\nundermined by underinvestment in basic crime prevention and detection technologies, forensic\nlaboratories, and communications equipment.\n\n48.\nPoor Human Resources. Human resources below the officer level are particularly poor.\nThis is due partly to recruitment under political influence and partly to poor pre- and in-service\ntraining. Training pays inadequate attention to human rights and basic civil liberties guaranteed\nunder Pakistani law, while the current incentive and sanction system does not prevent violation\nof citizens\u2019 rights.\n\nLack of Accountability. There is no effective remedy against police high-handedness,\n49.\ngiven the delay in the courts and the expense involved for the ordinary citizen. Complaint and\nincentive mechanisms do not promote police accountability.\n\nPoor  Physical  Infrastructure.    As  in  the  case  of  the  judiciary,  physical  infrastructure,\n50.\nespecially  at  the  lower  level,  suffers  from  years  of  neglect.  The  inhuman  conditions  in  many\npolice  stations  and  the  barracks  for  the  constables  are  congruent  with  the  treatment  that  they\nmete out.\n\nC. \n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategy\n\n51.\nThe  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  governance  reforms  is  based  on  five  fundamentals:\ndevolution  of  political  power,  decentralization  of  administrative  authority,  deconcentration  of\nmanagement functions, diffusion of the power-authority nexus, and distribution of resources to\nthe district level. It aims to \u201censure that the genuine interests of the people are served and their\nrights  safeguarded\u201d  and  to  create  \u201can  enabling  environment  in  which  people  can  start\nparticipating in community welfare and be the masters of their own destiny.\u201d 23  To hold the local\nbureaucracy accountable, district ombudsmen will be appointed. Resolution of private disputes\nthrough  means  other  than  the  courts  will  be  encouraged  through  new  institutions,  Masalihat\nAnjuman  (MAs)  or  Conciliation  Committees  that  build  on  traditional  dispute  resolution\ninstitutions  such  as  the  panchayat. The  powerful  office  of  the  district  commissioner  has  been\nabolished so that there is no concentration of executive and judicial powers. Many of the powers\nexercised  by  these  officers  will  now  go  to  the  judiciary  and  other  line  departments,  while  the\nexecutive magistracy will be placed under the judiciary. Separate criminal and civil courts will be\nestablished  at  the  lowest  level,  and  the  capacity  of  the  subordinate  judiciary  to  deal  with  the\ncriminal work will be enhanced. These changes in the district police and administration have the\npotential to profoundly redefine and positively influence the relationship between the citizen and\nthe state.\n\n                  \n\n22  Watch  and  ward  refers  to  the  routine  functions  performed  by  the  police  to  maintain  law  and  order  and  prevent\n\ncrime, e.g. patrolling streets or controlling crowds.\n\n23  Local  Government  Plan  2000,  Government  of  Pakistan,  Chief  Executive  Secretariat,  National  Reconstruction\n\nBureau, 14 August 2000.\n\n\f12\n\nThe  Government  also  recognizes  the  need  to  make  the  formal  court  system  more\n52.\nresponsive to the needs of the citizenry, particularly to reduce chronic delays in courts. Actions\nby  the  Chief  Justices  Committee  and  the  Law  Commission  have  drastically  reduced  delays\nrelating  to  family  matters,  and  only  cases  filed  in  2000  are  now  pending  adjudication  in  the\nFamily  Courts.  Legislation  on  Small  Causes  Courts  will  be  introduced  to  allow  citizens  to  file\ncases at less expense using more informal procedures. Amendments to the Family Courts Act\nwill  also  expedite  disposal  of  litigation.  The  Government  is  also  committed  to  increasing  the\nrepresentation  of  women  in  the  judiciary,  and  for  this  purpose  the  Government  of  Punjab  has\ndecided to induct 100 women judges over the next three years, particularly for family courts.\n\n53.\nThe  decision  through  the  amended  Police  Act  of  1861  to  depoliticize  the  police  and\nreorganize  it  along  professional  and  functional  bases  has  immense  potential  for  providing\ngreater security to the citizenry and particularly the poor. Public safety commissions (PSCs) will\nprovide for more democratic control over the police and its insulation from political interference.\nThe new Police Ordinance will redefine the administrative structure of the police and provide a\nstatutory base for the establishment of national, provincial, and district PSCs.\n\n54.\nTo support improved citizen access to information affecting their rights and entitlements,\nthe  Government  is  committed  to  the  introduction  of  freedom  of  information  legislation,  which,\nuntil the present regional crisis, was intended to be enacted before the end of 2001. Consumer\nprotection legislation will be enacted and special tribunals introduced to enable citizens to hold\nthe  Government  and  its  officials  liable  for  torts.24  Changes  in  the  working  of  the  ombudsman\nrules  and  legislation  will  also  make  these  offices  more  independent  and  effective.  To  prevent\nenvironmental  damage  to  citizens\u2019  welfare,  the  Government  will  establish  environmental\ntribunals,  as  required  under  existing  legislation,  to  adjudicate  on  violations  of  environmental\nlaws and standards.\n\n55.\nTo support private sector development, the High Courts have decided to set up separate\nbenches to deal with commercial disputes, and the Government will introduce new legislation to\nbring Pakistani arbitration law up to international standards and to promote alternative dispute\nresolution (ADR). In this vein, the introduction of court-annexed ADR has the potential to reduce\ndelays in courts and to expedite dispute resolution.\n\nD. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n56.\nThe problem of governance in Pakistan has been well recognized by funding agencies.\nBut  there  has  been  a  remarkable  lack  of  coherent  and  coordinated  approaches.  Useful\ninterventions  are  now  under  way.  Human  rights  awareness  has  been  promoted  by  the\nNorwegian  Agency  for  International  Cooperation  and  Swedish  International  Development\nCooperation  Agency,  while  the  United  Kingdom  Department  for  International  Development\n(DFID) has supported assistance for police reform and has an ongoing project looking at issues\nrelating  to  domestic  violence.  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  has\nprovided assistance for local government reform and is actively supporting police-citizen liaison\nactivities  such  as  the  Karachi  citizen-police  liaison  committee  (CPLC).  The  World  Bank,  ADB,\nand  UNDP  have  also  initiated  work  on  civil  service  reform  but  no  significant  follow  on  has  yet\nemerged.  ADB  has  recently  approved  small-scale  TA  to  assist  the  Government  to  develop  a\nstrategy  for  restructuring  government  at  the  Federal  and  provincial  levels  in  light  of  the\ndevolution plan.25 Moreover, the US government has been engaged in training of police officers\nin  antiterrorist  and  antinarcotics  work.  Japanese  experts  have  visited  Pakistan  to  advise  on\n\n                  \n\nperson.\n\n24  Tort means a wrongful act (or omission) or breach of legal duty not founded on contract, that causes damage to a\n\n25  TA 3744-PAK: Supporting Government Restructuring and Reform, for US$150,000, approved on 18 October 2001.\n\n\f13\n\npolice reforms, while many Pakistani officials have visited Japan to study the police system. The\nJapanese  government  has  indicated  further  support  for  police  reform,  and  a  mission  to\ndetermine  the  scope  of  such  assistance  will  soon  visit  Pakistan.  The  Canadian  International\nDevelopment  Agency  (CIDA)  has  recently  approved  Can$12  million  for  the  Democratic\nGovernance  Program,  which  will  strengthen  local  government  institutions;  promote  citizen\nparticipation, particularly of women; and foster more accessible, client-oriented and accountable\npublic sector practices, particularly in the delivery of social services and justice. A portion of this\nmay  be  used  to  support  activities  under  the  AJP.  DFID  has  recently  approved  a  project  for\nSafety,  Security  and  Accessible  Justice,  which  will  support  a  study  and  provincial  seminars  to\nidentify key problems and explore priorities for reform with particular reference to criminal law.\nWith its emphasis on criminal law, the project has the potential to complement ADB\u2019s work on\nthe  legal  and  judicial  sector,  which  has  focused  on  civil  and  administrative  justice.  ADB  and\nDFID are coordinating their activities.\n\nADB's Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n\nE. \n \n57.\nImproved  local  governance  and  access  to  justice  are  central  features  of  the  ADB\ngovernance  support  strategy.  ADB  sponsored  a  series  of  studies  under  two  TAs26  that\nrecommended  a  phased  judicial  reform  agenda.  An  ongoing  TA  is  pilot  testing  some  of  these\nreform  proposals  and  is  building  the  capacity  for  reform.27  In  the  context  of  the  Government\u2019s\nLocal Government Plan, ADB is also assisting in the survey of existing legal needs at the local\ngovernment level and the capacity of various institutions in this respect.28 Work under these TA\nhas provided a solid foundation for ADB\u2019s assistance under the AJP.\n\n58.\nADB  is  currently  supporting  comprehensive  efforts  to  design  systems  for  fiscal\ndecentralization.  These  systems  include  better  linkage  among  annual  and  medium-term  plans\nand  budgets,  local  revenue  mobilization,  and  intergovernmental  fiscal  transfer  systems;  and\ngreater  involvement  of  citizens  in  monitoring  the  performance  of  district  and  lower  local\ngovernments  in  service  delivery.  This  work  and  ADB\u2019s  assistance  for  restructuring  of  Federal\nand provincial governments is likely to lead to substantial loan assistance from ADB. Such an\nintervention would be complementary to reforms supported under the AJP.\n\n59.\nThe  AJP  is  the  first  phase  of  ADB's  long-term  assistance  to  Pakistan  for  access  to\njustice  reform.  Legal,  judicial  and  police  reforms,  like  any  institutional  change,  are  inherently\ncomplex  and  require  time  to  change  institutional  culture,  incentives,  and  behavior.  In  this  first\nphase, the AJP aims to integrate access to justice issues into the larger development debate in\nthe country, set the policy and legal framework for sustainable judicial and police reforms, and\ninitiate  a  set  of  activities  to  address  some  of  the  most  pressing  issues  in  the  sector.  The  AJP\npurposefully  takes  a  comprehensive  approach  in  preference  to  a  parochial  supply-driven  one.\nThis  inherently  translates  into  a  more  complex  design  and  implementation  arrangements.  The\nexperience  of  other  countries,  however,  shows  that,  while  a  comprehensive  approach  is  not\nguaranteed  to  succeed,  piecemeal  efforts  are  likely  to  fail.29  While  comprehensive  in  its\napproach  to  judicial  and  police  reforms,  the  AJP  does  not  address  many  of  the  other  related\ninstitutions  or  areas  (e.g.,  prisons,  penal  policy  or  a  thorough  overhauling  of  the  criminal\nprocedure  code).  Some  bilateral  agencies  have  indicated  interest  in  pursuing  some  of  these\n\n                  \n\n26  TA  2979-PAK:  Strengthening  Government  Legal  Services  and  the  Subordinate  Judiciary,  for  US$150,000,\napproved on 31 December 1997, and TA 3015-PAK: Legal and Judicial Reform Project, for US$995,000, approved\non 7 May 1998.\n\n27  TA 3433-PAK: Strengthening of Institutional Capacity for Judicial and Legal Reform, for US$2,900,000, approved\n\n28  TA  3640-PAK: Supporting Access to Justice under the Local Government Plan  (US$150,000),  approved  on  19\n\non 27 April 2000.\n\nMarch 2001.\n\n29  Integrated Report by The Asia Foundation for TA 3015-PAK: Legal and Judicial Reform Project.\n\n\fother areas.

First,  given  the  fiscal  reality,  it  is  unavoidable  that  the\nGovernment may view program loan support as a quick disbursing form of budget support, and\nalso  as  an  opportunity  to  cover  the  adjustment  costs  of  fundamental  governance  reforms  to\nwhich  it  is  equally  committed.  Second,  the  current  fiscal  crisis  will  circumscribe  the\nGovernment's  scope  to  switch  and  increase  spending  on  pro-poor  reform  investments.  Third,\nthe  success  of  governance  reforms  is  much  affected  by  prior  social  circumstances.  It  is\napparent  that  patterns  of  adult  literacy  greatly  affect  the  capacity  of  the  poor  to  access  the\nopportunities  created  by \ninstitutions.  Fourth,  Pakistan's  geopolitical\ncircumstances have contributed to an unstable political system, with the army being in power for\nlonger than elected governments since independence.\n\nreformed  public \n\n2. \n\nJustice Reforms: Policy, Legality, Budget and Institutions\n\n61.\nThe  lessons  from  experience  with  conventional  justice  reform  is  it  they  must  extend\nbeyond the judicial domain. However well designed and run, judicial systems are unlikely to be\nwell used by the poor. Access to justice in private life, economic livelihoods, and public goods\nand  services  is  profoundly  affected  by  the  administration  and  police  as  well  as  the  judiciary.\nSecond, programs in support of reforms can provide short-term incentives for policy reform, but\nthey cannot supplant or precede prior domestic political commitments. Third, reform programs\nmust  assist  governments \nlong-term  budgetary\narrangements  that  provide  for  independence  of  the  judiciary  and  devolve  spending  powers  to\nthe  appropriate  administrative  level  of  authority.  Fourth,  reform  programs  must  work  with\ngovernments,  civil  society,  and  the  private  sector  to  define,  embed,  and  extend  institutional\narrangements to articulate policies/laws and enabling resources.\n\nthese  commitments \n\nto  articulate \n\ninto \n\n3. \n\nPolicy-Based Loan Instruments and Program Design\n\nThe success rate of policy-based loans has been far short of expectations.30 Evaluations\n62.\nshow  that  in  an  environment  of  complexity  and  uncertainty,  care  should  be  taken  against\nincluding  too  many  conditionalities,  excessive  details,  and  inflexibility.31  Conditionalities  are,  in\nother words, best seen as working hypotheses to focus a domestic dialogue within government,\nand  between  government  and  a  diverse  range  of  civil  society  and  private  agencies.32  For  this\nreason,  the  AJP  has,  from  ADB's  viewpoint,  adopted  a  unique  approach  to  tranche\nconditionalities  (paras.  111-113).  The  AJP  seeks  reform  outcomes  through  the  following\napproach. First, it will promote outcomes only where there is a prior policy commitment and will\nfocus  on  defining  legal  and  regulatory  arrangements  whereby  policies  can  be  given  durable\naffect.  Second,  where  this    has  been  secured,  the  AJP  will  support  the  establishment  of\ncorresponding institutional arrangements at the Federal, provincial, and local government levels.\n\n                  \n\n30 ADB  1996:  Review of the Bank's Program Lending Policies;  ADB  1999:  Review of ADB's Program Lending\nPolicies,  November;  Collier,  P.  2000:  For a New Relationship Between Donors and Recipients: The End of\nConditionality?

Vulnerability is understood as a function of insecurity of access\nto  key  sets  of  material,  social,  political,  and  environmental  assets,  which  expose  individuals,\nhouseholds and communities to increased or disproportionate risk of impoverishment. Justice is\nunderstood  as  a  function  of  the  relationship  between  institutions  responsible  for  delivering\nentitlements (public goods and services) predictably, affordably, and accountably and the ability\nof  the  poor  to  secure  and  sustain  their  access  to  key  sets  of  assets.  Efforts  to  limit  the\nvulnerability of the poor to the vagaries of systems of administrative, political, civil, and criminal\njustice  are  at  least  as  important  as  macroeconomic  performance  in  poverty  reduction.  Further\nthe  present  legal  framework  and  the  performance  of  the  judicial  institutions  responsible\nsignificantly  constrain  market-based  economic  growth  and,  in  particular,  hinder  foreign  direct\ninvestment as well as the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n64.\nReforms  in  the  administrative,  police  and  judicial  sectors  have  until  now  proven\nparticularly  difficult.  However,  the  present  context  for  the  AJP  is  conducive.  First,  the\nGovernment has already taken same very significant steps to demonstrate its commitment to all\nthe  policy,  legal  and  structural  reforms  listed  in  the  Policy  Matrix.  Second,  government\ncommitment to devolution and the creation of democratically elected local governments ensures\nthat the judicial and police reforms supported under the AJP are nested in a wider framework of\nprior Government commitment. Finally, government policy acknowledges that these reforms will\nrequire thorough-going changes in public sector budget planning and expenditure management,\nincluding  the  introduction  and  enforcement  of  systems  for  better  accountability  of  public\nservants and officials responsible for fiscal and human resource management.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nThe key development objective of the AJP will be to assist the Government in improving\n65.\naccess  to  justice  so  as  to  (i) provide  security  and  ensure  equal  protection  of  the  law    to  its\ncitizens,  in  particular  the  poor;  (ii) secure  and  sustain  entitlements  and  thereby  reduce  the\npoor's vulnerability; (iii) strengthen the legitimacy of state institutions; and (iv) create conditions\nconducive  to  pro-poor  growth,  especially  by  fostering  investor  confidence.  The  AJP  will\ncontribute to this aim by supporting five interrelated governance objectives: (i) providing a legal\nbasis for judicial, policy, and administrative reforms; (ii) improving the efficiency, timeliness, and\neffectiveness of judicial33 and police services; (iii) supporting greater equity and accessibility in\njustice  services  for  the  vulnerable  poor;  (iv)  improving  predictability  and  consistency  between\nfiscal  and  human  resource  allocation  and  the  mandates  of  reformed  judicial  and  police\ninstitutions  at  the  Federal,  provincial  and  local  government  levels;  and  (v)  ensuring  greater\ntransparency  and  accountability  in  the  performance  of  the  judiciary,  the  police,  and\nadministrative justice institutions.\n\n                  \n\n33  The  term  \u201cjudicial,\u201d  unless  the  context  indicates  otherwise,  includes  institutions  charged  with  delivery  of\n\nadministrative justice, such as the offices of the ombudsman at various levels.\n\n\f16\n\nThe Program scope will include three performance outcome domains: (i) policy and legal\n66.\nprovisions, (ii) institutional performance, and (iii) budget/expenditure management. The key and\nsupporting objectives of the AJP are outlined in the Program Framework Agreement (Appendix\n2).\n\nC. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\n1. \n\nKey Elements of the Policy Framework\n\nThe  key  development  objective  focuses  on  two  areas-\n\n67.\nadministrative  justice  institutions)  and  aspects  of  police  reforms-\ngovernment reforms. Each of these areas is outlined below.\n\njudicial  reforms  (including\nin  the  context  of  recent  local\n\na. \n\nJudicial Reforms\n\ni. \n\nImproving  Policy  Making  for  a  More  Efficient  and  Citizen-\nOriented Judicial and Legal Sector That Promotes Access to\nJustice\n\n68.\nTo  support  national  policymaking  for  the  administration  of  justice,  the  mandate  of  the\nLaw  Commission  will  be  expanded  to  include  the  administration  of  justice  and  its  composition\nexpanded to include chief justices, as ex-officio members, and adequate representation of other\nstakeholders. Among other things, the Law Commission (LC) will focus on issues relating to the\nadministration  of  justice,  such  as  (i)  the  working  of  the  civil  and  criminal  justice  systems;    (ii)\npenal  policy;  (iii)  initiatives,  including  research  on  existing  laws  and  regulations,  to  reduce  the\nvulnerability  of  the  poor;  (iv)  from  a  public  perspective,  issues  of  finance  and  administration\nrelating  to  the  justice  system,  to  support  adequate  funding  of  justice  institutions  and  their\nefficient working; and (v) a special purpose fund called the Access to Justice Development Fund\n(AJDF) (Appendix 3). The LC will be able to access the research and development fund of the\nAJDF.  In  addition,  to  promote  regular  review  and  coordination  of  judicial  policy,  a  national\njudicial  policymaking  body  will  also  be  formed  for  policies  within  the  exclusive  sphere  of  the\ncourts. This body will be formed in consultation with the chief justices of the superior courts so\nthe principle of independence of the judiciary is fully respected.\n\nii. \n\nStrengthening \nby  Complete\nSeparation of the Judiciary from the Executive and Ensuring\nThat Mandates of the Judiciary are Adequately Funded\n\nIndependence \n\nJudicial \n\nin \n\nfor \n\njudicial \n\nAlthough \n\nis  provided \n\nindependence \n\n69.\nthe  Constitution,  successive\ngovernments have undermined this constitutional principle. The Government has reaffirmed its\ncommitment to uphold judicial independence. The recent abolition of the powerful office of the\ndistrict commissioner and the distribution of its powers to the judiciary is of historic importance\nas  it  is  coupled  with  the  decision  to  place  all  executive  magistrates  under  the  control  of  the\njudiciary.  As  a  result,  the  judiciary  alone  will  try  crimes.  To  further  affirm  its  commitment  to\nseparation  of  the  executive  and  the  judiciary,  the  Government  will  review  the  functioning  of\ntribunals and special courts, particularly with respect to the principles of judicial independence\nand public interest in free and fair trial of cases and equal protection of law.\n\nTo  ensure  adequate  funding  for  the  judiciary  over  the  life  of  the  AJP,  a  medium-term\n70.\nbudget  and  expenditure  framework  will  be  developed  to  ensure  that  stability  and  predictability\nare  provided  with  respect  to  judicial  budgets  and  that  budgets  are  more  consistently  planned\nagainst  mandated  responsibilities  at  different  levels  of  the  judiciary.  The  AJDF  will  include  a\n\n\f17\n\nJudicial Development Fund (JDF), which will augment the subordinate courts, budget until the\ntime  that  adequate  budget  is  provided  (Appendix  3).  The  JDF  will  be  used  for  developmental\nactivities,  maintenance  of  court  automation  systems,  and  provision  of  public  facilities  for\nlitigants.\n\nIn the area of capital works, a national set of minimum standards for both buildings and\n71.\nequipment  will  be  prepared  within  the  confines  of  the  budget  and  implemented  countrywide.\nLegal  measures  will  also  be  taken  to  shift  responsibility,  and  the  concomitant  funding,  for  the\noperation  and  maintenance  of  judiciary  buildings  to  the  judiciary  itself  and  away  from  the\ncommunication and works departments.\n\niii. \n\nEnsuring Efficient and Inexpensive Justice\n\nTo  reduce  chronic  delays  in  courts,  judges,  in  cooperation  with  the  bar,  must  begin  to\n72.\napply  the  provisions  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code.  Amendments  will  also  be  made  to  the  Civil\nProcedure  Code  and  the  High  Court  rules.  The  delay  reduction  pilot  projects  under  TA  3433-\nPAK will be closely monitored and replicated. Bench books and trial practice manuals to guide\nsubordinate judges will be developed based on experience under TA 3433-PAK. The AJP will\nalso  support  the  Small  Causes  Courts  and  better  functioning  of  family  courts  to  keep  such\ndisputes  away  from  the  normal  civil  and  criminal  courts.  Pertinent  to  the  reform  of  the  civil\ncourts, the Arbitration Act of 1940 has been ineffective in providing litigants with the means for\nresolving claims outside of the courtroom. The law will be reviewed, and amendments made to\nmeet the original legislative intent by providing for wider ADR. Court-annexed ADR will also be\nimplemented  in  the  civil  courts,  providing  another  option  for  judges  to  manage  their  particular\ncaseloads.  Building  on  the  work  of  the  Law  Commission  in  the  drafting  of  the  Family  Courts\nOrdinance  of  2001,  amendments  to  the  Family  Courts  Act  will  be  enacted  to  speed  the\nresolution  of  family  cases.  The  local  level  MAs,  under  the  recently  promulgated  local\ngovernment laws, will also be established to build on the traditional ADR techniques indigenous\nto Pakistan.\n\n73.\nTo  provide  quick  relief  against  unlawful  imprisonment,  a  study  on  the  law  of  habeas\ncorpus will be initiated and recommendation implemented to increase access to justice in such\ncases. Currently only the high courts can grant relief against unlawful imprisonment by way of a\npetition  of  habeas  corpus.  High  courts  are  located  at  prominent  capitals  with  one  or  two\nbenches  in  other  large  cities.  Combined  with  the  costs  involved,  this  makes  it  very  difficult  for\nordinary citizens to access the high court.\n\nThe  AJP  will  also  support  improvements  in  the  delivery  of  administrative  justice.  The\n74.\ncurrent ombudsman system must be enhanced to provide for greater statutory independence for\nthe  officeholder  as  well  as  the  ability  to  conduct  thorough  investigations.  A  rule  under  the\nOmbudsman Order will be promulgated to reduce appellate delays and similar provisions such\nthat the office can be more effective in carrying out its statutory obligations. Statutory protection\nwill  be  enacted  for  officers  to  protect  them  in  the  course  of  their  investigations.  As  an\nadjudicator, the ombudsman will examine systemic problems through individual grievances and\nuse  these  to  make  recommendations  for  systemic  improvement.  The  AJP  will  support  the\nestablishment  of  district  ombudsman,  ensuring  resources  and  skills  for  both  their  dispute\nresolution and systemic reform responsibilities. The innovative work done by CPLC in Karachi to\nestablish a fully computerized information system will be examined.\n\nFinally, the feasibility of computerizing the justice system as a whole will be developed, a\n75.\npolicy announced for its implementation, and pilot systems instituted during the life of the AJP.\nThe linkage of courts to both the police force and the prison system through a comprehensive\ncomputerized system will serve as the main thrust of the policy.\n\n\f18\n\niv. \n\nLegal Empowerment of the Poor and Vulnerable\n\n76.\nThe vulnerability of the poor is significantly exacerbated by their weak literacy in law and\nthe  inability  to  enforce  the  law.  Courts  at  all  levels  will  establish  a  citizen  liaison  policy.  A\nfreedom of information (FOI) law will be passed, and the public will be informed of its meaning\nand  uses.  Publication  of  laws  efficiently  through  the  official  gazette  will  be  reviewed,  and  web\npublication  of  all  laws  will  be  achieved  during  the  AJP  period.  A  law  will  also  be  enacted  to\nensure that all regulations and circulars having the effect of law will be published in the official\ngazette. The Ministry of Law (MOL) and the Department of Law (DOLs) will be assisted in the\ntimely  publication  of  the  official  gazettes,  including  publication  on  the  web.  In  addition,  to\nenhance  the  public\u2019s  understanding  of  the  law,  simplified  explanations  of  all  new  laws  will  be\npublished  in  Urdu.  Over  the  AJP  period,  simplified  Urdu  explanations  of  major  enacted  laws\nsuch as the Civil and Criminal Procedure codes and the Penal Code will be published. The LC\nwill review legislation that is potentially harmful to the poor, women, and children, and actively\npromote its amendment or the introduction of new laws and ordinances.\n\nProtection of the underprivileged, and indeed of all of society, will be advanced through\n77.\nadditions  to  the  regulation  of  both  the  private  and  public  sectors.  Strong  consumer  protection\nlaws  will  be  enacted.  Effect  will  be  given  to  the  constitutional  provision  that  envisages  special\ntribunals to hold civil servants liable for torts committed by them. To hold civil servants and the\ngovernment responsible for their negligent behavior, the protection given to them under existing\nlaws will be reexamined. The unequal definition of \u201cgood faith\u201d for citizens and civil servants will\nbe immediately reviewed to put civil servants and the public on an equal footing, and a judicial\nor quasijudicial forum will be designated to hold public servants accountable. The contempt of\ncourt  and  defamation  laws  will  be  reviewed,  and  new  laws  will  be  enacted  to  strike  a  balance\nbetween public interest and freedom of expression. Finally, an institutionalized and multipurpose\nlegal empowerment fund (LEF) will be created, as an integral component of the AJDF, with its\nown  governance  structure  that  reflects  civil  society  representation  (Appendix  3).  The  LEF  will\nprovide  new  options  for  Pakistan\u2019s  most  vulnerable  citizens  and  will  allow  for  civil  society\ninitiatives  and  public-private  partnerships  to  empower  the  vulnerable  poor.  The  feasibility  of\nestablishing  a  public  defender  system  will  also  be  examined  to  provide  legal  support  to  the\nvulnerable poor.\n\nv. \n\nImproving Judicial Governance\n\n78.\nTo improve judicial governance, a system will be institutionalized for one or more judges\nin each high court (except Balochistan)34 to devote time, mainly for coordination of inspections,\nmonitoring  performance,  and  investigation  of  complaints  against  subordinate  courts.  Such  a\njudge, if not the chief justice, will be appointed by the chief justice and will be responsible to the\nchief  justice  for  such  functions.  Further,  the  high  courts  will  announce  and  institutionalize  a\npolicy for the filing of complaints against members of the subordinate judiciary. This will ensure\nthe accountability of a citizen-oriented judiciary within a framework of judicial independence.\n\n79.\nTo support increased transparency in the judiciary and case adjudication, annual judicial\nconferences  will  be  held  at  both  the  provincial  and  district  levels  to  promote  dialogue  among\njudges on problems faced by the courts and their possible solutions. Each high court will publish\nan annual report on the performance of the provincial judiciary. In addition, the Law Reports Act\nwill be amended to clarify and limit judicial discretion in the publication of judicial decisions such\nthat the public will be fully informed.\n\n34 Given the smaller number of the district courts and judges in the Balochistan High Court such allocation will not be\n\n                  \n\nfeasible or necessary.\n\n\f19\n\nCurrent  administrative  procedures  will  be  reviewed  together  with  the  management  and\n80.\ninformation  systems  to  generate  greater  efficiencies  through  automation  and  computerization.\nBy the end of the AJP period, new management and information systems will be introduced in\nthe high courts and substantially in all district and session courts.\n\nvi. \n\nImproving Human Resource Development\n\n81.\nTo  improve  the  quality  of  its  staff  (judicial  and  nonjudicial),  each  high  court  will\n(i) develop a medium-term plan for human resource development; (ii) review the efficiency of the\nclerical  and  support  staff  of  individual  courts;  (iii)  define  a  medium-term  plan  for  staff\ndevelopment; (iv) introduce a policy of standardized, transparent, and merit-based recruitment;\nand  (v)  define  performance  standards  for  judges  and  link  these  to  promotion.  Terms  and\nconditions of service of subordinate judges will also be reviewed by the Federal and provincial\ngovernments  To  increase  the  representation  of  women  in  the  legal  and  judicial  profession,  an\naffirmative  opportunities  program  will  be  developed,  including  review  of  service  rules,  training,\nand public information campaigns.\n\n82.\nThe skills and training of advocates is of great importance to the functioning of the legal\nsystem.  To  support  existing  law  schools,  a  Fund  for  Innovation  in  Legal  Education  will  be\nestablished under the AJDF (Appendix 3). The Government will also initiate a dialogue with the\nprivate  sector  and  existing  public  sector  institutions  to  establish  centers  of  excellence  in  legal\neducation and for this purpose enter into arrangements for establishment of at least one center\nof excellence in legal education that is technically and financially sustainable and has a positive\nregard for social equity.\n\nb. \n\nPolice Reforms\n\ni. \n\nEnsuring  an  Independent,  Accountable,  Transparent,  and\nProfessional Police Service Free of Political Interference\n\n83.\nUnder  the  extensive  police  reforms  proposed  by  the  Government,  the  police  will  be\ndepoliticized. Provisions to prevent political interference in the conduct of the police department\nwill be made through the enactment of a new statute governing the police. Among other things,\nthe legislation will provide for setting up of (i) PSCs at the Federal, provincial, and district levels\nto  ensure  civilian  control  and  to  institutionalize  police  accountability;  (ii)  police  complaints\nauthorities; and (iii) district criminal justice coordination committees.\n\n84.\nBeginning  with  the  command  structure,  PSCs  will  hold  the  apex  position,  holding\noversight powers. PSCs at the Federal, provincial, and district levels will approve the police plan\nand  set  performance  standards,  and  hold  the  police  chief  concerned  accountable  for\nperformance  and  maladministration.  The  establishment  and  operationalization  of  PSCs  will\npotentially  ensure  that  political  influence  is  eliminated.  In  addition,  the  current  dual  command\nstructure  will  be  abolished.  Functional  reorganization  of  the  police  will  also  be  supported  to\nensure a more professional police force.\n\nii. \n\nEstablishing an Independent Prosecution Service\n\n85.\nAn  independent  prosecution  service  will  be  institutionalized  under  the  provincial\ndepartments of law. Recruitment procedures will be based on merit and through an examination\nsystem. A law will be enacted such that prosecutorial misconduct will be a recognized offence,\nand  citizens  will  have  a  venue  to  file  complaints.  Also,  a  policy  of  professionalization  will  be\n\n\f20\n\nannounced  whereby  appointments  are  based  on  merit  and  continuing  legal  education  is\nprovided.\n\niii. \n\nCreating an Independent Police Complaints Authority\n\nCurrently  the  police  itself  investigate  complaints  against  police  misconduct.  This  has\n86.\nlead  to  a  lack  of  confidence  in  the  complaint  procedures  with  civil  society  representation.  The\nauthority and mandate of the proposed complaint authority need to be further strengthened to\nensure that it will be effective. In the initial phase, the PSCs will act as the complaints authorities\nand,  depending  on  the  need  for  full  time  bodies,  separate  independent  complaints  authorities\nwill be established.\n\niv. \n\nFostering Better Police-Citizen Relations\n\nTo \n\nimprove \n\n87.\nlow-key  police-citizen  relations,  a  policy  announcement  on  police\ncommitment  to  public  service  will  be  made,  backed  up  by  an  institutional  structure  and\nresources  to  make  the  announcement  a  reality.  CPLCs  and  citizen  community  boards,  as\nprovided for under the local government ordinances, will be established to monitor, among other\nthings, police performance.\n\nv. \n\nRaising Gender and Human Rights Awareness\n\n88.\nRecent  efforts  to  raise  the  awareness  of  police  about  human  rights  and  gender  issues\nwill be reinforced to become part of regular police and judicial training programs, together with\nchanges  in  the  sanction  and  incentives  system  that  promote  respect  for  human  and  gender\nrights. In addition, formal statements will be made by the Ministry of the Interior committing itself\nto a policy of human rights protection, gender sensitization, and public service.\n\nD. \n\nSocial and Environmental Issues\n\n1. \n\nSocial Issues\n\n89.\nThe AJP is a key part of nationwide efforts to positively influence the exercise of political,\nadministrative and judicial power so as to improve the accessibility of public entitlements for all\ncitizens, but in particular the poor, women and minorities. Although no adverse social impact is\nanticipated  (Poverty  Impact  Assessment  \u2013  Appendix  4),  the  AJP  will  actively  prompt  critical\npublic  and  professional  debate  about  important  social  issues  and  will  be  one  modest  part  of\nlarger efforts to transform the culture of governance in Pakistan.\n\n90.\nThe concentration of political and economic power has led the state to promote parochial\ninterests,  which  has  reduced  its  effectiveness  at  responding  to  the  needs  of  a  very  diverse\npopulation. Corruption, nepotism, and personalized decisionmaking have dominated the political\nscene;  and  accountability  processes  have  been  both  ineffectual  and  selective.  Elites,  acting\nthrough  the  executive,  have  contributed  to  the  dramatic  erosion  of  democratic  process  and\naccountability.  The  judiciary  has  too  often  been  called  upon  to  adjudicate  essentially  political\ndisputes. This has strained its independence and raised concerns regarding its politicization and\nlegitimacy.\n\n91.\nAlthough the AJP will act on a range of \u201csupply\u201d side constraints to the delivery of justice\nby  police  and  the  judiciary,  its  corresponding  focus  on  accountability,  sanctions  and\nperformance through legal empowerment will raise sensitive cultural, social, and political issues.\nAccording to this empowerment-oriented definition of access to justice, awareness and literacy\ninvolve  building  people\u2019s  appreciation  of  their  rights  and  the  law;  their  ability  to  act  on  legal\n\n\fknowledge or to assert their rights individually or collectively; and their capacity to mobilize for\nchange.  This  approach  will  focus  on  disadvantaged  populations  who  most  need  legal\nknowledge and ways to use it.\n\n21\n\n2. \n\nGender and Development\n\n92.\nThe AJP will aim to deal with critical gender disparities in access to justice. Women are\npresently  disempowered  by  an  array  of  prevailing  inequalities  that  severely  restrict  their  rights\nand  entitlements.  Laws  and  institutional  arrangements  that  reproduce  these  inequities  are\nimbedded.  The  Constitution  guarantees  equality  and  nondiscrimination.  But\ndeeply \ndiscriminatory \nlaws  (which  courts  are  not  willing  or  are  unlikely  to  strike  down  as\nunconstitutional) exist and there is evidence of different forms of violence against women, denial\nof equal access and opportunities, and minimal participation in decision-making processes. The\nAJP has a distinctive approach to these issues. The prime focus of the program is institutional,\nrather than substantive law reform. Thus, the AJP will tackle gender issues through the creation\nof  competent  legal,  judicial,  and  police  institutions  through  which  existing  basic/constitutional\nrights  can  be  implemented  fairly  and  accountably.  Through  the  LC  as  well  as  the  Women's\nCommission, the AJP will promote research and debate on the quality and equality of existing\nlaws,  and  through  this  help  build  constituencies  for  change  and  consensus  for  reform.  The\ninstitutional  focus  will  articulate  gender  interests  through  the  focus  on  the  quality  of  services\ndelivered  by  government  and  judicial  institutions  and,  on  the  \u201cdemand\u201d  side,  on  the\nempowerment focus noted in para. 90. Concrete steps will include the revision of service rules\nfor  judges  to  remove  gender  biases  and  to  facilitate  the  induction  of  more  women  judges;\noffering  of  special  courses  for  potential  women  judges;  and  training  courses  in  gender\nsensitization  for  the  judiciary  and  police,  coupled  with  service  rules  that  promote  gender\nsensitization. Civil society groups engaged in legal empowerment activities will be eligible to tap\nfunding  under  the  LEF.  Thus  through  a  combination  of  policy  changes,  capacity  building,  and\nsupport  for  civil  society  initiatives,  the  AJP  will  begin  to  address  serious  gender  issues  in  the\nlegal system.\n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental Issues\n\nlegislation;  appropriate  guidelines, \n\n93.\nThe AJP will have no direct environmental effects. In the context of the AJP, however,\nthe weak enforcement of environmental legislation is of great concern. Presently the poor, who\nare  most  vulnerable  to  a  worsening  environment,  cannot  voice  their  concerns  and  as  a  result\ncontinue to suffer the consequences of environmental mismanagement. Effective enforcement\nof \nfor  environmental\ninstitutional\nmanagement;  organization  and  empowerment  of  civil  society \naccountability;  and  adequate  resources  are  necessary  to  ensure  appropriate  environmental\nmanagement  and  prevent  continued  misery  of  the  poor.  Consistent  with  its  institutional  focus,\nthe  AJP  will  support  the  enforcement  of  environmental  laws  through  the  establishment  of\nenvironmental  tribunals  already  provided  for  in  the  law,  and  by  ensuring  that  any  conflict  of\ninterest is removed by different persons heading environmental protection agencies (EPAs) and\nthe provincial environment departments so that EPAs can effectively promote the public interest.\nIn  addition,  civil  society  groups  will  be  able  to  access  the  LEF  to  raise  awareness  about  and\nprovide assistance for enforcement of environmental rights.\n\nregulations,  and  procedures \n\nto  ensure \n\nE. \n\nCost of Adjustment of the AJP\n\nTo  enable  the  Government  to  provide  adequate  security  and  justice  to  its  citizens,  it\n94.\nshould  be  able  to  fully  fund  the  reasonable  costs  of  providing  these  essential  services.  The\npolice reform proposals have already demonstrated the need for this, while ADB-supported TA\nfor  the  judicial  sector  has  similarly  highlighted  the  need  for  increased  budgetary  allocations  to\n\n\f22\n\nthe  judiciary,  irrespective  of  efficiency  gains  expected  to  result  from  the  judicial  reforms.  The\nGovernment accepts the need for this adjustment, and, despite severe fiscal constraints, it has\nalready taken significant steps in this direction by increasing the budget for the police by PRs2\nbillion  in  FY2002,  while  all  of  the  provincial  governments  have  already  introduced  judicial\nallowances  for  all  members  of  the  subordinate  judiciary.  In  addition,  a  significant  amount  has\nalso been set aside in this year\u2019s budget to support local government reforms.\n\n95.\nOver  the  Program  period,  the  total  cost  of  adjustment  is  conservatively  estimated  at\nUS$406 million: about US$149 million for judicial reform,  US$237 million for police reform, and\nUS$25 million for the establishment of the AJDF. The bulk of the judicial reforms costs are for\nincreased  recurrent  budgetary  allocations  which  include  recruitment  of  new  judges  for\nsubordinate  courts,  rehabilitation  of  existing  court  facilities,  operating  costs  of  the  subordinate\ncourts,  and  training.  The  police  reform  cost  estimates  reflect  only  what  the  Government  has\nrecently  committed  to  increase  the  recurrent  and  development  budgets,  and  understate  the\ncosts actually needed for police reform. This commitment to increased budgetary allocation for\nthe  police  during  a  period  of  very  tight  fiscal  headroom  strongly  indicates  the  recognition  that\nthis  sector  has  been  grossly  underfunded  in  the  past  as  well  as  the  high  level  of  Government\ncommitment to commence real reform of the police.\n\n96.\nAt  a  time  of  severe  fiscal  constraints,  it  will  not  be  easy  for  the  Government  or  the\nprovincial  governments  to  incur  the  large  cost  of  these  reforms.  Consequently,  the  budgetary\nallocations to the judiciary and the police will suffer. To assist the Government to meet the cost\nof  adjustment,  fiscal  support,  through  the  proposed  policy  loan,  will  be  essential.  Regular  and\ncareful monitoring of budgets for the police and the judiciary against targets set in advance will\nbe essential to ensure that loan proceeds are used in support of reforms under the AJP.\n\nVI. \n\nTHE PROPOSED POLICY LOANS\n\nA. \n\nAmount of Loans and Sources of Funds\n\nTwo policy loans totaling US$330 million equivalent, comprising \u00a529,685,000,00035 from\n97.\nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  and  SDR67,914,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds\nresources will be used to support the Government\u2019s reform program for the AJP. The Borrower\nwill  be  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan.  The  Government  will  use  the  counterpart  funds  for\nincreased recurrent expenditures on the judiciary and police, increased capital expenditures for\nthe  judicial  and  police  sectors,  and  establishment  of  the  AJF.  The  loan  size  has  been\ndetermined  on  the  basis  of  the  immediate  financing  requirements,  costs  of  the  AJP  structural\nreforms,  strategic  significance  of  the  AJP  for  improved  governance,  and  the  current  financial\nposition  of  the  Government.  The  cost  of  the  AJP  is  estimated  at  US$406  million,  excluding\nexpenditures on local government reform.\n\nB. \n\nInterest, Maturity, and Utilization Period\n\n98.\nThe OCR loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an interest\nrate determined in accordance with ADB's London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR)-based lending\nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0 percent (the fee\nwill be capitalized in the loan), conversions options, and such other terms and conditions as are\nset forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The SFR loan will have a term of 24 years, including a\ngrace  period  of  8  years;  the  interest  charge  will  be  1.0  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace\n\n35 Equivalent to US$243.2 million at the exchange rate of \u00a5122.06 = US$1 as of 10 November 2001.\n\n                  \n\n\f23\n\nperiod  and  1.5  percent  per  annum  thereafter.  The  loans  will  be  utilized  within  a  period  of  four\nyears from the date of effectiveness.\n\nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\nAppendix  5  details  the  implementation  arrangements.  The  MOL  will  be  the  Executing\n99.\nAgency with a program management unit (PMU) headed by a full-time director/joint secretary, a\ndeputy secretary, and support staff. At the Federal level, the implementing agencies will be (i)\nLaw Commission, (ii) the Federal ombudsman, (iii) FJA, and (iv) the Ministry of the Interior. The\nprovincial  implementing  agencies  will  be  the  DOLs,  reporting  to  the  provincial  planning  and\ndevelopment  (P&D)  boards/departments,  which  will  coordinate  AJP  activities  within  the\nprovince. The Law Department will be responsible for activities concerning the high courts, the\nindependent  prosecution  services,  and  the  ombudsmen.  The  Home  Department  will  be\nresponsible for activities concerning the police and PSCs.\n\n100. A  National  Program  Review  and  Coordination  Committee  (NPRCC)  will  review  and\ncoordinate  overall  progress,  and  corresponding  Provincial  Program  Review  Committees\n(PPRCs) will operate at the provincial level. The chairperson of NPRCC will be the secretary of\nMOL.  NPRCC  will  comprise  one  representative  of  each  of  the  provincial  high  courts,  to  be\nnominated  by  their  respective  chief  justices;  the  secretaries  of  the  ministries  of  Law,  Finance,\nand  the  Interior;  the  director  general/secretary  of  the  National  Public  Safety  Commission;  the\nsecretaries of the provincial law departments; one representative nominated by the Pakistan Bar\nCouncil;  the  director  general  of  FJA:  one  representative  of  the  Law  Commission;  one\nrepresentative of the Federal ombudsman; and one representative of civil society nominated by\nthe  Federal  law  minister.  Each  PPRC  will  be  headed  by  the  chairperson  of  the  P&D  or  the\nadditional  chief  secretary  (development)  of  the  P&D.  A  PPRC  will  comprise  the  secretaries  of\ndepartments  of  Law,  Finance,  and  Home;  the  high  court  registrar;  the  provincial  inspector\ngeneral of police; the secretary of the provincial PSC; two representatives of subordinate courts\nto be nominated by the chief justice of the high court concerned; and one representative of civil\nsociety  appointed  by  the  governor.  NPRCC  and  the  PPRCs  will  be  assisted  by  the  outputs  of\nthe TA grant, which will focus on program monitoring and evaluation. Under the TA, civil society\nparticipation will be encouraged together with public surveys.\n\nD. \n\nProcurement and Disbursements\n\n101.\nThe proceeds of the policy loans will be utilized to finance the full foreign exchange costs\n(excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB  member\ncountries  (other  than  ineligible  items,  as  specified  in  the  loan  documents,  and  those  specified\nitems and imports financed by other multilateral and bilateral sources). The utilization period of\nthe loan will be 36 months commencing in December 2001 until December 2004. The Borrower\nwill  be  required  to  submit  with  each  withdrawal  request  a  certification  that  the  value  of  the\ncountry\u2019s  total  eligible  imports  is  equal  or  greater  than  the  amount  of  ADB\u2019s  projected\ndisbursements under the loan in a given period. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the\nproceeds of the loans and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification.\n\n102. Withdrawals will be allowed against eligible imports for which expenditures were incurred\nwithin 180 days prior to loan effectiveness. Retroactive financing is justified to ensure the timely\nrelease of counterpart funds to the Government, which has already incurred a significant part of\nthe structural adjustment cost.\n\n103. All  procurement  under  the  policy  loans  will  be  undertaken  through  normal  commercial\npractices  for  the  private  sector  or  the  Government\u2019s  prescribed  procurement  procedures\nacceptable to ADB, with due consideration given to economy and efficiency.\n\n\fE. \n\nCounterpart Funds\n\n24\n\n104. Counterpart  funds  generated  by  the  proceeds  of  the  policy  loans  will  accrue  to  the\nfederal budget and will be utilized to support increased budgetary allocations to specific sectors\naimed  at  achieving  the  objectives  of  the  AJP.  The  Federal  Government  will  on-lend  up  to  60\npercent of the counterpart funds to the provinces on the same terms and conditions as ADB\u2019s\nloans,  except  that  the  foreign  exchange  risk  will  be  borne  by  the  Federal  Government.  The\nFederal Government will use the counterpart funds to increase sector allocations to achieve the\nAJP objectives. In addition with setting up of new institutions such as the PSCs, an independent\nprosecution service, independent police complaint authorities, district ombudsmen, new courts,\nand  improved  forensic  capacity,  the  provincial  governments  will  take  on  additional  recurrent\nexpenditures and incur initial set up costs. Many other components of the AJP will also require\nthe  Government  to  increase  expenditure  on  access  to  justice,  for  example,  human  resource\ndevelopment  and  operationalizing  the  FOI  law.  The  counterpart  funds  will  also  be  used  to\ncapitalize  the  AJDF  (US$24  million)  and  provide  a  lump  sum  amount  of  US$1  million  for\nexpenditures.  If  the  dialogue  with  the  private  sector  and  existing  public  sector  institutions  is\nsuccessful, part of the counterpart funds (at least US$2 million equivalent) may also be used to\nfund arrangements for establishing of centers of legal education.\n\nF. \n\nTranching and  Monitoring\n\nin \n\nfour \n\ntranches.  The \n\nThe  proposed \n\nloans  will  be  released \n\ntranche  of\n105.\n\u00a57,714,192,000  (OCR)36  and  SDR28,793,000  (ADF)  will  be  released  upon  loan  effectiveness,\nbased  upon  fulfillment  of  all  first  tranche  conditions.  An  incentive  tranche  of  \u00a53,051,500,000\n(OCR)37 and SDR19,561,000 (ADF) will be released by 30 June 2002, and a second tranche of\n\u00a59,154,500,000  (OCR)38  and  SDR19,560,000  (ADF)  and  a  third  tranche  of  \u00a59,764,808,000\n(OCR)39 will be released by 30 June 2003 and 31 December 2004, respectively. The incentive,\nsecond and third tranches may be released earlier subject to fulfillment of the relevant tranche\nrelease  conditions  outlined  in  the  policy  matrix  (Appendix  1,  Attachment  1)  and  satisfactory\nconclusion  of  annual  performance  reviews,  conducted  just  prior  to  the  beginning  of  the  new\nfiscal year (Appendix 1, Attachment 2).\n\nfirst \n\n106.\nThe  tranche  release  conditions  stipulated  in  the  policy  matrix  articulate  essential\ninstitutional and budgetary dimensions of the policy, legal, and structural bases of the reforms\nsupported  under  the  AJP.  Accomplishment  of  these  essential  conditions  will  not,  however,  be\nenough. A host of complementary actions will be required to create an enabling environment to\nboth  establish  and  progressively  evaluate  the  policy  assumptions  underpinning  the  reforms.\nto\nThese  actions,  varying \nexperimenting  with  delay  reduction  techniques,  including  ADR,  will  both  facilitate  and  support\nthe momentum for reform. By engaging stakeholders (within state agencies and civil society) in\nthe reform process and demonstrating to the public that a positive difference can be made in the\ndelivery  of  justice  through  improved  procedures,  greater  transparency,  automation,  etc.,  these\ncomplementary activities will instill confidence in the reform process.\n\nlegal  empowerment  activities \n\nfrom  capacity  building  and \n\n107.\nIt  is  neither  possible  nor  wise  to  chart  a  blueprint  of  such  activities  over  the  Program\nperiod,  as  no  amount  of  analysis  can  fully  anticipate  the  reform  process,  the  unintended\nconsequences  of  reform  activities,  and  the  interaction  between  AJP  reforms  and  many  others\nunder  way.  The  challenges  of  incentives,  institutions,  and  environment  often  require  that\nchoices  be  made  among  \u201cimperfect  alternatives\u201d  that  account  for  local  conditions.  The  AJP\n\n                  \n\n36 Equivalent to US$63.2 million.\n37 Equivalent to US$25.0 million.\n38 Equivalent to US$75.0 million.\n39 Equivalent to US$80.0 million.\n\n\f25\n\ndesign,  while  establishing  essential  principles  and  institutional  lynchpins,  must  also  allow\nsufficient  flexibility  for  experimentation  and  fine-tuning  of  institutional  arrangements  and\nincentives that are suited to local conditions.\n\n108.\nThe  performance  review  process  (Appendix  1,  Attachment  2)  will  build  on  and  provide\nadded  incentive  for  existing  procedures  for  monitoring  and  compliance  verification  within  the\nGovernment,  which  requires  periodic  progress  reporting  and  annual  audit  procedures.  The\nannual  performance  review  process  will  assess  (i)  compliance  with  second  (and  subsequent)\ntranche  conditions,  (ii)  progress  towards  compliance  with  subsequent  tranche  conditions,  and\n(iii) progress on complementary activities agreed upon between the Government (including the\njudiciary  and  the  police)  and  ADB.  The  review  will  occur  each  year  through  a  participatory\nprocess  beginning  at  the  district  level  (Appendix  5,  Figure  3)  during  May-June  each  year  as\nmutually agreed between the Government and ADB, just prior to the new fiscal year, to enable\nFederal, provincial and district authorities, with input by civil society, to reflect the results, where\nappropriate, in their statutory planning and budgeting process. A satisfactory conclusion to the\nannual performance review process (i.e., not necessarily full compliance) on the complementary\nactivities will be a condition for release of the second and third tranches. An additional condition\nfor release of the second tranche will be agreement on complementary activities to be carried\nout prior to release of the third tranche as part of the performance review. Performance review\nmilestones  will,  therefore,  provide  an  opportunity  to  review,  modify,  or  add  complementary\nactivities to support the AJP.\n\n109.\nThrough  the  TA  grant,  ADB  will  help  the  PMU  to  establish  monitoring  procedures  to\nmeet three purposes: (i) monitor the progress of the implementation of the reforms; (ii) ensure\nindependent  audit  procedures;  and  (iii) provide  strategic  information,  based  on  lessons  from\nexperience,  to  manage  the  reforms.  The  first  two  purposes  will,  among  other  things,  be\nachieved  by  reinforcing  existing  government  procedures  at  the  federal  and  provincial  levels.\nGovernment capacity in respect of the third purpose is less developed. Monitoring will focus on\nthree aspects of the reform:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nBudgetary  Commitments  and  Expenditure  Performance.  ADB  will  seek\nassurance  that  the  Government  honor  its  commitment  (a)  to  progressively\nincrease budget allocations, (b) to ensure greater consistency between budgets\napproved  and  actual  transfers  through  expenditure,  and  (c)  that  nonsalary\nrecurrent  budgets  approved  at  the  provincial  level  for  the  judicial  sector\nallocations are at least 12 percent of the total expenditure.\n\nImplementation  of  Institutional  Arrangements.  These  should  be  provided  for\nunder  the  court,  local  government,  and  police  ordinances  and  amendments  to\nexisting laws (e.g., ombudsman).\n\nPerformance  of  the  Access  to  Justice  Development  Fund.  This  will  include\nthe  subsidiary  Judicial  Development  Fund  (JDF),  Legal  Empowerment  Fund\n(LEF), and the Fund for Innovations in Legal Education (FILE); the research and\ndevelopment  fund;  and  the  FJA  Fund,  especially  with  respect  to  (a)  the\nconsistency  between  the  objectives  of  the  respective  funds  and  actual  practice,\n(b) \nfund  governing  structures,  and\n(c) accounting  and  auditing  of  fund  utilization.  These  reviews  will  assist  Law\nCommission to reexamine the AJDF and its working, and to make modifications\nas necessary.\n\nthe  performance  of \n\nthe  respective \n\n110. MOL, in cooperation with the Implementing Agencies and TA grant and loan consultants,\nand ADB will conduct evaluations by an independent authority jointly appointed by ADB and the\nGovernment  at  the  end  of  year  3  of  AJP  implementation.  The  Government  will  keep  ADB\n\n\f26\n\ninformed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral aid agencies\nthat have implications for implementation of the AJP, and will provide ADB with an opportunity\nto comment on any resulting policy discussions.\n\n111. MOL (in coordination with the Implementing Agencies) will submit a program completion\nreport  to  ADB  three  months  after  the  loan  closing  date.  The  report  will  evaluate  the\nimplementation  of  the  policy  measures  under  the  AJP,  assess  their  impact,  describe  lessons\nlearned  during  implementation,  and  outline  further  actions  required  for  improving  access  to\njustice.  To  supplement  monitoring  by  the  Pakistan  Resident  Mission,  ADB  will  regularly  field\nmissions  to  ensure  smooth  implementation  under  the  policy  and  TA  loans  and  to  discuss\nprogress with MOL and the Implementing Agencies.\n\n112.\nThe Government will be able to withdraw funds in three tranches from the loan account\nduring a three-year period starting from loan effectiveness. In addition, there will be an incentive\ntranche,  which  can  be  disbursed  before  the  second  tranche.  The  first  tranche  will  become\navailable after loan effectiveness following up-front compliance with the conditions specified in\nthe  Policy  Matrix  (Appendix  1,  Attachment  1)  and  after  loan  effectiveness.  The    incentive\ntranche  is  expected  to  be  released  by  30  June  2002,  on  compliance  with  the  following\nconditions and satisfactory progress with the TA loan:\n\n1.\n\nJudicial Reforms\n\n(a) \n\nIntroduce  amendments  to  the  Law  Commission  Ordinance  of  1984  to  improve\nthe administration of justice.\n\n(b) \n\nFormalize a national judicial policymaking body acceptable to the chief justices.\n\nEstablish  the  AJDF  with  an  endowment  of  US$24  million  to  be  paid  in  two\ntranches  of  US$12  million  each  during  July  in  FY2003  and  July  FY2004.  In\naddition, US$1 million will be released during July 2002 for the purposes of the\nAJDF,  and  until  then  nothing  will  be  spent  from  the  AJDF.  Finalize  the  rules  of\nthe AJDF by July 2002.\n\nReach  agreement  among  the  provinces  and  high  courts  on  increments  of\nadditional budget allocations in real terms by province to the judiciary over a five-\nyear period.\n\n(e) \n\nEnact and bring into force an ordinance to establish small causes courts.\n\nEnact amendments to the Family Courts Act to speed up resolution of all family\ndisputes.\n\nBased  on  recommendations  of  the  habeas  corpus  study,  enact  legislative\nchanges as necessary.\n\nFinalize  and  approve  (by  each  high  court)  a  program  for  delay  reduction  and\ncommence  implementation  during  FY2003.

Work will also be necessary to design a participatory process for further legal and\npolicy reforms based on lessons learned during the Program period.\n\nA. \n\nRationale and Objective\n\n116.\nTo be effective, the AJP management arrangements must be attuned to two realities of\npolicy  reforms:  first,  that  policy  decisions  are  necessarily  taken  with  incomplete  knowledge  of\n\n\f30\n\nexisting  circumstances  and  their  interrelationships;  and  second,  that  policy  interventions  will\nhave unintended consequences. The TA Loan will allow initiatives to be designed and instituted\nto respond to new needs. A TA cluster loan is ideally suited to this requirement: it allows for a\nphased  approach  to  supporting  the  concomitant  institutional  and  organizational  changes\nnecessary for implementing the AJP reforms.\n\nB. \n\nScope\n\n117.\nThe TA Loan will be organized around five themes necessary to articulate the policy and\nlegal  framework  for  justice  reforms  that  will  have  been  created  prior  to  commencement  of  the\nAJP. Appendix 6 provides details on the rationale, scope, and activities to be supported under\nthe TA Loan.  These themes, and examples of actions to be pursued in the first phase are as\nfollows:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nGovernance structures, Systems, and Capacities to Articulate Policy/Laws. This\ntheme  will  include  five  sub-sets  of  activities:  (a)  setting  up  organizations\nmandated  under  new  laws,  (b) direct  institution  strengthening,  (c) defining\n(e) installation  of\nprocedures, \nfacilities/equipment.\n\n(d)  enhancing  human \n\nresources,  and \n\nPublic  Knowledge  and  Legal  Empowerment.  This  will  support  (a)  campaigns  in\nsupport of public awareness (e.g., on provisions of the Consumer Law and FOI\nLaw, liability of public servants for torts, etc), and (b) awareness raising with civil\nsociety  organizations  (e.g.,  bar  associations)  of  opportunities  under  special\npurpose funds (e.g., the LEF).\n\nPerformance  and  Accountability.  This  will  include  (a)  establishing  the  baseline\nand  institutional  arrangements  for  monitoring  changes  in  efficiency  and  the\neffectiveness of the performance of courts and police agencies, and (b) clarifying\nand ensuring that durable arrangements are made to ensure accountability (e.g.,\nsecuring  the  auditor  general's  sanction  for  audit  arrangements;  formats  and\nschedules for annual reporting, and publicity events).\n\nPolicy  Impact  and  Innovations.  This  will  include  (a)  defining  arrangements  to\nensure  that  the  lessons  of  implementation  of  the  reforms  are  incorporated  into\nrevisions  and  refinements  in  policy  and  laws  for  justice  reform,  and  (b)  defining\nprocedures  for  allocation  of  resources  to  innovative  approaches  (e.g.,  for  legal\neducation, public-private partnerships, etc.).\n\nSupporting Further Legal and Policy Reform.  This will include (a) drafting of new\ncontempt  and  defamation  laws;  (b)  a  legal  and  policy  framework  for  a  revised\ncomprehensive  administrative  grievance  procedure  and  (c)  legal  policy  reform\nwork in other areas identified during implementation.\n\n118.\nThe  TA  Loan  will  be  implemented  in  phases.  The  scope  of  the  first  phase  (i.e.,\nDecember 2001 to June 2003) will be finalized during the inception mission for the AJP, and will\nend at about the same time as the expected date of the second tranche release. Not later than\nthe  penultimate  month  of  phase  1,  the  Government  and  ADB  will,  as  part  of  the  second\nperformance review of the AJP, also review progress in implementing the terms of reference for\nthe purpose of refining and developing terms of reference for phase 2, which will continue from\nmonth 19 to month 36 of the TA Loan. Thereafter, not later than the penultimate month of phase\n2,  the  parties  will  repeat  this  process  based  on  the  third  performance  review  and  develop  the\nterms of reference for the third and final phase. The first and third performance reviews will also\n\n\f31\n\nreview progress in implementation of the TA Loan. The activities specified for the first phase in\nAppendix 6 will be commenced but not necessarily completed by the consultants during phase\n1.\n\nC. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\n119.\nThe detailed cost estimates and financing plan are set out in Appendix 6. The total cost\nof  the  TA  Loan  is  estimated  to  be  US$25.5  million  equivalent,  comprising  foreign  exchange\ncosts  of  US$12.0  million  and  US$13.5  million  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  finance\nUS$8.0 million in foreign exchange costs and US$12.0 million equivalent in local currency. The\nBorrower  will  finance  US$4.0  million  in  foreign  exchange  for  equipment  and  US$1.5  million\nequivalent in local currency in the form of counterpart staff, offices, etc. A loan of US$20 million\nequivalent is proposed from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with a term of 32 years, including a\ngrace  period  of  8  years,  and  an  interest  charge  of  1.0  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace\nperiod  and  1.5  percent  per  annum  thereafter.  ADB  is  actively  seeking  cofinancing  from  a\nnumber  of  agencies  who  have  expressed  strong  interests  in  the  reforms  under  the  AJP.  This\nmay result in lowering the amount of the TA Loan.\n\nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n120. Detailed implementation arrangements are set out in Appendix 5. The Executing Agency\nwill  be  the  MOL,  acting  through  the  PMU,  and  it  will  be  supported  by  Federal  and  provincial\nimplementing agencies as set out in Appendix 5. As the TA Loan is an integral part of the AJP,\nits  implementation  is  closely  aligned  with  the  Executing  and  Implementing  Agencies  for  the\nProgram Loan. All procurement under the TA Loan will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\non Procurement. The selection, engagement, and services of consultants will be in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB\nfor the engagement of domestic consultants.\n\nVIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANT\n\n121.\nTo support the AJP and assist in its effective monitoring and evaluation, the Government\nhas  requested  TA  for  Supporting  and  Monitoring  Progress  under  the  AJP.  Given  the  unique\nfeatures  of  the  AJP,  its  successful  launching  and  its  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  provide\nvaluable insights for modification during the implementation and design of future initiatives. ADB\nwill finance US$900,000 on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program  to support the PMU\nimplementation\nand  an \narrangements,  outline  terms  of  reference,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  are  outlined  in\nAppendix 7.\n\nindependent  monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  The  scope, \n\nIX. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\n\nA. \n\nBenefits\n\n122.\nThe  AJP  will  deliver  benefits  in  three  domains.  Actions  in  the  first  domain,  policy  and\nlegal  provisions  will  secure  (i) greater  judicial  independence,  transparency,  and  accountability;\n(ii) better citizen-state relations; and (iii) more durable public institutions responsible for delivery\nof  justice.  Actions  in  the  domain  of  institutional  performance  will  result  in  (i)  greater  judicial\nindependence,  fostering  predictable,  timely  and  impartial  rule  of  law  conducive  to  investor\nconfidence;  (ii)  a  dramatic  decline  in  political  interference  in  police  services;  (iii)  enhanced\ninstitutional arrangements for holding public servants and officials accountable for violations of\n\n\f32\n\ncitizens rights and entitlements; and (iv) greater public engagement in planning and monitoring\nthird  domain,\nperformance  of \nbudget/expenditure  management,  will  result  in  greater  consistency  between  allocations  of\nhuman and fiscal resources and institutional responsibilities for delivery of justice at the Federal,\nprovincial and local government levels.\n\njudicial  and  police  service  delivery.  Actions \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n123.\nThe  AJP  focuses  on  the  most  basic  of  \u201cpublic  goods\u201d  (law  and  order,  and  justice)\nessential for orderly life and sound economic development. It will contribute to the Government's\nefforts to transform the performance of the judiciary and the police such that the citizenry will no\nlonger regard these institutions as irrelevant, nor will they continue to be a significant factor in\nthe  vulnerability  of  the  poor.  While  the  benefits  of  improved  rule  of  law  are  indispensable  to\nimproved  economic  performance,  the  AJP  will  decrease  the  vulnerability  of  the  poor  in\nsubstantial  ways  including  (i)  alleviating  vulnerability  arising  from  the  everyday  harassment,\nunderperformance,  exclusion,  and  denial  of  basic  rights  by  public  officials;  (ii)  easing  the\nvulnerability  of  informal  sector  activities  to  rent-seeking  activities  of  officials  responsible  for\nlicensing and regulating people's access to economic and environmental assets; (iii) improving\nthe  accountability  of  public  officials,  and  improving  the  accessibility  and  affordability  of  public\ngoods and services, on which the poor rely disproportionately.\n\n124. On the demand side, AJP strategy is that, unless major efforts are made to conscientize\nand mobilize the poor, women, and other disadvantaged sections of the population, the reforms\nrisk  political  capture  and  disablement.  The  AJP  will  exploit  opportunities  for  greater  public\naccess that are already prefigured in government commitments. It will result in local language\npublication  of  key  legislation;  promote  efforts  to  improve  public  awareness  of  the  roles  and\nresponsibilities  of  lower  level  judiciary,  police,  and  administration;  and  foster  more  active\ninvolvement  of  citizens  in  judging  the  performance  of  these  organs  and  special  purpose\nfacilities, such as afforded by the LEF, to facilitate public engagement in seeking greater access\nto justice.\n\nB. \n\nRisks\n\n125.\nThe  risks  facing  the  reform  process  are  formidable.  Despite  the  unprecedented\nopportunities  presented  by  the  Government's  commitments  to  the  reforms  under  the  AJP,  the\nhistorical  legacy  of  numerous  failed  attempts  to  affect  lasting  changes  in  the  judiciary,  police,\nand  administration  cannot  be  ignored.  Resistance,  foot  dragging,  and  noncompliance  with  the\nspirit and letter of the reform process are likely, unless the structure of incentives and sanctions\non  public  performance  are  introduced.  Three  factors  present  particular  risks  to  the  reform\nprocess, each of which is only marginally within the capacity of the AJP to mitigate: (i) the fiscal\ncrisis will make it extremely difficult for the Government to adequately and predictably resource\nthe  reforms  over  the  next  decade;  (ii)  implementing  government  commitments  to  reform  will\nlocal\ndepend  on  corresponding  constituencies  being  created  among  provinces  and \ngovernments, and on facilitation of broad coalitions and alliances with civil society; and (iii) the\nwindow  of  opportunity  for  reforms,  through  to  October  2002,  is  vulnerable  to  uncertainty,  both\nwithin  Pakistan  and  the  region.  While  the  AJP  design,  in  particular  the  TA  Loan,  will  assist  in\nameliorating  risks  relating  to  (ii)  above,  the  other  risks  are  beyond  the  capacity  of  the  AJP  to\nmitigate.  Furthermore,  the  heightened  sense  of  instability  and  uncertainty  created  by  present\nregional crisis will undoubtedly impact on the law, order, and security situation within Pakistan,\nwhich it is the purpose of this program to improve.\n\n\f33\n\nX. \n\nASSURANCES\n\n126. Other  than  the  tranche  release  conditions  stated  earlier  and  the  standard  assurances,\nthe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  which  will  be  incorporated  in  the  legal\ndocuments:\n\n(i)\n\nFor the Program Loans:\n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nThe Government will ensure that the policies adopted and actions taken\nas described in the Policy Letter, including the Policy Matrix, prior to the\ndate of the Program Loan Agreement continue in effect for the duration of\nthe AJP period, and subsequently.\n\nThe  following  will  be  conditions  for  loan  effectiveness:  that  the  PMU  will\nhave  been  established  and  staffed  to  the  satisfaction  of  ADB,  and  the\nfaculty of FJA augmented as agreed upon with ADB.\n\nThe provincial governments will be entitled to borrow at least 60 percent\nof the counterpart funds from the Federal Government on the same terms\nand conditions as the ADB loans to the Federal Government, except that\nthe foreign exchange cost will be borne by the Federal Government, i.e.,\nthe Federal Government will not pass on the foreign exchange risk to the\nprovincial governments.\n\nThe Government will promptly adopt the other policies and take the other\nactions  specified  in  the  Policy  Letter,  including  the  Policy  Matrix,  and\nensure  that  such  policies  and  actions  continue  in  effect  during  the  AJP\nperiod and subsequently.\n\n(e)\n\nThe Government will implement the TA loan and grant in a timely fashion.\n\n(a) \n\nThe following will be a condition for loan effectiveness: that the PMU will\nhave been established and staffed to the satisfaction of ADB.\n\n(b)  Within  three  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  NPRCC  and  each  PPRC  will\n\nhave been established and staffed to the satisfaction of ADB.\n\n(c)  Within three months of loan effectiveness, TA supervision committees will\nbe  established  and  staffed  in  MOL  and  the  Ministry  of  Interior  to  the\nsatisfaction of ADB.\n\n(d)  Within  three  months  of  loan  effectiveness  and  upon  completion  of  the\nreview of the scope of phase 1 of the TA Loan, satisfactory to ADB, the\nPMU will initiate the hiring of consultants.\n\n(e) \n\nThe Government will implement the TA Loan in consonance with AJP.\n\n(f) \n\nNo proceeds of the TA Loan will be withdrawn or used from the imprest\naccount  (i)  for  expenditures  other  than  phase  1  after  June  2003  unless\nand until that year\u2019s AJP annual performance review has been completed\nand phase 2 of the TA Loan has been developed, or (ii) for expenditures\n\n(ii)\n\nFor the TA Loan:\n\n\f34\n\nother than phase 1 or 2 after December 2004 unless and until that year\u2019s\nAJP annual performance review has been completed and phase 3 of the\nTA Loan has been developed, in each case to the satisfaction of ADB.\n\n127.\nIn  addition,  the  loan  documents  will  include  a  covenant  that  ADB  will  have  the  right  to\nsuspend  the  Program  Loan  in  case  there  is  inadequate  progress  in  the  implementation  of  the\nTA Loan or vice versa.\n\nXI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\n\n128.\nADB and recommend that the Board approve:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\na loan of \u00a529,685,000,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Access to\nJustice  Program  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be\ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based loan facility, an amortization\nperiod of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years, and such other terms and\nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft\nLoan Agreement presented to the Board;\n\na loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 67,914,000  to\nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Access to Justice Program with a term of\n24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest charge at the rate of 1.0\nper cent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 per cent thereafter, and such\nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth\nin the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board;

As  part  of  its  strategy  to  address\ngovernance  issues  in  Pakistan,  the  Government  has  launched  an  anticorruption  drive  and\nstarted  implementation  of  a  devolution  plan  that  will  enhance  accountability  of  public  officials\nand  establish  more  democratic  and  equitable  society.  Local  government  elections  have  been\nsuccessfully  completed  and  local  government  structures  are  being  established  in  accordance\nwith  the  Local  Government  Ordinance  recently  enacted  by  each  province.  With  devolution,\ncitizens will have more democratic control over delivery of public services at the local level and\nthe new government structures will be more transparent and accountable to them.\n\nCentral  to  good  governance  in  Pakistan  is  strengthening  the  rule  of  law  and  ensuring\naccess to justice, particularly by the vulnerable poor. The Government acknowledges that this\nrequires  a  number  of  concrete  steps  that  create  a  policy  and  legal  framework  for  an\nindependent and functional judiciary, a professional police force that serves the rule of law, and\na  system  of  administrative  justice  that  can  effectively  and  efficiently  deal  with  citizens\u2019\ngrievances. The Government also needs to work with civil society to empower people to enforce\ntheir  legal  rights  and  develop  public-private  partnerships  for  this  purpose  as  well  as  to  raise\nstandards  of  an  independent  legal  profession.  Persistent  inadequate  budgetary  allocations  for\nthe police and the judiciary have contributed to a weakening rule of law in Pakistan. Any serious\nreform effort must, therefore, ensure adequate budgetary allocations and make up for the years\nof neglect through greater attention to human resource development and investment in physical\ninfrastructure. Only a comprehensive reform package that seeks to address issues of legal and\npolicy  framework,  institutional  capacity  and  incentives,  and  sustainable  financing  based  on\nefficient  use  of  resources  can  initiate  a  process  to  strengthen  the  rule  of  law  in  Pakistan.  The\nGovernment  has  accordingly  formulated  a  comprehensive  Access  to  Justice  Program  (AJP)\nwith  the  assistance  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  carry  out  systemic  judicial  and\npolice reforms to strengthen the rule of law to the advantage of ordinary citizens, especially the\npoor. The following key issues and areas will be addressed under AJP through lynch-pin policy\nreforms as detailed in the policy matrix (Attachment 1). In addition, a number of milestones and\ncomplementary  actions  will  be  taken  as  outlined  in  the  performance  review  (Attachment  2)  to\nsupport  the  lynch-pin  policy  initiatives  in  the  policy  matrix.  During  each  performance  review,\nprogress  in  achieving  the  policy  initiatives  will  be  monitored,  and  the  milestones  and\ncomplementary actions will be carefully calibrated to respond to a dynamic reform process.\n\nThe Government affirms the constitutional provisions relating to the independence of the\njudiciary. Accordingly, the Government has taken a historical decision to fulfill the constitutional\nmandate  of  separating  the  judiciary  from  the  executive  by  placing  all  executive  magistrates\nunder the control and supervision of the judiciary. The Government also recognizes that in the\npast inadequate attention has been given to administration of justice and judicial policymaking.\nAccordingly,  the  mandate  of  the  Law  Commission  will  be  expanded  together  with  its\ncomposition to include the chief justices of the High Courts as ex-officio members. The reformed\n\n\f37\n\nAppendix 1, page 2\n\nLaw  Commission  will  be  provided  adequate  financial  and  human  resources  to  carry  out  its\nmandate.  In  addition,  a  national  judicial  policymaking  body  will  also  be  established  that  is\nacceptable to the Chief  Justices of  the superior courts. The Government is aware that judicial\nindependence has in the past been undermined by, among other things, inadequate budgetary\nallocations. Recurrent non-salary budgets for the judiciary have declined in almost all provinces\nwhile  the  physical  infrastructure  for  the  subordinate  courts  has  deteriorated.  Accordingly,  the\nFederal  and  provincial  governments  are  committed  to  augmenting  budgetary  allocations  to\nmake  the  judiciary  an  effective  institution  and  to  ensuring  adequate  budgetary  allocations\nthrough  the  development  of  a  medium-term  budget/expenditure  framework  for  the  judiciary.\nSalary and terms and conditions of the subordinate judiciary will also be reviewed. To ensure a\nmodicum  of  financial  stability  in  key  institutions,  the  Government  has  decided  to  establish  the\nAccess  to  Justice  Development  Fund  (AJDF)  that  will,  among  other  things,  support  the\nsubordinate courts, the Law Commission, and the Federal Judicial Academy. The Government\nalso affirms its commitment to filling all judicial posts in a timely manner within 120 days of any\nvacancy.\n\nThe slow pace of litigation in courts together with the high costs of litigation undermine\npublic confidence in the judicial system. Provision of justice in an expeditious manner and with\nas least cost as possible is, therefore, a primary concern of the Government. Accordingly, the\nGovernment  will  pass  legislation  to  establish  small  causes  courts  for  resolution  of  minor\ndisputes  through  summary  procedure,  together  with  amendments  to  the  Family  Courts  Act  to\nensure speedier resolution of all family disputes. The law relating to writs of habeas corpus in\ncases  of  unlawful  confinement  will  also  be  reviewed.  The  High  Courts  have  began\nexperimenting with delay reduction techniques based on a modern case management system to\nreduce  the  backlog  of  pending  cases.  Currently,  many  of  the  subordinate  court  judges  handle\nboth civil and criminal cases. In order to facilitate improved case docket management, civil and\ncriminal cases will be separated and assigned to different courts so that individual judges with\nhandle either criminal or civil cases. Similarly, separate full-time benches will be established in\nthe Sindh and Lahore High Courts for commercial cases. In addition, court administration will be\nimproved through a phased program that will result in induction of professional managers and\nuse of modern management techniques in the court system to ensure efficient use of resources.\nImproved case and docket management cuts across the judiciary, prosecution services, and the\nprisons. A comprehensive information technology plan will be developed for this purpose and its\nimplementation will commence under the AJP.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Government  also  recognizes  the  need  to  promote  alternative  dispute\nresolution (ADR). For this purpose, the recently enacted Local Government Ordinances provide\nfor establishment of Anjuman-e-Masalihat (conciliatory bodies). In addition, the High Courts will\nalso  promote  use  of  court-annexed  ADR  as  part  of  their  delay  reduction  strategies.  In  this\nrespect,  the  High  Courts  have  agreed  to  review  procedural  rules  to  facilitate  ADR.  The  legal\nframework for ADR will also be strengthened through a thorough review of the Arbitration Act to\nbring  it  in  conformity  with  international  standards.  This  will  contribute  to  creating  a  favorable\nenvironment for both domestic and foreign direct investment.\n\nDelivery  of  justice,  however,  is  not  confined  to  the  courts.  Many  of  the  public\u2019s\ngrievances arise from maladministration by government officials. The Government is, therefore,\ncommitted  to  improving  the  functioning  of  the  federal  and  provincial  ombudsmen  while\nestablishing offices of district ombudsmen under the Local Government Ordinances. Working of\nthe  ombudsmen  offices  will  be  reviewed  and  new  appellate  procedures  introduced  to  reduce\n\n\f38\n\nAppendix 1, page 3\n\ndelay. The Government will also review existing legislation to ensure greater independence and\nsecurity of tenure for the ombudsmen.\n\nBeyond  institutional  change,  the  rule  of  law  assumes  an  active  citizenry  aware  of  its\nrights  and  capable  of  enforcing  them.  The  Government  supports  a  series  of  initiatives  to\nimprove the status of the poor in particular, and the citizens in general as regards their dealings\nwith  the  state.  Accordingly,  the  Government  will  introduce  the  freedom  of  information  act  to\nallow ready access by citizens to information that affects their rights while at the same time, it\nwill commence publishing simplified explanations of new federal and provincial laws in Urdu. To\nstrengthen  rule  of  law  and  protect  citizens  from  arbitrary  executive  actions,  the  immunity\nenjoyed  by  civil  servants  will  be  reviewed  to  make  them  liable  for  torts  committed  against\ncitizens  as  envisaged  under  Article  212(2)  of  the  Constitution.  In  addition,  a  law  will  be\npromulgated  so  that  rules,  regulations,  and  circulars  having  the  effect  of  law  only  shall  be\npublished in the official gazette. Contempt and defamation laws will also be reviewed to strike a\nbalance  between  freedom  of  expression,  and  sanctity  of  the  courts  and  the  rights  of  the\nindividual.  To  protect  citizens  as  consumers,  consumer  protection  legislation  in  place  for\nIslamabad will be implemented and country-wide legislation will also be introduced.\n\nA  country  such  as  Pakistan  cannot  sustain  a  state-financed  legal  aid  system.  Yet,  the\nneeds of the poor for justice must be met. In the first instance, they must be made aware of their\nrights, and ways must be found to ensure that they enjoy equal protection of law as mandated\nby  the  Constitution.  Beyond  the  policy  initiatives  outlined  above  to  improve  the  state-citizen\ninterface,  other  steps  must  be  taken  to  ensure  that  the  poor  in  particular,  and  the  citizens\ngenerally  are  legally  empowered.  This  requires  public-private  partnerships  and  active\ninvolvement  of  civil  society.  To  promote  such  initiatives,  a  portion  of  the  ADJF  will  support  a\nvariety of civil society legal empowerment initiatives from legal literacy to advocacy and public\ninterest litigation. Under the AJP, citizen orientation of courts and other institutions will also be\npromoted. In courts, information centers will be established in partnership with civil society and\nthe  bar.  In  addition,  improved  administration  within  the  judicial  system,  greater  transparency\nthrough  publication  of  annual  reports  by  the  High  Courts  and  holding  of  annual  judicial\nconferences  will  promote  greater  citizen  focus.  To  further  improve  the  legal  position  of  the\nvulnerable poor, a study of laws adversely affecting the poor will be carried out to identify legal\nreform  initiatives  for  the  poor.  This  will  include  a  study  of  the  rights  of  the  poor  to  natural\nresources and the environment. Environmental justice will be strengthened by establishment of\nenvironmental  tribunals  and  ensuring  that  separate  individuals  head  the  environmental\ndepartments and environmental protection agencies to eliminate any conflict of interest.\n\nA long-term challenge for access to justice relates to improving human resources within\nthe judiciary and the police. This requires a multi-faceted approach. To encourage law schools\nto  raise  their  standards,  the  ADJF  will  support  innovations  in  legal  education  by  existing  law\nschools. In addition, the Government will work with the private sector and existing public sector\ninstitutions to establish centers of excellence in legal education. More immediately, the training\nof judges is of paramount importance. For this purpose, the Federal Judicial Academy has been\nfurther  strengthened  through  increase  in  faculty  positions  and  allocation  of  greater  resources\nthrough  the  AJDF.  Improvement  in  human  resources  is,  however,  not  simply  a  function  of\ntraining. Therefore, the Government is committed to reviewing terms and conditions of service\nof subordinate judges while at the same time, working with the High Courts to institute improved\nincentive  systems  for  the  subordinate  judiciary,  including  introduction  of  revised  performance\nstandards  and  transparent  recruitment  procedures  for  the  subordinate  judiciary.  The  judiciary\n\n\f39\n\nAppendix 1, page 4\n\n will  be  able  to  better  articulate  its  problems  and  needs  through  district,  province  and  federal\nlevel annual judicial conferences.\n\nAs part of its commitment to improved governance, the Government has also initiated a\nprocess  of  comprehensive  reform  of  the  police.  In  the  first  stage,  amendments  have  been\nintroduced  to  existing  legislation  to  depoliticize  the  police  force  by  establishing  public  safety\ncommissions  at  the  federal,  provincial  and  district  levels,  and  their  composition  and  selection\nprocedures  will  ensure  adequate  political  neutrality  to  ensure  rule  of  law.  Various  legal  and\nadministrative measures have been taken and a plan is to be prepared to enhance institutional\nperformance  of  the  police,  including  forensic  facilities,  modernizing  and  improving  criminal\nrecords  and  investigation  capacity,  policing  capacity  and  training.  Under  further  legislation,\naccountability  of  the  police  will  also  be  enhanced  through  independent  police  authorities  and\nestablishment of independent prosecution agencies in each of the provinces. As in the case of\nthe  judiciary,  human  resource  development  will  be  important,  with  particular  focus  on  training\nand  introduction  of  improved  incentive  systems  that  promote  greater  citizen  orientation  and\nrespect for human rights and gender sensitization.\n\nThe  Government  is  acutely  aware  of  marginalization  of  women  regarding  their  legal\nentitlements.  With  respect  to  the  judiciary  and  the  police,  the  Government  is  committed  to  a\npolicy of promoting greater gender sensitization, while actively promoting recruitment of women\nwithin the judiciary through, among other things, revising service rules to remove gender biases\nand facilitating induction of more women judges. In addition, the AJDF will provide resources for\ncivil  society  groups  to  raise  awareness  among  women  about  their  legal  entitlements  and  to\nassist women to enforce their rights. In addition, the Government will support activities to forge\nconsensus on laws and policies to improve the status of women.\n\nMr. President, the AJP is a first step on a long road to reforms that will strengthen the\nrule  of  law  in  Pakistan  and  make  a  qualitative  difference  to  governance.  The  AJP  comprises\nambitious and challenging reforms that have been developed with participation of the provincial\ngovernments and the judiciary. We look forward to ADB\u2019s support for the implementation of the\nAJP  and  continuing  policy  dialogue  to  assess  support  for  future  initiatives.  I  appreciate  and\nvalue  ADB\u2019s  role  and  assistance  in  designing  and  forging  a  consensus  around  such  a\ncomprehensive reform package.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMinister of Finance\n\n\fPOLICY MATRIX\n\n1\n\nTranches\nIT1\nX\n\n2\n\n3\n\nInstitutional Performance\n\nTranches\n\n1\n\nIT\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1.

Allocations will only be made from the proceeds of the income earned on the ADJFs investments.\n2.  Ceilings and caps are to be estimated on a triannual basis and approved by the governing body.\n3. \n\nIf no proposal worthy of support is approved, the amount unutilized will be capitalized/ploughed back into the\nADJF.\n\n8. \nThe  allocations  for  the  JDF  will  be  earmarked  exclusively  for  subordinate  courts,\nalthough the funds will flow through the provincial high courts. The distribution to the provincial\nand  district  JDFs  from  the  central  pool  will  be  population  based,  employing  the  population\nshares  agreed  upon  under  the  National  Finance  Commission  or  other  suitable  and  mutually\nagreed upon arrangements.\n\n9. \nSome programs (especially in connection with the LEF, FILE, and LJRF) are likely to be\nnational in character, and the applications/proposals of such nature will be scrutinized by one of\nthe sub-committees with the mandate for a particular area/subject/subsector.\n\n10. \nOther than income from the instruments in which the AJDF will be invested, increments\nin  the  it  will  come  from  the  imposition  of  fees  for  seeking  unjustifiable  adjournments  of  case\nhearings (new proposal). To quality for access to the JDF, individual courts will agree to opening\na special purpose collection account, into which the proceeds collected as \u201ccosts to the court\u201d\nwill be deposited, and enabling legislation will be enacted.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 3, page 3\n\nD. \n\nJudicial Development Fund\n\n1. \n\nObjective\n\n2. \n\nEligible Expenditures\n\nUntil such time that adequate funding is made for subordinate courts, the JDF will secure\n\n11. \nfunding for the subordinate courts to finance an approved list of expenditures.\n\n12. \nAccess  to  funds  will  be  carefully  controlled  to  avoid  overlapping  ambits  and  multiple\nwindows that can be accessed for financing similar nonsalary inputs and investments. Controls\nwill  be  built  in  to  check  potential  abuse  by  the  administrators  through  manipulation  of  the\nallocations from the ADJF for recurrent expenditures and investment programs. Financing from\nthe JDF will, therefore be restricted, for example, to the following activities/projects/expenditure\nheads plus the maintenance costs of such facilities:\n\n(i) \n\noperation  and  maintenance  of  court  automation  (e.g.,  computers,  photocopying\nfacilities, fax machines);\n\n(ii) \n\nreliable storage space for records (cupboards, racks, etc.);\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\ncourt-centric  information  kiosks  (providing  basic  information  to  litigants  on  court\nfees, where to file cases, etc.);\n\nprovision  of  court-related  conveniences  to  the  litigants,  public  amenities  like\nbenches, water and air coolers; and\n\npaying travel, board, and lodging costs of members of the Fund\u2019s governing body\nnot based at the seat of the provincial high court; the maximum amount that can\nbe expended on this component from the total income of the AJDF for the year\nwill be 3 percent of total earnings.\n\n3. \n\nSharing Arrangements\n\n13. \nThe fund will be exclusively for subordinate courts. Allocations for the JDF will be shared\namong  the  districts  on  the  basis  of  agreed  upon  criteria  which  may  be  a  combination  of  the\npopulation of the district, case load, number of judges, adjournment fees, and collections, each\nbeing  attached  a  different  weight.  To  ensure  transparency,  the  sharing  will  be  formula  driven\nand protected from the misapplication of discretionary powers.\n\n4. \n\nGovernance Structure\n\n14. \nIn  each  province,  JDF  will  be  administered  by  a  governing  board.  The  proposed\ncomposition  of  the  governing  board  is  the  chief  justice  of  the  respective  high  court  to  be\nrepresented by the administrative judge, the registrar of the high court, one representative of the\nhigh court bar, one representative of one of the district bars, one representative of the provincial\nchamber  of  commerce  (the  last  two  members  to  be  inducted  for  three  years  by  rotation,  with\nselection of districts on an alphabetical basis), one person nominated by the Government from a\nrespected  nongovernment  organization,  and  one  respected  female  lawyer/jurist.  Civil  society\nrepresentation  will  be  mandatory  in  the  governing  body  at  the  provincial  and  district  levels.\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 3, page 4\n\nThis board will review and endorse guidelines developed at the national level for the JDF\n\n15. \non the purposes for which and the manner in which the JDF can be utilized.\n\nThe share of each district, once distributed, will be placed at the disposal of a committee\n16. \nat  the  district  level  comprising  the  district  and  session  judge,  the  president  of  the  district  bar\nassociation,  the  respective  district  coordinating  officer  and  one  president  of  the  tehsil  bar\nassociation  to  be  represented  by  rotation  (again  alphabetical).  This  committee  will  have  legal\nstatus  and  will  be  empowered  to  deploy  these  funds  at  its  discretion  for  the  stated/prescribed\npurposes to different courts on the basis of need.\n\nQuarterly reports/accounts will be submitted to the board/committee on the utilization of\n\n17. \nthe funds to become eligible for next year\u2019s share of the allocations.\n\nE. \n\nLegal Empowerment Fund\n\n1. \n\nObjective\n\n18. \nThe  LEF  will  fund  legal  aid  and  public  awareness  efforts  on  matters  of  the  rule  of  law\nand  on  civil  society  initiatives  concerned  with  the  protection  of  rights-based  civil  liberties.  This\nbeing a public good, the State has to ensure that it gets served by leveraging social capital with\na small contribution from the State \u2013 a small portion of the total cost.\n\n2. \n\nEligible Expenditures\n\n19. \n\nThe categories of activities to be funded from this window may include:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nlegal  aid  to  indigent  clients  (advice  and  referral)  affected  by  violations  of  their\nfundamental  rights  by  the  executive,  especially  on  matters  concerned  with\ncriminal justice; at least 50 percent of the available funds should be set aside for\nthis category;\n\nlegal aid for administrative redressal systems/institutional grievances; those who\ncannot defend themselves against police excesses need assistance to access an\nindependent complaints authority against such harassment;\n\n(iii) \n\nrepresentation- public interest litigation;\n\n(iv) \n\npublic awareness and legal literacy campaign, especially for women;\n\n(v) \n\nawareness of environmental laws; and\n\n(vi) \n\nlaw reform and advocacy.\n\nIn case of (i)-(iii), the proportion of funds related to such programs (as determined by the\n20. \nLaw Commission) will flow to the provincial high court for the relevant provincial level committee\n(see JDF) to identify associated activities and organizations that should be supported from the\nallocations for such purposes.\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 3, page 5\n\nF. \n\nFund for Innovations in Legal Education\n\n1. \n\nObjective\n\n21. \n\nThe FILE will strengthen the quality of legal education in law schools.\n\n2. \n\nEligible Expenditures\n\nFunds  may  be  expanded  for  innovations  in  the  teaching  of  legal  education  and  the\n\n22. \ndevelopment of curricula, including funding of pilot projects.\n\n23. \nThe FJA Fund will be used to improve the efficiency of the courts by upgrading the skills\nof  existing  and  fresh  entrants  to  the  judicial  cadre  through  better  preservice  and  in-service\ntraining programs organized by FJA whose capacity will be strengthened.\n\nG. \n\nFederal Judicial Academy\n\n1. \n\nObjective\n\n2. \n\nEligible Expenditures\n\n24. \n\nEligible expenditures will be\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\npreservice and in-service training programs for the judiciary;\n\ntraining  and  education  for  nonjudicial  personnel,  e.g.,  administrators,  registrars,\nand  other  support  staff,  in  policy  development  and  implementation,  case  flow\nmanagement, budgets, planning, information systems, and records management;\n\nThe LJRF will promote applied research on the legal and judicial system that can inform\n\n(iii) \n\ndevelopment of training materials and aids.\n\nH. \n\nLegal and Judicial Research Fund\n\n1. \n\nObjective\n\n25.\npolicy making.\n\n26. \njudgment.\n\n2. \n\nEligible Expenditures\n\nExpenditures  may  be  for  legal  and  judicial  research  aimed  at  improving  the  quality  of\n\n27. \n\nThe Law Commission and other research bodies will be eligible to apply for these funds.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 4, page 1\n\nPOVERTY IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n\n1.\nThe  five  broad  outputs  expected  from  the  Access  to  Justice  Program  (AJP)  are  (i)\nimprovement of policy and legal frameworks to remove major constraints on public rights (such\nas access to information, redress, and public accountability), commerce and investment, judicial\nindependence,  and  depoliticization  of  the  police,  among  others;  and  improved  accountability\nand  performance  of  public  sector  performance  in  delivering  services;  (ii)  greater  efficiency,\ntimeliness,  and  effectiveness  in  judiciary  and  policy  administration;  (iii)  greater  equity  and\naccessibility    of  judicial  and  police  services  for  the  poor;  (iv)  improved  allocation  of  fiscal  and\nhuman  resources  required  for  judicial  and  police  reforms;  and  (v)  greater  transparency  and\naccountability  in  performance  of  the  judiciary  and  police.  Collectively  these  are  analyzed  in\nterms  of  their  anticipated  impacts  on  the  labor  market,  prices  of  goods  and  services,  public\nexpenditures, and access to public goods and services.\n\n2.\nImpact on Labor Market. On the macro level, the AJP\u2019s impact on the labor market is\nexpected  to  be  positive,  as  the  constraints  will  be  diminished  for  market-based  economic\ngrowth.  In  particular,  increases  are  expected  in  foreign  direct  investment  and  the  accelerated\ndevelopment  of  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  which  are  engines  of  job  creation.  The\ndirect  short-term  impact  of  the  AJP  on  the  labor  market,  however,    will  not  be  as  significant.\nAlthough  the  AJP  will  provide  some  additional  budgeted  positions  such  as  lower  court  judges\nand police officers, their numbers will be small in relation to the entire formal job market. In the\ninformal job market, an indirect impact will be the loss of income for existing rent seekers who\nare able to facilitate judicial and police services under the current system.\n\n3.\nImpact on Prices of Goods and Services. On the macro level, the AJP is expected to\nreduce the cost of all business enterprises- from the large corporations down to the streetside\nvendors- through more efficient access to judicial services along with a more service-prone, less\ncorrupt  police.  This  increased  business  efficiency  is  expected  to  lower  the  domestic  prices  of\ngoods and services. In the short term, the AJP will act to increase service charges for legal fees\nthat  redress  the  legal  fee  structures,  which  do  not  adequately  cover  the  real  costs  of  the\nservices. Because the hidden costs to the public will be replaced by higher legal fees the impact\non the overall price of these services will be minimal if not lessened. Surveys have revealed that\nthe  public  (both  poor  and  well-to-do)  are  willing  to  pay  higher  legal  fees  if  they  fully  cover  the\nservice for which they are intended.\n\n4.\nImpact  on  Public  Expenditures:  A  significant  increase  for  the  judiciary  and  police  is\nexpected  in  both  recurrent  and  development  expenditures  by  both  the  Federal  and  provincial\ngovernments  and  is  a  key  element  to  the  success  of  the  AJP.  In  addition  to  the  increased\nbudgetary  allocation  for  these  sectors,  the  AJP  is  expected  to  contribute  directly  to  the  better\nmanagement  of  all  public  expenditure,  which  in  turn  will  improve  efficiency  and  quality  in  the\ndelivery  of  social  services  in  general.  This  is  significant,  since  the  Government  is  the  main\nprovider for the poor in Pakistan.\n\n5.\nImpact  on  Access  to  Public  Goods  and  Services.  The  short-term  impact  on  the\nimproved  judiciary  and  police  is  not  expected  to  be  significant,  since  the  reform  process  will\nrequire not only changes in the institutions and legal framework but, perhaps most importantly,\nchanges  in  the  perceptions,  expectations,  and  behavior  of  both  the  service  providers  and  the\ngeneral public at large. However, that is not to say that immediate positive impacts in improved\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 4, page 2\n\nservices  are  not  expected  through  pilot  projects  to  speed  up  delivery  of  justice  and  police\nservices  at  the  neighborhood  levels.  For  the  poor,  the  most  significant  impact  should  be  that\nbeing  poor  will  not  deprive  them  of  a  basic  sense  of  security  from  abuse  by  those  who  have\nmore  wealth  or  power,  nor  of  the  attainment  of  increased  personal  security  from  unjustified\nharassment from the judiciary and police.\n\nChannel\n\nLabor\nMarket\n\nDirect\n(short-term)\nMinimal effect jobs\nin the judiciary and\npolice through the\ncreation of new\npositions.\n\nIndirect\n(medium-term)\nIncome losses for\nrent seekers\nfacilitating\nservices under\ncurrent system.\n\nType of Effect\n\nMacro\n\nImprovement of\nbusiness\nconfidence.\n\nPrices\n\nPublic\nExpenditures\n\nAccess to\nPublic Goods\nand Services\n\nService charges for\nlegal fees are to be\nincreased but\nconsumers are\nwilling to pay for\nbetter service\nespecially if hidden\nchanges are\nabolished.\nDespite budgetary\nconstraints\nincrease\ngovernment\nexpenditure for\njudiciary and police\nadministration.\nDue to the\ntremendous\nbacklog of cases\nand entrenched\npractices in the\nlegal/justice system\nthe significant\nimmediate effect is\nnot anticipated.\n\nEmployment\ngeneration in\nprivate sector as\ninvestment\nincreases.\n\nOther sector may\nreceive relatively\nsmaller\nbudgetary\nallocation given\nbudgetary\nconstraints.\nA significant\nimprovement in\nthe timeliness\nand quality of\nlegal services is\nexpected.\n\nIncreased\nbusiness\nefficiency of\nformal\nbusinesses is\nexpected to lower\nprices of\ndomestic goods\nand services.\nOverall fiscal\ndeficit targets\nagreed upon with\nIMF will be\nmaintained.\n\nSpillover effect to\nimproved delivery\nof public foods\nacross as the\nefficiency and\neffectiveness of\njudicial and police\nservices\npermeate\nthroughout the\npublic sector.\n\nImpact on\nNon-Poor\n\nSkilled and\neducated labor is\nexpected to\nbenefit from\nincreased foreign\ninvestment that\ncreates\nemployment\nopportunities.\n\nImpact relatively\nless on non-poor\nwho have access\nto justice and\npolice services\nthrough their\nposition of power\nor financial\nstrength.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 5, page 1\n\nINSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR PROGRAM MANAGEMENT\n\nA. \n\nProgram Loan Agency Arrangements\n\n1. \nThe Ministry of Law, Justice, Human Rights and Parliamentary Affairs (MOL) will be the\nProgram  Executing  Agency  with  a  program  management  unit  (PMU)  headed  by  a  full-time\ndirector/joint  secretary,  a  deputy  director  and  support  staff.  At  the  Federal  level,  the\nimplementing  agencies  will  be  (i)  the  Law  Commission,  (ii)  the  Federal  Ombudsman,  (iii)  the\nFederal  Judicial  Academy,  and  (iv)  the  Ministry  of  Interior.  In  each  province,  the  provincial\nimplementing  agencies  will  be  the  departments  of  law  and  home,  reporting  to  the  provincial\nplanning and development board/department, which will coordinate the program activities within\nthe province. The law department will be responsible for program activities concerning the high\ncourts, the independent prosecution services, and the ombudsmen. The home department will\nbe  responsible  for  program  activities  concerning  the  police  and  public  safety  commissions\n(PSCs).\n\nB. \n\nTechnical Assistance Loan Agency Arrangements\n\nThe PMU within MOL, operating within the Acesss to Justice Program(AJP) annual plan\n2. \nand budget prepared by the program review committee, will be responsible for all procurement\nand  contract  management,  including  gaining  contact  clearances  from  ADB  Headquarters.  In\nboth MOL and the Ministry of Interior there will be on AJP cluster TA loan supervision committee\nresponsible  for  preparing  terms  of  reference,  sourcing  domestic  consultants,  and  requesting\nPMU support for necessary contracting and management. These committees will be responsible\nfor  monitoring  consultants;  certifying  their  progress  to  MOL  for  the  purpose  of  contract\npayments;  and,  on  a  quarterly  and  annual  basis,  preparing  progress  reports  to  the  National\nProgram Review and Coordination Committee (NPRCC).\n\n3. \nAt the provincial level, the TA cluster loan activities will be the responsibility of the law\ndepartment and the home department, in the context of the AJP annual plan and budget. While\ncontract  management  will  remain  the  PMU  is  responsibility,  P&D  will  be  responsible  for\ncoordinating TA activities in the province, including monitoring progress. Prepayment iertification\nto  MOL  will  be  provided  by  the  law  department  and  home  department,  with  P&D  retaining  a\nsupervisory role. This task will be supported by procurement and supervision committees in the\nhigh court law department and home department.

The  review  process  will  be\ncarried out each year through a participatory process beginning at the district level (Figure 3).\nThe process will occur during the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year, just prior to the\nnew fiscal year, to enable federal, provincial and district authorities to reflect the results, where\nappropriate,  in  their  statutory  planning  and  budgeting  process.  The  aim  of  this  process  is  to\nensure that judgments about progress, and future priorities, reflect the particular circumstances\nand  interests  of  proviniale  and  lower  level  authorities,  not  just  in  the  judiciary,  police,  and\nadministration,  but  with  significant  input  from  civil  society  actors  as  well  The  process  provides\nfor  systematic  input  by  district  level  authorities  and  civil  society,  building  to  the  provincial  and\nthen to the Federal level. This process will provide an essential complement to judgements to\nbe made by province and federal governments in guiding and implementing the reform process.\n\n7.\nTo  ensure  that  the  AJP  supports  rather  than  constrains  this  learning  and  policy  review\nprocess, the annual performance review process will take into account the level of effort put in\nto  carry  out  such  activities,  the  difficulties  encountered,  the  progress  made,  and  the\nmodifications  required  to  achieve  the  objectives  of  the  complementary  activities.  Satisfactory\nconclusion to the annual performance review process (i.e., not necessarily full compliance) on\nthe  complementary  activities  and  agreement  on  a  revised  set  of  such  activities  for  the  next\nperformance  review  will  be  a  condition  for  release  of  the  second  and  third  tranches.\nPerformance  review  milestones  for  the  second  and  third  tranche  will,  therefore,  provide  an\nthe  AJP.\nopportunity \n\nto  review,  modify,  or  add  complementary  activities \n\nto  support \n\nF i g u r e   3 :   A n n u a l   P r o g r a m   R e v i e w   P r o c e s s\n\nA D B\n\nC I D A\n\nU N D P\n\nO t h e r   B i la t e r a l  a n d\nM u lt i la t e r a l   A g e n c i e s\n\nA i d   F o r u m   o n\nG o v e r n a n c e\nR e f o r m s\n\nN a t i o n a l   P r o g r a m   R e v i e w\na n d   C o o r d i n a t i n g\nC o m m i t t e e\n\nP u b lic it y   a n d\nI n f o r m a t io n\n\nA n n u a l  P e r f o r m a n c e\nR e v ie w s   a n d   P l a n s\n\nProvincial Level R eview  Process\n\nH i g h   C o u r t s\n\nP u b l ic\nS a f e t y\nC o m m is s i o n\n\nC o u r t s\n\nP S C\n\nP r o v i n c i a l   P r o g r a m\nR e v i e w     C o m m i t t e e\n\nP r o v i n c i a l\nA n n u a l\nC o n f e r e n c e\n\nC iv il   S o c ie t y\nF o r u m s   o n\nR e f o r m s\n\nC o m m u n i t y\nS u r v e y s\n\nO m b u d s m a n\n\nD istrict Level R eview  Process\n\nD is t r ic t     L G\nF o r u m s   o n\nR e f o r m s\n\nC iv il   S o c ie t y\nF o r u m s   o n\nR e f o r m s\n\nC o m m u n i t y\nS u r v e y s\n\nO m b u d s m a n\n\nC C B s\n\nCIDA = Canadian International Development Agency, UNDP = United Nation Development Programme\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 5, page 5\n\nF. \n\nRole of the Program Management Unit\n\n8.\nDrawing on resources from both the TA grant and the TA cluster loan, the Government\nwill  establish  the  PMU  to  take  prime  responsibility  for  key  management  and  monitoring\nresponsibilities.
