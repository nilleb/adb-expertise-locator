I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for additional financing for the Dry Zone Urban \nWater and Sanitation Project.1  \n \n2.  In 2009, the Government of Sri Lanka initiated major rehabilitation and redevelopment \nefforts in northern Sri Lanka to improve the living conditions of conflict-affected people. The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) prepared the Dry Zone Urban Water and Sanitation Project \nunder crisis conditions to assist the government in providing improved water and sanitation \nservices in four major towns in northern and northwestern Sri Lanka.2 The project encountered a \nnumber  of  implementation  challenges  at  the  outset  but  has  since  advanced  significantly. \nDetailed engineering designs have been completed for key subprojects, and the tendering \nprocess is moving forward rapidly. Project cost estimates have increased, leaving the financing \nplan with a shortfall of $50 million. An additional loan of $40 million is needed to help fund the \nproject in its original scale and scope, ensure that its development outcomes are achieved, \nnarrow regional disparities, and support reconciliation in Sri Lanka. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The  original  project.  On  28  November  2008,  ADB  approved  loans  and  grants \nequivalent to $113.33 million for the Dry Zone Urban Water and Sanitation Project.3 At the end \nof  the  conflict  in  2009,  the  project  became  a  critical  part  of  the  government\u2019s  investment \nprogram to modernize and expand basic infrastructure and public services in affected areas.4 \nThe project originally supported development in Sri Lanka\u2019s arid and conflict-affected region, \nwhere basic services such as drinking water supply and sanitation are inadequate because \ncoverage is low and service quality substandard.5 Further, water resources in the region are \nscarce.6 To  address  these  problems,  the  project  calls  for  rehabilitating,  expanding,  and \ndeveloping water and sanitation infrastructure in four major towns in the north and northwest: \nChilaw, Mannar, Puttalam, and Vavuniya. The project supports (i) decentralizing service delivery \nfunctions to regional offices; (ii) strengthening water resource management, coordination, and \nplanning; (iii) building awareness; and (iv) strengthening the institutional capacity of the National \nWater Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB), the project executing agency. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grant to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Dry Zone Urban Water and \nSanitation Project. Manila (Loan 2477/G0129/130-SRI, $85 million, approved on 28 November). \n2  Annual rainfall in Sri Lanka\u2019s northern dry zone ranges from 1,200 to 1,900 millimeters but may be as low as 950 \nmillimeters, as in Mannar. Residents in project areas have been affected by 30 years of conflict and drought. \n3  The project includes a loan for $59.78 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources, a $23.22 million \nAsian Development Fund grant, and a $2 million grant from the Water Financing Partnership Facility. \n4  The government\u2019s investment program prioritized interventions in transport, energy, water supply, wastewater,  and \nirrigation and water resource management. \n5  The project preparatory assessment concluded that coverage ranged from very low in Vavuniya, reaching 10%\u2013\n15% of the population, to low, reaching 50%\u201360% in Mannar, Puttalam, and Chilaw. Service averaged only 2\u20133 \nhours daily in Vavuniya and Mannar, 4\u20135 hours in Chilaw, and 6 hours in Puttalam. Sanitation in the area relies on \nseptic tanks and gray water discharge into stormwater drains. \n6  In all project towns, water is currently extracted from the aquifer. The quality is generally poor, and the aquifer is \nfragile, placing the long-term sustainability of supply is at risk. To meet current and future demand, surface water \nmust supplement groundwater sources. \n ", "2 \n4.  The project was processed in a rapidly changing environment at the height of the conflict. \nThe  original  cost  estimates  were  based  on  feasibility  studies  prepared  under  challenging \nconditions that restricted access to sites and left population patterns uncertain. Consequently, \nthe  project  was  structured  to  first  formulate  detailed  engineering  designs  for  individual \nsubprojects and then undertake construction and equipment installation. \n. \n5.  Progress  in  implementation.  Despite  an  initial  setback  stemming  from  (i)  events \nassociated with conflict cessation,7 (ii) environmental and involuntary resettlement safeguards \nreclassified from category B to category A8 on account of Vavuniya\u2019s reservoir subproject,9 and \n(iii) other start-up delays,10 implementation has gained momentum since early 2012.  \n \n6.  Qualified technical staff are now deployed, detailed engineering designs completed, and \nbidding documents prepared. Half of the procurement packages (at least one in each of the \nproject towns) are either awarded or under evaluation of tenders. This work is advanced, and \ncumulative contract awards are expected to rapidly increase. However, contract award and the \nmobilization of contractors are now affected by the shortfall in the original financing plan. Output \ndelivery is also advancing,11 and construction is progressing effectively and undisrupted as \nsafety and safeguards aspects were carefully considered before contract award. Satisfactory \nresettlement plans and initial environmental examinations have been completed and disclosed. \nA draft environmental impact assessment for Vavuniya\u2019s reservoir has been prepared and \ndisclosed for consultation. Many risks have been addressed following the end of the conflict, \nand the project demonstrates improved project readiness. The project management unit has \nqualified  technical  staff,  and  its  procurement,  resettlement,  environmental  safeguard,  and \nimplementation capacity has been strengthened through training. The status of procurement is \nin Table 1 of the summary of project performance.12 Cumulative contract awards for the project \nare projected to double before the end first quarter 2013, setting the project on track. \n \n7.  The cost overrun. Project costs are $50 million (44% of the original costs) higher, \nbecause of price increases since 2008 and cost underestimation.13 Some physical changes \nwithin the existing scope have been necessary to update the original feasibility assessment \nconducted under crisis conditions and enhance the quality of the infrastructure.14 \n                                                \n7  Critical  issues  adversely  affecting  project  readiness  in  the  months  following  conflict  cessation  included  (i) \nheightened security restrictions in Mannar and Vavuniya, (ii) changes to proposed sites after detailed topographical \ninvestigations in Chilaw and Puttalam, (iii) the reluctance of NWSDB personnel to work in regional offices \nimmediately after the end of the conflict, and (iv) the need to demine Mannar.  \n8  Reclassification for involuntary resettlement was on 13 August 2012, and for environment was on 10 April 2012. \n9  Reclassification resulted from the return and resettlement of internally displaced people after the conflict and \nenvironmental reclassification by the Central Environmental Authority for Vavuniya\u2019s subproject on account of the \ndecision to classify the zone where the reservoir is located as a corridor between nature reserves. This also \ndelayed construction and required mitigation that increased costs.  \n10  Delays affected loan signing, establishing the project management unit, engaging and mobilizing consultants, \ncompleting detailed designs, and receiving approval for land acquisition from local councils and private owners. \n11  For output 1, the selection of raw water sources and designs have been finalized, water rights obtained from the \nDepartment of Irrigation, approval for all water treatment and septage sites received from urban councils, and \ndemining in Mannar completed. Detailed designs have been completed, and procurement for major civil works has \nsubstantially advanced since May 2012. Outputs 2 and 3, on institutional strengthening and capacity development, \nare substantially completed. Under output 2, socioeconomic surveys, water resource assessments, and river basin \nmanagement plans are completed. \n12 Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n13  Cost Estimate Variation Analysis and Cost Overrun Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n14  Changes include (i) increased quantities, material specifications, and processing estimates following detailed \ninvestigation of topographical conditions; (ii) enhanced rehabilitation works for existing water treatment plants in \n ", "3 \n \n8.  Rationale for additional financing. The project remains valid, sound, and strategically \nimportant to underpin welfare, poverty reduction, and reconciliation in the affected areas. This is \nwhy the Government of Sri Lanka requests additional financing from ADB, the net benefit of \nwhich  outweigh  those  of  other  options,  including  project  restructuring  and  downscaling. \nReducing  the  number  of  components  by  dropping  either  water  supply  or  sanitation  would \nprevent  the  project  from  achieving  its  intended  impact  of  improving  public  health  and  the \nenvironment in areas severely affected by long conflict and drought. Reducing the number of \ntowns would forfeit investments made to date as losses. Additional financing complies with ADB \neligibility requirements.15    \n \n9.  Project risks have been managed and mitigated. Exogenous risks associated with the \nconflict during project preparation no longer apply, and corrective action such as demining and \nresettling displaced persons has been done or is advanced. Remedial measures have been \ndeveloped to address implementation issues, such as (i) deploying qualified staff, (ii) capacity \nstrengthening, (iii) appointing a standing committee to expedite procurement, and (iv) costing \ndone based on detailed designs and current market prices. The project displays a high level of \nreadiness, with all contracts projected for award by mid-2013. Postponing processing could \ncause further implementation delays and associated cost overruns. 16  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The project will improve the quality of life of residents in the north and northwestern dry \nzone and contribute to economic activity and job creation. The impact of the project will be \nimproved welfare in the north and northwestern dry zone. The outcome will be the improved \ndelivery of urban water and sanitation services in Sri Lanka\u2019s northewestern dry zone towns.17  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  The outputs are (i) urban water supply and sanitation infrastructure in four target towns; \n(ii) strengthened water institutions, including support to decentralize service delivery functions to \nregional offices to strengthen water resource management, coordination, and planning ability \nand to build public awareness; and (iii) capacity development for project management and \nimplementation. The outputs remain unchanged.  \n \n12.  Output 1 will finance infrastructure to abstract, treat, and distribute 61,500 cubic meters \nof water per day. It will support water resource development; the rehabilitation and construction \nof  new  treatment  facilities;  and  the  construction  of  storage,  transmission,  and  distribution \nsystems. The investments will maintain water supply in project towns, achieve adequate water \nquality  and  service  standards,  and  expand  coverage  to  underserved  areas.  It  will  finance \n                                                                                                                                                       \nChilaw and Puttalam, and treatment type of new plants; (iii) accounting for infilling for the distribution pipe network; \nand (iv) increased diameter of transmission and distribution pipes to satisfy future demand. \n15 ADB. 2011. Additional Financing. Operations Manual. OM H5/BP. Manila (para. 4). Under Additional Financing, a \nproject is eligible for additional financing if it remains technically feasible, economically viable, and financially \nsound; the government has accorded it highest priority (which is the case as it supports regions affected by \nprolonged conflict); and it is consistent with project development objectives; ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nSri Lanka, 2012\u20132016, which supports development in lagging regions; and ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011-\n2020. \n16  Footnote 21 of OM H5/BP qualifies well-performing ratings as the project having been rated on track for at least 12 \nmonths before cross-departmental circulation of the draft report and recommendation of the President.  \n17  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. Contribution to the ADB Results Framework \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \nimprovements in septage management and disposal systems in all four project towns, as well \nas a low-cost sanitation for poor communities in the form of household latrines in newly served \nperiurban areas. \n \n13.  Output 2 supports water resource monitoring, coordination, and planning, as well as \nregulatory initiatives through the preparation of catchment management plans and extraction \nregulations,  groundwater  and  user  mapping,  and  the  establishment  of  a  water  resources \ninformation center. This component will also help NWSDB transfer functions and responsibilities \nto  regional  offices  in  Puttalam,  Mannar,  and  Vavuniya  and  strengthen  local  government \nsanitation planning, management, and enforcement capacity. \n \n14.  Output  3  covers  incremental  administration  costs  and  counterpart  staff  of  NWSDB, \nurban  councils,  and  the  Irrigation  Department.  It  includes  preliminary  investigations  and \nconsulting services to assist project implementation staff. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n15.  The revised project cost is estimated at $163.3 million, including taxes and duties.

Consulting  services. The design and construction supervision consultancy contract \nincludes 60 person-months of international consultancy and 588 person-months of national \nexpertise. A 4-year contract was competitively awarded in August 2010. With the proposed \nproject extension, an estimated additional 23 person-months of international consultancy and \n411 person-months of national expertise will be required. Single-source selection through a \ncontract variation will be used to extend design and construction supervision consultant input to \nproject  completion,  subject  to  satisfactory  performance.  This  is  to  ensure  continuity.

In Vavuniya and Puttalam, granular activated carbon filters will be added \nto the treatment process to remove algae. In Vavuniya, the average raw water supply of 6,700 \ncubic meters (m3) per day will be supplemented with groundwater from Per Aru downstream \nareas  of  Ranimill,  Thandikulam.  In  Puttalam,  as  part  of  rehabilitating  the  existing  water \ntreatment plant, nanofiltration or reverse osmosis will be used to treat groundwater that is \nexcessively hard and contaminated by manganese and iron. The diameter of the transmission \nmains will be increased from 450 millimeters to 560 millimeters to accommodate demand after \n2030. In Puttalam, the total length of water pipes laid will increase from 137 to 221 kilometers to \naccommodate infilling in the same distribution area. In Chilaw, the Bangadeniya water tower will \nbe replaced by a groundwater reservoir and capacity increased from 750 m3 to 1,750 m3 to \nmeet operational requirements. Variable speed drive pumps will be used for water distribution. \nHigh-density polyethylene pipes will replace ductile iron pipes due to the corrosive nature of \nsoils in Chilaw and Puttalam. NWSDB will introduce water safety plans to monitor water quality \nfrom intake to consumption points. \n \n22.  Septage treatment plants. Wastewater treatment processes have been revised. Sludge \nthickening tanks have been replaced by stabilization ponds as the latter are more cost effective \nand will simplify operation and maintenance (O&M) by urban councils. The capacity of septage \n ", "7 \ntreatment plants will be 30 m3/day, which is adequate to cover septage requirements in target \nareas. \n \n23.  Population coverage. Socioeconomic20 and census surveys21 conducted in 2010\u20132011 \nhave confirmed the population projections developed during project processing in 2008. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n24.  Economic  viability  and  sustainability.  Economic  analyses  have  been  redone.22 \nQuantified water supply benefits are (i) resource cost savings from avoided treating and storage \nof water with the shift to piped water, (ii) the economic value of incremental water consumed \nwith increased water supply, and (iii) the value of time saved not collecting water. Quantified \nsanitation benefits include (i) avoided medical costs and gains in productivity from reduced \nmorbidity rates, (ii) avoided cost of sewage disposal on site, and (iii) the value of compost that \nthe subproject is expected to generate. The estimated economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) \nof  individual  water  supply  schemes  range  from  13.2%  to  20.1%.  Septage  schemes  have \nindividual EIRRs ranging from 19.1% to 46.1%. Sensitivity analyses23 show the schemes most \nsensitive  to  increased  capital  costs,  but  their  EIRRs  remain  well  above  their  economic \nopportunity cost of capital,24 except if the Puttalam water scheme has higher capital costs, \nwhich is unlikely. The sustainability of the individual schemes is ensured with adequate funding \nfor their O&M. The proposed schemes will have the following social benefits: improved access \nto basic services, new employment opportunities, and lower poverty. The project is also justified \nin social benefit terms.25 \n \n25.  Financial viability and sustainability. Financial viability and sustainability have been \nreevaluated.26 Current  tariffs  were  used  in  the  analyses,  and  increases  were  projected  to \ndetermine financial viability. Assuming a tariff increase of 17.5% every 2 years uniformly applied \nto the water supply and septage schemes in the four towns, yields financial internal rates of \nreturn (FIRRs) well above the weighted average cost of capital of 2.5%.27 The estimated FIRRs \nof the water supply schemes range from 2.6% to 6.6% and of septage schemes from 4.8% to \n5.8%. Sensitivity analyses show the schemes are most sensitive to lower revenue, but their \nFIRRs remain well above the weighted average cost of capital.28 Tariffs are affordable to low-\nincome households, at 3.8% of their monthly income. The schemes are financially sustainable \nwith adequate O&M funding. Financial projections of individual schemes show positive net \nincome  and  cash  flows  each  year  over  the  forecast  period  after  the  schemes  become \noperational.29 \n                                                \n20 The consultancy for package C, water resource management, conducted a socioeconomic assessment in 2011. \nThe results were included in their draft final report. \n21 Government of Sri Lanka, Department of Census and Statistics. 2011. Household Income and Expenditure Survey, \nFinal Report 2009/2010. Colombo; district secretariat population surveys. \n22  The economic analysis used revised cost estimates in accordance with ADB. 2007. Guidelines for the Economic \nAnalysis of Projects. Manila. \n23  The scenarios were 10% higher capital costs and O&M costs and 10% less in benefits. \n24 The economic opportunity cost of capital is assumed at 12% for water supply and 10% for sanitation. \n25 Economic Analysis: Revised (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 The financial analysis used revised cost estimates in accordance with ADB. 2005 Guidelines for the Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects. Manila and ADB. 2009. Financial Due Diligence, A Methodology Note. \nManila. \n27 NWSDB policy is to apply a uniform national tariff to all its water and sewerage schemes in Sri Lanka, and its most \nspecific tariff objective is to recover O&M, debt service, and depreciation for all water supply systems nationally. \nThe most recent tariff revision became effective on 1 October 2012. \n28 The scenarios were 10% higher capital costs and O&M costs and 10% less revenue. \n29 Financial Analysis: Revised (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nC.  Governance \n26.  Policy and legal. NWSDB has, as a statutory entity under the Ministry of Water Supply \nand Drainage, a mandate to develop, operate, and control an efficient, coordinated water supply \nsystem and distribute water for public, domestic, and industrial use. The NWSDB Law No. 2 of \n1974 provides for NWSDB to levy charges for water it supplies.  \n \n27.  Institutional  capacity.  NWSDB  has  sufficient  capacity  and  institutional  strength, \nacquired  through  prior  experience  in  ADB-financed  projects,  to  implement  the  project.  To \nexpedite resettlement in Vavuniya, the project management unit has engaged resettlement \nspecialists to implement resettlement plans in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009)  by  coordinating  with  government  agencies  and  affected  parties.  To  implement  the \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP),  the  project  management  unit  will  engage  an \nenvironmental specialist and a wildlife conservation specialist and thereby ensure compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. NWSDB responsibilities and undertakings for financial \nmanagement, procurement, anticorruption, and project management remain unchanged from \nthe current project. \n \n28.  Procurement and anticorruption. Goods and works are procured in line with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and with prior review by ADB. \nNWSDB has established a website with information on fund use, bids, and contract awards. It \nwill establish a database for defaulting contractors following the procedures outlined in its \nnational procurement guidelines and ADB policies and procedures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and NWSDB. \nSpecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM.  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n29.  The project will deliver water and sanitation services to underserved areas; provide low-\ncost  sanitation  for  poor  communities  in  the  form  of  individual  household  latrines;  engage \nnongovernment  organizations for  community  mobilization  and  building  public  awareness  of \nhealth,  hygiene,  and  sanitation;  and  establish  community-based  organizations  to  manage \ncommunal facilities.30  \n \n30.  Gender-inclusive design elements in the project include gender sensitization for NWSDB \nsenior management and project staff at the central and regional level, targeted gender training \nfor project staff, the collection of sex-disaggregated data, and resettlement that addresses \ngender concerns. The updated summary poverty reduction and social strategy provides updates \non  post-conflict  conditions  in  the  project  area,  with  emphasis  on  the  social  and  gender \ndimensions of resettlement.31  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n31.  Social safeguards. The original project was category B for involuntary resettlement. \nFollowing the end of the conflict, the project was upgraded to category A because of significant \ninvoluntary resettlement required for the Vavuniya reservoir subproject. Three other subprojects, \n                                                \n30 Project  preparatory  surveys  showed  high  poverty  gap  ratios,  income  inequality,  low  education,  and  high \nunemployment. Poverty incidence was 28.9% in Chilaw, 37.5% in Mannar, 39.7% in Puttalam, and 24.4% in \nVavuniya. Marginal improvements are thought to have occurred since 2010. \n31 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy: Updated (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "9 \nin  Chilaw,  Mannar  and  Puttalam,  have  minor  resettlement  impacts.32 For  the  Vavuniya \nsubproject,  66  hectares  of  rice  land  and  25  hectares  of  highland  will  be  acquired.  Land \nacquisition  will  economically  displace  107  households.  Adequate  alternative  rice  land  and \nhighland will be distributed to affected people under the land-for-land compensation program, in \naddition to resettlement assistance provided through livelihood training programs. The project \nwill not have any impact on indigenous peoples. \n \n32.  Environment.  The  project  was  reclassified  from  category  B  to  A  for  environment \nbecause of the anticipated significant environmental impacts of the Vavuniya subproject. The \nreservoir inundation area has recently been designated part of a jungle corridor connecting two \nnature reserves. An environmental impact assessment was prepared for Vavuniya\u2019s reservoir \nsubproject and disclosed for consultation on 13 July 2012. The assessment concludes that, \nalthough two plant species that are endangered and three animal species that are critically \nendangered have been observed in the project impact area, potential harm to them is minimal \nand can be mitigated by bringing an additional area with similar habitat under environmental \nconservation. Site-specific measures outlined in the assessment and biodiversity reports to \nensure the integrity of jungle corridors and the preservation of biodiversity are in the EMP. \n \n33.  Initial environmental examination reports with EMPs, including environmental monitoring \nplans, have been prepared for water supply and septage treatment subprojects in Chilaw, \nPuttalam, and Mannar, as well as water distribution in Vavuniya. All identified and envisaged \nenvironmental impacts can be managed with suitable mitigation measures described in the \nEMPs. Environmental protection measures in the EMPs will be incorporated into civil works \ncontracts.33 The anticipated environmental impacts of the project are typical of civil works, such \nas dust, noise, and construction waste; temporarily disrupted traffic; and soil erosion. The \nproject expects to use existing burrow and quarry sites. If any new burrow or quarry sites are \nneeded, the project management unit will ensure that measures described in the EMPs are fully \nadopted from site selection to closure, and that required approvals are obtained from the \nauthorities.  Local  communities  and  other  stakeholders  were  consulted  during  project \npreparation, and consultations will continue throughout implementation as required. NWSDB \nand ADB will monitor contractors\u2019 environmental compliance with support from the supervision \nconsultant\u2019s team, which includes an environmental specialist. Any updates to EMPs, if required, \nwill be made by the consultant environment specialist and reviewed and approved by NWSDB \nand ADB. Semiannual environmental reports will be submitted to ADB for disclosure on the ADB \nwebsite in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and its Public Communications \nPolicy (2011).  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan (see also table below). The end of the conflict in 2009 has eliminated \nmajor implementation risks. Although a key risk to the Vavuniya subproject was associated with \nthe provision of replacement land to compensate people economically or physically displaced, \nthe government has prioritized the identification and approval of alternative land. The project\u2019s \noverall risk is assessed as medium without mitigation measures and low with mitigation.34  \n \n                                                \n32 Four resettlement plans, one for each project town, have been prepared and disclosed. Land acquisition and \nresettlement plan implementation are under way. \n33 Training and coordination workshops will be organized with the contractors to agree modalities for implementing \nEMPs and necessary monitoring and reporting. \n34 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \n Government  delay  in  releasing  ADB will closely coordinate and review progress with the External \ncounterpart funds  Resources Department during quarterly portfolio review meetings \nInsufficient information disclosure  In compliance with ADB Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended \nduring procurement  from  time  to  time),  NWSDB  will  disclose  on  its  own  website \ninformation pertaining to procurement, including advertising for new \nbids  and  contract  awards.

ASSURANCES \n35.  In addition to the assurances set forth in the original loan agreement, the government \nand NWSDB have assured ADB that implementation of the overall project will conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan documents. \n \n36.  The government and NWSDB have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. The government and \nNWSDB  agree  that  no  contract  shall  be  awarded  for  Vavuniya  water  supply  civil  works, \nconstruction  equipment,  or  materials  until  ADB  has  received  written  certification  from  the \nborrower that alternative land has been allocated for resettlement and compensation has been \npaid to all identified affected parties in accordance with the resettlement plan. The government \nand NWSDB have assured ADB that any future cost overruns for the project will be borne by the \ngovernment and NWSDB. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n37.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR25,970,000 to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for \nthe additional financing for the Dry Zone Urban Water and Sanitation Project, from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of \n8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n26 November 2012 \n ", " \nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Design \nSummary  Summary  Performance Targets and Indicators with  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \n(Current  (Overall  Baselines  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nProject)  Project)  (Current Project)  (Overall Project)  (Overall Project)  (Overall Project) \nImpact  Improved  Reduction in regional disparities and improved  Same  Department of Census and  Assumptions \nImproved well-  welfare in the  well-being as measured by MDG development    Statistics reports  Macroeconomic \nbeing of urban  northern and  indicators and poverty and vulnerability    MDG reports  stability \npopulations in  northwestern  indexes  Reduced incidence of waterborne  National MOH, North  Political stability and \nSri Lanka\u2019s  dry zone  Reduced incidence of waterborne disease in  disease in urban areas (halved by  Western and Northern  peace \nnorthwestern  urban areas (halved by 2017)  2020)  province, and district  Inflation contained \ndry zone towns  Significant support for meeting MDG 7 targets    statistics on health and \nof Chilaw,  for environmental sustainability, reducing by  Same  hygiene \nMannar,  half the proportion of people without  Aid agency and NGO reports \nPuttalam, and  sustainable access to safe drinking water in  ADB country strategies and \nVavuniya   northwestern dry zone towns  program and their updates \nOutcome    By the end of the project in 2014:  By end of project (2016):    Assumptions \nImproved urban  Improved  200,000 people in the northwestern dry zone    United Nations Children\u2019s  All institutions, \nwater and  urban water  (and 420,000 by end of design life) with  Same  Fund reports on water  including local \nsanitation  and sanitation  access to 120 liters per capita per day of 24-   supply, sanitation, and  governments, actively \nservice delivery  service  hour piped municipal water, with 120,000 new    hygiene  participating in the \nin Sri Lanka\u2019s  delivery in Sri  beneficiaries gaining access to water and    United Nations Environment  planning and \nnorthwestern  Lanka\u2019s  80,000 seeing significant improvement    Programme reports on the  development \ndry zone towns  northern and  100,000 people gaining access to improved    state of the environment   All central and \nof Chilaw,  northwestern  sanitation,  pit  desludging, septage handling,  Same  National CEA, Irrigation  provincial \nMannar,  dry zone  treatment, and disposal    Department, MOH, NWSDB,  government agencies \nPuttalam, and  towns   100% compliance with government and World    and WRB statistics, and  and communities fully \nVavuniya    Health  Organization  standards  for  water  Same  Northern and North Western  committed to water \n    distribution  or  effluent  discharge  in  project    provincial statistics, on water  resource \n    areas    supply and sanitation  management \nImproved regional efficiency and management  Same  ADB project completion  Risk \ncapacity as measured by regional offices\u2019    report and project audit  The lack of a formal \noperation and financial performance indicators    report  national policy or act \nagreed in the NWSDB corporate plan: NRW,    Baseline and completion  on water resource \nfinancial, water resource management,  survey data from provincial  management and \ncoordination, the planning ability of northern  councils\u2019 coordination  conflicting institutional \nand northwestern provincial councils, and their  committee minutes  mandates limiting \nA\nstrengthened human resources    initiatives\u2019 efficacy  p\nOutputs    By the end of 2013:  By the end of 2016:    Assumptions  pe\nn\n1.
