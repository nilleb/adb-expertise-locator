The  Project  will  be \nimplemented under a sector approach. \n \nEquitable economic growth and improvement in social and health \nindicators  depend  on  maintaining \nthe  rural  economy.  The \ndamaged  transport  network  is  a  constraint  to  the  movement  of \npeople  and  goods,  a  disincentive  to  productive  rural  activity,  and \nan  impediment  to  the  recovery  and  growth  of  tourism.  Better \ntransport infrastructure and services, which would restore access \nto domestic and international markets for agricultural products, are \nnecessary  to  rehabilitate  rural  economies  in  the  affected  areas. \nRestoring rural accessibility will reduce poverty. \n \nThe impact will be reduced economic losses and social disruption \nfrom  extreme  weather  in  the  future.  The  outcome  will  be  the \nrestoration  of  economic  and  social  activities  in  affected  areas  to \npre-disaster  levels.  The  rehabilitation  of  damaged  roads  is \nexpected  to  restore  accessibility  to  rural  areas  and  allow  a  full \nresumption of economic activities and social services.

The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nOverview \n\n2. \nThe Fiji Islands experienced continuous and heavy rain from 8 to 15 January 2009 that \nincluded periods of exceptional intensity. Flash flooding affected many areas of the Fiji Islands, \nparticularly  the  northwest  of  the  main  island  of  Viti  Levu.  Areas  severely  affected  were  the \nSigatoka  valley,  Nadi  town  and  surrounding  areas,  Ba,  Rakiraki,  Nausori,  Taileveu  North,  and \nparts of Vanua Levu. The extent and depth of flooding in Nadi and Ba was the worst since 1931. \nAbout  150,000  people  (roughly  one-sixth  of  the  population)  were  affected  directly  or  indirectly \nthrough  disruption  of  communications  and  access  to  food  and  clean  water.  Affected  areas \nsuffered damage to roads, schools, medical facilities, water and sanitation facilities, and crops. \nCommercial enterprises were particularly badly hit in Nadi and Ba, the former being the gateway \nfor  tourism  in  the  Fiji  Islands.  Tourism  growth,  already  under  pressure  because  of  the  global \nfinancial and economic crises, is expected to be impeded. Similarly, damage to sugarcane will \nreduce the quantity of sugar for export, further constraining the economy. \n \n3. \nAn emergency response by the Government and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) \n(with  widespread  support  from  the  international  community)  provided  short-term  food  and \nshelter  to  more  than  11,000  people.  While  many  houses  suffered  flood  damage,  few  were \ndestroyed.  Most  people  were  able  to  return  to  their  homes  once  the  floods  had  abated. \nHowever,  subsistence and  market  crops  were extensively  damaged  and  longer-term  provision \nof food rations was needed, particularly in the rural areas where reliance on root crops for daily \nneeds  was  high.  Hardship  in  the  rural  areas  was  compounded  by  damage  to  rural  roads, \nrestricting access to markets and social services. The floods have had a disproportionate impact \nupon the poor and are exacerbating growth, poverty and social indicators in Fiji. \n \n4. \nThe  Government  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  which  has  long \nexperience  and  ongoing  projects  in  the  infrastructure  sector  in  the  Fiji  Islands,  to  prepare  an \nemergency  assistance  project  for  reconstruction  of  damaged  roads,  bridges,  water  systems, \nand other public infrastructure.  \n \nB. \n\nDamage and Impact Assessment \n\nThe  Government  published  its  Consolidated  Report  on  Flash  Floods1  on  17  February \n5. \n2009,  about  4  weeks  after  the  disaster.  The  report  brought  together  the  damage  and  loss \nassessments of all Government agencies. The report estimated rehabilitation and reconstruction \ncosts for public infrastructure (and including assets belonging to the Fiji Electricity Authority, Fiji \nTelecom,  and  the  Fiji  Sugar  Corporation)  to  be  about  $41  million.  Damage  and  consequential \nlosses were not separately estimated in the report, though needs of $36 million were identified \nfor  consideration  by  development  partners.  Of  this  amount,  $9  million  is  for  proposed  river \ndredging  work,  which  is  longer-term  development,  rather  than  a  requirement  for  emergency \nrehabilitation  of  essential  infrastructure.  The  assessment  did  not  include  private  sector  losses. \n\n                                                 \n1  Office of the Prime Minister. 2009. Consolidated Report on Flash Floods. 8\u201316 January 2009. Suva. \n\n\f2 \n\nBusiness losses in the commercial centers were considerable with shops submerged for several \ndays.  The  economic  cost,  public  and  private,  of  the  flooding  is  estimated  to  be  about  $180 \nmillion\u2014equivalent  to  5.3%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP). 2   The  damage  to  essential \ninfrastructure  and  to  productive  sectors  such  as  tourism,  and  sugar  and  other  crops  was \nsubstantial. \n \n6. \nThe  extra  demands  on  the  budget  over  the  rest  of  the  year  could  result  in  a  budget \ndeficit  for  2009  exceeding  4%  of  GDP,  above  the  projected  deficit  of  3%  of  GDP.  General \ngovernment  debt  as  a  ratio  to  GDP,  which  was  48%  at  the  end  of  2008,  down  from  50.3%  in \n2007, could reach or surpass 2007 levels. \n \nC. \n\nImpact on Specific Sectors \n\n1. \n\nInfrastructure \n\n7. \nRoads. The estimated cost of repairing damage to the national road infrastructure is $16 \nmillion.  Secondary  and  rural  roads  suffered  damage  to  many  culverts,  stream  and  river \ncrossings, because of flood flows well in excess of the designed capacity. Drainage structures \nwere  scoured,  the  road  embankments  were  washed  away.  Numerous  landslides  occurred, \nblocking  roads  and  access  to  rural  communities.  Gravel  running  surfaces  were  also  washed \naway,  rendering  additional  sections  of  road  impassable.  Major  bridges  escaped  serious \ndamage,  though  some  road  approaches  were  washed  away.  Major  highways  also  suffered \nsome  damage  from  landslides,  and  also  from  loss  of  the  bitumen  sealed  surface  and \nconsequent damage to the road base. Estimates of damage are based on restoring damaged \nroads to good condition. However, poor maintenance and inadequate original construction have \ncontributed to the extent of the damage. \n \n8. \nWater  and  Sanitation. Water supplies to the main towns in the western division (Nadi, \nBa,  and  Sigatoka)  were  severely  disrupted  by  damage  to  intake  facilities  and  transmission \npipelines cut by washouts. Rural water supply systems were also damaged. Sewerage systems \nwere  similarly  disrupted  with  major  damage  to  pipelines  occurring  in  Sigatoka  because  of  the \ncollapse of the sugar tramway bridge carrying the pipeline from the town to the treatment plant. \nPreliminary estimates (footnote 1) put the cost of repairs at $6.4 million including for the cost of \ndelivering water to consumers by tanker, pending emergency repairs to the pipelines. However, \nthese  costs  were  found  on  review  to  be  overstated,  even  though  the  impact  of  disrupted \nservices was severe. \n \n9. \nUtilities.  Power  supply  disruptions  were  extensive  across  all  three  flood-affected \ndivisions.  The  Government  estimates  the  repair  costs  for  damage  to  the  power  network  and \nsubstations  at  $1.4  million.  Telecommunications  infrastructure  suffered  damage  estimated  at \n$0.6 million. \n \n\nTransport.  Airports  were  closed  during  the  rainfall  and  flooding,  affecting  international \n\n10. \nand domestic routes. However, the airport infrastructure did not suffer any damage. \n\n                                                 \n2  International  Monetary  Fund.  2009.  Use  of  Fund  Resources  \u2013  Request  for  Emergency  Assistance.  Washington \n\n(March) (Draft). \n\n \n\n\f2. \n\nCommerce Sector \n\n11. \nTourism. The industry incurred losses because of the early departure of tourists in the \ncountry at the time of the flooding and a reduction in tourist arrivals in the aftermath. Losses are \nlikely  to  have  continued  in  the  ensuing  period  because  of  the  extensive  publicity  given  to  the \nfloods  overseas.  Estimated  losses  in  tourism  alone  because  of  the  decline  in  arrivals  are  $40 \nmillion (annual earnings from tourism in 2008 was an estimated $437 million). This decline has \nalso affected tourism operators, restaurants, shops, and their suppliers. There was little impact \non hotel infrastructure. \n \n12. \nBusiness.  The Nadi Chamber of Commerce has estimated losses to local business of \nup  to  $93  million.  Only  the  largest  businesses  have  flood  insurance.  This  protection  is  not \navailable  to  middle  and  small  businesses,  which  have  suffered  substantial  trade  and  stock \nlosses. Many have lacked the capacity to restock, and have closed down or are looking at doing \nso  as  their  stock  depletes  or  leases  expire.  Many  have  ceased  paying  rent  since  the  flood, \neither with or without the concurrence of the landlord. \n \n13.  Market  vendors  and  hawkers  suffered  substantial  economic  losses  because  of  their \ninability to trade for the duration of the flood and the subsequent cleanup stage (about 3 weeks), \nin addition to the loss of produce and goods, and difficulties in sourcing new stock. \n \n\n3. \n\nAgriculture Sector \n\n14. \nSugar.  The  sugar  industry  suffered  damage  to  crops,  mill  infrastructure,  and  tram  and \nroad infrastructure, as well as loss of soil nutrients. The preliminary estimate of loss to the cane \ncrop is 69,000 tons (annual production is about 2.8 million tons) valued at $6.2 million. The loss \nwill result from the destruction of standing cane washed away by torrents, but also because of \nlower  sugar  content  as  a  consequence  of  prolonged  inundation.  Damage  was  also  caused  to \nsugar-related  infrastructure,  including  access  roads,  railways,  and  associated  bridges.  In \nSigatoka,  a  major  bridge  dedicated  to  carrying  a  sugarcane  tramway  was  destroyed.  With  a \nreplacement  cost  of  $4.0  million,  and  declining  cane  production  from  the  areas  served,  the \nbridge will not be replaced and future cane harvest will be transported to the mill by road. The \nRarawai sugar mill in Ba, inundated by more than 3 meters of water over several days, suffered \nsignificant  damage.  The  cost  of  repairing  damage  to  this  and  other  sugar  infrastructure  is \nestimated to be $4.7 million. \n \nOther Crops. Root crop staples such as cassava, taro, and sweet potato are intolerant \n15. \nto  flooding  and  were  badly  damaged  in  flooded  and  poorly  drained  areas.  This  led  to  food \nshortages in the villages, and scarcity and high prices in the markets for 3 months following the \nfloods. Nascent export crops, particularly pawpaw, suffered considerable damage with several \nplantations  being  totally  destroyed.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Primary  Industries  (MAPI) \nassessed  losses  to  crops  other  than  sugar  to  be  $4.2  million. 3  Of  this  amount,  $3.4  million \ncomprised  losses  to  crops  intended  for  export.  About  2,900  hectares  of  crops  were  seriously \ndamaged  in  the  Western  and  Central  divisions,  and  the  livelihoods  of  about  23,000  farmers \nwere affected, either through crop loss or loss of access to markets. \n \n\n                                                 \n3  Ministry of Agriculture and Primary Industries and Primary Industries. 2009.

Additional  costs  were  associated  with  the  vector  control  measures  taken  to \naddress the immediate public health risks associated with the damage to water and sanitation \ninfrastructure. Some health facilities incurred minor damage estimated at $0.4 million. \n \n19. \nEducation.  Floods  affected  22%  of  all  primary  schools  and  32%  of  all  secondary \nschools, covering 19,000 students. Classroom blocks, dormitories, dining halls, school gardens, \nfurniture, books, and teaching equipment and materials were damaged. Physical damage was \nestimated  at  $0.8  million.  Many  schools  were  used  as  evacuation  centers  during  the  flooding \nand in the immediate aftermath. The start of the school year was postponed by 1 week. \n \nD. \n\nSocial Impact and Effects on Poverty \n\n1. \n\nSocial Impacts \n\nFloods directly affected more than 146,000 people in the Western and Central divisions, \n\n20. \nand about 90,000 people in Northern Division. \n \n21. \ndrowned, two people died in landslides, and one person died at an evacuation center. \n\nLoss  of  Life.  Twelve  people  lost  their  lives  as  a  result  of  the  floods.  Nine  people \n\n22. \nDisplacement.  One  of  the  major  social  impacts  was  displacement.  For  most  affected \npeople, the displacement was temporary. Evacuation centers were established for the duration \nof the flood. Evacuations started on 11 January 2009. At the peak of the flood on 16 January, \n11,458  people  had  been  evacuated  to  169  evacuation  centers.  By  23  January,  the  number  of \nevacuees had declined to 1,191 in 27 centers. When another flood peak hit Central Division on \n30 January, an additional center was opened to 101 new evacuees. These numbers are likely to \nbe a significant underestimate of the actual number of people who had to flee their homes as \nmany took refuge with family or friends. \n\nHousing.  Floods  destroyed  164  houses  and  partly  damaged  1,677  other  houses  in \n\n23. \nWestern Division. The total value of housing loss and damage is estimated at $0.9 million. \n\n24. \nEconomic  Loss.  The  loss  of  household  items  and  personal  belongings,  clothes,  and \nrecords  and  documents  was  significant.  Many  lost  all  they  had.  Food  gardens  were  washed \naway, resulting in immediate hardship for households relying on their own produce for their food \nsupply, and in economic loss for those relying the sale of surplus produce. The immediate rise \nin price for basic foods had an impact not only on people in the flood-affected areas but across \nthe Fiji Islands. \n\nQuality  of  Life.  In  the  immediate  aftermath  and  in  the  longer-term  recovery  phase \n25. \npeople  experienced  life  with  no  water  or  interrupted  water  supply,  and  poor  sanitation, \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fImpassable  and  damaged  roads  made  access  to  markets  and  services  difficult.  All  who \nexperienced the floods suffered some degree of stress. \n\n2. \n\nImpact on Poverty \n\n26. \nPoverty  has  been  increasing  gradually  in  the  Fiji  Islands  since  1990  across  all \nhouseholds,  both  Fijian  and  Indian,  and  in  urban  and  rural  areas.4  The  average  incidence  of \nbasic needs poverty for all households was estimated at 29.7% in 2006, up from 25% in 1990; \nand  for  the  population  at  34.4%  in  2006,  up  from  25.5%  in  1990.  Urban  poverty  is  greater  in \nhouseholds  living  in  settlement  and  Housing  Authority  areas,  where  36%  of  people  live  below \nthe  poverty  line.  In  rural  areas,  38%  of  people  are  estimated  to  live  in  poverty.  Thus,  it  is \nreasonable  to  assume  that  at  least  one-third  of  the  236,000  people  directly  affected  by  the \nfloods were living in poverty and would have had little or no capacity to withstand the shock. \n\n27. \nThe  floods  have  worsened  the  situation  of  those  already  living  below  the  poverty  line. \nThe floods have also likely increased the vulnerability to poverty for those previously above the \npoverty  line.  Food  price  increases  after  the  flood  would  have  had  the  biggest  impact  on  the \npoor, who are most likely to rely on subsistence gardens for their own consumption. About 54% \nof low-income Fijian families provide a substantial proportion (more than 40%) of their own food. \nDuring the flood and immediate afterward, those directly affected by the flood were not able to \nengage in any economic activity for some weeks. \n\nE. \n\nMacroeconomic Impact \n\nAs  the  economic  impact  of  the  floods  is  concurrent  with  the  impact  of  the  global \n28. \ndownturn, separation of the effects is difficult, particularly for tourism. However, the International \nMonetary  Fund,  in  its  assessment  for  the  purpose  of  considering  a  request  for  Emergency \nAssistance  for  National  Disasters  (ENDA),  has  assessed  the  economic  cost  of  the  flooding, \npublic  and  private,  to  be  around  $180  million  (5.3%  of  GDP).  The  direct  impact  on  foreign \nexchange  revenue  includes  losses  in  sugar  exports  and  tourism  receipts  plus  additional  food \nimports  to  meet  food  shortages.  In  addition,  stock  losses  and  damaged  infrastructure  will  be \nreplaced, further increasing import costs. \n\n29. \nThe  fiscal  impact  of  the  floods  is  expected  to  be  mostly  in  the  form  of  additional \nexpenditure  on  relief  and  reconstruction.  This  will  be  realized  mainly  by  reorienting  spending, \nbut some revenue will be lost. To finance the extra spending, the authorities have re-prioritized \nexpenditures as much as possible from within the existing budget, including deferring salary and \nwage  increases  and  using  part  of  the  2009  capital  expenditure  budget.  Because  of  slower \ngrowth,  especially  in  the  tourist  industry,  tax  revenues  are  expected  to  decline  relative  to  the \nbudget estimates. Therefore, the overall budget deficit is likely to be slightly above 4% of GDP, \nwhich is higher than projected in the 2009 budget, provided that appropriate actions are taken to \nlimit the negative effects.  \n\nF. \n\nGovernment's Response \n\n30. \nThe  response  and  relief  phases  were  generally  well  managed  through  the  National \nDisaster Management Office. Warnings issued by the Nadi Meteorological Office on 7 January \n2009  triggered  activation  of  the  national  Emergency  Operations  Centre  and  divisional \noperations  centers.  A  state  of  natural  disaster  was  declared  on  11  January  2009,  when  it \n                                                 \n4  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 2006. Estimation of Basic Needs Poverty Lines and Incidence of \n\nPoverty in Fiji. Suva. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fbecame apparent that widespread damage was occurring as a result of the continuous rain, and \nthat  local  authorities  could  not  respond  effectively  because  of  disruption  of  access  and \ncommunications. To safeguard properties, 12-hour curfews were imposed in Sigatoka, Ba, and \nNadi  townships.  The  operations  centers  coordinated  the  establishment  of  evacuation  centers, \nsearch and rescue operations, supply of emergency rations, and subsequently the orderly return \nof evacuees to their homes. \n \n31. \nA  national  task  force  was  established  under  the  chairmanship  of  the  permanent \nsecretary of provincial development. It was responsible for obtaining and assessing information, \nand  coordinating  the  response.  Members  of  the  task  force  included  representatives  of  all \nrelevant  government  agencies  and  civil  society.  The  division  commissioners  undertook  field \nassessments to provide the detailed information needed for managing the immediate response \nand to start planning for rehabilitation. \n \n32. \nFood rations were distributed in two phases. The first phase, which began on 8 January \n2009,  provided  food  to  persons  gathering  in  the  evacuation  centers  and  continued  until  22 \nJanuary 2009. The second phase started on 23 January 2009 and provided targeted assistance \nto  flood-affected  persons,  including  small-scale  subsistence  farmers  who  had  lost  their  crops. \nRation  packs,  based  on  family  size,  included  rice,  flour,  dhal,  milk,  sugar,  cooking  oil,  and \ncanned  fish.  The  cost  of  the  distribution  program  was  estimated  to  be  $3.3  million  per  month. \nNumerous  NGOs  provided  considerable  assistance  in  distributing  food  and  clothing.  The \nGovernment's distribution program is planned to continue for up to 3 months. \n \n33. \nThe  Government,  through  the  Ministry  of  Works,  Transport  and  Public  Utilities \n(MWTPU),  began  repairs  to  transport  and  water  and  sanitation  infrastructure  as  soon  as \nconditions  permitted.  Considerable  effort  was  expended  to  remove  landslides  blocking  roads, \nrepair washed out road sections, and restore safe but basic access. On the main sealed road \nnetwork,  particularly  in  and  around  Nadi,  resources  were  diverted  from  an  ongoing  road \nrehabilitation  contract  to  repair  washed  out  and  heavily  potholed  sections  of  sealed  road  to \npromote  rapid  recovery  of  the  town  and  its  function  as  a  tourist  center.  Water  was  taken  by \nwater  tanker  to  areas  with  disrupted  supplies,  and  a  system  of  communal  water  tanks  was \nestablished to provide potable water. Simultaneously, access roads to reservoirs and pumping \nstations  were  reopened  and  repairs  made  to  washed  out  pipelines  where  possible.  However, \nthe majority of the repairs only restored the service, and additional work will be required in most \ncases to effect permanent repairs. \n \n34.  MAPI  embarked  upon  an  immediate  program  of  distributing  planting  materials  and \nseeds. This program seems to have been remarkably successful; the area of land under crops \nafter  the  floods  now  exceeds  that  in  place  before.  A  factor  may  be  that  the  supply  of  planting \nmaterials was free, stimulating greater interest in \"backyard\" farming in the urban areas as well \nas by those normally engaged in farming. The latter group generally would be totally reliant on \nsales of vegetables for cash income and compelled to use their best efforts to normalize their \nproduction.  Fortunately,  stocks  of  planting  materials  in  other  parts  of  the  country  escaped \ndamage.  As  part  of  its  future  preparedness  approach,  MAPI  will  maintain  stocks  at  diverse \nlocations,  maximizing  the  chances  that  a  successful  replanting  program  such  as  this  can  be \nrepeated.  MAPI  intends  to  continue  expanding  agricultural  production  for  export  and  for \nsubstitution  of  imports,  and  to  mitigate  risks  arising  from  natural  disasters  by  maximizing  the \ngeographical distribution of the production centers. Over reliance on particular locations such as \nthe Sigatoka valley is one of the lessons emerging from this disaster. \n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fG. \n\nDevelopment Partners' Response \n\n35. \nThe Government, development partners, regional governments, NGOs, and the private \nsector  provided  immediate  assistance  in  response  to  the  disaster.  Donations  in  cash  were \nchanneled  through  the  Prime  Minister's  Relief  Fund  (a  standing  account  maintained  on  a \npermanent  basis  to  receive  donations  for  emergency  relief),  the  Red  Cross,  United  Nations \nagencies, or directly to NGOs engaged in the emergency response. Donations in kind, including \nfood and nonfood items, water, water tanks, shelter, medical care, and logistics support, were \nalso  received.  About  $1.3  million  was  donated  to  the  Prime  Minister's  Fund  with  about  $2.7 \nmillion for direct assistance from the donor or through an NGO. \n \n36. \nThe  Government  of  Australia  and  the  European  Union  coordinated  closely  to  provide \nsupport  in  the  education  sector,  including  rehabilitation  of  66  schools.  The  European  Union \nresources  were  allocated  from  an  ongoing  project.  The  Government  of  New  Zealand  donated \nNZ$1  million  for  immediate  relief  and  is  considering  allocating  an  additional  $2  million  for \nmedium-term rehabilitation. Assistance by development partners and NGOs is in Appendix 2. \n \n37. \nUnder a collaborative response to the disaster, the World Bank will finance and manage \njointly identified and evaluated TA for Disaster Risk Management. The TA project will develop \nand  implement  strategic  management  of  flood  risks  with  a  long-term  integrated  perspective. \nSupport will be provided to promote an enabling environment for reforms, leading to policies on \nrisk  reduction  and  proactive  institutional  arrangements  within  an  integrated  flood  risk \nmanagement  framework.  Components  of  the  TA  will  include  (i)  flood  risk  assessment  and \nevaluation of risk reduction measures, (ii) strengthening of flood forecasting and early warning \nsystems, and (iii) institutional reform for flood management. \n \nH. \n\nADB's Response \n\nThe  Government  requested  an  emergency  assistance  loan  from  ADB  on  30  January \n38. \n2009.  Staff  from  the  ADB  South  Pacific  Subregional  Office  in  Suva  met  with  Government \nofficials and other development partners to prepare a coordinated response to the disaster. With \nits long-term involvement in transport, and water and sanitation infrastructure in the Fiji Islands, \nADB agreed to take the lead in preparing a project for the rehabilitation and repair of affected \ninfrastructure. \n \n39. \nADB  has  provided  assistance  to  the  land  transport  sector under  the  Second  and  Third \nRoad Upgrading (Sector) projects.5 ADB's assistance has included support for institutional and \npolicy  change  to  improve  efficiency,  governance,  and  accountability  within  the  land  transport \nagencies,  as  well  as  for  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  the  roads.  ADB  is  providing  technical \nassistance (TA) for the preparation of a land transport master plan, and undertaking preparatory \nwork  for  a  fourth  road  upgrading  project,  the  timing  of  which  will  be  subject  to  ADB's \nreengagement approach in the Fiji Islands. 6  \n \n40. \nADB's  approach  to  reengagement  with  Fiji  Islands  following  the  political  crisis  in  2006 \nhas two stages. In the first stage, ADB continued operations ongoing as of December 2006, as \nit  ascertained  that  the  interim  government  (i)  effectively  controlled  the  country,  (ii)  recognized \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1992.

Stage two of \nreengagement\u2014preparation  of  a  new  country  partnership  strategy  and  approval  of  new \noperations\u2014requires that five conditions prevail.7  Management considers these have yet to be \nmet in full. The emergency assistance loan will be provided on an exceptional basis. \n \n41. \nProcessing has been delayed beyond the 12 weeks normally required for an emergency \nloan  because  of  the  evolving  political  situation,  the  lack  of  a  current  ADB  country  strategy, \ngovernment  capacity  constraints,  and \nfor  extensive  consultations  with  key \nthe  need \ndevelopment  partners.  Development  of  an  interim  operational  strategy  was  commenced  in \nparallel with processing of the loan. However its preparation has been similarly delayed by the \nneed  for  further  consultations  with  development  partners  and  delays  in  the  International \nMonetary Fund's Article IV mission until October 2009. Waiver of the requirement for an interim \noperational  strategy  as  part  of  the  processing  of  an  emergency  assistance 8   loan  is  being \nsought. \n \n42. \nADB undertook a detailed review of the Government's damage and needs assessment \n(footnote  1)  jointly  with  the  World  Bank  with  a  view  to  a  collaborative  response  and  with \nemphasis on verification of the priority needs and the cost of restoring infrastructure during the \nrecovery phase. As the emerging needs for infrastructure were relatively modest, it was agreed \nthat the World Bank would focus on needs for TA with disaster risk management being identified \nas a priority. A detailed review of the Government's expenditures associated with infrastructure \nrecovery during the transition phase was also carried out. \n \nI. \n\nLessons for Disaster Management \n\n43. \nThe National Disaster Management Office facilitated a number of debriefing meetings at \nthe  district  level  and  national  level,  and  with  development  partners  and  NGOs.  Identified \ndeficiencies in the emergency response were: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nCoordination  between  the  Government  and  NGOs.  Some  NGOs  worked \nalone and on their own priorities, resulting in some duplication of the relief effort. \nCloser cooperation for disaster planning is required to ensure better coordination. \nCoordination with the private sector. The private sector provided considerable \nsupport  during  the  emergency  response,  including  for  the  delivery  of  drinking \nwater  and  transportation  of  relief  assistance.  However,  delays  were  incurred \nwhile arrangements were made. A plan should be developed with private sector \ndonors to ensure more rapid mobilization of resources. \nTargeting of relief for affected persons. Current arrangements do not allow for \ndistribution  of  Government-funded  relief  supplies  to  squatters,  who  are  among \nthe most vulnerable after natural disasters. Procedures for assisting such people \nneed to be reviewed. \nFinancial  assistance  for  affected  persons.  Many  small  and  medium-sized \nbusinesses  suffered  losses  because  of  the  floods.  Many  people  needed  short-\n\n                                                 \n7   The conditions are: (i) whether a new loan would expose ADB to additional legal or political risks, (ii) whether the \nde  facto  government  is  in  effective  control  of  the  country  and  enjoys  a  reasonable  degree  of  stability  and  public \nacceptance,  (iii)  whether  the  de  facto  government  generally  recognizes  the  country's  existing  international \nobligations, (iv) the number of countries (particularly ADB member countries and neighboring countries) that have \nrecognized the de facto government or dealt with it as the government of the country, and (v) the attitude of other \ninternational organizations towards the de facto government. \n8   ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Manila. \n\n\f(v) \n\nterm  financial  assistance  to  replace  damaged  stock,  replant  crops,  pay  school \nfees,  etc.  Local  financial  institutions,  including  the  Fiji  National  Provident  Fund, \nthe  Fiji  Development  Bank,  the  Housing  Authority,  and  the  commercial  banks, \nneed  to  develop  policies  and  guidelines  for  small-scale  emergency  assistance \nloans to individuals to be prepared for such disasters. \nRisk-based  approach  for  integrated  water  resource  management.  Damage \nto  property  could  be  reduced  through  an  integrated  approach  to  disaster  risk \nmanagement. The South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission estimated the \naverage annual loss in the Fiji Islands from 1975 to 2005 was $11 million. A risk-\nbased  approach  to  disaster  management  is  needed  to  supplement  the  current \nreactive approach. \n\n \nJ. \n\nRationale for the Project \n\n44. \nEquitable economic growth and improvement in social and health indicators depend on \nmaintaining the rural economy\u2014a need made more urgent by the disaster. The damage to the \ntransport  network  constrains  the  movement  of  people  and  goods.  It  is  a  disincentive  to \nproductive rural activity, and an impediment to the recovery and growth of tourism. While basic \naccess  has  been  restored,  the  disaster  has  degraded  the  infrastructure,  rendering  it  more \nvulnerable to repeated damage (along with the accompanying economic and social dislocation) \nfrom less severe weather events. Better transportation infrastructure and services, which would \nrestore access to domestic and international markets for agricultural products, are essential to \nrehabilitating  rural  economies  in  the  affected  areas.  Therefore,  the  focus  on  restoring  rural \naccessibility will reduce poverty. \n \n45. \nThe disaster is also evidence of increased vulnerability to changes in climatic conditions. \nClimate  change  is  expected  to  increase  extreme  weather,  and  to  cause  the  sea  level  to  rise. \nRoads,  bridges,  and  wharves  require  better  environmental  protection  and  higher  construction \nstandards to withstand potential future natural events. The Project will be designed to withstand \nthe increased likelihood of such effects within the expected life of rehabilitated infrastructure. An \nADB publication describes methodology for incorporation of climate proofing and \"building back \nbetter,\" and this will be followed to the extent feasible. 9\n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nConsistent with  its  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  (2004),  ADB\u2019s  response \n46. \nto  the  floods  will  focus  on  the  short-term  rehabilitation  of  the  damaged  infrastructure.  It  will \nincorporate flexible  implementation  provisions  to  allow  ADB  to  respond  effectively  to  changing \nconditions, and it will support activities that anticipate and mitigate the impacts of future floods. \nThe  recommended  package  for  emergency  assistance  comprises  an  emergency  assistance \nloan to the Fiji Islands to meet the entire cost of rehabilitating road infrastructure and agricultural \ndrainage schemes, and to contribute to the cost of rehabilitating water supply systems. \n \nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n47. \nThe impact will be reduced economic losses and social disruption from extreme weather \nin  the  future.  The  outcome  will  be  the  restoration  of  economic  and  social  activities  in  affected \nareas  to  pre-disaster  levels.  The  rehabilitation  of  damaged  roads  is  expected  to  restore \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2005. Climate Proofing: A Risk Based Approach to Adaptation.

The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1.  \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n48. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  using  a  sector  approach.  Each  subproject  will  be \nprioritized and selected in accordance with the process and eligibility criteria in Appendix 3.  A \nsystematic  and  consultative  approach  will  be  established  for  subproject  appraisal,  covering  (i) \nsocial,  economic,  and  environmental  evaluation; \n(iv) \nimplementation;  and  (v)  monitoring.  Each  subproject  feasibility  study  will  provide  sufficient \nevidence of its eligibility under the agreed criteria, and will be in the detail and quality required to \nenable  ADB  to  assess  the  viability  and  suitability  of  the  subproject.  Implementation  will \nincorporate HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention and general health and safety activities. \n \n49. \nComponent A: Repairs in the Emergency Response Phase. The Project will finance \neligible  expenditures  incurred  during  the  immediate  post-disaster  period  to  restore  basic,  safe \naccess.  Activities  included  clearing  of  landslides  and  debris,  reinstatement  of  washed-out \napproaches to bridges and wet crossings, and temporary road pavement repairs.  \n\n(iii)  procurement; \n\n(ii)  design; \n\nComponent B: Civil Works. The Project will finance the following civil works: \n(i) \n\nrehabilitation  of  about  8  kilometers  (km)  of  main  sealed  highway,  restoring  the \nbituminous sealed surface and including upgrading of the pavement structure as \nrequired for a design life of 20 years; \nrepairs  to  landslips  on  major  roads,  incorporating  appropriate  geotechnical \ninvestigation and design recommendations; \nrehabilitation  of  secondary  roads,  including  re-gravelling  of  about  50  km  of \nunsealed roads, reconstruction of 30 culverts, and reconstruction or lengthening \nof washed-out wet crossings.  \n\n(iii) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iv)  miscellaneous repairs to water supplies; and \n(v) \n\nrepairs  to  agricultural  drainage  schemes:  MAPI's  Land  and  Water  Resource \nManagement Division (LWRM) has prepared a detailed plan for rehabilitation of \nflood-damaged  drainage  schemes  in  all  three  divisions  (Western,  Central,  and \nNorthern);  and  works  will  be  undertaken  to  (a)  clear  waterways,  (b)  repair \ndamaged seawalls and dykes, (c) repair and protect scoured drains and culverts, \nand (d) repair floodgates (Supplementary Appendix A). \n\n \n51. \nComponent  C:  Consulting  Services.  The  Project  will  finance  consulting  services  for  \nProject  coordination,  design  and  supervision  of  implementation,  and  for  strengthening  the \nEnvironmental Management Unit (EMU) of the MWTPU. Recent emergency assistance loans in \nthe  Pacific  have  suffered  long  delays  in  disbursement  of  funds  due  in  large  part  to  capacity \nconstraints  in  design,  contracting,  and  supervision.  Rapid  disbursement  is  only  possible  if \ndesign and supervision are effectively carried out in a timely  manner.  Contracting expertise to \nensure this happens is a sound investment. \n \n52. \nDesigns  will  enhance  resilience  against  extreme  weather  by  incorporating  appropriate \nclimate  proofing  measures,  including  large  critical  drainage  structures  and  providing  scour \nprotection for bridges and wet crossings. A \"build back better\" approach will be adopted that will \nensure appropriate engineering design standards are met as a minimum requirement, and the \nopportunity will be taken to provide significantly more robust replacement structures.  \n \n\n10 \n\n \n50. \n\n \n\n\fC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n53. \nThe Project has no special features. It is specifically designed to be uncomplicated and \nflexible  to  allow  speedy  execution.  This  need  is  a  lesson  emerging  from  recent  emergency \nassistance projects in the Pacific, where major delays in implementation have largely negated \nthe rationale for an emergency assistance response.  \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n54. \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $19.99  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of  $4.50 \nmillion. The costs of the components are summarized in Table 1. A detailed cost estimate is in \nAppendix 4. \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \n\n \n\nBase Costb\n1.

Country cost-sharing and financing parameters have \nbeen  approved  in  July  2009.  ADB  may  finance  up  to  99%  of  the  project  cost  with  higher \npercentages  being  provided \nfor  non-income-earning  projects  with  strong  evidence  of \ncommitment  and  that  address  binding  constraints  to  growth  and  development.    Consideration \nhas  been  given  to  the  amount  of  taxes  and  duties,  and  these  do  not  constitute  an  excessive \nshare of project costs.  \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nThe EA for the Project will be the Ministry of National Planning (MNP). The MNP will be \n57. \nsupported by a Project Coordinator financed by the ADB loan. The Project will be implemented \nby  the  MWTPU  for  the  roads  and  water  supply  components  and  by  the  LWRM  for  the \nagricultural drainage scheme rehabilitation components. As the EA, MNP, will be responsible for \nthe overall execution of the Project and will coordinate with the MWTPU and LWRM. A project \nsteering committee will be established, comprising representatives from the MNP, the Ministry \nof Finance, the permanent secretary for MWTPU, the divisional commissioners, the director of \nthe  LWRM,  the  director  of  national  roads,  the  director  of  water  supply,  and  the  divisional \nengineers (as required). The steering committee will oversee and monitor all aspects of project \nimplementation  including  (i)  policy  guidance  and  coordination,  (ii)  subproject  selection,  (iii) \nproject  progress  reports  and  other  project  documentation,  and  (iv)  audited  accounts  and \nfinancial statements. \n \n58. \nA project management team (PMT), housed within MWTPU will be responsible for day to \nday  implementation  and  will  coordinate  the  Project  related  activities  of  both  the  MWTPU  and \nLWRM,  and  report  to  the  EA  accordingly.  The  PMT  will  be  headed  by  the  director  of  national \nroads. The PMT will (i) conduct subproject assessments, design, and supervision; (ii) manage \ntendering  processes;  (iii)  manage  contracts;  (iv)  prepare  withdrawal  applications;  (v)  prepare \nproject  progress  reports  and  a  project  completion  report;  (vi)  maintain  project  accounts  for \nauditing;  (vii)  monitor  the  Project\u2019s  socioeconomic  and  environmental  impacts;  and  (viii) \ncomplete  related  project  management  activities,  as  necessary  to  implement  the  Project \nsuccessfully  and  comply  with  ADB  policies  and  guidelines.  The  PMT  will  be  supported  by \nconsultants that will be financed from the loan. \n \nA  project  procurement  audit 10  of  MWPTU  in  connection  with  its  administration  of  the \n59. \nongoing  Third  Road  Upgrading  (Sector)  Project  found  critical  deficiencies  in  documenting \nproject  expenditures,  particularly  for  force  account  works.  The  audit  report  urged  MWTPU  to \nstrengthen the project management unit for future ADB project administration and management. \n\n                                                 \n10 Office of the Auditor General, ADB. 2006. 2006 Annual Report: Appendix 4: Project Procurement-Related Audit for   \n\nLoan 1530-FIJ: Third Road Upgrading Sector Project. Manila. \n\n\fImprovements  were  made  after  the  audit,  including  the  establishment  of  separate  financial \nrecords  for  the  Project.  The  improvements  were  verified  during  project  review  missions,  and \ninformally  during  an  audit  of  ADB  South  Pacific  Subregional  Office. 11   A  qualified  project \naccountant, financed by the ADB loan will support the financial management of the Project.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n60. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  24  months.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  under \nadvance  procurement.  Services  for  feasibility  studies,  detailed  design, and  bidding  documents \nwill  be  procured  by  September  2009.  Services  for  project  management  and  construction \nsupervision will be procured by November 2009. Preparatory activities for all works (excluding \nrepairs  to  landslips)  will  be  completed  by  November  2009,  and  initial  contract  awards  will  be \nmade in December 2009. Rehabilitation activities will be physically completed by August 2011. \nThe  loan  is  scheduled  to  close  by  29  February  2012.  The  implementation  schedule  is  in \nAppendix 5. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n61. \nStandard  ADB  operational  policies,  including  those  on  procurement  and  consulting \nservices,  financial  management,  and  disbursement,  should  be  liberally  interpreted  to  ensure \nspeedy and effective rehabilitation.12 This will include relaxing international competitive bidding \n(ICB) requirements to avail of faster project preparation and procurement procedures applicable \nto  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB).  Procurement  under  the  Project,  including  packages \nfinanced  by  ADB  and  the  Government,  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). Civil works will be divided into packages to be procured using ICB, \nNCB, or shopping procedures as appropriate. The civil works contracts to be procured consist of \na series of low-value works (less than $2 million). These contracts will be of limited interest to \nforeign contractors and suppliers, and local production and construction facilities are available, \noffering prices below the international market.13 These contracts will be procured by NCB. ICB \nmay be used for procuring rehabilitation of the main sealed highway and for landslide repairs if \nthe estimated value (after detailed design) of these packages exceeds $2 million. Procurement \nwill use ADB's standard bidding documents. Shopping will be used for procuring low-value (less \nthan $100,000), readily available, off-the-shelf goods, or simple civil works of low value. The first \ndraft version of the NCB procurement documents will be submitted to ADB for review to ensure \nconsistency  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Draft  bidding  documents  for  ICB  will  be \nsubject  to  prior  review  by  ADB.  Technical  and  financial  qualifications  of  contractors  will  be \nreviewed in conjunction with the review of the bid proposals. Contractors may be awarded more \nthan one contract package based on the least-cost combination of contracts and the capacity of \nthe contractor. The procurement plan is in Appendix 6. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n62. \nAlthough  the  PMT  will  be  fully  integrated  with  MWTPU  and  LWRM  professional  and \ntechnical staff, the PMT needs to be supplemented with additional technical support because of \nthe  volume  and  schedule  of  existing  activities  and  both  agency's  limited  technical  staff \n                                                 \n11  A team from the Office of the Auditor General visited the EA on 9 June 2009 and reviewed records and record-   \nkeeping systems, and concluded that the recommendations of the 2006 audit had been satisfactorily implemented. \n12 ADB.  2004.  Operations  Manual.  OM  Section  D7/OP:  Operational  Procedures.  Disaster  and  Emergency  \n\nAssistance. Manila; and  ADB. 2006. Procurement Guidelines. Manila (para. 3.18). \n\n13 While not designed as a response to the global financial crisis, such local contracting will have a useful economic \n\nstimulus effect. \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\fresources.  Consulting  services  will  be  required  for  (i)  Project  coordination  and  support  for  the \nMNP,  (ii)  engineering  design  and  preparation  of  bidding  documents,  (iii)  construction \nsupervision,  and  (iii)  project  management  and  for  strengthening  MWTPU's  EMU.  The  Project \nwill fund about 42.5 person-months of international consulting services and 82 person-months of \nnational consulting services. The international consultants will include (i) a project manager (20 \nperson-months), (ii) a senior works inspector (15 person-months), (iii) a geotechnical specialist \n(4  person-months),  (iv)  a  drainage  and  wet-crossing  specialist  (3  person-months),  and  (v)  a \nfinancial management specialist (0.5 person months). The national consultants will comprise (i) \na  project  coordinator  (24  person-months),  (ii)  a  project  accountant  (18  person-months),  (iii)  a \nworks inspector (18 person-months), (iv) an environment specialist (18 person-months), and (v) \na  drafts  person  (4  person-months).  Consultants  for  design  and  supervision  services,  and  for \nenvironmental monitoring will be supervised by the director of national roads. The MWTPU will \nalso  provide  support  for  the  Project,  including  laboratory  and  field  testing  and  surveys  during \ndesign  and  construction.  The  consultants  will  train  MWTPU  and  LWRM  personnel  in \nconstruction  supervision,  and  the  trained  staff  will  assist  the  team  in  supervising  the  project \nworks.  \n \n63. \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007 as amended form time to time). For the first phase, a firm will be recruited to \nassist  with  the  preparation  of  the  subproject  proposals,  detailed  designs,  and  contract  bidding \ndocuments.  The  consultants  qualification  selection  method  will  be  used  because  recruitment \ntime  is  critical.  In  parallel,  a  firm  will  be  recruited  for  project  management  and  construction \nsupervision  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method,  and  a  biodata  technical \nproposal. Consultants recruited under the consultants qualification selection will be mobilized in \nSeptember  2009;  those  recruited  under  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  will  be \nmobilized in November 2009. A Project coordinator and a national environmental specialist will \nbe  recruited  under  the  individual  consultant  selection  method  and  will  be  mobilized  during  the \nfirst phase for the whole of the assignment. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 7. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Procurement \n\n64. \nPermanent  repairs  to  damaged  infrastructure  should  begin  as  soon  as  possible.  ADB \nhas approved advance action for the procurement of goods and services, and for recruitment of \nconsultants.  Advance  action  covers  invitation  of  bids,  bidding,  bid  evaluation,  and  contract \naward.  The  advance  action  will  be  reviewed  to  ensure  that  it  conforms  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines,  and  social  and  environmental  safeguards.  In  particular,  LWRM  has  initiated \nprocurement of 10 contracts for emergency repairs to agricultural drainage schemes ranging in \nestimated cost from $15,000 to $400,000. The Government has been advised that approval of \nthe advance action does not commit ADB to provide financing for the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nRetroactive Financing \n\n65. \nThe  Project  provides  for  retroactive  financing  of  emergency  repairs  to  infrastructure. \nADB management has agreed to provide retroactive financing for a maximum 30% of the total \nloan  amount  for  eligible  expenditures  incurred  before  the  effectiveness  of  the  loan  agreement \nbut  not  earlier  than  11  January  2009  or  12  months  before  the  date  of  the  loan  agreement, \nwhichever is the later. Retroactive financing will be permitted (i) if specifically agreed in the loan \nagreement  and  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  such  agreement,  and  (ii)  the  works  are  procured  in \naccordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines.  \n \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\f7. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n66. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. A project website will be \nestablished  and  used  to  disclose  the  audited  project  financial  accounts,  project  progress,  and \nprocurement activities. \n \n\n8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nThe  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n67. \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  disbursement  procedures  will  include  direct \npayments  and  reimbursements.  Direct  payments  will  be  encouraged  for  most  civil  works  and \nconsulting services. \n \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n68. \nReports.  The  EA  will  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  on  preconstruction \nactivities and construction of civil works, including (i) physical and financial progress, (ii) status \nof  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (if  required),  (iii)  environmental  management,  (iv)  public \ncommunication  campaigns,  and  (v)  other  activities  essential  to  project  implementation.  To \nfacilitate  performance  monitoring  and  post-project  review,  the  Government  has  agreed  to \nprovide ADB, within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, a completion report that will \ncover  implementation  details,  costs  and  benefits,  and  any  other  information  that  ADB  might \nrequire. \n \nAccounts  and  Audits.  The  EA  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  that  will \n69. \nidentify the goods and services financed from the loan, the expenditures incurred for the Project, \nand  the  use  of  counterpart  funds.  The  project  accounts  will  be  established  and  maintained  in \naccordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  and  practices,  and  financial  reports  will  be \nprepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards. Auditors acceptable to \nADB  shall  be  used  to  audit  the  accounts  and  annual  financial  statements  annually.  The  audit \nreports will include an auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the loan proceeds and compliance with the \nfinancial covenants in the Loan Agreement. The Government will provide ADB with the annual \naudited  financial statements,  audited  project accounts,  audit  reports,  management  letters,  and \nother related statements no later than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year throughout the \nimplementation period. A special audit focusing on governance and financial accountability will \nbe carried out on completion of the Project. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n70. \nThe  EA  will  establish  a  project  performance  and  monitoring  system  within  3  months  of \nloan  effectiveness,  using  the  targets  and  indicators  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework. \nThese  indicators  will  be  refined  and  monitored  during  project  implementation.  The  PMT  will \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\fmonitor and evaluate the Project\u2019s progress annually, and provide a final report within 6 months \nof the end of the contract period.  \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Review \n\n71. \nADB and the Government will undertake regular review missions about every 6 months. \nReviews  will  evaluate  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  and  other  relevant  aspects  of \nthe  Project  (including  administrative,  organizational,  technical,  environmental,  social,  poverty \nreduction, resettlement, economic, and financial aspects) that might affect project performance, \nviability,  and  achievement  of  scheduled  targets.  The  Project  will  be  administered  by  the  ADB \nSouth Pacific Subregional Office in Suva. In addition to the formal reviews every 6 months, ADB \nstaff will provide constant support and oversight. \n \n \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nThe Project will directly benefit the rural population in affected areas, many of whom are \n72. \npoor, by restoring access to economic opportunities and social services and safeguarding public \nhealth.  Government  agencies  and  private  sector  companies  that  use  the  transport  network  to \ndeliver products and services will benefit similarly. \n \nA. \n\nEconomic Impacts \n\n73. \nRehabilitation of roads and bridges, drainage schemes, and water supplies is essential \nto restoration of economic activities\u2014including agricultural exports from the affected areas and \naccess  for  tourism.  Thus,  it  will  improve  the  prospects  for  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction.  In  the  affected  areas,  efficient  and  effective  transport  infrastructure  is  essential  for \naccess to economic opportunities and social services by rural people who are disproportionately \npoor  and  disadvantaged.  Damage  to  the  transport  network  is  restricting  the  delivery  of  food, \nfuel, and building materials necessary for the recovery. The rehabilitation program will mitigate \nthe potentially extended negative impacts of the disaster and enable the country to recover after \nonly a temporary setback. \n \n74. \nProject activities will be widely scattered with graduated improvements to existing road \ninfrastructure.  Project  activities  will  be  technically  sound,  cost-effective,  and  represent  a  least-\ncost  alternative  with  appropriate  adjustments  for  climate-resistant  design.  Quick  and  simple \neconomic  evaluations  of  subprojects  will  be  carried  out  using  methods  appropriate  to  the \ncontext. Narrative evaluations, addressing each of the subproject selection criteria (Appendix 3) \nwill be required to demonstrate that subprojects are economically justifiable and will be used to \nprioritize subprojects.  \n \nB. \n\nPoverty Reduction Impact \n\n75. \nThe Project will support the country\u2019s efforts to reduce poverty by reinstating access to \nlocal  and  provincial  markets  for  agricultural  products,  thereby  restoring  income-generation \nopportunities. The Project also will reduce poverty by offering direct employment on the Project. \nDuring implementation, jobs will be created in construction and maintenance for civil works. The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\fC. \n\nSocial Impact \n\n76. \nThe  Project  will  restore  safe  access  to  social  services  and  safe  water  for  rural \ncommunities. Positive social impacts include restoration of good access to education facilities, \nwhich  will  help  maintain  school  enrollment  and  retention  rates,  and  restoration  of  access  to \nhealth  services,  which will  promote  more  frequent  use  and  facilitate  rapid  care  during  medical \nemergencies.  The  poor  will  benefit  from  the  restoration  of  access  to  markets  for  the  sale  of \nvegetables  from  home  gardens.  Women  in  particular  are  commonly  engaged  in  vegetable \ngardening to provide domestic food supply and supplementary income from the sale of excess \nproduce.  Other  social  benefits  include  restoration  of  access  to  administrative  and  service \ncenters, including communication facilities. \n \nThe  rehabilitation  subprojects  are  not  expected  to  require  resettlement  or  land \n77. \nacquisition,  as  all  works  are  expected  to  be  undertaken  on  existing  facilities  within  existing \nrights-of-way. If changes in conditions require land acquisition or resettlement for civil works, the \nGovernment  will  inform  ADB  and  prepare  a  resettlement  plan  according  to  relevant  laws  and \nregulations,  the  resettlement  framework  in  Appendix  9,  and  ADB  guidelines.  The  subproject \nselection process will include community consultations involving women. \n \n78. \nNative Fijians, who comprise the majority of the population, are the indigenous people of \nthe Fiji Islands. For the indigenous population, the rehabilitation subprojects will improve access \nto  health,  education,  livelihood,  and  social  services.  The  Project  is  not  expected  to  have  a \ndifferential impact on indigenous peoples. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n79. \nThe  Project  is  classified  environmental  category  B,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). Field surveys of \nsample subprojects were conducted to help assess the environmental impacts of the Project. All \nactivities  are  expected  to  be  confined  to  existing  locations  and  rights-of-way,  and  neither  land \nacquisition  nor  resettlement  should  be  required.  A  summary  initial  environmental  examination \nincorporating  an  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  (EMMP)  has  been  prepared \n(Supplementary Appendix B). Two sample initial environmental examinations (IEEs) for sample \nsubprojects  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  Environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedures (EARP) are in Supplementary Appendix D. ADB\u2019s assessment procedure is aligned \nwith the environmental impact assessment requirements of the Environmental Management Act, \n2005. \n \n80. \nThe Project will be designed to withstand the increased likelihood of future disasters and \nnatural hazards, taking into account that Fiji is also routinely susceptible to geophysical hazards \n(e.g.,  dry  landslide,  earthquake,  and  tsunami).  The  design  process  will  take  an  \"all  hazards\" \napproach  and  will  include  an  analysis  of  alternatives  for  construction  that  will  be  reviewed  for \npotential environmental impacts and enhanced sustainability. \n \nSubproject  environmental  selection  criteria  will  ensure  that  the  Project  will  not \n81. \npermanently  harm  any  ecologically  or  culturally  sensitive  areas,  and  that  all  negative  impacts \nidentified  will  be  avoided  or  mitigated  through  the  design.  The  construction  of  better  drainage \nstructures,  stabilization  of  slopes  through  bioengineering,  and  other  measures  undertaken  by \nthe  Project  will  have  long-term  benefits  for  the  environment.  Short-term  impacts  will  be \nunavoidable during construction. These might include noise, dust, and other temporary impacts \nsuch as loss of vegetation because of earth moving; and minor sedimentation of waterways and \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\fthe  coastal  environment  near  the  shore.  These  impacts  will  be  addressed,  and  methods \nspecified in the EMMP will mitigate them. \n \n82. \nEach  subproject  will  be  subject  to  an  IEE,  which  will  include  a  detailed,  site-specific \nEMMP  prepared  by  the  PMT.  The  EMMP  will  specify  the  required  mitigation  measures  and \nmonitoring  activities  to  ensure  their  effectiveness.  The  EARP  will  guide  the  environmental \nmanagement  of  the  sector  project  and  preparation  of  the  environmental  assessments  of  the \nsubprojects. \n \nE. \n\nProject Risks and Mitigation \n\n83. \nTechnical  Risks.  Weak  capacity  within  the  MWTPU  could  lead  to  implementation \nproblems.  Underestimation  of  resource  allocation  and  improper  construction  methods  and \nequipment  might  cause  delays  and  increase  costs.  Limited  availability  of  aggregates  in  some \nareas  could  pose  difficulties.  The  project  design  will  mitigate  these  risks  by  (i)  providing \nadditional  resources  through  an  integrated  PMT  to  manage  the  Project;  (ii)  incorporating \nprovisions in tender documents for evidence of satisfactory past performance by contractors in \nsimilar conditions; (iii) requiring a minimum level for provision of physical plant at mobilization, \ndetailed  quantification  of  engineering  risks,  and  adequate  contingencies  for  unforeseen  items; \n(iv) strengthening the MWTPU's EMU; and (v) holding community consultations in advance, with \nGovernment support, on access to resources. \n \n84. \nEnvironmental  Risks. Civil works, including material acquisition, could create negative \nimpacts  on  the  environment.  The  high  rainfall  climate,  ecologically  sensitive  coastal  and \nforested landscapes, and high level of biodiversity and endemism provide a large potential for \nenvironmental impacts. However, activities will be undertaken within the confines of the existing \nfacilities.  The  Project  will  not  disturb  major  habitats,  most  activities  will  be  in  areas  previously \nused for similar infrastructure, and an environmental management plan will be put in place for \neach set of subprojects. Adherence to best engineering practices during rehabilitation, and strict \nenforcement  of  the  EMMP,  will  avoid  or  adequately  mitigate  all  of  the  rehabilitation-related \nimpacts. The risks of a greater frequency or severity of natural events caused by climate change \nare increasing. The risks to rehabilitated infrastructure are mitigated by using higher engineering \nstandards  for  construction.  All  reports  on  the  Project's  environmental  performance  will  be \ndisclosed to the public through the project website. \n \n85. \nLand and Material Acquisition Risks. Landowners and rural populations are expected \nto welcome the rehabilitation activities because of the social and economic benefits. Risks relate \nprincipally  to  gaining  access  to  construction  materials  including  sand,  gravel,  and  rocks. \nPractices  for  consultation  and  compensation  are  well  established  in  the  Fiji  Islands,  and  strict \nadherence to these practices will mitigate the risks of delays.  \n \n86. \nGovernance  Risks.  Civil  works  and  consulting  contracts  are  subject  to  risks  of \ninappropriate  procurement  and  potentially  corrupt  practices.  The  Government  has  well-\ndocumented  procedures  that  require  all  contracts  to  be  procured  through  a  tender  board.  All \nprocedures are publicly advertised. \n \n87. \nAn  analysis  of  the  project  risks  shows  the  potential  adverse  social  and  environmental \nimpacts  are  not  significant  and  can  be  mitigated.  Cost  and  implementation  risks  will  be \nmanaged through the proposed approach to contractor selection, contract conditions, financial \nincentives,  and  penalties  for  delayed  implementation.  The  risks  are  manageable  and  do  not \nconstitute barriers to successful project implementation. \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n88. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nSubproject  selection.

The \nProject  will  be  implemented  via  a  sector  approach.  Each  subproject  will  be  prioritized  and \nselected  in  accordance  with  the  process  and  eligibility  criteria  set  forth  in  this  appendix.  A \nsystematic  and  consultative  approach  will  be  established  for  subproject  appraisal,  covering  (i) \nsocial,  economic,  and  environmental  evaluation; \n(iv) \nimplementation;  and  (v)  monitoring.  Each  subproject  feasibility  study  will  provide  sufficient \nevidence of its eligibility under the agreed-upon criteria, and will be in accordance with the detail \nand  quality  required  to  enable  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  assess  the  viability  and \nsuitability of the subproject. \n \n2. \nComponent A: Repairs in the Emergency Response Phase. The Project will finance \neligible  expenditures  incurred  during  the  immediate  post-disaster  period  to  restore  basic,  safe \naccess.  Activities  included  clearing  of  landslides  and  debris,  reinstatement  of  washed-out \napproaches to bridges and wet crossings, and temporary road pavement repairs.  \n \n3. \n\nComponent B: Civil Works. The Project will finance the following civil works: \n(i) \n\n(iii)  procurement; \n\n(ii)  design; \n\nrehabilitation  of  about  8  kilometers  (km)  of  main  sealed  highway,  restoring  the \nbituminous sealed surface and upgrading the pavement structure, as required for \na design life of 20 years; \nrepairs  to  landslips  on  major  roads  incorporating  appropriate  geotechnical \ninvestigation and design recommendations; \nrehabilitation  of  secondary  roads  including  re-graveling  of  about  50  km  of \nunsealed roads, reconstruction of 30 culverts, and reconstruction or lengthening \nof washed out wet crossings;  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv)  miscellaneous repairs to water supplies; and \n(v) \n\nrepairs to agricultural drainage schemes. \n\n \nRehabilitation  subprojects  will  be  subject  to  investigation  and  design  criteria,  though  a \n4. \nrange  of  engineering  solutions  will  be  considered.  Assessments  will  include  analysis  of  least-\ncost alternatives, including full life cycle costs, potential environmental impact, and sustainability \nto natural hazards. \n \nB. \n\nSubproject Eligibility Criteria \n\n5. \n\nSubprojects will meet the following general eligibility criteria: \n(i) \n\nThe  subprojects  will  rehabilitate  infrastructure  with  high  importance  based  on \ntheir  contributions  to  the  objectives  of  the  development  policy  objectives  as  set \nout in the Government\u2019s Sustainable Economic and Empowerment Development \nStrategy  2008\u20132010.They  will  focus  on  rehabilitation  of  efficient  and  cost-\neffective infrastructure, which will facilitate economic and social development and \nprivate sector investment. General eligibility criteria to be met are one or more of \nimproved  accessibility  to  social  services  for  poor  and  rural  households, \n(a) \nincluding schools, health facilities, and Government extension services; \nrestored  opportunities  for  employment  and  income  generation  for  poor \nand rural households; and \n\n(b) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n27 \n\n \n\n6. \n\n(c) \n\ncontribution to economic growth and poverty reduction for poor and rural \nhouseholds. \n\nSubprojects will be assessed for their contribution to \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\npotential for restoration of agricultural production; \npotential for restoration of exports of agricultural products; \npotential for restoration of tourism; \nemployment  of  local  communities  and  contractors  for  maintenance  and  small-\nscale works; \npotential  for  income  generation  for  poor  female  headed  households  and  other \nvulnerable groups; \nrestoration of incomes, particularly among poor and rural households; and \ncontribution to economic growth. \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\n(v) \n\n7. \nEnvironmental screening will be conducted for all subprojects in accordance with ADB's \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). In selecting subproject sites, including extraction \nsites for materials to be imported to construction sites, the following environmental  criteria will \nbe used for the first level of screening. If any of these criteria are found applicable to the site, \nthen  the  subproject  will  require  the  production  and  approval  of  an  environmental  impact \nassessment following the procedures and requirements of an environmental category A project \naccording to ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\nsites in or adjacent to areas classified as ecologically sensitive; \nrequirement  for  major  realignment  of  an  existing  road  or  complete  relocation  of \nan  existing  wet  crossing  or  drainage  structure  that  may  cause  significant \nenvironmental impacts; \nsignificant  adverse  impacts  on  natural/primary  forest  or  near-shore  marine \nenvironments such as reefs, mangroves, or other sensitive coastal areas; \npermanent negative effect on a known rare or endangered species; and \npermanent damage to irreplaceable cultural relics and archaeological sites. \n\n \n8. \nScreening  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  will  be  conducted  for  all \nsubprojects.  Any  subproject  that  would  entail  involuntary  resettlement,  according  to  ADB's \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995), will require production of a resettlement plan according \nto  relevant  laws  and  regulations,  the  resettlement  framework,  and  ADB  guidelines. 1\n\n                                                 \n1    \u201cInvoluntary  resettlement\u201d  addresses  social  and  economic  impacts  that  are  permanent  or  temporary  and  are \ncaused by (i) acquisition of land and other fixed assets, (ii) by change in the use of land, or (iii) restrictions imposed \non  land  as  a  result  of  an  ADB  operation.  An  \u201caffected  person\u201d  is  one  who  experiences  such  impacts.  The  term \naffected  person  includes  any  people,  households,  firms,  or  private  institutions  who,  on  account  of  changes  that \nresult from the Project will have their (i) standard of living adversely affected; (ii) right, title, or interest in any house, \nland  (including  residential,  commercial,  agricultural,  forest,  and/or  grazing  land),  water  resources,  or  any  other \nmoveable  or  fixed  assets  acquired,  possessed,  restricted,  or  otherwise  adversely  affected,  in  full  or  in  part, \npermanently  or  temporarily;  and/or  (iii)  business,  occupation,  place  of  work  or  residence,  or  habitat  adversely \naffected, with or without displacement. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nC. \n\nSubproject Assessment Process \n\n9. \nA  long  list  of  potential  subprojects  will  be  identified  and  prioritized  based  on \nassessments  of  (i)  existing  facilities  and  levels  of  usage,  including  the  number  of  potential \nbeneficiaries;  and  (ii)  positive  and  negative  economic,  social,  and  environmental  impacts. \nSubprojects  will  be  restricted  to  facilities  damaged  in  the  disaster.  Communities  will  be \nconsulted  in  the  preparation  of  the  long  list.  These  consultations  will  involve  broad \nrepresentation from the community and must include women. \n \n10. \nThe  Executing  Agency,  assisted  by  the  project  management  team,  will  prepare  an \nassessment report for each subproject proposed for detailed design and preparation of bidding \ndocuments.  Each  subproject  assessment  will  include  (i)  a  technical  feasibility  assessment; \nincluding  detailed  cost  estimates;  (ii)  a  narrative  assessment  of  economic  impact;  and  (iii)  an \ninitial  environmental  examination  and  a  full  environmental  impact  assessment  if  warranted,  in \naccordance with the environmental assessment and review procedures. Each component of the \nassessment  will  confirm  acceptable  ratings  against  the  criteria,  or  recommend  further  work  to \ncomplete the assessment. \n \n11. \nThe project steering committee will review and endorse the subprojects that meet all the \neligibility  criteria.  Before  the  detailed  design  of  any  subproject,  and  its  inclusion  for  financing \nunder the Project, proposed subprojects are subject to approval by ADB.  \n \n12. \nThe contracts for repairs to agricultural drainage schemes, and described in the agreed \nupon procurement plan, are deemed to be approved by ADB and eligible for financing from the \nloan  proceeds  provided  that  such  contracts  include  provisions  for  environmental  management \nduring implementation. This will include enforceable environmental management and monitoring \nplans acceptable to ADB.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n29 \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n\nTable A4: Detailed Cost Estimate by Financier \n($ million) \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \n\nA.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Project supports the Fiji Islands\u2019 poverty reduction objective of ensuring that all categories of the poor are able to meet \ntheir basic needs, with a specific objective of reducing the proportion of the population below the poverty line from 34.4% to \n24%, as set out in the Fiji Islands Sustainable Economic and Empowerment Development Strategy 2008\u20132010.a There is no \ncountry partnership strategy for the Fiji Islands.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.   Key Issues  \nThe Project will directly benefit the rural population in affected areas, many of whom are poor. The Project will contribute to \nthe country\u2019s efforts to reduce poverty by reinstating people\u2019s access to local and provincial markets for agricultural products, \nthereby restoring income-generation opportunities, and by safeguarding public health. \n \n2.  Design Features \nThe Project will involve activities spread throughout a large part of the country, which will bring benefits to many communities. \nThe subproject eligibility criteria include assessment of the subproject\u2019s contribution to employment of local communities and \ncontractors for maintenance and small-scale works, and to the restoration of incomes among poor and rural households. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \nNot applicable.  \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe  floods  directly  affected  more  than  200,000  people,  with  a  total  loss  of  life  of  12.  Temporary  displacement  during  and \nimmediately after the flooding was extensive\u2014164 houses were destroyed and an additional 1,677 houses were damaged in \nWestern Division. The total value of housing loss and damage is estimated at $0.9 million. The loss of household items and \npersonal belongings, clothes, and records and documents was significant. Many lost all they had. Food gardens were washed \naway, resulting in immediate hardship for households relying on their own produce for their food supply, and in economic loss \nfor those relying on selling surplus produce. The immediate rise in the price of basic foods had an impact not only on people \nin  the  flood-affected  areas,  but  across  the  Fiji  Islands.  In  the  immediate  aftermath  and  in  the  longer-term  recovery  phase, \npeople  experienced  life  with  no  water  or  interrupted  water  supply,  poor  sanitation,  and  impassable  and  damaged  roads, \nmaking access to markets and services difficult. All who experienced the floods would have suffered some degree of stress. \n \nIt can be assumed that at least one-third of the flood-affected population was living in poverty and would have had little or no \ncapacity to withstand the economic shock of the flood. The floods probably have worsened the situation of those already living \nbelow the poverty line. The floods have likely increased the vulnerability to poverty for those previously above the poverty line. \nFood  price  increases  after  the  flood  would  have  had  the  most  severe  impact  on  the  poor,  who  are  most  likely  to  rely  on \nsubsistence  gardens  for  their  own  consumption.  About  54%  of  low-income  Fijian  families  provide  a  substantial  proportion \n(more than 40%) of their own food. During the flood and immediately after, those directly affected by the flood were not able to \nengage in any economic activity for some weeks. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n 43\n\n1.    Provide  a  summary  of  the  consultation  and  participation  process  during  the  project  preparation.  A  damage  and  needs \nassessment  was  carried  out  jointly  with  officials  of  the  World  Bank.  Consultations  were  held  with  with  the  Government, \nincluding  the  ministries  of  Finance  and  National  Planning,  Works,  Transport  and  Public  Utilities,  Agriculture,  Health, \nEducation,  and  Local  Government.  Consultations  were  held  with  development  partners,  relevant  United  Nations \norganizations,  the  South  Pacific  Applied  Geoscience  Commission  and  Non-Government  organizations.  In  the  field, \nconsultations were held with the business community, farmers organizations and town councils. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nNo C&P plan was prepared as the Project was prepared under the ADB's Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004), \nwhich allows abbreviated procedures for project preparation in the interest of urgent response. \n \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.      Key  Issues. According to analysis of data from the 2002\u20132003 household income and expenditure survey, households \nhead by  women are more likely to be among the poorest households. Further, a disproportionate number of children live in \npoor households headed by women. Households headed by  women account for 12.7% of all households; in the lowest two \ndeciles  of  average  household  income  per  capita,  they  account  for  15.9%  and  14.5%,  respectively.  In  terms  of  population, \n10.8% of the total population live in households headed by women and 2.9% of all children live in such households. However, \nin  the  lowest  two  deciles  of  average  household  income  per  capita,  households  headed  by  women  account  for  16.9%  and \n14.1%,  respectively.  Of  the  children  living  in  households  headed  by  women,  20.4%  and  17.9%  respectively  are  in  the  two \nlowest income deciles. \n \nIn  the  flooded  areas,  vegetable  and  market  gardens  suffered  considerable  damage,  and  markets  were  closed  for  several \nweeks. Road damage prevented access to markets for varying periods of time after the waters receded. Root crop staples, \nsuch  as  cassava,  taro,  and  sweet  potato,  are  intolerant  to  flooding  and  were  badly  damaged  in  flooded  and  poorly  drained \nareas. This led to food shortages in the villages, and scarcity and high prices in the markets, for 3 months following the floods. \nWomen grow vegetables for subsistence and sale at local markets. On vegetable farms, women work with their families in the \nfields. Particularly in poor and disadvantaged households, women work as laborers for other farmers. The Project will restore \naccessibility to markets and jobs for women. \n \n2.  Key  Actions.

The outcome will be the restoration of economic and social activities in \naffected areas to pre-disaster levels. The rehabilitation of damaged roads is expected to restore \naccessibility  to  rural  areas  and  allow  a  resumption  of  economic  activities  and  social  services. \nRestoration of water facilities will safeguard public health. \n\n2. \n\nProject Components \n\n \n \n3. \nComponent A: Repairs in the Emergency Response Phase. The Project will finance \neligible  expenditures  incurred  during  the  immediate  post-disaster  period  to  restore  basic,  safe \naccess.  Activities  included  clearing  of  landslides  and  debris,  reinstatement  of  washed-out \napproaches to bridges and wet crossings, and temporary road pavement repairs. \n \n4. \n\nComponent B: Civil works. The Project will finance the following civil works: \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nRehabilitation  of  about  8  kilometers  (km)  of  main  sealed  highway,  restoring  the \nbituminous sealed surface and upgrading the pavement structure, as required for \na design life of 20 years. \nRepairs  to  landslips  on  major  roads  incorporating  appropriate  geotechnical \ninvestigation and design recommendations. \nRehabilitation  of  secondary  roads,  including  re-graveling  of  about  50  km  of \nunsealed roads, reconstruction of 30 culverts, and reconstruction or lengthening \nof  washed-out  wet  crossings.  Designs  will  enhance  resilience  against  extreme \nweather by incorporating appropriate climate proofing measures, including large \ncritical drainage structures and provision of scour protection for bridges and wet \ncrossings. \n\n(iv)  Miscellaneous repairs to water supplies. \n(v) \n\nRepairs  to  agricultural  drainage  schemes.  The  Land  and  Water  Resource \nManagement  Division  has  prepared  a  detailed  plan  for  rehabilitation  of  flood-\ndamaged  drainage  schemes  in  all  three  divisions  (Western,  Central,  and \nNorthern). Works will be undertaken to (a) clear waterways, (b) repair damaged \nseawalls  and  dykes,  (c)  repair  and  protect  scoured  drains  and  culverts,  and  (d) \nrepair floodgates. The plan is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\n \nComponent  C:  Consulting  services.  The  Project  will  finance  consulting  services  for \nthe  Environmental \n\n5. \nimplementation,  and \ndesign  and  supervision  of \nManagement Unit (EMU) of Ministry of Works, Transport and Public Utilities (MWTPU). \n \n\nfor  strengthening \n\n3. \n\nPurpose of the Resettlement Framework \n\n6. \nThis  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  to  guide  resettlement  planning  for  the \nproject  and to  ensure  that  the  resettlement  impacts  of  all subprojects  are  identified,  mitigated, \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n 47\n\nand compensated in accordance with acts and policy of the Government and ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). The resettlement framework provides \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\na  brief  description  of  the  overall  Project,  the  purpose  of  the  resettlement \nframework  and  plans,  and  the  likely  scope  of  the  resettlement  effects  of \nsubprojects; \nthe policy and legal framework of the Government and ADB with regard to land \nacquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement,  and  a  brief  review  of  resettlement \nexperiences in the Fiji Islands;  \nthe  resettlement  and  compensation  principles  and  entitlements  to  be  applied  to \nall subprojects under the Project;  \nan outline of procedures to be followed for the preparation and implementation of \nresettlement plans; and  \ninstitutional,  administrative, \nfor \nresourcing,  and \npreparation, approval, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of resettlement \nplans. \n\nfinancing  arrangements \n\n \n7. \nThe  resettlement  framework  will  be  distributed  (translated  into  Fijian  and  Hindi  by  the \nexecuting  authority 1   if  required)  to  the  affected  communities,  central  and  local  agencies, \ncompanies and agencies contracted to carry out design and works of the subprojects, and any \nother  individuals  responsible  for  aspects  of  subproject  preparation  and  implementation.2  The \nframework will also be disclosed on the ADB resettlement website immediately upon ADB Board \napproval. The resettlement framework should be read in conjunction with ADB\u2019s Handbook on \nResettlement: A Guide to Good Practice,3 and the relevant Government acts and guidelines. \n\n \n\n4. \n\nLand Acquisition, Potential Impacts, and Types of Losses \n\nThe  rehabilitation  subprojects  are  not  expected  to  require  resettlement  or  land \n8. \nacquisition, as all works will be undertaken on existing facilities within existing rights-of-way. If \nchanges  in  conditions  require  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  for  civil  works,  the  Government \nwill inform ADB and prepare a resettlement plan according to relevant laws and regulations, this \nresettlement framework, and ADB guidelines. \n\n9. \nEligible subprojects will be identified for upgrading and rehabilitation using the following \ncriteria:  (i)  the  subproject  feasibility  studies  reflect  need  and  high  development  priority  of  the \nGovernment; (ii) the minimum economic rate of return will be 12%; (iii) the proposed civil works \nwill not have any significant adverse effect on the environment; (iv) the proposed civil works will \nnot have any significant4 resettlement impact; and (v) land acquisition and resettlement plans (if \nneeded),  and  environmental  mitigation  plans,  will  be  prepared  and  other  social  issues \naddressed with action plans in accordance with ADB guidelines and the frameworks approved \nfor the Project, including this framework. \n\n10. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  are  not  likely  to  occur  as  a  result  of  the \nProject.  However,  if  conditions  change,  the  most  likely  impacts  are  associated  with  the \nupgrading  of  the  damaged  structures  from  their  pre-flood  state  so  they  can  withstand  the \n                                                 \n1  The executing authority is the Ministry of National Planning. \n2  Project approval will include Government and ADB approval of a number of key project documents prepared during \n\nthe term of the project management team, including the finalized resettlement framework. \n\n3  ADB. 1998.

These upgrades may require that \nacquisition of margins on the borders of the existing sites. If the acquisition of land is necessary, \nthe entitlement matrix in section D of this framework sets out the compensation for such losses \nto  affected  persons.  Compensation  will  relate  to  matters  such  as  physical  relocation  of \nsecondary structures, unanticipated loss of structures or other loss due to unforeseen impacts, \nand the loss of crops and trees. All physical relocation and the destruction of primary structures \ncan and will be avoided. \n\nAll known grave sites in the subproject areas will be avoided. If graves are discovered, \n11. \nthe  Project  will  ensure  that  relocation  processes  are  acceptable  to  any  relatives  and  to  local \ncommunities.  The  Department  of  National  Roads  has  established  acceptable  protocols  for  the \nrelocation  of  graves.  These  procedures  were  used  for  the  Third  Road  Upgrading  (Sector) \nProject (FRUP III)5 and will continue to be applied. \n\n12. \nNo  subprojects  that  might  be  classed  as  requiring  significant  resettlement  or  the \ndestruction  of  primary  structures  will  be  funded,  and  an  assurance  in  this  regard  will  be \nincorporated into the Loan Agreement. \n\nB. \n\nObjectives of Resettlement Plans \n\nADB\u2019s resettlement policy states that if the screening or social assessment determines \n13. \nthat people will experience resettlement impacts a resettlement plan is required.6 It needs to be \na time-bound action plan with appropriate budget provisions, and should be incorporated as an \nintegral  part  of  project  design. 7   Involuntary  resettlers  are  people  of  any  age,  skill  level,  or \nsocioeconomic circumstance who have been requested to give up land or assets for a project. \nUnder ADB policy, these people require assistance to reestablish their home and/or livelihoods. \n\n14. \nThe  policy  requires  that  a  plan  be  prepared  that  sets  out  all  of  the  compensation  and \nrehabilitation  support  to  be  provided  to  any  person,  family,  or  household  that,  because  of  the \nexecution of the project, would have his, her or their \n\nstandard of living adversely affected; \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nright,  title,  or  interest  in  any  house,  or  interest  in  or  right  to  use  any  land \n(including  premises,  agricultural  and  grazing  land,  commercial  properties, \ntenancy,  or  right  in  annual  or  perennial  crops  and  trees,  or  any  other  fixed  or \nmoveable assets) acquired or possessed, temporarily or permanently; \n\n(iii) \n\nincome-earning opportunities, business, occupation, work, or place of residence \nor habitat adversely affected temporarily or permanently; or \n\n(iv) \n\nsocial and cultural activities and relationships adversely affected.  \n\n \n15. \nThe  objective  of  the  resettlement  plan  is  to  provide  a  strategy  for  providing  project-\naffected  persons  with  (i)  compensation  for  lost  land;  (ii)  replacements  for  lost  secondary \n\n                                                 \n5    ADB.  1997.

Of the remainder, about 8% is freehold and the Government owns the balance of 2%. Of \nthe native land, nearly 64% is non-reserve and 34% is reserve land.9  \n\n17. \nNative land is communally owned and cannot be bought or sold. The Native Land Trust \nBoard (NLTB) is the statutory body with the responsibility to administer, develop, and manage \nthis land on behalf of its owners and for their benefit.10 The NLTB identifies the land required for \nuse by traditional Fijian communities and makes the remainder available for leasing. The NLTB, \nnot  the  owners,  issues  the  legally  binding  leases,  which  can  be  for  agricultural,  commercial, \nindustrial, or other uses. \n\n18. \nAll farmers of native land are either tenants or landowners farming with the permission of \ntheir own landowning clan. Some of these may have formalized their status by leasing the land, \nand have become tenants. Other tenant farmers will be either Fijians from other islands or parts \nof Viti Levu, or Indo Fijians. No distinction is made regarding race or community membership. \n\n19. \nThe Agricultural Landlord and Tenant Act (ALTA) governs all agricultural leases of more \nthan 1 hectare (ha) and the relations between landlords and agricultural tenants.11 Minimum 30-\nyear and maximum 99-year leases are allowed with no right of renewal. In practice, most leases \nare  for  30  years.  In  the  event  of  non-renewal,  the  tenant  must  vacate  the  land  after  a  grace \nperiod. \n\nThe maximum annual rental is 6% of the unimproved capital value. In theory, the rental \n20. \nrate  is  reviewed  every  5  years.  The  tenant  can  claim  compensation  for  all  development  and \nimprovements  of  the  property  with  claims  determined  by  the  Agricultural  Tribunal.  However, \ntenants can be compensated only for improvements if the NTLB has granted prior approval for \nthese improvements. In practice, lease rental rates are on a fixed schedule under the ALTA, and \nit has not been updated since 1997. The NLTB has introduced a lump sum payment to induce \n\n                                                 \n8     All  primary  structures  can  and  will  be  avoided.  Primary  structures  are  considered  to  be  buildings  used  as \nresidences, shops or buildings for community purposes (schools, clinics, churches, mosques or temples) and those \nused  as  principal  places  of  work.  Secondary  structures  are  considered  to  be  sheds,  animal  pens,  out-houses, \nfences, etc. \n\n9  Reserve land, is land not leased, but reserved by Mataqali and/or Government for future use.

However,  the  requirement  for  tenants  to  vacate  land  once  the  fixed  lease  and \ngrace  period  have  expired  causes  both  social  and  economic  hardship.  With  this  in  mind,  the \nNTLB  has  proposed  an alternative  lease  arrangement,  envisaging  a  50-year  rolling  lease  with \nprovision  for  a  review  after  25-years  to  consider  a  further  25-year  extension.  Thus,  the  tenant \nfarmer  would  be  given  a  minimum  25  years  notice  of  non-renewal.  A  market-based  rental \nsystem, as agreed to by the landlord and tenant (rather than imposed by legislation) and linked \nto the productivity of the land might also be introduced. Fair-market-oriented reviews could then \nalso be based on the system agreed on by the landlord and tenant.  \n\nLand  acquisition  in  the  Fiji  Islands  is  made  under  the  State  Acquisition  of  Lands  Act13 \n22. \n(SALA) Under the act, all types of land can be acquired for public purposes. The law provides \nthat  in  cases  of  land  acquired  for  public  purposes,  legal  titleholders  have  a  right  to \ncompensation. The law also provides for the right of landowners to legal proceedings for solving \ndisputes  and  grievances.  The  customary  rights  of  indigenous  peoples  without  formal  title  are \nalso protected. \n\nThe  SALA  guarantees  cash  compensation  to  those  with  recognized  legal  rights  or \n23. \ninterests in land. Compensation is paid at market values effective from the date at which notice \nof the state\u2019s intention to acquire the land is given. However, structures are compensated only \nat book or depreciated values. Compensation covers land, crops and trees, damage to portions \nof  land  not  acquired  (if  any),  changes  in  use  and  restrictions  on  use  of  any  portions  not \nacquired\u2014and  any  reasonable  expenses  associated  with  necessary  changes  of  residence  or \nplaces of business. \n\nIn  some  areas,  however,  local  market  prices  and  the  prices  overseas  investors  are \n24. \nwilling  to  pay  differ  significantly.  For  example,  in  Taveuni  and  around  Savusavu,  for  roads \nconstructed  under  the  FRUPIII,  the  affected  freehold  landowners  requested  about  F$200,000 \nper ha price\u2014the current price obtained from overseas investors. The Department of Lands and \nSurvey  (DLS),  applying  local  market  prices,  assessed  the  market  value  at  F$15,000  per  ha. \nWith the expected growth in demand from overseas investors, new values in certain areas need \nto  be  recognized.  These  new  values  would  derive  from  recent  sales  prices  to  overseas \ninvestors. \n\n25. \nSALA  and  its  regulations  also  do  not  require  compensation  payments  to  affected \npersons  who  have  no  recognized  legal  right  or  interest  in  the  land.  Compensation  is  required \nonly on a depreciated or book value basis for structures. Therefore, informal sharecroppers and \nsquatters are not entitled to any kind of compensation. People without titles are not entitled to \ncompensation  for  land.  However,  to  comply  fully  with  ADB\u2019s  resettlement  policy,  all  people \nwithout  titles  who  are  affected  by  the  project  will  be  entitled  to  compensation  for  loss  of \nstructures,  crops,  trees,  or  incomes  they  derive  from  land,  regardless  of  whether  they  have \nformal  title  to  the  land.  Adequate  provisions  for  such  have  been  included  in  the  entitlement \nmatrix. \n\n                                                 \n12 ADB.  2005.

Manila (March, pages 29\u201330). \n\n13 Originally the Crown Acquisition of Lands Act, 1940, it was subsequently amended by ordinance Nos. 24 of 1940, \n11 of 1942, 15 of 1943, 9 of 1955; orders of January 1967 and October 1970; and Act of Parliament (Act No. 1 of \n1998). Laws of Fiji, Chapter 135. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n 51\n\nIn addition, SALA does not provide relocation sites or assistance for the rehabilitation of \n26. \nadversely affected people. Since an express objective of the Project is to minimize, if not avoid, \nthe need for physical relocation, the development of resettlement sites will not be needed under \nthe  Project.  The  law  also  does  not  provide  for  any  special  mitigation  measures  for  vulnerable \ngroups  or  the  poorest  section  of  the  adversely  affected.  The  entitlement  matrix  includes \nprovisions  to  ensure  that  vulnerable  and  disadvantaged  people  are  given  opportunities  to \nimprove their living standards. \n\nHowever,  the  SALA  does  not  prevent  the  Government  from  providing  assistance  to \n27. \npeople adversely affected by the Project, including those having no legal title or interest in land. \nIn  FRUP  III,  for  example,  the  Government  agreed  to  ensure  that  Public  Works  Department \nwould fully comply with the Government\u2019s existing policies and procedures for compulsory land \nacquisition  established  in  SALA;  and  also  with  ADB\u2019s  resettlement  policy,  which  covered \ncompensation for holders without titles and various other kinds of assistance. \n\n2. \n\nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy Requirements \n\n28. \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy addresses both (i) social and economic impacts, \npermanent or temporary, caused by acquisition of land and other fixed assets; and (ii) changes \nin the use of land or restrictions imposed on land as a result of an ADB operation. An affected \nperson  is  one  who  experiences  such  impacts.  The  objectives  of  the  policy  are  (i)  to  avoid \ninvoluntary  resettlement  wherever  feasible;  (ii)  to  minimize  resettlement  where  population \ndisplacement  is  unavoidable  by  choosing  alternative  viable  project  options;  and  (iii)  where \ninvoluntary  resettlement  is  unavoidable,  to  ensure  that  affected  people  receive  assistance, \npreferably  under  the  project,  so  that  they  will  be  at  least  as  well  off  as  they  would  have  been \nwithout the project. \n\n29.  Where  involuntary  resettlement  is  unavoidable,  the  policy  is  designed  to  include  any \nresulting losses in project budgets. Therefore, ADB\u2019s policy calls for minimum land acquisition to \nminimize  or  eliminate  the  need  for  any  involuntary  resettlement.  In  determining  compensation \nwhen  resettlement  is  unavoidable,  ADB  policy  insists  on  replacement  value  of  lost  assets.14 \nWhile such principles can be used to value structures, it is difficult to apply these principles to \nland, crops, and trees. However, current market prices as collated by the Lands Registry can be \napplied  to  land,  and  the  schedules  of  rates  for  crops  and  trees  as  regularly  published  by  the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Primary Industries. \n\nAnother principle of ADB\u2019s policy is to cover all categories of adversely affected persons \n\n30. \nirrespective of their legal status. \n\n31. \nADB policy to avoid and/or minimize resettlement is focused on (i) consultation with the \npotentially impacted people during project planning and implementation, including disclosure of \nresettlement  plans  and  other  project-related  information;  (ii)  payment  of  compensation  for \nacquired  assets  at  market  or  replacement  values;  (iii)  compensation  and  resettlement \nassistance  to  all  categories  of  affected  people,  including  those  without  titles  such  as  informal \ndwellers  and  squatters,  or  encroachers;  (iv)  special  provision  of  assistance  for  vulnerable \ngroups,  such  as  families  headed  by  women,  ethnic  minorities,  indigenous  groups  and  tribes \n(particularly for the latter); (v) adequate provision for income restoration and generation; and (vi) \na  rehabilitation  program.  This  is  to  be  achieved  by  the  implementation  of  a  time-bound \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2003. Operations Manual.

Therefore, project planners will design the Project to avoid such places. \n\nFor reference purposes, a summary of the comparison of Government and ADB Policy \n\n33. \non Resettlement Issues is provided as Table A9.1. \n\nTable A9.1: Summary Description of Government and ADB Policy on Resettlement Issues \n \n\nGovernment Policy \nLand compensation at market \nprices for those with legal rights or \ninterests.a\n\nADB Policy \n\nCompensation at market prices \nfor those with legal rights or \ninterests, and to squatters and \nencroachers.

Relative to the \nsize and scope of work accomplished \nunder previous projects, costs and delays \narising from land acquisition issues have \nbeen minor.

Such  people  will  be  entitled  to \nrehabilitation assistance for restoring livelihoods, incomes and living standards. \n\n16 People without legal rights are referred to as \"non-titled\" in the Operations Manual, and include those who have no \nrecognizable  rights  or  claims  to  the  land  that  they  are  occupying  and/or  using.  Restoration  measures  must  be \ndetermined  in  consultation  with  affected  communities,  including  \u201cthose  people  who  might  not  be  formally \nrecognized in national legislation.\u201d \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nIf  changes  in  conditions  require  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  for  one  of  the \nsubprojects,  preparation  of  resettlement  plans  and  their  implementation  will  be \ncarried out with participation and consultation of all affected people.  \nCompensation for affected assets will be provided at replacement cost.17\n\nAn  implementation  schedule  and  budget  for  resettlement  planning  (including \nsocioeconomic  survey  and/or  census)  and  implementation  will  be  incorporated \ninto any subproject that reveals a need for resettlement, and will be incorporated \ninto the overall Project. \n\n(viii)  Agreements on compensation must be completed before land or other assets are \n\ntaken over by a subproject. \n\n(ix) \n\nCompensation  for  vulnerable  households  will  aim  to  improve  their  livelihood \nrather  than  merely  reestablishing  their  levels  of  poverty  or  marginalization,  and \nwill be carried out with respect for their cultural values and needs. \n\n \nAn  assurance  will  be  attached  to  the  Loan  Agreement  requiring  the  Government  to \n35. \ncomply with the provisions of (i) the SALA, (ii) ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy, and (iii) \nprovisions and entitlements set out in this resettlement framework. \n\nThe additional compensation required under ADB's Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide \n36. \nto  Good  Practice18  and  not  otherwise  paid  will  be  (i)  the  compensation  to  people  who  do  not \nhold titles such as squatters and sharecroppers, (ii) the compensation for any loss of livelihood, \nand (iii) full replacement value for secondary structures. This additional compensation, as and \nwhen  required,  will  be  paid  from  a  resettlement  budget  and  will  be  administered  by  a \nresettlement liaison officer (RLO) that will be established within the Ministry of Works, Transport \nand Public Utilities (MWTPU). The RLO will be set up before project implementation if a need \nfor  resettlement  emerges.  In  addition,  a  provision  for  unanticipated  lost  structures  of  various \ntypes should be included in this budget in case there are unforeseen impacts in any subproject. \nFor  the  same  reason,  a  provision  for  the  general  a  category  of  \u201cunanticipated  impact\u201d  should \nalso  be  included.  These  categories  of  compensation  are  included  in  the  entitlement  matrix  in \nsection D. \n\n37. \nThe MWTPU and the Land and Water Resource Management Division in the Ministry of \nAgriculture  and  Primary  Industries  will  not  be  able  to  take  possession  of  land  until  the  price \nnegotiation  is  complete,  and  will  not  be  able  to  take  possession  of  leased  land  without  the \nconsent of the lessees. \n\n38. \nThe  standard  DLS  procedure  (which  will  be  followed  during  the  Project)  is  to  prepare \ninitial  valuations  using  local  market  prices,  and  data  in  this  regard  is  obtained  from  the  Land \nRegistrar\u2019s office. Finally determined prices, nonetheless, come about through negotiation. For \nland, 75% of the finally agreed price is paid in advance pending completion of the measurement \n\n                                                 \n17 Replacement  cost  means  the  replacement  of  lost  assets  and  income.  For  land,  it  means  the  cost  of  buying  or \nleasing replacement land with equal productive value and potential near the lost land plus the cost of preparing the \nland to levels similar to those of the affected land and cost of registration and taxes. For structure, it means current \nmarket value of building materials and labor without deduction for depreciation and/or any materials salvaged. For \ncrops and trees, it means current market value based on economic production, age, and type. Where national law \ndoes not meet the standard for providing replacement cost, it will be supplemented as necessary. In the absence of \nfunctioning markets, a compensation structure is required that enables affected people to restore their livelihoods \nto levels at least equivalent to those maintained at the time of dispossession, displacement, or restricted access.  \n\n18 ADB. 1998.

Owners and lessees will be compensated \nfor  lost  income,  standing  crops,  and  other  losses  during  construction  also  at  the  time  of  final \nmeasurement  and  at  rates  set  by  the  Department  of  Agriculture. 19   These  procedures  have \nadvantages in the Fiji Islands (para. 42) and will be continued. \n\n39. \nUnder  current  Government  provisions,  100%  of  the  value  of  structures  (but  only  the \ndepreciated  book  value)  is  paid  at  the  same  time  as  the  initial  75%  for  land.  Secondary \nstructures  (if  any),  which  are  the  only  types  of  structure  that  will  be  affected,  will  be \ncompensated at replacement cost without depreciation or deduction for any salvaged materials. \n\n40. \nFor  project  resettlement  issues,  the  only  relevant  differences  between  the  Fiji  Islands \nGovernment  and  ADB  policy  concern  (i)  the  payment  of  75%  rather  than  100%  of  agreed \ncompensation  for  land  before  work  begins,  (ii)  the  non-completion  of  any  final  transfer  of  the \nland to Government until the work is complete, (iii) the depreciated value paid on structures, and \n(iv)  the  lack  of  compensation  provided  to  squatters.  The  Government  system,  with  regard  to \npoints  (i)  and  (ii),  has  the  advantage  of  allowing  easy  adjustments  during  construction  to \naccount  for  remedying  cut  slope  instability,  minor  cut  widening  to  obtain  suitable  fill  material, \nand so forth.20 It was successful during FRUP III and should continue. Other policy differences \nwill be resolved by the assurance referred to in para. 36. \n\nThis  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  based  on  the \n41. \nfollowing  legal  and  policy  requirements:  (i)  SALA  of  the  Fiji  Islands,  (ii)  ADB's  Operations \nManual:  Bank  Policies  (BP):  Involuntary  Resettlement  (F2/BP)  and  Operational  Procedures \n(OP):  Involuntary  Resettlement  (F2/OP),  (iii)  ADB's  Handbook  on  Resettlement:  A  Guide  to \nGood Practice, and (iv) the information included in this document. \n\nD. \n\nEntitlement Matrix \n\nAn  entitlement  matrix  has  been  prepared  to  cover  all  anticipated  potential  impacts and \n\n42. \nlosses that could be created by the Project. \n\n43. \nPotential  losses  include  loss  of  different  categories  of  land:  residential,  agricultural, \ncommercial  and  forest  land;  crops;  trees;  structures;  and  incomes.  A  summary  of  losses  and \nentitlements is provided in Table A9.2.  \n\nTable A9.2: Summary of Losses and Entitlements \n \n\nTypes of Losses \n\nLoss of Land \n\nEntitlements \n\n \n\nAll land temporarily affected (less than 1 year) \n\nFor owner, rent for 1 year, land restored to pre-project \ncondition.

Farmers  will  often  be  allowed  to  harvest  their  crops  at  the \n\nproper time before the land is taken. \n\n20 Delays because of the Government system are rare, though occasionally, formal advance acquisition would have \nprevented a delay. On previous projects, the majority of delays in rural areas have been minor (and illegal as the \nlandowner will have given consent to the purchase in writing). If completion of land acquisition procedures before \ncontract award is insisted upon, more delays could occur. Human resource capacity is lacking within the DLS. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nTypes of Losses \n\nEntitlements \n\nAgricultural and other\u2014permanent loss \n\nSevere effects (10 % or more loss of productive \nland) \n\nLoss of Structures  \n\nSecondary structures  \n\nUnanticipated other structures (various types) \n\nCrop and Tree Loss \n\nStanding crop and plantation \n\nTrees (fruit and timber) \n\nFor tenants and occupants without titles, compensation for \nstructures and assistance with location of suitable alternative \nland if required. \n\nFor owners, full title to replacement land as a priority, or cash \ncompensation at replacement cost at current market value.  \nFor tenants, sharecroppers, and occupants without titles, \ncompensation for crops, trees, or structures according to \nagreements, and assistance with location of suitable \nalternative land if required. \n\nLivelihood restoration grant and transition allowance. \n\nCompensation in cash or kind at full replacement cost with no \ndeduction for depreciation or salvaged materials, depending \non actual losses. \n\nCompensation in cash or kind at full replacement cost with no \ndeduction for depreciation or salvaged materials, depending \non actual losses. \n\nCash compensation at market price for loss of crops and \nplantation. \n\nCompensation based on the type and age of the tree to be \ndetermined using Ministry of Agriculture and Primary \nIndustries schedule of rates and with right of appeal in cases \nwhere such do not reflect market prices and acceptance or \nagreement cannot be reached. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSupport Measures and Allowances \n\nUnanticipated Other Impacts \n\nSpecial allowance (poor and vulnerable affected \npersons) \n\nAn allowance to improve the livelihoods of the most \ndisadvantaged and vulnerable. \n\nTo be considered depending on the nature of the \nimpact at the time \n\nCompensation in cash or kind at full replacement cost with no \ndeduction for depreciation or salvaged materials, depending \non actual losses. \n\nSources: Asian Development Bank and Government of the Fiji Islands. \n\nThe  general  entitlement  matrix  will  apply \n\n \n44. \nto  all  subprojects.

Budget  estimates  will  be  made  to  meet  the  costs  involved  in  the \npreparation  and  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan.  In  addition,  the  plans  will  include  an \nentitlement matrix showing losses, entitled persons, and their entitlements and implementation \nissues. \n\n46. \nThe subprojects are not expected to require resettlement or land acquisition, as all works \nwill be undertaken on existing facilities within existing rights-of-way. If during the detailed design \nof the subprojects or during the DMS it is determined that land acquisition or resettlement will be \nnecessary, the PMT will inform ADB and prepare a resettlement plan according to relevant laws \nand regulations, this resettlement framework, and ADB guidelines. \n\nE. \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\n47. \nInformation dissemination to, consultation with, and participation of affected persons and \ninvolved agencies maintain transparency of the Project, reduce potential conflicts, minimize the \nrisk  of  project  delays,  and  enable  the  Project  to  design  the  resettlement  and  the  rehabilitation \nprogram  as  a  comprehensive  development  program  to  suit  the  needs  and  priorities  of  the \naffected  persons.  The  actions  that  need  to  be  undertaken  for  inclusive  participation  in \nresettlement planning are as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(affected  persons, \n\nidentification  of  stakeholders  who  will  be  involved  in  resettlement  planning  and \nlocal  communities  at \nimplementation \nresettlement sites as required, project authorities, elected officials, approving and \nimplementing agencies, and nongovernment organizations); \ndissemination  of  information  (including  project  entitlements) and  identification  of \nappropriate  mechanisms  for  feedback  and  facilitating  the  consultation  process; \nand \nidentification of a grievance redress mechanism and procedure. \n\nlocal  officials, \n\n1. \n\nConsultation during Plan Preparation and Implementation \n\n48. \nDuring  the  initial  resettlement  plan  preparation,  a  socioeconomic  survey,  key  informant \ninterviews,  and  informal  meetings  with  severely  affected  persons  and  stakeholders  will  be \ncarried  out.  Where  possible,  this  process  will  begin  with  a  meeting  with  the  village  and \nsettlement leaders adjacent to the areas where the civil works are to be carried out as well as \nalong  any  feeder  roads  to  the  civil  works  areas.  These  meetings  will  provide  subproject \nbackground and relevant details. Meetings will then be held with officers from the NLTB before \nany  other  public  meetings,  one-on-one  interviews  with  affected  persons,  or  the  start  of  any \ninventory of losses. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n 59\n\nIn  updating  of  the  plans  (based  on  the  detailed  design),  further  consultation,  a  local \n49. \ncensus,  a  DMS,  and  participation  will  be  undertaken  by  the  Project  Management  Team  to \nensure  that  information  on  the  overall  Project  and  the  subprojects'  objectives,  implementation \nschedule,  resettlement  and  land  acquisition,  eligibility,  and  compensation  issues  are  properly \nunderstood  and  accepted  by  the  affected  communities.  The  DMS  will  be  undertaken  in \ncollaboration  with  the  affected  persons.  The  cutoff  date  for  entitlement  eligibility  shall  be  the \ndate of commencement of the census in regard to the final resettlement plan. \n\nFollowing  mobilization  of  the  project  supervision  consultant,  and  if  detailed  subproject \n50. \ndesign  confirms  that  land  acquisition  and/or  resettlement  will  be  necessary,  a  resettlement \nworkshop will be held for the land acquisition officers (assigned staff of MWTPU) and other staff \nof  government  departments  or  agencies  that  have  a  role  in  land  acquisition  and  resettlement. \nThe  workshop  will  include  seminars  and  participant  exercises  on  the  following  topics:  (i)  the \noverall Project, (ii) Government and updated ADB policy and procedures on land acquisition, (iii) \nthe project resettlement framework, (iv) likely project impacts and the entitlements that flow from \nthem,  (v)  establishment  of  compensation  rates,  (vi)  proposed  resettlement  strategies,  (vii) \npreparation of resettlement plans, (viii) budget and costs, (ix) tentative implementation schedule, \n(x)  implementation  of  the  plan,  and  (xi)  monitoring.  The  workshop  will  include  question  and \nanswer  sessions  to  allow  participants  to  share  their  experiences  with  resettlement  on  other \nprojects. \n\n51. \nDetailed consultations individually and/or in small groups with severely affected women \nwho  head  households  and  other  vulnerable  households  will  be  carried  out  to  determine  their \nspecific  requirements  and  preferences  for  rehabilitation  assistance.  To  facilitate  this  effort,  the \nfollowing will be undertaken: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nSeparate  consultations  will  be  held  with  women  and  vulnerable  groups  to \nencourage their participation in resettlement planning and implementation. \nConsultations with women and vulnerable groups will take into consideration the \nfollowing  issues:  (a)  timing  of  consultations  to  accord  with  people\u2019s  daily  and \nseasonal  responsibilities  and  availability;  and  (b)  communications  methods \nappropriate to people\u2019s literacy levels and/or local languages. \n\n2. \n\nInformation Disclosure \n\n52. \nIf land acquisition or resettlement is necessary, a series of meetings will be held with the \naffected persons, DLS, NLTB, district officers, village chiefs, and other relevant agencies. These \nmeetings  will  ensure  that  the  affected  persons  and  stakeholders  of  the  affected  areas  fully \nunderstand  the  details  of  the  resettlement  plan,  compensation,  and  rehabilitation  measures \napplicable to the Project. These meetings will convey the following information: \n\nbrief description of the Project and subproject, \ntypes of impacts expected, \nbasic compensation policy and entitlements,  \noutline of livelihood restoration measures, \nconsultation  and  participation  opportunities  for  affected  persons  and  their \ncommunity, \nimplementation schedule, and \n\n(vi) \n(vii)  who to contact for additional information. \n\n \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nIf \n\nland  acquisition  or \n\nresettlement  plan  and \n53. \nimplementation  schedule  will  also  be  posted  in  affected  districts  and  project  offices.  These \npostings  will  be  updated  whenever  adjustments  to  the  plans  are  made.  These  activities  will \ncontinue  throughout  the  implementation  of  the  subproject.  In  addition,  press  releases  to \nnewspapers and the electronic media will be made the consultation process starts. \n\nis  necessary, \n\nresettlement \n\nthe \n\n54. \nADB\u2019s  disclosure  requirements  also  mean  that  the  framework  will  be  disclosed  to \naffected  persons  before  appraisal,  and  that  the  framework  and  plans  prepared  for  any \nsubproject  roads  will  be  available  on  ADB\u2019s  website  once  they  have  been  approved  or \nendorsed. The complete resettlement framework and plans, including all appendixes prepared \nfor  the  core  subprojects,  will  be  made  available  at  district  offices  or  any  local  project  offices \nbefore appraisal. \n\n55. \nThe  resettlement  plans  for  the  subprojects  and  any  subsequent  revisions  to  the  plans \nprepared  after  detailed  design  will  also  be  disclosed  to  affected  persons  (including  DMS, \ndetailed  asset  valuations,  entitlements,  special  provisions,  grievance  procedures,  timing  of \npayments, and implementation schedule) before submission to ADB for review and approval. \n\nIn  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2005),  ADB  will  upload  the \n\n56. \nresettlement framework and plans on the ADB resettlement website as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nthe draft resettlement plan and framework before appraisal, \nthe final resettlement plan upon receipt of the final resettlement plan, and \nthe revised resettlement plan upon receipt of a revised resettlement plan. \n\n3. \n\nGrievance Redress Mechanisms \n\n57. \nCare shall be taken to prevent grievances rather than going through a redress system, \nand  grievances  will  be  minimized  through  careful  subproject  design  and  implementation  by  (i) \nensuring  full  and  frank  participation  and  consultation  with  affected  persons;  (ii)  establishing \nrapport  between  the  community  and  MWTPU  through  its  project  management  unit;  (iii)  and \nensuring frequent interactions, transparency, and monitoring.  \n\n58. \nA grievance mechanism will be established that will allow affected persons to appeal any \ndisagreeable decisions or practices arising from compensation for land and other assets, or to \nsettle any general subproject-related disputes. Affected persons will be made fully aware of their \nrights  and  the  procedures  for  making  a  grievance,  whether  verbally  or  in  writing,  during \nconsultation.  The  Project  has  the  potential  for  two  types  of  grievances:  grievances  related  to \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  requirements;  and  grievances  related  to  compensation  or \nentitlement. \n\n59. \nA grievance redress committee (GRC) will be established, chaired by the MWTPU public \nrelations  officer.  It  will  include  a  valuation  officer  from  the  DLS,  and  community  leaders  or \nrepresentatives  of  affected  persons.  The  GRC  will  also  include  women  and  representatives  of \nNLTB  and  Mataqali, 21   as  relevant,  to  reflect  the  composition  of  affected  persons  and \nbeneficiaries. \n\n60. \nThe  GRC  will  deal  with  complaints  relating  to  apportionment  of  compensation  among \njoint owners, relocation issues, and unaddressed losses. It will not be empowered to challenge \n                                                 \n21 A clan is a group of people united by kinship and descent, which is defined by actual or perceived descent from a \n\ncommon ancestor. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n 61\n\nthe legal entitlements of affected persons. Further, it will refrain from making decisions relating \nto design or engineering matters, or on any compensation matters that are pending before the \ncourts. \n\nIn the first instance, attempts will be made to settle the issues at the village level through \n61. \nconsultation  and  involvement  of  the  project  resettlement  specialists  (and  nongovernment \norganizations and mediators or facilitators) as required. Complaints that cannot be addressed at \nthis level may be presented to the GRC. \n\n62. \nAffected persons will be exempted from all administrative and legal fees associated with \nresolving  the  grievance  pursuant  to  the  grievance  redress  procedure,  except  for  cases  filed  in \ncourt by affected persons. \n\nF. \n\nProcedure for Subproject Resettlement Plan and Budget \n\n63. \nDuring project implementation, the MWTPU will be responsible for sending to the DLS a \nplan  showing  any  land  to  be  acquired  for  the  purpose  of  the  Project.  The  DLS  will  then  be \nresponsible  for  the  acquisition  of  this  land.  It  will  prepare  the  detailed  land  acquisition  plans, \nidentify landowners, and undertake negotiations to reach an agreement on values. In the case \nof native land, the DLS will send the proposal to the NLTB, which will negotiate on behalf of the \nnative  landowners.  However,  the  Mataqali  owning  the  land  will  have  to  accept  or  reject  the \nNLTB recommendations. Land acquisition will be made in accordance with the provisions of the \nSALA.  Thus,  compensation  will  cover  (i)  land22  at  fair  market  value;  (ii)  crops  and  trees;  (iii) \nsecondary  structures  at  replacement  value;  (iv)  squatters  and  sharecroppers;  (v)  any  other \ndamage  caused  during  execution,  if  any;  and  (vi)  any  imposed  changes  in,  or  restrictions  on, \nuse of remaining land following acquisition. In each case, compensation will be divided in a fair \nand equitable manner between lessee and lessor depending on present annual payments, the \nlength of the lease left to run, and the anticipated lease renewal premium. \n\nAny subproject resettlement plans will be based on this resettlement framework and the \n\n64. \nentitlement matrix (Table A9.3). \n\nResettlement budgets will be prepared for each subproject that has resettlement needs. \n65. \nThese budgets will be based on the amounts of compensation required to cover all losses and \nimpacts, including (i) the costs of acquiring required land at market prices; (ii) compensation for \nlost  crops  and  trees  based  on  replacement  and/or  market  values;  (iii)  lost  income  from  the \ntemporary use of land for spoil; (iv) loss of traditional use rights and community properties and \nresources,  compensated  by  replacement  of  similar  common  property  resources  or  as  cash \ncompensation  if  the  former  is  not  possible;  and  (v)  temporary  losses  as  a  result  of \nenvironmental impacts (for example, losses to crops from increased dust). Administration costs \nwill add about 20% to total costs. For physical contingencies, 10% has been allowed. \n \n66. \n\nBudgets will be shown as the per unit costs required to cover replacement of all losses. \n\nG. \n\nOrganizational Arrangements and Institutional Responsibility  \n\nThe  following  are  key  organizations  involved  in  the  resettlement  and  compensation \n\n67. \nprocess: \n                                                 \n22  Land  can  be  only  acquired  if  it  is  intended  to  be  made  for  public  purposes.  However,  if  some  parcels  become \neconomically unviable because they are separated from the original body and small, consideration should also be \ngiven to their purchase. \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  MWTPU,  which  is  the  EA,  will  have  overall  control.  The  MWTPU \nresponsibilities  are  (a)  identification  of  affected  areas  under  their  authority,  (b) \ncommunity liaison, (c) budgetary provision, (d) administration of the PMU and its \nRLO; \nThe DLS will be responsible for (a) initial valuations, (b) identification of owners \nand leaseholders, and (c) negotiations with landowners. \nThe NLTB represents and negotiates on behalf of the Mataqali landowners, signs \nagreements  on  their  behalf,  and  is  responsible  for  securing  the  agreement  of \n75% of Mataqali members before making such agreements. \n\nThe EA will forward outline plans to the DLS, which will negotiate and, with the DNR, pay \n\n68. \ncompensation. The NLTB will negotiate on behalf of the native landowners. \n\n69. \nResettlement and compensation following ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy will be \na new experience for project managers in the Fiji Islands. Therefore, it is important that officers \nin  the  DLS  and  EA  are  trained  in  ADB  requirements,  and  subproject-specific  tailored \nmanagement  procedures  are  implemented  as  soon  as  possible  if  a  need  for  resettlement  is \nidentified  during  subproject  design.  An  RLO  will  be  established  within  MWTPU,  which  will \nensure that compensation is paid as required under ADB policy. A top-up resettlement budget \nwill  be  made  available  to  the  RLO  to  provide  the  additional  compensation  (if  any)  required  by \nADB\u2019s Operations Manual, Involuntary Resettlement: Bank Policy (OM, F2/BP) and Involuntary \nResettlement: Operational Procedures (OM, F2/OP). \n\n70. \nTo  expedite  the  acquisition  process,  continuous  and  early  dialogue  will  be  instituted \nbetween  the  land  acquisition  authorities  and  the  owners.  Only  when  consents  of  the  owners, \nlessees, or other occupiers have been obtained and the initial payments have been made will \nthe land be turned over to the subprojects. \n\nH. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n71.  Monitoring will \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nverify  that  project  activities  have  been  effectively  completed  with  respect  to \nquantity, quality, and timeliness; and \nassess whether and how well these activities are achieving the stated goals and \npurpose of the Project. \n\n72. \nRegular monitoring of the resettlement plan implementation will be conducted internally \nby  the  implementing  agencies  (EA,  DLS  and  NLTB),  as  well  as  externally  by  an  independent \nmonitoring  organization,  hired  by  the  EA  (para.  77).  In  carrying  out  all  activities  related  to \nmonitoring, evaluation, and supervision, consideration will be given to gender issues in all of the \nabove, in accordance with the ADB Policy on Gender and Development, the Gender Checklist, \nand the Involuntary Resettlement Policy. \n\n1. \n\nInternal Monitoring \n\n73. \nInternal  monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  subproject  resettlement  plans  will  be  the \nresponsibility of the implementing agencies, with the assistance of the project consultants. The \nresettlement  preparation  and \nimplementing  agencies  will  oversee \nimplementation through regular progress reports. \n\nthe  progress \n\nin \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n 63\n\n \n\n74. \n \n\nThe following indicators will be monitored regularly: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nin \n\nthe \n\npayment of compensation to affected persons in various categories, according to \nthe  compensation  policy  described \nresettlement  plan,  with  no \ndiscrimination  according  to  gender,  membership  of  ethnic  group,  or  any  other \nfactor; \ndelivery of technical assistance, relocation, payment of subsistence, and moving \nallowances (if appropriate); \ndelivery of income restoration and social support entitlements (if appropriate); \npublic information dissemination and consultation procedures; \nadherence \nto  grievance  procedures  and  outstanding \nmanagement\u2019s attention, and equality of access; \nattention given to the priorities of affected persons regarding the options offered; \nand \ncoordination  and  completion  of  resettlement  activities  and  award  of  civil  works \ncontracts. \n\nrequiring \n\nissues \n\n \n75. \nThe MWTPU will maintain a database of resettlement monitoring information regarding \nthe Project, and will update it every month. Assisted by the project consultants, the MWTPU will \nsubmit to the ADB a monitoring report23 every 3 months on the progress of implementation of \nthe resettlement plan. The internal monitoring reports will cover the following issues: \n \n\nthe  number  of  affected  persons  by  category  of  impact  per  component,  and  the \nstatus  of  compensation  payment,  relocation,  and  income  restoration  for  each \ncategory; \nthe  amount  of  funds  allocated  for  operations  or  for  compensation,  and  the \namount of funds disbursed for each; \nthe eventual outcome of complaints and grievances, and any outstanding issues \nrequiring management or ADB\u2019s assistance; \nimplementation problems; and \nrevised actual resettlement implementation schedule. \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n \nExternal Monitoring \n\n2.   \n\n76. \nThe  general  objective  of  the  external  monitoring  is  to  provide  an  independent  periodic \nreview (every 6 months) and assessment of (i) the achievement of resettlement objectives; (ii) \nthe changes in living standards and livelihoods; (iii) the restoration of the economic and social \nbase of the affected people; (iv) the effectiveness, impact, and sustainability of entitlements; (v) \nthe  need  for  further  mitigation  measures,  if  any;  and  (vi)  strategic  lessons  for  future  policy \nformulation and planning. \n\n77. \nIn accordance with ADB requirements for consultant procurement, the MWTPU will hire \nan  organization  to  handle  independent  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  resettlement  plan \nimplementation.  The  independent  monitoring  organization  (IMO)  will  be  specialized  in  social \nsciences and experienced in resettlement monitoring. The IMO will start its work as soon as the \nupdated resettlement plan has been approved. \n\nThe IMO will monitor and evaluate the following indicators: \n\n78. \n \n\n                                                 \n23 As part of the DNR\u2019s regular quarterly progress report to ADB. \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\npayment of compensation; \ncoordination  of  resettlement  activities  with  construction  schedule,  and  provision \nfor technical assistance for house construction; \nprovision of allowances to all entitled affected persons; \nfacilitation  of    access  to  the  socioeconomic  support  program  and  income \nrestoration program, where relevant, according to the policies of the Project; \npublic consultation and awareness of compensation policy; \nrestoration of productive activities; \nthe  level  of  satisfaction  of  affected  persons  with  various  aspects  of  the \nresettlement plan; and \ntrends in living standards. \n\n(viii) \n \nThe IMO will conduct an evaluation of the resettlement process and its impact between 6 \n79. \nand  12  months  after  completion  of  all  resettlement  activities,  using  the  same  survey \nquestionnaire and sample used during the monitoring activities. \n\nI. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n80. \nThe implementation of resettlement and related activities will take place after the project \nsupervision consultant has been mobilized. The consultant will work closely with and assist the \nDNR in all resettlement and related activities. \n\n81. \nCivil  works  contractors  will  be  issued  a  notice  of  possession  of  site  for  any  section  of \nconstruction  works  only  when  the  MWTPU  has  (i)  satisfactorily  completed  compensation \npayments, in accordance with the approved relevant resettlement plan for that subproject; and \n(ii) ensured that the rehabilitation assistance is in place and the area required for civil works is \nfree of all encumbrances. \n\nThe  plan  implementation  schedule  (Table  A9.4)  envisages  a  sequence  of  activities. \n82. \nSome  steps  will  overlap  in  their  timing,  and  some  will  be  repeated  throughout  the  project \nschedule. \n\nTable A9.4: Implementation Schedule \n \n\nActivities \n\nMobilize project design consultant including resettlement specialist \n\nEstablish grievance committees  \n\nBegin internal monitoring program (including monthly reporting) \n\nDistribute entitlement framework to affected persons and communities \n\nConsultation with local officials, affected persons, and concerned groups or departments \nContinue  consultation,  information  dissemination,  participation  programs,  and  grievance \nresolutions \nBegin detailed site survey and design of subproject  \n\nContract and mobilize independent monitoring organization \n\nConduct updated  detailed measurement survey (based on detailed design) \n\nFinalize list of entitled persons, replacement cost survey, and compensation rates \n\nBegin external monitoring program (baseline) \n\nSubmit updated plan to EA and ADB \n\nEA and ADB approval of updated plan \n\nPrepare and distribute copies of updated and approved resettlement plan \n\nTiming \n\nMonth 1 \n\nMonth 1 \n\nMonth 1 \n\nMonth 2 \n\nMonth 2 \n\nOngoing \n\nMonth 2 \n\nMonth 3 \n\nMonth 4 \n\nMonth 4\u20135 \n\nMonth 5 & 6 \n\nMonth 6 \n\nMonth 6 \n\nMonth 6 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nActivities \n\nDisclose approved resettlement plan on ADB\u2019s website   \n\nDevelop resettlement site  \n\nSubmit to local authorities for all clearances \n\nEffect compensation payments and implement land transfer procedures \n\nIssue notice of possession of sites \n\nSubmit external monitoring report (on plan implementation) to ADB \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, EA = executing agency. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n 65\n\nTiming \n\nMonth 6 \n\nMonths 6\u201312 \n\nMonth 7(ongoing) \n\nMonth 9 (ongoing) \n\nMonth 10 (ongoing) \n\nMonth 11 \n\nEnsure appropriate advance evacuation notification (notice to clear construction area) \n\nMonth 9 (ongoing) \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 10 July 2009) \n \n\u2013 \n", "Currency Unit\n", "Fiji dollar/s (F$) \n", "F$1.00\n$1.00\n", "= \n= \n", "$0.4781 \nF$2.0916 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nEA \nEARP \nEMMP \nEMU \nENDA \nGDP \nICB \nIEE \nkm \nLIBOR \nLWRM \nMAPI \nMNP \nMWTPU \nNCB \nNGO \nPMT \nSIEE \nTA \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nexecuting agency \nenvironmental assessment and review procedure \nenvironmental management and monitoring plan \nEnvironmental Management Unit \nEmergency Assistance for National Disasters \ngross domestic product \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \nkilometer \nLondon interbank offered rate \nLand and Water Resource Management Division \nMinistry of Agriculture and Primary Industries  \nMinistry of National Planning \nMinistry of Works, Transport and Public Utilities \nnational competitive bidding \nnongovernment organization \nproject management team \nsummary initial environmental examination \ntechnical assistance \n", "NOTE \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars unless otherwise stated. \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "  \nVice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n", "C.
