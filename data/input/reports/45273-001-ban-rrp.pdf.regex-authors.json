I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Financing Brick Kiln Efficiency Improvement \nProject. \n \n2.  The  brick  manufacturing  process  is  energy  intensive  and  is  a  major  source  of \ngreenhouse gas emissions and fine particulate pollution in Bangladesh. The proposed project \nintends to establish a credit facility of $50 million equivalent in local currency at Bangladesh \nBank (central bank) for relending to participating financial intermediaries (PFIs) for the purpose \nof constructing more energy-efficient and environmentally superior brick kilns. The credit facility \nhas two components: (i) to upgrade existing polluting brick kilns to a transitional design to \npreserve sector welfare while immediately reducing pollution, and (ii) to promote the most \nadvanced  brick  kiln  pilots  to  demonstrate  their  operational  and  commercial  viabilities  in \nBangladesh. The combined efforts will help build more energy-efficient brick manufacturing \ncapacities in Bangladesh to transform the sector to a modern and efficient industry.1  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Promoting  energy  efficiency  and  conservation  is  a  part  of  Bangladesh\u2019s  National \nStrategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction II 2009\u20132011. From 1990 to 2011, Bangladesh\u2019s \nreal gross domestic product grew consistently at around 5% per annum.2 During the same \nperiod, the population grew from 109 million to 159 million. As a result, the country\u2019s primary \nenergy consumption rose from 0.25 quad (1015 British thermal units) in 1990 to 0.87 quad in \n2008.3 With increased consumption of carbon-based fuels, the country\u2019s carbon dioxide (CO ) \n2\nemissions per capita doubled from 40 tons in 1990 to 80 tons in 2008.4 High energy intensity \nfrom growing inefficient industrial operations is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions \nand fine particulate pollution in Bangladesh. Brickfields are among the largest industrial polluters. \n \n4.  Brick-making contributes to about 1% of gross domestic product.5 However, due to the \nlack of relevant policy and legislations, the brick sector is poorly regulated. Instead of a small \nnumber of highly efficient modern brickfields, a large number of unqualified small businesses \noperate on the back of outmoded technologies, severe industrial pollution, and poor labor \nstandards. With the current rate of economic growth, the brick sector continues to expand at \nabout 8% per annum,6 and burn about 6.0 million tons of coal and emit about 9.8 million tons of \ncarbon dioxide (CO ).7 In the capital city of Dhaka, the brick sector contributed most to the fine \n2\nparticulate pollution during the operating season (from November to April). There are additional \nland-use  change  emissions  from  (i)  deforestation  by  burning  firewood  (as  a  cheaper \nreplacement to coal), (ii) loss of farmlands and other natural habitats (to construct brick kilns), \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2011.

Ferdausi, S. Vaideeswaran, and S. Akbar. 2008. Greening Brick Making Industries in Bangladesh. Dhaka: The \nWorld Bank. http://www.baq2008.org/system/files/sw38_Ferdausi+presentation.pdf.  ", "2 \n \nand (iii) loss of vegetations from extracting fertile top-soils for brick making.  \n \n 5.  There are six basic types of brick kiln in Bangladesh: (i) bull\u2019s trench kiln, (ii) fixed \nchimney kiln (FCK), (iii) improved zigzag kiln, (iv) vertical shaft brick kiln (VSBK), (v) Hoffman \nkiln, and (vi) tunnel kiln. From (i) to (vi), bull\u2019s trench kiln is the least energy-efficient and most \npolluting, and tunnel kiln is the most energy-efficient and the least polluting. In addition, there \nare modified (or improved) zigzag kiln8 and hybrid Hoffman kiln (HHK), which are based on \ntraditional designs but are more energy-efficient. FCKs can be upgraded to improved zigzag \nkilns  because  of  the  similar  technical  designs.  Currently,  92%  of  the  4,880  brickfields  in \nBangladesh are using the highly polluting FCK design. Improved zigzag kilns, VSBKs, HHKs, \nand tunnel kilns are rare because of the general lack of awareness of these technologies and \nthe inadequate market funding support. \n \n6.  To  improve  environmental  conditions,  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forests  (MOEF) \nissued a directive on 15 July 2010, requiring that (i) no annual FCK licenses be renewed after \nSeptember 2012; (ii) environmental clearance favor more energy-efficient improved zigzag kilns, \nVSBKs and HHKs; and (iii) all FCKs cease to exist from September 2013.9 \n \n7.  The project is designed as a financial intermediary loan to complement the Government \nof Bangladesh directive (para. 6) by catalyzing domestic capital and providing targeted finance \nto build energy-efficient brick kiln replacement capacity, thereby enabling the eventual phase-\nout of FCKs. The proposed credit facility will establish two revolving funds of (i) up to 25 years of \n$30  million  equivalent  local  currency  from  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for upgrading FCKs to improved zigzag kilns and (ii) up to 32 years of \n$20 million equivalent local currency from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for constructing more \nadvanced VSBKs, HHKs, and tunnel kilns.10 \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s support is catalytic. It will support the government\u2019s effort to adjust to more \nenvironmentally friendly production techniques and, through the dissemination of commercially \nviable technologies and close monitoring of safeguard policies, ensure a smooth and orderly \ntransformation of the brick sector. ADB has undertaken extensive stakeholder consultation \nincluding relevant government agencies, brick manufacturing association members, brickfield \nworkers (including female workers), and potential investors in the course of project preparation \nto ensure design viability. \n \n9.  The project will be supported by a capacity development technical assistance (TA) \n(under processing)11 that addresses the brick sector development constraints in policy and \nregulatory formulation, technology awareness-raising, technical and business support, research \nand development, and emerging alternative livelihood needs. The TA is designed to coordinate \nwith development partners and complement the lending assistance to effectively support a more \ncomprehensive and environmentally sustainable brick sector development program. \n  \n                                                \n8  The existing zigzag kiln is not standardized and energy efficiency improvement is uneven. The World Bank is \ndeveloping improved zigzag kiln technical standard with energy efficiency improvement greater than 30%. \n9  Government Directive to Phase Out Fixed Chimney Kilns (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n10 Because the improved zigzag kiln is only a transitional and intermediary technology, at a future point when the \ngovernment phases out support for such a technology, the project steering committee will determine how to utilize \nthe revolving credit facility to exclusively support other more efficient brick kilns. \n11 The ADB Clean Energy Working Group has provided in-principle approval of the $750,000 funding allocation (draft \nCapacity Development Technical Assistance Concept Paper is accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "3 \n \n10.  The demand for ADB funds is strong. Due to the government\u2019s strong commitment to \nuphold its directive to phase out FCKs (para. 6), Bangladesh Brick Manufacturing Owners \nAssociation  (BBMOA)  members  are  compelled  to  upgrade  their  FCKs  to  improved  zigzag \nkilns.12 Although there is a general lack of awareness of more advanced VSBK, HHK, and \ntunnel  kiln  technologies  in  Bangladesh,  the  local  market  for  energy-efficient  brick  kilns  is \ndeveloping, as evidenced by the increasing number of HHK pipeline projects. The TA will also \nprovide technical workshops and media campaigns to disseminate the successful pilot projects\u2019 \ntechnical and commercial viabilities and create continuous demand for ADB funds.13 \n \n11.  The project aligns with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Bangladesh, 2011\u20132015 \nby supporting the environmentally sustainable development.14 The country partnership strategy \nis programmed to support more inclusive and greener economic growth by deepening financial \nmarkets  and  boosting  energy  efficiency,  with  a  significant  emphasis  on  climate  change \nmitigation and adaptation. The project also aligns with ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Operational Plan \nby competitively mobilizing domestic finance for the target sector development.15 The project \nsupports environmentally sustainable growth, which is one of the three strategic agendas of \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.16 As a financial intermediary loan, the project also supports private sector \ndevelopment by providing sustainable growth potential for brick manufacturers and, hence, \ndevelopment of small and medium-sized enterprises. \n \n12.  The project design has been closely coordinated with the related brick sector initiatives. \nThe project complements the industrial energy efficiency finance program of ADB\u2019s Private \nSector Operations Department.17 The joint ADB direct funding support harmonizes with the TA \nprojects and carbon finance scheme from the World Bank and United Nations Development \nProgramme and other initiatives from Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit \n(GIZ International Services).  \n  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact will be improved environmental conditions in Bangladesh. The outcome will \nbe the replacement of polluting FCKs with more energy-efficient kilns in Bangladesh\u2019s brick \nsector. \n \nC.  Output \n14.  The outputs are (i) a designated credit facility, by catalyzing domestic resources, to \n                                                \n12 BBMOA represents a majority of FCK owners. BBMOA submitted an official letter to ADB to reaffirm its members\u2019 \ndesire to access ADB project funds to upgrade FCKs to improved zigzag kilns.

The total financing plan is $100 million (Table 2). The government has requested a loan \nof $30 million from ADB\u2019s OCR and a loan of $20 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \nto help finance the project. The OCR loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 \nyears, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15%, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The Asian Development Fund (ADF) loan has a \nfixed 32-year maturity including a grace period of 8 years, a 1.0% interest charge during the \ngrace period and 1.5% during the amortization period, and equal amortization.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)    Total (%) \nADB ordinary capital resources  30.00    30 \nADB Asian Development Fund  20.00    20 \nSub-borrowers (equity)  30.00    30 \nParticipating financial intermediaries  20.00    20 \n  Total       100.00    100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n17.

PFIs will contribute the remaining \n(at least) 20% of the total subproject cost from other funds at their disposal. The credit facility \nwill comprise two revolving funds, administered by Bangladesh Bank\u2019s Agricultural Credit and \nFinancial  Inclusion  Department  (ACFID),  for  up  to  25  years  and  32  years,  matching  the \nmaturities (and amounts) of the respective ADB OCR and Special Funds sources.

Table  4  summarizes  the  technical  and  commercial  viabilities  of  various  brick \nmanufacturing technologies. In terms of coal consumption per million bricks produced, VSBKs, \nHHKs, and tunnel kilns are the most energy-efficient, using about 100\u2013130 tons of coal. This is \nmore efficient than for FCKs (240 tons) and improved zigzag kilns (180\u2013200 tons). For fine \nparticulate  pollution  per  100,000  bricks  produced,  HHKs  and  tunnel  kilns  (less  than  50 \nmilligrams per cubic meter [mg/m3]) are better than VSBKs (78\u2013187 mg/m3), and significantly \nbetter than improved zigzag kilns (more than 500 mg/m3) and FCKs (more than 1,000 mg/m3). \nCO  emissions for manufacturing 1 million bricks from VSBKs and tunnel kilns (291 tons of CO  \n2 2\n[tCO ]) are lower than from HHKs (315 tCO ), which is lower than from improved zigzag kilns \n2 2\n(440 tCO )  and  FCKs (582 tCO ).  HHKs  and  tunnel kilns  produce  the  best-quality  bricks, \n2 2\nmeasured by the level of pressure resistance of more than 4,500 pounds per square inch (psi) \n(up to 6,000 psi); improved zigzag kilns and VSBKs cannot produce bricks of similar quality.  \n \n23.  In summary, tunnel kiln is the best available technology for producing the highest quality \nbricks  with  the  lowest  environmental  impact.  HHK  is  the  second  best  option.  VSBK  is \nenvironmentally friendly but has a lower commercial viability because of the lower brick quality \nand the smaller production volume. Improved zigzag kiln is more energy-efficient than FCK, but \ninferior in all technical aspects compared to VSBK, HHK, and tunnel kiln.22 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n24.  The project\u2019s economic benefits include the positive externalities produced by the more \nenergy-efficient  brick  kilns  from  (i)  coal  cost  savings,  (ii)  quantified  health  benefits  from \nimproved environmental condition, (iii) clay cost savings from moving towards perforated and \nhollow bricks, (iv) income generated from returning phased-out FCK sites to agricultural use, (v) \nimproved revenue, and (vi) potential carbon credit. The economic internal rate of return is \ncalculated at 38.5% without factoring in the potential carbon credit benefits. By factoring the \ncarbon  credit  benefits,  the  overall  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  85.3%. 23 Sensitivity \nanalysis for 10% increase in capital cost and 10% reduction in incremental benefits would still \nresult to acceptable project economic internal rate of return and economic net present value.  \n \n25.  The financial analysis indicates favorable financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) on an \naverage-sized improved zigzag kiln, VSBK, HHK, and tunnel kiln over a project life cycle of 10 \nyears. The calculation is based on 70:30 debt\u2013equity ratio. The cost of debt is 11% per year \n(pro rata ADB\u2019s funding cost of 9% per annum and market relending cost of 16% per annum) \nand cost of equity is estimated at 15%. The project FIRR for an average improved zigzag kiln is \n34.0%, for a VSBK it is 33.6%, for an HHK it is 37.5%, and for a tunnel kiln it is 35.1%.24 The \npayback periods are 3.7 years for an average improved zigzag kiln, 6.1 years for a VSBK, 5.6 \nyears for an HHK, and 5.4 years for a tunnel kiln. Although the upgrade to an improved zigzag \nkiln has a high investment return, ADB OCR fund is restricted to existing FCK owners and no \nconstruction of greenfield improved zigzag kilns will be financed. All project FIRRs compare \nfavorably to the weighted average cost of capital of 12.2%. \n \n                                                \n22 The design standards of FCKs will be developed by the World Bank, and work is ongoing. Verification of the \ntechnology design standard, including VSBK, HHK, and tunnel kiln, will be provided by DOE, through the support \nfrom proposed capacity development TA, to meet the international best practices. \n23 Financial and Economic Analyses (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 The project FIRR does not factor in the financing cost and is higher than the equity FIRR that factors in the \nfinancing cost. \n ", "8 \n \nC.  Governance \n26.  PFIs shall submit quarterly reports to Bangladesh Bank ACFID on ADB\u2019s fund utilization, \nincluding detailed subloan information: types of technology funded (with certification from DOE), \nsubloan amounts, tenors, interest rates, repayment terms, amortization schedules, repayment \nrecords, and compliance records (e.g., with PFI participation agreement and ADB eligibility \ncriteria). In turn, ACFID will amalgamate the collected information and provide ADB with a \nquarterly report on the overall performance of the credit facility. Bangladesh Bank will ensure \nthat all PFIs comply with the applicable national laws and regulations and will apply the ADB \nprohibited  investment  activities  list  to  all  subprojects  that  are  financed  by  ADB.  The  ADB \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) has been explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment and Bangladesh Bank, and will be explained to PFIs to ensure compliance at sub-\nborrower level. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in \nthe PAM (footnote 20). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  About 750,000 people work in the brick sector in Bangladesh. On average, about 150 \nworkers are employed at each FCK, about 10%\u201320% of whom are women and sometimes \nillegal child laborers. The work is seasonal, occurring during the 6 months of dry season from \nNovember to April. Working conditions are harsh. Because of the low level of mechanical \nautomation, workers endure a high level of manual labor and occupational hazards. Workers\u2019 \nliving conditions are also poor. Living near the polluting kilns aggravates already worsening \npersonal health. \n \n28.  Under the participation agreements with Bangladesh Bank, all PFIs will undertake not to \nfinance any brickfield that violates the core labor standards. A gender action plan will safeguard \nthe well-being of female workers in ADB-funded brickfields.25 The capital investments required \nto fund energy-efficient brick kilns will also improve their mechanical automations and reduce \noccupational hazards. The increased skill sets to operate more advanced HHKs and tunnel kilns \ncould lead to improved labor productivity and higher wage.  \n \n29.  The phase-out of FCKs will however result in the loss of livelihood for some FCK owners \nand workers. To minimize such a negative social impact, the project supports the upgrade of \nFCKs to an intermediate technology of improved zigzag kilns as a transitional measure to \nmodernize the brick sector in Bangladesh. The proposed capacity development TA will help \nfinance the retraining of the affected businesspersons and workers to improve their chances of \nsecuring alternative livelihoods (footnote 11). \n \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  According to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as FI \n(financial  intermediary)  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples. \nSafeguards-related eligibility criteria will eliminate any subproject that is classified as category A \nfor environment or that involves resettlement or affects indigenous peoples.26 Furthermore, \nsubprojects cannot involve in any activity on the prohibited investment activities list indicated in \nthe Safeguard Policy Statement. An environmental and social management system (ESMS) \n                                                \n25 See gender action plan in PAM (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 A safeguard categorization practice will be established at the Bangladesh Bank and PFI level in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Any lack of capacity will be supplemented initially by ongoing TA (footnote 13) \nand subsequently the proposed capacity development TA when it is approved. \n ", "9 \n \narrangement  consistent  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  was  developed  to  guide  the \nproject implementation.27 PFIs will monitor sub-borrowers\u2019 compliances to the developed ESMS \nand submit annual environmental and social performance reports to Bangladesh Bank, which \nwill submit a compiled report to ADB. \n \n31.  An assessment of the capacities of Bangladesh Bank and a potential PFI to manage the \nenvironmental and social issues was conducted as a part of the project due diligence. The result \nshows that potential PFIs may have to strengthen their capacities to monitor sub-borrowers\u2019 \ncompliance  to  the  ADB  ESMS  requirements.  The  proposed  capacity  development  TA  will \nsupport  Bangladesh  Bank  and  PFIs  to  manage  and  implement  the  developed  ESMS \narrangement.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n32.  The project design is based on strong government commitment to enforce the phase-out \nof the polluting FCKs. The technical design specification for improved zigzag kiln is being \nfinalized. ADB plans to provide capacity building to Bangladesh Bank and PFIs to monitor and \nmanage sub-borrowers\u2019 compliance with required ESMS, core labor standards, gender action \nplan, and procurement practices acceptable to ADB. This will also ease ADB\u2019s reputational risk \nworking  in  the  brick  sector that  has to  improve  its  compliance  record  on  basic  safeguard \nstandards. More detailed risk and mitigating measures are provided in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan.28   \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nGovernment\u2019s inability to uphold its directive to  ADB has obtained strong government commitment \nphase out the existing fixed chimney kilns (FCKs).  to maintain its policy direction.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n33.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan documents. \n \n34.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are \nset forth in the loan agreements and project agreement. As a condition to effectiveness, the \ngovernment  and  Bangladesh  Bank must  execute  an  administration  agreement  pursuant  to \nwhich Bangladesh Bank will implement the project by approving and monitoring subprojects and \nmaking the ADB financing available to PFIs.  \n \nV.
