It will help meet \na  key  infrastructure  need  in  Samoa\u2014improve,  sustain,  and  climate-proof  its road  network  and \nboost transport sector governance. \n \nSamoa implemented quarantine measures because of a measles outbreak in late 2019 \n3. \nand the subsequent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which severely curbed economic \nactivity. The declining revenues and the government's stimulus expenditures to protect sectors \nand vulnerable groups led to forecasts of high fiscal deficits. The project is expected to help boost \nthe economy through local employment, tax revenues, and inflows of foreign exchange. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nThe  Government  of  Samoa  requested  assistance  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n4. \n(ADB)  to  upgrade  Central  Cross  Island  Road\u2014a  priority  investment  in  the  transport  sector. \nThe project was originally part of the World Bank\u2019s assessment of critical road links to be covered \nby the Enhanced Road Access Project, which the government implemented in 2015 with World \nBank support, but was not finalized.1 In 2018, the World Bank approved a $35.75 million grant for \nthe Samoa Climate Resilient Transport Project to improve parts of West Coast Road and East \nCoast  Road,  both  identified  as  vulnerable  to  climate  change  impacts.2  ADB  financing  was \nrequested to supplement these efforts to improve the road network infrastructure. This is one of \ntwo ADB-assisted transport projects in Samoa, the other is the Enhancing Safety, Security, and \nSustainability of Apia Port Project.3 \n \n5. \nSamoa\u2019s coastal communities, where 70% of people live and where most public facilities, \neconomic infrastructure, and job opportunities are, rely heavily on coastal roads and cross island \nroads for their transportation needs. The main island, Upolu, features three cross-island roads \nalong  its  eastern,  western,  and  central  parts,  providing  access  and  livelihoods  to  inland \ncommunities. Central Cross Island Road is the key artery connecting West Coast Road in Apia\u2014\nthe  country's  capital,  and  the  island's  main  commercial  center  and  only  deepwater  port\u2014with \nSouth Coast Road in Siumu. It links 7,031 residents and various businesses along a 20 km stretch \nwith Apia and the southern edge of the island. Another 30,784 people living on the south coast \nrely on it as the shortest route to reach jobs and educational and social services in Apia. The two-\nlane carriageway is narrow (4 meters\u20135 meters) and carries up to 6,000 vehicles in average daily \ntraffic along the first 5 km, and up to 1,500 vehicles thereafter. It is costly to maintain; unsafe for \nroad users, particularly during heavy rains; and in urgent need of an upgrade. \n \n6. \nThe  project  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan  and  is  aligned  with \nStrategy  2030  and  its  operational  priorities  of  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing \n\n \n\n1   World Bank. 2013. Samoa Enhanced Road Access Project. Washington, DC.  \n2  World Bank. 2018. Samoa Climate Resilient Transport Project. Washington, DC. \n3  ADB.  2019.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Grant  to  the \nIndependent State of Samoa for the Enhancing Safety, Security and Sustainability of Apia Port Project. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fRationale \n\ninequalities; accelerating progress in gender equality; tackling climate change, building climate \nand disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; making cities more livable; \nand strengthening governance and institutional capacity.4 \n \nA. \n \n7. \nA significant portion of the project road has fallen into disrepair and become unsafe for \ncommuters and for pedestrians walking alongside. This is especially an issue along the first 3 km \nof the road, a semi-urban area where school and college students dominate pedestrian traffic. \nTropical Cyclone Evan in 2012 caused significant damage to Samoa\u2019s transport infrastructure, \nincluding  the  project  road.  The  government  has  since  restored  some  of  the  worst-hit  sections \n(3.67 km) of it, but the road remains narrow and lacks adequate pedestrian facilities in semi-urban \nareas,  drainage  is  deficient  along  its  entire  length,  and  the  road  alignment  in  hilly  sections  is \nunsafe, all of which creates significant hazards, particularly in wet conditions. The project road is \nalso  an  alternative  route  between  the  northern  and  southern  coasts  for  evacuation  during  a \ncyclone and for post-disaster relief. Hence, the upgrade of this critical link will contribute to a safer \nroad network and increase the island\u2019s climate and disaster resilience. \n \n8. \nSamoa\u2019s economy is based on subsistence primary production. Crops, livestock, fisheries, \nand forestry account for 42% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product and for 75% of employment. \nTourism is growing and represents 25% of gross domestic product. According to the Central Bank \nof Samoa, it is a key driver of economic development because it provides a large number of jobs \nand generates foreign exchange. The socioeconomic benefits of the road upgrade are expected \nto  comprise  (i) faster  and  safer  access  to  public  services,  including schools  and  medical  care; \n(ii) more  enrollments  in  tertiary  education;  and  (iii)  greater  economic  activity  from  better \nconnectivity,  which  in  turn  benefits  tourism  and  increases  employment  for  rural  communities. \nThe upgrade is expected to lessen the burden on women in meeting their transport-dependent \nhousehold,  productive,  and  community  obligations.  Women  will  also  benefit  from  better \nopportunities for micro businesses and tourism-related activities. \n \n9. \nThe Ministry of Works, Transport and Infrastructure (MWTI) sets the sector policies, and \noversees and regulates infrastructure and services through its land transport, civil aviation, and \nmaritime transport divisions. Established under the Land Transport Authority Act 2007, the Land \nTransport Authority (LTA) is responsible for the planning, design, supervision, construction, and \nmaintenance  of  national  roads  and  land  transport  infrastructure;  and  also  manages  road  use. \nThis includes  promoting  vehicle  safety  and  safe  user  behavior,  regulating  the  transport  of \npassengers and goods by road, and managing traffic. The LTA funds capital investment projects \nfrom the national budget, and the World Bank provides grant funds for road rehabilitation works. \n \n10. \nIn  carrying  out  its  duties,  the  LTA  benefits  from  the  World  Bank\u2019s  long-standing \ninvolvement in Samoa\u2019s road transport development and its considerable experience. The Samoa \nClimate  Resilient  Transport  Project  (footnote  2)  will  contribute  to  the  sustainability  of  road \ninfrastructure investments by providing the LTA with sector and spatial planning tools to manage \nits  road  assets,  climate  change  vulnerability  assessments,  and  a  centralized  database  for \nrecording accidents. Moreover, in light of government agencies\u2019 ineffective project management \nin  the  past,  which  resulted  in  lengthy  procurement  and  poor  contract  management,  the  World \nBank  project  will  provide  technical  advisors  to  strengthen  the  Aid  Coordination  and  Debt \nManagement  Division  (ACDMD)  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  and  the  Transport  and \n\n4  ADB. 2019.

Manila. \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fProject Description \n\nInfrastructure Sector Coordination Division (TISCD) set up under the MWTI, as well as technical \nsupport to the LTA. \n \n11. \nLand  registration  information  in  Samoa  has  not  been  updated  in  pace  with  modern \ngeodetic systems, and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MNRE) has limited \nland  survey  and  information  management  capacity.  This  causes  delays  in  defining  property \nboundaries  and resulted  in  incomplete  data  on road rights-of-way.  Accurate  topographical  and \nboundary surveys are required to optimize road designs and avoid or minimize the need for land \nacquisition.  The  World  Bank  project  is  extending  support  to  the  MNRE  to  strengthen  its  land \nadministration system. The ADB project will complement these efforts by helping strengthen the \ncapacities of the MWTI and the LTA. \n \nB. \n \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts,  as  per  Goal  1  and  Goal  2  of  the \n12. \nGovernment\u2019s  Transport  Sector  Plan  2014\u20132019  (TSP):5\n  (i)  transport  sector  governance \nframework  strengthened;  and  (ii)  road  transport  network  improved,  sustained,  and  climate-\nproofed.  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  Central  Cross  Island  Road  made  more \nsustainable, more efficient, more climate-resilient, and safer.6 \n \nOutput  1:  Central  Cross  Island  Road  upgraded  and  made  safer.  This  output  will \n13. \nfinance  the  upgrade  of  about  20  km  of  national  road  incorporating  climate-resilient  drainage \nfacilities  to  withstand  increased  rainfall  intensity;  and  road  safety  measures  for  the  safe \nmanagement  of  pedestrian  and  vehicular  traffic,  particularly  at  times  of  heavier  pedestrian \nmovements near schools and poor visibility because of climatic conditions. The project team will \nbuild road features that specifically cater to the requirements and welfare of women, vulnerable \nroad users, and nonmotorized traffic. This includes 8.4 km of footpaths, 18 streetlights, 18 safe \nbus  stops,  and  11 pedestrian  crossings.  The  additions  will  collectively  contribute  to  greater \ndisaster  preparedness  by  making  the  road  safely  traversable  in  poor  climatic  conditions.  The \nproject  attempts  to  reduce  the  carbon  footprint  during  construction  by  piloting  an  alternative \nbuilding method, i.e., recycling the existing road pavement instead of using raw materials from \nquarries; this will contribute to overall road industry sustainability. \n \n14. \nOutput  2:  Maintenance  of  Central  Cross  Island  Road  improved.  This  output  will \nfinance routine maintenance for three years starting immediately after the completion of the road \nupgrade.  It  involves  performance-based  contracting  of  national  contractors  and  community \nparticipation, targeting 30% of the contracted workforce to be women. \n \n15. \nOutput  3:  Institutional  capacity  to  manage  the  road  network  strengthened. \nThis output  will  finance  capacity  strengthening  to  complement  the  World  Bank\u2019s  initiatives. \nADB financing  will  cover  (i)  the  engagement  of  an  additional  four  nationally  contracted  TISCD \nstaff for procurement, gender, safeguards, financial management, and monitoring and evaluation, \nto  support  four  specialists  already  provided  through  the  World  Bank  project;  (ii)  training  to  the \nMWTI and LTA in project management, procurement, gender aspects, safeguards management, \nand  public  communications;  and  (iii)  additional  measures  to  build  women\u2019s  capacity  and \nleadership, such as (a) the formulation of the LTA\u2019s first institutional gender strategy to increase \nwomen\u2019s employment and their support in the workplace, (b) targets to include women in technical \ntraining,  and  (c)  a  gender-sensitive  communication  campaign  on  road  and  transport  safety \n\n5  MWTI. 2014.

ADB will finance \n100% of the project costs associated with these measures. This is the first major road project in \nSamoa to receive ADB support in tandem with World Bank efforts to improve the country\u2019s road \nnetwork.  Without  ADB\u2019s  support,  this  important  cross-island  link  would  not  receive  its  long \noverdue upgrade. The project\u2019s communication strategy includes participatory methods to ensure \nthat the road design is responsive to the needs of the road users and that adequate information \nis provided in a manner and form accessible to them, to mitigate disruptions during construction. \nThe  strategy  also  includes  behavior  change  communication  to  engage  road  users  in  safety \ncampaigns for motorists and pedestrians in various phases of project implementation. \n \nD. \n \n17. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $55.0  million  (Table  1).

MOF will be the executing agency, and the implementing agencies will be the MWTI, LTA, \nand MNRE. MOF will provide overall oversight, monitoring, and reporting through the ACDMD. \nThe LTA will manage the project day-to-day in accordance with ADB\u2019s applicable guidelines. The \nMWTI\u2019s  TISCD  is  responsible  for  the  overall  project  coordination.  LTA  will  have  overall \nresponsibility in managing land acquisition.

To avoid COVID-19-related procurement delays, \ne-procurement will be used for the tender of the civil works packages. The Samoa Port Authority \nhas been using the Tenderlink network for the earlier ADB-financed project (footnote 3), and the \nLTA will use the Tenderlink system registered with the MOF. The ACDMD will ensure compliance \nwith the timely submission of audited project financial statements to ADB. Retroactive financing \nwill be used to allow contract signing and mobilization of the construction supervision consultant \nprior to grant effectiveness. The selection of the consultant is ongoing, and civil works bidding will \nstart in the fourth quarter of 2020. \n \n21. \nThe project preparation team undertook a comprehensive procurement risk assessment \nand a detailed supply market analysis to underpin value-for-money considerations when choosing \nprocurement arrangements. The project will achieve the best value for money by (i) using the e-\nprocurement  technology  to  lower  transaction  costs  and  ensure  transparency;  (ii)  attracting \ninternational and national contracting firms to the tender to ensure an optimal range of capacities \nfor  delivering  quality  civil  works\u2014the  open  competitive  bidding  being  in two  packages,  one for \ninternational  advertisement  ($19.1  million),  the  other  for  national  advertisement  of  two  lots  of \n$2.65 million each; and (iii) procuring international consulting firms through the quality- and cost-\nbased  selection  to  ensure  high-quality services.

To ensure climate resilience, the roadside drainage \ndesign  is  informed  by  hydrology  and  hydraulic  analysis  considering  extreme  climatic  events. \nThe civil works will include (i) minor realignments and widening of the narrow carriageway (now \n4 meters\u20135 meters) for safe speeds of 40 km/hour in urban sections and 60 km/hour in nonurban \nsections; (ii) reconstruction of the road pavement for a 20-year design life\u2014asphalt for the traffic \ncarriageway (7.0 meters wide), hard shoulders and utility verge in urban areas (4.5 meters wide), \nand  unsealed  shoulders  in  nonurban  areas  (2.0  meters  wide)\u2014and  reconstruction  of  the  sub-\n\n \n\n\fbase and base course layers to carry the projected traffic loads; (iii) construction of road safety \nand  roadside  facilities  with  features  that  are  gender-sensitive  and  user-friendly  for  vulnerable \npeople; and (iv) reconstruction and provision of new cross- and side drains to protect the road \nfrom climate-change-induced extreme rainfall events with high intensity and prolonged rainfalls.10 \n \n25. \nAn  assessment  of  road  safety  measures  by  the  International  Road  Assessment \nProgramme recommended higher road safety standards with at least a 3-star rating based on its \nrating system.11 The road design includes guardrails, streetlights, separate pedestrian footpath \nalong urban sections and in areas where pedestrian traffic is high, road signage and markings, \nbus bays, and vehicle speed-calming measures near schools and public markets. The detailed \ndesign also meets universal access requirements, such as wheelchair access to footpath and bus \nstops. A community consultation process was developed to determine suitable locations for bus \nshelters, lighting, and other facilities. Separate road safety campaigns for communities and drivers \nwill also be implemented. \n \n26. \nThe road design incorporates innovative technologies to reduce the carbon footprint of the \nproject, minimize costs, and  increase resilience  to  excessive rainwater  penetration  of  the  road \nembankment. The detailed design provides for the cement stabilization of shoulders in nonurban \nroad  sections.  Pavement  recycling  is  widely  used  in  the  United  States  and  other  developed \ncountries, and allows a reduction in a road project\u2019s carbon footprint, cuts construction time and \ncosts, and minimizes traffic disruptions during construction. This method is not so widely used in \nADB-financed  projects  due  to  limitations  in  local  standards,  perceived  risks,  and  lack  of \nknowledge and even less so in small Pacific islands where construction materials are scarce. The \nproject incorporates this technology by allowing alternative technical solutions during the bidding \nfor civil works. The bidding documents include specifications for reclamation of existing pavement \nmaterials to  be placed as a road base. The technology reduces carbon emissions significantly \nduring construction by minimizing the extraction, transport, and placement of quarried materials. \n \nB. \n \n27. \nThe project was not tested for its financial viability because it is not revenue-generating. \nThe economic analysis was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic \nAnalysis of Projects. The evaluation of annual streams of project economic costs and associated \nbenefits under a baseline scenario yields an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 14.8%, \nand  an  economic  net  present  value  of  $20.33  million.  This  confirms  the  project\u2019s  economic \nviability, since it exceeds ADB\u2019s minimum required EIRR for investment projects of 9%. \n \n28. \nQuantifiable benefits include reductions in vehicle operating costs and time savings from \ntraveling on the upgraded road, as well as fewer accidents and lower road agency costs because \nof greater road safety and more resilience to extreme climate events. The project is expected to \nreduce road deaths and severe injuries by 46%, bringing down the ratio of fatalities per year from \n0.59 to 0.32, and the ratio of fatalities and severe injuries per year from 6.5 to 3.5.12 Unquantified \nbenefits from the project include (i) less vulnerability to climatic events because of the availability \nof a reliable all-weather rescue route in case of disasters triggered by extreme weather; (ii) large \npotential gains in induced traffic, driven by a decline in vehicle operating costs and complementary \ndevelopments to stimulate socioeconomic and tourism activity; (iii) better health and education \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n10 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 International Road Assessment Programme \u2013 Assessment of Central Cross Island Road, Samoa (accessible from \n\n \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n12 Economic  and  Financial  Analysis \nhttps://www.irap.org/methodology. \n\n(accessible \n\nfrom \n\nthe \n\nlist  of \n\nlinked  documents \n\nin  Appendix  2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\foutcomes  resulting  from  better  access  to  health  and  school  facilities;  and  (iv) generation  of \nemployment opportunities from improved access to markets. \n \n29. \nThe project\u2019s sensitivity to changes in cost, demand, and benefits were tested (Table 4). \nGiven the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the project was tested for a simultaneous 20% increase \nin construction costs and a 20% drop in traffic levels.

Managing the road network is the responsibility of the LTA. Until June 2020, it was a public \ntrading  body  under  the  Public  Bodies  (Performance  and  Accountability)  Act  2001,  remitting  a \ndividend  to  the  government  each  year,  such  as  ST102,309  ($39,034  equivalent)  in  fiscal  year \n(FY) 2017.13 The key sustainability parameter for road investments is the government\u2019s ability to \nprovide  a  sufficient  level  of  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  funding  over  the  life  of  the \nupgraded road, especially as the LTA becomes entirely dependent on budgetary allocations. The \nsustainability of an investment will be assured through maintenance over its life cycle only if two \nkey  constraints  are  systematically  removed:  (i)  insufficient  maintenance  funding,  and  (ii) \ninadequate  maintenance  practices  that  cause  premature  road  deterioration.  The  LTA\u2019s  main \nsources of funds have been government and external grants through the national budget (about \n60%) and retained revenues from fees and charges (40%). \n \n31. \nTo manage a national road network of 1,255.7 km (816.5 km on Upolu and 439.2 km on \nSavaii), with 139 river-crossing structures (46 bridges, 19 fords, and 35 large culverts on Upolu; \nand  8  bridges,  19  fords,  and  12  large  culverts  on  Savaii),14  the  LTA  has  spent  an  average  of \nST32.8 million ($14.5 million equivalent) per annum from the national budget, of which ST13.6 \nmillion ($6.0 million equivalent) per annum (41%) was spent on capital works (including cyclone \nrehabilitation); and ST19.2 million ($8.5 million equivalent) per annum (59%) on routine, periodic, \nand emergency maintenance during 2013\u20132017. This is in addition to expenditure funded from \nexternal  grants.  The  budget  allocations  during  FY2016\u2013FY2020  increased  from  about  ST13 \nmillion ($5.7 million equivalent) to ST19 million ($8.4 million equivalent), but are still short of the \nST35 million ($15.5 million equivalent) yearly target set in the TSP.15 \n \n\n \n\n13 Government directive dated 27 May 2020 changing the LTA\u2019s status to public beneficiary body. \n14 Updated figures are from a preliminary draft by the LTA following careful reconciliation of data sources. Adam Smith \n\nInternational. 2018. Renewals and Depreciation Funding Gap Assessment. London (July). \n\n15 The  ongoing  Renewals  and  Depreciation  Funding  Gap  Assessment,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Australia,  is \nreassessing the annual costs of asset depreciation. Its findings, coupled with the data from the Samoa Road Asset \nManagement System, will allow a reevaluation of the level of annual maintenance needed. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fGenerally, the LTA strikes a reasonable balance between the need to preserve, repair, \n32. \nand upgrade its road assets. In FY2017, the LTA managed 24 grass-cutting contracts, 7 drainage \nmaintenance contracts, 1 traffic signal maintenance contract, and 22 routine road maintenance \ncontracts. The routine maintenance contracts were organized by zone (12 on Upolu and 10 on \nSavaii),  had  2-year  contract  periods  (introduced  for  the  first  time  in  FY2017),  and  involved \nperformance-based  payments.  Contractors  are  registered  annually;  in  FY2019,  18  contractors \nwere registered for routine maintenance contracts on Upolu, and 13 for Savaii. \n \nThe project will finance performance-based routine maintenance for 3 years from the end \n33. \nof construction, and capacity building in tandem with the World Bank\u2019s ongoing efforts (para. 9) \nto  increase  the  LTA\u2019s  long-term  ability  to  manage  the  road  network  beyond  project \nimplementation.  More  specifically,  the  joint  focus  will  be  on  optimizing  the  LTA\u2019s  asset \nmaintenance strategies. \n \n34. \nSamoa\u2019s relatively small economic base does not generate sufficient revenues for funding \nall  sectors,  hence  unconventional  O&M  funding  sources  would  have  to  be  sought.  Like  other \nPacific countries, Samoa is disproportionately affected by the rising sea levels and the increase \nin extreme climatic events. At the same time, road transport generates about one-quarter of all \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, more than other sectors and subsectors.16 The GHG modeling \ndone for the project using the Highway Development and Management 4 (HDM-4) model predicts \nthat a reduction of about 14,000 tons of GHG can be achieved over the project life cycle (20 years) \nif  optimal  preventive  maintenance  regimes  are  applied  to  arrest  premature  road  deterioration, \ne.g.,  keeping  traffic  operations  close  to  optimal  speeds  and  reducing  carbon  emissions. \nThis presents a potential to access carbon finance for O&M through new market mechanism(s) \nunder  Article  6  of  the  Paris  Agreement,  which  is  still  under  negotiation  under  the  aegis  of  the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. However, this would depend on the \nproject  meeting  eligibility  criteria  under  the  Paris  Rulebook.  In  any  case,  the  project  will  help \nstrengthen Samoa\u2019s policies and regulations on reducing GHG emissions from road transport.17 \n \nD. \n \n35. \nThe transport sector\u2019s strengths include a strong and effective policy framework supported \nby well-established procedures and guidelines; a well-structured and streamlined public sector, \nwith responsibilities defined and an appropriate arm\u2019s-length relationship between regulator and \nservice providers; a well-educated and motivated public sector workforce; and respect for the law. \nWeaknesses  include  a  lack  of  up-to-date  data  on  road  and  traffic  conditions,  resulting  in  an \ninability to assess the effectiveness of maintenance plans and works for the road network as a \nwhole;  and  institutional  capacity  limitations,  largely  stemming  from  lack  of  experience. \nThe priorities  for  capacity  development  lie  mainly  with  minimizing  sustainability  risks  through \nbetter  life  cycle  maintenance  planning  and  designs  that  ensure  resilience  to  climate-change \nimpacts,  and  incorporating  better  safety  features  in  road  designs,  including  the  safety  of \npedestrians and other vulnerable road users. \n \nThe financial management assessment of the project found that MOF, as the executing \n36. \nagency and as the representative of the assistance recipient, is familiar with ADB\u2019s procedures \nand reporting requirements and has sufficiently robust financial management policies, systems, \nand procedures to meet ADB\u2019s requirements for the project. It will administer the advance account \n\nGovernance \n\n16 MNRE. 2015. Samoa\u2019s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution.

However, staff at the key implementing agencies\u2014MWTI, MNRE, and \nLTA\u2014are  unfamiliar  with  ADB\u2019s  procedures.  The  financial  management  risks  associated  with \nthese agencies are rated moderate.18 Actions to mitigate this weakness include workshops under \nthe project to explain ADB\u2019s financial management and disbursement requirements to the staff of \nMOF (ACDMD), the MWTI (TISCD), and the LTA to complement the earlier support by the World \nBank to establish and staff these centralized units (footnote 2). The project will also bolster the \nTISCD team by providing four more staff to support ADB-funded projects. MOF, the MWTI, and \nthe LTA agreed to implement financial management actions to strengthen their capacity. \n \n37. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  MOF,  MNRE,  LTA  and  MWTI.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 8). Integrity due diligence was conducted on the \nLTA. No significant integrity risks were detected. \n \nE. \n \nThe project will particularly benefit the communities and businesses along the upgraded \n38. \nroad that rely on it to access economic opportunities (jobs, markets) and essential social services \n(schools, hospitals), which tend to be in Apia. Safer vehicle traffic, shorter travel times, and a safer \npedestrian environment, due to the footpaths and other new features, will reduce road accidents \nand improve mobility, especially for vulnerable groups such as women, school children, and the \ndisabled.  While  tourists  continue  to  travel  to  the  seaside  resorts  along  the  coastal  road,  an \nupgraded  cross-island  road  is  likely  to  encourage  more  locals  to  enjoy  the  seaside  and  more \ntourists to venture inland, which in turn stimulates economic activities. \n \n39. \nThis project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. Women\u2019s concerns and needs \nvoiced  during  gender  analysis  and consultations are reflected  in  the road  design  with features \nsuch  as  lighting,  pedestrian  footpaths,  covered  bus  shelters,  speed  signs,  speed  bumps,  and \ngender-sensitive road safety training in schools and for village groups. To prevent gender-based \nviolence  (including  sexual  harassment),  the  contractors  will  be  required  to  provide  mandatory \ntraining to all their staff on sexual exploitation and abuse, and HIV awareness. Women and girls \nhighlighted that they often feel unsafe on public transport. To rectify this, a campaign to prevent \nsexual  harassment  on  buses  will  be  implemented.  In  addition,  analysis  will  be  undertaken  to \ndefine and address those gender dimensions of commuter safety that are under the jurisdiction \nof  the  LTA.  The  project will  also  support the  LTA  in  developing  its  first  institutional  strategy  to \nmanage  gender  issues  in  the  workplace,  which  includes  gender  training  and  plans  to  support \nmore  women  in  the  workplace.  Finally,  income-generating  opportunities  for  women  will  be \nprovided through construction (10% of roles for women) and road maintenance (30% of roles for \nwomen). The project will also provide indirect benefits to women and girls by improving access to \npublic services such as education and health. \n \nF. \n \n40. \ncategories are as follows.19 \n \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\n18 Normally, an entity with limited experience in ADB procedures would be rated as posing a higher risk, but the planned \ncoordinating arrangements involving the ACDMD and TISCD, both supported by external advisors in critical project \nmanagement roles, will help reduce this risk.  \n\n19 ADB.

The impacts of the upgrading, drainage, and resealing works \n41. \non a 20 km section of existing road will be site-specific, largely created during construction, and \nmost  of \nimpacts  can  be  readily  mitigated  or  managed. \nThe environmental assessment found that the road runs through urban and rural areas of Apia, \nboth  already  highly  modified,  and  briefly  transverses  a  wider  area  designated  as  Apia \nCatchment\u2019s  key  biodiversity  area;  it  is  also  an  important  bird  area  that  supports  endemic, \nendangered, or significant species. About 7 km of the road traverse disturbed forest and mountain \nforest within the boundary of the Apia Catchment\u2019s key biodiversity area. All construction works \nwill be entirely confined to the footprint of the road's existing right-of-way and to a degraded habitat \nwithin 1 km, which are not identified as natural habitats even though they are part of a wider area \ndesignated as critical habitat. The degraded vegetative zone between the road corridor and the \nnon-degraded forest may have habitat values, but does not satisfy the criteria for critical habitat. \nThe detailed assessment demonstrates that threatened species are unlikely to interact with the \nproject footprint, preferring to use less-disturbed habitats further away from the road. No net loss \nof critical habitat is likely to occur as a result of the project. The existing road and the proposed \nroad  upgrade  (construction  limit-of-works)  do  not  impinge  on  any  areas  of  non-degraded  or \nundisturbed forest. The assessment concludes that (i) the project can meet the three thresholds \nfor allowing a project to go ahead in an area of critical habitat; (ii) there are no significant adverse \nenvironmental  impacts;  and  (iii)  expected  impacts  will  be  construction-related,  localized,  and \nmanageable  if  the  mitigation  measures  are  implemented  and  closely  monitored.  As  a \nprecautionary  basis,  the  contractor  will  be  required  to  develop  a  biodiversity  action  plan,  and \nprovisions  are  included  in  the  environmental  monitoring  plan  (EMP)  to  ensure  that  all  lesser \nimpacts originating from project-related activities are mitigated to achieve at least no net loss of \nbiodiversity (i.e., no actual harm, nor loss, nor degradation of habitat). \n \n42. \nThe civil works will be tendered as two contract packages, and successful contractors will \nprepare their construction EMP based on the final EMP (updated at the detailed design stage) \nwith details of their construction methods and their approach to the main construction elements, \nthe  risk  assessment,  and  the  mitigation  measures.20  The  LTA,  supported  by  the  construction \nsupervision consultant, will review and approve the construction EMP of each contractor prior to \nthe start of any physical works (including site clearance) on any section. The consulting team will \ninclude  at  least  30  person-months  of  environmental  and  health  and  safety  specialists  to  work \nclosely with the LTA\u2019s safeguards officer. \n \n43. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). The upgrade, including widening the road to a \n16-meter wide corridor, will require land acquisition and clearance of fences, hedges, trees, and \nsome  small  structures  belonging  to  temporary  roadside  vendors.  The  project  will  need  about \n130,322  square  meters  of  land,  affecting  159  land  lots.  It  will  also  require  an  extension  of  the \neasement areas, totaling 6,021 square meters. However, there will be no requirement to change \nthe  ownership  of  this  land.  The  project  will  not  result  in  impacts  on  residential  or  commercial \nstructures, so no forced physical displacement will take place. \n \n44. \nA draft resettlement plan was prepared based on the detailed designs and disclosed on \nADB's website. During project preparation, community consultations were held in accordance with \nthe  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  and  those  requirements  shall  continue  to  be  met  during  the \nfinalization and implementation of the resettlement plan. Detailed measurement surveys and an \ninventory of losses were initiated in consultation with all affected persons. The TISCD and the \n\n20 This will include a health and safety plan aligned with the World Health Organization's 2020 considerations for public \nhealth  and  social  measures  in  the  workplace  in  the  context  of  COVID-19.  https://www.who.int/publications-\ndetail/considerations-for-public-health-and-social-measures-in-the-workplace-in-the-context-of-covid-19. \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nLTA will be responsible for the overall monitoring and supervision of safeguard activities, while \nthe MNRE will lead the land acquisition and compensation for all affected assets. The supervision \nteam  will  have  at  least  25  person-months  of  social  safeguard,  gender,  and  communication \nspecialists who will assist the TISCD, LTA, and MNRE during project implementation. A grievance \nredress mechanism will be implemented by the LTA, as outlined in the draft resettlement plan. \n \n45. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). The project beneficiaries are not considered as being \neither  distinct  from  mainstream  society  or  vulnerable.  Nonetheless,  all  project  activities  will  be \nundertaken in a culturally appropriate manner. \n \nG. \n \nThe project risks were identified based on lessons learned by ADB and the World Bank in \n46. \nSamoa.  None  of  the  risks  were  assessed  as  being  highly  likely  or  having  the  potential  to \nsignificantly  alter  project  outputs  and  outcome.  The  detailed  risk  assessments  are  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan and project procurement risk assessment.21 ADB\u2019s own \nexperience in Samoa indicates that land acquisition is generally complex and time-consuming. \nThe  level  of  project  readiness,  stakeholder  consultations  conducted  to  formulate  a  draft \nresettlement plan, and project resources allotted to ensuring continued support to acquire the land \nrequired  for  the  project  helped  bring  the  associated  level  of  risk  significantly  down. \nAffected persons are supportive of the upgrade. \n \n47. \nThe LTA\u2019s recent assessment indicates an O&M funding shortfall of about 30%. This is a \nsubstantial risk, which will be mitigated by the government's commitment to allocate ST35 million \nto the LTA to cover for O&M in line with the requirements of the TSP. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nThe Government through MOF and LTA have assured ADB that the implementation of the \n48. \nproject  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  requirements,  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  financial \nmanagement, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM and grant documents. \n \n49. \nthe project, which are set forth in the draft grant and project agreements. \n \n\nThe Government through MOF and LTA have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n50. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the grant not exceeding \n$40,000,000  to  the  Independent  State  of  Samoa  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian \nDevelopment Fund) for the Central Cross Island Road Upgrading Project, on terms and conditions \nthat are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft grant and project agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n\nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n\n21 Risk  Assessment  and  Risk  Management  Plan,  and  Project  Procurement  Risk  Assessment  of  Samoa\u2019s  Land \n\nTransport Authority (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n 9 November 2020\n\n \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with  \nTransport sector governance framework strengthened (Transport Sector Plan, 2014\u20132019)a \nRoad transport network improved, sustained, and climate-proofed (Transport Sector Plan, 2014\u20132019)a \n\n \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nCentral Cross Island \nRoad made more \nsustainable, more \nefficient, more \nclimate resilient, and \nsafer \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n13 \n\nRisks \n\n \nClimate change risks \nare underestimated. \n \nSpeed limitation \nmeasures are not \nadequately enforced. \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n \na.\u2013b.
