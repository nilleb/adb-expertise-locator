The Investment Program will include (i) projects to improve \nabout 1,400 km of the HCRN, to be funded through four or more \ntranches  under \n(MFF); \n(ii)  design  and  supervision  of \nimprovement  works, \npreparation  and  administration  of  long-term  road  maintenance \ncontracts  for  the  entire  2,500  km  of  the  HCRN,  and  capacity \ndevelopment  of \nthe \nsocioeconomic  benefits  of  the  improved  and  maintained  roads  in \nthe  Highlands  region.  Support  will  also  be  provided  for  policies \nsuch as road user charges (to increase the resources available for \nroad  maintenance).  In  addition,  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  be \nprovided to support the Department of Transport to prepare a new \nNational Transport Development Plan (NTDP) for 2011\u20132020. \n \nADB\u2019s multitranche financing facility is the most suitable modality \nfor  financing  the  Investment  Program  because:  (i)  it  supports  the \nGovernment\u2019s  long-term  vision  for  the  sector,  as  outlined  in  the \ncurrent NTDP, 2006\u20132010; (ii) it enables ADB to sustain the long-\nterm  partnership \nroad \nis  needed \nmaintenance;  (iii)  it  allows  ADB  to  strengthen  and  improve  the \nNTDP and actively to pursue policy dialogue throughout the life of \nthe Investment Program; (iv) it responds to the long-term capacity \ndevelopment needs of the road agencies; (v) it provides flexibility \nto  the  Government  in  terms  of  timing  and  the  size  of  the \ninvestments  for  each  tranche;  (vi)  it  provides  an  opportunity  to \napply  lessons  from  early  tranches  to  guide  subsequent  tranches \nand \nimplementation \nefficiency;  and  (vii)  it  provides  comfort  to  private  companies \ninterested in pursuing long-term opportunities in the road sector. \n \nThe Highlands region is a major contributor to the PNG economy \nthrough its agricultural and mineral exports. It is also home to 40% \nof  the  country\u2019s  population,  who  rely  almost  exclusively  on  the \n\nfor  reforms  and \n\ninstitutionalize \n\nincentives \n\ninclude \n\nthat \n\nto \n\nto \n\n\fii \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nInvestment Plan \n\nroad  network  for  movement  of  people  and  goods.  The  road \nnetwork  is  vulnerable  because  of  the  mountainous  terrain,  the \nfragile  geological  conditions,  and  the  climate.  The  Government \nand  its  development  partners  have  invested  significantly  in \nimproving the road network, but a lack of regular maintenance has \nleft the network in a poor condition. There is a need to (i) initiate a \nprogram  of  regular  maintenance  on  all  HCRN  roads  that  are  in \ngood  condition,  and  (ii)  improve  those  HCRN  roads  that  are  in  a \npoor  condition  and  ensure  that  routine  maintenance  begins  on \nthese roads as soon as the improvement works are done.  \n \nThe current NTDP provides a framework of policies and strategies \nfor  a  sustainable  road  system  in  PNG.  It  has  led  to  the \nestablishment  of \nthe  National  Roads  Authority  (NRA)  with \nresponsibility  for  maintaining  the  road  network  and  a  road  fund \nfinanced through road user charges to finance road maintenance. \nThe  NRA  and  the  road  fund  are  managed  by  an  independent \nboard,  with  representatives  from  road  users,  the  private  sector, \nand the Government. There is a need to translate these initiatives \ninto a workable system by (i) strengthening the NRA\u2019s capacity to \nplan  and  manage  road  maintenance  works,  (ii)  seeking  more \nfinancing for the road fund by rationalizing road user charges, and \n(iii)  awarding  long-term  performance-based  road  maintenance \ncontracts.  With  a  functioning  board  and  staff  recruitment  for  the \nNRA  underway,  the  Government  is  keen  to  support  the  MFF.  It \nwill  help  to  enable  implementation  of  the  NTDP  and  to  ensure  a \nsustainable  road  system  in  the  Highlands  region.  This  initiative \ncould serve as model for other regions of PNG.   \n \nThe Investment Program will make ports, markets, and livelihood \nopportunities  more  accessible,  and  will  lead  to  savings  in  travel \ntime and transport costs. It will enable use of the natural, mineral \nand  human  resources  of  the  Highlands  region  to  be  maximized, \ncontributing  to  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development \nStrategy  (MTDS),  2005\u20132010  objectives  of  (i)  export-driven \neconomic  growth;  (ii)  rural  development  and  poverty  reduction; \n(iv)  promotion  of  sustainable \n(iii)  good  governance;  and \nagriculture, forestry, fisheries, and tourism.  \n \nThe  total  Investment  Program  cost  is  estimated  at  $750  million \nequivalent.  The  total  cost  of  Project  1,  including  taxes,  duties, \nphysical,  and  price  contingencies,  interest,  and  other  charges  is \nestimated at $140 million equivalent. \n \n\n\f \n\nInvestment Program \n\niii \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n562.80 \n40.75 \n146.45 \n750.00 \n\nAmount  \n($ million) \n \n\n80.20 \n0.40 \n\n25.80 \n5.20 \n5.80 \n117.40 \n19.74 \n2.86 \n140.00 \n\n \nRoad Improvements \nProgram Support and Capacity Development \nProgram Administration and Other Costs \nTotal \n\nItem \nA. \nB. \nC. \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n \n\nProject 1 \n\n \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n\n \nBase Cost \n1.

The Government will provide counterpart financing of \n$200  million  equivalent,  and  co-financing  of  $150  million \nequivalent is expected. \n \nTo  help  finance  Project  1,  the  first  tranche  will  comprise  of  two \nloans  totaling  $100.0  million  equivalent  from  Special  Funds \nresources (a \u201chard-term\u201d ADF loan of $28.8 million equivalent and \na \u201csoft-term\u201d ADF loan of $71.2 million equivalent), to help finance \nProject  1.  The  ADB  loans  will  finance  71%  of  the  total  cost  of \nProject 1. The ADF concessionary loans will both have a term of \n32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  interest  under  the \nhard-term loan will be at 3.15% per annum for the life of the loan \nwhile interest under the soft-term loan will be at 1.0% per annum \nduring  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  Other \nterms  and  conditions  will  be  set  forth  in  the  related  draft  Loan \nAgreements.  The  Government  will  finance  the  remainder  of  the \ntotal Project cost in an amount of $40 million equivalent, including \nlocal taxes and duties.  \n \nThe utilization period will be for 10 years from 2009 to 2018 with \nthe last periodic financing request to be submitted by 2014. Each \nspecific  loan  will  have  its  own  closing  date  to  match  its \nimplementation period.  \n \n31 December 2018  \n\nfor  road  maintenance.  This  will \n\n \nDepartment of Works (DOW) \n \nThe  DOW  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Investment \nProgram. The DOW will also be the Implementing Agency for the \nroad  improvement  works.  The  NRA  will  be  the  Implementing \ninclude  all  road \nAgency \nmaintenance works contracted directly by the NRA or transferred \nfrom \nthe  DOW.  The  Highlands  Road  Management  Group \n(HRMG),  which  is  the  DOW  project  implementation  unit  for  the \nongoing  ADB  loans,  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  road \nimprovement  works.  A  project \nimplementation  unit  will  be \nestablished in the NRA. \n \nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  for  goods  and  services  will  be \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  International  competitive \nbidding procedures will be followed for all contracts over $3 million \nfor  civil  works  and  $0.5  million  for  goods.  National  competitive \nbidding  will  be  used  for  contracts  under  these  thresholds. \nShopping  can  be  used for  goods  with  contract values  lower  than \n$100,000,  as  appropriate.  Contracts  have  been  packaged  to \nattract  international  contractors  as  well  as  to  promote  national \ncontractors. \n \n\n\fConsulting Services \n\n \nInvestment Program \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nv \n\n \nConsulting  services  will  be  required  for  implementation  support \nand  capacity  development.  Key  tasks  include  (i)  design  of  road \nimprovement  works; \n(ii)  preparation  of  bid  documents, \nprocurement  support,  and  supervision  of  road  improvement  and \nlong-term  maintenance  contracts;  (iii)  performance  management; \n(iv) preparation of subsequent projects; (v) capacity development; \nand  (vi)  socioeconomic  monitoring.  The  capacity  development \nactivities will focus on, among others, strengthening of the DOW, \nNRA  and  National  Road  Safety  Council  (NRSC)  in  financial \nmanagement,  road  maintenance  contracting,  road  safety,  and \nrationalizing road user charges.  \n \nProject  1  will  require  a  total  of  1,266  person-months  (362 \ninternational  and  904  national)  of  services  from  consulting  firms. \nAdditional  consulting  services,  if  necessary,  will  be  procured \nunder  subsequent  projects.  The  consulting  services  will  be \nfinanced  from  the  ADB  loans.  The  DOW  will  select  and  engage \nthe  consultants  in  accordance  with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on  the  Use \nof  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  using  the \nquality- and cost-based selection method. \n \nWhile the entire 1.9 million population of the Highlands region will \nbenefit from the Investment Program, the immediate beneficiaries \nof  Project  1  will  be  the  400,000  people  living  near  the  roads \nincluded  in  Project  1.  Anticipated  economic  benefits  will  include: \n(i) increased diversity of cash crops, higher production, and more \ndirect  sales  as  a  result  of  better  access  to  regional  markets  and \ntowns;  (ii)  rehabilitation  of  abandoned  coffee  gardens  and/or  the \nestablishment  of  new  gardens;  (iii)  more  raising  of  livestock  for \nsale;  (iv)  more  sales  by  market  vendors  because  of  the increase \nin  customers;  (v)  better  businesses  for  trade  store  owners;  and \nfor  creation  and/or  expansion  of \n(vi)  more  opportunities \nmicroenterprises  and  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises \n(SMEs). The greater availability, frequency, and reliability and the \nlower  costs  of  transport  services  will  benefit  public  motor  vehicle \ndrivers  and  truckers  as  well  as  people  who  rely  on  them. \nAnticipated  social  benefits  will  include  (i)  greater  accessibility  to \nschools, leading to higher enrollments, fewer drop-outs and better \nacademic performance; (ii) better access to health care, leading to \nimproved  health  outcomes;  (iii)  more  access  to  government \nservices,  including  new  services  such  electricity;  (iv)  more \nopportunities  to  diversify  and  expand  agricultural  production, \nmarket  cash  crops,  livestock  and  other  products  and,  as  a \nconsequence,  higher  household  income;  (v)  a  reduction  in  dust \nand  better  health  and  living  conditions  in  roadside  villages; \nand (vi) greater opportunities to travel more easily and cheaply for \nhealth,  education,  social  and  family  reasons,  as  well  as  to  seek \nwork or conduct business. These benefits will reach people living \nin  upstream  areas  and  off-road  communities,  as  well  as  those \nimmediately adjacent to the rehabilitated roads. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nthe \n\n \nThe major risks include the following: \n \nNRA\u2019s  Effectiveness.  Although \nthe  NRA  board  started \nfunctioning in 2004, the NRA has remained inadequately staffed. \nA  chief  executive  officer  was  appointed  in  2007.  The  3-year \nduration  of  the  board  expired  in  2007  and  a  new  board  was \napproved on 14 May 2008. The NRA is now actively recruiting key \nstaff.  Initial  assistance  for  operational  and  financial  management \nsystem  will be  provided  through  ongoing  TA,  and  complemented \nby  extensive  capacity  development  under \nInvestment \nProgram.  Capacity  development  of  the  NRA  and  improving  its \neffectiveness is critical to the success of the Investment Program.  \n \nRoad  Maintenance  Funding.  The  NRA  manages  a  road  fund \nfinanced through a fuel levy based on very low rates. The NRA is \nalso  authorized  and  plans  to  collect  road  damage  charges  on \nheavy  vehicles.  Supplemented  by  Government  financing,  these \nresources  are  barely  adequate  to  maintain  the  HCRN.  Additional \nresources  are  needed \nto  expand  NRA\u2019s  maintenance \nresponsibility  to  maintain  the  entire  national  road  network.  The \nInvestment  Program  includes  assistance  to  the  NRA  to  prepare \nfresh proposals for the Government to increase road maintenance \nfunding. Political support for such proposals will be crucial.   \n \nShortage of Civil Work Contractors. Implementation of ongoing \nroad-related  works  has  been  adversely  affected  by  a  lack  of \ncapable  international  and  national  contractors.  The  problem  is \ncompounded  in  the  Highlands  region  by  security  conditions.  The \nGovernment  is  aware  of  the  issues  and  is  taking  measures  to \n(i)  provide  safety \nthe \nprovincial  governments,  and \nlicensing  and \nclassification of national contractors, and provide opportunities to \nSME  construction  industry.  It  is  expected  that  the  long-term \nmaintenance  contracts  will  attract  international  contractors  and \nfacilitate joint ventures with national firms.  \n \nLand Acquisition and Resettlement. Because of the prevalence \nof customary landholding in PNG, land acquisition is intricate and \nthe  process  is  long.  The  DOW  normally  seeks  approval  of \ncommunities  to  carry  out  improvement  work  on  roads  through  a \nmemorandum  of  agreement,  without  formal  acquisition.  This  has \nled to regular interruptions of work on the ongoing road projects in \nthe  Highlands  region.  However,  the  DOW  has  now  started  to \nacquire rights of way for major roads in the Highlands region. The \nInvestment  Program  will  help  the  DOW  to  carry  out  field surveys \nand  prepare  land  acquisition  documents  for  all  Investment \nProgram roads to enable it to make payments and acquire rights \nof way.  \n \nSecurity. Security in the Highlands region remains an issue with \n\ninternational  contractors \n\nimprove \n\nthrough \n\n(ii) \n\nto \n\n\f \nTechnical  Assistance  for \nPreparation  of  National \nTransport  Development \nPlan (2011\u20132020) \n\nvii \n\nreadied \n\nthe  contractors  working  on  ongoing  road  projects.  It  is  important \nthat  the  DOW,  with  the  support  of  the  provincial  governments, \naddresses this issue.  \n \nA  TA  grant  of  $700,000  equivalent  will  be  provided  to  assist  the \nDOT to prepare a successor document to the NTDP, 2006\u20132010. \nThe  target  is  for  the  new  NTDP,  covering  2011\u20132020,  to  be \nendorsed as Government policy by the National Executive Council \nfor  publication  by  December  2010,  with \nand \nimplementation  to  begin  on  1  January  2011.  Preparation  of  the \nnew NTDP will be based on benchmarking of the performance of \nthe current NTDP, consultations with national, provincial, and local \nagencies, links with the Government\u2019s development strategies and \nbudget  and  planning  processes,  and  consultations  with \nstakeholders  and  the  private  sector  on  transport  infrastructure \nneeds.  In  performing  these  services,  the  consultant  will  work \nclosely with development partners such as Australian Agency for \nInternational  Development,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency and the World Bank. In particular, the consultant will work \nclosely  with  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development\u2019s \nongoing  Transport  Sector  Support  Program  team  members.  It  is \nenvisaged \nthe  existing  Transport  Sector  Coordination, \nMonitoring and Implementation Committee will provide a forum to \nfacilitate harmonization of the approach and inputs to the NTDP. \n \n\nthat \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\fPAPUA NEW GUINEA\nHIGHLANDS REGION ROAD IMPROVEMENT INVESTMENT PROGRAM\n\no\n144  00'E\n\nEAST   SEPIK\n\nSANDAUN\n\no\n\n6  00'S\n\nWESTERN\n\nPorgera\n\nMulitaka\n\nLondol\n\nAnditale\n\nKompiam\n\nLaiagam\n\nLakopenda\n\nWabag\nENGA\n\nMeriamanda\n\nYampu\n\nYaibos\n\nLumusa\n\nYalis\n\nBaiyer\n\nWapenamanda\n\nMogoro Fugwa\n\nKoroba\n\nHiwinda Jcn\n\nTari\n\nAmbua \n\nAmbra\n\nKondipina\n\nBanz\n\nOgelbeng\n\nKandep\n\nTambul\n\nTogoba\n\nKindeng\nMount Hagen\n\nKudjip\n\nMADANG\n\nWESTERN\nHIGHLANDS\n\nPabarabuk\n\nKaupena\n\nKerowagi\n\nKorinige\n\nDona\n\nKup\n\nWandi\n\nGewa\nKundiawa\n\nMargarima\n\nPeane\n\nMunihu\n\nNipa\n\nMendi\n\nBui Yebi\n\nDet\n\nMuli\n\nKagua\n\nKisenapoi\n\nIalibu\n\nPangia\n\nPimaga\n\nYomasi\n\nSumbura\n\nErave\n\nSOUTHERN  HIGHLANDS\n\nGULF\n\n144  00'Eo\n\nLorengau\n\n152  00'Eo\n\nKavieng\n\nVanimo\n\nAitape\n\n4  00'So\n\nWewak\n\nB i s m a r c k     S e a\n\nPROJECT  AREA\n\nKolopo\n\nWabag\nMt.

The report also describes technical assistance (TA) for \npreparing  the  10-year  national  transport  development  plan,  2011\u20132020,  and,  if  the  Board \napproves  the  proposed  MFF,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will \napprove  the  TA.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  for  the  Investment  Program  is  in \nAppendix 1.   \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES  \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nPNG sits between Asia and the Pacific. It comprises the eastern half of the island of New \nGuinea,  together  with  the  island  provinces  of  East  and  West  New  Britain,  New  Ireland,  North \nSolomons (Bougainville) and Manus, and some 600 associated islands. The total land area is \nabout  460,000  square  kilometers  (km2)  of  which  only  some  7,300  km2  is  inhibited  by  a \npopulation of over 6 million. Roads provide the main means of access for most of the mainland \npopulation  and  road  transport  is  by  far  the  dominant  mode  of  travel.  For  the  island  provinces \nand  some  of  the  mainland  provinces  without  land  connections,  domestic  aviation  and  coastal \nshipping play important roles.  \n \n3. \nEconomic  growth  in  PNG  is  surging  as  high  oil  and  mineral  prices  boost  Government \nrevenues.  Gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  reached  6.2%  in  2007,  about  double  the \naverage rate of recent years, and is projected to rise to 6.6% in 2008, before easing to 4.6% in \n2009.  Business  confidence  has  generally  improved,  assisted  by  some  structural  reform  and  a \nrelatively stable political environment. Revenue windfalls from the oil and minerals boom have \ngreatly  improved  the  overall  fiscal  and  debt  position.  Mining  and  petroleum  revenue  grew  by \n59% in real terms in 2005, by 72% in 2006, and by 15% in 2007. The Government\u2019s total debt \n(domestic and external) has more than halved since 2002 and reached 35% of GDP by the end \nof 2007. It is projected to decline to about 27% of GDP by 2010. The ratio of external debt to \nGDP  of  18%  in  2007  is  well  below  the  30%  maximum  threshold  set  by  the  International \nMonetary  Fund.  By  the  end  of  2007,  savings  from  windfall  revenue  in  trust  accounts  had \naccumulated  to  K2.3  billion  (about  12%  of  GDP  or  $800  million),  providing  an  opportunity  to \nfund maintenance and investment of infrastructure, among other public services.  \n \n4. \nThe Highlands region comprises five provinces (Chimbu, Enga, Southern, Eastern, and \nWestern  Highlands)  and  is  the  country\u2019s  primary  source  of  national  income  and  export \nearnings.1 The  major  gold  reserves  are  in  Enga  and  almost  all  oil  and  gas  production  is  in \nSouthern Highlands. The region is also known for its agricultural exports, including coffee, tea, \nand vegetables. About 40% of the PNG population lives in the Highlands region. The terrain is \nrugged,  with  high  mountain  ranges,  steep  valleys  and  fast-flowing  rivers.  The  road  network \nprovides a lifeline for exports as well as for supplies to the resource enclaves and the general \npopulation.  The  Highlands  Highway  and  roads  leading  from  it  form  the  largest  contiguous \nnetwork,  linking  the  Highlands  provinces  with  the  main  port  at  Lae.  However,  high  rainfall, \nseismic activities, fragile geological conditions and a highly dispersed population make the road \nnetwork difficult to develop and sustain.   \n \n                                                 \n1  Minerals and petroleum alone accounts for nearly 80% of exports (World Bank. 2002. Country Assistance Strategy \n\nfor Papua New Guinea for FY2008\u2013FY2011. Sydney. [November]). \n\n\f2 \n\nThe road network is classified into national, provincial, and district roads. National roads \n5. \nlink  provincial  capitals  and  the  main  population  centers.  The  national  road  network  is  7,600 \nkilometers  (km),  of  which  2,600  km  are  sealed  and  the  rest  are  gravel  roads.  Provincial  and \ndistrict  roads  provide  the  secondary  and  tertiary  links  to  the  national  road  network.  Their  total \nlength  is  about  10,000  km,  of  which  only  about  1,000  km  are  sealed  and  the  remainder  are \ngravel or unpaved. The traffic volumes on the national highway network are low, except for the \nurban  centers  of  Port  Moresby  and  Lae.  Traffic  on  74%  of  the  national  road  network  is  fewer \nthan 500 vehicles per day. Only about 40% of the national road network is considered to be in a \nmaintainable condition and the remainder requires some significant rehabilitation, restoration, or \nreconstruction to make the roads usable. Based on the Department of Works (DOW) road asset \nmanagement system (RAMS), the condition of national roads in the Highlands region is poorer \nthan the overall national road network. The annual investment in the road sector has averaged \nK500 million over the last 3 years, with a very small proportion spent on maintenance.2   \n \n6. \nThe  Department  of  Transport  (DOT)  is  responsible  for  national  transport  policy \nformulation, planning, safety, and regulation. The DOW is responsible for carrying out works on \nthe  national  road  network.  The  provincial  and  local  governments  are  responsible  for  the \nmaintenance  and  development  of  all  provincial and  district roads.  The  provincial  offices  of  the \nDOW  provide  technical  advice  and  support  to  the  provincial  governments.  As  part  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  efforts  to  create  autonomous  organizations  to  manage  transport,  the  National \nRoads Authority (NRA) was established in 2003 to take over the responsibility of maintaining the \nnational road network, starting with the roads in the Highlands region. In addition, a road fund \nfinanced from road user charges was created to provide a sustainable source of finance for road \nmaintenance. An independent board oversees the functions of the NRA and the use of the road \nfund.  The  11-member  board  comprises  representative  of  the  private  sector  (chamber  of \ncommerce), road users (commercial transporters), institutions (engineering and accounting) and \nthe  Government  (departments  of  transport,  works,  planning  and  treasury).  To  promote  road \nsafety, in 1997 the Government established a National Road Safety Council (NRSC) to advise \nthe  Government  on  road  safety  matters,  recommend  road  safety  actions  to  the  appropriate \nauthorities,  conduct  educational  campaigns,  and  promote  road  safety  research.  The  14 \nmembers  of  NRSC  include  the  representatives  of  the  departments  of  transport  and  works, \nfinance  and  planning,  health,  education,  provincial  and  local  government,  lands  and  physical \nplanning,  national  capital  district  commission,  motor  vehicles  insurance  trust,  chamber  of \ncommerce, and universities. It is funded from a 5% levy on motor vehicle insurance premiums. \nAn analysis of the road sector is in Appendix 2. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nChallenges \n\n \nRoad Maintenance. About 70% of the road network in the Highlands region is in a poor \n7. \ncondition.  Although  some  road  improvement  projects  financed  by  the  Government,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB),3 and the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) \nare  being  implemented,  roads  quickly  fall  back  into  disrepair  because  of  the  lack  of  regular \nmaintenance.  The  poor  condition  of  the  network  has  resulted  in  longer  journey  times,  higher \n\n                                                 \n2  Recent expenditure on maintenance is less than 5% and most of it is used for emergency works.  \n3  ADB. 1999.

Consequently, significant income \nfrom  agricultural  and  other  exports  is  lost  and  social  conditions  worsen,  exacerbating  social \nunrest and lack of security. The reasons for the failure to maintain roads are both financial and \ninstitutional.  At  the  national  level,  the  DOW  relies  on  its  annual  budget  submission  and \nallocation to fund routine and periodic road maintenance. In practice, the DOW\u2019s budget request \nis  cut  back  and  even  the  agreed  amount  is  only  partly  received.  As  a  result,  the  network \ndeteriorates  and  emergency  repairs  take  up  an  increasingly  large  proportion  of  the  available \nfunds,  undermining  the  DOW\u2019s  ability  to  institute  a  planned  maintenance  program  based  on \nRAMS. Road improvements have relied increasingly on major rehabilitation and reconstruction \nprojects funded by the international development partners.4 The maintenance of provincial and \nlower  level  roads  is  in  an  equally  distressed  state,  with  low  budgets  leading  to  a  reactive \napproach to repairs to keep routes open to traffic.   \n \nPNG\u2019s  development  partners  have  given  considerable  support  to  road  maintenance.5 \n8. \nThe  Government  has  reflected  the  need  for  sustainable  road  maintenance  in  the  National \nTransport  Development  Plan  (NTDP),  2006\u20132010.6 This  pursues  four  strategies:  (i)  assigning \nresponsibility  for  maintenance  of  national  roads  to  the  NRA,  starting  with  the  roads  in  the \nHighlands  region,  (ii)  using  RAMS  to  analyze  maintenance  needs  for  individual  road  sections \nand  to  prioritize  maintenance  works,  (iii)  raising  funds  directly  from  road  users  through  cost \nrecovery,  and  (iv)  preventing  undue  damage  to  road  assets  by  overloading.  The  NTDP \nproposes to collect revenues from road users through a special levy on fuel and special vehicle \nregistration and license fees. The resulting revenues are to be deposited into a road fund to be \nmanaged  by \nthe  NRA  and  used  exclusively  on  road  maintenance.  The  successful \nimplementation of the NTDP will enable the large routine and periodic maintenance program to \nbe  implemented.  The  initial  focus  will  be  on  maintaining  national  roads,  followed  by  provincial \nand district roads.  \n \n9. \nCapacity.  The  weak  capacity  of  the  Government  and  the  private  sector  is  a  feature  of \nmost  Pacific  countries. While  institutional  reforms  have  been  undertaken  in  PNG,  policies  and \nstrategies  outlined,  and  development  plans  prepared,  implementation  has  often  suffered \nbecause  of  weak  capacity.  There  is  a  need  to  identify  capacity  development  needs  in  close \nconsultation  with  the  Government  and  private  sector  counterparts  and  to  undertake  capacity \ndevelopment  through  lending  and  nonlending  products.  AusAID  began  a  major  long-term \ninitiative7   in    2007    to    improve    capacity,    service    delivery,    and    governance    of    transport \ninfrastructure agencies, including the DOW.  \n \nNetwork  Approach.  The  NTDP  road  investment  plan  identifies  16  priority  sections  of \n10. \nnational highways for rehabilitation. The intention is that once all the key national road corridors \nhave  been  improved  to  acceptable  levels,  work  on  other  national  and  provincial  roads  will  be \nundertaken.  This  approach  overlooks  the  importance  of  the  secondary  and  tertiary  road \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB, AusAID, World Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), European Union (EU). \n5  ADB. 1999.

Canberra;  and \nWorld Bank. 2004. Transport Sector Review Note. Sydney.  \n\n6  NTDP  was  initially  prepared  for  2001\u20132010.  Though  major  institutional  reforms  were  achieved  with  the \nestablishment of (i) civil aviation authority in January 2001, (ii) national maritime safety authority in February 2004, \nand (iii) national roads authority in March 2003, not much progress  was made in implementation of infrastructure \ninvestments.  The  original  plan  was  extensively  reviewed  and  revised  in  2005  in  the  form  of  the  current  NTDP \n(2006\u20132010).      \n\n7   Phase  1  of  the  AusAID\u2019s  Transport  Sector  Support  Program  covering  2007\u20132012  has  a  budget  of  up  to  A$50 \n\n \n\nmillion a year. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nnetworks that feeds into the national road system. Selected provincial and district roads linking \nto  rural  areas  in  the  Highlands  region  also  need  to  be  improved  to  open  access  to  livelihood \nopportunities,    markets,    health,    and    educational  services.    A    World    Bank    study8   has \ndemonstrated  clear  links  between  better  roads  and  improvements  in  the  human  development \nindex, in particular through increased participation in education and use of health facilities.  \n \n11. \nVehicle Overloading. Vehicle overloading is one of the factors responsible for the rapid \ndeterioration  of  the  road  network,  particularly  in  the  Highlands  region,  because  of  heavily- \nloaded  vehicles  from  the  extractive  industry.  Half  of  the  damage  to  roads  is  attributed  to \noverloaded  vehicles.  Bailey  bridges9 in  the  Highlands  region  are  mostly  in  good  condition,  but \nsome  on  the  provincial  network  have  collapsed  because  of  overloading.  Although  the  DOT  is \nresponsible for performing axle load tests and levying fines on defaulters, it has not taken any \naction  to  control  overloading.  The  NRA  is  in  the  process  of  installing  weighbridges  and  is \nseeking  a  delegation  of  power  from  the  DOT  to  initiate  axle  load  controls,  starting  with  the \nHighlands highway. \n \nRoad Safety. The road accident and injury rates for PNG are estimated to be among the \n12. \nhighest  in  the  Pacific  region.  Although  recent  data  are  lacking,10 the  road  fatality  rate  in  2002 \nwas  40  per  10,000  registered  vehicles,  four  times  higher  than  in  the  Fiji  Islands  and  40  times \nhigher  than  in  the  best  performing  countries.  The  economic  cost  of  road  accidents  was \nestimated  to  be  over  K200  million  per  year  in  2002.  The  main  causes  of  traffic  accidents  are \ndrunk  driving,  inadequate  road  safety  awareness  by  drivers  and  pedestrians,  lack  of  safety \nconsiderations  in  road  design,  hazardous  roads,  and  inadequate  enforcement  of  traffic  rules. \nADB  technical  assistance 11  from  1984  to  1996  was  instrumental  in  (i)  establishing  a  road \naccident reporting and analysis system within the DOT\u2019s Land Transport Department, (ii) setting \nup  the  NRSC,  and  (iii)  undertaking  accident  black  spot  and  remedial  treatment  analysis  and \nstaff  training.  Since  its  establishment  in  1997,  NRSC  has  taken  the  lead  in  road  safety.  With \nlimited  resources,  it  is  funding  small  projects  to  educate  the  community  in  road  safety,  raise \nstandards  of  traffic  enforcement,  and  bring  stakeholders  together  to  tackle  the  problems.  The \nNRSC  is  seeking  to  expand  into  vehicle  safety  enforcement  and  is  in  the  process  of  re-\nestablishing a basic traffic accident database from several years of accumulated police accident \nrecords. Road safety needs to be institutionalized in national and provincial road agencies, and \nsafety  audit  functions  need  to  be  incorporated  into  design,  hazard  identification,  and  safety \nmanagement across the road network. \n \n13. \nRight-of-Way. About 97% of the land in PNG is held in customary ownership by kinship \ngroups.  Land  is  a  fundamental  part  of  people\u2019s  cultural  identity  and  is  not  normally  sold  or \nalienated.  This  is  particularly  the  case  in  the  Highlands  region.  Although  the  existing  road \nnetwork is recognized by surrounding communities, improvement works provide an opportunity \nfor  demands  for  compensation,  work  interruptions,  and  violence.  This  lack  of  security  has \naffected  road  contracts  in  the  Highlands  region,  resulting  in  limited  numbers  of  bidders  and \nuncompetitive  bids  for  road  improvement  works.  The  DOW  has  recently  initiated  legal \n                                                 \n8   World Bank socioeconomic impacts study under Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project, March 2007.  \n9   Removable steel bridges that are generally used for temporary access until a permanent structure is constructed.   \n10  The data were destroyed in a fire at the DOT\u2019s headquarters. \n11 ADB. 1984.

Although  the  acquisition  of  land  for  roads  is  a  difficult  and  protracted \nprocess, it is the first step toward a sustainable road network. \n \nGovernance.  Governance  has  been  a  focus  of  the  Government\u2019s  reform  efforts  since \n14. \n2000,  but  the  task  is  not  easy.  The  PNG\u2019s  policy  and  legislative  frameworks  are  generally \nadequate, but the Government continues to struggle with compliance and implementation. A key \nfactor  is  weak  capacity  at  all  levels (institutional,  organizational,  and  individual).  ADB\u2019s  project \nprocurement-related audit of the ongoing road project (footnote 3) in 2005 and 2006 found no \nclear  indications  of  fraud  or  corruption,  but  it  did  identify  control  weaknesses  and  project \nimplementation concerns, including (i) deficiencies in internal project management, (ii) lapses in \nthe  supervision  consultant\u2019s  financial  management,  (iii)  inadequate  due  diligence  in  assessing \nthe  experience  and  capacity  of  potential  contractors,  (iv)  delays  in  administering  and \nconstructing subprojects because of administrative requirements and law and order concerns on \nwork sites; and (v) poor subproject designs and difficult contract implementation.    \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment\u2019s Strategy and Ongoing Efforts \n\n \n15. \nThe  NTDP  provides  a  policy  framework  and  investment  plan  for  road  sector \ndevelopment  to  achieve  the  objectives  of  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development \nStrategy (MTDS), 2005\u20132010. It prioritizes maintenance and improvement of the existing road \ninfrastructure.  The  investment  priorities  in  the  road  sector  are  assigned  to  16  national  road \ncorridors,  several  of  which  are  in  the  Highlands  region.  The  NTDP  stresses  the importance  of \ninstitutional reforms, including enabling the NRA to undertake road maintenance and the NRSC \nto promote road safety.  \n \n16. \nThe  NTDP\u2019s  overall  aim  is  to  provide  safe  and  dependable  transport  services  to  all \nsections of the community in a cost-efficient and effective manner. Specifically, NTDP plans to \noffer  (i)  better  transport  access  to  education,  health,  and  other  social  services,  especially  for \nrural  communities;  (ii)  more  access  to  production  sites  and  markets  at  lower  transport  costs;  \n(iii) better opportunities for raising incomes in remote and impoverished coastal rural areas; and \n(iv) lower transport costs and safer movement of passengers and goods. This will be achieved \nby  (i)  maintaining  and  improving  the  existing  infrastructure  and  services;  (ii)  upgrading, \nrehabilitating  and  improving  infrastructure  that  is  economically  feasible;  and  (iii)  giving  high \npriority to safety and security. Other policy initiatives include (i) new approaches to funding and \nfinance,  in  particular  the  introduction  of  road  user  cost  recovery  to  generate  the  required \nrevenue for maintenance activities; (ii) promoting stronger partnerships with the private sector; \n(iii)  seeking  a  closer  working  relationship  between  national  and  provincial  governments;  and  \n(iv) adopting more integrated and strategic approaches to transport planning, policy formulation \nand decision making. However, implementation of the NTDP has been slow. \n \n17. \nThe  NRA  was  established  in  2003  and  a  governing  board  was  appointed  in  2004. \nHowever,  its  executive  was  not  permanently  staffed  until  the  appointment  of  a  chief  executive \nofficer in 2007. The 3-year duration of the board expired in 2007 and a new board was approved \non  14  May  2008.  The  NRA  is  now  recruiting  key  staff  so  that  it  can  begin  road  maintenance \noperations. Development of the NRA\u2019s financial management systems will be supported by ADB \nTA  (footnote  5).  The  road  fund,  financed  by  road  user  charges,  has  been  operational  since \n2006. Efforts are underway to expand other sources of finance for maintenance since, although \nthe NRSC has major plans to expand its operations, it faces a shortage of resources.      \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n3. \n\nADB\u2019s Strategy  \n\n \nADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP), 2006\u2013201012 has supported implementation \n18. \nof the MTDS by tightening the focus of ADB\u2019s program to maximize its impact in priority areas. \nThe CSP builds on ADB\u2019s comparative advantage and its long-standing relationships with other \ndevelopment  partners.  The  strategic  areas  of  ADB\u2019s  engagement  are  public  financial \nmanagement, private sector development, the transport sector, and health and HIV prevention. \nThe  CSP  and  the  country  operations  business  plan  aim  to  continue  road  rehabilitation  and \nmaintenance in the Highlands region and other least developed areas of PNG. This will make a \nsignificant contribution to robust and broad-based economic growth, which is central to MTDS. \n \n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\nfor  15 \n\ntechnical  assistance  projects \n\n \n19. \nADB  has  funded  six  road  projects  in  PNG  since  1972  through  eight  loans  for  a  total \namount  of  $256  million.  The  projects  covered  10  provinces  including  the  five  provinces  in  the \nHighlands  region.  The  ongoing  Road  Maintenance  and  Upgrading  Project 13  was  originally \nfinanced through a loan of $63 million in 1999, extended through a supplementary loan of $53 \nmillion in 2006. The project covers road improvements in the Highlands region. In addition, grant \nfinancing  has  been  provided \ntotaling  over  \n$6  million  for  project  preparation,  sector  reforms,  and  capacity  development.  ADB  has  also \nprovided support to harmonize the efforts of the development partners in the transport sector in \nline with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and to support the Government\u2019s declared \npolicy direction through MTDS and NTDP. \n \nAusAID has financed six initiatives in the road sector since 1995, totaling A$421 million. \n20. \nThe  projects  covered  maintenance  of  sealed  or  gravel  roads  and  bridges,  and  sealing  or \nresealing works on the national roads in 12 provinces. Since 2007, AusAID has been working to \nimprove transport outcomes through the Transport Sector Support Program (footnote 7), which \nfocuses  on  improving  governance  and  strengthening  capacity  to  improve  service  delivery. \nInitially,  the  TSSP  will  provide  technical  assistance  to  transport  agencies  under  the  central \ngovernment,  to  be  extended  later  to  the  provincial  governments.  Under  the  TSSP,  contracts \nhave been awarded to rehabilitate and maintain 530 km of roads in nine provinces. \n \n21. \nThe  World  Bank  is  funding  road  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  in  eight  provinces \nthrough  a  loan  of  $40  million  in  2002  and  a  supplementary  loan  of  $37  million  in  2007.  The \nJapan \n(JICA)  has  provided  grant  assistance  of  \n$23 million for the construction and upgrading of bridges in several provinces. The Japan Bank \nfor International Cooperation has provided $126 million in loans for a trans-island highway and \nnational road improvement projects. The details of external assistance are given in Appendix 3.  \n \nThrough  an  ADB-financed  initiative  in  2007,  the  activities  of  the  development  partners \n22. \nhave been harmonized and a framework prepared, supported by AusAID, JICA and the World \nBank.  A  Transport  Sector  Coordination,  Monitoring  and  Implementation  Committee  (TSCMIC) \nwas  subsequently  established  by  the  Government  to  coordinate  all  transport  agencies  and \nconsult with development partners on aid effectiveness.    \n \n \n\nInternational  Cooperation  Agency \n\n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2006.

Manila.  \n\n\f7 \n\n5. \n\nLessons  \n\n \n23. \nOne  of  the  key  lessons  from  past  initiatives  in  the  road  sector  is  the  need  to  ensure \nsustainable  maintenance  before  undertaking  road  development  and  improvement  projects. \nExamples  of  roads  showing  signs  of  deterioration  within  2  years  of  construction  because  of  a \nlack  of  routine  maintenance  are  quite  common  in  the  Highlands  region.  Sustainable \nmaintenance  includes  not  only  institutional  arrangements  but,  more  importantly,  a  regular \nsource  of  financing  and  delivery  mechanisms.  AusAID\u2019s  Key  Roads  for  Growth  Project 14 \ndemonstrated the benefits of long-term maintenance contracts that not only ensured good road \nconditions but also provided livelihood opportunities to the roadside communities.   \n \n24. \nA  major  barrier  to  development  in  the  Pacific  is  the  lack  of  capacity  in  the  agencies \nresponsible for service delivery. PNG is no exception. Road agencies such as the DOW, NRA, \nand the NRSC need to be strengthened and this should complement the ongoing initiatives by \nother development partners, particularly AusAID\u2019s TSSP (para. 20). \n \nSeveral lessons can be learned from the ongoing ADB projects in the Highlands region:  \n25. \n(i)  project  consultants  should  have  direct  responsibility  for  design  and  supervision  rather  than \nplaying  an  advisory  role,  (ii)  contract  packages  need  to  be  designed  so  as  to  attract  good \ncontractors,15 and (iii) the DOW initiative to acquire rights of way of the national roads should be \nsupported. Governance-related lessons are in para. 60. \n \n\n6. \n\nRationale for ADB Support \n\n \nThe NTDP provides a framework of policies and strategies to achieve a sustainable road \n26. \nsystem  in  PNG.  It  led  to  the  establishment  of  the  NRA  with  responsibility  for  maintaining  the \nroad  network  and  to  a  road  fund  financed  through  road  user  charges  to  finance  road \nmaintenance.  The  NRA  and  road  fund  are  managed  by  an  independent  board  with \nrepresentatives  from  road  users,  the  private  sector,  and  the  Government.  There  is  a  need  to \ntranslate these initiatives into a workable system by (i) strengthening the NRA\u2019s capacity to plan \nand  manage  road  maintenance  works,  (ii)  seeking  increased  financing  for  the  road  fund  by \nrationalizing  road  user  charges,  and  (iii)  awarding  long-term  performance-based  road \nmaintenance contracts.  \n \n27. \nThe  Highlands  region  is  a  major  contributor  to  PNG\u2019s  economy  through  its  agricultural \nand  mineral  exports.  It  is  also  home  to  40%  of  the  country\u2019s  population,  who  rely  almost \nexclusively  on  the  road  network  for  movement  of  people  and  goods.  The  road  network  is \nvulnerable  because  of  the  mountainous  terrain,  the  fragile  geological  conditions,  and  the \nclimate. The Government and its development partners have invested significantly in improving \nthe road network, but a lack of regular maintenance has left it in a poor condition. Past capacity \ndevelopment  initiatives,  such  as  RAMS,  have  been  useful  in  prioritizing  maintenance \ninvestments,  but  its  use  has  been  limited.  There  is  a  need  to  (i)  initiate  a  program  of  regular \nmaintenance on all HCRN roads that are in good condition, and (ii) improve those HCRN roads \nthat are in a poor condition and ensure that routine maintenance begins on these roads as soon \nas the improvement works are done. \n      \n                                                 \n14 The 3-year maintenance contracts on 356 km section of the Highlands Highway (in Morobe and Eastern Highlands \nprovinces)  have  resulted  in  a  20%  savings  in  travel  time,  an  18%  reduction  in  annual  maintenance  costs,  and  a \nsignificant improvement in the capacity of national contractors.   \n\n15 The  DOW  and  NRA,  in  coordination  with  the  Central  Supply  and  Tenders  Board,  are  planning  road  shows  in \n\nregional countries to attract international contractors and respond to their concerns.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n28.  With a functioning board and NRA staffing underway, the Government is keen to support \nthis initiative, which could serve as model for other regions of PNG.   \n \n29. \nThe  multitranche  financing  facility  is  the  most  suitable  modality  for  financing  the \nInvestment  Program  because  (i)  it  supports  the  Government\u2019s  long-term  vision  for  developing \nthe sector as outlined in the NTDP, (ii) it enables ADB to sustain the long-term partnership that \nis needed to institutionalize road maintenance, (iii) it allows ADB to strengthen and improve the \nNTDP  and  actively  to  pursue  policy  dialogue  throughout  the  life  of  the  Investment  Program,  \n(iv)  it  responds  to  the  long-term  capacity  development  needs  of  the  road  agencies,  (v)  it \nprovides flexibility to the Government in terms of the timing and size of the investments for each \ntranche,  (vi)  it  provides  an  opportunity  to  apply  lessons  from  early  tranches  to  guide  the \nsubsequent  tranches  and  to  include  incentives  for  reforms  and  implementation  efficiency,  and \n(vii)  it  provides  comfort  to  private  companies  interested  in  pursuing  long-term  opportunities  in \nthe road sector.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n30. \nThe  proposed  Investment  Program  will  establish  a  sustainable  road  system  in  the \nHighlands region that will enable maximum use of its natural, mineral, and human resources. It \nwill contribute to the Government\u2019s MTDS, 2005\u20132010 objectives of (i) export-driven economic \ngrowth; (ii) rural development, and poverty reduction; (iii) good governance; and (iv) promotion \nof sustainable agriculture, forestry, fisheries and tourism.  \n \n31. \nopportunities, and reduce travel time and transport costs in the Highlands region. \n \nB. \n\nThe  Investment  Program  will  improve  access  to  ports,  markets,  and  livelihood \n\nOutputs \n\n32. \n Multitranche  Financing  Facility.  The  Investment  Program  focuses  on  the  Highlands \ncore  road  network  (HCRN)16 of  2,500  km  of  major  national  and  some  provincial  roads.  The \nHCRN  carries  the  bulk  of  the  traffic  in  the  region.  The  Investment  Program  will  include  \n(i) investment projects covering improvements to about 1,400 km of HCRN (Appendix 4) to be \nfunded through four or more tranches; (ii) consulting services for (a) preparation of investment \nprojects  for  ADB  approval  and  design  and  supervision  of  civil  works,  and  (b)  preparation  and \nadministration  of  long-term  road  maintenance  contracts  for  the  entire  2,500  km  of  HCRN;  \n(iii)  support  for  capacity  development,  resource  mobilization  for  maintenance  funds,  and \nimproving road transport services; and (iv) monitoring the socioeconomic benefits of improved \nand  maintained  roads  in  the  Highlands  region.  In  addition,  technical  assistance  is  provided  to \nsupport  the  DOT  to  prepare  a  new  National  Transport  Development  Plan  (NTDP)  for  2011\u2013\n2020. \n \n33. \nProject  1.  The  first  tranche  will  finance  Project  1,  which  includes  (i)  improvements  to  \n211  km  of  national  roads17 that  are  part  of  the  priority  corridors  identified  in  the  NTDP,  2006\u2013\n2010; (ii) support to the DOW for (a) the design, preparation of bid documents, and procurement \nfor  211  km  of  roads,  (b)  preparation  of  investment  proposals  for  subsequent  projects  and \n                                                 \n16 HCRN represents 65% of the total road network in the Highlands region. \n17 Nipa\u2013Magarima (26 km), Magarima\u2013Ambua (41 km), Hiwinda Junction\u2013Koroba (29 km), Mendi\u2013Kandep (50 km), \nand Laiagam\u2013Porgera (65 km). Roads for subsequent projects will be selected from the list in Appendix 4 using the \nselection criteria included in the same appendix. \n\n\f9 \n\ntranches for ADB approval, and (c) the design, preparation of bid documents and procurement \nsupport for subsequent projects and tranches; (iii) support to the NRA for (a) preparation of bid \ndocuments  and  procurement  support  for  the  maintenance  of  2,500  km  of  the  HRCN,  and  \n(b)  implementation  of  policies  to  improve  road  maintenance  financing  through  road  user \ncharges, road damage charges, a tax credit scheme, and other means; (iv) consulting services \nto the DOW and the NRA for the supervision of (a) road improvement contracts for 211 km of \nroads,  and  (b)  long-term  maintenance  contracts  for  these  211  km  of  roads  and  an  additional  \n360 km of roads that are already in a maintainable condition; (v) consulting services for capacity \ndevelopment and improving road transport services; and (vi) a socioeconomic monitoring study.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nOperationalization of the NRA \n\n \n \n34. \nInadequate  funding  of  routine  maintenance  is  a  major  cause  of  unsustainable  road \nnetworks. Failure to perform regular routine maintenance results in a rapid deterioration of roads \nto  the  extent  that  major  rehabilitation  or  reconstruction  is  required.  This  cycle  of  inadequate \nmaintenance leading to accelerated deterioration and rehabilitation is self-perpetuating because \nthe urgency of repairs to roads that are failing draws funds away from the routine maintenance \nthat could have prevented the problem. \n \n35. \nThe design of the Investment Program is therefore predicated on providing sustainable \nroutine maintenance so that the investment in rehabilitation and upgrading of the project roads \nis not dissipated through neglect. The roads will be managed by an organization whose primary \nfocus is road maintenance. Establishment of the NRA is a key institutional policy set out in the \nNDTP.  Details  of  the  NRA  can  be  found  in  Appendix  5.  The  Investment  Program  will  include \nassistance to the newly formed NRA to (i) enable it to take responsibility for managing HCRN, \nand  (ii)  seek  policy  reforms  to  generate  adequate  resources  for  the  road  fund  to  finance \nmaintenance. \n  \n\n2. \n\nLong-Term Maintenance Contracts \n\n \nLong-term  maintenance  contracts  will  be  an  integral  component  of  the  Investment \n36. \nProgram.  For  the  1,400  km  of  the  HCRN  to  be  improved,  the  civil  work  contractors  will  be \nresponsible for improving the road and maintaining it to a specified standard for the remainder \nof  a  10-year  contract  period.  The  DOW  will  transfer  responsibility  for  these  roads  to  the  NRA \nonce  improvement  works  are  completed.  The  maintenance  contracts  will  be  \u201cperformance-\nbased\u201d  with  fixed  monthly  payments  that  will  be  subject  to  performance  standards  being  met, \nand will include penalties for underperformance. The roadside communities will benefit from the \nlivelihood  opportunities  offered  under  these  contracts,  particularly  in  carrying  out  routine \nmaintenance tasks such as vegetation control and culvert cleaning (para. 23).   \n \n37. \nAbout  1,100  km  of  other  major  roads  in  the  HCRN  (Appendix  6)  that  are  currently \nmaintainable  will  also  be  included  in  the  Investment  Program,  to  ensure  that  it  does  not \nconcentrate only on rehabilitated roads. These roads will be transferred to the NRA and placed \nunder  10-year  maintenance  contracts  that  may  initially  be  \u201coutput-based\u201d  contracts,  with \nprovision to convert them to \u201cperformance-based\u201d contracts after 2 years. A proposed work plan \nfor  maintenance  of  roads  by  the  NRA  is  in  Appendix  6.  These  contracts  may  also  include  a \nprovision to check overloaded vehicles.  \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n3. \n\nRoad User Charges \n\n4. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\n \n38. \nIf  the  HCRN  is  to  be  sustainable,  adequate  resources  will  be  needed  to  fund  road \nmaintenance. Road user charges are proposed in the NTDP and are provided for in the National \nRoads  Authority  Act,  which  was  developed  through  ADB-financed  TA.18 The  National  Roads \nAuthority Act allows road maintenance funds to be generated through a fuel levy on the sale of \ndiesel19 and  road  damage  charges  on  heavy  vehicles.  About  K16  million  a  year  has  collected \nthrough  the  fuel  levy  since  2005.  This  amount  is  deposited  in  the  road  fund,  which  has  now \nreached  about  K49  million.  The  NRA  is  currently  making  arrangements  for  road  damage \ncharges  to  be  collected  from  heavily-loaded  vehicles,  which  is  expected  to  yield  another  \nK10  million  a  year.  The  Government  supplements  NRA  resources  by  K20  million  a  year \n(Appendix 5). Consultants will help the NRA to rationalize and manage road user charges and \nto raise awareness of the need for adequate maintenance funding.20 \n \n \n \nThe road network in the Highlands region is heavily used by companies involved in gold, \n39. \noil and gas and other mineral extraction and production, and in coffee growing and processing. \nBetter  roads  and  lower  transport  costs  will  benefit  them  greatly.  With  a  predominantly  private \nsector  board,  the  NRA  is  being  encouraged  to  operate  on  a  commercial  basis,  charging  its \nusers and maintaining the network on their behalf. Initial discussions about the possibility of a \npartnership  between  the  NRA  and  the  private  sector  in  the  Highlands  region  to  fund  road \nmaintenance  have  been  encouraging.  The  consultants  will  help  the  NRA  to  explore  this \nopportunity  further  and  to  make  proposals  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  existing  tax  credit \nscheme.21  \n \n \n \nThe  current  NTDP,  2001\u20132010  provides  the  overall  policy  and  strategic  framework  for \n40. \nroads  and  road  transport.  It  has  been  supported  by  several  initiatives  undertaken  by  the \nGovernment.  Appendix  7  describes  the  implementation  of  road-related  policies  and  how  the \nInvestment Program will support them. The financing framework agreement (FFA) between the \nPNG and ADB will set out the policy framework for the proposed projects under the Investment \nProgram, which will be guided by the current NTDP (valid until 2010). The Investment Program \nwill include grant-financed technical assistance to help the Government prepare the next NTDP \nfor 2011\u20132020 (paras. 66\u201368).  \n \n \n \n41. \nRoad  safety  is  a  major  issue  in  PNG,  causing  significant  loss  of  life,  injuries,  and \neconomic  losses.  Improving  roads  in  the  Highlands  region  will  allow  higher  traffic  speeds  but \nmay also cause an increase in traffic accidents. Road safety audit surveys and the removal of \nblack spots will be part of the engineering design, but road safety awareness needs to be raised \namong road users and roadside communities. Traffic laws need to be enforced. The NRSC is \n\nPolicy Framework \n\nRoad Safety \n\n6. \n\n5. \n\n                                                 \n18 ADB.  2001.

Under  the  Investment  Program,  the  NRSC  will  \n(i)  participate  as  a  member  of  the  Investment  Program  Steering  Committee  that  will  oversee \nimplementation; (ii) prepare and implement programs to improve road safety awareness in the \nHighlands  region;  and  (iii)  carry  out  road  safety  investigations,  safety  management  systems, \ntraffic  safety  design  and  auditing,  accident  date  reporting  and  traffic  law  enforcement.  The \nInvestment Program will also support the NRSC initiative to establish accident-reporting facilities \nin the Highlands region.  \n \n \n \n42. \nVehicle  ownership  in  the  Highlands  region  is  very  low.  Travel  is  almost  entirely  by \ncommercial  passenger  and  goods  transport  services.  These  services  are  regulated  and  fares \nare  set  by  the  Independent  Consumer  and  Competition  Commission.  Services  are  almost \nentirely  \u201con  demand\u201d  with  no  formal  timetables.  This  is  ideal  for  heavily  used  routes,  but  can \nlead  to  chronic  underprovision  on  low-density  routes.  The  Investment  Program  will  include  a \nreview of the adequacy of existing passenger and freight services in the region and will make \nrecommendations for administrative or regulatory reforms as needed. \n \n \n \nCapacity  development  of  the  NRA,  the  DOW,  and  the  NRSC  is  essential  for  these \n43. \nagencies to play their roles efficiently and effectively (see also Appendix 8). The NRA needs to \nestablish  capacity  to  implement  financial  management  and  information  systems,  assess  road \nmaintenance  needs,  prepare  contract  packages,  administer  contracts,  address  social  and \nenvironmental issues, develop and implement road user charges, and carry out promotion and \npublic  awareness.  The  DOW  needs  to  strengthen  its  planning,  design,  and  road  development \nand  improvement  works.  The  NRSC  needs  to  strengthen  its  capacity  to  carry  out  its  key \nresponsibilities under the National Road Safety Council Act, 1997. The Investment Program will \nsupport consultants who will work closely with these agencies to guide and support them. For \nthe  DOW,  these  consultants  will  be  supplemented  by  AusAID\u2019s  Transport  Sector  Support \nProgram.  For  the  NRA  and  the  NRSC,  the  consultants  will  support  capacity  development  in \nspecific areas. In addition, assistance will also be provided to the DOW and the Department of \nLand  and  Physical  Planning  (DLPP)  in  carrying  out  field  surveys  and  preparation  of  land \nacquisition documentation for the HCRN to enable the DOW to acquire rights of way.  \n \n \n \n44. \nThe  Project  will  include  a  benefit-tracking  study  to  monitor  the  social  and  economic \nbenefits  of  improving  and  maintaining  the  roads.  This  will  involve  benchmarking  and  follow-up \nstudies  both  of  villages  influenced  by  the  roads  and  of  control  villages  unaffected  by  the \ndevelopment.  The  methodology  will  closely  follow  studies  undertaken  by  the  DOW  and  World \nBank since 2004 and recently undertaken by AusAID. The results of these studies show clear \nmeasurable benefits from investments in road improvement and maintenance. The scope of the \nstudy will include roads that are being upgraded and maintained under the Investment Program, \nas  well  as  roads  that  have  been  or  are  being  improved  under  other  ADB-financed  projects \n(footnote 3).

Financing will \nbe provided in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy,22\n primarily from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, \ni.e.,  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF),  supplemented  by  its  ordinary  capital  resources \n(OCR).  The  MFF  will  comprise  several  loans,  subject  to  the  submission  of  related  periodic \nfinancing requests (PFR) by the Government, the execution of loan agreements, and fulfillment \nof  terms  and  conditions  and  understandings  set  forth  in  the  financing  framework  agreement \n(FFA). The OCR financing will follow the provisions of the ordinary operations loan regulations \napplicable to London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based loans, subject to modifications that \nmay  be  included  under  individual  loan  agreements.  The  financing  from  the  Special  Funds \nresources  will  follow  the  provisions  of  the  special  operations  loan  regulations,  subject  to \nmodifications that may be included under individual loan agreements. Cofinancing of about $80 \nmillion equivalent is expected from the Japan International Cooperation Agency on concessional \nterms  from  tranche  2  onwards.  Other  development  partners  have  expressed  good  deal  of \ninterest  in  cofinancing  the  remaining  $70  million.  The  Government  will  provide  counterpart \nfinancing of $200 million equivalent.   \n \n48. \nThe Government has submitted the first PFR for tranche 1, requesting two loans totaling \n$100.0 million equivalent from Special Funds resources (a \u201chard-term\u201d ADF loan of $28.8 million \nequivalent and a \u201csoft-term\u201d ADF loan of $71.2 million equivalent), to help finance Project 1. The \nADB loans will finance 71% of the total cost of Project 1. The ADF concessionary loans will both \nhave a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; interest under the hard-term loan \nwill be at 3.15% per annum for the life of the loan while interest under the soft-term loan will be \nat  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  Other  terms  and \nconditions will be set forth in the related draft loan agreements. The Government will finance the \nremainder of the total Project cost in an amount of $40 million equivalent, including local taxes \nand  duties.  The  proposed  financing  plans  for  the  Investment  Program  and  Project  1  are \nsummarized in Table 2, and details of Project 1 are in Appendix 9.  \n\n \nTable 2: Financing Plans \n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n% \n\nTotal \n\nTotal ($ million) \n\nSource \nInvestment Program \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment   \nOther External Financiersa \n \nProject 1 \nAsian Development Bank (Special Funds Resources) \nGovernmentb \n \n \na    Expected to include the Japan Bank for International Cooperation and other cofinanciers. \nb \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n49. \nFor  the  second  and  subsequent  tranches,  the  Government  has  requested  ADB  to \nconsider  providing  a  total  of  $300  million  equivalent  from  its  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF) \n\n     53 \n     27 \n     20 \n   100 \n \n     71 \n     29 \n   100 \n\n400.0 \n200.0 \n150.0 \n750.0 \n  \n100.0 \n40.0 \n140.0 \n\nIncludes taxes and duties. \n\nTotal \n\n                                                 \n22  ADB. 2008.

ADB  has  informed  the  Government  that  ADF  allocations  will  be  subject  to  (i)  the \ngeneral  availability  of  ADF  resources,  (ii)  Papua  New  Guinea\u2019s  access  to  such  resources \npursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Graduation  Policy  and  the  requirements  of  the  ADF  donors,  and  (iii)  the \navailability of such resources to Papua New Guinea pursuant to ADB\u2019s Policy on Performance-\nBased  Allocation  for  Asian  Development  Fund  Resources.  ADB  has  also  informed  the \nGovernment that, based on ADF availability for the Investment Program, OCR financing will be \ndetermined,  so  that  the  total  available  amount  under  the  MFF  will  not  exceed  $400  million \nequivalent. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nInvestment Program and Project Management \n\n50. \nThe  DOW  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Investment  Program  and  the \nImplementing  Agency  for  the  road  improvement  works.  The  NRA  will  be  the  IA  for  road \nmaintenance,  including  all  road  maintenance  works  contracted  directly  by  the  NRA  or \ntransferred from the DOW. The Highlands Road Management Group (HRMG), the DOW project \nimplementation unit for the ongoing ADB loans (footnote 3), will be responsible for implementing \nroad  improvement  works  and  will  be  strengthened  with  additional  staff.    The  existing  project \ndirector  for  ADB  loans  will  also  be  responsible  for  the  Investment  Program.  HRMG  will  be \nresponsible  for  engaging  all  consulting  services  and  road  improvement  contracts  under  the \nInvestment  Program.  The  NRA  will  establish  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  consisting  of \nkey  NRA  staff  and  supported  by  Investment  Program  consultants.  A  program  steering \ncommittee  (PSC)  will  oversee  the  Investment  Program  implementation,  monitor  progress, \napprove  roads  for  subsequent  projects,  and  provide  guidance  to  the  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies.  The  PSC  will  meet  at  least  quarterly  and  will  be  chaired  by  the \nsecretary of the DOW or his designee. Other members of the PSC will include the secretary of \nthe  DOT  or  his  designee;  the  chief  executive  officer  of  the  NRA;  the  executive  director  of  the \nNRSC;  senior  officials  of  the  departments  of  national  planning  and  monitoring,  treasury,  and \nfinance; the valuer general of DLPP; a representative of DEC; provincial administrators from the \nfive Highlands provinces; and representatives of the Highlands police force and the chamber of \ncommerce.  \n \n51. \nADB  will  finance  staff,  equipment,  and  operating  expenses  in  the  HRMG  in  the  DOW \nand the PIU in the NRA to implement the Investment Program. ADB will finance the cost of the \nHRMG  and  PIU  staff,  as  well  as  related  office  equipment  and  supplies.  ADB  financing  for \nHRMG and PIU costs is justifiable because of (i) the limited capacity of the DOW and the NRA \nneeds  to  be  complemented,  and  (ii)  this  is  an  integral  part  of  ADB\u2019s  support  for  capacity \ndevelopment.  The  Government  has  given  assurance  that,  upon  completion  of  the  Investment \nProgram, HRMG and PIU staff will be integrated into the DOW and the NRA for future projects. \n \n\n2. \n\nPreparation for Project 1 and Subsequent Projects \n\n \n52. \nThe Investment Program will follow MFF implementation procedures. For Project 1, the \nsupport  consultants  will  assist  the  DOW  in  detailed  engineering,  bid  documents,  environment \nand  resettlement  plans,  tendering,  and  contract  awards.  All  resettlement  activities  will  be \ncompleted before civil works begin. For subsequent projects, the DOW, with the assistance of \nthe consultants, will (i) select roads based on the selection criteria (Appendix 4); (ii) prepare the \nproject  report,  including  technical,  economic,  environmental,  and  social  assessments;  and  \n(iii) prepare a PFR for each project. The project report will be prepared in accordance with the \ncriteria  and  procedures  stated  in  the  FFA,  and  other  related  requirements  of  the  Government \n\n\f15 \n\nand  ADB.  After  appraising  each  project  for  technical  and  economic  feasibility  and  compliance \nwith safeguard requirements, the DOW will submit to ADB, through the Department of National \nPlanning and Monitoring, a summary appraisal report in the format specified in the Investment \nProgram  administration  memorandum,  and  the  draft  PFR.  ADB  will  then  undertake  due \ndiligence  in  accordance  with  its  relevant  policies  and  procedures,  and  approve  the  DOW\u2019s \nappraisal, subject to any amendments. If required by ADB, the DOW will amend the PFR and \nsubmit it to ADB for approval on or before the due date of the PFR.  \n \nFor ADB to make available financing tranches under the FFA, in the reasonable opinion \n53. \nof ADB, PNG will be required to have achieved, or made sufficient progress on the performance \nmilestones provided below:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nbefore approval of the first tranche,23 (a) staffed the NRA with a sufficient number \nand appropriate expertise, (b) provided maintenance revenues through road user \ncharges to meet maintenance needs, (c) initiated gradual transfer of maintainable \nroads  from  DOW  to  NRA,  and  (d)  continued  to  provide  Government  budgetary \nresources to NRA to meet a shortfall in maintenance revenues;  \n\nbefore approval of the second tranche, (a) completed NRA staffing to a sufficient \nnumber  and  expertise;  (b)  continued  to  increase  road  maintenance  revenues \nthrough road user charges, road damage charges, a tax credit scheme, and any \nother  means;  (c)  continued  to  transfer  additional  maintainable  roads  from  DOW \nto NRA; (d)  awarded long-term maintenance contracts; (e) continued to provide \nGovernment  budgetary  resources  to  NRA  to  meet  any  shortfall  in  maintenance \nrevenues; and (f) NRA to have submitted quarterly progress reports; and  \n\nbefore  approval  of  the  third  and  any  subsequent  tranche:  (a)  continued  to \nincrease  road  maintenance  revenues  through  road  user  charges,  road  damage \ncharges,  a  tax  credit  scheme,  and  any  other  means;  (b)  continued  to  transfer \nadditional  maintainable  roads  from  DOW  to  NRA;  (c)  awarded  additional  long-\nterm  maintenance  contracts;  (d)  continued  to  provide  Government  budgetary \nresources  to  NRA  to  meet  any  shortfall  in  maintenance  revenues;  and  (e) \nsubmitted quarterly progress reports from NRA.  \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n54. \nThe Investment Program will be implemented over a period of 10 years, with completion \nby December 2018. It is estimated that Project 1 will be completed by 2012. DOW will prepare \ndetailed  implementation  schedules  for  the  subsequent  projects.  An  indicative  implementation \nschedule for the Investment Program and a detailed implementation schedule for Project 1 are \nin Appendix 10. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n55. \nAll ADB-financed procurement for goods and services will be carried out in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  International \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  will  be  followed  for  all  contracts  over  $3  million  equivalent  for \ncivil works and $0.5 million equivalent for goods. National competitive  bidding  will be  used  for \ncontracts  under  these  thresholds.  Shopping  can  be  used  for  goods  with  contract  values  lower \nthan $100,000 equivalent, as appropriate. A procurement plan for the Investment Program is in \n\n                                                 \n23 The Appraisal Mission confirmed that the performance milestones for the first tranche have been satisfied. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nAppendix  11.  Contracts  have  been  packaged  to  attract  international  contractors  as  well  as \npromote national contractors.      \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nfor \n\ntechnical, \n\nConsulting  services  will  be  required \n\n56. \nimplementation  support  and  capacity \ndevelopment,  and  for  socioeconomic  monitoring.  Key  tasks  include  (i)  design  of  road \nimprovement works; (ii) preparation of bid documents, procurement support, and supervision of \nroad  improvement  works  and  long-term  maintenance  contracts;  (iii)  performance  monitoring;  \n(iv)  preparation  of  subsequent  projects;  (v)  capacity  development;  and  (vi)  socioeconomic \nmonitoring.  The  capacity  development  activities  will  focus  on,  among  others,  strengthening  of \nthe DOW, NRA and NRSC in financial management, road maintenance contracting, road safety, \nand  rationalizing  road  user  charges.  The  consultant  team  will  define  a  detailed  work  plan; \nestablish  a  modern  and  efficient  management  information  system;  and  cater  for  planning, \nreforms, \nfiduciary  oversight,  safeguards,  and  other  matters  connected  with \nimplementation\u2014including reporting, monitoring, and evaluation. \n \n57. \nProject 1 will require a total of 1,266 person-months (362 international and 904 national) \nof  services  from  consulting  firms.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consulting  services  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix C. Additional consulting services, if necessary, will be procured under \nsubsequent  projects.  The  consulting  services  will  be  financed  from  the  ADB  loans.  The  DOW \nwill  select  and  engage  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time) using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod. \n \n58. \nThe  DOW  has  asked  for  advance  contracting  for  consulting  services,  which  has  been \napproved. The Fact-finding Mission advised the DOW that ADB approval of advance contracting \ndoes not commit ADB to finance the Investment Program.   \n \n\n6. \n\nInvestment Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\n59. \nTargets  and  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  Investment  Program  performance \nwere discussed with the Government and the key targets and indicators are in the design and \nmonitoring  framework  (Appendix  1).  The  consultants  for  Investment  Program  implementation \nsupport will work with the DOW to collect data from relevant agencies, including provincial and \ndistrict  governments,  to  measure  the  performance  indicators  at  inception,  3  years  after \ncompletion of each project, and at the completion of the Investment Program. They will report \nkey  findings  to  ADB  every  quarter.  The  DOW  and  the  NRA,  with  the  assistance  of  the \nsupervision  consultant,  will  monitor  and  evaluate  the  impacts  of  the  Investment  Program  to \nensure  that  the  completed  infrastructure  is  managed  effectively  and  benefits  are  maximized. \nADB Management will prepare periodic reports to inform the Board of overall progress. A Board \ninformation  report  will  be  submitted  annually,  and  progress  reports  will  be  submitted  to  inform \nthe Board of the approval of loans for subsequent projects. \n\n \n7.  \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption Measures \n\n \n60. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the projects under the Investment \nProgram.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are \n\n\f17 \n\nthese  were  discussed  with \n\nincluded  in  the  loan  agreements  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Investment  Program.  In \nparticular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Investment  Program  shall \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nthe  Executing  Agency  and  implementing  agencies,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the Investment Program. \n \n61. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  be  implemented  through  existing  institutions  and  using \ncountry  systems  as  much  as  possible.  In  accordance  with  ADB  requirements,24 a  governance \nassessment was conducted during preparation of the Investment Program. This identified risks \nand  associated  mitigating  actions  and \nthe  Government \n(Supplementary Appendix D). The assessment focused on three areas\u2014financial management, \nprocurement,  and  anticorruption\u2014and \nin  each.  Governance \nsafeguards  to  mitigate  the  risk  of  misuse  of  funds  and  to  improve  governance,  accountability, \nand transparency will include (i) a DOW website to provide and disclose updated and detailed \ninformation  on  project  implementation;  (ii)  timely  disclosure  of  information  on  selection  of \nconsultants and contractors through local newspapers and on the website; (iii) dissemination of \ninformation  to  the  public,  through,  for  example,  publicizing  expected  service  levels  from \nperformance-based  contracts;  (iv)  use  of  ADB  procurement  rules  and  extensive  use  of  prior \nreview; (v) independent verification of the quantity, quality and cost of works by the international \nsupervision  consultant;  (vi)  independent  accounting  support  to  build  capacity  and  to  ensure, \namong  other  things,  timely  and  rigorous  reconciliations,  orderly  record  keeping,  and  strict \nadherence  to  financial  management  policies  and  internal  controls;  (vii)  independent  external \nauditing  of contracts,  project  accounts,  and  financial  statements;  (viii)  intensive  supervision  by \nADB and other funding agencies; and (ix) forensic audits of any alleged corruption cases. \n \n\nidentified  significant  risks \n\n8.  \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n62. \nThe  Executing  Agency  and  Implementing  Agencies  have  agreed  to  adhere  to  sound \nfinancial  management  requirements  during  implementation  of  the  Investment  Program.  The \nDOW will maintain separate project records and accounts adequate to identify the (i) goods and \nservices  financed  from  loan  proceeds,  (ii)  financing  resources  received,  (iii)  expenditures \nincurred on the components of each project, and (iv) counterpart and cofinancier funds received \nand expended. The DOW will engage independent external auditors acceptable to ADB to audit \nthe consolidated project accounts annually, including of statement of expenditure transactions, \nand  counterpart  funds.  The  DOW  will  submit  to  ADB  certified  copies  of  audited  annual \nconsolidated project accounts as well as the auditor\u2019s report in English within 6 months of each \nfinancial  year-end  during  implementation.  The  DOW  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  requirement  for \ntimely  submission  of  audited  annual  project  accounts  and  financial  statements,  and  the \nsuspension of disbursements of ADB loans in case of noncompliance with the requirement. \n \nThe  DOW  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  for  individual \n63. \nprojects,  which  will  include  (i)  a  narrative  description  of  progress  made  during  the  reporting \nperiod,  (ii)  changes  in  the  implementation  schedule,  (iii)  problems  or  difficulties  encountered, \nand  (iv)  activities  to  be  undertaken  in  the  next  reporting  period.  The  DOW  will  prepare  and \nsubmit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  within  3  months  of  the  completion  of  each  project, \nand  an  investment  program  completion  report  after  completion  of  all  projects  under  the \nInvestment Program. \n\n                                                 \n24  Applicable  policies  and  guidelines  include:  ADB.  2006.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n9. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n64. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). The last disbursements under the MFF will be \nmade by 30 June 2018. Direct payment procedures will generally be used for road improvement \ncivil  works  contracts  and  for  consulting  services  contracts.  HRMG  will  maintain  separate  bank \naccounts  for  each  project.  The  Government  will  make  initial  payments  from  budget  resources \nand  the  reimbursement  procedure  for  eligible  expenditures  will  apply  with  full  supporting \ndocumentation.  \n \n\n10. \n\nReviews \n\n \nADB  will  field  inception  missions  within  3  months  of  approval  of  the  loan(s)  for  each \n65. \nproject, and at least two review missions a year. The Government and ADB will jointly undertake \na  midterm  review  of  Project  1  within  2  years  of  commencement  and  a  midterm  review  of  the \nInvestment  Program  by  2013.  The  timing  of  midterm  reviews  of  subsequent  projects  will  be \nagreed during appraisal of each project. The midterm reviews will focus on (i) program impacts, \n(ii) implementation progress, (iii) progress on policy framework, (iv) performance of consultants \nand  contractors,  (v)  status  of  compliance  with  undertakings  in  the  FFA  and  covenants  in  the \nindividual  loan  agreements,  and  (vi)  the  need  for  any  midcourse  changes  in  the  scope  or \nschedule of the Investment Program to ensure full achievement of the impacts.       \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nA technical assistance grant will be provided to assist the DOT to prepare a successor \n66. \ndocument to the existing NTDP, 2006\u20132010. The objective will be for the new NTDP, covering \n2011\u20132020,  to  be  endorsed  as  government  policy  by  the  National  Executive  Council  and \nreadied for publication by December 2010, to take effect from 1 January 2011. A consultant will \nbe  engaged  to  support  the  DOT  to  prepare  the  new  NTDP,  based  on  benchmarking  of  the \nperformance of the current NTDP, consulting with national, provincial and local agencies, linking \nwith  the  Government\u2019s  development  strategies  and  its  budget  and  planning  processes,  and \nconsulting  with  stakeholders  and  the  private  sector  on  the  need  for  transport  infrastructure \n(Supplementary  Appendix  E).  In  performing  these  services,  the  consultant  will  maintain  close \ncoordination  with  the  development  partners  such  as  AusAID,  World  Bank,  and  JICA.  In \nparticular, the consultant with work closely with AusAID\u2019s TSSP team members. It is envisaged \nthat  the  Transport  Sector  Coordination,  Monitoring  and  Implementation  Committee  (TSCMIC) \nwill provide a forum to harmonize the approach of and inputs to the NTDP. The Government has \nagreed that ADB will be represented on the TSCMIC.   \n \n67. \nCost  and  Financing. The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $875,000 equivalent. \nADB  has  been  asked  by  the  Government  to  provide  $700,000  equivalent.  The  TA  will  be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The  Government  will  provide \n$175,000 equivalent to finance counterpart staff, office facilities, and other expenditures. \n \nImplementation Arrangements. The DOT will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The \n68. \nsecretary of the DOT will provide guidance and support to the TA consultants. TSCMIC will be \nthe  steering  committee  and  will  oversee  the  conduct  of  the  TA,  receive  periodic  reports  and \nbriefings  from  the  consultants,  and  provide  guidance  on  the  Government\u2019s  policy  and \ninvestment  direction  for  inclusion  in  the  NTDP.  The  TA  will  include  the  services  of  a  team  of \ninternational  consultants  led  by  a  transport  planner  and/or  economist  and  supported  by  short-\n\n\f19 \n\nterm specialists to assist and advise the secretary of the DOT on preparation of a new NTDP. A \ntotal of 18 person-months of international consulting services will be required.   \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits  \n\nAlthough the entire 1.9 million population25 of the Highlands region will benefit from the \n69. \nInvestment Program, the immediate beneficiaries of Project 1 will be the 400,000 people living \nnear  the  roads  included  in  Project  1.  Anticipated  economic  benefits  as  a  result  of  road \nimprovement and maintenance include (i) increased diversity of cash crops, higher production, \nand  more  direct  sales  as  a  result  of  better  access  to  regional  markets  and  towns;  (ii) \nrehabilitation  of  abandoned  coffee  gardens  and/or  establishment  of  new  gardens;  (iii)  more \nraising  of  livestock  for  sale;  (iv)  more  sales  by    market  vendors  because  of  the  increase  in \ncustomers;  (v)  better  business  for  trade  store  owners;  and  (vi)  more  opportunities  for  the \ncreation  and/or  expansion  of  microenterprises  and  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises.  The \ngreater availability, frequency, and reliability and the lower costs of transport services will benefit \nthe  public  motor  vehicle  (PMV)  drivers  and  truckers  as  well  as  people  who  rely  on  them. \nAnticipated  social  benefits  include:  (i)  greater  accessibility  to  schools,  leading  to  higher \nenrollments,  fewer  drop-outs,  and  better  academic  performance;  (ii)  better  access  to  health \ncare, leading to improved health outcomes; (iii) better access to government services, including \nnew  services  such  as  electricity;  (iv)  more  opportunities  to  diversify  and  expand  agricultural \nproduction,  market  cash  crops,  livestock  and  other  products,  leading  to  higher  household \nincomes and more food security; (v) less dust and better health and living conditions in roadside \nvillages;  and  (vi)  more  opportunities  to  travel  easily  and  more  cheaply  for  health,  education, \nsocial  and  family  reasons  as  well  as  for  livelihood  opportunities.  These  benefits  will  reach \npeople living in off-road communities, as well as those immediately adjacent to the rehabilitated \nroads.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n70. \nAn economic analysis has been prepared for the 211 km roads under Project 1 that will \nbe improved under the direction of the DOW and then transferred to the NRA for maintenance. \nIn  addition,  370  km  of  roads  that  are  in  good  condition  will  be  maintained  by  the  NRA.  The \nanalysis follows the standard practice of comparing life-cycle road agency and user costs with \nand  without  the  project,  based  on  analysis  with  the  highway  development  and  management \nmodel  (HDM-4).  The  analysis  focuses  on  savings  in  transport  costs.  Value  added  from  better \ntransport  links  resulting  in  increased  opportunities  for  agriculture  and  employment  are  not \nquantified in this analysis but are captured through benefits to generated traffic.  \n \nTraffic volume on Project 1 roads exceeded 400 vehicles per day at the beginning of the \n71. \ndecade, but has fallen to as low as 160 vehicles in some sections as a result of the poor state of \nthe  road  network,  the  associated  suppression  of  economic  activity,  and  an  increase  in  tribal \ntensions.  Population  growth  and  the  improvement  in  economic  condition  of  the  Project  1  area \nsuggest  there  is  realistic  potential  for  a  return  to  previous  volumes.  The  economic  analysis \nassumes  the  road  improvements  will  trigger  a  one-off  increase  in  traffic  to  midway  between \ncurrent and historic volumes, followed by a 6% annual growth in traffic. The Project passes the \n12% threshold even without the increase in traffic. \n \n\n                                                 \n25  Based on the 2000 census. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nFinancial Management and Sustainability \n\nThe economic internal rate of return is estimated at 16.5% for improvement works and \n72. \n36.1%  for  maintenance  works.  The  finding  that  the  proposed  road  works  are  economically \njustifiable still holds even with a 20% increase in construction costs and 20% reduction in traffic \nlevels. A summary of the economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nC.  \n \n73. \nA financial management assessment was undertaken in June 2008, in accordance with \nADB    requirements.26   Among    other    things,    the    assessment    considered    the    financial \nmanagement arrangements for the Road Maintenance and Upgrading (Sector) Project (footnote \n3). The assessment rated the overall inherent risk as substantial and the overall control risk as \nhigh.27 Particular  weaknesses  concerned  record  keeping,  internal  controls,  project  accounting \nand  reporting,  and  understanding  of  and  adherence  to  financial  management  policies  and \nprocedures. In response, the financial management arrangements for the proposed Investment \nProgram  will  be  significantly  stronger  than  those  for  previous  projects.  Specific  measures  will \ninclude  capacity  building  support  and  the  provision  of  independent  accounting  support  to \nensure,  among  other  things,  timely  and  rigorous  reconciliations,  orderly  record  keeping,  and \nstrict  adherence  to  financial  management  policies  and  internal  controls.  Project  1  is  not  a \nrevenue-earning project and, as such, does not require financial analysis. \n \nAnalysis was undertaken to assess the Government\u2019s counterpart funding for Project 1 \n74. \nand  its  capacity  to  service  the  debt.  The  Government  is  committed  to  timely  provision  of  the \nrequired  counterpart  funding  during  implementation  of  Project  1  and  is  favorably  positioned  to \nservice the debt from the Project. The ratio of external debt to GDP of 18% in 2007 (expected to \nfall to 11.4% by 2010) is substantially below the 30% threshold maximum level of external debt \nset by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for low-income countries such as PNG. \nIn  September  2007,  Standard  &  Poor\u2019s  upgraded  the  foreign  currency  rating  of  the  debt \nsecurities  of  the  PNG  Government  to  \u2018B+\u2019  and  its  local  currency  rating  to  \u2018BB\u2013\u2019.  Although \nexternal debt is below threshold levels, PNG has been assessed by the International Monetary \nFund as at moderate risk of debt stress given its exposure to world oil and mineral prices and \nthe  ongoing  risk  of  overspending  by  the  public  sector.  The  MFF  is  expected  to  have  a \nmanageable impact on the country\u2019s debt situation. \n \nD. \n \n75. \nPoverty levels are increasing. Most people have land and are able to grow sufficient food \nto meet basic household consumption needs but there are wide discrepancies in the well-being \nof  different  segments  of  society,  particularly  as  livelihoods  are  increasingly  linked  to  the  cash \neconomy. According to the 1996 household survey, 37% of the population were living below a \npoverty line of $350 (K461) per year. Furthermore, 17% of the population was unable to meet \nthe  basic  food  requirement  of  2,200  calories  per  day  per  adult  equivalent.  Poor  economic \nperformance  and  rapid  population  growth  have  led  to  a  sharp  increase  in  the  incidence  of \npoverty  to  53.8%  in  2003.    In  the  same  period,  poverty  levels  elsewhere  in  the  Pacific  region \ndropped  from  15%  in  1996  to  10%  in  2003.  Poverty  in  PNG  is  concentrated  in  rural  areas, \nwhere  the  poverty  level  (41%)  is  significantly  higher  than  in  urban  areas  (16%).  A  poverty \nmapping  exercise  indicates  that  5  of  the  20  disadvantaged  districts  in  PNG  are  in  Southern \nHighlands and Enga provinces.  \n\nPoverty and Social Impacts \n\n                                                 \n26  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n27  These  ratings  are  consistent  with  similar  assessments  undertaken  by  development  partners  operating  in  the \n\ntransport sector. \n\n\f21 \n\nThe  Investment  Program  incorporates  several  strategies  to  facilitate  the  ability  of \n76. \ncommunities and households to realize benefits from road improvements and maintenance and, \nthereby,  reduce  poverty  in  the  Highlands  region.  The  design  includes  (i)  priorities  for \nemployment  of  local  men  and  women  in  road  rehabilitation  and  maintenance;  (ii)  civil  work \ncontracts  to  include  the  provision  of  HIV  awareness  and  prevention  programs  in  construction \ncamps  and  neighboring  communities;  and  (iii)  an  extensive  community  relations  and  a \nparticipation program linked to different aspects of subproject preparation and implementation. \n \nDuring Investment Program preparation, potential gender benefits and impacts on local \n77. \ncommunities  and  vulnerable  groups  were  analyzed  through  a  stakeholder  consultation \nworkshop,  key  informant  interviews,  focus  group  discussions,  and  small-sample  surveys.  The \nwomen who were consulted on the Project 1 roads strongly endorsed the road improvements. \nThey expected to be able to increase their agricultural production and to expand into new crops \nand  animal  rearing.  As  a  result,  they  anticipated  increasing  their  market  sales.  They  felt  that \nthey  would  have  faster  (and  perhaps  cheaper)  access  to  health  care  facilities.  Road \nimprovements will enable their children to go to schools and, in general, their communities will \nhave  better  access  to  government  services.  The  gender  division  of  labor  and  women\u2019s \ntraditional  exclusion  from  the  benefits  derived  from  road  rehabilitation and  maintenance  works \nwere  clearly  identified  during  focus  group  discussions  with  public  works  constructors.  The \nInvestment  Program  will  seek  to  give  women  more  access  to  jobs  provided  by  the  road \nimprovement  by  encouraging  civil  works  contractors  to  increase  the  percentage  of  women \nworkers  to  30%  of  the  labor  force,  and  to  carry  out  gender-sensitive  HIV  prevention  and  road \nsafety awareness in the project area. \n \nPapua  New  Guinea  is  characterized  by  a  generalized  HIV  epidemic,  with  prevalence \n78. \nrates of 1.65% among the 15\u201349 year age group in rural areas. This is projected to increase to \n5.5%  by  2011  if  no  major  initiatives  are  taken  to  control  spread  of  the  infection.  Key  at-risk \ngroups  include  truck  drivers,  including  those  that  work  on  the  Highlands  Highway;  female  sex \nworkers,  particularly  at  PMV  stops  along  the  Highway;  and  men  who  migrate  to  towns  and \ndevelopment enclaves for work. Wives and their new-born children are also at risk because the \nuse  of  condoms  is  not  widespread  and  there  is  a  high  degree  of  sexual  violence  within \nmarriages. The exposure of currently isolated communities to new levels of road traffic means \nthat special attention must be paid to the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In light of \nwomen\u2019s  greater  exposure  to  the  risks  and  impacts  of  HIV,  culturally  sensitive  and  gender-\nresponsive  awareness  and  behavior  change  initiatives  need  to  be  provided  in  campsites  and \ncorridors  of  influence  as  part  of  broader  health  education  programs.  The  Investment  Program \nwill  coordinate  with  existing  HIV  prevention  projects  financed  by  ADB  and  other  development \npartners  such  as  AusAID,  New  Zealand  Agency  for  International  Development,  UNAIDS\u2014the \njoint  United  Nations  Programme  on  HIV/AIDS\u2014and  World  Health  Organization.  A  summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n  \nE. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n79. \nProject  1  has  been  classified  as  environmental  category  B  according  to  the  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003),  and  it  is \nclassified  as  a  level  2  activity  under  PNG\u2019s  Environmental  Act,  2000  and  Environment \n(Prescribed  Activities)  Regulations,  2002.  Each  subsequent  project  will  be  categorized  in \naccordance with the ADB Environment Policy that is in place at the time a PFR is sent to ADB. \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  for  each  road  section  under  Project  1  has  been \nundertaken  to  assess  potential  environmental  impacts  and  recommend  mitigation  measures, \nmonitoring, and a reporting plan. An environment permit will be secured from the Department of \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nEnvironment and Conservation (DEC) for activities indicated in the regulation. An environmental \nassessment review framework (EARF) has been prepared that presents the general anticipated \nenvironmental  impacts  of  the  investment,  selection  criteria,  and  environmental  procedures  for \nsubsequent projects. It will guide the preparation and approval of environmental assessments of \nfuture projects likely to be financed under the Investment Program. The summary IEE, including \nan EARF, is in Appendix 13. Climate change may lead higher rainfall, so roadside drainage will \nneed to be carefully designed. Low traffic volumes mean that vehicle emissions will be minimal.   \n   \nAll five roads under Project 1 include improvements within the existing road corridor. No \n80. \nroad  sections  are  located  in  or  pass  through  any  protected  areas  or  ecologically  sensitive \nenvironment. The environmental impacts of roads during construction and operation have been \nassessed,  and  they  can  be  mitigated  to  acceptable  levels.  The  environmental  mitigation  and \nmonitoring  set  out  in  the  IEE  and  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  will  ensure  that \nenvironmental  impacts  arising  from  the  construction  and  operation  of  subsequent  projects  will \nbe kept to an acceptable level. The potential induced environmental impacts of roads have been \nassessed, particularly of those sections that connect to the sensitive environment of the forested \nKikori River Basin area in the Southern Highlands province. It was determined that the Hiwinda \nJunction\u2013Koroba road would not cause significant impacts to the Kikori River Basin.  \n \n81. \nThe EMP will be incorporated into the design and implementation of project roads. The \nEMP will guide the PMU, supervisory consultants, and contractors in managing, monitoring, and \nreporting  environmental  impact  mitigations  and  its  compliance.  Civil  works  bidding  documents \nmay only be released once the environmental assessment report of projects has been approved \nby  ADB  and  a  DEC  permit  has  been  received  for  activities  specified  by  the  Environment \n(Prescribed  Activities)  Regulations,  2002.  The  environmental  management  capacity  of  the \nHighlands  Road  Management  Group  (HRMG)  and  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be \nfurther strengthened to ensure compliance with Government and ADB requirements. \n \nF. \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\n1. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\n \n \nThe  Government  has  already  acquired  the  public  road  reserve  for  the  Highlands \n82. \nHighway from Lae to Mendi and plans to acquire land along all Project 1 roads. Existing roads in \nthe  Highlands  region  are  generally  on  customary  land,  the  use  of  which  has  been  agreed  in \nconsultation  with  the  clans  and  communities  that  jointly  own  the  land.  The  additional  land \nneeded for road improvement works for Project 1 is very minor; the amount will be determined \nby  the  detail  engineering  design  of  the  roads.  As  formal  land  acquisition  is  a  long  and  time-\nconsuming  process,  the  Government  will  negotiate  a  memorandum  of  agreement  (MOA)  with \nthe affected clans and communities to allow the use of land for road improvements. In parallel, \nthe Government will begin acquisition procedures for public road reserves along the Investment \nProgram  roads  through  a  process  of  State  alienation  of  customary  land  as  per  the  Land  Act, \n1996. Affected clans and communities will be compensated for land; individuals and households \nwith  assets  on  the  land  will  be  compensated  for  any  damage  to  or  loss  of  these  assets;  and, \nthrough agreements with clans and communities, they will continue to occupy and use land in \nthe road reserves outside that required to improve the roads. \n \n83. \nA resettlement framework (summarized in Appendix 14) has been reviewed by the PNG \nGovernment  to  establish  the  policies  and  procedures  for  payment  of  compensation  for  lost  or \ndamaged assets. The land acquisition impacts, where they occur, will be minor. There will be no \ndisplacement  of  housing  and  the  affected  people  will  experience  only  small  losses  of  crops, \n\n\f23 \n\n2. \n\nIndigenous People \n\ntrees,  fences  or  other  secondary  structures.  The  Project  is  categorized  as  B  with  respect  to \ninvoluntary resettlement. Short resettlement plans have been prepared for Project 1 roads and \nthese will be updated based on detailed engineering designs during loan implementation.  \n \n \n \n84. \nPapua  New  Guinea  has  over  800  different  language  groups.  In  the  Highlands  region, \npatriarchal  societies  are  organized  on  the  basis  of  clans  belonging  to  different  tribes;  in  Enga \nand the Southern Highlands provinces, the Huli, Enga, Ipili, and Angal are the principal linguistic \nand  tribal  groups  in  the  areas  of  Project  1.  Each  clan  has  a  specified  territory  that  is  owned \njointly by and supports the needs of its members; individuals and households are allocated land \nwithin the clan territory according to their needs to build a home and establish a food and cash \ncrop garden. All tribes rely on subsistence agriculture based on the cultivation of sweet potato; \ncash income is generated primarily through the sale of cash crops such as coffee, potato, and \npyrethrum.  In  general,  no  tribes  or  ethnic  groups  consider  themselves  to  be  minorities.  The \nresettlement framework and plans will address specific actions favorable to indigenous peoples, \nif necessary, in dealing with the customary land acquisition. The Project is classified as B with \nrespect to the ADB indigenous people\u2019s policy. \n \nG. \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nThe Investment Program includes the following assumptions and risks.  \n\n85. \n \n\n(i) \n\nNRA\u2019s  effectiveness. Although the NRA board started functioning in 2004, the \nNRA has remained inadequately staffed. A chief executive officer was appointed \nin 2007. The 3-year duration of the board expired in 2007 and a new board was \napproved  on  14  May  2008.  The  NRA  is  now  actively  recruiting  key  staff.  Initial \nassistance  for  operational  and  financial  management  system  will  be  provided \nthrough  ongoing  TA,  and  complemented  by  extensive  capacity  development \nunder the Investment Program. Capacity development of the NRA and improving \nits effectiveness is critical to the success of the Investment Program.  \n\nRoad maintenance funding. The NRA manages a road fund financed through a \nfuel  levy  based  on  very  low  rates.  The  NRA  is  also  authorized  and  plans  to \ncollect road damage charges on heavy vehicles. Supplemented by Government \nfinancing, these resources are barely adequate to maintain the HCRN. Additional \nresources  are  needed  to  expand  NRA\u2019s  maintenance  responsibility  to  maintain \nthe entire national road network. The Investment Program includes assistance to \nthe  NRA  to  prepare  fresh  proposals  for  the  Government  to  increase  road \nmaintenance funding. Political support for such proposals will be crucial.  \n\nShortage  of  civil  work  contractors.  Implementation  of  ongoing  road-related \nworks has been adversely affected by a lack of capable international and national \ncontractors.  The  problem  is  compounded  in  the  Highlands  region  by  security \nconditions.  The  Government  is  aware  of  the  issues  and  is  taking  measures  to  \n(i) provide safety to international contractors through the provincial governments, \nand  (ii)  improve  licensing  and  classification  of  national  contractors,  and  provide \nopportunities  to  SME  construction  industry.  It  is  expected  that  the  long-term \nmaintenance  contracts  will  attract  international  contractors  and  facilitate  joint \nventures with national firms.  \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n24 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLand acquisition and resettlement. Because of customary landholding in PNG, \nland  acquisition  is  intricate  and  the  process  is  long.  The  DOW  normally  seeks \napproval  of  communities  to  carry  out  improvement  work  on  roads  through  a \nmemorandum of agreement but without formal acquisition. This has led to regular \ninterruptions  of  work  on  the  ongoing  road  projects  in  the  Highlands  region. \nHowever,  the  DOW  has  now  started  to  acquire  rights  of  way  for  major  roads  in \nthe  Highlands  region.  The  Investment  Program  will  help  the  DOW  to  carry  out \nfield surveys and prepare land acquisition documents for all Investment Program \nroads to enable it to make payments and acquire rights of way.  \n\nSecurity. Security in the Highlands region remains an issue with the contractors \nworking on ongoing road projects. It is important that the DOW, with the support \nof the provincial governments, addresses this issue. \n\nVI. \n\nUNDERTAKINGS AND ASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Undertakings  \n\nA. \n  \n86.  \nthe FFA: \n \n\nThe Government has agreed to the following undertakings, which have been included in \n\nto implement, monitor, and evaluate the facility in the context of the design and \nmonitoring framework for the facility;  \n\nto provide its share of funding for the Investment Program in accordance with the \nfinancing plan and the implementation schedule, as well as provide for any cost \nover-runs  in  excess  of  the  contingencies  of  this  Investment  Program  and  the \nprojects; \n\nto  ensure  DOW  and  NRA  engage  independent  accounting  support  to  build \ncapacity and to ensure, among other things, timely and rigorous reconciliations, \norderly  record  keeping,  and  strict  adherence  to  financial  management  policies \nand internal controls; and ensure an orderly and timely year-end process for the \npreparation and audit of annual project accounts; \n\nfor  every  subproject,  to  fully  implement,  as  required,  the  environmental \nassessment and review framework and the resettlement framework;   \n\nto  ensure  that  DOW  (a)  undertakes  annual  road  safety  audits  of  all  Investment \nProgram  roads;  (b)  installs  appropriate  road  safety  facilities  during  project \nimplementation, including pavement markings, traffic signs and signals, warning \nsigns, and hazard barriers; and (c) works with the NRSC to improve road safety \nawareness in roadside communities; \n\nto  ensure  that  the  necessary  and  qualified  staff  are  engaged  throughout  the \nInvestment  Program  period,  and  that  NRA  establishes  and  implements  on  a \ntimely basis the operational and financial management system, and awards and \nmanages  the  long-term  maintenance  contracts,  all  with  assistance  under  the \nInvestment Program;   \n\n(vii) \n\nto  ensure  that  DOW  transfers  maintenance  responsibility  for  the  2,500  km  of \nHCRN  roads  to  NRA  during  the  Investment  Program  period,  and  that  NRA \n\n\f25 \n\nawards and manages the long-term maintenance contracts for such 2,500 km of \nroads;  \n\n(viii) \n\ntaking into account assistance provided under the Investment Program, to ensure \nthat  it  and  NRA  take  the  necessary  actions  to  increase  maintenance  resources \nfor the road fund through road user charges, road damage charges, the tax credit \nscheme, and other measures;  \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\nnotwithstanding  item  (viii)  above,  in  the  event  of  any  shortfall  in  maintenance \nfunds, to meet such shortfall from its own budgetary resources;  \n\nwith  the  support  of  the  Investment  Program  support  consultants  and  resources \nfrom  other  development  partners\u2019  programs  (e.g.,  the  AusAID  Transport  Sector \nSupport  Program),  to  undertake  capacity  development  for  DOW,  NRA  and \nNRSC;  \n\nto ensure that a project performance monitoring system for the Facility and each \ntranche is developed with reports prepared for each tranche; and   \n\nto  ensure  that  (a)  the  Investment  Program  is  carried  out  in  compliance  with  all \napplicable  Papua  New  Guinea  anticorruption \nregulations,  and  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy;  (b)  all  DOW  and  NRA  staff  are  trained  in  Papua  New \nGuinea\u2019s  anticorruption  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy;  and  (c)  a \nDOW website is developed and maintained to disclose the audited annual project \naccounts, project progress, and procurement activities. \n\n \nSpecific Assurances  \nB. \n \n \n87. \nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government, DOW and NRA have agreed to \ngive the following assurances with respect to Project 1, and such assurances will be included in \nthe legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nNational transport development plan. For preparation of the national transport \ndevelopment  plan  (2011\u20132020),  the  Government  will  ensure  that  the  transport \nsector  coordination,  monitoring,  and \nfacilitates \nharmonization of the approach and inputs to such plan, and that the committee \nincludes a representative from ADB. \n\nimplementation  committee \n\nNRA  staffing.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  NRA  is  staffed  to  a  sufficient \nnumber and with the necessary expertise to carry out its responsibilities.  \n\nEnvironment.  DOW  and  NRA  will  ensure  that  (a)  Project  1  is  carried  out  in \naccordance with the project design, and construction and operations will comply \nwith  all  applicable  Government  environmental  laws  and  ADB's  Environment \nPolicy (2002) and guidelines; (b) the EARF is applied to ensure compliance with \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy; (c) the EMPs in the IEEs are updated and made site-\nspecific,  as  required,  during  final  design;  (d)  the  environmental  mitigation \nmeasures specified in the EMPs are incorporated in the bidding documents to be \nreleased  only  after  relevant  environmental  assessment  reports  have  been \ninclude \napproved  by  ADB,  and  civil  works  contractor\u2019s  specifications \nrequirements to comply with the environmental mitigation measures in the EMPs; \n(e)  civil  works  contractors  are  closely  supervised  to  ensure  compliance;  (f)  the \nInvestment Program consultants undertake environmental monitoring, and reflect \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n \n \n\nthe  results  in  the  project  progress  reports  and  project  completion  report;  \n(g)  adequate  support  is  provided  to  the  environmental  staff  in  HRMG  and  their \ncapacity  is  increased  to  enable  appropriate  implementation  of  the  EARF  and \nenvironmental  supervision  and  monitoring  during  construction  and  operations;  \n(h)  training  is  provided  to  the  HRMG  environment  staff  to  ensure  that  they  can \nundertake  the  tasks;  and  (i)  when  necessary,  additional  environmental  staff  are \nrecruited to supplement the capacity of HRMG.  \n\nLand  acquisition.  The  Government  and  DOW  will  ensure  that,  to  the  extent \npossible,  road  improvement  works  are  undertaken  within  the  existing  right-of-\nway.  In  the  event  of  any  requirement  for  additional  land,  the  Government  will \ninform  ADB  and  prepare  and  implement  a  resettlement  plan;  the  resettlement \nplan  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  framework,  which \ncomplies  with  relevant  PNG  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). The Government will allocate adequate resources to \nprepare  and  implement  the  RP  and  supervise  and  monitor  its  implementation. \nThe Government, through DOW, will ensure that (a) national or provincial funds \nas  appropriate  are  allocated  and  disbursed  to  pay  compensation  for  affected \nassets, (b) land acquisition will not commence before the RP has been reviewed \nand approved by ADB, and (c) civil works will not start before the RP has been \napproved by ADB.  \n\nLabor  laws. The DOW and NRA will ensure that civil works contractors comply \nwith all applicable labor laws and related international treaty obligations, and do \nnot employ child labor for any rehabilitation or maintenance activities. The DOW \nwill  ensure  that  specific  provisions  to  this  effect  are  included  in  the  bidding \ndocuments and civil works contracts, and will strictly monitor compliance. \n\nGender  and  development.  The  DOW  and  NRA  will  (a)  encourage  local \ncontractors  to  employ  30%  of  women  in  road  improvement  and  maintenance \nworks,  (b)  provide  equal  pay  to  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  type  in \naccordance with national laws and international treaty obligations, and (c) provide \nsafe working conditions for both male and female workers. Specific provisions to \nthis  effect  will  be  included  in  the  bidding  documents.  The  DOW  will  reflect \nprogress in achieving the employment targets for women in the project progress \nreports and project completion report.  \n\n(vii)  Health  risks. The DOW will ensure that all civil works contractors participate in \nthe  STI  prevention  program  to  be  funded  under  the  Investment  Program  in  the \nconstruction campsites. The DOW will also ensure that similar information on the \nrisk of transmission of STIs is disseminated to local communities in the corridor of \ninfluence, in coordination with national agencies working on this issue. The DOW \nwill  include  specific  provisions  to  this  effect  in  civil  works  contracts,  and \ncompliance will be strictly monitored by a qualified international NGO, which will \nbe  engaged  and  will  operate  in  collaboration  with  the  provincial  AIDS  councils \nand health administration.  \n\n\f27 \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION  \n\n \n\n88. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  multitranche  financing  facility  would  comply  with  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount not exceeding $400,000,000 equivalent (the facility amount) to Papua New Guinea for \nthe Highlands Region Road Improvement Investment Program comprising: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nloans  in  various  currencies  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $400,000,000  in \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  interest  and \nother  terms  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  the  then  applicable  policies \nrelating to Special Funds resources and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  Framework  Financing \nAgreement presented to the Board, subject to the conditions set out in paragraph \n49 of this report;

This target also applies to road sections improved earlier. \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 2   \n\n31\n\n \n\nROAD SECTOR ANALYSIS \n \n\nThe Transport System \n\nA. \n \nThe island nature of Papua New Guinea, together with the absence of land connections \n1. \nbetween several of the mainland provinces, ensures that domestic aviation and coastal shipping \nplay  an  important  role.  The  main  commercial  port  is  Lae,  which  is  the  gateway  for  Morobe \nProvince  and  the  Highlands  region,  with  Port  Moresby  as  the  second  main  port.  The  large \nSepik,  Fly,  and  Ramu  river  systems  provide  access  to  the  interior,  and  there  are  many  small \nports  of  call  around  the  coast  and  islands  which  provide  the  means  of  access  for  some \ncommunities.  \n\nDomestic  air  services\u2014operated  by  Air  Niugini\u2014link  Port  Moresby  and  Lae  to  the \n2. \nprovincial capitals. Charter and private general aviation services link smaller centers and remote \ninland villages where there are no external connections by road. Air links provided by missions \nto  support  health  centers  and  schools  formed  an  important  part  of  the  early  development  of \ntransport within Papua New Guinea, and still retain a significant role today. \n\n3. \nRoad transport is by far the dominant passenger travel mode. The Highlands Highway, \nand roads leading from it, form the largest contiguous network, linking the Highlands provinces \nwith  the  main  port  at  Lae.  The  Highlands  Highway  branches  west  of  Mount  Hagen  into  the \nSouthern Highlands Highway and Enga Highway. It links to Madang via the Ramu Highway and \nto Popondetta (Morobe province). There are other separate smaller road networks on mainland \nPNG  in  Port  Moresby  (NCD,  Central  and  Gulf  Provinces),  Alotau  (Milne  Bay),  Wewak  (East \nSepik),  Vanimo  (Sandaun)  and  in  Western  Province,  and  there  are  networks  in  the  island \nprovinces radiating out from the provincial capitals. \n\nB. \n\nThe Road Network and Condition \n\n4. \nThe  road  network  is  classified  into  national,  provincial,  and  district  roads.  There  are \n7,600  km  of  national  roads  under  central  Government  administration  and  funding,  of  which \n2,600  km  are  sealed  and  the  remainder  are  gravel.  Provincial  and  district  roads  are  the \nadministrative  and  funding  responsibility  of  provincial  governments.  Their  number  and  total \nlength  has  been  changing  as  provinces  create  new  districts  and  designate  existing  tracks  as \nprovincial roads. The total length is about 10,000 km, of which only about 1,000 km are sealed. \nThe remainder are gravel or earth. \n\n5. \nNational  roads  provide  a  strategic  rural  network,  linking  provinces,  provincial  capitals, \nand other main population centers. National roads are categorized as (i) national routes linking \npopulation  centers  in  two  or  more  provinces  or  main  roads  traversing  the  entire  length  of  an \nisland  province  acting  as  a  collector  road;  (ii)  national  main  roads  linking  major  population \ncenters  and  districts  to  national  routes,  or  to  strategically  important  centers  (main  towns, \nharbors, and airports); (iii) national district roads within a single district linking small towns and \nvillages  to  centers  within  the  district;  and  (iv)  national  institutional  roads  linking  Government \ninstitutions  (universities,  defense  establishments,  hospitals)  to  the  national  road  network. \nProvincial  roads  are  categorized  into  provincial  trunk,  district  feeder,  local  access  and  other \nunclassified roads, including private roads and some local town roads. \n\nOnly  about  40%  of  the  national  road  network  is  considered  to  be  in  a  maintainable \n6. \ncondition, i.e., the road has not deteriorated to a point beyond which funds can be applied cost- \neffectively to maintain the road to an acceptable standard of service. For the remaining 60% of \nroads, maintenance is confined to minimum emergency repairs to keep the road passable, but \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nTraffic Volume and Vehicle Fleet  \n\nthese roads will deteriorate progressively until new funds become available for reconstruction or \nrehabilitation.  About  half  the  network  requires  some  significant  rehabilitation,  restoration,  or \nreconstruction to make the roads trafficable.   \n \nAbout 30% of the surveyed network is in the Highlands region. Based on data from the \n7. \nDepartment of Works (DOW) road asset management system (RAMS), the condition of national \nroads is 13% good, 42% fair and 44% poor. The Highlands roads are in a poorer condition than \nnational roads in general, with none classed as good and over two thirds classed as poor. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nTraffic  volumes  on  the  national  highway  network,  outside  the  urban  centers  of  Port \nMoresby and Lae, are low. About 74% of the national network (by length) carries fewer than 500 \nvehicles a day and 89% fewer than 1,000 vehicles a day. There is even less traffic on provincial \nand  lower-level  networks.  On  the  Highlands  Highway,  which  is  the  main  traffic  artery  for  the \nregion, traffic volumes vary between 500 and 2,000 vehicles a day on rural sections, with lower \nvolumes across the mountain passes and higher volumes in the more heavily populated valley \nsections. \n \n9. \nRoad vehicle registration is carried out at  provincial traffic registries and data reporting \nback to the National Land Transport Board is uneven. The most reliable information on the size \nand  growth  of  the  vehicle  fleet  comes  from  the  number  of  compulsory  third  party  insurance \npolicies  taken  out  and  recorded  by  the  Motor  Vehicles  Insurance  Trust  (MVIT).  The  latest \ninformation  dates  from  2002  and  indicates  a  registered  vehicle  fleet  of  49,000.  However,  the \naccuracy of this figure is unknown and the total is considerably lower than an earlier figure from \nthe same source in 1999 of 60,900 vehicles. \n \nD. \n \n10. \nThe  Department  of  Transport  (DOT)  is  responsible  for  national  transport  policy \nformulation, planning, safety and the regulation of transport operations. The NLTB implements \nthese  policies  in  respect  of  driver  licensing,  vehicle  safety  and  inspection,  licensing  of  heavy \nvehicles  on  interprovincial  routes,  for-hire  transport  and  motor-vehicle  dealerships.  The  DOT\u2019s \nLand Transport Division (LTD) acts as the Board\u2019s secretariat. Provincial land transport boards \nregulate  commercial  passenger  and  goods  transport  within  the  provinces,  although  in  practice \nthere is little effective control. Provincial governments are responsible for all vehicle registration \nand LTD attempts to consolidate reports at a national level but in practice the statistics are late, \nincomplete and unreliable, so the number of vehicles operating on the network is not precisely \nknown. \n \nThe DOW is responsible for management of road maintenance and capital works on the \n11. \nnational  road  network  and  provides  some  technical  advice  and  support  to  provincial \ngovernments. The National Roads Authority (NRA) has assumed maintenance responsibility for \nthe first section of the Highlands Highway between Lae and Nadzab, and it is intended that it will \nprogressively  take  on  responsibility  for  the  management  of  road  maintenance  delivery  for  all \nnational  roads,  starting  with  the  Highlands  region.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  and  National \nPlanning  (MFNP)  is  responsible  for  physical  and  economic  planning  at  national  level  and  for \napproval of the budget requests from the line agencies. It administers some minor parts of the \nroad  program  directly,  in  particular  the  District  Road  Improvement  Program.  Interagency  and \nprivate sector communications and consultation on land transport matters are facilitated by the \nTransport Sector Coordination, Monitoring and Implementation Committee. \n\nRoad Sector Institutions, Administration, and Funding \n\n\fAppendix 2   \n\n33\n\n \n\nRoad Funding and Investment \n\nProvincial  governments  are  responsible  for  the  maintenance  and  development  of  all \n12. \nprovincial  roads.  Their  technical  and  administrative  capacity  to  carry  out  this  task  varies  and \nsome  provinces  rely  on  the  provincial  arms  of  the  DOW  for  assistance,  through  formal  or \ninformal  agreements.  In  a  few  cases,  where  the  DOW  has  been  unable  to  fund  adequate \nupkeep  of  national  roads  of  importance  to  particular  provinces,  the  provinces  have  provided \nmaintenance support. \n \n13. \nThe National Road Safety Council (NRSC) is a semi-independent body that coordinates \nand  promotes  road  safety.  It  was  set  up  in  1999  and  is  chaired  by  DOT,  but  its  membership \nincludes representatives of concerned government and private agencies. It is funded from a 5% \nlevy on compulsory motor vehicle third-party insurance premiums.  \n \nE. \n \n14. \nThe present system of national road funding is in several parts: (i) the majority of funding \nis  through  annual  budget  submissions  by  the  DOW  to  MFNP,  appropriation  of  the  agreed \nallocation  through  the  national  budget,  and  disbursement  to  the  DOW  against  warrants  for \nspecific items of expenditure; (ii) the NRA receives a direct operating allocation from the budget \nand can draw monies from the newly created road fund against its road maintenance program; \n(iii)  provincial  governments  receive  a  budget  allocation  from  central  government  and  they  are \nfree  to  allocate  this  against  provincial  programs,  including  provincial  roads;  (iv)  individual \ngovernment  ministers  receive  allocations  for  expenditure  within  their  electoral  districts,  part  of \nwhich may go to provincial roads; and (v) some private companies receive tax credits in return \nfor funding maintenance of certain road sections, mainly on roads essential for access to the oil \nand gas fields and metal mining. \n \n15. \nInvestment in the road sector has averaged K500 million per year over the last 3 years. \nOf this, 15% has been spent on road upgrading, 56% on rehabilitation and replacement, 21% on \nmaintenance  (routine,  periodic,  and  emergency),  and  6%  on  operations  (road  safety,  policing) \nand  administration.  Forward  expenditure  for  2008  is  at  a  similar  level,  but  direct  central \ngovernment  expenditure  on  the  road  sector  is  projected  to  reduce  to  K150  million  a  year  by \n2012 as current donor-assisted programs end.  \n \nF. \n \n16. \nThe Government\u2019s strategy for the transport sector is designed to achieve the objectives \nof  the  Medium-Term  Development  Strategy  (MTDS)  and  is  set  out  in  the  National  Transport \nDevelopment Plan (NTDP) Update, 2006\u20132010. The NTDP is in two parts, the first addresses \nsector  policy  and  institutional  development  and  the  second  the  infrastructure  investment \nprogram.  The  NTDP\u2019s  overall  aim  is  \u201cto  provide  safe  and  dependable  transport  services  to  all \nsections  of  the  community  in  PNG  in  a  cost-efficient  and  effective  manner.\u201d  The  NTDP  vision \nincludes: (i) better transport access to education, health and other rural welfare and government \nservices, and increased personal mobility, for all persons in the community at all times; (ii) better \ntransport  access  to  production  sites  and  markets,  at  lower  transport  cost;  (iii)  enhanced \nopportunities  for  raising  income  levels  in  remote  and  impoverished  coastal  rural  areas;  and  \n(iv) lower transport costs and safer cargo and passenger movements. \n \n17. \nTo  achieve  this  aim  in  the  road  sector,  the  strategy  will  (i)  maintain  and  improve  the \nexisting  infrastructure  and  services;  (ii)  upgrade,  rehabilitate  and  carry  out  new  construction \nworks only where economically feasible; and (iii) conduct business on \"safety and security first\" \nbasis.  NTDP  proposes  to  raise  funds  directly  from  road  users  and  to  deposit  revenues  into  a \n\nGovernment\u2019s Strategy \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nRoad Transport Regulation \n\nroad  fund  to  be  managed  by  the  NRA.  The  NRA  will  assume  all  road  maintenance  functions \ncurrently  undertaken  by  the  DOW.  Initially,  the  authority  will  concentrate  on  maintenance  of \nroads in the Highlands region and this will be followed by other national highways, depending on \ntheir priority. \n \n18. \nOther  policy  initiatives  include  (i)  new  approaches  to  funding  and  finance,  in  particular \nthe introduction of road user cost recovery to generate revenues for maintenance; (ii) promoting \nstronger  partnerships  with  private  sector  companies;  (iii)  seeking  closer  working  relations \nbetween  national  and  provincial  governments;  and  (iv)  adopting  more  integrated  and  strategic \napproaches to transport planning, policy formulation, and decision-making processes. \n \n19. \nThe  road  investment  plan  identified  16  priority  sections  of  the  national  highway  for \nrehabilitation  over  the  plan  period.  Once  all  the  national  highways  are  brought  to  acceptable \nlevels,  it  is  anticipated  that  the  NRA  will  focus  attention  on  provincial  roads.  The  NRA  is \nintended to be self-sustaining, capable of generating income through various revenue measures \nto fund its operations and to carry out its designated functions and responsibilities. The priority \nroads  include  about  900  km  in  the  Highlands  region:  the  Highlands  Highway,  including  the \nSouthern  Highlands  and  Enga  Highways;  Baiyer  River  Road;  Koroba-Mendi  Road;  and  the \nPorgera-Togoba  Road.  The  Government  also  has  a  district  road  improvement  program \nadministered  by  the  Department  of  National  Planning  intended  to  fulfill  a  community  service \nobligation for roads that do not justify development on strict economic criteria. \n \nG. \n \nPublic  passenger  transport  is  provided  by  passenger  motor  vehicles  (PMVs),  mainly \n20. \nvans  and  small  buses  of  12  to  30  seats,  operated  on  a  route  licensing  system.  In  2004,  from \ninsurance records, there were about 5,300 registered PMVs in the country, of which some 1,300 \nwere in NCD, 1,000 in Lae, and 2,000 in the Highlands. There were about 1,100 taxis, almost all \nin Port Moresby.  \n \n21. \nThe largest urban PMV network is in Port Moresby, which has a planned route structure, \nalthough  this  has  not  been  reviewed  for  some  years.  Regulatory  enforcement  is  weak, \ndeviations from routes and service schedules are common, and some of the 24 routes are no \nlonger operating.  \n \n22. \nPassenger fares are regulated and fares are increased on receipt of submissions from \nthe operators and after taking account of cost increases indicated by a PMV and taxi cost model \noperated  by  the  NLTB.  Regulation  of  fares  is  undertaken  by  the  Independent  Consumer  and \nCompetition  Commission  (ICCC),  which  recently  undertook  a  comprehensive  review  of  PMV \nand taxi costs and fare structures and set a new fare determination and review process for the \nnext 5 years.1  \n \n23.  Market entry and inter-provincial routes served are regulated for \u201chire-or-reward\u201d goods \ntransport, with a focus on the Highlands Highway. Tariffs are lodged annually with the DOT or \nits appointed agent and a minimum 60-day notice of intended increases is required, with public \nrights  of  objection  and  official  determination.  Government  policy  is  to  replace  the  existing \nquantity-licensing system with a quality-based licensing system.  This would require operators to \nshow  that  they  have  appropriate  managerial  expertise,  business  experience,  and  financial \nbacking before they are granted an operating license. \n\n                                                 \n1 ICCC. 2007. PMV and Taxi Fare Review, Final Report. Port Moresby. \n\n\fAppendix 2   \n\n35\n\n \n\nRoad Safety \n\nOverloading of goods vehicles is one of the factors blamed for the rapid deterioration of \n24. \nHighlands  roads,  and  for  the  network  in  general.  An  axle  load  survey  found  that  15%  of \ncommercial  vehicles  on  the  Highlands  Highway  in  Morobe  province  were  overloaded \ncontributing  to  significant  damages  to  the  roads.  The  maximum  recorded  vehicle  weight \nexceeded the maximum allowable vehicle weight of 42 tons by 10 tons (24%). \n  \n25.  Many of the bridges in the Highlands are Bailey bridges, and while most appear to be in \ngood  condition,  some  are  cause  for  concern  at  higher  loads.  Bridge  failures  caused  by \noversized loads have occurred on the provincial network. One reason for the failure to enforce \nload limits arises from the division of responsibility between agencies. The power for performing \naxle  load  testing  rests  with  the  DOT.  However,  the  NRA  is  seeking  to  have  the  legislation \nchanged  to  improve  effectiveness  and  is  in  the  process  of  installing  a  weighbridge  on  the \nHighlands Highway near Lae. Further weighbridges at Goroka and between Mount Hagen and \nTogoba  (the  junction  between  the  Enga  and  Southern  Highlands  Highways)  have  also  been \nproposed. \n \nH. \n \n26.  While  there  is  a  complete  absence  of  up-to-date  statistical  data,  the  road  crash  and \ninjury rates for Papua New Guinea are estimated to be one of the highest in the Pacific region, if \nnot the highest. Data from 2002 indicate a road fatality rate of 40 per 10,000 registered vehicles, \nfour  times  higher  than  for  the  Fiji  Islands  and  40  times  higher  than  the  best  performing \ncountries.  The  main  causes  of  traffic  accidents  are  drunk  driving,  inadequate  road  safety \nawareness  by  drivers  and  pedestrians,  an  absence  of  uniform  traffic  engineering  standards, \nhazardous roads, and inadequate enforcement of traffic rules. \n \nADB provided technical assistance (TA)2 from 1984 to 1996. The TA established a road \n27. \naccident  reporting  and  analysis  system  within  the  LTD,  was  instrumental  in  setting  up  NRSC, \nand undertook accident black spot and remedial treatment analysis and staff training. While the \nNRSC  continues  to  operate  and  has  recently  been  revitalized  under  new  management,  the \ncomputer system for accident data analysis was lost in a fire that destroyed DOT\u2019s headquarters \noffice in the late 1990s. Since then, the NRSC has effectively taken over the lead role in road \nsafety  from  the  LTD.  It  funds  small  projects  to  educate  the  community  in  road  safety,  raise \nstandards of traffic enforcement and bring stakeholders together to tackle the issues. It plans to \nexpand into vehicle safety enforcement and to reestablish a basic traffic accident database from \nseveral years of accumulated police accident records. Road safety has yet to be fully instituted \nacross the road sector agencies; in particular, the DOW has not introduced an effective safety \naudit function into its design procedures, and no agency is carrying out hazard identification and \nsafety management across the road network. \n \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1984.

The  idea  of \nestablishing a road authority and/or road fund has been considered by a number of studies.4  \n \n6. \nThe  need  for  change  was  also  reflected  in  the  Government\u2019s  National  Transport \nDevelopment Plan, 2001\u20132010 and its revision covering 2006\u20132010, both of which called for the \nrestructuring  of  road  maintenance  organizations  and  for  the  introduction  of  a  cost-recovery \nsystem based on road user charges. \n \nD. \n\nEstablishment and Corporate Development of the NRA \n\nTo meet its objectives and responsibilities, the NRA was established as an organization \n\n7. \nwith the following characteristics:  \n \n\n                                                 \n1 National Executive Council (NEC) Decision No NG 65 of 2002. \n2 Permitting an NRA Board to be appointed. The delay between enactment in 2003 and gazetting in 2004 was due to \n\nsome delays in nominating which ministers were to supervise the NRA. \n\n3 National Roads Authority Act, Section 5. \n4 These included: (i) UNDP. 1995.

The board has seven representatives of road users and private sector bodies, together with \nfour government members (secretaries of treasury, planning, transport and works). The chair is \nselected  by  the  board  from  its  private  sector  members.  Nominations  for  the  initial  board  were \napproved by the National Executive Council (NEC) in May 2004. A second board was appointed \nin May 2008, and it is supervising the NRA as it embarks on its road maintenance activities. \n \n9. \nofficer (CEO) for the Authority in February 2007, and other senior management staff in 2008.  \n \n10. \nAs  at  September  2008,  the  NRA  had  appointed  13  managers  and  support  staff,  with \nexpertise  in  contract  management  and  maintenance  supervision,  maintenance  planning  and \nprogramming,  financial  management,  and  personnel  administration.  Three  other  positions  are \nbeing  filled,  and  approval  for  14  additional  positions  is  expected  soon.  These  positions  will \nprovide  further  resources  for  maintenance  management  and  engineering  and  for  road  fund \nmanagement.  \n \n\n2. \n\nMaintenance Planning and Delivery \n\n11. \nTo  determine  its  annual  maintenance  works  program,  the  NRA  will  use  the  objective, \nneeds-based  system  for  road  maintenance  planning  used  in  the  DOW  since  1999\u2014the  road \nasset  management  system  (RAMS).  The  system  is  being  used  to  provide  verifiable  and \nprioritized road maintenance programs, allocate available funds to credible and optimized road \nmaintenance works, determine annual road maintenance budget requirements and the level of \nroad  user  charges,  and  to  support the  transparent  monitoring  of  delivered  maintenance  works \nagainst  agreed  performance  indicators.  Using  RAMS,  the  cost-recovery  revenues  coming  into \nthe  NRA\u2019s  road  fund  will  be  allocated  to  critical  road  sections,  i.e.,  those  where  maintenance \ncan have the greatest impact by reducing vehicle operating costs.  \n \n12. \nTo complement its maintenance planning, the NRA will also be responsible for managing \nthe  delivery  of  road  maintenance  services  outsourced  to  private  contractors.  To  control \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nstandards  of  contractor  performance  and  contract  delivery,  the  NRA  will  mostly  use \nperformance-based contracts. These will require the selected contractors to take responsibility \nfor maintaining road sections to specified standards and for a specified number of years. \n \n\n3. \n\nMaintenance Financing \n\n13. \nIt is intended that funds for NRA road maintenance programs will ultimately come wholly \nfrom  road  user  charges.  The  National  Roads  Authority  Act  permits  the  NRA  to  establish  and \noperate a road fund to be funded primarily from road user charges. The road fund will be used \nprimarily  to  pay  for  the  contracting  of  road  maintenance  services  and,  ultimately,  the \nadministration expenses of the NRA. The road user charges will comprise:   \n\n \n(i)  \n\n(ii) \n\na  road  use  charge,  which  will  be  a  levy  or  surcharge  on  gasoline  and  diesel \nintended to cover the costs associated with the general use of roads; and  \na road damage charge, which will be a heavy vehicle charge, based on the laden \naxle weight of vehicles, intended to cover costs attributable to different vehicles, \ndepending on their size and weight.  \n\n \n14. \nThe principal reasons for establishing such a road fund are: (i) to secure a more reliable \nand sustainable level of funding for road maintenance than has been available from government \nbudgetary allocations, which have been subject to funding shortfalls and annual variations; (ii) to \nprotect  funds  raised  from  road  user  charges  against  raids  on  those  funds  for  use  on  other \npurposes;  (iii)  to  establish  a  close  fee-for-service  link  between  the  charges  paid  by  users  and \nthe road maintenance service received by users; (iv) to provide a lever to secure more efficient, \ncost-effective  and  customer-responsive  road  sector  management;  and  (v)  to  allow  users \nthemselves  to  have  a  greater  say  in  how  road  maintenance  funds  are  managed.  A  properly \nestablished and operating road fund is considered a prerequisite to the successful operation of \nthe NRA.  \n \n15.  When fully operational, the amounts levied by the road use charge and the road damage \ncharge  will  vary.  They  will  be  influenced  by  such  factors  as  the  volume  of  road  maintenance \nworks  to  be  undertaken  in  the  coming  year,  changes  in  road  maintenance  unit  costs,  fuel \nconsumption levels (which can be expected to increase as vehicle usage increases, along with \na growing domestic economy), the volatility of international oil prices, the national economy, and \nsimilar considerations. \n \nAs at September 2008, this cost recovery system had been only partially implemented. \n16. \nAn NEC decision in July 2005 permitted the NRA to collect revenue from: (i) a road use charge \non  fuel,  represented  by  an  increase  of  4  toea5 a  litre  on  diesel;  (ii)  a  road  damage  charge  on \nvehicles  with  a  gross  vehicle  weight  exceeding  4  tons;  and  (iii)  tax  credits  granted  by  the \ngovernment to resource companies. The road use charge currently generates about K16 million \na  year  for  the  NRA\u2019s  road  fund.  The  accumulated  amount  in  the  fund  from  this  source  is \nexpected  to  reach  almost  K50  million  by  the  end  of  2008.  Application  of  the  road  damage \ncharge currently is being worked out, and discussions on using funds from tax credits are just \nbeginning. \n \n17. \nTo  support  the  NRA  in  its  establishment  phase,  the  Government  has  been  providing  it \nwith  two  types  of  financing:  (i)  since  2005,  it  has  funded  its  administration  costs  from  annual \nrecurrent  budgets,  and  this  is  expected  to continue  until  the  road  use charge  can cover  these \n\n                                                 \n5 100 toea = 1 kina. \n\n\fAppendix 5   \n\n43 \n\ncosts; (ii) in 2007 and 2008, the government allocated K20 million a year for the NRA from the \ndevelopment budget for its maintenance and other project expenditures,6 and this is expected to \ncontinue whenever there are shortfalls in funding from road user charges.  \n \n\n4. \n\nFinancial Management and Control and Reporting on Performance \n\n18. \nTo facilitate the effective management of the NRA and its use of funds, suitable financial \nmanagement,  management  information,  and  internal  audit  systems  are  being  put  in  place. \nThese  will  cover  budgeting  for  maintenance  and  administrative  expenditures,  receipt  of \nrevenues from road user charges and other sources, depositing and accounting for these in the \nNRA  bank  account,  expenditure  planning,  cash  flow  forecasting,  financial  accounting,  and  the \nrecording  of  actual  expenditure  on  contracts.  These  will  enable  NRA  managers  to  monitor \ndetails  by  contract,  type  of  contract,  road  sections,  and  type  of  maintenance  work,  among \nothers. Standard accounting and auditing procedures, appropriate for a statutory authority, and \nconsistent  with  the  NRA\u2019s  obligations  under  the  Public  Finances  (Management)  Act,  1995  will \nbe developed.  \n \n19. \nThe NRA has a reporting responsibility to parliament through its Minister for Transport. \nThe content and form of NRA reports are intended to provide (i) sufficient information to account \nfully for the use of the proceeds from the road fund, and to allow an assessment of the NRA\u2019s \nperformance  in  meeting  its  objectives;  and  (ii)  promotion  of  the  activities  and  standing  of  the \nauthority,  and  information  to  road  users  and  the  general  public  about  the  authority\u2019s  aims, \noperations,  and  effectiveness.  Additionally,  once  the  authority  begins  its  maintenance \noperations, its achievements will be publicized through publicity programs and campaigns.    \n\n \n\n                                                 \n6 To date, K2 million of these development funds has been used to purchase the weighbridge to be installed at Lae, \n\non the Highlands Highway. \n\n \n\n\fM a in te n a n c e  O n l y  (k m )\nR o a d s  \n\nR o a d s  \n\nT o ta l  (k m )\n\n2 9 . 0\n\n4\n4\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n6\n \n\ni\n\nL IS T  O F  R O A D S  A N D  W O R K  P L A N  F O R  M A IN T E N A N C E  C O N T R A C T S\nT a b le A 6.1 :  H ig h la n d s  R e g io n  C o re  R o a d s N et w o r k  M a in t an a b le  R o a d s f o r ' M a in t en a n ce  O n ly'  C o n t ra c t s\n\n \n\nE H P\nE H P\nE H P\nE H P\nE H P\nE H P\nE H P\nE H P\n\nS H P\nS H P\nS H P\nS H P\n\nS H P\n\nS H P\n\nS H P\nS H P\nS H P\n\nS H P\n\nS H P\n\nW H P\n\nW H P\n\nW H P\nW H P\n\nP r ov\nC h im b u\nC h im b u\n\nR e f  N o\nP T 4 0 0 6 0 2\nN D 4 0 0 1\n\nR o a d  N a m e\nO ld   H ig h la n d s   H ig h w a y\nK e ro w a g i  A c c e s s\n\nS ta r t  P o i nt\nK e ro w a g i\nN R 0 7  J u n c t io n\n\nC h im b u\n\nN D 4 0 0 2\n\nC h im b u\nC h im b u\n\nN R 0 0 0 7\nN R 0 0 1 1\n\nC h im b u\n\nN D 4 0 0 3\n\nK a ra m u i A c c e s s ( G u m in e  \nR d )\nH ig h la n d s  H w\nB u n d i  H w a y  ( K u n d ia w a   - \nG e m b o g l)\nC h a u v e   R o a d\n\nK u n d ia w a  T o w n  \n( E lc o m )\nM a n g iro   B rid g e\nL a n d s lid e  s it e  2\n\nC h a u v e\n\nM o v e\n\nE n d  P oi n t\nD o n a\nK e ro w a g i  P o l.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\nThe Government of Papua New Guinea (PNG) has adopted the Medium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS), \n2005\u20132010  as  its  strategic  framework  to  promote  national  development.  The  overarching  goal  of  the  MTDS  is \nexport-driven  economic  growth,  rural  development  and  poverty  reduction,  including  through  good  governance \nand  the  promotion  of  sustainable  agriculture,  forestry,  fisheries,  and  tourism.  The  strategy  will  be  realized  by \nempowering  Papua  New  Guineans,  especially  those  in  rural  areas,  to  mobilize  their  own  resources  for  higher \nliving  standards.  The  key  priorities  for  the  period  to  2010  are  (i)  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  of  transport \ninfrastructure,  (ii)  promotion  of  income-earning  opportunities,  (iii)  basic  education  and  adult  education,  (iv) \nprimary  health  care  and  HIV  prevention,  and  (v)  law  and  justice.  In  the  transport  sector,  rehabilitation  of  the \nHighlands Highway is one of the Government\u2019s top priorities. \n\nThe  purpose of  the  Asian Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  country  strategy  and  program  in  PNG,  2006\u22122010,  is  to \nhelp the Government meet its MTDS goals. ADB and the Government have agreed that the strategic areas that \nclearly satisfy the principles and lessons are: (i) public financial management, (ii) private sector development, (iii) \nthe transport sector, and (iv) health and HIV. \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n\n1.  Key Issues  \n\nIn rural PNG, most people have land: in the Highlands region, an extended family or sub-clan may have up to 3\u2013\n5 hectares of productive land divided into 10 or more small gardens that are used to cultivate a range of food and \ncash  crops.  Households  are  generally  able  to  grow  food  to  meet  basic  household  consumption  needs;  of  the \nhouseholds  surveyed  for  the  Highlands  Region  Road  Improvement  Investment  Program,  more  than  70%  had \nsufficient food in their gardens for 3 months or more. A small household coffee garden may generate K500 from \nannual  sales.  Rural  people  also  have  extensive  family  and  clan  networks  to  assist  them  in  times  of  need. \nNonetheless, and particularly as people\u2019s livelihoods are increasingly linked to a cash economy, there are wide \ndiscrepancies in the well-being of different segments of society. In addition to low incomes, a 2001 participatory \npoverty assessment (funded by ADB) clearly indicated the non-income dimensions of poverty: specifically, people \nconsidered  they  were  poor  when  they  lacked  (i)  jobs,  (ii)  land,  (iii)  education,  (iv)  services  such  as  health  and \nwater, and (v) transport and roads. The most pressing needs were safe drinking water and usable roads. While \navailable  data  are  limited  and  need  to  be  updated,  the  risks  of  rapidly  rising  poverty  levels  in  PNG  are  clear. \nSalient issues include the following.  \n(i) \n\nIn  1997,  37%  of  the  population  lived  below  a  poverty  line  of  $350  (K461)  per  year.  A  further  17%  of \npopulation  was  unable  to  meet  the  basic  adult  food  requirement  of  2,200  calories  per  day.  In  terms  of  the \ninternational  poverty  line,  one-quarter  of  people  in  PNG  lived  on  less  than  $1/day;  54%  lived  on  less  than \n$2/day. \n\n(ii)  Poor  economic  performance  and  rapid  population  growth  have  led  to  a  sharp  increase  in  the  incidence  of \npoverty, from 37.5% in 1996 to 53.8% in 2003. It is estimated that 40% of the PNG population lived on less \nthan $1/day in 2003, while 70% were below the level of $2/day. \n\n(iii)  Poverty is concentrated in rural areas. The rural poverty rate (41%) is significantly higher than the urban rate \n(16%). The Highlands region, which contains 40% of the national population and has a poverty rate (1996) of \n38.3%, is one of the poorest regions in the country. \n\n(iv)  Five  of  the  20  most  disadvantaged  districts  are  located  in  Enga  and  Southern  Highlands  provinces,  the \n\nprovinces targeted by the first tranche of the Investment Program. \n\n(v)  The  highest  poverty  levels  occur  among  households  with  little  or  no  cash  income,  i.e.,  families  that  rely \nprimarily on subsistence agriculture, hunting, gathering and fishing to meet household consumption needs.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n58 \n \n \n\n(vi)  However,  farmers  that  grow  and  sell  trees  and  other  cash  crops  also  have  high  poverty  levels.  Overall, \n\npeople involved in the agriculture sector account for 86% of the poor. \nHouseholds headed by women are among the poorest in rural areas of PNG. \n \n\n2. Design Features \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Investment Program incorporates several strategies to facilitate the ability of communities and households to \nrealize  benefits  from  road  improvements  and  maintenance  and,  thereby,  to  reduce  poverty  in  the  Highlands \nregion. The Investment Program design includes (i) priorities for employment of local men and women for road \nrehabilitation  and  maintenance,  (ii)  contractor  specifications  for  provision  of  HIV  awareness  and  prevention \nprograms  in  construction  camps  and  neighboring  communities,  and  (iii)  an  extensive  community  relations  and \nparticipation  program  linked  to  different  aspects  of  subproject  preparation  and  implementation.  The  Investment \nProgram  includes  a  community  empowerment  project  to  be  funded  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction \n(JFPR),  which  will  (i)  incorporate  a  participatory  approach  into  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  the \nProgram,  (ii)  assist  communities  to  initiate  strategies  to  strengthen  the  social  and  economic  benefits  of  road \nimprovements, and (iii) promote equitable benefits for all gender and social groups.   \n\nThe  community  empowerment  project  will  include  components  aimed  at:  (i)  supporting  the  rehabilitation  and \nmaintenance  of  social  infrastructure  in  roadside  villages  adjacent  to  the  Investment  Program  roads; \n(ii)  developing  skills  of  rural  women  through  agricultural  extension,  alternative  livelihood  and  micro-enterprise \ntraining; (iii) raising community awareness and gender-responsive behavior changes on health (with an emphasis \non  sexually  transmitted  infections  [STI]  and  HIV),  violence  against  women  and  road  safety;  (iv)  pilot-testing \ninitiatives aimed at ensuring women\u2019s equal access to safe transportation services. All activities will be carried out \nin consultation with relevant district administration and in line with relevant provincial and/or district development \nplans. \n\nA. Findings of Social Analysis \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nThe primary beneficiaries of the Investment Program are the approximately 2 million people who live and work in \nthe Highlands region. They include the following groups of road users: (i) households living in communities along \nand in the vicinity of the rehabilitated and maintained roads, who grow and sell a range of food and cash crops; \n(ii) drivers of public motor vehicles (PMVs) that provide a range of passenger and goods transport services, and \ncommercial  truck  drivers;  and  (iii)  businesses  in  the  Highlands  region  including  vendors  at  local,  informal \nmarkets, trade store owners, coffee and other buyers and small and medium-sized enterprises in provincial and \ndistrict  towns.  National,  provincial  and  local  authorities  also  benefit  from  and  are  instrumental  for  the \nimplementation of road improvements and, particularly, the ongoing maintenance of roads. \nProject 1 includes 220 km of roads to be upgraded. The 2010 population in the road influence zonea of Project 1 \nroads is estimated at 400,000 (projected to reach 900,000 by 2025). About 225,000 people live west of Project 1 \nroads  in  Southern  Highlands  province  (projected  to  double  by  2025).  The  principal  linguistic  and  tribal  groups \ninclude  the  Huli  and  Duna  in  western  SHP;  people  belonging  to  Angal  and  other  Mendi-speaking  groups  in \ncentral Southern Highlands province; and, Enga-speakers and Ipili in Enga province. All these tribal groups have \n(i)  clan-based,  patriarchal  social  structures;  (ii)  complex  systems  of  social  and  other  exchanges  (wantok);  (iii) \nstrong  attachment  to  land  owned  collectively;  (iv)  community  leaders  who  are  chosen  on  the  basis  of \nachievements rather than heredity; (v) a highly developed system of dispute resolution that is based on notions of \nreparations and payback that often leads to tribal conflicts and fighting; and (vi) a rigid duality of gender whereby \nwomen are subordinate to men. \n\nThroughout the Highlands, people live on their clan territory, in dispersed homesteads or small hamlets of 4\u201310 \nclosely related households. An extended family of 10\u201315 adults and their children will generally have at least 2\u20133 \nhectares and, up to 5 hectares of agricultural land. Since the upgrading of portions of the Highlands Highway and \nfeeder  roads,  slightly  larger  villages  have  been  established  adjacent  to  the  roads.  Household  size  in  these \nvillages  tends  to  be  larger  (9\u201318  persons).  Men  outnumber  women  and  nearly  all  households  are  headed  by \nmen. The level of social development is low throughout the Highlands region. Adult literacy ranges from about \n10%  to  40%;  rates  for  women  are  significantly  lower  than  for  men.  The  proportion  of  school-age  children \nattending school is estimated at less than 50%. Health indicators are generally low throughout PNG, particularly \nin rural areas. HIV has reached general epidemic proportions in PNG, with 87% of HIV positive people living in \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n59 \n\nrural areas. The rural HIV prevalence rate of 1.65% is projected to increase to 5.5% by 2011. \n\nPeople living in the Highlands walk to most destinations. Every day, women walk up to several hours to reach \ntheir gardens; daily or several times a week, they walk similar distances to sell at local markets. They are often \ncarrying heavy loads as well as children. Children walk up to 4 hours per day to go to school, and health centers \nare often several hours\u2019 walk from a village. The use of PMVs and other transport is generally limited to longer \ntrips; e.g., men going to district or provincial towns, secondary students going to towns to attend school and men \nand  women  who  are  traveling  to  visit  family.  Market  vendors  do  not  use  transport  to  reach  regional  markets \nbecause  the  costs  often  exceed  the  anticipated  revenues;  in  addition,  many  PMV  drivers  will  not  carry  goods. \nWomen  use  PMV  services  much  less  than  men,  in  part  because  of  their  concerns  about  being  robbed  and/or \nassaulted when they travel. \n\nLivelihoods  in  the  Highlands  region  combine  subsistence  agriculture  (sweet  potatoes),  cash  cropping  (coffee \nand\u2014at  higher  altitudes\u2014Irish  potato  and  pyrethrum)  and  raising  livestock  (pigs  and  chicken).  The  agricultural \ninputs are limited and the yields low. Some men operate \u201cwalkabout\u201d sawmills and harvest bamboo to make mats \nused  as  house  walls.  Marketing  of  surplus  food  crops,  cash  crops  and  livestock  is  done  by  women,  selling  to \nbuyers  or  through  direct  sales  at  local  markets  located  at  villages  and  PMV  stops  along  the  roads.  Access  to \nregional  markets  or  factories  is  limited.  Local  market  sales  also  include  cooked  food  for  travelers,  handicrafts \n(bags and hats) and the resale of betel nuts and cigarettes that have been transported from coastal areas. Wage \nemployment is limited to a small number of teachers or aid post orderlies in local communities or to towns, where \nmore people obtain paid work in small businesses. The rate of job-related migration is high. Urban unemployment \nrates are very high (e.g., 38% for men) and many men in rural villages are without work. \n\nHousehold  incomes  from  sales  of  agricultural  products  or  other  local  market  sales  are  generally  very  small. \nHouseholds in communities along Project 1 roads may earn up to K500 a year from sales of coffee; and, up to \nK1,000 a year from the sale of small livestock. The average daily revenues of surveyed market vendors ranged \nfrom K24 to K50. In surveys along Project 1 roads, households were asked several questions about their level of \nwell-being: 45% of households eat meat or fish once a month or not at all; 35%, once a week or less; and, 20% \nmore  often.  About  70%  of  households  have  food  stocks  in  their  gardens  to  last  3  months  or  longer.  Asked  to \nassess their situation, just over 50% say they have just enough to meet household needs; about 35% say they \nare poor because they do not have enough to meet needs; and, 15% consider themselves to be well-off.  \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n\n \n\nAn extensive program of consultations, women\u2019s focus groups and surveys took place during preparation of the \nInvestment  Program.  At  the  inception  stage,  a stakeholder  analysis  was  carried  out  to  identify  the  primary  and \nsecondary stakeholders; their interests in the proposed project, their perceptions of current problems related to \nroad accessibility, mobility and transport services and, the resources they could bring to the achievement of the \ngoals  and  objectives  of  the  project.  Meetings  have  been  held  at  the  national  level  with  the  DOW,  Ministry  of \nTransport  (MOT),  National  Roads  Authority  (NRA),  Department  of  National  Planning  and  Monitoring  (DNPM), \nDepartment  of  Land  and  Physical  Planning  (DLPP),  Department  of  Community  Development  (DCD),  National \nAids  Council  (NAC)  and  National  Council  of  Women  (NCW);  relevant  development  partners  and  international \norganizations such as the Australian Aid for International Development (AusAID), the World Health Organization \n(WHO), other UN agencies, Population Services International (PSI), CARE, OXFAM and Save the Children; and \nconsultants engaged in ADB, AusAID and other donor-funded  projects relevant to  the Program. Other regional \nstakeholders  met  include  civil  work  contractors,  trucking  companies  and  representatives  of  major  development \nenclaves in the Highlands region, e.g., Porgera JV and Oil Search. \n\nConsultations were held with provincial and district authorities in Enga (Wabag) and Southern Highlands province \n(Mendi  and  Tari),  with  participation  from  provincial  and  district  administrators;  national  and  provincial  works \ndepartments;  provincial  community  development,  health  and  education  advisors;  provincial  AIDS  Councils; \nprovincial  and  district  women's  networks;  and  other  local  stakeholders,  including  representatives  of  the \ncommunity sector (e.g., local nongovernment organizations [NGOs], health institutions, and radio stations), and \nthe private sector (e.g., local businesses and bus or truck drivers). Along Project 1 roads, the views of the local \npopulation have been sought through small-sample surveys of households (210 households), market sellers (80 \npersons), trade store owners (60 persons), PMV drivers (100 persons) and passengers (125 persons), as well a \nprogram of consultations in 18 communities  that brought  together  up  to 300  people  in each community and, in  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n60 \n \n \n\neight villages, women\u2019s focus groups (15\u201320 women each). \n \n2.  What  level  of  consultation  and  participation  (C&P)  is  envisaged  during  the  project  implementation  and \nmonitoring?  \n\n Information sharing  \n\n Consultation  \n\n Collaborative decision making  \n\n Empowerment \n\n3. Was a C&P plan prepared? \n\n Yes  \n\n No  \n\nThe  Highlands  Road  Management  Group  (HRMG),  the  implementing  agency  for  the  Investment  Program,  will \nengage  community  relations  officers.  In  collaboration  with  HRMG  environmental  officer(s),  the  community \nrelations  officers  will  establish  a  consultation  program  for  each  subproject.  The  purpose  is  (i)  to  inform \ncommunities about the Investment Program and, in detail, about the subproject works to rehabilitate and maintain \nthe road; (ii) to provide information about the expected benefits and potential adverse impacts, as well as project \nmeasures such as compensation, environmental management, and community-based initiatives; (iii) to provide a \nforum for communities to participate in the project and express their interests, preferences and concerns about \nthe  subproject;  and,  in  general,  (iv)  to  facilitate  different  aspects  of  the  implementation  of  the  subproject. \nConsultations  with  communities  will  take  place  at  different  points  in  the  planning  and  implementation  of \nsubprojects and include the following.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nIn  the  initial  stages  of  subproject  preparation,  HRMG  will  consult  with  communities  as  part  of  the \nprocess  of  assessing  whether  a  candidate  road  meets  the  eligibility  criteria  to  be  included  in  the \nInvestment  Program.  The  support  of  communities  is  a  key  criterion,  along  with  preliminary \nassessments  about  the  potential  scope  of  additional  land  requirements,  existing  land  tenure,  and \nwhether or not there are likely to be other adverse social and environmental impacts. \nDuring  preparation  of  the  subproject  profile,  HRMG  will  organize  and/or  assist  other  parties  (e.g., \nprovincial  land  officers  and  environmental  consultants)  to  organize  consultations,  awareness \nprograms and surveys that form part of the work (a) to conduct an environmental assessment of the \nsubproject; and (b) to identify additional land requirements to upgrade roads and, as necessary, to \nprepare a resettlement plan. \nDuring the preparation and implementation of the subproject, HRMG will organize and/or assist other \nparties (e.g., provincial land officers, independent monitoring organization, and the social monitoring \nconsultant)  to  organize  consultations.  Awareness  programs  and  surveys  will  also  form  part  of  the \nwork  on  (a)  acquisition  of  land  by  DLPP  to  establish  a  public  road  reserve,  (b)  independent \nmonitoring  of  land  acquisition  activities,  (c)  environmental  monitoring  work,  and  (d)  baseline  and \nfollow-up  studies  as  part  of  the  social  monitoring  study.  HRMG  will  also  assist  as  required  with \ncommunity consultations that form part of the JFPR project.  \n\nThroughout the work on the subproject, the community relations officers and/or environmental officers from \nHRMG will meet periodically with communities in order to monitor whether there are social, environmental or \nother issues that require attention, for example, in relation to opportunities for community-based maintenance or \nresolution of grievances. These consultations will occur according to a program agreed with communities and/or \non an ad hoc basis. \nConsultations with communities along subproject roads will be designed not only to inform people about the \nsubproject or specific activities related to its preparation and implementation, but also to enable people in the \ncommunity to ask questions, make suggestions, state preferences and express concerns. HRMG will work with \ncommunity leaders to organize meetings with the community. Although different meetings may target specific \nstakeholders (e.g., affected landowners), HRMG and community leaders will encourage all members of the \ncommunity to participate. Special attention will be paid to the participation of women and any other vulnerable \ngroups. Because women are less likely to contribute to meetings that involve the entire community, HRMG will \nensure that women\u2019s focus groups are organized to obtain their views, preferences and concerns where relevant. \nC. \n1.  Key Issues \n\nGender and Development \n\n \n\nTribes  in  the  Highlands  are  patriarchal  societies,  with  traditional  roles  of  men  and  women  rigidly  defined.  The \nprimary roles of women are to bear children and to nurture the family. Women\u2019s work is to raise children, collect \nwater and firewood, and grow and provide food for their families. In the gardens, women do most of the planting, \nweeding  and  harvesting;  they  provide  45\u201370%  of  the  agricultural  labor  for  food  cropping,  and  make  significant \ncontributions  to  coffee  gardens  and  other  cash  crops. As the rural economy focuses more on cash crops and \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n61 \n\nwage  employment,  the  workload  of  women  is  increasing  within  existing  agricultural  livelihoods  through  the \nintensification  of  food  cropping  systems  and  women\u2019s  contribution  to  cash  cropping.  As  their  husbands  leave \nvillages  to  look  for  wage  employment,  women  must  take  over  their  responsibilities  for  preparing  gardens,  or \nnegotiate  with  male  relatives  for  assistance.  As  more  and  more  children  are  in  school,  the  family  labor  pool \ndiminishes. \nIn rural areas, more than three quarters of women are engaged in agricultural activities such as cultivating food \nand  cash  crops  and  raising  small  livestock.  They  generate  cash  incomes  from  the  sale  of  cash  crops  and  the \nlocal  marketing  of  small  surpluses  of  food  crops  and  livestock.  Women  walk  long  distances  every  day,  to  and \nfrom their gardens, to and from local markets, to and from sources of drinking water. When they make these trips, \nthey are generally carrying heavy loads, including sweet potatoes and other produce from their gardens that they \nare carrying home and/or to the market, as well as their children. Women and children also tend to walk when \nthey  are  going  to  schools  and  health  care  facilities.  In  general,  women  do  not  use  PMV  or  other  transport \nservices. The daily trips to and from gardens do not require public transport. PMV and other transport services \nare  often  not  available  and/or  services  to  health  care  facilities,  markets,  coffee  factories  and  towns  that  are \nbeyond  walking  distance  are  infrequent.  PMV  drivers  often  provide  only  passenger  services  and  do  not  allow \npeople to transport goods to market. The passenger fares and costs to transport goods mean that transporting \ngoods to market is often not economically viable. For  women, the use of public transport can be unsafe, since \nthey are often victims of robbery and assaults including rape. \n\nThe health status of PNG women is poor, despite some improvements in recent years. The current fertility rate is \nhigh at 4.3 (compared to 6.1 in the 1970s). However, the high maternal mortality ratio of 370 deaths per 100,000 \nlive  births  has  remained  unchanged.  Women\u2019s  physical  health  is  compromised  by  problems  associated  with \nexcessive workloads, poor nutrition and lack of access to safe water. Domestic violence causes physical injury \nand  increases  levels  of  stress  and  anxiety.  Chronic  sickness  is  often  regarded  as  a  \u201cnatural\u201d  part  of  being  a \nwoman in PNG. Based on available data from 1987 to 2005, the incidence of HIV in women aged 15\u201324 years \nwas 2\u20133 times higher than among men in this age group; the incidence of HIV continues to be significantly higher \namong women than among men in the 25\u201329 age group. The gender impacts of HIV mean that when women get \ninfected  and  become  sick,  it  not  only  affects  them  but  has  serious  consequences  for  households  and \ncommunities in PNG. \n\n2.

The  SIEE  was  prepared  by  Department  of  Works \n(DOW) on behalf of the Government of Papua New Guinea, following work carried out under the \nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA). 1  Initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were \nprepared  based  on  the  preliminary  design  information  for  all  Project  1  subprojects  that  were \nclassified  Category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines,  2003.2 \nEnvironmental  assessments  will  also  be  prepared  for  all  subprojects  in  future  in  line  with  the \nenvironmental assessment review framework (EARF) that has also been prepared. \n \n2. \nThe  Environment  (Prescribed  Activities)  Regulations,  2002  under  the  Environment  Act, \n2000  designate  projects  that  need  an  environmental  assessment  as  \u201cprescribed  activities\u201d.  The \nupgrading  and  rehabilitation  of  existing  road  sections  is  not  listed  as  a  prescribed  activity  and \ntherefore would not require an environmental permit. However the Department of Environment and \nConservation  (DEC)  has  advised  that  certain  activities,  such  as  quarry  operations,  extraction  of \ngravel  or  discharge  of  waste  water,  may  require  an  environmental  permit  depending  on  the \nduration  and  scale  of  the  activity.  The  DOW  will  therefore  disclose  the  scale  and  scope  of \nsubprojects to DEC to determine the procedures and any environmental permit needed under the \nEnvironment Act, 2000. ADB environmental requirements are stricter than PNG requirements and \nwill be applied (while also complying with the PNG requirements). \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  existing  road  infrastructure  needs  to  be  improved  and  the  Investment  Program  will \nfocus on 1,400 km of priority roads of the 2,500 km Highlands Core Roads Network. It will include \ninstitutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building  to  support  strategic  management  of  the  roads \nsector,  including  improving  environmental  management.  The  Project  1  subprojects  will  carry  out \nimprovement of 211 km of roads including bridges in Enga and Southern Highlands provinces. In \nmost  places,  the  existing  road  corridor  is  ample  for  the  proposed  rehabilitation  works  but  minor \nland acquisition will be involved in some locations. The contractor for road improvement will also \ncover  subsequent  maintenance  for  a  period  of  up  to  10  years  under  a  performance-specified \ncontract. \n \nC. \n \nThe PNG climate ranges from alpine to subtropical with diurnal temperatures from 200C to \n4. \n100C  and  annual  rainfall  exceeding  2,800  mm  a  year.  The  highlands  areas  have  recently  been \ninfluenced by El Ni\u00f1o events and the World Bank has reported that rainfall there may increase. The \nSouthern  Highlands  province  and  Enga  have  rugged  mountains,  steep  limestone  formations,  flat \nplateaus, and fertile swampy valleys. Soil types are derived from fertile volcanic sources. Seismic \nactivity  causes  landslides  and  subsidence.  Heavy  rainfall  and  ground  tremors  cause  roads  to \ndeteriorate.  \n \n5. \nThe highlands provide the catchments for many large rivers and all the roads have several \nriver crossings. River flows are highest from December to April and most of the streams and creeks \n\n Description of the Environment \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2007.

Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n65 \n\ndischarge  all  year  with  high  sediment  and  gravel  loads  being  deposited  in  the  lower  reaches. \nDuring the wet season, bridges and culverts are regularly inundated, cutting off roads and villages. \nNone of the rivers near the subproject roads is subject to industrial pollution. The nearby industries, \nincluding  the  Porgera  Mine  (Enga)  and  the  Hides  Gas  Field  (Southern  Highlands),  have \nenvironment  management  systems  based  on  international  standards  and  are  well  away  from  the \nproposed subproject roads. The swamps used to cultivate water cress and taro will not be affected \nduring  construction.  Surface  and  groundwater  should  not  be  significantly  affected  by  the \nimplementation of the subprojects. \n \n6. \nSubsistence  agriculture  dominates  the  Highlands\u2019  regional  economy  and  throughout  the \nProject  1  subprojects  almost  all  areas  below  2,400  meters  above  sea  level  are  cultivated  with  a \nvariety of crops (especially coffee), grasslands, and shrub-lands. There are also groves of timber \ntrees  (especially  Casuarina  and  Eucalyptus  species)  and  patches  of  regrowth  forest.  Cash  crops \nare also grown.  \n \n7. \nForest areas are visible in between the agriculture but there are no undisturbed forests near \nthe Project 1 roads and there is no large-scale timber extraction. There is some small-scale saw-\nmill  production  from  forests  to  provide  timber  and  non  timber  products  for  the  construction  of \ndwellings and crafting artifacts. The nearest timber authority (Pi Tukure) is some 20 km to the north \nof  the  Nipa\u2013Ambua  subproject  road.  Logging  is  unlikely  to  increase  if  these  roads  are  improved. \nThe human impact is most pronounced in areas where grasslands created by numerous cycles of \nforest  clearance  for  agriculture  and  reversion  to  fallow  have  gradually  transformed  forest  to \ngrassland.  There  are  no  valuable  ecological  resources,  protected  sites,  areas  protected  for  their \nnatural habitats, or rare or endangered species near the Project 1 roads. \n \n8. \nQuality of life is constrained by high population densities and strong agricultural pressures. \nMonthly income levels are low and the subproject areas include some of the most disadvantaged \ndistricts  in  PNG.  The  exceptions  are  the  few  people  who  earn  higher  wages  at  the  local  oil  and \ngold industrial complexes.  \n \n9. \nThere  are  no  sites  of  cultural  significance  near  the  Project  1.  There  are  chapels  and \nchurches nearby in some villages. There are graves placed within sight some of the roads but at \nleast 5m outside the road corridor away from where rehabilitation works would take place.  \n \n10. \nSchools  are  set  well  back  from  the  Project  1  roads.  Traditional  houses  built  of  light \nmaterials are located along some of the roads. In many areas, the traditional style involves fences \nthat are higher than 2 m and mud walls next to the roads, creating a segregated compound for the \ninhabitants away from the roads.  \n \nD. \n \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental  Impacts  and  Mitigation  Measures  Associated  with  Planning, \nLocation and Design \n\n \nThe  environmental  impacts  associated  with  subprojects  under  Project  1  will  be  generally \n11. \ninsignificant  as  the  works  involve  only  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  existing  roads  within  the \nexisting  corridor.  The  Investment  Program  will  comply  with  the  Environment  Act,  2000,  including \nnotifying the DEC of subprojects and designs (under section 48).   \n \n12. \nSensitive receivers have been assessed and it was found that the residential dwellings near \nthe subproject road are generally set back sufficiently far to be unaffected by traffic fumes. Road \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\ntraffic noise will not be sufficient to affect the sensitive receivers. There are no schools or medical \nfacilities  near  the  subproject  road.  Roadside  graves  are  set  back  from  the  working  areas.  The \noccasional  roadside  tea  and  food  stalls  are  also  set  back  from  the  likely  working  areas  for  road \nrehabilitation. During the detailed design phase and in preparation for the construction phase, the \nprogram  support  consultant  and  the  Highlands  Road  Management  Group  (HRMG)  will  prepare \ntender documents to ensure that contractors will be prepared to mitigate environmental impacts. \n \n13. \nTo  comply  with  best  international  practices  and  ADB  guidelines,  the  procurement \nprocedures  will  follow  ADB  Guidelines  on  Environmentally  Responsible  Procurement  (2007). 3 \nProcurement documents will specify that contractors will service and maintain powered mechanical \nequipment  in  a  safe  way  that  will  not  cause  significant  impacts  on  the  environment.  Overall \nenvironmental impacts will be addressed, and the proposed mitigation measures for the roads are \nsummarized  in  the  summary  environmental  management  plan  matrix  in  the  IEE.  Detailed  EMPs \nare presented in the IEE reports for each subproject.  \n \n14. \nThe requirements in the contract will include full implementation of the EMP. The contractor \nwill also be required to engage capable and trained staff or site agents to take responsibility for the \nenvironmental management at the working level. The effective implementation of the EMP will be \naudited as part of the loan conditions. The DOW (the Implementing Agency) will also ensure that it \nhas  enough  resources  to  fulfill  the  requirements  of  the  law  and  guide  contractors  on  the \nenvironmental aspects of road construction. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Impact and Mitigation Measures During Construction Phase \n\n \nSite clearing may involve removal of trees and vegetation that will contribute to soil erosion \n15. \nduring construction in the rainy season. In the construction phase, the physical impacts will be from \nearthworks  and  may  affect  air  quality  and  cause  noise.  There  will  be  no  significant  effect  on \ngroundwater. The potential impacts on surface water from the use of bitumen can be controlled by \nfollowing  prescribed  management  plan  procedures  and  the  mitigation  measures  proposed  in  the \nenvironmental  management  plan.  No  significant  impacts  should  arise  if  implementation  of  the  \nenvironmental  management  plan  is  carried  out  properly  and  is  adequately  budgeted.  Monitoring \nwill be undertaken and, if complaints arise, mitigation measures will be reviewed and adjusted, as \nrequired. Air quality will be measured to ensure that the impacts are within acceptable levels.  \n \n16. \nConstruction  waste  and  solid  waste  will  be  addressed  properly  to  avoid  potential  soil \ncontamination and nuisance to the public. Fuels, lubricants, solid wastes, and material stockpiles \ncan all have water quality impacts, which can be avoided by proper storage of the materials, proper \ndisposal, and avoiding stockpiling near water sources. If complaints are received, possible sources \nof the problem will be investigated and water samples will be taken and analyzed, and compared \nwith  the  baseline  and  with  the  Water  Quality  Criteria  Regulation,  2002.  For  possible  erosion \nproblems,  engineering  controls  that  include  erosion  protection  measures  will  be  designed  and \ninstalled to control soil erosion at all the constructed works and in peripheral areas, particularly in \nborrow areas and along haul tracks. Public safety, particularly of pedestrians and children may be \nthreatened  by  the  excavation  of  the  trenches  for  side  drain  construction,  therefore  a  safety  and \nhealth plan will be submitted by the contractor. \n \n17. \nNo significant ecological impacts are expected as the Project 1 subprojects will not be near \nany  national  parks,  wildlife  sanctuaries,  protected  forests,  or  forest  management  areas.  They  do \nnot  affect  any  land  near  monuments  of  cultural  or  historical  importance.  Poaching  of  protected \n\n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2007.

Manila.   \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n67 \n\nanimals  will  be  banned  on  all  subproject  sites,  in  compliance  with  the  Fauna  (Protection  and \nContract) Act, 1966.  \n \n18. \nThe  construction  of  subprojects  will  not  involve  a  large  amount  of  physical  works  and  no \ndisplacement  of  housing  or  other  permanent  structures  is  expected.  The  social  impacts  of  the \nconstruction stage are expected to be acceptable to the local community. Where small parcels of \nadditional land are required, there may be small losses of crops, trees, and/or secondary structures \nbut compensation will be provided in line with ADB guidelines. \n\n \n3. \n\nEnvironmental Impact and Mitigation Measures During Operations Phase \n\n \n19. \nTraffic  on  all  subproject  roads  will  amount  to  a  few  hundred  vehicles  per  day  and  it  is \nunlikely  that  this  will  lead  to  any  significant  noise  disturbance,  accumulations  of  gaseous \nemissions, or particle emissions. No significant effect on groundwater or surface water is expected \nand waste management will be controlled through the maintenance contracts.  \n \nThe  main  environmental  impacts  during  the  operations  phase  will  be  soil  erosion,  water \n20. \nquality and community safety. Soil erosion will be prevented by engineering controls in the detailed \ndesigns,  including  flood  and  erosion  control  on  either  side  of  the  embankment  in  case  of  heavy \nrains.  However,  this  may  cause  natural  streams  and  irrigation  channels  to  become  silted.  Public \nsafety will need to be ensured particularly on newly constructed or upgraded roads where vehicle \nspeeds  are  expected  to  increase.  A  detailed  EMP  for  each  subproject  (including  a  table  that \npresents  the  project  activities,  potential  environmental  impacts,  mitigation  measures,  institutional \nresponsibility  and  supervision,  and  the  monitoring  plan)  are  presented  in  the  IEE  of  each \nsubproject. \n \nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirements, Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n1. \n\nInstitutional Requirements \n\n \n21. \nAn  international  environmental  specialist  will  be  engaged  intermittently  for  10  person-\nmonths  as  part  of  the  Investment  Program  support  consultant\u2019s  team.  The  primary  tasks  of  the \ninternational  environmental  specialist  will  be  to  (i)  strengthen  the  environmental  management  of \nthe  Project  during  detailed  design,  bidding  process,  contract  process,  construction,  and \nimplementation; (ii) supervise and guide the environmental assessment process for all subprojects; \n(iii)  supervise  implementation  of  the  EMP  in  all  subprojects;  and  (iv)  undertake  institutional \nstrengthening, including on-the-job training for the environment  and environment specialist of the \nDOW  by  giving  major  tasks  to  them  in  all  of  these  activities.  The  international  environmental \nspecialist  will  report  directly  to  the  program  support  consultant  and  the  environment  officer  will \nreport to DOW. They will be accountable and responsible for the implementation of the EMP. The \ndedicated  international  environmental  specialist  and  the  environment  officer  will  coordinate \nimplementation  of  the  EMP  of  the  subprojects.  The  DOW  will  allocate  sufficient  resources  to  the \ninternational  environmental  specialist  and  the  HRMG  environment  officer  to  enable  them  to \nundertake  their  tasks  to  supervise  and  monitor  the  environmental  assessment  process  and  to \nmonitor the EMP implementation of all subprojects.  \n \n22. \nBefore  implementation  of  the  subproject  packages,  the  DOW  and  the  program  support \nconsultant  will  notify  DEC  in  accordance  with  its  prescribed  format,  for  its  endorsement  of  the \nenvironmental assessments required by the Government. The DOW through the program support \nconsultant  will  have  the  responsibility  of  ensuring  all  mitigation  measures  described  in  the  EMPs \nare  implemented  by  the  contractors  for  each  subproject.  The  environmental  assessment  review \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\nPublic  consultation  was  conducted  from  January  to  May  2008  in  the  provincial  capitals.  It \n\nframework  will  include  a  general  description  of  the  anticipated  environmental  impacts,  screening \nand  classification  procedures,  environmental  assessment  of  subprojects  in  future  tranches,  and \ncompliance with all PNG statutory requirements.  \n \nOverall implementation of the EMP will be the DOW\u2019s responsibility. Other parties involved \n23. \nin  implementing  the  EMP  include  contractors  and  government  agencies,  including  HRMG  and \nprogram support consultant management. Since several government  agencies will be involved in \nimplementing  the  EMP,  induction  training  workshops  will  be  designed  by  the  international \nenvironment specialist to suit several levels of audiences (managerial, site agents, and staff).   \n \nF. \n \n24. \nincluded local residents, business owners, community leaders, and local officials.  \n \n25. \nThe results indicated that road improvements were welcome because they would facilitate \naccess and they had the potential to lower vehicle operating costs. All sections of the community \nwere keen to gain employment on road works in their areas. Road safety was also raised. There \nwas a clear appreciation among stakeholders about how they might fully benefit economically and \nsocially  from  improvement  of  roads.  The  IEE  reports  on  the  various  subprojects  report  on  these \nconsultations.  \n \nG. \n \nSecondary data, public consultations, and route reconnaissance were used to complete the \n26. \nenvironmental assessments. During the detailed design of the four subprojects, the EMPs will be \nupdated  and  made  as  site-specific  as  possible.  Environmental  impacts  will  be  mitigated,  and \nrecommended  institutional  arrangements  will  be  followed.  Capacity  will  be  built  to  improve \nenvironmental  capability  and  to  ensure  the  subprojects  comply  with  statutes  and  with  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements.  Implementation  of  mitigation  measures  will  be  checked  and  monitored  by  the \ninternational  environmental  specialist  together  with  the  environment  officer  in  the  HRMG  and  the \nprogram support consultant.  A mechanism will be included to address unexpected impacts. \n \n27.  Most  anticipated  environmental  impacts  will  take  place  during  the  construction  phase  and \nwill  require  environmental  monitoring.  Environmental  reporting  will  be  included  in  the  monthly \nmonitoring  reports  throughout  this  phase.  Implementation  of  environmental  mitigation  measures \nwill be the responsibility of the contractors and will be included in contracts.  \n \n28. \nContractor  environmental  awareness  training  will  be  undertaken  by  the  international \nenvironmental specialist and the environment officer. They will also assist the DOW and the NRA \nto develop environmental awareness at all levels. The IEE (including the EMP of subprojects) will \nbe  used  as  a  basis  for  an  environmental  compliance  program.  Environmental  impacts  related  to \nthe  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  MFF  subprojects  will  be  carried  out  and  reported,  at  least \nquarterly, as part of the project performance report and twice a year to ADB. \n \nH. \n \n29. \nThe  DOW  as  the  executing  agency  will  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the \nenvironmental assessment review framework (EARF), including preparation of an IEE, SIEE, EIA, \nor SEIA, if warranted, and implementation of environmental monitoring. Public consultations will be \ncarried out and the DOW will submit the required documentation to ADB.  \n\nEnvironmental Assessment Review Framework \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n69 \n\nThe program support consultant will ensure appropriate environmental assessment reports \n30. \n(incorporating the EMP) are submitted to ADB in time for review with the periodic financing request \nand before contracts are signed or work begins. The consultant will also ensure that the EMP and \nall required mitigation measures during construction are included in the contractors\u2019 contracts, with \nrequirements  to  update  the  EMP  in  response  to  any  unexpected  impacts.  The  program  support \nconsultant will ensure that the EMP and all mitigation measures during construction are budgeted \nand fully implemented. \n \nDuring  the  implementation  of  the  Investment  Program,  ADB  will  review  environmental \n31. \nassessment  reports  and  fulfill  the  advance  120-day  disclosure  requirement  where  necessary \nbefore  a  periodic  financing  request  is  submitted  to  ADB.  It  will  monitor  EMP  implementation  and \nconduct  due  diligence  as  part  of  MFF  reviews.  ADB  will  assist  the  DOW  to  carry  out  its \nresponsibilities  and  to  build  capacity  and  will  ensure  that  the  DOW  conducts  the  required \nconsultations with affected groups and local NGOs and that it provides relevant information on the \nproject\u2019s  environmental  issues  at  these  consultations.  An EARF  has  been  prepared  (available  as \nSupplementary  Appendix  H)  that  presents  the  general  anticipated  environmental  impacts, \nsubproject  selection  criteria,  classification  procedure,  and  subproject  environmental  assessment \nprocedure.  The  EARF  will  guide  the  preparation  and  approval  of  environmental  assessments  of \nfuture projects likely to be financed under the Investment Program.  \n \nI. \n \n32. \nThe  IEE  reports  for  the  subproject  packages  under  Project  1  reveal  that  impacts  can  be \nmitigated to acceptable levels. The IEE reports were based on the road designs for rehabilitation. \nAt  the  implementation  stage,  HRMG  will  monitor  the  implementation  of  mitigation  measures  and \nmonitoring  programs  specified  in  each  IEE.  With  these  measures  in  place,  it  is  predicted  that  all \npotential  environmental  impacts  can  be  mitigated  to  insignificant  levels,  and  therefore,  no  further \nimpact  assessment  is  considered  necessary.  It  is  also  envisaged  that  environmental  impacts \nidentified by the study will not result in any residual impacts.  \n \n33. \nmanagement of all subprojects in future tranches. \n \n\nThe  EARF,  prepared  for  the  MFF,  will  guide  the  environmental  assessment  and \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n\n1. \nA  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  for  the  Investment  Program  and  short \nresettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  for  Project  1  subprojects  in  compliance  with  the  ADB \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995). These documents provide guidance on the policies and \nprocedures  for  payment  of  compensation  to  affected  people  for  lost  or  damaged  assets  and \nminor  land  acquisition.  At  the  beginning  of  each  project,  the  policies  and  provisions  of  the \nresettlement framework will be reviewed and, as required, updated to reflect the conditions and \nrequirements  for  upgrading  roads,  but  without  lowering  the  standards  set  out  in  the  present \nresettlement framework. The resettlement plans will be updated based on detailed engineering \ndesign during implementation of the Investment Program. \n \nIn the case of Project 1, the additional land required to improve roads in some sections \n2. \nwill be minor, averaging between 0.5 and 2.5 meters (m) increase in road width. There will be \nno  displacement  of  housing  and  affected  people  will  experience  small  losses  of  crops,  trees, \nfences or other secondary structures. The total estimated land to be acquired for the Project 1 is \n41.85  hectares  (ha).  The  estimated  total  number  of  affected  persons  is  152,  distributed  in  the \nfour subproject areas as follows: 40 in Hiwinda Junction\u2013Koroba, 30 in Nipa\u2013Magarima\u2013Ambua, \n55 in Mendi\u2013Kandep, and 27 in Laiagam\u2013Porgera.   \n \nThe existing roads in the Highlands region (except from Mt. Hagen to Mendi corridor) are \n3. \ngenerally situated on customary land, the use of which has been agreed in consultation with the \nclans  and  communities  that  jointly  own  the  land.  In  order  to  expedite  implementation  of  \nProject  1,  use  of  the  land  required  to  upgrade  the  roads  will  be  agreed  by  clans  and \ncommunities  through  a  memorandum  of  agreement  (MOA).  The  Government  has  acquired  a \npublic  road  reserve  from  Lae  to  Mendi  and  will  formally  acquire  land  along  all  project  roads. \nWhile  the  DOW  is  currently  in  the  process  of  reviewing  the  requirements  for  public  road \nreserves, the resettlement framework covers the land acquisition impacts of up to 10 m width of \nroad, road clearance, and other infrastructure (e.g., drainage and culverts) under the Investment \nProgram for upgrading, rehabilitation, and maintenance.  \n \n4. \nThe Investment Program is a comprehensive, 10-year program to upgrade, rehabilitate, \nand  maintain  roads  in  the  Highlands  Highway  network  in  PNG.  The  road  selection  criteria \nensure  minimizing  land  acquisition  and  its  impacts.  The  criteria  will  be  used  to  screen  and \nidentify  suitable  roads  (or  subprojects)  eligible  for  financing  under  the  Investment  Program \nsubprojects. The routine and periodic maintenance of roads under the Investment Program will \nnot  require  the  acquisition  of  any  land;  all  maintenance  will  be  carried  out  within  the  existing \nroadway. \n \n5. \nThe  Investment  Program  entitlement  matrix  is  in  Table  A17.  Affected  people  will  be \ncompensated  for  any  loss  of  or  damage  to  land,  crops,  trees,  temporary  structures  or  other \nassets, as per the policies of this resettlement framework. All costs for the Investment Program \nrelated  to  land  acquisition,  compensation  and  allowances,  operation  and  administration  costs, \nsurveys, monitoring and reporting will be financed by the Government.  \n \n6. \nCompensation  will  be  paid  in  cash  at  replacement  cost.  In  addition  to  compensation, \naffected  persons  are  entitled  to  assistance,  e.g.,  to  help  them  move  to  temporary  shop \nstructures,  to  reimburse  them  for  disruption  of  businesses,  or  to  move  personal  possessions. \nAffected  persons  will  also  receive  priority  for  employment  for  Investment  Program  civil  works \nand ongoing maintenance.  \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n71 \n\nThe Department of Works (DOW), as the Executing Agency for the Investment Program, \n7. \nhas overall responsibility for managing the planning, implementation, and monitoring related to \nacquiring  use  rights  for  additional  land,  as  well  as  for  paying  compensation  for  damage  to \nproject-affected  land.  The  DOW  has  delegated  to  Highlands  Road  Management  Group \n(HRMG),  the  Implementing  Agency  for  the  Investment  Program,  responsibility  for  carrying  out \nthe  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  land  activities  to  improve  roads,  including \npreparation of the subprojects and resettlement plans and all consultations.  \n \nHRMG will monitor and report twice a year to DOW and ADB on all activities associated \n8. \nwith  the  MOA  and  payment  of  compensation  to  affected  persons.  HRMG\u2019s  monitoring  will \ninclude: (i) compliance with agreed policies and procedures; (ii) prompt approval, allocation and \ndisbursements  of  funds  and  payment  of  compensation  to  affected  persons,  including \nsupplemental  compensation  for  additional  and/or  unforeseen  losses;  (iii)  availability  of  other \nresources  and  efficient,  effective  use  of  these  resources;  and  (iv)  requirements  for  remedial \nactions. \n \nHRMG  will  recruit  an  independent  monitoring  organization  to  conduct  external \n9. \nmonitoring  for  the  subprojects.  The  monitoring  organization  will  be  recruited  and  mobilized  at \nthe  beginning  of  the  first  tranche  of  the  Investment  Program  and  will  monitor  and  report  to \nHRMG, the DOW, and ADB on all activities related to additional land requirements, community \nconsultations, preparation of resettlement plans, payment of compensation, and social impacts.  \n \n10. \nThe  key  consultations  will  occur  before  and/or  as  part  of  (i)  the  screening  and \npreparation of the subsequent projects, (ii) the MOA negotiation and carrying out of the detailed \nmeasurement  survey  (DMS)  and  social  surveys,  (iii)  disclosure  and  review  of  the  draft \nresettlement plan, and (iv) the land investigation and preparation of land investigation reports for \nto  establish  the  public  road  reserve.  Disclosure  of  the  resettlement  plan  will  comply  with  the \nADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2005). \n \n11. \nGrievance redress mechanisms will be established to ensure that all grievances on any \naspect of land acquisition and/or compensation for affected assets are resolved in a timely and \nsatisfactory  manner.  The  mechanisms  will  be  based  on  the  provisions  of  the  Land  Disputes \nSettlement  Act.  As  a  first  step,  traditional  local  mediation  will  be  used,  using  appointed  and \ntraditional leaders. In the event of grievances that cannot be resolved through local mediation, \nthe matter will be referred to the land court system.  \n \nDuring the initial stages of  implementation, a training program will be established within \n12. \nthe  HRMG  to  build  (i)  understanding  of  government  policies  and  procedures  for  acquisition  of \ncustomary land, including MOA and state alienation of land; (ii) knowledge of ADB policies and \nprocedures  for  land  acquisition  and  compensation;  (iii)  understanding  of  how  government  and \nADB  policies  and  procedures  relate  to  the  requirements  of  the  Investment  Program;  and  \n(iv)  expertise  in  carrying  out  surveys  and  data  collection  to  prepare  detailed  measurement \nsurveys and land investigation reports, community consultations, and awareness programs. The \ntraining  will  target  people  from  the  DOW  and  HRMG,  provincial  and  district  lands  officers  in \nsubproject areas, staff of the office of the Valuer General and any other organizations involved \nin land acquisition and compensation activities.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fType of Impact \n\nEntitled Person \n\nExpected Results \n\nImplementation Issues \n\nTable A17: Highlands Region Road Improvement Investment Program Entitlement Matrix \n\n \n\nTemporary use of land \n\nCustomary land: \nLand users as \nrecognized by clan \nleaders \n\nPermanent use of land \n(including garden and \nresidential land) \n \n\nCustomary land: \nLand users as \nrecognized by clan \nleaders \n\nState-owned land: \nUsers or \noccupantsa \n\nState-owned land: \nUsers or \noccupants \n(footnote a)   \n\nAnnual crops \n\nOwners of the \ncrops \n\nEntitlements \n\nAffected Land \n\nUse of the land will be acquired through negotiated \nleases with landowners. \nCash compensation at replacement cost will pay for \ndamaged crops, fences or other structures on project-\naffected land. \nIn the case of extraction of materials (e.g., gravel) from \nthe land, the civil works contractor will negotiate directly \nwith the landowner to reach agreement regarding the \npayment of royalties. \nNo compensation will be paid for use of the land. \nCash compensation at replacement cost will be paid for \nany damaged crops, trees, fences or other structures on \nproject-affected land. \nThe users or occupants will remove themselves from the \nland at their own expense, as per the Land Law. \nUse of the land will be acquired through a negotiated \nmemorandum of agreement with landowners. \nCash compensation at replacement cost will be paid for \nany damaged crops, fences or other structures on \nproject-affected land. \nNo compensation will be paid for use of the land. \nCash compensation at replacement cost will be paid for \nany damaged crops, trees, fences or other structures on \nproject-affected land.  \nThe users or occupants will remove themselves from the \nland at their own expense, as per the Land Law. \n\nAffected Assets \n\nCompensation for loss of or damage to annual crops on \nproject-affected land as follows: \n(i) affected persons to be given notice to harvest crops \nbefore clearance or removal from required land,  \nOR, if affected persons are not able to harvest;
