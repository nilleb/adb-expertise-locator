The Investment Program will include (i) projects to improve \nabout 1,400 km of the HCRN, to be funded through four or more \ntranches  under  this  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF); \n(ii)  design  and  supervision  of  road  improvement  works, \npreparation  and  administration  of  long-term  road  maintenance \ncontracts  for  the  entire  2,500  km  of  the  HCRN,  and  capacity \ndevelopment  of  road  agencies;  and  (iii)  monitoring  the \nsocioeconomic benefits of the improved and maintained roads in \nthe Highlands region. Support will also be provided for policies \nsuch as road user charges (to increase the resources available for \nroad maintenance). In addition, technical assistance (TA) will be \nprovided to support the Department of Transport to prepare a new \nNational Transport Development Plan (NTDP) for 2011\u20132020. \n   \nMultitranche Financing  ADB\u2019s multitranche financing facility is the most suitable modality \nFacility  for financing the Investment Program because: (i) it supports the \nGovernment\u2019s long-term vision for the sector, as outlined in the \ncurrent NTDP, 2006\u20132010; (ii) it enables ADB to sustain the long-\nterm  partnership  that  is  needed  to  institutionalize  road \nmaintenance; (iii) it allows ADB to strengthen and improve the \nNTDP and actively to pursue policy dialogue throughout the life of \nthe Investment Program; (iv) it responds to the long-term capacity \ndevelopment needs of the road agencies; (v) it provides flexibility \nto  the  Government  in  terms  of  timing  and  the  size  of  the \ninvestments for each tranche; (vi) it provides an opportunity to \napply lessons from early tranches to guide subsequent tranches \nand  to  include  incentives  for  reforms  and  implementation \nefficiency;  and  (vii)  it  provides  comfort  to  private  companies \ninterested in pursuing long-term opportunities in the road sector. \n   \nRationale  The Highlands region is a major contributor to the PNG economy \nthrough its agricultural and mineral exports. It is also home to 40% \nof the country\u2019s population, who rely almost exclusively on the ", "ii \nroad  network  for  movement  of  people  and  goods.  The  road \nnetwork is vulnerable because of the mountainous terrain, the \nfragile geological conditions, and the climate. The Government \nand  its  development  partners  have  invested  significantly  in \nimproving the road network, but a lack of regular maintenance has \nleft the network in a poor condition. There is a need to (i) initiate a \nprogram of regular maintenance on all HCRN roads that are in \ngood condition, and (ii) improve those HCRN roads that are in a \npoor condition and ensure that routine maintenance begins on \nthese roads as soon as the improvement works are done.  \n \nThe current NTDP provides a framework of policies and strategies \nfor  a  sustainable  road  system  in  PNG.  It  has  led  to  the \nestablishment  of  the  National  Roads  Authority  (NRA)  with \nresponsibility for maintaining the road network and a road fund \nfinanced through road user charges to finance road maintenance. \nThe NRA and the road fund are managed by an independent \nboard, with representatives from road users, the private sector, \nand the Government. There is a need to translate these initiatives \ninto a workable system by (i) strengthening the NRA\u2019s capacity to \nplan  and  manage  road  maintenance  works,  (ii)  seeking  more \nfinancing for the road fund by rationalizing road user charges, and \n(iii)  awarding  long-term  performance-based  road  maintenance \ncontracts. With a functioning board and staff recruitment for the \nNRA underway, the Government is keen to support the MFF. It \nwill help to enable implementation of the NTDP and to ensure a \nsustainable road system in the Highlands region. This initiative \ncould serve as model for other regions of PNG.   \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Investment Program will make ports, markets, and livelihood \nopportunities more accessible, and will lead to savings in travel \ntime and transport costs. It will enable use of the natural, mineral \nand human resources of the Highlands region to be maximized, \ncontributing  to  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development \nStrategy  (MTDS),  2005\u20132010  objectives  of  (i)  export-driven \neconomic growth; (ii) rural development and poverty reduction; \n(iii)  good  governance;  and  (iv)  promotion  of  sustainable \nagriculture, forestry, fisheries, and tourism.  \n   \nInvestment Plan  The total Investment Program cost is estimated at $750 million \nequivalent. The total cost of Project 1, including taxes, duties, \nphysical, and price contingencies, interest, and other charges is \nestimated at $140 million equivalent. \n ", "iii \n   \nInvestment Program \n \nAmount \nItem    ($ million) \nA.

The financing from the Special Funds resources will follow \nthe provisions of the special operations loan regulations, and the \nOCR financing will follow the provisions of the ordinary operations \nloan  regulations  applicable  to  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based  loans.  Both  financing  will  be  subject  to \nmodifications  that  may  be  included  under  individual  loan \n     ", "iv \nagreements. The Government will provide counterpart financing of \n$200  million  equivalent,  and  co-financing  of  $150  million \nequivalent is expected. \n \nTo help finance Project 1, the first tranche will comprise of two \nloans  totaling  $100.0  million  equivalent  from  Special  Funds \nresources (a \u201chard-term\u201d ADF loan of $28.8 million equivalent and \na \u201csoft-term\u201d ADF loan of $71.2 million equivalent), to help finance \nProject 1. The ADB loans will finance 71% of the total cost of \nProject 1. The ADF concessionary loans will both have a term of \n32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; interest under the \nhard-term loan will be at 3.15% per annum for the life of the loan \nwhile interest under the soft-term loan will be at 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. Other \nterms and conditions will be set forth in the related draft Loan \nAgreements. The Government will finance the remainder of the \ntotal Project cost in an amount of $40 million equivalent, including \nlocal taxes and duties.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  The utilization period will be for 10 years from 2009 to 2018 with \nthe last periodic financing request to be submitted by 2014. Each \nspecific  loan  will  have  its  own  closing  date  to  match  its \nimplementation period.  \n   \nEstimated Program  31 December 2018  \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Department of Works (DOW) \n   \nImplementation  The  DOW  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Investment \nArrangements  Program. The DOW will also be the Implementing Agency for the \nroad  improvement  works.  The  NRA  will  be  the  Implementing \nAgency  for  road  maintenance.  This  will  include  all  road \nmaintenance works contracted directly by the NRA or transferred \nfrom  the  DOW.  The  Highlands  Road  Management  Group \n(HRMG), which is the DOW project implementation unit for the \nongoing ADB loans, will be responsible for implementing road \nimprovement  works.  A  project  implementation  unit  will  be \nestablished in the NRA. \n   \nProcurement  All  ADB-financed  procurement  for  goods  and  services  will  be \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). International competitive \nbidding procedures will be followed for all contracts over $3 million \nfor civil works and $0.5 million for goods. National competitive \nbidding  will  be  used  for  contracts  under  these  thresholds. \nShopping can be used for goods with contract values lower than \n$100,000,  as  appropriate.  Contracts  have  been  packaged  to \nattract international contractors as well as to promote national \ncontractors. \n   ", "v \n \nConsulting Services  Consulting services will be required for implementation support \nand capacity development. Key tasks include (i) design of road \nimprovement  works;  (ii)  preparation  of  bid  documents, \nprocurement support, and supervision of road improvement and \nlong-term maintenance contracts; (iii) performance management; \n(iv) preparation of subsequent projects; (v) capacity development; \nand  (vi)  socioeconomic  monitoring.  The  capacity  development \nactivities will focus on, among others, strengthening of the DOW, \nNRA  and  National  Road  Safety  Council  (NRSC)  in  financial \nmanagement,  road  maintenance  contracting,  road  safety,  and \nrationalizing road user charges.  \n \nProject  1  will  require  a  total  of  1,266  person-months  (362 \ninternational and 904 national) of services from consulting firms. \nAdditional  consulting  services,  if  necessary,  will  be  procured \nunder  subsequent  projects.  The  consulting  services  will  be \nfinanced from the ADB loans. The DOW will select and engage \nthe consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method. \n   \nInvestment Program  While the entire 1.9 million population of the Highlands region will \nBenefits and  benefit from the Investment Program, the immediate beneficiaries \nBeneficiaries  of  Project  1  will  be  the  400,000  people  living  near  the  roads \nincluded in Project 1. Anticipated economic benefits will include: \n(i) increased diversity of cash crops, higher production, and more \ndirect sales as a result of better access to regional markets and \ntowns; (ii) rehabilitation of abandoned coffee gardens and/or the \nestablishment of new gardens; (iii) more raising of livestock for \nsale; (iv) more sales by market vendors because of the increase \nin customers; (v) better businesses for trade store owners; and \n(vi)  more  opportunities  for  creation  and/or  expansion  of \nmicroenterprises  and  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises \n(SMEs). The greater availability, frequency, and reliability and the \nlower costs of transport services will benefit public motor vehicle \ndrivers  and  truckers  as  well  as  people  who  rely  on  them. \nAnticipated social benefits will include (i) greater accessibility to \nschools, leading to higher enrollments, fewer drop-outs and better \nacademic performance; (ii) better access to health care, leading to \nimproved  health  outcomes;  (iii)  more  access  to  government \nservices,  including  new  services  such  electricity;  (iv)  more \nopportunities  to  diversify  and  expand  agricultural  production, \nmarket  cash  crops,  livestock  and  other  products  and,  as  a \nconsequence, higher household income; (v) a reduction in dust \nand  better  health  and  living  conditions  in  roadside  villages; \nand (vi) greater opportunities to travel more easily and cheaply for \nhealth, education, social and family reasons, as well as to seek \nwork or conduct business. These benefits will reach people living \nin upstream areas and off-road communities, as well as those \nimmediately adjacent to the rehabilitated roads. \n     ", "vi \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The major risks include the following: \n \nNRA\u2019s  Effectiveness.  Although  the  NRA  board  started \nfunctioning in 2004, the NRA has remained inadequately staffed. \nA  chief  executive  officer  was  appointed  in  2007.  The  3-year \nduration  of  the  board  expired  in  2007  and  a  new  board  was \napproved on 14 May 2008. The NRA is now actively recruiting key \nstaff. Initial assistance for operational and financial management \nsystem will be provided through ongoing TA, and complemented \nby  extensive  capacity  development  under  the  Investment \nProgram. Capacity development of the NRA and improving its \neffectiveness is critical to the success of the Investment Program.  \n \nRoad Maintenance Funding. The NRA manages a road fund \nfinanced through a fuel levy based on very low rates. The NRA is \nalso authorized and plans to collect road damage charges on \nheavy vehicles. Supplemented by Government financing, these \nresources are barely adequate to maintain the HCRN. Additional \nresources  are  needed  to  expand  NRA\u2019s  maintenance \nresponsibility to maintain the entire national road network. The \nInvestment Program includes assistance to the NRA to prepare \nfresh proposals for the Government to increase road maintenance \nfunding. Political support for such proposals will be crucial.   \n \nShortage of Civil Work Contractors. Implementation of ongoing \nroad-related  works  has  been  adversely  affected  by  a  lack  of \ncapable  international  and  national  contractors.  The  problem  is \ncompounded in the Highlands region by security conditions. The \nGovernment is aware of the issues and is taking measures to \n(i)  provide  safety  to  international  contractors  through  the \nprovincial  governments,  and  (ii)  improve  licensing  and \nclassification of national contractors, and provide opportunities to \nSME  construction  industry.  It  is  expected  that  the  long-term \nmaintenance contracts will attract international contractors and \nfacilitate joint ventures with national firms.  \n \nLand Acquisition and Resettlement. Because of the prevalence \nof customary landholding in PNG, land acquisition is intricate and \nthe  process  is  long.  The  DOW  normally  seeks  approval  of \ncommunities to carry out improvement work on roads through a \nmemorandum of agreement, without formal acquisition. This has \nled to regular interruptions of work on the ongoing road projects in \nthe  Highlands  region.  However,  the  DOW  has  now  started  to \nacquire rights of way for major roads in the Highlands region. The \nInvestment Program will help the DOW to carry out field surveys \nand  prepare  land  acquisition  documents  for  all  Investment \nProgram roads to enable it to make payments and acquire rights \nof way.  \n \nSecurity. Security in the Highlands region remains an issue with ", "vii \nthe contractors working on ongoing road projects. It is important \nthat the DOW, with the support of the provincial governments, \naddresses this issue.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance for  A TA grant of $700,000 equivalent will be provided to assist the \nPreparation  of  National  DOT to prepare a successor document to the NTDP, 2006\u20132010. \nTransport  Development  The  target  is  for  the  new  NTDP,  covering  2011\u20132020,  to  be \nPlan (2011\u20132020)  endorsed as Government policy by the National Executive Council \nand  readied  for  publication  by  December  2010,  with \nimplementation to begin on 1 January 2011. Preparation of the \nnew NTDP will be based on benchmarking of the performance of \nthe current NTDP, consultations with national, provincial, and local \nagencies, links with the Government\u2019s development strategies and \nbudget  and  planning  processes,  and  consultations  with \nstakeholders  and  the  private  sector  on  transport  infrastructure \nneeds.  In  performing  these  services,  the  consultant  will  work \nclosely with development partners such as Australian Agency for \nInternational Development, the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency and the World Bank. In particular, the consultant will work \nclosely  with  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development\u2019s \nongoing Transport Sector Support Program team members. It is \nenvisaged  that  the  existing  Transport  Sector  Coordination, \nMonitoring and Implementation Committee will provide a forum to \nfacilitate harmonization of the approach and inputs to the NTDP. \n   \n \n     ", "", "144 o 00'E 144o  00'E 152o  00'E\nLorengau\nVanimo Kavieng\nPAPUA NEW GUINEA Aitape Wewak B i s m a r c k     S e a\nHIGHLANDS REGION ROAD IMPROVEMENT INVESTMENT PROGRAM 4 o 00'S PROJECT  AREA Kolopo 4 o 00'S\nMadang Buka\nWabag\nMt.

The  design  and  monitoring  framework  for  the  Investment  Program  is  in \nAppendix 1.   \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES  \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  PNG sits between Asia and the Pacific. It comprises the eastern half of the island of New \nGuinea, together with the island provinces of East and West New Britain, New Ireland, North \nSolomons (Bougainville) and Manus, and some 600 associated islands. The total land area is \nabout  460,000  square  kilometers  (km2)  of  which  only  some  7,300  km2  is  inhibited  by  a \npopulation of over 6 million. Roads provide the main means of access for most of the mainland \npopulation and road transport is by far the dominant mode of travel. For the island provinces \nand some of the mainland provinces without land connections, domestic aviation and coastal \nshipping play important roles.  \n \n3.  Economic growth in PNG is surging as high oil and mineral prices boost Government \nrevenues. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth reached 6.2% in 2007, about double the \naverage rate of recent years, and is projected to rise to 6.6% in 2008, before easing to 4.6% in \n2009. Business confidence has generally improved, assisted by some structural reform and a \nrelatively stable political environment. Revenue windfalls from the oil and minerals boom have \ngreatly improved the overall fiscal and debt position. Mining and petroleum revenue grew by \n59% in real terms in 2005, by 72% in 2006, and by 15% in 2007. The Government\u2019s total debt \n(domestic and external) has more than halved since 2002 and reached 35% of GDP by the end \nof 2007. It is projected to decline to about 27% of GDP by 2010. The ratio of external debt to \nGDP  of  18%  in  2007  is  well  below  the  30%  maximum  threshold  set  by  the  International \nMonetary Fund. By the end of 2007, savings from windfall revenue in trust accounts had \naccumulated to K2.3 billion (about 12% of GDP or $800 million), providing an opportunity to \nfund maintenance and investment of infrastructure, among other public services.  \n \n4.  The Highlands region comprises five provinces (Chimbu, Enga, Southern, Eastern, and \nWestern  Highlands)  and  is  the  country\u2019s  primary  source  of  national  income  and  export \nearnings.1 The major gold reserves are in Enga and almost all oil and gas production is in \nSouthern Highlands. The region is also known for its agricultural exports, including coffee, tea, \nand vegetables. About 40% of the PNG population lives in the Highlands region. The terrain is \nrugged, with high mountain ranges, steep valleys and fast-flowing rivers. The road network \nprovides a lifeline for exports as well as for supplies to the resource enclaves and the general \npopulation. The Highlands Highway and roads leading from it form the largest contiguous \nnetwork, linking the Highlands provinces with the main port at Lae. However, high rainfall, \nseismic activities, fragile geological conditions and a highly dispersed population make the road \nnetwork difficult to develop and sustain.   \n \n                                                 \n1  Minerals and petroleum alone accounts for nearly 80% of exports (World Bank. 2002. Country Assistance Strategy \nfor Papua New Guinea for FY2008\u2013FY2011. Sydney. [November]). ", "2 \n5.  The road network is classified into national, provincial, and district roads. National roads \nlink provincial capitals and the main population centers. The national road network is 7,600 \nkilometers (km), of which 2,600 km are sealed and the rest are gravel roads. Provincial and \ndistrict roads provide the secondary and tertiary links to the national road network. Their total \nlength is about 10,000 km, of which only about 1,000 km are sealed and the remainder are \ngravel or unpaved. The traffic volumes on the national highway network are low, except for the \nurban centers of Port Moresby and Lae. Traffic on 74% of the national road network is fewer \nthan 500 vehicles per day. Only about 40% of the national road network is considered to be in a \nmaintainable condition and the remainder requires some significant rehabilitation, restoration, or \nreconstruction to make the roads usable. Based on the Department of Works (DOW) road asset \nmanagement system (RAMS), the condition of national roads in the Highlands region is poorer \nthan the overall national road network. The annual investment in the road sector has averaged \nK500 million over the last 3 years, with a very small proportion spent on maintenance.2   \n \n6.  The  Department  of  Transport  (DOT)  is  responsible  for  national  transport  policy \nformulation, planning, safety, and regulation. The DOW is responsible for carrying out works on \nthe  national  road  network.  The  provincial  and  local  governments  are  responsible  for  the \nmaintenance and development of all provincial and district roads. The provincial offices of the \nDOW  provide  technical  advice  and  support  to  the  provincial  governments.  As  part  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to create autonomous organizations to manage transport, the National \nRoads Authority (NRA) was established in 2003 to take over the responsibility of maintaining the \nnational road network, starting with the roads in the Highlands region. In addition, a road fund \nfinanced from road user charges was created to provide a sustainable source of finance for road \nmaintenance. An independent board oversees the functions of the NRA and the use of the road \nfund.  The  11-member  board  comprises  representative  of  the  private  sector  (chamber  of \ncommerce), road users (commercial transporters), institutions (engineering and accounting) and \nthe Government (departments of transport, works, planning and treasury). To promote road \nsafety, in 1997 the Government established a National Road Safety Council (NRSC) to advise \nthe Government on road safety matters, recommend road safety actions to the appropriate \nauthorities,  conduct  educational  campaigns,  and  promote  road  safety  research.  The  14 \nmembers of NRSC include the representatives of the departments of transport and works, \nfinance and planning, health, education, provincial and local government, lands and physical \nplanning,  national  capital  district  commission,  motor  vehicles  insurance  trust,  chamber  of \ncommerce, and universities. It is funded from a 5% levy on motor vehicle insurance premiums. \nAn analysis of the road sector is in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Challenges \n \n7.  Road Maintenance. About 70% of the road network in the Highlands region is in a poor \ncondition. Although some road improvement projects financed by the Government, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB),3 and the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) \nare being implemented, roads quickly fall back into disrepair because of the lack of regular \nmaintenance. The poor condition of the network has resulted in longer journey times, higher \n                                                 \n2  Recent expenditure on maintenance is less than 5% and most of it is used for emergency works.  \n3  ADB. 1999.

Manila (Loan 1709-PNG); and ADB. 2006. \nReport and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Papua New Guinea \nfor the Road Maintenance and Upgrading (Sector) Project (Supplementary Loans). Manila (Loan 2242-PNG and \nLoan 2243-PNG).  ", "3 \nvehicle operating costs, and the isolation of rural communities. Consequently, significant income \nfrom agricultural and other exports is lost and social conditions worsen, exacerbating social \nunrest and lack of security. The reasons for the failure to maintain roads are both financial and \ninstitutional.  At  the  national  level,  the  DOW  relies  on  its  annual  budget  submission  and \nallocation to fund routine and periodic road maintenance. In practice, the DOW\u2019s budget request \nis cut back and even the agreed amount is only partly received. As a result, the network \ndeteriorates and emergency repairs take up an increasingly large proportion of the available \nfunds, undermining the DOW\u2019s ability to institute a planned maintenance program based on \nRAMS. Road improvements have relied increasingly on major rehabilitation and reconstruction \nprojects funded by the international development partners.4 The maintenance of provincial and \nlower level roads is in an equally distressed state, with low budgets leading to a reactive \napproach to repairs to keep routes open to traffic.   \n \n8.  PNG\u2019s development partners have given considerable support to road maintenance.5 \nThe Government has reflected the need for sustainable road maintenance in the National \nTransport Development Plan (NTDP), 2006\u20132010.6 This pursues four strategies: (i) assigning \nresponsibility for maintenance of national roads to the NRA, starting with the roads in the \nHighlands region, (ii) using RAMS to analyze maintenance needs for individual road sections \nand to prioritize maintenance works, (iii) raising funds directly from road users through cost \nrecovery,  and  (iv)  preventing  undue  damage  to  road  assets  by  overloading.  The  NTDP \nproposes to collect revenues from road users through a special levy on fuel and special vehicle \nregistration and license fees. The resulting revenues are to be deposited into a road fund to be \nmanaged  by  the  NRA  and  used  exclusively  on  road  maintenance.  The  successful \nimplementation of the NTDP will enable the large routine and periodic maintenance program to \nbe implemented. The initial focus will be on maintaining national roads, followed by provincial \nand district roads.  \n \n9.  Capacity. The weak capacity of the Government and the private sector is a feature of \nmost Pacific countries. While institutional reforms have been undertaken in PNG, policies and \nstrategies  outlined,  and  development  plans  prepared,  implementation  has  often  suffered \nbecause of weak capacity. There is a need to identify capacity development needs in close \nconsultation with the Government and private sector counterparts and to undertake capacity \ndevelopment  through  lending  and  nonlending  products.  AusAID  began  a  major  long-term \ninitiative7  in  2007  to  improve  capacity,  service  delivery,  and  governance  of  transport \ninfrastructure agencies, including the DOW.  \n \n10.  Network Approach. The NTDP road investment plan identifies 16 priority sections of \nnational highways for rehabilitation. The intention is that once all the key national road corridors \nhave been improved to acceptable levels, work on other national and provincial roads will be \nundertaken.  This  approach  overlooks  the  importance  of  the  secondary  and  tertiary  road \n                                                 \n4  ADB, AusAID, World Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), European Union (EU).   \n5  ADB. 1999.

Technical  Assistance  to  Papua  New  Guinea  for  Preparing  the  Road  Authority \nDevelopment Project. Manila (TA 3716-PNG); AusAID. 2002. Transport Sector Support Program. Canberra; and \nWorld Bank. 2004. Transport Sector Review Note. Sydney.  \n6 NTDP  was  initially  prepared  for  2001\u20132010.  Though  major  institutional  reforms  were  achieved  with  the \nestablishment of (i) civil aviation authority in January 2001, (ii) national maritime safety authority in February 2004, \nand (iii) national roads authority in March 2003, not much progress was made in implementation of infrastructure \ninvestments. The original plan was extensively reviewed and revised in 2005 in the form of the current NTDP \n(2006\u20132010).      \n7  Phase 1 of the AusAID\u2019s Transport Sector Support Program covering 2007\u20132012 has a budget of up to A$50 \nmillion a year. \n     ", "4 \nnetworks that feeds into the national road system. Selected provincial and district roads linking \nto rural areas in the Highlands region also need to be improved to open access to livelihood \nopportunities,  markets,  health,  and  educational services.  A  World  Bank  study8  has \ndemonstrated clear links between better roads and improvements in the human development \nindex, in particular through increased participation in education and use of health facilities.  \n \n11.  Vehicle Overloading. Vehicle overloading is one of the factors responsible for the rapid \ndeterioration of the road network, particularly in the Highlands region, because of heavily- \nloaded  vehicles  from  the  extractive  industry.  Half  of  the  damage  to  roads  is  attributed  to \noverloaded vehicles. Bailey bridges9 in the Highlands region are mostly in good condition, but \nsome on the provincial network have collapsed because of overloading. Although the DOT is \nresponsible for performing axle load tests and levying fines on defaulters, it has not taken any \naction to control overloading. The NRA is in the process of installing weighbridges and is \nseeking a delegation of power from the DOT to initiate axle load controls, starting with the \nHighlands highway. \n \n12.  Road Safety. The road accident and injury rates for PNG are estimated to be among the \nhighest in the Pacific region. Although recent data are lacking,10 the road fatality rate in 2002 \nwas 40 per 10,000 registered vehicles, four times higher than in the Fiji Islands and 40 times \nhigher  than  in  the  best  performing  countries.  The  economic  cost  of  road  accidents  was \nestimated to be over K200 million per year in 2002. The main causes of traffic accidents are \ndrunk driving, inadequate road safety awareness by drivers and pedestrians, lack of safety \nconsiderations in road design, hazardous roads, and inadequate enforcement of traffic rules. \nADB  technical  assistance11 from  1984  to  1996  was  instrumental  in  (i)  establishing  a  road \naccident reporting and analysis system within the DOT\u2019s Land Transport Department, (ii) setting \nup the NRSC, and (iii) undertaking accident black spot and remedial treatment analysis and \nstaff training. Since its establishment in 1997, NRSC has taken the lead in road safety. With \nlimited resources, it is funding small projects to educate the community in road safety, raise \nstandards of traffic enforcement, and bring stakeholders together to tackle the problems. The \nNRSC  is  seeking  to  expand  into  vehicle  safety  enforcement  and  is  in  the  process  of  re-\nestablishing a basic traffic accident database from several years of accumulated police accident \nrecords. Road safety needs to be institutionalized in national and provincial road agencies, and \nsafety audit functions need to be incorporated into design, hazard identification, and safety \nmanagement across the road network. \n \n13.  Right-of-Way. About 97% of the land in PNG is held in customary ownership by kinship \ngroups. Land is a fundamental part of people\u2019s cultural identity and is not normally sold or \nalienated. This is particularly the case in the Highlands region. Although the existing road \nnetwork is recognized by surrounding communities, improvement works provide an opportunity \nfor demands for compensation, work interruptions, and violence. This lack of security has \naffected road contracts in the Highlands region, resulting in limited numbers of bidders and \nuncompetitive  bids  for  road  improvement  works.  The  DOW  has  recently  initiated  legal \n                                                 \n8   World Bank socioeconomic impacts study under Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project, March 2007.  \n9   Removable steel bridges that are generally used for temporary access until a permanent structure is constructed.   \n10  The data were destroyed in a fire at the DOT\u2019s headquarters. \n11 ADB. 1984.

Although the acquisition of land for roads is a difficult and protracted \nprocess, it is the first step toward a sustainable road network. \n \n14.  Governance. Governance has been a focus of the Government\u2019s reform efforts since \n2000, but the task is not easy. The PNG\u2019s policy and legislative frameworks are generally \nadequate, but the Government continues to struggle with compliance and implementation. A key \nfactor is weak capacity at all levels (institutional, organizational, and individual). ADB\u2019s project \nprocurement-related audit of the ongoing road project (footnote 3) in 2005 and 2006 found no \nclear  indications  of  fraud  or  corruption,  but  it  did  identify  control  weaknesses  and  project \nimplementation concerns, including (i) deficiencies in internal project management, (ii) lapses in \nthe supervision consultant\u2019s financial management, (iii) inadequate due diligence in assessing \nthe  experience  and  capacity  of  potential  contractors,  (iv)  delays  in  administering  and \nconstructing subprojects because of administrative requirements and law and order concerns on \nwork sites; and (v) poor subproject designs and difficult contract implementation.    \n \n2.  Government\u2019s Strategy and Ongoing Efforts \n \n15.  The  NTDP  provides  a  policy  framework  and  investment  plan  for  road  sector \ndevelopment  to  achieve  the  objectives  of  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development \nStrategy (MTDS), 2005\u20132010. It prioritizes maintenance and improvement of the existing road \ninfrastructure. The investment priorities in the road sector are assigned to 16 national road \ncorridors, several of which are in the Highlands region. The NTDP stresses the importance of \ninstitutional reforms, including enabling the NRA to undertake road maintenance and the NRSC \nto promote road safety.  \n \n16.  The NTDP\u2019s overall aim is to provide safe and dependable transport services to all \nsections of the community in a cost-efficient and effective manner. Specifically, NTDP plans to \noffer (i) better transport access to education, health, and other social services, especially for \nrural communities; (ii) more access to production sites and markets at lower transport costs;  \n(iii) better opportunities for raising incomes in remote and impoverished coastal rural areas; and \n(iv) lower transport costs and safer movement of passengers and goods. This will be achieved \nby  (i)  maintaining  and  improving  the  existing  infrastructure  and  services;  (ii)  upgrading, \nrehabilitating and improving infrastructure that is economically feasible; and (iii) giving high \npriority to safety and security. Other policy initiatives include (i) new approaches to funding and \nfinance,  in  particular  the  introduction  of  road  user  cost  recovery  to  generate  the  required \nrevenue for maintenance activities; (ii) promoting stronger partnerships with the private sector; \n(iii) seeking a closer working relationship between national and provincial governments; and  \n(iv) adopting more integrated and strategic approaches to transport planning, policy formulation \nand decision making. However, implementation of the NTDP has been slow. \n \n17.  The NRA was established in 2003 and a governing board was appointed in 2004. \nHowever, its executive was not permanently staffed until the appointment of a chief executive \nofficer in 2007. The 3-year duration of the board expired in 2007 and a new board was approved \non 14 May 2008. The NRA is now recruiting key staff so that it can begin road maintenance \noperations. Development of the NRA\u2019s financial management systems will be supported by ADB \nTA (footnote 5). The road fund, financed by road user charges, has been operational since \n2006. Efforts are underway to expand other sources of finance for maintenance since, although \nthe NRSC has major plans to expand its operations, it faces a shortage of resources.      \n \n \n     ", "6 \n3.  ADB\u2019s Strategy  \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP), 2006\u2013201012 has supported implementation \nof the MTDS by tightening the focus of ADB\u2019s program to maximize its impact in priority areas. \nThe CSP builds on ADB\u2019s comparative advantage and its long-standing relationships with other \ndevelopment  partners.  The  strategic  areas  of  ADB\u2019s  engagement  are  public  financial \nmanagement, private sector development, the transport sector, and health and HIV prevention. \nThe CSP and the country operations business plan aim to continue road rehabilitation and \nmaintenance in the Highlands region and other least developed areas of PNG. This will make a \nsignificant contribution to robust and broad-based economic growth, which is central to MTDS. \n \n4.  External Assistance \n \n19.  ADB has funded six road projects in PNG since 1972 through eight loans for a total \namount of $256 million. The projects covered 10 provinces including the five provinces in the \nHighlands  region.  The  ongoing  Road  Maintenance  and  Upgrading  Project13 was  originally \nfinanced through a loan of $63 million in 1999, extended through a supplementary loan of $53 \nmillion in 2006. The project covers road improvements in the Highlands region. In addition, grant \nfinancing  has  been  provided  for  15  technical  assistance  projects  totaling  over  \n$6 million for project preparation, sector reforms, and capacity development. ADB has also \nprovided support to harmonize the efforts of the development partners in the transport sector in \nline with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and to support the Government\u2019s declared \npolicy direction through MTDS and NTDP. \n \n20.  AusAID has financed six initiatives in the road sector since 1995, totaling A$421 million. \nThe  projects  covered  maintenance  of  sealed  or  gravel  roads  and  bridges,  and  sealing  or \nresealing works on the national roads in 12 provinces. Since 2007, AusAID has been working to \nimprove transport outcomes through the Transport Sector Support Program (footnote 7), which \nfocuses  on  improving  governance  and  strengthening  capacity  to  improve  service  delivery. \nInitially, the TSSP will provide technical assistance to transport agencies under the central \ngovernment, to be extended later to the provincial governments. Under the TSSP, contracts \nhave been awarded to rehabilitate and maintain 530 km of roads in nine provinces. \n \n21.  The  World  Bank  is  funding  road  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  in  eight  provinces \nthrough a loan of $40 million in 2002 and a supplementary loan of $37 million in 2007. The \nJapan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  has  provided  grant  assistance  of  \n$23 million for the construction and upgrading of bridges in several provinces. The Japan Bank \nfor International Cooperation has provided $126 million in loans for a trans-island highway and \nnational road improvement projects. The details of external assistance are given in Appendix 3.  \n \n22.  Through an ADB-financed initiative in 2007, the activities of the development partners \nhave been harmonized and a framework prepared, supported by AusAID, JICA and the World \nBank. A Transport Sector Coordination, Monitoring and Implementation Committee (TSCMIC) \nwas subsequently established by the Government to coordinate all transport agencies and \nconsult with development partners on aid effectiveness.    \n \n \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2006.

Lessons  \n \n23.  One of the key lessons from past initiatives in the road sector is the need to ensure \nsustainable  maintenance  before  undertaking  road  development  and  improvement  projects. \nExamples of roads showing signs of deterioration within 2 years of construction because of a \nlack  of  routine  maintenance  are  quite  common  in  the  Highlands  region.  Sustainable \nmaintenance  includes  not  only  institutional  arrangements  but,  more  importantly,  a  regular \nsource  of  financing  and  delivery  mechanisms.  AusAID\u2019s  Key  Roads  for  Growth  Project14 \ndemonstrated the benefits of long-term maintenance contracts that not only ensured good road \nconditions but also provided livelihood opportunities to the roadside communities.   \n \n24.  A major barrier to development in the Pacific is the lack of capacity in the agencies \nresponsible for service delivery. PNG is no exception. Road agencies such as the DOW, NRA, \nand the NRSC need to be strengthened and this should complement the ongoing initiatives by \nother development partners, particularly AusAID\u2019s TSSP (para. 20). \n \n25.  Several lessons can be learned from the ongoing ADB projects in the Highlands region:  \n(i) project consultants should have direct responsibility for design and supervision rather than \nplaying an advisory role, (ii) contract packages need to be designed so as to attract good \ncontractors,15 and (iii) the DOW initiative to acquire rights of way of the national roads should be \nsupported. Governance-related lessons are in para. 60. \n \n6.  Rationale for ADB Support \n \n26.  The NTDP provides a framework of policies and strategies to achieve a sustainable road \nsystem in PNG. It led to the establishment of the NRA with responsibility for maintaining the \nroad  network  and  to  a  road  fund  financed  through  road  user  charges  to  finance  road \nmaintenance.  The  NRA  and  road  fund  are  managed  by  an  independent  board  with \nrepresentatives from road users, the private sector, and the Government. There is a need to \ntranslate these initiatives into a workable system by (i) strengthening the NRA\u2019s capacity to plan \nand manage road maintenance works, (ii) seeking increased financing for the road fund by \nrationalizing  road  user  charges,  and  (iii)  awarding  long-term  performance-based  road \nmaintenance contracts.  \n \n27.  The Highlands region is a major contributor to PNG\u2019s economy through its agricultural \nand mineral exports. It is also home to 40% of the country\u2019s population, who rely almost \nexclusively on the road network for movement of people and goods. The road network is \nvulnerable  because  of  the  mountainous  terrain,  the  fragile  geological  conditions,  and  the \nclimate. The Government and its development partners have invested significantly in improving \nthe road network, but a lack of regular maintenance has left it in a poor condition. Past capacity \ndevelopment  initiatives,  such  as  RAMS,  have  been  useful  in  prioritizing  maintenance \ninvestments, but its use has been limited. There is a need to (i) initiate a program of regular \nmaintenance on all HCRN roads that are in good condition, and (ii) improve those HCRN roads \nthat are in a poor condition and ensure that routine maintenance begins on these roads as soon \nas the improvement works are done. \n      \n                                                 \n14 The 3-year maintenance contracts on 356 km section of the Highlands Highway (in Morobe and Eastern Highlands \nprovinces) have resulted in a 20% savings in travel time, an 18% reduction in annual maintenance costs, and a \nsignificant improvement in the capacity of national contractors.   \n15 The DOW and NRA, in coordination with the Central Supply and Tenders Board, are planning road shows in \nregional countries to attract international contractors and respond to their concerns.   \n     ", "8 \n28.  With a functioning board and NRA staffing underway, the Government is keen to support \nthis initiative, which could serve as model for other regions of PNG.   \n \n29.  The  multitranche  financing  facility  is  the  most  suitable  modality  for  financing  the \nInvestment Program because (i) it supports the Government\u2019s long-term vision for developing \nthe sector as outlined in the NTDP, (ii) it enables ADB to sustain the long-term partnership that \nis needed to institutionalize road maintenance, (iii) it allows ADB to strengthen and improve the \nNTDP and actively to pursue policy dialogue throughout the life of the Investment Program,  \n(iv)  it  responds  to  the  long-term  capacity  development  needs  of  the  road  agencies,  (v)  it \nprovides flexibility to the Government in terms of the timing and size of the investments for each \ntranche,  (vi)  it  provides  an  opportunity  to  apply  lessons  from  early  tranches  to  guide  the \nsubsequent tranches and to include incentives for reforms and implementation efficiency, and \n(vii) it provides comfort to private companies interested in pursuing long-term opportunities in \nthe road sector.  \n \nIII.

The  proposed  Investment  Program  will  establish  a  sustainable  road  system  in  the \nHighlands region that will enable maximum use of its natural, mineral, and human resources. It \nwill contribute to the Government\u2019s MTDS, 2005\u20132010 objectives of (i) export-driven economic \ngrowth; (ii) rural development, and poverty reduction; (iii) good governance; and (iv) promotion \nof sustainable agriculture, forestry, fisheries and tourism.  \n \n31.  The  Investment  Program  will  improve  access  to  ports,  markets,  and  livelihood \nopportunities, and reduce travel time and transport costs in the Highlands region. \n \nB.  Outputs \n32.   Multitranche Financing Facility. The Investment Program focuses on the Highlands \ncore road network (HCRN)16 of 2,500 km of major national and some provincial roads. The \nHCRN  carries  the  bulk  of  the  traffic  in  the  region.  The  Investment  Program  will  include  \n(i) investment projects covering improvements to about 1,400 km of HCRN (Appendix 4) to be \nfunded through four or more tranches; (ii) consulting services for (a) preparation of investment \nprojects for ADB approval and design and supervision of civil works, and (b) preparation and \nadministration  of  long-term  road  maintenance  contracts  for  the entire  2,500 km  of  HCRN;  \n(iii)  support  for  capacity  development,  resource  mobilization  for  maintenance  funds,  and \nimproving road transport services; and (iv) monitoring the socioeconomic benefits of improved \nand maintained roads in the Highlands region. In addition, technical assistance is provided to \nsupport the DOT to prepare a new National Transport Development Plan (NTDP) for 2011\u2013\n2020. \n \n33.  Project 1. The first tranche will finance Project 1, which includes (i) improvements to  \n211 km of national roads17 that are part of the priority corridors identified in the NTDP, 2006\u2013\n2010; (ii) support to the DOW for (a) the design, preparation of bid documents, and procurement \nfor 211 km of roads, (b) preparation of investment proposals for subsequent projects and \n                                                 \n16 HCRN represents 65% of the total road network in the Highlands region. \n17 Nipa\u2013Magarima (26 km), Magarima\u2013Ambua (41 km), Hiwinda Junction\u2013Koroba (29 km), Mendi\u2013Kandep (50 km), \nand Laiagam\u2013Porgera (65 km). Roads for subsequent projects will be selected from the list in Appendix 4 using the \nselection criteria included in the same appendix. ", "9 \ntranches for ADB approval, and (c) the design, preparation of bid documents and procurement \nsupport for subsequent projects and tranches; (iii) support to the NRA for (a) preparation of bid \ndocuments and procurement support for the maintenance of 2,500 km of the HRCN, and  \n(b)  implementation  of  policies  to  improve  road  maintenance  financing  through  road  user \ncharges, road damage charges, a tax credit scheme, and other means; (iv) consulting services \nto the DOW and the NRA for the supervision of (a) road improvement contracts for 211 km of \nroads, and (b) long-term maintenance contracts for these 211 km of roads and an additional  \n360 km of roads that are already in a maintainable condition; (v) consulting services for capacity \ndevelopment and improving road transport services; and (vi) a socioeconomic monitoring study.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n  1.  Operationalization of the NRA \n \n34.  Inadequate funding of routine maintenance is a major cause of unsustainable road \nnetworks. Failure to perform regular routine maintenance results in a rapid deterioration of roads \nto the extent that major rehabilitation or reconstruction is required. This cycle of inadequate \nmaintenance leading to accelerated deterioration and rehabilitation is self-perpetuating because \nthe urgency of repairs to roads that are failing draws funds away from the routine maintenance \nthat could have prevented the problem. \n \n35.  The design of the Investment Program is therefore predicated on providing sustainable \nroutine maintenance so that the investment in rehabilitation and upgrading of the project roads \nis not dissipated through neglect. The roads will be managed by an organization whose primary \nfocus is road maintenance. Establishment of the NRA is a key institutional policy set out in the \nNDTP. Details of the NRA can be found in Appendix 5. The Investment Program will include \nassistance to the newly formed NRA to (i) enable it to take responsibility for managing HCRN, \nand  (ii)  seek  policy  reforms  to  generate  adequate  resources  for  the  road  fund  to  finance \nmaintenance. \n  \n2.  Long-Term Maintenance Contracts \n \n36.  Long-term  maintenance  contracts  will  be  an  integral  component  of  the  Investment \nProgram. For the 1,400 km of the HCRN to be improved, the civil work contractors will be \nresponsible for improving the road and maintaining it to a specified standard for the remainder \nof a 10-year contract period. The DOW will transfer responsibility for these roads to the NRA \nonce improvement works are completed. The maintenance contracts will be \u201cperformance-\nbased\u201d with fixed monthly payments that will be subject to performance standards being met, \nand will include penalties for underperformance. The roadside communities will benefit from the \nlivelihood  opportunities  offered  under  these  contracts,  particularly  in  carrying  out  routine \nmaintenance tasks such as vegetation control and culvert cleaning (para. 23).   \n \n37.  About 1,100 km of other major roads in the HCRN (Appendix 6) that are currently \nmaintainable  will  also  be  included  in  the  Investment  Program,  to  ensure  that  it  does  not \nconcentrate only on rehabilitated roads. These roads will be transferred to the NRA and placed \nunder  10-year  maintenance  contracts  that  may  initially  be  \u201coutput-based\u201d  contracts,  with \nprovision to convert them to \u201cperformance-based\u201d contracts after 2 years. A proposed work plan \nfor maintenance of roads by the NRA is in Appendix 6. These contracts may also include a \nprovision to check overloaded vehicles.  \n \n \n     ", "10 \n3.  Road User Charges \n \n38.  If the HCRN is to be sustainable, adequate resources will be needed to fund road \nmaintenance. Road user charges are proposed in the NTDP and are provided for in the National \nRoads Authority Act, which was developed through ADB-financed TA.18 The National Roads \nAuthority Act allows road maintenance funds to be generated through a fuel levy on the sale of \ndiesel19 and road damage charges on heavy vehicles. About K16 million a year has collected \nthrough the fuel levy since 2005. This amount is deposited in the road fund, which has now \nreached  about  K49  million.  The  NRA  is  currently  making  arrangements  for  road  damage \ncharges  to  be  collected  from  heavily-loaded  vehicles,  which  is  expected  to  yield  another  \nK10  million  a  year.  The  Government  supplements  NRA  resources  by  K20  million  a  year \n(Appendix 5). Consultants will help the NRA to rationalize and manage road user charges and \nto raise awareness of the need for adequate maintenance funding.20 \n \n  4.  Private Sector Participation \n \n39.  The road network in the Highlands region is heavily used by companies involved in gold, \noil and gas and other mineral extraction and production, and in coffee growing and processing. \nBetter roads and lower transport costs will benefit them greatly. With a predominantly private \nsector board, the NRA is being encouraged to operate on a commercial basis, charging its \nusers and maintaining the network on their behalf. Initial discussions about the possibility of a \npartnership between the NRA and the private sector in the Highlands region to fund road \nmaintenance  have  been  encouraging.  The  consultants  will  help  the  NRA  to  explore  this \nopportunity further and to make proposals in line with the Government\u2019s existing tax credit \nscheme.21  \n \n  5.  Policy Framework \n \n40.  The current NTDP, 2001\u20132010 provides the overall policy and strategic framework for \nroads  and  road  transport.  It  has  been  supported  by  several  initiatives  undertaken  by  the \nGovernment. Appendix 7 describes the implementation of road-related policies and how the \nInvestment Program will support them. The financing framework agreement (FFA) between the \nPNG and ADB will set out the policy framework for the proposed projects under the Investment \nProgram, which will be guided by the current NTDP (valid until 2010). The Investment Program \nwill include grant-financed technical assistance to help the Government prepare the next NTDP \nfor 2011\u20132020 (paras. 66\u201368).  \n \n  6.  Road Safety \n \n41.  Road  safety  is  a  major  issue in  PNG,  causing  significant  loss  of  life,  injuries,  and \neconomic losses. Improving roads in the Highlands region will allow higher traffic speeds but \nmay also cause an increase in traffic accidents. Road safety audit surveys and the removal of \nblack spots will be part of the engineering design, but road safety awareness needs to be raised \namong road users and roadside communities. Traffic laws need to be enforced. The NRSC is \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for Preparing the Road Authority Development Project. \nManila (TA 3716-PNG). \n19 At a rate of 4 toea per liter (100 toea = 1 kina).  \n20 The estimated annual maintenance cost for 2,500 km of HCRN is estimated to be about K62.5 million (to be \nachieved by 2018). \n21 This scheme involves investing part (0.75%) of the tax liability on infrastructure development and maintenance in \nthe area.  ", "11 \nwell placed to undertake this responsibility. Under the Investment Program, the NRSC will  \n(i) participate as a member of the Investment Program Steering Committee that will oversee \nimplementation; (ii) prepare and implement programs to improve road safety awareness in the \nHighlands region; and (iii) carry out road safety investigations, safety management systems, \ntraffic safety design and auditing, accident date reporting and traffic law enforcement. The \nInvestment Program will also support the NRSC initiative to establish accident-reporting facilities \nin the Highlands region.  \n \n  7.  Road Transport Services \n \n42.  Vehicle ownership in the Highlands region is very low. Travel is almost entirely by \ncommercial passenger and goods transport services. These services are regulated and fares \nare  set  by  the  Independent  Consumer  and  Competition  Commission.  Services  are  almost \nentirely \u201con demand\u201d with no formal timetables. This is ideal for heavily used routes, but can \nlead to chronic underprovision on low-density routes. The Investment Program will include a \nreview of the adequacy of existing passenger and freight services in the region and will make \nrecommendations for administrative or regulatory reforms as needed. \n \n  8.  Capacity Development \n \n43.  Capacity development of the NRA, the DOW, and the NRSC is essential for these \nagencies to play their roles efficiently and effectively (see also Appendix 8). The NRA needs to \nestablish capacity to implement financial management and information systems, assess road \nmaintenance  needs,  prepare  contract  packages,  administer  contracts,  address  social  and \nenvironmental issues, develop and implement road user charges, and carry out promotion and \npublic awareness. The DOW needs to strengthen its planning, design, and road development \nand  improvement  works.  The  NRSC  needs  to  strengthen  its  capacity  to  carry  out  its key \nresponsibilities under the National Road Safety Council Act, 1997. The Investment Program will \nsupport consultants who will work closely with these agencies to guide and support them. For \nthe  DOW,  these  consultants  will  be  supplemented  by  AusAID\u2019s  Transport  Sector  Support \nProgram. For the NRA and the NRSC, the consultants will support capacity development in \nspecific areas. In addition, assistance will also be provided to the DOW and the Department of \nLand  and  Physical  Planning  (DLPP)  in  carrying  out  field  surveys  and  preparation  of  land \nacquisition documentation for the HCRN to enable the DOW to acquire rights of way.  \n \n  9.  Socioeconomic Monitoring Study \n \n44.  The Project will include a benefit-tracking study to monitor the social and economic \nbenefits of improving and maintaining the roads. This will involve benchmarking and follow-up \nstudies  both  of  villages  influenced  by  the  roads  and  of  control  villages  unaffected  by  the \ndevelopment. The methodology will closely follow studies undertaken by the DOW and World \nBank since 2004 and recently undertaken by AusAID. The results of these studies show clear \nmeasurable benefits from investments in road improvement and maintenance. The scope of the \nstudy will include roads that are being upgraded and maintained under the Investment Program, \nas well as roads that have been or are being improved under other ADB-financed projects \n(footnote 3). An outline of the scope of the study is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n \n \n \n     ", "12 \n10.  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  Financed  Project  to  Enhance  the \nBenefits of Improved Roads \n   \n45.  A grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) will aim to extend the \nbenefits of the Investment Program to local communities in roadside villages adjacent to the \nInvestment Program roads in Southern Highlands and Enga provinces. The JFPR project will  \n(i) support community-based rehabilitation and maintenance of rural roads, pedestrian footpaths \nand  other  rural  infrastructure,  including  local  markets  in  roadside  villages  adjacent  to  the \nselected Investment Program roads; (ii) develop the skills of the rural community, particularly \nwomen, in road maintenance activities, agricultural extension, and micro-enterprise training;  \n(iii)  raise  community  awareness  and  encourage  behavior  changes  on  health,  sexually \ntransmitted infections, violence against women, security, and road safety; and (iv) pilot test \ninitiatives aimed at ensuring women\u2019s equal access to safe transportation services. All activities \nwill be carried out in consultation with the relevant district administrations and in line with \nrelevant provincial and/or district development plans. An outline of the proposed JFPR project is \nin Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \nD.  Investment Plan \n46.  The total Investment Program cost is estimated at $750 million equivalent. The total cost \nof Project 1, which includes taxes, duties, physical and price contingencies, interest, and other \ncharges, is estimated at $140 million equivalent.

", "13 \nE.  Financing Plan \n47.  It is proposed that ADB help finance the Investment Program through this MFF in an \namount up to the equivalent of $400 million over a 10-year implementation period. Financing will \nbe provided in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy,22primarily from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, \n \ni.e., from the Asian Development Fund (ADF), supplemented by its ordinary capital resources \n(OCR). The MFF will comprise several loans, subject to the submission of related periodic \nfinancing requests (PFR) by the Government, the execution of loan agreements, and fulfillment \nof terms and conditions and understandings set forth in the financing framework agreement \n(FFA). The OCR financing will follow the provisions of the ordinary operations loan regulations \napplicable to London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based loans, subject to modifications that \nmay be included under individual loan agreements. The financing from the Special Funds \nresources  will  follow  the  provisions  of  the  special  operations  loan  regulations,  subject  to \nmodifications that may be included under individual loan agreements. Cofinancing of about $80 \nmillion equivalent is expected from the Japan International Cooperation Agency on concessional \nterms from tranche 2 onwards. Other development partners have expressed good deal of \ninterest in cofinancing the remaining $70 million. The Government will provide counterpart \nfinancing of $200 million equivalent.   \n \n48.  The Government has submitted the first PFR for tranche 1, requesting two loans totaling \n$100.0 million equivalent from Special Funds resources (a \u201chard-term\u201d ADF loan of $28.8 million \nequivalent and a \u201csoft-term\u201d ADF loan of $71.2 million equivalent), to help finance Project 1. The \nADB loans will finance 71% of the total cost of Project 1. The ADF concessionary loans will both \nhave a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; interest under the hard-term loan \nwill be at 3.15% per annum for the life of the loan while interest under the soft-term loan will be \nat 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. Other terms and \nconditions will be set forth in the related draft loan agreements. The Government will finance the \nremainder of the total Project cost in an amount of $40 million equivalent, including local taxes \nand  duties.  The  proposed  financing  plans  for  the  Investment  Program  and  Project  1  are \nsummarized in Table 2, and details of Project 1 are in Appendix 9.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plans \n \nSource  Total ($ million)  % \nInvestment Program      \nAsian Development Bank  400.0       53 \nGovernment    200.0       27 \nOther External Financiersa  150.0       20 \n    Total  750.0     100 \nProject 1      \nAsian Development Bank (Special Funds Resources)  100.0       71 \nGovernmentb  40.0       29 \n    Total  140.0     100 \na    Expected to include the Japan Bank for International Cooperation and other cofinanciers. \nb  Includes taxes and duties. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n49.  For  the  second  and  subsequent  tranches,  the  Government  has  requested  ADB  to \nconsider providing a total of $300 million equivalent from its Asian Development Fund (ADF) \n                                                 \n22  ADB. 2008.

ADB has informed the Government that ADF allocations will be subject to (i) the \ngeneral  availability  of  ADF  resources,  (ii)  Papua  New  Guinea\u2019s  access  to  such  resources \npursuant to ADB\u2019s Graduation Policy and the requirements of the ADF donors, and (iii) the \navailability of such resources to Papua New Guinea pursuant to ADB\u2019s Policy on Performance-\nBased  Allocation  for  Asian  Development  Fund  Resources.  ADB  has  also  informed  the \nGovernment that, based on ADF availability for the Investment Program, OCR financing will be \ndetermined, so that the total available amount under the MFF will not exceed $400 million \nequivalent. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Investment Program and Project Management \n50.  The  DOW  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Investment  Program  and  the \nImplementing  Agency  for  the  road  improvement  works.  The  NRA  will  be  the  IA  for  road \nmaintenance,  including  all  road  maintenance  works  contracted  directly  by  the  NRA  or \ntransferred from the DOW. The Highlands Road Management Group (HRMG), the DOW project \nimplementation unit for the ongoing ADB loans (footnote 3), will be responsible for implementing \nroad improvement works and will be strengthened with additional staff.  The existing project \ndirector for ADB loans will also be responsible for the Investment Program. HRMG will be \nresponsible for engaging all consulting services and road improvement contracts under the \nInvestment Program. The NRA will establish a project implementation unit (PIU) consisting of \nkey  NRA  staff  and  supported  by  Investment  Program  consultants.  A  program  steering \ncommittee  (PSC)  will  oversee  the  Investment  Program  implementation,  monitor  progress, \napprove  roads  for  subsequent  projects,  and  provide  guidance  to  the  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies.  The  PSC  will  meet  at  least  quarterly  and  will  be  chaired  by  the \nsecretary of the DOW or his designee. Other members of the PSC will include the secretary of \nthe DOT or his designee; the chief executive officer of the NRA; the executive director of the \nNRSC; senior officials of the departments of national planning and monitoring, treasury, and \nfinance; the valuer general of DLPP; a representative of DEC; provincial administrators from the \nfive Highlands provinces; and representatives of the Highlands police force and the chamber of \ncommerce.  \n \n51.  ADB will finance staff, equipment, and operating expenses in the HRMG in the DOW \nand the PIU in the NRA to implement the Investment Program. ADB will finance the cost of the \nHRMG and PIU staff, as well as related office equipment and supplies. ADB financing for \nHRMG and PIU costs is justifiable because of (i) the limited capacity of the DOW and the NRA \nneeds to be complemented, and (ii) this is an integral part of ADB\u2019s support for capacity \ndevelopment. The Government has given assurance that, upon completion of the Investment \nProgram, HRMG and PIU staff will be integrated into the DOW and the NRA for future projects. \n \n2.  Preparation for Project 1 and Subsequent Projects \n \n52.  The Investment Program will follow MFF implementation procedures. For Project 1, the \nsupport consultants will assist the DOW in detailed engineering, bid documents, environment \nand  resettlement  plans,  tendering,  and  contract  awards.  All  resettlement  activities  will  be \ncompleted before civil works begin. For subsequent projects, the DOW, with the assistance of \nthe consultants, will (i) select roads based on the selection criteria (Appendix 4); (ii) prepare the \nproject  report,  including  technical,  economic,  environmental,  and  social  assessments;  and  \n(iii) prepare a PFR for each project. The project report will be prepared in accordance with the \ncriteria and procedures stated in the FFA, and other related requirements of the Government ", "15 \nand ADB. After appraising each project for technical and economic feasibility and compliance \nwith safeguard requirements, the DOW will submit to ADB, through the Department of National \nPlanning and Monitoring, a summary appraisal report in the format specified in the Investment \nProgram  administration  memorandum,  and  the  draft  PFR.  ADB  will  then  undertake  due \ndiligence in accordance with its relevant policies and procedures, and approve the DOW\u2019s \nappraisal, subject to any amendments. If required by ADB, the DOW will amend the PFR and \nsubmit it to ADB for approval on or before the due date of the PFR.  \n \n53.  For ADB to make available financing tranches under the FFA, in the reasonable opinion \nof ADB, PNG will be required to have achieved, or made sufficient progress on the performance \nmilestones provided below:  \n \n(i)  before approval of the first tranche,23 (a) staffed the NRA with a sufficient number \nand appropriate expertise, (b) provided maintenance revenues through road user \ncharges to meet maintenance needs, (c) initiated gradual transfer of maintainable \nroads from DOW to NRA, and (d) continued to provide Government budgetary \nresources to NRA to meet a shortfall in maintenance revenues;  \n \n(ii)  before approval of the second tranche, (a) completed NRA staffing to a sufficient \nnumber and expertise; (b) continued to increase road maintenance revenues \nthrough road user charges, road damage charges, a tax credit scheme, and any \nother means; (c) continued to transfer additional maintainable roads from DOW \nto NRA; (d) awarded long-term maintenance contracts; (e) continued to provide \nGovernment budgetary resources to NRA to meet any shortfall in maintenance \nrevenues; and (f) NRA to have submitted quarterly progress reports; and  \n \n(iii)  before  approval  of  the  third  and  any  subsequent  tranche:  (a)  continued  to \nincrease road maintenance revenues through road user charges, road damage \ncharges, a tax credit scheme, and any other means; (b) continued to transfer \nadditional maintainable roads from DOW to NRA; (c) awarded additional long-\nterm maintenance contracts; (d) continued to provide Government budgetary \nresources  to  NRA  to  meet  any  shortfall  in  maintenance  revenues;  and  (e) \nsubmitted quarterly progress reports from NRA.  \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n54.  The Investment Program will be implemented over a period of 10 years, with completion \nby December 2018. It is estimated that Project 1 will be completed by 2012. DOW will prepare \ndetailed implementation schedules for the subsequent projects. An indicative implementation \nschedule for the Investment Program and a detailed implementation schedule for Project 1 are \nin Appendix 10. \n \n4.  Procurement \n55.  All ADB-financed procurement for goods and services will be carried out in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  International \ncompetitive bidding procedures will be followed for all contracts over $3 million equivalent for \ncivil works and $0.5 million equivalent for goods. National competitive bidding will be used for \ncontracts under these thresholds. Shopping can be used for goods with contract values lower \nthan $100,000 equivalent, as appropriate. A procurement plan for the Investment Program is in \n                                                 \n23 The Appraisal Mission confirmed that the performance milestones for the first tranche have been satisfied. \n     ", "16 \nAppendix 11. Contracts have been packaged to attract international contractors as well as \npromote national contractors.      \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n56.  Consulting  services  will  be  required  for  implementation  support  and  capacity \ndevelopment,  and  for  socioeconomic  monitoring.  Key  tasks  include  (i)  design  of  road \nimprovement works; (ii) preparation of bid documents, procurement support, and supervision of \nroad improvement works and long-term maintenance contracts; (iii) performance monitoring;  \n(iv)  preparation  of  subsequent  projects;  (v)  capacity  development;  and  (vi)  socioeconomic \nmonitoring. The capacity development activities will focus on, among others, strengthening of \nthe DOW, NRA and NRSC in financial management, road maintenance contracting, road safety, \nand rationalizing road user charges. The consultant team will define a detailed work plan; \nestablish  a  modern  and  efficient  management  information  system;  and  cater  for  planning, \nreforms,  technical,  fiduciary  oversight,  safeguards,  and  other  matters  connected  with \nimplementation\u2014including reporting, monitoring, and evaluation. \n \n57.  Project 1 will require a total of 1,266 person-months (362 international and 904 national) \nof services from consulting firms. Outline terms of reference for the consulting services are in \nSupplementary Appendix C. Additional consulting services, if necessary, will be procured under \nsubsequent projects. The consulting services will be financed from the ADB loans. The DOW \nwill select and engage the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time) using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod. \n \n58.  The DOW has asked for advance contracting for consulting services, which has been \napproved. The Fact-finding Mission advised the DOW that ADB approval of advance contracting \ndoes not commit ADB to finance the Investment Program.   \n \n6.  Investment Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n59.  Targets and indicators for monitoring and evaluating Investment Program performance \nwere discussed with the Government and the key targets and indicators are in the design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1). The consultants for Investment Program implementation \nsupport will work with the DOW to collect data from relevant agencies, including provincial and \ndistrict  governments,  to  measure  the  performance  indicators  at  inception,  3  years  after \ncompletion of each project, and at the completion of the Investment Program. They will report \nkey  findings  to  ADB  every  quarter.  The  DOW  and  the  NRA,  with  the  assistance  of  the \nsupervision consultant, will monitor and evaluate the impacts of the Investment Program to \nensure that the completed infrastructure is managed effectively and benefits are maximized. \nADB Management will prepare periodic reports to inform the Board of overall progress. A Board \ninformation report will be submitted annually, and progress reports will be submitted to inform \nthe Board of the approval of loans for subsequent projects. \n \n7.   Governance and Anticorruption Measures \n \n60.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the projects under the Investment \nProgram.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are ", "17 \nincluded in the loan agreements and the bidding documents for the Investment Program. In \nparticular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection with  the  Investment  Program  shall \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nthe Executing Agency and implementing agencies, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the Investment Program. \n \n61.  The Investment Program will be implemented through existing institutions and using \ncountry systems as much as possible. In accordance with ADB requirements,24 a governance \nassessment was conducted during preparation of the Investment Program. This identified risks \nand  associated  mitigating  actions  and  these  were  discussed  with  the  Government \n(Supplementary Appendix D). The assessment focused on three areas\u2014financial management, \nprocurement,  and  anticorruption\u2014and  identified  significant  risks  in  each.  Governance \nsafeguards to mitigate the risk of misuse of funds and to improve governance, accountability, \nand transparency will include (i) a DOW website to provide and disclose updated and detailed \ninformation  on  project  implementation;  (ii)  timely  disclosure  of  information  on  selection  of \nconsultants and contractors through local newspapers and on the website; (iii) dissemination of \ninformation  to  the  public,  through,  for  example,  publicizing  expected  service  levels  from \nperformance-based contracts; (iv) use of ADB procurement rules and extensive use of prior \nreview; (v) independent verification of the quantity, quality and cost of works by the international \nsupervision consultant; (vi) independent accounting support to build capacity and to ensure, \namong  other  things,  timely  and  rigorous  reconciliations,  orderly  record  keeping,  and  strict \nadherence to financial management policies and internal controls; (vii) independent external \nauditing of contracts, project accounts, and financial statements; (viii) intensive supervision by \nADB and other funding agencies; and (ix) forensic audits of any alleged corruption cases. \n \n8.   Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n62.  The Executing Agency and Implementing Agencies have agreed to adhere to sound \nfinancial management requirements during implementation of the Investment Program. The \nDOW will maintain separate project records and accounts adequate to identify the (i) goods and \nservices  financed  from  loan  proceeds,  (ii)  financing  resources  received,  (iii)  expenditures \nincurred on the components of each project, and (iv) counterpart and cofinancier funds received \nand expended. The DOW will engage independent external auditors acceptable to ADB to audit \nthe consolidated project accounts annually, including of statement of expenditure transactions, \nand  counterpart  funds.  The  DOW  will  submit  to  ADB  certified  copies  of  audited  annual \nconsolidated project accounts as well as the auditor\u2019s report in English within 6 months of each \nfinancial year-end during implementation. The DOW was advised of ADB\u2019s requirement for \ntimely  submission  of  audited  annual  project  accounts  and  financial  statements,  and  the \nsuspension of disbursements of ADB loans in case of noncompliance with the requirement. \n \n63.  The DOW  will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly progress reports for individual \nprojects, which will include (i) a narrative description of progress made during the reporting \nperiod, (ii) changes in the implementation schedule, (iii) problems or difficulties encountered, \nand (iv) activities to be undertaken in the next reporting period. The DOW will prepare and \nsubmit to ADB a project completion report within 3 months of the completion of each project, \nand  an  investment  program  completion  report  after  completion  of  all  projects  under  the \nInvestment Program. \n                                                 \n24  Applicable policies and guidelines include: ADB. 2006. Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan. \nManila; and ADB. 2008. Guidelines for Implementing ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan \n(GACAP II). Manila. \n     ", "18 \n9.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n64.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). The last disbursements under the MFF will be \nmade by 30 June 2018. Direct payment procedures will generally be used for road improvement \ncivil works contracts and for consulting services contracts. HRMG will maintain separate bank \naccounts for each project. The Government will make initial payments from budget resources \nand  the  reimbursement  procedure  for  eligible  expenditures  will  apply  with  full  supporting \ndocumentation.  \n \n10.  Reviews \n \n65.  ADB will field inception missions within 3 months of approval of the loan(s) for each \nproject, and at least two review missions a year. The Government and ADB will jointly undertake \na midterm review of Project 1 within 2 years of commencement and a midterm review of the \nInvestment Program by 2013. The timing of midterm reviews of subsequent projects will be \nagreed during appraisal of each project. The midterm reviews will focus on (i) program impacts, \n(ii) implementation progress, (iii) progress on policy framework, (iv) performance of consultants \nand contractors, (v) status of compliance with undertakings in the FFA and covenants in the \nindividual loan agreements, and (vi) the need for any midcourse changes in the scope or \nschedule of the Investment Program to ensure full achievement of the impacts.       \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n66.  A technical assistance grant will be provided to assist the DOT to prepare a successor \ndocument to the existing NTDP, 2006\u20132010. The objective will be for the new NTDP, covering \n2011\u20132020,  to  be  endorsed  as  government  policy  by  the  National  Executive  Council  and \nreadied for publication by December 2010, to take effect from 1 January 2011. A consultant will \nbe engaged to support the DOT to prepare the new NTDP, based on benchmarking of the \nperformance of the current NTDP, consulting with national, provincial and local agencies, linking \nwith the Government\u2019s development strategies and its budget and planning processes, and \nconsulting with stakeholders and the private sector on the need for transport infrastructure \n(Supplementary Appendix E). In performing these services, the consultant will maintain close \ncoordination  with  the  development  partners  such  as  AusAID,  World  Bank,  and  JICA.  In \nparticular, the consultant with work closely with AusAID\u2019s TSSP team members. It is envisaged \nthat the Transport Sector Coordination, Monitoring and Implementation Committee (TSCMIC) \nwill provide a forum to harmonize the approach of and inputs to the NTDP. The Government has \nagreed that ADB will be represented on the TSCMIC.   \n \n67.  Cost and Financing. The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $875,000 equivalent. \nADB has been asked by the Government to provide $700,000 equivalent. The TA will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The  Government  will  provide \n$175,000 equivalent to finance counterpart staff, office facilities, and other expenditures. \n \n68.  Implementation Arrangements. The DOT will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The \nsecretary of the DOT will provide guidance and support to the TA consultants. TSCMIC will be \nthe steering committee and will oversee the conduct of the TA, receive periodic reports and \nbriefings  from  the  consultants,  and  provide  guidance  on  the  Government\u2019s  policy  and \ninvestment direction for inclusion in the NTDP. The TA will include the services of a team of \ninternational consultants led by a transport planner and/or economist and supported by short-", "19 \nterm specialists to assist and advise the secretary of the DOT on preparation of a new NTDP. A \ntotal of 18 person-months of international consulting services will be required.   \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits  \n69.  Although the entire 1.9 million population25 of the Highlands region will benefit from the \nInvestment Program, the immediate beneficiaries of Project 1 will be the 400,000 people living \nnear  the  roads  included  in  Project  1.  Anticipated  economic  benefits  as  a  result  of  road \nimprovement and maintenance include (i) increased diversity of cash crops, higher production, \nand  more  direct  sales  as  a  result  of  better  access  to  regional  markets  and  towns;  (ii) \nrehabilitation of abandoned coffee gardens and/or establishment of new gardens; (iii) more \nraising of livestock for sale; (iv) more sales by  market vendors because of the increase in \ncustomers;  (v)  better  business  for  trade  store  owners;  and  (vi)  more  opportunities  for  the \ncreation and/or expansion of microenterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises. The \ngreater availability, frequency, and reliability and the lower costs of transport services will benefit \nthe public motor vehicle (PMV) drivers and truckers as well as people who rely on them. \nAnticipated  social  benefits  include:  (i)  greater  accessibility  to  schools,  leading  to  higher \nenrollments, fewer drop-outs, and better academic performance; (ii) better access to health \ncare, leading to improved health outcomes; (iii) better access to government services, including \nnew services such as electricity; (iv) more opportunities to diversify and expand agricultural \nproduction,  market  cash  crops,  livestock  and  other  products,  leading  to  higher  household \nincomes and more food security; (v) less dust and better health and living conditions in roadside \nvillages; and (vi) more opportunities to travel easily and more cheaply for health, education, \nsocial and family reasons as well as for livelihood opportunities. These benefits will reach \npeople living in off-road communities, as well as those immediately adjacent to the rehabilitated \nroads.  \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n70.  An economic analysis has been prepared for the 211 km roads under Project 1 that will \nbe improved under the direction of the DOW and then transferred to the NRA for maintenance. \nIn addition, 370 km of roads that are in good condition will be maintained by the NRA. The \nanalysis follows the standard practice of comparing life-cycle road agency and user costs with \nand without the project, based on analysis with the highway development and management \nmodel (HDM-4). The analysis focuses on savings in transport costs. Value added from better \ntransport  links  resulting  in  increased  opportunities  for  agriculture  and  employment  are  not \nquantified in this analysis but are captured through benefits to generated traffic.  \n \n71.  Traffic volume on Project 1 roads exceeded 400 vehicles per day at the beginning of the \ndecade, but has fallen to as low as 160 vehicles in some sections as a result of the poor state of \nthe road network, the associated suppression of economic activity, and an increase in tribal \ntensions. Population growth and the improvement in economic condition of the Project 1 area \nsuggest there is realistic potential for a return to previous volumes. The economic analysis \nassumes the road improvements will trigger a one-off increase in traffic to midway between \ncurrent and historic volumes, followed by a 6% annual growth in traffic. The Project passes the \n12% threshold even without the increase in traffic. \n \n                                                 \n25  Based on the 2000 census. \n     ", "20 \n72.  The economic internal rate of return is estimated at 16.5% for improvement works and \n36.1% for maintenance works. The finding that the proposed road works are economically \njustifiable still holds even with a 20% increase in construction costs and 20% reduction in traffic \nlevels. A summary of the economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nC.   Financial Management and Sustainability \n \n73.  A financial management assessment was undertaken in June 2008, in accordance with \nADB  requirements.26  Among  other  things,  the  assessment  considered  the  financial \nmanagement arrangements for the Road Maintenance and Upgrading (Sector) Project (footnote \n3). The assessment rated the overall inherent risk as substantial and the overall control risk as \nhigh.27 Particular weaknesses concerned record keeping, internal controls, project accounting \nand  reporting,  and  understanding  of  and  adherence  to  financial  management  policies  and \nprocedures. In response, the financial management arrangements for the proposed Investment \nProgram will be significantly stronger than those for previous projects. Specific measures will \ninclude  capacity  building  support  and  the  provision  of  independent  accounting  support  to \nensure, among other things, timely and rigorous reconciliations, orderly record keeping, and \nstrict adherence to financial management policies and internal controls. Project 1 is not a \nrevenue-earning project and, as such, does not require financial analysis. \n \n74.  Analysis was undertaken to assess the Government\u2019s counterpart funding for Project 1 \nand its capacity to service the debt. The Government is committed to timely provision of the \nrequired counterpart funding during implementation of Project 1 and is favorably positioned to \nservice the debt from the Project. The ratio of external debt to GDP of 18% in 2007 (expected to \nfall to 11.4% by 2010) is substantially below the 30% threshold maximum level of external debt \nset by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for low-income countries such as PNG. \nIn  September  2007,  Standard  &  Poor\u2019s  upgraded  the  foreign  currency  rating  of  the  debt \nsecurities of the PNG Government to \u2018B+\u2019 and its local currency rating to \u2018BB\u2013\u2019. Although \nexternal debt is below threshold levels, PNG has been assessed by the International Monetary \nFund as at moderate risk of debt stress given its exposure to world oil and mineral prices and \nthe  ongoing  risk  of  overspending  by  the  public  sector.  The  MFF  is  expected  to  have  a \nmanageable impact on the country\u2019s debt situation. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social Impacts \n \n75.  Poverty levels are increasing. Most people have land and are able to grow sufficient food \nto meet basic household consumption needs but there are wide discrepancies in the well-being \nof different segments of society, particularly as livelihoods are increasingly linked to the cash \neconomy. According to the 1996 household survey, 37% of the population were living below a \npoverty line of $350 (K461) per year. Furthermore, 17% of the population was unable to meet \nthe basic food requirement of 2,200 calories per day per adult equivalent. Poor economic \nperformance and rapid population growth have led to a sharp increase in the incidence of \npoverty to 53.8% in 2003.  In the same period, poverty levels elsewhere in the Pacific region \ndropped from 15% in 1996 to 10% in 2003. Poverty in PNG is concentrated in rural areas, \nwhere the poverty level (41%) is significantly higher than in urban areas (16%). A poverty \nmapping exercise indicates that 5 of the 20 disadvantaged districts in PNG are in Southern \nHighlands and Enga provinces.  \n                                                 \n26  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n27  These ratings are consistent with similar assessments undertaken by development partners operating in the \ntransport sector. ", "21 \n76.  The  Investment  Program  incorporates  several  strategies  to  facilitate  the  ability  of \ncommunities and households to realize benefits from road improvements and maintenance and, \nthereby,  reduce  poverty  in  the  Highlands  region.  The  design  includes  (i)  priorities  for \nemployment of local men and women in road rehabilitation and maintenance; (ii) civil work \ncontracts to include the provision of HIV awareness and prevention programs in construction \ncamps  and  neighboring  communities;  and  (iii)  an  extensive  community  relations  and  a \nparticipation program linked to different aspects of subproject preparation and implementation. \n \n77.  During Investment Program preparation, potential gender benefits and impacts on local \ncommunities  and  vulnerable  groups  were  analyzed  through  a  stakeholder  consultation \nworkshop, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and small-sample surveys. The \nwomen who were consulted on the Project 1 roads strongly endorsed the road improvements. \nThey expected to be able to increase their agricultural production and to expand into new crops \nand animal rearing. As a result, they anticipated increasing their market sales. They felt that \nthey  would  have  faster  (and  perhaps  cheaper)  access  to  health  care  facilities.  Road \nimprovements will enable their children to go to schools and, in general, their communities will \nhave  better  access  to  government  services.  The  gender  division  of  labor  and  women\u2019s \ntraditional exclusion from the benefits derived from road rehabilitation and maintenance works \nwere  clearly  identified  during  focus  group  discussions  with  public  works  constructors.  The \nInvestment  Program  will  seek  to  give  women  more  access  to  jobs  provided  by  the  road \nimprovement by encouraging civil works contractors to increase the percentage of women \nworkers to 30% of the labor force, and to carry out gender-sensitive HIV prevention and road \nsafety awareness in the project area. \n \n78.  Papua New Guinea is characterized by a generalized HIV epidemic, with prevalence \nrates of 1.65% among the 15\u201349 year age group in rural areas. This is projected to increase to \n5.5% by 2011 if no major initiatives are taken to control spread of the infection. Key at-risk \ngroups include truck drivers, including those that work on the Highlands Highway; female sex \nworkers, particularly at PMV stops along the Highway; and men who migrate to towns and \ndevelopment enclaves for work. Wives and their new-born children are also at risk because the \nuse  of  condoms  is  not  widespread  and  there  is  a  high  degree  of  sexual  violence  within \nmarriages. The exposure of currently isolated communities to new levels of road traffic means \nthat special attention must be paid to the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In light of \nwomen\u2019s greater exposure to the risks and impacts of HIV, culturally sensitive and gender-\nresponsive awareness and behavior change initiatives need to be provided in campsites and \ncorridors of influence as part of broader health education programs. The Investment Program \nwill coordinate with existing HIV prevention projects financed by ADB and other development \npartners such as AusAID, New Zealand Agency for International Development, UNAIDS\u2014the \njoint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS\u2014and World Health Organization. A summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n  \nE.  Environmental Impacts \n79.  Project 1 has been classified as environmental category B according to the ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003),  and  it  is \nclassified  as  a  level  2  activity  under  PNG\u2019s  Environmental  Act,  2000  and  Environment \n(Prescribed  Activities)  Regulations,  2002.  Each  subsequent  project  will  be  categorized  in \naccordance with the ADB Environment Policy that is in place at the time a PFR is sent to ADB. \nAn initial environmental examination (IEE) for each road section under Project 1 has been \nundertaken to assess potential environmental impacts and recommend mitigation measures, \nmonitoring, and a reporting plan. An environment permit will be secured from the Department of \n     ", "22 \nEnvironment and Conservation (DEC) for activities indicated in the regulation. An environmental \nassessment review framework (EARF) has been prepared that presents the general anticipated \nenvironmental impacts of the investment, selection criteria, and environmental procedures for \nsubsequent projects. It will guide the preparation and approval of environmental assessments of \nfuture projects likely to be financed under the Investment Program. The summary IEE, including \nan EARF, is in Appendix 13. Climate change may lead higher rainfall, so roadside drainage will \nneed to be carefully designed. Low traffic volumes mean that vehicle emissions will be minimal.   \n   \n80.  All five roads under Project 1 include improvements within the existing road corridor. No \nroad sections are located in or pass through any protected areas or ecologically sensitive \nenvironment. The environmental impacts of roads during construction and operation have been \nassessed, and they can be mitigated to acceptable levels. The environmental mitigation and \nmonitoring set out in the IEE and the environmental management plan (EMP) will ensure that \nenvironmental impacts arising from the construction and operation of subsequent projects will \nbe kept to an acceptable level. The potential induced environmental impacts of roads have been \nassessed, particularly of those sections that connect to the sensitive environment of the forested \nKikori River Basin area in the Southern Highlands province. It was determined that the Hiwinda \nJunction\u2013Koroba road would not cause significant impacts to the Kikori River Basin.  \n \n81.  The EMP will be incorporated into the design and implementation of project roads. The \nEMP will guide the PMU, supervisory consultants, and contractors in managing, monitoring, and \nreporting environmental impact mitigations and its compliance. Civil works bidding documents \nmay only be released once the environmental assessment report of projects has been approved \nby  ADB  and  a  DEC  permit  has  been  received  for  activities  specified  by  the  Environment \n(Prescribed  Activities)  Regulations,  2002.  The  environmental  management  capacity  of  the \nHighlands Road Management Group (HRMG) and project implementation unit (PIU) will be \nfurther strengthened to ensure compliance with Government and ADB requirements. \n \nF.  Social Safeguards \n  1.  Involuntary Resettlement \n \n82.  The  Government  has  already  acquired  the  public  road  reserve  for  the  Highlands \nHighway from Lae to Mendi and plans to acquire land along all Project 1 roads. Existing roads in \nthe Highlands region are generally on customary land, the use of which has been agreed in \nconsultation with the clans and communities that jointly own the land. The additional land \nneeded for road improvement works for Project 1 is very minor; the amount will be determined \nby the detail engineering design of the roads. As formal land acquisition is a long and time-\nconsuming process, the Government will negotiate a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with \nthe affected clans and communities to allow the use of land for road improvements. In parallel, \nthe Government will begin acquisition procedures for public road reserves along the Investment \nProgram roads through a process of State alienation of customary land as per the Land Act, \n1996. Affected clans and communities will be compensated for land; individuals and households \nwith assets on the land will be compensated for any damage to or loss of these assets; and, \nthrough agreements with clans and communities, they will continue to occupy and use land in \nthe road reserves outside that required to improve the roads. \n \n83.  A resettlement framework (summarized in Appendix 14) has been reviewed by the PNG \nGovernment to establish the policies and procedures for payment of compensation for lost or \ndamaged assets. The land acquisition impacts, where they occur, will be minor. There will be no \ndisplacement of housing and the affected people will experience only small losses of crops, ", "23 \ntrees, fences or other secondary structures. The Project is categorized as B with respect to \ninvoluntary resettlement. Short resettlement plans have been prepared for Project 1 roads and \nthese will be updated based on detailed engineering designs during loan implementation.  \n \n  2.  Indigenous People \n \n84.  Papua New Guinea has over 800 different language groups. In the Highlands region, \npatriarchal societies are organized on the basis of clans belonging to different tribes; in Enga \nand the Southern Highlands provinces, the Huli, Enga, Ipili, and Angal are the principal linguistic \nand tribal groups in the areas of Project 1. Each clan has a specified territory that is owned \njointly by and supports the needs of its members; individuals and households are allocated land \nwithin the clan territory according to their needs to build a home and establish a food and cash \ncrop garden. All tribes rely on subsistence agriculture based on the cultivation of sweet potato; \ncash income is generated primarily through the sale of cash crops such as coffee, potato, and \npyrethrum. In general, no tribes or ethnic groups consider themselves to be minorities. The \nresettlement framework and plans will address specific actions favorable to indigenous peoples, \nif necessary, in dealing with the customary land acquisition. The Project is classified as B with \nrespect to the ADB indigenous people\u2019s policy. \n \nG.  Assumptions and Risks \n85.  The Investment Program includes the following assumptions and risks.  \n \n(i)  NRA\u2019s effectiveness. Although the NRA board started functioning in 2004, the \nNRA has remained inadequately staffed. A chief executive officer was appointed \nin 2007. The 3-year duration of the board expired in 2007 and a new board was \napproved on 14 May 2008. The NRA is now actively recruiting key staff. Initial \nassistance for operational and financial management system will be provided \nthrough  ongoing  TA,  and  complemented  by  extensive  capacity  development \nunder the Investment Program. Capacity development of the NRA and improving \nits effectiveness is critical to the success of the Investment Program.  \n \n(ii)  Road maintenance funding. The NRA manages a road fund financed through a \nfuel levy based on very low rates. The NRA is also authorized and plans to \ncollect road damage charges on heavy vehicles. Supplemented by Government \nfinancing, these resources are barely adequate to maintain the HCRN. Additional \nresources are needed to expand NRA\u2019s maintenance responsibility to maintain \nthe entire national road network. The Investment Program includes assistance to \nthe  NRA  to  prepare  fresh  proposals  for  the  Government  to  increase  road \nmaintenance funding. Political support for such proposals will be crucial.  \n \n(iii)  Shortage of civil work contractors. Implementation of ongoing road-related \nworks has been adversely affected by a lack of capable international and national \ncontractors. The problem is compounded in the Highlands region by security \nconditions. The Government is aware of the issues and is taking measures to  \n(i) provide safety to international contractors through the provincial governments, \nand (ii) improve licensing and classification of national contractors, and provide \nopportunities  to  SME construction  industry.  It  is  expected  that  the  long-term \nmaintenance  contracts  will  attract  international  contractors  and  facilitate  joint \nventures with national firms.  \n \n     ", "24 \n(iv)  Land acquisition and resettlement. Because of customary landholding in PNG, \nland acquisition is intricate and the process is long. The DOW normally seeks \napproval of communities to carry out improvement work on roads through a \nmemorandum of agreement but without formal acquisition. This has led to regular \ninterruptions  of  work  on  the  ongoing  road  projects  in  the  Highlands  region. \nHowever, the DOW has now started to acquire rights of way for major roads in \nthe Highlands region. The Investment Program will help the DOW to carry out \nfield surveys and prepare land acquisition documents for all Investment Program \nroads to enable it to make payments and acquire rights of way.  \n \n(v)  Security. Security in the Highlands region remains an issue with the contractors \nworking on ongoing road projects. It is important that the DOW, with the support \nof the provincial governments, addresses this issue. \n \nVI.  UNDERTAKINGS AND ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Undertakings  \n \n \n86.

Specific Assurances  \n   \n87.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government, DOW and NRA have agreed to \ngive the following assurances with respect to Project 1, and such assurances will be included in \nthe legal documents: \n \n(i)  National transport development plan. For preparation of the national transport \ndevelopment plan (2011\u20132020), the Government will ensure that the transport \nsector  coordination,  monitoring,  and  implementation  committee  facilitates \nharmonization of the approach and inputs to such plan, and that the committee \nincludes a representative from ADB. \n \n(ii)  NRA staffing. The Government will ensure that NRA is staffed to a sufficient \nnumber and with the necessary expertise to carry out its responsibilities.  \n \n(iii)  Environment. DOW and NRA will ensure that (a) Project 1 is carried out in \naccordance with the project design, and construction and operations will comply \nwith  all  applicable  Government  environmental  laws  and  ADB's  Environment \nPolicy (2002) and guidelines; (b) the EARF is applied to ensure compliance with \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy; (c) the EMPs in the IEEs are updated and made site-\nspecific,  as  required,  during  final  design;  (d)  the  environmental  mitigation \nmeasures specified in the EMPs are incorporated in the bidding documents to be \nreleased  only  after  relevant  environmental  assessment  reports  have  been \napproved  by  ADB,  and  civil  works  contractor\u2019s  specifications  include \nrequirements to comply with the environmental mitigation measures in the EMPs; \n(e) civil works contractors are closely supervised to ensure compliance; (f) the \nInvestment Program consultants undertake environmental monitoring, and reflect \n     ", "26 \nthe  results  in  the  project  progress  reports  and  project  completion  report;  \n(g) adequate support is provided to the environmental staff in HRMG and their \ncapacity is increased to enable appropriate implementation of the EARF and \nenvironmental supervision and monitoring during construction and operations;  \n(h) training is provided to the HRMG environment staff to ensure that they can \nundertake the tasks; and (i) when necessary, additional environmental staff are \nrecruited to supplement the capacity of HRMG.  \n \n(iv)  Land acquisition. The Government and DOW will ensure that, to the extent \npossible, road improvement works are undertaken within the existing right-of-\nway. In the event of any requirement for additional land, the Government will \ninform ADB and prepare and implement a resettlement plan; the resettlement \nplan  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  framework,  which \ncomplies  with  relevant  PNG  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). The Government will allocate adequate resources to \nprepare and implement the RP and supervise and monitor its implementation. \nThe Government, through DOW, will ensure that (a) national or provincial funds \nas appropriate are allocated and disbursed to pay compensation for affected \nassets, (b) land acquisition will not commence before the RP has been reviewed \nand approved by ADB, and (c) civil works will not start before the RP has been \napproved by ADB.  \n \n(v)  Labor laws. The DOW and NRA will ensure that civil works contractors comply \nwith all applicable labor laws and related international treaty obligations, and do \nnot employ child labor for any rehabilitation or maintenance activities. The DOW \nwill  ensure  that  specific  provisions  to  this  effect  are  included  in  the  bidding \ndocuments and civil works contracts, and will strictly monitor compliance. \n \n(vi)  Gender  and  development.  The  DOW  and  NRA  will  (a)  encourage  local \ncontractors to employ 30% of women in road improvement and maintenance \nworks,  (b) provide  equal  pay  to men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  type  in \naccordance with national laws and international treaty obligations, and (c) provide \nsafe working conditions for both male and female workers.

The island nature of Papua New Guinea, together with the absence of land connections \nbetween several of the mainland provinces, ensures that domestic aviation and coastal shipping \nplay an important role. The main commercial port is Lae, which is the gateway for Morobe \nProvince and the Highlands region, with Port Moresby as the second main port. The large \nSepik, Fly, and Ramu river systems provide access to the interior, and there are many small \nports  of  call  around  the  coast  and  islands  which  provide  the  means  of  access  for  some \ncommunities.  \n2.  Domestic  air  services\u2014operated  by  Air  Niugini\u2014link  Port  Moresby  and  Lae  to  the \nprovincial capitals. Charter and private general aviation services link smaller centers and remote \ninland villages where there are no external connections by road. Air links provided by missions \nto support health centers and schools formed an important part of the early development of \ntransport within Papua New Guinea, and still retain a significant role today. \n3.  Road transport is by far the dominant passenger travel mode. The Highlands Highway, \nand roads leading from it, form the largest contiguous network, linking the Highlands provinces \nwith the main port at Lae. The Highlands Highway branches west of Mount Hagen into the \nSouthern Highlands Highway and Enga Highway. It links to Madang via the Ramu Highway and \nto Popondetta (Morobe province). There are other separate smaller road networks on mainland \nPNG in Port Moresby (NCD, Central and Gulf Provinces), Alotau (Milne Bay), Wewak (East \nSepik), Vanimo (Sandaun) and in Western Province, and there are networks in the island \nprovinces radiating out from the provincial capitals. \nB.  The Road Network and Condition \n4.  The road network is classified into national, provincial, and district roads. There are \n7,600 km of national roads under central Government administration and funding, of which \n2,600  km  are  sealed  and  the  remainder  are  gravel.  Provincial  and  district  roads  are  the \nadministrative and funding responsibility of provincial governments. Their number and total \nlength has been changing as provinces create new districts and designate existing tracks as \nprovincial roads. The total length is about 10,000 km, of which only about 1,000 km are sealed. \nThe remainder are gravel or earth. \n5.  National roads provide a strategic rural network, linking provinces, provincial capitals, \nand other main population centers. National roads are categorized as (i) national routes linking \npopulation centers in two or more provinces or main roads traversing the entire length of an \nisland province acting as a collector road; (ii) national main roads linking major population \ncenters  and  districts  to  national  routes,  or  to  strategically  important  centers  (main  towns, \nharbors, and airports); (iii) national district roads within a single district linking small towns and \nvillages to centers within the district; and (iv) national institutional roads linking Government \ninstitutions  (universities,  defense  establishments,  hospitals)  to  the  national  road  network. \nProvincial roads are categorized into provincial trunk, district feeder, local access and other \nunclassified roads, including private roads and some local town roads. \n6.  Only about 40% of the national road network is considered to be in a maintainable \ncondition, i.e., the road has not deteriorated to a point beyond which funds can be applied cost- \neffectively to maintain the road to an acceptable standard of service. For the remaining 60% of \nroads, maintenance is confined to minimum emergency repairs to keep the road passable, but \n ", "32   Appendix 2 \nthese roads will deteriorate progressively until new funds become available for reconstruction or \nrehabilitation. About half the network requires some significant rehabilitation, restoration, or \nreconstruction to make the roads trafficable.   \n \n7.  About 30% of the surveyed network is in the Highlands region. Based on data from the \nDepartment of Works (DOW) road asset management system (RAMS), the condition of national \nroads is 13% good, 42% fair and 44% poor. The Highlands roads are in a poorer condition than \nnational roads in general, with none classed as good and over two thirds classed as poor. \n \nC.  Traffic Volume and Vehicle Fleet  \n \n8.  Traffic volumes on the national highway network, outside the urban centers of Port \nMoresby and Lae, are low. About 74% of the national network (by length) carries fewer than 500 \nvehicles a day and 89% fewer than 1,000 vehicles a day. There is even less traffic on provincial \nand lower-level networks. On the Highlands Highway, which is the main traffic artery for the \nregion, traffic volumes vary between 500 and 2,000 vehicles a day on rural sections, with lower \nvolumes across the mountain passes and higher volumes in the more heavily populated valley \nsections. \n \n9.  Road vehicle registration is carried out at provincial traffic registries and data reporting \nback to the National Land Transport Board is uneven. The most reliable information on the size \nand growth of the vehicle fleet comes from the number of compulsory third party insurance \npolicies taken out and recorded by the Motor Vehicles Insurance Trust (MVIT). The latest \ninformation dates from 2002 and indicates a registered vehicle fleet of 49,000. However, the \naccuracy of this figure is unknown and the total is considerably lower than an earlier figure from \nthe same source in 1999 of 60,900 vehicles. \n \nD.  Road Sector Institutions, Administration, and Funding \n \n10.  The  Department  of  Transport  (DOT)  is  responsible  for  national  transport  policy \nformulation, planning, safety and the regulation of transport operations. The NLTB implements \nthese policies in respect of driver licensing, vehicle safety and inspection, licensing of heavy \nvehicles on interprovincial routes, for-hire transport and motor-vehicle dealerships. The DOT\u2019s \nLand Transport Division (LTD) acts as the Board\u2019s secretariat. Provincial land transport boards \nregulate commercial passenger and goods transport within the provinces, although in practice \nthere is little effective control. Provincial governments are responsible for all vehicle registration \nand LTD attempts to consolidate reports at a national level but in practice the statistics are late, \nincomplete and unreliable, so the number of vehicles operating on the network is not precisely \nknown. \n \n11.  The DOW is responsible for management of road maintenance and capital works on the \nnational  road  network  and  provides  some  technical  advice  and  support  to  provincial \ngovernments. The National Roads Authority (NRA) has assumed maintenance responsibility for \nthe first section of the Highlands Highway between Lae and Nadzab, and it is intended that it will \nprogressively take on responsibility for the management of road maintenance delivery for all \nnational  roads,  starting  with  the  Highlands  region.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  and  National \nPlanning (MFNP) is responsible for physical and economic planning at national level and for \napproval of the budget requests from the line agencies. It administers some minor parts of the \nroad program directly, in particular the District Road Improvement Program. Interagency and \nprivate sector communications and consultation on land transport matters are facilitated by the \nTransport Sector Coordination, Monitoring and Implementation Committee. ", "Appendix 2    33 \n12.  Provincial governments are responsible for the maintenance and development of all \nprovincial roads. Their technical and administrative capacity to carry out this task varies and \nsome provinces rely on the provincial arms of the DOW for assistance, through formal or \ninformal agreements. In a few cases, where the DOW has been unable to fund adequate \nupkeep of national roads of importance to particular provinces, the provinces have provided \nmaintenance support. \n \n13.  The National Road Safety Council (NRSC) is a semi-independent body that coordinates \nand promotes road safety. It was set up in 1999 and is chaired by DOT, but its membership \nincludes representatives of concerned government and private agencies. It is funded from a 5% \nlevy on compulsory motor vehicle third-party insurance premiums.  \n \nE.  Road Funding and Investment \n \n14.  The present system of national road funding is in several parts: (i) the majority of funding \nis through annual budget submissions by the DOW to MFNP, appropriation of the agreed \nallocation through the national budget, and disbursement to the DOW against warrants for \nspecific items of expenditure; (ii) the NRA receives a direct operating allocation from the budget \nand can draw monies from the newly created road fund against its road maintenance program; \n(iii) provincial governments receive a budget allocation from central government and they are \nfree  to  allocate  this  against  provincial  programs,  including  provincial  roads;  (iv)  individual \ngovernment ministers receive allocations for expenditure within their electoral districts, part of \nwhich may go to provincial roads; and (v) some private companies receive tax credits in return \nfor funding maintenance of certain road sections, mainly on roads essential for access to the oil \nand gas fields and metal mining. \n \n15.  Investment in the road sector has averaged K500 million per year over the last 3 years. \nOf this, 15% has been spent on road upgrading, 56% on rehabilitation and replacement, 21% on \nmaintenance (routine, periodic, and emergency), and 6% on operations (road safety, policing) \nand  administration.  Forward  expenditure  for  2008  is  at  a  similar  level,  but  direct  central \ngovernment expenditure on the road sector is projected to reduce to K150 million a year by \n2012 as current donor-assisted programs end.  \n \nF.  Government\u2019s Strategy \n \n16.  The Government\u2019s strategy for the transport sector is designed to achieve the objectives \nof the Medium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS) and is set out in the National Transport \nDevelopment Plan (NTDP) Update, 2006\u20132010. The NTDP is in two parts, the first addresses \nsector  policy  and  institutional  development  and  the  second  the  infrastructure  investment \nprogram. The NTDP\u2019s overall aim is \u201cto provide safe and dependable transport services to all \nsections of the community in PNG in a cost-efficient and effective manner.\u201d The NTDP vision \nincludes: (i) better transport access to education, health and other rural welfare and government \nservices, and increased personal mobility, for all persons in the community at all times; (ii) better \ntransport  access  to  production  sites  and  markets,  at  lower  transport  cost;  (iii)  enhanced \nopportunities for raising income levels in remote and impoverished coastal rural areas; and  \n(iv) lower transport costs and safer cargo and passenger movements. \n \n17.  To achieve this aim in the road sector, the strategy will (i) maintain and improve the \nexisting infrastructure and services; (ii) upgrade, rehabilitate and carry out new construction \nworks only where economically feasible; and (iii) conduct business on \"safety and security first\" \nbasis. NTDP proposes to raise funds directly from road users and to deposit revenues into a \n ", "34   Appendix 2 \nroad fund to be managed by the NRA. The NRA will assume all road maintenance functions \ncurrently undertaken by the DOW. Initially, the authority will concentrate on maintenance of \nroads in the Highlands region and this will be followed by other national highways, depending on \ntheir priority. \n \n18.  Other policy initiatives include (i) new approaches to funding and finance, in particular \nthe introduction of road user cost recovery to generate revenues for maintenance; (ii) promoting \nstronger  partnerships  with  private  sector  companies;  (iii)  seeking  closer  working  relations \nbetween national and provincial governments; and (iv) adopting more integrated and strategic \napproaches to transport planning, policy formulation, and decision-making processes. \n \n19.  The road investment plan identified 16 priority sections of the national highway for \nrehabilitation over the plan period. Once all the national highways are brought to acceptable \nlevels, it is anticipated that the NRA will focus attention on provincial roads. The NRA is \nintended to be self-sustaining, capable of generating income through various revenue measures \nto fund its operations and to carry out its designated functions and responsibilities. The priority \nroads include about 900 km in the Highlands region: the Highlands Highway, including the \nSouthern Highlands and Enga Highways; Baiyer River Road; Koroba-Mendi Road; and the \nPorgera-Togoba  Road.  The  Government  also  has  a  district  road  improvement  program \nadministered by the Department of National Planning intended to fulfill a community service \nobligation for roads that do not justify development on strict economic criteria. \n \nG.  Road Transport Regulation \n \n20.  Public passenger transport is provided by passenger motor vehicles (PMVs), mainly \nvans and small buses of 12 to 30 seats, operated on a route licensing system. In 2004, from \ninsurance records, there were about 5,300 registered PMVs in the country, of which some 1,300 \nwere in NCD, 1,000 in Lae, and 2,000 in the Highlands. There were about 1,100 taxis, almost all \nin Port Moresby.  \n \n21.  The largest urban PMV network is in Port Moresby, which has a planned route structure, \nalthough  this  has  not  been  reviewed  for  some  years.  Regulatory  enforcement  is  weak, \ndeviations from routes and service schedules are common, and some of the 24 routes are no \nlonger operating.  \n \n22.  Passenger fares are regulated and fares are increased on receipt of submissions from \nthe operators and after taking account of cost increases indicated by a PMV and taxi cost model \noperated by the NLTB. Regulation of fares is undertaken by the Independent Consumer and \nCompetition Commission (ICCC), which recently undertook a comprehensive review of PMV \nand taxi costs and fare structures and set a new fare determination and review process for the \nnext 5 years.1  \n \n23.  Market entry and inter-provincial routes served are regulated for \u201chire-or-reward\u201d goods \ntransport, with a focus on the Highlands Highway. Tariffs are lodged annually with the DOT or \nits appointed agent and a minimum 60-day notice of intended increases is required, with public \nrights  of  objection  and  official  determination.  Government  policy  is  to  replace  the  existing \nquantity-licensing system with a quality-based licensing system.  This would require operators to \nshow  that  they  have  appropriate  managerial  expertise,  business  experience,  and  financial \nbacking before they are granted an operating license. \n                                                 \n1 ICCC. 2007. PMV and Taxi Fare Review, Final Report. Port Moresby. ", "Appendix 2    35 \n24.  Overloading of goods vehicles is one of the factors blamed for the rapid deterioration of \nHighlands  roads,  and  for  the  network  in  general.  An  axle  load  survey  found  that  15%  of \ncommercial  vehicles  on  the  Highlands  Highway  in  Morobe  province  were  overloaded \ncontributing  to  significant  damages  to  the  roads.  The  maximum  recorded  vehicle  weight \nexceeded the maximum allowable vehicle weight of 42 tons by 10 tons (24%). \n  \n25.  Many of the bridges in the Highlands are Bailey bridges, and while most appear to be in \ngood  condition,  some  are  cause  for  concern  at  higher  loads.  Bridge  failures  caused  by \noversized loads have occurred on the provincial network. One reason for the failure to enforce \nload limits arises from the division of responsibility between agencies. The power for performing \naxle load testing rests with the DOT. However, the NRA is seeking to have the legislation \nchanged to improve effectiveness and is in the process of installing a weighbridge on the \nHighlands Highway near Lae. Further weighbridges at Goroka and between Mount Hagen and \nTogoba (the junction between the Enga and Southern Highlands Highways) have also been \nproposed. \n \nH.  Road Safety \n \n26.  While there is a complete absence of up-to-date statistical data, the road crash and \ninjury rates for Papua New Guinea are estimated to be one of the highest in the Pacific region, if \nnot the highest. Data from 2002 indicate a road fatality rate of 40 per 10,000 registered vehicles, \nfour  times  higher  than  for  the  Fiji  Islands  and  40  times  higher  than  the  best  performing \ncountries.  The  main  causes  of  traffic  accidents  are  drunk  driving,  inadequate  road  safety \nawareness by drivers and pedestrians, an absence of uniform traffic engineering standards, \nhazardous roads, and inadequate enforcement of traffic rules. \n \n27.  ADB provided technical assistance (TA)2 from 1984 to 1996. The TA established a road \naccident reporting and analysis system within the LTD, was instrumental in setting up NRSC, \nand undertook accident black spot and remedial treatment analysis and staff training. While the \nNRSC continues to operate and has recently been revitalized under new management, the \ncomputer system for accident data analysis was lost in a fire that destroyed DOT\u2019s headquarters \noffice in the late 1990s. Since then, the NRSC has effectively taken over the lead role in road \nsafety from the LTD. It funds small projects to educate the community in road safety, raise \nstandards of traffic enforcement and bring stakeholders together to tackle the issues. It plans to \nexpand into vehicle safety enforcement and to reestablish a basic traffic accident database from \nseveral years of accumulated police accident records. Road safety has yet to be fully instituted \nacross the road sector agencies; in particular, the DOW has not introduced an effective safety \naudit function into its design procedures, and no agency is carrying out hazard identification and \nsafety management across the road network. \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1984.

Introduction \n1.  With support from its development partners, the Government determined in November \n2002 to establish a National Roads Authority (NRA) as a noncommercial statutory authority to \nassume responsibility for financing, managing and delivering road maintenance services.  \n \nB.  Functions and Responsibilities \n2.  The  Government\u2019s  decision  to  establish  the  NRA1 led  quickly  to  the  drafting  and \nenactment by Parliament of a National Roads Authority Act in May 2003, which was gazetted in \nApril 2004.2 \n \n3.  The  objectives  of  the  NRA  as  recorded  in  the  act3 are  (i)  to  raise  funds  for  the \nmaintenance of public roads; (ii) to ensure the efficient preparation of effective and annual road \nmaintenance  programmes;  and  (iii)  to  ensure  that  all  routine,  periodic  and  emergency \nmaintenance of roads is executed by the NRA in a transparent, effective, and efficient manner. \nThe  purpose  is  to  optimize  the  contribution  of  road  assets  to  the  economic  and  social \ndevelopment of PNG. \n \n4.  Implementation of this statement of objectives requires the NRA to be responsible for  \n(i) collecting funds for road maintenance, (ii) planning and programming priority needs for road \nmaintenance,  (iii)  procuring  and  administering  contracts  for  road  maintenance  works,  \n(iv)  monitoring  and  inspecting  the  executed  works  to  ensure  their  compliance  with  quality \nstandards, and (v) detailed reporting of activities and outcomes to Parliament.  \n \nC.  Background to Establishment of the NRA \n5.  The  Government\u2019s  decision  to  create  a  new  and  specialist  road  maintenance \norganization  was  supported  within  government  and  among  user  groups.  The  idea  of \nestablishing a road authority and/or road fund has been considered by a number of studies.4  \n \n6.  The  need  for  change  was  also  reflected  in  the  Government\u2019s  National  Transport \nDevelopment Plan, 2001\u20132010 and its revision covering 2006\u20132010, both of which called for the \nrestructuring of road maintenance organizations and for the introduction of a cost-recovery \nsystem based on road user charges. \n \nD.  Establishment and Corporate Development of the NRA \n7.  To meet its objectives and responsibilities, the NRA was established as an organization \nwith the following characteristics:  \n \n                                                 \n1 National Executive Council (NEC) Decision No NG 65 of 2002. \n2 Permitting an NRA Board to be appointed. The delay between enactment in 2003 and gazetting in 2004 was due to \nsome delays in nominating which ministers were to supervise the NRA. \n3 National Roads Authority Act, Section 5. \n4 These included: (i) UNDP. 1995.

", "Appendix 5    41 \n(i)  an autonomous statutory road authority, to be directed by a board dominated by \nthe private sector, and managed by a professional staff selected through merit-\nbased and competitive engagement processes; \n(ii)  adopting businesslike management practices and transparent financial reporting \nsystems, based on structured business plans open to public accountability; \n(iii)  endowed with a road fund, and an independent bank account, financed from user \ncharges, controlled by the board, and used exclusively on the procurement of \nroad maintenance services from contractors and consultants; \n(iv)  programming the use of its revenues through the application of a transparent \nroad  maintenance  database  and  maintenance  management  system  that  will \nprovide objective guidance on priorities for routine and periodic maintenance on \nthe network, based on economic and technical criteria; and \n(v)  employing professional staff with competencies in contract administration and \nmanagement  that  are  embedded  into  the  organization  structure\u2014to  permit \ntransparent,  competitive,  and  least-cost  contract  awards,  and  the  close \nmonitoring, inspection and certification of works to contracted specifications and \nstandards. \n \n1.  Supervision and Management of the NRA \n8.  The size and composition of the NRA board is specified in the National Roads Authority \nAct. The board has seven representatives of road users and private sector bodies, together with \nfour government members (secretaries of treasury, planning, transport and works). The chair is \nselected by the board from its private sector members. Nominations for the initial board were \napproved by the National Executive Council (NEC) in May 2004. A second board was appointed \nin May 2008, and it is supervising the NRA as it embarks on its road maintenance activities. \n \n9.  Through a competitive process, the NEC selected and appointed a chief executive \nofficer (CEO) for the Authority in February 2007, and other senior management staff in 2008.  \n \n10.  As at September 2008, the NRA had appointed 13 managers and support staff, with \nexpertise in contract management and maintenance supervision, maintenance planning and \nprogramming, financial management, and personnel administration. Three other positions are \nbeing filled, and approval for 14 additional positions is expected soon. These positions will \nprovide further resources for maintenance management and engineering and for road fund \nmanagement.  \n \n2.  Maintenance Planning and Delivery \n11.  To determine its annual maintenance works program, the NRA will use the objective, \nneeds-based system for road maintenance planning used in the DOW since 1999\u2014the road \nasset  management  system  (RAMS).  The  system  is  being  used  to  provide  verifiable  and \nprioritized road maintenance programs, allocate available funds to credible and optimized road \nmaintenance works, determine annual road maintenance budget requirements and the level of \nroad user charges, and to support the transparent monitoring of delivered maintenance works \nagainst agreed performance indicators. Using RAMS, the cost-recovery revenues coming into \nthe NRA\u2019s road fund will be allocated to critical road sections, i.e., those where maintenance \ncan have the greatest impact by reducing vehicle operating costs.  \n \n12.  To complement its maintenance planning, the NRA will also be responsible for managing \nthe  delivery  of  road  maintenance  services  outsourced  to  private  contractors.  To  control \n ", "42  Appendix 5 \nstandards  of  contractor  performance  and  contract  delivery,  the  NRA  will  mostly  use \nperformance-based contracts. These will require the selected contractors to take responsibility \nfor maintaining road sections to specified standards and for a specified number of years. \n \n3.  Maintenance Financing \n13.  It is intended that funds for NRA road maintenance programs will ultimately come wholly \nfrom road user charges. The National Roads Authority Act permits the NRA to establish and \noperate a road fund to be funded primarily from road user charges. The road fund will be used \nprimarily  to  pay  for  the  contracting  of  road  maintenance  services  and,  ultimately,  the \nadministration expenses of the NRA. The road user charges will comprise:   \n \n(i)   a road use charge, which will be a levy or surcharge on gasoline and diesel \nintended to cover the costs associated with the general use of roads; and  \n(ii)  a road damage charge, which will be a heavy vehicle charge, based on the laden \naxle weight of vehicles, intended to cover costs attributable to different vehicles, \ndepending on their size and weight.  \n \n14.  The principal reasons for establishing such a road fund are: (i) to secure a more reliable \nand sustainable level of funding for road maintenance than has been available from government \nbudgetary allocations, which have been subject to funding shortfalls and annual variations; (ii) to \nprotect funds raised from road user charges against raids on those funds for use on other \npurposes; (iii) to establish a close fee-for-service link between the charges paid by users and \nthe road maintenance service received by users; (iv) to provide a lever to secure more efficient, \ncost-effective  and  customer-responsive  road  sector  management;  and  (v)  to  allow  users \nthemselves to have a greater say in how road maintenance funds are managed. A properly \nestablished and operating road fund is considered a prerequisite to the successful operation of \nthe NRA.  \n \n15.  When fully operational, the amounts levied by the road use charge and the road damage \ncharge will vary. They will be influenced by such factors as the volume of road maintenance \nworks to be undertaken in the coming year, changes in road maintenance unit costs, fuel \nconsumption levels (which can be expected to increase as vehicle usage increases, along with \na growing domestic economy), the volatility of international oil prices, the national economy, and \nsimilar considerations. \n \n16.  As at September 2008, this cost recovery system had been only partially implemented. \nAn NEC decision in July 2005 permitted the NRA to collect revenue from: (i) a road use charge \non fuel, represented by an increase of 4 toea5 a litre on diesel; (ii) a road damage charge on \nvehicles with a gross vehicle weight exceeding 4 tons; and (iii) tax credits granted by the \ngovernment to resource companies. The road use charge currently generates about K16 million \na year for the NRA\u2019s road fund. The accumulated amount in the fund from this source is \nexpected to reach almost K50 million by the end of 2008. Application of the road damage \ncharge currently is being worked out, and discussions on using funds from tax credits are just \nbeginning. \n \n17.  To support the NRA in its establishment phase, the Government has been providing it \nwith two types of financing: (i) since 2005, it has funded its administration costs from annual \nrecurrent budgets, and this is expected to continue until the road use charge can cover these \n                                                 \n5 100 toea = 1 kina. ", "Appendix 5    43 \ncosts; (ii) in 2007 and 2008, the government allocated K20 million a year for the NRA from the \ndevelopment budget for its maintenance and other project expenditures,6 and this is expected to \ncontinue whenever there are shortfalls in funding from road user charges.  \n \n4.  Financial Management and Control and Reporting on Performance \n18.  To facilitate the effective management of the NRA and its use of funds, suitable financial \nmanagement, management information, and internal audit systems are being put in place. \nThese  will  cover  budgeting  for  maintenance  and  administrative  expenditures,  receipt  of \nrevenues from road user charges and other sources, depositing and accounting for these in the \nNRA bank account, expenditure planning, cash flow forecasting, financial accounting, and the \nrecording of actual expenditure on contracts. These will enable NRA managers to monitor \ndetails by contract, type of contract, road sections, and type of maintenance work, among \nothers. Standard accounting and auditing procedures, appropriate for a statutory authority, and \nconsistent with the NRA\u2019s obligations under the Public Finances (Management) Act, 1995 will \nbe developed.  \n \n19.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Government of Papua New Guinea (PNG) has adopted the Medium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS), \n2005\u20132010 as its strategic framework to promote national development. The overarching goal of the MTDS is \nexport-driven economic growth, rural development and poverty reduction, including through good governance \nand the promotion of sustainable agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and tourism. The strategy will be realized by \nempowering Papua New Guineans, especially those in rural areas, to mobilize their own resources for higher \nliving standards. The key priorities for the period to 2010 are (i) rehabilitation and maintenance of transport \ninfrastructure, (ii) promotion of income-earning opportunities, (iii) basic education and adult education, (iv) \nprimary health care and HIV prevention, and (v) law and justice. In the transport sector, rehabilitation of the \nHighlands Highway is one of the Government\u2019s top priorities. \nThe purpose of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) country strategy and program in PNG, 2006\u22122010, is to \nhelp the Government meet its MTDS goals. ADB and the Government have agreed that the strategic areas that \nclearly satisfy the principles and lessons are: (i) public financial management, (ii) private sector development, (iii) \nthe transport sector, and (iv) health and HIV. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nIn rural PNG, most people have land: in the Highlands region, an extended family or sub-clan may have up to 3\u2013\n5 hectares of productive land divided into 10 or more small gardens that are used to cultivate a range of food and \ncash crops. Households are generally able to grow food to meet basic household consumption needs; of the \nhouseholds surveyed for the Highlands Region Road Improvement Investment Program, more than 70% had \nsufficient food in their gardens for 3 months or more. A small household coffee garden may generate K500 from \nannual sales. Rural people also have extensive family and clan networks to assist them in times of need. \nNonetheless, and particularly as people\u2019s livelihoods are increasingly linked to a cash economy, there are wide \ndiscrepancies in the well-being of different segments of society. In addition to low incomes, a 2001 participatory \npoverty assessment (funded by ADB) clearly indicated the non-income dimensions of poverty: specifically, people \nconsidered they were poor when they lacked (i) jobs, (ii) land, (iii) education, (iv) services such as health and \nwater, and (v) transport and roads. The most pressing needs were safe drinking water and usable roads. While \navailable data are limited and need to be updated, the risks of rapidly rising poverty levels in PNG are clear. \nSalient issues include the following.  \n(i)  In 1997, 37% of the population lived below a poverty line of $350 (K461) per year. A further 17% of \npopulation was unable to meet the basic adult food requirement of 2,200 calories per day. In terms of the \ninternational poverty line, one-quarter of people in PNG lived on less than $1/day; 54% lived on less than \n$2/day. \n(ii)  Poor economic performance and rapid population growth have led to a sharp increase in the incidence of \npoverty, from 37.5% in 1996 to 53.8% in 2003. It is estimated that 40% of the PNG population lived on less \nthan $1/day in 2003, while 70% were below the level of $2/day. \n(iii) Poverty is concentrated in rural areas. The rural poverty rate (41%) is significantly higher than the urban rate \n(16%). The Highlands region, which contains 40% of the national population and has a poverty rate (1996) of \n38.3%, is one of the poorest regions in the country. \n(iv) Five of the 20 most disadvantaged districts are located in Enga and Southern Highlands provinces, the \nprovinces targeted by the first tranche of the Investment Program. \n(v)  The highest poverty levels occur among households with little or no cash income, i.e., families that rely \nprimarily on subsistence agriculture, hunting, gathering and fishing to meet household consumption needs.  \n ", "58  Appendix 12 \n \n \n(vi) However, farmers that grow and sell trees and other cash crops also have high poverty levels. Overall, \npeople involved in the agriculture sector account for 86% of the poor. \nHouseholds headed by women are among the poorest in rural areas of PNG. \n \n2. Design Features \n \nThe Investment Program incorporates several strategies to facilitate the ability of communities and households to \nrealize benefits from road improvements and maintenance and, thereby, to reduce poverty in the Highlands \nregion. The Investment Program design includes (i) priorities for employment of local men and women for road \nrehabilitation and maintenance, (ii) contractor specifications for provision of HIV awareness and prevention \nprograms in construction camps and neighboring communities, and (iii) an extensive community relations and \nparticipation program linked to different aspects of subproject preparation and implementation. The Investment \nProgram includes a community empowerment project to be funded by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction \n(JFPR), which will (i) incorporate a participatory approach into the preparation and implementation of the \nProgram, (ii) assist communities to initiate strategies to strengthen the social and economic benefits of road \nimprovements, and (iii) promote equitable benefits for all gender and social groups.   \n \nThe community empowerment project will include components aimed at: (i) supporting the rehabilitation and \nmaintenance  of  social  infrastructure  in  roadside  villages  adjacent  to  the  Investment  Program  roads; \n(ii) developing skills of rural women through agricultural extension, alternative livelihood and micro-enterprise \ntraining; (iii) raising community awareness and gender-responsive behavior changes on health (with an emphasis \non sexually transmitted infections [STI] and HIV), violence against women and road safety; (iv) pilot-testing \ninitiatives aimed at ensuring women\u2019s equal access to safe transportation services. All activities will be carried out \nin consultation with relevant district administration and in line with relevant provincial and/or district development \nplans. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Findings of Social Analysis \nThe primary beneficiaries of the Investment Program are the approximately 2 million people who live and work in \nthe Highlands region. They include the following groups of road users: (i) households living in communities along \nand in the vicinity of the rehabilitated and maintained roads, who grow and sell a range of food and cash crops; \n(ii) drivers of public motor vehicles (PMVs) that provide a range of passenger and goods transport services, and \ncommercial truck drivers; and (iii) businesses in the Highlands region including vendors at local, informal \nmarkets, trade store owners, coffee and other buyers and small and medium-sized enterprises in provincial and \ndistrict  towns.  National,  provincial  and  local  authorities  also  benefit  from  and  are  instrumental  for  the \nimplementation of road improvements and, particularly, the ongoing maintenance of roads. \nProject 1 includes 220 km of roads to be upgraded. The 2010 population in the road influence zonea of Project 1 \nroads is estimated at 400,000 (projected to reach 900,000 by 2025). About 225,000 people live west of Project 1 \nroads in Southern Highlands province (projected to double by 2025). The principal linguistic and tribal groups \ninclude the Huli and Duna in western SHP; people belonging to Angal and other Mendi-speaking groups in \ncentral Southern Highlands province; and, Enga-speakers and Ipili in Enga province. All these tribal groups have \n(i) clan-based, patriarchal social structures; (ii) complex systems of social and other exchanges (wantok); (iii) \nstrong  attachment  to  land  owned  collectively;  (iv)  community  leaders  who  are  chosen  on  the  basis  of \nachievements rather than heredity; (v) a highly developed system of dispute resolution that is based on notions of \nreparations and payback that often leads to tribal conflicts and fighting; and (vi) a rigid duality of gender whereby \nwomen are subordinate to men. \nThroughout the Highlands, people live on their clan territory, in dispersed homesteads or small hamlets of 4\u201310 \nclosely related households. An extended family of 10\u201315 adults and their children will generally have at least 2\u20133 \nhectares and, up to 5 hectares of agricultural land. Since the upgrading of portions of the Highlands Highway and \nfeeder roads, slightly larger villages have been established adjacent to the roads. Household size in these \nvillages tends to be larger (9\u201318 persons). Men outnumber women and nearly all households are headed by \nmen. The level of social development is low throughout the Highlands region. Adult literacy ranges from about \n10% to 40%; rates for women are significantly lower than for men. The proportion of school-age children \nattending school is estimated at less than 50%. Health indicators are generally low throughout PNG, particularly \nin rural areas. HIV has reached general epidemic proportions in PNG, with 87% of HIV positive people living in \n ", "Appendix 12  59 \n \nrural areas. The rural HIV prevalence rate of 1.65% is projected to increase to 5.5% by 2011. \nPeople living in the Highlands walk to most destinations. Every day, women walk up to several hours to reach \ntheir gardens; daily or several times a week, they walk similar distances to sell at local markets. They are often \ncarrying heavy loads as well as children. Children walk up to 4 hours per day to go to school, and health centers \nare often several hours\u2019 walk from a village. The use of PMVs and other transport is generally limited to longer \ntrips; e.g., men going to district or provincial towns, secondary students going to towns to attend school and men \nand women who are traveling to visit family. Market vendors do not use transport to reach regional markets \nbecause the costs often exceed the anticipated revenues; in addition, many PMV drivers will not carry goods. \nWomen use PMV services much less than men, in part because of their concerns about being robbed and/or \nassaulted when they travel. \nLivelihoods in the Highlands region combine subsistence agriculture (sweet potatoes), cash cropping (coffee \nand\u2014at higher altitudes\u2014Irish potato and pyrethrum) and raising livestock (pigs and chicken). The agricultural \ninputs are limited and the yields low. Some men operate \u201cwalkabout\u201d sawmills and harvest bamboo to make mats \nused as house walls. Marketing of surplus food crops, cash crops and livestock is done by women, selling to \nbuyers or through direct sales at local markets located at villages and PMV stops along the roads. Access to \nregional markets or factories is limited. Local market sales also include cooked food for travelers, handicrafts \n(bags and hats) and the resale of betel nuts and cigarettes that have been transported from coastal areas. Wage \nemployment is limited to a small number of teachers or aid post orderlies in local communities or to towns, where \nmore people obtain paid work in small businesses. The rate of job-related migration is high. Urban unemployment \nrates are very high (e.g., 38% for men) and many men in rural villages are without work. \nHousehold incomes from sales of agricultural products or other local market sales are generally very small. \nHouseholds in communities along Project 1 roads may earn up to K500 a year from sales of coffee; and, up to \nK1,000 a year from the sale of small livestock. The average daily revenues of surveyed market vendors ranged \nfrom K24 to K50. In surveys along Project 1 roads, households were asked several questions about their level of \nwell-being: 45% of households eat meat or fish once a month or not at all; 35%, once a week or less; and, 20% \nmore often. About 70% of households have food stocks in their gardens to last 3 months or longer. Asked to \nassess their situation, just over 50% say they have just enough to meet household needs; about 35% say they \nare poor because they do not have enough to meet needs; and, 15% consider themselves to be well-off.\n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nAn extensive program of consultations, women\u2019s focus groups and surveys took place during preparation of the \nInvestment Program. At the inception stage, a stakeholder analysis was carried out to identify the primary and \nsecondary stakeholders; their interests in the proposed project, their perceptions of current problems related to \nroad accessibility, mobility and transport services and, the resources they could bring to the achievement of the \ngoals and objectives of the project. Meetings have been held at the national level with the DOW, Ministry of \nTransport (MOT), National Roads Authority (NRA), Department of National Planning and Monitoring (DNPM), \nDepartment of Land and Physical Planning (DLPP), Department of Community Development (DCD), National \nAids Council (NAC) and National Council of Women (NCW); relevant development partners and international \norganizations such as the Australian Aid for International Development (AusAID), the World Health Organization \n(WHO), other UN agencies, Population Services International (PSI), CARE, OXFAM and Save the Children; and \nconsultants engaged in ADB, AusAID and other donor-funded projects relevant to the Program. Other regional \nstakeholders met include civil work contractors, trucking companies and representatives of major development \nenclaves in the Highlands region, e.g., Porgera JV and Oil Search. \nConsultations were held with provincial and district authorities in Enga (Wabag) and Southern Highlands province \n(Mendi and Tari), with participation from provincial and district administrators; national and provincial works \ndepartments;  provincial  community  development,  health  and  education  advisors;  provincial  AIDS  Councils; \nprovincial  and  district  women's  networks;  and  other  local  stakeholders,  including  representatives  of  the \ncommunity sector (e.g., local nongovernment organizations [NGOs], health institutions, and radio stations), and \nthe private sector (e.g., local businesses and bus or truck drivers). Along Project 1 roads, the views of the local \npopulation have been sought through small-sample surveys of households (210 households), market sellers (80 \npersons), trade store owners (60 persons), PMV drivers (100 persons) and passengers (125 persons), as well a \nprogram of consultations in 18 communities  that brought  together  up  to 300  people  in each community and, in \n \n ", "60  Appendix 12 \n \n \neight villages, women\u2019s focus groups (15\u201320 women each). \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and \nmonitoring?  \n Information sharing    Consultation    Collaborative decision making    Empowerment \n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes    No  \n \nThe Highlands Road Management Group (HRMG), the implementing agency for the Investment Program, will \nengage  community  relations  officers.  In  collaboration  with  HRMG  environmental  officer(s),  the  community \nrelations  officers  will  establish  a  consultation  program  for  each  subproject.  The  purpose  is  (i)  to  inform \ncommunities about the Investment Program and, in detail, about the subproject works to rehabilitate and maintain \nthe road; (ii) to provide information about the expected benefits and potential adverse impacts, as well as project \nmeasures such as compensation, environmental management, and community-based initiatives; (iii) to provide a \nforum for communities to participate in the project and express their interests, preferences and concerns about \nthe subproject; and, in general, (iv) to facilitate different aspects of the implementation of the subproject. \nConsultations  with  communities  will  take  place  at  different  points  in  the  planning  and  implementation  of \nsubprojects and include the following.  \n(i)  In the initial stages of subproject preparation, HRMG will consult with communities as part of the \nprocess of assessing whether a candidate road meets the eligibility criteria to be included in the \nInvestment  Program.  The  support  of  communities  is  a  key  criterion,  along  with  preliminary \nassessments about the potential scope of additional land requirements, existing land tenure, and \nwhether or not there are likely to be other adverse social and environmental impacts. \n(ii)  During preparation of the subproject profile, HRMG will organize and/or assist other parties (e.g., \nprovincial  land  officers  and  environmental  consultants)  to  organize  consultations,  awareness \nprograms and surveys that form part of the work (a) to conduct an environmental assessment of the \nsubproject; and (b) to identify additional land requirements to upgrade roads and, as necessary, to \nprepare a resettlement plan. \n(iii)  During the preparation and implementation of the subproject, HRMG will organize and/or assist other \nparties (e.g., provincial land officers, independent monitoring organization, and the social monitoring \nconsultant) to organize consultations. Awareness programs and surveys will also form part of the \nwork  on  (a)  acquisition  of  land  by  DLPP  to  establish  a  public  road  reserve,  (b)  independent \nmonitoring of land acquisition activities, (c) environmental monitoring work, and (d) baseline and \nfollow-up studies as part of the social monitoring study. HRMG will also assist as required with \ncommunity consultations that form part of the JFPR project.  \nThroughout the work on the subproject, the community relations officers and/or environmental officers from \nHRMG will meet periodically with communities in order to monitor whether there are social, environmental or \nother issues that require attention, for example, in relation to opportunities for community-based maintenance or \nresolution of grievances. These consultations will occur according to a program agreed with communities and/or \non an ad hoc basis. \nConsultations with communities along subproject roads will be designed not only to inform people about the \nsubproject or specific activities related to its preparation and implementation, but also to enable people in the \ncommunity to ask questions, make suggestions, state preferences and express concerns. HRMG will work with \ncommunity leaders to organize meetings with the community. Although different meetings may target specific \nstakeholders (e.g., affected landowners), HRMG and community leaders will encourage all members of the \ncommunity to participate. Special attention will be paid to the participation of women and any other vulnerable \ngroups. Because women are less likely to contribute to meetings that involve the entire community, HRMG will \nensure that women\u2019s focus groups are organized to obtain their views, preferences and concerns where relevant. \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.   Key Issues \n \nTribes in the Highlands are patriarchal societies, with traditional roles of men and women rigidly defined. The \nprimary roles of women are to bear children and to nurture the family. Women\u2019s work is to raise children, collect \nwater and firewood, and grow and provide food for their families. In the gardens, women do most of the planting, \nweeding and harvesting; they provide 45\u201370% of the agricultural labor for food cropping, and make significant \ncontributions  to  coffee  gardens  and  other  cash  crops. As the rural economy focuses more on cash crops and \n ", "Appendix 12  61 \n \nwage employment, the workload of women is increasing within existing agricultural livelihoods through the \nintensification of food cropping systems and women\u2019s contribution to cash cropping. As their husbands leave \nvillages to look for wage employment, women must take over their responsibilities for preparing gardens, or \nnegotiate with male relatives for assistance. As more and more children are in school, the family labor pool \ndiminishes. \nIn rural areas, more than three quarters of women are engaged in agricultural activities such as cultivating food \nand cash crops and raising small livestock. They generate cash incomes from the sale of cash crops and the \nlocal marketing of small surpluses of food crops and livestock. Women walk long distances every day, to and \nfrom their gardens, to and from local markets, to and from sources of drinking water. When they make these trips, \nthey are generally carrying heavy loads, including sweet potatoes and other produce from their gardens that they \nare carrying home and/or to the market, as well as their children. Women and children also tend to walk when \nthey are going to schools and health care facilities. In general, women do not use PMV or other transport \nservices. The daily trips to and from gardens do not require public transport. PMV and other transport services \nare often not available and/or services to health care facilities, markets, coffee factories and towns that are \nbeyond walking distance are infrequent. PMV drivers often provide only passenger services and do not allow \npeople to transport goods to market. The passenger fares and costs to transport goods mean that transporting \ngoods to market is often not economically viable. For women, the use of public transport can be unsafe, since \nthey are often victims of robbery and assaults including rape. \n \nThe health status of PNG women is poor, despite some improvements in recent years. The current fertility rate is \nhigh at 4.3 (compared to 6.1 in the 1970s). However, the high maternal mortality ratio of 370 deaths per 100,000 \nlive births has remained unchanged. Women\u2019s physical health is compromised by problems associated with \nexcessive workloads, poor nutrition and lack of access to safe water. Domestic violence causes physical injury \nand increases levels of stress and anxiety. Chronic sickness is often regarded as a \u201cnatural\u201d part of being a \nwoman in PNG. Based on available data from 1987 to 2005, the incidence of HIV in women aged 15\u201324 years \nwas 2\u20133 times higher than among men in this age group; the incidence of HIV continues to be significantly higher \namong women than among men in the 25\u201329 age group. The gender impacts of HIV mean that when women get \ninfected  and  become  sick,  it  not  only  affects  them  but  has  serious  consequences  for  households  and \ncommunities in PNG. \n2.

It will support women\u2019s and women groups to take \nadvantage of the employment and business opportunities associated with road rehabilitation and maintenance in \nthe project area. A two-pronged approach will be used to maximize impacts on women.  \n(i)  Adoption  of  employment  quotas  to  support  women\u2019s  involvement  in  road  rehabilitation  and \nmaintenance. In this respect, the DOW, through the HRMG, will encourage public works contractors to \nincrease the percentage of female workers to 30% of wage-laborers, and will require that 75% of bio-\nengineering contracts, awarded as a result of road construction and maintenance activities, be assigned to \nwomen. The HRMG will ensure that all PNG labor laws are respected, for instance with respect to equal pay \nfor work of equal value. \n(ii)  Community-based, gender-responsive prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The HIV \nManagement and Prevention Act. 2003 supports a multisector and gender-responsive approach to HIV \nprevention.  The  International  Federation  of  Consulting  Engineers  (FIDIC)  HIV  and  AIDS  prevention \nprovisions have been adopted by the DOW, for inclusion in the contract documents of road construction and \nmaintenance  projects.

Manila.)   \n \n ", "64  Appendix 13 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.   Introduction \n \n1.  The summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) presents the results and conclusions \nof environmental assessments for Project 1. The SIEE was prepared by Department of Works \n(DOW) on behalf of the Government of Papua New Guinea, following work carried out under the \nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA).1 Initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were \nprepared based on the preliminary design information for all Project 1 subprojects that were \nclassified Category B in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines, 2003.2 \nEnvironmental assessments will also be prepared for all subprojects in future in line with the \nenvironmental assessment review framework (EARF) that has also been prepared. \n \n2.  The Environment (Prescribed Activities) Regulations, 2002 under the Environment Act, \n2000 designate projects that need an environmental assessment as \u201cprescribed activities\u201d. The \nupgrading and rehabilitation of existing road sections is not listed as a prescribed activity and \ntherefore would not require an environmental permit. However the Department of Environment and \nConservation (DEC) has advised that certain activities, such as quarry operations, extraction of \ngravel  or  discharge  of  waste  water,  may  require  an  environmental  permit  depending  on  the \nduration  and  scale  of  the  activity.  The  DOW  will  therefore  disclose  the  scale  and  scope  of \nsubprojects to DEC to determine the procedures and any environmental permit needed under the \nEnvironment Act, 2000. ADB environmental requirements are stricter than PNG requirements and \nwill be applied (while also complying with the PNG requirements). \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n3.  The existing road infrastructure needs to be improved and the Investment Program will \nfocus on 1,400 km of priority roads of the 2,500 km Highlands Core Roads Network. It will include \ninstitutional strengthening and capacity building to support strategic management of the roads \nsector, including improving environmental management. The Project 1 subprojects will carry out \nimprovement of 211 km of roads including bridges in Enga and Southern Highlands provinces. In \nmost places, the existing road corridor is ample for the proposed rehabilitation works but minor \nland acquisition will be involved in some locations. The contractor for road improvement will also \ncover subsequent maintenance for a period of up to 10 years under a performance-specified \ncontract. \n \nC.   Description of the Environment \n \n4.  The PNG climate ranges from alpine to subtropical with diurnal temperatures from 200C to \n100C and annual rainfall exceeding 2,800 mm a year. The highlands areas have recently been \ninfluenced by El Ni\u00f1o events and the World Bank has reported that rainfall there may increase. The \nSouthern Highlands province and Enga have rugged mountains, steep limestone formations, flat \nplateaus, and fertile swampy valleys. Soil types are derived from fertile volcanic sources. Seismic \nactivity causes landslides and subsidence. Heavy rainfall and ground tremors cause roads to \ndeteriorate.  \n \n5.  The highlands provide the catchments for many large rivers and all the roads have several \nriver crossings. River flows are highest from December to April and most of the streams and creeks \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for Preparing the Highlands Highway (Southern Highlands \nand Enga Provinces Network) Rehabilitation Project. Manila.   \n2 ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila.  \n ", "Appendix 13  65 \ndischarge all year with high sediment and gravel loads being deposited in the lower reaches. \nDuring the wet season, bridges and culverts are regularly inundated, cutting off roads and villages. \nNone of the rivers near the subproject roads is subject to industrial pollution. The nearby industries, \nincluding  the  Porgera  Mine  (Enga)  and  the  Hides  Gas  Field  (Southern  Highlands),  have \nenvironment management systems based on international standards and are well away from the \nproposed subproject roads. The swamps used to cultivate water cress and taro will not be affected \nduring  construction.  Surface  and  groundwater  should  not  be  significantly  affected  by  the \nimplementation of the subprojects. \n \n6.  Subsistence agriculture dominates the Highlands\u2019 regional economy and throughout the \nProject 1 subprojects almost all areas below 2,400 meters above sea level are cultivated with a \nvariety of crops (especially coffee), grasslands, and shrub-lands. There are also groves of timber \ntrees (especially Casuarina and Eucalyptus species) and patches of regrowth forest. Cash crops \nare also grown.  \n \n7.  Forest areas are visible in between the agriculture but there are no undisturbed forests near \nthe Project 1 roads and there is no large-scale timber extraction. There is some small-scale saw-\nmill production from forests to provide timber and non timber products for the construction of \ndwellings and crafting artifacts. The nearest timber authority (Pi Tukure) is some 20 km to the north \nof the Nipa\u2013Ambua subproject road. Logging is unlikely to increase if these roads are improved. \nThe human impact is most pronounced in areas where grasslands created by numerous cycles of \nforest  clearance  for  agriculture  and  reversion  to  fallow  have  gradually  transformed  forest  to \ngrassland. There are no valuable ecological resources, protected sites, areas protected for their \nnatural habitats, or rare or endangered species near the Project 1 roads. \n \n8.  Quality of life is constrained by high population densities and strong agricultural pressures. \nMonthly income levels are low and the subproject areas include some of the most disadvantaged \ndistricts in PNG. The exceptions are the few people who earn higher wages at the local oil and \ngold industrial complexes.  \n \n9.  There are no sites of cultural significance near the Project 1. There are chapels and \nchurches nearby in some villages. There are graves placed within sight some of the roads but at \nleast 5m outside the road corridor away from where rehabilitation works would take place.  \n \n10.  Schools  are  set  well  back  from  the  Project  1  roads.  Traditional  houses  built  of  light \nmaterials are located along some of the roads. In many areas, the traditional style involves fences \nthat are higher than 2 m and mud walls next to the roads, creating a segregated compound for the \ninhabitants away from the roads.  \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n1.  Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures Associated with Planning, \nLocation and Design \n \n11.  The environmental impacts associated with subprojects under Project 1 will be generally \ninsignificant as the works involve only rehabilitation and upgrading of existing roads within the \nexisting corridor. The Investment Program will comply with the Environment Act, 2000, including \nnotifying the DEC of subprojects and designs (under section 48).   \n \n12.  Sensitive receivers have been assessed and it was found that the residential dwellings near \nthe subproject road are generally set back sufficiently far to be unaffected by traffic fumes. Road \n ", "66  Appendix 13 \ntraffic noise will not be sufficient to affect the sensitive receivers. There are no schools or medical \nfacilities near the subproject road. Roadside graves are set back from the working areas. The \noccasional roadside tea and food stalls are also set back from the likely working areas for road \nrehabilitation. During the detailed design phase and in preparation for the construction phase, the \nprogram support consultant and the Highlands Road Management Group (HRMG) will prepare \ntender documents to ensure that contractors will be prepared to mitigate environmental impacts. \n \n13.  To  comply  with  best  international  practices  and  ADB  guidelines,  the  procurement \nprocedures  will  follow  ADB  Guidelines  on  Environmentally  Responsible  Procurement  (2007).3 \nProcurement documents will specify that contractors will service and maintain powered mechanical \nequipment  in  a  safe  way  that  will  not  cause  significant impacts  on  the  environment.  Overall \nenvironmental impacts will be addressed, and the proposed mitigation measures for the roads are \nsummarized in the summary environmental management plan matrix in the IEE. Detailed EMPs \nare presented in the IEE reports for each subproject.  \n \n14.  The requirements in the contract will include full implementation of the EMP. The contractor \nwill also be required to engage capable and trained staff or site agents to take responsibility for the \nenvironmental management at the working level. The effective implementation of the EMP will be \naudited as part of the loan conditions. The DOW (the Implementing Agency) will also ensure that it \nhas  enough  resources  to  fulfill  the  requirements  of  the  law  and  guide  contractors  on  the \nenvironmental aspects of road construction. \n \n2.  Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures During Construction Phase \n \n15.  Site clearing may involve removal of trees and vegetation that will contribute to soil erosion \nduring construction in the rainy season. In the construction phase, the physical impacts will be from \nearthworks and may affect air quality and cause noise. There will be no significant effect on \ngroundwater. The potential impacts on surface water from the use of bitumen can be controlled by \nfollowing prescribed management plan procedures and the mitigation measures proposed in the \nenvironmental management plan. No significant impacts should arise if implementation of the  \nenvironmental management plan is carried out properly and is adequately budgeted. Monitoring \nwill be undertaken and, if complaints arise, mitigation measures will be reviewed and adjusted, as \nrequired. Air quality will be measured to ensure that the impacts are within acceptable levels.  \n \n16.  Construction  waste  and  solid  waste  will  be  addressed  properly  to  avoid  potential  soil \ncontamination and nuisance to the public. Fuels, lubricants, solid wastes, and material stockpiles \ncan all have water quality impacts, which can be avoided by proper storage of the materials, proper \ndisposal, and avoiding stockpiling near water sources. If complaints are received, possible sources \nof the problem will be investigated and water samples will be taken and analyzed, and compared \nwith the baseline and with the Water Quality Criteria Regulation, 2002. For possible erosion \nproblems, engineering controls that include erosion protection measures will be designed and \ninstalled to control soil erosion at all the constructed works and in peripheral areas, particularly in \nborrow areas and along haul tracks. Public safety, particularly of pedestrians and children may be \nthreatened by the excavation of the trenches for side drain construction, therefore a safety and \nhealth plan will be submitted by the contractor. \n \n17.  No significant ecological impacts are expected as the Project 1 subprojects will not be near \nany national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, protected forests, or forest management areas. They do \nnot affect any land near monuments of cultural or historical importance. Poaching of protected \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2007.

Manila.   \n ", "Appendix 13  67 \nanimals will be banned on all subproject sites, in compliance with the Fauna (Protection and \nContract) Act, 1966.  \n \n18.  The construction of subprojects will not involve a large amount of physical works and no \ndisplacement of housing or other permanent structures is expected. The social impacts of the \nconstruction stage are expected to be acceptable to the local community. Where small parcels of \nadditional land are required, there may be small losses of crops, trees, and/or secondary structures \nbut compensation will be provided in line with ADB guidelines. \n \n3.  Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures During Operations Phase \n \n19.  Traffic on all subproject roads will amount to a few hundred vehicles per day and it is \nunlikely  that  this  will  lead  to  any  significant  noise  disturbance,  accumulations  of  gaseous \nemissions, or particle emissions. No significant effect on groundwater or surface water is expected \nand waste management will be controlled through the maintenance contracts.  \n \n20.  The main environmental impacts during the operations phase will be soil erosion, water \nquality and community safety. Soil erosion will be prevented by engineering controls in the detailed \ndesigns, including flood and erosion control on either side of the embankment in case of heavy \nrains. However, this may cause natural streams and irrigation channels to become silted. Public \nsafety will need to be ensured particularly on newly constructed or upgraded roads where vehicle \nspeeds are expected to increase. A detailed EMP for each subproject (including a table that \npresents the project activities, potential environmental impacts, mitigation measures, institutional \nresponsibility  and  supervision,  and  the  monitoring  plan)  are  presented  in  the  IEE  of  each \nsubproject. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements, Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n1.  Institutional Requirements \n \n21.  An  international  environmental  specialist  will  be  engaged  intermittently  for  10  person-\nmonths as part of the Investment Program support consultant\u2019s team. The primary tasks of the \ninternational environmental specialist will be to (i) strengthen the environmental management of \nthe  Project  during  detailed  design,  bidding  process,  contract  process,  construction,  and \nimplementation; (ii) supervise and guide the environmental assessment process for all subprojects; \n(iii)  supervise  implementation  of  the  EMP  in  all  subprojects;  and  (iv)  undertake  institutional \nstrengthening, including on-the-job training for the environment  and environment specialist of the \nDOW by giving major tasks to them in all of these activities. The international environmental \nspecialist will report directly to the program support consultant and the environment officer will \nreport to DOW. They will be accountable and responsible for the implementation of the EMP. The \ndedicated  international  environmental  specialist  and  the  environment  officer  will  coordinate \nimplementation of the EMP of the subprojects. The DOW will allocate sufficient resources to the \ninternational  environmental  specialist  and  the  HRMG  environment  officer  to  enable  them  to \nundertake their tasks to supervise and monitor the environmental assessment process and to \nmonitor the EMP implementation of all subprojects.  \n \n22.  Before implementation of the subproject packages, the DOW and the program support \nconsultant will notify DEC in accordance with its prescribed format, for its endorsement of the \nenvironmental assessments required by the Government. The DOW through the program support \nconsultant will have the responsibility of ensuring all mitigation measures described in the EMPs \nare implemented by the contractors for each subproject. The environmental assessment review \n ", "68  Appendix 13 \nframework will include a general description of the anticipated environmental impacts, screening \nand classification procedures, environmental assessment of subprojects in future tranches, and \ncompliance with all PNG statutory requirements.  \n \n23.  Overall implementation of the EMP will be the DOW\u2019s responsibility. Other parties involved \nin implementing the EMP include contractors and government agencies, including HRMG and \nprogram support consultant management. Since several government agencies will be involved in \nimplementing  the  EMP,  induction  training  workshops  will  be  designed  by  the  international \nenvironment specialist to suit several levels of audiences (managerial, site agents, and staff).   \n \nF.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n \n24.  Public consultation was conducted from January to May 2008 in the provincial capitals. It \nincluded local residents, business owners, community leaders, and local officials.  \n \n25.  The results indicated that road improvements were welcome because they would facilitate \naccess and they had the potential to lower vehicle operating costs. All sections of the community \nwere keen to gain employment on road works in their areas. Road safety was also raised. There \nwas a clear appreciation among stakeholders about how they might fully benefit economically and \nsocially from improvement of roads. The IEE reports on the various subprojects report on these \nconsultations.  \n \nG.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n26.  Secondary data, public consultations, and route reconnaissance were used to complete the \nenvironmental assessments. During the detailed design of the four subprojects, the EMPs will be \nupdated and made as site-specific as possible. Environmental impacts will be mitigated, and \nrecommended  institutional  arrangements  will  be  followed.  Capacity  will  be  built  to  improve \nenvironmental  capability  and  to  ensure  the  subprojects  comply  with  statutes  and  with  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements.  Implementation  of  mitigation  measures  will  be  checked  and  monitored  by  the \ninternational environmental specialist together with the environment officer in the HRMG and the \nprogram support consultant.  A mechanism will be included to address unexpected impacts. \n \n27.  Most anticipated environmental impacts will take place during the construction phase and \nwill require environmental monitoring. Environmental reporting will be included in the monthly \nmonitoring reports throughout this phase. Implementation of environmental mitigation measures \nwill be the responsibility of the contractors and will be included in contracts.  \n \n28.  Contractor  environmental  awareness  training  will  be  undertaken  by  the  international \nenvironmental specialist and the environment officer. They will also assist the DOW and the NRA \nto develop environmental awareness at all levels. The IEE (including the EMP of subprojects) will \nbe used as a basis for an environmental compliance program. Environmental impacts related to \nthe operation and maintenance of the MFF subprojects will be carried out and reported, at least \nquarterly, as part of the project performance report and twice a year to ADB. \n \nH.  Environmental Assessment Review Framework \n \n29.  The  DOW  as  the  executing  agency  will  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the \nenvironmental assessment review framework (EARF), including preparation of an IEE, SIEE, EIA, \nor SEIA, if warranted, and implementation of environmental monitoring. Public consultations will be \ncarried out and the DOW will submit the required documentation to ADB.  \n ", "Appendix 13  69 \n30.  The program support consultant will ensure appropriate environmental assessment reports \n(incorporating the EMP) are submitted to ADB in time for review with the periodic financing request \nand before contracts are signed or work begins. The consultant will also ensure that the EMP and \nall required mitigation measures during construction are included in the contractors\u2019 contracts, with \nrequirements to update the EMP in response to any unexpected impacts. The program support \nconsultant will ensure that the EMP and all mitigation measures during construction are budgeted \nand fully implemented. \n \n31.  During  the  implementation  of  the  Investment  Program,  ADB  will  review  environmental \nassessment  reports  and  fulfill  the  advance  120-day  disclosure  requirement  where  necessary \nbefore a periodic financing request is submitted to ADB. It will monitor EMP implementation and \nconduct  due  diligence  as  part  of  MFF  reviews.  ADB  will  assist  the  DOW  to  carry  out  its \nresponsibilities  and  to  build  capacity  and  will  ensure  that  the  DOW  conducts  the  required \nconsultations with affected groups and local NGOs and that it provides relevant information on the \nproject\u2019s environmental issues at these consultations. An EARF has been prepared (available as \nSupplementary  Appendix  H)  that  presents  the  general  anticipated  environmental  impacts, \nsubproject selection criteria, classification procedure, and subproject environmental assessment \nprocedure. The EARF will guide the preparation and approval of environmental assessments of \nfuture projects likely to be financed under the Investment Program.  \n \nI.  Conclusion \n \n32.  The IEE reports for the subproject packages under Project 1 reveal that impacts can be \nmitigated to acceptable levels. The IEE reports were based on the road designs for rehabilitation. \nAt the implementation stage, HRMG will monitor the implementation of mitigation measures and \nmonitoring programs specified in each IEE. With these measures in place, it is predicted that all \npotential environmental impacts can be mitigated to insignificant levels, and therefore, no further \nimpact  assessment  is  considered  necessary.  It  is  also envisaged  that  environmental  impacts \nidentified by the study will not result in any residual impacts.  \n \n33.  The  EARF,  prepared  for  the  MFF,  will  guide  the  environmental  assessment  and \nmanagement of all subprojects in future tranches. \n \n ", "70  Appendix 14 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n1.  A resettlement framework has been prepared for the Investment Program and short \nresettlement plans have been prepared for Project 1 subprojects in compliance with the ADB \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995). These documents provide guidance on the policies and \nprocedures for payment of compensation to affected people for lost or damaged assets and \nminor land acquisition. At the beginning of each project, the policies and provisions of the \nresettlement framework will be reviewed and, as required, updated to reflect the conditions and \nrequirements for upgrading roads, but without lowering the standards set out in the present \nresettlement framework. The resettlement plans will be updated based on detailed engineering \ndesign during implementation of the Investment Program. \n \n2.  In the case of Project 1, the additional land required to improve roads in some sections \nwill be minor, averaging between 0.5 and 2.5 meters (m) increase in road width. There will be \nno displacement of housing and affected people will experience small losses of crops, trees, \nfences or other secondary structures. The total estimated land to be acquired for the Project 1 is \n41.85 hectares (ha). The estimated total number of affected persons is 152, distributed in the \nfour subproject areas as follows: 40 in Hiwinda Junction\u2013Koroba, 30 in Nipa\u2013Magarima\u2013Ambua, \n55 in Mendi\u2013Kandep, and 27 in Laiagam\u2013Porgera.   \n \n3.  The existing roads in the Highlands region (except from Mt. Hagen to Mendi corridor) are \ngenerally situated on customary land, the use of which has been agreed in consultation with the \nclans  and  communities  that  jointly  own  the  land.  In  order  to  expedite  implementation  of  \nProject  1,  use  of  the  land  required  to  upgrade  the  roads  will  be  agreed  by  clans  and \ncommunities through a memorandum of agreement (MOA). The Government has acquired a \npublic road reserve from Lae to Mendi and will formally acquire land along all project roads. \nWhile  the  DOW  is  currently  in  the  process  of  reviewing  the  requirements  for  public  road \nreserves, the resettlement framework covers the land acquisition impacts of up to 10 m width of \nroad, road clearance, and other infrastructure (e.g., drainage and culverts) under the Investment \nProgram for upgrading, rehabilitation, and maintenance.  \n \n4.  The Investment Program is a comprehensive, 10-year program to upgrade, rehabilitate, \nand maintain roads in the Highlands Highway network in PNG. The road selection criteria \nensure minimizing land acquisition and its impacts. The criteria will be used to screen and \nidentify suitable roads (or subprojects) eligible for financing under the Investment Program \nsubprojects. The routine and periodic maintenance of roads under the Investment Program will \nnot require the acquisition of any land; all maintenance will be carried out within the existing \nroadway. \n \n5.  The Investment Program entitlement matrix is in Table A17. Affected people will be \ncompensated for any loss of or damage to land, crops, trees, temporary structures or other \nassets, as per the policies of this resettlement framework. All costs for the Investment Program \nrelated to land acquisition, compensation and allowances, operation and administration costs, \nsurveys, monitoring and reporting will be financed by the Government.  \n \n6.  Compensation will be paid in cash at replacement cost. In addition to compensation, \naffected  persons  are  entitled  to  assistance,  e.g.,  to  help  them  move  to  temporary  shop \nstructures, to reimburse them for disruption of businesses, or to move personal possessions. \nAffected persons will also receive priority for employment for Investment Program civil works \nand ongoing maintenance.  \n \n ", "Appendix 14  71 \n7.  The Department of Works (DOW), as the Executing Agency for the Investment Program, \nhas overall responsibility for managing the planning, implementation, and monitoring related to \nacquiring use rights for additional land, as well as for paying compensation for damage to \nproject-affected  land.  The  DOW  has  delegated  to  Highlands  Road  Management  Group \n(HRMG), the Implementing Agency for the Investment Program, responsibility for carrying out \nthe planning, implementation, and monitoring of land activities to improve roads, including \npreparation of the subprojects and resettlement plans and all consultations.  \n \n8.  HRMG will monitor and report twice a year to DOW and ADB on all activities associated \nwith the MOA and payment of compensation to affected persons. HRMG\u2019s monitoring will \ninclude: (i) compliance with agreed policies and procedures; (ii) prompt approval, allocation and \ndisbursements  of  funds  and  payment  of  compensation  to  affected  persons,  including \nsupplemental compensation for additional and/or unforeseen losses; (iii) availability of other \nresources and efficient, effective use of these resources; and (iv) requirements for remedial \nactions. \n \n9.  HRMG  will  recruit  an  independent  monitoring  organization  to  conduct  external \nmonitoring for the subprojects. The monitoring organization will be recruited and mobilized at \nthe beginning of the first tranche of the Investment Program and will monitor and report to \nHRMG, the DOW, and ADB on all activities related to additional land requirements, community \nconsultations, preparation of resettlement plans, payment of compensation, and social impacts.  \n \n10.

The mechanisms will be based on the provisions of the Land Disputes \nSettlement Act. As a first step, traditional local mediation will be used, using appointed and \ntraditional leaders. In the event of grievances that cannot be resolved through local mediation, \nthe matter will be referred to the land court system.  \n \n12.  During the initial stages of  implementation, a training program will be established within \nthe HRMG to build (i) understanding of government policies and procedures for acquisition of \ncustomary land, including MOA and state alienation of land; (ii) knowledge of ADB policies and \nprocedures for land acquisition and compensation; (iii) understanding of how government and \nADB  policies  and  procedures  relate  to  the  requirements  of  the  Investment  Program;  and  \n(iv) expertise in carrying out surveys and data collection to prepare detailed measurement \nsurveys and land investigation reports, community consultations, and awareness programs. The \ntraining will target people from the DOW and HRMG, provincial and district lands officers in \nsubproject areas, staff of the office of the Valuer General and any other organizations involved \nin land acquisition and compensation activities.  \n \n     ", "  7\n2\n \nTable A17: Highlands Region Road Improvement Investment Program Entitlement Matrix  A\np\nType of Impact  Entitled Person  Entitlements  Expected Results  Implementation Issues  p\ne\nAffected Land  nd\nTemporary use of land  Customary land:  Use of the land will be acquired through negotiated  Compensation (in form of  The agreement to use  ix 1\nLand users as  leases with landowners.  land lease) for use of land.  customary land, whether   4\nrecognized by clan  Cash compensation at replacement cost will pay for  Compensation for damaged  temporarily or permanently, \nleaders  damaged crops, fences or other structures on project- crops, trees, fences or  will be negotiated based on \naffected land.  other structures.  the following conditions: \nIn the case of extraction of materials (e.g., gravel) from  (i) landowners agree to and \nthe land, the civil works contractor will negotiate directly  support the upgrading and \nwith the landowner to reach agreement regarding the  rehabilitation of the road; \npayment of royalties.
