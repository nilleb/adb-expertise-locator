The government\u2019s 11th \nFive Year Plan, 2007\u20132012 targeted the creation of 79 gigawatts (GW) of additional capacity for \ngrid power. Actual realization did not exceed 50 GW, largely on account of slippages in public \nsector  projects.  The  government\u2019s  draft  12th  Five  Year  Plan,  2012\u20132017  targets  100  GW, \nincluding  28  GW  of  capacity  from  projects  that  were  supposed  to  be  completed  during  the \nprevious  plan.  However,  because  of  the  continued  growth  in  power  demand,  power  supply  is \nexpected to continue to remain 10%\u201312% short of demand every year during the 12th plan.1 \n \n3. \nIndia also needs to preserve its energy mix, not only to combat climate change but also \nto  ensure  the  country\u2019s  energy  security.  The  availability  of  indigenous  conventional  fuels  is \ndiminishing  and  India  has  to  import  increasing  quantities  of  coal  and  liquefied  natural  gas. \nInvesting in renewable power mitigates import dependency and the impact of potential imported \nfuel price increases. The share of renewable power in total installed capacity has declined from \n44% in 1970 to 31% in 2011. The government intends to stop this decline and has set a goal of \nmaintaining the proportion of renewable power at its current level (31%) until 2023.2 \n \n4. \nThe  government\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy  is  based  on  three  pillars:  (i)  reforming  the \nsector\u2019s  policy  and  regulatory  framework,  (ii)  promoting  energy  efficiency,  and  (iii)  promoting \nrenewable energy. The draft 12th plan calls for a continued emphasis on renewable resources. \nIndia\u2019s  renewable  energy  potential  is  80%  unrealized  and  the  largest  untapped  renewable \nresources  are  hydro  (125  GW)  and  wind  (68  GW).  Yet,  renewable  energy  capacity  addition \nsince  2007  has  been  disappointing,  especially  for  hydropower.  During  the  11th  plan,  hydro \ncapacity addition was only 5,400 megawatts (MW) against a target of 15,600 MW (footnote 2). \n \n5. \nThe  private  sector  is  expected  to  play  an  increasing  role  in  accelerating  the  pace  of \ninvestment in renewable energy to realize India\u2019s potential fully. In particular, the private sector \nis expected to be more involved in hydropower. As of December 2011, the private sector share \nin hydropower installed capacity was 7% as opposed to 21% in thermal power (footnote 2). The \nprivate sector will also continue to drive the development of wind power,  which is expected to \nrepresent 40% of the renewable energy capacity addition during the 12th plan (11,000 MW out \nof 27,700 MW\u2014 about the same expected capacity addition as hydropower).  \n \n6. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) was approached by NRPPL in April 2012 and the \nstructure of the investment in the form of equity was finalized in September 2012 during the due \ndiligence mission. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s strategy of supporting renewable energy \ndevelopment and will be ADB\u2019s first nonsovereign investment in the hydropower sector in India. \nThe  project  is  also  consistent  with  the  Private  Sector  Operations  Department\u2019s  strategy  of \n\n                                                \n1   Government of India, Planning Commission. 2011.

Delhi. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\npursuing  investments  through  innovative  financial  structures.  Supporting  a  renewable  energy \ndeveloper  with  growth  capital,  as  opposed  to  single  project  financing,  is  a  way  to  achieve \ngreater leverage of ADB\u2019s funds and greater development impact in terms of capacity addition. \n \nSeveral  Indian  renewable  energy  developers  have  been  considered  for  growth  capital \n7. \nfunding  since  2010  and  NRPPL  was  found  to  be  the  most  suited  for  an  investment  by  ADB. \nNRPPL combines the presence of a strong sponsor, a strong track record, a solid pipeline, and \na commitment to comply with ADB\u2019s environmental and social safeguards. ADB assistance will \nimprove  NRPPL\u2019s  ability  to  attract  other  investors  and  to  prepare  for  an  initial  public  offering \n(IPO), enabling the company to achieve its target of at least 1,000 MW of operating renewable \npower projects in India by 2017. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n8. \nThe project encompasses the development by NRPPL of at least 175 MW of renewable \nenergy projects by 2017. The 100 MW Tidong hydropower project in Himachal Pradesh and the \n75  MW  Chilarewadi  wind  project  in  Maharashtra  are  included  as  identified  subprojects  in  the \nscope of the project. The company may identify other wind subprojects in India after approval by \nADB\u2019s Board of Directors and utilize part of the proposed ADB funding for these subprojects.3 \n \n9. \nThe Tidong run-of-river hydropower project is located near the town of Reckong Peo on \nthe  Tidong  River  in  Himachal  Pradesh,  about  230  kilometers  (km)  from  Shimla.  The  Tidong \nRiver  is  primarily  snow-fed.  More  than  30  years  of  hydrological  data  are  available  from \ngovernment  sources.  The  plant  load  factor  was  estimated  at  54.8%  at  P50.4  Hydrological \nanalysis was conducted by Chubu Electric Power, a Japanese power company. The project will \ninclude a 16 km transmission line up to the grid connection point at Kashang. \n \n10. \nThe  Tidong  project  tied  up  its  entire  debt  requirements  in  2010.  Lenders  include  Axis \nBank,  L&T  Infra Finance,  State  Bank  of  Hyderabad,  State  Bank  of  Patiala,  and Canara  Bank. \nConstruction  is  50%  complete  and  the  commercial  operation  date  is  expected  by  June  2016. \nThe project requires a total equity funding of $41.9 million.  \n \n11. \nThe  Chilarewadi  project  is  located  in  Maharashtra,  85  km  from  the  city  of  Satara.  All \nprivate land required for the project has been acquired, while the required government land is at \nadvanced stages of acquisition. NRPPL engaged AWS Truepower, a leading renewable energy \nconsulting  company,  to  carry  out  the  wind  analysis  and  estimation  of  annual  energy.  AWS \nTruepower  estimated  the  P50  plant  load  factor  at  26.7%.  The  project  will  include  a  7  km \ntransmission line that will connect to the existing Sholapur\u2013Karad transmission line. \n \n12. \nThe  Chilarewadi  project  is  expected  to  be  commissioned  by  December  2013. \nCertification  from  the  Centre  for  Wind  Energy  Technology  was  received  in  July  2010.  The \nproject is expected to reach financial close by March 2013. Limited recourse debt financing will \nbe provided by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), Standard Chartered Bank, and PTC \nIndia Financial Services. The project requires a total equity funding of $28.9 million. \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Sponsor \n\nNRPPL  is  a  leading  renewable  power  developer  in  India.  NRPPL  intends  to  have  a \n\n13. \ndiversified portfolio of more than 1,000 MW operational renewable power projects by 2017. \n \n\n                                                \n3  Any new project would have to meet criteria specified by ADB for use of ADB funds. \n4  P50 means a probability of 50%: the plant load factor is expected to be at least 54.8% in 50% of the years. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n\nNRPPL  is  72.7%  owned  by  the  NSL  Group.  The  group  includes  the  largest  seed \n14. \ncompany in India (Nuziveedu Seeds), as well as companies engaged in textiles, cotton, sugar, \nand  the  manufacturing  of  wind  turbines.  The  wind turbine  business  (Regen)  has  a technology \nagreement  with  Vensys  from  Germany.  The  NSL  Group  is  owned  by  husband-and-wife  team \nPrabhakar Rao and Asha Priya.5 FE Clean, a private equity fund, and IFC invested a combined \n$60 million in NRPPL in 2011. \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n\n1. \n\nImpacts \n\n15. \nThe project will contribute to the continued development of renewable energy generation \nin  India.  In  doing  so,  it  will  help  preserve  India\u2019s  energy  mix  by  relying  on  indigenous  energy \nsources as opposed to imported fuels. The project will contribute to the national goal of at least \nmaintaining  the  proportion  of  renewable  power  in  total  installed  capacity  at  its  current  level \n(31%) until 2023. \n \nADB\u2019s  assistance  will  also  support  private  sector  development  by  catalyzing  private \n16. \ninvestment in the Indian renewable energy sector. As a result of continued government support \nfor private sector participation in renewable energy, the private sector share in the total installed \ncapacity of renewable energy in India is expected to increase from 33% in 2011 to 50% in 2023. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n17. \nThe  outcome  will  be  an  increased  production  of  renewable  energy.  The  project  is \nexpected  to  generate  530  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  annually  and  avoid  400,000  tons  of  carbon \ndioxide  annually  from  2017  onward,  as  well  as contribute  to  local  employment generation  and \ntax revenue. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput \n\nThe  output  will  be  100  MW  of  hydropower  and  at  least  75  MW  of  wind  power  plants \n\n18. \ndeveloped and commissioned by 2016. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy  \n\nThe project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.6 It relates to two of ADB\u2019s five core \n19. \nareas  of  operations:  infrastructure  and  environment.  The  strategy  calls  for  ADB  support  for \nclean  energy  development  to  meet  growing  energy  demands  in  a  sustainable  manner.  The \nproject  will  contribute  to  ADB\u2019s  operational  goal  of  scaling  up  private  sector  development  and \nprivate sector operations. \n \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  India  country  partnership  strategy,  2009\u20132012.7  One  of \n20. \nthe  four  pillars  of  the  strategy  is  support  for  inclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable  growth \nthrough an enhanced focus on renewable energy. The draft country partnership strategy, 2013\u2013\n2017  maintains  this  focus  with  a  call  for  the  \u2015expansion  of  clean  and  renewable  energy \n\n                                                \n5  P.

Starting in 2013, ADB \nhas increased its target of clean energy investments to $2 billion a year from the earlier target of \n$1 billion. The policy emphasizes private sector participation as a tool to enhance energy sector \nefficiency by introducing increased competition and increased investable resources. \n \n22. \nThe  project  will  complement  ADB\u2019s  sovereign  assistance  to  the  energy  sector  in \nHimachal  Pradesh,  where  the  Tidong  project  is  located.  In  2008,  the  Board  approved \n$800 million  assistance  to  Himachal  Pradesh  government  to  increase  the  state  government- \nowned  hydroelectric  capacity  from  about  400 MW  in  2007  to  about  1,200  MW  in  2016.10  By \nadding  100  MW  capacity  from  the  private  sector,  the  project  will  join  forces  with  the  public \nsector\u2019s  effort  in  realizing  the  state\u2019s  hydropower  potential.  In  2011,  the  Board  approved \nadditional  $350  million  assistance  to  the  state  government  to  support  the  development  of  the \nnecessary transmission systems to evacuate the power generated by the hydropower projects \nbeing  developed.  A  technical  assistance  grant  was  approved  at  the  same  time  to  support \ncapacity  development  of  the  state  agency  in  charge  of  these transmission  systems,  Himachal \nPradesh  Power  Transmission  Corporation.11  This  will  directly  benefit  the  project  since  the \ntransmission line required to evacuate power from Tidong has to be built by the state agency.  \n  \n\n3. \n\nLessons from Previous Operations \n\n23. \nNo  evaluation  report  has  been  produced  yet  on  ADB-financed  hydropower  projects  in \nIndia.  However,  an  evaluation  study  by  ADB\u2019s  Independent  Evaluation  Department  on  the \n114 MW  Dagachhu  hydropower  project  in  Bhutan,  which  was  financed  by  a  sovereign  loan, \nstressed the importance for ADB to support the development of medium-size (50 MW\u2013200 MW) \nhydropower  projects  through  private  sector  investments  under  the  public\u2013private  partnership \nmodel.12  The  study  also  highlighted  the  environmental  and  social  issues  associated  with  the \nlarge-scale  development  of  hydropower  in  the  Himalayas.  Thorough  environmental  and  social \ndue diligence has been conducted on the Tidong hydro project and issues will be addressed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies. \n \n24. \nThe  extended  annual  reviews  of  wind  projects  previously  financed  by  ADB\u2019s  Private \nSector Operations Department in India highlighted three key lessons: (i) the importance of wind \nresource  assessment,  (ii)  the  risks  associated  with  land  acquisition  if  forestland  is  included  in \nthe scope of the project, and (iii) the need for more power evacuation facilities. In the case of \nthe  Chilarewadi  wind  project,  these  risks  are  mitigated  by  (i)  the  wind  study  conducted  by  a \nreputable  specialized  firm,  (ii)  the  absence  of  forestland,  and  (iii)  the  limited  length  of  the \nrequired transmission line to connect to the grid (7 km). NRPPL is following the same approach \nfor other wind projects that it is developing, starting with several years of wind data collection. \n\n                                                \n8  ADB. 2012.

Consistent with the policy, the project was allotted following a competitive tender \nand may sell power to any third-party off-taker, although a proportion of the power output \nwill have to be allocated free of cost to the state utility for 30 years (\u2015free power\u2016). \n \nThe New Policy for Power Generation from Non-Conventional Sources of Energy of \nMaharashtra, 2008 provides incentives for wind power development in the state and is \napplicable to the Chilarewadi wind project. Under this policy, the projects are required to \nsell at least 50% of the power to Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company  \nunder long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs).  \nThe management team of NSL Renewable Power Private Limited (NRPPL) is composed \nof seasoned professionals with relevant experience in the renewable energy sector. To \nmanage projects effectively across India, the company has set up satellite offices in five \nstates in addition to the headquarter office in Hyderabad.   \n\nManagement \n\nImplementation period  Tidong: February 2009\u2013June 2016 \n\nChilarewadi: January 2013\u2013December 2013 \nAll contracts for Tidong have been or will be granted following international competitive \nbidding. The civil works contract was allocated to Himalaya Construction Company, an \nIndian firm with good tunneling experience. The electromechanical works were awarded \nto Alstom Projects India. Selection of the hydro-mechanical contractor will be done by \nJune 2013. All contracts include performance security, warranty period, and liquidated \ndamages. Nevertheless, 25% of the capital cost has been budgeted as contingency. \n \nFor Chilarewadi, the project company entered into an arm\u2019s length supply, erection, and \ncommissioning contract with Regen. Regen was selected after a comparative study with \ntwo other potential turbine suppliers (GE and Vestas) conducted by AWS Truepower, a \nwind power consultant. Based on the review conducted by Lahmeyer International, the \nlenders\u2019 independent engineer, the terms and conditions specified in the supply \nagreement are at par with good industry practices.  \nThe Tidong project company has entered into a 15-year PPA with Tata Power with \nupside sharing. If the merchant tariff realized by Tata Power is above the base tariff \n(Rs4.4 per kilowatt-hour [kWh]), the difference will be shared between NRPPL and Tata \nPower on a 90:10 basis. \n \nThe Chilarewadi project company will enter into a 13-year PPA with Maharashtra State \nElectricity Distribution Company. The PPA will be signed after the commissioning of the \nproject, as mandated by policy. Wind power density for the project site was estimated at \n236.20 W/m2 at 50 meters (m) above ground level by the Centre for Wind Energy \nTechnology. As such, the project falls under zone 1 (low wind density) with an applicable \ntariff of Rs.5.67/kWh.  \nNRPPL plans to manage the O&M of the Tidong hydro project internally by hiring \nhydropower experts. The O&M cost is minimized since the hydropower experts will \nhandle the operations of the four hydro projects of NRPPL.  \n \nRegen will undertake the O&M for the Chilarewadi project for 20 years. The first 2 years \nfrom the date of commissioning will be covered by the warranty period. The annual O&M \n\nConstruction \narrangements  \n\nRevenue structure \n\nOperation and \nmaintenance (O&M)  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\n \n\nAspects \n\nPerformance \nmonitoring \n\nArrangements \ncost is set for the first 10 years. The O&M cost from the 11th to the 20th year will be \nmutually agreed 6 months prior to the 10th year after commissioning.  \nFinancial performance and key performance indicators, including output and outcome \nindicators, will be reported by NRPPL.  \n\nSource: NSL Renewable Power, Asian Development Bank staff due diligence. \n \nF. \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\n28.  \nThe project is financially viable because the expected financial internal rate of return is \n15.6% for Tidong and 15.0% for Chilarewadi, higher than the weighted average cost of capital of \n11.0%. The project is economically sustainable as the economic internal rate of return is 12.4% \nfor Tidong and 13.8% for Chilarewadi, higher than the social discount rate of 12.0%. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nADB  will  invest  up  to  $30  million  (in  Indian  rupee  equivalent)  in  NRPPL  in  the  form  of \n\n29. \ncommon equity shares to partially fund the company\u2019s equity injection in identified subprojects.  \n30. \nThe  equity  investment  has  been  structured  to  address  the  capital  needs  of  NRPPL.  It \nprovides growth capital to NRPPL without imposing the burden of interest payments, while the \nasset base is being expanded. It will enable ADB to share the investment upside created by an \nIPO.  \n  \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n31. \nADB\u2019s  assistance  will  support  the  government\u2019s  policy  to  develop  renewable  energy, \nparticularly  hydropower  where  the  private  sector  has  been  slow  to  move  and  where  ADB  has \nbeen  looking  for  good  opportunities  for  some  time.  ADB\u2019s  investment  will  strengthen  a  local \nrenewable  energy  sponsor  with  a  good  operational  track  record  and  solid  pipeline.  ADB\u2019s \npresence  is  expected  to  catalyze  further  private  equity  investment  and  facilitate  a  future  IPO. \nThis will help the company reach its target of 1,000 MW of operational renewable energy assets \nby  2017.  ADB\u2019s  presence  will  also  enhance  the  company\u2019s  commitment  to  comply  with \nenvironment and social safeguard standards. Finally, ADB\u2019s Future Carbon Fund will potentially \nprovide carbon offtake to Clean Development Mechanism registered projects. \n \nC. \n\nRisks  \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n32. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified \ncategory  A  for  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \nindigenous peoples based on the significance of impacts from two identified subprojects (Tidong \nand  Chilarewadi).  The  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  project  have  been \nidentified; and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts are incorporated in the corporate audit report recommendations and safeguard reports \nand  plans  for  the  identified  subprojects.  A  draft  environmental  and  social  impact  assessment \nand a compliance audit report for Tidong (classified category A for environment) were posted on \nADB\u2019s  website  in  June  2012.  The  institutional  capacity  of  NRPPL  to  manage  the  project\u2019s \nenvironmental and social impacts needs to be strengthened according to the compliance audit \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nreport.  Based  on  ADB's  due  diligence,  all  safeguard  reports  and  plans  were  improved  and \nupdated to include additional assessment and additional measures, such as erosion prevention \nof construction wastes for Tidong. The company is committed to implement these measures and \nto  continue  to  build  the  capacity  of  its  staff  and  contractors  to  manage  the  project\u2019s \nenvironmental and social effectively. The revised safeguard reports and plans were posted on \nADB\u2019s website in March 2013. Information disclosure and consultations with affected people are \nconducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s requirements. \n \nThe  project  is  classified  as  having  no  gender  elements.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the \n33.  \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  requiring  NRPPL  to  comply  with \nnational  labor  laws  and,  in  addition,  to  take  specific  measures  (including  in  relation  to \ncontractors)  in  relation  to  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standard  for  the  ADB \nfinanced portion of the project, in compliance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.13  \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy and Anti-Money-Laundering Policies  \n\nNRPPL  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date),  and \n34. \npolicy  relating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003). \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  will \nrequire NRPPL to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  and  money \nlaundering  activities  and  the  financing  of  terrorism;  and  to  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations  \n\nThe proposed equity investment is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and \n\n35. \nsingle-project exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\n36. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment of India\u2019s no objection to the proposed assistance to NRPPL will be obtained. ADB \nwill  enter  into  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB, \nfollowing approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n37. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  equity  investment  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the President, \nunder the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the \nBoard approve the equity investment of up to $30,000,000 (in Indian rupee equivalent) in NSL \nRenewable Power Private Limited for the Hydro and Wind Power Development Project in India \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  such  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n\n \nBindu N.
