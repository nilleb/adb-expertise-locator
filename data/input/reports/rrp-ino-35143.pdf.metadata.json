The Project will \nalso  contribute  to  establish  a  conducive  policy,  institutional,  and \nregulatory environment to meet the housing needs of urban poor \ncommunities in informal settlement areas. \n \nWith  the  population  of  Indonesia  expected  to  have  reached  209 \nmillion inhabitants in 2000, and an urbanization rate of 40%, some \n84  million  people  are  living  in  Indonesian  cities.  The  rate  of \nurbanization continues apace. Some 20% of households are poor \nor  vulnerable  to  poverty.  Housing  and  housing  finance  markets \ntheir \nhave  not  provided  products \ncircumstances. As a result, almost all of these people are living in \ninformal areas and are experiencing a deterioration in the level of \nservices  and  infrastructure  provided  by  local  government,  itself \nhard pressed by fiscal stringency. \n \nThe  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  reduce  income  poverty  and \nquality-of-life poverty in urban areas. The purpose of the Project is \nto  put  in  place  mechanisms  for  provision  of  affordable  housing \nand serviced land for the poor. In order to do this, it will (i) improve \nthe access of low-income urban families to tenured, serviced plots \nand  to  opportunities  for  house  upgrading  and  new  housing;  (ii) \nprovide appropriate finance for shelter and other services; and (iii) \nstrengthen \nthe \nNational  Land  Agency,  financing  institutions,  and  DGHS  to \nparticipate in a pro-poor shelter provision and finance system. \n \n\nlow-income  communities, \n\nthat  are  appropriate \n\nlocal  governments, \n\nto \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nObjective \n\n \n\n\fCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\niv \n\n \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\nis  expected \n\nto  cost  $126.5  million  equivalent, \nThe  Project \ncomprising $111.9 million (88%) in local currency and $14.6 million \n(12%) in foreign currency. \n \n\n($ million) \n\nItem \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n\nPercentage \n(%) \n\nAsian Development Bank \n\n ADF \n\n OCR \n\nCentral Government \n\nCity Governments \n\nCFIs/LFIs \n\nBeneficiaries \n\n14.6 \n\n3.98 \n\n10.62 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n74.0 \n\n16.02 \n\n57.98 \n\n5.6 \n\n30.1 \n\n0.5 \n\n1.7 \n\n88.6 \n\n20.0 \n\n68.6 \n\n5.6 \n\n30.1 \n\n0.50 \n\n1.70 \n\n70.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n4.4 \n\n23.8 \n\n0.4 \n\n1.3 \n\nTotal \n\n  14.6 \n\n 111.9 \n\n 126.5 \n\n 100.0        \n\n \nADF  =  Asian  Development  Fund,  CFI  =  central  financial  institution,  LFI  =  local \nfinancial institution, OCR = ordinary capital resources. \nNote: Figures may not add up to total because of rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nLoan  proceeds  amounting  to  about  $15  million  equivalent  will  be \nrelent  to  participating  financial  institutions  at  the  cost  of  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) funds plus guarantee and administration \nfees and a foreign exchange risk premium, if applicable.  \n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  $68.6  million  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  of  ADB \nwill  be  provided  under  its  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.75%  per  annum,  and  a  front-end  fee  of  0.50%,  and  such  other \nterms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement. (In the event \nthat the loan is not approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in 2003, \nthe  front-end  fee  will  revert  to  1%,  or  such  other  percentage  to  be \ndetermined  by  the  Board.)  A  loan  of  $20  million  will  also  be \nprovided  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an  interest \ncharge  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum thereafter, and a term of 32 years, including a grace period \nof 8 years. \n \nUntil December 2009 \n \n30 June 2009 \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n\n\fv \n\ninto  project  design  and \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years,  from  2004  to  2010. \nDGHS  will  form  a  project  steering  committee  (PSC).  The  National \nDevelopment Planning Board (BAPPENAS) will chair the PSC and \nhave prime responsibility for overall coordination. Each participating \nlocal government will organize a local coordinating office to ensure \nefficient  project  execution  and  incorporation  of  priorities  of  local \ncommunities \nimplementation.  The \nmembership  of  the  local  coordinating  office  will  include  community \nrepresentatives  to  ensure  proper  implementation  of  community \naction  plans  and  resettlement  guidelines.  Involuntary  resettlement \nwill  be  minimal  as  existing  sites  will  be  upgraded  or  new  vacant \nsites developed.  \n \nDirectorate  General  of  Housing  and  Settlements,  Ministry  of \nSettlements and Regional Infrastructure \n \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement will be followed. \n \nConsultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. A \nteam of international and domestic project management consultants \nwill  help  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  implement,  manage, \nand  monitor  project  activities.  The  consultants  will  help  review \ncommunity  action  plans  and  contract  documents,  and  provide \ntraining  for  local  governments,  local  financial  institutions  (LFIs)  or \ntheir branches, and the PMU in project implementation, monitoring \nand  evaluation, \nfinance,  and  community  participation.  Local \ngovernment counterpart funds will finance local coordinating offices. \nWhere  required  for  these  units,  domestic  consultants  will  be \nrecruited following procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \nThe  Project  will  support  the  poverty  reduction  goals  of  the \nGovernment  and  ADB,  and  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  urban \ninformal  settlers.  Under  site  and  service  development  subprojects, \nland ownership issues will be resolved and individual titles or other \nforms of secure tenure distributed, directly benefiting 180,000 poor \nurban  households  in  a  minimum  of  30  local  governments.  Nearby \ncommunities  will  indirectly  benefit  from  the  provision  of  off-site \ninfrastructure,  including  flood  protection  facilities,  main  roads,  and \nmain  drainage  systems.  Similar  cases  of  site  improvement  have \nbeen  shown  to  increase  the  market  value  of  land  by  200\u2013700%. \nSignificant  gains  will  accrue  to  the  implementing  agencies  (as \nincreased  revenues \ntaxes)  as  well  as  end-\nbeneficiaries  (as  better  social,  financial,  and  economic  status). \nOverall,  the  Project  is  expected  to  have  a  poverty  impact  ratio  of \nover 0.52.  \n \n\nfrom  property \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nExecuting Agency \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting Services \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\nThe key risk to the Project is the possibility of faltering commitment \nof  local  governments  to  facilitating  the  provision  of  shelter  for  the \npoor  in  a  sustainable  manner.

The Project was formulated using a sample of \nsix  pilot  local  governments.2  Project  design  incorporates  feedback  from  consultations  with  the \nGovernment  and  target  beneficiaries.  This  report  is  based  on  the  findings  of  the  Appraisal \nMission,  conducted  on  13\u201331  October  2003;  reports  of  the  PPTA  consultants;  and  follow-on \ndiscussions  with  the  national  and  local  governments,  international  assistance  agencies, \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  beneficiaries.  The  proposed  executing  agencies, \nGovernment, and ADB agreed on the project goals, objectives, scope and scale, cost estimates, \nand financing plan. The project framework is in Appendix 1.  \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nDemand for urban infrastructure services and housing is increasing. The population was \n203.4 million in 2000, compared to 119.2 million in 1971. Although Indonesia has dramatically \nreduced  its  population  growth  rate  (from  2.32%  in  1971\u20131980  to  1.61%  in  1980\u20131999),  the \nurban population continues to grow at about 4.6% per year (1990\u20132000). An estimated 42.5% of \nthe population was living in urban areas in 2000; the figure is estimated to be over 50% by 2010 \nand 60% by 2025.  \n\n4. \nDespite  heavy  investments  in  environmental  infrastructure,  conditions  in  poor  urban \nareas continue to deteriorate, aggravated by the impact of the 1997 economic crisis. Only about \n36% of the urban population has access to piped water. Land administration leaves much to be \ndesired. The National Land Agency (BPN) is responsible for land administration of only 30% of \nthe national land, and less than 10% of the country is covered by cadastral maps. While housing \nfinance  has  received  considerable  attention  as  the  main  instrument  to  increase  and  improve \naccess to housing, the policy response has often neglected the interests of the poor. Conditions \nfor  credit  access  (requiring  land  title,  30%  down  payment,  verifiable  income)  virtually  exclude \nthe  poor,  especially  the  self-  or  informally  employed.  Subsidies  routed  through  the  financial \nsystem, therefore, do not reach the poor. \n\n5. \nExternal assistance has been provided to the sector institutions (Appendix 2), but most \nrecent assistance has supported decentralization by strengthening local governments, focusing \non city-wide infrastructure projects, and has not specifically targeted shelter. The Project does \nnot, therefore, duplicate any ongoing assistance. A more detailed sector analysis is in Appendix \n3. \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2002.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Government  of  Indonesia  for  the  Neighborhood  Upgrading  and  Shelter \nSector Project. Manila (TA 3895-INO, for $1 million, with $500,000 cofinancing provided by the Government of the \nUnited Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development). \n\n2   Local governments comprise city governments (kota) and districts (kabupaten). \n\n\f2 \n\nthat \n\n(i)  community \n\ninternational  experience  are \n\nThe Project benefits from considerable experience in the sector, in Indonesia and other \n6. \ncountries.  Indonesia\u2019s  Kampung  (village)  Improvement  Program  (KIP)  achieved  considerable \nprogress  in  providing  basic  infrastructure  to  poor  neighborhoods.  The  key  lessons  of  this  and \nother \nin  planning  and \nimplementation  improves  targeting  and,  in  conjunction  with  these  factors,  education  in  basic \nmaintenance increases the chances that provided infrastructure will be well maintained; (ii) poor \nhouseholds need secure tenure if they are to invest in their housing and neighborhood; and (iii) \na comprehensive approach, systematically selecting and prioritizing areas for upgrading, is most \neffective. Under KIP, later and more participatory projects were more sustainable. While tenure \nin Indonesia is not as dire as in some countries, owing to multiple levels and means of acquiring \nsome claim to title, upgrading of titles is a priority for the urban poor. KIP also demonstrated that \nin  the  resource  trade-off  between  large-scale  and  focused  scope  versus  small-scale  and \nbroader  scope,  such  as  in  the  Philippines,  the  former  was  more  effective  when  guided  by \nsystematic investment planning. \n\ninvolvement \n\n7. \nUntil  recently  international  experience  in  housing  finance  was  similar  to  Indonesia\u2019s \nexperience.  However,  recent  developments  in  Latin  America  and,  on  a  smaller  scale,  in \nThailand and the Philippines, and in the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and \nUnited  Nations  (UN)  Habitat  Community-Based  Initiatives for  Housing  and  Local Development \n(CoBILD) project in Indonesia have shown that microfinance techniques are more successful in \nproviding  shelter  finance  to  the  poor.  Short-term,  small  loans  successfully  finance  incremental \nimprovements to housing and sequential purchase of lot and improved shelter. \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n8. \nLaws  22  and  25/1999  give  local  governments  autonomy  and  a  mandate  to  provide,  or \nfacilitate  the  provision  of,  a  number  of  urban  services,  including  housing  and  slum  upgrading. \nHowever, the organizational structure for pro-poor shelter provision in local governments is not \nwell  developed.  Few  cities  (Jakarta,  Tangerang,  and  Surabaya)  have  dedicated  pro-poor \nhousing programs, partly because city governments do not think pro-poor shelter investment is \nneeded  to  reduce  poverty.  Upgrading  has  not  been  a  priority.  However,  this  perception  is \nchanging  as  local  governments  are  being  elected,  and  their  capacity  in  the  sector  should  be \nstrengthened.  Based  on  sector  assessments  and  policy  studies,  DGHS  recommended \nestablishing  housing  development  organizations  (HDOs)  in  each  local  government  and \nsupporting  them  with  technical  resources  and  access  to  finance  for  housing  and  upgrading \nprograms.  The  HDO  should  draft  a  local  housing  policy,  plan  housing  and  site  identification, \nmonitor and evaluate implementation, help acquire land (where state land is used or in the case \nof compulsory purchase), and manage local government housing.  \n\n9. \nAs  the  poor  lack  access  to  finance  to  buy  land  and  upgrade  their  houses,  accessible \nfinancing  mechanisms  should  be  set  up  in  financial  institutions.  Some  of  the  poor  do  have \naccess to microcredit, which is generally unsuitable for housing finance as it is short term and \nhigh  interest.  Long-term  finance  is  needed  to  build  institutions\u2019  capacity  to  offer  long-term, \naffordable,  and  low-interest  loans.  Policy  dialogue  has  focused  on  the  need  to  develop \nmechanisms  to  supply  finance  through  formal  financial  institutions,  which  react  to  local \ncommunity-based  organization  (CBO)  initiatives,  building  on  experience  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s \nUrban  Poverty  Project,  which  supports  community  and  livelihood  development  in  poor \ncommunities,  and  the  UNDP  and  UN-Habitat  CoBILD  Project,  which  provides  microcredit  for \nhouse  improvement  and  home  and  lot  purchase  through  local  NGOs.  These  projects  have \nestablished local CBOs, which mobilize people to complement project activity. \n\n\f3 \n\nThese issues were key items of policy dialogue during project preparation, focusing on \n10. \nsystems to achieve the Government\u2019s housing policy objectives. The Government has included \ntargets  for  the  sector  in  the  national  development  strategy  and  established  four  programs  to \nimplement  them:  (i)  development  of  housing  financial  institutions,  (ii)  enhancement  of  housing \nsupply  and  renovation  (renewal)  systems,  (iii)  enhancement  of  housing  facilities  and \ninfrastructure services, and (iv) enhancement of area revitalization and preservation. The draft \nnational housing policy is consistent with the above. The policy objectives are to (i) extend the \nformal  housing  market\u2019s  ability  to  address  the  needs  of  a  wider  range  of  people  (with  specific \ninterventions  in  land,  infrastructure,  finance,  and  building  standards  and  materials,  using  a \ncommunity-focused  approach);  (ii)  build  capacity  to  organize  human  settlements;  and  (iii) \nimprove support systems for housing and human settlement development. The Government has \nalso  committed  to  implementing  its  \u201cCities  without  Slums\u201d  policy  by  2010  and  the  newly \nannounced \u201cOne Million Houses\u201d program. It is focused on one of the Millennium Development \nGoals  and  is  being  undertaken  by  DGHS  through  its  comprehensive  program  for  participatory \nslum upgrading in over 150 local governments. The Project will thus address key issues in the \nsector:  supply  of  serviced,  tenured  plots;  provision  of  appropriate  shelter  finance;  and \nstrengthening of the capacity of sector institutions. These are the building blocks of the national \nstrategy and fit within, and extend, national investment programs in the sector (Appendix 3). \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\n11. \nThe  project  goal  is  to  help  improve  living  conditions  of  the  urban  poor,  who  will \nparticipate  in,  and  benefit  from,  improved  shelter  development,  management,  and  financing \nprocesses that will increase their assets and improve their well-being. The project purpose is to \nupgrade  slums,  improve  housing,  and  provide  new  housing  for  the  urban  poor  project \nparticipants.  The  Project  will  improve  local  shelter  planning  and  provision  systems  and  the \nnational organizations servicing them, and enable financing systems to respond efficiently and \nin a sustainable manner to the needs of the urban poor. The Project is a sector project and will \nbe available to all qualifying local governments. The Project has been prepared using detailed \npilot studies in six local governments3 chosen on a competitive basis, and detailed consultations \nwith  59  more  local  governments  that  have  formally  requested  to  participate  in  the  Project. \nDescriptions of pilot subprojects are in Appendix 4. \n\nB. \n\nProject Components \n\n1. \n\nComponent  1:  Improved  Planning  and  Management  Systems  to  Upgrade \nSites and Establish New Ones for the Urban Poor \n\nThe objective is to help develop planning systems that cater to the housing needs of the \n12. \npoor  by  helping  (i)  upgrade  and  improve  poor  housing  areas  as  a  primary  component  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s stated commitment to \u201cCities Without Slums,\u201d and (ii) deliver new housing areas \nto prevent and preempt the creation of new slums and informal settlements as the city grows. \nThe component will also encourage urban development planning and budgetary allocations, and \nimplementation of pro-poor activities. \n\n                                                 \n3   Makassar, Mataram, Medan, Pekanbaru, Pontianak, and Tangerang were chosen after considering the proportion \n\nof their populations in informal settlements, and willingness to contribute resources to the Project. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nProject  activities  are  to  (i)  develop  systems  for  pro-poor  shelter  within  the  housing \n13. \ncomponent  of  the  local  Spatial  Planning  and  Shelter  Strategy  (SPSS),4  (ii)  encourage  political \ncommitment  to  these  systems,  (iii)  provide  outreach  to  undertake  participatory  planning  with \npoor  communities,  and  (iv)  strengthen  coordination  with  BPN  and  other  agencies  relevant  to \nshelter  provision  for  the  poor.  In  particular,  the  Project  will  help  develop  an  urban  land \ndevelopment program, especially for housing for the poor. These activities will take place in at \nleast  30  local  governments.  Local  civil-society  representatives,  constituting  an  \u201curban  forum,\u201d \nwill participate in planning. \n\n14. \nThe SPSS and the programming of parallel BPN titling activity will be the key elements \nof this component. Through a series of consultations, the SPSS will consolidate the information \non  land  availability;  priorities  for  development;  strategies  for  meeting  needs,  especially  of  the \npoor;  and  likely  sources  of  finance.  The  SPSS  will  prioritize  site  upgrading,  new  site \ndevelopment,  and  a  time-bound  action  plan  indicating  land  to  be  developed  for  various \npurposes.  Cooperation  of  BPN,  defined  under  its  memorandum  of  agreement  with  DGHS  as \nproviding  title  documentation  for  priority  projects,  is  crucial.  The  HDO  will  play  a  coordinating \nrole, bringing together concerned stakeholders, in particular BPN and local governments\u2019 spatial \nplanning  sections,  and  help  them  while  allowing  efficient  and  effective  city  development, \nespecially to acquire land for housing for the poor. Component 1, therefore, will contribute much \nto  orderly  ready-to-build  areas  (KASIBA),  stand-alone  ready-to-build  environments  (LISIBA), \nland consolidation,5 and housing development. \n\n2. \n\nComponent  2:  Improved  Access  to  Shelter  Finance  by  the  Poor  through \nCentral  Financial  Institutions  and  Local  Financial  Institutions  or  their \nBranches \n\n15. \nThe  objective  is  to  put  in  place  a  financing  system  that  can  be  accessed  by  the  target \ngroups  for  physical  improvements\u2014from  adding  additional  rooms  and  repairing  and  replacing \nroofs and floors, to providing and improving infrastructure and services available, to improving \ntitle  security,  including  plot  purchase.  Loans  will  be  at  market  rates  with  no  interest  rate \nsubsidies. Some 30,000 loans will be made under this component. \n\nADB  loan  proceeds  will  be  relent  to  central  financial  institutions  (CFIs)  to  establish  a \n16. \nhousing  finance  system  accessible  to  low-income  households.  CFIs  may  channel  these  funds \nthrough  local  financial  institutions  (LFIs)  to  reach  target  beneficiaries. CFIs  have  been  chosen \non  the  basis  of  capacity  to  deliver  lending  products  to  the  envisaged  beneficiaries.  Bank \nTabungan Negara (BTN) and Permodalan Nasional Madani (PNM) are initially proposed to be \nthe  CFIs.  BTN  will  use  its  extensive  local  branch  network  and/or  LFIs  and  build  on  its \nexperience  from  related  programs  to  on-lend  to  beneficiaries.  PNM  will  channel  funds  mainly \nthrough its network of people\u2019s credit banks, widely regarded as microbanks and a key player in \nmicrofinance.  CFIs  will  establish  housing  microfinance  systems,  and  LFIs  will  bear  a  share  of \nthe  loans  to  beneficiaries.  Selected  LFIs  will  undertake  a  program  of  activities:  (i)  raise \nawareness and, with DGHS support, mobilize communities and households to participate in the \nProject\u2014initially  in  the  low-income  areas  designated  by  the  SCSS,  and  later in  the  rest  of  the \ncity; (ii) form community savings-and-loan groups linked to LFIs, which will mobilize savings and \nchannel  the  loans  to  beneficiaries;  and  (iii)  provide,  administer,  and  monitor  loans,  from  Rp2 \nmillion  to  Rs10  million,  which  can  be  guaranteed  through  group  solidarity  mechanisms,  which \nwere  effective  in  the  CoBILD  project,  or  by  land  titles  secured  under  the  Project.  The  group \nsolidarity guaranty mechanisms operate through individual loans to group members, guaranteed \n                                                 \n4   Rencana  Pembangunan  dan  Pengembangan  Perumahan  dan  Permukiman  di  Daerah  (RP4D)  in  the  Indonesian \n\nlanguage. \n\n5   To enable technically and financially viable development. \n\n\f5 \n\namong group members, while the group provides an assurance to the lender. The mechanism is \na  departure  from  the  Grameen  group-lending  experience  and  traditional  individual  loans.  If \nbeneficiaries  can  afford  them,  the  loans  can  be  sequential,  used  for  incremental  purchase  of \nplots and then construction. \n\n17. \nBecause  funds  are  provided  at  market  rates,  a  sustainable  shelter  finance  system  is \nexpected  to  develop  around  CFIs,  which  can  be  expected  to  supplement  the  program  by \nproviding  additional  funds  and  resources  to  low-income  households  based  on  an  enhanced \nperception  of  their  credibility  as  borrowers.  The  capacity-building  component  will  also  ensure \nthat the documentation and reporting infrastructure to develop an asset-based securities market \nis in place. In particular, loan documentation will be standardized. \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3: Upgrading of Poor Neighborhoods and Development of New \nSites for the Poor \n\n18. \nThe  activities  of  component  1  will  help  identify,  prioritize,  and  program  the  activities  to \nupgrade  shelter  and  neighborhoods  of  the  poor.  Component  3  will  identify,  design,  and \nundertake the investments required to implement component 1. The two major subcomponents \nare  the  upgrading  of  existing  areas  and  development  of  new  areas  for  housing  for  the  poor. \nAppendix 4 describes each pilot subproject. \n\n19. \nThe component targets over 100 poor communities in at least 30 local governments, and \naims to develop at least 10 new housing areas to preempt the formation or extension of slums. \nComponent 1 will identify locations and criteria to select communities and component 2 will set \nup the mechanisms for households and communities to finance house improvements, including \nimproved  land  tenure  and  on-plot  infrastructure.  Investments  under  component  3  will  include \nstreet  lighting,  storm  drainage,  public  toilets  and  communal  sanitation  facilities  such  as  group \nseptic tanks, water mains and public taps, secondary solid waste management, and community \nfacilities.  Investments  will  be  identified  through  a  participatory  neighborhood  upgrading  plan \n(NUP) in poor communities. Savings groups involved in component 2 will be included in CBOs, \nwhich will be the community counterpart of the local government for NUPs. \n\nProposed upgrading activities include (i) fostering of NUPs in priority poor areas by local \n20. \ngovernments,  supported  by  DGHS;  (ii)  DGHS  agreements  with  local  governments  and \ncommunities  on  cost  sharing  for  investments  identified  under  the  SPSS  and  NUP,  and  on \noperation  and  maintenance  of  investments;  (iii)  provision  of  funding  for  investments;  and  (iv) \nmonitoring of investments and maintenance by DGHS. Activities for the new sites will be similar, \nexcept that a prequalification process for beneficiaries will ensure affordability. Over 25,000 new \nhousing lots are expected to be created. \n\n21. \nThe  Project  will  also  fund  investments  to  provide  links  to  city-wide  networks  of  urban \nservices  such  as  feeder  roads.  As  with  neighborhood  upgrading,  which  primarily  serves  the \nneeds of the poor, these investments will be funded through cost sharing by national and local \ngovernments.  The  scale  and  speed  of  provision  will  be  determined  by  SPSS  criteria  and \nprovisions. Component 3 could include, for example, provision of new rental public housing to \nmeet demand from the large numbers of itinerant workers, financed through matching grants. \n\n4. \n\nComponent 4: Strengthened Sector Institutions to Deliver the Program  \n\nTo  support  project  implementation  and  sector  strengthening,  DGHS  will  undertake  a \n22. \nrange  of  capacity-building  activities  to  (i)  strengthen  local  government  systems  for,  and  train \nlocal  government  officers  and  representatives,  civil-society  representatives,  and  DGHS  to \nundertake  pro-poor  SPSSs;  (ii)  strengthen  central  and  local  financial  institutions,  local \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\ngovernment, and DGHS systems, and train officers and civil-society representatives to finance \nshelter for the poor and low-income groups; (iii) strengthen local government systems, and train \nlocal  government  officers  and  representatives,  civil-society  representatives,  and  DGHS  to \nfacilitate, upgrade, and develop sites for the poor and low-income groups; and (iv) enable local \ncommunities  to  help  upgrade  shelter  and  to  establish  self-help  groups.  These  activities  will \ncomplement  ongoing  related  ADB  capacity  building  for  urban  infrastructure  management  and \ndecentralization projects. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n23. \nThe  Project  addresses  the  key  constraints  on  provision  of  affordable  shelter  to  low-\nincome  groups  and  provides  mechanisms  to  enhance  security  of  tenure  where  previous \ninitiatives  have  had  limited  success.  Component  1  facilitates  planning  of  these  initiatives. \nComponent  2 provides incremental financing for  lot purchase on affordable terms for the poor \nand through financing mechanisms linked to the formal financial system, thus bridging the gap \nbetween  these  institutions  and  the  poor.  The  Project  avoids  subsidizing  interest  rates,  relying \ninstead on targeted capital subsidies. Component 3 will physically improve slums and develop \nnew, affordable sites for the poor where supply-side policies have failed to keep pace with need. \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates  \n\nDemand  for  project  activities  has  been  investigated  in  the  six  pilot  cities,  which  were \n24. \nselected  for  their  regional  representation;  size  (metropolitan,  large,  and  medium);  and  large \nconcentrations of urban poor. The investigation results formed the basis for costing investments \nin  housing  microfinance,  neighborhood  upgrading,  and  new  site  development;  and  capacity-\nbuilding and project implementation support components. Investment size was determined from \nthe 42 participating cities\u2019 cost-sharing proposals.  \n\n25. \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $126.5  million  equivalent,  comprising  $14.6  million  in \nforeign exchange costs (including about $5.9 million in financial charges during implementation), \nand $111.9 million equivalent in local currency costs (Table 1 and Appendix 5).  \n\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\n \n\n \nComponent \nA.

The  OCR \nloan will have a 25-year term, including grace period of 6 years; an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum; and a front-end fee of 0.50%, to be capitalized in the \nloan, provided it is approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in 2003. If the loan is not approved in \n2003, the front-end fee will revert to 1%, or such other rate to be determined by ADB\u2019s Board. \nThe ADF loan will have an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter, and a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years.

About 90% of component 2 will \nbe funded through ADB\u2019s OCR loan. ADF funds will finance all capacity-building activities under \ncomponents  1  and  4.  DGHS  will  contribute  the  incremental  project  administration  and \nsupervision  costs  of  these  components.  Component  3  is  based  on  the  blended  use  of  ADB \nloans and central government\u2019s and participating cities\u2019 counterpart contributions for the cost of \nthe  subprojects.  The  Government  will  partly  subsidize  land  acquisition  costs  for  eligible \nbeneficiaries. Once a grant for site development is approved, the participating local government \nwill  first  mobilize  its  own  counterpart  contributions  for  activities  such  as  land  titling,  detailed \nengineering  design,  and  matching  funds  required  to  implement  subprojects.  Appendix  6 \npresents the project financing arrangements and fund flow. \n\n2.    Relending and On-Lending6  \n\n28. \nUnder component 2, OCR loan proceeds will be relent by the Government, through the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF), to qualified CFIs through subloans. Loans to CFIs will be on parallel \nterms to the ADB loan. CFI subloans will have a term of up to 15 years, including a maximum \ngrace period of 3 years, an interest rate that will at least cover the cost of ADB borrowing, an \n\n                                                 \n6   Relending is defined as lending from CFIs to LFIs, and on-lending as lending from LFIs to end-beneficiaries. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nadministrative fee for the Government, and foreign exchange risk cover, if applicable. CFIs will \ndisburse funds to beneficiaries through LFIs at market interest rates. The cost of CFI funds to \nLFIs will be at market rates. LFIs will, in turn, on-lend to beneficiaries at the market-lending rate. \nDepending on the region, borrower, collateral cover, and period of loan, interest rates may vary \nfrom 14% to 25% per annum. These rates are lower than the annualized interest rates paid by \nthe  beneficiaries,  ranging  from  35%  to  as  high  as  120%,  due  to  limited,  or  lack  of,  access  to \nformal shelter finance. LFI on-lending to beneficiaries will vary from 2 to 10 years. \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nDGHS  will  be  the  project  Executing  Agency.  It  will  form  the  project  steering  committee \n29. \n(PSC), chaired by the National Development Planning Board (BAPPENAS), with members from \nthe  National  Board  for  Policy  and  Supervision  of  Housing  and  Human  Settlements  and  other \nstakeholders, and permanent director-level representatives of BAPPENAS, BPN, MOF, Ministry \nof Home Affairs (MOHA), and Ministry of Settlements and Regional Infrastructure. The PSC will \nalso include representatives from CFIs and civil society. To ensure committee members\u2019 active \nparticipation,  meetings  of  the  director-level  PSC  will  be  held  at  least  quarterly,  focused  on \ndiscussions of project progress, with up-to-date reports from participating cities. These meetings \nwill approve annual budgets and semiannual progress reports. \n\n30. \nDGHS  directorates  will  serve  as  the  PSC  technical  secretariat,  and  its  services  to  the \nProject will be consistent with the central Government\u2019s role (i.e., coordinating, monitoring, and \nproviding  technical  assistance  resources  to  participating  local  governments).  The  central \nimplementing  agencies  will  be  as  follows:  (i)  component  1\u2014DGHS  Directorate  of  Technical \nDevelopment  (DTD),  with  support  from  other  DGHS  technical  directorates;  (ii)  component  2\u2014\nCFIs, with support of the DGHS Directorate of Housing Finance; (iii) component 3\u2014participating \nlocal governments, with support from regional directorates of DGHS and DTD; (iv) component \n4\u2014DTD. Representatives of these agencies will constitute the project management unit (PMU), \nto be headed by, and located within DTD. The PMU will be led by a project director with a full-\ntime project manager, at the level of section head, who will be in place for at least 2 years. The \nPMU  will  also  be  staffed  with  specialists  in  urban  planning,  housing  finance,  community \ndevelopment, and project management.  \n\n31. \nThe  PMU  will  manage  the  Project\u2019s  operational  support  consultants  (OSC).  The  PMU \nwill  coordinate  project  services,  but  a  specialist  consultant  supervised  by  PMU  and  OSC  will \nmanage  national  bidding  and  contracts.  OSC  services  will \ninclude  government  staff \ncounterparts,  and  specialists  in  project  coordination  support,  public  information,  quality \nassurance and municipal engineering, program performance monitoring and evaluation (PPME), \nand project accountancy support. The results of this output will be efficient project management \nand enhanced shelter management capacity of national agencies. \n\n32. \nIn  each  local  government,  project  implementation  will  be  coordinated  by  the  local \ncoordinating  office  (LCO).  Local  governments  will  be  flexible  as  to  the  LCOs\u2019  location  and  will \nnominate  an  LCO  full-time  staff  to  manage  the  subprojects.  LCOs  will  liaise  with  CFIs  and \ncoordinate activities of LFIs or their branches, and community groups. Existing CBOs will form \nthe basis of the NUP process, articulate community needs and aspirations, and ensure that the \ncommunity is adequately represented in decision making. Civil society will be represented in the \nLCOs\u2019 procurement activities. \n\n\f9 \n\nFinally, lending under component 2 will be supervised by a financial project management \n33. \nunit (FPMU) in each CFI. FPMUs will coordinate with LCOs to ensure that LFIs channel loans \nefficiently  and  effectively  to  qualified  project  beneficiaries.  Appendix  7  presents  the  project \norganizational chart. \n\n2. \n\nCentral Financial Institutions  \n\nBTN  is  proposed  to  be  a  CFI  for  component  2.7  A  wholly  government-owned \n34. \ndevelopment  finance  institution  established  in  1950,  and  focused  on  housing  and  property \nfinance, BTN has built up relevant capacity for shelter finance while implementing government-\nsponsored  housing  finance  projects,  including  housing  microfinance.  BTN  was  recapitalized \nafter the 1997 financial crisis and now maintains a relatively good financial standing.  \n\n35.  While  BTN\u2019s  lending  portfolio  has  remained  constrained  by  a  number  of  economic \nfactors,  its  deposit  mobilization  results  are  encouraging.  The  bank\u2019s  capital  adequacy,  asset \nquality, management, earnings, and liquidity ratios are satisfactory. To ensure financial viability \nof  BTN  lending,  and  sound  financial  management,  BTN  will  maintain  a  risk-weighted  capital \nadequacy ratio of at least 8%, in keeping with the minimum requirement of Bank Indonesia.  \n\n36. \nPNM,  a  specialized  financial  institution  to  develop  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized \ncooperatives  (MSMCs),  will  be  the  other  CFI.  PNM  runs  various  financial  activities  such  as \ncredit  programs,  financial  institutions,  and  venture-capital  institutions.  PNM  operates  credit \nschemes through a network of executing banks, provides capital shares to selected microbanks, \nand provides advice and training to MSMCs.  \n\n37.   PNM has grown rapidly, meeting a clear need to support MSMCs. Its capital adequacy, \nasset quality, earnings, and liquidity ratios are satisfactory. Financial projections conducted for \nPNM  over  2003\u20132009,  using  conservative  growth  assumptions,  indicate  a  doubling  of  total \nassets  from  Rp1,720  billion  in  2002  to  Rp3,463  billion  in  2009.  PNM  has  agreed  to  maintain \nreturn-on-asset and return-on-equity ratios of at least 1.5% and 10.0%, respectively, to ensure \nits financial viability during the Project. BTN and PNM are assessed as project CFIs in Appendix \n8.  \n\n3. \n\nSelection and Preparation of Subprojects \n\n38. \nEligibility  criteria,  selection  mechanisms,  and  subproject  preparation  and  appraisal \nprocedures  have  been  agreed  on  with  the  Government  and  CFIs.  The  first  three  subprojects \nunder  component  3,  and  first  three  subloans  appraised  by  CFIs  for  component  2,  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB for review and approval. Subsequent subprojects or subloans will not require \nADB review and approval, unless the subproject or subloan equals or exceeds $2 million. \n\na. \n\nEligibility and Selection Criteria for Local Governments  \n\n39. \nThe  PMU  will  determine  if  a  local  government  is  eligible  for  inclusion  in  the  Project, \nbased on the following criteria: (i) significant slum areas suitable for upgrading; (ii) classification \nas  a  provincial  capital,  metropolitan  city,  or  large  or  medium-sized  urban  area;  (iii)  financial \ncapacity  to  provide  matching  grants  required  for  the  Project;  (iv)  ability  to  generate  surplus \nincome  for  the  next  3  years;  (v)  documentary  evidence  of  endorsement  of  the  Local \nGovernment  Assembly  and  chief  executive;  (vi)  absence  of  adverse  findings  from  banks  and \nsuppliers; and (vii) existence of, or commitment to establishing, a housing unit (to be the basis \n\n                                                 \n7 BTN has not yet completed its due diligence review of the project financing procedures. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nof  an  HDO)  or  an  HDO.  A  preliminary  selection  will  be  made  from  the  long-list  of  42  local \ngovernments. \n\n40. \nAn area will be eligible for a subproject if it has (i) inadequate housing and services, as \nevidenced  by  the  endorsement  of  the  regional  development  planning  agency;  (ii)  nationally  or \nlocally owned government land with potential for inclusion in the subproject; (iii) interest in and \ncommitment  to  the  Project,  expressed  by  the  legal  formation  of  a  project  CBO  or,  if  already \nestablished  under  World  Bank\u2019s  UPP,  the  CBO  provides  a  document  expressing  interest  and \nwillingness to participate, endorsed by representatives of all households in the area concerned; \n(iv) a local government that can technically and administratively build institutional capacity and \nmanage subprojects; and (v) confirmation from the local government that it has the capacity and \nwillingness to contribute matching grants to the subproject. \n\nb. \n\nQualification  and  Selection  of  Central  Financial  Institutions  and \nLocal Financial Institutions \n\nThe  PMU  will  monitor  CFIs\u2019  financial  position  based  on  criteria  in  Appendix  9.  CFI \n41. \nFPMUs will determine the eligibility of participating LFIs and other lending intermediaries. LFIs \nmust  satisfy  institutional,  financial,  and  lending  performance  criteria.  LFIs  able  to  implement \nmicrocredit  programs  for  the  informal  sector,  conforming  to  ADB\u2019s  microfinance  development \nstrategy,  will  be  preferred.  CFI  project  loan  officers  will  assess  compliance  with  accreditation \nrequirements  (Appendix  9)  based  on \nfinancial \nstatements. \n\ninformation  provided, \n\nincluding  audited \n\n4. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n42. \nProject implementation is assumed to start in the first quarter of 2004 and continue for 6 \nyears. The emphasis in the first 6 months will be on (i) finalizing preliminary shelter strategies \nfor the six pilot cities, (ii) implementing NUPs in the cities, and (iii) contacting other project cities \nand preparing SPSS. \n\n43.  Work  in  the  remaining  cities  will  start  with  SPSS  development  and  will  continue  for  2 \nyears, allowing different cities to start at different times, although the identification and planning \nprocess should not last more than 3 months. Similarly, project upgrading in local governments \nother than the pilots will be spread over 3 years, from early 2005 to early 2008. New sites will be \ndeveloped  in  all  project  cities  during  the  last  3  years  of  the  Project.  The  implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 10. \n\n5. \n\nProcurement \n\nfollow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines \n\nParticipating  agencies  under  all  components  will \n\nfor \n44. \nProcurement.  In  particular,  under  component  2,  CFIs  and  LFIs  or  branches  will  follow  the \nguidelines  applicable  to  development  finance  institution  loans,  which  include  obligations  to  (i) \ndemonstrate  that  subborrowers\u2019  procurement  procedures  are  appropriate;  and  (ii)  ensure  that \ngoods  and  services  to  be  financed  by  loans  to  end-borrowers  are  purchased  at  a  reasonable \nprice,  delivered  on  time,  efficient,  reliable,  suitable  for  the  subproject,  have  maintenance \narrangements,  and,  in  the  case  of  services,  rendered  by  quality  and  competent  parties.  To \ncomply with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement, DGHS and CFI project managers and staff of \nother agencies engaged in procurement will be trained and briefed in procurement. International \ncompetitive  bidding  will  be  used  for  all  civil  works  contracts  of  over  $2  million,  and  for  supply \ncontracts of over $500,000. International shopping will be used in cases of supply contracts of \nover $100,000 and less than $500,000. In other cases, local competitive bidding procedures will \n\n\f11 \n\nbe  used,  except  as  specified  below.  To  promote  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement, staff of the PMU, FPMUs, LCOs, and other agencies involved in procurement will \nbe briefed and trained in procurement procedures. \n\nFor  small  areas,  typically  2  hectares  or  less  and  without  technical  complications,  the \n45. \npossibility of using community contracting under ADB\u2019s A Guide on Community Participation in \nProcurement  may  be  considered  if  the  local  community  is  organized  and  committed  to \ncontracting.  Where  necessary,  works  should  be  divided  into  smaller  packages  to  ensure  that \nthey  (i)  meet  the  eligibility  criteria  for  community-contracted  works  and  (ii)  pertain  to  a  clearly \ndefined community. The finance for these works may be allocated directly to the neighborhood \nadministration as a block grant or be administered by the LCO, depending on local preferences \nand  procedures.  The  PMU  will  clearly  define  procurement  processes  and  supervision \nprocedures. \n\n6. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nSpecialist  services  will  be  of  two  groups:  (i)  capacity  building  for  shelter  strategy \n46. \nformulation,  finance  management,  and  site  development;  and  (ii)  operational  support.  The \ncapacity-building  group  will  be  recruited  centrally  and  deployed \nlocal \ngovernments.  Facilitators  will  also  be  recruited  from,  and  deployed  to,  them.  Operational \nsupport consultants will be recruited centrally and deployed to support the PMU.  \n\nto  participating \n\n47. \nInternational and domestic consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod  or  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  Around  60  person-months  of  international \nconsulting,  492  person-months  of  domestic  consulting,  and  1,631  person-months  of  facilitator \nservices  will  be  needed.  Consultants  will  be  experts  in  architecture,  planning,  engineering, \ncommunity  development,  environmental  services,  economic  and  financial  analysis,  and \nmicrofinance.  An  international  procurement  services  consultant  retained  by  the  PMU  on  a \nseparate  contract  will  recruit  all  specialist  services.  The  consultant  will  process  all  progress \npayment  claims.  Use  of  \u201cperiod\u201d  or  \u201cframework\u201d  consulting  services  contracts  will  make \navailable the specified pool of specialist services to the local governments upon request. \n\n48. \nADB  will  finance  consulting  services  for  OSC\u2014about  45  person-months  international \nand 363 person-months domestic, in shelter planning and financing, microlending systems, and \ncommunity mobilization. Outline terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 11.  \n\n7. \n\nAdvance Action on Recruitment \n\n49. \nADB has approved advance consultant recruitment for project, engineering design, and \ncontract  document  management,  starting  with  pilot  subprojects.  The  Government  has  been \nadvised that such advance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project.  \n\n8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n50. \nTo expedite disbursements and improve governance in project implementation, the PMU \nwill consolidate statement-of-expense (SOE) accounts, both from consultant expenditures under \ncomponents 1 and 4, and of the local coordinating offices (LCOs) under component 3. The PMU \nwill review and certify all direct payment claims to ADB, which, in turn, will make the payments \nto the relevant consultants and LCOs. These arrangements will be detailed, reviewed, refined, \nand documented prior to any disbursement for these components.   \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nUnder component 2, each CFI will establish an imprest account. The initial deposit will \n51. \ncover the estimated ADB financing required by each CFI for the first 6 months. Replenishment \nof  these  accounts  will be  based  on  disbursement  to  LFIs  operating  in  the  target  communities. \nThe  ceiling  of  the  combined  imprest  accounts  of  the  CFIs  will  be  $1.5  million.  All  imprest \naccounts  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  on  by  the  Government  and \nADB.  ADB\u2019s  SOE  procedures  will  be  followed  in  liquidating  the  imprest  accounts  and \nreimbursing  individual  SOE  payments  up  to  $200,000  equivalent.  The  involved  agencies\u2019 \ninternal  control  systems  have  been  reviewed  and  found  to  be  capable  of  administering \npayments at this level. \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n52. \nThe  PMU,  FPMUs,  and  LCOs  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts.  The  PMU  will \nconsolidate CFI and LCO accounts quarterly. Independent auditors acceptable to ADB will audit \nthe consolidated project accounts every year. Certified copies of the audited accounts in English \nwill be submitted to ADB not later than 9 months after the end of the financial year to which they \nrelate. The independent auditors funded by the Government will also provide a separate audit \nopinion for all imprest accounts and SOEs. If the audited project account is not received within 6 \nmonths  after  the  due  date,  ADB  may  stop  replenishing  the  imprest  account  and  processing \nreimbursement requests, commitment letters, and contract awards. If the project account is not \nreceived within 12 months after the due date, ADB may suspend the loan. The PMU will submit \nto ADB quarterly reports on implementation of project-funded activities. The reports will be in a \nformat  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  include  reconciliation  of  project  expenditures  against  ADB \ndisbursements,  progress  made  against  established  targets,  problems  encountered  during  the \nquarter, steps taken and proposed, compliance with loan covenants, and project activities to be \nundertaken during the next quarter. A project completion report will be prepared within 8 months \nof project completion. All reports will be in English. \n\n10. \n\nProject Supervision and Reporting Requirements \n\n53. \nDGHS  and  the  CFIs  will  separately  submit  to  ADB  semiannual  progress  reports  on \nproject  implementation.  The  reports  will  cover  physical  performance,  summary  profiles  of \nfeasibility  studies,  summary  appraisals  of  applicant  CBOs  and  NUPs,  progress  made  in \ncomponent  2,  and  progress  made  in  the  capacity-building  program.  Within  6  months  after \nsubproject  completion,  DGHS  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a  subproject  completion  report, \nsummarizing  the  status  of  subproject  implementation  and  operational  performance  and  an \noverview of project progress. Within 8 months after the Project, DGHS and the CFIs will prepare \nand  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  summarizing  the  overall  status  of  project \nimplementation,  operational  performance,  project  performance  monitoring  system,  and  targets \nachieved. \n\n11. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nThe  Project  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  and  guidelines.  DGHS  will \n54. \nensure  the  timely  submission  of  project  accounts.  Subprojects  will  be  selected,  components \napproved,  and  goods  and  services  procured  according  to  agreed-on  guidelines  and  criteria. \nDuring  project  processing,  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  the  central  and  local \ngovernments,  CFIs,  and  participating  LFIs.  The  anticorruption  provisions  added  to  ADB\u2019s \n\n\f13 \n\nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  were  also  discussed,  and  the  section  on  fraud  and \ncorruption in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement was emphasized.8 \n\n12. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n55. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  a  comprehensive  program  for  PPME,  acceptable  to \nADB,  is  carried  out  to  (i)  examine  and  assess  the  project  technical  and  disbursement \nperformance;  (ii)  evaluate  the  delivery  of  the  planned  infrastructure,  facilities,  activities,  and \nprograms;  (iii)  assess  the  achievement  of  project  objectives;  and  (iv)  measure  the  Project\u2019s \nsocial  and  economic  benefits.  The  PPME  will  be  integrated  into  city  management  information \nsystems  to  monitor  social  and  economic  benefits  even  after  project  implementation.  Annual \nPPME reports will be prepared by each LCO, and then consolidated by the PMU and submitted \nto  ADB,  with  a  copy  for  the  implementing  agencies.  The  integrated  system  for  management, \nmonitoring, and evaluation of project benefits, social impact, and physical improvements will be \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines for the project performance management system. \n\nThe  PMU  will  also  implement  a  structured  learning  program  that  will  inform  project \n56. \npreparation  for  subsequent  shelter  projects.  Structured  learning  involves  setting  review  topics \nrelating  to  policy  and  implementation  issues  at  the  start  of  the  Project,  and  then  monitoring \nproject implementation specifically on those topics. ADB and the Government will undertake a \ncomprehensive  learning  exercise  at  the  end  of  the  second  year  when  the  first  batch  of \ninvestment proposals is completed.  \n\n13. \n\nProject Review \n\n57. \nA  midterm  review  will  take  place  about  4  years  after  loan  effectivity  to  enable  the \nGovernment,  CFIs,  and  DGHS  to  adjust  project  design  and  implementation  arrangements,  if \nneeded.  The  review  will  cover  subproject  preparation  and  implementation,  consultants\u2019 \nperformance, subprojects in the pipeline, assistance to local governments and their poor urban \ncommunities,  microfinance,  institutional  capacity  building,  and  possible  reallocation  of  loan \nproceeds. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nInstitutional Aspects \n\n1. \n\nNational Institutions \n\n58. \nThe inclusion of all key national-level shelter stakeholders on the steering committee will \nensure  that  lessons  from  the  sector  will  guide  project  activities.  DGHS\u2019s  role  as  key  national \ngovernment  implementing  agency  for  pro-poor  shelter  programs  will  be  reinforced,  as  will  the \nrole of DGHS, with BAPPENAS, in facilitating decentralization of shelter planning and provision. \nMOHA\u2019s  roles  in  overseeing  decentralization  and  promoting  community  development  are \nreinforced by the ministry\u2019s membership in the steering committee.  \n\n59. \nProject support for coordination and implementation will increase the capacity of national \nagencies to manage fund flow and specialist services to city governments. Support will include \n(i) consolidating the role of DGHS in project coordination, public information campaigns, project \naccounting  and  financial  management,  and  preliminary  evaluation  of  shelter  investment \nproposals  from  local  governments;  (ii)  strengthening  BPN\u2019s  ability  to  issue  land  titles  in  urban \n                                                 \n8   For example, in the case of inappropriate practice, only specific parties, rather than the  whole Project, should be \n\npenalized. In such cases ADB will review the practice, a bid for example, and determine appropriate redress.  \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\npoor areas; and (iii) helping new \u201cgood governance\u201d systems of procurement coordinate other \nspecialist  services  and,  especially,  give  advice  on  procurement  through  out-sourced  agencies \nand management of framework contracts. \n\n2. \n\nLocal Government and Civil Society  \n\n60. \nThe  Project\u2019s  success  in  adding  pro-poor  shelter  dimensions  to  local  government \nplanning  and  budgeting  will  rely  on  enhanced  shelter-related  institutional  arrangements.  The \nProject encourages the addition of shelter as a central activity of local government. The Project \nalso  reinforces  the  role  of  local  urban  forums  that  will  work  with  the  LCO,  enhancing \naccountability and transparency at the local level. If the local government does not establish an \nurban  forum,  the  Project  will  facilitate  its  formation  under  component  4.  A  stronger  local \ngovernment  shelter  institution  is  required,  and  component  4  promotes  the  establishment  of \nHDOs  to  institutionalize  a  comprehensive  approach  to  shelter  planning  and  a  pro-poor \norientation for it.  \n\nThe  Project  will  help  consolidate  the  roles  of  the  various  stakeholders  by  providing \n61. \nhands-on  training  and  specialist  service  advice  as  shelter  strategies  are  prepared  and \nimplemented  in  the  local  government  annual  planning  and  budgeting  system.  The  Project \npromotes  coordination  among  key  local  stakeholders,  in  particular  the  city  planning  office  and \nlocal  BPN  office,  by  supporting  the  local  government  housing  and  settlements  board.  The \nProject  will  encourage  the  establishment  and  consolidation  of  neighborhood  and  community \norganizations,  and  provide  recommended  participatory  processes  and  training  and  specialist \nservice  support.  The  Project\u2019s  inclusive  shelter-planning  intervention  will  result  in  short-term \nplans  and  budgets  reflecting  priorities  of  the  poor,  and  of  city  governments  with  competent \npersonnel,  technology,  facilities,  and  programs  to  ensure  that  shelter  planning  and  budgeting \nremain inclusive. \n\n3. \n\nLocal Participating Financial Institutions \n\n62. \nThe  introduction  of  small  revolving  loans  for  housing  through  LFIs  will  not  only  extend \nthe range of services available to low-income people, but capacity building for these institutions \nwill  also  enhance  their  understanding  of  financial  mechanisms  and  operations,  and,  through \ncommunity involvement, of communities\u2019 social needs. The establishment of community savings \ngroups  will  encourage  more  households  to  save  beyond  project-related  loans.  With  good \nmanagement  and  support,  a  financial  institution  will  be  able  to  establish  a  virtuous  cycle  to \nexpand  financial  services,  starting  with  the  poor  and  then  gradually  among  middle-income \ngroups. \n\nB. \n\nPoverty and Social Aspects \n\n63. \nIn general, better access to urban infrastructure and services improves living conditions. \nSpecifically,  road  improvement  provides  safer,  faster,  and  better  accessibility  to  and  from \npeople\u2019s homes. Better street lighting can deter petty crime, violence, and clandestine activities, \ndirectly  benefiting  women  and  children.  Better  drainage  reduces  flooding  and,  therefore, \nwaterborne  diseases,  destruction  of  property,  and  accidents;  and  prevents  groundwater \ncontamination.  The  central  issue  for  the  Project  is  that  each  community  will  have  different \npriorities, and the NUP is designed to enable the community to plan investments.  \n\n64. \nAn  important  project  impact  is  job  creation  for  residents  of  project  communities  and \nthose living nearby, increasing income, although temporarily, particularly of the unemployed or \nunderemployed,  and  thus  increasing  capability  to  spend  for  basic  needs  such  as  food, \n\n\f15 \n\neducation,  and  health.  Increased  income  will  especially  benefit  the  poorest.  Indirectly,  women \nmay  benefit  from  jobs  through  the  increase  in  demand  for  goods  and  services,  which  women \ncan provide through microenterprises such as food stalls, barber shops, and room rentals. \n\nHousing  improvement  will  involve  setting  up  a  credit  facility  for  target  beneficiaries. \n65. \nPhysical  improvements  can  include  adding  rooms,  including  toilets  and  baths;  repairing  and \nreplacing  components;  improving  facilities  (toilet,  kitchen,  garden);  and  even  purchasing  the \nhouse and/or lot. Extra space may be rented out.  \n\n66. \nInvolving  women  in  house  design  will  lessen  their  domestic  work.  Home-based \nenterprises  and  income-generating  activities  particularly  empower  women.  Indirectly,  housing \nimprovement creates jobs for local people and outsiders. The pilot or subsequent subprojects, \nwhich target cities, will not affect indigenous peoples. In the remote eventuality that an affected \ncommunity may have a significant indigenous population, community-driven planning will ensure \nthat  ADB\u2019s  policy  is  applied,  also  minimizing,  if  not  eliminating,  the  need  to  acquire  land  and, \nthus, to employ ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy safeguards. Social and poverty issues are \nin Appendix 12, and the summary resettlement framework in Appendix 13. \n\n67. \nThe  community  organizations  and/or  associations  will  greatly  benefit  from  the  Project, \nwhich  will  improve  CBOs\u2019  skills,  knowledge,  and  tools  to  manage  and  maintain  community \ndevelopment interventions. These will establish a sense of ownership and responsibility, which \nwill  reinforce  the  sustainability  of  project  interventions.  Meeting  community  organizations\u2019/ \nassociations\u2019 organizational, management, and advocacy needs will strengthen social cohesion, \nincreasing community cooperation and coordination. Component 4 will also emphasize involving \nthe poor and women\u2019s groups. \n\nC. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\nThe Project will have mostly beneficial environmental effects, and adverse effects can be \n68. \nmitigated.  Initial  environmental  examinations  were  prepared  for  the  six  pilot  sites.  All  pilot \nsubprojects,  and  the  Project  as  a  whole,  will  have  a  minor  environmental  impact  during \nconstruction.  Civil  works  are  not  substantial  in  scale  or  cost,  and  mostly  involve  on-site \nimprovement  of  drainage,  roads,  footpath  networks,  and  water  distribution  systems.  Mitigation \nmeasures  will  include  ensuring  that  construction  workers  are  briefed  on  how  to  minimize \nnuisance,  and  carefully  planning  excavations  and  other  construction  activities  to  avoid \ndamaging utilities. At most, negative environmental impact will be interference with other utilities \nor  temporary  increase  of  solid  waste,  sewage,  dust,  or  noise  during  construction.  Mitigation \nmeasures  will  include  documentation  of  works  and  utilities  undertaken,  which  will  be  done  by \nthe CBO to inform future construction activities; careful design of septic tanks and drainage to \navoid flooding and standing water; and community education on site cleaning and maintenance \nof  infrastructure  provided,  including  septic  tanks.  Recommended  mitigation  measures  are \nsimple and easy to integrate into the project feasibility study and detailed engineering phases of \nsubproject  development.  The  Project  will  improve  access,  proper  handling,  and  disposal  of \ndomestic wastewater; prevent flood damage; and provide potable water. \n\n69. \nAs  the  Project  is  a  sector  project,  site  selection  criteria  will  include  residential  safety, \nwhich  will  have  to  be  supported  by  adequate  environmental  assessment.  DGHS,  assisted  by \nproject  capacity-building  components,  will  ensure \nthat  assessment  and  monitoring \narrangements are in place. Protection and mitigation measures must be recommended and the \nconditions met for their implementation before ADB approves any site development subproject. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nAs the Project involves only small-scale works, none of the pilot subprojects required full \n70. \nenvironmental impact assessment under Indonesian regulations, or are classified by ADB under \ncategory A. Almost all subprojects will only require basic-level assessment under the Indonesian \nenvironmental regulations and fall under ADB category B. The Project\u2019s environmental impacts \nare summarized in Appendix 14. \n\nD. \n\nEconomic and Financial Aspects \n\nThe major indicators of the subprojects\u2019 economic viability are summarized in Appendix \n71. \n15.  Base-case  subproject  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  were  15.0\u201344.8%, \nexceeding  the  12.0%  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital,  and  confirming  the  subprojects\u2019 \neconomic  robustness.  Sensitivity  analysis  conducted  on  parameters\u201410%  increase  in  costs, \n10% decrease in benefits, or both, and delayed benefits\u2014showed that EIRRs are vulnerable to \nchanges in anticipated subproject benefits, a risk that needs to be managed by capacity building \nunder component 4.  \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  poverty \n\nfrom \n72. \nrepresentative  suprojects,  is  52%,  which  is  significantly  higher  than  the  income  share  of  the \nurban  poor  as  estimated  by  ADB  and  confirms  the  Project\u2019s  pro-poor  impact.  The  poverty \nimpact analysis is also summarized in Appendix 15. \n\nimpact  ratio,  based  on  direct  economic  benefits \n\n73. \nThe  financial  capability  of  the  local governments,  which  will  serve  as  the  implementing \nagencies  for  the  Project\u2019s  site  development  component,  were  evaluated  on  the  basis  of  their \nfinancial statements and revenue and expenditure forecasts. Cash-flow projections indicate that \nall  six  local  governments  have  the  capacity  to  borrow  for  project  investments.  Financial \nsoundness  is  a  criteria  to  select  participating  local  governments.  The  financial  analysis  of \nrepresentative  LFIs  ascertained  their  ability  to  relend  to  project  beneficiaries  and  repay  their \nproposed subloans under component 2.  \n\n74. \nFinancial  internal  rates  of  return  (FIRRs)  and  financial  sustainability  projections  were \nprepared for the housing loans. FIRRs were not calculated for the site development subprojects \nbecause they have significant subsidy elements. The local governments will eventually recover \nproject subsidies through property taxes. \n\n75. \nProject  sustainability  is  underpinned  by  ensuring  that  all  institutional  stakeholders  can \nrecover  costs  and  that  beneficiaries  are  the  recipients  of  targeted  subsidies.  Thus,  local \ngovernments  will  recover  infrastructure  costs  through  land  taxes,  and  financial  institutions  will \ncharge  an  appropriate  spread  linked  to  their  risk  and  costs.  Subsidies  are  one-time  capital \nsubsidies for land costs. \n\nE. \n\nRisks \n\n76. \nThe  project  design  assumes  that  the  Government  will  remain  fully  committed  to \ndecentralization  and  poverty  reduction,  which  is  highly  likely.  Government  advice  on  the \ndevelopment  priorities  of  the  next  medium-term  national  development  plan  confirms  that \ndecentralization  and  poverty  reduction  through  economic  recovery  will  be  core  features  of \nnational  development  policy.  However,  progress  and  stability  in  macroeconomic  management \nduring the 6-year Project is necessary to ensure access to long-term investment funds and the \nability to implement national development policy imperatives. \n\n77. \nThe Project assumes that enough city governments will be attracted to participate in the \nProject by the grants and subsidized specialist service mix provided by the central Government \n\n\f17 \n\nunder  component  4.  Other  cities\u2019  readiness  to  participate  will  also  be  assessed  if  alternatives \nare necessary.  \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIndonesia  and  DGHS  have  given  the  following  specific  assurances,  in  addition  to  the \n\n78. \nstandard assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nIndonesia  will  make  all  administrative  arrangements  for  implementation  and \nensure  that  counterpart  resources  are  provided  on  time.  The  Government, \nincluding  CFIs,  will  thus  do  everything  to  promptly  disburse  funds  to  qualified \nborrowers. \n\nIndonesia  will  ensure  that  DGHS  administers  the  capacity-building  assistance \nwith due diligence and transparently. \n\nIndonesia will not consider any subproject that requires significant resettlement. \nIn  any  event,  the  PMU  will,  before  approving  subprojects,  screen  them  for \ninvoluntary resettlement effects, to ensure that no loss of land, income, housing, \ncommunity  facilities,  and  resources  occurs  that  will  require  compensation  to  be \npaid \ninvoluntary  resettlement.  Any \ninvoluntary  resettlement  arising  from  project  land  acquisition  should  conform  to \nADB  policy  and  procedures  and  to  the  neighborhood  upgrading  plan  and \nresettlement framework. \n\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \n\nIndonesia  will  ensure  that  the  Project  follows  the  country\u2019s  environmental  rules \nand regulations and ADB\u2019s environmental assessment guidelines. \n\nIndonesia will ensure that all land required for a subproject has title suitable for \nupgrading the land or developing new sites. \n\nDGHS  will  ensure  that,  before  a  subproject  is  approved,  (a)  a  local  CBO  is \nestablished  and  staffed,  (b)  an  adequate  neighborhood  upgrading  plan  is \nprepared,  (c)  all  beneficiaries  voluntarily  agree  on  the  plan,  and  (d)  the \nparticipating  local  government  agrees  in  writing  that  a  specified  CBO  will \nrepresent the subproject community. \n\nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n79. \n\nThe Loan Agreements will take effect subject to the following conditions: \n\n(i) \n\nThe  execution  and  delivery  of  the  Subsidiary  Loan  Agreement  and  the \nImplementation Agreement, on behalf of PNM, will have been duly authorized or \nratified by all necessary corporate, administrative, and governmental action. \n\n(ii) \n\nPilot-city LCOs are established and staffed. \n\n(iii) \n\nThe PSC is established. \n\n \n\n\fC. \n\nConditions for Disbursement \n\n80.  Withdrawals from the Loan Account will commence subject to the following condition: \n\n(i) \n\nAdministrative  arrangements  for  disbursement  of  components  1,  3,  and  4,  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (January  2001),  as \namended  from  time  to  time,  will  have  been  agreed  between  the  Borrower  and \nADB. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n81. \nthe ADB and recommend that the Board approve  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  of  $68,600,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Neighborhood \nUpgrading and Shelter Sector Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility;

The  World  Bank  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  cofinanced  the  first \nIUIDP in 1987. After this, they funded geographically separate IUIDPs. The last of the these will \nfinish in 2003. \n \n2. \nIUIDP, while providing needed urban infrastructure in its time, is generally considered to \nbe  an  inappropriate  vehicle  for  urban  investment  in  the  new  era  of  economic  recovery  and \nreform  (including  decentralization)  as  the  program  was  centrally  driven  and  funded  with  often \nminimal  support  from  local  governments.  Initially,  the  Government  and  funding  agencies \nfocused  on  immediate  poverty  reduction  projects  and  programs  to  meet  the  challenge  of  the \neconomic  crisis.  Government  and  donors  have  reviewed  sector  programs  and  focused  on \neconomic  recovery  and  consolidation  of  governance  reforms,  including  decentralization. \nRethinking  approaches  to  the  urban  and  shelter  sectors  continue  as  evidenced  in  the  recent \npublication  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Indonesia  Urban  Sector  Review\u2014World  Bank\u2019s  Urban  Sector \nOperational  Strategy  in  an  Era  of  Decentralization,  and  the  continuing  refinement  of  sector \napproaches1 in ADB\u2019s country strategies and programs.  \n \n3. \nBilateral  support  typically  focuses  on  supporting  decentralization,  including  the  United \nStates  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)-assisted  regional  management  and \nurban  development  activities.  The  Government  of  the  Netherlands  finances  community-based \ninitiatives  of  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  and  the  United  Nations \nCentre for Human Settlement (UNCHS), which also target the urban poor. The Government of \nthe  Netherlands  also  substantially  funds  ongoing  decentralization.  The  Department  for \nInternational Development (DFID) of the Government of the United Kingdom also contributes to \npoverty  reduction  projects  and,  in  particular,  has  substantially  funded  ADB\u2019s  poverty-focused \ntechnical assistance projects. \n \n4. \nThe financial crisis and decentralization have combined to create problems for delivery \nof donor support to the sectors, as well as the need to deliver different kinds of support. In the \ncourse of the project preparatory technical assistance, a substantial step forward was taken with \nthe  issuance  of  a  Ministry  of  Finance  decree,  which  clarifies  procedures  and  rules  for  local \ngovernment  borrowing  from  foreign  sources.  To  be  operational,  however,  the  decree  needs \n(and is receiving) government and donor attention.2  \n \n5. \nADB and ADB projects, are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n \n\nThe lists of relevant, externally supported projects, including recent and proposed non-\n\n                                                 \n1   See,  for  example,  Culpin  Planning  Ltd.  2003.

The  population  of \nIndonesia reached 203.4 million in 2000, compared to 119.2 million in 1971. Although Indonesia \nhas dramatically reduced overall population growth rate (from 2.32% in 1971\u20131980 to 1.61% in \n1980\u20131999), the urban population continues to grow at about 4.6% per year (1990\u20132000). The \npercentage  of  the  population  living  in  urban  areas  was  estimated  at  42.5%  in  2000,  and  is \nprojected  to  surpass  50.0%  by  2010  and  60.0%  by  2025.  Urban  population  growth  in  1990\u2013\n2000 has been predominantly outside city boundaries. Average annual urban population growth \nrate  in  1990\u20132000  inside  city  boundaries  has  been  2.11%,  and  outside  city  boundaries  (but \nclassified  as  urban),  7.07%.  To  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  achieve  \u201cCities  Without \nSlums\u201d  commitments,  the  project  design  has  focused  on  the  needs  of  the  urban  population \nwithin  city  boundaries.  As  experience  with  the  Project  is  consolidated,  however,  greater \nattention will need to be placed on the peri-urban areas outside city boundaries. \n \n2. \nDespite  heavy  investments  in  environmental  infrastructure,  conditions  in  poor  urban \nareas  continue  to  deteriorate  and  are  aggravated  by  the  impact  of  the  1997  economic  crisis. \nAbout  36%  of  the  urban  population  is  estimated  to  have  access  to  piped  water.  Although  a \nsignificant improvement since 1980, it is far below requirements when compared to the increase \nin  the  urban  population  without  piped  water\u2014from  24  million  to  42  million  during  the  last \ndecade. Only seven cities have installed sewerage systems, and less than 10% of these cities\u2019 \npopulation is connected to a system. Although access to toilet facilities is increasing, frequently \nthese facilities do not provide for safe treatment of human waste. Septic tanks are often poorly \ndesigned,  built,  and  maintained,  and  drainage  systems  are  often  blocked  or  nonexistent.  Key \nissues  in  solid  waste  collection  and  disposal  include  the  weak  capacity  of  local  agencies.  In \nurban  areas,  on  average  only  about  50\u201360%  of  waste  produced  is  collected  by  a  municipal \nservice. \n \nLand  administration  leaves  much  to  be  desired.  The  National  Land  Agency  is \n3. \nresponsible for land administration of only 30% of the national land surface, and less than 10% \nof  the  country  is  covered  by  cadastral  maps.  The  number  of  informal  (unregistered)  land \ntransactions  is  huge.  Over  two  thirds  of  land  registrations  are  improperly  documented.  The \nsharing  of  data  between  institutions  dealing  with  land  issues  is  fragmented  and  limited. \nHorizontal and vertical communication is poor and a clear law and policy on land information are \nlacking. \n \nFew initiatives have been undertaken to increase supply of affordable housing lots. The \n4. \nmost promising in many respects are the ready-to-build area (KASIBA); stand-alone, ready-to-\nbuild  environment  (LISIBA);  and  land  consolidation.  Typically,  the  regional  development \nplanning agency (BAPPEDA) leads the task force. The local government designates part of the \ncity as a KASIBA project area, and passes this designation as local law, including in it a KASIBA \nmanagement board, which is, in principle, a local public enterprise. It assumes the responsibility \nto  plan,  implement,  and  manage  KASIBA  development,  and  to  acquire  the  land  within  the \nproject area but not to exercise any special powers of compulsory acquisition (eminent domain). \nThe  management  board  can  then  \u201ctender\u201d  process  to  small-site  LISIBA  developers,  and  is \nresponsible building infrastructure in cooperation with local public enterprises and governments. \nThe  general  schema  for  infrastructure  finance  is  assumed  to  be  that  of  primary  infrastructure \n(e.g.,  national,  provincial  roads,  water  supply,  etc.)  and  will  be  financed  by  central  and  local \ngovernments.  All  infrastructure  within  LISIBAs  will  be  financed  by  their  developers.  Normal \nprinciples  of  cost  recovery  apply  to  the  management  authority.  However,  few  KASIBA \nmanagement  boards  exist.  The  KASIBA-LISIBA  boards  that  have  been  formed  are  not  yet \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n25 \n\nthe  pilot  cities, \n\nimportant  physical \n\nFrom  experience  with \n\nfeatures  are  missing.  This \n\ncapable  of  managing  the  program,  especially  in  land  acquisition,  marketing,  and  property \nmanagement.  They  are  also  not  yet  professional  in  financing  property  management  (e.g., \nDriyorejo of Medan and Surabaya) as most managers and staff do not have enough experience \nin real-estate development. \n \n5. \nWhile  housing  finance  has  received  considerable  attention  as  the  main  instrument  to \nincrease and improve access to housing, the policy response has often neglected the interests \nof  the  poor.  Subsidies will  not  reach  the  poor if  the  conditions  (land title,  30%  down  payment, \nverifiable income) for access exclude the poor, especially the self- and informally employed. Not \nsurprisingly, 80% of housing has not used any formal housing finance. Even the  directives on \nhousing  finance  with  subsidized  interest  and  down  payment  are  unlikely  to  reach  many \nhouseholds  below  the  50th  percentile.  Nevertheless,  the  poor  manage  their  housing  with \nunsubsidized  credit  at  rates  above  40%  (and  double  that  in  2001\u20132002)  from  materials\u2019 \nsuppliers  and  microfinance  lenders  from  the  formal  and  informal  sectors.  The  only  scheme  to \nprovide  appropriate  housing  finance  for  the  poor  has  been  Community-Based  Initiatives  for \nHousing  and  Local  Development  (CoBILD),  although  other microfinance  programs  allow  loans \nto be used for housing. By and large, demand for housing finance for the poor goes unmet, at \nleast by the formal sector. \n \n6. \ninformation  on  slum  areas  seriously \nunderestimates  the  extent  of  the  problem.  The  sizes  of  slum,  squatter,  and  village  areas  (and \ntheir estimated populations) often err by a factor of 2\u20134, and many such areas are completely \nmissing from city development plans\u2019 official inventories. Maps are out of date and inaccurate, \nand \ninformation  deficiency  makes  a \ncomprehensive  and  prioritized  approach  to  urban  upgrading  and  shelter  strategies  (including \nidentification of sites with good potential for new affordable housing developments) very difficult. \n \n7. \nAreas  that  require  upgrading  have  been  inventoried,  and  while  these  inventories \nconservatively  estimate  demand,  they  have  been  used  to  estimate  overall  demand.  Some \n14,000 hectares (ha) require upgrading now; 17,000 ha will need upgrading in 2010, which will \ncost about $273 million and benefit some 7 million residents. A similar estimate has been made \nfor  urban  areas  outside  city  boundaries  (predominantly  in  peri-urban  areas),  but  with  different \ngrowth-rate  and  density  assumptions.  The  resulting  estimate  of  demand  is  that  18,714  ha \nrequire upgrading now; over 37,069 ha will need upgrading in 2010, which will cost about $575 \nmillion and benefit some 14 million residents. Also based on pilot-city experience, demand for \nnew  site  development  has  been  estimated,  and  some  10,000  ha  are  required  over  10  years, \nwhich will cost some $310 million and directly benefit some 14 million people. \n \n8. \nDemand for housing finance has been derived on the basis of observations in the pilot \ncities and, particularly, the pilot areas. Some 70\u201380% of the poor households own their housing, \neven though their title to the land is often difficult to substantiate. If the overall conditions of their \nsettlements,  particularly  in  terms  of  access,  infrastructure,  and  most  importantly,  the  right  to \nsettlement were upgraded and improved, as is the intention of the Project through the system of \nmatching grants, the preference of most households would be to improve and build upon their \ncurrent housing investment and social capital rather than to build a new house or to move to a \nnew  location  and  build  there.  The  demand  for  new  housing  is  likely  to  come  from  a  small \nproportion of existing tenants, and from the 1.6% or so new households formed annually as a \nresult of natural rate of population growth, plus the pent-up demand among existing households. \nAll in all, though, from experience on the CoBILD project and in the subproject sites, demand for \nnew housing is likely to be less than 10%, and the rest is more likely to be for housing upgrading \nand  improvement  of  living  conditions.  Sample  surveys  suggest  that  as  many  as  80%  of  the \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nhouses need some repair, addition, or modification\u2014including infrastructure connections\u2014and \nthat  some  30%  have  carried  out  some  repair  or  modification  recently.  CoBILD  and  subproject \nexperience  suggests  that  at  least  10%  of  these  households  will  borrow,  implying  about  4,000 \nloans a year for a city of 1 million people. Loan size, based on observed conditions and typical \ncosts  of  repairs  and  modifications,  would  range  from  Rp1  million  to  Rp3  million.  Loans  to \nimprove  land  title  may  be  as  big  as  Rp5  million.  These  loans,  at  the  market  rate  of  interest, \ncould be affordable to the poor over 2 and 5 years, respectively. \n \nThe  Government  has  included  specific  sector  targets  in  the  national  development \n9. \nstrategy  and  established  four  programs  to  implement  these  strategies:  (i)  development  of \nhousing financial institutions, (ii) enhancement of the housing supply and renovation (renewal) \nsystems,  (iii)  enhancement  of  the  housing  facilities  and  infrastructure  services,  and  (iv) \nenhancement  of  the  area  revitalization  and  preservation.  The  Government\u2019s  draft  national \nhousing policy is consistent with the above. The policy has clear objectives: (i) extend the ability \nof the formal housing market to address the needs of a wider range of people, with interventions \nin  land,  infrastructure,  finance,  and  building  standards  and  materials  within  a  community-\nfocused  approach;  (ii)  build  capacity  of  human  settlement  organizations;  and  (iii)  improve \nsupport  systems  for  housing  and  human  settlement  development.  The  Government  has  also \ncommitted  to  implement  \u201cCities  without  Slums\u201d  by  2010.  This  program  is  focused  on  a \nMillennium Development Goal and is being implemented by the Directorate General of Human \nSettlements through its comprehensive program for slum upgrading being implemented in over \n60  communities.  The  Project  will  thus  address  key  issues  in  the  sector:  supply  of  serviced, \ntenured plots; provision of appropriate shelter finance; and strengthening the capacity of sector \ninstitutions. Supplementary Appendix B presents an analysis of the sector institutions, as well as \na policy action plan discussed and agreed on with the Government. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \nA. \n\nMakassar  \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n27 \n\nSUBPROJECT DESCRIPTIONS \n\nMakassar (South Sulawesi, eastern Indonesia; population, 1.1 million) is generally low-\n1. \nlying and flat, and most of it water table is within 2 meters of the surface. The largest slum areas \nare north, east, and south of the city center, and can be categorized into (i) coastal and riverside \ncommunities\u2014houses on stilts above the water, with the area beneath gradually filling in, partly \nby  natural  accretion  and  accumulation  of  solid  waste;  (ii)  urban  slums  and  villages,  which,  in \nsome  areas,  merge  into  the  coastal  and  riverside  communities;  and  (iii)  new  informal \ndevelopments in formerly rural areas, most small. Field surveys suggest that the informal slums \nin Makassar cover over 500 hectares (ha). The Project\u2019s first phase will focus on upgrading 192 \nha of slums, and 206 ha more in the following phase, with priority areas identified through the \nshelter  planning  system  enhanced  by  the  Project\u2019s  capacity  building.  Some  150,000  slum \ndwellers will participate and benefit. Beneficiaries will include those living on around 65% of the \ncity\u2019s  land  area  that  is  low-lying  and/or  has  been  reclaimed  from  either  the  sea  or  marshes. \nSlopes  rarely  exceed  1%  and  many  areas  are  subject  to  flooding  during  heavy  and/or \ncontinuous  rain,  particularly  at  high  tide.  Around  50,000  people,  many  of  whom  live  in  low-\nincome areas, suffer from flooding. Many houses are built on stilts.  \n\nImprovements will benefit 60% of the population of priority areas that do not have access \n2. \nto  sanitary  disposal  of  toilet  wastes.  In  seafront  communities,  some  people  use  crude  toilets \nconsisting  of  nothing  more  than  a  partly  enclosed  bamboo  frame  projecting  out  over  the  sea. \nSome  higher-income  households  on-site  pour-flush  latrines  connected  to  leach  pits.  In \nCambaya,  people,  if  they  have  any  sanitation  at  all,  use  crude  latrines  overhanging  the  sea. \nFurther  inland,  some  households  have  individual  sanitation  facilities,  which  discharge  to  leach \npits,  although  residents  report  that  these  systems  can  overflow,  partly  due  to  the  high  water \ntable, although failure to empty full pits may be a bigger factor. Solid waste management will be \nimproved, reversing recent changes in collection arrangements that have drastically reduced the \nfunding available for local solid waste collection services. In parts of Marisso and Cambaya built \nover the sea, garbage is routinely dumped in the water below and around houses, producing a \nstagnant and unhealthy mix of waste, mud, and polluted water. Away from the sea, waste from \nboth  these  settlements  is  deposited  in  open  land,  whether  vacant  lots  or,  as  in  one  area  in \nCambaya, a length of drain that is no longer used.  \n\n3. \nComplementing and reinforcing the impact of upgrading investments, a 27.1 ha new site \nwill  be  developed,  benefiting  5,000  poor  households;  4,000  shelter  improvement  loans  and \n3,000 starter home loans will be made available to them.  \n\nB. \n\nTangerang  \n\n4. \nTangerang  (West  Java;  population,  1.35  million)  is  about  27  kilometers  (km)  west  of \nJakarta and immediately south of Jakarta\u2019s international airport. Some 79,000 poor households \nlive in Tangerang, 5,300 of which are very poor. Poor households are found throughout the city, \ntypically  comprising  20\u201340%  of  the  total  number  of  households  in  any  given  neighborhood. \nMany  of  the  poor  live  in  informal  or  slum  settlements,  74  of  which  have  been  identified  in \nTangerang. About 102 ha of priority upgrading areas have been identified, and 401 ha will be \nupgraded through the Project\u2019s support, with some 160,000 beneficiaries. The settlements to be \nupgraded  do  not  necessarily  share  the  same  characteristics.  Some  slum  areas  house  high \nnumbers of migrants or temporary settlers, who have come to the city to seek work as laborers \nor factory workers in nearby industrial areas. In such areas, erstwhile agricultural land has been \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\ndeveloped by landowners to provide high-density rental accommodation, which is sometimes in \nbad  condition,  lacks  basic  infrastructure  and  facilities,  and is  poorly  maintained  by  the  owners \nand occupiers.  \n\nThe  other  type  of  slum  area  to  be  upgraded  is  owner  occupied,  with  most  residents \n5. \nemployed in the informal sector as street vendors, mobile food sellers, or pedicab and/or tricycle \ndrivers.  The  neighborhood  may  be  crowded  and  lacking  basic  infrastructure  and  facilities, \nalthough  some  fringe  settlements  are  less  dense.  Low,  unreliable  incomes  mean  that \ninfrastructure \ncommunity  members  have \nimprovements. They will be recipients of the 4,000 improvement loans.  \n\nfinance  neighborhood \n\nlimited  capacity \n\nto \n\n6. \nTwo areas in Tangerang have sewers: the central area east of the Cisadane River and \nKarawaci  area  in  the  south.  Most  low-income  areas  are  served  by  on-plot  sanitation  systems, \nwhich discharge toilet wastes into leach pits. Only about 72% of the solid waste generated in the \ncity is collected. The situation is worse in the priority areas, where secondary collection services \nare at best irregular and at worst nonexistent. Tangerang is generally low-lying, with elevations \nin the range of 0\u201330 meters above sea level, but generally at the lower end. This, together with \nannual rainfall of 1,500\u20132,000 millimeters per year, creates a need for a strategic approach to \nflood management. Areas close to the Cisadane River have special problems caused by flood \nflows from the inland, and the sea tides. In 1996 the drainage system covered about 7,300 ha \n(88%  of  the  developed  area).  Areas  subject  to  flooding  amounted  to  180.5  ha  (3%  of  the \ndeveloped area). These were spread throughout Tangerang, but mostly close to the river. \n\n7. \nComplementing and reinforcing the impact of the upgrading investments, a 27.3 ha new \nsite  will  be  developed,  benefiting  some  5,400  poor  households.  Besides  the  shelter \nimprovement loans, 3,000 starter home loans will be made available to poor households.  \n\nC. \n\nPekanbaru  \n\n8. \nPekanbaru  is  the  capital  of  Riau  Province,  central  Sumatra  (population,  610,000).  The \nmain built-up area continues to be on the south bank of the Siak River. In 2001 almost 19% of \nthe total population were below the official poverty line, with about 40% vulnerable to poverty. \nPoor  households  are spread  throughout  Pekanbaru,  with the  highest concentrations  along  the \nbanks of the Siak and around the city center. The population could become even denser. Some \n61  ha  have  been  prioritized  for  upgrading,  with  200  ha  more  to  be  upgraded  in  the  second \nphase  and  identified  through  the  enhanced  shelter  planning  process,  benefiting  26,000  poor \nhouseholds.  High  demand  for  affordable  housing  is  also  likely  to  lead  to  the  extension  of \ninformal  development  along  the  banks  of  the  Siak  unless  housing  schemes  are  developed  for \nthe  poor.  Some  17.7  ha  of  new  site  development  will  be  encouraged,  benefiting  3,500  poor \nhouseholds. \n\n9. \nIn areas without sewerage, wastewater from toilets is normally discharged into either a \nhousehold  septic  tank  or  latrine.  In  priority  areas,  about  70%  of  households  have  access  to \nprivate toilets while about 30%, many of whom are renters, use a public facility. In some cases, \nhousehold  latrines  discharged  into  drains,  which  discharged  directly  into  drainage  canals. \nComplementing  and  reinforcing  the  impact  of  the  upgrading  and  new  site  investments, \napproximately  2,600  shelter  improvement  loans  and  2,000  starter  home  loans  will  be  made \navailable to poor households.  \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n29 \n\nD. \n\nMataram  \n\n10.  Mataram  is  the  capital  of  Nusa  Tenggara  Barat  Province  (population,  310,000).  Some \n36%  of  poor  households  fall  into  the  poorest  categories  and  live  in  informal  areas,  including \nvillages,  unregulated  housing  developments,  and  squatter  settlements.  Indeed,  all  three \nsubdistricts (kecamatan) in the city contain slum and squatter areas. About 16% of houses are \nclassified  as  being  in  poor  condition.  Poor  housing  is  found  in  all  areas  in  Mataram;  59%  of \nhouseholds have access to their own toilet facilities, most disposing waste into individual septic \ntanks, many of which are close to wells. The only sewerage is a pilot project in Ampenan Utara, \nwhich  will  eventually  serve  4,000  houses.  Factory  wastes,  particularly  those  from  bean  curd \nproduction in residential areas, are also a problem.  \n\n11.  Mataram Kota has introduced a shared approach to solid waste management, involving \npeoples\u2019 representatives and nongovernment organizations, in deciding the type of system to be \nadopted.  Around  60%  of  total  solid  waste  is  delivered  to  the  designated  disposal  site.  Each \nhousehold has waste disposal bags, which are collected by carts and dumped at a temporary \nstorage point. The primary drainage system is provided by the four rivers. Secondary drainage \nis provided by a total of 31.8 km of lined channels. The system also includes 37.7 km more of \nunlined secondary and tertiary channels. The city has 17 areas of standing water covering 22.25 \nha.  Flooding  occurs  mainly  on  the  banks  of  the  Ancar,  Brenyoi,  Jangkok,  and  Medang,  which \nare affected by sea tides and high flood flows from the river. Regular flooding occurs on 150 ha \nand affects around 18,000 people, including many poor.  \n\n12. \nTo address these problems, about 80 ha have been identified for high-priority upgrading. \nA  total  of  almost  130  ha  will  be  covered  by  the  Project.  About  14,000  poor  households  will \nparticipate  and  benefit.  Complementing  and  reinforcing \nthe  upgrading \ninvestments, 9 ha of new site will be developed, and some 1,300 shelter improvement loans and \n1,000 starter home loans made available to poor households.  \n\nimpact  of \n\nthe \n\nE. \n\nPontianak \n\n13. \nPontianak  (population,  460,000),  the  capital  of  West  Kalimantan  Province,  lies  across \nthe equator at the confluence of the Kapuas Kecil and Kapuas Landak rivers, some 5 km inland. \nThe city is low-lying, with elevations of 0.1\u20131.5 meters above mean sea level. Most of the water \ntable  is  within  a  meter  of  the  surface.  The  city  is  also  surrounded  and  divided  by  about  33 \nsmaller  rivers  and  channels,  creating  the  impression  that  Pontianak  is  built  on  water.  Periodic \nflooding is caused by tidal surges and flood flows from the two rivers. Throughout the city, many \nhouses, particularly those of the poor, are built on stilts on land that is periodically or perennially \nunder water.  \n\nThe highest concentration of poor people is in the west, with 38% of the total. Many live \n14. \nin  informal  areas,  including  kampungs,  unregulated  housing  developments,  and  squatter \nsettlements. All four kecamatan in the city contain slum and squatter areas. Most priority areas \nin Pontianak are built over swampland. Many houses are constructed on stilts above the water, \nand the area beneath is gradually filled in, partly by natural accretion and accumulation of solid \nwaste. The neighborhoods are connected by wooden walkways. In the older settlements, most \nwalkways  have  been  replaced  by  solid  causeways  surfaced  with  concrete,  but  wooden \nwalkways  often  remain  alongside  access  routes.  Most  houses  are  constructed  with  timber \nclapboard  walls,  fixed  to  timber  posts  with  corrugated  iron  roofing.  Most  of  the  housing \ndevelopment  is  along  straight  paths  laid  at  right  angles  to  the  main  road.  Usually,  the  main \naccess is raised and filled in, with the paths leading off it being timber planks on a framework \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nraised on stilts. Some 175 ha of upgrading is recommended, with 23 ha in the first phase. A total \nof 21,000 poor households will participate and benefit. \n\n15. \nThe  upgrading  work  and  associated  shelter  improvement  loans  (of  which  some  1,700 \nwill  be  required)  will  enhance  incremental  improvement,  already  in  evidence.  Many  housing \nplots will also be gradually filled in with earth, and a whole neighborhood may thus eventually be \nraised above water level. Water may be confined to channels on either side of the road rather \nthan left to find its own course as in poorer, less consolidated areas. In new settlements, the tide \ncreates  flows  under  and  around  houses.  As  a  result  of  building,  road  construction,  and  land-\nfilling,  flows  are  constricted  and  the  water  stagnates  in  pools.  Residents,  however,  treat  the \nwater  as  if  it  were  flowing  and  assume  that  natural  flushing  will  remove  litter  and  debris.  In \npractice, such deposits merely clog up the river and further restrict its flow, and what might have \nbeen relatively clean river water is no longer so, although people continue to wash and bathe in \nit.  Pontianak  has  no  sewerage.  Facilities  consist  of  communal  sanitary  facilities  and  on-plot \nlatrines  discharging  to  septic  tanks.  About  65%  of  solid  waste  is  collected.  The  system\u2019s \ngeographical coverage is 80% of the city, but only 65% of households enjoy regular collection \nservices. Pontianak is flat and low-lying and the water table is seldom more than a meter below \nthe surface. The town is where the two main rivers come together, and the tide causes major \nflooding.  Most  low-income  housing  is  on  swamps  and  permanent  standing  water.  Some \ndrainage channels are lined with wooden boards but few with permanent materials.  \n\n16.  Most  low-income  settlements  are  first  connected  by  wooden  walkways,  then  access \nroutes are filled and paved. Many areas have been upgraded under various kampung (village) \nimprovement  programs  (KIPs)  but  many  concrete  pavements  provided  in  the  1980s  have \nstarted to deteriorate and need repair and rehabilitation. In other areas, concrete paving slabs \nhave settled unevenly, perhaps because the land was poorly consolidated before they were laid, \nand,  ideally,  should  be  replaced.  Complementing  the  upgrading  investments,  some  12  ha  of \nnew site development is proposed along with some 1,300 new site loans. \n\nF. \n\nMedan  \n\n17.  Medan (population, 1.9 million) is the capital of North Sumatra Province. In 2000 around \n11.7%  of  the  total  population  was  classified  as poor,  and  46  slum  areas  were  identified.  Main \nproblems are insufficient drainage, lack of sanitation, and lack of water. Most housing provided \nfor  and  by  the  poor  is  informal.  Priority  sites  in  Medan  are  generally  in  inner  city  slums  and \nfringe and coastal areas:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nUnregulated subdivisions on dry land. These are found mainly but not exclusively \naround  the  city  center  and  are  characterized  by  rectangular  grid  layouts,  with \nfairly  generous  rights  of  way.  Most  houses  appeared  to  be  owned  by  their \noccupiers, although some smaller units for rent have been built.  \n\nVillage-type  developments  on  dry  land.  These  are  widely  scattered.  Some  are \nfairly close to rivers on land that is subject to occasional flooding but not directly \non the riverbanks. \n\nUnregulated subdivisions over swamps and tidal flats. These are mainly around \nthe  Belawan  port.  All  started  as  houses  on  stilts  over  water,  with  access  via \nwooden walkways. Over time, fill may be used to consolidate the land below the \nhouses, and wooden walkways are replaced by solid causeways. However, this \nprocess  can  take  many  years  and  is  mainly  confined  to  areas  on  the  edges  of \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n31 \n\nsettlements  close  to  the  shore.  The  priority  sites  occupy  an  estimated  220  ha, \nand  will  involve  about  26,000  households  and  2,400  complementary  shelter \nimprovement loans. \n\nSome  inner  city  villages  and  unregulated  land  subdivisions  could  be  connected  to  the \n18. \ncentral sewer system, but most people rely on some form  of on-site disposal, usually a septic \ntank  discharging  effluent  into  a  latrine.  Most  sanitation  facilities  are  likely  to  involve  on-plot \ndisposal, which needs tank and/or pit de-sludging. Settlements built over tidal mud flats have no \nproper sanitation facilities, relying on the tide to remove fecal material from below the houses. \nThose built on consolidated fill or on dry land usually have basic facilities, but need considerable \nrationalization and improvement.  \n\nOnly  about  65%  of  the  solid  waste  is  collected  and  delivered  to  the  local  government \n19. \nsanitation  service,  partly  because  service  coverage  is  only  about  35%  of  the  kota  area,  and \nmany  low-income  areas  have  no  regular  collection  service.  Flooding  occurs  along  the \nriverbanks but also elsewhere, especially in low-income areas, which are often on low-lying land \nor close to rivers. Flooding problems are exacerbated by the limited capacity and extent of the \ncity network system, inadequate drainage channel maintenance, and lack of community concern \nwith keeping drainage channels clear.  \n\n20.  Medan has general problems with road infrastructure but these have a limited impact on \nlow-income areas. Many roads and paths in low-income settlements have been upgraded under \nvarious  KIPs  but  could be  improved.  In  particular,  some  sea  and  riverside  settlements  rely  on \nwooden  walkways  for  access.  Some  of  these  are  in  poor  condition.  Complementing  and \nreinforcing the impact of the upgrading investments, some 17 ha of new sites will be developed, \nand 1,800 starter home loans made available to poor households. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n2\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n5\n \n\ni\n\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \nTable A5.1: Cost Estimates, by Expenditure Account \n\n \nExpenditure Account \n\nInfrastructure Works \n\nInvestment Costs \n1.

\n\nA. \n\nCentral Financial Institutions  \n\n1. \n\nBank Tabungan Negara  \n\n1. \nThe  state-owned  Bank  Tabungan  Negara  (BTN),  established  in  1950,  has  become \nIndonesia\u2019s leading bank in housing finance. In 1974 BTN was appointed as the housing credit \nfinancing institution to cater to the needs of low- and medium-income families. Today BTN still \nfocuses  on  housing  finance,  lending  to  medium-  and  low-income  groups,  and  real  estate  and \nhousing-related construction. As of December 2002 BTN had 42 branches, 39 auxiliary branch \noffices, and 93 cashier offices, a number of which are in the Project\u2019s pilot cities.  \n\n \n2. \nAs  of  December  2001  BTN\u2019s  total  assets  stood  at  Rp26,509  billion.  Its  total  liabilities \nwere Rp25,678 billion while its net income was Rp124 billion. Indicators of BTN\u2019s performance \nconfirm  its  financial  soundness  and  viability.  In  2001  BTN\u2019s  return  on  assets  and  return  on \nequity  were  0.5%  and  15.0%,  respectively.  The  bank\u2019s  capital  adequacy  ratio  was  10.85%, \nexceeding Bank Indonesia\u2019s requirement of at least 8.00%. The percentage of its nonperforming \nloans  was  4.75%,  better  than  Bank  Indonesia\u2019s  limit  of  5.00%.  BTN\u2019s  improved  financial \nperformance can largely be attributed to better management and shift away from subsidized to \nmarket-based housing loans.  \n \n3. \nBTN  plans  to  continue  to  operate  viably  and  profitably  in  the  next  6  years  by  (i) \ngenerating more low-cost deposits as its primary source of funds for lending and investments; \n(ii)  maintaining  sufficient  liquid  assets  to  meet  withdrawals;  (iii)  preserving  its  profitability  by \napplying  good  corporate  governance  practices,  adopting  advances  in  information  technology, \nand  engaging  in  more  market-based  lending  operations;  and  (iv)  practicing  prudential  banking \nby  ensuring,  among  others,  that  its  capital  adequacy  and  nonperforming  loans  ratios  comply \nwith Bank Indonesia requirements. All these will be undertaken by BTN within the context of a \ngenerally improving economy, stimulated by lower interest rates and higher levels of investment. \nBTN\u2019s  total  assets  are  estimated  to  exceed  Rp100,000  billion  by  2009.  The  proposed  ADB \nsubsidiary loan will account for at most 0.1% of BTN\u2019s current assets and will thus have minimal \nimpact  on  the  bank\u2019s  overall  financial  condition.  BTN\u2019s  comparative  financial  statements  and \nprojections in 2000\u20132009 are in Table A8.1. The bank\u2019s financial ratios are in Table A8.2 \n \n\n2.  \n\nPermodalan Nasional Madani  \n\n \n5. \nPermodalan  Nasional  Madani  (PNM)  was  established  in  June  1999  as  a  specialized \nfinancial  institution  to  develop  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  cooperatives  (MSMCs).  PNM \nruns  various  financial  activities  such  as  credit  programs,  financial  institutions,  and  venture \ncapital.  PNM  holds  minority  capital  subscriptions  in  several  microfinance  institutions,  including \nPNM  Baitul  Maal  wa-Tamwil,  Prime  Save  and  Loan  Cooperative,  and  Bank  Perkredita  in \nRakyat/Syariah.  To  efficiently  serve  the  MSMC  sector,  PNM  is  organized  into  the  credit \nprogram,  micro-syariah  financial  institution,  and  management  services  divisions.  They  operate \ncredit  schemes  through  a  network  of  executing  banks,  provide  capital  shares  to  selected \nmicrobanks, and provide advice and training to MSMCs.  \n \nPNM\u2019s total assets reached Rp1,719 billion in December 2002. The biggest component \n6. \nof  these  is  accounts  receivable  from  various  credit  schemes,  comprising  almost  60%  of  the \ncompany\u2019s total assets. Total liabilities of PNM were registered at Rp1,349, constituting 78% of \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nits total assets base, with Bank Indonesia as its biggest creditor. Total revenues generated by \nPNM  from  its  various  financing  programs  amounted  to  Rp104  billion.  Its  net  income  of  Rp37 \nbillion in 2002 represents more than a doubling of the net income in 2000 during the bank\u2019s first \nyear  of  operation.  PNM\u2019s  return  on  assets  and return  on  equity  ratios  in  2002  were  2.2%  and \n9.9%, respectively, indicating the bank\u2019s financial robustness and adherence to sound financial \nmanagement practices.  \n \n7. \nFinancial  projections  conducted  for  PNM  over  2003\u20132009,  using  conservative  growth \nassumptions,  will  result  in  doubling  of  its  total assets  from  Rp1,719  billion  in  2002  to  Rp3,463 \nbillion  in  2009.  These  projections  confirm  that  PNM  is  committed  to  generating  internal  funds \nthrough  effective  credit  programs  that  translate  into  a  steady  increase  in  net  profits,  from \nRp37.76  billion  in  2002  to  an  estimated  Rp149.49  billion  in  2009.  PNM  is  also  dedicated  to \npracticing  good  governance,  which  will  enable  the  bank  to  consistently  improve  its  earnings \nbefore tax margins of 43% in 2002 in the coming years.  \n \n8. \nThe  proposed  ADB  subsidiary  loan  will  generate  incremental  net  cash  inflows  and \npositive financial internal rates of return that will enable PNM to effectively service its debt under \nthe  Project  through  timely  repayments  of  local  financing  institutions  (LFIs)  (Supplementary \nAppendix F). Table A8.3 presents the comparative financial statements of PNM for 2000\u20132009. \nTable A8.4 summarizes the historical and projected financial ratios of the company.  \n \nB. \n\nLocal Financial Institutions \n\n9. \nBTN  and  PNM  will  channel  their  funds  for  on-lending  to  project  beneficiaries  through \nLFIs.  BTN  proposes  to  use  its  extensive  branch  network  all  over  the  country,  whenever \nappropriate, for its on-lending activities. PNM and BTN, however, recognize that people\u2019s credit \nbanks  (BPRs)  generally  have  the  credentials  and  experience  to  serve  as  effective  conduits  of \nhousing  microfinance  at  the  local  level,  particularly  for  the  Project\u2019s  targeted  urban  poor \nhouseholds.  \n \n10. \nBPRs  are  widely  regarded  as  microbanks.  In  2002  an  estimated  2,153  BPRs  had \naggregate  assets  valued  at  Rp6.7  trillion.  BPRs  are  supervised  by  Bank  Indonesia  using \nregulations that have been modified over the years to reflect standards suitable to microbanks. \nMore than 70% of BPRs have been rated sound or fairly sound by Bank Indonesia. PNM has \nestablished working and financial relationships with over 300 BPRs.  \n \nAssessments of representative BPRs\u2014Bank Pasar Kabupaten Pantul in Semarang, and \n11. \nKarya Bakti Ugahari in Medan\u2014confirm that they are financially viable and adhere to systems \nthat can effectively on-lend to the Project\u2019s targeted urban poor beneficiaries. Both BPRs have \nfinancial performance indicators that (i) comply with capital adequacy and nonperforming ratios \nmandated by Bank Indonesia, (ii) exhibit profitability, (iii) indicate healthy levels of liquidity, and \n(iv)  demonstrate  the  ability  to  preserve  asset  quality.  Supplementary  Appendix  G  presents  a \ncomparative summary of the financial performance and projections of the LFIs.     \n \n \n\n\fTable A8.1: Comparative Financial Statements of Bank Tabungan Negara (BTN), 2000\u20132009 \n\n(in Rp billion)  \n\n \n \nAccount \n\n \n2000 \n\n \n2001 \n\n \n2002 \n\n \n2003 \n\n \n2004 \n\n \n2005 \n\n \n2006 \n\n \n2007 \n\n \n2009 \n\nActual -----------------------> \n\nProjected --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- > \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA.

institution  selected  as  a  central  financial  institution  (CFI)  must  meet  the  following \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\nLegality.  A  CFI  must  be  an  independent  public  financial  institution  established, \norganized,  and  operating  in  accordance  with  the  regulations  of  Bank  Indonesia \nand/or the Ministry of Finance (MOF). A CFI should have a nationwide network of \nbranches  or  established  relationships  with  banks  or  nonbank  microfinance \ninstitutions eligible to serve as local financial institutions (LFIs) under the Project. \n\nSound  management.  A  CFI  should  adhere  to  effective  corporate  governance \nand be a reputable financial institution, respected by international, national, and \nlocal  banks.  A  CFI  must  have  an  organizational  structure  and  systems  that \npreserve its integrity and independence from outside influence.  \n\nSolvency. A CFI\u2019s performing assets should be sufficient to cover its liabilities to \nbe  considered  financially  solvent.  A  CFI\u2019s  solvency  will  be  based  on  its  capital \nadequacy  ratio  (CAR),  which  must  not  be  less  than  8%,  as  mandated  by  Bank \nIndonesia.  CAR  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  the  financial  institution\u2019s  equity  to  its \nassets  at  risk,  which  are  total  assets  net  of  loan  loss  provisioning  and  risk-free \nassets, which include cash, interbank loans, government-guaranteed loans, and \ninvestments in government securities.  \n\nAsset  quality.  A  CFI  must  have  a  nonperforming  loan  ratio  of  at  most  5%,  in \nkeeping with Bank Indonesia\u2019s minimum requirement. \n\nProfitability and efficiency. A CFI\u2019s profitability and efficiency will be measured \nby  the  following  financial  ratios:  (a)  return  on  equity,  or  net  profit  after  tax  over \nequity;  and  (b)  return  on  earning  assets,  or  net  profit  before  tax  over  earning \nassets. Earning assets are defined as loans plus investments. These ratios must \nmeet the minimum requirements of the regulators concerned. \n\n(vi) \n\nLiquidity. A CFI will be considered liquid if it can quickly convert its assets into \ncash  or  its  liquid  assets  are  sufficient  to  cover  its  short-term  liabilities.  This  is \nmeasured as the ratio of total loans to total deposits.  \n\n \n2. \nA CFI must also possess a proven track record in using branches or LFIs that are able to \neffectively  provide  housing  microfinance  to  urban  poor  households  as  required  under  the \nProject. \n\nLocal Financial Institutions \n\nAny institution selected as an LFI must fulfill several prerequisites: \n\n(i) \n\nLegality.

An  LFI  should  (a)  be  solvent\u2014i.e,  its  performing  assets \nare sufficient to cover its liabilities, or if a bank, has a CAR of at least 8%; (b) be \nprofitable and efficient\u2014as measured by return-on-equity and return-on-earning-\nasset ratios; (c) have quality assets\u2014a nonperforming loan ratio of at most 5% if \nthe LFI is a bank, or a collection efficiency of at least 95% if the LFI is a nonbank \ninstitution;  and  (d)  be  liquid\u2014able  to  quickly  convert  its  assets  into  cash  or  its \nliquid assets are sufficient to cover its short-term liabilities. If the LFI is a bank, its \nliquidity will be measured by its total loans to total deposits ratio.  \n\nOther  minimum  standards.

The  provision  of  land \nsecurity  will  foster  social  responsibility/ownership  of  project  benefits,  and  eventual  land  titling  will  offer  the  beneficiaries \nformal lending options. The Project  will also involve various community-designed livelihood improvement initiatives,  which \nmay  include  microfinance  development,  cottage  industry/trade  development,  establishment  of  community  services  and \nconstruction  of  light  infrastructure.  Through  these  initiatives  project  beneficiaries  will  be  provided  with  untapped  income \nsources  and  with  means  to  maximize  their  time  and  existing  resources.

It  is \nintended  that  such  an  approach  will  make  the  Project  adaptable  and  sensitive  to  local  situations \nand  capacities  of  communities  and  local  governments.  The  Project  will  ensure  that  all  the \nsubgroups within a community are involved, particularly the poorest of the poor and women, who \nare  often  the  most  marginalized  and  least  heard.  The  Project  provides  for  their  adequate \nrepresentation  and  mechanisms  for  consulting  with  them,  thereby  ensuring  that  their  needs  and \naspirations are adequately considered. \n \n2. \nfollowing: \n \n\nProject  features  that  could  call  for  the  application  of  the  resettlement  policy  are  the \n\nDue  to  the  Project,  beneficiaries  may  have  to  suffer  house  damage  or  loss,  which \nneeds to be documented and compensated. \n\nBeneficiaries  may  have  to  suffer  income  loss  or  unplanned  relocation  expenses, \nwhich should be covered by a relocation subsidy. \n\n3. \nThe  key  elements  of  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  strategy  are  that  (i) \nsubproject  selection  criteria  ensure  that  site  acquisition  will  not  involve  the  exercise  of  eminent \ndomain;  and  (ii)  participatory  planning  guarantees  that  minor  land  losses  caused  by  re-blocking \nwithin the site are freely contributed by affected informal settlers, if needed, and replaced through \nvoluntary land redistribution. To enable the rehabilitation of those affected by upgrading, serviced \nplots will be priced at affordable rates, house losses will be compensated at replacement cost, and \nrelocation  subsidies  provided.  If  involuntary  land  losses  to  formal  settlers  occur,  they  will  be  fully \ncompensated  in  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  Involuntary  Resettlement \nPolicy.  \n \n4. \nresettlement: \n\nThe  following  households/persons  will  be  eligible  for  compensation  for  involuntary \n\nowners of private properties that will be affected by the Project\u2019s right-of-way (ROW) \nrequirements, \n\nowners of improvements on private properties that will be affected by the Project\u2019s \nROW requirements, \n\nowners  of  dwelling  units  within  the  project  site  that  will  be  completely/severely \ndamaged due to the planned site development, and \n\nhouseholds  or  persons  whose  sources  of  livelihood  will  be  adversely  affected  or \npermanently dislocated by the proposed developments in the community. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n49 \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nB. \n\nSocioeconomic Profile \n\n5. \nGiven the lack of official data at the community level, a participatory approach was used to \nmeasure poverty in the pilot communities. Under this, the project preparatory technical assistance \nused participatory rapid appraisal techniques and household surveys to determine the dimensions \nof  poverty  in  the  pilot  communities.  The  tools  and  strategies  used  for  the  surveys  included  the \nfollowing: \n\nparticipatory rapid appraisal techniques; \n\ncommunity  stakeholders  workshops  to  assess  poverty  and  social  issues  both  for \nmen and women; \n\nsocioeconomic surveys of pilot communities;  \n\ntransect walks; and \n\nsemi-structured \nleaders,  women,  micro-\nentrepreneurs,  traders,  and  other  personalities  from  different  socioeconomic \nbackgrounds. \n\nlocal  community \n\ninterviews  with \n\nTable A13.1 sets out the key poverty indicators for the Project\u2019s pilot communities. \n\nTable A13.1: Key Poverty Indicators for Pilot Communities \n(%) \n \n\nItem \n\nMedan City \n\nPekanbaru  Tangerang  Pontianak  Makassar \n\nMataram \n\nPercentage of Poverty \nIncidence  \n\nEngel\u2019s Coefficient \n\nPercentage of Households \nwith Walls Mainly of Earth and \nBamboo \n\nPercentage of Households \nwith Pipe or Pump Source of \nDrinking Water \n\nPercentage of Households \nwith Own Sanitation Facilities \n\n71.0 \n\n54.4 \n\n4.6 \n\n48.0 \n\n49.7 \n\n0.0 \n\n42.0 \n\n54.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n58.0 \n\n48.1 \n\n0.0 \n\n81.0 \n\n60.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n26.2 \n\n25.0 \n\n12.5 \n\n3.3 \n\n5.1 \n\n100.0 \n\n65.8 \n\n8.3 \n\n5.0 \n\n26.2 \n\n34.6 \n\n17.5 \n\n41.7 \n\n18.6 \n\n10.0 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nC. \n\nConsultation and Grievance Procedures \n\nThe  NUP  is  intrinsically  a  consultative  process  but,  to  ensure  its  proper  functioning,  civil \n7. \nsociety  and  the  range  of  stakeholders  will  monitor  the  outcomes  and  invite  submissions.  The \nresettlement  framework  will  be  distributed  in  all  communities  and  disclosed  to  ADB  and  in  each \napproved  NUP.  Eventual  grievances  will  be  first  lodged  at  the  community  level  to  a  community \ngrievances  committee.  If  within  2  weeks  the  case  is  not  settled,  the  complainant  will  lodge  the \ngrievance  to  the  neighborhood  level.

The conduct of the IEEs has allowed \nthe  Project  to  identify  environmental  impacts  and  to  propose  mitigation  measures.  The \nprocedure  adopted  in  identifying  all  significant  environmental  impacts  follows  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003).  \n\nB. \n\nDescription of the Project and Environment \n\n2. \nAll subprojects involve small-scale civil works such as local roads and drains to improve \nthe environment of poor neighborhoods. Common to all subprojects is the generation of small, \nsignificant  environmental  impacts  during  design  and  construction.  The  civil  works  are  not \nsubstantial  in  terms  of  scale  and  cost,  and  are  mostly  on-site  improvement  of  drainage,  road, \nand  water  distribution  systems.  In  particular,  the  proposed  infrastructure  works  in  the \nsubprojects, by their very nature, mitigate environmental impacts and reduce the inherent health \nrisks attributable to the unplanned development of these poor urban communities. However, the \nsubprojects\u2019  high  population  density  multiplies  small  environmental  impacts  and  warrants \nattention, particularly in the planning stage.  \n \n3. \nThe  proposed  subprojects  will  upgrade  communities  with  limited  available  land. \nUnplanned  house  construction  and  haphazard  provision  of  drainage  canals  and  water  lines \ninstalled  by  individual  settlers  cause  most  significant  environmental  impacts.  Since  existing \ndrainage and water lines are in the same trench and usually follow the alignment of alleys and \nfootpaths,  any  improvement  of  these  services  will  have  negative  impact  on  the  local \nenvironment,  but  the  effects  are  short  term  even  within  a  longer  construction  stage.  A  more \ndetailed description of each subproject is in Appendix 4. \n \n4. \nThe  environment  of  the  subproject  sites  is  already  urban,  albeit  poorly  serviced.  No \nsignificant  species  of  flora  or  fauna  were  found.  Topography  varies  but  is  generally  flat.  Soil \nconditions also vary from sandy soils to clay.  \n \nC. \n\nPotential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n5. \nImpacts that are common to the subprojects and recommended mitigation measures are \nin  Table  A14.  These  recommended  measures  are  simple  and  easy  to  integrate  into  the \nfeasibility  study  and  detailed  engineering  phases  of  each  subproject  development.  Other \nimpacts, such as silt runoff and relations between workers from other areas and local residents \nwill be managed, if necessary. \n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \n\nImpacts \n\nEnvironmental problems due to design \nInterference  with  other  utilities  in \nsame trench \n\nIntensification  of  water  pollution \ncontrol \n\nCreation of sewage/sanitation \nproblem \n\nTable A14: Subproject Environmental Impacts and \nTypical Recommended Mitigation Measures \n\nRecommended Mitigation Measures \n\nWith the residents and local water utility, prepare a detailed map of each \nresidential/subdivision block showing the alignment of existing water lines. \nPrepare an excavation schedule of each section of the proposed drainage \nsystem that avoids or minimize interference with water line. \nWith limited available area combined sewer and drainage canal is \nrecommended. Prohibitive cost of centralized sewerage treatment plant \ndoes not allow its construction. Ensure that all households have specific \ntank and are regularly de-sludge to ensure their proper operation. \nWhen possible, reuse domestic wash water from bathrooms and sinks for \nirrigation. \nCover all open drainage canals along the major roads with concrete slabs. \nEnsure that all households have septic tanks and they are regularly de-\nsludged. Educate the community in the importance of regular maintenance \nand educate contractors on proper procedures of removal and disposal. \nWhen feasible, convert footpaths and alleys to covered drain to ensure \nadequate canal capacity, optimize available space, and minimize health risk. \n\nEnvironmental problems in construction stage \nHazards to workers and nearby \nresidents from communicable \ndiseases and emissions of dust, \nfumes, noise and vibrations \nAccidental  damage  to  utilities  in \nthe same trench \n\nEducate all construction workers on handling sewage. Equip workers with \nproper protective gear such as rubber gloves and boots. To minimize \nnuisance, heavy equipment operation should be done during daytime (9:00 \na.m.\u20136:00 p.m.). Inform affected residents before equipment operation. \nBased  on  the  detailed  map  showing  the  location  of  water  pipes  and \nexcavation map, inform affected residents of possible disturbances in water \nsupply. Drainage canals to be constructed along/as footpaths that will affect \naccess should be done in phases and immediately covered by metal sheets \nor catwalks to allow access of residents.  \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Management System \n\nAs  all  subprojects  envisaged  will  not  have  significant  environmental \n\nimpacts, \n6. \nparticipating  local  governments  will  be  required  to  obtain  the  relevant  environmental  impact \nanalysis  (AMDAL)  or  environmental  impact  assessment/environmental  impact  mitigation \n(UKL/UPL)  clearance.  This  will  require  consultant  support  to  the  PMU,  which  the  Project\u2019s \ncapacity-building component will provide while institutionalizing capacity within DGHS. \n \n7. \nThe  environmental  management  system  is  integrated  into  the  subproject  approval \nprocess  and  the  neighborhood  upgrading  plan  (NUP)  process.  An  environmental  assessment \nand  review  procedure  has  been  prepared  and  no  subproject  will  be  approved  by  the  PMU \nwithout  environmental  clearance.  The  steering  committee  will  monitor  compliance  with  this \nprocess.  The  NUP  process  is  a  consultative  one  that  designs  project  interventions,  including \nenvironment-related  interventions  with  the  community  concerned,  and  written  approval  of \nproposed activities is required from all members of the community (see below).  \n\n \nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\nE. \n\nAmple  opportunities  for  the  public  to  participate  in  the  design  process  of  all  the \n\n8. \nsubprojects were ensured: \n \n\n \nD. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n55 \n\n \n\n(i) \n\nStructured  subproject  site  contacts  with  the  officers  of  community  associations, \nlocal  government  officials,  and  DGHS  regional  officers.  In  addition  to  standard \npractice  in  subproject  preparation  where  environmental  impacts  are  identified \nand evaluated, these contacts provided an opportunity for the local community to \nprovide feedback on environmental issues. During each study team visit, at least \nthree rounds of these contacts were conducted. \n\n(ii)  Workshops  were  conducted  where  the  subproject  initial  design  was  developed \nand ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines explained in the context of the Project. The \nconsultant  primarily  informs  the  community  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  the \nsubproject.  This  workshop  also  validates  the  consultant\u2019s  assessment  of  the \nimpacts.  During  these  workshops,  the  need  to  comply  with  local  environmental \nregulations is also emphasized.  \n\n(iii) \n\nA  discussion  with  the  local  environmental  agency  is  conducted  to  present  in \nsummary  the  findings  and  initial  recommendations  of  the  study  team.  Issues \nraised  during  the  walkthroughs  and  workshops  are  revalidated.  During  this \ndiscussion  any  issues  raised  by  the  agency  are  addressed  or  agreements \nreached as to how to address them. \n\n(iv) \n\nA socioeconomic and perception survey was conducted to provide a baseline for \nassessment of residents perceptions of, among other things, the environment. \n\n \n9. \nThe  NUP  is  a  product  of  an  intensive  consultation  process  as  it  is  embodied  by  the \nprinciple  of  participatory  planning  and  community-led  approach  to  development.  This  implies \nthat interventions in the community are conceptualized, designed, planned, and implemented by \nthe  members  themselves  in  close  collaboration  with  the  local  government  that  governs  them \nand guided by sound urban planning, social and environmental principles. Thus, the NUP is the \nresult  of  consensual  agreements  that  could  only  be  achieved  through  constant  interaction \namong  those  involved.  Aside  from  including  a  documentation  of  the  public  consultations \nundertaken,  the  NUP  outlines  the  subproject  proposals  and  designs  that  were  determined  by \nthe community members themselves.  \n \nF. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n1. \n\nBeneficial Impacts \n\nThere will be significant environmental benefits directly and indirectly attributable to the \n10. \ninfrastructure proposals within the Project. The main beneficiaries will be all vulnerable groups, \nincluding women, children, and old people. The improvements in most neighborhood upgrading \nareas will include an improved and dependable clean water supply, improved sanitation facilities \nand  off-site  treatment  and  disposal,  improved  solid  waste  collection  and  transportation,  and \nimproved access roads and pathways. \n \n11. \nespecially women, children, old people, and other disadvantaged groups. \n \n12. \nIn  most  instances  it  is  likely  that  the  overall  environmental  benefits  will  outweigh  any \nlocalized  adverse  impacts.  Nevertheless,  the  scale  of  these  adverse  impacts  should  be \ndetermined, and mitigation and management proposals provided wherever necessary. \n \n\nThe  provision  of  new  sites  with  infrastructure  will  also  benefit  all  incoming  residents, \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n2. \n\nAdverse Impacts  \n\n13. \nTo  define  adverse  impacts  of  all  general  infrastructure  proposals,  an  IEE  has  been \ncarried out to determine the specific environmental requirements necessary: full environmental \nassessment  report,  environmental  monitoring  and  management  report,  or  no  specific \nrequirement.  Generalized  proposals  have  been  prepared  for  site  upgrading  and  new  site \ndevelopment and have been used in the IEE. \n \nBased on a general understanding of the type of infrastructure projects proposed as part \n14. \nof  this  Project  and  on  previous  experience  in  the  Integrated  Urban  Development  and  Poverty \nReduction  Project,  no  projects  will  require  full  environmental  impact  assessment  (AMDAL) \nunder Indonesian regulations, or fall within category A of ADB classification. The infrastructure \nprojects  are  small-scale,  benign,  and  do  not  cause  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts. \nDetailed assessment of the subprojects is set out in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nG. \n\nConclusions and Recommendation \n\n15. \nThe nature of the proposed subprojects, being community upgrading, will fundamentally \nimprove  the  urban  environment  through  improved  access,  proper  handling  and  disposal  of \ndomestic wastewater, avoidance of flood damage, and provision of potable water. Also inherent \nin  this  type  of  subproject  is  the  dense  population  living  on  the  construction  site;  even  simple \ndrainage canal excavation, therefore, will have an impact, albeit small and short. \n \n16. \nThe Project emphasizes the importance of conducting an IEE to identify environmental \nconsiderations during subproject site identification, design, and feasibility analysis. The findings \nand  recommendations  enriched  the  engineering  designs  to  incorporate  simple  mitigation \nmeasures such as dust suppression, timing of heavy equipment operation to avoid disturbances \ndue to noise, proper handling of domestic wastewater and its re-use for irrigation purposes, and \ntraditional  construction  practices  that  overlook  these  mundane  impacts.  The  IEE  also  pointed \nout  the  need  to  revise  the  engineering  designs  to  avoid  adverse  environmental  impacts, \nreducing potential risk of erosion and groundwater contamination, among others. \n \nLocal governments will need to ensure that all subprojects secure an AMDAL clearance \n17. \nor  UKL/UPL.  With  minimal  reformatting  of  the  IEE,  the  subproject  proponents  will  be  able  to \ncomply with government environmental impact statement guidelines.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n57 \n\nECONOMIC, FINANCIAL, AND POVERTY IMPACT ANALYSES \n\nGeneral \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nA. \n \nThe  economic  and  financial  analyses  of  the  six  project  sites  were  undertaken  in \n1. \naccordance with the following Asian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines: (i) Framework for the \nEconomic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Project, (ii) Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects, (iii) Guidelines for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial \nAnalysis  of  Projects,  and  (iv)  Bank  Criteria  for  Subsidies.  This  appendix  summarizes  a \nsupplementary  appendix,  which  provides  the  detailed  calculation  of  economic  internal  rates  of \nreturn (EIRRs) for all subprojects, and the financial internal rates of return (FIRRs), which were \ncomputed for the revenue-generating components.  \n  \nB. \n \n2. \nThe proposed upgraded neighborhoods and new site subprojects will address the land-\nownership issue and distribute individualized titles or other forms of secure tenure instruments. \nThe  subprojects  will  also  provide  basic  services  such  as  roads  and  footpaths  and  drainage \nfacilities  to  (i)  increase  residents\u2019  access  to  jobs;  (ii)  reduce  damage,  losses,  and  waterborne \ndiseases  due  to  flooding;  and  (iii)  improve  community  sanitation  by  increasing  the  sewage \nconveyance  capacity  of  drainage  canals.  Benefits  from  the  housing  microfinance  components \nwere  quantified  either  by  imputing  the  potential  increase  in  property  rental  values  after \nsubproject  completion  or  by  converting  into  economic  benefits  the  potential  stream  of  net \nincome flows accruing to the borrowers.  \n \n3. \nThe major indicators of the economic viability of the proposed upgrading subprojects are \nsummarized  in  Table  A16.1.  Base-case  EIRRs  calculated  for  the  subprojects  ranged  from \n15.0% to 44.8%, exceeding ADB\u2019s 12.0% economic opportunity cost of capital, and confirming \nthe  subprojects\u2019  economic  robustness.  Sensitivity  analysis  conducted  on  parameters  that \ninclude  10%  increase  in  costs,  10%  increase  in  benefits,  or  both,  and  delays  in  benefit \nrealization  showed  that  the  EIRRs  will  be  highly  vulnerable  to  changes  in  the  anticipated \nbenefits from the subprojects. Due to the short-term nature, low capital input, and high product \nturnover of representative activities to be financed, the calculated EIRRs for the housing finance \nsubprojects were robust, at 32.6%. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nthe  housing \nfinancial  sustainability  projections  were  prepared \nmicrofinance component as the only revenue-generating component. FIRRs were not calculated \nfor the upgraded neighborhoods and new sites pilot subprojects because all six will either adopt \nan  on-site  upgrading  approach  and  their  beneficiaries  had  limited  ability  to  pay,  or  due  to  the \nspillover  benefits  of  the  proposed  off-site  infrastructure  to  other  communities  outside  the \ntargeted  upgrading  sites,  some  degree  of  local  government  subsidy  to  the  Project  would  be \ndeemed  justified.  The  local  governments  will  eventually  recover  these  subsidies  through  the \nappropriate property taxation mechanisms. \n \n5. \nThe  major  indicators  of  the  financial  viability  of  the  proposed  subprojects  are \nsummarized in Table A15.1. The shelter finance subcomponent is highly viable, with base-case \nFIRRs of 62.5%, above the computed real weighted average cost of capital of 6.6%.  \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nFIRRs  and \n\nfor \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nTable A15.1: Economic and Financial Analyses Summary \n  \n\n \n\n \nBase  \nEIRR \n40.3% \n21.7% \n40.3% \n24.6% \n44.8% \n15.0% \n32.6% \n21.2 % \n \nBase \nFIRR \n62.5% \n\n2 \nBenefits \nless 10% \n35.6% \n19.1% \n35.9% \n21.7% \n39.9% \n11.8% \n28.1% \n19.0% \nCollection \nEfficiency \nless 5% \n24.1% \n\n1 \nCapital  \nCosts + 10%\n36.8% \n19.8% \n36.8% \n22.4% \n40.9% \n13.6% \n28.8% \n19.3% \n \nCosts + 5%\n\n4 \nCombined \n1+2 \n32.7% \n17.4% \n32.7% \n19.6% \n36.4% \n12.0% \n24.9% \n17.2% \nRevenues \nDelayed 1 \nYear \n2.23% \n\n5 \nBenefits  \nDelayed 1 Year \n30.0% \n17.5% \n30.0% \n16.5% \n32.7% \n10.2% \n23.9% \n17.5% \n\nSubproject \nEconomic Analysis \nUpgrading Pilot Makassar \nUpgrading Pilot Pekanbaru \nUpgrading Pilot Tangerang \nUpgrading Pilot Pontianak \nUpgrading Pilot Mataram \nUpgrading Pilot Medan \nMicrohousing Loans LFI \nNew Site Tangerang \n \nSubproject \nFinancial Analysis \nMicrohousing Loans LFI \n EIRR = economic internal rate of return, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, LFI = local financial institution, \n O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nD. \n \n6. \nPoverty impact assumptions applicable to the Project are in Supplementary Appendix F. \nPilot  project  consumer  benefits  were  calculated  by  deducting  the  financial  payment  of \nbeneficiaries from their calculated economic benefit. The poverty impact of benefits accruing to \nGovernment  and  the  labor  component  of  the  civil  works  and  housing  constructed  was  also \ncalculated.  Table  A15.2  shows  the  calculation  of  the  poverty  impact  ratio  derived  from  the \nexperience  in  pilot  sites.  These  are  representative  of  the  size  and  type  of  investments  and, \nbroadly,  of  the  project  communities.  Thus,  the  benefits  and  costs  associated  with  the  various \ncomponents  have  to  be  increased  to  calculate  the  actual  poverty  impact  of  the  whole  Project. \nThese factors are increased in proportion to the relative size of the full project component to the \npilot  component.  The  \u201csize\u201d  of  the  component  is  measured  in  terms  of  number  of  households \nimpacted or loans as appropriate.  \n \n\nPoverty Impact \n\n35.2% \n\nTable A15.2: Summary Project Poverty Impact \n(Rp million) \n \n\n \n\nBenefit \nCategory \n\n \nProject \nConsumer \nImpact \n\nGovernment \n\n \nImpact on Other Stakeholders \n \n \n \n\nCapital \n12,499 \n\nO&M \n20 \n\nLabor \n\nCapital \n585 \n\nO&M \n437 \n\n \n\n \nTotal \n13,541 \n\n \nTotal \nPoverty \nImpact \n100,493 \n\n \nTotal \nBenefits \n\n207,027\n\nMicrofinance \n\n86,952 \n\nUpgrading \n\n837,803 \n\n4,267 \n\n80,374 \n\n133,348  221,794  1,059,597  1,994,770\n\nNew Sites \n\n159,670 \n\n411 \n\n7,351 \n\n12,781 \n\n20,874 \n\n180,544 \n\n380,167\n\n     Total \n\n1,084,425 \n\n5,263 \n\n100,224 \n\n146,566  256,209  1,340,634  2,581,964\n\n3,805 \n\n330 \n\n4,155 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.52\n\nPoverty Index \nO&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n59 \n\nE. \n\nPricing and Affordability to Targeted Beneficiaries \n\nAffordability to Participating Local Governments \n\n9. \nOverall,  the  proposed  housing  microfinance  to  undertake  home  improvements  or \npurchase a serviced plot and build a starter home were designed to be affordable to the bottom \n35%  of  the  total  urban  households  (Supplementary  Appendix  D).  Monthly  amortization \npayments  for  housing  microfinance  were  calculated  at  an  indicative  16%  for  36  months,  and \ncompared  against  the  income  and  borrowing  capacity  of  the  beneficiaries  from  a  pilot \nsubproject.  Based  on  these  calculations,  the  proposed  housing  microfinance  will,  on  the \naverage,  be  affordable  at  the  20th\u201330th  percentiles  of  the  national  urban  household  income \ndistribution, the targeted project beneficiary groups. Land and basic infrastructure services to be \nprovided  under  the  upgraded  neighborhood  and  new  sites  component  will  be  financed  by \nmatching  grants  from  the  central  Government  and  the  participating  local  governments.  These \nwill generally not be recovered directly from the beneficiaries but indirectly through taxation.  \n \nF. \n \nThe  financial  capability  of  the  local  governments,  which  serve  as  the  implementing \n10. \nagencies  for  the  upgraded  neighborhoods  and  new-site  component  of  the  Project,  were \nevaluated  (Supplementary  Appendix  F)  based  on  their  financial  statements  and  forecasts  of \nfuture  revenues  and  expenditures.  Given  the  financing  requirements  of  the  upgraded \nneighborhoods and new project sites, all the pilot cities will be able to afford the matching grant \nrequirements  of  the  Project.  The  projected  financial  statements  of  2001\u20132010  suggest  further \nthat the pilot cities\u2019 financial performance and standing will improve over the medium term. \n \nG. \n \n11. \nFor the shelter microfinance component of the Project, the financial capability of central \nfinancial institutions (CFIs) and local financial institutions (LFIs) potentially eligible to participate \nwere  evaluated  (Supplementary  Appendix  F).  Financial  projections  were  also  conducted  to \nascertain their ability to pay the debt-servicing requirements of the subprojects. Representative \nLFIs were assessed. Projections of their financial statements indicate that LFIs will continue to \noperate  profitably  over  the  long  term  and  benefit  from  the  Project.  They  also  more  than \nadequately  meet  the  minimum  standard  requirements  in  six  basic  areas:  (i)  legality,  (ii) \nmanagement  capability,  (iii)  financial  solvency,  (iv)  adherence  to  asset  quality,  (v)  profitability \nand  efficiency,  and  (vi)  liquidity.  Given  the  projected  net  positive  inflows  and  financial  internal \nrates  of  return  from  the  proposed  on-lending  subprojects,  the  LFIs  will  be  more  than  able  to \nmeet the Project\u2019s debt-servicing requirements.  \n \n12. \nFor  the  CFI  role,  the  financial  capability  of  Bank  Tabungan  Negara  (BTN)  and \nPermodalan  Nasional  Madani  (PNM)  were  examined.  Both  have  liquidity,  profitability,  asset \nquality, and capital adequacy ratios that confirm their financial soundness. Financial projections \nshow that these CFIs will continue to generate significantly positive net incomes. The eligibility \ncriteria  for  project  CFIs  have  been  prepared  to  attract  financially  sound,  forward  looking,  and \nhousing microfinance specialized banks and nonbank financial institutions. The Project\u2019s debt-\nservicing requirements will be more than sufficiently met by BTN and PNM, particularly in light of \ntheir demonstrated track record in implementing on-lending programs for the poor through their \nbranches and local executing banks that meet their accreditation policies and criteria. \n\nAffordability to Participating Financial Institutions \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n \n", " \nADB \nADF \nBAPPENAS \n", "BME \nBPN \nBPR \nBPS \nBTN \nCoBILD \nCBO \nCFI \nCSS \nDGHS \nDIP \nDTD \nEIRR \nFIRR \nFPMU \nGTZ \n", "HDO \nIBRA \nIBRD \nIDA \nIEE \nIUIDP \nKIP \nLAR \nLCB \nLCO \nLFI \nLGU \nLIBOR \nMIS \nMOC \nMOF \nMOHA \nMSMC \nNGO \nNUP \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENT \n(as of 29 October 2003) \n", "Currency Unit\nRp1.00\n$1.00\n", "rupiah (Rp) \n$.0001172 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n=  Rp8,530 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013  Asian Development Fund \n\u2013  Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional \n(National Development Planning Board) \nbenefit monitoring and evaluation \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013  Badan Pertanahan Nasional (National Land Agency) \n\u2013  Bank Perkreditan Rakyat (people's credit bank) \n\u2013  Biro Pusat Statistik (Central Bureau of Statistics) \nBank Tabungan Negara (National Savings Bank) \n\u2013 \nCommunity-Based Initiatives for Housing and Local Development \n\u2013 \ncommunity-based organization \n\u2013 \ncentral financial institution \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \ncity shelter strategy \n\u2013  Directorate General of Human Settlements \n\u2013  Daftar Isian Proyek (Budget Allocation from Development Project) \n\u2013  Directorate of Technical Development \neconomic internal rate of return \n\u2013 \nfinancial internal rate of return \n\u2013 \nfinancial project management unit \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit \n", "(German Agency for Technical Cooperation) \nhousing development organization \nIndonesian Bank Reconstruction Agency  \nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development \nInternational Development Association \ninitial environmental examination \nIntegrated Urban Infrastructure Development Project \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Kampung Improvement Program \nland acquisition and resettlement \n\u2013 \nlocal competitive bidding \n\u2013 \nlocal coordinating office \n\u2013 \nlocal financial institution \n\u2013 \nlocal government unit \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nLondon interbank offered rate \n\u2013  management information system \n\u2013  Ministry of Cooperatives \n\u2013  Ministry of Finance \n\u2013  Ministry of Home Affairs \n\u2013  micro, small, and medium-sized cooperative \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "nongovernment organization \nneighborhood upgrading plan \n", "OCR \nOSC \nPMU \nPNM \nPPTA \nPSC \nROW \nSOE \nSPSS \nTA \nUNCHS \nUNDP \nUPP \nUSAID \n", "ordinary capital resources \noperational support consultant \nproject management unit \n", "project preparatory technical assistance \nproject steering committee  \nright of way \nstatement of expense \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Permodalan Nasional Madani (National Fund for Social Investment) \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Spatial Planning and Shelter Strategy \n\u2013 \n\u2013  United Nations Centre for Human Settlements \n\u2013  United Nations Development Programme \n\u2013  Urban Poverty Project \n\u2013  United States Agency for International Development \n", "technical assistance \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNOTE \n", " \n", " \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "This report was prepared by M.
