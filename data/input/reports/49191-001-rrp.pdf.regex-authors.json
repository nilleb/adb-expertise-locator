THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Post-Flood National Highways Rehabilitation Project.1 \n \n2.  The proposed rehabilitation project includes 212 kms of damaged highway sections and \n33 damaged bridges located on the national highway network of Pakistan. It will restore critical \nphysical infrastructure to sustain livelihoods and access to markets, as well as build post-\ndisaster traffic management capacity in the National Highway Authority (NHA). The project will \ncontribute to the economic recovery of 2010 flood affected areas in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, \nPunjab, and Sindh provinces. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Pakistan\u2019s  transport  sector  contributes  about  10%  to  the  country\u2019s  gross  domestic \nproduct, accounts for about 35% of total energy consumption annually, and receives 20%\u201325% \nof the annual federal public sector development program. It provides an estimated 2.3 million \njobs (5.9% of the employed labor force). Although comprising less than 5% of the total road \nnetwork (about 263,000 km), the national highway network (about 12,500 km) caters to 80% of \ncommercial  traffic.2 Despite  the  high  reliance  on  road  transport\u2014accounting  for  92%  of \npassenger traffic and 96% of freight traffic in Pakistan\u2014the quality of the road infrastructure \ncauses severe capacity constraints. \n \n4.  Before 1995, Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance to Pakistan had focused on \nimprovement of rural access roads to complement ADB\u2019s then focus on agriculture sector \ndevelopment. From 1995, the perspective was expanded to national connectivity for economic \ngrowth in general, covered provincial and national highways. Since 2005, ADB assistance has \nfocused on the trade corridor and regional connectivity, and two multitranche financing facilities \nprovided in 2005 and 2007 were designed for key trade corridors connecting seaports, industrial \ncenters, and border crossing points.3 \n \n5.  In parallel, ADB has supported the government in addressing institutional constraints. \nADB\u2019s program loan provided in 2001 for the national sector policy reform program assisted the \nNHA in implementing reform programs covering (i) transport policy, (ii) road sector resource \nmanagement, (iii) road sector preservation, (iv) institutional efficiency improvement, and (v) road \nsafety.4 Through such reforms, the NHA has managed to (i) establish the road maintenance \nfund for stable road maintenance expenditure; (ii) establish the road asset management system, \nto prioritize scarce resources; (iii) establish the National Highway and Motorway Police, which \ncontributes to controlling overloading, and thus reduce premature deterioration of highways; \n(iv) promote awareness on road safety; and (v) explore public\u2013private partnerships. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2015.

Manila. \n4  ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans to the Islamic \nRepublic of Pakistan for the Road Sector Development Program. Manila. \n ", "2 \n6.  However, sector reforms should continue, particularly to address (i) the shortfall in road \nmaintenance  resources  (by  expanding  the  toll  base  and  rationalizing  the  toll  rates); \n(ii) overloading (through modernizing the aging truck fleet with emphasis on high-capacity, multi-\naxle trucks); (iii) road safety (through concerted national and provincial efforts); and (iv) public\u2013\nprivate  partnership  (by reducing  the country  risk for  private  investors  to  price  it  properly). \nIn November 2015, ADB approved capacity development technical assistance of $15.4 million \nto Pakistan as part of the Government of the United Kingdom\u2019s assistance through the Pakistan \nEconomic Corridors Program5 to help strengthen transport facilitation for cross-border transport, \nadvance the national road safety program, develop a national transport policy and master plan, \nand scale up road asset management. \n \n7.  The challenges faced by the transport sector have been exacerbated by the increasing \nfrequency and severity of natural hazard events, and the potential impact of climate change. \nSince the 2000s, Pakistan has repeatedly been hit by a series of heavy monsoon rains, which \ncaused severe flooding in nearly all parts of the country. Lowlands around the Indus River \nbasin, the Chenab and Jhelum rivers, and along the coastline were the most heavily affected. \nSevere flooding not only caused death and displacement of people but also destroyed property, \nlivelihoods,  and  infrastructure\u2014particularly  transport  infrastructure.  These  natural  disasters \npose new challenges to the NHA, which is already challenged by insufficient resources for road \nnetwork  development  and  maintenance.  As  a result,  it  has  become  difficult to  pursue  the \nnationwide road network development strategy and sector reforms consistently since planning is \nfrequently  disrupted  by  the  need  to  provide  scarce  financial  and  human  resources  for \nemergency  recovery  of  damaged  road  networks  in  fragile  flood-hit  areas.  ADB\u2019s  timely \nemergency assistance to the government was, in most cases, instrumental in rehabilitating \ndestroyed property, and enabling communities to restore livelihoods. \n \n8.  The  2010  floods  were  the  worst  in  Pakistan\u2019s  history,  affecting  100,000  square \nkilometers and 20 million people (more than a tenth of the country\u2019s population). They resulted \nin 1,800 deaths and caused an estimated $10 billion in total damage. Immediately after the \nfloods subsided, the government started the early recovery and restoration of basic services, \nhousing, and livelihoods. Basic transport infrastructure and irrigation facilities were also badly \ndamaged in 80 of the country\u2019s 110 districts across Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, \nand Sindh. According to the damage and needs assessment report prepared by ADB and the \nWorld Bank in conjunction with federal and provincial government agencies, 793 km of national \nhighways  (7%  of  the  national  highway  network)  were  identified  as  requiring  immediate \nrehabilitation to ensure their stability and public safety.6 \n \n9.  In 2011, ADB approved the Flood Emergency Reconstruction Project in the amount of \n$650  million  to  assist  the  government  in  the  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  national \nhighways,  provincial  roads,  irrigation  and  drainage,  and  flood  protection  infrastructure.7 \nThe emergency reconstruction project became effective on 26 May 2011 and was closed on \n25 May 2015. The project was originally intended to rehabilitate 793 km of national highways, \nas identified by the damage and needs assessment report (which classified 383 km as partially \ndamaged and 410 km as fully damaged). Upon completion of the detailed survey and design, \nhowever, the affected length of national highways was expanded to 1,044 km and 46 bridges. \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2015.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors:  Proposed Loans and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Flood Emergency Reconstruction Project. \nManila. \n ", "3 \nBut the scope of the project was reduced to rehabilitate only 653 km of national highways. \nDuring implementation, the scope was further reduced to a prioritized length of 344 km, mainly \nbecause (i) bid prices were much higher than the estimates, (ii) considerable additional time \nwas  required  to  redesign  some  sections  of  the  highways,  and  (iii)  procurement  was \nunsuccessful  for  some  subprojects.  The  reduced  scope  of  the  project  (i.e.,  344  km)  was \ncompleted when the loan was closed on 25 May 2015.8 The NHA, through its own resources, \nis financing the reconstruction and/or repair of an additional 97 km. \n \n10.  The government has not been able to secure funding for the remaining 212 km of \ndamaged highway sections and 33 bridges, which should be rehabilitated immediately to avoid \nfurther damage and safety hazard. These roads and bridges are the only transport links for the \nlocal population, which is being temporarily served through makeshift arrangements, such as \nBailey bridges. ADB\u2019s post-flood assistance for the remaining 212 km of the damaged sections \nof the highways and 33 bridges will (i) expedite the economic and social recovery of the affected \npopulation from the floods and provide greater resilience to future floods, and (ii) ensure that the \nfull development impact of the emergency reconstruction project is achieved and that ADB\u2019s \nintervention is effective. Apart from the recovery of damaged road infrastructure, the NHA\u2019s \ncapacity to cope with such natural disasters and manage a quicker response for the early \nrestoration  of  traffic  and  subsequent  reconstruction  and/or  rehabilitation  activities  needs \nstrengthening.  Currently,  NHA  personnel  perform  this  role  on  an  ad  hoc  basis,  without \nmonitoring tools and specialized training in the management of road infrastructure in emergency \nsituations.  The  NHA\u2019s  disaster  management  capacity  needs  upgrading  to  be  systematic, \nprogrammatic, and responsive. \n \n11.  Apart from its interventions in road infrastructure development in Pakistan, ADB has \nbeen active in post-natural-disaster emergency recovery initiatives in the country. In 2005, ADB \nsupported the government\u2019s reconstruction efforts after the October 2005 earthquake through \nan emergency loan, grant, and technical assistance grant.9 In 2011 and 2015, ADB assisted the \ngovernment\u2019s reconstruction efforts after the 2010 and 2014 floods.10 ADB gained valuable \nexperience  in  implementing  loans  in  response  to  natural  disasters  through  these  projects, \nincluding (i) designing projects with a manageable number of components and implementing \nagencies, (ii) ensuring counterpart funding capacity and soundness of project costing, and \n(iii) adopting realistic time frames for land acquisition and resettlement activities. \n \n12.  The rehabilitation project will restore critical physical infrastructure to sustain livelihoods \nand access to markets, as well as build capacity in the NHA by (i) providing specialized training \nto its operations staff for the efficient management of traffic restoration and post-natural-disaster \nreconstruction activities, and (ii) operationalizing DMUs. As a highway infrastructure project, it is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 202011 and country partnership strategy, \n                                                \n8  Less 2 km under subproject ICB-N-03: Rehabilitation of Kohala\u2013Muzaffarabad Road Package-1, for which work is \nongoing, as a result of subsequent damage during the 2014 floods. \n9  ADB. 2005.

The impact of the rehabilitation project will be economic and social recovery in the \naffected areas of the 2010 floods. The outcome will be efficient and safe movement of traffic on \nthe national highways and efficient management of traffic restoration in emergencies. \n \nC.  Outputs \n14.  The outputs will include (i) 212 km of national highway network (and 33 bridges) repaired \nand rehabilitated, and (ii) DMUs established (in head office and 10 regional offices) and 15 DMU \nstaff trained on post-disaster traffic management. These outputs will restore critical physical \ninfrastructure to sustain livelihoods and access to markets, as well as build post-disaster traffic \nmanagement capacity in the NHA. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n15.  The project is estimated to cost $218.8 million (Table 1). ADB financing of $196.9 million \nwill be required for the project.

Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The NHA will be the executing agency. It has been implementing ADB-funded road \nprojects and has the necessary capacity to manage project implementation. It will establish a \nproject  steering  committee  to  provide  policy  direction  and  strategic  oversight.  The  project \nmanagement unit (PMU), established and staffed under the emergency reconstruction project,13 \nwill continue to be responsible for the day-to-day management of the rehabilitation project, \nthrough the project management consultants. Similarly, the environment and social unit (ESU) \nestablished  within  the  PMU  will  continue  to  fulfill  safeguard  requirements.  Financial \nmanagement, safeguards management, and contract administration and project implementation \ncapacity  will  be  augmented  through  individual  consultants  recruited  under  the  loan. \nThe proposed composition of the PMU is detailed in the PAM. Within the NHA, the procurement \nand contract administration department will coordinate and undertake procurement. \n \n19.  As  the  NHA  does  not  have  the  equipment  or  tools  to  monitor  post-disaster  traffic \nmanagement,  its  post-disaster  traffic  management  capacity  will  be  strengthened  under  a \nproposed two-pronged strategy. First, one international individual consultant will be engaged to \n(i)  assist  the  NHA  in  preparing  the  necessary  documentation  and  obtaining  approvals  for \nestablishing  DMUs,  (ii)  develop  (for  NHA  approval)  the  standard  operating  procedures  for \nDMUs, (iii) identify training sessions for NHA\u2019s nominated DMU staff through external training \nagency(ies)  and/or  individual  accredited  professionals,  and  (iv)  identify  software  and/or \nhardware to be procured (provide the required details and specifications) for establishing DMUs. \nSecond, (i) the NHA\u2019s nominated operations and dedicated staff will be trained on post-disaster \ntraffic management, and (ii) necessary hardware and/or software for the establishment of DMUs \nwill be procured. The NHA will retain the trained staff for post-disaster traffic management \nactivities. \n \n20.  Procurement of goods, works, and services will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2015, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). An initial procurement plan for the rehabilitation project is in \nTable 3. The contracts were packaged based on an assessment of the site area in view of the \nconstruction season and geographical location. In this procurement plan, of the 17 civil works \npackages, six contracts in two packages will be procured through international competitive \nbidding and 11 contracts through five packages will be procured through national competitive \n                                                \n13 The emergency reconstruction project\u2019s PMU is staffed and functional until June 2016, which is the end of the \ndefects notification period for contracts under the project. The NHA has confirmed that the same PMU will be \nretained to implement the rehabilitation project. \n ", "6 \nbidding. A firm will be recruited to provide construction supervision through a 90:10 quality- and \ncost-based  selection  method.  The  NHA  requested  retroactive  financing  and  advance \ncontracting, which has been adopted. Retroactive financing will be in accordance with the \nOperations Manual on Retroactive Financing.14 Retroactive financing for individual consultants \nwill  be  executed  through  reimbursement  arrangements  under  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2015, as amended from time to time). The government and the NHA have been \nadvised that approval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to finance the project. \n \n21.

The pavement design is based on  the Transport Research \nLaboratory\u2019s  Overseas  Road  Note  31.16 The  geometric  design  is  based  on  the  American \nAssociation  of  State  Highway  and  Transportation  Officials  policy  on  geometric  design  of \nhighways and streets.17 Bridges are designed in accordance with the West Pakistan Code of \nPractice for highway bridges 1967,18 and conform to the American Concrete Institute Code of \nPractice.19 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n23.  The  economic  and  financial  analysis  concluded  that  the  rehabilitation  project  is \neconomically viable, with an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 20%. Economic analysis \nwas undertaken at subproject level, with the EIRR estimated separately for the N-95, N-55, \nN-15, and N-50 sections. The analysis showed the N-55, N-15, and N-50 sections had EIRRs in \nexcess of the 12% threshold. The N-95 is justified by significant non-monetized benefits from \nreduced flood risk and improved resilience to climate change. Sensitivity testing showed that the \nproject is not very sensitive to reasonable changes in demand or investment cost. \n \n24.  The rehabilitation project is nonrevenue earning, and an adequacy assessment notes \nthat the NHA has the resources to sustain its operation and management. The allocation for \nroad  maintenance  from  the  federal  budget  has  been  insufficient,  and  while  the  road \nmaintenance fund has provided stable contributions, funding remains inadequate. The project \nwill help reduce the maintenance expenditure through rehabilitation and capacity enhancement, \ncreating savings for the NHA budget. At the same time, the NHA\u2019s planned optimization of its \ntoll collection would increase the existing road maintenance fund, making the national highway \nand motorway network more sustainable in the long term. \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  A financial management assessment of the NHA, carried out in May 2015, confirmed \nthat it has sufficient capacity to manage and maintain the accounting systems, financial controls, \nand audit arrangements required for the project. The NHA\u2019s financial accounting, auditing rules, \nand internal control systems follow generally accepted international accounting and auditing \npractices. The NHA maintains separate project records and accounts to identify the works, \ngoods,  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  financing  resources  received, \nexpenditures incurred for the project, and use of counterpart funds, including adequate internal \ncontrols  and  financial  reporting  arrangements.  The  project  accounts  and  related  financial \nstatements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  national  and  international  auditing \nstandards by the Auditor General of Pakistan and by an independent chartered accountant firm. \n                                                \n16 Overseas Centre, Transport Research Laboratory. 1993.

A  procurement  risk  assessment  of  NHA,  carried  out  in  June  2015,  assessed  the \nprocurement risk as moderate.20 It identified the main procurement management challenges for \nthe  NHA  as  (i)  weak  coordination  between  various  departments,  (ii)  complex  bureaucratic \nsystems  causing  project  start-up  delays,  and  (iii)  multiple  layers  of  review  and  approving \nauthorities. To mitigate these risks, advance procurement has been sought and a loan-financed \nprocurement  consultant  will  be  recruited  to  assist  the  NHA  in  overcoming  any  delays. \nThe procurement consultant will assist in the timely preparation of procurement documents and \navoid  delays  through  strong  coordination  between  various  departments.  The  project \nprocurement risk is classified category B. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  NHA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n28.  Pakistan has a 33% national poverty rate, with 21% of the population living below the \nextreme poverty line.21 Social and gender dimensions of the proposed project are classified as \ngeneral intervention. The project has indirect social and poverty impacts, so dedicated action \nplans will not be required. Based on the review of secondary information and data shared by the \nNHA, the proposed project will offer significant benefits for the affected population, including \nsafety in mobility, lowered transportation costs, reduced travel time, reduced transportation time \nfor edible and perishable agriculture products, and increased returns from the tourism industry. \nThe project will offer significant employment opportunities in construction and other related \nservices. The project will improve the quality of post-disaster response and provide immediate \nrelief to local commuters and the public in case of future flooding. \n \n29.  The  project  does  not  offer  direct  gender  benefits.  Given  better  connectivity  and \nincreased  access  to  social  services,  such  as  health,  education,  and  other  economic \nopportunities, the proposed project will indirectly benefit women and girls. According to ADB\u2019s \ngender mainstreaming guidelines, the project is classified as no gender elements and does not \nrequire a gender action plan. However, the project will undertake certain measures during \nproject implementation to ensure that women\u2019s issues and concerns are addressed and that \nwomen are not adversely impacted.22 \n \n30.  The  HIV  prevalence  rate  in  the  country  is  0.10%.  However,  the  potential  risks  of \nincreased transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections and/or communicable \ndiseases  are  always  a  concern.  The  main  modes  of  HIV  transmission  include  sexual \ntransmission, unsafe blood transfusion, and intravenous drug use. Information about the risks of \nspreading HIV has not been widely disseminated, and practices related to blood transfusion \nscreening and intravenous drug use are also not well regulated, particularly in rural areas. \nWhile there is no evidence suggesting that the project will increase HIV incidence during or after \nimplementation, any associated risks will be minimized through awareness campaigns targeting \nconstruction workers and local populations. The contractor will conduct the campaigns, with \n                                                \n20 ADB. 2015.

Such requirement will be included in the \ncivil works contract. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n31.  The project is classified category C for both involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples. Due diligence performed during the fact-finding mission confirmed that (i) the proposed \nsections of the national highways and 33 bridges fall within the existing right-of-way (ROW) \nowned by the NHA; and (ii) detailed designs have been completed and reviewed by the NHA\u2019s \ndesign review consultants, based on which new land acquisition is not expected for bridges (to \nbe constructed within the existing ROW) or for the carriageway of the highway sections. \n \n32.  A follow-up due diligence review conducted by ADB and the NHA in December 2015 \nconfirmed that while there are some encroachments to the ROW in a few sections of the roads \nand  bridges  to  be  rehabilitated,  impacts  on  these  structures  can  be  avoided  with  minor \nadjustments to the rehabilitation works similar to the approach taken under the emergency \nreconstruction project. Such flexibility will be indicated in the civil works contracts and will be \nclosely monitored during implementation by a resettlement specialist to be engaged by the \nPMU. The NHA has prepared a land acquisition and resettlement framework as an additional \nsafeguard measure in case of unforeseen impacts during project implementation. \n \n33.  The  project  has  been  categorized  B  for  environment.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination study has been performed to meet the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) and new national legal requirements, which was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website \non 26 October 2015. Climate change risks and mitigation measures and community concerns \nhave been considered in the project design. The environment of the candidate highway sections \nand bridges is affected. Rehabilitation of these highway sections and bridges will require limited \ncivil works across various sections of the highway alignments. The environmental impacts of the \nrehabilitation  activity,  such  as  soil  erosion,  dust,  and  noise  impacts  will  be  limited  to  the \nconstruction  phase.  The  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  will  include  measures  to \nminimize anticipated impacts during the construction phase. Prior to the construction of each \nroad section or bridge, contractors will update the EMP and incorporate it into a site-specific \nenvironmental management plan, which will be based on a risk assessment approach to select \nmitigation  measures  appropriate  for  the  impact  and  site.  The  construction  supervision \nconsultant, the ESU of the NHA, and ADB will closely monitor implementation of the site-specific \nenvironmental management plan. The NHA will submit semiannual environmental monitoring \nreports to ADB for disclosure on the ADB website. \n \n34.  The NHA\u2019s PMU and ESUs that worked on the emergency reconstruction project will \nalso be responsible for managing this project. The units have full-time environment and social \nsafeguards staff with sufficient experience of and familiarity with the ADB Safeguard Policy, and \nwill be assisted by a safeguards team from the project supervision consultants and a loan-\nfinanced individual safeguards consultant. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n35.  On completion, the efficient and safe movement of traffic on the rehabilitated project \nsections will contribute to the economic and social recovery of the affected population. This is \n ", "10 \nexpected  to  outweigh  the  cost  of  the  project.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are \nsummarized in Table 4 and detailed in the risk assessment and risk management plan.23 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nWeak financial  NHA has requested the government to equitize the debt and clean its \nmanagement  balance sheet. NHA will (i) expand the toll base, rationalize tolls, and \narrangements for road  allocate revenue to the road maintenance fund; and (ii) expand PPP-based \nmaintenance  road construction to reduce the government subsidy. \nLack of counterpart funds  The  government  will  prioritize  transport  infrastructure  in  the  country\u2019s \nresource  allocation.  NHA  will  expand  PPP-based  road  construction  to \nreduce the government subsidy. \nDelay in procurement  NHA  is  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s  procurement  guidelines  and  requirements. \nprocedures  ADB  will  provide  continuous  support  to  NHA  during  the  procurement \nprocess. NHA assures no political intervention in bidding for large-scale \npublic works. \nFrequent reassignment of  NHA staff nominated for training will be retained for a minimum period of \ntrained staff may reduce  3 years in the same position. \nbuilt capacity \nADB = Asian Development Bank, NHA = National Highway Authority, PPP = public\u2013private partnership. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff. \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n36.  The government and the NHA have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n37.  The government and the NHA have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n38.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$196,900,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Post-Flood  National  Highways \nRehabilitation Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n7 March 2016 \n                                                \n23 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nEconomic and social recovery in the affected areas of the 2010 floodsa \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nEfficient and safe  a.
