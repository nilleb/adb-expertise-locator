The  road  improvements  follow  existing  alignments.\nInitial  environmental  examinations  of  nine  selected  core  roads\nshow that the environmental impact is expected to be minimal.\n\nEfficient  road  transport  and,  in  particular  improved  access  is\nessential for poverty reduction and economic development in Viet\nNam. Past efforts in the road subsector have mainly been directed\ntoward  upgrading  the  national  highway  system,  while  also\nimproving  basic  access  to  the  rural  population  by  improving\ndistrict  and  commune  roads.  One  missing  part  in  the  network\ndevelopment strategy has been improvement of provincial roads,\nwhich  provide  access  to  the  provincial  capitals,  the  national\nhighway network, and the rural population through the district and\ncommune  roads.  Improving  the  provincial  roads  will  ensure\nrural\ntransport  and  communication  between \neffective \npopulation  connected  by  commune  and  provincial  roads  with\nmarket and distribution centers and the national highway network.\nAnother priority is continued reform and institutional strengthening\nof the Viet Nam Road Administration (VRA) to become a modern\nand efficient road management agency. The adopted sector loan\nmodality will support sustainable development of provincial roads\nand  allow  flexibility  in  selecting  prescreened  subprojects  forming\npart of the provincial road sector development plan.\n\nthe \n\nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  and  economic\ngrowth  by  improving  transport  efficiency.  The  objectives  of  the\nProject  are  to  (i)  improve  the  provincial  road  network  on  both\nsocial  and  economic  grounds,  (ii)  provide  improved  access  for\npoor  and  disadvantaged  groups  living  in  rural  communities,  (iii)\nstrengthen  asset  management  capacity  and  maintenance\nprograms  of  VRA  and  the  provincial  departments  of  transport\n(PDOTs),  (iv)  continue  institutional  strengthening  of  VRA  and\nimprove  governance  in  the  road  subsector,  (v)  strengthen  PDOT\ncapacity  to  prepare,  implement,  and  monitor  resettlement  and\nethnic minority development plans, and (vi) promote private sector\nparticipation \ninfrastructure  and\nmaintenance.\n\nthe  delivery  of \n\nroad \n\nin \n\n\fiii\n\nThe  Project  comprises  of  (i)  a  program  including  an  investment\nplan and policy framework to improve about 1,600 kilometers (km)\nof provincial roads in the 18 northern provinces; (ii) assistance to\nproject  management  unit  No.  5  (PMU-5)  and  the  PDOTs  to\nstrengthen their capacity to prepare and implement improvements\nto  and  maintenance  of  provincial  roads;  (iii)  development  and\nintroduction  of  an  action  plan  to  implement  a  road  fund  scheme;\n(iv) assistance to introduce new regulation and further institutional\nstrengthening  of  VRA;  (v)  assistance  to  implement  and  monitor\nresettlement  and  ethnic  minority  development  plans;  and  (vi)\nconsulting  services \nimplementation,  and\nfor  preparation, \nsupervision  of  civil  works;  preparation  of  additional  subprojects;\nand capacity building of the PDOTs.\n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $100.0  million\nequivalent.

The poverty impact ratios for four typical\nroads  are  estimated  to  range  from  0.32  to  0.68,  indicating  the\nfocus on the poorer provinces.\n\n\fv\n\n\f1.\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\nloan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Provincial Roads Improvement Sector Project.\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nViet Nam has a relatively extensive road network, but the quality of its roads is generally\n2.\npoor. Recognizing this impediment to economic development and poverty reduction, the Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB), along with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and\nthe  World  Bank  (WB),  became  involved  in  the  road  subsector  in  the  early  1990s.  Priority  was\ngiven to improving national highway 1, which over its 2,200 kilometers (km) length connects the\nborder of the People\u2019s Republic of China in the north to the southernmost tip of the country. In\nthree  subsequent  loans,1  ADB  financed  improvements  of  various  sections  of  the  highway.\nRealizing the need to improve access for the rural population, components for improvement of\nprovincial district and commune roads were also included in two of these loans. Emphasis was\nalso  given  to  institutional  development  with  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  start  the  process  of\ndeveloping  the  newly  created  (1998)  Viet  Nam  Road  Administration  (VRA)  into  a  modern\ninstitution  and  to  develop  the  policy  base  for  sustainable  development  of  roads  in  Viet  Nam.\nADB also helped finance improvements to two high priority Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS)\nroad improvement projects.2\n\n3.\nNow  that  the  improvements  of  national  highway  1  are  either  completed  or  under  way,\nattention has shifted to other road priorities, specifically provincial, district, and commune roads.\nWhile ADB, the Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom, JBIC,\nJapan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  and  WB  have  shown  considerable  interest  in\nimproving  district  and  commune  roads,  little  attention  was  paid  to  improving  the  connecting\nprovincial  roads.  To  address  this  missing  part  of  the  network  development  strategy,  the\nGovernment  of  Viet  Nam  asked  ADB  to  provide  project  preparatory  TA3  covering  preliminary\ndesign;  economic  analysis;  and  environmental,  social,  poverty,  and  other  studies  needed  to\nprepare the proposed Project for provincial roads in the northern part of the country, targeting\nthree  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  poorest  regions.  Under  that  TA,  a  provincial  road  subsector  development\nplan (PRSDP) was prepared. The Government also has a transport investment program, which\nmeets  the  priority  needs  of  the  national  economy.  While  the  Government  has  shown\ncompetence  in  implementing  previous  projects,  a  sector  loan  is  considered  appropriate.  The\nFact-Finding Mission visited Viet Nam from 14 May to 1 June 20014 and subsequent missions\nwere  fielded  in  July  and  August  2001  to  conduct  further  policy  dialogue  on  institutional\ndevelopment.  The  Appraisal  Mission  was  fielded  from  9  to  18  October  2001.  This  report  is\nbased  on  the  missions\u2019  findings;  discussions  with  Government  officials  and  staff  from\n\n                  \n\n1  Loan  1272-VIE: Road Improvement Project,  for  $120  million,  approved  on  23  November  1993;  Loan  1487-VIE:\nSecond Road Improvement Project, for $120 million, approved on 21 November 1996; and Loan 1653-VIE: Third\nRoad Improvement Project, for $130 million, approved on 10 December 1998.\n\n2  Loan 1660-VIE: GMS: Phnom Penh-Ho Chi Minh City Road Improvement Project, for $100.0 million, approved on\n15 December 1998; and Loan 1728-VIE: East-West Corridor Project, for $25.0 million, approved on 20 December\n1999.\n\n3  TA 3455-VIE: Provincial Roads Improvement Project, for $1.0 million, approved on 14 June 2000.\n4  The processing team comprised T.

Chin-Yee,  Poverty  Specialist;  P.  Dutt,  Transport  Specialist;  and  L.  D.\nThang, Project Implementation Officer from Viet Nam Resident Mission.\n\n\f2\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nmultilateral  and  bilateral  agencies,  including  DFID,  JBIC,  JICA,  and  WB;  and  the  findings  and\nrecommendations of the feasibility study. The project framework is in Appendix 1.\n\nA. \n\nThe Transport Sector\n\n1. \n\nGeneral\n\n4.\nViet  Nam  is  a  poor  country.  Of  the  total  population  of  73  million,  some  37  percent  live\nbelow the poverty line (1998).5 Although poverty has declined during the last decade, the rate of\ndecline  and  the  incidence  vary  greatly  in  the  country.  Three  regions  account  for  the  largest\nproportion of poor; two are located in the northern part of the country. Urbanization is starting to\ngrow rapidly, but about 80 percent of the population still live in rural areas. Poverty is largely a\nrural phenomenon with 90 percent of the poor living in rural areas and 34 percent of the rural\npopulation living below the poverty line. However, the urban poor are also vulnerable, suffering\nfrom  unemployment,  limited  access  to  health  and  education,  and  poor  living  conditions.  This\nproblem is being tackled through various assistance and Government projects. Large disparities\nexist between ethnic minority groups and kinh, the national ethnic majority. In 1998, 31 percent\nof  kinh  were  living  below  the  poverty  line,  compared  with  75  percent  of  the  other  53  ethnic\nminorities. In addition, the actual gains in poverty reduction are fragile as many households are\nclassified as just slightly above the poverty line and a small deterioration in their living standard\nis likely to pull them back below.\n\nSeveral  studies  of  income  poverty6  indicate  that  access  to  physical  infrastructure,\n5.\nincluding roads, is one of the most influential factors in reducing poverty. Transport affects the\ngeneral  welfare  of  the  poor  either  directly  or  indirectly  depending  on  the  activities  involved.\nExperience  shows  that  road  transport  often  plays  an  important  role  in  the  income  generation\nand  redistribution  process  with  direct  effects,  such  as  providing  basic  access  to  education,\nhealth, and markets, and improving access to social and economic opportunities, including labor\nand product markets, schools, and clinics. Road transport also contributes to empowerment of\nthe poor enabling their participation in community and wider decision making, and overcoming\nsocial, cultural, and physical barriers, including geographical isolation. Adequate road transport\nmakes it possible for constituents to get to meeting places and town centers, facilitates the flow\nof information, and so facilitates political and social participation.\n\nWith  the  rapidly  increasing  transformation  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economy  from  a  centrally\n6.\nplanned  to  a  socialist  market  economy  system,  the  Government  continues  to  reorient  its\npolicies;  reorganize  public  administration;  and  deregulate  industry,  liberalize  prices,  and\ncommercialize state enterprises in all sectors, including transport. The transition of Viet Nam\u2019s\ntransport  sector  requires  that  transport  agencies  and  operators  continue  to  adapt  to  the  new\neconomic  environment  to  improve  transport  efficiency  and  to  create  an  institutional,  legal,\nfinancial, and policy framework conducive to sustainable economic growth.\n\n2. \n\nTransport Policy and Institutions\n\n7.\nAt the highest level, the National Assembly makes decisions on major economic policies,\nand  approves  the  national  plan  and  state  budget,  prepared  by  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and\n\n5 Based on Viet Nam living standards surveys (1998) of the General Statistics Office. The poverty line is defined as\n\n6 For example, see case studies undertaken in Bangladesh, Ghana, India, Morocco, and Viet Nam, prepared by the\n\n                  \n\n$128 per capita per year in 1998.\n\nWorld Bank.\n\n\f3\n\nInvestment (MPI). Major policy decisions, transport plans, and large projects, including those for\nexternal  financing,  are  reviewed  by  the  National  Appraisal  Committee  headed  by  the  MPI\nminister.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  is  responsible  for  the  overall  management  and\ndevelopment of the transport sector (Appendix 2). Four modal administrations within MOT, i.e.,\nVRA,  Viet  Nam  Railways,  Viet  Nam  Inland  Waterway  Administration,  and  Viet  Nam  National\nMaritime Bureau are responsible for roads, railways, inland waterways, and ports respectively.7\nMOT  has  been  slowly  adjusting  its  internal  organization  to  establish  well-defined  modal\nresponsibilities  and  support  departments  in  all  subsectors,  but  according  to  Viet  Nam  20108\nmore needs to be done especially for roads, such as institutional development and rehabilitation\nof provincial roads. The Planning and Investment Department of MOT undertakes overall policy\ncoordination, programming, and budgeting; and sets investment priorities in the transport sector\nwith support from its Center for Statistics and a number of other institutions.\n\n8.\nAt  the  provincial  and  district  level,  planning  and  programming  for  transport  sector\ninvestments  and  operations  are  vested  with  the  provincial  departments  of  transport  (PDOTs),\nwhich  are responsible to  their  respective provincial people\u2019s committees (PPCs).9  The  PDOTs\nhave no direct responsibility to MOT except for the implementation of some road works on the\nnational  highways,  but  they  have  links  to  MOT  to  carry  out  certain  works  such  as  those\nproposed  in  the  provinces  under  the  Project.  While  the  PDOTs  carry  out  traffic  counts,  these\ncounts are not yet fully developed into a structured system. Similarly planning and programming\nfunctions within MOT are not yet fully developed to include modern economic analysis methods\nand cost recovery systems in transport sector planning and project selection. Methodology and\nsystems are slowly being introduced through MOT staff participation in recently completed and\nongoing ADB and WB-funded TA that include transport-related studies, seminars, lectures, and\nstudy  tours.  Formal  training  and  a  clear  definition  of  administrative  responsibility  and  authority\nare required for a full appreciation of such techniques and systems.\n\n3. \n\nRoad Network and Traffic\n\n9.\nViet Nam\u2019s transport system is extensive, comprising about 205,000 km of roads, 2,600\nkm  of  railways,  19,500  km  of  navigable  waterways,  seven  main  ports,  three  international\nairports, and 13 smaller airports serving domestic traffic. The core road network is classified into\nnational, provincial, district, and urban roads and others (Appendix 3). The road density of 0.36\nkm/square  km  compares  favorably  with  that  of  other  developing  countries.10  Road  transport  is\nthe  dominant  mode,  carrying  about  70  percent  of  freight  ton-km  and  about  80  percent  of\npassenger-km.  The  demand  for  road  transport  is  increasing  rapidly,  but  traffic  varies\nconsiderably between and within regions. From 1990 to 1997, total transport demand increased\nat  an  average  annual  rate  of  26  percent  for  passengers  and  35  percent  for  freight.  Over  the\nsame period the vehicle fleet increased at an average annual rate of 9 percent (Supplementary\nAppendix  A),  and  as  of  May  2001  reached  around  500,000  motor  vehicles  (cars,  pickups,\nbuses,  and  trucks).  Of  the  approximately  254,000  trucks  of  all  types  in  the  country,  about  30\npercent belong to the private sector. Overall vehicle density, remains, however, low except for\nthe  high  number  of  two-wheeled  vehicles  (7.0  million).  The  latter  vehicles  cause  problems  in\nterms of capacity utilization, traffic hazards, and increasing number of accidents particularly in\nurban  areas;  their  popularity  and  use  is  growing  rapidly  in  rural  areas.  The  recorded  road\naccidents increased 3.8 times from 1990 to 1999 (para. 48).\n\n                  \n\n7  The Civil Aviation Administration was established in February 1993 and now reports directly to MOT.\n8  Viet Nam 2010, Entering the 21st Century, Viet Nam Development Report 2001. ADB, United Nations Development\n\nProgramme (UNDP), and WB. 2001.\n\n9  The PPCs are responsible for the government administration of the provinces.\n10 Thailand (0.20) and Malaysia (0.25).\n\n\f4\n\nAlthough  the  entire  road  network  is  relatively  extensive,  it  is  substantially  deficient  in\n10.\nquality,  mainly  because  much  of  the  infrastructure  in  the  northern  part  of  the  country  was\noriginally constructed 50 to 100 years ago. Even with some recent improvements, maintenance\nand  rehabilitation  are  still  constrained  by  a  lack  of  resources.  While  geometric  standards  are\ngenerally  adequate,  pavements  were  not  rehabilitated  when  needed,  the  residual  strength  of\nmost  roads  is  very  poor,  and  while  the  riding  surface  is  fair  because  of  continual  but  costly\npothole  patching  and  resealing,  major  maintenance,  rehabilitation,  or  improvement  is  urgently\nneeded. In all, 57 percent of national roads and about 25 percent of provincial roads are still in\npoor  condition.  District  and  commune  roads  are  usually  earth  or  gravel  surfaced,  in  poor\ncondition,  and  not  passable  to  motorized  traffic,  especially  during  the  rainy  season,  which\nmakes access to many villages difficult. Some mountainous areas are still inaccessible by road.\nMotor vehicles cannot access 606 (6 percent) of the commune centers.\n\n4. \n\nRoad Management and Administration\n\na. \n\nRegulation and Organization\n\n11. While VRA was established in 1993 by decree (interim regulation), the new Road Traffic\nAct  was  passed  in  June  2001  and  is  expected  to  come  into  force  on  1  January  2002.  This\nclearly  defines  the  roles  of  MOT  and  other  agencies,  including  at  the  provincial  level,  in  the\nareas of road planning, construction, maintenance, road transport operations, and road safety.\nMOT is responsible for planning the national road and expressway network and the Government\nis responsible for its approval. Planning for provincial roads is the responsibility of the PDOTs;\nplans  are  submitted  to  the  PPCs  for  approval  after  obtaining  MOT  recommendations.  The\nplanning of urban roads similarly is carried out by the PPCs and submitted to the Government\nfor  approval  after  getting  recommendations  and  advice  from  both  MOT  and  the  Ministry  of\nConstruction.  The  planning  of  district  and  lower  roads  is  carried  out  by  agencies  at  that\nadministrative level and approved by the PPCs. The road construction program for the national\nroad  network  is  formulated  by  MOT  and  approved  by  the  Government,  while  that  for  the\nprovincial road network is formulated by the PDOTs and approved by the PPCs after obtaining\nthe  written  advice  of  MOT.  MOT  is  also  responsible  for  stipulating  the  general  norms  and\nstandards for road management and maintenance of public roads, but is directly responsible for\nthe maintenance program of only the national road network. Responsibility for the maintenance\nprogram of provincial roads is with the PDOTs. The budget for maintenance of provincial roads\nis decided by MOF and MPI after consultation with the PDOTs. MOT is also responsible for (i)\nimplementing  road  safety  engineering,  driver  training  and  testing,  vehicle  inspection,  and  road\nsafety research; (ii) determining vehicle load limits, and for driver licenses including regulating\ndriver instruction and driver testing; and (iii) setting the parameters for the issuance of licenses\nfor  passenger  and  goods  transport,  as  well  as  for  the  management  of  bus  and  truck  stations,\nalthough the PPCs actually grant licenses to operate transport services and stations.\n\n12.\nBecause  the  Road  Traffic  Act  does  not  spell  out  the  role  of  VRA,  a  new  permanent\ndecree  is  needed  to  define  the  functions  and  roles  of  VRA,  which  was  earlier  governed  by\ntemporary decrees. This new decree will replace Decree 07/CP (1993), which established VRA,\nand  Decree  167  (1999),  which  decentralized  road  management.  This  is  especially  critical\nbecause  the  two  decrees  differ  significantly  on  VRA\u2019s  functions.  Under  Decree  07,  VRA  is\nresponsible  for  managing  national  road  infrastructure  and  administering  road  transport\nthroughout  Viet  Nam.  However,  under  Decree  167,  VRA  is  directly  responsible  for  managing\nonly sections of the national roads as entrusted by MOT and the remainder of the national road\nsections are assigned to the control of the PPCs. VRA currently directly manages approximately\n8,000 km representing about 50 percent of the national road network.\n\n\f5\n\nVRA  is  led  by  a  chairperson  and  has  about  17,775  staff  organized  on  a  decentralized\n13.\nbasis (Appendix 4). It (or its subsidiaries) carries out road maintenance, road toll collection, road\nconstruction, road transport operations, river crossing operations, enforcement of vehicle weight\nlimits, transport consultancies, education and training, engineering design, project management,\nand  quarry  exploitation.  However,  VRA  has  several  weaknesses.  The  TA  component  of  Loan\n1487  (footnote  1)  found  that  (i)  road  network  management  responsibilities  are  unclear  and\noverlapping;  (ii)  strategic  planning  and  programming  for  roads  is  lacking;  (iii)  performance  is\ninput  and  output  driven  instead  of  being  driven  by  user  or  outcome  needs;  and  (iv)  VRA  is\nlacking key knowledge and capacity.\n\n14.\nVRA  does  not  currently  fully  execute  the  tasks  and  functions  specified  in  Decree  07.\nAlthough  the  decree  vests  VRA  with  the  responsibility  for  administering  roads  throughout  Viet\nNam, including road traffic and transport development planning and strategies; VRA information,\ndatabases, and capacity to develop plans, strategies, standards, mechanisms, and policies are\npoor  and  have  not  been  fully  executed.  VRA  does  not  have  a  strong  role  in  influencing  road\ninvestment  decisions.  The  project  management  units  (PMUs)  manage  projects  funded  by\ninternational  agencies,  as  well  as  implement  road  rehabilitation,  upgrading,  and  new\nconstruction  on  national  roads  with  little  or  no  VRA  involvement.  Even  in  the  field  of  routine\nmaintenance, VRA is directly responsible for the routine maintenance of only 50 percent of the\nnational road network. The remainder is carried out by the PDOTs, which are also responsible\nfor  the  provincial  road  network  in  their  respective  provinces.  The  regional  road  maintenance\nunits  (RRMUs)  under  VRA  carry  out  routine  maintenance  either  themselves  or  through  their\nroad  repair  and  management  companies  based  on  instructions  from  VRA  or  MOT,  with  the\nGovernment regulating the price.\n\n15. With  the  decentralization  brought  about  by  Decree  167,  no  agency  has  taken\nresponsibility for strategic planning and programming for roads. Planning is primarily a process\nof affiliated units determining local needs with the resulting plan being a consolidation of bottom\nup  inputs  without  adequate  analysis  of  priorities  or  standards  against  which  to  evaluate\nproposals. Although Decree 07 intends for the whole road network to be managed in a unified\nmanner, regardless of the distinction between the road networks and their sources of funding,\nVRA does not  provide either the management or input to budgeting to support this goal. VRA\nperformance monitoring is also weak. The road condition of only 2,500 km of national highway\nhas been evaluated. Generally VRA measures its performance in terms of inputs and outputs,\ne.g.,  amount  of  money  spent  or  number  of  licenses  issued  instead  of  outcomes  like  road\ncondition, impact on users, etc. As MOT has limited planning skills, its coverage, and detailed\nplanning  and  programming  function  for  roads  will  be  transferred  to  VRA.  VRA  is  developing  a\ncomprehensive  road  database  and  is  gaining  experience  through  technology  transfer  from\ninternational consultants. However, VRA\u2019s institutional development needs to be intensified to (i)\noperationalize  VRA  as  the  road  infrastructure  and  road  transport  planning  agency,  and  (ii)\nstrengthen and build capacity at VRA in planning and programming for both maintenance and\ncapital investment activities. This is important because although presently the capital investment\nneeds and priorities are obvious, they will become less so as implementation of the high priority\nprojects is progressively completed.\n\nb. \n\nMaintenance\n\n16.\nMOT through VRA and the RRMUs is responsible for programming the maintenance of\nthe  national  road  network  and  provides  advice  to  the  PDOTs  on  maintenance  of  provincial\nroads.  MOT  issues  technical  standards  and  guidelines  for  all  road  classes.  The  road\nmaintenance companies under the RRMUs are responsible for maintaining major national roads\n(46 percent of the national road network), while the PDOTs are responsible for the remainder of\n\n\f6\n\nthe  national  road  network  and  the  provincial,  district,  and  commune  roads.  While  this  is  not  a\nvery efficient or consistent organization for national road maintenance management, alternative\narrangements  with  VRA  playing  a  key  role  are  being  developed  and  discussed  with  the\nGovernment.\n\nA  study  on  developing  a  road  maintenance  strategy11  estimated  that  maintenance\n17.\nexpenditures for national and provincial roads cover between 30 and 50 percent depending on\nthe source; thus, maintenance on most of these road networks is being neglected. Despite the\nbudget  problem,  the  PDOTs  and  RRMUs  have  mobilized  existing  resources  to  maintain  vital\nsections  of  these  roads.  Substandard  maintenance  has  resulted  in  relatively  high  surface\nroughness  levels,  even  soon  after  repairs.  In  addition,  the  planning  and  programming  for\nmaintenance  does  not  rely  on  systematic  information  on  road  conditions  and  completed\nmaintenance  activities.  An  appropriate  road  maintenance  management  system  is  needed  to\nhelp  planners  of  VRA,  RRMUs,  and  PDOTs  decide  on  major  maintenance  intervention  levels,\ntiming,  and  monitoring.  The  study  undertook  a  detailed  evaluation  of  selected  national  and\nprovincial roads, and recommended that a road inventory management system be put in place\nand used as a basis for investment and maintenance planning. Operationally, WB is providing\nequipment  and  TA  to  the  RRMUs  to  implement  maintenance  and  minor  road  works  on  a  pilot\nbasis. For rural and provincial road maintenance, past ADB projects have assisted in developing\ninitiatives to prepare a maintenance plan and budget, and suggest alternative funding sources.\nHowever, much remains to be done, particularly to strengthen road sector institutions.\n\nc. \n\nConstruction Industry\n\nPrior to the early 1990s, all major road and bridge construction works were carried out\n18.\nby  force  account  through  six  construction  corporations  directly  under  MOT.  Minor  works  were\nundertaken  by  the  RRMUs,  either  through  contract  or  force  account.  Since  then,  the  MOT\nconstruction companies started operating on a commercial basis and formed joint ventures with\ninternational  contractors  for  most  of  the  large  internationally  funded  construction  works  at  the\nnational  level.  These  joint  ventures  seem  to  have  successfully  completed  large  projects,\nalthough  some  concerns  about  effective  implementation  of  agreements  between  the  joint\nventure partners have been raised. For domestically financed or internationally funded smaller\nworks that allowed local contractors, effective competition has been obtained among the state-\nowned contractors and private small contractors operating autonomously. Thus, relatively large\nparticipation  of  private  sector  entities12  has  been  observed  under  ADB-  and  WB-financed\ncomponents  for  provincial,  district,  and  commune  roads,  which  are  similar  to  those  under  the\nProject.\n\n19. WB  has  recently  raised  concerns  about  the  award  of  contracts  to  state-owned\nenterprises  (SOEs),  and  award  of  civil  work  contracts  to  private  sector  entities  under  the\nongoing  Second  Rural  Transport  Project  is  conditional.  A  recent  ADB  mission13  advised  the\nGovernment  about  the  constraints  in  awarding  the  works  to  SOEs  and  has  proposed\nconsideration of award on a case-by-case basis until a policy framework is agreed. To address\nthe  issue  of  an  appropriate  policy  framework  for  SOEs  active  in  the  transport  sector,  a  small-\nscale  TA  is  expected  to  be  approved  in  December  2001.  This  TA,  which  will  be  implemented\n\n                  \n\nViet Nam. Funded by DFID (UK).\n\n11 Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick. 1996. Study of Investment and Maintenance Strategy for National and Provincial Roads:\n\n12 Under the ongoing WB-financed Second Rural Transport Project, private sector entities had won about 75 percent\n\nof the contracts, as reported at project appraisal in October 2001.\n\n13 A  Central  Operations  Services  Office  mission  (in  December  2000)  discussed  the  issue  of  SOEs  with  the\nGovernment  and  followed  up  with  a  letter  to  the  MPI  minister  regarding  the  interim  process  to  be  adopted  for\napproving SOEs for contracts under ADB loans, until an overall strategy for SOE restructuring is agreed.\n\n\f7\n\nduring the first half of 2002, will study the SOEs, and provide recommendations on policy and\nprocurement-related matters. Contractors affiliated with the military are not eligible to bid under\nADB-financed loans due to the preferential treatment they receive in the purchase of subsidized\nraw materials, fuels, equipment, etc.\n\n5. \n\nRoad Sector Revenues and Expenditures\n\n20.\nRoad  revenues  are  derived  from  a  wide  range  of  road-user  charges.  These  include\nitems that are (i) purchase related (import duties on new vehicles, and ownership transfer taxes\nwhen  vehicles  change  hands);  (ii)  ownership  related  (annual  registration  fees);  and  (iii)  use\nrelated  (import  duties  on  spare  parts,  tires,  and  lubricants).  In  addition,  the  pump  price  of  fuel\nused  for  road  transport  includes  an  import  tax  (55  percent  for  gasoline  and  20  percent  for\ndiesel). The luxury tax, introduced in January 1996, is set at 15 percent per liter of the after-tax\nimport price of gasoline and of imported vehicles. In January 1995, the Government introduced\na  surcharge  on  fuel  (presently  D500  per  liter)  used  in  road  transport,  based  on  ADB-financed\nTA.14 The purpose is to generate funds for the regular repair and maintenance of the country\u2019s\nentire transport system. Of the D500 levy on fuel, approximately D200 is notionally allocated to\nVRA for recurrent expenses. The annual revenue generated from the fuel levy is D2,200 billion,\nbut only about D900 billion (or 41 percent) is actually allocated for road maintenance. The actual\nmaintenance  requirements  are  about  D1,800  billion  per  annum.  The  total  revenue  collected\nfrom  road  users,  thus  exceeds  by  a  substantial  margin  the  resources  allocated  by  the\nGovernment to recurrent road maintenance expenditure.\n\n21.\nInvestment  in  the  transport  sector  has  been  about  one  fourth  of  public  investment  in\nrecent years or about 1.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).15 Most capital expenditure\nis funded by external sources, while recurrent expenditures are met through the local budget. As\nanother  revenue  mechanism,  VRA  usually  charges  a  toll  when  a  road  is  improved  through\nresealing  or  overlays,  part  of  which  goes  into  the  VRA  budget  for  maintenance  and\nimprovement works. Nevertheless, the total funds available to VRA are less than half of what it\nneeds. VRA has proposed that the Government increase the fuel surcharge from D500 to D900,\nwith  D200  of  this  going  to  VRA;  this  is  currently  part  of  the  road  fund  debate.  Lately  VRA\nincreased  the  number  of  toll  stations  to  collect  more  revenues,  but  these  had  to  be  reduced\nfollowing  strong  complaints  from  road  users.  VRA  estimates  that  these  measures  would\nproduce  enough  revenue  to  meet  their  budget  requirements  including  payback  of  commercial\nloans presently used to meet budget shortfalls.16 All these proposals were made as part of an\neffort  by  VRA  to  establish  a  dedicated  road  fund  or  similar,  which  is  being  considered  by  the\nGovernment.\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n22. With a goal of significantly increasing real per capita GDP, the Government recognizes\nthat  significant  constraints  must  be  overcome.  The  major  constraints  are  (i)  the  low  level  of\ndomestic  savings,  (ii)  inadequate  and  dilapidated  physical  infrastructure,  (iii)  the  insufficiently\ndeveloped  financial  system,  (iv)  the  regulatory  and  institutional  framework  that  is  not  yet  fully\n\n                  \n\n1993.\n\nProgram (2000-2010).\n\n14 TA  1996-VIE:Institutional Strengthening of the Ministry of Transport,  for  $1.9  million,  approved  on  29  November\n\n15 JICA. 2000. VITRANSS Summary Final Report. National Transport Development Strategy including an Investment\n\n16 Through  Regulation  3170-KTN  Viet  Nam  Road  Administration  is  allowed  to  finance  its  budget  requirements\nthrough  borrowings  from  state-owned  banks.  These  loans  are  repaid  through  funds  generated  by  the  fuel\nsurcharge and tolls.\n\n\f8\n\ncompatible  with  the  needs  of  a  market-oriented  economy  or  of  the  private  sector,  and  (v)  the\nlack of managerial and technical skills required by a market-based system.\n\n23.\nThe Government is implementing a transport sector reform program that aims to improve\nefficiency  and  create  an  institutional  and  financial  framework  conducive  to  economic  growth.\nThe  major  institutional  reform  is  the  MOT  reorganization,  creating  four  modal  administrations\nwith  broad  responsibilities  over  their  respective  subsectors,  and  VRA  responsible  for  the  road\ninfrastructure and road transport subsector (para. 12). The Government intends to (i) strengthen\nVRA by issuing new decrees and regulations; (ii) increase maintenance funding, and introduce\nmodern road maintenance management systems; (iii) strengthen planning capacity and build a\nmodern  road  asset  database;  and  (iv)  improve  road  safety.  MOT  and  VRA  have  planned\nsubstantial  investments  for  the  next  10  years  (footnote  15)  costing  about  $11,500  million\nequivalent.\n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Road Subsector\n\nExternal assistance to the road subsector is substantial and has contributed extensively\n24.\nto its development. The subsector has benefited from about 50 projects including both TA and\ninfrastructure  development.  TA  has  focused  on  feasibility  studies,  area  and  national  master\nplans,  and  institutional  development  and  capacity  building.  Hard  infrastructure  focused  initially\non  improving  the  national  highways  and  later  improving  the  provincial,  district,  and  commune\nroads.  While  the  total  cost  of  these  TAs  and  infrastructure  projects  has  not  been  calculated,\ncommitted  external  assistance17  for  physical  rehabilitation  of  the  roads18  totals  about  $4,000\nmillion (Appendix 5).\n\n25.\nIn  the  area  of  institutional  and  capacity  building,  the  focus  is  on  (i)  road  maintenance\ninvestment  planning,  and  resource  allocation  with  the  pilot  implementation  of  software  to  help\ncarry out effective and appropriate strategic planning and programming, as well as identification\nof  mechanisms  to  obtain  sustainable  funding  for  maintenance  activities;  (ii)  road  and  bridge\nmaintenance  management  through  efficient  and  effective  management  of  operations  and\nfinancial  management;  (iii)  organizational  development  of  VRA  by  identifying  options  to\ntransform  VRA  into  an  effective  road  management  organization;  (iv)  human  resource\ndevelopment by assessing VRA\u2019s training needs; and (v) introduction of information technology\nto support VRA management and operational functions. Under TA 1996 (footnote 14), most key\nrecommendations were implemented according to the TA completion report prepared in August\n2001.\n\n26.\nOverall  aid  coordination  is  managed  by  periodic  aid  transport  sector  partnership\nmeetings.  These  meetings  allow  the  exchange  of  information  and  views  regarding  funding\nagency  activities  and  the  Government\u2019s  goals  and  objectives.  These  meetings  are  interactive\nand provide a good basis for more detailed subsector meetings.\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\nADB  operations  in  Viet  Nam  resumed  in  1993;  two  projects  have  been  completed.\n27.\nHowever,  project  preparation,  civil  works  procurement  and  consultant  selection,  and\nimplementation are being delayed by a number of common factors. The most important of these\nis the need to obtain high-level approvals, often at the Prime Minister\u2019s level, for relatively minor\nactivities  and  matters.  Actual  project  implementation,  once  preparation  and  procurement  have\n\n                  \n\n17 As of 31 December 2000. It includes external assistance from ADB, Australia, DFID, JBIC, and WB.\n18 Includes assistance to national highways, provincial and rural roads, and urban transport infrastructure.\n\n\f9\n\nbeen  completed,  proceeds  relatively  well  although  problems  within  the  Ministry  of  Finance\nregarding delayed payments to contractors are being addressed, if contractors\u2019 cash flows are\nto  be  maintained.  ADB  has  been  helping  the  Government  reduce  the  impact  of  this  problem,\nthrough TA for capacity building in financial management.19\n\n28.\nMOT and the Government are aware of these problems and are addressing them. The\nGovernment has issued a decree20 and related implementation circular21 that clearly spells out\ninternal procedures including time limits for disbursement approval by the parties concerned and\ndirect access to imprest accounts by the executing agencies. A manual on project disbursement\nand  accounting  under  ADB-financed  projects  was  prepared  and  approved  by  the  Ministry  of\nFinance for use on all ADB-funded projects.\n\nThe  lessons  learned  in  the  context  of  the  ADB-financed  projects  are  that  each  step  of\n29.\nthe preparation, procurement, land acquisition and resettlement, and implementation processes\nrequire detailed attention by MOT and ADB if the project is to proceed in the form planned and\nis not to be delayed. For procurement, this is being done through advance action for selection of\nsupervision  consultants  and  procurement  of  civil  works  contractors.  Special  attention  is  also\ngiven  to  appropriate  prequalification  of  civil  works  contractors.  In  line  with  its  policy  on\ndecentralization,  the  PDOTs  will  be  responsible  for  awarding  civil  works  contracts  with  the\nconcurrence of MOT. This significantly reduces the levels of approval previously required. For\nland  acquisition  and  resettlement,  using  the  experience  gained  from  previous  ADB-  and  WB-\nfunded projects, training was provided to the PDOTs, which now ensure that these activities are\nwell planned and resourced, commence early, and are closely monitored. A resettlement policy\nframework  and  detailed  resettlement  plans  (RPs)  were  prepared  for  the  core  roads,  in  close\ncoordination with PMU5 and the PDOTs. To properly implement the RPs in time for civil works\nto begin on the core roads, PMU5 and the PDOTs will be staffed with competent resettlement\nspecialists  immediately  after  mobilization  of  the  project  construction  supervision  consultants.\nThrough advance procurement action and implementation of subproject RPs, the Project\u2019s civil\nworks  for  core  roads  should  be  able  to  commence  shortly  after  the  project  loan  is  declared\neffective.  People  affected  by  the  Project  will  be  identified,  compensated,  and  relocated  in\naccordance  with  the  resettlement  plans;  and  a  clear  right-of-way  will  be  available  before\ncommencing civil works.\n\n30.\nADB\u2019s completed first road sector project and the provincial road component of the Third\nRoad Improvement Project required very little resettlement. RP preparation and implementation\nunder  the  Second  and  Third  Road  Improvement  projects  were  inadequate.  The  project\u2019s\nexecuting  agency  did  not  have  adequate  capacity  to  plan  and  implement  resettlement  to\ninternational standards. Sites were handed over to contractors long before the affected people\nwere properly compensated and resettled. Furthermore, although the RP under the Third Road\nImprovement  Project  provided,  for  compensation  to  be  paid  at  replacement  cost,  payment  for\nland  was  made  using  Government  rates  rather  than  market  rates.  As  a  result,  those  affected\ncould  not  buy  replacement  land  and  asked  the  Government  to  provide  them  with  land.  The\nGovernment reassessed compensation amounts and provided a grant to relocating households\nsufficient  for  them  to  be  able  to  purchase  replacement  land.  Although  resettlement  under  this\nProject  will  be  minimized,  people  will  lose  land  and  houses.  Provision  will  be  made  to  plan,\nimplement,  and  monitor  the  resettlement;  provide  training  to  the  PMUs  and  PDOTs;  and  help\nensure that the requirements of the resettlement policy framework and plans are adhered to.\n\n19 The  TA,  which  commenced  in  late  1998  and  was  implemented  over  12  months,  assisted  the  Government  to\n\nimprove the national budget allocation system, and streamlined fund-flow procedures.\n\n                  \n\n20 Decree 87/CP.\n21 Circular 81/1998/TTLT-BTC-NHNN.\n\n\f10\n\nFor  the  Third  Road  Improvement  Project  (provincial  road  component),  a  review  of  the\n31.\nroad  improvements  in  hilly  areas,  especially  where  the  zone  of  influence  (ZOI)  is  mainly\npopulated  by  ethnic  minorities,  revealed  that  (i)  although  the  improvements  are  very  recent,\nminorities appear to be ill-equipped to take advantage of the opportunities the improved roads\noffer,  because  they  are  subsistence  farmers  with  little  or  no  integration  into  the  market\neconomy; (ii) the people who will benefit in the immediate term are the kinh (the ethnic majority\nin Viet Nam) living in the area; and (iii) road improvements will likely encourage in-migration of\nkinh families and as a result minorities may lose land, and the inequities between the kinh and\nthe  minorities  will  increase.  In  terms  of  protecting  ethnic  minorities'  unique  culture,  traditions,\nand lifestyle, therefore, the Project will identify ways and measures by which the benefits from\nroad improvement can be enhanced and where investment can be made in tandem with other\ninitiatives  that  cater  specifically  to  the  socioeconomic  development  of  ethnic  minority  groups.\nEthnic  minority  development  plans  are  being  developed  under  the  Project  to  help  minimize\nadverse impacts on minorities.\n\nE. \n\nADB's Sector Strategy\n\n32.\nADB\u2019s  overarching  objective  is  the  reduction  of  poverty,  followed  by  good  governance,\nand private sector development. ADB has worked jointly with 22 Government, financing agency,\nand  nongovernment  organization  partnership  groups  to  prepare  an  economic  development\nstrategy for 2010. For the transport sector this strategy emphasizes a vision that espouses the\n\u201csmooth  movement  of  people  and  goods  in  an  economically,  socially,  and  environmentally\nsustainable  manner.\u201d  This  general  vision  is  shared  by  the  various  stakeholders  and  specific\nactions to achieve the vision have been identified.\n\n33.\nCore  to  the  successful  improvement  of  transport  sector  management  is  the  continuing\nprocess of institutional reform, specifically continued development of VRA with capacity building\nand institutional strengthening, and improved and secured funding of maintenance. The thrust of\nthe  reforms  are  directed  at  equalization  of  state-owned,  transport-related  enterprises,  an\nappropriate  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  organizational  and  functional  reform  of  the\nministries, including MOT and MPI, and appropriate devolution of responsibility between central\nand local governments. Additionally, adequate financing is needed, not only for the development\nof  the  transport  system,  but  more  importantly,  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  these\nfacilities. These issues are being addressed by ADB and the aid community.\n\n34.\nADB\u2019s  new  country  strategy  and  program  for  Viet  Nam  during  2001,  will  guide  future\noperations. Based on this, preparation of a new transport sector strategy for the medium-term\n(2002-2006) is planned as part of economic sector work in 2002.\n\nF. \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n35.\nThe  introduction  of  modern  policies  is  dependent  on  development  of  the  policy-making\ninstitutions. Since the mid-1990s, ADB has been actively engaged in institutional strengthening\nefforts  to  assist  MOT  and  VRA  become  modern  well-managed  agencies.  This  is  a  continuing\nprocess  and  considerable  progress  has  been  achieved  that  include  (i)  strengthened  legal\nframework and regulation with improved governance, (ii) enhanced financing capability to fund\nroad maintenance, (iii) improved project implementation capability, and (iv) facilitation of private\nsector participation. In brief, VRA was established in 1993 and became responsible for planning,\ninvestment, and maintenance of roads in Viet Nam. The next significant step in legislation was\ntaken  when  the  National  Assembly  passed  the  Road  Traffic  Act  in  June  2001  to  regulate  the\nroad infrastructure and road transport subsector. This act will come into force in January 2002.\nAmong other things, the act allows for the entry of the private sector in road transport operations\n\n\f11\n\nand  services  in  the  country.  In  terms  of  financing  of  roads,  a  levy  on  fuel  was  introduced  in\n1995,  whereby  approximately  D200  of  D500  is  notionally  allocated  to  VRA  for  recurrent\nexpenses.  The  levy  is  subject  to  review  and  adjustment  by  the  Government.  VRA  usually\ncharges a toll when a road is improved by resealing or overlays, part of which goes into the VRA\nbudget for further maintenance and improvement works. A proposal to establish a road fund for\nmaintenance  has  been  formulated  for  discussion  within  the  Government.  A  few  established\nPMUs  have  become \nimplementation  and  project\nmanagement, while acquiring knowledge, experience, and capacity in environmental and social\nissues. The earlier use of force account in road projects is discouraged and has been replaced\nwith competitive bidding among public and private sector entities, which have been established\nduring recent years.\n\nrelatively  experienced \n\nin  physical \n\nProgress has been made in many areas of policy and institutional reform for roads, but\n36.\nseveral of key issues remain within the overall transport sector policy dialogue framework of the\nexternal  assistance  community  and  the  Government.  The  proposed  Project  has  policy\ncovenants  that  will  result  in  institutionalizing  modern  planning  and  programming  tools  for\nformulating  the  annual  maintenance  program  for  the  national  highway  network,  including\nsystematic  collection  of  traffic  and  road  condition  data,  and  the  implementation  and  use  of\nappropriate  software  planning  at  all  VRA  levels.  These  efforts  will  be  made  sustainable  and\ngiven  institutional  and  legal  backing  with  the  introduction  of  permanent  decrees  specifying\nVRA\u2019s functions and responsibilities in accordance with the new Road Traffic Act. Another policy\ncovenant is to encourage VRA to realign itself to be a modern highway agency by formulating\nand implementing an organizational and financial management improvement plan in line with its\nnew  responsibilities.  The  final  policy  covenant  aims  to  preserve  the  asset  base  of  the  road\nnetwork by carrying out a study to formulate ways to implement a road fund and to encourage\nthe progressive contracting out of periodic maintenance works. These policy covenants are time\nbound,  and  include  measures  to  monitor  the  progress  of  their  implementation.  These  policy\ncovenants  are  the  first  stage  in  helping  Viet  Nam  to  develop  an  effective  and  efficient  road\ninfrastructure and road transport subsector. A policy action plan for roads under the Project is\ngiven in Appendix 6.\n\n1. \n\nStrengthening the Legal Framework and Regulation\n\n37. While  the  Road  Traffic  Act  has  been  passed,  the  focus  of  ADB\u2019s  efforts  in  institutional\nstrengthening  is  to  increase  the  capability  of  VRA  to  act  as  the  country\u2019s  apex  body  for  the\nplanning  and  programming  agency  for  roads.  VRA  has  been  entrusted  with  preparing  seven\ndraft decrees and 18 regulations to complement the new act. They are expected to come into\nforce  in  January  2002.  However,  MOT  must  issue  permanent  decrees  specifying  VRA\u2019s\nresponsibilities and functions and VRA operations under the new act to replace Decree 07/CP\n(Appendix  7).  The  new  act  gives  considerable  authority  to  MOT  with  executive  power  for\nplanning,  construction,  and  maintenance  of  the  national  road  network,  and  over  vehicle  and\ndriver licensing as well as licensing of road transport operations. In addition, MOT has statutory\nadvisory  powers  over  the  planning,  construction,  and  maintenance  of  the  provincial  road\nnetworks, although the executive power is with the PPCs. Given the reality that funding for the\nprovincial road network is to a large extent from the central Government, the statutory advisory\npowers  mean  that  the  Road  Traffic  Act  will  allow  MOT  to  be  the  strategic  planning  and\nprogramming  authority  for  the  country\u2019s  road  network.  Moreover,  it  is  important  for  a  single\nagency  to  carry  out  the  strategic  planning  and  programming  function  for  the  roads  subsector\nbecause funds for road maintenance, upgrading, and new construction are limited and need to\nbe  utilized  effectively  so  that  the  country  derives  the  maximum  possible  benefit.  This  will\nbecome  even  more  important  in  the  future  when  the  obvious  choices  for  investment  will  no\nlonger be as apparent as they are now. To address this key issue, MOT has agreed to prepare\n\n\f12\n\nand adopt two decrees related to VRA\u2019s functions, responsibilities, and operations, as part of a\ntime-bound action plan, which is part of the proposed Project. These new decrees are expected\nto come into force by December 2002.\n\nADB is also supporting the Government's efforts22 to strengthen the legal framework and\n38.\nregulation  for  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement.  ADB  has  approved  a  TA23  for\nenhancing the resettlement legal framework and institutional capacity, by which the Government\nwill be assisted to develop a national involuntary resettlement policy to international standards\nby  2003  and  assisted  with  capacity  building.  This  builds  upon  the  considerable  work  already\ndone by ADB24 and WB.25 Recognizing the TA 5781 (footnote 24) work in Viet Nam, ADB has\nbeen given the mandate to lead the aid coordination group on resettlement issues. The Project\nwill support these efforts by promoting international good practice in resettlement by (i) providing\nconsiderable  capacity  building  of  executing  agencies,  (ii)  promoting  transparency,  and  (iii)\ncoordinating  project  scheduling  to  ensure  sufficient  time  is  allocated  for  satisfactory  planning\nand  implementation  of  resettlement  and  clearance  of  sites  prior  to  the  award  of  civil  works\ncontracts.\n\n2.\n\nInstitutional Strengthening\n\n39.\nUnder the TA component of Loan 1487 (footnote 1), several activities were carried out to\nstrengthen the institutional capacity of VRA including (i) the pilot implementation of the highway\ndesign  and  maintenance  model  (HDM)-426  in  VRA  to  assist  road  maintenance  planning  and\ninvestment  (completed),  (ii)  a  road  maintenance  quality  system  implementation  manual\n(completed), (iii) the study on financial management improvement (completed), and (iv) a study\non  the  establishment  of  a  road  fund  (completed).  In  addition,  WB  funded  the  pilot\nimplementation of a software system (the RoSyPlan) to aid in road maintenance planning and\nsoftware  for  bridge  management  (BridgeMAN)  in  VRA.  Thus,  VRA  is  the  only  agency  within\nMOT that has capacity to attempt to carry out the strategic planning and programming functions\nfor  the  roads  subsector  for  MOT.  The  two  new  permanent  decrees  (para.  37)  for  VRA  will\ndelegate these MOT functions and give the legal basis to VRA to be the strategic planning and\nprogramming authority for roads in the country.\n\nAlthough  a  start  has  been  made  to  improve  VRA  capacity,  more  needs  to  be  done  so\n40.\nthat VRA can carry out its planned functions effectively. An investment study financed by JICA,\nwith  the  final  report  issued  in  July  2000,  pointed  out,  that  VRA  (i)  has  weak  infrastructure\nmanagement; (ii) lacks capacity for planning, guiding, controlling, and monitoring infrastructure;\n(iii) lacks sufficient funds for maintenance; (iv) has weak monitoring of fund allocation; and (v)\nhas  no  reliable  basis  for  forecasting  future  funds.  The  pilot  implementation  of  the  HDM-4,\nRoSyPlan, and BridgeMAN software have not yet been internalized in the planning process for\nroad maintenance. No comprehensive or systematic data collection is in place to obtain traffic\ncensus  and  road  condition  data,  nor  are  there  in  place  geometric  and  capacity  design  and\n\n22  The  Government  issued  Decree  22/CP  in  1998  to  govern  involuntary  resettlement,  which  comes  much  closer  to\n\n23 TA 3727-VIE: Enhancing the Resettlement Legal Framework and Institutional Capacity, for $310,000, approved on\n\n                  \n\ninternational standards.\n\n24 September 2001.\n\n24  Under  TA-5781-REG:  Review of National Resettlement Policies and Experience with Involuntary Resettlement\nProjects,  for  $831,000,  approved  on  10  March  1998,  a  National  Resettlement  Action  Plan  was  prepared  for  Viet\nNam  setting  out  detailed  recommendations  on  policy  and  legal  frameworks,  institutional  arrangements,  and\ncapacity building for land acquisition and resettlement.\n\n25 Under a technical assistance grant (IDF Grant TF 28897VN) (1997), WB assisted the Government to draft an initial\n\nnational involuntary resettlement policy.\n\n26 It is the successor to HDM-3, probably the most widely used road planning model.\n\n\f13\n\nmaintenance  standards  based  on  a  functional  classification  of  the  different  links  of  the  road\nnetwork and their traffic load.\n\n41.\nThe  next  steps  would  therefore  involve  helping  VRA  to  (i)  fully  implement  HDM-4,\nRoSyPlan,  and  BridgeMAN  software  throughout  the  country  in  stages  and  integrate  them  into\nthe road maintenance planning process to help allocate scarce maintenance funds on a more\nsystematic basis; (ii) put in place a system to collect traffic census and road condition data so\nthat VRA has a better traffic and condition inventory of the country\u2019s road network for planning\npurposes; (iii) develop appropriate standards for road and bridge maintenance; (iv) develop an\neffective  contract  management  system  to  contract  out  the  maintenance  of  the  national  road\nnetwork  (including  bridges),  which  in  the  future  can  be  used  by  the  PDOTs  as  well  for  the\nprovincial road network; (v) ensure sustainable funding of maintenance activities; (vi) implement\nmodern  financial  management  and  accounting  systems  to  improve  accountability  of  funds\nutilized,  and  to  focus  on  the  asset  value  of  the  roads  under  its  jurisdiction;  (vii)  implement\nmodern  management  practices  within  the  organization,  including  optimum  use  of  information\nand  communication  technologies  to  improve  efficiency;  and  (viii)  divest  itself  of  SOEs  that  are\nincompatible with its new role as a modal agency. While implementing all these will take time,\nthe  Government  has  prepared  an  institutional  strengthening  program  for  VRA,  that  addresses\nthe  key  issues  and  also  includes  a  time-bound  action  plan  under  the  Project.  The  individual\ncomponents  of  this  program,  which  includes  capacity  building  and  provision  of  software  and\nsome  hardware  for  the  continued  institutional  strengthening  of  VRA,  will  mainly  be  provided\nunder  the  institutional  component  of  the  ongoing  Third  Road  Improvement  Project,  but  the\nproposed Project also provides for necessary capacity building.\n\nNeither  PMU-5  or  the  PDOTs  are  experienced  in  preparing  and  implementing\n42.\nresettlement plans or ethnic minority development plans to international standards. The ability to\ndo this successfully under the Project, will require that (i) PMU-5 and the PDOTs have in-house\nsocial  development  capacity;  (ii) \nfull-time  social  development\nassistance,  including  formal  and  on-the-job  training  of  counterpart  staff  in  PMU-5  and  the\nPDOTs, (iii) local implementing and monitoring agencies such as Viet Nam Women's Union be\nactive  partners;  and  (iv)  the  consultants  carry  out  formal  and  on-the-job  training  for  all\nresponsible parties.\n\nthe  consultants  provide \n\n3.\n\nRoad Maintenance and Investment\n\n43.\nThe  road  subsector  is  a  major  economic  and  social  factor  in  Viet  Nam  with  a\nreplacement  value  estimated  conservatively  at  D72  trillion  or  $9,800  million  equivalent  or  20\npercent  of  GDP  in  1999.  Hence  proper  road  maintenance  is  important  to  preserve  the  asset\nvalue and investment to date of this resource. Insufficient road maintenance and investment can\nbe traced to two main problems: inadequate planning and minimal funding.\n\n44.\nThe Government also needs to make a policy decision for sustainable funding for road\nmaintenance;  the  present  financing  model  is  clearly  unsustainable  in  the  long  term.  In  1999,\ntotal maintenance funds mobilized were $54.8 million. Out of this, $10.4 million (19 percent) was\nfrom  the  national  budget  derived  from  general  revenues  and  fuel  levies.  An  additional  $15.0\nmillion  (27  percent)  came  from  toll  revenues.  However,  administrative  expenses  for  toll\ncollection  are  relatively  high  with  the  1999  figure  being  $4.3  million  (20  percent  of  the  total\ncollection).  The  largest  single  source  of  maintenance  financing  of  $25  million  (46  percent)  is\nfrom  short-term  borrowing  by  VRA  to  offset  late  disbursement  of  national  budget  allocations.\nVRA  is  fully  responsible  not  just  for  the  repayment  of  the  principal  amount  but  also  for  all\ninterest payments;  interest payments will not be covered by future allocations from the national\nbudget. Delays in repayments of loans by VRA under this funding mechanism are contributing\n\n\f14\n\nto the rapidly increasing debt account. The final maintenance funding mechanism is for planned\nperiodic maintenance investment projects for roads with high traffic volumes but not included in\nthe  annual  national  budget.  VRA  through  the  enterprise  function  of  the  regional  road\nmaintenance  centers  (RRMCs)  can  borrow  from  commercial  sources.  In  1999,  $4.3  million  (8\npercent  of  total  maintenance  allocation)  was  raised  using  this  mechanism.  Revenues  are\nexpected from toll fees associated with the maintenance improvements, first to pay off the loans\nand  later  to  support  general  revenue  in  the  national  budget.  Initial  estimates  are  that  this\nrevenue collection is not adequate to cover loan repayments and hence the VRA debt account\nis increasing.\n\n45. While  over  half  (54  percent)  of  VRA\u2019s  maintenance  budget  is  financed  using  debt,  no\nreal  source  of  funds  is  available  to  service  this  debt.  VRA  debt  due  to  interest  charges  will\ncontinue  to  rise  and  if  not  addressed  soon  could  reach  unsustainable  proportions.  Hence  the\ncurrent financing model for maintenance is clearly unsustainable, aside from the fact that even\nthe amount raised through all these mechanisms is insufficient for proper maintenance. Thus, it\nis  imperative  that  the  Government  considers  other  mechanisms  for  sustainable  financing  of\nmaintenance  activities,  such  as  a  road  fund.  When  considering  sustainable  financing\nmechanisms,  the  sources  of  revenue,  expenditure,  and  financial  control  systems  need  to  be\nconsidered to obtain maximum value from the funds. To protect current investment in roads by\nensuring  their  adequate  maintenance,  the  Government  is  considering  how  to  establish  a\ndedicated and adequately financed road fund. MOT has agreed, as part of the action plan under\nthe Project, to a detailed study on potential revenue sources and to develop a mechanism for\nsustainable funding of road maintenance, including introduction of a road fund.\n\nThe  Government  should  also  assess  how  the  maintenance  activities  should  be  carried\n46.\nout. At present VRA assigns all routine operation and maintenance work to specific RRMUs and\nregional road maintenance centers based on geographic location. Because this does not entail\nany  competition  between  maintenance  units,  VRA  cannot  determine  if  maximum  benefit  is\nobtained  from  the  funds  spent.  Allocations  for  periodic  and  unexpected  maintenance  are\nallocated on a project basis with only minimal competition between maintenance units. This too\ngives  rise  to  issues  of  ineffectiveness.  ADB  will  continue  to  dialogue  with  MOT  aiming  at\ndeveloping  a  truly  competitive  system  for  contracting  out  maintenance  work  so  that  cost-\neffectiveness is maximized.\n\n4.\n\nRoad User Charges\n\nRoad  user  charges  are  a  significant  source  of  revenue  for  the  Government  in  general,\n47.\nalthough  the  charges  are  low.  A  1999  WB  study27  found  that  owners  of  four-wheel  motor\nvehicles  pay  an  annual  license  fee  that  is  so  low  ($2  for  state-owned  cars  and  $5  for  private\nvehicles) it should not be considered a road user charge but rather payment for a service (the\nsafety inspection). Safety inspection fees for buses and trucks are also low \u2013 from $12 to $15.\nSimilarly drivers\u2019 licensing fees are low and should not be considered as road user charges but\nas  administrative  fees.  Significant  distortions  within  the  regime  of  these  charges  also  need  to\nbe  adjusted  or  eliminated.  Diesel  fuel  and  heavy  vehicles  are  still  taxed  at  a  low  rate,  which\namounts to an indirect subsidy to heavy vehicles and thus provides little incentive for the use of\nefficient vehicles and the efficient use of these vehicles. Also, taxes specific to the weight of the\nvehicle  and  the  damage  it  causes  to  the  roads  need  to  be  introduced.  These  matters  were\nintroduced conceptually to VRA and MOT during implementation of TA 1996 (footnote 14). VRA\nneeds  assistance  to  rationalize  a  modern,  efficiency-based  road  user  charge  regime  in  Viet\n\n27 World Bank . 1999.

Report No.\n\n                  \n\n18748-VN City.\n\n\f15\n\nNam; this will be addressed under the institutional component of the Third Road Improvement\nProject.\n\n5. \n\nRoad Safety\n\n48.\nIn the past decade, the road accident situation in Viet Nam has worsened considerably\nwith  the  growth  in  motorization.  In  10  years  from  1990  to  1999,  140,278  accidents  were\nrecorded  with  45,196  people  killed  and  153,474  injured.  In  1999,  21,220  accidents  were\nrecorded with over 6,000 fatalities and 25,000 injured persons. Comparison of the accident data\nof 1990 and 1999 shows that the number of accidents increased 3.8 times, fatalities 3.2 times,\nand  injuries  5.2  times.  The  proposed  Project\u2019s  technical  designs  will  take  road  safety  into\naccount,  by  providing  hard  shoulders  for  separation  of  bicycle  and  other  nonmotorized  traffic,\nand making safe provision for pedestrian movement within populated areas. The major causes\nof accidents are the undisciplined behavior of vehicle operators, bicyclists, and pedestrians; the\nconfusing and dangerous mix of fast- and slow-moving vehicles; and the use of the pavement\nfor  various  nontraffic  related  purposes.  High  accident  rates  are  also  attributed  to  inadequate\nlaws and regulations for vehicles and traffic, their lax enforcement, the poor condition of roads,\nand absence of action to identify and improve hazardous locations.\n\n49.\nTo address this growing problem, the Government has set up the National Traffic Safety\nCouncil  chaired  by  a  vice  minister  of  MOT  and  consisting  of  representatives  from  all  relevant\nagencies. The council is drawing up a road safety action plan to reduce the accident rate. This\naction  plan  will  draw  upon  the  work  of  the  consultants,  who  carried  out  the  Viet  Nam  Road\nSafety Study as part of the WB\u2019s Highway Rehabilitation Project. ADB involvement in road and\nroad  safety  issues  will  continue  through  project  design  and  implementation,  and  continuing\ndialogue  with  concerned  Government  officials.  ADB  along  with  WB  is  supporting  the\nGovernment through the Global Road Safety Partnership, which includes a series of road safety\nactivities in Viet Nam, including education and awareness campaigns.\n\n6. \n\nTransport Sector Coordination and Partnerships\n\n50.\nJICA chairs ongoing partnership meetings, with MOT as the cochair. This has helped in\nthe macro sense to clarify who is doing what more precisely. Nevertheless, more coordination is\nneeded  to  ensure  that  all  participants  are  working  toward  the  same  goals,  while  collaborating\nmore  effectively  and  coordinating  more  efficiently.  WB  is  supporting  the  Rural  Transport  Unit\nwithin  MOT,  which  is  addressing  several  issues,  including  preparing  a  synthesis  of  existing\ninformation  to  help  provide  guidance  on  needs,  priorities,  technical  choices,  and  the\nresponsibilities of different agencies.\n\n51.\nDuring  discussions  with  MOT  in  August  2001,  the  ADB  mission  submitted  a  concept\npaper  to  MOT  to  establish  a  transport  sector  official  development  assistance  partnership.  The\nobjective of this proposal is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of official development\nassistance  for  the  transport  sector  to  ensure  that  investments  by  the  different  agencies  are\ncomplementary  in  nature  with  appropriate  synergy  among  the  different  components  so  that\noptimum benefits are derived to enhance the national economic and social development goals.\nThe  concept  paper  proposed  that  a  small  secretariat  be  established  to  service  the  transport\nsector  official  development  assistance  partnership.  About  $140,000  will  be  required  and  ADB\nhas offered $50,000 as its contribution; other multilateral and bilateral agencies are expected to\ncontribute.\n\n52.\nViet  Nam  was  selected  to  be  one  of  the  pilot  countries  for  the  introduction  of  the\ncomprehensive  development  framework  championed  by  WB.  So  far  this  approach  has  been\n\n\f16\n\nimplemented  in  a  partial  and  selective  way.  The  process  can  be  expected  to  evolve  gradually\nover  the  medium-term  as  simultaneous  and  thorough  analysis  of  issues  and  coordination  of\noperations in all sectors will place excessive demands on the Government and the assistance\ncommunity. For transport, aid coordination has been a regular feature for the last five years. The\nbasis  and  depth  of  the  coordination  has  been  getting  stronger  and  becoming  more  effective.\nADB  is  an  active  partner  in  the  coordination  process  and  the  transport  sector  official\ndevelopment assistance partnership is expected to assist in these efforts.\n\n7. \n\nRoad Construction Industry and SOEs\n\n53.\nIn  recent  years,  ADB  has  been  engaged  along  with  WB  in  SOE  reform  as  part  of  an\nenterprise reform and corporate governance program.28 One purpose is to promote competitive\npractices  with  maximum  private  sector  involvement  for  ADB-financed  projects  and  to  support\nSOE  corporatization  or  privatization.  Thus,  small  private  contractors  are  being  encouraged  to\nrehabilitate  district  and  provincial  roads  under  the  proposed  Project.  During  2001,  ADB  is\nexpected  to    approve  a  TA,  which  will  address  the  policy  framework  and  procurement-related\nmatters  for  SOEs  active  in  the  transport  sector  (para.  19),  and  support  private  sector\nparticipation.\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\nEfficient  road  transport,  and  improved  access  in  particular,  is  essential  for  poverty\n54.\nreduction  and  economic  development.  Past  efforts  in  the  road  subsector  have  mainly  been\ndirected  at  upgrading  the  national  highway  system,  while  also  improving  basic  access  to  the\nrural population by improving the lower level district and commune roads. One missing part in\nthe  network  development  strategy  has  been  improvement  of  provincial  roads,  which  provide\naccess  to  the  provincial  capitals,  to  the  national  highway  network,  and  to  the  rural  population\nthrough  the  district  and  commune  roads.  Improvement  of  the  provincial  roads  will  ensure\neffective  transport  and  communication  between  the  rural  population  connected  by  commune\nand  provincial  roads  with  market  and  distribution  centers  and  the  national  highway  network.\nAnother priority is continued reform and institutional strengthening of VRA to become a modern\nand  efficient  road  administration  agency.  The  adopted  sector  loan  modality  will  support\nsustainable  development  of  provincial  roads  and  allow  flexibility  in  selecting  prescreened\nsubprojects forming part of the PRSDP.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n1. \n\nObjectives\n\n55.\nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  and  economic  growth  by  improving\ntransport  efficiency.  The  Project\u2019s  objectives  are  to  (i)  improve  the  provincial  road  network  on\nboth  social  and  economic  grounds;  (ii)  provide  improved  access  for  poor  and  disadvantaged\ngroups living in rural communities; (iii) strengthen asset management capacity and maintenance\nprograms of VRA and the PDOTs; (iv) continue institutional strengthening of VRA and improve\ngovernance  in  the  road  subsector;  (v)  strengthen  PDOT  capacity  to  prepare,  implement,  and\n\n28 Loan  1733-VIE(SF):  State-Owned  Enterprise  Reform  and  Corporate  Governance  Program,  for  $60  million,\n\n                  \n\napproved on 21 December 1999.\n\n\f17\n\nmonitor  resettlement  and  ethnic  minority  development  plans;  and  (vi)  promote  private  sector\nparticipation in the delivery of road infrastructure and maintenance.\n\n2. \n\nScope\n\n56.\nThe Project comprises (i) a program including an investment plan and policy framework\nto  improve  about  1,600  km  of  provincial  roads  in  the  18  northern  provinces;  (ii)  assistance  to\nPMU-5 and the PDOTs to strengthen their capacity to prepare and implement improvements to\nand  maintenance  of  provincial  roads;  (iii)  development  and  introduction  of  an  action  plan  to\nimplement  a  road  fund  scheme;  (iv)  assistance  to  introduce  new  regulation  and  further\ninstitutional strengthening of VRA;29 (v) assistance to implement and monitor resettlement and\nethnic  minority  development  plans;  and  (vi)  consulting  services  for  the  preparation,  design,\nimplementation,  and  supervision  of  civil  works;  preparation  of  additional  subprojects;  and\ncapacity strengthening of the PDOTs.\n\n3. \n\nProject Area and Components\n\n57.\nThe  project  area  covers  three  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  seven  regions:  Northern  Mountains  and\nUplands (northeast and northwest), Red River Delta, and North Central Coast. Of the 18 project\nprovinces, 15 are located in the Northern Mountains and Uplands, two in the Red River Delta,\nand one in the North Central Coast. The Northern Mountains and Uplands and the North Central\nCoast regions are two of the poorest in the country and the incidence of poverty in the project\narea  is  high  with  18  percent  of  households  in  the  study  area  being  poor  compared  with  13\npercent in all of Viet Nam.\n\na. \n\nProvincial Roads Component\n\n58.\nThis component involves improvement works for 1,600 km of provincial roads selected\nfrom  a  list  of  2,850  km  proposed  by  the  PDOTs,  based  on  the  PRSDP  (Supplementary\nAppendix  B).  The  proposed  improvements  include  building  up  or  restoring  the  embankment,\nstrengthening  gravel  pavements  or  providing  gravel  base,  providing  bituminous  surfacing,\nimproving  existing  and/or  providing  additional  side  and  cross  drains,  repairing  existing  minor\nbridges, and constructing new bridges as required. The standard formation width of 6.5 meters\nwith a 3.5-meter surface treated carriageway under class V will be generally followed unless the\nexisting road width and traffic levels require a higher category of road. Initial studies have shown\nthat  almost  all  of  the  proposed  roads  are  economically  feasible  for  improvement  to  class  V  or\nhigher with traffic ranging from 10 to 400 conventional motor vehicles per day. All roads have a\nstrong  social  focus  as  they  serve  areas  inhabited  mainly  by  the  rural  poor  who  could  benefit\nsubstantially from improved access. The design standards and specifications will be simple and\ncomprise mainly small contracts using largely labor-based construction techniques.

Little  or  no  change  is  planned  for\nexisting horizontal and vertical alignments.\n\nb. \n\nSupport to PMU-5 and the PDOTs\n\n59.\nThe  Project  provides  for  support  to  the  implementing  agencies,  PMU-5,  and  the\nprovincial  PMUs  within  the  PDOTs  in  each  of  the  project  provinces.  In  addition  to  budgetary\nsupport  to    help  with  incremental  expenses  such  as  temporary  personnel,  office  equipment,\nsupplies,  and  office  and  vehicle  operating  expenses,  the  Project  provides  for  on-the-job  and\n\n                  \n\n29 The  consultant  under  Loan  1487-VIE  made  several  recommendations  for  VRA  development.

The  training  will  build  on  the  institutional\nstrengthening  already  experienced  under  previous  projects  funded  by  ADB,  DFID,  JBIC,  and\nWB  in  the  project  provinces,  and  will  be  undertaken  by  the  consultant  as  part  of  the  capacity\nbuilding effort under the Project. This will help ensure that the implementing agencies have the\nrequired  capacity  and  other  resources  to  effectively  and  efficiently  carry  out  this  and  future\nprojects.\n\nc. \n\nRoad Fund\n\n60.\nThe Project will seek to develop and introduce a road fund to ensure sustainable funding\nof  road  maintenance.  Recommendations  for  this  were  prepared  under  the  institutional\nstrengthening  component  of  the  ongoing  Second  Road  Improvement  Project  (footnote  1).  A\ndetailed  study,  covering  possible  sources  and  mechanisms,  for  funding  of  road  maintenance,\nwill  be  carried  out  under  the  institutional  component  of  the  ongoing  Third  Road  Improvement\nProject  (footnote  1)  as  part  of  the  action  plan  (further  details  at  Appendix  6)  adopted  by  the\nGovernment for the proposed Project.\n\nd. \n\nDevelopment of VRA\n\n61.\nAs  the  highway  agency  for  the  road  subsector  in  MOT,  VRA  is  expected  to  carry  out\nmany  of  the  functions  under  the  Road  Traffic  Act  that  fall  within  the  purview  of  MOT.\nRecommendations  in  this  regard  have  been  prepared  under  the  institutional  strengthening\ncomponent  of  the  ongoing  Second  Road  Improvement  Project.  As  part  of  the  Project,  the\nGovernment  has  adopted  an  action  plan  to  ensure  VRA  achieves  its  intended  role  and\nfunctions.  The  action  plan  includes  strengthening  the  legal  framework  and  institutional\nstrengthening  of  VRA,  improvement  of  road  management  practices,  and  maintenance  funding\n(further  details  at  Appendix  6).  The  action  plan  was  officially  submitted  to  ADB  before  loan\nnegotiations.\n\ne. \n\nLand Acquisition, Resettlement, and Ethnic Minority Development\n\n62.\nThe  Project  will  include  the  preparation,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  an  RP  for\neach subproject road requiring such a plan according to the applicability condition as defined in\nthe Project\u2019s resettlement framework. The RPs will include a program for providing assistance to\nethnic minority communities for all subproject roads where ethnic minority people live within the\nZOI30 of each road. This will be done in accordance with the resettlement framework, which was\nprepared  for  the  Project  in  accordance  with  ADB's policies  on  involuntary  resettlement  and\nindigenous people.31 The Government and ADB agreed on the Resettlement Framework during\nloan negotiations. Strengthening of the executing and implementing agencies is essential as is\nthe  formal  and  on-the-job  training  that  will  be  provided  by  the  consultants.

This  involves  conducting  surveys,  and  preparing  engineering\ndesigns and resettlement and ethnic minority development plans, as needed.\n\nC. \n\nCost Estimates\n\n64.\nThe  estimated  cost  of  the  Project  is  $100.0  million  equivalent,  including  civil  works,\nconsulting  services,  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  support  to  PMU-5  and  the  PDOTs,  and\ncontingencies.  The  cost  comprises  $36.6  million  in  foreign  exchange  (37  percent  of  the  total\ncost),  including  $2.90  million  for  service  charges  during  construction,  and  $63.4  million\nequivalent  (63  percent)  in  local  currency  costs.  The  costs  are  based  primarily  on  rough\nestimates  for  typical  roads  in  the  terrain  encountered  in  the  project  provinces  based  on  the\nfeasibility study prepared by the TA consultant. The estimate assumes that the civil works will\nbe carried out by local contractors under supervision of international and domestic consultants.\nTable 1 summarizes the cost estimates (a cost estimate for the nine core roads is in Appendix\n8).\n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nCost Estimate\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nADB Government\n\n29.71\n0.00\n\n48.74\n5.00\n\n78.45\n5.00\n\n53.45\n0.00\n\n25.00\n       5.00\n\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n\n3.26\n\n0.75\n2.90\n\n1.00\n4.50\n5.50\n\n4.14\n\n1.00\n4.50\n5.50\n\n7.40\n\n0.00\n0.00\n\n0.75\n2.90\n\n5.50\n\n7.40\n\n0.75\n2.90\n\n0.00\n\n0.00\n\n0.00\n0.00\n\n36.62\n\n63.38\n\n100.00\n\n70.00\n\n30.00\n\nCategory\n\nA.

It is proposed that ADB provide a loan\nof  $70.0  million  equivalent,  denominated  in  special  drawing  rights  from  its  Special  Funds\nresources  with  an  amortization  period  of  32  years  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years  with  an\ninterest  charge  of  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nthereafter.  The  loan  will  finance  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  of  the  Project,  estimated  at\n\n\f20\n\n$36.6 million (about 37 percent of the total project cost) and  $33.4 million equivalent of the local\ncurrency cost (about 33 percent of the total project cost). The latter will include the entire local\ncurrency  cost  of  the  consulting  services,  incremental  expenditure,  and  a  portion  of  the  local\ncurrency  cost  of  the  civil  works.  The  Government  will  finance  the  remaining  $30.0  million\nequivalent,  which  will  cover  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  including  the  ethnic  minority\ndevelopment  component  of  the  RP,  independent  monitoring  of  RP  provisions,  local  currency\ncontingencies, the remaining portion of the civil works cost, and all taxes and duties.\n\nThe amount of local currency funding takes account of the current fiscal situation in Viet\n66.\nNam.  The  country  is  one  of  the  poorest  in  the  world,  and  the  Government  has  difficulty\nmobilizing  sufficient  funds  from  its  own  resources  to  meet  all  development  commitments,\nincluding  rehabilitating  and  upgrading  critical  physical  and  social  infrastructure.  Although  the\nneed to generate domestic resources to finance investments for sustaining economic growth is\nwell recognized, the country has not yet developed the resource base necessary to adequately\nfinance  the  required  level  of  investments  without  external  assistance.  Under  the  current\ncircumstances, a large investment-savings gap will continue exerting pressure on development\nprograms;  thus  external  support  is  needed  to  meet  some  of  the  local  costs  of  projects.  In  line\nwith  the  ADB  policy  to  help  provide  local  currency  cost  financing,  particularly  for  projects  that\naddress priority poverty concerns in the economically less-developed regions, about 48 percent\nof the loan will be for that purpose.\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nSource\n\nADB\nGovernment\nTotal\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\n36.6\n0.0\n36.6\n\n33.4\n30.0\n63.4\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n70.0\n30.0\n100.0\n\nPercent\n\n70.0\n30.0\n100.0\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank.\n\nE. \n\nThe Executing Agencies\n\nMOT  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  and  PMU-5  within  MOT  will  assume  overall\n\n67.\nresponsibility for project implementation.\n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nThe Implementing Agencies\n\n68.\nThe  PDOTs  will  be  the  Implementing  Agencies  in  their  respective  provinces.  Under\nguidance from PMU-5, the PDOTs have established provincial PMUs that will be responsible for\nawarding  civil  works  contracts  and  day-to-day  implementation.  This  is  in  line  with  the\nGovernment\u2019s policy for decentralization of project responsibilities to the provinces and supports\nthe recent Government initiatives to devolve more autonomy to the provinces to manage their\nown  finances.  PMU-5  is  presently  the  implementing  agency  for  a  JBIC-funded  road\nimprovement project. Although it has gained considerable experience in implementing externally\nfinanced  projects,  assistance  is  warranted  to  make  it  more  familiar  with  ADB  procedures  and\nimplementation  requirements.  While  the  PDOTs  have  experience  with  externally  financed\n\n\f21\n\nprojects,32 they will require support and assistance from PMU-5 and the project consultants to\ndevelop the necessary skills to manage and implement the civil works and RPs effectively, as\nwell as for subproject preparation. Project coordination will be the responsibility of MOT\u2019s vice-\nminister,  assigned  responsibility \nthe  Project.  A  separate  project  preparation  and\nimplementation  manual  prepared  by  the  TA  consultant  will  be  used  by  PMU-5  during  project\nimplementation. The Project\u2019s organizational arrangements are shown in Appendix 9.\n\nfor \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n69.\nA summary implementation schedule, based on a detailed schedule prepared by PMU-5\nand ADB, is provided in Appendix 10. The schedule assumes that the Project will be declared\neffective in March 2002. The nine core roads will be ready for contract awards shortly after that\ntime. The subprojects for the remaining roads will be implemented in about four tranches, each\ninvolving subproject preparation, bidding and award of civil works, and construction. Due to its\ncritical role in implementation, advance action has been approved for procurement of consulting\nservices and civil work preconstruction activities (up to award of contracts) for the core roads.\nThe Project is envisaged to be completed by June 2006.\n\n3. \n\nSubproject Preparation\n\nThe core roads represent a sample of the universe of provincial roads prepared in a form\n70.\nthat is acceptable for ADB approval. Specifically, work on the nine core roads has been found to\nbe  technically  feasible,  economically  justified,  and  socially  and  environmentally  responsible.\nWhile  most  of  the  data  needed  for  selecting  and  prioritizing  the  project  roads  was  prepared\nunder  the  TA,  it  did,  however,  not  provide  the  full  documentation  required  for  approval  of\nsubprojects in addition to the core roads. These data will be prepared under the Project. While\nthe selection of subproject roads will be at MOT\u2019s discretion, ADB approval will be required prior\nto tendering.\n\n71.\nTo be eligible for financing under the loan, the subprojects submitted by PMU-5 must be\n(i)  technically  justified  and  economically  viable,33  (ii)  environmentally  and  socially  responsible,\n(iii) part of the PRSDP, and (iv) in compliance with all applicable ADB guidelines. MOT-PMU-5\nwill seek ADB approval by submitting a request for subproject approval that will include (i) cover\nsheet, (ii) basic data sheet, (iii) location map, (iv) an initial environmental examination (IEE) or\nenvironmental impact assessment in ADB format, (v) the Government\u2019s environment approval,\nand (vi) an RP, including an ethnic minority development plan (EMDP) component, in a format\nacceptable to ADB (Appendix 11).\n\n4. \n\nCivil Works Component\n\nCivil works, based on the roads in the PRSDP, will be implemented through a number of\n72.\nsmall  contracts,  each  valued  at  between  $200,000  and  $1,000,000.  Each  province  will  have\nabout  three  to  six  of  these  contracts,  for  a  total  of  about  100  contracts.  Contracts  will  be\nprocured  using  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  and  will  follow  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  In  essence,  these  procedures  follow  closely  the  procedures\nadopted  for  the  provincial  road  components  of  the  ongoing  ADB-financed  Second  and  Third\n\n                  \n\n32 Ten of the 18 provinces have some experience through mainly district and commune road improvement projects\n\nfunded by DFID, JICA, and WB.\n\n33 The economic internal rate of return will exceed 12 percent for eligible subprojects.\n\n\f22\n\nRoad Improvement projects and WB-financed rural transport projects.34 The bidding procedures\nwill use a two-envelope modality,35 as adopted for ongoing similar projects (footnote 1).\n\n73.\nDetailed  procurement  procedures  and  procurement  documentation  have  been\ndeveloped by the TA consultant in consultation with PMU-5 and the PDOTs, based on previous\nexperience of ADB and WB-financed projects of a similar type. After MOT review and approval,\nthe  procedures  and  documentation  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  before  the  first  bids\nare  invited.  The  procedures  will  provide  for  bids  to  be  invited  in  each  province  in  annual\nbatches.  A  contractor\u2019s  performance  in  an  earlier  phase  will  determine  whether  the  company\ncan participate in bidding for the subsequent batches. The number of contracts a contractor can\nbe awarded will be determined on the basis of the company\u2019s bid capacity.\n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n74.\nThe  supervision  consultant  will  be  an  association  of  international  and  domestic  firms,\nwith the former the lead in the association. The consultant will be selected in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the\nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Staffing  inputs  will  be  about  160  person-months  of\ninternational  consultants  and  about  2,000  person-months  of  domestic  consulting.  Expertise\nrequired will include project and contract management; economic evaluation, especially of low\nvolume  roads,  materials;  and  pavement  engineering;  structural  engineering;  social  and\nenvironmental  impact  assessment  and  monitoring;  resettlement  planning  and  implementation;\nand ethnic minority development expertise (Supplementary Appendix C). The overall period of\nthe  services  will  be  about  51  months.  Furnished  office  facilities  and  utilities,  vehicles,  and\nequipment  required  by  the  supervision  consultant  will  be  provided  under  the  Project.  Field\noffices  and  material  testing  laboratories  with  utilities  and  motorcycles  required  by  construction\ninspectors will be supplied through the civil works contracts.\n\n6. \n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\na. \n\nReports\n\nPrior  to  beginning  the  civil  works  under  the  Project,  PMU-5  will  provide  ADB  with  brief\n75.\nmonthly progress reports on the status of preconstruction activities. These reports will be due at\nthe end of each month. Once the project supervision consultant is appointed, the consultant will\nprepare  brief  monthly  progress  and  quarterly  reports  for  PMU-5  and  ADB.  The  format  of  these\nreports  will  be  discussed  and  agreed  to  prior  to  commencing  the  consulting  services.  Once  the\nworks are completed, PMU-5 will arrange for the project consultant to submit a project completion\nreport within three months of project completion.\n\nb. \n\nRecords and Accounts\n\n76.\nPMU-5  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  the  goods  and  services\nfinanced from the loan proceeds and from counterpart funds; to identify the use of these goods\nand  services  for  the  Project;  to  record  project  progress,  including  its  cost;  and  to  reflect  in\naccordance with consistently maintained sound accounting principles, its operations and financial\ncondition.\n\n                  \n\n34 Rural Transport Project and Rural Transport Project II financed by WB.\n35 The first envelope contains prequalification data, and the second envelope, which will only be opened for eligible\n\nand prequalified bidders, contains bid prices.\n\n\f23\n\nThese  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  by\n77.\nauditors acceptable to ADB. PMU-5 will provide ADB with the audited reports and related financial\nstatements,  in  English,  not  later  than  nine  months  after  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year  to  which  they\nrelate.\n\nc. \n\nImprest Account\n\n78.\nImprest account procedures will be used for civil works and also for PMU-5 and PDOTs\u2019\nincremental expenditures under the loan. An imprest account will be established with PMU-5 and\noperated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement Handbook.  Second  generation  imprest\naccounts, following the same requirements as the main imprest account, will be established in the\nPDOTs to facilitate flow of funds to the provinces responsible for awarding and administering the\ncivil work contracts.\n\nd.\n\nMidterm Review\n\nADB will conduct regular reviews throughout project implementation. In particular, midway\n79.\nthrough project implementation (end 2003), ADB and senior Government and provincial officials\nwill undertake a detailed review of the Project and its implementation status. This review will cover\nthe entire project scope to determine whether any adjustments to its proposed procurement and\nmanagement  arrangements  are  warranted.  The  review  will  also  address  any  outstanding\nprocurement problems, and financing and scheduling matters.\n\ne.\n\nProject Performance Monitoring\n\n80.\nPMU-5,  with  the  assistance  of  the  project  consultant,  will  carry  out  project  performance\nand  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  by  compiling  and  analyzing  appropriate  traffic,  and\nsocioeconomic  and  other  data  for  the  project  roads.  For  this  purpose,  PMU-5  carried  out  a\nbaseline survey in 2001 for roads in four provinces with assistance of the TA consultants. This will\nbe  followed  by  data  collection  and  other  surveys  once  during  implementation  and  immediately\nafter the project roads have been completed and handed over. The findings and supporting data\nwill be incorporated in the project completion report. Systems for recording data and statistics for\nsuch  monitoring  will  be  established  as  part  of  the  project  implementation  arrangements  with\nassistance  of  the  project  supervision  consultants.  PMU-5  assisted  by  the  project  supervision\nconsultants  will  evaluate  the  project  benefits  in  accordance  with  a  schedule  and  terms  of\nreference to be mutually agreed with ADB.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironmental\n\n81.\nIn most cases, selected roads will be improved within the existing alignment, which has\nbeen  in  place  for  a  long  time.  The  ecology  of  the  area  surrounding  these  roads  has  already\nadjusted  to  any  negative  impacts  caused  by  the  road\u2019s  existence.  Minor  realignment  will  be\nincorporated  in  the  design  of  a  few  specific  subprojects  where  the  existing  road  passes  near\nsensitive areas, such as protected nature reserves and cultural-historic sites. Where an existing\nroad  passes  near  a  sensitive  site,  the  road  subproject  will  include  appropriate  supplemental\nprotective  measures,  such  as  fencing,  checkpoints,  and/or  demarcation  of  the  adjacent  or\nnearby site.\n\n82.\nUnder the TA, IEEs were carried out for the nine core roads in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines  on  the  Environmental  Impacts  of  Infrastructure  Projects  and  Environmental\n\n\f24\n\nAssessment Requirements of the Asian Development Bank. A summary IEE was prepared for\none  of  the  nine  core  roads  (first  subproject)  (Appendix  12).  All  subsequent  subprojects  will\nadhere to the same ADB IEE and summary IEE procedures.\n\nPMU-5, in cooperation with the 18 PDOTs, will ensure adherence to the Government\u2019s\n83.\nenvironmental  regulations, \nincluding  registration  and  preparation  of  an  environmental\nassessment report for each subproject in accordance with the Circular Letter on Setting Up and\nAppraising the Environmental Impact Assessment Report for Investment Project.36 This requires\nPMU-5  to  obtain  approval  of  individual  subproject  environmental  impact  reports  from  the\nMinistry  of  Science,  Technology,  and  Environment,  and  specifically  from  its  National\nEnvironment Agency.\n\nThe Project\u2019s subproject designs and contract documentation will provide details of the\n84.\nnecessary environmental mitigation measures, and the contractual means by which they are to\nbe  included  during  construction.  In  most  cases,  the  nature  of  subproject  civil  works  will  be  of\nslight  environmental  significance  and  pertain  to  standard  good  environmental  engineering\npractices.  Only  where  subproject  roads  pass  through  or  near  sensitive  sites  will  special\nenvironmental considerations be necessary, but these are anticipated to be minor in nature. The\nProject\u2019s  supervision  consulting  services \nimpact  monitoring  and\nmitigation provisions.\n\ninclude  environmental \n\n2. \n\nSocial\n\na.\n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement\n\n85.\nThe Project will require acquisition of approximately 74 hectares of land for the nine core\nsubproject  roads  and  approximately  415  hectares  for  the  remaining  90  subproject  roads.  The\ncost of preparing and implementing RPs for all subproject roads is estimated at approximately\n$3.5  million.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  under  the  Project  will  be  avoided  as  much  as\npossible,  however,  even  marginal  land  acquisition  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the\nprocedures  established  in  the  resettlement  framework  to  ensure  that  adverse  effects  of  the\nproject are addressed within a process that protects the rights of people affected by the Project,\nincluding ethnic minorities, where these are living within the ZOI of a road.\n\n86.\nIn  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  ADB's  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  for\npreparation  of  a  sector  loan,  a  resettlement  framework  (Appendix  13)  applicable  to  all\nsubprojects  and  an  RP  for  one  sample  subproject    (Appendix  14)  have  been  prepared  and\napproved  by  the  Government.  For  each  of  the  eight  remaining  core  roads,  an  RP  will  be\nprepared  and  approved  by  the  Government  prior  to  loan  effectiveness.  The  PDOTs  will  be\nrequired  to  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  for  approval  an  RP  for  each  of  the  other  subprojects\nonce the detailed design is available.\n\n87. With  the  assistance  of  the  construction  supervision  consultants,  PMU-5  will  arrange\nthrough  the  PDOTs  for  the  required  land  to  be  acquired,  and  for  those  affected  to  be\ncompensated and, if required, relocated and resettled, and incomes rehabilitated in accordance\nwith  the  Government's  procedures  and  ADB's  requirements  as  defined  in  ADB's  policy  on\ninvoluntary  resettlement.  Where  the  Government's  procedures  and  ADB's  requirements  differ,\nthe latter will apply. The PDOTs will not begin to implement the RPs until after the construction\n\n                  \n\n36 Under review by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment and MPI is the Joint Circular Environment\nImpact Assessment of Plans and Investment Projects. Fifteen days after this document is signed by both ministries\nit will supercede the above mentioned legislation. Essentially the same as the existing Circular Letter, the new one\nwill have greater authority due to backing by both ministries.\n\n\f25\n\nsupervision consultants have been mobilized to oversee RP implementation. PMU-5 will engage\nan  independent  domestic  agency  acceptable  to  ADB  to  monitor  compliance  with  the  RPs  and\nresettlement framework.\n\nReflecting the importance that ADB places on the careful and effective implementation of\n88.\nthe  RPs,  the  Loan  Agreement  contains  a  number  of  covenants  related  to  this  issue.  The\ncapacity  of  PMU5  and  the  PDOTs  will  be  strengthened  to  enable  effective  and  timely  RP\npreparation  and  implementation.  The  construction  supervision  consultants  will  include  full-time\nresettlement  specialists  to  guide  and  supervise  RP  preparation  and  implementation.  ADB  will\nalso monitor the social aspects of the Project through regular review missions by resettlement\nand  social  development  specialists.  Furthermore,  the  Project  will  promote  international  good\npractice in resettlement, thereby supporting efforts made by the Government, ADB, DFID, and\nWB.\n\nb.\n\nPlans for Ethnic Minorities\n\nThe  term  ethnic  minorities  refer  to  those  groups  that  are  different  from  the  national\n89.\nmajority group of kinh. However, in the project context while the kinh are the national majority, in\nmany of the provinces in the project area this group constitutes the minority of the population. In\nthe  project  area,  30  ethnic  groups  make  up  49  percent  of  the  population.  Three  of  the  core\nroads have populations made up of more than 95 percent ethnic minorities.\n\n90.\nIn general, the Project seeks to avoid displacement of any people. In most cases, people\nwhose  houses  need  to  be  moved  will  be  able  to  move  just  behind  the  right-of-way,  thereby\nminimizing the impact. In exceptional cases where displacement cannot be avoided, particular\ncare will be given in the compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation of displaced people that\nare  ethnic  minorities.  Extensive  social  preparation  and  mobilization  for  ethnic  minority  groups\nwill take place prior to any physical resettlement.\n\n91.\nThe Project will not have any negative impact on specific ethnic minority groups located\nin the project areas. The selection criteria for the subprojects are designed to ensure that they\ndo not adversely impact ethnic minorities. The Project will identify ways and measures in which\nthe  benefits  from  road  improvement  can  be  enhanced  and  where  investment  can  be  made  in\ntandem with other initiatives that cater specifically to the socioeconomic development of ethnic\nminority  groups.  This  will  be  done  by  means  of  participatory  detailed  design  of  minority\ndevelopment plans (EMDPs) under the guidance of the consultants. Such efforts will include (i)\nsmall-scale community infrastructure aimed at improving access of the poor and excluded, such\nas  trails,  footbridges,  and  markets;  (ii)  participatory  agricultural  extension  to  increase\nproductivity;  and  (iii)  support  for  credit  utilization.  Gender  concerns  of  relevance  to  ethnic\nminorities  will  also  be  addressed  by  the  Project  actively  facilitating  the  processes  whereby\nwomen  are  involved  in  identifying,  designing,  implementing,  monitoring,  and  evaluating  the\nEMDPs.\n\n92.\nThe  resettlement  framework  (Appendix  13)  was  prepared  under  TA  3455  (footnote  3)\nand  includes  a  component  for  ethnic  minority  development,  which  will  be  applicable  in  cases\nwhere there are ethnic minority people living within the zone of influence of a subproject road.\nThe Government has approved the framework. In accordance with the framework, the sample\nRP for one core road (Appendix 14) makes provision for an EMDP for communities within the\nZOI of that road. Prior to loan effectiveness, an EMDP component will be prepared and included\nin the RPs for the other core roads where there are ethnic minority people living  within the ZOI\nof  those  roads.  The  PDOTs  will  be  required  to  prepare  and  submit  RPs  to  ADB  for  approval:\nthe EMDP component must be included for each subproject as required and in accordance with\n\n\f26\n\nthe  criteria  stipulated  in  the  framework.  The  EMDP  component  will  be  prepared  and\nimplemented following ADB's indigenous people policy.\n\nc.\n\nHealth Measures\n\n93.\nTransport  corridors  can  have  significant  impacts  on  the  transmission  of  sexually\ntransmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS.37 Truck drivers operating along the roads and commercial\nsex  workers  are  identified  as  two  of  the  major  high-risk  groups.  As  the  Project  will  provide\nimproved  transport  links  within  the  country,  the  risk  of  STD  transmission  may  increase.  Most\nlabor  will  be  from  local  areas  and  will  return  home  at  night  thus  eliminating  or  minimizing  the\nneed for campsites that would encourage sex workers to establish and operate in those areas.\nMost of the roads are short and traversed in a short time. Their improvement is not likely to lead\nto the establishment of increased sex trade.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n94.\nThe  methodology  for  economic  analysis  presented  in  Appendix  15  used  the  traditional\nevaluation method where existing and future vehicle operating cost savings are determined and\nanalyzed to determine if the recommended improvement is warranted in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for the Economic Evaluation of Projects.  The  highway  design  and  maintenance\nmodel  was  adjusted  to  the  country\u2019s  conditions  and  used  to  calculate  vehicle  operating  costs\nand  savings.  The  main  inputs  to  this  are  vehicle  operating,  construction,  and  maintenance\ncosts, along with resettlement, supervision, and physical contingency costs. As the roads are in\n18 very poor provinces of northern Viet Nam, they were evaluated and ranked in social and area\neconomic terms. This ranking helps to set priorities and ensure that roads serving the poorest\nareas will be candidates for improvement.\n\n95.\nThe  provinces  have  a  combined  total  of  8,100  km  of  provincial  roads.  These  were\ninitially screened to eliminate roads that were recently improved; are scheduled for improvement\nor  in  good  condition,  or  have  very  low  priority  in  terms  of  low  traffic  volume.  This  reduced  the\nlength to 2,800 km. Based on a socioeconomic ranking, these roads were then reduced to 1,600\nkm  that  have  high  priority  in  socioeconomic  terms;  these  form  the  basis  of  the  Project.  To\nprepare the project roads, an initial set of core roads was selected to represent different parts of\nthe  project  area  reflecting  differences  in  topography,  geology,  and  social  and  other\ncharacteristics. The core roads were subject to a complete economic evaluation using detailed\ndesign,  and  vehicle  operating  costs,  all  adjusted  according  to  appropriate  shadow  prices  and\nconversion  factors.  Traffic  growth  rates  were  derived  from  the  relationship  between  GDP  and\nthe elasticity of transport demand for motorcycles, passenger transport, and cargo. These were\nthen  adjusted  to  reflect  project  area  characteristics.  This  yielded  annual  growth  rates  ranging\nfrom 5 to 13 percent up to 2005, and then declining to 4 to 5 percent thereafter.\n\nThe  project  roads  are  generally  lightly  traveled  with  motorcycles  comprising  about  80\n96.\npercent of the traffic on many roads. The level of improvement will mainly be to class V roads,\nand incorporates a formation width of 6.5 m and a sealed carriageway of 3.5 m. Analysis of the\nmaintenance costs between gravel and sealed surface shows that sealed roads provide a better\nriding surface longer and given the effects of heavy rainfall common to the project area, the cost\nof maintaining sealed roads is less than that of gravel-surfaced roads.\n\n37  HIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\n\n                  \n\n\f27\n\nMotorized vehicle operating cost savings were then calculated and included person-time\n97.\nsavings. Benefits include savings to nonmotorized traffic such as bicycles or bullock carts, but\nbenefits  to  generated  or  diverted  traffic  were  excluded.  Nonmotorized  traffic  generally\ncontributed less than 5 percent to total benefits. These savings were then balanced against the\nestimates of the necessary costs of improvement to bring the roads up to a standard that would\nensure  year-round  access.  The  results  of  the  economic  evaluation  for  the  core  roads  are\npresented in Table 3.\n\nTable 3: Summary of Economic Evaluation for the Core Roads\n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return and Switching Value in Percent\n\nRoad\nNumber\n\n0103\n0202\n0307\n0601\n0701\n1101\n1401\n1508\n1718\n\nBase\nCase\nEIRR\n\n59.0\n11.7\n60.7\n148.7\n13.7\n19.1\n42.6\n40.9\n109.5\n\n20%\nCapital\nCost\nIncrease\n(Case 1)\n50.2\n9.3\n51.2\n124.7\n10.9\n15.8\n35.9\n34.8\n92.0\n\n20% VOC\nSavings\nReduction\n(Case 2)\n48.4\n8.8\n49.3\n119.8\n10.3\n15.1\n34.6\n33.6\n88.5\n\nCombination\nCase1 +\nCase 2\n\nSwitching\nValue\nat 12 percent\n\n41.2\n6.7\n41.6\n100.5\n7.7\n12.1\n29.0\n28.5\n74.5\n\nBenefits\n(81)\n  (9)\n(78)\n(89)\n(11)\n(34)\n(68)\n(72)\n(88)\n\nCosts\n440\n26\n350\n850\n23\n51\n212\n252\n729\n\nEIRR = Economic Internal Rate of Return, VOC = vehicle operating costs.\n\nThe results show that the base case economic internal rate of return covers a wide range. This\nis mainly because of the sensitivity of the analysis to small changes in traffic on low cost, low\ntraffic  volume  roads.  Applying  either  the  20  percent  reduction  in  benefits  or  the  20  percent\nincrease in costs shows that improving core roads is still justified.\n\nB. \n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n98.\nThe  social  dimensions  of  the  Project  (resettlement,  ethnic  minority  development,\nstakeholder  participation,  and  construction  and  maintenance  labor  opportunities)  are  all\ndesigned to facilitate more equitable and sustainable distribution of benefits, particularly for the\npoorest  and  socially  excluded  in  the  project  area.  The  summary  social  and  poverty  impact\nassessment of the Project is presented in Supplementary Appendix D.\n\n99.\nDirect  harm  may  result  from  project  development,  as  well  as  indirect  adverse  social\nimpacts, including (i) individual and community loss of agricultural land or land associated with\ncommercial  activities  due  to  land  clearance  and  acquisition  issues,  (ii)  potential  for  ethnic\nminority groups not being able to participate in or benefit from the Project to the same extent as\nthe  kinh  or  to  suffer  disproportionately  from  adverse  cultural  effects,  and  (iii)  accidents  due  to\nlack  of  road  and  traffic  safety  both  during  and  after  construction.  These  potentially  adverse\nimpacts will be mitigated by the Project through measures including (i) community participation\nand  effective  planning  and  implementation  of  RPs  and  EMDPs,  and  (ii)  effective  construction\nsupervision  and  enforcement  of  contract  specifications,  as  well  as  implementation  of  safety\nfeatures.\n\n100.\nIn addition, the mechanism for promoting participation will have the objective of binding\ntogether  the  social  dimensions  of  the  Project  with  the  technical,  environmental,  and  economic\n\n\f28\n\nfeatures  to  make  this  an  integrated  development  project  aimed  at  maximizing  development\nimpact and poverty reduction.\n\n1. \n\nPotential for Community Participation in the Project\n\n101. Project  preparation  has  taken  a  participatory  approach  that  combined  workshops,\nindividual  meetings,  key  informant  interviews,  and  a  field  survey  of  21  roads,  to  engender\ncommunity awareness of the Project and to ascertain the degree to which people may benefit or\nbe affected by various subprojects. This participatory approach will continue during preparation,\nimplementation, and monitoring of RPs and EMDPs.\n\n102.\nImplementation of the subprojects provides opportunities to include local involvement in\nthe construction and maintenance of the provincial roads. While there could be some reluctance\nto  utilize  local  labor  as  a  component  of  construction,  many  benefits  can  be  derived  from\nencouraging community participation in road development. Firstly, it can engender a high level\nof acceptance and ownership of the subproject. Secondly, it reduces the likelihood of opposition\nto the subproject and the potential for delays. Thirdly, and perhaps more importantly, it ensures\nthat  the  needs  of  the  end-users  and  potential  beneficiaries  are  adequately  incorporated  into\nsubproject design; this is particularly important for road projects that are being used as engines\nfor poverty reduction.\n\nThe success of any community participation component within the Project will rest upon\nfor  which\n\n103.\nthe  establishment  of  appropriate  communication  networks  and  protocols, \norganizations such as the Women's Union will provide at least the initial mechanism.\n\n104. Sufficient  and  adequate  social  preparation  and  mobilization  is  also  paramount  if  using\nlocal labor is to be successful within the Project and is to contribute to poverty reduction in any\nsubstantial  way.  This  would  require  some  months  of  awareness  building  by  social  mobilizers\nand training in participation in a formal and regular wage-earning system, which is likely to be a\nforeign concept to residents of remote and disadvantaged communities, and particularly ethnic\nminority  communities  that  have  difficulty  participating  in  the  market/wage  economy  due  to\nlanguage and communication skills.\n\n105. Communities can also participate in identification of needs of minority communities and\ndevelopment;  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  EMDPs;  as  well  as  resettlement  planning,\nimplementation, and monitoring of RPs.\n\n106. Using this type of participatory approach will enhance the poverty reduction potential of\nthe  Project.  In  conjunction  with  attaining  the  Project's  overriding  objectives  of  rural  poverty\nreduction and improvement of access, it will provide ample opportunity to process subprojects\nthat  are  a  part  of  an  integrated  program  of  community-based  and  sustainable  commune\ndevelopment.\n\nC. \n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n107.\nThe  conclusions  of  the  social  and  poverty  assessment  are  that  the  Project  will  create\nsignificant positive impacts for the communities within the ZOI of each subproject. While some\nmarginal  adverse  effects  could  be  experienced,  predominantly  through  land  clearance  and\nacquisition  and  impacts  on  ethnic  minorities,  the  effects  of  these  can  be  adequately  mitigated\nprovided  the  affected  communities  are  given  the  opportunity  for  meaningful  participation  and\nconsultation, for which processes have been established.\n\n\f29\n\n108. Social  and  poverty  reduction  benefits  can  be  realized  from  subprojects  implementation\nby providing improved access to basic health and education facilities and other social services\nin  the  provincial  and  district  centers  and  also  at  the  commune  level  in  cases  where  provincial\nroads are the primary  access.  Improving the access to and between communes will also  help\nreduce the remoteness and isolation of ethnic minority groups, a factor that is considered to be\none of the main causes of their severe poverty. Poverty reduction aspects of the Project could\nbe  enhanced  by  engaging  affected  communities  and  providing  first  priority  to  the  poor  and\ndisadvantaged  in  the  actual  construction  of  subprojects.  The  modality  for  doing  this  is  being\ndeveloped.\n\n109.\nThe Project will thus achieve its overriding objectives of poverty reduction, improving the\nreliability of access to social and economic opportunities, and reducing the cost associated with\ntransportation on the provincial road network, providing the potential for increasing agricultural\noutput,  and  improving  the  quality  of  life  and  social  and  economic  well-being  of  the  poor,\ndisadvantaged, and ethnic minority sectors of the population.\n\nThe  Project  has  the  potential  to  accrue  a  range  of  benefits  to  poor  and  disadvantaged\n110.\ncommunities  alike,  and  if  some  subprojects  can  be  pursued  in  tandem  with  specific  poverty\nreduction,  rural  development,  or  ethnic  minority  development  programs,  the  benefits  of  the\nProject can be enhanced. In general the types of benefits that can be expected to follow from\nsubproject implementation include\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nproviding  essential  transport  infrastructure  and  services  and  thereby  increasing\neconomic  growth,  as  well  as  access  to  those  services  necessary  for  the  social\ndevelopment  of  the  population  increases  the  productive  value  of  limited\nresources  of  the  poor,  creates  employment  opportunities,  and  provides  better\naccess to essential services and markets;\n\nproviding  for  the  special  needs  of  the  poor  that  are  created  through  efforts  to\nincrease development improves the quality of life of the poor, provides affordable\ntravel, and increases employment opportunities and opportunities for the poor to\nmove into the economic and agricultural mainstream;\n\nsustaining  essential  transport  infrastructure  and  services  for  the  poor  increases\nemployment  opportunities  for  the  poor,  disadvantaged,  and  vulnerable  groups;\nand equips these groups with new skills and provides additional opportunities for\ncomplementary poverty reduction initiatives; and\n\nenhancing the mobility of women increases their participation in the labor force,\nincreases the economic productivity of women, and improves women's access to\nresources and essential services.\n\n111.\nThe Project is also in an excellent position to encourage investment in areas that support\nrural development and poverty reduction; in some cases the subprojects could be advanced as\npart  of  a  multisectoral  rural  development  project.  The  TA  (footnote  3)  identified  the  types  of\nintegrated programs and complementary activities that could be targeted for investment. If they\ncannot  be  included  within  the  Project,  these  activities  will  be  investigated  during  project\nimplementation for potential inclusion under a grant through aid coordination.\n\n\fD. \n\nRisks\n\n30\n\n112.\nThe  major  risks  associated  with  this  Project  relate  to  VRA\u2019s  progress  with  institutional\nreform, the quality of works, adherence to time schedules, timeliness of Government approvals\nfor  subprojects  and  construction  contracts,  availability  of  sufficient  qualified  resettlement  and\nsocial  development  specialists  to  ensure  adequate  and  timely  preparation  and  implementation\nof the RPs and EMDPs, and the timely realization of benefits that would accrue to the rural poor\nand especially to the ethnic minority population. The Government has adopted an action plan for\ninstitutional reform of VRA and its implementation.\n\n113.\nFor projects of this type the Government has delegated the authority to award contracts\nto the PDOTs with approvals required only by PMU-5 and MOT. This should help speed up the\napproval process. Most of the PDOTs have some experience either with ADB, DFID, JICA, or\nWB financed projects. This will help to ensure timely implementation and understanding of the\nADB procedures. Nevertheless, since PMU-5 has not been involved with ADB-funded projects,\nPMU-5  staff  will  need  to  become  proficient  with  ADB  requirements.  Some  PMU-5  staff  have\nbeen trained at ADB headquarters in Manila and more training is planned. Consulting services\nfor  subproject  preparation  and  implementation  are  provided  under  the  Project  and  will  be\ncharged with training the PMU-5 and PDOT staff.\n\n114. People will require time to adjust to a significant improvement of the intermediate goods\nthat  affect  their  lives,  such  as  improved  access  to  opportunities  not  previously  recognized  or\nconsidered  available.  To  help  achieve  maximum  benefit,  particularly  to  the  ethnic  minority\npeoples  populating  much  of  the  hilly  and  mountainous  areas  of  the  project  area,  the  EMDPs\nhave been prepared for the core roads and will be prepared for future subprojects.\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n115.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\nImplementation. The Government will ensure that road construction is carried out\nfollowing good environmental practices including appropriate selection of quarry\nand borrow sites and their subsequent rehabilitation after use;  proper disposal of\nconstruction  wastes  and  materials;  use  of  good  environmental  design  and\nconstruction techniques that ensure slope stability and drainage; minimization of\nconstruction  impacts  such  as  dust,  diversion  of  stream  flow  and  increased\nturbulence,  equipment  noise,  etc.;  and  other  environmental  impacts  associated\nwith road construction and maintenance.\n\n(ii)  When  project  roads  pass  through  or  near  protected  or  sensitive  areas  (nature\nreserves  parks,  conservation  areas,  biodiversity  reserves,  cultural  and  historical\nsites, etc.), the Government will ensure cooperation between the PDOT and the\narea  authority  responsible  for  preparing  and  implementing  the  protective\nmeasure.  This  may  include  any  combination  of  area  demarcation,  fencing,\ncheckpoints, speed bumps, wildlife passage zones, patrols, or other measures to\npreserve  the  integrity  of  the  area  from  encroachment  or  environmental\ndegradation due to road improvement and increased access.\n\n\f31\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(iii)  Midway  through  project  implementation  (end  2003),  the  Government,  in\ncooperation  with  ADB,  will  undertake  a  detailed  review  of  the  Project  and  its\nimplementation  status.  The  scope  of  the  review  will  include  all  aspects  of  the\nProject, including land acquisition and resettlement. Following completion of the\nreview, the Borrower or Government will take all necessary actions to correct any\nproblems identified in project implementation.\n\nResettlement. The Government will take all measures necessary to implement to\nthe satisfaction of ADB the RPs developed for project roads, including the EMDP\ncomponents of each RP. The Government will ensure that all people affected by\nthe Project are compensated and resettled in accordance with the requirements\nof  the  resettlement  framework,  and  RPs,  the  Government's  procedures,  and\nADB's involuntary resettlement policy.\n\nEthnic Minorities. The Government will ensure that the EMDPs are designed and\nimplemented  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  framework,  the  RPs,  and\nADB's indigenous people policy and in coordination with the Government\u2019s ethnic\nminority program.\n\nHealth  Risks.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  any  civil  works  contracts  for\nworks  to  be  carried  out  under  this  Project  require  the  civil  works  contractors  to\nconduct  information  and  education  campaigns  on  sexually  transmitted  diseases\nand HIV/AIDS for construction workers as part of a health and safety program at\ncampsites during the construction period.\n\n(vii) \n\nLabor  Laws.  The  Government  will  set  employment  targets  for  women  for  road\nconstruction  activities,  as  well  as  require  contractors  not  to  differentiate  wages\nbetween  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  type.  Also,  child  labor  will  not  be\nallowed in the construction activities and camps.\n\n(viii)  Operation  and  Maintenance.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  improved\nroads  are  maintained  to  design  standards  and  in  accordance  with  sound\nroad\nmaintenance  practices.  The  Government  will  ensure \nmaintenance  plans  are  prepared  for  the  improved  roads,  on  the  basis  of  the\nagreed-upon maintenance standards, traffic volumes, and assessment of needs.\n\nthat  annual \n\nRoad  Sector  Reform.  The  Government  will  continue  strengthening  the  legal\nframework,  regulation,  and  institutions  active  in  the  road  subsector,  specifically\nVRA, in accordance with the action plan agreed to by ADB. New regulations for\nVRA\u2019s mandate, responsibilities, and functions improving upon the framework for\ninterim regulation of VRA, will be enacted by 31 December 2002.\n\nSector  Studies.  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  all  transport  sector\nand road subsector studies undertaken in Viet Nam; provide ADB with copies of\nall  available  documents  relevant  to  such  studies,  including  consultants'  reports;\nand  ensure that ADB has the opportunity to comment on the recommendations\ncontained therein.\n\n(xi) \n\nThe Government and ADB will from time to time exchange views on progress in\ncarrying  out  the  policies  and  actions  recommended  by  transport  and  road\nstudies.  The  Government  will  maintain  a  policy  dialogue  with  ADB  on  problems\n\n\f32\n\nand constraints affecting the growth and development of the road subsector, and\nin particular on road maintenance and investment, and road user charges.\n\n(xii) \n\nSelection of Subprojects. A subproject is eligible for financing under the loan if it:\n\n(a) \n\nis  economically,  technically,  and  environmentally  feasible  and  has  an\neconomic internal rate of return greater than 12 percent;\n\n(b) \n\nhas received all applicable Governmental clearances; and\n\n(c) \n\ncomplies with ADB\u2019s and the Government\u2019s procedural requirements, and\nresettlement, social, and environment policies and guidelines.\n\n(xiii)  Project  Performance  Monitoring.  The  Government  will  carry  out  project\nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation  by  compiling  and  analyzing  appropriate\ntraffic  and  socioeconomic  data  and  other  data  for  project  roads.  Prior  to  the\ncommencing  of  civil  works,  PMU-5  and  ADB  will  agree  on  the  data  to  be\ncollected and the methodology for their analysis based upon the baseline survey,\nwhich was carried out in 2001.\n\nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness\n\nThe Government will have approved RP for each core road, as required, and will have\n\n116.\nprovided the necessary funding and staffing at PMU-5 and the PDOTs.\n\nC. \n\nConditions for Award of Contract for Civil Works\n\n117. ADB will not approve award of any civil works contract for any road to be financed from\nthe loan proceeds unless the Government has completed satisfactorily and in accordance with\nthe approved RP for that road compensation payment  and relocation to new sites, and ensured\nrehabilitation assistance is in place prior to obtaining possession and rights to the required land.\n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\n118.\nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  55,327,000  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Provincial\nRoads Improvement Sector Project, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years,\nand with an interest charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5\npercent  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in\naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.\n\n23 November 2001\n\n                       \n\nTADAO

NAM\n\nPolicy Objective\n\nBackground\n\nFuture Actions\n\n1. Establish a sound legal\nbasis for Viet Nam\nRoad Administration\n(VRA) to act as a\nmodern highway road\nagency.\n\n2. Program the\n\nmaintenance and\ncapital investment\nbudget for the entire\nhighway network\nbased on modern\nmaintenance\nprinciples.\n\nVRA is presently\nfunctioning under an\ninterim decree. As the new\nRoad Traffic Act was\npassed in June 2001\n(based on assistance from\nprevious technical\nassistance (TA)),\npermanent are needed to\ngovern VRA\u2019s respon-\nsibilities and functions, and\ninternal operations.\n\nA pilot program for the\nimplementation of HDM-4\nand RoSyPlan software for\nroad maintenance planning\nand BridgeMAN software\nfor bridge maintenance\nplanning was carried out\nunder previous Asian\nDevelopment Bank and\nWorld Bank Tas. However\nthey have not been\ninternalized in the\nmaintenance planning\nprocess. Similarly road\ncondition data has been\ncollected only for 2,500\nkilometers of the national\nhighway.\n\n41\n\nAppendix 6, page 1\n\nAction Plan under this\nProject\n\nTwo draft permanent\nregulations, one on VRA\u2019s\nresponsibilities and\nfunctions and the other on\nVRA\u2019s operations are to be\nprepared by June 2002\nand  come into force by\nDecember 2002\n\nMinistry of Transport to be\nasked to submit details of how\nVRA is implementing these\nregulations, and future actions\nwill be discussed based on\nthese submissions. A priority\narea for future action is\nexpected to be the entry of the\nprivate sector into road\ntransport operations and road\ninfrastructure maintenance.\n\nVRA will institute systems\nto (i) regularly collect traffic\ndata and road condition\ndata on 13,500 km of\nnational highway network\nby June 2003; (ii) develop\nappropriate road\nmaintenance, bridge\nmaintenance, bridge\ninspection and assessment\nfor the national highway\nnetwork, as well as\noperational standards for\nexpressways by June\n2003, (iii) institutionalize\nthe use of HDM-4,\nRoSyPlan, and BridgeMAN\nsoftware throughout VRA\nand the  Provincial\nDepartment of Transport\n(PDOTs), and (iv) using\nthe results of (i), (ii), and\n(iii) develop an annual\nmaintenance program for\nthe national highway\nnetwork by December\n2003.\n\nThe  Government is to be\nasked to extend the use of the\nmodern planning and analysis\ntools used by VRA for\nmaintenance programming of\nthe national highway to\nprogressively increase (i)\ncapital investment\nprogramming of the national\nhighway network by VRA; (ii)\nmaintenance programming of\nthe provincial  road networks\nthrough VRA assistance with\nanalysis given by VRA to\nPDOTs and to Ministry of\nPlanning and Investment (MPI)\nand Ministry of Finance (MOF)\nbudget allocation process for\nprovincial road maintenance;\n(iii) capital investment\nprogramming of the provincial\nhighway network through VRA\nassistance with analysis to the\nPDOTs and to MPI and MOF\nin the budget allocation\nprocess for provincial road\ncapital investment.\n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 6, page 2\n\nPolicy Objective\n\nBackground\n\nAction Plan under this\nProject\n\nFuture Actions\n\n3.\n\nImprove the VRA\u2019s\noperational and\nfinancial management\nsystems so that it can\nplay its role in line with\nits responsibilities and\nfunctions under the\npermanent decrees.\n\nThe new decrees will spell\nout the role of VRA in line\nwith the new act, and will\nbe broadly in line with the\nfunctions stated in the\ninterim decree. TA was\nprovided to identify ways to\nstrengthen VRA\u2019s\norganizational focus on its\nnew functions and also to\nimprove its financial\nmanagement processes.\n\nIt will also implement the\nfinancial management\nimprovement procedures\nagreed to by VRA under\nthe TA assistance by\nDecember 2003\n\n4. Preserve the asset\nbase of the road\nnetwork by ensuring\nsustainable funding for\nroad maintenance and\nefficient utilization of\nmaintenance\nallocations.\n\nA proposal for creating a\nroad fund was developed\nby MOT with the help of a\nTA but it has not been\nadopted by the\nGovernment because of\nmisgivings by other\nGovernment agencies.\nPeriodic maintenance is\ncarried out using force\naccount procedures\nthrough subsidiary SOEs\nof  VRA.\n\nA study will be carried out\nto identify maintenance\nfunding requirements for\nnational, provincial, and\nlower level roads; possible\nsources of funds; ways to\nstructure a road fund to\nensure sustainable funding\nfor maintenance, while\naddressing legitimate\nconcerns of all\nstakeholders; and ways to\nimprove efficient utilization\nof maintenance allocations\nby implementing\ncontracting out of periodic\nmaintenance works. This\nstudy will start in June\n2002 and be completed by\nDecember 2002.\n\nVRA to progressively divest\nitself of state-owned\nenterprises (SOEs) involved in\nroad maintenance, road\nconstruction, and road\ntransport operations; and\nsimultaneously develop the\nmanagement capability to\ncontract out such works and\nservices and to monitor\ncontractor performance. This\nshould also be coordinated\nwith the results of the TA\nStudy on SOEs in the road\nconstruction sector that will be\nundertaken by COPP.\n\nThe Government is to\nformulate an action plan to\nimplement a road fund while\nVRA develops an action plan\nto progressively increase the\namount of periodic\nmaintenance that it contracts\nout until all such work is\ncontracted out.\n\n\f43\n\nAppendix 7, page 1\n\nFRAMEWORK OF INTERIM REGULATIONS FOR VIET NAM ROAD ADMINISTRATION1\n\nREGULATION ON THE ORGANIZATION AND ACTIVITIES OF THE\nVIET NAM ROAD ADMINISTRATION\n\nChapter I:\n\nGeneral Provisions\n\nArticle 1:\n\nViet Nam Road Administration\n\n1. \n\nThe Viet Nam Road Administration was established pursuant to Government\nDecree No. 07/CP dated 30 January 1993.\n\n2. \n\nThe Viet Nam Road Administration shall be abbreviated as \u201cVNRA.\u201d\n\nArticle 2:\n\nScope\n\nThe  VNRA  is  responsible  for  the  administration  of  road  transportation  on  behalf  of\nthe  State  throughout  Viet  Nam.

The  project  Executing\nAgency  is  the  Project  Management  Unit-5  (PMU-5)  under  the  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)\nlocated in Hanoi. The Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) was based on generic outline\ndesigns  prior  to  preliminary  engineering  and  detailed  engineering  designs  of  the  proposed\nimprovements.  The  TA  efforts  focused  on  screening  and  prioritizing  rehabilitation  and\nmaintenance improvements for provincial roads in the 18 northern provinces based on social,\neconomic, and road condition justification criteria.\n\n2.\nThe interim report selected core roads from a master list of more than 150 provincial\nroads in the study region. The purpose of the IEE is to screen and document likely adverse\nand  beneficial  impacts  of  implementing  the  rehabilitation  works  for  one  of  the  nine  core\nroads,  Provincial  Road  #1101(DT185)  in  Tuyen  Quang  Province.  Another  objective  of  the\nIEE, consistent with ADB and Vietnamese guidelines, was to identify significant unavoidable\nadverse  impacts  and  determine  if  further  analyses  are  needed  through  means  of  a  more\ndetailed environmental impact assessment (EIA). The IEE was in accordance with the ADB\u2019s\nEnvironmental  Assessment  Requirements  and  Review  Procedures,  and  Environmental\nGuidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects,  as  well  as  with  Viet  Nam\u2019s  environmental\nprocedures. The environmental category of the overall Project is \u201cB.\u201d\n\nB.\n\nDescription of the Project\n\n3.\nRehabilitation  and  maintenance  improvements  for  Road  #1101  (DT185)  would  be\naccomplished for an estimated 58 kilometers (km) of road within the existing road reservation\narea, except for one location where new alignment is needed to bypass a sensitive protected\nhistorical and natural resource site. The road is proposed as a class V road that requires a\nsingle carriageway of 3.5 meters wide with 1.5 meter shoulders, for an embankment width of\n6.5  meters  within  an  existing  right-of-way.  This  varies  depending  on  rural  or  built-up  areas\nthat  it  crosses  and  serves.  A  class  V  road  according  to  the  Vietnamese  standard  has  a\ndesign  speed  of  20  to  40  km  per  hour  (kph).  Traffic  operating  on  this  road  was  recently\nsurveyed at 47 conventional motor vehicles (CMVs) daily.\n\nThe road commences at Nong Tien commune (in Tuyen Quang town), traverses an\n4.\narea known as Kim Binh, and terminates at Chiem Hoa. It presently has an earth surface 6\nmeters  wide.  The  section  of  the  road  connecting  Chiem  Hoa  was  improved  to  a  gravel\naggregate surface in 1998. Upgrading is planned during 2001-2002 for two fords on the road.\nThe Provincial Department of Transport (PDOT) proposes paving and/or sealing the road. A\n5 km section is to be treated with asphalt concrete, while the remainder of the road will be\ndouble  surface  treated.  The  section  of  road  between  km  36  to  46  is  in  especially  poor\ncondition.\n\n1  TA 3455-VIE:  Viet Nam Provincial Road Improvement Project, for $ 1.0 million, approved on 14 June 2000.\n\n                  \n\n\f53\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n5.\n  The  section  of  existing  road  improvements  goes  through  four  communes  in  the\nnorthern district of Yen Son, three communes in the northern district of Chiem Hoa, and two\nwithin Tuyen Quang township. In 1999 Yen Son District  had  population of 167,276 and land\narea of 1,208 hectares (ha) Chiem Hoa District had a population of 126,131 and land area of\n1,449 ha; and Tuyen Quang Township  a  population of 218,574 and land area of 43.69 ha.\nAlong the road are several \u201cspecial difficulty communes\u201d identified under Program 185. The\nroad serves a number of ethnic minority populated communes.\n\n6.\nThe terrain is hilly with a maximum road grade of 14 percent. Pockets of forest and\ncultivated lands are found on both sides of the road. The road is close to the Gam River just\noutside  of  Tuyen  Quang  Township  and  the  road  crosses  several  streams.  During  the  rainy\nseason  some  sections  become  inundated.  Along  the  immediate  road  corridor  very  little\nnatural forest remains and some areas near the road are now being reforested.\n\n7.\nAir  quality  particularly  in  the  first  sections  of  the  road  coming  out  of  Tuyen  Quang\nTownship is heavily influenced by pollution from industrial uses, including a cement factory,\nand from dust-generating traffic associated with industrial activity. The remaining sections of\nthe  road  have  no  significant  sources  of  air  pollution  and  air  quality  is  good,  however  in  the\ndry  season  dust  caused  by  road  traffic  can  be  a  nuisance.  No  formally  designated  waste\ndisposal sites exist within or are adjacent to the road.\n\nThe  existing  road  passes  through  a  small  part  of  a  valued  cultural  historical  site\n8.\nlocated  near  Kim  Binh,  location  of  the  second  Vietnamese  Communist  Party  Congress\nConvention. The Kim Binh Cultural and Historical Site is identified by a large cement placard\nmarker  near  km  46.  The  historical/cultural  site  covers  1,937  ha,  including  900  ha  of\nforestland. No other precious or valuable ecological sites, national parks, nature reserves, or\nsensitive sites have been identified along the road.\n\nD.\n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironmental Problems Due to Location and Design\n\n9.\nThe project road will generally follow the existing alignment that has been in place for\na  very  long  time.  No  significant  impacts  are  expected  since  improvements  such  as\nresurfacing,  repair  of  existing  cross  and  side  drainage  facilities,  and  spot  rehabilitation  of\nexisting  facilities  all  lie  within  the  existing  road  reservation.  Most  affected  land  within  road\nreservation  areas  is  either  used  for  agriculture  or  is  nonproductive.  The  principles  of\n\u201cavoidance\u201d and \u201cminimization\u201d regarding mitigation of any adverse impacts of environmental\nconditions  has  been  emphasized  during  the  project  identification  and  preparation  phase.\nMitigation of impact on the historical/cultural site at Kim Binh has been proposed in the form\nof  a  new  road  bypass  alignment  and  closure  of  the  existing  road  through  the  site.  The\nproposed  new  alignment  consists  of  about  600  meters  along  an  existing  small  secondary\nroad  and  600  meters  of  new  road  through  an  abandoned  oil  palm  plantation,  which  will\nrequire land acquisition and compensation.\n\nMinor road realignment within the road reservation will require clearing of small strips\n10.\nof land to rehabilitate drainage or to improve road safety conditions. The road will be lowered\nat any locations in built-up areas to avoid impacts on settlements. Where human settlement\n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\n\nor productive agricultural land activities have located on road reservation areas, appropriate\ncompensation  will  be  paid  if  clearing  these  areas  is  necessary  for  the  road  works.  These\nissues  are  addressed  separately  in  an  Initial  Social  and  Poverty  Analysis  Report and  if\nneeded in a separate resettlement and compensation plan.\n\n2.\n\nEnvironmental Problems Associated with the Construction Stage\n\n11.\nThe  potential  for  construction  activities  to  have  adverse  effects  on  the  surrounding\nenvironment  is  slight.  The  threat  of  erosion  and  silt  run  off  from  the  road  affecting  several\nstreams  the  road  crossings  is  small  to  moderate.  This  will  be  mitigated  through  standard\noperating  construction  practices  specified  in  contract  documents,  and  road  construction\nworks will be confined entirely within road reservation areas or right-of-way.\n\nThe  construction  contract  will  provide \n\n12.\nfor  revegetation  of  cut  slopes  and\nembankments during construction, and provide for suitable silt traps and other runoff control\nstructures. Quarries and materials will be from existing sites if available. Selection of any new\nsites will be done with the objective of avoiding environmentally sensitive areas, and contract\ndocuments will provide for quarry rehabilitation for sites not having a continuing commercial\nuse.\n\nContract  documents  will  include  provisions  mandating  appropriate  measures  to\n13.\nprotect ambient standards of air quality, water quality, and noise. Dust will be controlled by\nregular spraying of water, noise will be controlled by ensuring that all construction equipment\nis fitted with efficient engine silencers, and work in built-up areas will be restricted to daylight\nhours.\n\n3.\n\nPotential Environmental Enhancement Measures and Additional\nConsiderations\n\n14.\nThe  long-term  net  beneficial  effects  will  offset  any  temporary  unavoidable  adverse\nimpacts due to construction. In the case of the Kim Binh Cultural and Historical Site, special\nenvironmental enhancement mitigation actions may be implemented to prevent unwarranted\nencroachment.  These  will  be  determined  by  the  PDOT  in  coordination  with  the  provincial\nauthorities  responsible  for  the  site  and  may  include  demarcation  of  the  site  boundaries,\nfencing and/or checkpoints.\n\nE.\n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\n15.\nThe  implementing  agency,  PMU-5,  and  the  Tuyen  Quang  PDOT  will  be  responsible\nfor  environmental  management  and  monitoring  for  this  subproject,  including  supervision  of\nimplementation  of  mitigation  measures  and  promotion  of  appropriate  construction  methods.\nPMU-5  and  the  Tuyen  Quang  PDOT  will  appoint  staff  to  the  environment  and  social  units\n(ESUs) within their respective organizations. They will participate in project identification and\npreparation, \nif  necessary  EIA),  and\ndevelopment  of  an  environmental  management  and  monitoring  program  for  this  and  other\nproject  roads.  PMU-5  and  the  Tuyen  Quang  PDOT,  assisted  by  project  consultants,  will\nensure that they fully comply with the social and environmental recommendations in project\ncontract documents.\n\nincluding  environmental  assessment  (IEE  and \n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 12, page 4\n\nF.\n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\n16.\nThe  one  set  of  potential  environmental  impacts  relate  to  the  Kim  Binh  Cultural  and\nHistorical Site. Implementation of the proposed bypass alignment of the road and closure of\nthe old road through the site, and enhancement mitigation measures put in place where the\nnew  alignment  passes  near  the  site,  should  effectively  negate  any  negative  impacts.\nElsewhere  only  slight  environmental  impacts  are  expected  due  to  construction  and  minor\nroad realignment but they should be temporary and minimal if good standard environmental\nconstruction practices are maintained.\n\nG.\n\nConclusion\n\nAside  from  the  road  realignment  and  construction  near  the  Kim  Binh  Cultural  and\n17.\nHistorical  Site,  the  subproject  will  not  have  significant  adverse  impacts  on  the  surrounding\nenvironment  and  should  be  outweighed  by  the  socioeconomic  and  poverty  reduction\nbenefits.  Environmental  management  plans  will  mitigate  or  minimize  minor  or  temporary\nconstruction  impacts.  Where  needed,  land  compensation  and  resettlement  action  plans  will\nbe coordinated by PMU-5 and the Tuyen Quang PDOT. In accordance with ADB regulations\na full EIA should not be required.\n\nThe Government law has two stages of environmental assessment: (i) a preliminary\n18.\nenvironmental assessment (similar, but not fully equal, to ADB\u2019s IEE), and (ii) an EIA. An EIA\nis  required  when  a  significant  environmental  impact  has  been  identified  during  the\npreliminary environmental assessment. An EIA also is mandated for all major projects, which\nin the case of roads are those more than 50 km in length, and when a project road is located\nnear  protected  parks,  environmentally  sensitive  sites,  tourist  sites,  and  international  and\nnational  cultural  and  historical  sites  (Circular  Letter  of  Guidance  on  Setting  Up  and\nAppraising  the  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (EIA)  Report  for  Investment  Projects,\nCircular No. 490/1998/TT-BKHCNMT).\n\nAs per the circular letter, this subproject will require submission of an Application for a\n19.\nRegistration for Securing Environmental Standards from the minister of science, technology\nand  environment  (MOSTE)  or  the  chairman  of  the  Provincial  People\u2019s  Committee.\nAccompanying the application must be a copy of the preliminary environment assessment, in\nVietnamese. Since this subproject is both longer than 50 km and passes near a cultural and\nhistorical  site,  a  decision  will  be  required  from  MOSTE  and/or  the  Provincial  People\u2019s\nCommittee as to whether an EIA will be necessary.\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 13, page 1\n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.\n\nApplicability of the Different Components of the Framework\n\n1.\nThe  resettlement  framework  consists  of  two  components.  The  first  deals  with\nland acquisition and resettlement of people affected by the Project. The provisions of the\nland acquisition and resettlement component will be applicable in all cases where land\nacquisition  and/or  resettlement  is  required  as  part  of  project  implementation.  The\nprovisions of the second, the ethnic minority development component, will be applicable\nin all cases where there are three minority people living in the zone of influence (ZOI)1 of\na subproject road.\n\nB. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement Component\n\n2.\n\nResettlement Principles\n\n(cid:1)(cid:2)\nThe project\u2019s policy framework and entitlements have built upon the laws of the\nGovernment,  principally  the  1993  Land  Law,  Decree  22/CP  (1998),  Decree  87/CP\n(1994),  and  the  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  (1995)  of  the  Asian  Development\nBank  (ADB).  With  the  promulgation  of  Decree  22/CP  (24  April  1998),  the  Government\nhas issued legislation regarding resettlement, which approaches the principles of ADB's\npolicy.  However,  provisions  and  principles  adopted  in  the  framework  for  the  Project\nsupercede the provisions of relevant decrees currently in force in Viet Nam wherever a\ngap exists. The following basic principles have been adopted for the Project:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe principal objective of ADB's policy and the resettlement plan (RP) is\nto  ensure  that  populations  affected  by  the  Project  should  be  at  least  as\nwell  off,  if  not  better  off  than  they  would  have  been  without  the  Project.\nAffected  populations  should  be  able  to  maintain  and  preferably  improve\ntheir standard of living and quality of life.\n\nThe  populations  affected  by  the  Project  are  defined  as  those  who  may\nstand to lose, as a consequence of the Project, all or part of physical and\nnonphysical  assets,  including  homes,  homesteads,  productive  lands,\ncommercial properties, tenancy, income-earning opportunities, social and\ncultural  activities  and  relationships,  and  other  losses  that  may  be\nidentified during the process of resettlement planning.\n\nidentifying  possible\nInvoluntary  resettlement  will  be  minimized  by \nalternative project designs, and appropriate social, economic, operational,\nand engineering solutions that have the least impact on populations in the\nproject area.\n\nA census/inventory of assets and socioeconomic survey were carried out\nfor  core  roads  will  also  be  carried  out  for  all  subproject  roads  prior  to\npreparation  of  resettlement  plans  (RPs)  for  each.  The  findings  for  each\n\n                                                          \n1    Zone of influence is defined as all communes through which a subproject road passes, and any other\n     commune located within close proximity of a subproject road..\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 13, page 2\n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\nwill  represent  the  cutoff  date  for  compensation  eligibility  for  physical\nassets as these are identified.\n\nAll people affected will be entitled to be compensated for their lost assets,\nincomes,  and  businesses  at  replacement  cost;  and  provided  with\nrehabilitation  measures  sufficient  to  assist  them  to  improve  or  at  least\nrestore  their  preproject  living  standards,  income  levels,  and  productive\ncapacity.\n\nAll  affected  populations  will  be  equally  eligible  for  compensation  and\nrehabilitation assistance, irrespective of tenure status, social or economic\nstanding,  and  any  such  factors  that  may  discriminate  against  achieving\nthe objectives outlined above.\n\n(vii) \n\nIn  the  case  of  population  relocation,  efforts  will  be  made  for  the  existing\nsocial  and  cultural  institutions  of  the  people  being  resettled  and  host\ncommunity to be maintained to the extent possible.\n\n(viii)  Preparation  of  RPs  (as  part  of  subproject  preparation)  and  their\nthe  participation  and\n\nto  be  carried  out  with \n\nimplementation  are \nconsultation of affected people.\n\nAdequate  budgetary  support  will  be  fully  committed  and  be  made\navailable to cover the costs of land acquisition and resettlement within the\nagreed implementation period.\n\nConstruction  activities  will  not  commence  until  the  required  lands  have\nbeen  fully  acquired,  and  the  affected  people  appropriately  compensated\nand assisted in accordance with the approved framework and RPs.\n\nDetailed  RPs  for  implementation  will  be  translated  into  the  local\nlanguages  and  placed  in  project  and  commune  offices  for  the  reference\nby the affected people, as well as any interested groups.\n\nAppropriate  reporting,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  mechanisms  will  be\nidentified  and  set  in  place  as  part  of  the  resettlement  management\nsystem. Evaluation of the land acquisition process and the final outcome\nwill be conducted independently of the Executing Agency.\n\n2.\n\nProject  Resettlement  and  Rehabilitation  Policy  and  Entitlement\nMatrix\n\n3.\nThe project resettlement and rehabilitation policy and entitlements are designed\nto  cover  compensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  for  lost  assets;  and  restore  or\nenhance the livelihoods of all categories (directly and indirectly affected, title holders and\nnontitle  holders)  of  affected  people.  The  people  affected  will  not  only  receive\nreplacement  land  or  cash  for  land  and  other  assets  at  replacement  cost,  but  many\nadditional  measures  will  be  taken  such  as  special  assistance  to  vulnerable  groups.

Ethnic  minorities  in  Viet\nNam are recognized as vulnerable groups by the Government and given special policy\nconsiderations;  development  interventions  have  been  targeted  them.  In  1994,  the\nCommittee  for  Ethnic  Minorities  and  Mountainous  Areas  (CEMMA)  was  created  and\nassigned  a  role  of  monitoring  and  coordinating  ethnic  minority  development  activities.\nThe Government has in place a number of programs aimed at integrating ethnic minority\ngroups  into  overall  Vietnamese  society  and  in  particular  increasing  their  greater\nparticipation  in  mainstream  economic  life.  The  Government  is  seeking  to  address  the\ninequities  of  both  development  and  infrastructure  provision  in  the  remote  and\nmountainous areas with Program 135. Specific objectives of the program are to reduce\nthe number of poor households, provide basic infrastructure (sufficient water supply and\n\"motorable\" roads) and encourage social and economic development (attain 70 percent\nof  school  age  children  enrolled  and  attending  school,  and  encourage  development  of\nrural markets). The Project will support and coordinate with Program 135 by developing\nand implementing of subproject ethnic minority development plans (EMDPs).\n\nThe  overall  objectives  of  EMDPs  are  to  ensure  that  the  Project  provides  the\n5.\nopportunity  for  ethnic  minority  groups  to  reap  project  benefits  that  are  equal  to,  or\ngreater than, the dominant cultural group.\n\nThe main features of the EMDP process will be a preliminary screening process,\n6.\na social assessment to determine the degree and nature of impact of improving the road,\na  strategic  action  plan,  and  project  monitoring.  Consultations  with,  and  participation  of,\nthe  minority  groups,  their  leaders,  and  local  government  officials  in  the  design  and\nimplementation of subproject EMDPs will be an integral part of the overall ethnic minority\ndevelopment  component.  Coordination  with  existing  Government  programs  for  ethnic\nminorities will be essential.\n\n7.\nThe ethnic minority development component will consist of a number of activities\nincluding mitigation measures for any potentially negative impacts identified in the social\nassessment, any requirements for modifying subproject design, and outline of supporting\nor  development  assistance.  Where  land  clearance  and  acquisition  is  required  that  will\naffect  ethnic  minority  communities,  the  Project  will  ensure  that  their  rights  will  not  be\nviolated and that they are appropriately and adequately compensated for the clearance,\ntaking,  or  use  of  any  part  of  their  land,  provided  that  the  clearance,  taking,  or  use  is\nundertaken  in  a  manner  that  is  culturally  acceptable  to  them.  The  compensation  will\nfollow the process established in this resettlement framework.\n\n2. \n\nDevelopment Activities\u2013Rural Development Support\n\nIn  general,  development  benefits  to  be  provided  to  ethnic  minority  groups  will\n\n8.\ninclude the following:\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 13, page 5\n\nCommunity  Infrastructure  Fund.  This  fund  will  be  given  to  communes  to\n9.\nimprove  (i)  physical  access  such  as  trails  and  footbridges  that  will  be  designed  and\nconstructed  through  village  consultation  and  participation  in  response  to  community\nneeds;  and  (ii)  community  infrastructure  and  services  such  as  installation  of  tube  wells\nrepairing  of  existing  defunct  ones;  construction  of  community  markets,\nand \nkindergartens,  or  other  community  facilities  required  in  any  specific  location;  and\nconstruction  of  village  fishponds  and  renovation  of  existing  fishponds.  The  communes\nwill  be  assisted  by  Project  Management  Unit  (PMU-5)  and  provincial  departments  of\ntransport  (PDOTs)  to  develop  proposals  to  people's  committees  for  approval.  Qualified\nlocal contractors will be engaged by the PDOTs. These contractors will be encouraged\nby the PDOTs to give preferential access to communes to road construction employment\nopportunities to the extent possible.\n\n10.\nParticipatory  Agricultural  Extension  Services.  Agricultural  extension\nassistance  will  be  provided  to  farmers  for  crop  intensification  and  diversification  and\nfarmer-to-farmer  training.  PMU-5  will  coordinate  with  CEMMA,  Ministry  of  Agriculture\nand  Rural  Development,  and  mass  organizations  to  provide  participatory  agricultural\nextension  services  based  on  a  participatory  agricultural  extension  services  program\nbeing implemented by SNV Netherlands Development Organization through Ministry of\nAgriculture and Rural Development.\n\n11.\nSupport  Services  for  Credit  Utilization.  The  Project  will  facilitate  information\ndissemination  on  available  credit  and  training  on  how  to  utilize  credit  services.  The\nproject  consultants  will  facilitate  training  of  the  Women\u2019s  Union  and/or  Farmers\u2019\nAssociation on how to provide these support services to the communes.\n\n3. \n\nBudget\n\nThe cost estimate for all EMDPs for the Project amounts to $1.5 million. This  will\n12.\ncover EMDPs for the yet-to-be selected road sections where there are ethnic minorities\nliving  within  their  ZOI.  The  amount  to  be  allocated  for  each  road  section  will  be\ndetermined  through  a  participatory  process  according  to  the  needs  and  socioeconomic\nconditions  of  the  communities  with  the  ZOI  of  each  road.  Adequate  budgetary  support\nwill  be  fully  committed  and  made  available  to  cover  the  costs  of  the  EMDPs  within  the\nagreed implementation period.\n\n4. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nRP  implementation  will  commence  after  the  project  supervision  consultants  are\n 13.\nmobilized.  The  consultants  will  work  closely  with  and  assist  the  PDOTs  on  all\nresettlement activities. Civil works contracts for each road will only be awarded after all\ncompensation  and  relocation  has  been  satisfactorily  completed  for  each  road  and\nrehabilitation measures are in place.\n\nDetailed  design  of  the  ethnic  minority  development  component  can  only  take\n14.\nplace  during  project \nit  requires  appropriately  qualified\ninternational and domestic consultants working side by side with and training PMU-5 and\nthe PDOTs and other members of the project team, as well as the active participation of\nthe  Hmong  communities.  The  ethnic  minority  development  component  will  be\nimplemented during and after the land acquisition and resettlement process.\n\nimplementation  because \n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 14, page 1\n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN\nRoad 0307:  Sa Pa \u2013 Ban Den Districts, Lao Cai Province\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\n 1.\nThe  Sa  Pa-Ban  Den  14  kilometers  (km)  road  is  a  single  carriageway  of  3.5\nmeters  (m)  width  with  an  embankment  width  of  6.1  m  within  an  existing  right-of-way.\nThe road traverses six communes, and all communes will be affected by land acquisition\nto widen the embankment to 6.5 m width.\n \n2.\nThis  document  is  a  summary  of  the  resettlement  plan  (RP),  which  has  been\nprepared for this subproject. This RP consists of two components: the first provides for\nland acquisition and resettlement of people affected by the Project, the second  is the\nethnic minority development plan (EMDP) required because of the large ethnic minority\npopulation within the zone of influence (ZOI)1 of the subproject road.\n\nB. \n\nLand Acquisition And Resettlement Component\n\n1. \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n\n3.\nBased on the initial results of the census and inventory of losses of all potential\npeople affected, and socioeconomic survey of 20 percent of all those affected, a total of\n200 households will be affected by land acquisition. The entire population within the ZOI\nof  the subproject consists  of the  Hmong ethnic group, which is a minority ethnic group\nwithin  Viet  Nam.  The  road  is  located  within  a  rural  mountainous  setting.  An  estimated\n10.6  hectares  (ha)  of  land  will  be  acquired,  affecting  6.9  ha  of  crops  and  420  trees.\nApproximately  27  households  will  be  severely  affected  by  loss  of  agricultural  land  and\nhouses,  and  will  relocate  their  houses,  businesses,  and  other  structures;  17  other\nstructures  (kitchens,  toilets,  buffalo  stables,  walls)  will  also  have  to  be  dismantled  and\nrebuilt.  The  consultations  confirm  that  the  potentially  affected  households  are  willing  to\nmove back and rebuild their houses on their remaining land beyond the right-of-way. If\nany households do not have remaining land to rebuild their houses, they will be assisted\nby the Project to look for replacement land at a location satisfactory to them.\n\n2. \n\nResettlement Principles\n\n(cid:1)(cid:2)\nThe policy framework and entitlements for the Project have built upon the laws of\nthe  Government,  principally  the  1993  Land  Law,  Decree  22/CP  (1998),  Decree  87/CP\n(1994),  and  the  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  (1995)  of  the  Asian  Development\nBank  (ADB).  With  the  promulgation  of  Decree  22/CP  (24  April  1998),  the  Government\nissued  legislation  regarding  resettlement,  which  approaches  the  principles  of  ADB's\npolicy. However, provisions and principles adopted in the resettlement framework for the\nProject  supercede  the  provisions  of  relevant  decrees  currently  in  force  in  Viet  Nam\nwherever a gap exists. The following basic principles have been adopted for the Project:\n\n(i) \n\nThe principal objective of ADB's policy and the resettlement plan (RP) is\nto  ensure  that  populations  affected  by  the  Project  should  be  at  least  as\nwell  off,  if  not  better  off  than  they  would  have  been  without  the  Project.\n\n                                                          \n1   The ZOI is defined as all communes through which the project road passes, and any other\n     commune located within close proximity of the project road.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 14, page 2\n\nAffected  populations  should  be  able  to  maintain  and  preferably  improve\ntheir standard of living and quality of life.\n\nThe  populations  affected  by  the  Project  are  defined  as  those  who  may\nstand to lose, as a consequence of the Project, all or part of physical and\nnonphysical  assets,  including  homes,  homesteads,  productive  lands,\ncommercial properties, tenancy, income-earning opportunities, social and\ncultural  activities  and  relationships,  and  other  losses  that  may  be\nidentified during the process of resettlement planning.\n\nInvoluntary  resettlement  will  be  minimized  by \nidentifying  possible\nalternative project designs, and appropriate social, economic, operational,\nand engineering solutions that have the least impact on populations in the\nproject area.\n\nThe  findings  for  each  will  represent  the  cutoff  date  for  compensation\neligibility for physical assets as these are identified.\n\nAll people affected will be entitled to be compensated for their lost assets,\nincomes,  and  businesses  at  replacement  cost,  and  provided  with\nrehabilitation  measures  sufficient  to  assist  them  to  improve  or  at  least\nrestore  their  preproject  living  standards,  income  levels,  and  productive\ncapacity.\n\nAll  affected  populations  will  be  equally  eligible  for  compensation  and\nrehabilitation assistance, irrespective of tenure status, social or economic\nstanding,  and  any  such  factors  that  may  discriminate  against  achieving\nthe objectives outlined above.\n\n(vii) \n\nIn  the  case  of  population  relocation,  efforts  will  be  made  for  the  existing\nsocial  and  cultural  institutions  of  the  people  being  resettled  and  host\ncommunity to be maintained to the extent possible.\n\n(viii)  Preparation  and  implementation  of  the  RP  is  to  be  carried  out  with  the\n\nparticipation and consultation of affected people.\n\nAdequate budgetary support for an estimated D1,479,606 ($0.099 million)\nwill be fully committed and be made available to cover the costs of land\nacquisition and resettlement within the agreed implementation period.\n\nConstruction  activities  will  not  commence  until  the  required  lands  have\nbeen  fully  acquired  and  those  affected  are  appropriately  compensated\nand assisted in accordance with the approved framework and RP.\n\nThe detailed RP will be translated into the local languages and placed in\nproject and commune offices for the reference of those affected, as well\nas any interested groups.\n\n(xii) \n\nAppropriate  reporting,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  mechanisms  will  be\nidentified  and  set  in  place  as  part  of  the  resettlement  management\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 14, page 3\n\nsystem. Evaluation of the land acquisition process and the final outcome\nwill be conducted independent of the Executing Agency.\n\n3.\n\nProject  Resettlement  and  Rehabilitation  Policy  and  Entitlement\nMatrix\n\n5.\nThe  project    resettlement  and  rehabilitation  policy  and  entitlements  were\ndesigned  to  cover  compensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  for  lost  assets  and\nrestore or enhance the livelihoods of all categories (directly and indirectly affected, title\nholders  and  nontitle  holders)  of  affected  people.  Those  affected  will  not  only  receive\nreplacement  land  or  cash  for  land  and  other  assets  at  replacement  cost,  but  many\nadditional  measures  will  be  taken  such  as  special  assistance  to  vulnerable  groups.  A\nsummary entitlement matrix for the Project ( Appendix 13) summarizes the main types of\nlosses and the support entitled for each type of loss.\n\nC. \n\nEthnic Minority and other Disadvantaged People Development Plan\nComponent\n\n1.\n\nEthnic Minorities in the Project Area\n\nAll 200 households directly affected by land acquisition for this road, as well as\n6.\nothers within the ZOI of the road is comprised of the Hmong ethnic group, who are the\nmajority population in this area.\n\n2.\n\nEthnic Minority Development Policy, Objectives, and Basic \nPrinciples\n\n7.\nThe ethnic minority development component will be prepared in accordance with\nADB\u2019s policy on indigenous people and Policy and Operations Manual & Guidelines on\nOperational  Procedures:  Section  53  Indigenous  Peoples  (January  2001).  Ethnic\nminorities in Viet Nam are recognized as vulnerable groups by the Government and are\ngiven  special  policy  considerations;  development  interventions  have  been  targeted\ntoward them. In 1994 the Committee for Ethnic Minorities and Mountainous Areas was\ncreated and assigned a role of monitoring and coordinating ethnic minority development\nactivities.  The  Government  has  a  number  of  programs  aimed  at  integrating  ethnic\nminority  groups  into  overall  Vietnamese  society  and  in  particular  increasing  their\nparticipation in mainstream economic life. Through this EMDP, the Project will assist the\nGovernment to address the inequities of both development and infrastructure provision\nin the remote and mountainous project area. The Project will support and coordinate with\nProgram 135  by developing and implementing the EMDP.\n\n8.\nThe  overall  objectives  of  the  EMDP  is  to  ensure  that  the  Project  provides\nopportunities  for  ethnic  minority  groups  to  reap  project  benefits  that  are  equal  to,  or\ngreater than, the dominant cultural group.\n\n9.\nThe main features of the EMDP process will be a preliminary screening process,\na  social  assessment    to  determine  the  degree  and  nature  of  impact  of  improving  the\nroad,  a  strategic  action  plan,  and  project  monitoring.  Consultations  with,  and\nparticipation of, the minority groups, their leaders, and local government officials in the\ndesign  and  implementation  of  the  EMDP  will  be  an  integral  part  of  the  EMDP\nCoordination with existing Government programs for ethnic minorities will be essential.\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 14, page 4\n\nThe  EMDP  will  consist  of  a  number  of  items  and  activities  including  mitigation\n10.\nmeasures  for  any  potentially  negative  impacts  identified  in  the  social  assessment,  any\nrequirements  for  modification  of  subproject  design,  and  outline  of  supporting  or\ndevelopment assistance. Where land clearance and acquisition is required that will affect\nethnic minority communities, the Project will ensure that their rights will not be violated\nand that they are appropriately and adequately compensated for the clearance, taking,\nor use of any part of their land, provided that the clearance, taking, or use is undertaken\nin  a  manner  that  is  culturally  acceptable  to  them.  The  compensation  will  follow  the\nprocess established in this resettlement framework.\n\n3. \n\nDevelopment Activities\u2013Rural Development Support\n\nIn  general,  development  benefits  to  be  provided  to  ethnic  minority  groups  shall\n\n11.\ninclude the following.\n\n12.\nCommunity  Infrastructure  Fund.    This  fund  will  be  given  to  communes  to\nimprove  (i)  physical  access  such  as  trails  and  footbridges  that  will  be  designed  and\nconstructed  through  village  consultation  and  participation  in  response  to  community\nneeds,  and  (ii)  community  infrastructure  and  services  such  as  installation  of  tube  wells\nand \nrepairing  of  existing  defunct  ones;  construction  of  community  markets,\nkindergartens, or other community facilities required in any specific location; construction\nof  village  fishponds;  and  renovation  of  existing  fishponds.  The  communes  will  be\nassisted by Project Management Unit-5 (PMU-5) and provincial departments of transport\n(PDOTs)  to  develop  proposals  to  People's  Committees  for  approval.  Qualified  local\ncontractors will be engaged by the PDOTs.  These contractors will be encouraged by the\nPDOTs  to  give  preferential  access  to  communes  to  road  construction  employment\nopportunities to the extent possible.\n\nParticipatory  Agricultural  Extension  Services. \n\n  Agricultural  extension\n13.\nassistance  will  be  provided  to  farmers  for  crop  intensification  and  diversification  and\nfarmer-to-farmer  training.    PMU-5  will  coordinate  with  CEMMA,  Ministry  of  Agriculture\nand  Rural  Development  (MARD),  and  mass  organizations  to  provide  participatory\nagricultural  extension  services  based  on  a  participatory  agricultural  extension  services\nprogram being implemented by SNV through MARD.\n\n14.\nSupport  Services  for  Credit  Utilization.    The  Project  will  facilitate  information\ndissemination  on  available  credit  and  training  on  how  to  utilize  credit  services.

Improvement of the provincial road network\nwill help bring the provincial facilities and related economic opportunities closer to the rural poor\npopulation. The total length of the provincial road network in the 18 provinces in the project area\nis  about  8,100  kilometers  (km)  serving  a  total  population  of  about  19  million.  Poverty\ncharacterizes  the  project  area  especially  in  the  rural  areas  with  poverty  incidence  generally\nincreasing  with  distance  from  the  economic  centers  of  Hanoi  and  Haiphong.  Given  the\nresources  and  population  density,  economic  and  social  development  has  significant  potential.\nThe  Project  thus  identifies the provincial road network and based on a sample of these roads\nidentifies and prioritizes about 2,800 km justified for improvement on both economic and social\ngrounds. These 2,800 km were further screened to yield about 1,600 km considered to have the\nhighest  development  and  economic  priority.  Nine  core  roads  have  been  fully  prepared  for\nimplementation following loan effectiveness.\n\nB.\n\nThe Project and Project Area\n\n1.\n\nThe Project\n\n2.\nThe part of the Project subject to this economic evaluation is the proposed improvement\nof the provincial roads. The funds provided under the loan will be adequate for improving about\n1,600  km,  although  the  total  length  to  be  improved  will  depend  on  the  actual  cost  of  the\nimprovements accumulated until all available funds are committed. Improvement will generally\ncomprise upgrading to a class V road characterized by a 6.5 meters (m) formation width and a\n3.5  m  pavement  width.  Pavements  will  be  sealed  to  an  all-weather  standard  on  the  existing\nalignment.  Variations  to  these  dimensions  and  class  of  improvement  will  be  allowed  where\njustified on economic, technical, or social grounds.\n\n2.\n\nThe Project Area\n\nThe  Project  covers  a  geographic  area  of  some  116,313  km2  and  includes  18  northern\n3.\nand  contiguous  provinces,  of  which  6  provinces  share  a  border  with  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of\nChina  and  3  share  a  border  with  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic.  Eight  provinces  in  the\nnorthern part of the country are excluded as their economies and road networks are relatively\nmore  developed/industrialized.  These  are  Bac  Ninh,  Hai  Duong,  Haiphong,  Hanoi,  Hung  Yen,\nNam  Dinh,  Ninh  Binh,  and  Thai  Binh.  The  18  provinces  included  in  the  project  area  can  be\nfurther  subdivided  into  193  districts  and  3,520  communes.  The  core  roads  pass  through  53\ncommunes including 14 specially disadvantaged communes. The population of the project area\nis  some  18.8  million,  nearly  one  quarter  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  population.  The  provinces  are\npredominantly rural, and while population densities vary considerably across the 18 provinces,\nthe  average  population  density  is  low  at  162  people  per  km2.  indicating  the  limited  amount  of\nusable  space  in  mountainous  areas  that  tend  to  predominate  the  Project  area.  The  project\nprovinces  are  very  poor  with  a  largely  agricultural  economic  base.  In  1998,  gross  domestic\nproduct (GDP) per capita ranged from D4.2 million in Quang Ninh to D1.2 million in Lai Chau. If\nQuang Ninh, which includes the relatively well-off Ha Long area from the range along with Lai\nChau Province, per capita income varies from D2.5 million to 1.5 million. Countrywide the GDP\nper capita in 1998 was D3.25 million, some 60 percent greater than the typical project province.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 15, page 2\n\nC.\n\nProject Roads\n\n4.\nThe  8,100  km  provincial  roads  in  the  project  area  represent  the  connecting  links\nbetween  the  commune  and  district  roads  and  the  national  highway  network.  As  such  their\nimprovement  is  essential  for  the  rural  population,  which  mostly  have  direct  access  to  the\ncommune and district roads to fully benefit from access to a much broader spectrum of social\nand economic opportunities than they presently have. The project roads have been chosen for\ntheir  priority  in  general  and  in  terms  of  their  provincial  priority.  Almost  all  project  roads  are  in\nvery  poor  condition,  stone  or  earth  surfaced,  with  travel  speeds  of  5  to  15  km  per  hour  for\nmotorized traffic when passable.\n\n1.\n\nRoad Selection\n\n5.\nInitially  an  inventory  of  all  provincial  roads  was  gathered  and  totaled  about  8,100  km.\nFrom this the provincial authorities supplied a list of their highest priority roads excluding those\nthat had recently been or would soon be improved, were still in reasonable condition, and had\nvery low priority. From this, a list of about 2,800 km was identified. Funding available under the\nProject indicated that a maximum of about 1,600 km of the highest priority roads in about 154\nlinks could be improved. This is a very large number for complete preparation under a feasibility\nstudy. To overcome this a set of core Roads representative of the roads in the project area were\nselected for detailed evaluation and preparation of a method of evaluation that could be applied\nto all other candidate roads. The main characteristics of the nine core roads representing about\n10 percent of the project roads are shown in Table A15.1.\n\nTable A15.1: Core Roads\n\nRoad\nNumber\n0103\n\nRoad\nCode\nTL 107\n\nLocation\n\nProvince\n\nThuan Chau\n\nSon La\n\nLength\n(km)\n29.0\n\nImprove-\nment\nClass\nV\n\n0202\n\n0307\n\n0601\n\n0701\n\n1101\n\n1401\n\n1508\n\n1718\n\nTL 132\n\nPhong Tho\n\nLai Chau\n\nLC-\nSP:07\nTL 253\n\nTL 312\n\nTL 185\n\nTL 434\n\nTL 90\n\nTL TY\n\nSa Pa \u2013 Ban\nDen\nDoc Lim \u2013 Ho\nNuc Coc\nChan Mong \u2013\nThanh Ba\nTQ \u2013 Kim Binh\n\nHoa Binh \u2013\nYen Mong\nQuang Oai \u2013\nDong Lau\nTho Xuab \u2013\nYen Dinh\n\nLao Cai\n\nThai\nNguyen\nPhu To\n\nTuyen\nQuang\nHoa Binh\n\nHa Tay\n\nThanh\nHoa\n\nNine core roads\n\n27.0\n\n14.0\n\n6.8\n\n10.0\n\n58.0\n\n11.0\n\n6.0\n\n11.4\n\n178.2\n\nTerrain\n\nMountai\nnous\nMountai\nnous\nMountai\nnous\nFlat\n\nFlat\n\nHilly\n\nHilly\n\nFlat\n\nFlat\n\nTraffic\nCMV\n68\n\n32\n\n232\n\n324\n\n22\n\n47\n\n225\n\n60\n\n248\n\nIV\n\nV\n\nV\n\nV\n\nV\n\nV\n\nV\n\nV\n\nCMV = conventional motor vehicles excluding motorcycles and small motor powered farm tractors.\nNote:   Socioeconomic rank is based on poverty, access to social facilities, markets, rice production, and\n\n               population\n               density.\n\nSource:  Provincial Department of Transport.\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 15, page 3\n\n2.\n\nRoad Condition and Traffic\n\n6.\nRoad condition is expressed using a road condition index  that is based on roughness as\nmeasured by the international roughness index (IRI). IRI varies but most roads have an IRI of 9\nm per km to 12 m per km.\n\n7.\nFor the core roads, traffic is based on actual counts carried out by the consultant and the\nProvincial  Department  of  Transport  (PDOTs).  Traffic  categories  included  cars,  pickup  trucks,\nsmall  buses  (about  15  to  20  passengers),  buses,  small  trucks,  trucks,  motorcycles,  and  cong\nnongs.  Motorcycles  are  very  common  in  Viet  Nam  and  are  becoming  more  common  in  rural\nareas  as  the  roads  are  improved  and  with  the  recent  introduction  of  affordable  motorcycles\nmanufactured  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  Cong  nongs  are  small  tractors\nconverted  for  road  use  by  attaching  a  trailer.  They  are  used  for  transporting  both  passengers\nand cargo. Bicycles, bullock carts, and pedestrians were also counted. Motorized traffic on the\ncore roads ranged from 23 to 324 vehicles per day (vpd), while motorcycles ranged from 64 to\n1,485 per day. Nonmotorized traffic ranged from 56 to 5,847.\n\n3.\n\nTraffic Forecasts\n\n8.\nInformation concerning traffic on the road network including the provincial road network\nis sparse and no adequate basis is provided by historical data on which to forecast traffic flows,\neven in the short term. As done in all major transport projects prepared over the last five years\nin  Viet  Nam,  real  per  capita  GDP  growth  rates  are  used  as  the  basis  for  forecasting  traffic\ngrowth, factored as appropriate by assumptions on transport demand elasticity ratios and other\nfactors.\n\n9.\nMost  recently  derived  elasticity  values  for  application  nationwide  were  1.2  for  cars,\nbuses, small buses, and 4x4 passenger vehicles; 2.0 for motorcycles; and an elasticity of 1.0 for\nall  other  movements.  These  estimates  appeared  to  be  a  reasonable  basis  but  the  need  to  be\nadjusted to reflect regional economic differences. The motorcycle population in the project area,\nparticularly in the more affluent Delta region, is growing rapidly. Therefore an elasticity factor of\n2.5 is used during the early years of the forecast period up to 2005. For the Delta region, which\nis  experiencing  and  is  expected  to  continue  to  experience  rapid  growth,  a  2-percentage  point\ndifference until 2010 is added. With a forecast annual GDP growth rate of at least 5 percent per\nyear expected, the forecast growth rates for traffic used in the economic analysis are as shown\nin Table A15.2.\n\nTable A15.2: Annual Traffic Growth Rates\n\nArea\n\nMotorcycle\n\nPassenger\n(motorized)\n\nCargo\n(motorized)\n\nOther\n\nProject Area\n(excl.

The\nstandard  conversion  factor  of  0.93  was  calculated  by  means  of  domestic  to  border  price\nconversion. The shadow wage rates for rural and skilled labor were calculated at 0.57 and 0.97\nrespectively.  Specific  costs  were  built  up  from  basic  data  and  adjusted  for  economic  costs.\nConstruction costs include costs for supervision, physical contingency, and resettlement.\n\n1.\n\nUser Costs\n\n11.\nVehicle operating cost (VOC) savings are the main benefits quantified in the economic\nevaluation. VOCs were calculated without and with the road improvements, and were estimated\nfor seven typical vehicle types using the HDM-4 model. This takes into account project\u2013induced\nchanges  in  surface  conditions,  gradient  and  vehicle  speeds,  as  well  as  a  number  of  other\nfactors such as the VOC components (vehicle, fuel, oil, tires, maintenance, interest, overhead,\ncrew and passenger time, and insurance costs). As roughness is the main factor affecting VOCs\non the provincial roads, the VOCs for the motor vehicles according to road roughness is shown\nin Table A15.3. For example by reducing the roughness from 12 IRI to 4 IRI, as would be the\ncase  for  many  of  the  Project  roads,  VOCs  decline  by  more  than  40  percent  to  more  than  50\npercent. If initial roughness is higher, then the savings are also commensurately greater. VOC\nsavings for the representative vehicles for the existing road and the improved core roads are set\nout in Table A15.4. On a particular road stretch, roughness is considered the main influence on\nVOC. The project roads are in very poor condition with an IRI ranging from about 6 m per km to\n20  m  per  km  and  above.  After  improvement,  the  IRI  will  reduce  to  about  4  m  per  km.  As  the\nimprovements  are  to  be  low  cost  and  simple,  the  existing  alignment  will  not  change  either\nvertically  or  horizontally.  Speeds  after  improvement  will  depend  on  the  alignment.  Before\nimprovement,  speeds  are  typically  5  to  15  km  per  hour  mainly  because  of  surface  condition.\nAfter  improvement,  they  are  expected  to  increase  substantially  to  20  to  60  km  per  hour\ndepending largely on terrain.\n\nTable A15.3: VOCs for Typical Motor Vehicles\nAccording to Road Roughness\n(VOCs in $ per km)\n\nMotor\ncycle Car\n\nSmall\nBus\n\nBus\n\nSmall\nTruck\n\nMedium\nTruck\n\nLarge\nTruck\n\nCong\nNong\n\n0.0385 0.1200 0.1604 0.2252 0.1575 0.1375 0.1588 0.0447\n0.0432 0.1600 0.2030 0.2900 0.1890 0.1690 0.1890 0.0515\n0.0552 0.2200 0.2669 0.3872 0.2363 0.2163 0.2344 0.0625\n0.0756 0.2800 0.3309 0.4843 0.2835 0.2636 0.2797 0.0746\n0.0877 0.3400 0.3948 0.5815 0.3308 0.3110 0.3251 0.0887\n0.1118 0.4000 0.4588 0.6786 0.3780 0.3583 0.3704 0.1054\n\nIRI\n\n4.00\n6.00\n9.00\n12.00\n15.00\n18.00\n\nIRI = international roughness index.\nSource: Consultants.\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 15, page 5\n\nTable A15.4: Core Road VOC Savings and Traffic Volumes for Typical Vehicles\n($000 and vpd in 2003)\n\nRoad\n\nNumber Km\n\n    Car\nSav/Vol.\n\nPickup\nSav/Vol.\n\nSmall\nBus\nSav/Vol.\n\nBus\nSav/Vol.\n\nSmall\nTruck\nSav/Vol.\n\nTruck\nSav/Vol.\n\nMotor-\nCycle\nSav/Vol.\n\nCong\nNong\nSav/Vol.\n\nTotal\nSav/Vol.\n\n0103\n0202\n0307\n0601\n0701\n1101\n1401\n1508\n1718\n\n29.0\n27.0\n14.0\n6.8\n8.5\n58.0\n11.0\n6.0\n11.4\n\n  6\n  8\n  1\n  9\n  3\n  2\n  5\n  3\n18\n\n  2\n  5\n  1\n21\n  5\n  1\n14\n12\n28\n\n  8\n10\n  1\n12\n  0\n  2\n  8\n  4\n25\n\n  3\n  8\n  1\n38\n  1\n  1\n25\n22\n50\n\n46\n15\n73\n  7\n  6\n  2\n  1\n  0\n68\n\n12\n  9\n84\n16\n 10\n    1\n    2\n    1\n100\n\n10\n   3\n30\n45\n  2\n  7\n  5\n  1\n66\n\n  2\n  1\n23\n66\n  2\n  2\n  8\n  2\n64\n\n41\n 3\n63\n47\n  6\n52\n42\n  3\n  2\n\n 29\n   2\n100\n146\n  14\n  33\n141\n 19\n   5\n\n  9\n  1\n15\n11\n14\n14\n10\n  1\n  0\n\n  7\n  1\n25\n37\n35\n  9\n35\n  5\n  1\n\n 561\n   31\n   67\n157\n    8\n137\n  49\n  53\n117\n\n1,049\n     76\n   328\n1,485\n    64\n  271\n 540\n 927\n 742\n\n  7\n  2\n10\n  7\n  1\n  5\n  4\n  1\n  8\n\n17\n  7\n70\n97\n  7\n14\n68\n18\n75\n\n688\n104\n260\n296\n  39\n220\n124\n  66\n304\n\n1,121\n    109\n    632\n1,906\n    138\n    332\n    833\n1,006\n1,065\n\nSav/Vol = savings per volume, VOC = vehicle operating cost\n\nRoad  closure  or  impassability  is  normally  not  a  necessary  consideration  in  evaluating\n12.\nimprovements to major highways as this would usually be measured in terms of a few hours a\nday and not days or months, and the resulting benefits would be small and normally not affect\nthe investment decision.1 In their current condition, many of the project roads become saturated\nduring the rainy season when what remains of the road surface is so badly rutted and slippery\nthat two-wheel-drive motor vehicles cannot negotiate them. To put a value on such disturbances\nis difficult but can be approximated. This was done by transferring travelers and cargo to more\nexpensive 4-or-more-wheel-drive vehicles for essential social or economic purposes. A factor to\nbe applied to VOCs of non-4-wheel drive vehicles was developed to represent costs of using 4-\nwheel drive over the closure period. This factor ranged from 1.02 for 5 days closure to 1.78 for\n90 days closure, and represent a range of closure from 10 percent to 70 percent of the road link\nlength, respectively. This reflects that it is very unusual for the entire length of road to become\nimpassable.\n\n2.\n\nConstruction and Other Costs\n\n13.\nConstruction  and  maintenance  costs  were  also  estimated  for  the  project  roads.  Two\nclasses  of  road  improvement  were  considered.  Class  V  will  be  the  most  widely  specified  and\ninvolves a formation width of 6.5 m and a carriageway width of 3.5 m with 1.5 m wide shoulders\non each side. The riding surface may be either gravel or double bituminous surface treatment\n(DBST) with gravel or hard shoulders where large numbers of two-wheeled or nonmotorized are\nidentified.  For  more  heavily  trafficked  roads,  class  IV  may  be  considered.  Class  IV  features  a\n9.0 m formation width with a 6 m carriageway and 1.5 m shoulders on each side. Class IV may\nalso be sealed or unsealed. Improvement and maintenance costs were estimated for both.\n\n14.\nCosts  for  the  core  roads  are  based  on  detailed  design  and  quantities  of  materials  and\nother works needed. Numerous road projects have been externally funded in Viet Nam in recent\nyears provide an abundant construction cost data sources to draw on. Unit costs were derived\nfrom  these  data  and  applied  to  the  units  in  the  design  bills  of  quantities.  The  estimated\nconstruction costs were then appropriately adjusted to reflect economic costs. Typical financial\nand economic costs for improving the existing road to a sealed class V road are shown in Table\nA15.5. Most of the project roads are categorized as being between condition 3 and 4.\n\n1 A closure analysis can help justify incremental improvements to avoid future closures.\n\n                  \n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 15, page 6\n\nTable A15.5: Estimated Financial/Economic Costs for Upgrading\nExisting Roads to Class V Sealed Roads\n($\u2019 000)\n\nTerrain Type\nMountainous\nRolling & Hilly\nFlat and Level\na Condition 1 = newly paved roads, 2 = good condition with IRI of 6.00, 3 = fair with IRI of 9.00, 4 = poor with IRI of\n\nCondition 3\n28,376/25,500\n27,688/24,900\n27,668/24,900\n\nCondition 4\n45,531/41,000\n40,535/36,500\n38,139/34,300\n\nCondition 5\n80,687/72,600\n71,496/64,300\n64,143/57,700\n\nCondition 2a\n15,098/13,600\n14,953/13,500\n14,862/13,400\n\n12.00, 5 = bad with IRI of 15.00.\n\nNote: IRI is the international roughness index for roads.\n\n15.\nA  thorough  analysis  of  the  cost  of  maintaining  improved  gravel  surfaced  and  DBST\nsurfaced  roads  was  undertaken.  Gravel  surfaced  roads  require  rather  equipment  intensive\nmaintenance.  This  is  because  the  passage  of  motor  vehicles  and  the  ravages  of  very  strong\nseasonal rainfall common to the project area immediately affect and help deteriorate the gravel\nsurface.  Gravel  road  maintenance  tends  to  be  equipment  intensive.  For  example,  proper\nperiodic grading needed one to two times a year requires a grader, a water truck, a dump truck,\nand  a  vibratory  roller,  as  well  as  operators  and  labor.  Regraveling  requires  similar  equipment.\nDBST roads except for the resealing that may be needed every 7 to 15 years generally require\nminimal equipment and easily transportable materials for typical maintenance. The comparative\ncosts for the two types of surfaces are shown in Table A15.6 categorized by equivalent 4-wheel\nvehicles.  This  analysis  clearly  shows  that  maintenance  of  gravel  roads  done  properly  is\nconsiderably  more  expensive  than  for  sealed  roads  with  equivalent  traffic  loadings.  While\nconstruction  of  a  gravel  surfaced  road  is  roughly  half  the  cost  of  a  surfaced  road,  the  lower\nmaintenance cost of the sealed road pays for itself in a very short time, say in about 5 to 7 years\nover a life of 20 years. Gravel roads would generally have greater roughness than a sealed road\nand  thus  higher  VOCs.  Roughness  would  also  increase  between  maintenance  operations.\nTherefore,  and  considering  that  the  provinces  have  equipment  and  operating  budget  deficits\nand likely to remain that way for some time, DBST roads are preferred to gravel roads.\n\nTable A15.6: Comparative Financial/Economic Maintenance Costs\nfor Class V Improved Gravel vs DBST\n($\u2019 000 per year per km)\n\nType\n\nGravel: Low Traffic Volumes, up to 45 FWV\nGravel: Medium Traffic Volumes up to 135 FWV\nGravel: Heavy Traffic Volumes up to 225 FWV\nDBST: Low Traffic Volumes up to 45 FWV\nDBST: Medium Traffic Volumes up to 135 FWV\nDBST: High Traffic Volumes up to 225 FWV\n\nCost\n\n2,100/1,900\n2,500/2,250\n3,000/2,700\n700/630\n800/720\n900/810\n\nDBST = double bituminous surface treatment; FWV = four-wheel vehicle; km = kilometer;  vs = versus.\n\nE.\n\nBenefits and Beneficiaries\n\n16.\nThe  main  quantifiable  benefits  for  the  project  roads  are  based  on  VOC  savings.\nOperating  costs  are  estimated  to  decline  from  about  40  percent  to  more  than  60  percent\ndepending  on  the  initial  roughness  and  condition  of  the  road.  Travel  time  should  typically  be\nreduced by 50 or more. Impassability should be reduced from a few days to two to three months\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 15, page 7\n\na year to a negligible amount of time. This strongly suggests that nonquantified benefits will be\nsubstantial, for example, quicker, less costly and more reliable market access for farmers and\ntradespeople, increased access for social communications, decreased time for the movement of\ntrade goods and higher reliability, and in general, better transport services for the entire project\narea population including people served by recently improved district and commune roads but\nconnecting  with  provincial  roads  in  very  poor  condition.  Directly  affected  will  be  the  4  million\npeople living within the zones of influence of the project roads, as well as people living outside\nthe zone of influence who will now be able to interact economically and socially with the project\narea  population.  The  reduced  VOC  and  travel  time  resulting  from  improvement  of  the  project\nroads will benefit road users, including the local population as well as commercial operators that\nwill  now  be  able  to  provide  transport  services  at  a  reasonable  cost  and  frequency.  Since\ntransport  charges  mainly  depend  on  road  conditions,  a  portion  of  the  VOC  savings  are  to  be\npassed on to the road users. Through greater transport efficiencies, the road improvements will\nhelp  enable  small-scale  producers  to  participate  more  actively  in  the  market  economy\n(Supplementary Appendix D more information on the likely effects and beneficiaries).\n\nF.\n\nEconomic Evaluation\n\n17.\nThe  economic  evaluation  has  followed  the  standard  approach  of  estimating  the  costs\nand  benefits  and  then  determining  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  following  a\nprocess of iterative discounting until the benefit-cost ratio is equal to one. VOCs were calculated\nbased  on  HDM-4  and  particularly  the  HDM-VOC  subroutine,  while  other  costs  such  as\nresettlement,  repair/replacement  of  existing  bridges,  construction  of  new  bridges,  supervision\ncosts,  and  physical  contingencies  have  been  introduced  exogenously.  Nonmotorized  traffic\nbenefits were included in the analysis and contribute up to 10 percent to the benefit stream. A\nsummary of the economic analysis for the core roads is given in Table A15.7.\n\nTable A15.7: Summary of Economic Evaluation for the Core Roads\n(in percent)\n\nRoad\nNumber\n\nBase\nCase\nEIRR\n\n20%\nCapital\nCost\nIncrease\n(Case 1)\n\n20%\nVOC\nSavings\nReduction\n(Case 2)\n\nCombination\nCase1 +\nCase 2\n\nSwitching\nValue\nAt 12%\nBenefits Costs\n\n0103\n0202\n0307\n0601\n0701\n1101\n1401\n1508\n1718\n\n59.0\n11.7\n60.7\n148.7\n13.7\n19.1\n42.6\n40.9\n109.5\n\n50.2\n9.3\n51.2\n124.7\n10.9\n15.8\n35.9\n34.8\n92.0\n\n48.4\n8.8\n49.3\n119.8\n10.3\n15.1\n34.6\n33.6\n88.5\n\n41.2\n6.7\n41.6\n100.5\n7.7\n12.1\n29.0\n28.5\n74.5\n\n-81\n-9\n-78\n-89\n-11\n-34\n-68\n-72\n-88\n\n440\n26\n350\n850\n23\n51\n212\n252\n729\n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return.

The  feasibility  study  prepared  under  TA  3455-VIE:\nProvincial  Roads  Improvement  Project  provides  most  of  the  data  required  for  selection  and\nprioritization  of  the  project  roads.  It  does  not  and  could  not  provide  the  full  documentation\nrequired for approval of individual subprojects because of time and funds constraints. Additional\nwork,  including  economic  evaluation,  will  be  required  under  the  proposed  loan  and  include,  in\naddition to the material prepared under the TA, a formal request to ADB for approval of future\nsubprojects.  The  request  for  subproject  approval  will  include:  (i)  cover  sheet,  (ii)  basic  data\nsheet  including  EIRR,  (iii)  map,  (iv)  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  or  summary\nenvironmental impact assessment (SEIA) in ADB format, (v) approval from Ministry of Science,\nTechnology  and  Environment  (MOSTE)  either  registration  letter  or  other  approval,  and  (vi)\nresettlement  plan  and  ethnic  minority  development  plan,  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB.
