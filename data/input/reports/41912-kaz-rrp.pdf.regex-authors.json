I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsenior, unsecured loan of up to $50 million (denominated in US dollars or tenge [T] equivalent), \nto  JSC  Bank  CenterCredit  (BCC),  for  the  purpose  of  lending  to  small-  and  medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) in Kazakhstan. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Kazakhstan Economy 1 \n \n2.  The Kazakh economy has demonstrated consistent strong performance since 2000, with \nhigh  oil  prices,  foreign  investment,  and  good  macroeconomic  management  underlying  the \ncontinuing economic boom in this oil-rich export economy. Gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth, led by the oil sector, averaged over 9% between 2000 and 2004, and reached 9.7% in \n2005 and 10.6% in 2006. Inflation has remained moderate at 6.9% in 2004, 7.6% in 2005, and \n8.6% in 2006. The tenge has gradually strengthened against the US dollar in recent years \n(appreciating 5% over 2006 as a whole). Future currency development will be influenced greatly \nby oil prices.   \n \n3.  The  private  sector,  representing  65%  of  GDP,  is increasingly  driving  growth  in the \neconomy. Like most oil producers, Kazakhstan is currently in a comfortable fiscal position, with \nrevenues easily meeting targets and with ample funds for short- and long-term social and \ninfrastructure projects. Total external debt was approximately $44 billion at the end of 2005, and \nwas estimated at $73.5 billion at the end of 2006.2  \n \n4.  The medium-term economic outlook is positive assuming buoyant oil prices, foreign \ndirect  investment  inflows,  continuation  of  economic  diversification,  good  macroeconomic \nmanagement, and political stability. Overall, the economy is heavily dependent on oil price \ndevelopment. \n \n5.  The economy is expected to continue its strong performance in 2007/08, with GDP \ngrowth anticipated at 9.0% in 2007 and inflation anticipated to decline to 8.1%. Kazakhstan is \nrated Baa2/Baa1 by Moody\u2019s, BBB/BBB+ by Standard and Poor\u2019s, and BBB/BBB+ by Fitch for \nforeign currency long-term debt and local currency long-term debt, respectively.  \n \nB.  Financial Sector and Banking \n \n6.  In  keeping  with  the  overall  economic  boom,  the  Kazakh  financial  sector  has  been \ngrowing very rapidly in recent years; the fastest growing sector after oil. Lending volumes have \nincreased by an average of 40% per year in the last 5 years, and banking assets accounted for \n                                                 \n1 The information presented in this RRP presents a relatively brief overview of the challenges and opportunities in the \nKazakh economy and banking market. These same issues and context were addressed in great detail in ADB. \n2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Assistance to Private \nBanks in Kazakhstan. Manila, which was submitted for loans to JSC Alliance Bank and Bank TuranAlem JSC. The \ntreatment of these issues in that RRP remains highly applicable today, and readers wishing background to this \nRRP are encouraged to refer to pages 1\u20134 of the main text (sections entitled Kazakhstan Economy: Overview and \nOutlook, Small and Medium Enterprises\u2019 Contribution to the Economy, and Banking Sector in Kazakhstan), as well \nas appendixes 1 and 2 (Kazakhstan: Major Macroeconomic Considerations and Overview of Kazakh Banking \nSector).   \n2  Economist Intelligence Unit estimate. ", "2       \n90%  of  annual  GDP  by  year-end  2006,  driven  mostly  by  increasing  retail  lending.3  The \nGovernment and the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) have undertaken structural reforms for \nbanking,  aimed  at  promoting  consolidation  and  improving  overall  viability.  These  include \nintroducing  international  prudential  standards  such  as  capital  adequacy  requirements  and \nliquidity ratios, transparency requirements for the auditing of banks by local and international \nauditors,  harmonization  of  local  accounting  practices  to  international  financial  reporting \nstandards, guidelines for bank inspections, and internal risk management systems for banks. In \nApril 2007, external borrowing regulations were approved, imposing a specified ratio of external \nliabilities on bank capital.  \n \n7.  As of 31 December 2006, the banking subsector comprised 33 banks (excluding NBK \nand  Development  Bank  of  Kazakhstan):  (i)  large  local  banks,  such  as  Bank  TuranAlem, \nKazkommertsbank,  and  ATF  Bank  (which  collectively  represented  58%  of  banking  system \nassets and 58.3% of banking system loans, as of 1 January 2007); (ii) banks under foreign \nownership, such as ABN AMRO Bank Kazakhstan, HSBC Bank Kazakhstan, and Citibank \nKazakhstan; (iii) second-tier medium-sized banks with regional business; and (iv) smaller local \nbanks. (Appendix 2 provides an overview of the Kazakh banking system.)  \n \n8.  Local  capital  and  interbank  markets  are  less  significant  as  funding  sources.  The \ncombined share of these reached a small 9% of total banking liabilities at the end of 2005. The \ninterbank market\u2019s average daily trading volumes do not exceed $70 million (approximately 5% \nof outstanding interbank deposits) and the market remains shallow in maturities exceeding 1 \nmonth. In contrast to the explosive growth rate of Eurobond issuance, local capital markets are \nonly  gradually  developing,  driven  by  modest  demand  from  pension  funds  and  asset \nmanagement firms. Strict portfolio limits imposed on pension managers limit the ability of banks \nto sell their tenge-denominated instruments. \n \nC.  Economic Challenges \n \n9.  Despite  the  overall  positive  outlook,  the  economy  is  not  immune  to  threats,  and \nKazakhstan\u2019s high dependence on oil exports exposes the economy to potential vulnerability. In \nmost economies worldwide, and in most countries in the developing world, SMEs make an \nextraordinary contribution to economic growth. This is, however, not the case in Kazakhstan.4 \nThe Government recognizes that (i) high dependence on oil exports poses a threat to the \neconomy, and (ii) the labor-intensive nature of SMEs will aid in job creation and thus poverty \nreduction (Appendix 2 provides data on SMEs currently in operation). The Government is \ntherefore striving to diversify the economy, particularly by promoting conditions for the growth of \nthe SME sector. In line with this strategy, the Government has introduced certain SME-friendly \nlaws, offered various concessions and subsidies, and created several organizations, such as \nbusiness development centers to provide services and small business loans.5   \n                                                 \n3  Between 2004 and 2006, consumer credit accelerated steeply, as did mortgage lending, and as of 31 December \n2006, total outstanding bank loans had grown to more than $47 billion, while total banking system assets stood at \napproximately $69 billion. \n4  In the People\u2019s Republic of China in 2005, for example, SMEs represented 58% of GDP, 59% of sales revenue, \n68% of exports, 75% of employment, and 99.6% of enterprises. Statistics in other countries are not dissimilar. In \nKazakhstan, however, the economy is heavily dominated by and dependent upon exports of scale-dependent oil, \ngas, and other natural resources. SMEs, dominant only in the trade and services sectors, are  in general \nunderrepresented,  contributing  only  14%\u201315%  of  GDP  and  40%  of  employment.  Statistics  available  at: \nhttp://en.casme.net/docs/Digest_of_Kazakhstan_SME_Statistics_eng%20edit_05.pdf. \n5  In 1997, the Government also set up the SME Support Fund, a nonbank financial institution, with the following main \ntasks: (i) broaden access to finance for SMEs, (ii) make effective use of state and nonstate resources aimed at \nSME support, (iii) develop SME infrastructure, and (iv) provide consultations for SMEs. \n ", "      3\n10.  SMEs rely heavily on access to external capital to finance their operations. However, in \nmost of ADB\u2019s developing member countries, SMEs have difficulty accessing financial services \nand  securing  financing.  Although  bank  loans  dominate  any  external  financing  (due  to  the \nunderdeveloped corporate bond markets), only a small number of SMEs in the region have \naccess to bank lending (mostly only for working capital). Lack of access to bank lending is \nconsidered  in  most  developing  member  countries  as  the  main  financing  difficulty  and  a \nstumbling block for sustaining SME growth. Kazakhstan has made progress in this regard and \nlending activity has gradually shifted away from large corporations and become more inclusive \nfor SMEs.   \n \n11.  Because of the export-driven economy and low interest rates, banks have relied heavily \non dollar-denominated funding; this has been particularly pronounced since exporters are the \nmain client base (large corporations and larger SMEs) of Kazakh banks. The economy, however, \nis changing; it is now increasingly driven less by the natural resource industries and more by \nSMEs producing and selling in the domestic market, meaning that banks need to move more \ninto tenge-denominated assets and liabilities to meet the demands of their SME customers. \n \n12.  In addition, new external borrowing regulations are putting pressure on Kazakh banks to \nincreasingly utilize domestic and tenge funding sources. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT \nA.  Bank CenterCredit  \n \n1.      Overview and History \n13.  BCC,  a  joint  stock  company  (JSC)  registered  under  the  laws  of  Kazakhstan,  was \nfounded in 1988 as part of the first wave of cooperative banks to come out of the former Soviet \nsystem. In 1998, BCC merged with the larger and troubled state housing development bank, \nCJSC Zhilstroibank. BCC quickly overcame the initial problems of this merger (poor loan quality, \nexcessive fixed assets and staff) and was reregistered as JSC Bank CenterCredit in 2004. \n \n14.  BCC is the sixth largest commercial bank in Kazakhstan in terms of assets, which as of \n31 December 2006 equaled $4.502 billion, and fourth largest in terms of customer deposit \naccounts, which as of 31 December 2006 equaled $1.748 billion, deposited in more than \n354,000 customer accounts.  \n \n15.  BCC  has  four  subsidiaries:  LLP  CenterLeasing,  JSC  BCC  Invest,  Center  Credit \nInternational B.V., and JSC Capital Pension Fund. BCC has also made investments in JSC First \nCredit Bureau and Association of Financiers of Kazakhstan, JSC Atameken Pension Fund, JSC \nKorgau Pension Fund, and JSC Oil Insurance Company. These subsidiaries and investments \nare strategically important to BCC, given BCC\u2019s intention to cross-sell its financial products. \n \n16.  Currently,  BCC  is  rated  by  two  rating  agencies:  Fitch  Ratings  (Fitch)  and  Moody\u2019s \nInvestors Service (Moody\u2019s) (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Bank CenterCredit Credit Ratings \nRating Agency  Long Term  Outlook \nFitch  BB\u2013  Stable \nMoody\u2019s  Ba1  Stable \nSource: Bank CenterCredit. \n ", "4       \n2.  BCC\u2019s Business \n17.  BCC offers a full range of traditional commercial banking products and services (i.e., \ndeposits, lending and guarantees, leasing, factoring, settlement, cards, and foreign exchange). \nBCC is a principal member of VISA, and is the primary agent in Kazakhstan for Western Union. \nBCC\u2019s branch network (the third largest network in Kazakhstan) as of May 2007 comprised, in \naddition to the head office in Almaty, 20 full-service branches and 122 limited service branches \nor retail settlement units throughout Kazakhstan, supported by 134 ATMs (automated teller \nmachines). This nationwide coverage gives BCC a strategic advantage over other medium-\nsized banks in Kazakhstan, whose networks are often more concentrated in the Almaty and \nAstana  regions.  BCC\u2019s  primary  business  consists  of  corporate  (including  SME)  and  retail \nbanking. BCC provides corporate banking products and services, focusing primarily on small, \nmedium, and, to a limited extent, large businesses in Kazakhstan. It has strong market shares \nwith both large and SME clients, and the SME sector is a key focus of activities.  The retail \nbanking market is also an important source of business and funding for BCC. BCC offers a wide \nrange of retail banking products and services, including term deposits, current accounts, debit \nand credit cards, and currency exchange.  Retail deposits make up another important growth \narea for BCC, and BCC has one of the largest retail deposit bases in Kazakhstan.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n18.  ADB  is  contemplating  providing  a  senior,  unsecured  loan  of  up  to  $50,000,000 \n(denominated in dollars or tenge equivalent) to BCC. The indicative main terms and conditions \nare (i) up to 5-year maturity, (ii) bullet repayment structure or amortizing with the grace period to \nbe  determined  (in  accordance  with  the  ADB  tenge  bond  structure),  and  (iii)  pricing  to  be \ndetermined by the Credit Enhancement and Pricing Committee. ADB will raise the necessary \ntenge by issuing a tenge domestic bond. \n \n \nV.  INVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Justification  \n \n1.  Investment Outcome \n19.  Expand SME Tenge-Financing. ADB\u2019s first objective in the proposed transaction is to \nfoster BCC\u2019s tenge-denominated SME financing by providing part of the needed debt funding. \nADB is thus helping the Government to (i) move the economy to more influence of corporate \nand SME growth for the overall economy and away from the high dependence on natural \nresource industries; and (ii) help move banking into more tenge-denominated lending. \n \n20.  Develop Local Bond Markets. ADB\u2019s second objective is to issue its first domestic \nbond in Kazakhstan and therefore to establish a benchmark for AAA risk in the country and \nfoster the development of the local bond market. \n \n21.  In addition, the proposed loan facility is in line with the Government\u2019s attempt to reduce \nexternal  borrowing.  According  to  NBK  and  the  Agency  of  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan  on \nRegulation and Supervision of Financial Markets and Financial Organizations, ADB\u2019s loan will \nnot be considered as external borrowing. Thus, ADB\u2019s loan will not affect external borrowing.   \n \n ", "      5\n2.  Development Impact \n22.  Expansion of SME Loan Portfolios and Contribution to Economic Diversification. \nThe diversification of the economy into nonoil investments is a crucial factor for Kazakhstan\u2019s \nsustainable and inclusive economic development. To create a sustainable economic base, \nKazakhstan  must  achieve  economic  diversification,  both  through  strengthening  the  nonoil \nsectors of the real economy and through appropriate diversification of its growing financial \nassets. ADB\u2019s proposed loans will directly contribute to expanding financial intermediation to \nSMEs, and will foster the diversification of loan portfolios.  \n \n23.  Deepening of Local Capital Markets. Moreover, ADB will issue a local currency bond \nto fund the contemplated loan. Such a bond would be a strong signal of ADB\u2019s confidence in the \neconomic development of Kazakhstan, which would catalyze investment. Multiple benefits are \nassociated  with  such  bond  issuances,  in  particular  the  diversification  benefits  for  local \ninstitutional investors that are keen to invest in local currency high-grade bonds. In particular, \nthe local pension fund industry (their assets under management are growing at around $100 \nmillion per month) is keen to invest in longer tenor local currency securities. Given the limited \nbond issue activity of the Government because of its fiscal surplus, few local currency long-term \nbonds are available in the market, forcing local institutional investors to invest offshore, and thus \nincur currency risks due to asset-liability mismatches. ADB bonds would therefore be a welcome \ninvestment instrument to contribute to the deepening of local capital markets.  \n \n3.  Value Added of ADB  \n24.  ADB\u2019s proposed loan will add value by (i) enabling BCC to grow its SME loan portfolio, \nget access to longer maturities and tenge financing, and match assets and liabilities; and (ii) \nhelping develop the long tenor local currency bond market, which is one of the major goals of \nthe Government.   \n \n4.  Measures for Development Impact \n25.  ADB  will  measure  the  expected  development  outcome  of  the  proposed  loan  in \naccordance with the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1).   \n \n5.  Fit to Sector and Country Strategy  \n26.  In view of the Government\u2019s medium-term targets for 2010, the development of a vibrant \nand competitive private sector is vital to ensure economic diversification as well as balanced \nand inclusive development. The Government has a particular focus on SME development and \nthe deepening and development of the financial sector. The ADB program\u2014as set out in the \ncurrently applicable rolling business plan and country partnership strategy program, and the \ncountry strategy and program update 2006\u20132008 (CSP)6\u2014for private sector development seeks \nto complement the Government\u2019s efforts through activities in two key areas: (i) private sector \noperations, and (ii) development of an enabling environment for the private sector. The CSP \nalso  emphasizes  the  Government\u2019s  policy  on  SME  development  to  create  jobs  and \nrecommends ADB assistance by providing credit to SMEs via domestic banks. In addition, the \nCSP recommends equity investments in Kazakh banks, as well as loans in the form of tier II \ncapital and designated credit lines.   \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008): Kazakhstan. Manila. \n ", "6       \n27.  Therefore,  the  proposed  loan  will  contribute  directly  to  CSP  implementation  by \nstrengthening financial intermediation for SMEs. Additionally, the ADB tenge bond issue will \nfoster  development  of  the  domestic  bond  market  by  providing  the  first  benchmark  for  an \n(international) AAA credit. In combination, the loan and tenge bond issuance will assist in \ndeepening the financial markets and providing long-term finance in local currency that matches \nSME financing needs.   \n \nB.  Social and Environmental Safeguard Policies  \n \n28.  The  proposed  loan  has  been  assigned  an  environmental  classification  of  FI  and  a \ncategory  C  for  indigenous  people  and  resettlement.  BCC  will  be  required  to  establish  an \nenvironmental management system, within a time frame to be specified. (ADB will review and \napprove the developed environmental management system.) Further, BCC will build capacity for \nimplementing it in accordance with its specific business needs and with the help of ADB, and \nwill send at least once BCC officer to ADB-sponsored environmental management training. BCC \nhas already adopted general environmental guidelines in its corporate governance code.   \n \nC.  Anticorruption  Policy,  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism \n \n29.  BCC was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and policy \nrelating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire BCC to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering activities or the financing of terrorism. Further, BCC will be required to covenant with \nADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The documentation between ADB and BCC will \nallow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings.   \n \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n30.  The  proposed  investment  would,  if  approved  by  the  Board,  increase  ADB\u2019s \nnonsovereign portfolio investment in (i) Kazakhstan from 8.59% to 9.99%; and (ii) banking \nsystems from 22.59% to 23.77%. The proposed investment is within ADB\u2019s aggregate, country, \nindustry, group, and single project exposure limits for nonsovereign investments.  \n \n31.  ABD will enter into suitable loan agreements and other legally required documents, \nfollowing approval of the proposed financing by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors. These agreements \nwill be on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. In addition, ADB will need to be satisfied \nwith all terms and conditions of any other documents associated with the proposed financial \nassistance. \n \n32.
