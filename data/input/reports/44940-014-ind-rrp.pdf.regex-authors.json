I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \ninvestment in compulsory convertible debentures (CCDs) issued by KUL Urban Development \nPrivate Limited  (KUL UDPL) in an amount up to the rupee equivalent of $35,000,000 for Phase 2 \nof the Pune Nirvana Hills Slum Rehabilitation Project in India.  \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  India suffers from an acute shortage of housing, estimated at 24.71 million housing units, \nand Maharashtra has the greatest shortage at 3.72 million units.1 The problem will increase due \nto  rapid  urbanization  and  population  growth,  amongst  other  factors.  Given  this  tremendous \nshortage of housing, substandard housing and slums are proliferating. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) was approached by Deutsche Bank, a leading real estate financing bank in India, to \nprovide financing for this slum rehabilitation project. The project is considered to be one of the \nbest opportunities for ADB to support slum rehabilitation because of its good location, high \ndevelopment impact, and strong sponsor, Kumar Urban Development Limited (KUDL).   \n2.  Project Design \n3.  Pune, the  second-largest city in Maharashtra, has a population of approximately 5.5 \nmillion people, of which about 32.5% to 40% live in slums.2 It is a growing information technology \nand manufacturing (primarily automobiles) center approximately 170 kilometers east of Mumbai. \nThe city also has an abundance of universities. The project is situated on a prime piece of real \nestate, advantageously located in the Kothrud area of southwest Pune, near the Pune\u2013Mumbai \nexpressway, airport (within 15 kilometers), information technology centers, and major universities. \nResidential housing is in short supply across the city and in particular in the Kothrud area. The \nproject represents one of a few new developments in Kothrud, which also suffers from a lack of \nretail and office space.  \n4.  The project covers a site of 76 acres and entails the in-situ rehabilitation of slum dwellings \nand the development of mixed-use residential and office and retail space, which the sponsor is \nentitled to sell at market prices. Currently a large number of slum households are living in sub-\nstandard conditions on the site. The sponsor will construct (i) multiple buildings to re-house the \nslum dwellers, each building with 11 floors of 13 units each, and several commercial spaces for \nsmall businesses that are operating in the slum area; (ii) residential buildings with apartments, \noffice space, and retail space; and (iii) amenities and infrastructure for the use of the re-housed \nslum  dwellers\u2014housing  society  offices,  a  self-employment  center  for  women,  playgrounds, \ndaycare  facilities,  community  and  senior  citizen  recreation  centers,  libraries,  a  primary  and \nsecondary school, and a park.  \n5.  The project is expected to be constructed in 7 years, including a 4-year construction \nperiod for the rehabilitation buildings that started in 2011. A phased approach is being used to \nmanage the construction and regulatory approval process and to minimize the need for transit \nhousing. During construction, the slum dwellers will either be moved into temporary housing on \n                                                 \n1  Government of India. 2007. 11th Five Year Plan Working Committee. Delhi. \n2  The Times of India. 2011. Congress Keen on Legal Status for Pune Slums. 4 November. ", "2    \nthe site or be paid a monthly rental allowance until they are moved into their new, permanent \nhousing.  Additionally,  for  eligible  and  ineligible  slum  dwellers  under  the  SRS  (para. 6),  the \ndeveloper will pay a moving allowance before the slum dwellers vacate their homes, and when \nthe slum dwellers move into their new apartments. The architect of the commercially saleable \nportion of the project (the \u201cfree-sale\u201d area) is P.G. Patki Architects Pvt. Ltd., which has designed \nseveral well-known projects in India. \n6.   The SRS, regulated by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), is an innovative program \nthat  was  introduced  by  the  state  of  Maharashtra  to  deal  with  rapidly  growing  slums  by \nincentivizing the private sector to fund their rehabilitation. Under the SRS, developers construct \nnew, free residential buildings on a slum site and give eligible slum dwellers title to and full \nownership of their new apartments. Eligibility is determined by the SRA and is based upon proof \nof existence of the slum structure since 1995 and residence for one year prior to the rehabilitation. \nIn return for the development of the new buildings for the slum dwellers, rights are granted to the \ndevelopers to develop a portion of slum land for commercial development purposes, based on the \nfloor space index determined by the SRA.3 Thus, for every one square foot of new housing that a \ndeveloper provides to a slum dweller, the developer is entitled to 2.5 ft2\u20133 ft2 (depending on slum \ndensity and size) for the development of a free-sale area. Under the SRS, each eligible slum \nhousehold receives ownership of a 269 ft2 apartment with a kitchen, bathroom with toilet, running \nwater,  and  electricity,  which  is  a  vast  improvement  over  current  conditions  in  the  slums. \nOwnership of the apartment must be maintained for 10 years, after which it becomes freely \ntransferable. Slum dwellers who currently have shops are provided space on the lower levels of \nthe new buildings. The size of this space will be equal to their current shops, but cannot exceed \n269 ft2. \n7.  Operation and maintenance of the rehabilitation buildings is carried out by the housing \nsociety, formed by the apartment owners, which will outsource such work to external parties. 4 \nThe sponsor will deposit a fixed amount per slum household in an escrow account, which is jointly \nmanaged by the SRA and the housing society. Interest earned from this is expected to be \nsufficient to cover such costs. The households pay their own monthly electricity and running-water \ncosts. These costs are expected to be relatively low and, in many cases, are already being borne \nby the households.5  \n3.  The Sponsor \n8.  Established in 1993 by Mr. Lalit Kumar Jain, chairman and managing director, the sponsor \nis a leading real estate development company based in Pune,. Mr. Kumar and his family jointly \nhold 100% of KUDL. KUDL also has operations in Mumbai and Bangalore. Mr. Jain is well known \nin the real estate industry in Pune and is also the current national president of the Confederation \nof Real Estate Developers Association of India. KUDL has garnered several awards, including a \nlisting in 2009 in the top 10 developers in India by Construction World magazine. KUDL is an ISO \n9001:2000  (for  quality  management  system),  an  ISO  14001:2004  (for  environment)  and  an \nOHSAS-18000 (certification for occupational health and safety assessment series) company.  \n                                                 \n3  Commercial development rights can also be in the form of transferable development rights, which can be used to \nbuild saleable area outside the slum project area. \n4  Housing societies are common in India. The title to an entire multi-owner site and building is held by a cooperative \nhousing society whose shareholders are the individual apartment owners. Ownership of an apartment is passed to \nthe individual apartment owner via shares in each society, which give the owner exclusive rights to use a particular \napartment. Property is sold by transfer of the shares with their appurtenant rights.  \n5  The developer estimates that the slum dwellers currently spend Rs500\u2013Rs600 per month per household for \nelectricity, and Rs1,400 annually for water and property taxes. ", "3 \n9.  KUDL\u2019s  real  estate  developments  cater  to  a  wide  variety  of  customers  and  can  be \nsegregated  into  the  following  categories:  residential  (which  comprises  about  80%  of  the \ncompany\u2019s  developments);  integrated  townships;  redevelopment  projects;  slum  rehabilitation; \nspecial economic zones; and commercial (office and retail) projects. KUDL has completed 3.5 \nmillion  ft2  of  developable  area  since  2006,  including  14  residential  (of  which  three  are \nredevelopments) and seven commercial projects. Several projects are ongoing in various stages \nacross five cities, including Mumbai, and Kumar\u2019s share of the saleable area totals 38.89 million \nft2 for residential and 9.05 million ft2 for office and retail space. The project is a high priority for \nKUDL and the developer is hopeful that it will be a benchmark for future slum rehabilitation \nprojects.  \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n10.  The  development  impact  of  the  project  will  be  high.  It  provides  a  sustainable  and \ninnovative solution to the particularly challenging and intractable problem of rehabilitating urban \nslums, and concurrently increases housing stock for a growing urban population. Given the high \nnumber of urban slums in Asia, this is a critical issue for ADB. The project will serve to decrease \nthe number of slums where a large proportion of Pune\u2019s inhabitants live, and increase private \nsector participation in replacing slums with better housing. The project is one of the larger slum \nrehabilitation projects in Pune and KUDL is also a well\u2013known developer; hence, it is expected \nthat the success of the project will provide a template that can be replicated by other projects. \nFinally, the project will support the development of office and retail space in Pune.  \n2.  Outcome \n11.  The project's primary outcome will be an improvement in the quality of life for slum \ndwellers and access to more housing for urban dwellers in Pune. This is an important contribution \nto the lives of these slum dwellers, who will benefit from the provision of sanitation, clean drinking \nwater, and stronger and safer shelter. This is directly supportive of Millennium Development Goal \n7  (ensuring  environmental  sustainability).  For  most  of  these  families;  obtaining  a  title  to  an \napartment will most probably represent ownership of their first, large valuable asset. Gender \nequality and empowerment of women is supported through (i) 100% issuance of joint titles to \nhusbands and wives; (ii) 100% issuance of titles to women who head households; and (iii) a \nrequirement for a minimum of 33% representation of women in the housing society. The project\u2019s \nprovision of safe and secure housing, as well as other facilities such as playgrounds, daycare \nfacilities and schools, is especially beneficial for women and children.  \n12.  For the non-slum urban dwellers of Pune, the shortage of housing in the city will be \npartially mitigated through the project by creating access to housing for about 9,000 people as \nwell as office and retail space. Construction is a large contributor to employment, particularly in \nthe form of semiskilled and unskilled jobs for lower income groups. Skills and entrepreneurship \ntraining for women will also be conducted. Increasing the share of women employed in the non-\nagriculture wage sector contributes directly to the Millennium Development Goal 3 (promote \ngender equality and empower women). After construction, 300\u2013500 jobs will be created as a \nresult of ongoing retail and other commercial operations in the redeveloped area, of which at least \n20% will be for women.  \n \n \n ", "4    \n3.  Outputs \n13.  The outputs include construction of multiple rehabilitation buildings, providing new and \nbetter housing facilities for current slum dwellers; free-sale apartments; retail space; and office \nand retail space. Currently, an average of 150 workers are on-site each day, which will gradually \nincrease to 1,000 workers on-site per day at the peak of construction in 2014\u20132015. The project \nwill also generate substantial employment for unskilled workers during construction (estimated at \n60%\u201370% of the total construction jobs). Moreover, 30% of the total jobs for interior works are \ntargeted for women. In addition, the project will contribute to the local economy through the \npurchase of local goods and services. Finally, the sponsor will benefit from better environmental \nand social standards through implementation of and adherence to ADB\u2019s social safeguards and \nthe gender action plan.  \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020  \n14.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020,  which  promotes  private  sector \ninvestment in the infrastructure sector, as well as an improvement in public health standards.6 \nStrategy  2020  also  states  that  ADB  will  continue  to  emphasize  gender  equality  and  the \nempowerment of women as fundamental elements of achieving inclusive growth. The project is \nexpected to yield tangible benefits for women and empower them, e.g., through joint ownership of \napartments and job and skills training. Also, under Strategy 2020, cities constitute a key focus, \nspecifically in terms of promoting livable cities that are socially inclusive. The project promotes, in \nan inclusive and innovative way, the private sector\u2019s participation in the slum rehabilitation sector.  \nThis is a sector which the government has so far and can be expected to support only to a limited \nextent.    \n2.  Consistency with Country and Sector Strategy  \n15.  The project is consistent with the country partnership strategy (CPS) 2009\u20132012 for India.7 \nThe  CPS  aims  to  significantly  strengthen  ADB\u2019s  infrastructure  activities  and  to  encourage \ninnovative financing. The CPS further notes that ADB\u2019s ongoing urban sector operations will \ncombine infrastructure development with targeted poverty reduction components. Finally, the \nproject is in line with ADB\u2019s desire to undertake projects that have targeted poverty reduction \ncomponents and promote inclusive growth. The project is also consistent with ADB\u2019s strategies \nand  plans  for  private  sector  development,8 poverty  reduction,9 and  urban  operations.10 The \npoverty  reduction  strategy  supports  the  need  to  undertake  sustainable  housing  projects \nimplemented by the private sector. ADB\u2019s draft urban operations plan states that ADB\u2019s support \nfor  inclusive  cities  must  include  support  to  slum  upgrading,  housing,  land  tenure,  and \ndevelopment and housing finance.  \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan  \n16.   The project will be financed  through sales advances, sponsor equity, and the remaining \nby a combination of CCDs and debt from ADB; FMO, (with participation from GuarantCo) and \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2008.

THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n18.  ADB proposes to provide the rupee equivalent of up to $35 million to the project in the \nform of CCDs, which will be issued by KUL UDPL (issuer). CCDs have been used in the past by \nforeign investors for slum rehabilitation projects, as well as for projects in other sectors. \n19.  The issuer is expected to pay to ADB and other CCD holders a fixed coupon amount, \npayable quarterly. ADB is expected to have the right to nominate one director for appointment to \nthe board of the issuer. To facilitate exit arrangements, ADB will grant to the sponsor a call option \nunder which it will have an option to buy the CCDs, or on default, for a predetermined amount that \nwould both pay the amount invested by ADB and provide a return on such investment. Should the \nsponsor not exercise the option, the CCDs will automatically convert to shares of the issuer. The \nCCD investors may also force a conversion if the issuer defaults on its CCD obligations.  \n20.  Security. The OPCD loan from the issuer to the project company will be secured by a \nmortgage on land and buildings of the project at a minimum collateral value  in relation to the loan \namount.  Additional collateral satisfactory to the CCD holders will be provided if the collateral \nvalue declines below a certain level. The value of the collateral will be reviewed on a semiannual \nbasis by an internationally recognized independent real estate company and valuator. In addition, \nthe OPCD loan will be secured by a guarantee from the sponsor. All proceeds in an enforcement \nscenario will be shared pari passu among Deutsche Bank, the NCD holders, and the OPCD \nholders. In an enforcement situation, conversion to shares will thus give the CCD holders the \n ", "6    \nability to enforce the project company\u2019s obligations to repay the issuer\u2019s OPCD loan and, if \nnecessary, to (i) exercise the security for the OPCD loan and (ii) call on the sponsor guarantee. In \ncertain  circumstances,  control  of  the  issuer  may  also  enable  the  investors  to  recover  their \ninvestments by selling the project company as a whole or by causing it to liquidate. \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n21.  ADB\u2019s value addition to the project is expected to be the following: \n(i)  Funding for the real estate sector, particularly for slum rehabilitation projects, is not \nreadily available from commercial banks. The project will play a pioneering role in \ndemonstrating the commercial viability of slum rehabilitation projects undertaken \nthrough the SRS in India, which may help to catalyze commercial bank financing for \nfuture slum rehabilitation projects.  \n(ii)  ADB\u2019s participation will further strengthen the project through the application of \nADB\u2019s  social  safeguards,  gender  and  development  targets,  and  environmental \nstandards, which are of particular importance.  \nC.  Risks \n22.  Real estate market risk. The project is exposed to real estate market risk, which is \nsubject to high volatility. The current outlook for the Indian residential real estate market overall \nhas been uncertain and opinions have generally been cautious, particularly in areas that have \nbeen the subject of speculative bubbles.  Downward movements in the real estate sector could \nhave  a  negative  impact  on  the  success  of  the  project,  as  well  as  the  sponsor\u2019s  ongoing \ndevelopments.  However, the real estate market in Pune has been stable from about 2005 to \n2011.  Market risk is mitigated since the project is located in what is considered a highly \ndesirable location in Pune, with strong cash flows from the sales of residential space and rental \nof office and retail space. Additionally, the requirement that the OPCD loan maintain a certain \ncollateral cover, which will be provided from non-project sources if needed, protects ADB\u2019s \nposition in the event of declines in market value of the project itself. \n23.   Project risk.  The project\u2019s cash flow is vulnerable to increases in construction costs, \nsales price, construction delays and slowdowns in sales booking rates.  If cash flows fall below \nprojections, the company\u2019s ability to service its debts and complete the project on time may be \nseverely affected.  This risk is partially mitigated by KUDL\u2019s corporate guarantee covering debt \nservice and project completion, a significant amount of sponsor equity to be infused, and sizable \nrevenues which accrue from year six onwards from the sale of residential units and rentals of \nretail space.  \n24.   Sponsor  risk.    Sponsor  cash  flows  are  dependent  on  stable  real  estate  market \nconditions  and  timely  and  successful  execution  of  ongoing  and  pipeline  real  estate \ndevelopments.  This is also the first time that the sponsor will be engaging in large scale slum \nrehabilitation,  which  raises  some  concerns  on  its  ability  to  undertake  the  project,  including \nresettlement of the slum dwellers.  However, comfort is drawn from the fact that KUDL has over \n40 years of experience in real estate development, primarily in the Pune market, where the \nproject  is  based,  and  has  successfully  developed  over  10  million  ft2  of  commercial  and \nresidential areas. KUDL is very committed to the success of the project, which it aspires to \nestablish as the benchmark for slum rehabilitation projects in India.   ", "7 \n25.  Social safeguards risk. Resettlement is the main risk and the most important element of \nany slum rehabilitation project. Resettlement will be largely voluntary since 70% of the slum \nhouseholds have given their consent, as required by the SRS. Furthermore, when eligibility for \nnew housing is determined by the SRA, individual agreements will be signed with the slum \ndwellers. The in-situ resettlement will comply with the rules and regulations of the SRA and any \ninvoluntary resettlement will meet ADB safeguard standards. Due diligence has confirmed that \nadequate social safeguards are in place, and ADB and an external expert will carefully monitor \nthe project during implementation.  \n26.  Regulation  risk.  The  SRA  approval  process  can  be  lengthy.  As  slum  rehabilitation \ncontinues to grow and develop, it is possible that existing regulations may change. The regulatory \nrisk is mitigated in that the sponsor has already received the significant approvals required for this \nproject.  Progress of further approvals is proceeding satisfactorily and will be monitored. \n27.   Reputational risk. Slum rehabilitation is a complex process with sensitive social issues. If \nimproperly implemented, the project could create reputational risk for ADB due to, for instance, \ndiscontent  with  the  quality  of  construction,  delays  in  completion  of  the  project,  political \ninterference, allegations of misconduct, mishandling of involuntary resettlement, and fabrication of \neligibility.  Additionally,  the  real  estate  development  and  construction  sectors  generally  pose \nheightened  risks  for  fraud  and  corruption.  These  risks  are  partly  mitigated  by  the  social \nsafeguards that are in place, as noted above, and through oversight of the SRA. ADB will closely \nmonitor these issues throughout the project. \n28.   Corporate governance risk. The company is a family business, as is common in the \nIndian real estate sector. ADB, as well as its cofinanciers, have done due diligence on this issue \nand this risk is deemed to be acceptable and mitigated to some extent by appropriate corporate \ngovernance in the form of formal board committees modeled on the Securities and Exchange \nBoard  of  India\u2019s  regulations,  such  as  an  audit  committee,  a  shareholders\u2019  and  investors\u2019 \ngrievance committee, a finance committee, and the presence of independent board members. \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.    Safeguards and Social Dimensions  \n29.  Safeguards. The project is classified as category B for environment, category A for \ninvoluntary resettlement, and category C for indigenous peoples. The potential environmental and \nsocial impacts and risks of the project have been defined in the environmental and social impact \nassessment, and effective measures to manage the impacts are outlined in the environmental \nand social management plan. The sponsor has prepared a rehabilitation action plan to minimize \nthese impacts.  The institutional capacity and commitment of the sponsor to manage the project\u2019s \nsocial and environmental risks are deemed adequate. The sponsor obtained the consent of 70% \nof the slum dwellers in the buildable areas, which, as noted, is a condition to SRA approval. The \nsponsor has a dedicated community relations team to ensure that concerns are heard and dealt \nwith adequately. From 2004 to 2011, at least 12 major consultation activities occurred and nearly \nall slum dwellers in the area participated. Information billboards, a model unit, and an information \ncenter have also been established to increase awareness of the project. \n30.  Other social dimensions. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming \nbecause it provides security of tenure and housing titles to both men and women slum dwellers. A \ngender action plan has been prepared that includes issuance of joint ownership certificates under \nthe  names  of  wife  and  husband,  and  of  sole  ownership  certificates  to  women  who  head \nhouseholds; 33% representation and active involvement of women in the housing societies; \n ", "8    \nwomen\u2019s skills enhancement and livelihood development through self-help groups supported by \ncivil society organizations; and recruiting of at least 33% female community liaison officers for the \nsponsor\u2019s community relations team to ensure gender-responsive community engagement. The \nproject will also provide vital infrastructure such as daycare facilities, a primary and secondary \nschool, water and sanitation, and power connections, which will particularly benefit women. A \nlabor management plan has been prepared to manage issues related to migrant labor and to \nensure that KUDL, its contractors, and subcontractors comply with national labor regulations and \nthe internationally accepted core labor standards.  \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n31.  KUDL  and  KUL  UDPL  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  implementing  best  international \npractice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism.
