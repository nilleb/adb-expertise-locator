The reform priorities include efforts to \nimprove the policy framework for SME development, strengthen business competitiveness, and \nenhance SME access to finance. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The \ndevelopment policy letter is in Appendix 3. The program has a medium-term focus. Appendix 4 \npresents the policy matrix and medium-term direction and goals for subprogram 1, and triggers \nas well as milestones for subprogram 2.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nincreasing  efforts \n\nthe  government\u2019s \n\n3. \nThe  government's  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010  (SEDP  2006\u20132010) \nemphasizes the importance of increased private investment in generating economic growth and \nemployment. Since more than 97% of enterprises in Viet Nam are SME and more than 98% of \ntotal  enterprises  are  private  enterprises, \nin  SME \ndevelopment also supports private sector growth.1 The government recognizes that sustainable \ndevelopment  of  SMEs  requires  a  consistent  policy  framework,  supported  by  a  sound  policy, \nlegal,  and  institutional  environment.  Therefore,  integrated  with  the  SEDP  is  the  government\u2019s \nSME Development Plan (SMEDP) 2006\u20132010 to promote SMEs. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) has directly supported the government's SME development policy reforms through loans \nfor the first SME Development Program, also prepared as a program cluster.2 The ADB country \nstrategy and program identifies SME development as a key priority. In addition, ADB has been \nsupporting  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economic  transformation  through  program  clusters  for  state-owned \nenterprise restructuring, microfinance developments, and inclusive growth.3  \n \nReforms implemented under the SEDP and SMEDP have produced significant results.4 \n4. \nTime  required  to  process  business  registration  has  been  reduced  significantly  from  about  50 \n\n \n                                                \n1  The current definition of SMEs in Viet Nam is relatively loose. Based on Decree 56/2009, enterprises with from 10 \nto 300 employees and less than D100 billion of capital belongs to the SME category. For enterprises operating in \nthe  commerce  and  service  sector,  the  capital  requirement  and  number  of  employees  are  lower;  D50  billion  for \ncapital and from 10 to 100 for the number of employees.  \n\n2  The program comprised two back-to-back subprogram loans to be drawn from the Asian Development Fund.

Manila. \n4   Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprise  and  Private  Sector  Development  (Appendix \n\n2). \n\n\fdays in the early 2000s to about 10 working days in 2010.5 This has facilitated a large increase \nin  the  number  of  new  enterprises,  averaging  20%\u201330%  annually  since  2006.  Bank  credit  to \nSMEs and the private sector has expanded by about 34% annually since 2005. SME access to \nland  has  improved  significantly,  as  has  access  to  international  markets,  with  domestic  sector \nexports  expanding  by  about  25%  annually  during  the  last  4  years  before  the  global  financial \ncrisis. With improvement in the business environment, investment has expanded rapidly, led by \nnonstate  and  foreign  direct  investment.  As  a  result,  employment  generated  by  the  domestic \nprivate sector increased rapidly and its share expanded from 29% in 2000 to more than 53% in \n2007. \n \n5. \nMixed  progress  and  continuing  challenges.  Despite  significant  progress,  some \nchallenges  remain.  The  project  completion  report  for  the  first  SME  Development  Program \nrecommends  two  continued  priorities  to  improve  effectiveness  and  sustainability  of  policy \nreforms  to  support  SME  development:  (i)  improving  the  business  environment  and  regulatory \nframework, and (ii) enhancing access to finance.6 These areas of reforms are confirmed by the \nCentral  Institute  for  Economic  Management  (CIEM)-Institute  of  Labour  Science  and  Social \nAffairs  (ILSSA)  survey,  which  identifies  four  areas  where  the  government  could  best  help  in \nremoving  enterprises'  constraints  for  growth:  (i)  enhancing  access  to  finance,  (ii)  improving \naccess  to  land  and  premises,  (iii)  enhancing  SME  policies,  and  (iv)  reducing  bureaucratic \nimpediments.7 The review of implementation of the first SME Development Program also finds \nthat  improved  dialogue  between  government  and  stakeholders  contributed  significantly  to \ndeveloping  and  improving  policies  to  support  SMEs  and  the  private  sector.  The  government \nintends  to  strengthen  these  activities  by  institutionalizing  the  framework  and  improving  the \nparticipation of provincial stakeholders and the role of women as owners of businesses.  \n \n6. \nBusiness environment and regulatory framework. Although the government is giving \nhigh  priority  to  developing  supportive  business-related  regulations,  the  lack  of  clarity  and \ninconsistencies  in  the  increasing  volume  of  implementing  regulations  still  generate  significant \nproblems  for  business.  With  gradually  increasing  decentralization,  local  governments  are \nresponsible  for  the  issuance,  implementation,  and/or  enforcement  of  many  regulations  that \nimpact the private sector. This adds significant cost and uncertainties to SMEs and the business \nsector. 8   While  business  registration  procedures  have  been  significantly  streamlined,  other \nadministrative  procedures  for  some  key  business  activities  such  as  making  tax  payments, \ndealing  with  customs,  and  completing  land  use  rights  remain  complicated.  With  uneven \nprogress  in  business  environment  reforms,  international  comparisons  tend  to  show  that  Viet \nNam has been lagging in improving its business environment in relative terms.9 Consolidation of \neffort and a comprehensive framework is needed to achieve maximum results. \n \n\n                                                 \n5  In Ho Chi Minh City, it was reduced to 3 days for paper-based applications and 1 day for online applications. \n6  ADB.  2009.  Project  Completion  Report:  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Development  Program  Cluster, \n\nSubprograms I and II. Manila. \n\n7  A  longitudinal  survey  conducted  by  CIEM  and  ILSSA  funded  under  the  Danish  International  Development \n\nAssistance's Business Sector Programme Support. \n\n8  See a recent review of the implementation of the Enterprise Law and Investment Law: Nguyen Dinh Cung. 2008. \nImplementation  of  Vietnam's  Enterprise  Law  and  Investment  Law:  A  Regulatory  Reform  Perspective.  Vietnam \nEconomic Management Review. Ha Noi. \n\n9  The most recent international comparative indexes of the business environment such as the World Bank\u2019s Doing \nBusiness  Index  and  the  World  Economic  Forum\u2019s  Global  Competitiveness  Index  suggest  that  the  pace  of  Viet \nNam\u2019s reforms in improving the business environment has declined relative to that of other countries. With regard \nto the overall measure of ease of doing business, Viet Nam's ranking slipped by one position in 2009. Viet Nam\u2019s \nranking in the 2009 Global Competitiveness Index fell to 75th from 70th the previous year, although this may have \nbeen predominately due to the deteriorating macroeconomic environment in 2008. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fAccess to finance. Despite significant progress achieved in improving SMEs\u2019 access to \n7. \nfinance in the last 5 years, a number of surveys still find that access to finance remains the top \nconstraint for business growth. This is in part explained by the large increase in new enterprises \nduring  this  period.  In  the  next  5  years,  the  government  targets  to  double  the  number  of  new \nenterprises.10  These  new  entrants  face  collateral  and  other  traditional  access  constraints.  In \naddition, existing enterprises are constrained by the lack of medium-term credit for investment \nand  innovation.  The  CIEM-ILSSA  survey  finds  that  more  than  65%  of  enterprises  in  the \nmanufacturing  sector  depend  on  retained  earnings  to  support  their  investment.  The  heavy \nreliance  on  self-financing  for  investment  partly  explains  the  relatively  slow  graduation  of \nenterprises  from  micro  to  small  and  from  small  to  medium  size.  Because  constraints  across \ndifferent  sizes  of  SMEs  are  not  uniform,  a  more  comprehensive  approach  is  needed  to  meet \ntheir  different  financing  needs.  In  this  context,  significant  efforts  are  still  required  to  enhance \nSME  access  to  medium-term  credit,  nonbank  financing,  credit  guarantees  for  longer-term \ninvestment loans, and equity financing for larger SMEs. \n \n8. \nNew approach to reflect the new environment. The project completion report for the \nfirst  SME  Development  Program  reiterates  the  importance  of  making  SMEs  more  efficient, \nproductive, and competitive by addressing key institutional and structural impediments affecting \nSME development. The key challenge is to anticipate future needs, including continued efforts \nto simplify national and provincial administrative procedures. From this perspective, the priority \nfor  Viet  Nam  is  to  sustain  high  economic  growth  to  create  productive  jobs  for  an  estimated  \n1.7 million young workers entering the labor market annually. The experience in the last 2 years \nsuggests that this task has become more difficult. Economic overheating and the global financial \ncrisis presented significant challenges to  the SME sector. The government provided extensive \ntemporary measures to assist SMEs to cope with the impacts of the crisis. At the same time, the \ngovernment  recognizes  that,  over  the  medium-term,  creating  sufficient  jobs  will  require \naccelerated reforms to address existing constraints. This will require a stronger policy response \nto  enhance  the  business  environment  and  improve  the  country's  competitiveness.  In  this \ncontext,  the  draft  SEDP  2011\u20132015  includes  a  number  of  key  steps,  including  policies  to  \n(i)  systematically  simplify  business-related  procedures,  (ii)  implement  a  robust  process  of \ncontrolling  the  quality  of  laws  and  regulations,  (iii)  introduce  new  custom  and  tax  payment \nsystems, and (iv) enhance implementation of the Law on Competition.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe impact of the Second SME Development Program is to increase the contribution of \nSMEs and the private sector in achieving sustainable high economic growth. The outcome will \nbe  an  improved  business  environment  to  support  more  competitive  SMEs  and  the  private \nsector.  An  expanding  SME  sector  will  generate  more  and  better  jobs,  and  contribute  to \nsustainable poverty reduction.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10. \nThe Second SME Development Program supports the government's efforts in three core \nreform areas (CRAs): (i) improve the framework for promoting SME development, (ii) strengthen \nthe framework for competition policy, and (iii) enhance SME access to finance. \n\n                                                 \n10 Based on the draft Social and Economic Development Plan 2011\u20132015 being finalized by the government. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f1. \n\nImprove the Framework for Promoting SME Development (CRA1) \n\n \n11. \nAn enabling environment for SME and private sector development requires a supportive \nframework  of  legal,  labor,  fiscal,  and  monetary  policies  that  promote  the  foundations  for \ncompetitive  markets  by  fully  involving  all  stakeholders.  An  effective  medium-term  policy \nframework  is  required  to  coordinate  and  integrate  government  priorities,  policies,  and  plans  in \ncreating  competitive  markets  essential  for  the  SME  sector.  The  first  subprogram  supports  the \ngovernment\u2019s  agenda  to  strengthen  the  framework  for  promoting  SME  policy  formulation  and \ncoordination. The government published the first SME white paper summarizing key issues and \npolicies implemented to address key constraints in SME development. It issued Decree 56/2009 \nto redefine the state's support for SME development and identify the roles of state agencies in \nimplementing  SME  development  policies  in  areas  such  as  access  to  finance,  land  access, \ntechnology  adoption,  and  dissemination  of  information  related  to  SMEs.  The  government \nreviewed implementation of the SMEDP 2006\u20132010 to inform the way forward. \n \n\n2. \n\nStrengthen the Framework for Competition Policy (CRA2) \n\n \n12. \nThe  government  recognizes  the  need  to  put  in  place  a  comprehensive  approach  for \ndeveloping  a  competitive  business  environment.  Although  the  approach  is  not  formally \nannounced  as  a  national  competition  policy  as  in  other  countries,  the  government  has  put  in \nplace many important elements of national competition policy. The first element is trade policy. \nWith Viet Nam's accession to the World Trade Organization in 2007, the average tariff rate has \nbeen  reduced  to  around  14%.  The  current  focus  of  trade  policy  is  to  improve  trade  facilitation \nthrough  customs  modernization.  The  second  important  element  of  competition  policy  is  to \nincrease  efficiency  of  the  business  environment  by  simplifying  administrative  procedures, \nkeeping  close  control  of  the  promulgation  of  new  regulations,  and  implementing  regulatory \nimpact  assessments  (RIAs)  for  all  new  regulations.  This  component  of  policy  consolidates \nprevious  efforts  at  regulatory  simplification,  and  embeds  the  policy  focus  in  a  comprehensive \nframework  for  measuring  the  costs  and  benefits  of  regulatory  proposals  as  well  as  for  their \nelimination. The third element of the policy is to enhance implementation of the Competition Law \nand  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Vietnam  Competition  Authority  (VCA)  to  ensure  fair \ncompetition  among  all  economic  participants.  Other  policy  efforts  such  as  upgrading  labor \nmarket  regulations  and  labor  relations,  and  addressing  infrastructure  constraints  will  be \nimportant  for  improving  competitiveness.  The  latter,  however,  is  beyond  the  scope  of  the \nprogram. \n \nThe first subprogram supports the government\u2019s agenda to advance reforms in areas of \n13. \ncritical significance, including implementation of administrative procedure review, RIAs, customs \nreform, enterprise registration simplification, and improved labor market relations.  \n \nAdministrative procedure. The government has assessed all ministerial and provincial \n14. \nadministrative  procedures,  which  are  published  in  the  website.  The  government  issued  a \nresolution  requiring  line  ministries  and  other  relevant  agencies  to  review  around  250  priority \nprocedures using a standard cost module to identify costs and benefits to the economy. About \n40% of these priority procedures are business-related procedures, including custom, tax, land-\nuse right, and building procedures. Simplification of these procedures is expected to save about \n30%\u201340%  of  the  time  and  cost  of  compliance  for  businesses.  To  control  administrative \nprocedures,  the  government  issued  Decree  63/2010  to  provide  guidelines  for  issuing  new \nprocedures, and mechanisms for reviewing existing ones based on necessity, user friendliness, \nand legality.  \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fRegulatory  impact  assessment.  The  government  reviews  every  law  and  regulation \n15. \nafter  5  years  of  implementation.  To  support  the  government's  efforts  to  improve  the  quality  of \nlaws and regulations, the Law on Promulgation of Legal Normative Documents was amended in \nJune 2008. The government issued implementing regulations for the law (Decree 24/2009/ND-\nCP  and  Prime  Minister  Decision  636/2009)  requiring  responsible  ministries  and  agencies  to \nprepare  and  submit  an  RIA  when  proposing  new  legislation  to  be  included  in  the  annual \nlegislative  plan.  To  support  this  effort  within  the  Ministry  of  Justice,  the  government  amended \nexisting regulations to include provisions for the reorganization of the ministry and assignment \nof the department responsible for law preparation and RIA evaluation and enforcement.  \n \n16.   Competition policy. Viet Nam is gradually developing the institutional capacity needed \nto  address  restraints  to  trade  and  competition.  The  government  established  two  agencies  to \nimplement the law: the VCA with investigative powers and the Vietnam Competition Council with \nadjudicative powers.11 The VCA initiated a review of the effectiveness of current regulatory and \ninstitutional  arrangements  for  competition  and  the  need  for  reforms  to  ensure  more  effective \npromotion of competition in the economy.12 \n \n17. \nCustoms  and  tax  administrations.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  implemented  the \npilot  e-custom  program  in  10  provinces  and  completed  a  master  plan  for  the  Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations\u2019 single window. It implemented an on-line tax application service on a \npilot basis in four cities and/or provinces, and then rolled out the service to other provinces and \nother  types  of  taxpayers  in  the  first  half  of  2010.  The  service  will  be  implemented  across  the \ncountry  over  the  medium  term.  In  addition,  the  government  has  established  a  link  and \ncooperation among related agencies (tax, state treasury, customs, and finance department) in \n34 provinces to support implementation of the new tax payment method. In large localities, MOF \nhas  started  pilot  implementation  of  tax  payment  using  ATMs,  bank  accounts,  and  other \nmeasures through the commercial bank system. \n \nBusiness  registration.  To  improve  the  business  registration  system,  the  government \n18. \nintroduced  a  new  web-based  national  business  registration  system  to  simplify  and  unify \nbusiness  registration  processes  in  all  63  provinces,  and  consolidate  provincial  business \nregistration  information  into  a  national  database  searchable  throughout  the  country.  The \ngovernment  has  also  developed  a  user  support  training  program  to  improve  the  capacity  and \nservice quality of provincial business registration offices with the support of the United Nations \nIndustrial Development Organization.  \n \nLabor  market  regulations  and  labor  relations  mechanism.  Prior  to  the  global \n19. \nfinancial crisis, the escalation of illegal and/or disruptive labor disputes was a pressing concern \nfor investors, especially foreign investors. The government established a center to support the \ndevelopment  of  harmonized  and  stable  industrial  relations.  The  government  also  introduced \nunemployment insurance, in accordance with the Social Insurance Law.13   \n \n\n3. \n\nEnhance SME Access to Finance (CRA3)  \n\n \n20.  While access of SMEs to finance has improved considerably in the last 5 years, access \nto  finance  remains  the  top  constraint.  As  constraints  across  SMEs  are  not  uniform,  the \nchallenge is to ensure the availability of various products to meet their various needs. Smaller \n\n                                                 \n11 Established under Decree 05/2006/ND-CP 9 January 2006. \n12 http://english.vietnamnet.vn/biz/2009/09/868843. \n13  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to Viet Nam for Developing the Social Security System. Manila. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nSMEs and new entrants are more constrained by collateral and capacity to borrow. Therefore, \nsimplification of procedure to obtain land user rights, development of the leasing industry, and \nenhanced financial institutions in dealing with SMEs would help improve access to financing for \nthis segment of enterprises. The government enacted new regulations aimed at increasing SME \naccess  to  leasing  finance.14  The  newly  introduced  nationwide  credit  guarantee  system  (CGS) \ndesigned  to  specifically  support  commercial  bank  investment  lending  to  SMEs  will  play  an \nimportant role in easing part of this constraint. However, the CGS, provided through the Vietnam \nDevelopment Bank, offers a guarantee of up to 100% of the original loan and accrued interest. \nInternational experience on credit guarantees suggests that a partial guarantee provides a more \nbalanced incentive for each party to ensure sustainability of the system. Vietnam Development \nBank  conducted  an  assessment  of  the  design  based  on  initial  implementation  of  the  CGS  for \nSMEs,  and  provided  MOF  with  recommendations  on  more  appropriate  sharing  of  credit  risks \nand  collateral  with  the  38  participating  commercial  banks.  This  review  should  foster  the \nestablishment and operation of a sustainable national credit guarantee scheme.  \n \n21. \nOne  of  key  constraints  for  enterprises  moving  from  micro  to  small  and  from  small  to \nmedium  is  lack  of  access  to  larger  financing  as  most  enterprises  rely  on  retained  earnings  to \nfinance business expansion. Equity finance is another viable option for larger SMEs. Currently, \nabout 1,000 larger SMEs are accessing the grey equity market. The Unlisted Public Company \nMarket,  launched  in  June  2009,  permits  the  entry  of  any  public  company  with  100  or  more \nexternal shareholders and chartered capital of D10 billion or more, and thus is open to SMEs. In \naddition,  the  current  interest  rate  cap  on  commercial  bank  loans  to  businesses  helps  reduce \ninterest  rate  costs  for  some  eligible  enterprises. 15  At  the  same  time,  however,  it  constrains \nbanks  in  pricing  the  risks  for  smaller  and  new  enterprises.  The  State  Bank  of  Vietnam  issued \nCircular 07/2010/TT-NHNN to allow credit institutions and their clients to negotiate lending rates \nto enhance medium- and long-term lending to ease constraints on investment financing. \n \n22. \nThe second subprogram. The program recognizes that achieving its intended outcome \nwill require a coherent medium-term reform strategy. Key features of the program include (i) two \nsingle-tranche  operations,  with  a  well-defined,  medium-term  framework  specified  at  the  outset \nand including completion of key reforms prior to consideration by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors; (ii) a \nlimited number of well-targeted policy actions aimed at achieving key outcomes; and (iii) triggers \nfor  the  subsequent  subprogram  to  support  continuity  of  dialogue  with  the  government, \ndevelopment partners, and other stakeholders on the same core policy areas. In this way, the \nprogram  supports  a  coherent  medium-term  reform  strategy  with  two  discrete  but  linked \nsubprograms and a strong emphasis on performance. The next phase focuses on implementing \nimprove  business \nsteps \ncompetitiveness  through  continued  administrative  simplification  and  better  regulations,  and \nenhance SME access to finance. The decision on whether to proceed with the next subprogram \nis contingent on overall satisfactory performance of the triggers. The program also recognizes \nthe necessity for flexibility in the reform measures for subprogram 2 given that the government \nis  finalizing  the  2011\u20132015  SEDP.  The  design  of  the  subsequent  program  will  incorporate \nlessons  from  implementation  of  the  first  subprogram  and  respond  to  changes  in  the  external \nenvironment. The indicative cost of reforms for subprogram 2 is $80 million. The loan to support \nreform under subprogram 2 is expected to be $60 million. Continued technical assistance (TA) \nwill be required to support implementation of the proposed reforms and ADB will coordinate with \nother development partners in this effort.  \n \n\nto  promote  SME  development, \n\nto  strengthen \n\nframework \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n14 Decree 95/2008/ND-CP (August 2008), which came into effect in late September 2008. \n15 The lending rate cannot exceed 150% of the base rate of the State Bank of Vietnam. \n\n\fTriggers  and  key  milestones  for  subprogram  2.  Eight  triggers  are  unidentified  for \n\nTechnical assistance. The ongoing ADB project preparatory TA is assisting the Ministry \n23. \nof  Planning  and  Investment  (MPI)  in  implementing  Decree  56/2009  and  enhancing  the \nframework  for  promoting  SME  development.  Part  of  the  TA  will  be  used  to  support  related \ntraining  to  improve  SME  access  to  finance.  The  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  has \nbeen  and  will  continue  providing  support  in  the  area  of  access  to  finance,  competition  policy, \nand capacity building to MPI. The European Union and the Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment  will  assist  in  implementing  competition  policy  through  their  post-World  Trade \nOrganization assistance. \n  \n24. \nsubprogram 2 (Appendix 4): two are under CRA1, five under CRA2, and one under CRA3.  \n \nTriggers  under  CRA1.  The  key  objective  under  this  policy  area  is  to  develop \n25. \ncomprehensive  and  achievable  medium-term  policies  to  support  SME  development.  The  first \ntrigger  is  for  MPI  to  organize  public  consultations,  including  with  provincial  governments  and \nrepresentatives  of  women  business  associations,  to  prepare  the  second  5-year  SMEDP  for \n2011\u20132015.  The  second  trigger  is  the  issuance  of  the  second  5-year  SMEDP  based  on  the \nSEDP 2011\u20132015. One key milestone supporting these efforts is the improvement of data and \nSME statistics. \n \nTriggers  under  CRA2.  The  first  trigger  under  the  second  policy  area  is  the \n26. \nestablishment  of  a  national  agency  responsible  for  implementing  the  Decree  63/2010  on \nAdministrative Procedure Control. The second trigger is to support efforts to institutionalize RIAs \nby  developing  guidelines  and  a  manual  for  implementing  RIAs  to  support  sustainable \nimprovement of the quality of laws and regulations. The third trigger is to develop a road map for \nfull implementation of the e-custom system based on pilot implementation. The fourth trigger is \nfor MOF to introduce a new system to reduce the time needed for tax payment. The fifth trigger \nrelates  to  the  Law  on  Competition.  To  support  efforts  in  creating  equal  opportunities  and \nimproving  competition,  the  government  will  submit  a  revised  draft  Law  on  Competition  to  the \nNational Assembly. One key milestone is the completion of an RIA on the revision of the Law on \nCompetition. In addition, although most complaints received by VCA  are from  SMEs, a recent \nsurvey  suggests  that  80%  of  enterprises  are  not  aware  of  the  role  of  VCA.  Therefore,  VCA \nneeds to enhance its advocacy role.  \n\nProgram Costs and Financing \n\n \n27. \nTriggers under CRA3. The one trigger for subprogram 2, to support efforts in improving \naccess to finance, is the issuance of a revised legal framework for the CGS that includes more \nappropriate credit risk and collateral sharing with participating commercial banks. \n \nD. \n \nThe  size  of  the  loan  for  the  first  subprogram  is  based  on  considerations  of  several \n28. \nfactors  required  to  support  implementation  of  program  reforms. 16   These  include:  (i)  the \nimportance of the sector to the economy, the weight and benefits of the reform program; (ii) the \ndirect administrative and/or adjustment costs involved in design and implementation of specific \nreforms, and (iii) the need to conform to the overall financing requirement for the current country \npartnership  strategy.  Quantifiable  key  benefits  of  the  program  include  (i)  cost  saving  for \nbusiness  from  business  procedures  simplification  (D6  trillion,  $300  million);  (ii)  increase  SME \naccess to finance through the CGS (D12 trillion in 2009); and (iii) increase SME access to equity \nfinance  trough  UPCoM  (D8  trillion).  The  sustainable  reforms  supported  by  the  program  also \n\n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2010. Program Lending. Operations Manual. OM D4/BP. Manila (para. 28).  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nhave  other  benefits  such  as  reduced  uncertainties,  widened  tax  base,  and  improved  business \nclimate.  The  major  administrative  or  adjustment  cost  of  reforms  is  estimated  to  be  about  $70 \nmillion  in  aggregate,  arising  from  (i)  initial  investment  cost  to  set  up  the  national  CGS, \ndisseminate  CGS  processes  to  enterprises,  and  train  Vietnam  Development  Bank  staff  and \nenterprises; (ii) investment cost to start the pilot e-custom system and implement the web-based \nbusiness  registration  system;  and  (iii)  administrative  and  staff  costs  to  review  existing \nadministrative  procedures  and  to  issue  new  regulations  to  improve  the  business  environment. \nTo  support  the  reform  initiatives  outlined  in  the  program,  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  has \nrequested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR26,537,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources  to  help  finance  the  program.  The  loan  will  have  a  24-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  8  years,  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement. \nThe government will fund the remaining resource requirement. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n29.  MPI will be the executing agency for the program. MPI will establish an inter-ministerial \nprogram  steering  committee  and  assign  the  Enterprise  Development  Agency  to  coordinate \nimplementation of policy actions with MOF; the Ministry of Justice; the State Bank of Vietnam; \nMinistry of Industry and Trade; Office of the Government; and the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and \nSocial Affairs, all of which are directly involved in supporting program implementation. Based on \nlessons  from  implementation  of  the  first  SME  Development  Program,  program  steering \ncommittee  members  should  be  working  officials  directly  responsible  for  reforms  supported  by \nthe  program.  The  Enterprise  Development  Agency  will  convene  biannual  meetings  to  monitor \nprogress and ADB will be invited to participate in the meetings as an observer. The agency will \nbe  responsible  for  administering  day-to-day  program  activities,  maintaining  records,  and \nreporting  on  implementation  progress.  The  subprogram  1  period  is  from  August  2008  to \nSeptember  2010;  the  loan  of  $40  million  is  to  be  disbursed  as  a  single  tranche  when  the \ngovernment  has  met  the  conditions  for  loan  effectiveness.  The  proceeds  of  the  program  loan \nwill  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB's  Simplification  of  Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.17  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nGovernance \n\n30.  While  noting  steady  progress  in  public  financial  management  reforms,  the  assessment \nidentifies some areas for improvement. Implementation of the 2002 State Budget Law and the \n2005 Accounting Law is progressing; however both laws need to be updated. Budget coverage \nin  Viet  Nam  is  reasonably  comprehensive,  but  still  incomplete  compared  with  international \npractices.  The  government  has  piloted  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework  in  several \nsectors,  but  it  needs  to  be  scaled  up  and  mainstreamed  in  the  annual  budget  cycle.  Public \nfinancial  management  systems  are  being  upgraded  by  rolling  out  the  treasury  and  budget \nmanagement  information  system,  and  the  road  map  for  adoption  of  international  public  sector \naccounting  standards  has  been  issued.  The  State  Audit  Law  provides  independence  for  the \nstate  auditing  body  and  enhances  transparency  by  making  audit  reports  publicly  available. \nOversight  by  the  National  Assembly  and  provincial  people\u2019s  committee  councils  continues  to \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n\n\fPoverty and Social \n\nstrengthen. The World Bank\u2019s assessment suggests that the fiduciary risks of the current public \nfinancial management systems (budgeting, accounting, reporting, and auditing) are moderate.18  \n \n31. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government of Viet Nam and MPI. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual \n \nB. \n \n32. \nViet  Nam  has  experienced  remarkable  success  in  achieving  rapid  and  sustained \neconomic growth and poverty reduction since the country started its economic reform program \nDoi Moi in the late 1980s. Supported by annual gross domestic product growth of around 7.2%, \nthe overall poverty rate dropped from 58% in 1993, to 37.4% in 1998, to 16% in 2006, and an \nestimated 14.8% in 2008. The impressive reduction in poverty is largely attributable to sustained \nbusiness-led growth in investment, output, and employment, complemented by targeted poverty \nreduction interventions. Most new jobs in the last decade were created by SMEs and the private \nsector.  Despite  this  progress,  the  absolute  number  of  people  living  in  poverty  remains  large. \nBased on the poverty measure calculated by the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs, \nabout  11.3  million  were  living  below  the  national  official  poverty  line  in  2008.  Moreover,  since \nthe  number  of  near-poor  is  large,  the  vulnerability  of  the  population  to  poverty  is  high.  The \nprogram  supports  the  government  in  preparing  the  2011\u20132015  SMEDP.  A  report  by  the \nInternational  Finance  Corporation  on  Vietnamese  women  entrepreneurs  suggests \nthat \npreparation  of  the  SMEDP  may  particularly  encourage  women  business  entrepreneurs.19  The \nCIEM-ILSSA  survey  on  manufacturing  enterprises  also  finds  that  the  proportion  of  women \nemployees, including in senior positions, increases as enterprises get larger. The program has \nthe  potential  to  bring  benefits  to  women's  entrepreneurship  and  employment  by  supporting \ngovernment  efforts  to  increase  the  number  of  enterprises,  and  by  easing  constraints  for \nenterprise growth. \n \nC. \n\nSafeguards \n\n33. \nThe  program  does  not  trigger  the  safeguard  policies  and  is  categorized  as  C  for \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people. The following are agreed upon, \nand  will  be  incorporated  into  the  legal  agreement.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nprogram. The government agrees to cooperate, and shall cause any and all government offices, \norganizations and entities involved in implementing the program to cooperate fully with any such \ninvestigation  and  extend  all  necessary  assistance,  including  access  to  all  relevant  books  and \nrecords, as may be necessary for the satisfactory completion of any such investigation. \n \nD. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n34. \nThe program is firmly embedded in the SEDP 2006\u20132010, the SMEDP 2006\u20132010, and \nongoing  business  climate  reforms.  The  assumptions  underlying  the  program  include  the:  (i) \nexternal  economic  environment  will  improve  to  support  domestic  macroeconomic  stability,  (ii) \ngovernment  will  stay  on  course  with  key  business  regulatory  reform  measures,  and  (iii) \n                                                 \n18 World  Bank.  2009.

The ongoing weak external environment provides \nan opportunity to build consensus among stakeholders on difficult policy \nreform issues and accelerate structural reforms to strengthen small and \nmedium-sized enterprises' resilience.  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCE \n\nThe  government  and  MPI  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  program  will \n35. \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan documents. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n36. \nI am satisfied that the proposed program cluster and loan would comply with the Articles \nof  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the \nPresident,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I \nrecommend that the Board approve \n \n\nthe  program  cluster  for  the  Second  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises \nDevelopment Program, and \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR26,537,000  to  the  Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam for subprogram 1 of the Second Small and Medium-Sized \nEnterprises Development Program, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter; for a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with \nthose set forth in the draft program loan agreement presented to the Board. \n\n \nC.
