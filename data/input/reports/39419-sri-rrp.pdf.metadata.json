Initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  have  been \nundertaken. The summary IEE is in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \nThe  Project  has  three  investment  components:  energy  efficiency \nimprovement, renewable energy development, and access for the \npoor.  \n \nThe  energy  efficiency \ninclude \n(i) system control modernization (part 1); (ii) transmission system \nstrengthening  (part  2);  (iii)  distribution  substations  augmentation \n(part  3);  (iv)  demand-side  management  for  municipal  street \nlighting  (part  4);  and  (v)  consulting  services  for  system  control \nmodernization (part 5).  \n \nThe  clean  energy  development  component  will  be  network \ncapacity augmentation for renewable energy projects (part 6).  \n \nThe  access  for  the  poor  component  will  include  (i)  transmission \nsystem strengthening in the Eastern Province (part 7) and (ii) rural \nhousehold connection (part 8).  \n \nSri  Lanka\u2019s  power  sector  struggled  throughout  the  late  1980s, \n1990s,  and  early  2000s  to  meet  the  growing  demand  for \nelectricity.  Electricity  is  expensive  and  subject  to  interruptions. \nAbout  20%  of  households  do  not  have  access  to  it.  The  Ceylon \nElectricity  Board  is  burdened  with  debt,  restricting  its  ability  to \nmake  capital  investments  and  discouraging  private  investment. \nThe  Government  is  fully  committed  to  addressing  these  issues \nand has developed a Ten-Year Development Framework (TYDF). \nUnder  the  TYDF,  the  Government  has  developed  a  national \nenergy  policy  and  strategies  (NEPS).  The  NEPS  provides  a \ncomprehensive  road  map  for  the  sector.  It  includes  a  long-term \ninvestment program and specific policy and reform measures and \naims  to  (i)  supply  electricity  to  86%  of  households  by  2010  and \n98% by 2016, and (ii) ensure electricity tariffs are competitive with \nthose in other countries and sufficient for utilities to be viable. \n \n \nUnder  the  NEPS,  the  Government  is  accelerating  its  long-term \ngeneration  expansion  plan  (LGEP) \nto  build  up  generation \ncapacity,  primarily  with  bilateral  funding.  At  the  same  time,  it  is \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\ncontinuing its loss reduction efforts and launching a demand-side \nmanagement  program  to  improve  energy  efficiency.  Substantial \ninvestments  will  be  required  to  strengthen  the  transmission \nnetwork  and  for  power  plants.  The  huge  potential  for  energy \nconservation  through  demand-side  management  needs  to  be \nmore actively tapped. \n \nThe  share  of  thermal  power  in  the  power  generation  mix  has \nincreased  dramatically  from  1%  in  1986  to  58%  in  2008  as  the \nentire  demand  growth  has  been  served  by  oil-fired  thermal \ngeneration.  This  poses  a  serious  threat  to  the  country\u2019s  energy \nsecurity  as  well  as  to  the  environment,  given  Sri  Lanka\u2019s \noverdependence on imported fossil fuels. Coupled with fuel price \nincreases and the delayed construction of new hydropower plants, \ngeneration costs have substantially increased. There is an urgent \nneed  to  develop  clean  energy  and  indigenous  renewable  energy \nsources.   \n \nTo  achieve  the  electrification  target  under  the  TYDF,  particular \nattention  needs  to  be  paid  to  regions  with  serious  power \nshortages  and  many  unconnected  households,  including  conflict-\naffected  areas.  The  transmission system  is  currently  too  weak  to \nmeet  growing  demand  in  the  regions.  Despite  the  Government\u2019s \nintensive  investment  program  to  expand  the  rural  distribution \nnetwork,  many  poor  households  remain  unconnected  even  in \nareas connected to the grid because they cannot afford the initial \ncost of service connection.  \n \nThe Project will support the Government to address these issues \nthrough  investment  loans  and  grant  and  associated  technical \nassistance.   \n \nThe  Government  has  taken  measures  to  strengthen  governance \nand  rationalize  tariffs.  The  Sri  Lanka  Electricity  Act  has  been \npassed  by  Parliament  in  March  2009.  It  will  empower  the  Public \nUtilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) to regulate the power \nsector.  To  restore  the  financial  viability  of  the  sector,  the \nGovernment  has  restructured  the  debt  of  the  Ceylon  Electricity \nBoard (CEB) and raised tariffs by 30% in 2008 to reduce its cash \nshortfall \nfurther \nstrengthening  of  the  governance  of  the  sector  through  its \nassociated  technical  assistance  for  capacity  development  of \nPUCSL and CEB.   \n \nThe  Project  aims  to  realize  an  affordable  and  reliable  power \nsupply for sustained and inclusive economic growth by improving \nthe  coverage  and  service  efficiency  of  the  CEB  and  Lanka \nElectricity Company (LECO).   \n \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  $188.2  million \nincluding taxes and duties of $3.8 million.  \n\nsubstantially.

CEB will be the sole Implementing Agency \nfor  all \nfor  distribution  substations \naugmentation  (part  3)  and  demand-side  management  (part  4) \nparts  which  will  be  implemented  jointly  by  CEB  and  LECO.  Day-\nto-day  project \nimplementation  will  be  done  by  project \nimplementation  units  (PIUs)  to  be  set  up  in  CEB  and  LECO \nexclusively for the Project and headed by senior officers.   \n \nThe  distribution  substations  augmentation  part  will  be \nimplemented  initially  by  LECO,  and  subsequently  the  project \nassets  and  associated  debt  will  be  transferred  to  CEB,  who  will \nundertake operation and maintenance.  \n \nThe  demand-side  management  part  will  be  implemented  by  both \nCEB  and  LECO  in  their  respective  jurisdictions.  Once  MOPE \nissues  a  policy  circular  to  delegate  responsibility  for  municipal \nstreet lighting in selected areas from municipal authorities to CEB \nand  LECO,  they  will  establish  internal  energy  service  company \n(ESCO) units within which escrow accounts will be established to \naccumulate energy savings gains. The associated ADB technical \nassistance  will  help  them  to  do  this.  Upon  completion  of  the \npayback  period,  energy  savings  will  create  a  revenue  stream  in \naddition  to  that  generated  through  tariffs.  It  is  envisioned  that  a \ncertain  percentage  of  energy  savings  profits  accumulated  at  the \nescrow  account  will  be  used  for  reinvestment  in  other  energy \nefficiency  projects  identified  by  the  ESCO  unit  as  part  of  its \noperational responsibilities.  \n \nThe rural household connection part  will be implemented by CEB \nwith  the  support  of  service  providers  to  be  engaged  under  a \nperformance-based  contract  on  terms  and  conditions  acceptable \nto  ADB.    When  a  credit  application  is  submitted  to  CEB  from  a \ncustomer  household,  a  service  provider  will  assess \nthe \nhousehold\u2019s  repayment  capacity,  while  CEB  will  confirm  the \ntechnical  eligibility  of  electricity  connection.  If  the  application  is \napproved,  CEB  will  provide  a  service  connection  and  the \nconnection  cost  will  be  recorded  as  a  loan  to  the  customer  in \nCEB\u2019s balance sheet and recovered in installments over the next \n24\u201336  months.  An  escrow  account  will  be  set  up  in  CEB  to \nreceive  installment  payments.  Principal  and  interest  payments \nfrom  households  will  be  credited  to  the  account  and  used  to \nprovide  new  installment  credits.  ADB  will  provide  associated \ntechnical  assistance  for  the  detailed  design  of  the  part,  selection \nof service providers, and capacity building of major stakeholders. \n \n\n\fProcurement  \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nv\n\nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  under  the \nloans  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). All procurement \npackages except for part 4 (the demand-side management) will be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  international  competitive  bidding \n(ICB) procedures. Shopping procedures will be used for the part 4 \nfor \nthe  procurement  of  standard  specification  goods  with \nestimated costs less than $0.1 million.  \n \nCEB  and  LECO  have  requested  advance  contracting  and \nretroactive  financing  for  procurement  of  goods  up  to  20%  of  the \ncumulative  total  of  the  OCR  loan  agreement  and  the  ADF  loan \nagreement for a period of up to 12 months prior to the signing of \neach  loan  agreement.  ADB  management  agreed  to  approve \nretroactive  financing  for  all  parts  (except  for  part  4)  upto  20%  of \nthe  proceeds  from  the  loans,  provided  that  expenditures  are  in \naccordance  with  the  Procurement  Guidelines  and  safeguard \npolicies,  and  were  incurred  during  the  12  months  before  the \nsigning of the respective loan agreements. CEB and LECO were \ninformed  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  or  retroactive \nfinancing does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \nFor the system control modernization part, loan-funded consulting \nservices  will  be  provided  under  part  5  to  support  CEB  in \nprocurement, construction supervision and also, on an intermittent \nbasis,  operation  and  maintenance  and  liability  issues  for  the \ndefect  liability  period  (12  months  after  commissioning).  CEB  will \nselect  and  engage  consultants  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-\nbased  selection  (QCBS)  procedures  at  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of \n80:20  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2007, as amended from time to time), using the full \ntechnical  proposal  method.  About  22  person-months  of \ninternational  and  3 person-months  of  national  consultants  are \nexpected to be required.  \n \nThe  energy  efficiency  improvement  component  will  enhance  the \noverall reliability of the power system to benefit households, small \nand  medium-sized  businesses,  and  public  services,  including,  in \nparticular,  schools  and  hospitals.  It  will  bring  power  to  industrial \ndistricts  where  existing  industries  currently  relying  on  captive \ngenerators  will  be  able  to  improve  their  productivity.  New \ninvestments  will  also  be  encouraged  by  the  additional  availability \nof  power.  In  both  cases,  a  sharp  increase  in  labor  demand  is \nultimately  expected  to  benefit the local population. The demand- \nside management part is expected to save energy equivalent to a \nthermal  power  plant  of  3.5  MW.  The  renewable  energy \ndevelopment  component   will   help   bring  200   MW   of   clean \nhydropower energy into the grid, thereby reducing CO2-equivalent \nemissions per year by about 0.5 million tons. \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nimprove  access \n\nThe  access  for  the  poor  component  will  contribute  to  social  and \neconomic inclusion and the integration of the marginalized people, \nespecially  in  rural  areas.  Health,  hygiene,  and  sanitation  will  be \nimproved.  Children  and  adolescents  will  be  able  to  spend  more \nhours  studying.  The  component  will \nto \ninformation,  awareness  and  knowledge.  It  will  enhance  mobility \nand security, particularly where people suffer from attacks by wild \nanimals while searching for food or where they are affected by the \nconflict.  Electrification  will  enable  poor  households  engaged  in \nhome-based  economic  activities  to  generate  more  household \nincome  and  to  save  time  and  physical  labor  by  using  electrical \nappliances.  The  rural  household  connection  part  will  connect  at \nleast 60,000 poor households (8% of the total) to the grid.  \n \nThe  access  for  the  poor  component  will  directly  benefit  the \nEastern  Province,  which  has  been  severely  affected  by  the \nconflict,  and  other  poor  regions.  Such  regions  often  suffer  from \nharsh weather and natural disasters, and lack basic infrastructure, \nincluding  electricity  distribution.  Three  districts  in  the  Eastern \nProvince  where  the  component  will  be  implemented  have  mixed \nSinhalese, Tamil, and Muslim populations, and are therefore more \ncomplex  than  other  parts  of  the  country.  The  Project  will  directly \ncontribute  to  the  development  of  the  Eastern  Province,  but  will \nalso benefit other regions that are lagging behind.  \n \nThe  major  assumptions  are  that  (i)  the  Government  will  remain \ncommitted to power sector reforms; (ii) LGEP will be implemented \nin  a  timely  manner;  and  (iii)  the  Sri  Lanka  Electricity  Act  will  be \nefficiently implemented for PUCSL to regulate the sector. \n  \nThe  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  sector  reform  is  demonstrated \nby  the  fact  that  it  has  (i)  provided  financial  support  for  the \nlong-term  debt  restructuring  plan; \nimplementation  of  CEB\u2019s \n(ii)  submitted  the  NEPS  for  parliamentary  approval,  which  is  not \nrequired \nit;  and \nfor  a  policy  document,  and  gazetted \n(iii) substantially increased retail tariffs to improve CEB\u2019s financial \nposition. CEB has drafted its first long-term corporate plan, which \nit  is  using  as  a  basis  for  its  internal  reform  exercise.  The \nGovernment has already secured financing for the priority projects \nin  LGEP  and \ntotaling  950  MW  are  being \nimplemented. \n \nParliament has passed the Sri Lanka Electricity Act in March 2009 \nand  PUCSL  has  started  regulating  the  power  sector.  Although \nthere  is  a  risk  that  PUCSL  and  CEB  will  lack  the  capacity  to \noperate  effectively  under  the  new  regulatory  framework,  this  will \nbe  substantially  mitigated  by  ADB\u2019s  technical  assistance  for \ncapacity  development  of \ntwo  agencies  and  PUCSL\u2019s \nexperience in supporting the Government\u2019s policy-making over the \npast 4 years.    \n\nthree  projects \n\nthe \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\nvii\n\n \nOther  risks  to  the  implementation  of  the  investment  projects \ninclude (i) delays in associated generation investments, (ii) delays \nin  project  implementation  and  resulting  project  cost  escalation, \nand  (iii)  a  deterioration  in  the  security  situation  in  the  Eastern \nProvince.  These  risks  also  appear  to  be  low.  A  policy  and \nregulatory  framework  is  already  in  place  to  streamline  the \nGovernment approval process for renewable energy projects.

A design and monitoring framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nIn  Sri  Lanka, \n\nSri Lanka\u2019s power sector struggled throughout the late 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s to \n2. \nmeet the growing demand for electricity. Given that demand for power is growing by about 8% \nper  year,  the  country  faces  a  serious  shortage  of  power  and  a  consequent  slowdown  of \neconomic growth unless generation capacity is significantly increased and the transmission and \ndistribution  network  is  strengthened.  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  national  electrification  ratio 2  improved \nsignificantly  from  10.9%  in  1986  to  82%  in  2008  and  compares  favorably  with  those  in  other \nSouth Asian countries. However, substantial disparities in access to electricity still exist. As of \nthe end of 2008, per capita electricity consumption was about 492 kilowatt-hours (kWh), lower \nthan  in  India  and  Pakistan.  System  losses  are  estimated  at  15%.  While  this  is  relatively  low \ncompared to the average of  South Asia, there is still room to reduce losses by another 4%\u20135%.  \n \n3. \nthe  grid  was  \n2,580  megawatts  (MW)  at  the  end  of  2008.  Of  the  total  energy  provided  to  the  grid,  37.4%  is \nhydropower,  58.2%  is  thermal  (oil),  and  4.4%  is  nonconventional  renewable  energy.  Ceylon \nElectricity Board (CEB) and Lanka Electricity Company (LECO) are the only two utilities in the \npower  sector.  CEB,  an  integrated  utility  fully  owned  by  the  Government  and  engaged  in  the \ngeneration,  transmission  and  distribution  of  electricity,  has  an  installed  generation  capacity  of \n1,725  MW,  serving  about  90%  of  all  customers.  LECO  was  formed  as  a  distribution  company \nunder  the  Companies  Act  and  most  of  its  shares  are  owned  by  CEB  and  the  Government. \nMunicipal  authorities  are  minority  shareholders.  LECO  purchases  bulk  power  from  CEB  and \ndistributes it to about 400,000 consumers in other urban areas in the western and coastal belt, \nrepresenting about 10% of all consumers. The private sector is currently only in the generation \nsector and has a total capacity of 705 MW. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\ntotal  power  generation  capacity  available \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n1. \n\nKey Problems \n\n \nIn  Sri  Lanka,  electricity  is  expensive  and  subject  to  interruptions.  About  20%  of \n4. \nhouseholds do not have access to it. CEB is burdened by debt, restricting its capacity to make \ncapital investments and discouraging private investment.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1 Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility \n2 The ratio of electrified households to total households.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nHigh Cost of Generation. The share of thermal power in the power generation mix has \n5. \nincreased  dramatically  from  1%  in  1986  to  58%  in  2008  as  the  entire  growth  in  demand  has \nbeen  served  by  oil-fired  thermal  generation.  The  1998  policy  of  building  thermal  power  plants \nwith private financing has resulted in a proliferation of relatively small high-cost oil-fired plants. \nPolitical  decisions  and lack  of  financial  resources  have  prevented  CEB  from  implementing  the \nleast-cost generation plan, which is to use coal as it is the most economic source of energy. The \nmove toward oil-fired plants, the increase in the oil price, and the delayed construction of new \nhydropower plants have significantly pushed up the cost of generation. There is an urgent need \nto  build  up  base-load  generation  capacity  with  low-cost  fuels  such  as  imported  coal  and  to \ninvest in hydropower and other renewable resources. \n \n6. \n Skewed  Tariff  Structure.  The  dramatic  increase  in  generation  costs  since  1998  has \nnot been passed on to electricity consumers since the Government, as the regulator, has had \nneither the political will to pass on the cost increases to consumers nor the technical capacity to \nevaluate the CEB\u2019s cost structure to decide on the appropriate level of tariffs. As a result, CEB \nhas  posted  an  operating  loss  since  2000  and  accumulated  its  liability.  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  electricity \ncustomers, particularly commercial and industrial customers and large households, pay higher \nprices  than  most  of  their  regional  comparators.  A  reduction  in  the  cost  of  supply  is  urgently \nneeded, coupled with a stable and high-quality supply of electricity. \n \nInadequate  and  Aging  Transmission  and  Distribution  Network.  Retail tariffs, which \n7. \ndo not reflect the cost of supply, coupled with delays in project implementation, have continued \nto squeeze its investments in transmission and distribution. The low-voltage distribution network \nrequires improvements if it is to meet the expansion in housing and commercial developments. \nOverdue  investment  in  the  medium-voltage  distribution  network  has  caused  overloading,  poor \nreliability and fluctuating voltage at many locations. The growth in demand for power distributed \nover  the  medium-voltage  network  requires  a  matching  investment  in  the  transmission  network \nand  grid  substations.  Immediate  investments  in  the  transmission  and  distribution  network  are \nneeded, not only to reduce system losses and to ensure the stability of the entire power system, \nbut also to encourage private sector investment in nonconventional renewable energy.   \n \n \n8. \nHigh Commercial Losses and Lack of Penetration in Rural Areas. The low customer \ndensity  in  suburban  and  rural  areas  causes  higher  network  losses  than  in  urban  areas.  In \nparallel with network strengthening, further efforts are needed to upgrade and improve meters \nand  metering  systems  and  to  enforce  strict  surveillance  to  prevent  theft.  Another  major \nchallenge in rural areas is low penetration in electrified villages. Even in neighborhoods already \nreached by distribution feeders, many households remain unconnected as they cannot afford to \npay connection charges.   \n   \n\n2. \n\nGovernment Policy and Planning Framework \n\n \n9. \nThe  Government\u2019s  Ten-Year  Development  Framework  (TYDF)  prepared  in  2006 \nenvisions  \u201csustainable  development  of  energy  resources,  conversion  facilities  and  delivery \nsystems to enable access to and use of energy services by the entire population, and the safe, \nreliable delivery of such energy services at a regionally competitive price, through commercially \nviable  institution  subjected  independent  regulation.\u201d3 To  underpin  the  TYDF,  the  Government \ndeveloped  the  national  energy  policy  and  strategies  (NEPS),  a  comprehensive  sector \ndevelopment  road  map,  including  a  long-term  investment  program  and  policy  and  reform \nmeasures. It aims to (i) supply electricity to 86% of households by 2010 and 98% by 2016, and \n\n                                                 \n3  Government of Sri Lanka. 2006.

Colombo. p. 63. \n\n\f(ii)  adopt  electricity  tariffs  that  are  comparable  with  those  of  other  countries  and  sufficient  for \nutilities to be viable. The Government gazetted the NEPS in June 2008.  \n \n\n3. \n\nSector Road Map \n\n \n10. \nLong-Term  Generation  Expansion  Plan  (LGEP).  In  the  short  term,  generation  costs \nare expected to continue to increase, reflecting oil prices and the commissioning of the oil-fired \nKerawalapitiya Thermal Power Station (300 MW). In the medium term, the Government aims to \nreverse this trend by adding three coal-fired plants, one hydropower plant, and an additional 500 \nMW  of  renewable  energy.  The  Government  has  imposed  a  moratorium  on  oil-burning  power \nplants  until  non-oil  sources  provide  90%  of  the  grid  energy.  The  Government  is  actively \npromoting  private  sector  investment  in  coal-fired  thermal  power,  medium-scale  conventional \nhydropower,  and  renewable  energy  projects.  Planned  generation  capacity  addition  under  the \nLGEP is provided in Table 1.   \n \n\nTable 1: Generation Capacity Addition Plan \n(MW) \n\nItem \n\nFY2008 \n\nFY2012 \n\nFY2016 \n\nSupply \nThermal (Oil) \nThermal (Coal) \nConventional Hydropower \nRenewable \n         Total \nPeak Demand \n\n \n      1,222 \n 0 \n1,205 \n   153 \n2,580 \n1,922 \n\n \n      1,768 \n   900 \n      1,335 \n   317 \n4,320 \n2,921 \n\n \n     1,393 \n     2,100 \n1,335 \n   622 \n5,450 \n3,943 \n\n                   Source: Government of Sri Lanka. \n \nEnabling  Regulatory  Environment  and  Sector  Reforms.  The  Government \n11. \nestablished  the  Public  Utilities  Commission  of  Sri  Lanka  (PUCSL)  in  2002  as  a  regulator  for \nenergy  and  water  sectors  under  the  PUCSL  Act  2002.  The  Electricity  Reform  Act,  2002,  was \nintroduced to empower PUCSL to issue licenses and determine electricity tariffs. However, the \nact did not become fully effective because of the failure of the previous sector reform program \nand  PUCSL  has  been  only  advising  the  Government  on  policy  decisions,  including  tariff \nsettings.  To  complete  the  regulatory  reform,  the  Sri  Lanka  Electricity  Act  was  passed  by \nParliament in March 2009 to replace the Electricity Reform Act.  \n \n12. \nCEB  Corporate  Plan  and  Functional  Business  Unit.  CEB  has  converted  its \ngeneration,  transmission,  and  distribution  operations  into  six  functional  business  units  (FBUs) \n(one  for  generation,  one  for  transmission,  and  four  for  distribution).  Financial  accounts  have \nbeen segregated so that each FBU will operate as a profit center. CEB has developed a long-\nterm corporate plan that sets strategic objectives for each FBU based on a corporate vision and \ngoals.  The  corporate  plan  will  be  a  basis  for  its  internal  reform  exercise.  The  performance  of \neach FBU will be measured by key performance indicators to be identified under the corporate \nplan. Performance of each FBU will also be monitored by PUCSL through its conditions to grant \nlicenses to CEB. The corporate plan will also identify those functions that will be decentralized \nto the FBU level and those that will be centralized at the corporate level. A summary of the draft \ncorporate plan is in Supplementary Appendix A. Government approval of CEB\u2019s corporate plan \nin  a  form  that  is  acceptable  to  ADB  is  a  condition  of  effectiveness  of  each  Loan  and  Grant \nagreement. \n    \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\fClean  Energy  Development.  The  country\u2019s  primary  energy  sources  are  indigenous \n13. \nbiomass (47% of the total in 2003), imported petroleum products (45% in 2003) and hydropower \n(8% in 2003). About half of the country\u2019s hydropower potential has already been exhausted. Sri \nLanka\u2019s  limited  options  are  therefore  more  use  of  indigenous  resources,  less  consumption  of \nfossil  fuels,  and  diversification  into  cheaper  fuels.  At  the  end  of  2008,  there  were  73  small \nhydropower plants of 138 MW, one wind power plant of 3 MW, and three biomass plants of 12 \nMW. It is estimated that the country has technical potential for 24,000 MW of renewable energy \nincluding  biomass,  wind  and  small  hydropower  plants.  The  TYDF  aims  to  (i)  increase  the \npercentage of households electrified through the off-grid supply from 4% at present to 10% by \n2016; (ii) increase the share of nonconventional renewable energy in the on-grid power supply \nfrom 4.1% at present to 10.7%; and (iii) add at least 500 MW of renewable energy capacity by \n2016. Table 2 shows Sri Lanka\u2019s renewable energy development plan to FY2016. \n \n\nTable 2: Renewable Energy Development Plan \n(MW) \n\nItem \n\nFY2008 \n\nFY2012 \n\nFY2016 \n\nBiomass \nSmall Hydropower \nWind \nTotal \n\n12 \n138 \n3  \n153 \n\n20 \n219 \n78 \n317 \n\n50 \n419 \n153 \n622 \n\n                        Source: Sustainable Energy Authority. \n \n14. \nIn October 2007, the Government established the Sustainable Energy Authority (SEA), a \nfocal  agency  mandated  to  develop  and  implement  national  policy  for  renewable  energy \ndevelopment, energy efficiency improvements, and energy conservation. It also introduced new \ntechnology-specific  multi-tier  tariffs  to  attract  more  private  investment  to  nonconventional \nrenewable energy projects. Although these initiatives have created an institutional framework to \npromote the development of renewable energy projects, lack of grid capacity remains a major \ntechnical bottleneck for clean energy development through private sector investment.  \n \n15. \nTransmission and Distribution Network Development. CEB completed a master plan \nstudy for the development of the transmission system in Sri Lanka in 2006 and prepared a long-\nterm  transmission  development  plan  (LTDP)  until  2015.  LTDP  has  identified  significant \ninvestment needs in the transmission system to (i) evacuate power generated from new power \nplants  planned  under  the  LGEP;  (ii)  improve  overall  system  reliability  and  efficiency;  \n(iii) facilitate rural electrification; and (iv) facilitate grid integration of renewable energy projects. \nIn  2008,  the  transmission  and  distribution  loss  was  estimated  to  be  15%  of  net  generation. \nThese  losses  are  partly  technical,  e.g.,  overheating  cables  and  transformers,  because  of  the \nexcessive  current  caused  by  the  unplanned  connection  of  new  customers,  and  by  the  non-\nimplementation  of  planned  improvements  to  the  network  because  of  financial  constraints.  The \nGovernment  aims  to  reduce  the  overall  losses  to  12%  by  2016  by  accelerating  the \nstrengthening  of  the  transmission  and  distribution  network.  The  Government  will  also  make  a \nparallel effort to upgrade and improve the meters and the metering system, and to strengthen \nsurveillance to prevent theft, especially in suburban and rural areas.  \n \n16. \nRural  Electrification.  By  the  end  of  2008,  82%  of  total  households  had  electricity \nconnections. Most of those without access to electricity lived in rural areas. The Government is \ncommitted to an interim target of 86% by 2010 and an ultimate target of 98% (88% on-grid and \n10% off-grid) by 2016. While some areas can be electrified by closing the gaps in the existing \nnetwork,  most  villages  yet  to  be  electrified  require  off-grid  electricity  services.  Another  major \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fchallenge  in  suburban  and  rural  areas  is  low  penetration  in  electrified  villages.  Even  though \ndistribution feeders have reached their neighborhood, many households remain unconnected as \nthey cannot afford to pay connection charges. To reduce this financial burden, the Government \nplans to expand a credit support program piloted by an ADB-funded project.4 \n \n17. \nDemand-Side  Management. The SEA is mandated to develop and implement policies \nto  reduce  consumption  and  achieve  better  energy  efficiency  in  residential,  municipal  and \nindustrial users. The Government has identified eight priority areas: (i) power factor correction in \ntransmission  networks,  (ii)  efficiency  improvements  in  lighting  applications  in  residential  and \ncommercial  buildings  and  lighting  grids,  (iii)  industrial  boilers,  (iv)  air-conditioning  systems,  \n(v) compressed air systems, (vi) industrial motors and drives, (vii) fans and air blow installations, \nand (viii) municipal water and irrigation pumps and lighting systems. The Government also plans \nto  promote  compact  fluorescent  lamps  (CFLs)  and  introduced  mandatory  labeling  in  2007.  It \nplans to complete the program by 2010. In addition, the Government is preparing to update the \nCFL program and to introduce a mandatory energy efficiency building code.  \n \nDebt  Restructuring  and  Tariff  Rationalization.  In  2005,  the  Government  wrote  off \n18. \nSLRs7.8  billion  of  CEB\u2019s  deferred  tax  and  other  payment  arrears  to  the  Treasury  and  made \ndirect payments of SLRs3.5 billion to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation on behalf of CEB. The \nrestructuring plan for CEB\u2019s long-term debt of SLRs61 billion was approved by the Government \nin April 2006. Half of the long-term liabilities have been converted to equity and half have been \nrescheduled. At the end of 2008, CEB has a total long-term liability of SLRs 31 billion.  \n \n19. \n To  ensure  electricity  prices  reflect  the  cost  of  supply  and  improve  revenues,  the \nGovernment has rationalized the tariff structure so that all the recurrent expenses of CEB will be \nmet by the tariffs. In March 2008, the Government introduced a new tariff structure increasing \naverage retail tariffs by about 30%. The increases will mainly affect domestic consumers, who \nhave  been  heavily  cross-subsidized  by  commercial  and  industrial  consumers.  However,  the \nimpact on \u201clifeline tariffs,\u201d considered necessary to maintain minimum living standards, has been \nminimized. Consumers with high domestic consumption have higher tariffs than those with low \nconsumption. A fuel surcharge now applies to all consumers. This is a significant change, and \ngives the domestic consumer greater incentives to save energy. Under the Sri Lanka Electricity \nAct, all tariffs must reflect costs; the costs of any subsidy approved by the Government will be \nborne by the Treasury.      \n  \n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector and ADB Strategy  \n\n \n20. \nADB,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  and  the  World  Bank  have  been \nthe main development partners in the Sri Lanka power sector. The three institutions coordinated \nclosely  on  key  policy  issues  and  investment  support.  JICA  has  been  the  largest  development \npartner in the sector, providing investment support for generation, transmission, and distribution. \nJointly with JICA, ADB provided a program loan5 for sector reforms and have jointly undertaken \npolicy dialogue with the Government. JICA has been active in the generation subsector and is \ncurrently funding the Upper Kotomale hydropower plant (150 MW) and a feasibility study for the \nuse of imported LNG for power generation. The World Bank has provided a line of credit for off-\ngrid  electrification  by  the  private  sector.    Recently,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB. 2004. Proposed Grant Assistance to Sri Lanka for the Power Fund for the Poor. Manila (financed by Japan \n\nFund for Poverty Reduction). \n\n5   ADB.  2002.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Power Sector Development Program. Manila. \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nIndia have emerged as major development partners for the sector. A new coal-fired base load \npower plant of 300 MW is under construction, funded by the PRC. A 500 MW coal-fired plant is \nplanned in Trincomalee as a joint venture between India and Sri Lanka.  \n \nADB\u2019s  power  sector  strategies  in  Sri  Lanka  are  aligned  with  the  TYDF  and  aim  to \n21. \nimprove the coverage and efficiency of the services delivery by CEB and LECO by (i) increasing \nnonconventional  energy  sources;  (ii) \nimproving  energy  efficiency;  (iii)  promoting  rural \nelectrification;  (iv)  strengthening  sector  regulation;  and  (v)  supporting  CEB\u2019s  internal  reforms.  \nADB\u2019s activities will focus on (i) climate change mitigation; (ii) strengthening sector governance; \n(iii) improving access for the poor; and (iv) private sector participation. \n \n\n5. \n\nLessons \n\n \n22. \nIn 1998, the Government committed itself to carrying out sector reforms and embarked \non  a  program  to  restructure  the  power  sector  by  unbundling  CEB  into  separate  functional \ncompanies  and  establishing  an  independent  regulator.  The  Government  introduced  the \nElectricity  Reform  Act,  2002  to  provide  a  legal  framework  for  the  program.  However,  the \nunbundling of CEB did not materialize because of opposition from within the ruling coalition and \nfrom  the  powerful  labor  unions.  As  the  act  was  designed  to  enable  PUCSL  to  start  regulation \nfollowing the unbundling of CEB, regulatory reform has been at a standstill. As a result, in 2006 \nADB  terminated  the  program  loans  to  support  the  reform  program  as  the  second  tranche \nconditions were unlikely to be fulfilled.     \n \n23. \nThe  main  reason  the  previous  reform  program  did  not  succeed  was  that  a  CEB  trade \nunion  backed  by  a  leftist  party  protested  against  the  reform.  Since  the  leftist  party  was  a \nmember  of  the  ruling  coalition,  the  Government  made  a  political  choice  not  to  unbundle  CEB. \nSome members of the Government and CEB who believed that the most pressing need was to \nbuild  a  cheaper  base  load  capacity  rather  than  to  carry  out  reform  also  influenced  the \nGovernment  decision.  Some  stakeholders  also  perceived  the  reform  process  to  be  donor-\ndriven. \n \n24. \nBased  on  the  lessons  learned  from  the  previous  reform  attempt,  ADB  encouraged  the \nGovernment to conduct intensive consultations with stakeholders when preparing a fresh sector \ndevelopment program. The Government prepared the NEPS and had it approved by Parliament \nto  ensure  ownership  by  all  political  stakeholders.  The  Government  has  taken  a  pragmatic \napproach to this round of regulatory reform and as a result has faced less political resistance.  It \nleft  CEB  vertically  integrated  and  delinked  regulatory  reform  from  the  restructuring  of  CEB.  It \ndecided  to  introduce  the  Sri  Lanka  Electricity  Act,  designed  to  encourage  efficiency \nimprovement  by  CEB  by  regulating  each  FBU.  Recognizing  these  policy  actions  as  a  strong \nindication of the Government\u2019s commitment to reform, ADB resumed its support for the power \nsector  by  approving  a  TA  project6 in  December  2007  and  a  country  operations  business  plan \nwhich includes the current Project.  The Sri Lanka Electricity Act was passed by Parliament in \nMarch 2009 to complete the regulatory reform. \n   \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB.  2007.

The details of each investment part are provided \nin Appendix 4.   \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features  \n\nClimate Change Mitigation \n\n1. \n \n\na. \nDevelopment \n\nSupport  for  Private  Sector  Participation  in  Small  Hydropower \n\n \nIn  Sri  Lanka,  the  private  sector  has  been  active  in  investing  in  small  hydropower \n27. \nstations.  So  far,  73  projects  with  total  capacity  of  138  MW  have  been  developed  by  private \ninvestors.  However,  because  of  lack  of  substation  capacity,  40  new  proposals  with  a  total \ncapacity  of  105  MW  remain  pending.  To  remove  this  bottleneck,  the  Project  will  finance  the \nimprovement and construction of six substations, which will absorb an additional 200 MW from \nnew small hydropower plants. This will help reduce CO2 equivalent emissions by about 500,000 \ntons per year. \n \n\nb. \n\nCapacity Development for Renewable Energy Development \n\n  \n28. \nAn  appropriate  policy  and  regulatory  framework  is  critical  to  promoting  private  sector \nparticipation in renewable energy. ADB has approved technical assistance for capacity building \nof  the  SEA,  a  focal  agency  responsible  for  nationwide  planning  of  renewable  energy \ndevelopment and approval of individual projects (footnote 6). PUCSL will also play a pivotal role \nthrough licensing and tariff setting. Since 2002, ADB has been actively involved in establishing \nPUCSL and has provided technical assistance to develop regulatory rules and codes.  Together \nwith  the  capacity  building  support  for  PUCSL  under  the  Project,  ADB  will  support  renewable \nenergy development from policy, regulatory and investment perspectives.      \n \n\nc.  \n\nEnergy Efficiency Improvement through Innovative Approaches \n\n \n29. \nThe  Project  is  designed  to  promote  demand-side  management  through  an  innovative \nenergy  service  company  (ESCO)  model. 7 Management  contracts  for  implementation  of  the \n                                                 \n7   The ESCO model is a business model under which the ESCO provides for investments and installs energy-saving \nequipment  in  industrial,  municipal  or  residential  facilities,  which  become  the  ESCO\u2019s  clients.  The  ESCO  client \nfurnishes  the  repayment  toward  the  investment  from  the  cost  savings  realized  due  to  the  reduced  electricity \nconsumption.  \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\fdemand-side management part will be handled by utility ESCO units to be set up in CEB and \nLECO. The realized energy savings will be deposited in the ESCO\u2019s escrow accounts and used \nto finance further energy efficiency projects in CEB and LECO service areas. The ESCO service \nmarket is still quite immature in Sri Lanka, and requires further strengthening and support from \nthe  donor  community.  The  utility  ESCO  model  will  be  more  appropriate  for  initiating  demand-\nside  management  programs  for  customers  with  capital  shortages,  such  as  municipal \ngovernments.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSector Governance \n\n \n30. \nSince 2006, ADB has been conducting an intensive policy dialogue with the Government \nto strengthen sector governance. With a new  regulatory regime launched under the Sri Lanka \nElectricity Act, ADB will redirect its support from development of the regulatory framework to its \nimplementation.  To  ensure  effective  regulation,  capacity  development  of  PUCSL  and  CEB  will \nbe critical. The Project will provide associated technical assistance to (i) help PUCSL conduct a \nlicensing and tariff review; (ii) support CEB to prepare licensing applications and tariff petitions; \n(iii)  facilitate  interaction  between  PUCSL  and  CEB;  and  (iv)  support  implementation  of  CEB\u2019s \ncorporate plan.  \n \n 3. \n\nScaling-Up Access for the Poor  \n\n \n31. \nIn Sri Lanka, many households remain unconnected because they cannot afford to pay \nconnection charges even though distribution feeders have already reached their neighborhood. \nHowever,  some  of  these  households  may  have  the  capacity  to  repay  a  loan  or  to  pay  the \nconnection charges in monthly installments over 2\u20133 years. To address this issue, in 2004, ADB \napproved a microfinance scheme funded by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction\u2014the Power \nFund  for  the  Poor  (footnote  4).  The  fund  has  been  successfully  implemented  by  two \nparticipating credit institutions in collaboration with CEB and a local organization specializing in \nthe energy sector and has electrified more than 10,000 poor households in eight districts while \nmaintaining a recovery ratio of more than 95%. As evidenced by the high recovery ratio, target \nhouseholds  are  able  to  pay  once  they  get  connected,  with  technical  and  institutional  support \nfrom  the  organizations  involved.  The  Project  aims  to  scale-up  the  fund  through  a  loan-funded \ncredit support program and is expected to provide electricity connection to at least 60,000 poor \nhouseholds, including those living in areas affected by conflict. This represents 8% of the total \nnumber  of  poor  households.  This  will  provide  significant  support  to  the  achievement  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  goal  of  increasing  the  household  electrification  ratio  through  grid  connections \nfrom the present 82% to 88% by 2016. \n \n\n4. \n\nDevelopment of Conflict-Affected Areas \n\n \n 32.  Some parts of the Project will be implemented in Eastern Province, which has long been \nneglected  by  major  public  investments.  It  has  a  history  of  political,  economic,  and  security \ninstability over the last 3 decades, mainly because of the conflict between the Government and \nthe  Liberation  Tigers  of  Tamil  Eelam.  Its  population  is  41%  Tamil,  32%  Muslim,  and  27% \nSinhalese. Since securing the province and declaring it safe in July 2007, the Government has \nembarked on a \u201cReawakening the East\u201d program to integrate the province into the mainstream \neconomy. The Government held council elections in the province on 10 May 2008, which were \nkeenly contested by all the major parties. The elections were the first for 20 years. The access \nfor  the  poor  component  is  in  line  with  the  government\u2019s  overall  strategies  on  regional \ndevelopment,  poverty  reduction,  and  ethnic  integration  and  will  benefit  all  communities  in  the \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fprovince.  It  will  improve  CEB\u2019s  capacity  to  cater  to  the  expected  increase  in  the  province\u2019s \nhousehold and industrial demand.  \n  \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan and Cost Estimates \n\n33. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $188.2 million, including taxes and duties of \n$3.8 million. It consists of $147 million in foreign exchange costs and $41.2 million in equivalent \nlocal  costs.  The  total  cost  includes  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  interest  and  other \ncharges during implementation. A detailed cost estimate is provided in Appendix 5. \n \n\nTable 3: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nAmounta\n \n\n \nBase Cost \nEnergy Efficiency Improvement \nPart 1  System Control Modernization  \nPart 2  Transmission System Strengthening \nPart 3  Distribution Substations Augmentation   \nPart 4  Demand-Side Management for Municipal Street Lighting   \nPart 5  Consulting Services for System Control Modernization \nRenewable Energy Development  \nPart 6  Network Capacity Augmentation for Renewable Energy Projects  \nAccess for the Poor \nPart 7  Transmission System Strengthening in the Eastern Province   \nPart 8  Rural Household Connection  \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB. \nC. \nD. \n \na \nb   Physical contingencies computed at 8%.

Part 4 will be jointly funded by two separate grants, one for $2.2 \nmillion from the Climate Change Fund and one for  $2 million from the Government of Japan.8 \nDisbursement for part 4 will be made from the two funding sources on a pro-rata basis. ADB will \nnot finance tax and duties or financing charges.  \n \n35. \nThe OCR loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \n                                                 \n8 Through the Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, and administered by \nADB.  Allocation  of  the  fund  between  CEB  and  LECO  will  decided  by  ADB  based  on  project  preparedness  and \nprogress by each agency.    \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n\ffacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the \ndraft loan and project agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for \nits decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. $114.4 million of the OCR loan will \nbe relent to CEB for Parts 1,2,5,6 and 7 and $20.6 million to LECO for Part 3 under a subsidiary \nfinancing  agreements  between  the  Government  and  CEB  and  LECO,  on  terms  satisfactory  to \nADB.   \n \n36. \nThe ADF loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years and an \ninterest change of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The \nportion  of  the  ADF  loan  intended  for  part  7  (SDR  14,485,000)  will  be  relent  to  CEB,  and  the \nbalance (SDR 2,358,000) for part 8 will be transferred by the Government to CEB as a grant.  \nRelending of the proceeds of the ADF loan to CEB as loan and grant will be under a subsidiary \nfinancing  agreement  between  the  Government  and  CEB,  on  terms  satisfactory  to  ADB.

LECO  shall,  jointly  with  CEB, \nimplement parts 3 and 4 (distribution substations augmentation and demand-side management \nparts).  Day-to-day  project  implementation  will  be  done  by  project  implementation  units  (PIUs), \nwhich will be set up in CEB and LECO. These will work exclusively for the Project and will be \nheaded  by  senior  officers.    The  organizational  structure  of  the  PIUs  is  described  in \nSupplementary Appendix C. Full-time project managers and supervisors with qualified staff will \nbe  appointed  to  supervise  each  part.  The  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project \nimplementation,  including  procurement,  accounting,  and  social  and  environmental  issues  and \ncoordination with concerned agencies. In addition, the CEB\u2019s PIU will coordinate closely with the \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fprocurement committee, which will be appointed by the cabinet or MOPE depending on the size \nof contracts. \n \n38. \nDistribution  Substations  Augmentation  Part.  This  will  be  implemented  initially  by \nLECO,  and  subsequently  by  CEB  who  will  take  over  the  project  assets  and  associated \nsubsidiary debt from LECO and undertake operation and maintenance.  \n \n39. \nDemand-Side Management Part.  This will be implemented by both CEB and LECO in \ntheir  respective  jurisdictions.9 MOPE  will  issue  a  policy  circular  to  delegate  responsibility  for \nmunicipal  street  lighting  in  selected  areas  from  municipal  authorities  to  CEB  and  LECO.  With \nthe  associated  ADB  technical  assistance,  they  will  then  establish  internal  ESCO  units  within \nwhich  escrow  accounts  will  be  established  to  accumulate  energy  savings  gains.  Upon \ncompletion of the payback period of the initial investments by the ESCO units, energy savings \nwill  create  an  additional  revenue  stream  to  that  generated  by  tariffs.  It  is  envisioned  that  a \npercentage of the energy savings gains accumulated in the escrow account will be reinvested in \nother  energy  efficiency  projects  identified  by  the  ESCO  unit  as  part  of  its  operational \nresponsibilities.  Appendix  6  contains  a  description  of  the  demand-side  management  part  and \nAppendix 10 a description of the associated TA.  \n \n40. \nRural Household Connection Part. This will be implemented by CEB with the support \nof  service  providers  engaged  under  a  performance-based  contract  on  terms  and  conditions \nacceptable to ADB.  When a credit application is submitted to CEB from a customer household, \na  service  provider  will  assess  the  household\u2019s  repayment  capacity  and  CEB  will  confirm  that \nthere  are  no  technical  difficulties  in  making  the  electricity  connection.  If  the  application  is \napproved, CEB will provide the service connection, the cost of which will be recorded as a loan \nto the customer in CEB\u2019s balance sheet and recovered in installments over 24\u201336 months. An \nescrow  account  will  be  set  up  in  CEB  to  receive  installment  payments.  Principal  and  interest \npayments from households will be credited to the account and used to provide new installment \ncredits.  ADB  will  provide  associated  technical  assistance  for  the  detailed  design  of  this  part, \nincluding selection of service providers and capacity building of major stakeholders. Appendix 7 \ncontains a description of the rural household connection part and Appendix 10 a description of \nthe associated TA.  \n \n\nImplementation Period \n\n2. \n \n41. \n All parts except for the rural household connection part are expected to be completed \nby May 2013. For the rural household connection part, the loan is expected to be fully disbursed \nwithin  3  years  and  repayments  from  consumers  will  be  revolved  for  new  service  connections. \nThe implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 8.    \n \n\nProcurement \n\n3. \n \n42. \n Procurement of goods and services to be financed under the loans will be carried out in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All \nprocurement  packages  except  for  part  4  (demand-side  management)  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures.  Shopping  procedures  will \nbe used for part 4 (demand-side management) for procurement of standard specification goods \n\n                                                 \n9 As defined by CEB Act No. 17 of 1969 and the memorandum of association of Lanka Electricity Company (Private) \nestablished in 1983 under the Companies Act. In power distribution, LECO supplies power to Colombo and other \nurban areas in the western and coastal belt while CEB covers the remainder of the country.  \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nwith  estimated  costs  of  less  than  $100,000.  A  procurement  plan  and  indicative  contract \npackages are in Appendix 9. Any modifications to the procurement plan will be subject to prior \napproval by ADB. \n \n\n4. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n43. \nCEB  and  LECO  have  requested  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  for  the \nprocurement  of  goods  up  to  20%  of  the  cumulative  total  of  the  OCR  and  ADF  loans.  ADB \nManagement has approved retroactive financing for all subprojects except for the demand-side \nmanagement subproject up to 20% of the proceeds from the loans, provided that expenditures \nare in accordance with the Procurement Guidelines and safeguard policies, and were incurred \nduring the 12 months before the signing of the corresponding individual loan agreement. CEB \nand LECO were informed that approval of advance contracting or retroactive financing did not \ncommit  ADB  to  finance  the  Project.  The  readiness  of  the  investment  parts  is  provided  in \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n5. \n \n44. \nFor  implementation  of  part  1  (system  control  modernization),  loan-funded  consulting \nservices  will  be  provided  under  part  5  to  support  CEB  in  conducting  procurement  and \nconstruction supervision and also, on an intermittent basis, for operation and maintenance and \nliability issues during the defect liability period (12 months after commissioning). CEB will select \nand engage consultants using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) procedures at a \nquality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20 and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time), using the full technical proposal method. Outline terms of \nreference  for  the  consulting  services  are  provided  in  Supplementary  Appendix  J.  About  22 \nperson-months of international and 3 person-months of national consultants are expected to be \nrequired.  \n \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n6. \n \n45. \n ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  Government,  CEB,  and  LECO.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  IAs  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and \nother  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.

Imprest  fund  procedures  will  be  used  to  facilitate \ndisbursement for part 8 while a commitment letter and direct payment procedures will be used \nfor  parts  1,  2,  3,  5,  6  and  7  and  reimbursement  for  part  4.  One  imprest  account  will  be \nestablished for part 8. The ceiling of the initial advance of the imprest account will not exceed \nADB\u2019s  estimated  share  of  eligible  project  expenditures  to  be  financed  through  the  imprest \naccount  for  the  next  6  months,  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount  for  part  8,  whichever  is  lower.  \nStatement of expenditure procedures may be used under the reimbursement procedure for part \n4  and  for  liquidating  advances  for  part  8.  The  statement  of  expenditure  ceiling  for  individual \npayments applicable to reimbursement and imprest fund procedures will be $25,000 for part 4 \nand $100,000 for part 8.   \n \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n8. \n \n47. \nThe accounting, auditing, and reporting systems and procedures for the Project will be \nestablished in accordance with accounting principles and practices satisfactory to ADB. The IAs \nwill  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  different  parts.  Within  9  months  of  the  close  of  the \nfinancial  year,  the  IAs  will  submit  (i)  annual  project  accounts,  with  detailed  descriptions  of  the \nsources of receipts and expenditures; and (ii) annual financial statements comprising an income \nstatement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, and related notes to the financial statements \nand  consolidated  for  all  operations.  The  IAs  will  continue  the  current  practice  of  hiring \nindependent  chartered  accountants  acceptable  to  ADB  to  audit  their  financial  statements, \nproject  accounts,  and \nimprest  accounts  and/or  statement  of \nexpenditures.  The  auditors  will  also  prepare  a  memorandum  on  issues  identified  during  the \naudit  process,  to  be  submitted  with  the  respective  reports.  The  auditors  will  be  required  to \nprovide  an  opinion  on  the  IAs\u2019  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  financial  covenants.  For  the  rural \nhousehold  connection  part,  CEB  will  report  to  ADB  every  quarter,  without  limitation,  on  the \n(i)  status  of  the  escrow  account  (until  the  full  loan  amount  is  disbursed);  (ii)  overall  portfolio \n\nthe  procedures \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\n\fperformance; and (iii) the status of processing credit applications. If requested by ADB, CEB will \nprovide ADB with certification that the ADB funds have been used to provide service connection \nand that those who received credit under this project have been physically connected.              \n \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n9. \n \n48. \nThe IAs will prepare progress reports for their respective parts and submit these to ADB \nwithin 30 days from the end of each quarter. Each report will provide (i) a narrative description \nof progress made during the period, (ii) changes in the implementation schedule, (iii) problems \nor difficulties encountered, (iv) the performance of the project implementation consultants, and \n(v) the work to be carried out in the next period. The report will also include summary financial \naccounts  for  the  parts,  consisting  of  project  expenditures  for  the  year  to  date  and  total \nexpenditure to date. Performance will be evaluated based on indicators and targets stipulated in \nthe design and monitoring framework.  \n \n\nProject Review \n\n10. \n \n49. \nADB will field an inception mission within 3 months of loan approval. ADB will review the \nimplementation and operation of the projects based on the quarterly progress reports and meet \nwith the IAs and the Government twice a year to discuss the progress of each part of the Project \nand any changes to implementation arrangements or remedial measures that need to be taken. \nA  midterm  review  will  be  carried  out  2  years  after  loan  effectiveness,  focusing  on  the \nengineering, resettlement, and environmental aspects of the investment program, and reviewing \nthe  financial  status  of  the  IAs.  The  IAs  will  submit  a  project  completion  report  to  ADB  within \n3 months of physical completion of the projects. \n  \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Project will include associated TA grants for advisory assistance to the Government \n50. \nfor  (i)  Capacity  Development  for  Power  Sector  Regulation;  (ii)  Demand-Side  Management  for \nMunicipal Street Lighting; and (iii) Rural Household Connection. The financing plan for the TA \ngrants is in Table 6. \n \n\nTable 6: TA Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nProject \nCapacity Development for Power Sector Regulation \nDemand-Side Management for Municipal Street         \n\nADB \n1.0 (TASF) \n0.8 (CCF) \n\nGovernment \n0.25 \n0.2 \n\nTotal \n1.25 \n1.0 \n\nLighting  \n\nRural Household Connection \nTotal \nCCF = Climate Change Fund, JSF = Japan Special Fund, TASF = Technical Assistance Special Fund. \n\n2.0 (JSF) \n3.8 \n\n0.5 \n0.95 \n\n2.5 \n4.75 \n\n \n51. \nTotal cost of the TA projects is $4.75 million, out of which $3.8 million will be funded by \nADB and $0.95 million by the Government in kind. A summary of the TA projects are provided in \nAppendix 10 and details are in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n52. \nCapacity  Development  for  Power  Sector  Regulation.  The  TA  will  help  deliver \naffordable  and  reliable  electricity  to  Sri  Lankan  consumers  through  effective  regulation  of  the \npower  sector.  The  TA  will  strengthen  the  Government\u2019s  regulation  of  the  sector  through \n(i)  institutional  and  technical  capacity  development  for  PUCSL  so  it  can  effectively  implement \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fregulation  under  the  Sri  Lanka  Electricity  Act  and  (ii)  institutional  and  technical  capacity \ndevelopment for CEB so it can comply with the requirements of the act.  \n \n53. \nDemand-Side  Management  for  Municipal  Street  Lighting.  The  TA  will  support  the \nuse  of  utility  energy  service  company  (ESCO)  units  within  CEB  and  LECO  to  implement  the \ndemand-side management part. The TA will (i) assess the operational and functional structures \nin CEB and LECO to determine the optimal type of ESCO units and define their scope of work \nand  responsibilities;  (ii)  propose  financing  mechanisms  to  fund  the  energy  efficiency  projects \nidentified by the ESCO units; and (iii) assess capacity building needs and develop training and \noutsourcing plans.   \n \n54. \nRural  Household  Connection.  The TA aims to improve electricity access for the poor \nby  supporting  CEB  to  design  a  credit  support  program  for  rural  household  connection,  select \nservice providers, and build the capacity of stakeholders.  \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n55. \nEconomic  analysis  was  undertaken  for  the  Project,  excluding  the  demand-side \nmanagement and rural household connection parts. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \nwas  calculated  by  comparing  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  Detailed  cost  benefit \ncalculations show that the Project is expected to deliver net economic benefits, with a combined \nEIRR of 16.0%. A summary of the economic analysis is provided in Appendix 11. \n \nB. \n\nFinancial Management Assessment and Financial Analysis \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Management \n\n \n \n56. \n A  financial  management  assessment  was  undertaken  to  determine  whether  CEB  and \nLECO  could  fulfill  ADB\u2019s  fiduciary  requirements  for  the  Project.  The  assessment  was  in \naccordance with  ADB  guidelines  and  used  a  financial  management  assessment  questionnaire \nand  field  interviews.  In  CEB,  under  the  general  manager  responsible  for  day-to-day \nmanagement,  additional  general  managers  manage  six  FBUs,  one  generation  unit,  one \ntransmission unit, and four distribution units in different areas. The finance division is headed by \na  finance  manager  and  two  additional  finance  managers  are  responsible  for  financial \nmanagement of the six FBUs.  \n \n57. \nCEB's  accounting  records  are  manually  maintained  at  site  offices  and  monthly \nsummaries  are  forwarded  to  head  office  for  consolidation  under  cost  centers.  For  generation, \ncost  centers  are  aggregated  under  two  hydropower  and  thermal  power  units.  Transmission \nactivities  are  another  cost  center.  There  are  four  separate  cost  centers  for  distribution  by \ngeographic  coverage.  Although  the  billing  system  is  computerized,  the  accounting  system  is \nbased  on  spreadsheets.  Financial  management  and  the  accounting  system  should  be \nintegrated  and  computerized  to  improve  their  efficiency.  To  respond  quickly  to  regulatory \nrequirements and ultimately to customers\u2019 needs, routine financial matters will be delegated to \neach  FBU  while  corporate  financial  matters  such  as  treasury  operations  and  investment \nfinancing  will  be  centralized  at  the  finance  division.  Investment  in  a  more  sophisticated \nmanagement  information  system  and  accounting  system  is  urgently  needed  to  support  the \ndelegation of financial responsibilities to FBUs and to monitor their financial performance.     \n \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nCEB's annual accounts are prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with Sri Lanka \n58. \nAccounting  Standards,  which  are  similar  to  the  International  Accounting  Standards.  The \naccounts are audited by the auditor general, who appoints a private firm as auditor. The firm is \nrotated  periodically.  Since  CEB  has  a  lot  of  experience  in  accounting  and  auditing  for  foreign \nloans that have been relent by the Government, audit reports and financial statements are well \nformatted. \n \n59. \nLECO is a private limited liability company, with the majority of its shares owned by CEB \nand the Government. LECO has finance divisions located at its head office and seven branch \noffices. Each branch office produces a full set of financial statements, which are consolidated at \nthe head office. The head office finance division is headed by the finance manager, assisted by \na  management  accountant,  a  financial  accountant,  and  support  staff.  The  branch  accountants \nreport to the finance manager. LECO\u2019s financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis in \naccordance  with  Sri  Lanka  accounting  standards.  The  accounts  are  audited  by  a  private  firm \naffiliated with an international accounting firm. LECO has experience of implementing externally \nfunded projects and has an internal audit department.  \n \n \n \n60. \nFinancial Analysis of the Project.  A financial evaluation of the Project, excluding the \ndemand-side  management  and  rural  household  connection  parts,  was  carried  out,  based  on \n2009  prices.  The  base  case  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  is  8.5%,  compared  with  a \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  6.9%,  thus  indicating  the  Project  is  financially \nviable.  Sensitivity  analyses  showed  that  the  results  were  robust  to  a  range  of  project-related \nsensitivities. A summary of the financial analysis is provided in Appendix 12. \n \n61. \nFinancial  Analysis  of  CEB.  The  recent  tariff  revision  is  expected  to  improve  CEB's \nturnover  significantly,  coupled  with  a  sharp  decrease  of  oil  prices  due  to  the  global  financial \ncrisis.  Once  the  coal  fired  plant  becomes  operational  in  2012,  CEB's  financial  position  will  be \nmore  stable  because  of  no  need  to  purchase  expensive  power  from  IPPs.  To  ensure  the \nfinancial  sustainability  of  CEB,  the  least  cost  generation  plans  need  to  be  implemented  as \nscheduled. Operationally, CEB should also maintain, (i) an account receivable collection of less \nthan 2 months; (ii) a debt to equity ratio of 70:30; and debt service coverage of 1.2 from 2012. \nCEB\u2019s financial performance and projections are provided in Supplementary Appendix K.  \n \nC. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Development   \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n62. \nThe  Project  will  help  to  enhance  social  and  economic  inclusion  and  the  integration  of \nmarginalized people. On-grid electricity is a cleaner source of energy than kerosene and access \nto  it  will  improve  health,  hygiene,  and  sanitation.  More  hours  can  be  devoted  to  studying  and \naccess to information, awareness, and knowledge will improve. For low-income households, the \neducational level of children will increase. Mobility and security will be enhanced, particularly for \npeople who have suffered from attacks by wild animals while searching for their food10 and who \nhave  been  affected  by  the  conflict. Household  lighting  brings  about  an overall  improvement  in \nliving standards. Electricity is a less expensive source of energy than kerosene and wood that \nneeds  to  be  fetched.  Households  carrying  out  home-based  economic  activities  will  generate \nmore  household  income,  be  more  productive  because  they  can  work  longer  working  hours, \noperate faster machinery, and spend less time searching for energy sources. \n\n                                                 \n10 During  a  field  visit  in  Hambantota  (which  was  electrified  by  the  Power  Fund  for  the  Poor),  it  was  reported  that \n\nelectrification had greatly reduced the risks of villagers being attacked by elephants.   \n\n\f1. \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguards  \n\n \n63. \nIn  urban  areas,  the  Project  will  ensure  a  reliable  supply  of  electricity,  benefiting \nhouseholds, small and medium-sized businesses (possibly leading to job creation), and public \nservices, including schools and hospitals. High oil prices are deterring investors from investing \nin  projects  that  rely  heavily  on  generators.  The  Project  will  bring  power  to  industrial  districts11 \nwhere industries that currently rely on generators will be able to improve their productivity. It will \nalso encourage new investments and therefore create jobs.  \n \n \nThe Project will contribute directly to the development of the Eastern Province, which is \n64. \none of the poorest provinces in Sri Lanka.12 It contains Sinhalese, Tamil, and Muslim population \nand  has  been  severely  affected  by  the  conflict.  The  coastal  part  of  the  province  (populated \nmainly by Tamils and Muslims) was severely affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004.  To \nensure  regional  balance,  the  Project  is  also  designed  to  benefit  other  poorer  provinces.  The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 13.    \n \nD. \n \n \n \n65. \nThe  Project  will  not  entail  any  land  acquisition.  About  480  ha  of  private  land  might  be \ntemporarily affected by the erection of transmission towers and stringing of transmission lines. \nAs  a  result,  a  maximum  of  1,800  households  might  be  temporarily  affected,  although  not \nsignificantly.  As  far  as  possible,  CEB  will  ensure  that  construction  of  towers  and  stringing  of \nlines  will  not  be  carried  out  during  the  cropping  season  to  reduce  the  impact  on  the  local  rice \ncrop.  \n \n66. \nA short resettlement plan has been prepared by CEB for the transmission and substation \nparts  (except  for  part  1,  which  will  not  have  any  adverse  social  impact).  No  direct  impact  is \nforeseen  on  indigenous  peoples  so  no  indigenous  peoples  development  plan  has  been \nprepared. However, special provisions were added to the resettlement plan to ensure additional \ncompensation  is  paid  to  vulnerable  groups,  including  indigenous  peoples.  A  summary \nresettlement plan is provided in Appendix 14. The resettlement plan has been uploaded on the \nADB website and is in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \n \n \nCEB and LECO have prepared initial environmental examinations (IEEs) for parts 1, 2, \n67. \n3,  6,  and  7.  CEB  has  held  public  consultation  meetings.  All  grid  substations  planned  for \naugmentation  are  located  within  the  existing  premises  of  either  CEB  or  LECO.  Minimal \nenvironmental impacts are expected from the siting of new facilities. All grid substations already \nhave  storm  water  drainage  through  covered  surface  drains.  During  the  construction  and \noperation  phase,  measures  will  be  taken  to  minimize  environmental  impacts.  Some  potential \nenvironmental  impacts  associated  with  the  construction  of  the  proposed  132  kV  transmission \nlines are anticipated. To minimize these, CEB has observed the route selection criteria set out in \nIn  general, \nthe  national  regulations  and  has  adopted  best  environmental  practices. \nenvironmental impacts are ranked low or low to medium and have been adequately addressed \nthrough  mitigation  measures  in  the  environmental  management  plans  prepared  for  each \n\nEnvironmental Safeguards \n\n2. \n\n                                                 \n11 One substation to be constructed under the Project will only serve the Pallekelle industrial park, where a number of \n\ninvestments are dependent on the availability of on-grid electricity, which is currently unavailable. \n12 Department of Census and Statistics. 2002. Household Income and Expenditure Survey. Colombo. \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\n\fPotential Risks and Assumptions \n\nsubproject. Both CEB and LECO have sufficient capacity to implement the safeguard measures \nbased  on  the  Plans.  ADB  has  classified  the  Project  environmental  category  B.  The  summary \nIEE is provided in Supplementary Appendix I.  \n \nE. \n \n68. \nThe  major  assumptions  are  that  (i)  the  Government  will  remain  committed  to  power \nsector  reforms;  (ii)  the  long-term  generation  expansion  plan  (LGEP)  will  be  implemented  in  a \ntimely manner; and (iii) the Sri Lanka Electricity Act will be efficiently implemented for PUCSL to \nregulate the sector. \n \n69. \nThe Government\u2019s commitment to sector reform is demonstrated by the fact that it has \n(i) provided financial support for the implementation of CEB\u2019s long-term debt restructuring plan; \n(ii)  submitted  the  NEPS  for  the  parliamentary  approval,  which  is  not  required  for  a  policy \ndocument,  and  gazetted  it;  and  (iii)  substantially  increased  retail  tariffs  to  improve  CEB\u2019s \nfinancial position. CEB has drafted its first long-term corporate plan, which it is using as a basis \nfor  its  internal  reform  exercise.  The Government  has  already  secured  financing  for the  priority \nprojects in LGEP and three projects totaling 950 MW are being implemented. \n \n70. \nParliament  has  passed  the  Sri  Lanka  Electricity  Act  in  March  2009  and  PUCSL  has \nstarted  regulating  the  power  sector.  Although  there  is  a  risk  that  PUCSL  and  CEB  make  lack \ncapacity  to  operate  effectively  under  the  new  regulatory  framework,  this  will  be  substantially \nmitigated  by  ADB\u2019s  technical  assistance  for  capacity  development  of  the  two  agencies  and \nPUCSL\u2019s experience in supporting the Government\u2019s policy-making over the past 4 years.       \n \n71. \nOther  risks  to  the  implementation  of  the  investment  projects  include  (i)  delays  in \nassociated  generation  investments,  (ii)  delays  in  project  implementation  and  resulting  project \ncost escalation, and (iii) a deterioration of the security situation in the Eastern Province. These \nrisks also appear to be low. A policy and regulatory framework is already in place to streamline \nthe Government approval process for renewable energy projects. SEA has been established as \na  focal  agency  for  renewable  energy  development  and  is  being  supported  by  an  ADB  TA  to \nexpedite  the  review  of  the  pending  small  hydropower  projects  that  will  be  promoted  by  the \nProject.  All  the  subprojects  under  the  Project  are  ready  for  implementation  and  advance \nprocurement will help expedite project implementation and mitigate the risk of cost overruns. As \nthe  Government  is  now  taking  full  control  in  the  Eastern  Province,  no  difficulty  is  foreseen  in \nimplementing \ntechnical  assistance  will  help  design \nimplementation arrangement of the projects.    \n \n\nthe  subprojects.  The  associated \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government,  CEB  and  LECO  have  given \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n72. \nthe following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n1. \n\nSector Reforms and Governance \n\n \n73. \n The Government will continue to support commercial and operational autonomy of CEB \nand  LECO,  and  will  ensure  that  they  remain  independent  legal  entities  for  the  duration  of  the \nProject.  \n  \n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe  Government  will  meet  any  shortfall  of  funds,  and  make  timely  and  adequate \n74. \nbudgetary appropriations, in the event adjustments to the tariffs are inadequate to cover in the \nnext Fiscal Year (i) the debt service, (ii) a rate of return agreed upon between PUCSL and CEB, \nand (iii) the full recovery of the investment costs and the operations and maintenance costs of \nthe Project. \n \n75.    The  Government  will  ensure  that  CEB  takes  all  measures  necessary  to  implement  its \nCorporate  Plan,  which  shall  include,  at  the  minimum:  (i)  a  description  of  CEB\u2019s  strategic \nobjectives; (ii) CEB\u2019s operational plan, and (iii) a list of key performance indicators for the FBUs,   \n \n76. \n \n\nThe Government will ensure that CEB: \n\n(i)  within  three  (3)  months  from  the  date  of  effectiveness  of  the  loan  agreement, \ndelegates all power and authority to the FBUs in accordance with the Corporate Plan \nand the local regulations;  \n\n(ii)  within five (5) months from date of effectiveness of the loan agreement, determines \n\nprovisional transfer pricings among the FBUs; and \n\n(iii) within (6) months from the date of effectiveness of the loan agreement,  agrees with \nthe FBUs on target for each of the key performance indicators in accordance with the \nCorporate Plan, and the local regulations.  \n\n \n77.   No later than three (3) months prior to the commencement of each Fiscal Year starting \non 1 January 2010, the Government will cause CEB to provide to ADB an implementation plan \nfor the Corporate Plan satisfactory to ADB for the upcoming Fiscal Year.     \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial \n\n78. \nThe Government will cause CEB to maintain (i) a debt service coverage ratio of at least \n1.2 and a debt-equity ratio of 70:30 for each Fiscal Year commencing 1 January 2012; and (ii) a \nbalance of net accounts receivable not exceeding the equivalent of amounts billed in the two (2) \npreceding months at all times. \n \n79. \nfinancial accounts as if it were a separate legal entity.  \n \n\nThe  Government  will  cause  CEB  to  ensure  that  each  FBU  maintains  separate  internal \n\n3. \n\nOperations  \n\n80. \n In  respect  of  part  8  of  the  project,  the  Government  will  cause  CEB  to  ensure  (i)  a \nminimum  cumulative  principal  collection 13    of  eighty  percent  (80%);  (ii)  a  minimum  annual \nprincipal  and  interest  collection 14    of  eighty  percent  (80%),  and  (iii)  a  maximum  portfolio \ninfection15 of  twenty  percent  (20%).    The  Government  will  ensure  that  CEB\u2019s  annual  auditing \nreport includes an opinion on the compliance by CEB with these conditions  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n13 The cumulative amount of loan principal repaid by customers to CEB divided by cumulative amount of loan   \n\nprincipal due. \n\n14 The  cumulative  amount  of  loan  principal  and  interest  repaid  by  customers  to  CEB  during  a  certain  fiscal  year \n\ndivided by cumulative  amount of loan principal and interest which have become due during the Fiscal Year.  \n\n15  Portion of the portfolio with arrears of six months or older. \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\n\f4. \n\nEnvironment \n\n \n81. \nThe Government will ensure, and cause CEB and LECO to ensure, that (a) the project is \nundertaken  and  all  project  facilities  are  designed,  constructed,  implemented,  operated,  and \nmaintained  in  accordance  with  the  Government's  applicable  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002).  \n \n82. \nThe Government will ensure, and cause CEB and LECO to ensure, that (i) the EMP is \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  its  terms  so  that  all  adverse  environmental  impacts  during \nconstruction  and  operation  of  the  Project  are  mitigated;  and  in  the  event  of  any  unanticipated \nadverse  environmental  impacts,    such  impacts  are  reported  to  CEA  and  ADB,  and  remedial \nactions taken to mitigate the impacts in consultation with the affected people, CEA and ADB; (ii) \nan  additional  environmental  study  is  undertaken  and  corresponding  approval  from  the  CEA  is \nobtained  should  there  be  changes  in  the  Project  design  that  have  significant  environmental \nimpacts;  (iii)  the  IEE  and  EMP  are  updated,  as  necessary,  during  course  of  Project \nimplementation  and  submitted  to  ADB  approval;  and  (iv)  reports  are  submitted  to  ADB  on  a \nsemi-annual basis on the implementation of the EMP. \n \n83. \nThe  Government  will  ensure,  and  cause  CEB  and  LECO  to  ensure,  that  (i)  all \ncontractors are provided with the IEE and EMP, and that the contractors implement the required \nmitigation  measures  as  described  in  the  EMP  in  a  satisfactory  manner,  and  report  the \nimplementation  of  the  EMP  on  a  regular  basis,  along  with  any  deviation  from  the  IEE;  (ii)  the \nbidding  documents  include  the  requirement  to  comply  with  the  EMP;  and  (iii)  the  project \nimplementation  consultants  closely  monitor  compliance  by \nthe \nenvironmental impact mitigation and monitoring requirements.  \n \n\nthe  contractors  with \n\n5. \n\nResettlement \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure,  and  cause  CEB  and  LECO  to  ensure,  that  (i)  land \n84. \nacquisition,  and  relocation,  resettlement,  and  compensation  of  all  people  who  are  affected  by \nthe  project    is  promptly  carried  out,  and  the  project  is  implemented,  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995), \nADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), and the resettlement plan; (ii) all land and rights-of-\nway required for the Project are made available in a timely manner; (iii) the resettlement plan is \ndisclosed  to  the  affected  people  in  local  languages,  and  all  compensation  and  resettlement \nbenefits  are  paid  to  the  affected  people  prior  to  their  displacement  from  their  land,  house,  or \nasset;  (iv)  resettlement  plan  is  updated  as  needed  in  course  of  project  implementation, \nparticularly prior to any realignment, disclosed to the affected people, and submitted to ADB for \napproval and disclosure on ADB's website; (v) the construction of towers and the stringing of the \nlines, is carried out, whenever possible, during off cropping seasons; (vi) an external monitoring \nagency is engaged for independent monitoring and evaluation of resettlement activities; and (vii) \nreports on land acquisition and resettlement, along with the external monitoring agency report, \nare submitted to  ADB semiannually. \n \nB. \n \n85. \nconditions, amongst others: \n \n\nEffectiveness  of  the  Loan  and  Grant  Agreements  will  be  subject  to  the  following \n\nConditions for Effectiveness of Loan and Grant Agreements \n\n(i) \n\nThe MOPE has approved CEB\u2019s Corporate Plan as acceptable to ADB  \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nConditions for Disbursement \n\nC. \n \n86.

Given that demand for power is growing by about 8% \nper  year,  the  country  faces  serious  power  shortages  after  2008,  which  would  significantly \nimpede  economic  growth.  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  national  electrification  ratio1 improved  significantly  from \n10.9% in 1986 to 82% in 2008 and compares favorably to those in other South Asian countries. \nHowever, substantial disparities in access to electricity still exist. As of the end 2008, per capita \nelectricity consumption stood at about 492 kilowatt-hours (kWh), which is lower than that in India \nor Pakistan. System losses are estimated at 16.7%. While this is relatively low compared to the \naverage  of  South  Asia,  there  is  still  room  to  reduce  losses  by  another  4%\u20135%.  Table  A2.1 \nshows key electricity data for four South Asian countries.  \n \n\n \n\nInstalled Generation Capacity (MW) \n\nTable A2.1: Key Electricity Data for Four South Asian Countries \nSri Lanka \n(2008) \n2,580 \n\nBangladesh \n(2005) \n4,995 \n\nPakistan \n(2005) \n19,540 \n\nElectricity Consumption per Capita (kWh) \nSystem Losses (%) \nElectrified Households (%) \n\n492 \n        15.0 \n        82.0 \n\nN/A \n25.0 \n32.0 \n\n398 \n25.0 \n54.0 \n\n      Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIn  Sri  Lanka,  the  total  power  generation  capacity  available  to  the  grid  was  2,580 \n2.  \nmegawatts  (MW)  at  the  end  of  2008.  Of  the  total  energy  provided  to  the  grid,  37.4%  is \nhydropower,  58.2%  is  thermal  (oil),  and  4.4  %  is  nonconventional  renewable  energy.  Ceylon \nElectricity Board (CEB) and Lanka Electricity Company (LECO) are the only two utilities in the \npower  sector.  CEB,  an  integrated  utility  fully  owned  by  the  Government  and  engaged  in \ngeneration, transmission and distribution of electricity, has installed generation capacity of 1,725 \nMW and serves about 90% of all customers. LECO was formed as a distribution company under \nthe Companies Act and most of its shares are owned by CEB and the Government.  Municipal \nauthorities are minority shareholders. LECO purchases bulk power from CEB and distributes it \nto about 400,000 consumers in Colombo and other urban areas in the western and costal belt, \nrepresenting about 10% of all consumers. The private sector is currently only in the generation \nsector and has a total capacity of 705 MW. \n \n \n \n3. \nAbout  20%  of  households  do  not  have  access  to  electricity,  which  is  expensive  and \nsubject  to  interruptions.  CEB  is  burdened  with  debt,  restricting  its  capacity  to  make  capital \ninvestments by CEB and discouraging private investments in the sector.  \n \n4. \nHigh Cost of Generation. The share of thermal power in the power generation mix has \nincreased  dramatically  from  1%  in  1986  to  58%  in  2008  as  the  entire  growth  in  demand  has \nbeen  served  by  oil-fired  thermal  generation.  The  1998  policy  of  building  thermal  power  plants \n                                                 \n1 The ratio of electrified households to total households. \n\n \nKey Issues \n\n \n2.   \n\nIndia \n(2005) \n132,329 \n(Mar 2007) \n606 \n40 \u2013 50 \n44.0 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nwith private financing has resulted in a proliferation of relatively small high-cost oil-fired plants. \nPoor  political  decisions  and  a  lack  of  financial  resources  have  prevented  CEB  from \nimplementing  the  least-cost  generation  plan,  using  coal  as  the  most  economical  source  of \nenergy.  The  move  toward  oil-fired  plants,  the  increase  in  the  oil  price,  and  the  delayed \nconstruction  of  new  hydropower  plants  have  significantly  pushed  up  the  cost  of  generation. \nThere is an urgent need to build up base load generation capacity with low-cost fuels, such as \nimported coal, and to invest in hydropower and other renewable resources.  \n \nSkewed Tariff Structure. The dramatic increase in generation costs since 1998 has not \n5. \nbeen  passed  on  to  electricity  consumers  since  the  Government,  as  the  regulator,  has  had \nneither the political will to pass on the cost increases to consumers nor the technical capacity to \nevaluate the CEB\u2019s cost structure to decide on the appropriate level of tariffs. As a result, CEB \nhas  posted  an  operating  loss  since  2000  and  accumulated  its  liability.  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  electricity \ncustomers, particularly commercial and industrial customers and large households, pay higher \nprices  than  most  of  their  regional  comparators.  A  reduction  in  the  cost  of  supply  is  urgently \nneeded, coupled with a stable and high-quality supply of electricity. \n \n6. \nInadequate  and  Aging  Transmission  and  Distribution  Network.  Retail tariffs, which \ndo  not  reflect  the  cost  of  supply,  coupled  with  CEB\u2019s  institutional  weakness  in  project \nimplementation, have continued to squeeze its investments in transmission and distribution. The \nlow-voltage distribution network requires improvements if it is to meet the expansion in housing \nand commercial developments. Overdue investment in the medium-voltage distribution network \nhas caused overloading, poor reliability and fluctuating voltage at many locations. The growth in \ndemand for power distributed over the medium-voltage network requires a matching investment \nin  the  transmission  network  and  grid  substations.  Immediate  investments  in  the  transmission \nand  distribution  network  are  needed,  not  only  to  reduce  system  losses  and  to  ensure  the \nstability  of  the  entire  power  system  but  also  to  encourage  private  sector  investment  in \nnonconventional renewable energy.   \n \n \n7. \nHigh Commercial Losses and Lack of Penetration in Rural Areas. The low customer \ndensity  in  suburban  and  rural  areas  causes  higher  network  losses  than  in  urban  areas.  In \nparallel with network strengthening, further efforts are needed to upgrade and improve meters \nand  metering  systems  and  to  enforce  strict  surveillance  to  prevent  theft.  Another  major \nchallenge in rural areas is low penetration in electrified villages. Even in neighborhoods already \nreached by distribution feeders, many households remain unconnected as they cannot afford to \npay connection charges.   \n   \nB. \n\nGovernment Policy and Planning Framework \n\n8. \nThe  Government\u2019s  Ten-Year  Development  Framework  (TYDF)  prepared  in  2006 \nenvisions  \u201csustainable  development  of  energy  resources,  conversion  facilities  and  delivery \nsystems to enable access to and use of energy services by the entire population, and the safe, \nreliable delivery of such energy services at a regionally competitive price, through commercially \nviable  institution  subjected  independent  regulation.\u201d2 To  underpin  the  TYDF,  the  Government \ndeveloped the national energy policy and strategies (NEPS), which is a comprehensive sector \ndevelopment road map, including a long-term investment program as well as policy and reform \nmeasures. It aims to (i) supply electricity to 86% of households by 2010 and 98% by 2016, and \n(ii)  adopt  electricity  tariffs  that  are  comparable  with  those  of  other  countries  and  sufficient  for \nutilities  to  be  viable.  The  Government  gazetted  the  NEPS  in  June  2008.  It  is  based  on  \n\n                                                 \n2  Government of Sri Lanka. 2006.

In the medium term, the Government aims to reverse this trend and start to bring \ndown  the  cost  with  by  adding  three  coal-fired  plants\u2014Puttalam  (900  MW),  Trincomalee  (500 \nMW),  Hambantota  (600  MW)\u2014and  Upper  Kotomale  hydropower  plant  (150  MW)  and  an \nadditional  500  MW  of  renewable  energy.  The  Government  has  imposed  a  moratorium  on  oil-\nburning  power  plants  until  non-oil  sources  provide  90%  of  grid  energy.  The  first  phase  of  the \nPuttalam thermal power project (300 MW) is under construction with funding from the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. Trincomalee is under preparation as a joint venture project between National \nThermal  Power  Corporation  of  India  and  CEB.  Hambantota,  a  proposed  independent  power \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nproducer, is selecting a private investor.

However, \nalthough the act ensures the independent status of PUCSL staff, the final authority for issuing \nlicenses  and  determining  electricity  tariffs  is  vested  in  the  Government  (PUCSL  has  been \nadvising the Government on policy decisions, including setting tariffs). In order to transfer these \npowers to PUCSL and to empower it to regulate the sector fully, Parliament has passed the Sri \nLanka  Electricity  Act  in  March  2009.  The  first  licenses  to  CEB,  LECO,  and  the  utilities  will  be \nissued within 6 months from its enactment.   \n \n9. \nCEB  has  converted  its  generation,  transmission  and  distribution  operations  into  six \nfunctional  business  units  (FBUs),  one  for  generation,  one  for  transmission,  and  four  for \ndistribution. Financial accounts have been segregated so that each FBU will operate as a profit \ncenter.  PUCSL  will  regulate  each  FBU  separately  and  issue  individual  licenses.  The  board  of \nCEB will delegate to the respective heads of the FBU all day-to-day management and the power \nto take all decisions to fulfill the obligations of the FBU under its license, including all financial \npowers to make capital and other investments, recruit personnel, and incur revenue expenses \nto the extent required to ensure the FBU achieves its revenue targets as approved by PUCSL. \nThe board will also authorize the heads of FBUs to delegate some of the functions of the FBU to \nits officers. A memorandum of performance to be signed between the heads of FBUs and the \nboard to ensure that FBU heads will (i) fulfill the license conditions; (ii) achieve the performance \nstandards  set  by  the  regulator;  and  (iii)  have  both  administrative  and  financial  autonomy  to \nmanage the FBU within the stipulations of the license. \n    \n \n \n10. \nThe  country\u2019s  primary  energy  sources  are  indigenous  biomass  (47%  of  the  total  in \n2003), imported petroleum products (45% in 2003) and hydropower (8% in 2003).  About half of \nthe  country\u2019s  hydropower  potential  has  been  already  exhausted.  Increased  penetration  of \nindigenous resources, reduced consumption of fossil fuels and diversification into cheaper fuels \nare, therefore, the limited options available to Sri Lanka. At the end of 2008, there were 73 small \nhydropower  plants  with  a  total  capacity  of  138  MW,  one  3  MW  wind  power  plant,  and  three  \nbiomass plants of 12MW. It is estimated that Sri Lanka has the potential to generate 24,000 MW \nof  renewable  energy,  including  from  biomass,  wind,  and  small  hydropower  plants.  The  TYDF \n\nClean Energy Development \n\n3. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n31 \n\naims to (i) increase the percentage of households electrified through off-grid supply from 4% at \npresent to 10% by 2016; (ii) increase the share of nonconventional renewable energy in on-grid \npower  supply  from  4.1%  at  present  to  10.7%;  (iii)  add  at  least  500  MW  of  renewable  energy \ncapacity  by  2016.  Table  A2.4  shows  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  renewable  energy  development  plan  to \nFY2016. \n \n\nTable A2.4: Renewable Energy Development Plan \n(MW) \n\nItem \n\nFY2008 \n\nFY2012 \n\n    FY2016 \n\nBiomass \nMini Hydropower \nWind \n \n     Total \n\n12 \n138 \n3 \n \n153 \n\n20 \n219 \n78 \n \n317 \n\n50 \n419 \n153 \n \n622 \n\n  Source: Sustainable Energy Authority. \n\n \n11. \nIn October 2007, the Government  established the Sustainable Energy Authority (SEA), \nwith  a  mandate  to  develop  and  implement  policy  for  renewable  energy  development,  energy \nefficiency,  and  energy  conservation.  SEA  has  provided  an  institutional  framework  to  promote \ndevelopment  of  renewable  energy  projects  through  private  investment.  SEA  will  play  a  pivotal \nrole  in  promoting  renewable  energy  development  by  helping  private  sector  investors  to  \n(i) identify potential projects; (ii) obtain government clearances; (iii) gain access to government \nsubsidies  from  the  Sri  Lanka  sustainable  energy  fund  managed  by  SEA;  and  (iv)  enter  into  a \npower  purchase  agreement  with  the  Ceylon  Electricity  Board  (CEB).  It  will  also  develop  and \nimplement  new  policies  and  financing  schemes  for  renewable  energy  development,  energy \nefficiency  improvement,  and  energy  conservation.  The  Government  recently  introduced  new \ntechnology-specific  multi-tier  tariffs  to  attract  more  private  investment  to  nonconventional \nrenewable energy projects. \n \n12. \nLack of grid capacity remains a major technical bottleneck for the development of clean \nenergy sources. In Sri Lanka, private investors have been actively investing in small hydropower \nplants. However, a large number of proposals for new projects are pending because of a lack of \nsubstation  capacity.  Eight  grid  substations  have  been  identified  for  immediate  capacity \nimprovement, which would bring an additional 200 MW of clean energy to the grid.  \n \n \n \n13. \nSystem  Expansion  and  Strengthening.  CEB  has  completed  a  master  plan  for  the \ntransmission system in 2006 and a long-term transmission development plan (LTDP) to 2015. \nThe  LTDP  has  identified  the  significant  investment  needs  in  the  transmission  system  as \n(i) evacuating the power that will be generated from new power plants planned under the LGEP; \n(ii)  improving  overall  system  reliability  and  efficiency;  (iii)  facilitating  rural  electrification;  and  \n(iv) facilitating grid integration of renewable energy projects.  \n \n14. \nThe power plants scheduled to be commissioned by 2016 will require an investment of \n$296  million  in  associated  evacuation  lines.  For  reliable  and  efficient  grid  management,  the \npresent  supervisory  control  and  data  acquisition  (SCADA)  system  needs  to  be  replaced  by  a \nsystem  that  can  ensure  real-time  network  operations.  Investments  in  the  medium-voltage  \nnetwork  have  been  significantly  delayed  because  of  a  lack  of  finance,  causing  overloading, \nunreliability, and poor voltage profiles at many locations. Grid substations and transmission lines \n\nTransmission and Distribution Network Development \n\n4. \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nneed  to  be  strengthened  in  areas  with  particularly  weak  medium-voltage  networks  and \nwidespread problems, including the North-Central, Eastern, and Uva provinces. Demand growth \non  the  medium-voltage  network  will  require  matching  investments  in  the  transmission  network \nand  grid  substations.  The \nlow  voltage  distribution  network  also  requires  continuous \nimprovements to meet the expansion in housing and commercial developments, and to provide \nadditional  distribution  substations  to  ensure  a  reliable  electricity  supply  of  specified  quality.  In \naddition  to  expansion,  the  ageing  sections  of  the  network  have  to  be  replaced,  and  outdated \ncontrol and protection systems have to be upgraded. The investment plan for the transmission \nand distribution network to 2016 is provided in Table A2.5. \n \n\nTable A2.5: Transmission and Distribution Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \nOngoing Projects \nStrengthening of Grid Substations and   \nTransmission Lines \nNew Power Plant Connection \nOther Transmission System \nMedium-Voltage and Low-Voltage Distribution \n     Total \n\n  Source: Government of Sri Lanka. \n\nTotal \n82 \n552 \n\n296 \n52 \n248 \n1,230 \n\n \n15. \nLoss  Reduction.  CEB\u2019s  transmission  and  distribution  losses  have  been  between  15% \nand 17% of net generation over the past two decades (although they increased to about 21% in \n2000,  because  of  the  excessive  number  of  connections  without  meters).  The  number  of \nconnections without meters has now been reduced to a minimum. While the losses have now \nreverted to the pre-2000 levels, they are significantly above the optimal levels of about 12%. In \n2008,  the  transmission  and  distribution  loss  was  estimated  to  be  15.0%  of  net  generation. \nThese  additional  losses  are  partly  technical  and  include  overheating  cables  and  transformers, \nbecause of the excessive current caused by the unplanned connection of new customers, and \nnon-implementation of planned improvements to the network because of financial constraints. A \nsmaller share of the losses is due to connections without meters, metering errors, and theft. The \nGovernment will accelerate improvements to those sections of the transmission and distribution \nnetwork where losses are high, and replace and upgrade the network to reduce losses, which \nwould also improve service quality in terms of voltage profile. The Government will also make a \nparallel  effort  to  upgrade  and  improve  the  meters  and  the  metering  system,  and  conduct \nsurveillance  on  theft.  An  investment  of  $87  million  in  the  loss  reduction  program  is  planned, \nincluding  $64  million  for  the  medium-  and  low-voltage  technical  loss  reduction  program  and  \n$23  million  for  the  nontechnical  loss  reduction  program.  By  these  measures,  the  Government \nplans to reduce overall losses to 12% by 2016. The Government also plans to pilot innovative \noutsourcing  projects  with  ADB  assistance,  particularly  for  nontechnical  loss  reductions  in  peri-\nurban and rural areas.  \n \n \n \n16. \nFrom its inception, CEB has been implementing rural electrification projects with equity \ninvestments  by  the  Government  and  with  internal  funds,  and  has  been  accelerating  rural \nelectrification since the 1980s. As of the end of 2005, 3.34 million housing units (70.8%) out of \n4.56 million had an active grid electricity connection (73.2% including inactive accounts).3 Most \n                                                 \n3   As  of  the  end  of  2005,  the  population  was  estimated  19,668,000,  and  the  average  household  size  was  4.31 \n\nRural Electrification \n\n5. \n\npersons. These figures excluded Kilinochchi, Mannar and Mullaitivu districts in the Northern Province. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n33 \n\nhouseholds without access to electricity are in rural areas. The Government is committed to an \ninterim target of 90% of households by 2010 and an eventual target of 96% (88% on-grid and \n8% off-grid) by 2016.  \n \nOff-Grid Electrification. While some areas can be electrified by closing the gaps in the \n17. \nexisting  network,  most  villages  yet  to  be  electrified  require  longer  medium-voltage  line \nextensions and long low-voltage distribution lines. The Government will identify such areas and \ninvest  in  off-grid  electricity  services  through  small  hydropower,  biomass,  and  wind-based \ngenerating  systems,  and  associated  distribution  lines,  as  well  as  stand-alone  solar  home \nsystems.  About  300  such  community-based  village  electrification  systems  currently  provide \nelectricity to an estimated 10,000 houses. In addition, about 100,000 solar home systems have \nbeen  installed.  Investment  support  for  such  off-grid  services  has  come  from  the  Government \nthrough  the  provincial  councils  and  the  Renewable  Energy  for  Rural  Economic  Development \nproject of the World Bank. \n \n18. \nRural  Household  Connection.  Many  households  in  suburban  and  rural  areas  remain \nunconnected as they cannot afford to pay connection charges, even though distribution feeders \nhave  already  reached  their  neighborhood.  Traditionally,  poor  households  have  been  a  difficult \ngroup  to  target  in  the  electrification  campaigns  because  connections  require  initial  capital  that \nmay be beyond the means of many families. However, some of these households may be able \nto  repay  a  loan  or  connection  fee  in  monthly  installments  over  2\u20133  years.  Reaching  these \nhouseholds  would  bring  two  major  benefits.  First,  the  households  themselves  will  enjoy  the \nbenefits to be derived from having access to electricity. Second, CEB will have more customers, \ngenerating  more  income  and  enabling  progress  toward  the  electrification  targets  set  by  the \nGovernment. \n \nIn  2002,  ADB  approved  a  pilot  project,  the  Power  Fund  for  the  Poor,4 which  became \n19. \noperational  in  2004.  The  project  financed  electricity  connection  costs  for  poorer  households \nthrough a revolving fund administered by local microfinance institutions. As of the end of 2007, it \nhad electrified 10,400 poor rural households in over 400 villages in eight districts. With support \nfrom ADB, the Government will continue to provide a credit support program to rural households \nto build on the success of this pilot project.   \n \n \n \n20. \nThe  SEA  is  mandated  to  develop  and  implement  policies  to  reduce  consumption  and \nachieve  better  energy  efficiency  in  residential,  municipal  and  industrial  end-user  applications. \nThe Government has established a sustainable guarantee facility within SEA to facilitate access \nto  financing  for  energy  conservation  projects.  Eight  technology  priority  areas  have  been \nidentified  by  the  Government  for  pilot  demand-side  and  energy  conservation  projects.  These \ninclude power factor correction in transmission networks and efficiency improvements in lighting \napplications  in  residential  and  commercial  buildings,  lighting  grids,  industrial  boilers,  air \nconditioning systems, compressed air systems, industrial motors and drives, fans and air blow \ninstallations,  and  municipal  water  and  irrigation  pumps  and  systems.  Combined  with  loss \nreduction  programs  in  transmission  and  distribution  networks,  these  initiatives  can  reduce \ndemand for imported fuels and mitigate environmental impacts associated with the increase in \ngreenhouse gases, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter emissions. \n \n\nDemand-Side Management \n\n6. \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB.  2004.  Proposed  Grant  Assistance  to  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Power  Fund  for  the  Poor.  Manila  (financed  by  the \n\nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction). \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n7. \n\nDebt Restructuring and Tariff Rationalization \n\nIn  Sri  Lanka,  end-user  improvements  have  been  largely  price-driven.  In  the  household \n21. \ncustomer  group,  the  major  intervention  has  been  the  promotion  of  compact  fluorescent  lamps \n(CFLs).  A  pilot  program  started  in  1994\u20131995  followed  by  a  large-scale  program.  Interest-free \nloans  were  available  from  CEB  and  LECO  for  the  purchase  of  up  to  three  CFLs.  As  a  result, \nthere  are  now  about  2  million  CFLs  in  operation.  However,  this  program  has  not  been  very \neffective  since  2003  and  the  Government  plans  to  relaunch  it  with  a  target  of  reaching  about  \n4  million  in  operation.  Furthermore,  in  2001,  CEB  and  the  Sri  Lanka  Standards  Institute \nlaunched  a  scheme  to  label  appliances  based  on  their  energy  efficiency.  The  Government \nintroduced mandatory labeling in 2007 and plans to complete it by 2010. It will also update the \nEnergy Efficiency Building Code and to make it mandatory.     \n \n \n \n22. \n Debt Restructuring. In 2005, the Treasury wrote off SLRs7.8 billion of CEB\u2019s deferred \ntax  and  other  payment  arrears  and  made  direct  payments  of  SLRs3.5  billion  to  the  Ceylon \nPetroleum  Corporation  on  behalf  of  CEB.  The  restructuring  of  CEB\u2019s  long-term  debt  of  \nSLRs61  billion  was  approved  by  the  Government  in  April  2006.  Half  of  its  long-term  liabilities \nhave been converted to equity and half have been rescheduled, with repayment to begin only \nafter the commercial operations of the Puttalam coal-fired power plant have begun. This plant is \nexpected to lower CEB\u2019s generation cost substantially and hence to generate more cash debt \nservices.  \n \n23. \nTariff  Rationalization.  To  ensure  electricity  prices  reflect  the  cost  of  supply  and \nincrease revenues, the Government has started to rationalize the tariff structure so all recurrent \nexpenses of CEB can be met by the tariffs. In March 2008, the Government introduced a new \ntariff  structure  that  increased  average  retail  tariffs  by  about  30%.  The  new  tariffs  aim  to  raise \ntariffs  for  domestic  consumers,  which  have  been  heavily  cross-subsidized  by  commercial  and \nindustrial consumers. However, the impact on \u201clifeline tariffs,\u201d considered necessary to maintain \nminimum living standards, has been minimized. The tariff revision has brought CEB close to an \noperational breakeven.  \n \n \n \n24. \nThe Government will continue to promote private sector participation in the power sector.  \nIt has recently opened a conventional hydropower project of less than 50 MW to private sector \ninvestment.  Two  hydropower  projects,  Moragolla  (27  MW)  and  Ging  Ganga  (49  MW),  are \nintended  for  private  sector  investment.  Of  the  planned  base  load  thermal  plants,  the \nHambantota coal-fired power plant is proposed to be an independent power producer and the \nTrincomalee  coal-fired  plant  is  proposed  to  be  a  public\u2013private  partnership  project.  The \nGovernment plans to rely on private sector investments for renewable energy development and \nhas  introduced  technology-specific  subsidized  tariffs  to  promote  small  hydropower,  wind  and \nbiomass generation. \n \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\n8. \n\n \n\n\fPREVIOUS ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK LOANS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nTO THE ENERGY SECTOR IN SRI LANKA \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n35 \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\nLoans \n\n \nTable A3.1:  Previous ADB Loans to the Power Sector in Sri Lanka \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\n \nProject \nBowatena Hydroelectric Projecta \nCanyon Hydropower Projecta \nRural Electrification Projecta \nTrincomalee Thermal Power Project \nSpecial Assistanceb \nSecondary Towns Power Distributionc \nSecondary Towns Power Distribution Project II a b \nPower System Expansion (Sector Loan)a \nSecond Power System Expansion Sector \nEmergency Rehabilitation of Petroleum Facilities \nPower Sector Development Program (Program) \nPower Sector Development Program (Project Loan) \n\n \nLoan No. \n118-SRI(SF) \n299-SRI(SF) \n436-SRI(SF) \n654-SRI(SF) \n634-SRI(SF) \n732-SRI(SF) \n870-SRI(SF) \n1021-SRI(SF) \n1414-SRI(SF) \n1438-SRI(SF) \n1929-SRI(SF) \n1930-SRI(SF) \n \na  The Executing Agency was Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). \nb  A  special  assistance  loan  totaling  $14.7  million  was  provided  to  selected  ADB-financed  Projects  for  local  cost \n\nDate \nApproved \n19 Dec 1972\n26 Jul 1977\n10 Dec 1979\n17 Nov 1983\n16 Aug 1983\n22 Jan 1985\n3 Dec 1987\n31 May 1990\n14 Dec 1995\n16 May 1996\n 31 Oct 2002\n 31 Oct 2002\n\n  8.0 \n 17.5 \n 11.3 \n  3.45 \n 3.8 \n 12.4 \n 34.8 \n 74.3 \n 80.0 \n 24.0 \n60.0 \n70.0 \n399.5 \n\nTotal \n\nfinancing.

The planned enhancement of generation capacity \nwill  be  derived  mainly  from  new  coal-burning  thermal  facilities  and,  as  a  result,  the  share  of \nclean  energy  in  power  generation  will  decrease.  It  is  therefore  crucial  to  mitigate  the  impacts \nassociated  with  this  substantial  enlargement  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  through  rapid \ndemand-side  management  to  reduce  end-user  consumption  and  losses  in  transmission  and \ndistribution networks.  \n  \n2. \nResponsibility  for  street  lighting  traditionally  rests  with  local  authorities  such  as \nmunicipalities, town councils, and pradeshiya sabhas. Electricity bills are paid out of government \nsubsidies  so  municipalities  have  no  incentive  to  reduce  energy  consumption.  In  addition,  the \nGovernment has not been able to pay the full amount of subsidies, which has led to commercial \nlosses for CEB and LECO. In the case of CEB, the energy consumed by street lighting system \nis estimated at 150 GWh per year. Out of this, about 52 GWh  are unaccounted for, adding an \nextra  0.57%  to  CEB  system  losses.  To  put  an  end  to  this  vicious  cycle,  the  Government  has \ndecided  to  delegate  responsibility  for  municipal  street  lighting  to  CEB  and  LECO,  starting  in \nselected urban areas.  \n \n3. \nUnder the project, CEB and LECO will establish internal units based on a utility energy \nservice  company  (ESCO)  model  to  undertake  the  street  lighting  operations  and  maximize \nenergy  savings  through  demand-side  management.  The  ESCO  service  market  is  still  quite \nimmature  in  Sri  Lanka,  and  requires  further  strengthening  and  support  from  external  partners. \nThe  utility  ESCO  model  to  be  set  up  with  ADB  assistance  will  be  used  for  demand-side \nmanagement programs for municipal governments and other customers with capital constraints. \n \nB. \n \nThe energy savings from the project will help reduce the commercial losses of CEB and \n3. \nLECO.  The  outcomes  will  be  (i)  a  reduction  in  energy  consumption  and  related  costs  and \nimplementation of energy efficiency improvements in municipal street lighting systems, and (ii) \nfreed additional capacity and peak load stabilization within distribution networks in the program \nareas.  \n \nC. \n \n4. \nand LECO service areas, and have the following outputs:  \n \n\nThe project will support the implementation of pilot energy efficiency projects in the CEB \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\nOutputs \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nseparation of street lighting feeders and installation of feeder meters; \nreplacement of old conductors and feeder controls; \nreplacement  of  incandescent  and  mercury  evaporation  lamps  with  compact \nfluorescent or sodium lamps to save energy and ensure longer performance (the \nlamps last five times longer than incandescent lamps); and \ninstallation  of  time-of-day  switches  and  electronic  timers  to  cut  electricity \nconsumption during the daytime, eliminate overcharging, remove delays caused \nby manual switching of lamps, and ensure reliable operating schedules. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n \n40 \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nCost Estimate and Financing Plan \n\nD. \n \n5. \n The  total  investment  cost  will  be  $5  million.  Of  this,  $4.2  million  will  be  funded  by  two \nseparate grants (one of $2.2 million from the Climate Change Fund and the other of $2 million \nfrom the Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility)1 and \n$0.8 million will be funded by the Government. In addition, $0.8 million will be funded under the \nClimate Change Fund (CCF) for associated technical assistance.     \n \nE. \n \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  by  CEB  and  LECO  in  their  respective  jurisdictions2 \n6. \nthrough  a  utility-based  ESCO  model.  Management  contracts  for  a  demand-side  management \nprogram on street lighting will be handled by ESCO units to be set up within CEB and LECO. \nThe  realized  energy  savings  will  be  deposited  in  the  ESCOs\u2019  escrow  accounts  and  used  to \nfinance  further  energy  efficiency  projects.  This  will  ensure  that  Clean  Energy  Financing \nPartnership  Facility  funds  are  used  to  create  a  sustainable  impact  and  to  generate  further \nenergy efficiency improvements. The CCF technical assistance will support CEB and LECO to \nestablish the ESCO units. CEB and LECO will collect data to determine baseline consumption, \ninstalling  equipment,  and  monitoring  the  project  performance  in  accordance  with  a  verification \nand monitoring protocol to be developed under the technical assistance. Details of the technical \nassistance are in Appendix 10 and Supplementary E.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Allocation of the fund between CEB and LECO will decided by ADB based on project preparedness and progress \n\nby each agency.    \n\n2  As  defined  by  CEB  Act  No.  17  of  1969  and  the  memorandum  of  associations  of  Lanka  Electricity  Company \n(Private)  established  in  1983  under  the  Companies  Act. In  power  distribution,  LECO  supplies  power  to  Colombo \nand other urban areas in the western and coastal belt while CEB covers the remaining part of the country.   \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n41\n\n \n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION OF RURAL HOUSEHOLD CONNECTION PART \n \n\nBackground \n\nA. \n \nFrom  its  inception,  Ceylon  Electricity  Board  (CEB)  has  been  implementing  rural \n1. \nelectrification projects with equity investments by the Government and with internal funds, and \nhas been accelerating rural electrification since the 1980s. As of the end of 2005, 3.34 million \nhousing  units  (70.8%)  out  of  4.56  million  had  an  active  grid  electricity  connection  (73.2% \nincluding inactive accounts).1 Most households without access to electricity are in rural areas.  \n \n2 \nEven in rural villages that have already been electrified, a large number of households \nremain  unconnected  as  they  cannot  afford  to  pay  connection  charges.  Traditionally,  poor \nhouseholds  have  been  a  difficult  group  to  target  in  the  electrification  campaigns  because \nconnections  require  initial  capital  that  may  be  beyond  the  means  of  many  families.  However, \nsome  of  these  households  may  be  able  to  repay  a  loan  or  a  connection  fee  in  monthly \ninstallments over 2\u20133 years.  Reaching these households would bring two major benefits. First, \nthe  households  themselves  will  enjoy  the  benefits  to  be  derived  from  having  access  to \nelectricity.  Second,  CEB  will  have  more  customers,  generating  more  income,  and  enabling \nprogress toward the electrification targets set by the Government. \n \nIn  2002,  ADB  approved  a  pilot  project,  the  Power  Fund  for  the  Poor. 2 The  project \n3. \nfinanced  the  electricity  connection  costs  for  poorer  households  through  a  revolving  fund \nadministered by local microfinance institutions. It has successfully electrified more than 10,000 \npoor households (1.2% of the total number of poor households in the country) while maintaining \na  recovery  ratio  of  more  than  95%. The  Government  has  asked  ADB  to  build  on  this  success \nwith an Asian Development Fund (ADF) loan funding. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nThe  Project  will  help  to  (i)  improve  operational  and  financial  efficiency  in  rural \nelectrification,  and  (ii)  expand  coverage  of  rural  electrification  for  poverty  reduction.  The \noutcome of the project will be sustainable access to grid electricity by the rural population and a \nbetter service by CEB in rural areas. It is expected that at least 15,000 poor households will be \nconnected to the grid by 2010 and at least 60,000 households by 2016 (8% of the total number \nof poor households).  \n \nC. \n \n5. \nIn  the  Power  Fund  for  the  Poor  (para.  3),  microfinance  institutions  had  a  credit  line \nbacked  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  grant,  which  enabled  them  to  provide  micro \ncredit  to  rural  households  to  help  them  pay  their  service  connection  costs.  Under  this  project, \nCEB  will  provide  installment  credit  for  poor  households  so  they  can  pay  their  upfront  service \nconnection  costs.  CEB  will  develop  the  credit  program  with  ADB  technical  assistance.  The \nprogram  will  be  operated  by  service  providers  with  an  ADF  loan  of  $3.5  million  as  a  line  of \ncredit.  \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                 \n1   As  of  the  end  of  2005,  the  population  was  estimated  19,668,000,  and  the  average  household  size  was  4.31 \n\npersons. These figures excluded Kilinochchi, Mannar and Mullaitivu districts in the Northern Province. \n\n2   ADB.  2004.  Proposed  Grant  Assistance  to  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Power  Fund  for  the  Poor.  Manila  (financed  by  the \n\nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n42     Appendix 7 \n \n \n\nADB  engaged  a  local  nongovernment  organization  to  evaluate  the  Power  Fund  for  the \n6. \nPoor  to  incorporate  its  key  success factors  and lessons  learned  into  the  design  of  the  current \nProject. The evaluation revealed that targeting an appropriate group of households is essential \nto ensuring outreach while minimizing credit loss. CEB plans to start the program in Hambantota \nand  Ratnapura  where  it  also  has  a  grid  extension  program  and  where  service  providers  can \neasily  be  found.  It  then  plans  to  roll  it  out  to  other  areas,  including  Ampara  in  the  Eastern \nProvince. The following categories of household will eligible: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nhouseholds situated in a village that has been  electrified for at least 12 months \nbefore the credit application, \nhouseholds that are able to invest at least 20% of the total cost (connection and \nwiring), \nhouseholds living in houses with the roof and walls made of permanent materials, \nand \nhouseholds with unrestricted access to existing main grid line. \n\n \nWhen a credit application is submitted to CEB from a household, a service provider will \n7. \nassess the household\u2019s repayment capacity and confirm that there are no technical difficulties in \nmaking  the  electricity  connection.  If  the  application  is  approved,  CEB  will  provide  a  service \nconnection and the connection cost will be recoded as a loan to the customer in CEB\u2019s balance \nsheet. The loan will be recovered in installments over 24\u201336 months, together with payments for \nelectricity bills. An escrow account will be set up in CEB to receive installment payments. \n \n8. \nThe  funds  in  the  account  will  be  used  to  finance  the  cost  of  connection  for  new \ncustomers. Principal and interests on the loans to customers will be deposited to the account to \nprovide  loans  to  new  customers  as  well  as  to  make  repayments  on  the  ADB  loan.  CEB  will \nadminister the account, monitor loan recovery, and report to ADB regularly. Interest rates on the \ninstallments will be used to cover the cost of ADB loan, administration costs and a risk premium, \nbut CEB will not expect to make profit from this project. Detailed implementation arrangements \nand a fund-flow chart is provided in Figure A7.1. \n\n \n\n \nCost Estimate and Financing Plan \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nD. \n \n9. \nAn  ADF  loan  of  $3.5  million  will  be  provided  for  CEB  to  establish  a  line  of  credit.  The \nproject will require technical assistance of $2.5 million, of which $2.0 million will be financed by \nthe Japan Special Fund and $0.5 million by CEB.  \n \nE. \n \n10. \nAs CEB staff have little experience in the customer credit business, the management of \nthis  credit  program  will  be  outsourced  to  service  providers.  This  will  include  (i)  awareness-\nbuilding among potential beneficiaries; (ii) identification of potential customers; (iii) assessment \nof  customers\u2019  payment  capabilities;  (iv)  processing  of  credit  applications;  and  (v)  credit \nadministration and recovery. There will be a performance-based contract between CEB and the \nservice providers, measured mainly by the recovery ratio. This means that part of the credit risk \nwill  be  passed  on  to  the  service  provider.  The  microfinance  institutions  that  have  been \nimplementing the Power Fund for the Poor are expected to be the service providers. CEB staff \nwill  work  with  them  and  provide  technical  assessments,  cost  estimates,  and  service \nconnections. ADB TA will support CEB in detailed project design, preparation of a performance-\nbased contract, selection of service providers and capacity building of stakeholders.

Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is the national utility. It owns and is responsible for \nthe generation, transmission, and approximately 90% of the distribution of electrical power in Sri \nLanka.  Lanka  Electricity  Company  (LECO)  was  formed  as  a  distribution  company  under  the \nCompanies  Act  and  most  of  its  shares  are  owned  by  CEB  and  the  Government.    Municipal \nauthorities are minority shareholders  \n \nThe  CEB  transmission  system  comprises  a  220  kV  and  132  kV  transmission  network \n2. \nconnected  to  grid  substations  and  power  stations.  However,  underinvestment  and  delayed \ninvestments  are  causing  severe  constraints  on  the  operation,  reliability,  and  quality  of  the \nelectricity  supply.  Development  and  strengthening  of  the  primary  transmission  and  associated \ngrid substation facilities are essential to meet the suppressed and growing electricity demand.  \n \n3. \nThe  proposed  transmission  system  investments  are  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership  strategy  and  provide  a  least-cost  intervention  to  improve  physical  infrastructure.1 \nElectricity is a prerequisite for GDP growth as well as for rural and urban development, and an \nadequate  power  supply  is  essential  for  increasing  private  sector  investment  in  industry  and \ncommerce, and for promoting agro-industrial activity and off-farm employment. The importance \nof  improving  the  efficiency  of  the  electricity  system  has  been  heightened  by  the  rapid  rise  in \nworld fuel prices over the past 5 years. These have affected Sri Lanka badly as over 58% of its \npower  supply  comes  from  relatively  small,  high-cost,  diesel-fired  generating  plants.  By \nupgrading the transmission system, removing bottlenecks, and improving system efficiency, the \nproposed  investments  can  contribute  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  provide  better  services  at  an \naffordable price. As electricity transmission is a natural monopoly under the direction of CEB, a \npublic sector intervention to fund the needed investments is justifiable. \n \n4. \nsought to determine and verify: \n\nAn  economic  analysis  was  undertaken  for  the  investment  components.  The  analysis \n\n(i)  electricity demand and supply projections;  \n(ii)  that the proposed subprojects are part of the national least cost expansion program; \n(iii) economic cost benefit analysis including sensitivities to key variables; and \n(iv) distribution of costs and benefits amongst stakeholders.  \n \n\n5. \nEconomic  benefits  will  accrue  from  the  cost  savings  resulting  from  displacing  more \nexpensive  sources  of  energy  due  to  the  system  improvements,  and  incremental  benefits  from \ngreater electricity consumption.  \n\nDemand Forecast \n\n \nB. \n \n6. \nOverall  annual  electricity  demand  grew  from  823  GWh  in  1972  to  5,416  GWh  in  2000, \nrepresenting  an  annual  compound  growth  rate  of  about  7%.  Since  then  it  has  grown  at  about \n8% per annum to the current 8,458 GWh.2 CEB prepared a national power and energy demand \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy (2009-2011): Sri Lanka. Manila. \n2 CEB data as of the end of 2007. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n51\n\nLeast-Cost Planning \n\nforecast  for 2006\u20132026,  which  formed  the  basis  for  preparing  specific grid  substation  demand \nforecasts used to identify the basic grid substation capacity enhancement requirements. As the \ndemand for electricity in Sri Lanka is increasing by 8%\u20139% per annum, the primary transmission \nand associated grid substation facilities have to be enhanced and strengthened. \n \nC. \n \n7. \nCEB\u2019s long-term transmission development plan for 2006\u20132015 identified the upgrades \nthat  were  needed,  using  load  flow  studies,  reliability  studies,  short  circuit  calculations,  and \nstability  studies,  carried  out  using  the  power  system  simulator  for  engineering.  Several \nengineering options to improve the network were proposed. These were evaluated from a cost \nperspective and for economic viability. Economically viable proposals were then selected for the \nCEB expansion and upgrade plan.   \n \nD. \n \nAll  costs  and  benefits  are  expressed  in  constant  2009  prices.  The  domestic  price \n8. \nnumeraire  was  used;  tradable  inputs  were  valued  at  their  border  price  equivalent  value  and \nwere  converted  to  domestic  equivalents  using  an  estimated  standard  exchange  rate  factor  of \n1.02. Capital costs included physical contingencies, but excluded taxes, price contingencies and \nfinancial charges during construction. \n\nProject Costs \n\n \n\nProject Benefits \n\nE. \n  \nThe  Project\u2019s  investment  outputs  can  be  categorized  into  three  groups,  with  the  first \n9. \ngroup  enjoying  slightly  different  economic  benefits:  (i)  system  upgrades,  including  the \naugmentation  and  construction  of  grid  substations  and  transformer  capacity  enhancement; \n(ii)  construction  of  new  transmission  lines;  and  (iii)  construction  of  the  new  system  control \ncenter. \n \n10. \nThe  primary  benefit  of  grid  substation  augmentations  and  transformer  capacity \nenhancements  are  the  reduction  in  unserved  demand.  This  demand  will  now  be  met  by \nincreasing  the  transmission  capacity  by  eliminating  transmission  bottlenecks  from  the  existing \n\u201cwithout-project\u201d  scenario,  and  by  enabling  the  grid  to  accommodate  the  anticipated  demand \ngrowth  over  time.  This  incremental  power  supply  is  valued  using  consumers\u2019  estimated \nwillingness to pay for incremental consumption. \n \n11. \nThe  primary  benefit  from  the  new  transmission  lines  is  the  power  flow  improvements, \nand  the  resulting  elimination  of  diesel-fired  power  generation  that  is  required  in  the  \u201cwithout-\nproject\u201d  scenario.  The  need  for  small,  local  diesel  generators  for  voltage  correction  in  the \nrespective  transmission  constrained  areas  will  be  eliminated  by  the  construction  of  new  lines, \nwhich  will  allow  grid  power  to  flow  into  these  areas.  This  produces  a  resource  cost  saving  for \nCEB when grid-supplied power costs are compared with the higher-priced, small-scale, diesel-\nfired generation that they will replace. As with the new system control center, this represents a \nnon-incremental  output  of  electricity  to  consumers,  and  is  valued  as  a  resource  cost  savings \nthat  accrues  if  these  transmission  lines  are  built.  CEB  estimates  the  marginal  cost  of  these \ncaptive diesel plants to be SLRs18.65/kWh. Another benefit of these new transmission lines is \nthat  they  will  be  able  to  handle  the  anticipated  load  growth  on  CEB\u2019s  system.  However,  this \nbenefit  cannot  be  valued  on  its  own;  it  will  have  to  be  considered  as  part  of  CEB\u2019s  long-term \nintegrated  power  system  expansion  program,  encompassing  generation,  transmission  and \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nEstimation of Willingness to Pay \n\ndistribution. For  this  Project\u2019s  economic  evaluation,  only  the  immediate,  resource  cost  savings \nwere quantified, thus producing conservative results. \n \n12. \nThe primary benefit of the new system control center will be increased system efficiency \nand  reduced  transmission  network  losses.  The  new  control  center  will  enable  proper  system \nmanagement, and voltage and reactive power optimization. To value these benefits, the quantity \nof  extra  power  that  would  have  had  to  be  generated  to  make  up  system  inefficiencies  and \nnetwork  losses  results  in  non-incremental  electricity  consumption  from  the  consumers\u2019 \nperspective. Its value represents the resource cost savings that would accrue if this subproject \nwere to proceed and is valued at the avoided cost of generation. The second calculated benefit \nis from incremental power sales due to reduced system outages and reduced restoration times \nwhen  outages  occur.  However,  this  benefit  is  very  small  compared  with  the  resource  cost \nsavings (about 0.3% of total calculated benefits). \n  \n13. \nThe cost of electricity in Sri Lanka is very high  because of dependence on diesel-fired \nbase  load  generation  and  oil  price  increases.  In  such  a  high-cost  environment,  resource  cost \nsavings  produce  high  upfront  economic  benefits.  It  is  projected  that  the  average  cost  of \nelectricity  will  decrease  over  time,  as  the  planned  addition  of  coal-fired  generation  will  lower \naverage system costs.3 In the economic analysis, high upfront resource cost savings decrease \nover time. \n \nF. \n \n14. \nThe  estimation  of  willingness  to  pay  used  the  methodology  outlined  in  the  ADB \nEconomics  and  Research  Department\u2019s  technical  note  Measuring  Willingness  to  Pay  for \nElectricity.4 The economic benefits of electricity consumption are based on the alternative costs \nof  energy  used  in  the  absence  of  grid-supplied  electricity.  Estimates  of  these  benefits  require \ntheoretical  demand  curves  for  electricity  use  by  various  consumer  categories.  Taking  into \naccount  the  value  of  alternative  fuel  sources  to  satisfy  suppressed  demand,  in  the  rural \ndomestic context, the cost of kerosene illumination was used. In the commercial and industrial \ncontext, the cost of diesel generators was used.  \n \nTwo methods were employed to estimate willingness to pay (further detail is available in \n15. \nSupplementary  Appendix  F).  First,  demand  functions  relating  energy  price  to  energy  demand \nwere  estimated  for  each  of  the  three  main  consumer  groups  in  Sri  Lanka  (domestic, \ncommercial,  and  industrial).5 Average  price  and  consumption  data  for  the  past  5  years  were \nadjusted  for  income  and  inflation  to  arrive  at  a  common  2009  base.  Consumption  data  were \nscaled for estimated suppressed demand.6  Regression analysis was used on the data points to \nderive  the  three  demand  functions.  Solving  the  demand  functions  for  the  increase  in \nconsumption  per  consumer  enabled  by  the  investments  gives  willingness  to  pay  for  additional \nunits  of  consumption  of  SLRs21.51/kWh  (domestic  consumers),  SLRs18/kWh  (commercial \nconsumers) and SLRs16.34/kWh (industrial consumers), with a weighted average value based \non power usage of SLRs18.9/kWh. However, as this regression analysis used a limited number \nof years of data, alternative approaches are recommended and their results compared. Second, \n\n                                                 \n3   The average cost of electricity, at over SLRs13/kwh, is projected to decrease by about 50% over 10 years. \n4   Choynowski,  Peter.  2002.  Measuring  Willingness  to  Pay  for  Electricity.  Manila:  ADB  (Economics  and  Research \n\n5   The category of street lighting was not included. As this segment accounts for only 1.5% of electricity consumption, \n\nDepartment Technical Note Series No. 3). \n\nthis elimination is considered valid. \n\n6   As the full amount is difficult to quantify, a conservative estimate for suppressed demand of 2% was used. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n53\n\nsurvey  information  was  taken  from  two  previous  ADB-funded  studies. 7 Sri  Lanka\u2019s  national \nelectrification ratio as of 2005 was 75%. Substantial disparities in access to electricity still exist, \nwith rural areas having the least amount of electrification. For rural customers, the alternative to \ngrid-supplied  electricity  is  kerosene.  Average  kerosene  usage  in  non-electrified  villages  was \n12.5  kWh  equivalent  of  kerosene  per  month,  while  average  electricity  usage  in  electrified \nvillages was 41 kWh per month. Using the price for kerosene and the domestic electricity tariff, \nand the functional form for the demand for electricity of ln qe = \u03b1 + \u03b2pe, the economic benefit of \nincremental  consumption  is  SLRs22.74/kWh.  This  value  was  applied  to  all  residential \nconsumers. For nonresidential consumers, the alternative is the use of diesel generators. In an \nearlier  ADB-funded  study,  92%  of  sampled  industries  had  backup  unit  generating  facilities  to \nsatisfy  their  full  or  partial  demand  for  power  at  a  higher  cost  than  grid-based  power.8 To  be \nconservative,  it  was  assumed  that  only  the  variable  costs  of  diesel  generators  would  be \ndisplaced;  in  other  words,  it  was  assumed  that  there  would  not  be  any  avoidance  of  capital \ncosts  for  diesel  generators.  Marginal  costs  of  diesel  generators  were  based  on  an  estimated \nborder  price  equivalent  value  of  diesel  of  SLRs80.0  per  liter,  specific  consumption  of  0.25 \nliters/kWh, and non-fuel operation and maintenance of SLRs0.6/kWh. This gave a total variable \ncost of SLRs20.6/kWh. Using this cost versus the marginal average electricity tariff of SLRs12, \nas  well  as  quantities  of  power  for  commercial  and  industrial  users  based  on  CEB  data,  and \nusing the functional form for the demand for electricity, the benefit of incremental consumption is \nSLRs14.39/kWh,  with  a  weighed  average  value  of  SLRs18.0/kWh.  Using  the  two  weighted \naverage  values  from  the  regression  and  survey  methods  of  18.9  and  18.0  respectively,  the \naverage of these, SLRs18.45 /kWh is used in this economic analysis. Further detail is provided \nin Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \nG. \n \n16. \nA period of 30 years was used for economic evaluation, reflecting the economic lives of \nthe investment components. Investment is assumed to take place in the period 2009\u20132011, and \nbenefits  are  assumed  to  be  realized  from  2010.  The  incremental  costs  and  benefits  of  the \ninvestment  components  were  estimated  by  comparing  \u201cwith-project\u201d  and  \u201cwithout-project\u201d \nscenarios. Detailed cost\u2013benefit calculations show that overall the subprojects are expected to \ndeliver significant economic benefits.

Constant price financial cash flows \nfrom the investment program were estimated and discounted at 12% to estimate present values \nof  cost  and  benefit  streams.  Constant  price  economic  cost  and  benefit  streams  were  also \ndiscounted  at  12%,  and  the  differences  between  financial  and  economic  present  values, \nrepresenting gains and losses to stakeholders, were calculated. Analysis was undertaken on a \nprefinancing  basis,  so  lenders  were  not  included  as  stakeholders.  Income  tax  was  excluded \nfrom the analysis. \n \n20. \nOverall,  the  economic  net  present  value  exceeds  the  financial  net  present  value  by \nSLRs9.46 billion,  with  the  vast  majority  of  this  benefit  (SLRs9.43  billion)  split  between  the \nbenefit  to  consumers  in  the  form  of  consumer  surplus,  and  benefits  to  CEB  in  resource  cost \nsavings, which in turn is shared with consumers in the long run in the form of lower tariffs.  \n \nJ. \n \nThe economic analysis confirms that the proposed investments are part of the least-cost \n21. \nsystem  upgrade  plan  for  Sri  Lanka  and  are  economically  viable.

From  an  economic \nperspective, the proposed Project is justified. \n \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nSUMMARY OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.    Methodology and Major Assumptions \n \nThe financial analysis of the investment components was carried out in accordance with \n1. \nADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.1 All  financial  costs  and  benefits  are \nexpressed in constant 2008 prices. Cost streams were used to determine financial internal rates \nof return (FIRR), i.e., capital investment and operation and maintenance costs reflect the costs \nof delivering the estimated benefits. The tariff rates used for incremental energy sales that were \nused to estimate the financial benefits reflect the tariff increases announced in February 2008 \nand  effective  15  March  2008  (although  the  full  tariff  used  in  the  estimation  is  lower  than  the \nannounced rate in case the new tariffs are only partially implemented). The weighted average \ncost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  Ceylon  Electricity  Board  (CEB)  was  calculated  for  the  proposed \nProject and compared with the project component FIRRs to ascertain the financial viability of the \nsubproject  investments.  The  sensitivity  of  the  FIRR  to  adverse  movements  in  the  underlying \nassumptions  was  also  assessed.  Based  on  this  analysis,  it  is  concluded  that  the  Project  is \nfinancially viable.  \n \n2. \nCapital  costs  include  all  civil  works,  equipment,  construction,  and  installation  costs \nassociated  with  each  investment,  as  well  as  any  applicable  taxes,  duties  and  physical \ncontingencies. Ongoing operations and maintenance cost assumptions are commensurate with \nestablished  norms  for  transmission  system  facilities  of  this  nature.  Financial  viability  was \nexamined  by  comparing  the  incremental  costs  and  benefits  of  the  \u201cwith-project\u201d  and  \u201cwithout-\nproject\u201d  scenarios.  The  incremental  benefits  of  the  substation  augmentation  and  construction \ncomponents are based on additional revenues earned by CEB from the sale of additional power \nto consumers as a result of the elimination of transmission system bottlenecks. These revenues \nare valued at the applicable tariff versus the cost of supply, adjusted for system losses. The new \ntransmission  lines  eliminate  the  need  to  run  small-scale,  localized  diesel  plants  for  voltage \ncorrection and grid stability in areas that previously lacked transmission lines, resulting in cost \nsavings. The new system control center also enables resource cost savings from lower system \nlosses,  fewer  outages,  and  reduced  restoration  time  after  outages.  It  is  assumed  that  the \ninvestment components will have 30-year economic lives.   \n \n3. \nCEB\u2019s tariff rates are divided into domestic, religious purpose, commercial, and industrial \nrates  per  unit.  The  domestic  and  religious  purpose  rates  are  specified  for  each  block  of \nconsumption  level,  increase  progressively,  and  are  accompanied  by  a  fixed  monthly  charge. \nThe commercial and industrial rates contain per-unit as well as fixed charges based on voltage \nsupply  levels,  and  some  industrial  customers  can  opt  to  pay  peak  and  off-peak  rates.  The \nexisting  tariff  (applicable  from  1  February  2007)  contains  a  20%  fuel  charge  for  domestic \nconsumers using more than 90 units per month and commercial consumers, religious purpose \nand  industrial  consumers  were  exempted).  In  2007,  the  weighted  average  tariff  per  unit  of \nelectricity  sold,  including  the  fixed  charges  and  based  on  the  distribution  of  customers,  was \nSLRs10.53/kWh.  As  LECO  makes  bulk  power  purchases  from  CEB  and  passes  through  the \npurchase  costs  to  its  customers,  the  weighted  average  LECO  tariff  was  slightly  higher  at \nSLRs12.77/kWh  for  2007.  Under  the  proposed  new  tariff,  the  rates,  including  monthly  fixed \ncharges,  have  increased  for  certain  categories  of  consumers,  such  as  domestic  consumers \nconsuming power in excess of 360 units per month and commercial consumers (e.g., hotels). In \naddition,  as  CEB  no  longer  receives  subsidized  fuel  from  Ceylon  Petroleum  Corporation  for \npower  generation,  CEB  will  impose  a  20%  fuel  adjustment  charge  on  all  categories  of \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

The tariff rates used in the analysis are from CEB\u2019s proposed changes to the tariff \nschedule announced in February 2008.2  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nTo compute the WACC, it is assumed that the financing sources would be Government \nequity  contributions  and  foreign  loans.  The  cost  of  CEB\u2019s  equity  is  calculated  at  25%.3 The \nWACC  is  usually  calculated  on  a  post  tax  basis  with  taxes  at  32.5%  of  net  profits;  however, \nbecause  of  the  tax  position  of  CEB,  the  loan  portion  was  not  tax  adjusted  in    computing  this \nWACC.  The  other  assumptions  are  a  domestic  inflation  rate  of  13% 4  and  an  international \ninflation rate of 0.8% (Table A12.1).  \n \n\nTable A12.1: Weighted Average Cost of Capital (%) \n\nSource \nAmount ($ million) \nWeighting \nNominal Cost \nTax Rate \nTax Adjusted Nominal Cost \nInflation Rate \nReal Cost  \nWeighted  WACC \n\nADB Loan \n123.8 \n69.0 \n6.0 \n0.0a \n6.0 \n0.8 \n5.2 \n3.6 \n\nEquity \n55.6 \n31.0 \n25.0 \n0.0 \n25.0 \n13.0 \n10.6 \n3.3 \n\nTotal \n179.5 \n100.0 \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n6.9 \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \na The loan portion was not adjusted because CEB does not pay tax. \n\nCalculation FIRR, Risk Assessment and Sensitivity Analyses \n\n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  is  calculated  at  8.5%  for  the  overall  project \ncomponents  (Table  A12.2).

However,  the  investments  take  place  in  numerous \nlocations and there is an overall shortage of power in Sri Lanka, both of which help to diversify \nthis  risk.  Therefore,  the  overall  risk  to  the  financial  sustainability  of  CEB  is  deemed  to  be \nmanageable, provided the proposed tariff increase takes place. \n \nProject-Specific Risks. Financial risks at subproject level include (i) an increase in the \n7. \nprice of civil works and equipment, (ii) delays in project implementation, and (iii) failure to have \naccess to necessary counterpart funds. These risks are considered to be low for three reasons. \nFirst,  the  cost  estimates  were  based  on  recent  tenders  received.  Advanced  procurement  will \nreduce the time between loan effectiveness and disbursement. Second, CEB\u2019s implementation \ncapacity is sufficient for these types of investments and further support will be provided under \nthe  capacity  development  component.  Third,  CEB\u2019s \nfinancial  projections  demonstrate \nsatisfactory cash flows throughout the forecast period to meet the repayment of debt associated \nwith the investments, once the investment components are commissioned. \n \nE. \n\nSensitivity Analysis  \n\n  \n\n8. \nSeparate analyses were carried out to examine the sensitivity of the FIRR and financial \nnet  present  value  to  adverse  changes  in  key  variables.  The  variables  considered  for  the \nsensitivity  analyses  were:  a  10%  increase  in  capital  costs,  a  10%  increase  in  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M costs, and a 10% decrease in revenues (allowable costs). Project-specific \ntests include a 2-year implementation delay with a 20% increase in costs.  \n \n9. \nthe WACC.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Government of Sri Lanka has been investing for decades in human development, including health care and education. \nInvestments  in  rural  electrification,  distribution,  and  the  transmission  system  enhancements  will  improve  living  standards, \nparticularly of the poor. This project will support the Government\u2019s social and economic development efforts. \n \nIn particular, the Project is expected to increase transmission and distribution capacity. It will lead to an affordable and reliable \npower  supply,  improve  energy  efficiency  and  provide  more  access  to  electricity  for  the  poor  for  sustained  and  inclusive \neconomic  growth.  It  will  (i)  help  bring  200  MW  clean  energy  sources  on  grid  by  removing  transmission  bottlenecks; \n(ii)  maintaining  system  reliability  to  ensure  a  stable  power  supply;  (iii)  improve    energy  efficiency  through  an  innovative \nbusiness  model  including  public\u2013private  partnership;  (iv)  improve  sector  governance  by  strengthening  the  regulatory \nframework  and  supporting  internal  reforms  of  the  Ceylon  Electricity  Board  (CEB)  (v)  promote  power  supply  for  poor  rural \nhouseholds; and (vi) contribute to development of conflict-affected areas. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                    Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nAlthough  this  project  is  not  designed  to  be  a  targeted  intervention,  a  number  of  key  elements  will  ensure  it  has  positive \nimpacts  on  poverty.  The  distribution  substation  in  Colombo  will  increase  the  power  reliability,  from  which  both  public \nconsumers (such as social services) and private consumers (households and businesses) will benefit.  \n \nTransmission system enhancement  will also have positive impacts, since some important areas  will be now reached by the \nnational grid, particularly the Eastern Province and Pallekelle industrial district. In the first case, the Government is expecting \nthat  the  improvement  of  the  power  supply  to  the  Eastern  Province  will  have  reduce  poverty  and  support  investments.  In \nPallekelle  the  connection  to  the  grid  will  increase  the  productivity  of  the  existing  factories  (which  have  been  relying  on \ngenerators)  and  will  boost  the  investments  in  new  factories.  In  both  cases  jobs  will  be  created.  In  addition  to  the  facilities \nmade  available  to  small-scale  industries,  Medium-sized  and  large  industries  can  also  benefit  from  the  availability  of \nsubstations and spur medium voltage lines. This will open up opportunities for villages to sell ancillary services to industries. \n \nFinally, the Asian Development Fund (ADF) component will support CEB to provide connections to poor households in rural \nSri Lanka. The pilot program will be implemented first in three of the poorest districts: Hambantota, Ratnapura, and the East. \nHouseholds will be more productive, employment will be created, home garden cultivation will be increased through the use of \ndomestic water pumps, and backyard farms and small cottage industries will benefit.  \n \nThis  component  is  expected  to  improve  the  living  standards  of  poor  households,  by  improving  health  conditions,  reducing \nexpenditure  on  power  (on-grid  electricity  is  cheaper  and  more  reliable  than  kerosene),  increasing  their  productivity  and \nincome, and increasing the number of hours children can study at night. \n \nNon-electrified households in Sri Lanka use kerosene oil for domestic lighting so electrification will lead to savings in the use \nof imported fuel.  \n \n\nI. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nFindings of Social Analysis  \nGenerally, Sri Lanka enjoys social indicators that are higher than those in other countries of similar economic status. It has a \nhigh literacy rate, high life expectancy at birth and low child mortality. These achievements are due to efforts to provide  vital \nbasic needs in the villages. The extension of electricity will eventually contribute greatly to raising the social indicators.  \n \nNonetheless, social development has been uneven throughout the country. In designing the ADF component (connection for \nthe poor) selection was made at three different levels.  \n \nTarget Districts.  Based on poverty indicators, national policy on rural electrification, and ADB\u2019s focus on Eastern Province, \nthe  three  districts  of  Ampara,  Hambantota  and  Ratnapura  have  been  short-listed  for  the  initial  round  of  the  project.  Other \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n\n61\n\ndistricts could enter the project following recommendations based on project evaluations. All three districts were short listed \non the basis of poverty. The national policy on rural electrification is committed to providing 100% access in the two districts of \nHambantota and Ratnapura. \n \nTargeting Divisional Secretary Divisions and Electricity Schemes: Unlike the pilot Power Fund for the Poor, the scheme \nwill be open to both existing and new electrification schemes. To increase the probability of the most deserving households \nreceiving the benefits of this funding, the project will give priority to divisional secretary divisions with poverty rates higher than \nthe  overall  district  average  rate,  but  other  divisional  secretary  divisions  may  also  be  serviced.  However  for  all  divisional \nsecretary  divisions  and  existing  and  new  schemes,  the  criteria  of  a  12-month  time  gap  should  be  applied  for  loan  financed \nconnections. This is in line with the rationale of targeting used in the pilot Power Fund for the Poor. \n \nTargeting Households. As in the pilot Power Fund for the Poor, the definition of a poor household will be households unable \nto afford the capital outlay needed to obtain electricity. Within this target group, the ability to service a loan while meeting the \nelectricity  bill  will  be  a  critical  qualifying  criterion.  Deciding  on  the  credit  worthiness  of  the  potential  borrower  will  be  the \nresponsibility of the service providers. The basic technical criteria set down by the CEB for a housing structure to qualify for \nmain grid electricity will apply here as well. \n \nThe Project\u2019s main social impacts will be the possible loss of crops due to the construction of towers and the stringing of \ntransmission lines. These will be  minimized through careful planning and scheduling of the activities and related civil works. \nAdditional compensation, whenever needed, will be awarded to vulnerable groups, including indigenous peoples, households \nheaded by women, and poor households. \n\nB.  Consultation and participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nAffected communities have been consulted from the beginning to minimize or avoid impacts. The corridor  of the proposed \ntransmission lines has been identified in consultation with the communities and the affected people. Their concerns have \nbeen taken into consideration throughout the process. Communities and affected persons will continue to be consulted during \nthe entire implementation of the project to ensure that most civil works will be scheduled to avoid disruption of the crops. \n \nConsultations have also been carried out with the implementing agencies of the Power for the Poor project, as well as with \nother NGOs and financial agencies. The object has been to design the ADF component in the most efficient way, learning \nform the Power Fund for the Poor experience. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why.  \nNo plan was prepared as impacts are expected to be minimal and the most crucial part of the consultation was carried out in \nadvance to minimize impacts. \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues. Women are going to be positively affected, particularly under the ADF component as they generally work at \nhome and are responsible for fetching alternative sources of energy. As beneficiaries will be selected from among the poorer \n(although still economically viable) and vulnerable households, this will include households headed by women.  \n \n2.  Key  Actions.

All  15  substations  to  be  augmented  under  this \n\nA. \n \nThis  resettlement  and  compensation  plan  covers  parts  2,  3,  6  and  7  of  the  Project  as \n1. \nother parts will not have any adverse social impact. Parts 2, 3, 6 and 7 include the augmentation \nof  15  grid  substations,  construction  of  four  new  substations,  and  construction  of  five  new \ntransmission lines over new rights-of-way. \n \n2. \nproject would use land owned by CEB.  \n \nConstruction  of  Four  New  Substations.  In  selecting  land  for  new  substations,  a \n3. \nnumber  of  optional  sites  were  reviewed  for  each  substation.  To  minimize  the  resettlement \nimpacts,  preference  was  always  given  to  government-owned  lands  to  avoid  resettlement  of \nprivate  dwellings  and  impacts  on  land  use.  Particular  attention  is  given  to  the  convenience  of \naccess to a transmission corridor.  \n \n4. \nConstruction  of  Five  New  Transmission  Lines. This resettlement and compensation \nplan first explains the process of selecting the new rights-of-way for transmission lines.  Initially, \na  number  of  map-based  routing  options  were  considered  for  each  new  line,  with  the  primary \nfocus on avoiding or minimizing  impacts on human settlements or built up areas, forest and wild \nlife reserves, places of cultural or historical importance, social infrastructure (e.g., playgrounds, \nschools, or hospitals), and areas with trees. As a result of this careful selection of line routes, \nand  the  subsequent  public  consultation  and  the  appeal  procedure,  the  National  Grid \nDevelopment Project is not expected to cause any involuntary relocation of persons from their \ndwellings.  CEB  will  ensure  that  maximum  efforts  will  be  made  to  avoid  involuntary  relocation, \neven if unforeseen events occur.  \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThe rest of this appendix examines only the land use effects of the five new transmission \nline corridors to be developed under this Project. The width of the corridor for all 132 kV lines is \n27 meters (13.5 m on each side). Table A14.1 shows the summary resettlement and land-use \nimpacts of each transmission line corridor.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nImpacts \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTable A14.1: Project Impacts \n\nPermanent Land \nAcquisition (ha) \n\nGovernment \nLand  \n0 \n\nAffected \nHouseholds \n(Permanent) \n0 \n\nTemporary \nAffected \nArea (ha) \n0 \n\nPrivate \ntrees \nto be \ncut \n0 \n\nTotal Affected \nBlocks of \nLands  \n(Temporary) \n0 \n\nTotal \nAffected \nHouseholds \n0 \n\n64 \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nPrivate \n0 \n\nSubproject Element  \nNew System Control \nCentre \n \nNetwork Capacity Augmentation for \nRenewable Energy Project \nGrid Substations to \nbe augmented \n1 1.

Until  2001,  project-related  resettlement  issues  were \nguided by Land Acquisition Act, 1950, as amended from time to time.  However, as this did not \nhave  adequate  provisions  for  the  full  social  and  economic  rehabilitation  of  the  people  to  be \nresettled,  Sri  Lanka  has  adopted  a  National  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (NIRP),  which \nrequires a resettlement plan to be included in the approval process if a project affects more than \n20 families.1  The policy assigns the overall responsibility for its implementation to the Ministry of \nLand  Development,  with  the  project-approving  agencies  and  the  Central  Environmental \nAuthority also being assigned responsibilities for evaluation and implementation. \n \nIn addition to the NIRP, a cabinet decision in 2006 (amended in 2007) covered payment \n7. \nof compensation for families affected by land acquisition for power sector development projects \nand works connected with electrical undertakings. No involuntary resettlement is foreseen in this \nproject,  but,  in  case  any  involuntary  resettlement  becomes  unavoidable,  compensation  will  be \npaid in accordance with the NIRP and the cabinet decision. \n \n8. \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy is provided in Table A14.2.  \n \n\nA  comparison  between  the  Sri  Lanka  Acts  and  Regulations,  the  NIRP,  and  the  ADB \n\nTable A14.2: Comparison of Sri Lanka Involuntary Resettlement Policy and ADB Policy \n\nPolicy Element \n\nSri Lanka \n\nADB \n\nComments \n\n \n(cid:51) \n\n \n(cid:51) \n\n \n(cid:51) \n\n \n(cid:51) \n\n \n(cid:51) \n\n1.
