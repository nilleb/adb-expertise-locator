THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Georgia for the Secondary Road Improvement Project.1 \n2.  The proposed project will rehabilitate a road which extends for about 50 kilometers (km) \nfrom Dzirula to Chumateleti in Central Georgia to two-lane all-weather standard. The present \ncondition of the road is very poor, and this is suppressing the development of one of the poorest \nareas of the country. \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Georgia is located in the Southern Caucasus, at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. It is \nan important transit corridor for many countries in Central and West Asia, especially Armenia, \nAzerbaijan, Turkey, and Russia. As a result of economic and institutional reforms and sound \nmacroeconomic policies, Georgia\u2019s economy expanded by 9.6% annually, on average, during \n2003\u20132007, and withstood the effects of the 2008 armed conflict with the Russian Federation \nand the global financial crisis. Despite these challenges, Georgia\u2019s gross domestic product per \ncapita rose from $916 in 2003 to $4,428 in 2014, although it subsequently declined to $3,789 in \n2015. Even though the International Monetary Fund\u2019s forecast suggests real gross domestic \nproduct growth of only 2.7% in 2016, its forecast is that growth will accelerate to 4.0% in 2017 \nand 5.0% in 2018.2 \n4.  Economic  growth.  Georgia\u2019s  strong  growth,  as  a  result  of  broad  economic  and \ninstitutional reforms since 2003, has not delivered commensurate declines in unemployment \nand poverty. Infrastructure gaps, agricultural stagnation, and an entrenched skills mismatch in \nthe  labor  market  have  dampened  the  impact  of  growth  on  poverty  reduction.  The  official \nunemployment rate rose from 11.5% in 2003 to 16.9% in 2009, before moderating to 12.4% in \n2014. The percentage of the population living below the relative poverty line declined from \n24.9% in 2004 to 21.4% in 2013. The Gini coefficient in 2014 remained high at 0.41, reflecting \nthe concentration of income growth in urban areas and among the top 10% of income earners. \nGeorgians living in small towns and engaging in smallholder agriculture have gained little from \nthe overall improvement in the economy since 2003. \n5.  Despite recent slower growth, the economic outlook is positive. Key areas contributing to \nthe economy are services (led by trade, tourism, and transport), manufacturing, construction, \nand mining. The government\u2019s  \u201cSocioeconomic  Development  Strategy  of  Georgia (Georgia \n2020)\u201d targets inclusive economic growth by ensuring macroeconomic stability and effective \npublic administration, improving private sector competitiveness, developing human capital, and \nincreasing access to finance.3 \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  International Monetary Fund.

Tbilisi. \n ", "2 \n6.  ADB  Assistance  and  Government  Sector  Strategy.  The  proposed  project  was \nincluded in the country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 and is fully aligned with Georgia 2020, \nwith transport as one of the priority sectors.4 The project is designed to address internal and \nregional market connectivity  issues by improving social conditions and providing economic \nopportunities in smaller towns and cities, stimulating investment, job creation, and incomes \nwhere  these  are  needed  the  most.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project \npreparatory technical assistance for the Secondary Road Improvement Project (TA 8411-GEO), \nwhich was completed in 2015. \n7.  Road transport is the country\u2019s principal means of transport. In 2009, ADB approved the \nmultitranche financing facility for the Road Corridor Investment Program of $500 million, mainly \nto assist the government in upgrading two key sections of the country\u2019s principal road corridor, \nthe East\u2013West Highway.5 This is the main international transport corridor that traverses all the \nmajor cities  of Georgia. The  East-West  Highway  constitutes  a  portion  of  the  Central  Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation program road corridors (Georgia joined the program in 2016). \nThe  government  has  prioritized  East\u2013West  Highway  Corridor  investments  to  ensure \nimprovements in connectivity to global markets. About half of the country\u2019s population relies on \nsecondary roads as they live in villages and smaller towns, and 75% of these people derive their \nlivelihoods from agriculture. A reliable transport network, both primary and secondary, is needed \nto alleviate the poverty disparities among the country\u2019s regions, particularly in the rural areas \nserved by the secondary road network. Improved secondary roads lead to reduced costs of \naccess to markets and services and increased access for the poor and isolated regions, and \ngenerate direct employment opportunities linking jobs with people. \n8.  Improvement Needs. There is a need to improve connectivity to remote poor areas. \nThe proposed project has been designed to address these challenges. It will focus on about 50 \nkm of a secondary road in central Georgia that provides access to about 23,000 people living in \nthe municipality of Kharagauli, and an additional 7,000 people in the 13 villages along the road \nalignment. The project road connects Kharagauli to the East\u2013West Highway, which is subject to \noccasional  closure  because  of  landslides,  in  which  event  the  project  road  provides  an \nalternative road for traffic using the highway. In future, the project road could serve as an \nalternative route, as required by Georgian legislation, in the event that the parallel section of the \nEast\u2013West Highway is to be tolled. \n9.  The  project  road  has  deteriorated  considerably  and  many  sections  of  it  are  now \nirreparable and impassable during rain and snow. This clearly suppresses the development of \nthe poor region that the road serves. Villages along the road are not accessible during winter \nand are suffering from substantial out-migration and lack of employment opportunities. The poor \ncondition of the road also prevents emergency vehicles from accessing the villages during most \nadverse weather conditions. \n10.  This area has the highest regional poverty level of any region in the country. The project \nwill help alleviate isolation of rural communities in this area, strengthen domestic trade, and \nexpand opportunities for more inclusive economic growth. Upgrading of the road to an all-\nweather standard will provide better opportunities of the local population to sell their products \nand better access to social facilities such as schools and medical services. The improved road \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2014. Country Partnership Strategy: Georgia, 2014\u20132018. Manila. \n5  ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to Georgia for the Road Corridor Investment Program. Manila. \n ", "3 \nwill also facilitate access to the nearby Borjomi\u2013Kharagauli National Park and Nunisi Health \nResort, resulting in new opportunities for tourism development in the region. \n11.  Preservation of Road Assets and Sustainability of the Secondary Road Network. \nThe existing road will be improved to two-lane all-weather standard to the extent possible within \nthe existing road formation to minimize land acquisition and resettlement. Because the existing \nroad is located on a narrow bench between a cliff face, a river, and a railway, substantial \nwidening and realignment would be both difficult and expensive. The railway is located in the \nsame corridor for almost the entire length of the project road, which provides the opportunity for \nthe road and the railway to act together as a multimodal transport corridor through the project \narea.  The  project  will  also  improve  connectivity  and  reliability  of  the  transport  network  by \nreviving the road\u2019s role as an alternative in the event that the parallel section of the East\u2013West \nHighway is closed. \n12.  Looking at the secondary road network more generally, the proportion of Georgia\u2019s \nsecondary roads in good and fair condition increased from 30% in 2004 to around 60% in 2015 \nas  a  result  of  major  rehabilitation  efforts  since  2004.  About  one-third  of  the  rehabilitated \nsecondary roads were financed by the World Bank during 2004\u20132015 and the remaining portion \nwas financed by the government. While the annual state budget for 2015 allocated about $300 \nmillion for improvement of the country\u2019s international and secondary roads, there is still a \nsecondary road rehabilitation backlog and also a need to preserve the recently improved road \nassets. Generally, routine maintenance, including winter maintenance, remains underfunded. \nExpenditure on routine maintenance for both international and secondary roads averages $17 \nmillion per year, which represents less than $2,500 per km per year and is less than the \ninternational comparator range of $4,000\u2013$8,000 per km. Ensuring that recent improvements in \nimplementation of maintenance are sustained is a major challenge for the government. The \nWorld Bank is continuing its support to the Roads Department with integrating a road asset \nmanagement system,6 road safety, and climate resilience planning practices in a multiyear \nprogramming and annual planning process.7 \n13.  Development  Coordination. The proposed project will complement the work being \ndone  by  development  partners  and  ADB  under  the  2009  multitranche  financing  facility  to \ndevelop the capacity of the Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure (MRDI) and \nRoads  Department  for  effective  sector  management,  and  in  particular  operation  and \nmaintenance of the country\u2019s road network. Institutional capacity will be strengthened through \nconsultancy  services  financed  by  the  project  and  continuous  cooperation  with  other \ndevelopment  partners.  The  government  is  committed  to  providing  the  funding  required  to \nmaintain the road in a sustainable manner. Development partners have jointly conducted policy \ndialogue to improve road maintenance and enhance the sustainability of road networks. Such \nefforts have been focused on three main areas: (i) increasing the fiscal budget allocation for \nroad maintenance, (ii) reconstructing and rehabilitating international and secondary roads in \npoor  condition  and  thereby  reducing  overall  demand  for  road  maintenance  funding,  and \n(iii) spending the fiscal budget allocated for road maintenance more efficiently. Further, in the \nevent that the East\u2013West Highway is tolled, the revenues from the tolling can be used for \nmaintenance of the project road to ensure the sustainability of the project. Future projects \nprogrammed  for  the  sector  will  continue  this  development,  reflecting  the  intention  of  the \n                                                \n6  The road asset management system is a tool for the analysis, planning, management, budgeting, and appraisal of \nroad maintenance meeting the targets set, such as the average condition of the road network as an example. \n7  This process will be carried out under the World Bank\u2019s Secondary Road Asset Management Project, which was \napproved on 18 March 2016 and will be implemented during 2017\u20132022. \n ", "4 \ngovernment  and  ADB  that  all  operations  in  the  transport  sector  exist  within  a  common \nframework. \n14.  Lessons Learned. The programs implemented under previous ADB country strategies \nhave been found to have addressed the country\u2019s needs. Operations that were completed have \nbeen successful, and ongoing operations are likely to achieve their goals. Responding to the \nrecommendations  provided  by  the  country  strategy  final  review  and  ADB\u2019s  Independent \nEvaluation Department\u2019s Validation Report of the Final Review  of Country Operations, the \ncountry partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 includes a sharper focus on infrastructure for inclusive \ngrowth,  for  example  by  targeting  secondary  roads  and  smaller  towns  in  poorer  regions.8 \nAdditionally, lessons from earlier operations include the need to address in future operations \n(i) a lack of preparedness before project start-up; (ii) poorly defined terms of reference for \ndetailed design and construction supervision consultants; and (iii) weak project management \ncapacity of the government agencies responsible for the operation, including in the critical areas \nof contract management and safeguards. \n15.  These lessons have been reflected in the project design by (i) conducting advance \ncontracting actions and undertaking a careful review of the terms of reference for detailed \ndesign and construction supervision consultants; (ii) providing guidance and practical support to \nthe executing and implementing agencies on ADB policies, guidelines, and procedures on \nenvironmental  protection,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  procurement;  and \n(iii) preparing technical designs that are much closer to final designs so cost estimates and \ncontract periods are more reliable, and subsequent contract prices and overall project costs are \nless subject to unexpected and often large cost increases. For this project, adverse impacts \narising from delays in land acquisition have been minimized by designing the road to the extent \npossible to follow the existing alignment, and also through the extensive consultation with \ncommunities in the project area. The consultations will continue during the detailed design and \nproject implementation activities. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n16.  The project impact will be aligned with the increased economic activity in the Kharagauli \nmunicipality and surrounding regions and national connectivity. The outcome will be increased \nmobility and accessibility of the residents of Kharagauli municipality and tourists visiting the \nproject area by reducing vehicle operating costs and providing time savings for road users. \nC.  Output \n17.  The  project\u2019s  output  will  be  about  50  km  of  improved  road  between  Dzirula  and \nChumateleti, including several short access roads to the nearby national park and to Kharagauli \nand other railway stations. \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n18.  The project is estimated to cost $93.8 million (Table 1). \n   \n                                                \n8  Independent Evaluation Department. 2013.

The government has requested a regular loan of $80 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  13  years;  an  annual  interest rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year \n(the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan); and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line method, \nthe average maturity is 18.75 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.20% per \nyear. The government will contribute $13.8 million to cover taxes, land, and resettlement costs. \nThe financing plan is in Table 2. \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank \n  Ordinary capital resources (regular loan)  80.0  85.3 \nGovernment  13.8  14.7 \n  Total  93.8  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n20.  Climate adaptation is estimated to cost $9.0 million. ADB will finance 83.1% of such \ncosts. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The executing agency will be the MRDI, which is responsible for planning, designing, \nand maintaining of all international and secondary roads in the country. It is currently the \nexecuting agency for the ongoing multitranche financing facility and has a sound understanding \nof ADB policies and procedures. The Roads Department, an agency under the MRDI, will be the \nimplementing agency. In order to improve the project readiness, the detailed design of the \nproposed project has been divided into two sections (one design for both civil works contracts) \nwhich  will  expedite  the  procurement  of  the  first  civil  works  contract.  The  implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project administration \nmanual (PAM).9 \n \n                                                \n9  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  April 2017\u2013August 2021 \nEstimated completion date  31 August 2021 (estimated loan closing date: 28 February 2022) \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Ministry of Finance \nDeputy minister (chair) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure of Georgia \n(iii) Implementing agency  Roads Department \nProcurement  International competitive  2 civil works  $70.00 million \nbidding  contracts \nConsulting services:  Quality- and cost-based  1 contract: 547  $4.00 million  \nconstruction supervision  selection  person-months \nConsulting services:  Individual consultants  100 person-months  $0.10 million \nsafeguards  selection  (national) \nConsulting services: project  Individual consultants  100 person-months  $0.35 million \nsupport  selection  (national) \nConsulting services:  Least-cost selection  National  $0.05 million \nfinancial audit \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advance contracting and retroactive financing will be applied for civil \nadvance contracting  works  and  consulting  services  for  construction  supervision.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n22.  The technical due diligence is based on the project\u2019s feasibility study. For the main road \nalignment, the completed road\u2019s cross section will typically be traffic lanes of 2.0 meters (m) by \n3.0  m  with  0.5  m  surfaced  shoulders  and  0.5\u20131.0  m  unpaved  shoulders  on  both  sides. \nThis complies with the Georgian standard for roads of this category. The national park and \nrailway station access roads will be designed to a standard appropriate for their intended \npurpose, with gravel pavements, considering the terrain through which they pass. \n23.  The project road\u2019s main alignment will follow the existing alignment for most of its length \nbecause of terrain considerations and also to minimize land acquisition. The design speed will \ntypically be 40 km per hour, which is appropriate for a road of this class in the terrain through \nwhich it passes. Appropriate lane widening will be applied on low radius curves to allow the safe \npassage of the larger trucks and buses that are expected to use the road. \n24.  The  road\u2019s  main  alignment  will  have  a  flexible  pavement  with  asphaltic  concrete \nsurfacing.  The  pavement  structure  will  be  designed  using  an  appropriate  internationally \nrecognized design method based on traffic projected to use the road over a 20-year period \nfollowing project completion, from 2020 to 2039, assuming a mid-period asphaltic concrete \noverlay to provide the additional strength required for traffic loading for the latter part of the \n ", "7 \nroad\u2019s service life.10 The pavement design, under the detailed engineering design contract, will \ntake into account the harsh climatic conditions that prevail in the project area, specifically heavy \nsnowfalls. The design will give particular attention to drainage and to pavement damage arising \nfrom the operations of snow-clearing equipment. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n25.  Economic. The project has an economic internal rate of return of 12.6%, with a net \npresent value of $2.3 million at a 12.0% discount rate. The principal benefits are reduced \nvehicle operating costs, reduced travel time, and reduced maintenance costs compared with the \nwithout-project  situation,  together  resulting  in  increased  regional  and  local  trade  and  road \nsafety. Additional benefits from the road providing a bypass for when the parallel East\u2013West \nHighway is closed, which have not been evaluated, would improve the economic merit of the \nproject. \n26.  With respect to maintenance, the project\u2019s economic and financial analysis has assumed \nthat maintenance costs will be $1,300 per km on average.11 This is assessed to be adequate for \nthe  road  type  and  traffic  loading.  In  addition,  the  analysis  assumes  asphalt  overlays  at \nappropriate intervals during the road\u2019s service life. \n27.  Financial. The MRDI is a general government sector unit and the project is nonrevenue \ngenerating. The financial management assessment undertaken during project preparation, and \nas described in the financial management assessment, assessed the MRDI\u2019s financial capacity \nto sustainably maintain the project. These analyses concluded that the MRDI has sufficient \nfinancial management capacity, within the government\u2019s budgetary procedures, for the recurrent \nexpenditures required for maintaining and operating the project in a sustainable manner. \nC.  Governance \n28.  The above-referenced financial management assessments revealed that both the MRDI \nand the Roads Department have a current and adequate understanding of ADB\u2019s financial \nmanagement policies and implementation procedures as a result of the extensive ongoing ADB-\nsupported operations in the country. The project financial statements will be audited annually by \nan independent auditor. Public disclosure of the project financial statements, including the \nannual  audit  reports  on  the  project  financial  statements,  will  be  guided  by  ADB\u2019s  Public \nCommunications Policy 2011. \n29.  A procurement risk assessment was prepared in accordance with the Guidelines for \nAssessing Country, Sector, and Procurement Risks.12 The Roads Department is fully staffed \nand functional and is currently implementing projects financed by ADB, European Investment \nBank, Japan International Cooperation Agency, and World Bank. The Roads Department strictly \nfollows  ADB  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  bidding \nprocedures in procurement of works contracts and ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  in  recruiting  consulting  services  financed  by  ADB. \nThe  assessment  concluded  that  the  Roads  Department  has  adequate  capacity  to  ensure \nsuccessful procurement and implementation of the project. ADB\u2019s fiduciary risks have been \n                                                \n10 The feasibility study pavements were designed using the internationally recognized American Association of State \nHighway and Transportation Officials\u2019 design method. \n11 Economic and Financial Analysis (available from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12 ADB. 2015.

Overall, there is no \nexpected immediate risk to the proposed project\u2019s procurement that would require mitigation. \n30.  ADB\u2019s  Integrity  Principles  and  Guidelines, 13  and  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date), were explained to and discussed with the government, the MRDI, and the \nRoads  Department.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. \nD.  Poverty and Social \n31.  Based on the social impact assessment undertaken during the project\u2019s feasibility study, \nthe project promotes inclusive growth by targeting two regions\u2014one (Shida Kartli) with the \nhighest poverty rate in the country (59.4%) and the other (Imereti) significantly poverty affected \n(19.1%); the national average is 9.4%.14 All residents (approximately 30,000) along the project \nroad will benefit from an all-weather road, shorter travel times, reduced vehicle operation costs, \nand  improved  traffic  safety  with  improvement  of  the  project  road.  This  will  be  particularly \nbeneficial for the project area, which is subject to harsh weather conditions, including heavy \nsnowfalls  during  winter.  Access  to markets for  the  producers  of  agricultural goods  will  be \nenhanced, as will access to the nearby Borjomi\u2013Kharagauli National Park and the health resort \nat  Nunisi.  The  project  will  also  provide  job  opportunities  for  the  local  communities  during \nconstruction.  However,  there  are  also  adverse  impacts  such  as  physical  and  economic \ndisplacement of households because of acquisition of land, but these are relatively minor.15 \n32.  The  project  is  categorized  as  some  gender  elements.  The  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement plan (LARP) includes households headed by women as a vulnerable group and \nadditional assistance will be afforded to these affected persons. Provisions in the construction \ncontract will ensure equal pay for equal work. The entrepreneurship training for 100 persons of \nwhom 50% are women will be provided during the project implementation. In addition, road \nsafety awareness campaigns for communities with 50% of women and girls will be organized \nduring the project implementation. It is also likely that benefits to women and girls will be \nrealized after project completion through outcomes such as increased access (i.e., greater \npublic transport frequency, travel speed, days per year accessible) to schools, medical facilities, \nand markets. Two focus group (each with at least 8 women) discussions towards project end \nwill be conducted to assess whether the project has reduced women's time, poverty and/or \nimproved the quality of their lives.   \nE.  Safeguards \n33.  ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) applies to the project. \n34.  Resettlement. The project is classified category B for involuntary resettlement. Based \non the detailed inventory prepared during the feasibility study, 305 land parcels comprising 803 \npeople will be affected by mostly small-scale land acquisition. Total private land to be acquired \nis 7.2 hectares. There are 15 uninhabited households to be physically relocated or dismantled, \nand 50 households, comprising 135  people, will be severely affected (physically displaced \nand/or losing 10% or more of income-producing assets). The project\u2019s draft LARP was prepared \nin 2015. Given that civil works will be implemented in two separate contracts, two final LARPs \n(one for each contract) will be prepared during the detailed designs of the project.

A grievance redress mechanism will be established once the first final \nupdated LARP is available following the completion of the detailed design process. The Roads \nDepartment,  which  is  experienced  in  implementing  land  acquisition  under  ADB-financed \nprojects and has the required technical capacity, will be responsible for planning, implementing, \nand monitoring the LARPs. \n35.  Environment. The project is not anticipated to cause significant adverse environmental \nimpacts and has been classified category B for the environment in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. An initial environmental examination has been prepared to meet \nthe  requirements  of  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  and  this  includes  an  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP).  The  recommended  environmental  mitigation  measures  and \nmonitoring activities set out in the EMP cover the preconstruction, construction, and operation \nstages of the project. The Roads Department has a division for resettlement and environmental \nprotection,  managed  by  a  division  head.  The  division  has  two  safeguards  units,  one  for \nenvironment and the other for resettlement. Both units are well staffed with several specialists \nfor ongoing donor-funded projects. The environment unit has one specialist dedicated to ADB \nprojects. The Roads Department will be assisted by the construction supervision consultant\u2019s \nenvironmental  specialists  during  project  implementation.  The  EMP,  which  also  defines  the \ninstitutional arrangements and responsibilities for implementation of the plan, will be included in \nthe bidding documents and in the ensuing contracts. The contractors will be required to prepare \nsite-specific EMPs before commencing construction. The initial environmental examination will \nbe updated during the detailed design of the project. \n36.  Indigenous peoples. There are no indigenous peoples as defined in the Safeguard \nPolicy Statement in the project area, and the project is classified category C for indigenous \npeoples. \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n37.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.16 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nDelayed procurement of detailed  Detailed  design  and  procurement  documentation  is  being \ndesign may affect timeliness of  prepared under separate financing, and will be completed by \nprocurement of civil works.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n38.  The government and the MRDI have assured ADB that implementation of the project will \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n39.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are \nset forth in the loan agreement. \n40.  With respect to land acquisition and resettlement, the government and ADB have agreed \nthat no civil works contract will be awarded until not less than 50% of all land acquisition and \nresettlement required for that contract, based on land area as set out in the project\u2019s approved \nLARP, have been completed, and all project-affected people in this part of the LARP have been \ncompensated in accordance with the provisions of the LARP. This condition is reflected in the \nproject\u2019s loan agreement. \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n41.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$80,000,000 to Georgia for the Secondary Road Improvement Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 24 years, including a \ngrace  period  of  13  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n8 March 2017 \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nIncreased  economic  activity  in  the  Kharagauli  municipality  and  surrounding  regions  and  national  connectivity \n\u201cSocioeconomic Development Strategy of Georgia (Georgia 2020)\u201d.a \n  Performance Indicators with Targets  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By 2022:     \nImproved efficiency  a.
