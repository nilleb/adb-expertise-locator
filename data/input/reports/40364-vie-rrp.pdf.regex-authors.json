They are intended to improve the quality \nof the environment and the living standards of rural communities. \nThe benefits of the subprojects include an increase in the number \nof houses connected to clean and reliable water for drinking and \nsanitation, a reduction in or elimination of flooding and stagnation \nof  wastewater,  and  better  personal  sanitation.  The  potential \nadverse  environmental  impacts  associated  with  design, \nconstruction, and operation of the subprojects will mostly be small \nand  localized  and  can  be  readily  mitigated  through  proper \nengineering  design  and  implementation  of  the  mitigation  and \nmonitoring  measures  identified  in  the  initial  environmental \nexaminations.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework has been prepared for future subprojects. \n   \nProject Description  The project will increase access to water supply and sanitation, \nimproving the health and quality of life of the rural population in six \nselected provinces in the central coastal region of Viet Nam. The \nproject  will  support  the  government  in  implementing  its \nSocioeconomic  Development  Plan,  2006\u20132010,  including \nreducing  poverty  to  10%\u201311%  of  households  by  2010.  In  so \ndoing,  it  will  help  the  government  to  achieve  the  Vietnamese \nMillennium Development Goals.  \n \nThe project will provide piped water and hygienic sanitation to \nabout  350,000  people  living  in  rural  areas.  The  project  has  a \nstrong poverty focus and its design is based on lessons from \nprevious interventions in the sector. The implementation will follow \na  community-based  approach  and  will  focus  on  (i)  improving \nhygienic behavior, (ii) strengthening operation and maintenance of \nthe water supply works, and (iii) monitoring and evaluation of the \noutputs  and  impacts  of  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation \ninvestments.  \n   ", "ii   \nRationale  In  2006,  about  46%  of  the  rural  population  of  Viet  Nam  had \naccess to clean water, although at quantities barely sufficient to \nsupport their basic needs and not continuously throughout the \nyear. About 83% of the population had latrines, but only 48% of \nthese  could  be  considered  hygienic.  About  37%  of  the  rural \npopulation still practiced open defecation. In 2006, about 72% of \npublic schools had latrines but only 12% of them were hygienic. \nOnly 21% of commune health centers had latrines.  \n \nKnowledge of individual sanitation was still poor. In 2006 only \n2.3% of the rural population knew that hand washing with soap \nmay  prevent  some  communicable  diseases,  and  only  13%  of \nhouseholds and 11% of the students washed their hands with \nsoap before meals and after urination or defecation.  \n \nBetter access to clean water and hygienic sanitation will improve \npublic health. This in turn will reduce poverty by reducing medical \nexpenses and productive days lost. In addition, the project will \nalso reduce the burden on woman and girls, who are traditionally \ntasked with water collection and caring for sick family members. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  impact  of  the  project  will  be  improved  health  and  living \nconditions of people living in rural areas in the project provinces. \nThe project will contribute to the National Rural Water Supply and \nSanitation Strategy to 2020, which states that, by 2020, 100% of \nthe rural population will (i) have access to clean water, with a \nminimum volume of 60 liters per capita per day, (ii) use hygienic \nlatrines, and (iii) practice proper personal hygiene. \n \nThe outcome will be access to clean water and hygienic sanitation \nfor  about  350,000  people  living  in  rural  areas  in  about  30 \ncommunes  in  the  six  project  provinces  in  the  central  coastal \nregion of Viet Nam: Binh Dinh, Ha Tinh, Nghe An, Quang Binh, \nQuang Nam, and Thanh Hoa.  \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the project is estimated at $50 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $4.4 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  Tentative Financing Plan \n($ million) \n      Share of \nSource  Total  Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank      45.00    90.00 \nGovernment      2.63    5.27 \nBeneficiaries      2.37    4.73 \n  Total    50.00   100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The  loan  will  be  granted  by  the  government  to  the  provincial \nTerms  people's committees of the six project provinces. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  01 October 2010 \u2212 30 June 2017 ", "  iii\n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2016 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) \n   \nImplementation  A central project management unit will be established within the \nArrangements  National Center for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation of MARD \nto coordinate project implementation. The provincial Departments \nof  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  will  set  up  a  provincial \nproject  management  unit.  The  provincial  Viet  Nam  women\u2019s \nunions will be responsible for managing the revolving funds for \nsanitation  improvement.  At  the  commune  level,  water  and \nsanitation commune committees will be established and sanitation \nand health promoters identified to ensure community participation \nin  project  implementation  and  implement  hygiene  awareness \nactivities. \n   \nProcurement  Goods, works, and services financed by the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). All \nprocurement  contracts  will  contain  anticorruption  provisions  as \nspecified by ADB. Procurement will generally be carried out by the \nPPMUs and supported by the international consultant. Civil works \nabove  $2,000,000  or  goods  above  $500,000  will  be  procured \nthrough international competitive bidding. Civil works with value of \n$2,000,000 or less and goods with value of $500,000 or less, will \nbe procured through national competitive bidding. Civil works and \ngoods with value of $100,000 or less will be procured through \nshopping. Civil works contracts for household sanitation with a \ntotal value of $5,000 or less can be procured at the commune \nlevel and will follow community participation in procurement in \naccordance  with  ADB's  procedures  for  implementing  small \nprojects with community participation.  \n   \nConsulting Services  Consultants will be recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nConsulting services will include the following packages: (i) general \nproject  management;  (ii)  technical  design  and  procurement \nservices; (iii) preparation of safeguard documents; (iv) community \nmobilization  and  information,  education,  and  communication \nimplementation; and (v) capacity building of water supply system \noperators.  Consulting  firms  will  be  recruited  to  provide  these \nservices, at a total of 1,497 person-months, of which 285 person-\nmonths  will  be  for  international  specialists  and  1,212  person-\nmonths for national specialists. The consulting services will be \nacquired through the quality- and cost-based selection method. \nThe technical proposals will be given a weight of 80% and the \nfinancial proposals 20%. ADB's Procurement Guidelines will be \napplicable  throughout  the  consulting  services.  The  assets \npurchased will be handed over to MARD upon completion of the \n ", "iv   \nproject.  \n \nADB's management has approved advance recruitment of consulting \nservices. The government has been advised that approval of the \nadvance action and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to \nfinance the project, and that the action should be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  In the subproject areas, all the households will be provided with \nBeneficiaries  clean water and sanitation services in an equitable and affordable \nmanner.  The  project  will  provide  access  to  clean  water  and \nhygiene  sanitation  facilities  to  approximately  350,000  people, \nabout 27% of whom live in poverty, compared with 16% in Viet \nNam as a whole. Access to clean water and sanitation at the \nhousehold level is expected to improve public health, especially \nchild health, and to reduce medical expenditure. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The potential risks are: (i) poor households may not be able to \nafford water tariffs that will provide full cost recovery; (ii) local \ngovernment agencies may not be able to implement community-\nbased approaches and gender strategies, or may resist doing so; \n(iii) implementation of information, education, and communication \nmaterials may take a traditional top-down approach instead of \nintensive community mobilization; (iv) women, poor people, and \nmembers of ethnic minorities may be marginalized in the decision \nmaking  and  planning  of  water  and  sanitation  facilities  at  the \ncommunity  level;  (v)  beneficiaries  may  not  adopt  hygienic \nbehavior,  which  may  reduce  some  benefits  of  the  project; \n(vi) water supply facilities may not be sustainable because of low \nwater  tariffs  and  improper  operation  and  maintenance.  Risk \nmitigation measures are integrated into the project design. \n \nThe  main  assumptions  are  that  the  government  (i)  remains \ncommitted  to  the  rural  water  supply  sector  and  continues  to \nprovide counterpart funding, (ii) is willing to learn from the lessons \nof previous interventions in the sector, and (iii) makes available \nsufficient staff for project planning and implementation at central \nand provincial level. It is furthermore assumed that all eligible \ncommunities  agree  to  actively  participate  in  project \nimplementation. \n ", "Dien Bien Son La Vinh Yen Bac Giang 108o  00\u2019E\nPhu Cam Pha\nHA NOI\nHoa Binh Ha Long\nHai\nHai Phong\nHung Yen Duong\nPhu Ly\nThai Binh\nNinh Binh\nLAO PEOPLE'S\n20 o 00\u2019N DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC THANH 20 o 00\u2019N\nHOA Thanh Hoa\nThai Hoa\nNGHE AN Dien Chau\nVinh\nHa Tinh\nSOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIET NAM HA TINH\nCENTRAL REGION\nRURAL WATER SUPPLY AND\nQUANG BINH\nSANITATION SECTOR PROJECT\nDong Hoi\nDong Ha\nN\nHue\n0 50 100 150 Da Nang\nHoi An\nKilometers\nQUANG Tam Ky\nNAM\nProject Province\nNational Capital Quang Ngai\nProvincial Capital\nCity/Town Kon Tum\nNational Road\nBong Son\nOther Road\nBINH DINH\nRailway\no River o\n14  00\u2019N Pleiku 14  00\u2019N\nProvincial Boundary Quy Nhon\nInternational Boundary\nCAMBODIA\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\nTuy Hoa\n09 Buon Ma\n-3 Thuot\n1\n2\n6 H 103o  00\u2019E 108o  00\u2019E Ninh Hoa\nR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Central Region Rural Water Supply and Sanitation \nSector Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  The project will contribute to the achievement of the key goals of the ADB country \nstrategy  and  program  (CSP),1  2007\u22122010:  promoting  socially  equitable  and  balanced \ndevelopment,  sustainable  environmental  management,  and  stronger  institutions.  It  will  also \nsupport  the  major  targets  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  (SEDP), \n2006\u22122010,2 including  reducing  the  poverty  rate  to  10%\u221211%.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  average  gross \ndomestic product growth of 7.8% per year between 2002 and 2007 reduced its overall poverty \nrate from 28.9% to 16.0%. However, the poverty rate in the rural areas (where 72% of the \npeople live) is still 20.4%. The framework for all poverty reduction activities in Viet Nam is the \nComprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy,3 which recognizes that access to \nclean and safe water and hygienic latrines4 is one of the preconditions for poverty reduction, \nparticularly for Viet Nam's rural population.  \n \n3.  In 2006, about 46% of the rural population had access to clean water, although at \nquantities barely sufficient to support basic needs and not continuously throughout the year. \nAbout 83% of the population had latrines, but only 48% of these could be considered hygienic. \nAbout 37% of the rural population still practiced open defecation. In 2006, about 72% of the \npublic schools had latrines but only 12% of them were hygienic, while only 21% of commune \nhealth centers had latrines.  \n \n4.  Knowledge of individual sanitation was still poor. In 2006 only 2.3% of rural population \nknew that hand washing with soap may prevent some communicative diseases, and only 13% \nof households and 11% of students washed their hands with soap before meals and after \nurination or defecation.  \n \n5.  Better access to clean water and hygienic sanitation will improve public health. In turn, \nthis will reduce poverty by reducing medical expenses and productive days lost. The burden on \nwomen and girls, who are traditionally tasked with water collection and caring for sick family \nmembers, will be reduced. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n6.  Geographic focus.  The central coastal region of Viet Nam consists of 14 provinces and \naccounts for about 30% of the country's total land area. The population is predominantly rural \n(78%). The focus of the proposed project on this region is justified by its high poverty levels, low \nwater supply and sanitation coverage, and the limited availability of suitable water resources. \n \n7.  High poverty levels. As shown in Table 1, the central coastal provinces have higher \npoverty levels than the national average, surpassed only by the northern and central highlands \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007.

Low water supply coverage. \"Clean\" water is defined as water provided by a water \nsource that, by virtue of its design and construction is likely to protect the water from outside \ncontamination, in particular from fecal matter. National availability of clean water in the rural \nareas of Viet Nam in 2006 was estimated to be 46% (Table 2).  \n \nTable 2: Household Water Coverage, 2006 \n(% of population) \n  Private  Public  Deep  Filtered   \nItem  Tap  Standpipe  Well  Spring  Coverage \nNational  18.70  2.60  31.50  2.90  55.70 \n   Urban  52.50  4.70  22.80  0.50  80.50 \n   Rural   5.90  1.80  34.80  3.80  46.30 \nRegion \nRed River Delta  20.10  1.40  51.70  0.10  73.30 \nNorth East   12.60  1.60  10.60  13.20  38.00 \nNorth West   10.60  1.90  2.10  32.00  46.60 \nNorth Central  Coast   8.00  0.80  26.10  1.90  36.80 \nSouth Central  Coast   13.80  3.30  26.70  1.40  45.20 \nCentral Highland   9.90  2.10  4.10  1.90  18.00 \nSouth East   31.60  4.00  38.50  0.20  74.30 \nMekong River Delta   23.00  4.70  24.65  0.27  45.33 \nSource: Viet Nam household living standard survey (2006). \n \n9.  Low sanitation coverage. Table 3 indicates that open defecation is widely practiced in \nthe central coastal provinces.  \n \n10.  Drainage problems. The surface drainage facilities available in some communes are \naffected by a lack of proper facilities for gray wastewater and storm water. This leads to \nstagnant water pools, mosquito breeding, and flooding by contaminated water during rains. \nThese problems are acute in the areas located in the coastal flat terrain, which have high \ngroundwater tables. \n \n11.  Lack of exploitable water sources. The shallow groundwater layers in the central \nregion contain high levels of salinity, turbidity, hardness, fluoride, iron, manganese, aluminum, \nand pollution from human, industrial, and livestock waste. Surface water is often of poor quality \ndue to turbidity, organic matter, and pollution by surface runoff that contains micro-organisms \nand agricultural chemicals. The central coastal provinces have low amounts of exploitable \ngroundwater, so many poor rural households use highly polluted water for their daily needs. \n \n ", "3 \nTable 3: Sanitation Coverage, 2006 \n(%) \n  Households  Households  Households with   \n  with Toilets and  with Pour Flush  Double Vault  Open \nItem  Septic Tanks  Toilets  Composting Toilets  Defecation \nNational  34.30  4.70  20.10  29.90 \n   Urban  73.80  6.10  6.70  10.20 \n   Rural   19.30  4.20  25.10  37.50 \nBy region           \nRed River Delta                41.60  2.60  34.00  19.40 \nNorth East   19.30  2.10  34.90  41.60 \nNorth West   13.30  1.80  10.90  70.30 \nNorth Central  Coast   18.50  3.20  42.10  35.00 \nSouth Central  Coast   39.60  8.20  12.90  38.80 \nCentral Highland   23.20  13.20  4.60  56.50 \nSouth East   66.00  9.00  3.80  19.50 \nMekong River Delta   23.70  3.20  1.80  24.30 \nSource: Viet Nam household living standard survey (2006). \n \n12.  Government strategy and investment plan. Government intervention in the rural water \nsupply and sanitation (RWSS) sector began in 1999 with the development of a national RWSS \nstrategy, which set ambitious coverage targets for 2010 (85% coverage for clean water supply \nand 70% for hygienic latrines) and 2020 (100% coverage for both clean water supply and \nhygienic latrines). At that time, less than 30% of the rural population had access to water that \nmet  basic  hygienic  criteria,  and  less  than  20%  of  rural  households  had  hygienic  latrines. \nInvestment in RWSS was only 10% of the amount needed, and the understanding of good \nhygienic  practices  was  low.  In  addition,  RWSS  programs  were  fragmented,  with  little \ncoordination among ministries and departments, and the legislative environment was weak with \nrespect to regulations and guidelines for managing the sector. A sector analysis is in Appendix 2 \nand an overview of external assistance is in Appendix 3. \n \n13.  In developing the strategy, the importance of RWSS was recognized, as 75% of the \nnational population lives in rural areas. In recognition of the importance of improving the RWSS \nsector, the government made it one of seven national target programs for the period 2001\u20132005 \n(NTP I). An evaluation of NTP I in 2005 revealed that progress had been made5 and assumed \nthat the water supply coverage targets for 2010 and 2020 would be met, provided current \ninvestment  levels  were  maintained.  For  sanitation,  however,  there  was  little  prospect  of \nachieving the planned targets, since the reliance on household finances to build latrines had \ncaused coverage rates of the poor to lag far behind those of better-off households. The review \nalso stressed the importance of targeting government and partner organization support at the \npoorest  populations,  specifically  in  coastal  areas,  where  population  density  is  high  and \nexploitable water supplies are limited. \n \n14.  A second national target program was approved in 2006, covering the period 2006\u20132010 \n(NTP II), which addressed some of the issues identified in the evaluation of NTP I.6 NTP II \ntargets  increasing  access  to  clean  water  for  an  additional  14.7  million  people  and  the \n                                                 \n5  (i) Water supply coverage was extended to 23 million people and 3.7 million more households were using hygienic \nlatrines; (ii) it led to improvement in hygienic practices, and the number of schools, commune health clinics, and \nrural markets with water supply and sanitation facilities increased; (iii) funding sources were diversified; and  \n(iv) legal documents and guidelines were prepared to encourage different economic sectors to invest in the water \nsupply and sanitation sector and to stimulate a diversification of management models. \n6  (i) Improved institutional structure and coordination among stakeholders; (ii) decentralization and building capacity \nfor planning and implementation at provincial and district levels; (iii) development of coherent legal, policy and \nregulatory  settings,  including  increased  involvement  of  communities;  (iv)  greater  focus  on  sanitation  by \nstrengthening information education and communication (IEC) activities as an integral part of any RWSS program; \n(v) greater participation by local communities; and (vi) better monitoring and evaluation of RWSS data. \n ", "4 \nconstruction of hygienic latrines for an additional 2.6 million households. The total national \nbudget for these activities was estimated at $1.4 billion and that for the central coastal region at \n$317 million7 (23%), of which 15% or $48 million is expected to be financed by international \npartner organizations. The remainder will be financed by the central government (14%), local \ngovernment (10%), and beneficiaries (61%). Currently, the government is reviewing the national \nstrategy on RWSS, to be completed by November 2009. Based on the result of this review, it \nwill  be  decided  whether  the  current  5-year  national  target  program  will  be  extended,  or \ndesignated differently. Nevertheless, the national RWSS strategy provides a pragmatic strategic \napproach toward achieving 100% access to safe water and sanitation services in rural areas by \n2020 and it has been adopted by the current project. \n \n15.  Key sector institutions. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) is \nresponsible  for  implementing  the  RWWS  strategy  through  its  provincial  departments  of \nagriculture and rural development (DARDs). Under MARD is a National Center for Rural and \nClean  Water  and  Environmental  Sanitation  (NCERWASS)  to  which  MARD  has  delegated \nresponsibility for RWSS project implementation. At the provincial level, project implementation is \ndelegated  by  DARDs  to  provincial  centers  for  rural  and  clean  water  and  environmental \nsanitation (PCERWASS). The Ministry of Health (MOH), General Department of Preventive \nMedicine and AIDS control is responsible for setting and monitoring drinking water quality \nstandards and for developing public awareness of hygiene and health. The MOH works through \nits provincial departments of health (DOHs) and district and commune health care centers. The \nMinistry of Education and Training (MOET) is responsible for implementing school sanitation \nprograms  through  its  provincial  departments  of  education  and  training  (DOETs).  In  2007, \nMARD, MOH, and MOET signed an interministerial circular on guidelines for implementing and \ncoordinating  the  RWSS  strategy  among  the  three  ministries.  Information,  education,  and \ncommunication (IEC) guidelines issued by NCERWASS recognized the importance of commune \ncommittees and local health promoters in increasing awareness of sanitation and hygiene. Mass \norganizations, such as women\u2019s unions, play important roles in community mobilization and \ninitiating community-based savings or credit groups. \n \n16.  Country strategy and program. The current CSP for Viet Nam aims to support the \ngovernment  in  implementing  its  SEDP,  2006\u20132010  and  reducing  poverty  to  10%\u201311%  of \nhouseholds by 2010. The SEDP has a strong results orientation, with performance indicators \nthat include the Vietnamese Millennium Development Goals. ADB's support for the RWSS \nsector is in line with (i) the government's and ADB's overall goal of poverty reduction, by \nfocusing  on  the  poor  rural  population;  and  (ii)  ADB's  support  for  achieving  the  Viet  Nam \nDevelopment Goals, especially those on improving access to water supply and sanitation. The \nproposed project also supports ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020,8 specifically pillar number II: inclusive \nsocial development. It will provide poor rural communities with access to infrastructure, the lack \nof which is listed as a key constraint on reducing poverty in ADB's country operations business \nplan, 2009\u20132011.9 The proposed project is in line with ADB's continued geographic focus on the \ncentral region, and complements past and ongoing ADB projects10 in this region by building on \nprevious capacity development and infrastructure projects. The proposed project is included in \nthe country operations business plan as a loan project for 2009. \n                                                 \n7  $181 million for water supply, $96 million for sanitation and $40 million for IEC and capacity building. \n8 ADB.  2008.

Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n17.  Budget deficit. Continued support from partner organizations will be needed for the \ngovernment to implement NTP II and achieve the targets set out in the RWSS strategy. This \nstrategy expects an unrealistically high contribution by the beneficiaries to the total budget of \n61%. The budget calculations are based on assumed investment costs of $34 per capita for \nwater supply and $20 per household for sanitation, which is considerably lower than commonly \nused unit prices.11 It is expected that the actual budget will be four to five times higher than this \nand  that  contributions  from  partner  organizations  eight  to  ten  times  higher  than  current \nestimates will be required. When it reviews the strategy, the government will address this issue \nby preparing a more detailed budget estimate and financing plan. Without increased support \nfrom partner organizations, the RWSS targets will not be achieved.   \n \n18.  Need for piped water supply systems. The government has recognized the need for \npiped water supply systems to be constructed in areas where access to clean water sources is \nlimited, because of the pollution of shallow groundwater and water scarcity. The RWSS strategy \nstresses the importance of promoting piped water supply systems, while the NTP II calls for the \nconstruction of 4,900 new piped water supply schemes nationwide. The government's policy is \nto provide these schemes without charge in areas where the population is predominantly poor, \nprovided the systems will create sufficient revenues to be operated in a sustainable manner. \n \n19.  Limited focus on sanitation improvement. Sanitation has been widely neglected by \nthe  existing  planning  and  implementation  system,  so  achievement  of  national  targets  on \nsanitation is behind schedule. In rural areas, sanitation is often limited to the construction of \nhousehold  latrines,  normally  regarded  to  be  the  responsibility  of  households  themselves. \nHousehold, public and school latrine programs have received limited attention from political \nleaders. The project will support subprojects that include sanitation improvements as well as \nwater supply.  \n \n20.  Limited knowledge of the benefits of hygienic practices. Although the provision of \nlatrines and sanitation infrastructure brings improved health and environmental outcomes, these \nare significantly increased when beneficiaries are exposed to IEC programs on household \nsanitation practices that improve their awareness of the relationship between water, sanitation, \nand hygiene. In addition, considerable health and environmental improvements can be achieved \nby providing public and school latrines and better drainage systems, all supported by specific \nIEC programs.  \n \n21.  Many IEC materials have been developed in Viet Nam. Supported by various partner \norganizations, the government has made an inventory of the materials available, which have \nbeen evaluated and placed in the public domain for easy reference.12 In 2003, the government \npublished  an  implementation  guideline  on  IEC,  introducing  the  concept  of  a  community \nresponsive approach.13  \n \n22.  The main lessons learned from previous IEC programs in Viet Nam are that (i) allocated \nbudgets too small to implement complete IEC programs, including evaluation of impacts; (ii) IEC \nprograms  are  implemented  on  a  short-term  basis  only  and  are  discontinued  following  the \ncompletion  of  construction  of  associated  works;  (iii)  IEC  programs  should  be  extended  to \n                                                 \n11 $80\u2013$100 per capita for water supply and $100\u2013$150 per household for sanitation. \n12 NCERWASS, supported by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and Plan International. More than 500 \ndocuments were collected and made accessible through an electronic library. \n13 NCERWASS supported by UNICEF and the Danish International Development Assistance. \n ", "6 \ninclude behavioral change communication components, and (iv) IEC programs are effective if \ndesigned specifically for local awareness and education levels, and for specific socioeconomic \nsituations. The project has allocated an ample budget to support IEC activities over an extended \nperiod of time. These programs will be designed specifically for each subproject following a \nknowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP)14 assessment by the consultants. \n \n23.  Insufficient  community  participation.  The  project  will  be  implemented  using  the \ncommunity-based approach (CBA) which will complement the traditional top\u2013down approach of \nthe government. The population will be actively involved in all phases of the project cycle. \nImplementation of IEC activities is an effective way to start CBA by raising awareness and \ncreating demand for services. Follow-up activities will focus on giving the communities control \nover planning decisions and investment resources, based on principles of local empowerment, \nparticipatory governance, demand-responsiveness, administrative autonomy, greater downward \naccountability, and enhanced local capacity.  \n \n24.  Lack of consistent sector data. RWSS sector-based data, including coverage rates, is \ninconsistent  and  unreliable.  The  data  are  provided  by  different  agencies,  using  different \ndefinitions and with limited capacity to carry out comprehensive surveys. Under NTP II, the \ngovernment approved a new monitoring and evaluation (M&E) program that includes eight \nsector-level indicators and six program-level indicators. The project will adopt these indicators \nas  part  of  the  project  performance  management  system,  the  implementation  of  which  by \nprovincial and district governments will be supported through a series of workshops.  \n \n25.  Improved sustainability of water supply systems. The sustainability of water supply \nsystems depends on effective operation and management of the system and the affordability \nand willingness of the beneficiaries to pay. The project will support intensive and continuous \ntraining of managers and operators of the water supply systems in setting water tariffs that are \nhigh enough to recover full costs, following the government's guidelines.15 However, the tariffs \nshould be affordable and full cost recovery should not be an excuse for inefficient operation of \nthe water supply system. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n26.  The impact of the project will be better health and living conditions of people living in \nrural areas in the project provinces. The project will contribute to the RWSS strategy, which \nstates that, by 2020, 100% of the rural population will (i) have access to clean water, with a \nminimum volume of 60 liters per capita per day; (ii) use hygienic latrines; and (iii) practice proper \npersonal hygiene. The project is designed as a sector investment project. It meets the criteria \nfor sector lending since: (i) the RWSS strategy forms a solid basis for project implementation,  \n(ii)  NCERWASS  has  proven  capacity  to  implement  RWSS  projects,  and  (iii)  the  policies \napplicable to the water and sanitation sector are appropriate. \n \n27.  The outcome will be access to clean water and hygienic sanitation for about 350,000 \nrural people in about 30 communes in the six project provinces in the central coastal region of \nViet Nam: Binh Dinh, Ha Tinh, Nghe An, Quang Binh, Quang Nam, and Thanh Hoa. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n                                                 \n14 Understanding the levels of KAP will enable a more efficient process of awareness creation as it will allow the \nprogram to be tailored more appropriately to the needs of the community. \n15 Circular No. 100 /2009/TT-BTC (tariff framework), issued by MOF on 20 May 2009. \n ", "7 \n28.  Selection of project provinces. The selection of the six project provinces was based \non: (i) the poverty level, (ii) the size of the rural population, (iii) the number of rural residents with \naccess to clean water and hygienic latrines, and (iv) the percentage of ethnic minorities. In \naddition to these quantifiable criteria, two more selection criteria were applied: (v) the access to \nsuitable surface and shallow groundwater sources, and (vi) the capacity of local government to \nimplement the proposed project. The six selected provinces have large poor rural populations \nand large ethnic minority populations.16  \n \n29.  Subproject  selection.  The  project  design  is  based  on  a  detailed  analysis  of  six \nsubprojects,  one  in  each  project  province.  The  subprojects  include  communes  that  are \nrepresentative of others in terms of their socioeconomic profiles, water supply and sanitation \nneeds, and projected impacts.  \n \n30.  Each subproject will consist of one or more communities, covered by a single piped \nwater supply system. Each system may cover 300\u22123,000 households or 1,500\u221218,000 people. \nAlthough classified as rural, the communities are relatively densely populated and are mostly \nsituated  around  public  markets  and  along  provincial  roads.  The  subprojects  will  follow  an \nintegrated  approach  to  the  improvement  of  water  supply  and  sanitation,  including  minor \ndrainage improvement. The project will support a CBA, ensuring the active involvement of the \ncommunities in the preparation, planning, design, construction and operation of the water supply \nand sanitation facilities.  \n \n31.  It  is  expected  that  six  to  nine subprojects  will  be selected  and  approved  annually. \nApproval of the subprojects will be based on a subproject appraisal report that includes (i) a \nfeasibility study; (ii) required safeguard documents on the environment, resettlement, and ethnic \nminorities; (iii) a CBA-IEC plan; and (iv) a baseline survey covering socioeconomic, health, and \nwater supply and sanitation coverage data. The capacity of the provinces to implement a \nsubproject will be assessed by ADB, based on the progress made in implementing subprojects \nin the previous batch. Provinces that perform satisfactorily may be awarded more subprojects \nthan provinces that perform poorly. Detailed selection criteria are in Appendix 4. \n \nB.  Outputs \n32.  Output 1: Operational and sustainable piped water supply systems. By 2016, 24 \npiped  water  supply  systems  will  be  operational,  providing  clean  water  to  about  65,000 \nhouseholds or 350,000 people. Each system will have to comply with the following standards: \n(i) water will be provided continuously at quantities not lower than 80 liters per capita per day;17 \n(ii)  tap  water  will  be  clean  and  safe  for  human  consumption  without  further  treatment;  \n(iii) the number of breakdowns will be less than four per month and these  will not last more than \n2 hours each;18 (iv) the water tariff will cover operation, maintenance and depreciation costs;  \n(v) the water bill per household, based on 80 liters per capita per day, will be less than 3% of \naverage monthly income. \n \n33.  The water supply systems will consist of: (i) a raw water source: either a deep well or a \nsurface  water  intake;  (ii)  transmission  mains;  (iii)  treatment  plant;  (iv)  pumping  station  if \n                                                 \n16 Average poverty ratio of subprojects is 27% versus 17% national and ethnic minority ratio is 10% versus 6%. \n17 The RWSS strategy prescribes a minimum of 60 liters per capita per day (lcpd). For piped water supply schemes \nwith house connections, a rate of 80 lcpd is a more realistic design criteria, considering easy access to water \nsupplies. This is supported by the World Bank's Red River Delta Water Supply Project, where the first batch of \nsubprojects were designed for 60 lcpd which proved to be not enough. The next batches adopted 80 lcpd as \ndesign capacity. \n18  Except in case of force majeure, such as typhoons and flooding. \n ", "8 \nrequired; (v) central elevated reservoir; (vi) distribution system; and (vii) house connections or \ncommunal taps, with water meters. Preference will be given to systems operating under gravity \nand to reservoirs located on natural elevations. The systems will follow the \"fill and draw\" \nprinciple rather than continuous flow. The project, the government, and beneficiaries will finance \ncapital  investments.  Beneficiaries  will  be  charged  service  fees  to  cover  the  operation, \nmaintenance and depreciation costs. \n \n34.  The government follows six management models for rural water supply operations, of \nwhich four are considered to be suitable for piped water supply systems:19 (i) the cooperative \nmanagement model, (ii) the PCERWASS management model, (iii) the private management \nmodel, and (iv) the enterprise management model. Viet Nam has limited experience of the \nmanagement of rural water supply schemes by cooperatives, the private sector, or enterprises. \nPiped water supply systems are considered too complex to be managed by cooperatives, while \nno privately operated water supply systems have been identified in the project provinces. The \nWorld Bank promotes the enterprise model despite the absence of lessons to draw upon.20 The \nmost common model is the PCERWASS model, whereby PCERWASS selects local people to \ntrain these into operators. This model has varying success rates, depending on the quality of \ntraining and educational background of the selected operators. The project will support the \nPCERWASS  management  model,  with  a  strong  emphasis  on  building  the  capacity  of  the \nmanagement and operational staff, before and during system operations. \n \n35.  Output 2. Improved household and public sanitation. By 2016, 65,000 households \nwill (i) have access to hygienic latrines, at home, at school, at commune health centers and at \npublic places; and (ii) benefit from better drainage at home and at public areas.  \n \n36.  This  output  will  be  achieved  through  four  main  activities:  (i)  construction  and \nrehabilitation  of  latrines  and  small  drainage  works  at  households;  (ii)  construction  and \nrehabilitation of school latrines; (iii) construction and rehabilitation of latrines at health centers \nand  public  areas;  and  (iv)  construction  of  drainage  works  in  public  areas.  The  household \ndrainage works will properly discharge spill and gray water flows that result from the water \nsupply works.  \n \n37.  The  MOH  has  endorsed  four  types  of  household  latrines:  double  vault  composting \nlatrines, ventilated improved pit latrines, pour flush water-sealed latrines, and latrines with septic \ntanks. The MOET endorses a variety of standard designs for school sanitation blocks, all using \nseptic tanks for wastewater disposal. The project will support double vault composting and pour \nflush latrines for household use,21 depending on cultural preference, and the MOET-endorsed \nstandard design.  \n \n38.  The project will support the construction of household latrines by providing in-kind grants \nand cash credit directly to households. Grants, equal to about 70% of the total latrine investment \n                                                 \n19 The two other models are: community management model and management directly by the provincial people\u2019s \ncommittee (PPC). \n20 The World Bank promotes the enterprise model in its Red River Delta RWSS project. A provincial enterprise is set \nup which is in charge of all rural water supply schemes in the province. The enterprise is co-owned by the PPC \n(90%) and the communities (10%) and after equitization shares may be sold to private entities. Although an \nevaluation is yet to be carried out, three questions can be raised: (i) besides ownership, how do these systems \ndiffer in terms of management capacity strengthening; (ii) how are these new enterprises going to deal with the \nproblems of sector regulation which their experienced urban counterparts currently face; and (iii) why not merge \nthese  rural  enterprises  with  their  urban  counterparts  to  profit  from  economies  of  scale  and  management \nexperience?  \n21 Ventilated improved pit latrines are considered unsuitable for densely populated areas and septic tanks are too \ncostly. \n ", "9 \ncosts, will be provided to poor households.22 The total latrine costs may vary per subproject. In \nflood-prone areas, elevated latrines will have to be constructed. The grant will be provided \nthrough the construction of the latrine substructure, to be procured by the provincial project \nmanagement units (PPMUs) through a single works contract for each subproject. This will \nensure  the  quality  and  appropriateness  of  the  technologies,  and  lower  costs  because  of \neconomies of scale. The households will construct the superstructure themselves. Credit will be \nprovided to non-poor households through a revolving fund, managed by the provincial and \ncommune Viet Nam women's union (VWU). 23 The maximum credit available will equal the \nestimated  full  costs  of  the  latrine.  Individual  households  will  be  responsible  for  procuring \nmaterials and works. The provincial Viet Nam women\u2019s union (PVWU) will be responsible for \nensuring the technologies are appropriate and of acceptable quality. School, health clinic, public \nlatrines, and public drainage works will be grant-financed.  \n \n39.  The project will support the establishment and training of sludge removal units in areas \nwhere flood-proof latrines will be constructed. Disposal of the sludge will be at designated \ndisposal  sites  or  composting  stations.  The  sludge  removal  and  disposal  system  will  be \nsupervised by the provincial people\u2019s committee (PPC) or designated government departments. \nThe operating costs will be borne by the population.  \n \n40.  Output 3. Improved hygiene awareness. In addition to providing the infrastructure \nunder outputs 1 and 2, community hygiene awareness will be raised to ensure that benefits are \nsustained following project completion. It is expected that by 2016 at least 90% of the population \nof the project areas will connected to water supply systems and will pay water bills on time. Less \nthan 30% of total water usage will be from alternative water sources. At least 90% of all latrines \nwill be operational and well maintained.  \n \n41.  This output will be achieved through three sets of activities: (i) increased community \nparticipation in subproject implementation, (ii) formation and training of water and sanitation \ncommune committees (WSCCs) and support to health and sanitation promoters (HSPs), and \n(iii) behavioral change for good hygiene practices through IEC.  \n \n42.  The project will adopt CBA to mobilize communities and implement IEC activities. Each \nsubproject  will  start  with  an  IEC  activity  promoting  community  awareness  of  health  and \nsanitation, followed by an orientation phase to (i) prepare communities on their involvement in \nthe various phases of the project cycle, (ii) establish the WSCCs and identify the HSPs, and  \n(iii) identify the required IEC training materials and approach based on a KAP assessment by \nthe consultants. This will enable the establishment of the implementation structure and an \napproved CBA-IEC action plan, particular to each community. The action plan will include  \n(i)  demonstrated  commitment  of  the  community  to  the  project;  (ii)  an  agreed  community \nparticipation  strategy,  including  benchmarks  and  timelines;  and  (iii)  an  agreed  IEC  plan, \nincluding identification of required materials and training approaches. Approval of this document \nby the PPC and ADB will be a prerequisite for subproject approval. \n \n43.  The CBA-IEC plan will be based on best practices in Viet Nam. The IEC plan may \ninclude elements of community-led total sanitation and ecological sanitation, if appropriate. The \nprogram will be implemented in selected subprojects, leading to improved awareness of the \n                                                 \n22 Following classification of Ministry  of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs, the current threshold for the rural \npopulation is D200,000 per person. The ministry is considering increasing that threshold to D350,000. \n23 ADB has good experience with revolving funds for sanitation improvement, managed by PVWUs under various \nprojects. Detailed guidelines have been prepared which will be adopted for this project. The World Bank has \nadopted same approach for its Red River Delta RWSS project. Following the Project closing, the revolving fund will \nbe continued by the VWU and may be extended to include other project areas within the respective provinces, \n ", "10 \nrelationship between water, sanitation and hygiene, behavioral change, and consequently to \nconsiderable health and environmental improvements. Progress will be measured through a \nbaseline survey and follow-up surveys.  \n \n44.  The WSCCs24 will include community leaders, representatives from the commune VWU \nand other  mass organizations, commune health officials, village leaders, men  and women \nrepresentatives from water users, school teachers and HSPs. At least 40% of the members of \nthe WSCCs will be women. Representatives from the village VWU and village health workers \nwill be trained as HSPs to mobilize the community for social preparation and to implement IEC \nactivities. At least 50% of the HSPs will be women. The HSPs will cover about 100 households \neach. The PPMU will allocate community funds of $2,000 per 100 households to procure goods \nand works25 for sanitation improvement in the local area. Procurement will be carried out by the \ncommunities, facilitated by the HSPs and approved by the PPMUs. \n \n45.  The  project  includes  capacity  building  to  enable  provincial  government  agencies, \nPPMUs, communes and villages to appreciate the importance of CBA and IEC. This is needed \nto promote the participation of communities in planning, implementing and managing water and \nsanitation services.  \n \n46.  Output 4. Strengthened sector planning and implementation capacity.  This output \nwill be delivered through three activities: (i) improvement of operation and maintenance (O&M) \nof water supply facilities, (ii) effective M&E of water supply and sanitation investments, and  \n(iii) capacity building of provincial and commune VWU to manage sanitation revolving funds.  \n \n47.  The project's support for improved O&M will improve the sustainability of water supply \nworks  by:  (i)  improving  system  management  capacity,  and  (ii)  promoting  community \ninvolvement in monitoring the systems' operations. Generally, operational staff will be selected \nfrom the project communities, based on their educational background and working experience. \nPCERWASS will support these staff in attending training courses, and will continue to provide \nsupport after the systems have been commissioned. The project will support the involvement of \nWSCCs in selecting operational staff and monitoring the operation of the system. Before the \nnew  facilities  are  handed  over,  operators  will  be  trained  through  course  work  at  training \ninstitutions and on-the job training at well-run piped water supply schemes in the same province, \nor,  if  not  available,  in  other  provinces.26 Once  systems  are  handed  over  and  operational, \nPCERWASS  will  assign  experienced  staff  to  operate  the  system  for  at  least  a  month \ncontinuously and 6 more months intermittently. The project will support (i) the training of the \nstaff; (ii) the establishment of an operators' network, including operators from the subproject \nareas,  and  other  existing  rural  and  urban  piped  water  supply  systems;  and  \n(iii) semiannual meetings of these networks to receive training on a specific technical subject \nand to discuss their own experiences and achievements. \n \n48.  By 2016, the M&E program should be operational in the project provinces. The project \nwill  support  \"train  the  trainers\"  courses  for  provincial  and  district  governments,  and  data \ncollection and evaluation training for the subproject communes. Baseline and annual M&E \nsurveys,27 including water-related disease data, will be collected by communities and HSPs.  \n                                                 \n24 The WSCC will serve as liaison between PPMU and community and will be tasked with endorsing and monitoring \nCBA-IEC action plan, facilitating IEC activities, supporting HSPs, and monitoring contractors. Detailed tasks will be \ndefined as part of CBA-IEC action plan. \n25 Goods may include equipment for stabilized sludge removal from composting toilets. Works may include small \ndrainage improvement works. \n26 This may be urban systems operated by water supply enterprises. \n27 Using the M&E indicator set developed by MARD. \n ", "11 \n \n49.  Output  5.  Improved  project  management  capacity.  This  output  will  be  delivered \nthrough  two  activities:  (i)  project  orientation  workshops  in  each  province;  and  (ii)  capacity \ndevelopment program for PCERWASS, DOH, DOET, PVWU, CPP, CVWU, WSCC, and HSPs. \nProject orientation workshops will be conducted in each province to inform key stakeholders about \nthe  project  design  and  eligibility  of  communes  to  participate  in  the  project.  The  capacity \ndevelopment  program  will  focus  on  improving  project  implementation  practices,  including:  \n(i)  RWSS  engineering  and  contract  management;  (ii)  financial  appraisal  and  analysis;  \n(iii) financial management; (iv) hygiene and sanitation awareness; (v) quality control; (vi) social \nand  gender  awareness  training,  (vii)  preparation,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of \nenvironmental, resettlement, and ethnic minority safeguard plans; (viii) planning and budgeting; \n(ix) accounting and bookkeeping; and (x) procurement. A detailed assessment of training needs \nwill be carried out at the start of the project by the consultants. \n \nC.  Special Features \n50.  Poverty  focus. The project has a strong poverty focus: (i) subproject selection will \nprioritize communes with high poverty levels; (ii) house connections will be provided at minimum \ncost,28 allowing  poor  families  to  benefit  equally  from  the  water  supply  services  provided;  \n(iii) poor households29 will be eligible for grants to construct sanitation facilities; and (iv) the IEC \nprogram will be implemented through CBA, encouraging poor households to participate. \n \n51.  Integrated  approach  to  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  promotion.  The \nbenefits from access to improved water supply and sanitation infrastructure will be strengthened \nif  behavioral  change  leads  to  improved  hygienic  practices.  The  project  will  only  support \nsubprojects that include investments in infrastructure and behavioral change programs. The \nproject will support school sanitation programs, since children often educate their parents in \nproper hygiene practices.   \n \n52.  Community-based approach to subproject implementation. To prevent communities \nreturning  to  their  traditional  practices  following  project  completion,  the  subprojects  will  \n(i)  address  community  needs,  (ii)  provide  services,  and  (iii)  remain  affordable  to  the  poor \nhouseholds.  The  project  supports  (i)  capacity  building  and  awareness-raising  of  local \ncommunities,  (ii)  participatory  decision  making  on  communities'  involvement  in  project \nimplementation and IEC, (iii) community-based procurement of small sanitation works to meet \nlocal needs, and (iv) capacity building of government and mass organizations to create an \nenabling environment and strengthen governance relationships. \n \n53.  Information,  education,  and  communication  as  a  continuing  activity. Sustained \nbehavioral change can only be achieved through long-term support. The project will support IEC \nactivities on a continuing basis starting immediately after approval of the subprojects until 6 \nmonths after completion of the construction works. The total duration of the IEC support will be \n3\u20133.5 years. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n54.  The project investment cost is estimated at $50 million, including taxes and duties of \n$4.4 million. The total cost includes physical and price contingencies, and interest and other \n                                                 \n28 Maximum  household  contribution  5%  of  total  investment  cost,  or  about  $18.  This  will  be  charged  after \ncommissioning of the works through deferred payments system.

It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $45 million from its Asian Development Fund \nresources. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, and an \ninterest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. ADB \nwill finance taxes and duties of $4.1 million30 while government financing of $2.6 million will \ncover resettlement and land compensation, 5% of the cost of the water supply infrastructure,31 \nand 10% of the public latrines and drainage. It is expected that this approach will strengthen \nprovincial government ownership of infrastructure and lead to lower contract costs. The taxes \nand  duties  are  not  excessive,  amounting  to  less  than  10%  of  total  project  costs.  The \nbeneficiaries are expected to contribute $2.4 million in cash and kind. The financing plan is in \nTable 5. The project was prepared through a project preparatory technical assistance grant32 of \n$600,000 financed by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund-IV. \n \nTable 5: Tentative Financing Plan \n($ million) \nShare of \nSource  Total    Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  45.00    90.00 \nGovernment  2.63    5.27 \nBeneficiaries  2.37    4.73 \n  Total    50.00    100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                 \n30 Only on ADB-financed expenditure. \n31 The water supply works for each subproject, including the house connections will be constructed under a single \ncontract to be fully financed by ADB (90%) and the provincial budgets (10%). Following the commissioning of the \nworks, the provincial government may decide to recuperate a maximum of 5% of the investment costs by charging \nthe customers a connection fee, preferably through a deferred payment system. \n32 ADB. 2008.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n56.  MARD will be the executing agency of the project. A central project management unit \n(CPMU)  will  be  established  within  the  NCERWASS  of  MARD  to  coordinate  project \nimplementation.  The  CPMU  will  (i)  provide  technical  support  for  project  implementation, \nsupervision  and  training  to  the  project  provinces  through  project  consultants;  (ii)  make \nwithdrawal applications to ADB for disbursement of the loan proceeds; (iii) monitor withdrawals \nby  the  PPMUs  from  the  SGIAs;  (iv)  review,  and  submit  project  financial  reports  from  the \nprovincial level; (v) review the project performance monitoring data; (vi) recruit an independent \nauditor and ensure that periodic project audits are properly carried out in a timely manner; (vii) \ncoordinate  all  reporting  activities,  consolidate  reports  and  ensure  timely  submission  of \nsemiannual  reports  to  MARD  and  ADB;  (viii)  monitor  and  coordinate  all  project-related \nprocurement to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Borrower and ADB.; and (ix) act \nas liaison between the government and ADB. \n \n57.  The PPCs shall be responsible for carrying out the project at the provincial level.  DARD \nis  responsible  for  implementing  the  subprojects  and  shall  set  up  a  PPMU  within  the \nPCERWASS of the project provinces. Each PPMU shall consist of experienced professional \nstaff from at least the relevant units within PCERWASS and a representative of the subproject \nCPC. The PPMU shall be responsible for: (i) liaising with the CPMU, other PPMUs and CPCs; \n(ii) selecting and proposing subprojects; (iii) carrying out subproject feasibilities studies and \npreparing  subproject  feasibility  reports  that  will  include  technical  design,  appraisal,  bidding \ndocuments for civil works and safeguards reports; (iv) procuring civil works; (v) establishing a \nprocurement  committee,  chaired  by  the  PCERWASS  director; 33 (vi)  implementing  land \nacquisition, resettlement, environmental, ethnic minorities and gender activities; (vii) providing \ntechnical advice to communities on the development of water supply and sanitation facilities and \ntheir subsequent O&M; (viii) implementing an awareness campaign on water use, sanitation, \nand hygiene; (ix) collecting M&E data and entry to computerized database; and (x) preparing \nreports.  \n \n58.  The  PVWUs  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  revolving  funds  for sanitation \nimprovement. Through the commune VWUs, the PVWUs will promote public awareness of the \ncredit scheme, identify poor households, process credit applications, channel payments and \ncollect  repayment,  maintain  accounts  and  records,  and  inspect  and  certify  credit-funded \ninfrastructure. The PPMU will have overall responsibility for the implementation of activities at \nthe subproject level and will be accountable for all related expenditure, including revolving funds \nand community funds. The accounts of the credit scheme will be subject to audit by the project \nauditor recruited by the CPMU. The required legal documents and detailed implementation and \nmonitoring guidelines will be prepared by the consultants. The implementation arrangements \nare in Appendix 6. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n59.  It is estimated that the project will be implemented over 6.5 years, commencing in the \nfirst half of 2010. The first year will be used to recruit consultants and start the community \n                                                 \n33 The procurement committee will include a procurement officer, an administration officer, and technical staff. The \nteam leader and deputy team leader (or other national consultant of the project consulting team) are part of the \nprocurement committee in an advisory role without voting rights. The consultant will prepare an independent \nevaluation report, to be submitted directly to the CPMU and copied to ADB.   \n ", "14 \nmobilization and IEC activities of the first group of subprojects. With the approval of six to nine \nsubprojects a year, it is expected that the construction of the last batch of subprojects will start \nat the beginning of the fourth year. The construction period will be about 2 years, leaving 1 year \nto finalize the capacity building of the operational staff and complete the IEC activities. The \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n3.  Advance Recruitment of Consulting Services \n60.  ADB management has approved advance recruitment of consulting services. MARD can \npost advertisement and receive expressions of interest and may draft a short list of consultants, \nrequest proposals, and evaluate them.  ADB\u2019s support of advance contracting does not commit \nADB to approve the loan project or to finance the recruitment costs. Contracting should be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \n4.  Procurement \n61.  Goods, works, and services financed by ADB will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). All procurement contracts will \ncontain anticorruption provisions as specified by ADB. Procurement will generally be carried out \nby the PPMUs and supported by the international consultant. Civil works above $2,000,000 or \ngoods above $500,000 will be procured through international competitive bidding. Civil works \nwith value of $2,000,000 or less and goods with value of $500,000 or less, will be procured \nthrough national competitive bidding. Civil works and goods with value of $100,000 or less will \nbe procured through shopping. Civil works contracts for household sanitation with a total value \nof $5,000 or less can be procured at the commune level and will follow community participation \nin procurement in accordance with ADB's procedures for implementing small projects with \ncommunity  participation.  The  experience  with  ADB  procurement  procedures  and  practices \nvaries from province to province. The international consultant will provide support for preparing \nbid documents, and for the bidding process, including evaluation. All international competitive \nbidding and the first two similar NCB civil works contracts in each province will be subject to \nprior review by ADB. The water supply works will be contracted as design build contracts. The \nprocurement plan is in Appendix 8. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n62.  Consultants will be recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Consulting services will include the following packages: \n(i) general project management to CPMU and PPMUs, (ii) technical design and procurement \nservices,  (iii)  preparation  of  safeguard  documents,  (iv)  community  mobilization  and  IEC \nimplementation, and (v) capacity building of water supply system operators. Consulting services \nwill  be  provided  by  one  international  consulting  firm,  recruited  by  the  CPMU,  and  various \nnational consulting firms, recruited by the PPMUs. The firms will provide a total of 1,497 person-\nmonths of consulting time, of which 285 person-months will be for international specialists and \n1,212 person-months for national specialists. The consulting firms will be recruited using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method. The technical proposals will be given a weight of 80% \nand the financial proposals 20%. ADB's Procurement Guidelines will be applicable throughout \nthe consulting services. The assets purchased will be handed over to MARD upon completion of \nthe project. The outline terms of reference of consultants are in Appendix 9. \n \n ", "15 \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n63.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  MARD.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan \nregulations and the bidding documents for the project. In particular, all contracts financed by \nADB in connection with the project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of MARD and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the project. \n \n64.  To encourage greater stakeholder participation, transparency and accountability, the \nproject will (i) strengthen the capacity within the MARD to comply with the project administration \nmanual; (ii) use the NCERWASS website and the existing system at the commune people's \ncommittee  offices  (notice  board)  to  disclose information  on  the  use  of  the loan  proceeds, \nincluding procurement data; (iii) notify communities of the date and location of selected events \nin  the  procurement  process  (e.g.,  public  bid  openings,  progress  reviews,  and  hand  over \nceremonies); and (iv) establish grievance redresses mechanisms at the CPMU and PPMU \nlevels in each participating province to receive complaints and/or grievances from communities, \ncontractors, and others. The procurement data to be disclosed include, but are not limited to  \n(i) list of participating bidders, (ii) name of the winning bidder, (iii) basic details on bidding \nprocedures, (iv) contract award, (v) list of goods and services procured, and (vi) intended and \nactual utilization of loan proceeds under each contract. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n65.  Payment of eligible expenditures from loan proceeds will be made either through direct \npayment or imprest account procedures in line with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, \nas amended from time to time). Immediately after loan effectiveness, MARD will establish a first-\ngeneration imprest account (FGIA) in Ha Noi, and the six PPMUs will each establish a second-\ngeneration imprest account (SGIA), in a commercial bank designated by State Bank of Vietnam \nand acceptable to ADB. \n \n66.  The maximum amount to be deposited into each imprest account shall be equivalent to \nthe estimated expenditure to be funded through each imprest account for the next 6 months of \nproject  implementation,  but  in  any  event  shall  nor  exceed  $4,500,000  for  the  FGIA  and \n$650,000 for each SGIA. The SGIAs will be replenished upon presentation of documented \nliquidation of expenditures as outlined in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The CPMU may \nuse  the  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  for  replenishing  the  imprest  accounts  and \nliquidation  of  advance  payment,  provided  that  each  individual  payment  does  not  exceed \n$100,000. \n \n67.  Payments made directly from the CPMU and PPMUs will be supervised and authorized \nby the treasury at central and provincial levels upon receipt of payment documents. Based on \nthe  payments  authorized  by  provincial  treasuries,  each  PPMU  will  prepare  withdrawal \napplications with associated payment documents or statements and the SGIA balance sheet \n(using the CPMU format) and submit them to the CPMU. Upon the receipt of reimbursement \napplications and payment documents from PPMUs, the CPMU will prepare an aggregated \nwithdrawal application and submit it to the Ministry of Finance for endorsement. Authorized \nwithdrawal applications will be forwarded to ADB for reimbursement to the FGIA.  \n \n ", "16 \n68.  Funds for the sanitation revolving fund will be disbursed through the PPMU's managed \nSGIAs to the PVWUs.  \n \n69.  No  disbursement  of  loan  proceeds  will  be  made  to  a  participating  province  if \nmisprocurement has been found by ADB or procurement has been identified as irregular, until \nthe misprocurement or other irregularity has been corrected by the province concerned to the \nsatisfaction of the government and ADB. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n70.  The  CPMU  and  PPMUs  shall  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  project \nexpenditures in accordance with sound accounting principles. The consultant team will provide \ntraining on the use of the imprest accounts and support to CPMU and PPMU accounting staff. All \nproject accounts will be audited annually as part of the regular audit by an independent auditing \nfirm acceptable to ADB, using international accounting and auditing standards. The consolidated \naudit reports will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the close of the government's fiscal year. \nThe audit opinion will include (i) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal control \nsystems  regarding  project  expenditures  and  transactions  to  ensure  safe  custody  of  project-\nfinanced assets; (ii) a determination as to whether the government, MARD, and participating \nprovinces  have  maintained  adequate  documentation  for  all  financial  transactions,  specifically \nincluding the statement of expenditure and imprest account procedures for both first and second \ngeneration  imprest  accounts;  and  (iii)  confirmation  of  compliance  with  the  project  financial \nmanagement system and ADB requirements for project management. A separate audit opinion will \nbe issued on the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditure procedures.   \n \n71.  Each PPMU will submit quarterly reports and data to the CPMU within 15 days of the end \nof each quarter. The CPMU will (i) collect and consolidate all project progress reports, site reports, \nand technical and financial reports and submit them to ADB; and (ii) prepare quarterly progress \nreports within 30 days of the end of each quarter, a midterm project evaluation report, and an \noverall project completion report. The quarterly report will include (i) a narrative description of \nprogress  made  during  the  reporting  period;  (ii)  modifications,  if  any,  to  the  implementation \nschedule; (iii) details of land use and resettlement; (iv) information on environmental screening;  \n(v) major project activities by CPMU, PPMUs and PVWUs; (vi) financial and procurement-related \ninformation; (vii) problems experienced and remedial actions proposed; (viii) the work to be \ncarried out during the upcoming reporting period; and (ix) a summary of expenditures during the \nquarter, year-to-date expenditures, and total expenditures to date. A project completion report will \nbe prepared by the CPMU and submitted to ADB within 3 months of physical completion of the \nproject. All reports and associated financial accounts and data will be presented to ADB in the \nEnglish language. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n72.  A project performance management system will be developed based on the government's \nM&E system and implementation procedures, expanded to ensure that it meets the performance \nand safeguard  reporting needs  of the proposed project,  including basic health indicators. A \nbaseline  survey  will  be  conducted,  as  part  of  the  IEC  action  plan.  The  communes  will  be \nresponsible for data collection and will be assisted and trained by the project consultants. The \nPPMUs will consolidate these data and will provide the CPMU with quarterly reports on their \n(i) activities, (ii) compliance with safeguard requirements, and (iii) progress toward output targets. \nThe CPMU will consolidate these into a quarterly progress report that will be finalized and \ncirculated to ADB, MARD, and MOH, within 1 month of the end of the reporting quarter. Selected \ndata will be disaggregated by sex, household income, and ethnic group where feasible and \n ", "17 \napplicable. Annual project performance management system reports will be prepared by each \nPPMU, then consolidated by the CPMU and submitted to ADB.   \n \n10.  Project Review \n73.  MARD and ADB will conduct joint loan reviews at least twice a year and a comprehensive \nproject review about 30 months after loan effectiveness. The comprehensive project review will \nevaluate (i) the actual progress of each project output in each province; (ii) implementation \narrangements and procedures; (iii) role of commune committees and commune promoters in  \nfurthering project implementation; (iv) procurement procedures; (v) progress and effectiveness of \ncapacity development programs; (vi) the functioning and performance of the CPMU, PPMUs, \nPVWUs,  and  consultants,  (vii)  the  financial  performance  and  cost  recovery  of  water  supply \nschemes and revolving funds; and (viii) effectiveness of safeguard procedures. Remedial actions \nwill be agreed to address the problems identified. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n74.  Poverty and social impacts. About 27% of the population of the central coastal region \nlived in poverty in 2006, compared with 16% in Viet Nam as a whole. The monthly per capita \nincome was lower than the national average. About 70% of the population lives in rural areas. In \nthe subproject areas, 44% of the labor force is engaged in agriculture and the poverty rate \nranges from 15.5% to 34.5%. \n \n75.  Equitable access to clean and affordable water continues to be a critical issue in rural \nareas of Viet Nam. In the subproject areas, all households will be provided with clean water and \nsanitation  services  in  an  equitable  and  affordable  manner.  The  project  will  provide \napproximately 350,000 people with access to clean water and hygienic sanitation facilities. \nAccess to clean water and sanitation by households will improve public health, especially child \nhealth, and will reduce medical expenditures. By targeting remote rural areas, the project will \nbenefit populations with high poverty levels.  \n \n76.  Ethnic minorities. The number of ethnic groups in the project provinces varies from 3 to \n28. The groups include the Ba-na, Bru-van-kieu, Ca Rai, Cham, Chut, Co Tu, Edo Nagi, Gia \nRai, Gie Trieng, Hoa, Khemer, Moung, Nung, Tay, Thai,  Tho Dao, and, Xe Dang.  However, the \npercentage of ethnic minority people in the project provinces is relatively small (ranging from 2% \nto 14%), except for the subproject area of Quang Nam Province, which has a population that is \n80% Co Tu and a poverty rate of 60%.  \n \n77.  The  ethnic  minorities  in  the  project  provinces  are  integrated  into  the  mainstream \npopulation in terms of language, schooling, and clothing. The subprojects will not have any \nadverse cultural effects on these groups. The ethnic minority people will benefit from both the \nwater and the sanitation services provided by the project. To ensure that ethnic minority people \nparticipate equally, have a voice in the planning of water sanitation facilities, and receive equal \nbenefits from the project, an ethnic minority development plan (EMDP) will be prepared for each \nsubproject in areas where more than 50% of the population is from ethnic minorities. An ethnic \nminority  development  framework  is  included  in  the  project  for  the  preparation  of  EMDPs. \nSubprojects where less than 50% of the population is from ethnic minorities will include actions \nspecifically targeted at such groups in the subproject design. For the subproject in To Vieng \ncommune of Tay Giang District in Quang Nam Province, an EMDP has been prepared. The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n \n ", "18 \n78.  Gender impacts. Women provide most of the labor in the collection and use of water. \nThey are also usually responsible for taking care of sick family members. Access to improved \nwater services and sanitation facilities will have a positive impact on family health and will allow \nwomen to spend more time on productive activities. The CBA of the project will provide an \nopportunity for women to participate in planning water and sanitation services. Women's active \ninvolvement in planning community water and sanitation facilities will increase their voice in \ncommunity affairs.  Specific attention will be given to targeting women in implementing the IEC \nfor behavioral change. The capacity of VWU will be developed to mobilize the community to \ncreate demand for water and sanitation services, and to implement IEC. The WSCCs and their \nworking groups will be at least 40% women, and will include representatives from the VWUs, \nHSPs, and the communities. In addition, at least 50% of the HSPs will be women. A project- \nspecific gender strategy will ensure women's participation in planning and implementation of \nwater and sanitation facilities and in building the capacity of the women's union, and staff of the \nPPMU to secure the active involvement of women in the project activities. The summary gender \nanalysis and action plan is in Appendix 11. \n \n79.  Land acquisition and resettlement. The main resettlement impacts created by the \nproject will be the permanent loss of land for the construction of water supply plants and minor \ndamage to structures, crops and trees and the temporary loss or disruption of the use of land \ncaused by the construction of pipelines. Most permanent acquisition will be limited to land that is \npublicly owned and reserved for infrastructure purposes, although some permanent acquisition \nwill be required along the pipeline route where it traverses private agricultural land. Where the \npublic land is currently used for other purposes, the users of the land will be offered alternative \nland so they are no worse off as a result of the project. \n \n80.  The six PPCs will be responsible for resettlement plan preparation and implementation. \nThe resettlement plans for the six core subprojects will need to be updated once the final \ndesigns have been completed. Upon completion of detailed designs, a detailed measurement \nsurvey will be completed, which will confirm the number of affected people and the extent of \nimpact. Compensation rates will be updated for all categories of lost assets and allowances \nbased on replacement cost surveys undertaken at that time. The updating of resettlement plans \nand the preparation of resettlement plans for other (as yet unidentified) subprojects will be \nundertaken by the project implementation consultant with the support of the respective PPCs.  \n \n81.  A  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  to  address  the  other  subprojects  in \naccordance with ADB policy. The resettlement framework contains key components including a \ndefinition  of  the  cutoff  date,  an  entitlement  matrix,  the  process  for  preparation  of  future \nresettlement  plans,  minimum  requirements  for  surveys  (detailed  measurement  survey, \nsocioeconomic  survey  and  replacement  cost  survey),  consultation,  grievance  redress  and \ndisclosure  requirements,  controls  relating  to  vulnerability,  gender  and  ethnicity,  institutional \narrangements, M&E requirements, and an implementation schedule. The summary resettlement \nplan and resettlement framework is in Appendix 12. \n \n82.  Environmental impacts. The environmental classification of the project is category B. \nBased  on  the  results of  the  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs),  the subprojects  are \nunlikely to cause significant adverse environmental impacts since they are intended to improve \nthe quality of environment and living standards of rural communities in the subproject areas. \nBenefits include the increase in the number of houses connected to clean and reliable water \nsupply  for  drinking  and  sanitation,  minimized  or  eliminated  flooding  and  stagnation  of \nwastewater, and improved personal sanitation. The potential adverse environmental impacts \nassociated with design, construction and operation of the subprojects will be small and localized \nand  can  be  readily  mitigated  through  proper  engineering  design  and  implementation  of \n ", "19 \nmitigation and monitoring measures identified in the IEEs. An environmental assessment and \nreview framework (EARF) has been prepared for future subprojects. \n \n83.  Economic benefits. Six sample subprojects were selected for the feasibility study. The \neconomic internal rates of return (EIRRs) for the pilot subprojects range from 13.4% in Quang \nNam to 23.0% in Nghe An. These projections suggest that all six subprojects examined are \neconomically viable, since their EIRRs are all well above the economic opportunity cost of \ncapital of 12% for the benefits that have been quantified. \n \n84.  Major quantifiable benefits attributable to the project include: (i) nonincremental benefits \n(water supplied by the project will replace most of the water sources currently used by the \nhouseholds);  (ii)  incremental  benefits  (beneficiaries\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  improved  and \nexpanded water services and their consequent increase in water consumption); (iii) user cost \nsavings (as a result of lower costs for water storage and boiling and filtration); and (iv) time \nsavings in the collection of water. The economic costs of the pilot subprojects include capital \ncosts (including land acquisition and resettlement, and environmental mitigation and monitoring \ncosts) and O&M costs (including the costs of replacing depreciated equipment). \n \n85.  Financial management capacity. The financial management capability of NCERWASS \nis adequate to implement the project. Training in ADB disbursement procedures will be provided \nby the project. The financial management capacity of PCERWASS varies, but in general needs \nstrengthening.  The  project  implementation  consultants  will  review  the  financial  information \nsystems  and  procedures  of  PCERWASS  and  propose  modifications.  The  consultants  will  \n(i) draft terms of reference for external auditors, (ii) prepare a financial management plan,  \n(iii)  assist  in  implementing  this  plan,  (iv)  prepare  a  training  program,  and  (v)  develop  a \nmethodology for periodic reviews of the water supply tariff. The PPMU staff will be trained in \nADB loan processing and policies and related procedures for procurement and disbursement. \n \n86.  Risks  and  mitigation  measures.  The  following  are  potential  risks  for  the  project:  \n(i)  poor  households  may  not  be  able  to  afford  water  supply  tariffs  at  full  cost  recovery;  \n(ii) local government agencies may be unable to implement CBA and the gender strategy or \nmay  resist  doing  so;  (iii)  implementation  of  IEC  activities  may  take  a  traditional  top-down \napproach instead of intensive community mobilization; (iv) women, poor people, and members \nof ethnic minorities may be marginalized in decision making and the planning of water and \nsanitation facilities at the community level; (v) beneficiaries may not adopt hygienic behavior, \nwhich may reduce some of the benefits of the project; and (vi) water supply facilities may not be \nsustainable because of low water tariffs and improper O&M. \n \n87.  To mitigate these risks, communities will be involved in the preparation, implementation, \nand monitoring of water supply works, so facilities are appropriate to the community needs. \nIndividual households will be targeted to raise awareness of the importance of hygiene for family \nhealth and so they can contribute labor and local materials for building latrines. Training will be \nprovided  to  local  governmental  agencies,  community  facilitators,  and  commune  water  and \nsanitation  committees  so  they  can  develop  a  better  understanding  of  the  effectiveness  of \ncommunity  mobilization  for  implementing  IEC  CBA,  and  the  EMDP,  for  planning,  and  for \nensuring  the  equal  participation  of  men  and  women  in  decision  making  for  community \ninvestments in water and sanitation. Monitoring indicators that are disaggregated by poverty, \nethnicity,  and  gender  will  be  included  in  the  project  monitoring  system.  The  community \nfacilitators will be trained in community mobilization and implementation of IEC and to monitor \nhygienic behavior. The appropriateness and affordability of the water supply systems will be \nassessed during project implementation and discussed with the communities, following the \n ", "20 \nCBA. The project will support the PPCs to set water tariffs to cover operation, maintenance and \ndepreciation costs, and to train operators to run the systems efficiently. \n \nV.

Government Strategy \n \n1.  National rural water supply and sanitation strategy. The National Rural Clean Water \nSupply and Sanitation Strategy to 20201 was developed by the Ministry of Construction and the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD). The strategy was approved by the \nPrime Minister on 25 August 2000.2 \n  \n2.  In  developing  the  strategy,  the  importance  and  context  of  rural  water  supply  and \nsanitation (RWSS) were recognized: 75% of the national population is rural and predominantly \npoor,  and  better  RWSS  is  needed  to  achieve  better  public  health,  living  conditions,  and \nenvironment. As a result, RWSS was made one of seven national target programs in 2000. At \nthe time, only 30% of the population had access to water that met basic hygiene criteria, and \nonly 20% of rural households had hygienic latrines. Investment in RWSS was only 10% of the \namount needed, understanding of good hygienic practices was low, and use of fresh excreta as \nfertilizer was common. In addition, RWSS programs were fragmented, with little coordination \namong  ministries  and  departments  and  a  weak  legislative  environment  with  respect  to \nregulations and guidelines for the management of RWSS.   \n \n3.  The strategy sets ambitious targets for physical infrastructure, 100% coverage for both \nclean water supply and hygienic latrines by 2020, but without identifying the specific projects, \ntotal investments, or sources of funds that might be required to achieve these objectives.  \n \n4.  Evaluation of Rural Water Supply and Sanitation National Target Program I (2001\u2013\n2005). The RWSS strategy was implemented over the period 2001\u20132005 as a national target \nprogram (NTP I). At the conclusion of RWSS NTP I, a sector status report was developed by a \ngovernment\u2013partner  organization  review  team  and  issued  in  January  2005.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) was part of the team. The report represents the most comprehensive \neffort seen to date to evaluate RWSS at the national level. In particular, it places RWSS within \nthe perspective of the rapid economic development of Viet Nam in recent years.  \n \n5.  The  evaluation  of  NTP  I  revealed  that  progress  had  been  made:  (i)  water  supply \ncoverage  was  extended  to  23  million  people;  (ii)  3.7  million  more  households were  using \nhygienic latrines; (iii) a newly introduced sanitation campaign led to improvements in hygienic \npractices; (iv) the number of schools, commune health clinics, and rural markets with water \nsupply  and  sanitation  facilities  increased;  (v)  funding  sources  were  diversified  (43%  from \nbeneficiaries, 22% from central budget, 16% from international partner organizations, and 19% \nfrom other sources); and (vi) legal documents and guidelines were prepared to encourage \ndifferent  economic  sectors  to  invest  in  the  sector  and  to  stimulate  a  diversification  of \nmanagement models. \n \n6.  It was also concluded that the water supply coverage targets for 2010 and 2020 are \nlikely to be met provided existing efforts were maintained. However, there was little prospect of \nmeeting the sanitation targets. Because households have had to pay to build their own latrines, \nthe poor lag far behind better-off households in coverage rates. The review also stressed the \nimportance  of  targeting  government  and  partner  organization  support  at  the  poorest \n                                                 \n1 MARD. 2000.

In  general,  the  joint  review  team  felt  that  NTP  I  had  a  misplaced  focus  on  the \nconstruction of water supply systems. The team felt that the key issues included: (i) the legal, \npolicy,  and  regulatory  environment;  (ii)  coordination  among  the  government,  partner \norganizations,  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs);  (iii)  decentralization  policies;  \n(iv) socialization and private sector participation; (v) community participation; (vi) information, \neducation,  and  communication  (IEC);  (vii)  sustainability  of  finances  and  operation  and \nmaintenance; (viii) monitoring and evaluation of RWSS facilities, and (ix) links to public health \nand economic development. \n \n8.  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  National  Target  Program  II  (2006\u20132010). A \nsecond national target program was approved, covering the period 2006\u20132010 (NTP II). This \naddressed the issues identified in the evaluation of NTP I: (i) improved institutional structure and \ncoordination among stakeholders to ensure more targeted investments; (ii) decentralization and \nbuilding  capacity  for  planning  and  implementation  at  provincial  and  district  levels;  \n(iii) development of coherent legal, policy, and regulatory settings, including greater involvement \nby communities and the private sector; (iv) greater focus on sanitation by strengthening IEC \nactivities as an integral part of any RWSS program; (v) establishing a range of investment \nfinancing mechanisms; (vi) increasing participation by local communities; and (vii) strengthening \nthe monitoring and evaluation of RWSS data. \n \n9.  NTP II aims to provide access to clean water for an additional 14.7 million people and to \npromote the construction of hygienic latrines for an additional 2.6 million households. The total \nbudget was estimated at $1.4 billion (Table A2.1). \n \nTable A2.1: National Target Program II Budget Estimates \n($ million, 2005 prices) \n \nCategory  Budget Estimates \nInvestment costs of water supply  562 \nInvestment costs of latrines  300 \nInvestment costs of livestock waste treatment   \nfacilities  425 \nSurvey, planning, IEC, human resource development,  125 \nmanagement, and monitoring \n  Total  1,412 \nIEC = information, education, and communication. \nSource: National Target Program for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (2006\u20132010). \n \n10.  The breakdown for the water supply investment costs by region is presented in Table \nA2.2. The capital investment cost for water supply facilities in the central region is $181 million. \nThe investment costs for sanitation are $96 million and overhead costs, including IEC and \ncapacity building, are $40 million, bringing the total budget requirements to $317 million for the \ncentral coastal region, of which 15% or $48 million is expected to be financed by international \npartner organizations. The remainder will have to be financed by the central government (14%), \nlocal government (10%), and beneficiaries (61%). \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  31 \nTable A2.2: Estimated Capital Investment Cost by Type of Water Supply Facility \n($ million) \n \n     \n   \nUpgraded  New  Reservoirs,  Tanks, Dug \nRegion  Total Cost \n(piped)  (piped)  Drilled Wells  Wells \nNorth East and West    88   334    74    20    515 \nRed River Delta    58   143    0    1    202 \nNorth Central Coast     17    76    0    1    94 \nSouth Central Coast     17    57    12    1    87 \nCentral Highland    11    51    25    1    88 \nSouth East    10    35    11    0    57 \nMekong River Delta    5    27    2    0    34 \nViet Nam    118   389    50    4    562 \nSource: National Target Program for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (2006\u20132010). \n \n11.  Currently the government is reviewing the RWSS strategy, and an evaluation of the NTP \nII is planned in 2010. Based on the results, a decision will be taken on whether the current 5-\nyear national target program will be extended, or will be designated in a different manner.  \n \nB.  Sector Responsibilities and Limitations \n \n12.  The institutional structure of the RWSS is complex. There are a number of different \nagencies and programs in addition to the RWSS NTP II that are part of national efforts to \nachieve RWSS coverage and poverty targets. Decentralization means that provinces have \nsubstantial  autonomy  with  regard  to  budgets  and  responsibility  for  planning  and  activity \nimplementation.  \n \n13.  MARD  is  the  lead  agency  for  RWSS.  It  has  delegated  the  responsibility  for \nimplementation of programs financed by partner organizations to the National Center for Rural \nWater  Supply  and  Sanitation  (NCERWASS).  The  government-funded  NTP  II  program  is \nadministered by the national standing office based in the Department of Water Resources \nManagement in MARD.  \n \n14.  In  addition  to  managing  the  implementation  of  programs  financed  by  partner \norganizations, including those by ADB, the World Bank, and Japan International Cooperation \nAgency  (JICA),  NCERWASS  undertakes  various  support  activities.  These  include: \nimplementation of a monitoring and evaluation system for RWSS; development of management \nmodels  for  piped  water  systems  (e.g.,  user  groups,  cooperatives,  and  public  utilities); \npreparation of introductory material on RWSS technologies; and development of operation and \nmaintenance guidelines for various types of water supply systems. \n \n15.  The Ministry of Finance is responsible for recurrent budget allocations to NTPs, financial \ncontrols,  and  release  of  funds  to  provinces.  The  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investments  in \nconsultation with the Ministry of Finance proposes budget allocations for approval by the Prime \nMinister and the National Assembly.  \n \n16.  The Ministry of Health is responsible for developing awareness on hygiene and health \nand for setting and monitoring water quality standards. The Ministry of Education and Training is \nresponsible for health and hygiene programs in schools. Responsibilities are delegated to the \nprovincial departments of these ministries: departments of health and departments of education \nand training. \n ", "32  Appendix 2 \n \n17.  Provincial people's committees manage resources and coordinate the implementation of \nRWSS investments. Typically this is devolved to the provincial office of PCERWASS.  \n \n18.  Institutional constraints. The provincial authorities are the key executing agencies. \nHowever,  they  (i)  lack  familiarity  with  the  RWSS  strategy  and  the  principles  affecting \nsustainability, (ii) have a tendency to focus on water and ignore sanitation, (iii) lack technical \ncapacity,  (iv)  focus  on  meeting  construction  targets  rather  than  functional  targets,  and  \n(v) are unfamiliar with demand responsive approaches. \n \n19.  Lack of coordination and limited capacity. Although at the national level there is an \nagreement between MARD, MOH, and the Ministry of Education and Training to coordinate \nRWSS activities, this has not led to coordination at the provincial level. Implementation capacity \nvaries significantly from province to province and there is no strategic plan to build capacity.  \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  33 \nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION \n \nA.  Major Development Partners: Strategic Foci and Key Activities  \n \n1.  The Rural Water Supply Sector (RWSS) in Viet Nam is supported by over 100 agencies. \nThe main development partners in the sector are the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), \nthe World Bank, Danish International Development Assistance (Danida), the Australian Agency \nfor International Development (AusAID), and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). \nTheir current programs are listed in Table A3.1. \n \n2.  UNICEF's involvement in the RWSS dates from the early 1980s. It has a strong focus on \ndeveloping technical, managerial and policy capacity in national agencies, mass organizations, \nand communities. It has successfully introduced community-based sanitation models, notably \nthe intensive sanitation promotion model, and it provides support to the National Center for \nRural and Clean Water and Environmental Sanitation in developing information, education and \ncommunication materials.  \n \n3.  The World Bank supports the sector primarily through the Red River Delta Water Supply \nand Sanitation Project, focusing on piped water supply schemes following demand-responsive \napproach and principles of the national RWSS strategy.  \n \n4.  The two main partner organizations are Danida and AusAID, who, with support of the \nNetherlands, will provide budget support for the implementation of the National Target Plan II. In \naddition,  they  are  providing  technical  assistance  to  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural \nDevelopment (MARD) to prepare legislation and technical guidelines.  \n \n5.  JICA provides assistance for groundwater resource development and the European \nUnion supports RWSS through integrated rural development projects. \n \n6.  Over  40  nongovernment  organizations  (NGO)  are  active  in  the  sector  in  about  40 \nprovinces, more so in water than sanitation. This is often as an element of more broadly based \ndevelopment support than through focused projects. NGOs have been successful in fostering \ncommunity participation and demand-responsive approaches, but because of their small-scale \nand local focus, lessons have only been mainstreamed into national programs to a limited \ndegree. \n \nB.  Institutional Arrangements and Processes for Development Coordination  \n \n7.  The joint government-donor review of National Target Plan I concluded that there is a \nlack of coordination among the government, partner organizations, and NGOs. In 2006 MARD \nand several partner organizations, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB), established \nthe Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Partnership (RWSSP). The objective of the partnership \nis to maximize the efficiency of resource utilization within the sector through collaborations that \nwould harmonize the many policies and programs in existence. The partnership has regular \nmeetings to discuss the development progress of the sector in general and to discuss regulatory \nand technical issues. It also provides a forum for development partners to share lessons learned \nthrough the circulation of a bimonthly newsletter.  \n \n8.  The RWSSP is guided by a steering committee consisting of representatives of the \nvarious relevant ministries, such as MARD, Ministry of Construction, Ministry of Health, and \nMinistry of Education and Training. The daily activities are implemented by a coordinating unit, \n ", "34  Appendix 3 \nestablished within MARD and through specific technical working groups. The partnership has \nand active website, holds regular meetings and produces a bi-monthly newsletter. \n \n9.  One of the principal tasks before the RWSSP is to help formulate the Unified Sanitation \nSector Strategy and Action Plan, since sanitation (rural and urban) has been identified as a \npriority issue in Viet Nam. The Water and Sanitation Program is one of the lead organizations in \nthe  consultative  team  responsible  for  engaging  with  the  relevant  government  agencies \npreparing the sanitation strategy. ADB, too, is participating in this endeavor. \n \nC.  Achievements, Issues and Recommendations  \n \n10.  ADB's history of financing the water supply and sanitation sector in Viet Nam has mainly \nfocused on urban areas. ADB's goals include sustainable environmental management and \ninclusive social development under its Strategy 2020.1  Its support for RWSS will help ADB \nachieve its goals of providing access to infrastructure by rural communities and improving living \nstandards.  The proposed project will allow ADB to actively support the review of the national \nRWSS strategy, develop a capacity building strategy, and seek cooperation with development \npartners through the RWSSP. \n \n11.  In formulating the project, ADB has extensively consulted with the development partners \nthrough  formal  consultations  and  informal  consultations.  The  RWSSP  has  substantially \ncontributed to discuss and align the various partner approaches.  \n \n12.  A main issue to be discussed further is the issue of a possible sector wide approach, or \nbudget support as provided by Danida, AusAID, and the Netherlands. Although this approach \nwas  considered  for  this  project  as  well,  the  limited  implementation  capacity,  especially  at \nprovincial level, was seen as a major risk. Also, the fiduciary risks were considered to be too \nhigh. \n \n13.  Through a continuous dialogue with partners and the government and based on the \nlessons learned of the development partners, this issue should be further explored and possibly \nadapted in future ADB intervention in the RWSS sector in Viet Nam. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

Selection of subprojects. The project will start with orientation workshops in the project \nprovinces. These will enable district governments to introduce the project, its objectives and the \neligibility criteria for subproject selection. Following these workshops, districts can submit their \nproposed subprojects to the provincial project management unit (PPMUs). \n \n2.  In order for subprojects to be eligible, they have to demonstrate that piped water supply \nsystems with a central water source are the most economical way of supplying water in the \nsubproject areas and that they comply with the following criteria.  \n  \n(i)  Communes have relatively high population densities. Human and animal waste \ndisposal are likely to contaminate shallow ground water layer. \n(ii)  Shallow groundwater layers are polluted, making the water unfit for consumption \nor requiring extensive treatment. Pollutants include salinity, fluoride, arsenic, and \niron.  \n(iii)  Suitable  readily  accessible  drinking  water  sources  are  scarce.  The  shallow \ngroundwater or nearby surface water sources have too little yield in the dry \nseason to sustain the requirements of the population, leading to a drying up of \nshallow groundwater wells, surface streams, and springs. \n \n3.  The existence of one or a combination of these situations will justify the exploitation of \nraw water sourced from deep groundwater layers, or located outside the subproject area, and of \na central water treatment facility.  \n \n4.  Once a shortlist of subprojects has been established, the potential subprojects will be \nprioritized based on the following criteria and weighting: \n(i)  poverty ratio (40%), \n(ii)  ethnic minority ratio (30%), and \n(iii)  RWSS coverage ratios (30%). \n \n5.  The highest ranked subprojects with similar final scores will be reviewed and the final \nranking will be based on the per capita investment costs1 and the readiness for implementation. \nThe six sample subprojects covered by the project preparatory technical assistance 2 have been \ngiven the highest priority on the shortlist, since they comply with the eligibility criteria and are in \nan advanced stage of readiness. \n \n6.  Approval of subprojects. Following the preparation of the shortlist, final approval of \nsubprojects by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be based on a subproject appraisal \nreport that includes (i) a feasibility study; (ii) financial and economic analysis; (iii) a commitment \nletter from the provincial people\u2019s committee (PPC) to ensure the financial sustainability of the \nwater supply system; (iv) required safeguard documents on environment, resettlement, and \nethnic  minorities;  (v)  a  community-based  approach  and  information,  education,  and \ncommunication (CBA-IEC) plan; (vi) an agreement between the PPMU and Subproject CPCs on \nthe level of customers' contribution and payment mechanism for the water supply works; and \n(vii)  a  baseline  survey  covering  socioeconomic,  health,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation \ncoverage data.  \n                                                 \n1  Lower per capita investment costs will allow for more beneficiaries. \n2  ADB. 2008.

The  agreement  between  the  PPMU  and  communities  on  the  level  of  customers' \ncontribution  and  the  payment  mechanism  for  the  water  supply  works  should  set  out  the \npercentage (maximum 5%) of the investment costs to be paid by the customers to the provincial \ngovernment and the charging mechanisms. These connection charges may only be levied once \nthe systems have been commissioned and the charges must be affordable. Nonpayment may \nnot lead to disconnection of the customers. A deferred payment system is preferred.  \n \n9.  The CBA-IEC plan will include: (i) demonstrated commitment by the community to the \nproject; (ii) an agreed community participation strategy, including benchmarks and timelines; \nand  (iii)  an  agreed  plan  for  IEC,  including  identification  of  required  materials  and  training \napproaches. \n \n10.  It is expected that the 24 subprojects will be implemented over 3 years, with six to nine \nsubprojects implemented each year. The capacity of the provinces to implement a subproject \nwill be assessed by ADB on the progress made in implementing subprojects under the previous \nbatch. Provinces that perform well may be awarded more subprojects than those that perform \npoorly. \n \n11.  Preparation of subprojects. Following the approval of the subproject, implementation \nstarts with (i) setting up the community participation structure and implementing the CBA-IEC \nactivities, (ii) social preparation and training of the Viet Nam women's union for sanitation \nimplementation and operation of revolving funds, and (ii) preparation of the bidding documents. \n \n12.  The project will help to establish water and sanitation commune committees that  \n \n(i)  include  the  commune  leader,  representatives  from  the  commune  Viet  Nam \nwomen's union and other mass organizations, commune health officials, village \nleaders, male and female representatives from the water users, school teachers \nand health and sanitation promoters; \n(ii)  have a membership that is at least 40% female; and \n(iii)  have three working groups: a water users group, a community mobilization and \nIEC Implementation group, and an operation and maintenance group.   \n \n13.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe framework for all poverty reduction activities in Viet Nam is the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and \nGrowth Strategy (CPRGS), which recognizes that access to clean and safe water and sanitary toilets is a \nprecondition for poverty reduction, specifically for Viet Nam's rural population. Viet Nam\u2019s average gross \ndomestic product growth of 7.8% per year between 2002 and 2007 reduced the poverty rate from 28.9% to \n16.0%, but it did not close the gap between urban and rural areas. The poverty rate in rural areas (where 72% \nof the people live) is still 20.4%. In targeting rural areas this project will benefit populations with high levels of \npoverty. The project will facilitate poor households' access to project benefits by providing them with water \nconnections.  \n \nThe project will improve the health and welfare of household beneficiaries, hasten the reduction of rural \npoverty, and help to close urban\u2013rural income gap. The provision of clean water will improve the quantity and \nquality of marketable production, particularly from arable crops, livestock husbandry and fishing, which are the \nprimary income sources of poorer households. The project responds to the key challenges identified in the \nADB's country strategy and program, 2007\u22122010:a  to promote socially equitable and balanced development, \nsustainable environmental management, and institutional capacity strengthening. It likewise supports the \nmajor targets of Viet Nam\u2019s Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2006\u22122010b and the Vietnamese Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDG). These include reducing poverty to 10%\u201311%, creating 8 million new jobs and \nfacilitating the adoption of clean technologies and pollution minimization facilities. Providing clean water will \nreduce the need to boil water for consumption, thereby reducing the demand for firewood. This will contribute \nto the government target of increasing forest cover.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                             Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention (MDG) \n \n1. Key Issues \n \nOne reason for the comparatively higher poverty in rural areas is the slow growth of agriculture, which is still \nthe backbone of the rural economy. Agriculture, forestry and fisheries have 55% of the employed population \nbut grew by only 3.8% per year between 2001 and 2005. In contrast, industry grew by 10.2% and services by \n7.0% during the same period. However, agriculture, forestry and fisheries still accounted for 21% of the \ncountry\u2019s 2006 gross domestic product. The economy of all project areas and communities is predominantly \nagricultural. Poverty within rural area varies, with those provinces that are more dependent on agriculture \nhaving a higher poverty rate. It also varies among ethnic groups within provinces, with minority groups being \nmuch poorer. The poverty rate among ethnic minorities was estimated to be 60% in 2005. These groups \ngenerally live in rural areas and are more dependent of agriculture than the rest of the population.  \n \nA total of 24 subprojects in 30 communes in six provinces will be selected. They cover a range of activities \naimed at securing the sustainable provision of potable water and human waste management services to rural \ncommunities. The targeted communities have poverty rates ranging from 6.2% (Quang Binh) to 60% (Quang \nNam). Four of the targeted sites have poverty rates higher than the national average of 16.0%. One of the \ncore subprojects is the To Vieng town center of A Tieng commune, Tay Giang district in Quang Nam Province \nwhich has a large ethnic minority population. Ethnic minorities constitute 57.3% of the commune population. \nThe poverty rate in the To Vieng is 60%.  \n \nThe targets in Viet Nam\u2019s Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2006\u20132010 include increasing the proportion of \nthe population with access to fresh water in urban areas to 95% and in rural areas to 85%. Another target is to \ncreate a favorable environment for development of enterprises, with the focus being on raising the quality and \nefficiency of their production and business operations. Activities to achieve this target include reviewing and \ndeveloping strategies for ensuring a sustainable supply of clean water and sanitary waste management. Other \ntasks to which the project will contribute include enhancing the development of disadvantaged regions and \nareas  with  ethnic  minorities,  implementing  information  education  and  communication  programs,  and \npromoting public health and hygienic behavior.   \n \n ", "Appendix 10   55 \n2. Design Features.  \nThe project has a strong focus on poverty. It will contribute to poverty reduction not just by providing clean \nwater supplies and sanitation services but also by targeting the poor.  Poor households will receive free initial \nwater connection. Villagers from ethnic minorities will be consulted to determine the most suitable technical \ndesigns for water infrastructure. The component on improved household and public sanitation will provide \npoor households with grants to construct sanitation facilities. In addition, the water and sanitation commune \ncommittee (WSCC) will mobilize other government poverty programs to maximize the benefits of the project \nfor the poor households. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nRural water supply and sanitation is a particularly important concern in Viet Nam as some 38% of the rural \npopulation still lacks access to piped drinking water. Even where piped water is available, it often does not \nmeet safety standards. Pollution from salinity intrusion, livestock waste, commercial waste, and agricultural \nchemicals is increasingly endangers public health. Up to half the cases of communicable diseases in Viet \nNam are related to poor water supply and sanitation. \n \nThe  provinces  in  the  Central  Region  have  poverty  levels  that  are  higher  than  the  national  average; \ninvestments for water supply and sanitation by local governments are, therefore, limited. In the region, only \n10% to 15% of households are served by a private tap or public standpipe. About half of households obtain \nwater from shallow dug wells, which are easily susceptible to bacterial contamination and saline intrusion, and \n20%\u201325% of people in the central region receive water from relatively expensive private deep wells. The \nregion suffers from water shortages in the dry season and contaminated supplies from flooding of dug wells in \nthe wet season. Groundwater is heavily exploited for the irrigation of cash crops, resulting in frequent water \nshortages. Shallow groundwater contains high levels of salinity, turbidity, hardness, fluoride, iron, manganese, \naluminum, and pollution from humans, industry, and livestock. Surface water is often affected by turbidity, \norganic matter, and pollution by surface runoff that contains microorganisms and agricultural chemicals. River \nwater in the lower reaches is polluted by industry and settlements upstream. As a result, many rural \nhouseholds, particularly those with ethnic minority populations, have little choice on their source of drinking \nwater and they are sometimes forced to buy water from vendors or fetch water from long distances at high \ncosts. Poor households have to use highly polluted water for many of their daily water needs. \n \nThe low per capita consumption and low population density in remote areas makes attaching the communes \nto regional water supply services a financially unattractive proposition. However, most of these communities \nhave good potential to establish a local water supply service that can be developed to meet local demand for \nclean water.   \n \nIn the project areas, people complain about the poor quality of available water supplies. Complaints range \nfrom a bad smell to high particle content. Households in three project provinces also report an annual water \nshortage. Sanitation facilities vary among communes and 70%\u201390% of households use pit latrines. Waste \nwater and solid wastes are generally disposed of by being used as fertilizer on arable land or are tipped, \nuntreated, into the nearest river or pond.  Only 25% of people in the project area reported washing their hands \nafter using toilets.  Cholera, diarrhea, malaria, dengue fever, parasitic worms, skin diseases, and child \nmalnutrition are common in the project area. Sporadic outbreaks of cholera and other water-associated \ndiseases within the project areas lead to the loss of many days work and absence from school. In focus group \ndiscussions in the core subprojects, 46% of respondents reported that children could not attend schools \nsometimes because of water related sickness. A major benefit of choosing the water supply and sanitation \nservices sector is that it will improve community health. As a result it will increase the supply of labor available \nfor economic development activities and reduce the school time lost by children due to sickness.  \nProviding opportunities for communities to access improved services may not automatically result in their \nadoption. The IEC campaign can play a significant role in raising awareness, changing hygiene behavior, and \nmotivating people to pay for monthly water bills. The Quang Nam project area is being promoted as a model \nvillage. A principal benefit of living here is that each house was supplied with a flush toilet. As a consequence, \nthe number of work and/or school days lost to sickness is now insignificant. Emphasis will be given to \nplanning an effective IEC implementation plan for the project. \n ", "56  Appendix 10    \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Consultation and project disclosure meetings were held in all communes in each of the project areas. \nSeparate meetings were held with government officers at both provincial and district levels. Ethnic minority \ncommunities were represented in the meetings in Quang Nam Province. A focus group discussion was held \nwith women to get their perspective on the water and sanitation situation.   \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and \nmonitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No \nNo separate plan has been prepared. However, a community-based approach is included in the project and \ncommunity participation activities are mainstreamed through the water and sanitation committees of the \ncommunes, the implementation of an information and education campaign, and community mobilization \nactivities.  \n \nThe community participation activities are included in the resettlement framework, the indigenous peoples\u2019 \ndevelopment framework and the gender action plan.  A budget will be prepared for each subproject and will \nbe financed by loan funds. The common key features of the  community participation are:     \n \n(i)  representation of the local community, including members of ethnic minorities and women in \ndecision-making bodies, through water and sanitation committees of communes; \n(ii)  IEC will be conducted in each subproject with the active involvement of the community and \ncommunity mobilization will be undertaken through village health promoters; \n(ii)  consultations will be carried out in designing, implementing, and monitoring the subprojects and \nimpact avoidance and mitigation measures;  \n(iv)  project personnel and contractors will be oriented on the community-based approach; \n(v)  representatives of affected households, including women and members of ethnic minorities, will be \ninvolved as part of groups monitoring project activities at the community level and beneficiaries will \nbe consulted during overall project monitoring to validate data and provide views and suggestions \non issues unfolding during implementation; and     \n(vi)  community  consultation  will  be  carried  out  during  preparation  of  the  resettlement  plan  and \nindigenous peoples\u2019 development plan for the subprojects. \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  \n \nIn core subproject areas, women bear most of the responsibility for the productive work and household chores \nthat require water. The socio-economic survey which was carried out during project preparation revealed that \nwomen walk 3 to 7 kilometers daily and spend 3 to 4 hours daily to collect water. In the project area \nwaterborne diseases are common and women are the primarily responsible for taking care of family health. \nThe same survey revealed that 29% of women often got sick and could not attend work.   The time taken \naway from productive activities affects the quality of their lives. Access to improved water service and \nsanitation facilities would have a positive impact on family health.  \n \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014\naccess to and use of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-\nmaking process: \n  Gender plan           Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n \nThe following is the summary of the gender strategy from the gender action plan in Appendix 11. \n \nThe community-based approach of the project provides opportunities for women to participate in the planning \nof water and sanitation services. Women's active involvement in planning community water and sanitation \nfacilities will increase their voice in community affairs. Since women are responsible for family health, they will \nbe targeted in implementing the IEC for behavioural change. During community meetings, women will be \nprovided with project-specific information on free household connections and sanitation grants for poor \nhouseholds. Village women's unions will mobilize the community to create demand for water and sanitation \nservices and for the implementation and monitoring of IEC. \n \nThe provincial women\u2019s union will be responsible for managing the revolving loan funds for sanitation \nimprovement. Through the commune women\u2019s union, the provincial women\u2019s union will promote public \nawareness of the revolving loan fund, identify poor households eligible for sanitation grants, process loan  \n ", "Appendix 10   57 \napplications, channel payments and collect repayment, maintain accounts and records, and monitor sanitation \nfacilities financed through the loan fund and grant.  \n \nFor resettlement activities, women will be consulted in the consultation and disclosure meeting. For affected \nhouseholds, land-for-land compensation will be made and the new land use rights certificate will be registered \nin both the husband\u2019s and the wife\u2019s name. Compensation for trees, crops and assets on land will be paid to \nboth men and women. \nIII.

Rural water supply and sanitation is an important concern as about 38% of the rural \npopulation still lacks access to piped drinking water. The Central Region Rural Water Supply \nand Sanitation Sector Project will bring significant benefits to rural households in project \nprovinces. The primary objective of the project is to develop the rural water supply and \nsanitation subprojects initially in six provinces of Central Viet Nam. The main components \ninclude  the  development  of  (i)  sustainable  community-based  pipe  water  systems;  (ii) \nimproved  household  and  public  sanitation  systems;  (iii)  community-based  information, \neducation, and communication for health and hygiene behavior; and (iv) strengthening the \ninstitutional capacity of relevant stakeholders. The project will provide clean water and \nsanitation facilities to about 65,000 households.  A gender action plan (GAP) has been \nprepared to ensure that the different needs of men and women are incorporated in the \nplanning  of  community  water  and  sanitation  infrastructure  and  that  men  and  women \nparticipate meaningfully in the project components. The GAP will ensure equal opportunities \nfor men and women in access to project benefits. It is based on the gender analysis done \nduring the preparation of the project and is designed according to ADB's Policy on Gender \nand  Development  (1998).  The  GAP  will  be  implemented  by  the  provincial  project \nmanagement unit (PPMU) supported by a gender specialist, recruited under the consultant's \ncontract. The gender specialist will work with district women's union, commune women's \nunion and commune water and sanitation committee to implement the GAP.  \n \nA.  Background \n2.  The total population of Viet Nam is 86 million, of whom 50.8% are women. Women \nconstitute 49% of the labor force. The population in the project area is predominantly rural \n(78%).  The  Vietnamese  Millennium  Development  Goal  targets  in  the  rural  water  and \nsanitation sector include access to national standard clean water with volume of 60 liters per \nperson  per  day  for 85%  of the  rural  population  and  hygiene  latrines  for  70%  of  rural \nhouseholds.  \n \n3.  Viet Nam has made progress in improving gender equity and equality. Gender issues \nin  government  policy  on  rural  water  and  sanitation  are  addressed  by  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture and Rural Development (MARD) and by the Gender Strategy in Agriculture and \nRural Development.1  The gender objectives of the strategy are to  \n \n(i)  increase  awareness  of  gender  issues  in  the  industrialization  and \nmodernization of agriculture and rural areas following a socialist orientation; \n(ii)  increase rural women's access to and control of key resources, including \nland, credit, water, infrastructure, and public services; \n(iii)  integrate gender targets and sex-disaggregated monitoring and evaluation \ntools in policies, plans, programs and development projects of the ministry \nand the sector; \n(iv)  achieve  gender-sensitive  practices  and  gender  equality  in  agricultural \nresearch, public services and training; and \n(v)  increase  women's  empowerment  and  access  to  decision-making  in  key \ninstitutions  including  MARD,  the  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Rural \nDevelopment,  people\u2019s  committees  at  all  levels,  agricultural  universities, \ninstitutes, colleges, vocational schools and enterprises. \n \n                                                 \n1  Issued under the Decision of the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, No. 4776 QD-BNN/TCCB, \ndated 28 October 2003. \n ", "Appendix 11  59 \nB.  Gender and Water Use and Hygiene Behavior \n4.  In  the  core  subproject  area,  women  bear  most  of  the  responsibility  related  to \nproductive work and household chores that require water. The socioeconomic survey which \nwas carried out during project preparation revealed that women walk 3 to 7 kilometers daily \nand spend 3 \u2212 4 hours daily to collect water. In the project area, waterborne disease is \ncommon  and  women  are  primarily  responsible  for  taking  care  of  family  health,  which \noccupies a significant amount of their productive time. The same survey revealed that 29% \nof women often got sick and could not attend work. Limited access to water and sanitation \nfacilities in the rural areas is also a health and safety risk to women and girls. Although \nwomen provide most of the labor in collection and use of water, they have little power in \ndecision making on water and sanitation planning. Most programs on water and sanitation \ndo not include women in the planning and implementation phase. Information education and \ncommunication programs often do not target women adequately.   \n \n5.  At the national level, 33% of the management staff of the standing office for National \nTarget Plan II of MARD are women. However, in the project provinces this figure is only \n18%. The inadequate representation of female staff at the provincial level limits the extent to \nwhich  water  and  sanitation  programs  address  gender  issues  in  both  planning  and \nimplementation phases.   \n \nC.

Overview \n \n1.  The project comprises six core subprojects, with one subproject in each of the six project \nprovinces.  A  separate  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  for  each  subproject.  These \nresettlement plans will serve as a model for subsequent resettlement plans for other subprojects \nunder the sector loan. \n \n2.  Based on the likely level of resettlement impacts, the subprojects will be category B \nunder  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB). \nAccordingly, only short resettlement plans will be required. The project preparatory technical \nassistance (PPTA) consultant and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development have \nprepared  a  resettlement  plan  for  each  of  the  core  subprojects.  These  documents  involve \nidentification  of  affected  households  and  potentially  affected  households  in  each  of  the \nprovinces. The extent (e.g., area of land and type of asset) and type (temporary or permanent) \nof impacts were also identified. The resettlement plans were prepared in consultation with \naffected people and will be fully disclosed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Public Communications \nPolicy (2005).  \n \n3.  A  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  to  address  the  other  subprojects  in \naccordance  with  ADB  policy.  The  key  components  are:  definition  of  the  cutoff  date,  an \nentitlement matrix, the process for preparing future resettlement plans, minimum requirements \nfor  surveys  (detailed  measurement  survey,  socioeconomic  survey,  and  replacement  cost \nsurvey),  consultation,  grievance  redress  and  disclosure  requirements,  controls  relating  to \nvulnerability,  gender  and  ethnicity,  institutional  arrangements,  monitoring  and  evaluation \nrequirements, and an implementation schedule. \n \nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts\u2014Core Subprojects \n \n  1.  Tien Loc Commune, Han Loc District, Thanh Hoa Province \n4.  Activities in this commune will require 7,536 m2 of permanent and 4,000 m2 of temporary \nland acquisition. Of the permanent land acquisition, 2% is residential land, 68% is public land \nleased for agricultural purposes, 5% is publicly-owned land leased for fish or shrimp ponds and \n24% is forest land. Land acquisition affects 124 households. There is no demolition of houses or \nstructures required, and no impacts on institutions or commercial premises. \n  2.  Dien Yen Commune, Dien Chau District, Nghe An Province \n \n5.  Activities  in  this  commune  will  require  32,000  m2  of  permanent  and  1,502  m2  of \ntemporary land acquisition. Of the permanent land acquisition, 31% is public land leased for \nagricultural purposes and 69% is fish or shrimp ponds. Land acquisition affects 48 households. \nNo  demolition  of  houses  or  structures  will  be  required,  and  there  will  be  no  impacts  on \ninstitutions or commercial premises. \n \n   \n ", "62  Appendix 12 \n  3.  Thach Bang and Thach Kim Commune, Loc Ha District, Ha Tinh Province \n \n6.  Activities in these communes will require 4,900 m2 of permanent and 28,162 m2 of \ntemporary land acquisition. None of the permanent land acquisition is residential land, 98% is \nnonagricultural  land,  and  2%  is  public  land.  Land  acquisition  affects  175  households.  No \ndemolition of houses or structures will be required, and there will be no impacts on institutions or \ncommercial premises. \n \n  4.  Thanh Trach Commune, Bo Trach District, Quang Binh Province \n \n7.  Activities in this commune will require 7,500 m2 of permanent and 1,008 m2 of temporary \nland acquisition required. All of the permanent land acquisition is public land. Temporary land \nacquisition affects 113 households. No demolition of houses or structures is required, and there \nwill be no impacts on institutions or commercial premises. \n \n  5.  To Vieng Commune, Tay Giang District, Quang Nam Province \n \n8.  Activities  in  this  commune  will  require  7,157  m2  of  permanent  and  22,324  m2  of \ntemporary land acquisition. Of the permanent land acquisition, 5% is agricultural land, 5% is \nforest land, 89% is nonagricultural land, and 1% is public land. Land acquisition affects 13 \nhouseholds. No demolition of houses or structures is required, and there will be no impacts on \ninstitutions or commercial premises. \n \n  6.  Tay Thuan and Tay Giang Communes, Tay Son District, Binh Dinh Province \n9.  Activities  in  this  commune  will  require  2,048  m2  of  permanent  and  12,718  m2  of \ntemporary land acquisition. Of the permanent land acquisition, 83% is agricultural land, and \n17%  is  residential.  Land  acquisition  affects  150  households.  No  demolition  of  houses  or \nstructures is required, and there will be no impacts on institutions or commercial premises. \n10.  The land acquisition requirements and loss of crops as a result of the land acquisition \nrequirements for the 6 core subprojects are summarized in Tables A12.1 and A12.2.  \n \nC.  Legal and Policy Framework \n11.  The  policy  framework  and  entitlements  of  the  project  are  based  upon  Vietnamese \nlegislation, principally the Land Law, 2003; Decree 197/CP, 2004 modified in 2006 to cover \ncompensation, support, and resettlement when land is recovered by the State; Circular 116, \n2004 on guiding the implementation of Decree 197; and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy, \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), Policy on Gender and Development (1998), and Public \nCommunications. With the promulgation of Decree 197/CP, 2004 and Decree 17/2006, the \ngovernment\u2019s policy and legal framework on resettlement has moved much closer toward the \nprinciples underlying ADB\u2019s policies.  \n12.  In case of discrepancies between the government\u2019s laws, regulations, and procedures \nand ADB's policies and requirements, ADB's policies and requirements will prevail. This is also \nin accordance with Decree 131/2006 which stipulates that for projects financed by overseas \ndevelopment assistance, partner organizations\u2019 policies apply. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 12  63 \nD.  Ethnicity, Vulnerability and Gender Issues \n13.  One  of  the  core  subprojects  (Quang  Nam  Province)  is  located  in  an  area  with  a \nsubstantial ethnic minority population. Of the six villages in the project area, five are completely \npopulated by members of ethnic minorities, while 20% of the population in Ag Rong (the district \ncapital) is from an ethnic minority. A separate ethnic minority development plan was prepared \nfor this subproject and it found that land acquisition would not adversely affect livelihoods as the \nextent of acquisition will be minor. \n14.  The  resettlement  framework  establishes  specific  actions  to  address  ethnic  minority \nissues  and  those  affecting  other  vulnerable  households  which  may  be  affected  by  future \nsubprojects. \n \n15.  A project gender action plan has been included in the resettlement framework to address \nresettlement-related issues, particularly those associated with women. \n \nE.  Income Restoration Measures \n \n16.  No  relocation  is  required  for  this  project,  and  land  acquisition  is  relatively  minor. \nAccordingly, no specific income restoration measures have been designed. Socioeconomic \nimpacts  will  be  carefully  monitored  by  an  external  monitoring  agency  and,  should  future \nsubprojects have negative livelihood impacts, suitable income restoration measures will be \ndeveloped.  The  entitlement  matrix  includes  a  transition  allowance  to  assist  in  protecting \nlivelihoods should it be necessary for affected households to participate in such a program. \n \nF.  Resettlement Plan Preparation and Implementation \n \n17.  The six provincial peoples committees (PPC) will be responsible for resettlement plan \npreparation and implementation. The resettlement plans for the six core subprojects will need to \nbe updated once the final designs have been completed. Upon completion of detailed designs, \na detailed measurement survey will be completed, which will confirm the number of affected \npeople and the extent of impact. Compensation rates will also be updated for all categories of \nlost assets and allowance based on replacement cost surveys undertaken at that time. Updating \nof  the  resettlement  plans  and  preparation  of  any  resettlement  plans  for  other  (as  yet \nunidentified) subprojects will be undertaken by the project implementation consultant with the \nsupport of the respective PPCs. \n \nG.  Information Disclosure, Community Consultation and Local Participation \n  \n18.  Affected people were involved in focus group discussions and individual meetings during \nresettlement plan preparation. The aim of this consultation was to present preliminary designs of \nthe water supply system, the potential impacts, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy and \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), proposed entitlements, institutional arrangements and \nimplementation schedule. The concerns and suggestions provided by the affected people during \nthis process were then incorporated in the resettlement plans.  \n \n19.  A  public  information  booklet  has  been  prepared  and  the  resettlement  plans  and \nresettlement framework will be fully disclosed prior to project appraisal. \n \n \n \n ", "64  Appendix 12 \nH.  Monitoring and Supervision \n \n20.  The project performance monitoring unit will be responsible for internal monitoring of \ncompensation and allowance activities. Progress reports will be submitted to ADB every quarter. \nAn independent monitoring agency specialized in social sciences will be recruited and mobilized \nbefore commencement of any compensation activities, including the detailed measurement \nsurvey. The agency will be required to submit quarterly reports on the progress of compensation \nand income restoration program implementation and make any necessary recommendations.   \n  \nI.  Resettlement Entitlements \n \n21.  The resettlement entitlements have been designed to cover compensation of all losses \nand other allowances. Severe impacts are not anticipated as a result of this project, but, to \nensure a framework exists should such an impact be experienced in future subprojects, the \nentitlement matrix in the resettlement framework provides entitlements for severely impacted \nhouseholds. \n \n22.
