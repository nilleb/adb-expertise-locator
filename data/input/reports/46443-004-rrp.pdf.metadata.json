The  project  will  enhance  climate  resilience  and  support  economic  competitiveness, \nequity  and  the  environment,  as  outlined  in  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Urban \nOperational Plan.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe six  GMS  countries are geographically  contiguous  and form  an  important  cluster of \neconomic  activity.4 Although their respective  level  of  economic  development  varies  widely,  the \nurban  development  trajectories  of  the  GMS  countries  are  increasingly  similar.  Key  drivers  of \nurban development and regional integration include the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \nEconomic  Community  (anticipated  in  2015),  increased  domestic  and  international  migration \nwithin  the  region,  the  economic  rise  of  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  significant \nimprovements in road transformation and connectivity, the spread of and improvements in cell \nphone  and  internet  coverage,  and  the  great  potential  and  growing  demand  for  tourism  and \nrelated  activities.  The  three  economic  corridors  defined  under  the  GMS  framework  form  a \nnetwork of important routes that connect some of the largest cities in the GMS, including Ha Noi, \nHo Chi Minh City, Bangkok, Phnom Penh, Kunming, and Nanning.5 \n \n4. \nThis  project  in  Viet  Nam,  together  with  the  projects  in  Cambodia  and  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic,  represent  the  second  phase  of  the  GMS  Corridor  Towns  Development \nProject in these countries, which supported urban development along the East\u2013West Economic \nCorridor and the Southern Economic Corridor.6 The focus on developing towns along economic \ncorridors aims to maximize the benefits of increased trade and traffic flows, so as to strengthen \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Second Greater Mekong Subregion Corridor Towns \n\nDevelopment Project (TA 8425-REG). \n\n3  ADB. 2012. Urban Operational Plan, 2012\u20122020. Manila. \n4   The  GMS  countries  are  Cambodia,  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (specifically  Yunnan  Province  and  Guangxi \n\nZhuang Autonomous Region), Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n\n5   The three economic corridors are the North\u2013South Economic Corridor, the East\u2013West Economic Corridor, and the \nSouthern  Economic  Corridor.  See:  ADB.  2011.  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Economic  Cooperation  Program \nStrategic Framework, 2012\u20132022. Manila. \n\n6  ADB.  2012.

Manila  (Loan  2931-LAO);  ADB.  2012.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of \nDirectors:  Proposed  Loan  and  Administration  of  Grant  to  Viet  Nam  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Corridor \nTowns Development Project. Manila (Loan 2969-VIE). \n\n\f2 \n\ntheir  competitiveness  and  catalyze  wider  economic  growth  in  the  region.  The  development  of \nenvironmental  infrastructure  will  promote  green  growth  and  climate  resilience  in  these  towns. \nThe  project  supports  the  first  four  strategic  thrusts  of  the  GMS  Strategic  Framework,  2012\u2012\n2022: (i) strengthening infrastructure linkages; (ii) facilitating cross-border trade, investment, and \ntourism;  (iii)  enhancing  private  sector  participation  and  competitiveness;  and  (iv)  developing \nhuman resources.7  \n \n5. \nThe strategic location of the corridor towns provides the stimulus for increased trade and \ninvestment.  Access  to  markets  will  provide  many  incentives  for  local  economies  in  the \nhinterlands  of the  corridor  towns. Given  these  development  opportunities,  and  the  rapid  urban \npopulation  growth  and  expansion  in  these  areas,  several  corridor  towns  now  face  growing \ndemands for urban infrastructure and essential support services, including Bac Giang, Mong Cai, \nand Sa Pa in Viet Nam along the North\u2013South Economic Corridor. \n \n6. \nBac Giang is the administrative capital of Bac Giang Province, and located 50 kilometers \n(km) northeast of Ha Noi and 45 km from the Noi Bai International airport. In 2013 the city had a \npopulation of about 150,000, about half of which (72,000) was urban. Characteristics of the city \nthat favor  development and  investment  include  its  strategic  location  on key  transport  corridors \nthat  link  population  centers  and  ports  and  provide  access  to  larger  markets,  principally  in  the \nPRC and within the Ha Noi capital region.  \n \n7. \nMong Cai is a border town located in Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh Province in northeastern Viet Nam; it \nis  located  opposite  Dongxing  town,  in  Guangxi  Province  of  the  PRC.  The  population  of  Mong \nCai  was  about  95,000  people  in  2013,  of  which  some  56,000  were  urban.  The  economy  is \ntypical  of  many  border  towns,  with  trade  and  services  accounting  for  71%  of  the  town\u2019s  gross \ndomestic product in 2013. The economy and population are both expanding rapidly (population \nis  expected  to  exceed  150,000  by  2020).  Strategic  economic  investment  is  ongoing,  including \nimprovement  of  cross-border  facilities  with  the  PRC,  and  construction  of  an  expressway \nconnection to Hai Phong and Ha Noi. The potential designation of a Mong Cai Economic Zone \nwill increase the town\u2019s economic competitiveness. Despite the vibrant economy, investment in \nessential environmental infrastructure and services is insufficient. \n \nSa  Pa  is  a  small  town  located  about  35  km  from  Lao  Cai  City  in  Lao  Cai  Province  in \n8. \nnorthwestern Viet Nam. The town\u2019s population numbered about 54,000 in 2013, with an urban \npopulation  of  almost  15,000.  Sa  Pa  is  an  international  tourist  destination  and  highland \nagricultural  area,  where  strategic  corridor  investments  in  transport  infrastructure  are  placing \nincreasing  development  pressures  on  the  high-quality  mountain  landscapes  and  cultural \ndiversity  of  the  predominantly  ethnic  minority  population.  Tourism  has  increased  rapidly \nfollowing the opening of the Ha Noi\u2013Lao Cai expressway in 2014, providing both the opportunity \nand  challenge  to  urgently  address  deficiencies  in  basic  urban  infrastructure  and  green  city \nplanning to secure a sustainable future for the town. \n \n9. \nLessons.  Key  lessons  from  completed  or  ongoing  ADB-financed  projects  in  urban \ndevelopment, including the first phase of the GMS Corridor Towns Development Project in Viet \nNam, are: (i) civic participation and demand-driven development activities enhance the sense of \nlocal  ownership;  (ii)  capacity  building  is  a  long-term  effort  requiring  proper  planning,  adequate \ntargeting,  and  up-front  implementation;  (iii)  institutional  and  policy  reform  should  be  based  on \nrealistic  assessments  of  timing,  resource  requirements,  and  political  will;  (iv)  financial  cost \n\n                                                \n7   ADB.  2011.  The  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Economic  Cooperation  Program  Strategic  Framework,  2012\u20122022.  \n\nManila.  \n\n \n\n\frecovery  is  critical  to  project  sustainability;  (v)  streamlined  approaches  to  procurement  and \ncontract  packaging  ensure  effective  implementation;  and  (vi)  strong  executing  agency  \nleadership and adequate selection of project staff with clearly defined roles and responsibilities \nare crucial for effective implementation. Transport and trade connections with nearby cities and \nregions are also critical for overall project success. The project is responsive to these lessons; it \nhas a strong capacity development component, optimizes the value of community involvement, \nadopts a business-like approach to revenue collection and operation and maintenance (O&M), \nand  includes  studies  to  explore  issues  (e.g.,  relating  to  connectivity).  Executing  agencies  will \nalso receive start-up support on ADB procedures upon project commencement.  \n \n10. \nRelated  policies  and  strategies.  The  project  is  aligned  with  government  policies, \nincluding (i) the Socio-economic Development Strategy, 2011\u20132020 and the associated Socio-\neconomic  Development  Plan;  and  (ii)  other  relevant  national  policies  and  strategies,  including \nthe Green Growth Strategy and Draft Action Plan, the Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan, \nand  the  National  Program  on  Urban  Development  in  2011\u20132020. 8 The  Socio-economic \nDevelopment  Plan  is  the  main  element  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  strategic  plan  with  a  focus  on  (i)  linking \nurban  and  rural  centers,  (ii)  improving  urban  planning  and  management,  (iii)  developing  small \nand  medium-sized  towns  and  cities,  and  (iv)  developing  economic  corridors  by  building \neconomic  nodes.  Prosperous  urban  centers  located  in  economic  corridors  are  central  to \neconomic  progress;  this  project  can  contribute  through  provision  of  essential  environmental \ninfrastructure and urban investments. \n \n11. \nThe  project  is  in  line  with  the  ADB  country  partnership  strategy  for  Viet  Nam;  ADB\u2019s \nUrban Operational Plan; the GrEEEn Cities Approach, which has been piloted in several cities \nin Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam; ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan; the \nGMS Strategic Framework; and the GMS Regional Investment Framework Implementation Plan, \n2014\u20132018. 9  The  towns  under  this  project  were  selected  and  prioritized  under  the  GMS \nRegional  Investment  Framework.  As  part  of  project  preparation,  strategic  local  economic \ndevelopment  plans  (SLEDPs)\u2014which  present  the  medium-term  strategy,  planning,  and \ninvestment  plan  for  each  town\u2014have  been  prepared.  The  SLEDPs  are  based  on  technical \nassessments  of  potential  investments  in  economic  development,  the  environment,  equity,  and \ngood governance, as well as extensive stakeholder consultations and discussions. The SLEDPs \nare intended to enhance existing provincial development and master plans and anchor these to \nthe regional GMS context, and will be refined and endorsed during project implementation. \n \n\n                                                \n8  Government  of  Viet  Nam,  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment.  2011.

This \n23. \nwill  be  achieved  through  improved  wastewater  management  (all  three  towns),  urban  roads \nupgrading  (Bac  Giang  and  Sa  Pa),  drainage  upgrading  (all  three  towns),  riverbank  protection \n(Mong Cai), and town center enhancement (Sa Pa). The choices reflect the priorities accorded \nby  the  government  and  were  selected  through  the  application  of  criteria  to  support  economic \ncompetitiveness,  equity,  and  the  environment  (para.  2).  They  are  technically  feasible  and \nemploy  civil  works  and  O&M  technology  that  can  be  managed  by  provincial  and  municipal \nauthorities.  Climate-resilient  design  has  been  ensured,  including,  for  example,  using  elevated \nfacility foundations,  use of  berms  and  bunds,  and  sufficient  drainage for wastewater treatment \nplants (Bac Giang  and Mong  Cai);  an  increase in  the  pumping  capacity for  stormwater  pumps \n(Bac Giang); grading, surfacing; and increasing lateral drainage of roads to handle flood levels \n(Bac  Giang  and  Sa  Pa);  and  increasing  the  height  of  riverbank  protection  (Mong  Cai). \nAppropriate capacity building and training are included in the project design.   \n \n24. \nThe  project  recognizes  the  weak  institutional  capacity  of  the  provincial  and  municipal \nauthorities to plan and manage urban infrastructure, and deliver essential urban services. This \nwill be addressed through targeted training and institutional capacity building.   \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nAn  economic  analysis  was  undertaken  to  determine  the  viability  of  the  subproject \n25. \ncomponents, using the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as the indicator. The base case \nresults indicate that all components are economically viable with an estimated EIRR exceeding \nthe assumed economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. The computed EIRR is 15%\u201321% for \nBac Giang, 14%\u201319% for Mong Cai, and 15% for Sa Pa. All subprojects were generally viable \nunder  adverse  scenarios,  including  a  10%  increase  in  capital  or  O&M  costs,  and  a  10% \nreduction or 1-year delay in benefits.10  \n \nA financial  analysis  was  conducted for  each  city\u2019s  revenue  and  nonrevenue-generating \n26. \nsubprojects  to  confirm  the  sustainability  of  the  investment. 11  It  established  that  sufficient \ncounterpart  funds  for  the  investment  components  will  be  available  for  all  towns.  None  of  the \npublic entities involved in the operation of the respective project components (e.g., sanitation or \nroad  maintenance)  is  corporatized.  All  are  government  sector  units,  and  none  have  separate \naccounts.  Therefore  a  financial  internal  rate  of  return  has  not  been  calculated.  The  tariffs \ncollected for the revenue generating components (e.g., wastewater) currently do not fully cover \nO&M  costs,  but  will  be  adjusted  over  time  to  meet  these  requirements.  Additional  funding  (if \nneeded  to  meet  full  O&M  costs)  will  be  allocated  and  made  available  by  the  provincial \ngovernments, a commitment that has been covenanted in the loan agreement. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n27. \nThe  three  executing  agencies  have  implemented  international  development  partner-\nfinanced  projects,  but  all  will  receive  start-up  support  on  ADB  procedures.  Capacity \ndevelopment  and  training  will  be  provided  to  the  PMUs  on  financial  and  procurement \n\n                                                \n10  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nmanagement and fund disbursement. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  of  Viet  Nam  and  the  Bac  Giang  PPC, \nQuang  Ninh  PPC,  and  Lao  Cai  PPC.    The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual.12 \n \n\n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n \n28. \nBased  on  the  poverty  and  social  analysis,  the  project  is  classified  as  general \nintervention. 13 The  overall  project  social  impacts  are  expected  to  be  positive,  with  expected \nimprovements  to  the  quality  of  life  of  people  in  the  three  towns.  The  project  will  result  in \nimproved climate-resilient infrastructure in each town that benefits all inhabitants, including the \nurban  poor  and  other  vulnerable  groups.  The  affordability  of  sanitation  services  will  not  be  a \nconcern because house connections are included in the project cost and will be provided at no \ncharge. Proposed wastewater tariffs have been assessed as affordable for low-income groups. \nRiverbank  protection  in  Mong  Cai  will  improve  flood  protection  for  the  project-affected  people, \ntheir  homes,  and  their  property.  Poor  and  vulnerable  households  located  in  low-lying,  flood-\nprone areas and who lack basic environmental sanitation will benefit the most. \n \n29. \nThe  projects  are  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  gender  analysis \nconcluded  that  women  in  the  subproject  areas  are  at  potential  risk  of  not  realizing  the  full \npotential of project benefits and opportunities if gender issues concerning women\u2019s employment \nopportunities  and  sector  representation  in  decision  making  are  not  mainstreamed  in  project \nactivities.  Accordingly,  a gender  action  plan  has been  prepared that  aims  to  (i)  ensure gender \nissues  are  mainstreamed  in  project  planning  and  implementation,  (ii)  address  specific  impacts \nand  risks  that  may  affect  women  differently  or  disproportionally  compared  to  men,  and  (iii) \nenhance women\u2018s participation in project benefits.  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n30. \nSocial  safeguards.  The  project  is  classified  as  safeguard  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement.  Two  resettlement  plans,  one  for  Bac  Giang  and  one  for  Mong  Cai,  have  been \nprepared for components that will trigger land acquisition and resettlement impacts. A combined \nresettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  plan  (Resettlement  and  Ethnic  Minority  Development \nPlan) has been prepared for Sa Pa\u2014indigenous peoples safeguards are triggered (category B), \nbut limited to land acquisition and resettlement.14  \n \n31. \nA total of 16.46 hectare of land will be acquired, affecting 659 households or about 2,788 \naffected persons. Three households (15 persons) will require physical relocation, 21 households \nwill experience loss of more than 10% of income-generating assets, 1 household will lose all its \nproduction  land,  and  28  will  have  their  remaining  agricultural  areas  rendered  too  small  for \ncontinued  cultivation.  Other  impacts  include  partial  loss  of  land  and  of  graves.  The  land \nacquisition and resettlement cost ($2.54 million) will be provided through counterpart financing.   \nAll  affected  households  are  entitled  to  compensation  and  rehabilitation  assistance.  Income \nrestoration  (cash  assistance  and  skills  training)  will  be  provided  to  severely  affected  and \nvulnerable households.  \n\n                                                \n12 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy  and  Gender  Action  Plan  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n14 Resettlement Plan: Bac Giang; Resettlement Plan: Mong Cai; and Resettlement and Ethnic Minority Development \n\nPlan: Sa Pa  (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fIndigenous  peoples.  For  the  Sa  Pa  subproject,  indigenous  peoples  safeguards  are \n32. \ntriggered  but  limited  to  land  acquisition;  a  resettlement  and  ethnic  minority  development  plan \nhas been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). The indigenous peoples safeguard category is B. \n \n33. \nEnvironment safeguards. The project is classified as category B for the environment in \naccordance  with  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  One  initial  environmental  examination \n(IEE)  and  three  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs)  (one  per  town)  have  been \nprepared. 15  The  proposed  subprojects  are  not  expected  to  cause  irreversible  adverse \nenvironment  impacts.  Mitigation  measures  for  identified  impacts  related  to  siting,  design, \nconstruction, and operation have been incorporated in the EMPs. In addition, it is recommended \nthat the potential impacts of climate change and natural hazards (e.g., flooding and earthquakes) \non the project be integrated into the design and engineering stage as part of the IEE assessment \nwhenever feasible, practical, and appropriate. At the detailed design stage, the IEE and EMPs will \nbe updated and finalized. \n \nThe  final  EMPs  will  form  part  of  the  contract  bidding  documents  and  be  incorporated  in \n34. \nthe  works  contracts.  Environmental  considerations  during  design,  and  allocation  of  sufficient \nfunding  for  O&M  will  help  mitigate  potential  adverse  impacts  during  operation.  Effective \nenvironmental  monitoring  during  implementation  will  be  ensured  by  including  budget  and \ninstitutional arrangements for EMP implementation and monitoring. EMP  implementation  will  be \nensured  by  a  designated  environment  officer  in  the  project  coordination  unit,  whose \nresponsibilities are detailed in the EMPs.   \n \nClimate change projections and climate change impacts on the project are discussed in \n35. \nthe  climate  vulnerability  and  risk  assessment  section  of  the  IEE.  The  cost  of  climate  change \nadaptation  is  estimated  to  be  $3.15  million,  or  about  3%  of  the  ADB  loan.  Public  consultations \nwere conducted through formal and informal group discussions in October 2014 and January\u2013\nFebruary 2015 and will be ongoing during implementation. Grievance redress mechanisms have \nbeen  established  in  synergy  with  social  safeguards.  In  compliance  with  ADB  requirements,  the \nsafeguard documents have been posted on ADB\u2019s website. \n \nResettlement and environment documents have been prepared in consultation with local \n36. \ncommunities  and  are  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  SPS  and  Viet  Nam\u2019s  laws  and  regulations. \nThe  documents  have  been  endorsed,  approved, and  posted  on the  ADB website. A  grievance \nredress mechanism will help to facilitate resolution of complaints regarding project performance. \nThe resettlement plans, IEE, and EMPs will be updated and disclosed after detailed design and \ncleared by ADB prior to contract awards. The project towns have demonstrated a high level of \ncommitment to environmental and social safeguards, and have allocated their own resources for \nland  acquisition  and \ninclude  designated \nresponsibilities for safeguards monitoring. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nImplementation  arrangements \n\nresettlement. \n\nThe integrated benefits and impacts from the project are expected to outweigh the costs. \n37. \nThe overall risk is assessed as medium.
