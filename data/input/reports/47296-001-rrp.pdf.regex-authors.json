THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Northwest Region Power Transmission Line Project.1 \n   \n2.  The project aims to (i) improve power transmission network capacity and reliability in the \nKarakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  regions  of  northwestern  Uzbekistan,  (ii)  reduce  transmission \nlosses, and (iii) improve the operational efficiency of the power sector. The project components \ninclude  (i)  the  construction  of  a  220-kilovolt  (kV)  single-circuit  overhead  transmission  line \napproximately 364 kilometers (km) in length; (ii) the expansion, rehabilitation, and construction \nof  three  substations,  and  (iii)  institutional  development,  capacity  building,  and  project \nmanagement.2 \n \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Uzbekistan has one of the fastest-growing economies in Central Asia (the growth rate \naveraged 8% for 2010\u20132014), and aspires to become an upper middle-income country by 2020. \nGenerally stable macroeconomic conditions and robust growth are expected to continue, with \nUzbekistan seeking to build a highly developed and diversified industrial and export base. The \nKarakalpakstan and Khorezm regions are located in the western part of Uzbekistan, with 3.3 \nmillion  residents  (or  12%  of  the  total  population),  and  will  continue  to  attract  large-scale \nindustrial  investment  projects. 3  A  reliable  power  supply  is  critical  to  support  industrial \ndevelopment in this area. Power demand in the region is forecast to grow at 3%, double the \nexpected national average rate of 1.5% over the medium term.  \n \n4.  The country has ample primary energy resources.4 The total installed capacity for power \ngeneration in the country is about 13,500 megawatts (MW) including thermal power (86%) and \nhydropower (14%). In 2014, the country generated about 54,400 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of \nelectric  power  and  exported  1,400  GWh  (2.6%).  Uzbekistan\u2019s  power  transmission  system \nconsists of 1,850 km of 500 kV lines, 6,200 km of 220 kV lines, and 15,300 km of 110 kV lines. \nThe  government  owns  and  manages  the  energy  sector  in  Uzbekistan.  The  Joint-Stock \nCompany Uzbekenergo is a vertically integrated and a 100% state-owned monopoly in charge \nof electricity generation, transmission, and distribution; it operates under the supervision and \nregulation of the Cabinet of Ministers. The sector is corporatized with separate business units, \nand further commercialization of Uzbekenergo is planned.     \n \n5.  Uzbekistan\u2019s development priorities stress structural change and increased productivity. \nEnergy efficiency is a key part of the energy sector strategy. The government adopted policy \nand legal frameworks with clear goals to reduce energy intensity and losses; and action plans \ncovering investments and institutional change. In March 2015, the government approved a 5-\nyear  rolling  Program  of  Measures  to  Promote  Structural  Reforms,  Modernization  and \nDiversification of Production in 2015\u20132019. The program aims to ensure an adequate and \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Northwest Region \nPower Transmission Line Project (TA 8618) in February 2014. \n3  Karakalpakstan covers  about 37% of the land area of Uzbekistan and has a population of 1.7 million and rich in \nnatural resources, while Khorezm, an agro-industrial region, has a population of 1.6 million. \n4  Including 1.8 trillion cubic meters of proven natural gas reserves, 590 million barrels of proven oil reserves, and \nabout 3 billion tons of recoverable coal reserves. ", "2   \nreliable power system; and improved management, operations, and performance of utilities \nbased on commercial principles. To improve energy efficiency, one combined-cycle gas turbine \n(CCGT) unit was commissioned in Navoi thermal power plant (TPP) and four more CCGT units \nare  under  preparation  with  confirmed  funding  from  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for \nreplacement of old and inefficient gas-fired steam turbine generation units.5 A loss-reduction \nprogram was initiated that uses advanced meters to increase collections and reduce losses.6 \nElectricity  tariffs  have  been  raised  steadily  since  2004  to  ensure  financial  sustainability. \nFinancial  transparency  has  improved  since  Uzbekenergo  (with  ADB  assistance),  adopted \nexternal audits based on the International Standards on Auditing starting with fiscal year (FY) \n2011.  \n   \n6.   Key  challenges  in  the  sector  are  deteriorating  infrastructure  and  unreliable  power \nsupply. The existing Takhiatash TPP is the only power station located in the northwest region. \nADB has approved a loan7 to finance construction of two CCGT units (230\u2013280 MW each) in \nTakhiatash TPP for replacement of old and inefficient gas-fired steam turbine generation units. \nHowever, because of inadequate investment, the existing power transmission network has \nlimited capacity to transmit additional power. The power transmission system was designed \nduring the Soviet era with the objective of leveraging the diversified energy and water resources \nin  the  region.  Substation  locations  and  line  routings  did  not  take  country  borders  into \nconsideration, as these were then irrelevant with the result that the existing transmission line \nfrom Takhiatash  to  Navoi  passes  through Turkmenistan.  Although the  transmission  assets \nbelong to Uzbekistan, difficulties in maintaining these causes frequent and prolonged outages \nwhich  reduces  production  rate  and  hampers  socioeconomic  development,  leading  to \ndissatisfaction  among  the  population.  Transmission  capacity  limitations  mean  the  excess \nproduction from TPP is difficult to evacuate, and Takhiatash TPP must adjust its production to \nthe highly variable local demand, result in wear and aging of generation blocks, and rendering \nits operations economically inefficient.   \n \n7.  In addition, most of the transmission facilities are aging and require rehabilitation and \nmodernization (the Khorezm substation was commissioned more than 40 years ago, in 1969). \nThe poor condition of these assets results in a higher risk of system outages, poor energy \nservices,8 higher maintenance costs, and increased transmission losses.9 A strong transmission \nsystem is an essential component of efficient, reliable, and flexible infrastructure that meets the \ngrowing demand for electricity. \n \n8.  The project supports ADB\u2019s current intervention in the power sector and contributes to \nthe improvement of energy efficiency. The project is an outcome of the least-cost power system \nexpansion plan and is included in the government investment plan for 2015\u20132019. This project \n                                                \n5   ADB. 2010.

Manila. \n8  The energy not served because of system outages in the region was estimated at 158.4 GWH in 2013, or 6.4% of \nannual demand.  \n9  Uzbekenergo estimates overall system losses at 20% (transmission losses of 5% and distribution losses of 15%).   \n ", "3 \nwill remove bottlenecks and ensure that adequate electricity generated by Takhiatash TPP is \nevacuated to meet increased demand and enable economically efficient operation of the power \nplant. The improved power supply will stimulate new economic activities, alleviate regional \ndisparities, and support inclusive and sustainable economic development. \n   \n9.  The project is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Uzbekistan, which \nincludes a focus on energy efficiency and the reliable supply of power.10 It is also consistent with \nADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 and ADB\u2019s Energy Policy.11 \n \n10.  ADB is actively involved in a dialogue with the government to promote energy sector \nreform and development, capacity building, and good governance. In 2012, the power sector \nregional master plan was prepared under the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \nprogram, which identifies investment priorities and a development plan. Knowledge solutions \nand  capacity  development  of  energy  enterprises  such  as  planning,  procurement,  asset \nmanagement, financial management, and project management, are ongoing with satisfactory \nprogress. This project will be the sixth ADB project loan to Uzbekistan\u2019s power sector, and will \ncomplement ongoing ADB interventions.12 \n   \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The project\u2019s impact will be adequate and reliable power supply in Uzbekistan by 2023. \nThe  outcome  will  be  an  expanded  and  modernized  high-voltage  transmission  grid  in \nKarakalpakstan and Khorezm regions.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  The project outputs consist of the following components: \n(i)  Strengthening  of  the  northwest  region  power  transmission  network. \nConstruction  of  220  kV  single-circuit  overhead  transmission  line  between \nTakhiatash TPP  and  Khorezm  substation   (197.4 km),  and  between  Khorezm \nsubstation and Ellikkala substation (166.1 km) totaling 364 km. \n(ii)  Expansion,  rehabilitation  and/or  construction  of  three  substations. \nComprising (a) rehabilitation and expansion of 220/110 kV open switchyards at \nTakhiatash  TPP,  (b)  rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  220/110  kV  Khorezm \nsubstation; and (c) construction of a 500/220 kV Ellikkala substation.  \n(iii)  Support for institutional development and capacity building. Comprising of (a) \nupgrading of Uzbekenergo transmission system planning and dispatch automation, \n(b) strengthening of the Uzbekenergo transmission assets management system, \n(c) external auditing of project accounts, and (d) strengthening of Uzbekenergo \noperational and maintenance capacity for transmission assets. \n \nD.

The government  has requested  a  loan  of $150  million from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  straight  line  repayment  method,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreements. Based on the repayment method, the average loan maturity is \n15.25 years and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per annum. The government \nhas provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility based on these terms and conditions and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere its own decision and not made in reliance on a communication from ADB. The loan \nproceeds  will  be  relent  from  the  borrower  to  Uzbekenergo  pursuant  to  a  subsidiary  loan \nagreement at the same interest rate as that applicable to the loan. Uzbekenergo will assume the \nforeign exchange risk which will be incorporated in the tariff. \n \n15.  The government will arrange counterpart financing as follows: (i) coverage of taxes and \nduties  amounting  to  $25  million;  and  (ii)  Uzbekenergo\u2019s  internal  resources  to  cover  the \nremaining balance of the project cost amounting to $80 million including for all civil works, \nancillary infrastructure, land acquisition and resettlement, recurrent costs, and interest during \nconstruction.

The project management unit (PMU), funded by Uzbekenergo\u2019s internal sources, will \nadminister  all  consulting  and  procurement  contracts,  and  prepare  project  plans,  bidding \ndocuments, bid evaluation reports, progress reports, applications for withdrawal of funds, and \nany other reports required by ADB. The PMU will be supported by a project management and \nsupervision consultant financed through the ADB loan. \n \n18.  The equipment and materials for the project will be financed by ADB (excluding taxes \nand duties) and procured through international competitive bidding, in accordance with ADB's \n                                                \n13  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6   \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  expedite  project \nimplementation, advance contracting will be used for project supervision and management \nconsultants. Construction activities will be entirely financed by Uzbekenergo and carried out by \ncontractors to be selected and engaged by Uzbekenergo under the applicable Uzbek laws and \nregulations  relating  to  procurement  and  contract  management.  Project  supervision  and \nmanagement will be contracted to a consulting firm, which will support Uzbekenergo in carrying \nout procurement, implementation, management, quality control, and project supervision and \nmonitoring. The project supervision consulting firm will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time), and advance \naction for recruitment of consulting firm is underway. The consultancy service for the external \nauditing firm will be selected using consultants\u2019 qualification selection method because (i) the \nauditing is a small assignment, (ii) the auditing is a highly specialized service and the number of \nqualified auditors is limited, and (iii) the assignment is a short-term and on an intermittent basis. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n19.  Technical design is aligned with international practices and complies with Uzbekistan\u2019s \ncurrently applicable standards and state technical design code. According to best international \npractice, galvanized tower structures will be used as this treatment significantly prolongs the \nuseful life of the structures; galvanized steel structures are especially desirable in areas with \nmajor industrial pollution, salt or elevated moisture. Along the entire length of the transmission, \noptic  24-fiber  ground  wire  will  be  installed.  The  solutions  are  technically  sound  and  cost-\neffective compared to the alternatives. Uzbekenergo has necessary technical capacity and \nexperienced staff to operate and maintain the transmission network with the support from \nexternal consultants. Criteria and methodology are similar to the international practice and are \nstrictly implemented under the established internal procedures and technical standards.  \n \n20.  The current analytical programs and tools for transmission system planning and analysis \nused by Uzbekenergo are obsolete and inefficient, and not formally supported by the original \ndesigners. Uzbekenergo also lacks computerized systems for managing work, maintenance, \nand assets. Substation and line maintenance has been organized in a fairly traditional and same \nmanner for decades. Information on transmission assets is kept in a variety of different formats \nand is in very poor condition. A modern transmission planning system (including software and \ntraining)  and  computerized  asset  management  system  (including  software,  database, \napplication servers, and training) will be established in Uzbekenergo. These systems represent \nmajor technological changes to improve the operational efficiency of the company.14   \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  The project is financially and economically viable. The financial internal rate of return is \n5.5%, which compares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital of 0.4%. The project \nwill generate financial revenues to Uzbekenergo from the additional sale of electricity, reduced \ntechnical losses, and reduced maintenance costs.  \n  \n22.  The economic benefits consist of a reduction in energy not served in the region, a \nreduction in transmission losses, and a reduction in maintenance costs. In addition, some non-\n                                                \n14 Details of the transmission system planning system and computerized asset management systems are in the \nTechnical Due Diligence Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nincremental benefits arise from reduced reliance on back-up generation sources. The sensitivity \nanalysis  suggests  sufficient  robustness  of  the  project  under  all  tested  assumptions.  The \neconomic internal rate of return is 18.1%, which is greater than the economic opportunity cost of \ncapital of 12%.  \n \n23.  Uzbekenergo has operated profitably since 2008.15 The gross profit margin has been \nabove 10% throughout the period, but decreased from 35.1% in 2007 to 16.9% in 2013, largely \ndue  to  the  increasing  cost  of  maintaining  aging  facilities.  However,  low  fuel  costs16 and \nsemiannual  tariff  adjustments  to  reflect  inflation  have  contributed  to  the  profitability  of \nUzbekenergo. \n \n24.  Financial projections for 2014\u20132025 indicate that the financial base remains stable if \ntariff  adjustments  continue  to  be  synchronized  with  inflation  and  gas  prices.  The  ongoing \ncapacity  development  program  under  previous  projects  and  this  project  will  support \nUzbekenergo to sustain its profitability. \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  Sector governance. The power sector is under the direct supervision of the Cabinet of \nMinisters, which prepares the energy policy and long-term investment plan in coordination with \nother relevant ministries and government agencies. The power sector investment plan for 2015\u2013\n2019 was adopted on 4 March 2015. The Ministry of Finance sets the tariff; the government \nadjusted the tariff semi-annually to reflect the cost of services. Licenses are issued by the State \nInspection of Control in Power Industry under the Cabinet of Ministers. Capacity development of \nUzbekenergo including strengthening safeguards assessment capacity, bringing in modern and \ntransparent performance assessment, and upgrading the management information system is \nunderway with ADB support under ongoing projects.17 \n \n26.  Financial management. Uzbekenergo\u2019s financial management risk is considered high, \nand  it  needs  to  strengthen  its  financial  management  capacity.  Uzbekenergo\u2019s  accounting \npolicies, procedures, and financial reporting have followed the National Accounting Standards of \nUzbekistan  and  National  Standards  on  Auditing.  However,  Uzbekenergo  has  not  fully \nconsolidated the financial statements that cover revenues and costs of the core electricity \noperations. To enhance its financial management, since FY2011 Uzbekenergo has adopted \nexternal audit of its financial statements based on International Standards on Auditing issued by \nthe  International  Assurance  Auditing  Standards  Board.  The  external  audit  found  areas  for \nfurther improvements (e.g., in the classification methods and impairment provisions on account \nreceivables, the scope of account consolidation and the accounting system).  \n \n27.  Uzbekenergo has started converting to International Financial Reporting Standards in \nFY2012 and plans to complete full conversion to cover all subsidiaries for FY2015. Capacity \ndevelopment activities planned under other ADB loan and World Bank projects will address the \ntraining  of  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  specialists  as  well  as  the \nstrengthening of Uzbekenergo\u2019s information systems with the objective of improving its financial \nmanagement capability.  \n                                                \n15 This is based on Uzbekenergo\u2019s unconsolidated financial statements; consolidation of the financial account is \nexpected to be completed for FY 2015. \n16  Uzbekenergo\u2019s gas price is currently 30% below the export price.  \n17  ADB. 2010.

The  procurement  capacity  was  assessed  as  high  risk. \nUzbekenergo has experience with projects financed by bilateral and multilateral financiers, \nincluding ADB. Despite improvements, the PMU capacity is still weak. An international firm will \nbe  recruited  as  project  management  and  supervision  consultant  to  assist  with the  bidding \nprocess  and  contract  management.18 ADB  (from  both  headquarters  and  the  Uzbekistan \nResident  Mission)  will  provide  the  executing  agency  with  specific  procurement  advice  and \nrecommendations during project implementation.  \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and Uzbekenergo. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 13). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n30.  The increased efficiency and reliability of power supply resulting from the project will \nhave a positive impact on economic growth, poverty reduction, and social services such as \nschools,  health  care  facilities,  and  shops,  which  will  ultimately  improve  well-being  and \ncommunity  welfare.  The  improved  energy  supply  will  have  a  positive  effect  on  business \ndevelopment and support new job creation. No gender issues are envisaged during project \nconstruction  and  implementation\u2014electricity  delivery  will  equally  benefit  households  and \nbusinesses run by women and men. \n   \nE.  Safeguards \n31.  Environmental assessment. The project is classified as category B for the environment \nunder ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). An initial environmental examination report, \nincluding an environmental management plan (EMP), has been developed and was disclosed \non the ADB website on 19 June 2015. The environmental impacts of the project are expected to \nbe insignificant, site-specific, and manageable through mitigation and monitoring measures. \nMost of the environmental impacts of the project take place during the construction of the \ntransmission lines, and expansion and rehabilitation of related substations and switchyards. \nPotential environmental impacts during the construction activities include limited impacts on (i) \nland, hydrology, and soil erosion at river crossing; (ii) forest ecology due to tree cutting in a \nforested area; (iii) air quality; (iv) noise near the Low Amu Darya Biosphere Reserve; (v) waste \ngeneration and disposal; (vi) transformer oil and battery management; (vii) traffic; and (viii) \nhealth and safety of workers and local communities. Impacts during the operational phase are \nrelated to the electromagnetic field and the health and safety of operators at substations. The \nEMP specifies adequate mitigation measures and monitoring plans to cover these impacts. \nThese  measures  include  detailed  planning  of  the  structures  and  routes,  timing  of  the \nconstruction  works,  careful  planning  and  execution  of  works,  selection  of    low-emission \nequipment, controlled tree cutting, health and safety training of the personnel and informing \nlocal residents, and application of waste and oil management practices in compliance with \nnational  regulations.  The  project  supervision  and  management  consultants  will  assist \nUzbekenergo  in  supervising  the  implementation  of  the  EMP  and  further  enhancing  the \nenvironmental  management  capacity  of  Uzbekenergo,  which  has  a  Department  for \nEnvironmental and Social Safeguards. \n \n32.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. A land acquisition and resettlement plan \n                                                \n18  The consulting firm will be engaged prior to the procurement of goods and works. \n ", "9 \n(LARP) was prepared and disclosed on the ADB website on 4 May 2015. Nine consultations \nwere carried out with affected households during project preparation, and Uzberkenergo will \ncontinue to engage the affected households until the LARP is finalized and implemented. The \nLARP includes an entitlements matrix summarizing all compensation and assistance provided \nunder the project, a resettlement budget and financing plan, and an implementation schedule for \nland acquisition and resettlement activities. The project will require permanent and temporary \nland acquisition for construction of transmission lines and substations. The impact on affected \nhouseholds will not be significant, because no household has more than 8.4% of their land \naffected.  Compensation  and  other  assistances  will  be  scheduled  and  paid  to  affected \nhouseholds prior to commencement of civil works. The project supervision and management \nconsultants will assist Uzbekenergo in supervising the implementation of land acquisition and \nresettlement activities.   \n \n33.  Indigenous peoples. The project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples. \nThe project is not expected to affect indigenous peoples as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.  The  overall  assessment  of  the  project  is  medium  risk  for  procurement,  project \nmanagement, and financial management. The integrated benefits from and impacts of the \nproject are expected to outweigh the cost. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized \nin Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.19  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nProcurement    \nDelayed procurement and  Advance contracting is adopted to recruit the project implementation \nimplementation of civil works  consultant to assist procurement. \nand goods contracts due to  An international consulting firm will be recruited to assist Uzbekenergo in \nweak procurement capacity of  project implementation and strengthen procurement transparency. \nUzbekenergo PMU staff and   \nprolonged contract approval  Uzbekenergo will recruit experienced procurement specialists for the \nand registration by the  PMU before the bidding process. \ngovernment.      \nADB\u2019s staff consultant and procurement specialist will provide \nprocurement and contract management training and advice throughout \nproject implementation. \n \nLessons from previous projects will be analyzed and will be incorporated \nwith the PMU and project implementation consultant.  \nThe institutions responsible for contract registration assessment will be \ninvolved in procurement and consultant recruitment to avoid delays in \nthe contract registration required for contract effectiveness. \nProject implementation   \nLimited project management  Experienced project supervision consultants will be engaged to assist \ncapacity of Uzbekenergo  the PMU on project implementation and management.   \nPMU staff and lacking   \nexperience with contract   \nmanagement   \n   \n                                                \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nAssociated generation project  The government has established an Interagency Council at the Cabinet \nthat has direct effects on the  of Ministers to oversee and coordinate all investment projects.
