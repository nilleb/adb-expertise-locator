I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for the Power Distribution Improvement Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will rehabilitate the distribution network in five townships in Yangon region \n(Hlaingthaya, Insein, Kamayut, Mayangone, and Mingaladon), four districts in Mandalay region \n(Kyaukse, Meikhtila, Myingyen, and Yameethin), five districts in Sagaing region (Kalay, Katha, \nMonywa,  Sagaing,  and  Shwebo),  and  two  townships  in  Magway  region  (Aungland  and \nMagway).  These  areas  were  selected  in  consultation  with  the  Ministry  of  Electric  Power \n(MOEP), Yangon City Electricity Supply Board (YESB), and Electricity Supply Enterprise (ESE). \nThe project will help reduce system losses and subsequently increase the electricity supply to \nurban and rural consumers to support inclusive and sustainable economic development.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Strengthening power supply capacity is critical for reducing poverty and enhancing \nthe medium- and long-term development prospects of Myanmar. Persistent power brownouts \nduring the dry season adversely impact economic and social activities. Electrification is urgently \nrequired; without it large areas of the country will be severely hampered in their efforts to \nadvance economically. Basic and socioeconomic needs also depend on electrification, without \nwhich,  health,  education,  and  other  essential  services  will  inevitably  suffer.  About  68%  of \navailable electricity is used in Yangon (46%) and Mandalay (22%) regions (the country has 14 \nregions and states). \n \n4.  Low national electricity coverage. Although electricity consumption in Myanmar has \ndoubled during the last 10 years, total electricity consumption in 2012 was 8,434 gigawatt-\nhours. With a population of about 60 million, Myanmar\u2019s per capita electricity consumption was \nonly 140 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year\u2014the lowest among the 10 Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations member countries. The low consumption is due to lack of industrial development, \nlack of investment, and poor electrification ratio. The country\u2019s average electrification ratio \nincreased from about 16% in 2006 to 28% in 2012.2 Yangon City has the highest ratio (72%), \nfollowed by Nay Pyi Taw (65%), Kayah (42%), and Mandalay (35%). The remaining rural areas \nhave electrification ratios averaging about 21%.3  \n \n5.  High  distribution  losses.  As  of  December  2012,  total  system  installed  power \ngeneration capacity was 3,495 megawatts (MW), comprising 2,660 MW (76.1%) hydropower, \n715 MW (20.5%) gas-fired, and 120 MW (3.4%) coal-fired.4 Due to scheduled maintenance and \nvarious  limitations  of  operations  at  several  power  plants,  the  actual  firm  capacity  as  of \nDecember 2012 was 1,957 MW. Although the installed capacity exceeds the 2012 peak load of \n1,796 MW, during the dry season hydropower plants cannot generate to full capacity due to lack \nof water. Hence, the country\u2019s power grid is experiencing of up to 400 MW\u2013500 MW of load \nshedding during the dry season. The transmission lines and transformers have limited capacity. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The average electrification ratio is defined as the number of electrified households connected to the grid over the \ntotal number of households. \n3  The areas with the lowest electrification ratio are Yakhine (6%), Tannintharyi (9%), and Ayeyarwaddy (10%). \n4  The country has 32 mini-hydropower plants with a combined generating capacity of 33.3 MW for the off-grid power \nsupply. ", "2 \n \nThe network also has high transmission and distribution losses. Technical and nontechnical \nlosses of the distribution system were as high as 23% in 2003 and decreasing to 18.2% in \n2012.5 Therefore, improvement of the distribution network is urgently needed. \n \n6.  Sector governance and institutions. The regulatory framework for power includes the \nElectricity Act of 1948 (as amended in 1967), the Myanmar Electricity Law (1984), and the \nElectricity  Rules  (1985).6 MOEP  is  responsible  for  the  power  subsector.7 Within  MOEP, \nMyanmar Electric Power Enterprise is responsible for the development and implementation of \nthe transmission network, covering the voltages of 66 kilovolts (kV), 132 kV, and 230 kV. Two \ndistribution enterprises operate the distribution systems in the country\u2014YESB and ESE.8 YESB \nis responsible for the supply of electricity to consumers in Yangon City 9 and ESE for the rest of \nthe country comprising 13 states and regions, including off-grid generation and distribution.10 \nOperation and maintenance capacity of the two distribution enterprises is adequate, but due to \nlimited availability of parts and manual operation of distribution systems, performance of the \ndistribution systems is poor. \n \n7.  Low electricity tariffs. From January 2012, the electricity tariffs was MK35/kWh for \ngeneral  purpose  (households),  street  lighting,  and  government  offices;  and  MK75/kWh  for \ndomestic power, and small and bulk power.11 The government recently announced the increase \nin electricity tariff to become effective from 1 April 2014: MK35/kWh for households (until 100 \nkWh)  and  MK50/kWh  (for  101  kWh  and  above);  MK100/kWh  for  industry,  enterprise,  and \nlumpsum (until 5,000 kWh) and MK150/kWh for industry, enterprise, and lumpsum (for 5,001 \nkWh and above); MK50/kWh for government offices; and MK100/kWh for industrial use of \ngovernment departments. Off-grid consumer tariffs vary depending on the cost of generation by \ndiesel  or  other  means  (e.g.,  solar,  mini-hydropower)  and  may  range  from  MK100/kWh  to \nMK300/kWh. \n \n8.  Priority  areas  for  future  investments.  Significant  investments  are  needed  to  \n(i) improve and upgrade the distribution systems, especially in Yangon and Mandalay regions; \n(ii) address the current shortage of power generation through rehabilitation and new additions; \n(iii) reinforce the transmission grid and associated substations; and (iv) extend transmission and \ndistribution networks to connect more consumers, particularly in rural areas. A consolidated \ndevelopment and investment plan for the power subsector is not available. The preparation of a \nlong-term  power  master  plan  commenced  in  July  2013,  with  assistance  from  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA); it is expected to be completed by June 2014. \n \n9.  ADB assistance. Up to 1987, ADB provided five loans totaling $31.6 million and three \ntechnical assistance (TA) projects totaling $1.27 million for the power subsector. Since 1987, no \n                                                \n5  Estimated at technical loss of 60% and nontechnical loss of 40%. \n6  The recently drafted revised electricity law is now undergoing interministerial consultations for promulgation. \n7  On 5 September 2012, the Ministry of Electric Power No. 1 (MOEP1) and the Ministry of Electric Power No. 2 \n(MOEP2) were merged into the single Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP). MOEP1 was responsible for developing, \nimplementing, operating, and maintaining all large hydropower and coal power thermal plants. MOEP2 was \nresponsible for (i) developing, operating,  and maintaining the transmission network and distribution system;  \n(ii) operating and maintaining gas-fired thermal plants; and (iii) planning, implementing, and operating mini-\nhydropower plants. \n8  Distribution systems comprise lower voltages\u201433 kV, 11 kV, 6.6 kV, and 0.4 kV. \n9  Formed on 1 April 2006 by The Board of Yangon City Electric Power Supply Law (Law No.6/2005). \n10 Formed on 15 May 2006 under the Ministry of Electric Power No. 2, it has been functioning as one of the \ndepartments of MOEP No. 2. \n11 The tariff for foreigners is $0.12/kWh. Originally, MOEP proposed the electricity tariffs of MK50/kWh for general \npurpose and MK100/kWh for domestic power in January 2012 for Cabinet approval.  \n ", "3 \n \nloans  and  TA  were  provided.  Until  reengagement  in  March  2012,  ADB  obtained  limited \ninformation  on  the  power  subsector  through  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Economic \nCooperation  Program.  The  Myanmar  Energy  Sector  Initial  Assessment  (October  2012) \nrecognizes that ADB should resume providing assistance to the power subsector to enhance \nreliability by rehabilitating and expanding transmission and distribution networks.12 The New \nEnergy Architecture: Myanmar defines the enabling environment for achieving the long-term \nobjectives  of  economic  growth  and  development,  energy  access  and  security,  and \nenvironmental sustainability.13 Since reengagement, ADB has provided a total of about $4.7 \nmillion  of  TA  to  enhance  capacity,  strengthen  planning,  enhance  the  legal  and  regulatory \nframework, and prepare power projects. To enhance MOEP capacity, ADB assistance includes \n(i)  a  power  advisor  to  MOEP; 14 (ii)  international  and  national  experts  for  preparing  a \ntransmission  and  distribution  grid  code,  and  electric  standards  and  specifications;15 (iii) \npreparation of a financial management assessment of four enterprises within MOEP;16 and (iv) \nformulation of proper safeguard requirements and procedures.17 Also, to strengthen the legal \nframework, ADB provided assistance for drafting the revised electricity law and subsequent \nelectricity regulation, and introducing the regulatory authority to enhance transparency and \nattract private sector participation.18 In addition, project preparatory TA conducted a feasibility \nstudy for transmission expansion.19 The project is included in the country operations business \nplan for Myanmar and is in line with ADB\u2019s interim country partnership strategy for Myanmar for \n2012\u20132014, which emphasizes the need to support power infrastructure. 20  \n \n10.  Development coordination. ADB, JICA, and the World Bank have closely coordinated \ntheir assistance for the power subsector with MOEP following reengagement.21 They have \nagreed that (i) ADB will undertake rehabilitation of distribution networks in Yangon, Mandalay, \nSagaing, and Magway regions; (ii) the World Bank will carry out rehabilitation of a 108 MW gas-\nfired plant at Thaton;22 and (iii) JICA will undertake rehabilitation of gas-fired plants within \nYangon, a hydropower plant, and distribution networks in other townships in Yangon.23   \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact will be reduced power distribution loss and improved energy efficiency. The \noutcome will be improved infrastructure to provide reliable and sustainable electricity to the \nselected townships and districts.   \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2012.

JICA and ADB are the \nlead development partners; other development partners include the Netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom, and \nthe World Bank. \n ", "4 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  The project outputs will be  (i) rehabilitated distribution network in five townships in \nYangon  region,  (ii)  rehabilitated  distribution  network  in  four  districts  in  Mandalay  region,  \n(iii) rehabilitated distribution network in five districts in Sagaing region, and (iv) rehabilitated \ndistribution network in two townships in Magway region. For each project region, support to \ncapacity building will be provided to enhance staff capability in MOEP, YESB, and ESE on \nrehabilitation  and  operation  of  power  distribution  system,  procurement,  and  financial \nmanagement  during  implementation. The rehabilitation  works  include (i)  upgrading  existing \n66/11 kV and 33/11 kV substations, (ii) replacing existing 33 kV and 11 kV distribution lines, (iii) \nreplacing existing 11/0.4 kV transformers, (iv) replacing existing bare low voltage distribution \nlines with more efficient aerial-bundled conductor distribution lines, and (v) replacing existing \nrevenue meters with digital revenue meters.  \n \nD.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  MOEP  will  be  the  executing  agency.  It  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project \nimplementation and management, and a project management unit will be established in each of \nYESB and ESE. Three project implementation units will be established in three project areas \nwithin ESE. To ensure (i) implementation of the YESB and ESE material recovery plans for \nsubstituted  equipment  and  materials,  and  (ii)  monitoring  of  initial  project  performance  and \noutcome, a monitoring period of 1.5 years is provided. This will help collect detailed information \nof  initial  project  operations  to support  the  preparation  of  subsequent  ADB  interventions  in \ndistribution  systems.  The  implementation  arrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual.24 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2014\u2013December 2016 (36 months) \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2018 (loan account closing date)  \nManagement \n(i)   Executing agency  MOEP \n(ii)  Key implementing agencies  MOEP, YESB, and ESE \n(iii) Project management unit and  A PMU will be established in each of YESB and ESE, and will be \nproject implementation units  responsible for day-to-day implementation and preparation of \nprogress reports, ensure that financial and reporting \nrequirements are met, and ensure ADB procurement procedures \nare followed with full coordination with project implementation \nunits for the three project areas in ESE: Mandalay, Sagaing, and \nMagway regions.

Procurement \n \n16.  ADB  has  approved  advance  contracting  for  procurement  of  goods  and  consulting \nservices. This will cover bidding and bid evaluation up to the stage of ADB approval of MOEP\u2019s \nrecommendation for award of contract before the effective date of the draft loan agreement. The \npreparation of the bid documents has been undertaken under TA for Preparing the Power \nTransmission and Distribution Improvement Project (footnote 19). The government, MOEP, \nYESB, and ESE have been advised that approval of advance contracting for the procurement of \ngoods and recruitment of the project implementation consultants does not commit ADB to \nfinance the proposed loan and that ADB financing will depend on the government\u2019s compliance \nwith  all  aspects  of  ADB  procedural  requirements,  including  compliance  with  the  relevant \nprovisions of the draft loan agreement and ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time).  \n \n17.  The project will procure six procurement packages with international competitive bidding \nusing the single-stage, one-envelope method under the ADB loan. The government will finance \nprocurement of concrete poles using counterpart funds and follow its procurement guidelines. \nYESB and ESE will undertake rehabilitation, replacement, and installation works, including \ncommissioning. Details are provided in the project administration manual (footnote 24). \n \n2.  Implementation Consultants \n \n18.  A total of 214 person-months of consulting services (64 person-months of international \nand  150  person-months  of  national)  are  required  to  facilitate  project  management  and \nimplementation, and strengthen MOEP\u2019s institutional and operating capacity. A consulting firm \nwill be engaged using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a 90:10 ratio and full \ntechnical proposal in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). The detailed terms of reference for the consultants are in the \nproject administration manual (footnote 24). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n19.  One  benefit  of  the  project  will  be  the  introduction  of  international  practices  and \ntechniques for modern power distribution systems  to Myanmar. This will  include (i) aerial-\nbundled conductors, fittings, and insulation-piercing connectors for low-voltage distribution to \nreplace the existing bare open wire system; (ii) use of connectors to replace all existing hook \nand twisted-wire connections, which incur high losses and result in flickering voltages in homes; \n(iii) use of molded-case circuit breakers to protect low voltage circuits from short-circuit faults \nand overloading of distribution transformers to replace the existing horn-gap practice; (iv) use of \ndropout fuses on the primary 33/0.4 kV and 11/0.4 kV distribution transformers to replace the \nexisting fuse wire practice; and (v) use of digital revenue meters mounted on poles to replace \nexisting electromechanical types, with remote hand-held reading to eliminate reading errors. \nThe introduction of n-1 criteria25 into substation design will ensure an improvement in reliability \nand quality of electricity delivered to customers.26  \n \n                                                \n25 This is the ability of the distribution system to lose a linkage without causing an overload failure elsewhere.  \n26  The installation of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition for the distribution system was reviewed. It is to be \nconsidered after completion of construction of central dispatch centers for the transmission system. \n ", "7 \n \n20.  Domestic  manufacturing  capacity  to  provide  concrete  poles  was  assessed  and \ndiscussed extensively with MOEP, YESB, and ESE. The designs are all the same and conform \nto MOEP standard, with pre-stressing, reinforcing cages, and concrete mix specified. Concrete \npoles will be procured under local bidding procedures in three regional lots to be financed by the \ngovernment. The project implementation consultants will ensure the quality of concrete poles \nmeets the project requirements. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  Economic analysis. The economic viability of the project was examined by comparing \nthe societal costs and benefits of the with-project scenario with the without-project scenario.27 \nCosts  to  society  include  the  costs  of  (i)  equipment  and  installation,  (ii)  engineering  and \nconsulting services, and (iii) safeguard measures. The project costs take into account physical \ncontingencies,  but  exclude  price  contingences,  taxes,  and  duties.  The  project  will  reduce \ndistribution losses by 4 percentage points, from 18.2% to 14.2%. For the base year 2013 when \nelectricity sales in the project areas are 1,930 gigawatt-hours, this loss reduction is equivalent to \n109 gigawatt-hours. This is the economic benefit in physical terms compared with the without-\nproject scenario. As electricity consumption increases, electricity savings from the project will \ngrow (up to 189 gigawatt-hours in 2017). Without the project, YESB and ESE would lose these \nelectricity savings.  \n \n22.  In the without-project case, most large industrial and business enterprises have to use \ndiesel  generators  as  backup  electricity  sources.  Small  business  enterprises  and  wealthy \nhouseholds in cities could also purchase small portable generators. For poor households in \ncities and for households and small businesses in rural areas, power shortages usually mean \nthey are left without electricity. Thus, the economic benefit of the project is a sum of the benefits \nresulting from not having to run backup diesel generators and/or not having to suffer from power \nbrownouts. Applying economic values specifically prepared for the project areas, the analysis \ndemonstrates that the project is economically robust under various sensitivity conditions. The \nproject yields an economic internal rate of return of 35% and an economic net present value of \n$216.8 million at a discount rate of 12%. Given that power supply in Myanmar currently does not \nmeet the demand and the growth rate of consumption is high, the value of investing in loss \nreduction is quite high. \n \n23.  Financial  analysis. The project\u2019s financial viability was determined by performing a \ncash  flow  analysis  of  projected  future  revenues  and  cost  streams  from  the  project.28 The \nweighted average cost of capital, which measures the project\u2019s cost of funds, is determined \nbased on the source and cost of financing. The project is considered financially viable since the \nfinancial internal rate of return of 8.8% exceeds the weighted average cost of capital of 1.4%, \nand the financial net present value  is $86.7 million. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to \nestablish the robustness of the project\u2019s financial internal rate of return to changes in various \nparameters: (i) increase in capital costs, (ii) decrease in revenues, and (iii) delay in project \nimplementation. The financial internal rate of return remains greater than the weighted average \ncost of capital and the financial net present value remains positive for all scenarios. The project \nremains viable under various combinations of the scenarios indicating it is financially robust. \n  \n                                                \n27 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \nC.  Governance \n24.  A  financial  management  assessment  of  Myanmar\u2019s  power  system  agencies  was \nconducted under the Financial Management Assessment of Energy Sector TA project (footnote \n16). YESB and ESE are preparing financial statements based on accrual basis, and according \nto the Office of the Auditor General, both institutions follow the International Public Sector \nAccounting Standards. However, they are using accounting manuals issued in the 1960s, which \nare in urgent need of updating to bring them in line with international best practices.29 While \nYESB and ESE staff are qualified, they lack adequate knowledge of ADB financial management \npolicies and procedures. To enhance awareness, ADB staff will conduct training sessions in \nearly 2014. The project team has had no access to YESB and ESE financial statements; they \nbased the financial analysis and assessment on available information. MOEP and the Office of \nthe Auditor General have promised to provide ADB with the audited financial statements of \nYESB and ESE during project implementation. \n \n25.  The government is committed to promoting good governance and addressing corruption. \nThe Anticorruption Commission was formed in January 2013, and the Anticorruption Law was \npromulgated  in  July  2013.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and MOEP. To ensure that procured goods are \nused only for the project, project implementation unit staff will verify the delivery of all goods, \nand maintain an asset register for each project area. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 24). ADB \nwill organize special training for MOEP, YESB, and ESE staff covering all aspects of project \nimplementation and ADB procedures, including procedures for implementation, procurement, \nuse of consultants, disbursement, reporting, monitoring, and prevention of fraud and corruption. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n26.  The project is to improve the supply of reliable electricity from indigenous sources in the \ncountry. The population will benefit from improved access to electricity to support their economic \nactivities.  \n \n27.  Lack of transmission and distribution infrastructure has been the largest constraint in \naccessing  electricity.  About  480,000  households  from  Yangon  region  (Hlaingthaya,  Insein, \nKamayut,  Mayangone,  and  Mingaladon  townships),  Mandalay  region  (Kyaukse,  Meikhtila, \nMyingyen,  and  Yameethin  districts),  Sagaing region  (Kalay,  Katha,  Monywa,  Sagaing,  and \nShwebo  districts),  and  Magway  region  (Aunglan  and  Magway  townships)  will  benefit  from \nreliable supply and improved access to electricity to support their daily activities, including \neconomic activities. By increasing the supply of electricity through loss reduction, the project will \nprovide increased opportunities for large industries and small and medium-sized enterprises to \nexpand their services, improve living conditions for individuals and households, and improve \nconditions for community facilities (e.g., clinics, schools) in the area and thus contribute to \neconomic development and poverty reduction.30  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  The project is in category B for environment, C for involuntary resettlement, and C for \nindigenous people in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The project \n                                                \n29 Assistance for computerizing the billing system has been reviewed and is recommended to be included in \nsubsequent ADB interventions with detailed assessment. \n30 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n \ninvolves  rehabilitation  and  replacement  of  the  distribution  system  in  several  townships \nthroughout  Myanmar  (Yangon,  Mandalay,  Magway,  and  Sagaing  regions).  This  has  the \npotential to generate adverse impacts for the environment and the community in the project \nareas, such as during replacement of the wooden poles with concrete poles, and installation of \naerial-bundled conductors along the existing routes. However, the project will not result in any \nphysical  or  economic  displacement,  and  will  not  affect  any  indigenous  people.  An  initial \nenvironmental  examination  has  been  prepared  with  an  environmental  management  plan, \nincluding budget and responsibilities for mitigating measures and monitoring during installation \nand operation phases and a clear structure for a grievance redress mechanism. The project will \nprovide  occupational  and  community  health  and  safety  training  and  capacity  building  on \nimplementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan  for  MOEP,  YESB,  and  ESE  staff. \nAdequate public consultation with concerned stakeholders is included on environment-related \nimpacts and mitigating measures. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n29.  As this is the first ADB power project since reengagement with Myanmar, ADB has no \nexperience working with MOEP, YESB, and ESE. The aggregate benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. The major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in \nTable 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.31  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nWeak public financial  A financial management assessment on Myanmar\u2019s power sector \nmanagement  agencies was conducted and necessary capacity building for \nfinancial management will be provided in early 2014. To enhance \naccountability, the project implementation consultants will help the \nexecuting agency prepare financial statements in accordance with \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines and procedures. \nDelay in the effectiveness of  Project readiness has been ensured in compliance with government \nloan agreement as the first  requirements and criteria, and a sample of existing loan agreements \nproject loan   was provided in advance for familiarization. \nImplementation delays due to  Project preparatory technical assistance for the Power Transmission \nlack of familiarity with ADB  and Distribution Improvement Project has undertaken the advance \nguidelines and procedures on  contracting for procurement and recruitment of project \nprocurement, recruitment of  implementation consultants. \nconsultants, and disbursements  Necessary capacity building for the procurement, engagement of \nconsultants, disbursements, and financial management will be \nprovided. The project implementation consultants will help MOEP \nprepare reports following ADB guidelines and procedures. \nThe number of procurement packages was decreased to six for ICB \n(financed by ADB, with different delivery schedules for four project \nareas) to mitigate risks of delay in procurement and to improve \ntransparency. \nAll disbursements will be made to suppliers and consultants through \ndirect payment by ADB with no imprest account to eliminate \nexposure to weak banking systems in Myanmar. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICB = international competitive bidding, MOEP = Ministry of Electric Power. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n                                                \n31 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n \nIV.
