The program is included in ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan, 2017\u20132019.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe development problem. The Philippines enjoyed strong economic growth between \n2010  and  2016,  averaging  6.3%  per  annum.  This  translated  into  solid  job  creation  with  wage \nemployment  expanding  by  an  average  of  3.7%  per  annum  over  this  period  and  the  overall \nunemployment rate falling to a historically low 4.7% by October 2016. While impressive, these \ngains  have  not  been  evenly  distributed  throughout  the  population.  Overall  poverty  rates  have \ndeclined only marginally to 21.6% in 2015 from 26.3% in 2009 and income inequality persists. 4  \nThe  Philippines  has  the  highest  household  income  inequality  among  all  the  Southeast  Asian \neconomies. The Gini index, which measures a country\u2019s household income inequality, is high at \n0.46 and is explained in part by unequal access to wage employment.5  \n \n4. \nThe  Philippines  has  a  young  population  with  an  average  age  of  25  years.  Therefore, \ncreating  wage  jobs  for  youth  is  vital  to reducing  poverty  and  income  inequality.  The  signs  are \nencouraging.  Reflecting  new  investments  in  services,  skill  shortages  have  arisen  in  the  fast-\ngrowing  business  process  outsourcing  industry,  financial  and  business  services,  and,  most \nrecently, in higher value-added manufacturing.6 \n \n5. \nYet, the Philippines has a youth employment problem. Based on findings from an ADB \nsurvey  of  500  households  in  Metro  Manila  and Cebu  City,  only  20%  of high  school  graduates \nfound a job within the first year of leaving school and only 60% of high school graduates were in \nemployment 8 years after leaving school.7 In contrast, 75% of college graduates found a job within \nthe first year of leaving school. As a result of this slow school-to-work transition, one in four young \npersons (25%) was not in employment, education, or training (NEET) in 2013, a rate in Southeast \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Youth is defined in the Philippine law as ages 15\u201330.  \n3  ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: Philippines, 2017\u20132019. Manila. \n4  Government of the Philippines, National Statistics Office. 2014. Annual Poverty Indicator Survey. Manila. \n5  According to the 2013 Philippines labor force survey, only 37% of total wage workers reside in households in the \n\nbottom half of the income distribution.  \n\n6  PhilJobNet, a Department of Labor and Employment job vacancy database. http://philjobnet.gov.ph (7 March 2017). \n7  Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n\n2). \n\n\fAsia  second  only  to  Indonesia\u2019s.8 This  rate  is  higher  for  young  women  (one  in  three)  than  for \nyoung men (one in five), because young women are more likely to withdraw from the labor market \nentirely (Figure 1a). Young women with low education attainment are most at risk of becoming \nNEET (one in two women), in part due to earlier childbearing and child-rearing than women with \ncollege education (Figure 1b). The rate of NEET is also highest among youth from low-income \nfamilies, as they tend to be less educated, do not have quality social contacts, and do not have \nthe life skills required to find long-term wage employment. This mismatch is occurring because \nthe participation rates of the poor in education are low, labor market activation programs are weak \nand under-resourced, and skills training programs are underfunded and not targeted. In addition, \nmen and women with low educational attainment and early spells in NEET are likely to have low \nlifetime earnings. ADB study shows that the rates of return on schooling have declined for wage \nworkers  from  low-income  households  and  increased  for  wage  workers  from  high  income \nhouseholds perpetuating income inequality (footnote 7). \n\n \nFigure 1: Not in Employment, Education, or Training\u2014 \nRates by Gender, Education Level, and Age \n\n(% of total population group) \n\n b.

The government has identified a number of constraints to facilitating \n7. \nthe  youth  school-to-work \nfacilitation;  \n(ii) weaknesses in post-high school training systems; and (iii) insufficient labor policies to promote \ndecent employment (paras. 8\u201310). \n \n8. \nInadequate  employment facilitation  services. The  public  employment  service offices \n(PESOs) are critically important for ensuring the effective implementation of active labor market \nprograms in LGUs and for achieving job placement targets. Five main impediments affect effective \nemployment facilitation in the Philippines. First, while the Philippines has established a network \nof PESOs through legislation enacted in 1999, the institutionalization of PESOs at the LGU level \nremains voluntary, underfunded, and under-resourced. Less than 300 out of 1,500 PESOs in 2014 \n\ninadequate  employment \n\ntransition, \n\nincluding: \n\n(i) \n\n                                                \n8  The most recent aggregated data from the Labor Force Survey for 2016 shows a decline in overall NEET rate to \n\n22% of the youth population.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fhave been institutionalized at the LGU level with permanent staff and budget, and this impedes \nthe delivery of employment facilitation to youth requiring these services. Moreover, youth in rural \nareas  do  not  have  access  to  basic  employment  services.  Second,  international  best  practice \nshows that effective youth employment programs are employer demand-driven and provide an \nintegrated set of services to youth.9 In the Philippines, current labor market programs do not offer \na full cycle of employment facilitation services targeted at youth, and especially young women, \nsuch as career guidance, life skills training, technical training, and internships or placements with \nemployers.  The  government  does  have  youth  employment  programs,  which  mainly  focus  on \nscholarships  and  training.  However,  these  programs  have  design  weaknesses  that  limit  the \npotential for further scaling up nationally.10 For example, the government\u2019s Special Program for \nthe  Employment  of  Students (SPES)  requires  LGUs to contribute  25%\u201360%  of the  cost  of the \nprogram,  irrespective  of  their  fiscal  capacity.11 Third,  employment  programs  are  not  effectively \ntargeting young women with high school or lower education despite this group being most at risk \nof gaining NEET status. For example, there are no quotas set for women beneficiaries in SPES \nand  the  Government  Internship  Program  (GIP)  contributing  to  underrepresentation  of  young \nwomen  in  these  programs  (footnote  11).  Fourth,  several  line  departments  and  agencies \nimplement labor market activation programs in an uncoordinated manner, therefore, limiting the \npotential  for  synergies  in  a  cost-effective  way.  Recent  international  good  practice  is  to \namalgamate  similar  programs  under  the  relevant  line  department.  Fifth,  the  labor  market \ninformation  system  (LMIS)  needs  upgrading  to  capture  a  larger  pool  of  vacancies,  skills,  and \nbetter outreach to youth nationally and in local communities. \n \n9. \nWeakness in post-high school training systems. A deficient apprenticeship program \nand insufficient funding for workplace skills have resulted in underinvestment in skills training of \nworkers and jobseekers. For example, a 2015 ADB survey found that 80% of employers in tourism \ndo not have a training policy for their employees.12 While the Philippines has established a good \ninstitutional setup for technical and vocational education and training (TVET), the development of \nan  integrated  Philippine  Qualifications  Framework  (PQF)  is  still  in  its  early  stages  of \nimplementation with basic education under the Department of Education, technical and vocational \neducation under the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA), and higher \neducation  under  the  Commission  for  Higher  Education.A  coordination  board,  supported  by  a \npresidential executive order, has been established to facilitate an integrated PQF, but it has not \nbeen fully operationalized. The Philippines apprenticeship program and the dual training system \nare  important  mechanisms  for  skills  development  and  addressing  the  slow  transition  to  work. \nHowever,  take-up  of  the  programs  by  youth  and  employers  is  low  with  only  28,000  new \napprentices in 2015. Apprenticeships are limited to 6 months; there is no certification process, \nand the inadequate involvement of industry associations in the design of apprenticeship programs \nexplains this poor take-up of apprenticeships. For funding of skills in the workplace, TESDA has \na  skills  fund  but  it  has  not  been  activated  and  other  TESDA  funding  schemes  have  been \nimplemented on an ad hoc basis and are not driven by employer demand. \n \n10. \nInsufficient  labor  policies  to  promote  decent  employment.  The  government  is \ncommitted to creating decent employment for young people and has identified a set of constraints \nto achieving this goal. First, there is a need to promote and incentivize employer compliance with \nlabor  standards  including  occupational  safety  and  health.  Second,  the  Philippines  dispute \n\n                                                \n9  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 2013. OECD Employment Outlook 2013. Paris. \n10 Labor Market  Programs in the Philippines (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 SPES offers poor students financial support through 3 month internships aimed at keeping them in education. From \n2010  to  2013,  SPES  had  assisted  493,742  poor  students,  of  which  42.5%  were  women.  GIP  provides  college \nstudents with internships in government. From 2012 to 2015, the GIP assisted 34,625 college students. \n\n12 ADB. 2015. Tourism Employment and Skills Needs in the Philippines: Projections to 2018. Manila. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nresolution  process  is  highly  litigious  leading  to  an  excessively  lengthy  and  costly  dispute \nsettlement process. This has deterred many employers from hiring youth on a regular contract. \nTo  address  this  problem,  the  government  piloted  a  30-day  mandatory  conciliation\u2013mediation \nservice for all labor and employment disputes, known as the Single Entry Approach (SEnA), with \nthe goal to resolve the dispute in 30 days. Following positive results from the pilot, legislation was \nenacted  in  2013  institutionalizing  SEnA.  Effective  implementation  of  the  reform  is  critical  to \nreducing the cost of disputes. Third, there is no unemployment insurance to provide temporary \nincome security during a worker\u2019s job-to-job transition. \n \n11. \nGovernment  reform  agenda.  The  government\u2019s  Philippine  Development  Plan,  2017\u2013\n2022  has  prioritized  youth  employment.  The  government\u2019s  approach  to  employment  is \ncategorized into three pillars: (i) education and skills development, (ii) job creation, and (iii) labor \nmarket activation. Under the first pillar, the main ongoing reform is the K to 12 program, which \nprovides high school graduates with the skills necessary to find jobs. By adding 2 years to high \nschool, the K to12 reforms will help to accelerate the school-to-work transition for many youths. \nHowever, international experience shows basic education reforms alone will not be sufficient to \nassist all out-of-school youth to integrate into the labor market. Further education and training and \nlabor  market  activation  programs  will  be  necessary.  The  government  is  also  looking  at \nstrengthening the TVET system by promoting an integrated qualifications and quality assurance \nframework, reforming the apprenticeship system, and looking at new ways to fund skills training \nin  the  workplace.  Under  the  job-creation  pillar,  priority  interventions  are  a  national  competition \npolicy, investment climate reforms, capital market development, and increased public and private \ninvestment in infrastructure. Under the labor market activation pillar, the government\u2019s strategy is \nto restructure the PESOs, reform active labor market programs, roll out new services to assist \nout-of-school  youth  and  the  unemployed,  and  link  these  services  together  to  achieve  better \nimpact.  \n \n12. \nADB\u2019s  experience.  ADB  has  supported  government  reforms  to  promote  employment \ncreation through loan programs, investment project loans, technical assistance (TA) grants, and \nknowledge  products  (Figure  2).  In  the  1990s,  ADB  was  instrumental  in  the  establishment  of \nTESDA and other supply side initiatives around TVET. Most recent programs include the Senior \nHigh  School  Support  Program  Loan,  2014\u20132019,  which  supports  the  government\u2019s  K  to  12 \nprogram.13 Since  2011,  ADB  has  supported  the  government\u2019s  employment  facilitation  agenda \nthrough the Increasing Competitiveness for Inclusive Growth Program, 2011\u20132014 and two large \nTA projects financed by the Government of Canada.14 These TA projects helped the government \nto successfully pilot the JobStart Philippines Program (JSP) in four LGUs, pilot a workplace skills \nfunding scheme in tourism, and carry out impact assessments on several main labor regulations \nand programs (Apprenticeship, SPES and PESOs) helping lay the analytical foundations for the \nprogram.15 An ADB capacity development TA, also financed by the Government of Canada for \n$7.5  million,  was  approved  in  October  2015  and  will  help  the  Department  of  Labor  and \nEmployment  (DOLE)  establish the  institutional  setup for the  nationwide  rollout  of  JSP,  provide \ncapacity development to PESOs as well as the LMIS that will support this rollout, and fund life \n\n                                                \n13 ADB. 2014.

Addressing  the  out-of-school  youth  employment \nproblem  requires  a  comprehensive  strategy  covering  labor  market  activation  programs,  skills \ntraining for out-of-school youth, labor market policies that improve youth access to employment, \nand effective gender mainstreaming of programs. A second lesson is that pilot projects testing \nnew strategies are an important part of policy development and building stakeholder support for \ninstitutional  reforms.  A  third  lesson  is  that  there  should  be  strong  government  ownership  and \nwidespread  political  will.  Developing  and  designing  programs  in  close  collaboration  with  the \ngovernment and other key stakeholders is critical to the successful implementation of activities \nand for the achievement of policy measures. Based on these lessons, ADB is taking an integrated \napproach  to  youth  employment  with  the  program,  extensively  engaging  with  stakeholders, \nelecting  key  representatives  to  a  national  program  steering  committee,  and  focusing  program \nimplementation at the LGU level.19 \n \n14. \nADB\u2019s value added to the  program  design  and implementation.  ADB  has  provided \ndirect  support  to  the  development  of  this  program  and  its  reforms.  Under  the  TA  to  DOLE \n(footnotes  14  and  16),  ADB  helped  to  design,  develop,  and  pilot  the  JSP  and  is  currently \nsupporting  the  nationwide  rollout  of  the  JSP.  ADB  has  helped  DOLE  enhance  its  LMIS  which \n\n                                                \n16 ADB. 2015.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Programmatic \nApproach and Policy-Based Loan for Subprogram 1 to the Republic of the Philippines for Encouraging Investment \nthrough Capital Market Reforms. Manila. \n\n18 ADB.  2015.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Programmatic \nApproach  and  Policy-Based  Loan  for  Subprogram  1  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  Expanding  Private \nParticipation in Infrastructure Program. Manila. \n\n19 Program Stakeholders Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fincludes an upgraded national skills registry and an enhanced job portal\u2014PhilJobNet\u2014providing \na  database  of  vacancies,  and  developed  and  implemented  the  localized  PESO  Employment \nInformation System (PEIS). Under the TA to the Department of Tourism (DOT) (footnote 14), ADB \nsupported  the  design,  development,  and  piloting  of  a  tourism  skills  funding  scheme.  Through \nADB\u2019s regulatory impact assessment program, assistance was provided for the review and draft \namendments to reform the PESO Act, SPES Act, and the Apprenticeship Act. ADB is assisting \nthe government design an enterprise-led learning network scheme that would provide grants to \nclusters of employers to fund short-term skills training of their employees and jobseekers.  While \ncurrently not included in the program, the TA also helped DOLE examine options for developing \nan unemployment insurance scheme.  \n \n15. \nThe results have been impressive. In 2015, the government enacted a new PESO Act that \nmandates the institutionalization of PESOs and secures budget funding. In 2016, the government \nenacted reforms to the SPES Act that provides a wage subsidy to poor students and enacted the \nAct  Institutionalizing  the  Nationwide  Implementation  of  the  JobStart  Philippines  Program  and \nProviding Funds Thereof (JSP Act) to institutionalize the JSP and ensure the program\u2019s financial \nsustainability. The government also submitted to Congress amendments to the  Apprenticeship \nAct. In 2016, the JSP had been rolled out to 14 cities and municipalities in Luzon, Visayas, and \nMindanao. An additional 10 LGUs will join the JSP each year from 2017 to 2020. The DOT is also \nrolling  out  its  industry  skills  funding  scheme.  The  government  has  included  the  proposed \nenterprise-led learning network scheme as a program in the Philippine Development Plan, 2017\u2013\n2022.  \n \n16. \nThe  programmatic  approach  and  policy-based  loan.  ADB  chose  the  programmatic \napproach  through  a  policy-based  loan  over  other  financing  modalities  to  help  sustain  the \ngovernment\u2019s reforms and financing to lift youth wage employment rates over the long term. The \nprogrammatic approach will also leverage the government budget in support of these reforms to \nensure  sustainability.  The  program  will  comprise  two  subprograms  covered  by  a medium-term \nresults framework, reflecting continuous engagement between ADB and the government on youth \nemployment. A third subprogram is optional, and its implementation is based on the government\u2019s \nrequest. A project investment may be considered during subprogram 2 formulation. \n \nDevelopment partner coordination. The Government of Canada has been instrumental \n17. \nin the development and support of the program, funding three large TA projects (footnotes 14 and \n16). Pilots developed under these TA projects are now being rolled out nationally. ADB worked \nwith  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  to  jointly  develop  a  youth \nemployment and skills report in 2016.20 ADB is also collaborating with the World Association of \nPublic  Employment  Services  in  support  of  capacity  development  of  the  PESOs.  Other \ndevelopment agencies that are involved in supporting this agenda include the International Labour \nOrganization,  which  is  helping  with  policy  development  and  the  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational Development, assisting with industry road maps.  \n \n18. \nEconomic  impact  of  the  program.    The  three  outputs  of  the  program  together  are \nexpected to increase the number of youth employed with higher earnings and in more productive \njobs. Potential economic gains are to be achieved through (i) reform of employment facilitation \nthat increases the placement rates of out-of-school youth into jobs with higher earnings, and (ii) \nefficiency gains from the development of public\u2013private partnerships in implementing labor market \nand skills programs at the local government level (para. 27). \n\n                                                \n20 ADB  and  OECD.

The outcome \nwill be a shortened school-to-work transition period for youth. The program will include a series \nof policy reforms and interventions to raise the youth employment rate and is designed to deliver \nthree outputs. All 14 policy measures under subprogram 1 (January 2015\u2013October 2016) have \nbeen accomplished. Subprogram 2 will include 7 prior expected actions and 8 policy milestones.21 \n \nC. \n \n20. \nOutput  1:  Labor  market  programs  made  to  work  better  for  youth.  This  output  will \nsupport the government\u2019s efforts to restructure its PESO and labor market activation programs \nand roll out new services to assist the youth to find decent employment. Accomplishments under \nsubprogram 1 include the following: in 2015, the government enacted amendments to the PESO \nAct, which now mandates the institutionalization of PESOs in LGUs, secures budgetary funding \nthrough the internal revenue allocation, and sets minimum service standards. In support of this \nreform,  the  government  commenced  capacity  development  of  LGUs  and  allocated  national \ngovernment  funding  for  this  purpose.  The  government  (through  DOLE)  also  commenced  the \nimplementation of its new LMIS, which includes an upgraded national skills registry, PhilJobNet \nand PEIS. In the area of labor market activation, the government introduced two major reforms. \nThe  first  reform  is  the  institutionalization  of  the  JSP.  The  government  enacted  legislation  that \nmandates the rollout of the program to all LGUs, secures national government budget funding for \nthe program\u2014including grants to employers for taking on youth\u2014life skills training, and develops \ncapacity of PESOs. In support of this reform, DOLE signed memorandums of understanding with \n14 LGUs to implement JSP in 2016 and the first round of youth intakes was completed. The JSP \nhas  mainstreamed  gender  considerations.  Life  skills  training  incorporate  modules  on  young \nwomen health and reproductive health, and a minimum quota of 55.0% of all JSP beneficiaries \nmust  be  women.  The  second  major  reform  was  to  amend  the  SPES  Act  with  the  aim  of \nstrengthening its design and scale-up. A key reform was to provide poor students with a wage \nsubsidy of which the LGU\u2019s share would be based on its fiscal capacity. \n \n21. \nFor  subprogram  2  (November  2016\u2013March  2019),  the  government  will  focus  on \nimplementing  reforms  with  quantitative  targets  to  demonstrate  results  and  impact.  Under \nsubprogram  2,  800  PESOs  will  be  institutionalized  with  permanent  staff  and  budget,  capacity \ndevelopment  and  LMIS,  34  LGUs  implementing  JSP  reaching  at  least  15,000  cumulative \nbeneficiaries, minimum quotas for young women participating in JSP and SPES, and sufficient \nbudget  allocations  to  PESOs  and  programs.  Subprogram  2  will  support  the  government  in \nrationalizing  existing  employment  and  training  programs,  and  implement  a  monitoring  and \nevaluation  system  for  all  employment  programs  to  allow  for  evidence-based  improvement  to \nprograms. The government  will  also develop  concept  and plans for  the establishment  of  a  job \ncenter at the national level as a one-stop center for capacity building to PESO staff.  \n \n22. \nOutput 2: Training systems made to work better for youth. This output supports the \ngovernment\u2019s  reforms  to  give  young  people  better  access  to  workplace  skills  development  by \nstrengthening the PQF, reforming the apprenticeship program, and partnering with employers for \nskills  development.  Accomplishments  under  subprogram  1  included  the  following.  First,  the \ngovernment  (through  TESDA)  enhanced  the  PQF  by  implementing  the  higher  level  TVET \nqualifications (National Certificate III to National Certificate V-Diploma) linked to core competency \nneeds  of  local  industries  and  adopted TVET quality  assurance  instruments  such  as the  STAR \n\n                                                \n21 Prior expected actions are considered disbursement conditions and policy milestones strengthen the program. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fRating System, the Asia Pacific Accreditation Certification Commission, and the East Asia Summit \nTVET  Quality  Assurance  Framework.  Second,  the  government  (through  TESDA)  submitted  to \nCongress  draft  amendments  to  the  Apprenticeship  Act  system  to  set  the  duration  of \napprenticeships based on skills needed, include certification of apprentices and curriculum with a \nmix  of  academic-based  learning  and  workplace  and  occupational  training,  and  make  the \ndevelopment  of  apprenticeship  programs  industry-driven.  Third,  the  government  enacted  the \nRepublic  Act  10771,  the  Philippine  Green Jobs  Act  of  2016,  to  provide  incentives  to  business \nenterprises that generate and sustain green jobs. Fourth, the government, through DOLE and in \ncoordination  with  industry  groups  and  TESDA,  developed  sector-based  human  resources \ndevelopment action plans in tourism, information and communications technology, manufacturing, \nand agribusiness. The tourism action plan is further advanced and included the creation of the \nOffice  of  Industry  Manpower  Development  with  designated  staff  and  budget,  and  the \nestablishment of the tourism skills training grant scheme. \n \n23. \nFor  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  focus  on  institutionalizing  reforms  such  as \nsubmitting to Congress a bill to institutionalize the PQF and coordinating body and development. \nThe government will also lead the roll-out of the employer-led learning network and training grants \nin tourism and other sectors with promising employment prospects identified by the industry road \nmaps.  Subprogram  2  will  also  implement  reforms  to  the  dual  training  system  and  the \napprenticeship  program  and  start  a  call  for  apprenticeship  program  proposals  from  industry \ngroups.  \n \n24. \nOutput 3: Labor market policies improved  for the benefit of youth. This output will \nsupport  the  government\u2019s  agenda  to  promote  decent  employment.  Under  subprogram  1,  the \ngovernment implemented its new legislated mandatory 30-day conciliation\u2013mediation mechanism \n(SEnA) for resolving unfair dismissal disputes. As of 2015, 108,234 cases were resolved under \nthe  SEnA  mechanism,  thereby  reducing  the  number  of  cases  going  through  arbitration.  For \nsubprogram 2, the government will continue to implement the new SEnA mechanism and explore \nadditional reforms to promote its decent employment agenda such as unemployment insurance. \n \nD. \n \nThe government has requested a regular loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \n25. \nresources to help finance subprogram  1. The  loan will  have a 15-year  term,  including  a grace \nperiod of 3 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such \nother terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the annuity method \n(30% discount factor), the average maturity is 12 years and there is no maturity premium payable \nto ADB. The loan proceeds will be used to finance foreign exchange of economy-wide imports, \nexcluding  ineligible items  and  imports financed by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources. The \nproceeds of the policy-based loan will be disbursed upon effectiveness in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time).   \n \n26. \nIn 2017, the gross development financing needs is planned at $12.6 billion with a budget \ndeficit projected at 3.0% of GDP. The government plans to raise $10.1 billion equivalent primarily \nfrom the domestic bond market and $2.6 billion from foreign loans, of which $1.4 billion is program \nloans from development partners. The loan size is based on the financing needs of the Philippines, \nthe strength of the reform program, and the development expenditures arising from the program \nsuch as national government budget allocations to scale up employment programs (para. 28). \n \n \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n \n27. \nThe  Department  of  Finance  (DOF)  will  be  the  executing  agency.  DOLE, TESDA,  DOT, \nDepartment  of  Trade  and  Industry,  and  LGUs  (through  PESOs),  will  be  the  implementing \nagencies.  A  steering  committee  will  oversee  implementation,  chaired  by  the  DOF,  with  the \nimplementing  agencies  and  the  National  Economic  and  Development  Authority  and  the \nDepartment of Budget and Management as members. Other stakeholders from employers and \nyouth groups will participate from time to time. The implementation periods are January 2015\u2013\nOctober 2016 for subprogram 1 and November 2016\u2013March 2019 for subprogram 2. The policy-\nbased loans will be disbursed upon accomplishment of policy triggers. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nGovernance \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n28. \nThe program impact assessment estimates potential net benefits (benefits minus cost) of \nthe program to be about $0.4 billion in present value.22 This gives a benefit\u2013cost ratio of about \n1.4.  These  direct  benefits  of  about  $1.5  billion  in  present  value  are  due to  more  youths  being \nemployed, and higher earnings of youth in more productive jobs. Costs of about $1.1 billion in \npresent  value  are  expected  be  incurred  from  scaling  up  SPES,  rolling  out  JSP  and \ninstitutionalizing 800 PESOs. The interventions also yield significant distributional benefits, as a \nmajority of beneficiaries are young women and economically disadvantaged youth. \n \nB. \n \n28. \nThe  government  has  implemented  major  reforms  to  improve  the  public  financial \nmanagement (PFM) systems.  A proposed Public Financial Accountability Act will help to enforce \naccountability  in  PFM  by  strengthening  Congress\u2019  financial  control  funding,  instituting  an \nintegrated  PFM  system,  and  increasing  budget  transparency  and  participation.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment and the DOF. The government is implementing a comprehensive and results-based \nanticorruption  action  plan,  drawing  on  a review  of  the  National  Anti-Corruption  Plan  of  Action. \nVarious  initiatives  by  development  partners  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Office  of  the \nOmbudsman and the justice sector have achieved positive results.  \n \nC. \n \n29. \nSubprogram  1  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  NEET  rates  are  higher \namong young women than young men. The program aims to address this gender employment \ngap  through  policy  measures  and  interventions,  including  setting  quotas  for  young  women \nparticipating  in  SPES  and  skills  training  programs,  and  a  target  of  55%  for  young  women \naccessing  services  under  JSP.  Further  development  of  a  life  skills  training  health  module  will \ninclude issues  specific to women\u2019s  health  and  reproductive health. Overall,  it  is  estimated that \nwomen  may  account  for  80%  of  the  benefits  arising  from  the  program  (footnote  22).  While \ninterventions  through  the  program  will  benefit  a wide  range of  youth, they  may  also contribute \ndirectly and/or indirectly to a reduction in income inequality through program targeting of youth \nfrom low-income households and higher youth employment rates. \n \n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n                                                \n22 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nD. \n \n30. \nIn accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified \ncategory  C  for  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  The \nassessment of policy actions concludes that no safeguard policies are triggered.  Based on an \nassessment of the policy actions, the policy-based loan component will  not have any potential \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  issues  and  will  not  have  any  potential \nenvironmental impacts.   \n \nE. \n \n31. \nPublic  financial  management  and  corruption  are  assessed  as  substantial  risks.  These \nnational-level  risks  are  being  mitigated  through  strengthening  the  budget  review  process, \ninstitutionalized  transparency,  and  additional  measures  supported  by  ADB  including  the \nenhancement  of  legislative  oversight  over  anticorruption  bodies.  Contextual  risks  include  the \npossibility  that  the  government  may  not  secure  sufficient  national  budgetary  funding  for  youth \nemployment and skills training. The JSP Act institutionalizing JSP and amendments to the PESO \nAct and the SPES Act will help ensure the programs continue to support youth employment and \nskills development in the future. Other contextual risks that local governments\u2019 may lack capacity \nand  resources  at  the  LGU  level  to  implement  these  programs  are  mitigated  through  recent \nlegislation securing budgetary funding for programs and continuity in TA by ADB to national and \nlocal  government  staff  implementing  the  programs.  All  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are \ndescribed in the risk assessment and risk management plan.23 \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n32. \nThe government and the DOF have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan agreement.  \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n33. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  programmatic  approach  and  policy-based  loan  would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the \nabsence of the President, under the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, \nI recommend that the Board approve \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  programmatic  approach  for  the  Facilitating  Youth  School-to-Work  Transition \nProgram, and \nthe loan of $300,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 1 of the \nFacilitating Youth School-to-Work Transition Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources,  in  regular  terms,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of \n15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n\n21 April 2017 \n                                                \n23 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nStephen Groff \nVice-President \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nRisks \n\nThe government \nmay not secure \nsufficient national \nbudgetary funding \nfor youth \nemployment \nprograms. \n\nLGUs allocate \ninsufficient \nbudgetary and staff \nresources to PESOs \nto implement JSP, \nwhich is time-\nintensive. \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Program is Aligned With \nWage employment rate for the country\u2019s youth increased (Philippine Development Plan, 2017\u20132022)a \n\n \n\n \n\nResults \nChain \nOutcome \nSchool-to-\nwork transition \nperiod for \nyouth \nshortened \n\nOutputs \n1.
