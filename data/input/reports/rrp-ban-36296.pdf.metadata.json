Newly constructed and upgraded civil works will include capital and \nrecurrent investments to improve CWM. \n \nThe  Project  will  help  ensure  the  delivery  of  a  package  of  preventive, \npromotive,  and  curative  health  services  to  the  poor  in  all  the  six  city \ncorporations\u2014Dhaka,  Chittagong,  Khulna,  Rajshahi,  Sylhet,  and  Barisal\u2014\nand five municipalities\u2014Bogra, Comilla, Sirajgonj, Madhabdi and Savar. The \nservices  will  be  designed  to  reduce  child  and  maternal  mortality  and \nmorbidity, and help the country achieve the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). The Project will continue to contract out primary health care (PHC) \nservices  to  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  through  partnership \nagreements that were pioneered under the first Urban Primary Health Care \nProject  (UPHCP-I).  Free  and  easily  accessible  PHC  services  will  be  made \navailable to the poor. The Project will ensure pro-poor targeting by requiring \nthat  at  least  30%  of  the  preventive,  promotive,  and  curative  services  are \nprovided  free  for  the  poor.  User  fees  will  be  charged  to  people  who  can \nafford them. Nutritional supplements will be given to moderately to severely \nmalnourished  women  and  children.  The  Project  will support  construction  of \n64  health  facilities,  upgrading  of  4,  and  purchase  of  12  apartments  and/or \nbuildings for PHC facilities in Dhaka city corporation. Community-run latrines \nand  community-based  solid-waste  disposal  will  be  piloted  to  improve \nenvironmental health, and CWM will be supported.  \n \nUntil recently, urban PHC has been a neglected subsector in Bangladesh as \nin  most  other  South  Asian  countries.  The  urban  population  has  been \ngrowing  rapidly,  mostly  because  of  rural\u2013urban  migration  by  the  poor  and \nthe  vulnerable.  The  absolute  number  of  poor  urban  households  is \nincreasing. Studies have shown that the health indicators of the urban poor \nare  worse  than  those  of  the  rural  poor  because  of  poorer  living  conditions, \nand  limited  urban  PHC.  Failure  to  provide  urban  PHC  can  have  serious \nnegative  consequences  beyond  urban  areas  because  infectious  diseases \ncan spread from urban to rural areas. Rapidly growing urban slums without \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nObjectives \n\nof \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\nlead \n\nurban \n\nhealth \n\nand  well-being \n\nto  epidemics  of  emerging  or  reemerging \nadequate  PHC  may \ncommunicable diseases. Investments in other urban services such as water \nand  sanitation,  combined  with  the  strengthening  of  health  services,  will \nimprove \npoor. \nThe Project will build on the gains of UPHCP-I, and strengthen the pro-poor \nfocus, nutrition provision, and project implementation.  \n \nA $10-million Asian Development Fund grant will support various HIV/AIDS \nand infectious disease control activities.  Grant financing can be justified at \ncountry and project levels. The Project is closely aligned with Bangladesh\u2019s \npoverty  reduction  strategy,  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program,  ADB\u2019s \nPartnership  Agreement  on  Poverty  Reduction  with  the  Government  of \nBangladesh (2000), and ADB\u2019s commitment to reducing poverty and helping \ndeveloping member countries achieve the MDGs. More than half the project \nbase costs address infectious disease and HIV/AIDS control. \n \nThe Project will improve the health status of the urban population, especially \nof the poor, in six city corporations and five municipalities. At least 30% of all \nthe  services  provided  under  the  Project  will  be  targeted  at  poor  people \nearning  less  than  Taka  700  per  month  (the  poor).  The  specific  project \nobjectives  are  to  improve:  (i)  access  to  and  use  of  urban  PHC  services  in \nthe  project  area,  with  a  particular  focus  on  extending  provision  to  the \npoorest;  (ii)  the  quality  of  urban  PHC  services  in  the  project  area;  and  (iii) \nthe cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and institutional and financial sustainability \nof PHC to meet the needs of the urban poor. \n \n\n \nCost Estimates  The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies, and taxes \nand  duties,  is  estimated  to  be  $90.0  million  equivalent.  Of  this  amount, \n$4.3 million equivalent (5%) is the foreign exchange cost, and $85.7 million \nequivalent (95%) is the local currency cost. \n \nThe indicative financing plan is presented in the table below.  \n \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nForeign \nExchange \n4.3 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n\n($ million) \nLocal \nCurrency \n25.7 \n10.0 \n5.0 \n25.0 \n2.0 \n\nTotal \nCost \n30.0 \n10.0 \n5.0 \n25.0 \n2.0 \n\nPercent \n\n           33 \n           11 \n             6 \n           28 \n             2 \n\nSource \n\nADB Loan \nADB Grant \nSida \nDFID \nUNFPA \nGovernment of \nBangladesh \nTotal \n\n0.0 \n 4.3 \n\n18.0 \n 90.0 \n\n           20 \n         100 \n\n18.0 \n 85.7 \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  DFID=United  Kingdom  Department  for  International \nDevelopment,  Sida=  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency,  UNFPA  = \nUnited Nations Population Fund.   \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $30  million  equivalent  to \nSDR 19.954 million and an HIV/AIDS and infectious disease control grant of \n$10 million in various currencies from its Special Funds resources to finance \n44% of the project cost. This will cover $4.3 million of the foreign exchange \n\n \n\n\fv\n\nthe \n\nlocal  currency  cost. \ncost  and  $35.7  million  equivalent  of \nThe Government of Sweden through the Swedish International Development \nCooperation  Agency  (Sida)  will  provide  a  $5-million  grant,  and  the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom through the Department for International \nDevelopment (DFID) will provide a $25-million grant both to be administered \nby  ADB.  The  United  Nations  Population  Fund  (UNFPA)  will  cofinance  the \nProject  through  a  $2-million  grant,  which  it  will  directly  administer. \nThe  Government  of  Bangladesh  will  provide  $18  million  equivalent  in  local \ncurrency.  \n \nThe  service  delivery  contract  with  NGOs  would  include  two  activities  fully \nfunded  by  the  grant:  (i)  $2.5  million  for  operating  24  HIV/AIDS  voluntary \ntesting  and  counseling  centers,  one  for  each  partnership  area;  and \n(ii) $5.0 million for sexually transmitted infection (STI) and reproductive tract \ninfection  (RTI)  control.  Under  the  behavior  change  communication  and \nmarketing  (BCCM)  component,  the  grant  will  support  $2.5  million  for \nHIV/AIDS, STI, and infectious disease control.   \n \nMonitoring  and  evaluation  of  grant-funded  components  are  clearly \ndistinguishable  but  have  been  integrated  into  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework.  The  monitoring  system  will  be  based  on  monthly  reports  from \nthe  NGO  partners,  city  corporations,  and  municipalities  to  the  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU).  These  monthly  reports  will  provide  the  basis  for \ntracking  and  evaluating  specific  inputs  (e.g.,  medicines,  other  supplies, \nfinancial  inputs,  HIV/AIDS  control  posters  purchased)  and  outputs  (e.g., \nnumber of patients counseled and tested for HIV/AIDS, and patients treated \nfor  RTI  and  STI).  An  independent  evaluation  firm  will  conduct  household \nsurveys at project inception, midterm, and end. These will be in addition to \nsurveys  of  health  facilities  to  evaluate  the  outcomes  and  impact  of  grant \nfunding.  \n \nFor  grant  administration  purposes, \nthe  Executing  Agency,  Local \nGovernment  Division  (LGD),  will  provide  a  separate  section  in  its  quarterly \nreport to ADB covering financial and physical inputs and outputs relating to \nHIV/AIDS and other infectious disease control.  \n \nThe  proposed  ADB  loan  is  for  SDR  19.954  million  ($30  million  equivalent) \nfrom  Special  Funds  resources.  The  term  of  the  proposed  loan  will  be \n32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  with  an  interest  charge  of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \n6.5 years \n\n \n31 December 2011 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nADB Grant for \nHIV/AIDS and \nInfectious \nDisease Control \n\n \nLoan Amount \nand Terms \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nEstimated \nProject \nCompletion \nDate \n\n \n\n \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nThe  PMU  will  be  established  in  the  LGD  of  the  Ministry  of  Local \nGovernment, Rural Development and Cooperatives (MOLGRDC). A national \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nurban  PHC  committee  chaired  by  the  LGD  minister,  and  a  national  project \nsteering  committee  chaired  by  LGD  secretary  will  be  formed  to  oversee \npolicy  and  project  implementation.  Eleven  project  implementation  units  will \nbe  established  in  the  six  city  corporations  and  five  municipalities  to  be \ncovered.  A  city  corporation  or  municipality  PHC  committee  headed  by  the \nmayor  of  the  city  corporation  or  the  chairman  of  the  municipality  will  guide \nproject implementation. At the facility level, a ward PHC committee chaired \nby  a  ward  commissioner  will  help  ensure  community  participation  and \nempower the poor to use the services provided.  \n \nThe  LGD  of  the  MOLGRDC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  and  the  city \ncorporations and municipalities will be the implementing agencies. \n \nProcurement  of  ADB-financed  goods,  related  services,  and  civil  works  will \nbe  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and \nlocal procurement may be conducted in accordance with Bangladesh Public \nProcurement Regulations (2003), acceptable to ADB. \n \nConsultants  and  consulting  firms  will  be  recruited  under  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nrecruitment  of  local  consultants,  which  may  include  Bangladesh  Public \nProcurement  Regulations  (2003).  The  consulting \nfirms  will  provide: \n(i) management  support  for  the  PMU  and  management  training,  (ii)  quality \nassurance  training  and  supportive  supervision,  (iii)  health  management \ninformation  systems  development  and  implementation,  (iv)  behavioral \nchange  communication  and  marketing,  (v) financial  management  and \nperformance  auditing,  (vi)  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation, \nand  (vii)  design  and  supervisory  engineering  services  for  construction. \n \nThe  management  support  firm  will  be  responsible  for  recruiting  one  long-\nterm  international  consultant  (6.5  years),  one  long-term  national  consultant \n(6.5 years), two short-term international consultants for a total of 20 person-\nmonths  (HIV/AIDS  specialist  for  12  person-months,  and  management \ninformation  specialist  for  8  person-months);  and  nine  short-term  national \nconsultants  for  a  total  of  150  person-months  (poverty  specialist  for \n24  person-months,  institutional  development  specialist  for  24  person-\nmonths,  gender  specialist  for  12  person-months,  environment  specialist  for \n6 person-months, resettlement specialist for 3 person-months, procurement \nspecialist for 36 person-months, HIV/AIDS specialist for 24 person-months, \nnutrition  specialist  for  6  person-months,  and  management  information \nspecialist for 15 person-months). \n \nPartnership agreements to deliver PHC service packages will be awarded to \neligible  private  sector  participants  including  NGOs  in  accordance  with \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  and  on  similar  terms  to \nthat  used  in  UPHCP-I.  The  award  of  contract  will  be  subject  to  the  bidder \ndemonstrating to the satisfaction of LGD and ADB that it has the necessary \nexpertise and resources to provide the PHC services.  \n \n\n \nExecuting \nAgency \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting \nServices \n\n \nPartnership \nAgreement \n\n \n\n\fvii\n\n \nThe Project will improve the health status of the poor in six city corporations \nand  five  municipalities  by  providing  an  essential  package  of  high-impact \nservices.  By  reducing  child  and  maternal  mortality,  the  Project  will  help \nBangladesh achieve the MDGs for child mortality and maternal health. \n \nWomen  and  children  will  constitute  more \nthan  75%  of  all  project \nbeneficiaries. The Project will improve the efficiency of urban health services \nby: (i) improving the spatial distribution of health centers, e.g., PHC centers, \ncomprehensive  reproductive  health  care  (CRHC)  centers,  and  mini-clinics, \nin  accordance  with  population  density  and  geographical \nfactors; \n(ii) supporting cost-effective interventions to reduce mortality and morbidity; \n(iii)  enabling  least-cost  private  sector  participation  in  the  provision  of \npreventive  and  promotive  health  care  services  by  partner  NGOs; \n(iv)  allowing  appropriate  user  fees;  (v)  improving  the  monitoring  and \nsupervision  system;  and  (vi)  concentrating  on  provision  of  health  services \nthat  will  create  the  greatest  public  good,  to  use  scarce  government \nresources more efficiently.  \n\nlead \n\nthat  will \n\nimprovements \n\nThe  Project  will  improve  the  quality  of  PHC  by  building  the  management \ncapacity  of  health  departments  in  the  six  city  corporations  and  five \nmunicipalities to effectively manage the health services. \n \nHealth  service  improvements  in  the  project  area  will  provide  three  types  of \neconomic  benefits:  (i)  health \nto  better \nproductivity and learning outcomes at school; (ii) a reduction in days lost due \nto sickness or health care; and (iii) savings in out-of-pocket expenditure on \nhealth care because of better and more efficient health services. \n \nDelays  in  contracting-out  of  services  to  NGOs  may  jeopardize  project \nimplementation.  Some  delays  may  be  due  to  challenging  procedures, \nincluding bid preparation, attracting effective NGOs, transparent evaluation, \nand issuing timely contracts. The proposed advance actions, combined with \nthe  lessons  learned  during  UPHCP-I,  will  reduce  the  risk  of  delay.  The \nfailure  to  have  a  transparent  and  competitive  bidding  process  to  select \neffective NGOs at the most competitive rates is a risk. The failure to execute \na contract with NGOs that imposes an obligation on them to implement the \npartnership agreements effectively and, especially, target the poor is also a \nrisk.  \n \nThe implementation risks are significant and include failure to ensure timely \npayments  to  NGOs,  and  proper  supervision  of  the  partner  NGO  to  ensure \naccess \nthe  poor.  UPHCP-I \nexperiences have been used to design measures to reduce these potential \nrisks.  The  measures \ninvolvement  of  city  corporations  or \nmunicipalities, constitution of a national PHC committee, engagement of an \nindependent  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  firm, \nprovision  of  consultant  support  to  the  PMU,  careful  review  of  tender \ndocuments  by  ADB  and  the  Government,  and  building  on  procedures  that \nproved effective under UPHCP-I. \n\nto  good-quality  services,  especially \n\ninclude \n\nfor \n\n \n \nProject Benefits \nand \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks, \nAssumptions \nand Mitigations \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fviii \n\n \n\n \nIneffective pro-poor targeting is a potential risk for the Project, and effective \ndeterrents  for  not  achieving  pro-poor  targets  are  needed.  The  Project \nproposes  safeguards,  including  contractually  obligating  at  least  30%  of  the \nservices to be provided free to the poor. Contracts will be designed to deter \nNGOs from failing to achieve pro-poor targets. \n \nCorruption  is  a  risk,  partly  because  the  project  implementation  is  complex. \nHence, a number of specific measures to mitigate the risk of corruption and \nimprove  governance  have  been  included  in  the  project  design.  These \ninclude  development  of  a  good  governance  and  anti-corruption  action  plan \nand  quarterly  reporting  of  such  action  plan,  review  through  performance \naudit  of  the  timely  disbursements  to  partner  NGOs,  strengthening  financial \nmanagement, and beneficiary grievance resolution mechanisms.  \n \nLack  of  financial  sustainability  after  the  Project  closes  is  a  major  risk.  The \nproject  benefits  are  unlikely  to  be  sustainable  after  project  completion \nwithout  an  appropriately  designed  fiscal  model.  The  Government  needs  to \nadd at least $11.1 million to its current expenditure to sustain urban PHC in \n2012-2013 and $11.7 million per year in the following years. To mitigate this \nrisk,  the  Project  will  help  the  LGD  explore  alternative  fiscal  models.  The \nGovernment  has  given  an  assurance  that  a  fiscal  model  will  be  selected \nwithin  2  years  of  loan  effectiveness  to  ensure  the  financial  sustainability  of \nthe Project after its completion. \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fix\n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \n(ii)  a  proposed  grant  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Second  Urban  Primary \nHealth  Care  Project  (the  Project),1  and  (iii)  proposed  administration  by  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) of grants for the Project to be provided by each of the Government of Sweden and \nthe Government of the United Kingdom. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2.  \nBangladesh has achieved remarkable health gains in the last two decades, although it is \nstill among the poorest nations in the world. Between 1990 and 2002, the under-5 mortality rate \ndeclined from 144 to 73 per 1,000 live births, and the infant mortality rate declined from 96 to 48 \nper 1,000 live births. Bangladesh is more likely than other countries in South Asia to achieve the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  related  to  child  health.  Life  expectancy  increased  from  \n53 years in 1994 to 61 years in 2004, and the total fertility rate decreased from 6.3 in 1971 to 3.3 \nin the 1990s.  \n \n3.  \nThe  Government  of  Bangladesh  is  committed  to  improving  the  health  of  its  citizens, \nparticularly the poor. Its health policy (2000) emphasizes improving the quality and efficiency of \nand access to public health services. However, most public primary health care (PHC) services \ncater to the rural population2 (Appendix 2). The Local Government Division (LGD) of the Ministry \nof Local Government, Rural Development, and Cooperatives (MOLGRDC)  implemented the first \nUrban  Primary  Health  Care  Project  (UPHCP-I)  in  four  city  corporations\u2014Dhaka,  Chittagong, \nKulna,  and  Rajshahi.  UPHCP-I,  which  supported  the  contracting-out  of  PHC  services  to \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  through  partnership  agreements,  will  come  to  a  close  at \nthe end of June 2005. At the request of the Government, ADB approved technical assistance3 to \nprepare  the  Project,  which  aims  to  consolidate  the  gains  of  UPHCP-I  and  expand  urban  PHC \nservices  to  the  remaining  two  city  corporations\u2014Sylhet  and  Barisal\u2014and  five  municipalities\u2014\nBogra, Comilla, Sirajgonj, Madhabdi, and Savar.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nKey Problems \n\nUrban  Population  Growth  and  Poverty.  The  urban  population\u2014currently  31  million\u2014 \n4. \nis  increasing  rapidly.  The  urban  poor  increased  from  7  million  in  1985  to  12  million  in  1999. \nAlthough  hardcore  poverty  (less  than  1,805  kilocalories  per  day  per  head)  decreased  by  \n1.36  million  households    between  1991  (4.83  million)  and  2000  (3.47  million)  in  rural  areas,  it \nincreased by 0.53 million in urban areas (from 0.65 million in 1991 to 1.18 million in 2000).4 The \nhealth indicators are worse for the urban poor than for the rural poor.5  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Primary health care (PHC) services provided by municipalities represent 0.34% by value of all health services, and \n\nonly 7% by value of the government services delivered by rural health facilities. \n\n3  ADB. 2003.

Bangladesh. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n5. \nHealth Inequities. The health inequities are wide and disturbing. For example, the poor-\nto-rich  ratio  of  child  mortality  is  1.6\u20131.9:1.0  (child  mortality  is  60\u201390%  higher  in  the  poorest \nquintile than in the richest quintile). The poor-to-rich ratio for child malnutrition is even worse: 2:1 \nfor  moderate  stunting  and  underweight  (moderate)  and  5:1  for  severe  underweight.  Gender \ninequalities  are  persistent:  mortality  in  male  children  aged  1\u20134  years  is  28  per  1,000  live  births \ncompared with 38 per 1,000 live births in girls in the same age group.  \n \n6. \nFertility  Decline  and  Population  Growth.  Despite  good  progress  made  in  the  last  two \ndecades, the total fertility rate stalled at around 3 from 1995 to 2003. Bangladesh must achieve a \nreplacement fertility rate quickly. Among other measures, contraceptive prevalence needs to be \nraised to 70\u201375% from the current 54% if the population is to stabilize.  \n \n7. \nReproductive and Child Health. The current maternal mortality ratio is 300 per 100,000 \nlive births. Bangladesh has low rates of antenatal care6 and only 6% of deliveries take place in \nhealth facilities. Assistance by skilled birth attendants at the residence of pregnant women will be \nkey  to  further  reducing  maternal  mortality.  Only  48%  of  the  children  who  reported  acute \nrespiratory  infections  and  36%  of  children  with  diarrhea  were  taken  to  a  health  facility  for \ntreatment.  Of  the  children  with  diarrhea,  20%  were  not  given  oral  rehydration  solution,  \nor recommended home-made fluid or increased fluid intake.  \n \nMalnutrition. High rates of malnutrition persist despite progress made in the last decade, \n8. \nremain.  Almost  half  of  women  and  78%  of  children  \nand  micronutrient  deficiencies \n6\u201311 months of age suffer from anemia; 45% of all children under 5 years are considered short \nfor their age or stunted, and 18% of all children are severely stunted. Of children under 5, 48% of \nchildren  are  underweight  and  13%,  severely  underweight.  Maternal  malnutrition  is  high:  6%  of \npregnant women are severely malnourished and 12%, moderately malnourished. \n \nHIV/AIDS  and  Other  Infectious  Diseases.  Although  HIV/AIDS7  prevalence  rates  are \n9. \nlow,8 HIV/AIDS prevention and counseling services must be expanded in urban areas to control \nfurther  spread  of  the  virus.  Knowledge  about  HIV/AIDS  in  urban  areas  is  still  only  64%  among \nwomen who have ever been married. While 83% of urban women had no knowledge of sexually \ntransmitted  infections  (STIs),  73%  of  urban  men  had  no  knowledge.9  The  emergence  of  drug-\nresistant  malaria  and  tuberculosis  (TB)  is  a  major  concern.  The  total  prevalence  rate  of  smear-\npositive cases of TB is 910 per 100,000 population, 1,190 in the male population, and 540 in the \nfemale population.10 TB case detection rates, estimated as low as 34%, need to be increased to \nat  least  75%,  and  cure  rates  need  to  be  sustained  at  85%,  which  will  require  concerted  and \nadditional efforts among the urban poor.  \n \n10. \nResource  Gap.  Bangladesh\u2019s  per  capita  health  expenditures\u2014public  and  private\u2014 \nare low. Of the total $11 per capita expenditure on health in 1997, only $3 was contributed by the \npublic  sector,  which  is  far  below  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  Commission  on \nMacroeconomics and Health\u2019s estimated minimum financial needs of $30\u201340 per person per year \nto  cover  only  essential  health  interventions.11  The  situation  is  much  worse  for  urban  areas,  as \nmost public subsidies for PHC target rural areas (Appendix 2). \n \n\n                                                 \n6  The  proportion  of  pregnant  women  making  at  least  one  antenatal  visit  has  improved  to  37%  in  2000,  which  still \n\nleaves more than 2.5 million pregnancies annually without any antenatal care. \n\n7  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.  \n8  The HIV/AIDS prevalence rate in the general population (15\u201345 years) is <0.2%. \n9  NIPORT. 2001.

Although \n\nthe  urban  population  has  been \n\n11. \nrapidly,  \nthe Government and external funding agencies have addressed urban PHC seriously only in the \nlast  decade.  The  ADB-supported  UPHCP-I  and  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment (USAID)-supported NGO service delivery program, which contract out urban PHC \nto  NGOs  (Supplementary  Appendix  A),  are  the  only  major  urban  PHC  projects  in  Bangladesh, \nleaving  significant  needs  for  urban  PHC  unmet.  Bangladesh\u2019s  health  policy  adopted  in  2000 \nstresses the need to expand health services in urban areas, especially for the poor. The interim \npoverty reduction strategy paper12 and the targets set in the Partnership Agreement on Poverty \nReduction  (PAPR)  with  ADB  reflect  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  achieving  the  MDGs  by \nstrengthening urban PHC, especially for the poor. \n \nADB\u2019s country strategy supports delivery of PHC services in urban areas over the medium \n12. \nterm,  and  building  local  government  capacity  to  deliver  high-quality  services  to  the  urban  poor, \nparticularly  women  and  children,  in  partnership  with  NGOs.13  The  country  assistance  program \nevaluation  (CAPE)  in  2003  highlighted  the  need  for  stronger  collaboration  with  NGOs,  more \neffective empowerment of local communities, and support for accountable and transparent local \ngovernment  bodies  in  ADB\u2019s  future  programs.14  The  Project  is  therefore  closely  aligned  with: \nADB\u2019s  overall  policy  for  reducing  human  poverty  and  helping  developing  member  countries \nachieve  the  MDGs;  Bangladesh\u2019s  national  poverty  reduction  strategy;  the  PAPR;  the  country \nstrategy and program update; and the recommendations of the 2003 CAPE. \n \nLessons  Learned.  The  lessons  learned  from  reviews15  of  UPHCP-I,  especially  those \n13. \nrelating  to  better  pro-poor  targeting,  adequate  provision  of  medicines,  support  for  quality \nassurance,  greater  emphasis  on  behavior  change  communication,  the  need  for  environmental \nhealth  improvement,  and  institutional  mechanisms  for  greater  involvement  by  city  mayors  have \nbeen  incorporated  into  the  Project\u2019s  design  (Appendix  3).  The  strengths  of  UPHCP-I\u2014 \nthe  partnership  agreements  that  harness  private  sector/NGO  provision  of  a  public  service,  for \nexample\u2014have been retained in the Project. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n14. \nThe Project will improve the health status of the urban population, especially of the poor, \nin  six  city  corporations\u2014Dhaka,  Chittagong,  Khulna,  Rajshahi,  Sylhet  and  Barisal\u2014and  five \nmunicipalities\u2014Bogra,  Comilla,  Sirajgonj,  Madhabdi,  and  Savar.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. At least 30% of all the project services will target the poor (Appendix \n4).  The  specific  project  objectives  are:  (i)  to  improve  equitable  access  and  use  of  urban  PHC \nservices  in  the  project  area,  with  a  focus  on  providing  them  to  the  poorest;  (ii)  to  improve  the \nquality of urban PHC services in the project area; and (iii) to improve the cost-effectiveness and \nefficiency and the institutional and financial sustainability of PHC to serve the urban poor. \n\n                                                 \n12 Economic  Relations  Division,  Ministry  of  Finance.  2002.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n15. \nThe  Project  has  the  following  four  components,  which  were  designed  through  intensive \nnational and local consultations with key stakeholders, paying attention to the needs of the poor \nand vulnerable. \n \n\n1. \n\nProvision  of  Primary  Health  Care  through  Partnership  Agreements  and \nBehavior Change Communication and Marketing \n\na. \n\nPartnership Agreements  \n\nto  provide  PHC  services \n\nThe  Project  will  continue \n\n16. \nthrough  performance-based \ncontracting-out  of  PHC  services  to  NGOs.  It  will  use  partnership  agreements  similar  to  those \npioneered  during  UPHCP-I.  The  partner  NGOs  will  provide  essential  services  package  plus \n(ESP+)  services  (Supplementary  Appendix  B)  in  the  partnership  agreement  areas.  These \nservices  will  consist  of  (i)  a  HIV/AIDS  voluntary  counseling  and  testing  (VCT)  center  for  each \npartnership  area;  (ii)  STI  and  reproductive  tract  infection  (RTI)  control;  and  (iii)  other  essential \nservices package (ESP) plus. Subcomponents (i) and (ii) will be financed by the ADB grant and \nsubcomponent (iii) by other financing. \n \n17. \nA procedure acceptable to ADB will be followed when selecting partner NGOs (Appendix \n5).  A  national  bid  evaluation  committee  will  evaluate  the  technical  and  financial  bids.  \nThe  committee  will  be  chaired  by  the  LGD  secretary  and  will  include  a  representative  from  the \nMinistry  of  Health  and  Family  Welfare  (MOHFW)  (at  not  less  than  deputy  secretary  level), \nrepresentatives  of  cofinancers  (including  the  United  Nations  Population  Fund  (UNFPA)),  and \nrepresentatives of United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and WHO.  \n \n 18. \nThe  Project  will  finance  24  partnership  agreements,  each  covering  200,000\u2013300,000 \npeople. Each partnership agreement area will consist of one comprehensive reproductive health \ncare  (CRHC)  center,  at  least  one  PHC  center  per  30,000\u201350,000  people,  and  at  least  one \nsatellite  or  mini-clinic  per  10,000  people.  PHC  centers  will  provide  a  full  range  of  essential \nservices, \nincluding  basic  emergency  obstetric  care.  The  CRHC  centers  will  provide \ncomprehensive emergency obstetric care, newborn care, and specialized ESP+ services. Two of \nthe  three  partnership  areas  in  Chittagong  will  be  covered  by  the  city  corporation  health \ndepartment, while the remaining area will be contracted out to a partner NGO, as for UPHCP-I. \nUNFPA will continue to support strengthening of CRHC centers by providing equipment, supplies, \nand training through parallel cofinancing. The Project will support CRHC-center-based HIV/AIDS \nvoluntary testing and counseling services for HIV/AIDS through grant financing.  \n \n19. \nThe partnership agreements will ensure that at least 30% of each service will be provided \nfree to the poor, who will be identified through participatory poverty assessments and household \nlistings  conducted  by  the  partner  NGO  (Appendix  4).  Pro-poor  targeting  will  be  an  important \naspect of the performance-based contracting. The poor will be provided free services, including \nfree  medicines.  A  performance  bonus  will  be  paid  to  the  partner  NGOs  for  their  demonstrated \nability \n(Appendix  5).  \nIn  addition,  utilization,  equity,  cost-efficiency,  quality,  and  health  impact  will  help  determine  the \nperformance  bonus.  For  the  nonpoor,  sliding  user  fees  will  be  charged  and  drugs  will  be  made \navailable at 10\u201320% lower than market price.  \n \nOutreach Services. Community-based health services will be provided in all partnership \n20. \nareas to ensure that the poor receive health services. The partnership area will be mapped and \ndivided  into  areas  containing  approximately  5,000  people  or  about  1,000  households.  Field \n\nrespond  effectively \n\nthe  poorest  and \n\ntheir  needs \n\nreach \n\nto \n\nto \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5  \n\nworkers will be assigned to an area, which they will visit every 2 months. They will weigh children, \nadvise  on  nutrition,  and    refer  the  seriously  malnourished  to  health  centers.  They  will  support \ndirectly  observed  treatment,  short-course  for  TB  and  other  PHC  initiatives,  inform  people  about \nfamily  planning,  provide  contraceptives,  and  facilitate  adoption  of  long-term  methods  for \ncontraception. They will identify pregnant women and help them prepare for delivery and care for \ntheir newborn children. \n \n\nb. \n\nBehavior Change Communication and Marketing16 \n\nThe  main  elements  of  the  behavior  change  communication  and  marketing  (BCCM) \n21. \nstrategy for the Project will be as follows: (i) branding of project service networks; (ii) innovative \nmarketing to maximize use of the Project, targeting providers and potential clients and patients; \n(iii)  community  mobilization  through  national  campaigns  and  direct  interventions  by  partner \nNGOs;  (iv)  raising  awareness  of  communicable  and  noncommunicable  disease  control;  and  \n(v)  increasing  knowledge  and  awareness  of  HIV/AIDS  and  STI  prevention  and  control.  These \ncomponents will focus on raising awareness among the poor of their rights to health care and the \nparticular health needs of women  and girls, and ensuring they know  free services are available \nfor the poor. The two subcomponents of BCCM will be (i) HIV/AIDS, STI and infectious disease \ncontrol,  and  (ii)  other  ESP-related  behavior  change.  Subcomponents  (i)  will  be  financed  by  the \nADB grant, and subcomponent (ii) by other financing. BCCM will be contracted out to a firm or an \ninstitution, which will work closely with the  project management unit (PMU), partner NGOs, and \nthe  city  corporations  and  municipalities  to  prepare  a  BCCM  strategy  with  short-  and  long-term \nimplementation plans that will be approved by the LGD and ADB.  \n \n\n2. \n\nUrban Primary Health Care Infrastructure and Environmental Health \n\na. \n\nUrban Primary Health Care infrastructure \n\n22. \nThe Project will construct 50 PHC and 14 CRHC centers, and upgrade 4 PHC centers to \nCRHC  centers.  The  Project  will  support  the  purchase  of  12  apartments  or  buildings  for  PHC \ncenters in Dhaka (Table 1).17 Construction will be completed within 3 years of loan effectiveness. \nUnder the overall guidance of the PMU, the city corporations and municipalities will implement the \ncivil  works.  A  design  and  construction  supervision  firm  will  be  hired  to  support  the  PMU.  Land \nacquisition  will  be  minimal  as  most  of  the  land  will  be  either  government-owned  or  donated.  \nThe PHC and CRHC centers will operate in rented buildings until the new facilities are available.  \n \n\nb. \n\nEnvironmental Health \n\nCommunity Toilets. The Project will support, on a pilot basis, the construction and initial \n23. \noperation  in  each  partnership  area  of  at  least  four  community  toilets  blocks  with  bathing  and \nurinal facilities. The toilet blocks will offer privacy to both men and women. These complexes will \nhave electricity and 24-hour water supply, and will be operated by local communities, which will \ncharge  nominal  user  fees.  The  partner  NGOs  will  mobilize  local  communities  and  ensure  that \nthey provide attendants 24 hours a day. The pay-and-use system will not burden the government \nbudget. The approach will be evaluated to ensure that it is sustainable and to ensure appropriate \ncoverage of the poor.  \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n16 Part  of  an  integrated,  multilevel,  interactive  process  with  communities  and  the  use  of  marketing  analysis  and \n\ntechniques to persuade people to take action.  \n\n17 Land  for  construction  of  health  facilities  in  Dhaka  is  scarce,  and  more  than  30  PHC  centers  could  not  be \nconstructed in Dhaka during Urban Primary Health Care Project (the first one) (UPHCP-I) due to scarcity of suitable \nland.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nTable 1: Urban Primary Health Care Infrastructure Proposed Under the Project \n\n \n \n \n \nCities/ Municipalities \n\nExpected to be \nconstructed in UPHCP-I\n\nProposed Infrastructure for the Project \n\nPHC \nCenters \n\nCRHC \nCenters \n\nPHC \nCenters \n\nCRHC \nCenters \n\nPurchase \nApartments/ \nBuildings \n\nUpgrade PHC \nto CRHC \nCenters \n\nDhaka \n\nChittagong \n\nKhulna \n\nRajshahi \n\nSylhet \n\nBarisal \n\n \n\nFive  Municipalities  \n \n\nTotal  \n\n39 \n\n40 \n\n26 \n\n14 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n119 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n8 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n10 \n\n7 \n\n25 \n\n50 \n\n6 \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n9 \n\n4 \n\n2 \n\n1 \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n1 \n\n5 \n\n12 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n3 \n\n1 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n4 \n\n14 \n\n12 \n\nCRHC = comprehensive reproductive health care, PHC = primary health care, UPHCP-I = Urban Primary Health Care \nProject (the first one). \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n24. \nCommunity-based  Solid  Waste  Disposal  Project.  The  Project  will  support  pilot \ncommunity  waste  management  efforts  to  reduce  the  amount  of  generated  waste,  to  separate \nwaste  of  different  types  for  recycling,  and  to  improve  waste  collection  systems  in  five  city \ncorporations (other than Dhaka) and five municipalities.18 Activities will cover: (i) organic waste or \ndigestible  waste  collection  and  treatment  in  a  jointly  managed  community  composting  facility,  \n(ii) resalable waste (for recycling) separation and temporary storage in households before being \nsold,  and  (iii)  general  non-usable  waste  collection  and  disposal  by  the  city  corporations  and \nmunicipalities.  \n \n25. \nimproved  clinical  waste \nmanagement  (CWM)  in  the  project  clinics.  At  the  city  corporation  and  municipality  levels,  \nthe  Project  will  help  city  corporations  and  municipalities  prepare  CWM  action  plans  and \nimplement them in accordance with MOHFW\u2019s action plan for CWM.  \n \n\nClinical  Waste  Management.  The  Project  will  support \n\n3. \n\nBuilding Capacity and Policy Support for Urban Primary Health Care \n\na. \n\nBuilding Capacity of City Corporations and Municipalities \n\n26. \nThe  Project  will  support  management  (planning,  finance,  budgeting,  monitoring,  and \nsupervision)  and  technical  capacity  building  in  LGD,  city  corporation  and  municipality  health \ndepartments,  and  partner  NGOs.  A  consultant  firm(s)  or  institution(s)  will  be  contracted  to \n(i) organize  training,  fellowships,  and  study  tours,  focusing  on  pro-poor  and  gender-sensitive \ntargeting and monitoring; and (ii) train health care providers in quality assurance and provision of \nsupervision.  The  firm(s)  or  institution(s)  will  identify  skill  gaps  in  management  and  training \ninstitutions  and  individuals  capable  of  providing  training,  and  will  prepare  an  overall  annual \ntraining  and  fellowship  and/or  study  tour  program  to  upgrade  the  management  and  technical \ncapacities  of  all  of  those  involved  in  management  and  provision  of  urban  PHC  in  the  Project.  \nThe annual training, fellowship, and study tour program will be approved by LGD and ADB before \nimplementation. The Project will support overseas  fellowships of 2\u20134-week courses for midlevel \nmanagers of city corporations, municipalities, and partner NGOs who are expected to be leaders \nin the future. The Project will support study tours for mayors, chairpersons, chief health officers, \nand other representatives of the LGD.

The  Project  will  provide  policy  support  through  research  assistance  and \npolicy  dialogue,  including  support  for:  (i)  the  drafting  of  an  urban  health  strategy;  (ii)  enhancing \ncoordination  between  MOHFW  and  LGD;  (iii)  better  pro-poor  targeting  and  monitoring,  gender \nequity,  and  adolescent  health  in  the  urban  PHC  context;  and  (iv)  a  greater  role  for  local \ngovernments in the enforcement of good practices for CWM.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProject Implementation and Operationally Relevant Research  \n\na. \n\n Project Implementation  \n\nimplementation  and  quality  assurance,  which  will \n\n28. \nThe  Project  will  provide  the  following  support  to  strengthen  project  implementation:  \n(i)  management  support,  (ii)  financial  management  and  performance  audit,  (iii)  project \nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system,  (iv)  construction  supervision,  and  (v) health \nmanagement  information  systems.  A  management  support  firm  will  provide  (i)  a  long-term \ninternational consultant, who will be the chief technical adviser; (ii) a long-term local consultant for \ninclude  access,  equity,  and \nproject \naccountability  aspects;  and  (iii)  20  person-months  of  international  and  150  person-months  of \nshort-term  local  consultants  covering  poverty  analysis,  equity,  quality  assurance,  nutrition, \ngender,  procurement,  and  contracting  of  NGOs,  etc.  (Supplementary  Appendix  C).  A  financial \nmanagement and performance audit firm will help the PMU, project implementation units (PIUs), \nand partner NGOs implement and manage a computer-based financial management system, and \nwill conduct concurrent performance audit.  \n \n29. \nA health management information system (HMIS) will be developed and implemented on \na build, operate, and transfer basis. Firms will develop an HMIS; test and implement it; train staff \nfrom LGD, city corporations, municipalities, and partner NGOs; and transfer operations to LGD by \nthe end of the fourth year. The HMIS component will include website development and integration \nof information management with the Internet. The web-based information systems will be used to \nenhance project transparency and accountability by widely sharing the information generated. \n \n\nb. \n\nOperationally Relevant Research \n\nThe Project will support eight operational research studies that will directly benefit urban \n30. \nPHC  provision  (Supplementary  Appendix  D).19  The  research  will  be  conducted  by  firms  or \nresearch institutions and completed within 3 years of loan effectivity. The findings will be used to \nimprove project implementation.  \n \nC. \n\nADF IX Grant for HIV/AIDS and Infectious Disease Control \n\n31. \nA $10-million grant will support various HIV/AIDS and infectious disease control activities \n(Appendix  6  sets  out  further  details  justifying  use  of  the  grant).  Under  component  1  described \n\n                                                 \n19  Studies  include:  (i)  effective  pro-poor  targeting;  (ii)  reducing  gender  inequalities;  (iii)  determining  effective  sexually \ntransmitted  infection  (STI)  and  HIV/AIDS  prevention  strategies  among  slum  dwellers  and  squatters,  (iv)  enhancing \nthe  cost-effectiveness  and  quality  of  the  partner  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs);  (v)  improve  coordination \nbetween  local  government  division (LGD)  and Ministry  of  Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) and  other relevant \nministries; (vi) impact of user fees on health service utilization; (vii) effective and transparent mechanisms, including \nvouchers, to provide free services to the poor; and (viii) a fiscal model for sustaining urban PHC. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nabove, partnership agreements will include two subcomponents fully funded by the grant. These \nare: (i) $2.5 million for operating 24 HIV/AIDS voluntary testing and counseling centers\u2014one for \neach  partnership  area;  and  (ii)  $5.0  million  for  STI  and  RTI  control.  Also  under  component  1, \nBCCM will include a subcomponent whereby the grant will provide $2.5 million for HIV/AIDS, STI, \nand infectious disease control. Monitoring and evaluation of the grant\u2019s effectiveness is integrated \ninto  the  overall  project  performance  monitoring  system.  The  progress  of  the  grant-funded \ncomponents will be reported in a separate section in the periodic reports of the LGD (Appendix \n6). Grant financing can be justified at the country and project levels.20 \n \nD. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n32. \n In South Asia, provision of PHC is ordinarily characterized by three features. First, PHC \nservices are mainly provided in rural areas. Second, the Ministry of Health is usually the ministry \nprimary responsible for service provision. Third, PHC is mainly funded and provided as a public \nservice by the government. The project features a design that uniquely contrasts with these three \naspects. First, like UPHCP-I, the project will cater to Bangladesh\u2019s growing urban population, and \nwould  expand  to  new  urban  areas.  Second,  LGD  in  the  MOLGRDC  is  the  project\u2019s  executing \nagency.  This  is  designed  to  ensure  decentralized  PHC  service  provision  through  greater \ninvolvement  of  city  corporations  and  municipalities.    With  such  decentralized  provision  of  public \nservices,  the  potential  exists  for  increased  accountability  of  providers  and  local  governments  to \nbeneficiaries  and  end-users.    Third,  the  project  design  envisages  provision  of  PHC  services  by \nprivate  providers  through  partnership  agreements\u2014contracting-out  principally  to  NGOs.    While \nthis special feature facilitates \u201cprivate provision of a public services\u201d, the design of the partnership \nagreements  is  performance-based  with  incentives  and  contractual  stipulations  that  enhance \nquality.    Additionally,  the  agreements  include  a  contractual  obligation  to  provide  30%  of  the \nservices to the poor. Specific criteria have been developed so that NGOs can identify who are the \n\u201curban  poor\u201d  and  to  ensure  standardization  of  service  provision  amongst  the  different  NGO \nproviders.    To  prevent  false  claims  for  services  once  identified,  the  urban  poor  will  be  provided \nentitlement cards, by which the poor will be able to access free PHC services from partners.   The \nproject  displays  a  specific  emphasis  on  refinements  that  will  ensure  smooth  and  effective \nimplementation. \n \nBecause  of  the  project\u2019s  complexity,  the  additional  risk  of  corruption  in  Bangladesh  has \n33. \nbeen recognized and will be addressed by a number of project specific design measures. These \ninclude assigning important roles in project implementation and monitoring to the private sector, \nlocal  governments,  community-based  organizations,  and  beneficiaries;  focusing  on  improving \nmanagement information systems and financial management; and strengthening information flow \nto stakeholders through outreach service. As well as these measures the government will engage \nan  independent  firm  for  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  and  an  independent \nperformance  auditor  to  review,  among  other  things,  timely  disbursement  to  NGOs.  It  will  also \nestablish a beneficiary grievance redress mechanism; and develop a good governance and anti-\ncorruption action plan. The government will report on the implementation of the action plan each \nquarter.  In  addition,  as  a  result  of  the  success  of  UPHCP-I,  and  ADB\u2019s  active  coordination  with \nother development partners, ADB has catalyzed the provision of additional resources from three \ndevelopment  partners.  Significant  grant  cofinance  from  the  Government  of  Sweden,  the \nGovernment  of  the  United  Kingdom  and  UNFPA  highlight  the  wider  acceptance  of  the  project \n\n                                                 \n20  The  Project  is  closely  aligned  with  Bangladesh\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy,  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s) \ncountry  strategy  and  program,  ADB\u2019s  Partnership  Agreement  on  Poverty  Reduction  with  the  Government  of \nBangladesh  (2000),  and  ADB\u2019s  commitment  to  poverty  reduction  and  assisting  developing  member  countries  to \nachieve the MDGs. More than half the project base costs address infectious disease and HIV/AIDS control. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9  \n\nmodel  for  provision  of  urban  PHC  in  Bangladesh.  The  benefits  of  this  cofinance  act  not  only  to \ncatalyze  the  financial  resources  from  these  development  partners,  but  also  to  leverage  their \nsector expertise. The project, based upon refinements of UPHCP-I, has significant potential as a \nprecedent  model  for  PHC  service  provision,  especially  in  contexts  where  government  provided \nPHC services are of less than optimal quality. \n \nE. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n34. \nThe  total  project  cost,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  taxes  and  duties,  \nis estimated at $90.0 million equivalent. Of this amount, $4.3 million equivalent, or 5% of the total \ncost,  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  and  $85.7  million  equivalent,  or  95%  of  the  total  cost,  \nis the local currency cost.

This will cover $4.3 million of the foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $35.7  million  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  indicative  financing \nplan  is  presented  in  Table  3.  The  Government  of  Sweden  through  the  Swedish  International \nDevelopment  Cooperation  Agency  will  provide  a  $5-million  grant,  and  the  Government  of  the \nUnited Kingdom through the Department for International Development will provide a $25-million \ngrant  to  be  administered  by  ADB.

The  term  of  the  proposed  loan  will  be  32  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The  interest  on  the  loan  will  be  capitalized  during  the \ngrace period.  \n \nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n37. \nThe  LGD  of  MOLGRDC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The  city  corporations  and  the \nmunicipalities  will  be  the  implementing  agencies  in  their  project  areas.  The  organizational  chart \nindicating  the  project  management  and  implementation  structure  is  set  forth  in  Appendix  8  and \nSupplementary  Appendix  E.  A  national  urban  primary  health  care  committee  (NUPHCC)  will  be \nchaired  by  the  LGD  minister.  The  committee  will  include  members  from  ministries  such  as \nMOHFW and mayors and chairmen of city corporations and municipalities covered by the Project. \nThe NUPHCC will meet at least twice a year and guide urban PHC, ensure greater involvement in \nand ownership of the Project by mayors of city corporations and chairmen of municipalities, and \nforge stronger links with relevant ministries. For project implementation, the apex body will be the \nnational project steering committee (NPSC), chaired by the LGD secretary, which will guide the \nPMU. The NPSC will meet at least four times a year during the first 2 years of operations, and at \nleast twice every year thereafter.  \n\n38. \nThe chief project coordinator will be a joint secretary-level officer of LGD or higher. He or \nshe will supervise a full-time project director, who will be acceptable to ADB and will be selected \nfrom senior civil servants. The project director will be at least a deputy-secretary-level officer and \nhave project management experience, preferably in the health sector. The deputy project director, \nadministration  and  finance,21  will  be  at  least  at  the  level  of  senior  assistant  secretary  officer  of \nLGD. The deputy project director, technical, will be a medical doctor with a postgraduate degree \nor diploma and be a member of staff of LGD or city corporation health department with more than \n5 years\u2019 experience in a similar project.  \n\n                                                 \n21 Based on a review of financial management capacity and previous experience, the project management unit (PMU) \nhas been strengthened in financial management by engaging a senior civil servant as deputy director, administration \nand finance, and a financial management and performance audit firm. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11  \n\n39. \nThe  city  corporation  or  municipality  PHC  coordination  committees  will  be  chaired  by  the \nmayor  or  chairman  or,  in  their  absence,  the  chief  executive  officer.  Before  loan  effectiveness, \nPIUs  will  be  constituted  in  Dhaka,  Chittagong,  Kulna,  and  Rajshahi.  A  ward  PHC  coordination \ncommittee  will  be  chaired  by  local  ward  commissioners  and  co-chaired  by  zonal  health  officers \n(where  available)  and  female  ward  commissioners,  with  a  membership  that  represents  all  local \nstakeholders, including informal settlers.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 6.5 years, from July 2005 to December 2011. During \n40. \nthe  first  6  months,  the  bidding  process  for  24  partnership  agreements  will  be  completed.  PHC \nservices will be provided through new partnership agreements from January 2006 in the existing \nfour city corporations and from July 2006 in the two new city corporations and five municipalities.  \nThe Project\u2019s long duration is justified for the following reasons: (i) short contracts lead to frequent \nchanges  in  providers,  which  might  not  be  in  the  clients\u2019  best  interests;  (ii)  rebidding  and \nmobilization  of  new  partner  NGOs  will  involve  management  costs  and  a  risk  of  disruption  of \nservice  provision;  and  (iii)  uncertainties  caused  by  short  contracts  may  dissuade  the  partner \nNGOs from proper investments and they may therefore compromise on quality. The disadvantage \nof  a  longer  contract  is  the  risk  of  being  stuck  with  nonperforming  partner  NGOs.  Adequate \nprovisions will be made to discourage poor performance and to revoke contracts when a partner \nNGO  falls  below  set  standards  or  is  in  breach  of  contract  terms  and  conditions.  An \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement of Goods and Services \n\na. \n\nCivil Works \n\n41. \nCivil works subprojects (consisting of the construction of 14 CRHC and 50 PHC centers, \nthe purchase of 12 apartments, and the upgrading of four PHC centers to CRHC centers) will be \nsmall ($100,000 to $500,000), and scattered over six city corporations and five municipalities, and \nunlikely to attract foreign bidders. The subprojects will therefore be awarded by local competitive \nbidding procedures as described in the Government\u2019s Public Procurement Regulations 2003, and \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Funds  to  purchase  apartments  and/or  land  will  be  from  the  Government\u2019s \ncontribution only. Civil works contracts below $100,000 will be permitted only case by case. The \nGovernment will submit, through the PMU, details of the number and scope of civil works for ADB \napproval  before  withdrawing  funds  for  civil  works  expenditure.  Construction  contracts  will  be \nrequired  to  contain  stated  compliance  with  labor  law  requirements,  and  to  bind  contractors  to \ncomply  with  applicable  labor  legislation,  including  that  on  child  labor.  In  Dhaka,  where  suitable \nland for further PHC centers will be difficult to obtain, LGD may consider and approve any request \nfrom the PMU to purchase a flat in a new apartment or building. It is expected that the design of \nthese  new  flats  or  buildings  can  be  modified  to  meet  requirements  for  PHC  or  CRHC  center \noperations.  \n\nb. \n\nEquipment and Materials \n\n42. \nVehicles,  computers,  equipment  (Supplementary  Appendix  F),  and  accessories  will  be \nprocured  through  international  competitive  bidding  for  packages  above  $500,000  and  by \ninternational  shopping  for  packages  below  $500,000,  financed  from  ADB  loan  and  cofinance \ngrant  funds  administered  by  ADB,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  LCB \nprocedures  may  also  be  used  for  packages  below  $500,000,  financed  from  ADB  loan  and \ncofinance grant funds administered by ADB, in accordance with Public Procurement Regulations \n2003, and acceptable to ADB. Packages less than equivalent of $50,000 but more than $10,000 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nmay be awarded by National Shopping procedures acceptable to ADB; and packages equivalent \nof $10,000 or less may be awarded by direct purchase procedures acceptable to ADB. To ensure \neconomy and efficiency, goods of similar nature will be grouped into packages under one or more \nbids. Apart from supplies directly provided from MOHFW and UNFPA, the partner NGOs will be \nresponsible for the purchase of all furniture, equipment, medicines, and other supplies necessary \nto meet the terms of their partnership agreements.  \n \n\nc. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nThe LGD will recruit consultants and consulting firms as per ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \n43. \nof  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  recruitment  of  local  consultants, \nwhich may include the Public Procurement Regulations, 2003. Consulting firms will be hired using \nquality- and cost-based selection. They will include: (i) a management and training support firm; \n(ii)  a  quality  assurance  training  and  supportive  supervision  firm,  (iii)  a  HMIS  development  and \nimplementation firm, (iv) a behavioral change communication and marketing firm, (v) a financial \nmanagement and performance audit firm,22 (vi) a project performance monitoring and evaluation \nfirm, and (vii) the design and supervisory engineering services of a construction firm (Appendix 10 \nand Supplementary Appendix C). The Management Support Firm, among others, will provide the \nservices  of  the  following  experts:  one  long-term  international  consultant  for  78  person-months; \none long-term national consultant for 78 person-months; two short-term international consultants \nfor a total of 20 person-months (HIV/AIDS specialist for 12 person-months, and HMIS specialist \nfor 8 person-months); and nine short-term national consultants for a total of 150 person-months \n(poverty  specialist  for  24  person-months,  institutional  development  specialist  for  24  person-\nmonths,  gender  specialist  for  12  person-months,  environment  specialist  for  6  person-months, \nresettlement  specialist  for  3  person-months,  procurement  specialist  for  36  person-months, \nHIV/AIDS  specialist  for  24  person-months,  nutrition  specialist  for  6  person-months,  and \nmanagement information specialist for 15 person-months). The detailed terms of reference for the \nfirms,  including  qualification  and  deployment  schedule  of  consultants  to  be  hired  through  the \nmanagement  firm,  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  At  midterm  appraisal,  the  needs  for \nadditional consultant support will be assessed.  \n \n\nd. \n\nPartnership Agreements \n\nPartnership  agreements  to  deliver  the  PHC  service  package  will  be  awarded  in \n44. \naccordance with competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB (Appendix 5). Bidders must \ndemonstrate  to  the  satisfaction  of  LGD  and  ADB  that  they  have  the  expertise  and resources  to \nprovide the PHC services. Preference will be given to NGOs with experience in providing urban \nPHC services in UPHCP-I or similar programs, and additional weight will be given to NGOs that \nprovide similar services in the specific partnership area. \n \n\n4. \n\nAdvance Action  \n\nLGD23  will  take  advance  actions  to  expedite  project  implementation,  particularly  by:  \n45. \n(i)  short-listing  firms  to  provide  consultancy  services;  (ii)  preparing  bid  documents  for  the \npartnership  agreements;  (iii)  extending  the  current  16  partner  NGO  contracts  in  four  city \ncorporations  by  1  year  (from  1  January  2005  to  31  December  2005)  following  procedures \nacceptable to ADB; and (iv) constituting and agreeing the terms of reference of NUPHCC, NPSC, \nand other committees involved in project implementation. These advance actions will apply only \n\n                                                 \n22 A  performance  audit  is  systematic  examination  of  management  systems  and  procedures  to  facilitate  economy, \n\nefficiency, and effectiveness in the use of resources and strengthening good governance. \n\n23 LGD has experience of UPHCP-I and is capable of taking advance actions. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13  \n\nuntil evaluation of bids; contract awards and signing of agreements will take place only after loan \neffectiveness.  The  Project  will  allow  the  services  of  the  current  partner  NGOs  to  continue  until \nDecember 2005, when the new contracts are expected to be operational. The development and \nfinalization  of  1-year  contract  extensions  will  follow  invitation  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nFunding for the first 6 months (January to June 2005) will come from savings from UPHCP-I, and \nfunding for the second 6 months (July to December 2005) will come from the Project, for which a \nseparate provision of $2 million will be made. ADB\u2019s concurrence with advance actions does not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n46.  Withdrawal  of  loan  proceeds  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  of  January  2001,  as  amended  periodically,  and  with  arrangements  between  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  Imprest  account  and  statement-of-expenditure  procedures  will  be  used. \nSeparate imprest accounts for the ADB loan and ADB grant will be established within 1 month of \nloan effectiveness in a reputable commercial bank acceptable to ADB. Separate imprest accounts \nwill be established for the grant from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency \n(Sida) and the grant from the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID) \nas and when they are executed. The PMU under LGD will manage the imprest account. ADB\u2019s \nstatement-of-expenditures procedures will be used to replenish and liquidate the imprest account \nfor  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $50,000  per  payment.  The  advance  to  the  imprest \naccount  will  be  limited  to  10%  of  the  loan  or  the  forecast  expenditure  for  the  next  6  months, \nwhichever is lower. The interest of the loan will be capitalized.  \n\nFund Flow. The advance from the imprest account will be deposited in a bank account to \n47. \nbe maintained in a reputable commercial bank and used for ADB's portion of eligible costs of the \nProject. The Government counterpart contribution will be deposited in a separate bank account. \nThe  PMU  will  disburse  most  project  expenditures  from  these  accounts.  In  addition,  11  second-\ngeneration imprest accounts (SGIAs) for the ADB loan account only will be opened, one in each \nPIU  (six  city  corporations  and  five  municipalities)  for  disbursement  of  funds  to  pay  for  ADB\u2019s \nportion of the eligible project costs. Disbursement will be delegated to the PIUs for ADB\u2019s share of \ncivil works expenditures. (Funds routed through the 11 SGIAs will be only for the ADB-funded civil \nworks.)  The  PIUs  will  effect  Government  counterpart  disbursements    through  a  separate  bank \naccount.  The  SGIAs  are  expected  to  disburse  $2  million  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  PMU  will \ndisburse the ADB, Sida, and DFID grants, so they will not need SGIAs.  \n\n \n\n6. \n\nAccounts and Auditing \n\n48. \nThe Government, acting through the LGD, will maintain records and accounts to identify \ngoods and services financed by loan proceeds. It will ensure city corporations and municipalities \nkeep  similar  records.  LGD  will  ensure  that  accounts  and  financial  statements  are  audited \nannually, in accordance with sound accounting principles, by independent auditors acceptable to \nADB.  It  will  furnish  to  ADB,  not  later  than  6  months  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year,  certified \ncopies  of  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements,  and  the  report  of  the  auditor  on  these.  \nAll  the  imprest  accounts  and  statement  of  expenditure  records  will  be  audited  annually  and  a \nseparate audit opinion will be provided for each. \n \n\n7. \n\nReporting \n\n49. \nThe  PMU  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project  implementation  and  submit \nthem  to  ADB  and  LGD  within  20  days  of  the  end  of  the  applicable  period.  The  reports  will  be \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nprepared in a format acceptable to ADB and other cofinancers and will include, among others, the \nfollowing:  (i)  project  progress  and  population  served  (disaggregated  by  poverty  and  gender), \nagainst  established  targets,  including  aspects  of  quality;  (ii)  delays  and  problems  encountered, \nand  actions  to  resolve  them;  (iii)  compliance  with  loan  covenants;  (iv)  proposed  program  of \nactivities to be undertaken during the next 6 months; (v) expected progress during the succeeding \nperiod;  and  (vi)  maintenance  and  repair  of  health  facilities.  Within  6  months  of  the  Project\u2019s \nphysical completion, the Government will prepare and submit to ADB and other external funding \nagencies a project completion report, including costs and compliance with loan covenants. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n50. \nThe Government, ADB, and other cofinancers will jointly review the Project\u2019s progress at \nleast twice a year. The representatives of the health consortium with an interest in urban PHC will \nbe  invited  to  join  the  reviews.  Efforts  will  be  made  to  ensure  the  project  review  coincides  with \nMOHFW\u2019s  health,  nutrition,  and  population  sector  program  review.  The  Government,  ADB,  and \nother cofinancers will jointly review the Project in the middle of its third year. This midterm review \nwill:  (i)  examine  the  scope,  design,  implementation  arrangements,  and  other  relevant  issues  in \nlight of the Government\u2019s development strategies and the policy framework; (ii) examine progress \nin  achieving  the  Project\u2019s  measurable  objectives,  with  emphasis  on  catering  to  the  urban  poor, \nespecially women and girls; (iii) identify changes since appraisal in issues related to urban PHC \nfuture  project \nand  resource  management  and  allocation,  and  assess \nimplementation  and  sustainability;  (iv)  assess  implementation  performance  against  appropriate \nprojections;  (v)  review  and  establish  compliance  with  various  loan  covenants;  (vi)  identify \nproblems  and  constraints;  and  (vii)  recommend  corrective  action.  The  midterm  review  will \nevaluate  the  use  and  projected  use  of  funds,  and,  if  necessary,  expand  the  Project  to  new \nmunicipalities, or deepen services within existing project areas, depending on projected savings.  \n \n51. \nThe  midterm  review  may  consider  further  involvement  of  ADB  in  urban  PHC.  Such \ninvolvement will depend on LGD achieving predetermined benchmarks of performance, including \ntimely  contracting-out  of  PHC  services  to  NGOs,  sound  implementation,  targeting  the  poor \n(especially women and girls), and achieving good governance. Further ADB and external funding \nagencies support to urban PHC delivery will depend on LGD\u2019s performance.  \n \n\nimpact  on \n\ntheir \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n52. \nThe  LGD  and  PMU  will  establish  a  comprehensive  project  performance  monitoring  and \nevaluation  system  (PPMES)  acceptable  to  ADB  and  other  cofinancers.  The  PPMES  will:  (i) \nassess  technical  performance;  (ii)  evaluate  delivery  of  planned  activities;  (iii)  measure  project \nimpacts;  (iv)  measure  social  and  economic  benefits  with  a  focus  on  the  poor,  women,  and \nadolescents; and (v) monitor achievements of health-related MDGs. PPMES indicators will serve \nas  a  basis  for  reports  on  project  implementation,  and  will  cover  fiscal  impact,  improved  use  of \nresources, changes in access to services (particularly among the poor), improved service quality, \ncost  savings  from  rationalization,  client  satisfaction,  and  MDG  progress  status.  Baseline  values \nfor  these  indicators  will  be  estimated  from  participatory  assessments  and  from  household  and \nhealth  facility  surveys.  The  midterm  and  final  values  of  the  indicators  will  be  estimated  from \nsimilar participatory assessments and from household and health facility surveys. The indicators \nwill  be  disaggregated  by  socioeconomic  status  and  gender  of  the  beneficiaries  to  assess  the \nimpact  in  reducing  inequities.  A  PPMES  firm  will  be  engaged  to  conduct  participatory \nassessments  and  household  and  health  facility  surveys.  A  quality  assurance  firm  will  be \nresponsible  for  monitoring  and  assessing  the  technical  performance  of  the  partner  NGOs \n(Supplementary Appendix C).  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15  \n\n \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nImproved Health Status. The Project will improve the health status of people living in the \n53. \nsix  city  corporations  and  five  municipal  towns  by  providing  an  essential  package  of  high-impact \nservices. By reducing child and maternal mortality, the Project will help Bangladesh achieve the \nhealth-related MDGs. \n \n54. \nImproved  Equity  and  Efficiency  in  the  Health  Sector.  The  Project  will  improve  the \nefficiency of urban health care services by: (i) improving the spatial distribution of health centers, \ne.g.,  PHC  and  CRHC  centers,  and  mini-clinics,  in  accordance  with  population  density  and \ngeographical factors; (ii) supporting cost-effective interventions to reduce mortality and morbidity; \n(iii)  enabling  least-cost  private  sector  participation  in  the  provision  of  preventive  and  promotive \nhealth  care  services  through  partnership  agreements;  (iv)  allowing  appropriate  user  fees;  \n(v)  improving  the  monitoring  and  supervision  system;  and  (vi)  concentrating  on  the  provision  of \nhealth  services  that  will  produce  the  greatest  public  good  to  use  scarce  government  resources \nmore efficiently. Women and children will constitute more than 75% of all project beneficiaries.24 \n\n55. \nImproved  Management  Capacity.  The  Project  will  build  the  management  capacity  of \nhealth  departments  in  the  six  city  corporations  and  five  municipalities  so  they  can  effectively \ndeliver  urban  PHC  services  by:  (i)  providing  training  in  different  management  techniques;  \n(ii)  developing  tools  so  the  urban  health  system  can  be  supervised  effectively,  including  HMIS; \nand  (iii)  building  capacity  of  health  departments  of  the  city  corporations  and  municipalities  for \nfinancial management and analysis so cost-efficiencies can be achieved. \n\n56. \nEconomic  Gains.  The  Project  will  provide  three  types  of  economic  benefits:  (i)  health \nimprovements that lead to better productivity and learning outcomes at school, (ii) a reduction in \ndays lost due to sickness or health care, and (iii) savings in out-of-pocket expenditures on health \ncare because of better and more efficient health services (Appendix 11). \n \nB. \n\nRisks \n\n57. \nDelays  in  Implementation.  UPHCP-I  was  delayed  by  2  years  for  various  reasons \n(Appendix 3). Delays in contracting-out of services to NGOs may also jeopardize implementation \nof this Project. The Project could be held up by challenging procedures, including bid preparation, \nattracting  effective  NGOs,  the  need  for  transparent  evaluation,  and  issuing  contracts.  However, \nthese  risks  should  be  reduced  because  the  PIU  of  UPHCP-I  is  fully  functional  and  can  help \ncontract partner NGOs in advance, procedures that were tested during UPHCP-I will help reduce \nthe preparation time for contracting, and coordination between MOHFW and LGD is better than \nduring the early stages of UPHCP-I. \n \n58. \nRisks  in  Partnership  Agreements.  Partnership  agreements  have  both  procedural  and \nimplementation  risks.  Procedural  risks  include  the  possibility  that  the  bidding  process  to  select \neffective NGOs at the most competitive rates will not be transparent and that a contract obligating \nNGOs  to  implement  the  partnership  agreement,  and  especially  to  target  the  poor,  will  not  be \nexecuted.  The  implementation  risks  are  significant:  NGOs  may  not  be  paid  on  time  or  properly \nsupervised  to  ensure  they  guarantee  access  to  high-quality  services,  especially  for  the  poor. \n\n                                                 \n24 Ninety percent of project  services will be based on the essential service package (ESP). ESP\u2019s predominant focus is \nmaternal and child health. Under UPHCP-I, more than 75% of the beneficiaries were women and children, and more \nthan 50% female. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nCorruption  and  Governance.  Corruption \n\nInvolvement of city corporations and municipalities will improve local participation in the Project, \nbut  may  also  mean  increased  local  pressure  on  NGOs  and  the  Project.  Lessons  learned  in \nUPHCP-I that may help reduce these potential risks include the following: city corporations and \nmunicipalities should be involved in the Project, a national PHC committee should be constituted, \nan  independent  PPMES  firm  should  be  engaged,  consultant  support  should  be  provided  to  the \nPMU,  tender  documents  should  be  reviewed  carefully  by  ADB  and  the  Government,  and  the \nProject should build on procedures that were successful under UPHCP-I. \n \n59.  Weak  Pro-Poor  Targeting.  For  a  variety  of  reasons  related  to  project  design,  pro-poor \ntargeting in UPHCP-I was not optimal (Appendix 3). This could be a risk for the Project. Without \nadequate  disincentives,  partner  NGOs  may  not  target  the  poor  enough.  Safeguards  are \nproposed, including contractually obligating NGOs to provide at least 30% of their services to the \npoor.  The  bidding  process  will  ensure  adequate  medicines  are  provided  and  that  these  will  be \nfree  to  the  poor.  Disincentives  for  noncompliance,  including  termination  of  the  contract,  will  be \nbuilt into the contracts. \n \n60. \nthe  project \nimplementation  is  complex.  However,  measures  to  reduce  the  risk  of  corruption  and  improve \ngovernance have been included in the project design. These include: (i) assigning important roles \nin  project  implementation  and  monitoring  to  the  private  sector,  local  governments,  community-\nbased  organizations,  and  beneficiaries;  (ii)  improving  management  information  systems  and \nfinancial  management,  including  by  requiring  financial  audits  to  be  provided  within  6  months  of \nfinancial year end; (iii) enhancing the free flow of information to all stakeholders; (iv) performance-\nbased  contracting,  including  incentives  (a  performance  bonus)  for  demonstrated  performance \nability; (v) engaging an independent PPMES firm and instituting a beneficiary grievance redress \nmechanism; (vi) review through performance audit of the timely disbursements to partner NGOs; \nand  (vii)  development  of  a  good  governance  and  anti-corruption  action  plan  and  quarterly \nreporting on the action plan. \n \nFinancial  Sustainability.  The  Government  needs  to  add  at  least  $11.1  million  to  its \n61. \ncurrent annual expenditure to sustain urban PHC in 2012-2013 and $11.7 million per year more in \nsubsequent  years  (Appendix  11).  The  Project\u2019s  benefits  are  unlikely  to  be  sustainable  after \ncompletion  unless  an  appropriate  fiscal  model  is  in  place.  The  Project  will  help  LGD  explore \nalternative models, and the Government has given an assurance that one will be selected within \ntwo years of loan effectiveness to ensure the Project is financially sustainable after its completion. \n \nC. \n\nis  a  risk,  partly  because \n\nEnvironmental Issues  \n\n62. \nThis  is  a  category-B  project.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  (Supplementary \nAppendix G) was undertaken, and the summary IEE is in Appendix 12. The IEE shows that the \nProject\u2019s environmental benefits will be substantial, resulting from improved environmental health \nthrough the expansion of PHC, particularly to the poor. It also shows that the potential adverse \nimpacts  are  not  significant,  localized,  and  can  be  mitigated.  As  the  location  and  design  of  the \nPHC  and  CRHC  centers  will  take  place  during  project  implementation,  an  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  (Supplementary  Appendix  H)  will  be  developed  to  guide \nenvironmental  screening  and  assessment  and  to  facilitate  compliance  with  the  environmental \nrequirements of the Government and ADB. \n \nD. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n63. \nConstruction of health facilities and community latrines will require only 3 hectares. Most \nconstruction  will  occur  on  either  government  land  or  voluntarily  donated  land,  arranged  by  the \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17  \n\ngovernment.  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  will  be  followed.  The  PMU  will  use  the \nresettlement framework in Appendix 13 to prepare a resettlement plan, which will be submitted to \nADB  for  approval.  A  short  resettlement  plan  prepared  for  the  six  city  corporations  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix I. \n \nE. \n\nSocial Measures \n\n64. \nParticipation. During project preparation, discussions were held with beneficiaries, health \nstaff, and officials through field studies, meetings, and workshops.  These provided information on \nhealth  service  availability,  health-seeking  behaviors,  and  financing  during  disease  episodes. \nDuring implementation the beneficiaries will provide advice on health services, health promotion \nactivities,  and  access  to  the  health  services  for  the  poor.  They  will  also  be  consulted  through \nfocus group discussions during project evaluation (Appendix 14). \n \n65. \nSocial Assessment. More than 50% of the project population is from four main groups:  \n(i)  slum  dwellers  living  legally  in  slums;  (ii)  squatters  living  illegally  on  land  owned  by  others; \n(iii) floating populations with no fixed residence; and (iv) other urban poor living throughout urban \nareas, mixed with the nonpoor. The Project will target all the four groups through mini- or satellite \nclinics, outreach activities, and domiciliary services. Both demand- and supply-side interventions \nwill  be  used  to  target  the  poor.  Large  slums  will  have  mini-clinics,  which  will  be  open  in  the \nevening to maximize their use by the poor. \n \n66. \nindigenous population.  \n \n67. \nGender. More than 75% of the project beneficiaries will be women and children, as 90% \nof the services are based on the essential services package, which focuses mainly on maternal \nand child health. Women will comprise at least 50% of the Project\u2019s health providers and at least \n30%  of  project  management  staff.  The  PPMES  will  conduct  a  gender-disaggregated  review  of \noutputs and outcomes to ensure gender equity. \n \n68. \nPoverty  Reduction.  At  least  30%  of  all  project  services  will  target  the  poor  through \nperformance-based  contracting  and  behavior  change  communication  activities.  All  the  poor \nhouseholds in the partnership agreement areas will be identified, the list will be updated annually \n(Appendix 4), and entitlement cards for free health services will be issued to these households. \nPHC service use, outputs, and outcomes of the Project among poor households will be monitored \nand evaluated through a poverty-disaggregated PPMES. \n\nIndigenous  People.  None  of  the  6  city  corporations  or  the  5  municipalities  has  a  large \n\n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  following  will  be  required  from  the  LGD,  \n\n69. \ncity corporations, and municipalities, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government of Bangladesh has given the \n\n70. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n\nContinuity between UPHCP-I and the Project. The Government shall ensure the \ncontinuity of the implementation of urban PHC services between the completion of \nUPHCP-I and the beginning of the Project.   \n\nFiscal  Model  for  Urban  PHC  Provision.  Within  2  years  of  the  effective  date,  \nthe  Government  shall  cause  LGD  to:  (a)  review  and  consider  possible  fiscal \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nmodels to finance the recurrent costs for the provision of urban PHC; (b) based on \nthe  results  of  its  review,  develop  a  fiscal  model  to  cover  the  recurrent  costs  of \nproviding  urban  PHC  for  the  urban  poor  by  city  corporations  and  municipalities \nafter the closing date; (c) issue a policy statement that sets out the most feasible \nfiscal model to cover the recurrent costs of providing urban PHC to the poor by city \ncorporations  and  municipalities  after  the  closing  date  that  is  endorsed  by  the \nMinistry  of  Finance  and  the  Planning  Commission;  and  (d)  incorporate  to  the \nsatisfaction  of  ADB,  revenue  and  development  budgets  of \nto \noperationalize the fiscal model by the closing date.  \n\nthe  LGD \n\nUser Fees Retention. Within 6 months of the effective date, the Government shall \nprepare  and  issue  a  government  order  that  shall  ensure  implementation  of  the \nfollowing  specifications  on  user  fees:  (a)  an  objective,  transparent,  and  verifiable \nmechanism  or  formula  for  establishing  user  fees;  (b)  the  entitlement  of  each  city \ncorporation, municipality, and partner NGO to retain a proportion of user fees; (c) \nthe proportion of user fees that may be retained by city corporation, municipalities, \nand partner NGOs; (d) the requirement for each city corporation and municipality \nto  establish  an  urban  PHC  sustainability  fund,  and  to  deposit  the  proceeds  of  all \nuser  fees  into  such  urban  PHC  sustainability  fund;  (e)  the  permissible  uses  and \npurposes  of  such  retained  user  fees,  which  shall  primarily  involve  targeted  PHC \nservices  for  the  poor,  and  women  and  children;  and  (f)  the  condition  that  no  city \ncorporation  or  municipality  may  apply  any  user  fees  deposited  in  the  urban  PHC \nsustainability  fund  for  any  purpose,  unless  such  city  corporation  or  municipality \nmakes  a  financial  contribution  from  its  own  revenue  equivalent  to  the  amount  of \nuser fees to be applied to such purpose. \n\nGood  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Measures.  The  PMU  and  the  LGD  will \ntake concrete proactive steps to ensure good governance and prevent corruption \nby, among other things, preparing an action plan to implement the measures listed \nin Appendix 15, implementing such action plan, and preparing quarterly reports of \nthe measures taken in a form and manner satisfactory to ADB.  \n\nEnvironment.  LGD  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  location,  design, \nconstruction,  rehabilitation,  and  operation  of  health  facilities  will  follow  all \napplicable  laws,  MOHFW\u2019s  action  plan  for  CWM,  ADB's  environmental  policies, \nand  the  requirements  specified  in  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework  (Supplementary  Appendix  H)  and  IEE  (Supplementary  Appendix  G). \nEach  city  corporation  and  municipality  will  prepare  a  CWM  plan  for  approval  by \nLGD. Training will be provided to relevant medical staff in CWM, including in waste \nseparation and equipment operation. The Government will also ensure that the city \ncorporations and municipalities will have sufficient budget to operate and maintain \nthe CWM plan. For all major civil works, the Government will ensure that mitigation \nmeasures relating to environment are incorporated into the project. \n\n(vi) \n\nGender  Strategy.  LGD  shall  ensure  and  shall  cause  each  city  corporation  and \nmunicipality  to  ensure  that  the  gender  action  plan  agreed  on  between  LGD  and \nADB  is  implemented  in  accordance  with  its  terms,  and  that  implementation  has \ncommenced no later than 3 months after the effective date.  \n\n \n(vii)  Complaint  Investigation  and  Resolution  Mechanism.  Within  3  months  of  the \neffective  date,  LGD  will  establish  a  complaint  investigation  and  resolution \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19  \n\n \n(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\n \n(xi) \n\nmechanism  within  LGD.  The  complaint  investigation  and  resolution  mechanism \nshall be responsible for: (a) reviewing and addressing complaints from end users, \nbeneficiaries, and other stakeholders of the Project, in relation to either the Project, \nany of the service providers, or any person responsible for carrying out any aspect \nof  the  Project;  and  (b)  establishing  the  threshold  criteria  and  procedures  for \nhandling  such  complaints,  for  proactively  and  constructively  responding  to  them, \nand  for  providing  the  public  with  notice  of  such  mechanism,  including  publishing \nredress procedures on the website and other effective dissemination means. Such \ncriteria and procedures shall be subject to ADB\u2019s approval.  \n\n \n(viii)  Resettlement.  LGD  and \n\nland  acquisition  and \nthe  PMU  will  ensure \nresettlement activities are implemented in accordance with all applicable laws and \nregulations,  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement,  as  per  the  resettlement \nframework  (Appendix  13),  and  resettlement  plan  (Supplementary  Appendix  I).  \nAll subproject resettlement plans will be prepared, disclosed to people affected by \nthe  Project,  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review.  All  compensations  and  entitlement \npayments shall be made prior to the relocation of any affected people.  \n\nthat \n\nSubproject Approval Process and Selection. All subprojects shall comply with \nADB\u2019s policies and satisfy ADB procedures for subproject preparation with respect \nto technical, operational, economic, and other requirements of ADB. \n\nCoordination  with  MOHFW.  LGD  shall  sufficiently  coordinate  the  Project  with \nMOHFW by ensuring that representatives of MOHFW regularly attend meetings of \nthe  national  urban  primary  health  care  committee,  the  national  project  steering \ncommittee,  and  each  respective  city  corporation  or  municipality  primary  health \ncare coordination committee.  \n\nHIV/AIDS.  LGD  shall  ensure  that  HIV/AIDS  training  and  educational  activities, \nparticularly  those  protecting  women  and  girls,  are  mainstreamed  throughout \nproject  activities.  LGD  shall:  (a)  provide  training  in  HIV/AIDS  awareness  building \nand  HIV/AIDS  prevention  planning  to  staff  of  the  PMU,  each  PIU,  and  each \npartner,  and  to  construction  workers  engaged  in  civil  works  on  the  Project;  \n(b) integrate HIV/AIDS issues into training activities for health care providers in the \nProject;  and  (c)  integrate  HIV/AIDS  issues  into  behavior  communication  change \nand marketing activities supported by the Project.  \n\n \n(xii)   Disbursements and Performance Audit. LGD shall ensure that disbursements to \nbe made to each partner NGO will be made timely in accordance with the terms of \nthe  relevant  partnership  agreement.  Within  6  months  of  the  effective  date  LGD \nshall  appoint  an  independent  external  performance  auditor  who  shall  conduct  a \nquarterly  review  of  all  disbursements  made  by  the  PMU  and  each  PIU  to  the \npartner NGOs, and shall evaluate the extent to which timely disbursements were \nmade  in  accordance  with  the  respective  partnership  agreements.  LGD  shall \ninclude  a  summary  of  each  such  quarterly  performance  audit  as  a  component  of \neach quarterly progress report submitted to ADB and the national project steering \ncommittee.  \n\n(xiii)  Cofinancing.  Except  as  otherwise  agreed  by  ADB,  within  3  months  of  the \nEffective Date, the Government shall ensure the execution and delivery of each of \nthe  Sida  Grant  Agreement,  the  UNFPA  Grant  Agreement,  and  the  DFID  Grant \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nAgreement on behalf of the Government will have been duly authorized or ratified \nby  all  necessary  governmental  action;  and  the  Sida  Grant  Agreement,  and  the \nDFID  Grant  Agreement  will  have  been  duly  executed  and  delivered  on  behalf  of \nthe  Government  and  will  have  become  legally  binding  upon  the  Government  in \naccordance with its terms. \n\n \n\nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n71. \nThe following will be the conditions for loan effectiveness: (i) establishment of a national \nurban primary health care committee and national project steering committee; (ii) establishment \nof a fully functional PMU and PIUs in the four  city corporations (Dhaka, Chittagong, Kulna, and \nRajshahi);  (iii)  execution  and  delivery  of  a  project  agreement  by  each  city  corporation  and \nmunicipality included in the Project;

Urban Bangladesh can be divided into four broad categories. In the first \ncategory are the two largest city corporations\u2014Dhaka and Chittagong\u2014with more than 1 million \npeople. The remaining four city corporations\u2014Khulna, Rajshahi, Sylhet, and Barisal\u2014and large \nmunicipalities  (mostly  old  district  headquarters)  are  in  the  second  category,  with  an  average \npopulation  of  100,000.  The  third  category  contains  municipalities  with a population  of  35,000\u2013\n80,000.  Included  in  the  fourth  category  are  small  municipalities  (fewer  than  35,000  people). \nSome urban areas in the fourth category have Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) \nhealth and family welfare centers.  \n \n\nFigure A2: Dhaka will be the Fourth Largest City in the World by 2015 \n\n \nAccording to United Nations (UN) statistics,  Dhaka is  one  of the fastest  growing cities in the  world. By  2015, \nDhaka\u2019s population is expected to be 22 million, which will make it the fourth largest city in the world, next only \nto Tokyo, Mumbai, and Lagos. \n \n\n1975\n\n2000\n\n2015\n\no\ny\nk\no\nT\n\ni\n\na\nb\nm\nu\nM\n\ns\no\ng\na\nL\n\na\nk\na\nh\nD\n\ni\n\nh\nc\na\nr\na\nK\n\nl\n\no\nu\na\nP\no\na\nS\n\n \n\ny\nt\ni\n\n \n\nC\no\nc\nx\ne\nM\n\ni\n\nk\nr\no\nY\nw\ne\nN\n\n \n\na\n\nt\nr\na\nk\na\nJ\n\na\n\nt\n\nl\n\na\nk\no\nK\n\ni\n\nl\n\nh\ne\nD\n\no\nr\nt\n\ne\nM\n\na\n\nl\ni\n\nn\na\nM\n\ni\n\na\nh\ng\nn\na\nh\nS\n\n \n\n \n\n \nGrowing  Urban  Population.  According  to  the  2001  census,  Bangladesh  has  a \n2. \npopulation  of  132  million,  of  which  approximately  23%  (or  31  million)  live  in  urban  areas, \nincluding six city corporations and 282 municipalities. The urban population is increasing by 6% \nper  annum  from  rural  to  urban  migration  and  because  subdistrict  headquarters  are  being \ndeclared  municipalities.  By  2010,  the  urban  population  is  expected  to  be  a  third  of  the  total \npopulation  and  is  set  to  rise  to  50  million  by  2030,  and  by  2015  Dhaka  is  expected  to  be  the \nfourth  largest  city  in  the  world  (Figure  A2).  About  25%  of  the  urban  population  is  very  poor \n(consuming fewer than 1,805 kilocalories per day) and lives mostly in slums and squatter areas. \nOf the urban poor in Dhaka, 48% live in slums while the rest live on the streets or at their work \nsites. Studies reveal that 20% of Dhaka\u2019s population lives in slums. \n \n\n \n\ns\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nM\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25\n\nType of Health Service Providers  \n\nUrban Health and Vulnerable Population \n\n \nB. \n \n3. \nHealth Status. Child morbidity and mortality are highest in urban slums mainly because \nof  poor  sanitation  and  nutrition,  which  decrease  immunity  and  resistance;  crowding,  which \nfacilitates disease transmission; poverty, which prevents or delays treatment; lack of affordable \nprimary health care (PHC); and lack of a social safety network.  \n \nVulnerable  Urban  Populations.  The  different  types  of  vulnerable  urban  populations \n4. \ninclude  people  living  in  slums;  households  headed  by  females;  floating  and  homeless  people; \nstreet  children;  victims  of  violence;  commercial  sex  workers;  men  who  have  sex  with  men; \ntransgender  people;  rickshaw  pullers;  truck  drivers;  and  industry  workers  (such  as  female \ngarment factory workers, port workers, etc.). \n \nC. \n \nNongovernment  Organizations  (NGOs).  Contracted  NGOs  financially  supported  by \n5. \nthe  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  and  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB)  have  been  the  chief  providers  of  publicly  financed  PHC  service  delivery  in  urban \nBangladesh since 1997.  \n \n6. \nPublic Sector. The municipalities and city corporations have a few health facilities and \nclinics, mostly focusing on curative health care. Chittagong is the exception and has the largest \nnetwork of urban health care facilities funded by city corporations. Other health facilities include \nmedical college hospitals, district hospitals, mother and child welfare centers, sub-district health \ncomplexes, city corporation and municipal health facilities, railway, police, military hospitals and \nclinics, and other clinics at work places. Although the list is long, the number and coverage of \nthese  facilities  are  not  substantial  and  the  national  government\u2019s  essential  service  package \n(ESP) in urban areas has primarily focused on immunization activities.  \n \n7. \n Commercial Sector. The commercial sector plays an important role in providing urban \nhealth  care,  mainly  through  graduate  private  practitioners,  pharmacies,  and  private  clinics. \nOther  private  health  care  providers  include  private  hospitals  (including  private  medical  college \nhospitals)  and  nongraduate  private  practitioners  (including  paramedics,  midwives,  nurses, \ncharlatans, traditional birth attendants and homeopaths). Social marketing companies distribute \ntemporary family planning methods through commercial channels.  \n \nD. \n \n8. \nThe range of publicly financed primary health facilities in urban areas has always been \nmodest at best and nil at worst in South Asia. Bangladesh was no exception until a few years \nago. While most of the country\u2019s tertiary care infrastructure is in the main cities, there are just \n90\u201395  mother  and  child  welfare  centers  and  35\u201340  urban  dispensaries  focusing  entirely  on \nprimary  care.  By  contrast,  rural  areas  have  almost  6,000  primary  care  service  delivery  points. \nUSAID and  ADB each have large NGO-based urban health projects designed to fill the urban \nvacuum in noncommercial health care. The USAID project started in 1997 and the ADB project \nin 1999.  The USAID project is under MOHFW, and the ADB project under the Ministry of Local \nGovernment,  Rural  Development,  and  Cooperatives  (MOLGRDC).  They  remain  the  two  main \ncontributors to urban health outside the commercial sector.  \n \n \n\nUrban Primary Health Care \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n        Appendix 2 \n\nUrban Health-Related Policy Environment and Coordination \n\nE. \n \n9. \nLocal  Governments  and  Urban  Primary  Health  Care.  The  Municipal  Administration \nOrdinance  of  1960,  Pourashava  Ordinance  of  1977,  and  City  Corporation  Ordinance  of  1983 \nassigned responsibility for provision of preventive health care and limited curative care in urban \nareas  to  the  city  corporations  and  municipalities.  MOHFW  has  retained  responsibility  for \ndefining  health  policies,  strategies,  and  technical  standards,  and  for  distributing  vaccines  and \nfamily planning items. Municipal governments normally view \u201curban health\u201d services as limited \nto  immunization  and  water  and  sanitation  (i.e.,  environmental  health)  concerns.  Most \nmunicipalities  have  an  officer  in  charge  of  these  functions;  some  municipalities  also  have  a \nqualified  municipal  medical  officer  in  the  same  department  who  provides  closer  oversight  of \nmedical issues, particularly the expanded program on immunization.  \n \n10. \nCoordination.  The  level  of  coordination  and  cooperation  between  MOHFW  and  the \nLocal Government Division of MOLGRDC\u2014which oversees municipalities and their functions\u2014\nvaries widely. The current approach to urban health was not systematically planned but evolved \nand  is  characterized  by  blurred  responsibilities  and  a  fragmented  structure.  It  has  no \noverarching urban health strategy or clear definitions of \u201curban area\u201d or \u201durban health.\u201d  \n \n11. \nHealth,  Nutrition,  and  Population  Sector  Program  and  Urban  Health.  \nThe conceptual framework for MOHFW\u2019s new program has been developed and will eventually \nlead  to  detailed  plans  for  the  next  6  years  in  the  health  sector.  An  urban  component  is  being \ncontemplated for the first time (the earlier Health and Population Sector Program focused only \non  rural  health).  The  new  program\u2019s  conceptual  framework  indicates  that  the  Government  will \nconsider expanding the role of contracted NGOs in urban areas.  \n \n12. \nRole  of  Government.  MOHFW  and  MOLGRDC  are  not  central  to  service  delivery  in \nurban areas. It would be too costly and time-consuming to contemplate significantly building up \nthe  Government  role  in  service  delivery.  However,  the  Government  is  critical  to  providing \noptions  for  PHC  for  the  urban  poor.  The  Government  could  build  a  publicly  subsidized  urban \nPHC  network  with  the  many  existing  NGOs  and  commercial  players.  The  models  pioneered \nunder  the  first  Urban  Primary  Health  Care  Project,  where  publicly  subsidized  urban  PHC  was \nprovided  by  contracting-out  services  to  NGOs,  can  be  scaled  up  to  increase  the  depth  of \ncoverage  (reach  more  poor  in  the  already  covered  areas)  as  well  as  the  width  (increase \ncoverage to new areas). \n \nGovernment will, however, play a vital role in urban health through: (i) regulation, as in \n13. \nsetting standards and approving service protocols, laying down health policy, developing long-\nterm  strategy,  and  thereby  guiding  the  development  of  urban  health  approaches;  and \n(ii) coordination,  as  in  determining  clients\u2019  health  needs  in  urban  areas,  defining  catchment \nareas, and facilitating local supervision and support service provision. \n \nF. \n \nReaching  the  Poor.  Health  services  must  be  brought  to  more  poor  and  vulnerable \n14. \npeople in urban areas. The poor and vulnerable are not necessarily driven primarily by concerns \nabout  preventive  care  but  by  their  need  for  housing,  clean  water,  sanitation,  a  clean \nenvironment,  etc.  Slum  dwellers  are  usually  migrants  from  rural  areas  and  are  mobile.  Other \nurban poor, who are not well captured by the system, are also believed to be fairly mobile.  \n \n\nIssues and Challenges in Urban Health Care \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27\n\n15.  Widening  Geographical  Coverage.  There  are  probably  40\u201350  municipalities  of  a \nsignificant  size  not  captured  by  ADB  or  USAID  projects.  There  are  another  150  largely  rural \nmunicipalities  completely  outside  the  net.  The  NGO-led  projects  are  not  the  only  source  of \nservices but the other players are rarely able to provide coverage at the basic standard needed \nto meet the nation\u2019s health objectives. The commercial sector offers nationwide coverage but is \nrarely focused on providing primary health care or on offering affordable prices.  \n \n16. \nContracting  Service  Providers.  Continuity  and  cost  recovery  were  the  two  issues  to \nemerge  most  strongly  from  experiences  in  contracting-out  services.  The  NGO  community \ncontinually  faces  disruptions  caused  by  projects  ending  and  restarting.  Three-  to  3-year \ncontracts are therefore seen as too short for proper planning and 6-year contracts are preferred. \nThe  trade-off  between  cost  recovery  and  serving  the  poor  is  a  constant  source  of  pressure. \nNGOs are caught between pressures to serve the poor and to recover their costs for long-term \nsurvival.  Because  of  PHC  services\u2019  public-good  characteristics  and  their  pro-poor  focus, \nsubstantial public subsidy will always be necessary. However, 10\u201315% of the total cost can be \nmet  from  user  fees  from  people  who  can  afford  the  services.  The  remaining  85\u201390%  will  be \nused to fund free services for the poor and will come from the central Government (about 65%), \nand local governments (the remainder). \n \n17. \nUsing United Nation\u2019s population projections, various scenarios for costing were used to \nproject  the  cost.  Two  levels  of  coverage  were  used:  50%  (mainly  the  poor)  and  100%  of  the \nurban  population.  Four  levels  of  per  capita  cost  were  used:  from  a  bare  minimum  of  $1  per \ncapita  to  $30  per  capita  (close  to  the  recommendation  of  the  World  Health  Organization\u2019s \n(WHO) Commission on Macroeconomics and Health), with $3 (current level of spending by the \nGovernment)  and  $12  (recommended  by  the  World  Development  Report,  1993)  in  between. \nThe  projected  costs  are  given  below.  Even  at  $1  per  capita,  covering  only  50%  of  the \npopulation,  the  total  cost  comes  to  $16  million  a  year,  which  would  increase  to  $43  million  by \n2030 (Table A2). \n\nTable A2: Estimated Cost of Providing Urban Health \n\nPopulation (million) \n\nProject annual cost of providing \nurban health care to 50% urban \npopulation at different per capita \ncost \n($ million) \n\nYear \n2000 \n2005 \n2010 \n2015 \n2020 \n2025 \n2030 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nUrban \n32 \n38 \n45 \n54 \n63 \n74 \n87 \n\nTotal \n138 \n153 \n167 \n181 \n195 \n208 \n220 \n\n$1\n16\n19\n23\n27\n32\n37\n43\n\n$3\n48\n57\n68\n80\n95\n111\n130\n\n$12\n192\n229\n272\n322\n379\n445\n519\n\n$30\n480\n572\n679\n804\n948\n1,113\n1,298\n\nProject annual cost of providing \nurban health care to 100% urban \npopulation at different per capita \ncost \n($ million) \n$3 \n96 \n114 \n136 \n161 \n190 \n223 \n260 \n\n$12\n384\n458\n544\n643\n759\n890\n1,038\n\n$1 \n32 \n38 \n45 \n54 \n63 \n74 \n87 \n\n$30\n  960\n1,144\n1,359\n1,609\n1,897\n2,225\n2,595\n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nLESSONS LEARNED AND PROJECT DESIGN FEATURES \n\nIssue \nLow utilization: \nPro-poor \ntargeting \n\nLow utilization: \nIncrease depth \nof coverage \n\nLow utilization: \nIncrease \nawareness and \ndemand \nLow utilization: \nImprove quality \nof care \n\nLessons Learned \nWithout adequate provisions \nand safeguards in the \npartner nongovernment \norganization (NGO) bidding \nprocess, pro-poor targeting \nis difficult. \nCoverage must be \ndeepened to improve \neffectiveness and achieve \nthe Millennium Development \nGoals. \nAwareness about first Urban \nPrimary Health Care Project \n(UPHCP-I) among the poor \nmust be increased. \nQuality must be assured and \nclinical care standardized. \n\nAdapting to \nchange \n\nEmerging threats must be \naddressed effectively. \n\nInfrastructure  \nFund flow \n\nLand is scarce in Dhaka. \nCash and fund flow to \npartner NGOs must be \nimproved. \n\nLocal \ngovernment  \nCoordination  \n\nFinancial \nsustainability \n\nInstitutional \nsustainability \n\nCountry \nAssistance \nProgram \nEvaluation, \n2003 \n\nMayors and chairmen must \nbe involved in the Project. \nThe Project needs greater \ncoordination with the \nMinistry of Health and \nFamily Welfare (MOHFW) \nand Health, Nutrition, and \nPopulation Sector Program \n(HNPSP). \nMechanisms are needed to \nsustain the financial \nsustainability of project \ninitiatives. \nProject management is \nneeded under the Local \nGovernment Division (LGD).  \nSupport is needed for long-\nterm allocations for recurrent \n(operational) budget. \n\nUser fees charges must be \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s policy \non user charges. \nMore concrete program \ntargets must be set. \n\nProject Design Features \n\nAt least 30% of the services to target the poor, otherwise \ncontractual disincentives will be invoked under the partnership \nagreement.

This  definition  will  be \nreviewed  at  project  inception  and  at  regular  intervals  to  further  fine-tune  efficient  pro-poor \ntargeting. \n \n\nTable A4: Operational Definition of Very Poor and Poor \n\nStatus of Indicators \n\nPeople living in ordinary slums \n\nPoor \n\nIndicators \nLiving conditions \n\nVery poor \n\nPeople living in very poor slums  \n(i.e., shanties); on the streets; near factories \nor waste dumps, riverbeds or hillsides;  \nthe population is floating \n \n\nNature of employment  Casual and informal sector workers: garment \nworkers; hawkers; rickshaw and rickshaw van \npullers; other manual car pullers; garbage or \nwaste collectors; street sweepers; latrine \ncleaners; day laborers; maid servants; \nbeggars; sellers of food or cigarettes on the \nstreet; disabled people; the unemployed; \nother vulnerable groups, e.g., sex workers \n \n Up to Tk500 \n\n  \n \n\n \n  \n  \n\nCasual and informal sector workers: baby \ntaxi or tempo drivers, small traders, taxi/ \nbus/private car drivers, factory workers, \nshopkeepers, tailors, small businessmen \n\nTk500\u2013Tk700 \n\nRent over Tk700  \n\nMonthly income \n(average per \nhousehold member)  \n \nRental status \n\nMeal per day and \ncooking facilities \n \n\nOther family \ncharacteristics \n\nRent up to Tk700  \n \nAverage one meal or two inadequate meals \nper day; share cooking stove with other \nfamilies \n \nWidows, households headed by females, \nmigrants from rural areas in the last 2 years \n\nTwo adequate or three inadequate meals \nper day,  or three adequate meals per day \n \n\nWidows, households headed by women, \nmigrants from rural areas in the last 2 \nyears \n\nMechanism to Increase Access to Health Services by the Poor  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nBaseline  Survey  of  the  Project  Area.  A  baseline  survey  will  be  conducted  by  the \npartner NGO at the beginning of the partnership agreement to identify poor households in the \npartnership  area.  Poor  households  will  be  identified  based  on  the  social  and  economic \nindicators  above.  These  households  will  be  given  entitlement  health  cards  giving  them  free \naccess to health services under the Project. The survey of the poor households will be updated \nannually.  A  participatory  appraisal  will  be  conducted  at  the  community  level  to  assess  the \navailability  of  health  services;  access  to  health  services  by  the  poor;  and  the  social,  financial, \nand physical barriers to their use by the poor.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nLocation  of  Health  Facilities  and  Mini-Clinics.  In  order  to  facilitate  their  use  by  the \n3. \npoor, health facilities will be located in slums or close to slums or poor populations. Where land \nis  scarce  and  health  facilities  cannot  be  located  in  or  near  slums,  mini-clinics  will  operate  in \nslums. Mini-clinics\u2019 hours will be flexible to meet the needs of the poor. If necessary, they will be \nopen during the evening. \n \n4. \nSocial  Mobilization.  At  the  beginning  of  the  Project,  in  each  ward,  a  launching  or \ninception ceremony will introduce the health center facilities. A comprehensive community social \nmobilization program will be designed to disseminate basic information on project services and \nmotivate  the  poor  to  use  the  health  facilities.  The  program  will  include  audiovisual  and  other \ninnovative methods. Neighborhood meetings in slums and low-income areas will be organized \nperiodically  to  explain  all  services  available,  rates  of  services,  and  free  services  for  the  poor. \nNetworking  with  other  NGOs  in  the  area  will  be  encouraged  to  strengthen  pro-poor  targeting. \nWard-level  primary  health  care  committees  with  male  and  female  ward  commissioners,  local \nleaders, members of youth clubs, civil society, NGOs, partner NGOs, and representatives of the \npoor will develop awareness campaigns for the poor and to monitor access to health services \nand their quality. The Project will support grassroots activities against social prejudice and other \nbarriers that discourage use of health facilities by the poor and minorities.  \n  \n5. \nMonitoring  and  Record  Keeping.  The  partner  NGOs  will  keep  systematic  records  on \nthe patients by poverty and gender, and will prepare quarterly reports of health service use by \nthe poor, women, and adolescents.  \n \n6. \nCapacity  Building.  The  field  staff  of  the  partner  NGOs  responsible  for  social \nmobilization,  health  education,  and  community  volunteers  will  be  oriented  on  the  Project  and \npro-poor targeting. The field staff and volunteers will receive training in mobilizing the poor and \ngenerating demand for health services among them.  \n \nC. \n \n7. \nThe Project will ensure easy access to health-service-related information by the general \npublic  and  the  urban  poor.  It  will  use  information  bulletin  boards  outside  health  facilities  to \nprovide information on user fees and availability of free services to the poor, outreach activities, \ncommunity-based  organizations,  and  other  cost-effective  means.  The  facility,  ward,  city,  and \nmunicipality PHC committees will include representatives of the poor urban slum dwellers and \nfemale  ward  members,  and  will  meet  quarterly.  The  committees  will  review  their  jurisdiction\u2019s \nlisting  of  poor  households  to  ensure  that  the  poor  are  being  targeted  efficiently,  the  annual \nphysical  and  financial  plans  to  ensure  adaptation  to  the  local  context,  and  the  quarterly \nexpenditure  statements  to  ensure  public  accountability.  To  make  committees  more  effective, \nkey  stakeholders  will  oriented  and  trained  in  project  management  to  ensure  good  governance \nand transparency. \n\nGood Governance and Transparency to Ensure Efficient Pro-Poor Targeting \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n31\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nIMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT \n\n \n\nand \n\nBackground \n\nA. \n \n1. \nDefining  Standards.  The  Local  Government  Division  (LGD)  of  Ministry  of  Local \nGovernment, Rural Development and Cooperatives, the Executing Agency, will contract out the \ndelivery of an essential service package plus (ESP+) to nongovernment organizations (NGOs) \nand the private sector (the partners). The ESP (Supplementary Appendix B) will constitute 90% \nof  the  services,  and  up  to  10%  of  total  services  other  than  ESP  may  be  included  under  the \nESP+ package.  \n \n2. \nDefine  Partnership  Areas  and  Baseline  Data  Collection.  LGD  and  the  city \ncorporations  and  municipalities  will  identify  23  defined  partnership  areas  (10  in  Dhaka;  3  in \nChittagong;  2  in  Kulna;  2  in  Rajshahi;  1  each  in  Sylhet  and  Barisal;  and  1  in  each  of  the  five \nmunicipalities),  each  covering  200,000\u2013300,000  people.  Two  partnership  agreements  in \nChittagong will continue to be operated by the city.  Gender- \npoverty-disaggregated \nbaseline household survey data will be used to, among other things, develop the values of key \nperformance indicators and a summary score for assessing overall performance of the partners, \nand will be incorporated in the tender documents and partnership agreements.1  \n \n3. \nPreparation  of  Bid  Documents  and  Dissemination.  The  project  management  unit \n(PMU)  will  develop  bid  documents,  and  the  Government  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) will approve them. The tender documents will reflect, among other things, the conditions \ndescribed  below.  Invitation  to  bid  will  be  widely  disseminated.  During  the  bidding  period, \npartnership agreement information seminars will be held after being widely advertised.  \n \nBidding  Process.  The  Second  Urban  Primary  Health  Care  Project  (the  Project)  will \n4. \ninvite sealed bids from NGOs, private agencies, and provider associations to deliver a defined \npackage of primary health care (PHC) services to specific urban partnership areas. Bidders that \ncan deliver the specified services best, at the lowest price, will be awarded the contracts.  \n \n5. \nSingle-Stage,  Two-Envelope  Process.  A  two-envelope  bidding  procedure  will  be \nadopted.  Bidders  are  to  submit  simultaneously  two  sealed  envelopes,  one  containing  the \ntechnical proposal(s) and one the financial proposal(s). Initially only the technical proposals will \nbe opened, and evaluated. Only the technical proposals of qualified bidders will be evaluated by \nthe national bid evaluation committee.  \n \n6. \nEvaluation  of  the  Bids.  The  committee  chaired  by  the  LGD  secretary  will  include \nrepresentation  of  the  city  corporation  health  department,  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Family \nWelfare, the PMU, ADB, representatives of cofinancers, and prominent NGOs. The committee \nwill  determine  whether  the  proposals  are  technically  responsive  according  to  preestablished \nwritten  evaluation  criteria.  All  bidders  who  achieve  a  minimum  score  will  be  considered \ntechnically responsive. \n \n7. \nTechnical  Proposal  Evaluation.  Each  member  of  the  technical  evaluation  committee \nwill  give  a  technical  proposal  score  using  the  point  system  specified  below  under  criteria  for \n                                                 \n1  For  the  four  city  corporations  of  the  first  Urban  Primary  Health  Care  Project,  the  data  from  the  final  household   \n  survey (conducted in September 2004) will be used as a baseline survey; for the remaining two city corporations \n  and five municipalities, a baseline survey will be conducted within 3 months of loan effectiveness. \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nevaluation of technical proposals, which will be expanded to create a technical proposal scoring \nsheet on which all bidders and scoring criteria will be listed. The score for a proposal will be the \nmean  of  the  scores  given  the  specific  proposal.  The  mean  score  for  each  section  of  the \nevaluation (prior experience, quality of staff, and project plan) must be at least 50% of the total \nscore  possible  for  each  section,  and  the  total  mean  score  must  be  at  least  60%  of  the  total \nscore  possible  for  the  proposal.  This  score  will  be  defined  as  the  minimum  score  to  be \ntechnically responsive. \n \nCriteria  for  Evaluation  of  Technical  Proposal.  The  following  criteria  will  be  used  to \n8. \nevaluate  the  technical  proposals  for  the  contracting-out  of  health  services  operation  and \nmanagement in urban partnership areas: \n \n\nTable A5.1: Criteria for Evaluation of Technical Proposal \n\nComponent/Subcomponent \nA.

The financial proposals for all bids that meet the minimum score to \n9. \nbe  technically  responsive  will  be  opened  in  public.  All  technically  responsive  bidders  will  be \nnotified  of  the  date  on  which  the  proposals  are  to  be  opened,  and  are  welcome  to  send  a \nrepresentative.  The  following  formula  will  be  used  to  generate  the  financial  score:  the  lowest-\npriced  financial  proposal  for  a  particular  partnership  agreement  area  (among  the  technically \nresponsive bids for that area) will be divided by the bidder\u2019s financial proposal multiplied by 100 \npossible  points  to  obtain  the  financial  score  of  the  specific  bidder.  (The  technically  qualified \nbidder with lowest financial proposal would get a financial score of 100 points.) \n \n10. \nContract Award. The technical proposal score and the financial proposal will be used to \ncalculate the overall score. Total points for the bidder\u2019s technical proposal will be added to the \ntotal  points  for  the  bidder\u2019s  financial  proposal.  The  highest  evaluated  proposal  will  be  the  one \nthat comes closest to 200 possible points. The bid that results in the highest overall score will be \noffered the opportunity to enter into the contract. Where more than one bid receives the same \noverall  score,  the  one  with  the  highest  technical  proposal  score  will  be  awarded  the  contract.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n33\n\nConditions for the Partnership Agreement \n\nIf there is only one technically responsive bid for a particular partnership area, the bidder may \nbe  offered  the  opportunity  to  enter  into  immediate  negotiation,  provided  that  the  financial \nproposal is comparable to that of the winning bidder of a similarly sized partnership area.  \n \n B. \n \n11. \nEligibility  to  Bid.  Bidders  should  meet  the  following  minimum  qualifying  criteria:  \n(i) evidence of having implemented projects with a total annual value equal to $100,000 or more \nfor  each  of  the  previous  5  years;  (ii)  evidence  that  the  organization  has  sound  financial \naccounting  practices;  (iii)  no  consistent  history  of  litigation  or  arbitration  awards  against  the \nbidder  or  associated  organizations;  (iv)  minimum  of  8  years\u2019  experience  working  with  health \nsystems and related activities, with at least 5 of these years in Bangladesh by principal bidder; \nand (v) registration with an appropriate agency of the Government, entitling the bidder to work in \nBangladesh. \n \nNumber  of  Agreements  per  Partner.  Bidders  may  submit  bids  for  up  to  four \n\n12. \npartnership areas, and any single bidder may be awarded a maximum of three contracts. \n \n13. \nPayment  and  Price  Adjustments.  Following  the  mobilization  payment,  partners  will \nreceive  quarterly  payments  based on  the  partnership  agreement  price.  The  tender  documents \nand  contracts  will  include  different  cost  categories  such  as  salaries  of  staff,  cost  of  drugs, \nmedical  instruments,  consumable  medical  supplies,  rent  payments,  operating  expenses, \nmaintenance  costs,  etc.  A  lump-sum  payment  method  will  be  employed  to  reduce  the \nadministrative  burden  on  the  partners,  the  city  corporation,  the  PMU,  and  LGD.  Regular \nsupervision  of  the  PHC  centers  by  the  city  corporations  and  municipalities  and  by  an \nindependent  firm  using  the  integrated  supervisory  instrument  and  other  monitoring  techniques \nwill  ensure  that  the  services  are  being  provided  and  that  drugs  and  personnel  are  available.  \nIn  addition  to  regular  quarterly  payments,  a  bonus  will  be  paid  to  those  who  exceed \nperformance requirements. The partnership agreement will be terminated if the partner fails to \nmeet the terms of the agreement. The agreement will provide that the partner will enable the city \ncorporations,  municipalities,  the  PIU,  the  PMU,  and  ADB  to  have  access  to  inspect  records, \naccounts, and financial statements relating to use of the project funds kept by the partner or its \nauditors,  and  to  furnish  any  information  concerning  such  records,  accounts,  and  financial \nstatements  as  ADB  may  request.  Because  the  agreements  will  be  carried  out  over  6  years, \nprice adjustments will be permitted.  \n \nPerformance Evaluation. Targets for project achievement and partner bonuses will be \n14. \nbased on the partnership area objectives that the partner has agreed to achieve. A composite \nindex of health system performance will be developed based on the partnership area objectives \nspecified in the partnership agreements.2  \n \n15. \nPerformance  Bonuses.  Performance  bonuses  may  be  paid  to  partners  who  make \nsignificant  improvements  in  the  composite  index  of  health  system  performance  in  their \n\n                                                 \n2  The index will include coverage statistics for preventive services; utilization of services; coverage of poor and very \npoor households; coverage of women, particularly girls; quality of care; cost-efficiency in provision of services; and \nhealth impact by midterm and end of the Project. Data to calculate the composite index  will be collected through \nhousehold  and  health  facility  surveys.  Community  satisfaction  will  be  judged  by  focus  group  discussions  and \ncommunity meetings to be conducted at baseline, midterm, and the end of the contract. Regular supervision by the \ncity corporations and municipalities using the integrated supervisory instruments will provide additional information \nbetween formal surveys. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\npartnership agreement areas. Bonuses may be paid twice, once after the midterm review, and \nagain  at  the  end  of  the  agreement.  The  decision  as  to  whether  a  bonus  will  be  awarded  will \ndepend on the initial agreement area composite index, and the amount of improvement in the \nindex.  The  amount  of  the  bonus  will  be  determined  on  a sliding  scale, based  on  the  extent  of \nimprovement  in  the  agreement  area  index  and  the  initial  Index  score  in  the  agreement.  \nThe Index is designed so that the bonus level (1%, 3%, 6%) requires a greater increase in index \nscores.

A bonus will not be paid where two or more indicators at midterm \nand  final  evaluation  are  below  a  certain  level  defined  in  the  tender  documents,  so  as  to \ndiscourage partners from focusing their efforts only on a few indicators to boost the composite \nindex.  \n \n17. \nTermination of the Partnership Agreement. The composite index will be used, along \nwith  regular  monitoring,  to  alert  LGD,  city  corporations,  and  municipalities  of  implementation \nproblems.  Partners  that  fail  to  improve  a  partnership  agreement  area  composite  index  by  the \nmidterm evaluation or do not meet the established standards during routine supervision under \nthe integrated supervisory instrument will have their contracts terminated. The exact procedure \nfor termination will be specified in the tender documents and in the contract.  \n \n18. \nTargeting the Poor and Increasing their Access to PHC. The performance targets of \nthe partnership agreement will specify levels of coverage to be achieved in terms of slum and \nnon-slum poor populations. Overall, at least 30% of the project services will target the poor, and \nachievements for poor populations will be included in the composite index. Each agreement will \nrequire that at least 20% of all health care centers will be open and staffed between from 8 a.m. \nto  10  p.m.  everyday.  The  \u201cpoor\u201d  will  be  defined  in  the  bid  document  and  contract,  and  the \ndefinition will be reviewed annually (an indicative working definition of the poor and very poor is \nin Appendix 4). The tender documents and contract will specify the method for identification of \nthe poor and the very poor, provision of color-coded health cards for the poor and very poor and \nmaintenance of records to track service use by the poor and non-poor. \n \nHealth Care Facilities. Once newly constructed facilities are available in the partnership \n19. \nareas,  the  partners  will  be  granted  use  of  these  facilities  solely  for  the  delivery  of  health  care \nservices, free of rent. At the end of the agreement, the partner will turn the health care building \nalong  with  all  equipment  and  furniture  over  to  the  city  corporations  and  municipalities  in  good \ncondition, with allowance for normal wear and tear. \n \n20. \nAllowable User Charges and Referrals. The poor will be exempt from all user fees on \nall services. The bid documents will specify certain critical public health services that are exempt \nfrom user charges even among those who can afford them. The cost of drugs will be recovered \nfrom  the  nonpoor  patients  up  to  10\u201320%  below  the  maximum  retail  price  specified  on  the \ncontainer.  Special  color-coded  forms  will  be  used  by  partners  to  ensure  that  referred  patients \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n35\n\nfrom the project clinics are well received at the hospitals of the city corporations and Ministry of \nHealth and Family Welfare (MOHFW). \n \n21. \nQuality  of  Care.  Delivering  health  care  services  under  the  partnership  agreements, \npartners  will  be  required  to  follow  all  applicable  national  program  standards  and  guidelines.  \nThe quality of care will be assessed formally during the health facility surveys and during routine \nsupervisory  visits.  To  ensure  that  health  care  personnel  are  properly  trained,  the  costs  of  \nin-service training for health care staff will be included in the bid.  \n \n22.  MOHFW Initiatives. The partners will support all national initiatives of MOHFW. In the \ncase of a new national health initiative, the partners will be required to deliver the new services \nin  addition  to  those  specified  in  their  partnership  agreements,  for  which  additional  resources \nwould be made available based on annual review of the costs. \n \n23. \nDispute Resolution. LGD will establish a dispute resolution panel, which will consist of \none  person  nominated  by  the  LGD,  one  by  the  partners,  and  the  third,  who  will  act  as  chair, \nnominated  by  the  other  two.  However,  if  either  party  is  not  satisfied  with  the  panel\u2019s  decision, \nthe  case  may  be  referred  for  arbitrations  under  the  Bangladesh  Arbitration  Act  1940  as \namended  from  time  to  time  by  one  or  more  arbitrators  appointed  in  accordance  with  the  act.  \nThe arbitration award will be final and binding on the parties. \n \n24. \nIndemnification  and  Insurance  and  Work  Rules.  The  indemnity  provisions  of  the \npartnership agreement will consider the risks that apply during the various stages of agreement \nexecution, and will be specified in the bid documents and contract. The partner will be required \nto  take  out  sufficient  insurance  to  cover  all  essential  risks  in  connection  with  carrying  out  the \nagreement. The agreement will stipulate that LGD will provide the partner, and the partner will \ncomply  with,  the  Government\u2019s  work,  safety,  and  health  rules  governing  the  conduct  of  the \npartner\u2019s personnel at the project health facilities. \n \n25. \nControl  of  Materials  Furnished  by  LGD,  and  Accounts.  Following  delivery  and \nacceptance  by  the  partners,  the  partners  will  be  responsible  for  any  loss  or  damage  to  the \nmaterial  provided  by  LGD,  city  corporations,  and  municipalities  for  use  by  the  partners  in \ndelivering  PHC  services.  Partners  will  be  required  to  follow  the  maintenance  guidelines \ndeveloped  under  the  Project.  At  the  end  of  the  Project,  all  equipment,  furniture,  and  vehicles \nprovided  by  the  Project  will  be  the  property  of  respective  city  corporations  and  municipalities \nunless  otherwise  stated  by  LGD.  The  partners  will  be  required  to  keep  detailed  financial \naccounts  and  records  of  their  activities,  and  make  these  available  to  LGD,  city  corporations, \nmunicipalities, and ADB. \n \nC.  \n \n26. \nThe  LGD  will  provide  the  partners  with  the  right  to  use  the  PHC  and  comprehensive \nreproductive  health  centers  free  of  rent  during  the  project  period;  provide  the  partners  with \ncontraceptive  supplies  and  vaccines  on  time  (provision  of  medicines  will  be  part  of  the  bid); \nallow  partners  full  managerial  autonomy;  ensure  timely  disbursements,  and  process  vouchers \nand  release  payments  within  2  weeks;  permit  them  to  charge  user  fees  up  to  a  maximum \namount to be determined by LGD and to review fees annually; permit them to recover the cost \nof  drugs  prescribed  up  to  10%  below  the  maximum  retail  price  for  the  nonpoor;  and  be \nresponsible for carrying out minor repairs and preventive maintenance, such as painting, noting \nmajor repairs required and estimating their cost, and alerting the relevant city corporation about \nrequired major repairs.  \n\nResponsibilities of Executing Agency \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nHIV/AIDS AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONTROL GRANT RATIONALE AND PURPOSE \n\n \n\nRationale \n\n1. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  finance  $10  million  of  project  costs  from  the \nportion of the Asian Development Fund (ADF) IX Grant Allocation dedicated to HIV/AIDS1 and \nother infectious disease control activities. This Appendix describes the rationale, purpose, and \nmonitoring and evaluation plan for the grant-funded components of the Project.  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nAlignment  with  Country\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy.  The  Bangladesh  Interim \nPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper2 (I-PRSP) highlights several key concerns that would in part \nbe  addressed  by  the  Second  Urban  Primary  Health  Care  Project  (the  Project):  worsening  of \nurban  poverty  during  second  half  of  1990s  caused  by  negative  growth  in  per  capita  real \nconsumption, widening socioeconomic differentials in mortality and malnutrition; poor quality of \npublic  health  services,  and  weaknesses  in  the  health  sector,  in  particular  reproductive  health \ncare.3  \n \n3. \nPartnership  Agreement,  and  Country  Strategy  and  Program.  The  Government  of \nBangladesh  and  ADB  signed  a  Partnership  Agreement  on  Poverty  Reduction  (PAPR)  in  April \n2000.4  The  PAPR  identified  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  goals  as  to  reduce  maternal \nmortality by 35%, infant mortality by 30%, and malnourishment among children by 20%, as well \nas  to  increase  the  proportion  of  women  of  appropriate  age  with  access  to  reproductive  health \nservices  by  50%.  As  identified  in  the  Bangladesh  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  for \n2005\u20132006,5  HIV/AIDS,  nutrition,  and  urban  primary  health  care  (PHC)  are  ADB\u2019s  social \ndevelopment  priorities  in  the  country.  They  will  be  addressed  by,  among  others,  building  local \ngovernment capacity to deliver high-quality services to the urban poor, particularly women and \nchildren, in partnership with nongovernment organizations (NGOs). \n \n3. \nInfectious  Disease  Control.  Approximately  90%  of  the  services  provided  under  the \npartnership  agreement  are  from  the  essential  services  package  (ESP)  of  primary  health  care \n(Supplementary Appendix B). More than 50% of the Project\u2019s base costs will address infectious \ndiseases and HIV/AIDS control. The environment health subcomponent ($1.5 million), involving \nconstruction of community latrines and community-based solid waste disposal, will help control \ninfectious diseases.  \n \nHIV/AIDS  Control.  Although  HIV/AIDS  prevalence  in  Bangladesh  is  less  than  0.2%,  \n4. \nthis should not lead to complacency. The global HIV/AIDS pandemic has taught us that in every \ncountry the disease initially affects high-risk groups, and then spreads to the general population. \nThe  window  of  opportunity  for  controlling  HIVAIDS  in  many  developing  member  countries  is \nprecisely  when  prevalence  is  still  restricted  to  high-risk  groups  (e.g.,  injecting  drug  users, \n                                                 \n1  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n2   Economic Relations Division, Ministry of Finance. 2002. Bangladesh: A National Strategy for Economic Growth and \n\nPoverty Reduction. Government of Bangladesh. \n\n3  Of the seven targets set by Interim-Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) to be achieved by 2015, the Project \nwill address four: (i) reduction of infant and under-5 mortality rates by 65%, and elimination of gender disparity in \nchild  mortality;  (ii)  reduction  of  the  proportion  of  malnourished  children  under  5  years  by  50%,  and  elimination  of \ngender  disparities  in  child  malnutrition;  (iii) reduction  of  maternal  mortality  ratio  by  75%;  and  (iv)  ensuring \navailability of reproductive health services to all women.  \n\n4   ADB.  2000.

Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132006): Bangladesh. Manila.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n37\n\ncommercial sex workers). This fairly describes the current situation in Bangladesh, and failure to \naddress this major public health issue early in the epidemiological cycle will entail high human \nand economic costs. \n \nMillennium  Development  Goals  and  Human  Poverty  Reduction.  The  Project \n5. \naddresses  key  health  concerns  of  the  urban  poor,  especially  the  most  vulnerable  groups, \nwomen  and  children,  who  will  constitute  more  than  75%  of  the  beneficiaries.  The  Project  will \nhelp Bangladesh to achieve Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4, 5, and 6 (child mortality; \nmaternal  mortality;  and  HIV/AIDS,  malaria  and  other  diseases).  The  Project  is  thus  closely \naligned with ADB\u2019s overarching goal of reducing poverty.  \n \n6. \nPublic\u2013Private  Partnership,  Efficiency  Gains,  and  Policy  Implications  for  the \nRegion. There is also a strong economic rationale for funding primary health care. Sound public \nhealth interventions lead to positive externalities and public goods. However, research findings \nvary  in  terms  of  how  such  \u201cpublicly\u201d  subsidized  social  services,  including  primary  health  care, \nshould  be  provided.  Recent  ADB  research  in  Cambodia  showed  that,  when  compared  with \ngovernment-run  rural  health  facilities,  those  contracted  out  to  NGOs  were  more  effective.6 \nThrough  performance-based  contracting  to  NGOs,  the  Project  rewards  good  performance  by \nrequiring accountability for effective, efficient social services delivery. The Project is consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s emphasis on development effectiveness and managing for development results. \n \n7. \nLocal Government Ownership. Involvement of decentralized institutions in the delivery \nof  social  services,  including  primary  health  care,  improves  targeting  of  services  at  the  poor.7  \nBy  involving  city  corporations  and  municipalities  in  delivering  primary  health  care,  the  Project \ntherefore follows one of the cardinal principles of development effectiveness.  \n \n8. \nFunding  Agency  Assistance.  \nThe  components  of  the  Project  funded  by  the  ADF  IX  Grant  Program  are  well  aligned  with,  \nbut  will  not  replace,  the  resources  and  mandates  of  other  international  entities  operating  in \nBangladesh. To ensure complementarity with ongoing efforts, the project management unit will \nmaintain close coordination with the National AIDS Committee, Technical Advisory Committee, \nand the Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD)/AIDS  Program Unit in the Ministry  of Health and \nFamily Welfare. \n \nB. \n \n9. \nActivities  will  be  supported  by  the  grant  through  the  following  project  components: \n(i) provision of PHC under the partnership agreement, and (ii) behavior change communication \nand marketing (BCCM) (Table A6). Under PHC service provision, the service delivery contract \nwith  NGOs  will  include  two  activities  funded  entirely  by  the  grant:  $2.5  million  to  operate  \n24 voluntary counseling and testing centers, one for each partnership area; and $5.0 million to \ncontrol  sexually  transmitted  infections  (STI)  and  reproductive  tract  infections  (RTI).  Under  the \nBCCM component, the grant will provide $2.5 million for HIV/AIDS, STI and infectious disease \ncontrol. A brief description of grant-funded activities follows. \n \n\nComplementarity  with  Other  External \n\nProposed Grant Activities \n\n                                                 \n6  Bhushan, I.

VCT will provide confidential counseling to \n10. \nenable people to make informed decisions about their HIV status and to take action. If a person \ndecides to take the HIV test, VCT enables confidential testing. Counseling for VCT consists of \npre-test, post-test, and follow-up counseling. VCT will benefit individuals and society as a whole \nby  helping  prevent  HIV/AIDS  and  STI.  Under  the  Project,  VCT  will  follow  the  national  policy \nestablished by the National AIDS Committee. \n \n11. \nSTI and RTI Control. Services will be provided as a distinct component of the service \ncontract with the NGOs and will include: (i) education of service providers and field workers in \nSTI  and  RTI  control;  (ii)  diagnosis  and  management  of  STIs,  and  female  and  male  RTIs;  \nand  (iii) counseling,  treatment,  and  motivating  clients  to  bring  their  partners  for  treatment  and \ncounseling.  \n \n12. \nBCCM  for  HIV/AIDS  and  STI  Control.  This  will  target  the  general  adult  population  as \nwell  as  the  high-risk  population.  The  following  are  the  objectives  for  HIV  and  STI  control: \n(i) improve  the  vulnerable  population\u2019s  knowledge,  attitudes,  and  behaviors  related  to  HIV; \n(ii) promote  condom  use;  (iii)  encourage  voluntary  counseling  and  HIV  testing;  (iv)  encourage \ncare-seeking for STIs; (v) increase knowledge of the link between STIs and HIV; (vi) empower \nvulnerable people to control their lives; and (vii) enable tolerance and care toward people living \nwith  HIV/AIDS.  Activities  supported  by  the  grant  will  help  households  prevent  adult  and  child \ninfectious diseases through changes in knowledge, attitudes, and practices.  \n \n\nTable A6:  Grant-supported Activities for HIV/AIDS and Infectious Disease Control \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n \n2.5 \n5.0 \n\n \n2.5 \n\n \n\n \n\nComponent/ Subcomponent \nA. \n\nProvision of PHC under partnership agreement \n\n1.

The monitoring systems are based on monthly reports of the partnership NGOs, city \ncorporations,  and  municipalities  to  the  PMU.  These  reports  provide  the  basis  for  tracking  and \nevaluating  specific  inputs  (e.g.,  medicines,  other  supplies,  financial  inputs,  HIV/AIDS  control \nposters  purchased)  and  outputs  (e.g.,  number  of  patients  counseled  and  tested  for  HIV/AIDS, \npatients  treated  for  RTI  and  STI).  Moreover,  an  independent  evaluation  firm  will  conduct \nhousehold surveys at inception, midterm, and at the end, in addition to health facility surveys to \nevaluate  the  outcomes  and  impact  of  grant  funding.  For  grant  administration  purposes,  \nthe  Local  Government  Division  will  provide  a  separate  section  in  its  quarterly  report  to  ADB \nabout  the  financial  and  physical  inputs  and  outputs  relating  to  HIV/AIDS  and  other  infectious \ndisease  control.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  grant-funded  components  are  clearly \ndistinguishable, but integrated into the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n\n \n\n\fCOST ESTIMATES  \n ($ \u2018000) \n\nADB Administered\nFinancing\n\nFE\n\nLC&TD\n7,965\n\nTotal\n7,965\n\nFE\n\nUNFPA\nFinancing\n\nLC\n\nTotal\n0\n\nGovernment\nFinancing\nTDa\n\nItem\n\nA.

Provision  of  public  primary  health  care  (PHC)  in  urban  areas \nhas  been  limited,  mainly  as  a  result  of  financial  constraints  of  city  corporations  and \nmunicipalities.  Urban  PHC \nis  provided  mainly  by  city  corporations,  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs),  and  the  private  sector  but  has  a  weak  financial  base.  PHC  operations \nare  financially  supported  through  partnership  agreements  with  the  Local  Government  Division \n(LGD),  direct  financing  by  local  governments,  direct  assistance  from  international  donors,  \nor user charges. The LGD budget for agreements is financed from the project fund with foreign \nassistance.  Local  governments,  including  city  corporations  and  municipalities,  receive  grants \nfrom the central Government, which generally contributes more than a quarter of their revenue. \nIn other words, urban PHC depends heavily on foreign assistance and grants from the central \nGovernment. \n \nA  significant  proportion  of  local  governments\u2019  budget  relies  on  grants  from  the  central \n2. \nGovernment.2  Other  sources  of  revenue  are  taxes,  rates,  fees,  and  charges  levied  locally. \nUrban local governments raise 55\u201375% of their revenue from their own sources; the remainder \ncomes from grants from LGD and Annual Development Program. Local governments allocate a \nlarge proportion of their budget to physical infrastructure (30\u201340%) and public health accounts \nfor only 15\u201320 per cent.3 Expenditure for urban PHC from the public health budget of the local \ngovernments  is,  however,  negligible,  as  no  local  government  under  the  first  Urban  Primary \nHealth  Care  Project  (UPHCP-I),  except  Chittagong,  was  able  to  offer  matching  budgetary \nsupport. If urban PHC is to be sustained or expanded to meet the needs of the increasing urban \npopulation in the four largest cities and other urbanized municipalities, additional foreign aid or \nother sources of income will have to be sought. \n \nRationale  for  Public  Intervention  in  PHC.  There  are  three  strong  reasons  why  the \n3. \npublic  sector  should  support  urban  PHC.  First,  PHC  focuses  on  services  with  large  positive \nexternalities  and  public-good  characteristics,  such  as  immunization  programs  and  health \neducation.  As  society  will  benefit  from  the  provision  of  PHC,  the  Government  should  bear  an \nappropriate  level  of  the  cost.  Second,  PHC  provision  will  help  to  control  diseases,  including \ntuberculosis,  malaria,  and  diarrhea,  which  are  particularly  prevalent  among  the  poor.  \nThis  means  that  public  expenditure  on  PHC  is  likely  to  be  spent  on  the  poor,  thereby \nencouraging a more equitable redistribution of national wealth. Third, the potential productivity \n\n                                                 \n1  See Supplementary Appendix K for more details. \n2  Local Government Division (LGD) obtains a significant portion of the ministerial budget. The budget of  Ministry of \nLocal  Government,  Rural  Development  and  Cooperatives  (MOLGRDC)  has  been  9%  to  10%  of  the  total \nGovernment budget in the last 4 financial years, and was Tk49 billion in FY2005. MOLGRDC allocates 86% to 89% \nof its budget, or Tk42 billion, to LGD. In contrast, the budget required for urban primary health care (PHC) is small. \nThe  LGD  budget  consists  of  a  small  current  expenditure  budget  (10\u201315%)  and  a  large  annual  development \nprogram budget (85\u201390%). LGD has allocated 1% to 2% of its annual development program budget to urban PHC, \nwhich has covered capital and operational costs of service delivery through partnership agreements. Of the urban \nPHC budget, 75% to 80% has been financed by foreign aid. LGD allocates just less than a quarter of its current \nexpenditure budget to grants for autonomous bodies and institutions, which includes local governments. \n\n3  Country  paper:  Bangladesh,  Local  Government  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific:  A  Comparative  Study,  UNESCAP. \n\nAvailable: http://www.unescap.org/huset/lgstudy/country/bangladesh/bangladesh.html \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\n Appendix 11 \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\ngains realized through health improvement are substantial, raising the amount of social benefit \nfar above the profit of private PHC providers. Without support from the public sector, the supply \nof PHC services is likely to be suboptimal.  \n \nContracting-out  of  Health  Services.4  Experience  suggests  that  outsourcing  will \n4. \nimprove the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of PHC service delivery. The \u201ccontact-out model\u201d is \nmore cost-effective than the \u201ccontract-in model.\u201d5 The contract-in model, where partners provide \nonly management support to civil service health staff and are obliged to follow government rules \nand  regulations  with  respect  to  the  government-provided  resources,  is  inflexible  in  delivering \nservices.  The  contract-out  model,  however,  in  which  partners  are  responsible  for  the  entire \nmanagement and delivery of PHC services, allows for more flexible employment management \nand  greater  innovation.  As  the  UPHCP-I  was  based  on  the  contract-out  model,  the  Project \nshould build upon its successes.  \n \nB. \n \n5. \nDisability-adjusted  Life  Years  (DALYs).  An  attempt  was  made  to  estimate  DALYs \nsaved to assess the cost-effectiveness of the project design. Since the Project especially aims \nto  improve  child  and  maternal  health  care,  a  significant  proportion  (80.1%)  of  DALYs  will  be \nsaved from reducing the infant, under-5, and maternal mortality and the child malnutrition rates. \nControl of communicable diseases through the essential services package  will also help reduce \nDALYs. In total, the Project will decrease 2.3 million DALYs or 16% of the estimated \u201cwithout-\nproject\u201d DALYs over the next 20 years. The cost per DALY saved for the Project is estimated at \n$35,  which  is  compatible  with  the  estimation  for  the  first  phase  of  the  Project  ($34  per  DALY \nsaved) and well within the acceptable range listed in ADB\u2019s Policy for the Health Sector. \n \n6. \nEconomic Internal Rate of Return. To assess the economic viability and efficiency of \nthe investment under the Project, economic benefits and costs were identified and an economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) over 20 years was estimated. The Project will qualitatively improve \nurban  PHC  and  quantitatively  expand  its  coverage.  This  will  create  two  streams  of  economic \nbenefit:  a  resource  cost  saving  and  productivity  gain.  As  a  result  of  qualitative  improvements,  \nan  existing  urban  PHC  user  will  be  able  to  save  out-of-pocket  expenses  by  reducing  wasteful \noutpatient  visits,  treatments,  and  prescriptions.  The  saving  in  out-of-pocket  expenses  is \nassumed  to  be  $0.50  per  person  in  a  year  in  areas  covered  by  the  UPHCP,  and  $1.00  in  the \nadditional areas covered by the Project.  \n \n7. \nQuantitative expansion in PHC coverage will allow more people living in urban areas to \naccess  PHC.  Project  beneficiaries  will  increase  from  30%  to  60%  of  the  population  in  project \nareas  and  from  20%  to  50%  in  new  areas.  Prevention  and  early  treatment  of  diseases  will \nreduce the mortality rate, and consequently keep the workforce in good health. To measure the \nimpact  of  the  quantitative  expansion  in  monetary  terms,  the  income  gained  by  an  additional \nchild under 5 years old, whose life was saved by the Project, has been calculated, based on the \nestimated  lifetime  earning  of  a  worker.  The  under-5  mortality  rate  is  assumed  to  decrease \ngradually over the 6 years of the Project toward the target level of 69.7% from the current level \n\n                                                 \n4  There  are  three  major  types  of  PHC  provision:  (i)  direct  service  delivery  by  the  government,  (ii)  direct  service \ndelivery  by  the  private  sector,  and  (iii)  service  delivery  through  contracts  between  public,  private  and \nnongovernment  partners.  Provision  through  contract  is  likely  to  result  in  more  efficient,  effective  and  equitable \nservice delivery.  \n\n5  Research  on PHC service provision in Cambodia found that the contracting-out model  performed better than the \n\ncontracting-in model. (See ERD Policy Brief 6, 2002.) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n45  \n\nof 82.0%, and to stay at the target level afterward. Time saved because of the reduction in sick \ndays is estimated from DALYs saved for causes other than a decrease in under-5 child mortality \n(4.1  days  on  average).  The  value  of  1  day  is  estimated  at  $0.20,  considering  that  many \nbeneficiaries are the poor, women, and children with limited earning opportunities.  \n \n8. \nThe  estimated  total  economic  cost  of  the  Project  at  constant  2005  prices  is  \n$178.1  million  for  20  years,  including  capital  and  incremental  recurrent  costs.  The  recurrent \ncosts of the Project include: (i) operating and maintenance costs for civil works and equipment, \nwhich are set at 4% of investment costs, incurred every 5 years; (ii) salaries of managerial and \nadministrative  staff;  (iii)  a  contracting  amount  for  partnership  agreements;  and  (iv)  monitoring \nand  evaluation  costs,  including  management  information  system  implementation  costs.  \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  yield  a  net  present  value  of  $62.4  million  and  an  EIRR  of  17.4%, \nassuming  a  discount  rate  of  12.0%.  The  productivity  gains  are  much  larger  than  the  \nout-of-pocket expenditure reduction, as saving the life of a child under 5 years old leads to the \nlife-long  supply  of  one  labor  unit  after  the  child  enters  the  labor  market.  The  actual  economic \nrate  of  return  is  likely  to  be  higher,  reflecting  positive  externalities  and  longer-term \nintergenerational  social  benefits  that  come  with  improved  quality  of  PHC  services.  These \nbenefits  may  be  reflected  in  education  outcomes  and  quality  of  life,  to  which  it  is  difficult  to \nassign monetary values. \n \nSensitivity  Analysis.  A  sensitivity  analysis  has  been  undertaken  on  the  basis  of \n9. \nalternative  assumptions  about  improvements  to  the  quality  and  coverage  of  PHC  services. \nQuality  improvement  is  reflected  in  the  resource  savings.  The  \u201clow\u201d  case  for  PHC  quality \nassumes that resource savings are 10% lower than the target, and the \u201chigh\u201d case 10% greater. \nThe \u201clow\u201d case for coverage shows that the number of beneficiaries is 10% lower than planned, \nand the \u201chigh\u201d case 10% higher. The findings of the sensitivity analysis indicate that the return is \nmore sensitive to changes in the extent of coverage. An increase in coverage brings productivity \ngains and savings of total out-of-pocket expenditures, while an increase in quality affects only \nexpenditure  savings.  Therefore,  for  the  successful  outcome  of  the  Project,  it  is  crucial  to \ncultivate latent demand and increase coverage for the poor who do not currently have enough \naccess to PHC services. \n \nPoverty Impact Analysis. The distribution of the economic effects of the Project for the \n10. \nnext 20 years is estimated for three major stakeholders: (i) the Government and the economy, \n(ii)  beneficiaries,  and  (iii)  other  PHC  service  providers.  The  total  economic  effects  are  \n$137  million,  shared  by  the  Government  and  the  economy  ($1.5  million),  beneficiaries  \n($139.4  million)  and  other  PHC  service  providers  (\u2013$4.0  million).  The  Government  also  bears \nthe financial cost of the Project ($74.6 million) and, therefore, the Government and the economy \nlose about $73.0 million. The net total economic effect is $62.4 million. \n \nThe  economic  losses  of  the  Government  and  the  economy  and  the  economic  gains  of \n11. \nbeneficiaries  are  shared  by  the  poor  and  nonpoor.  During  the  analysis  period,  10%  of  the \npopulation  and  30%  of  beneficiaries  were  estimated  to  be  poor.  Therefore,  the  poor  in  the \neconomy will bear a $7-million loss and the poor among beneficiaries will gain $42 million. Thus, \nthe net economic effect on the poor will be $35 million. For the next 20 years, the Project will \nbring  about  economic  effects  worth  $62.4  million,  and  the  poor  will  receive  $35.0  million.  \nThe poverty impact ratio of the Project is 0.55, indicating that 55% of the net project benefits will \nbe  received  by  the  poor.  The  poor  are  likely  to  benefit  from  the  Project  more  than  this  result \nimplies, since the marginal benefit of additional spending on health would be larger for the poor \nthan for the nonpoor. For example, a marginal mortality rate reduction due to the intervention is \nlikely  to  be  larger  for  the  poor,  given  their  current  mortality  rate  is  higher  than  that  of  the \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\n Appendix 11 \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nnonpoor. Since the poor are exempt from user fees, the economic cost is borne less by the poor \nthan the estimate assumes. \n \nC. \n \n12. \nThe gross domestic product growth rate at current prices is assumed to be constant at \n10%,  and  the  Government  budget  as  a  proportion  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  to  be \naround  16%  from  FY2006  to  FY2013.  The  proportion  of  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural \nDevelopment, and Cooperatives (MOLGRDC) to total government expenditure is assumed to be \nconstant  at  8.6%,  LGD  to  MOLGRDC  expenditures  to  be  87.0%,  and  grants  to  autonomous \nbodies  to  LGD  expenditures  to  be  21.0%.  As  a  result  of  the  Project,  there  will  be  a  recurrent \ncost  implication  after  the  implementation  period.  To  sustain  urban  PHC  services,  the  funding \nsource  should  be  shifted  from  the  annual  development  program  to  the  current  expenditure \nbudget.  Continuation  of  partnership  agreements  will  require  an  estimated  $10.5  million,  and \nsalary  for  partnership  agreement  management  staff,  approximately  $0.6  million  a  year, \nconsidering  inflation.  Similarly,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the  buildings  and \nyears.  \nequipment  procured  under \nThe Government needs to provide at least an additional $11.1 million to its current expenditure \nto sustain urban PHC  in 2012/13 and $11.7 million thereafter. \n \nSufficient  funds  for  additional  recurrent  costs  can  be  secured  in  two  ways:  (i)  by  using \n13. \npart  of  the  increments  in  LGD  current  expenditure  budget  in  2004\u20132013,  estimated  at  \nTk6.7 billion ($112 million); and (ii) by using increments in LGD grants to autonomous bodies to \nfinance  urban  PHC.  Such  increments  in  2012/13  are  estimated  at  TK1.5  billion  ($25  million), \nwhich are to be shared by more than 300 municipalities. Funds for urban PHC may be secured \nout  of  the  estimated  LGD  grants  in  2012/13  by  allocating  Tk0.6  billion  ($11.1  million)  of  the \nincrements to the local governments that provide urban PHC as an addition to their budget, and \nsharing the remaining Tk0.9 billion ($14.9 million) equally among all municipalities. The cost of \nO&M  of  buildings  and  equipment  every  5  years  is  likely  to  be  met  by  the  income  from  urban \nPHC services. During project implementation, local governments will be encouraged to recover \n15% of the partnership agreement cost through user charges, and the income from the services \nwill  be  retained  by  the  local  governments  (see  assurance  on  user-fee  retention).  The  user \ncharges  will  allow  the  local  governments  to  obtain  $1.6  million  per  year,  and  the  income  will \naccumulate to $8.0 million after 5 years. This will be sufficient to finance the cost of the annual \ndevelopment program. Based on the above analysis, an assurance has been obtained from the \nGovernment that it will develop a fiscal model for urban PHC provision (see assurance) that will \nlead to sustained funding of the urban PHC initiative. \n\nrequire  $0.6  million  every  5 \n\nthe  Project \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n47  \n\n \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\nIntroduction \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nA.  \n \nIn compliance with Asian Development Bank (ADB) environmental requirements, an initial \n1. \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  was  conducted  for  the  Project,  which  is  classified  under \nenvironmental  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Operations  Manual  Section  F1/OP. \nSubcomponents  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  show  no  significant  environmental  impacts. \nProject  activities  that  may  have  a  marginal  effect,  and  the  main  mitigation  measures  proposed, \nare  summarized  here.  Overall,  the  project  is  expected  to  result  in  substantial  environmental \nbenefits. The IEE is in agreement with ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines (2003) and Bangladesh\u2019s \nlaws  and  regulations  (Supplementary  Appendix  G).  The  summary  IEE  summarizes  the \nenvironmental  issues,  mitigation  measures,  institutional  arrangements,  and  environmental \nmonitoring plan.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe Project will provide primary health care (PHC) to unserved urban populations with a \nspecial focus on areas of poverty and bad environmental quality. The Project continues the model \npioneered by the first urban primary health care project (UPHCP-I), under which service providers \nwere  contracted  to  deliver  an  agreed-on  essential  service  package  (ESP)  through  partnership \nagreements  to  service  areas.  The  Project  will  provide  PHC  by  contracting-out  services  to \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) and provide PHC infrastructure and environmental health \nfacilities.  The  Project  will  construct  at  least  50  new  PHC  centers,  14  new  comprehensive \nreproductive health care (CRHC) centers and upgrade 4 PHC centers to CRHC centers. It will be \nimplemented over 6.5 years, beginning in July 2005. Rented accommodation will be reviewed for \nsuitability  as  clinics,  and  new  land  will  be  required  for  construction.  The  specifics  are  still  to  be \ndetermined.  The  Project  will:  (i)  support  the  construction  of  at  least  four  community  toilets  with \nbathing  and  urinal  facilities  in  each  partnership  area;  (ii) support  pilot  community-based  solid \nwaste  management  through  community  mobilization  and  provision  of  dustbins  and  collection \ntrolleys;  and  (iii)  support  municipalities  to  improve  clinical  waste  management  by  formulating \nclinical waste management plans, providing training, and supplying waste segregation equipment \n(bins) in health care facilities.  \n \nC. \n \n3. \nBangladesh  is  flat,  except  for  the  hills  along  its  eastern  borders,  and  is  vulnerable  to \nmassive  flooding.  Urban  infrastructure  is  inadequate  for  the  present  and  future  population  and \nindustrial  requirements.  Less  than  50%  of  Dhaka\u2019s  solid  waste  is  collected,  and  the  country\u2019s \nwastes  are  expected  to  rise  by  eight  to  ten  times  by  2020.  The  city\u2019s  sewerage  system  covers \nonly one third of its area, and 30% of the capital\u2019s people use either open latrines or none at all. \nOnly half the people who live in cities have access to safe water, and urban demand for water is \nexpected  to  rise  over  six  times  by  2020.  The  subproject  sites  have  no  significant  vegetation, \nsteep slopes, or flood-prone areas. Endangered species and other wildlife are not affected. Some \nsites lie within low to moderate earthquake zones. The project area has no cultural heritage sites. \n \nD. \n \n4. \nLocation. PHC centers need to be close to slums and other areas inhabited by the urban \npoor. However, scarcity of land and pressure to accept donated land sometimes leads to facilities \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nbeing  located  far  from  urban  poor  areas.  Although  medical  facilities  are  small  and  will  not \nnecessarily involve dislocation of inhabitants, in some cases squatters may be evicted, for whom \nadequate rehabilitation and resettlement safeguards will be need. Resettlement will be minimal, \nand any involuntary resettlements that occur will be mitigated in accordance with the measures \nstipulated  under  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  the  Handbook  on  Resettlement:  \nA Guide to Good Practice. Before finalizing site selection, the project management unit (PMU) will \ndelineate  the  partnership  areas  and  their  estimated  population  using  existing  maps.  This  will \nenable  the  proposed  location  of  PHC  centers  to  be  checked  against  potential  demand  and  the \nwalking distance for the urban poor users to be estimated. The ground floors will be higher than \nthe flood level identified using data from the past 5 years. The sites will also receive sufficient fill \nto bring them above 30 centimeters above the surrounding land for rain runoff. \n \n5. \nDesign  and  Construction.  Existing  CRHC  center  facilities  do  not  have  hand  basins  in \nwards,  showers  for  in-patients,  stretcher  access  between  operating  theatres  or  recovery  wards \nand the general wards on the floor above, or laundry rooms. No major construction impacts are \nforeseen  given  that  buildings  are  small.  Site  construction  activities  such  as  digging  of  drains  or \nlandfill site landscaping will generate dust, noise, and vibration that will affect workers on site and \nthe  nearby  population,  while  soil  erosion  may  result  from  land  preparation.  To  mitigate  these \nimpacts,  dust  suppression  techniques  such  as  water  sprays,  covered  wagons  and  skips  will  be \nused,  working  hours  agreed,  plant  and  equipment  with  low  operating  noise  levels  used,  and \nexcavation and land leveling works limited during the rainy season. No construction camps will be \nnecessary.  Measures  will  be  taken  for  the  following:  (i)  site  stabilization,  erosion,  and  runoff;  \n(ii)  dust  and  noise  suppression;  (iii)  management  of  traffic  and  utilities;  and  (iv)  worker  safety. \nGood  health  and  hygiene  practices  at  work  and  measures  to  prevent  work  accidents  will  be \nachieved through an occupational health and safety plan (OHSP), which will include emergency \nplans, personnel basic training, and first aid provisions. \n \n6. \nThe following provisions will be considered at the design stage to strengthen existing and \nproposed project facilities: (i) monitoring of on-site drinking water quality; (ii) provision of mosquito \nand  fly  screens  to  all  window  and  door  openings;  (iii)  provision  of  wash  basins  in  examination \nrooms; (iv) provision of showers for patients and laundry rooms in CRHC centers; (v) provision of \nstorage cabinets with smooth surfaces and doors; (vi) where noise and/or fumes reach operation \nand  recovery  rooms  of  CRHC  centers,  fitting  of  plastic-framed  double-glazed  windows,  and  air \nconditioners;  (vii) use  of  high-quality  material  during  construction;  and  (viii)  appropriate  septic \ntank and sanitation scheme selection. \n \nClinical  Waste.  Environmental  impacts  mainly  derive  from  handling,  collection,  storage, \n7. \nsegregation,  and  treatment  and  disposal  of  medical  waste.  Medical  waste  includes  common \nwaste  and  special  waste  (sharps  and  infectious,  pathological,  pharmaceutical,  genotoxic, \nchemical,  heavy-metal-containing,  and  radioactive  waste).  Medical  solid  waste\u2014glassware, \nsyringes,  dressings,  bandages,  plasters,  plastic  syringes,  and  test  swabs\u2014accounts  for  \n10\u201315%  of  clinics\u2019  total  solid  waste.  Most  clinics  have  limited  resources  for  waste  disposal  and \ngenerally  suffer  from:    (i)  inappropriate  technology;  (ii)  lack  of  training  and  awareness  among \nstaff; (iii) high cost of treatment systems; and (iv) limited space for on-site treatment and disposal, \ntreatment  and  disposal \nwhich  highlights \narrangements.  Although  health  providers  generally  know  that  medical  waste  needs  to  be \nseparated from conventional waste, it is usually taken to landfill sites and mixed with other waste \nor  burned  in  open  land.  Liquid  clinical  waste  is  discharged  untreated  and  health  centers  lack \nbasic wastewater facilities.  \n \n\nimplement  city-wide  collection, \n\nthe  need \n\nto \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n49  \n\n8. \nClinical  infectious  waste  (CIW)  release  has  an  important  impact  on  the  environment. \nAlthough  CIW  from  all  hospitals,  clinics,  and  laboratories  is  a  small  proportion  of  overall  solid \nwastes,  it  is  extremely  hazardous.  CIW  is  often  mixed  with  normal  solid  wastes  at  medical \nfacilities  and  taken  to  the  city  dumps.  All  dumps  are  uncontrolled;  there  are  no  properly \nengineered dumps or sanitary landfills. Waste pickers and animals roam the dumps, and are at \nhigh  risk  of  contracting  disease.  Used  syringes,  tubes,  and  bags  are  sold  by  scavengers  and \nhospital staff members to dealers who repackage and sell them as new to medical facilities and to \ndrug users. Some project cities have begun clinical waste management (CWM) programs, which \nwill  be  supported  under  the  Project  for  selected  town  and  cities.  The  CWM  plans  will  address \nhandling  and  collection,  storage,  segregation,  treatment,  and  disposal  of  medical  waste  at  the \nmunicipal  level.  They  will  include  an  analysis  of  clinical  waste  generation  and  facility \nmanagement, and examine alternative options for transport, treatment and disposal, institutional \nand  financing  arrangements,  and  initial  awareness-raising.  Training  will  be  provided  under  the \nProject to health workers and communities. \n \n9. \nShort-term measures to improve CWM in the project clinics will include:  (i) designation of \na  person  in  charge  of  waste  management  in  each  clinic;  (ii)  regular  training  for  all  staff;  \n(iii) provision of color-coded, covered receptacles in strategic positions for separate categories of \nwaste; (iv) daily internal collection and storage of containers within the clinic compound, which will \nbe in a fenced, secured area; (v) collection and transportation of clinical waste containers by the \ncity  corporation  and  municipal  conservancy  department,  and  burial  in  separate  pits  for  different \nwastes in a fenced, secured area of the municipal dumpsite; (vi) return of containers and invoice \nof  services  to  the  clinic,  and  (vii)  cleansing  of  containers  by  the  clinic.  An  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) plan and schedule will be prepared for each center, specifying environmental \nmonitoring  tasks  (e.g.,  regular  cleaning  of  external  perimeter  drains,  ensuring  that  they  are \nconnected to off-site drains), frequency of monitoring, responsibilities, and costs. The O&M plan \nwill be incorporated into the partnership agreements, and monitored as part of the assessment of \npartners\u2019 performance.  \n \n10. \nOperational  Maintenance.  Community  toilets  will  be  fitted  with  suitably  designed  septic \ntanks  or  sewerage  connections.  Regular  maintenance  will  ensure  appropriate  functioning  of  the \nschemes and prevent pests, disease vectors, and odors. Proper construction, regular collection, \nand maintenance of dustbins will be necessary to ensure there are no visual or odor disturbances \nto neighboring areas, and to repel rodents and insects, which carry diseases.  \n \n11. \nthe  Neighborhood  Environment.  \nThe partnership agreements will include a clause requiring partners to work with city corporations \nand  municipalities  to  help  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  to  set  up  community \nconservancy  activities  to:  (i)  clean  neighborhood  areas,  (ii)  establish  a  water  surveillance  and \nmonitoring  program,  and  (iii)  provide  awareness-raising  and  training  in  personal  and  household \nhygiene.  These  will  be  led  by  the  city  corporations,  municipalities,  and  CBOs,  but  partners  will \nhelp set up the arrangements and provide guidance on environmental health. \n \nE. \n \n12. \nTechnical  and  institutional  mitigation  measures  will  be  incorporated  into  the  detailed \ndesign  of  the  Project.  Planning,  functional,  institutional,  and  procedural  measures  have  to  be \nincluded  in  the  site  selection  criteria,  in  the  tender  documents,  and  in  the  OHSP.  Mitigation \nmeasures  related  to  construction  work  must  be  specified  in  the  contract  with  the  contractor.  \nThe  PMU  in  the  Local  Government  Division  (LGD)  of  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural \nDevelopment  and  Cooperatives  (MOLGRDC),  and  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  in  the \n\nInstitutional Requirements, Environmental Monitoring Plan, and Cost Estimates \n\nExtension  of  Health  Services \n\nInclude \n\nto \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nmunicipalities will be responsible for monitoring and enforcement during construction. During the \noperational  phase,  municipal  authorities,  helped  by  LGD,  will  be  responsible  for  implementing \nenvironmental  measures  in  medical  waste  management.  The  LGD  will  obtain  relevant \nenvironmental  clearances  from  the  Department  of  Environment  before  it  implements  any  civil \nworks.  The  department  will  oversee  environmental  compliance  and  environmental  monitoring. \nADB review missions will assess environmental compliance in the different towns. \n \n13. \nAn  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedure  has  been  prepared  to  facilitate \ncompliance  of  urban  PHC  infrastructure  and  environmental  health  subprojects  with  the \nenvironmental  requirements  of  the  Government  and  ADB.  Careful  screening  of  potential \nsubprojects  based  on  environmental  criteria  will  be  included  in  the  environmental  assessment \nreview  framework  prepared  by  the  PMU\u2019s  environmental  section  in  collaboration  with  the  town \noffice. LGD will prepare a full environmental assessment report on selected subprojects, including \npublic consultation and an environmental monitoring plan with specific mitigation measures, as a \nprerequisite for approval of credit. A monitoring program will ensure that the subprojects have no \nmajor  adverse  environmental  impacts.  The  environmental  criteria  for  site  selection  and  the \ndetailed environmental assessment and review procedures for landfill subprojects are in the IEE. \n \n14. \nThe  Project  has  a  national  steering  committee.  A  conservancy  committee  should  be \nestablished  at  the  city  corporation  and  municipality  level  to  oversee  solid  waste  management \n(including medical wastes). A hygiene manager should be appointed in each health care center, \nwith  powers  to  oversee  building  repairs  (related  to  hygiene),  facility  hygiene  and  waste \nmanagement  operations,  training  and  supervision  of  nurses  and  janitors,  and  coordination  with \nthe  city  conservancy  department,  and  with  city  and  private  sector  CWM  operators.  Costs  of \nadjusting the prototype facility designs and the hygiene and logistical upgrades to the UPHCP-I \nfacilities  are  incorporated  in  the  main  project  costs.  Costs  of  the  environmental  mitigation  and \nmonitoring plan are estimated at $313,000.  \n \nF.  \n \n15. \nFormal  and  informal  consultation  exercises  were  undertaken  during  project  preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  preparation.  They  covered  more  than  150  households  (slum  dwellers, \npeople  likely  to  be  affected  by  the  Project,  and  likely  beneficiaries)  in  various  municipalities; \nNGOs;  central  and  local  government  agencies;  and  medical  facilities.  Public  consultations  will \ncontinue  throughout  the  Project  and  will  play  an  important  role  in  the  design  of  civil  works.  \nThe  Government  will  provide  information  on  the  Project\u2019s  environmental  issues  in  a  form  and \nlanguage  suitable  to  the  population.  The  environmental  specialist  will  consult  with  groups  to \nexplain  the  financial  and  nonfinancial  costs  and  benefits  of  proposed  measures  to  mitigate \nenvironmental harm caused by medical waste. \n \nG. \n \n16. \nThe  overall  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  positive.  It  will  significantly  improve  the  overall \nenvironmental quality of the participating secondary towns. The Project is considered to have no \nsignificant  environmental  impacts;  classification  B  is  appropriate.  Therefore  an  environmental \nimpact assessment is not deemed necessary. \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n51  \n\nRESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n\nProject Background and Description \n\n \nA. \n \nThe Second Urban Primary Health Care Project (the Project) addresses the unmet need \n1. \nfor  primary  health  care  (PHC)  in  urban  areas  of  Bangladesh,  especially  among  the  poor.  \nThe Project will finance 64 civil works subprojects: 50 PHC and 14 comprehensive reproductive \nhealth  care (CRHC)  centers  in  all  six  city  corporations  and five  municipalities.  The Project  will \nsupport  the  purchase  of  12  apartments  for  PHC  centers  in  Dhaka,  and  upgrading  of  4  PHC \ncenters  to  CRHC  centers;  neither  activity  involves  resettlement.  Fifty  community  toilets  will  be \nconstructed  in  the  slums  of  the  project  area.  The  health  facilities  to  be  constructed  under  the \nProject  are  designed  for  land-scarce  urban  settings.  The  total  land  requirement  under  the \nProject will be approximately 3 hectares.1  \n \nNo involuntary resettlement is expected as a result of the Project.2  As in the first Urban \n2. \nPrimary  Health  Care  Project  (UPHCP-I),  under  which  128  facilities  were  constructed  on \nunoccupied government and donated land, almost all the construction under the Project will be \ndone  on  unoccupied  government  or  donated  land.  However,  a  contingency  is  provided  for  \n25  project-affected  people  in  the  six  city  corporations  and  five  municipalities.  In  the \nmunicipalities,  five  CRHC  and  25  PHC  centers  will  be  constructed.  A  short  resettlement  plan \nhas been prepared for the six city corporations. It will serve as a model for addressing potential \nresettlement issues in the subprojects of five municipalities (Supplementary Appendix I).3  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  legislation  governing  land  acquisition  for  public  purposes  is  the  Acquisition  and \nRequisition  of  Immovable  Property  Ordinance  (Ordinance  II  of  1982)  and  its  amendments  in \n1993  and  1994.  The  ordinance  is  the  only  law  that  governs  all  cases  of  acquisition  and \nrequisition by the Government of immovable property (land, crops, and built structures) for any \npublic  purpose  or  in  the  public  interest.  The  ordinance  does  not  cover  project-affected  people \nwithout  title  or  ownership  records,  such  as  informal  settlers  or  squatters.  In  most  cases,  \nthe compensation does not constitute the market or replacement value of the property acquired.  \nIn  the  absence  of  a  Government  policy  consistent  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \npolicies  on  involuntary  resettlement,  poverty  reduction,  and  social  development,  a  project-\nspecific  resettlement  policy  framework  and  resettlement  procedure  guidelines  will  be  adopted. \nThe framework and guidelines in this appendix will apply to all subprojects to be prepared and \napproved  under  the  Project.  It  will  ensure  that  people  affected  by  land  acquisition  who \npermanently  or  temporarily  lose  their  livelihoods  will  be  eligible  for  appropriate  compensation \nunder the Project.  \n \n\nResettlement Policy Framework  \n\n                                                 \n1  These  primary  health  care  (PHC)  centers  will  have  two  floors  and  the  CRHC  center  will  have  four.  The  land       \n\nrequirement for each facility will be less than 200 square meters . \n\n2  During  first  Urban  Primary  Health  Care  Project  (UPHCP-I)  no  resettlement  was  required  to  build  the  128  project \n\nbuildings. In the six city corporations no resettlement is expected. \n\n3  During  project  implementation,  the  Local  Government  Division  (LGD)  will  prepare  each  subproject  resettlement \nplan in accordance  with the resettlement planning principles set out in the resettlement framework and the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  to  the  satisfaction  of  ADB.  Provisions  have  been \nincluded  to  help  restore  living  standards  of  the  project-affected  people  to  the  pre-project  levels  or  better.  \nAs detailed designs are finalized and approved, LGD, city corporations, and municipalities  will revise and update \nthe resettlement plan. All households will be compensated at full replacement cost and current market value. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\n Appendix 13 \n\nResettlement Procedural Guidelines \n\nThe resettlement policy framework reflects the Government\u2019s land acquisition laws and \n4. \nregulations and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  guidelines.  It  stipulates  eligibility \nand provisions for all types of losses (land, crop, trees, fish, structures, business, employment, \nwork  days,  wages,  and  social  infrastructure).  Land  for  land  will  not  be  feasible  because \nreplacement land is not available. Lost livelihood will be compensated at full replacement cost, \nwhich  will  help  the  project-affected  people  to  rehabilitate  themselves.  Project-affected \nhouseholds  compensated  by  the  district  deputy  commissioner  for  lost  assets  will  receive:  \n(i) a cash grant to match the replacement market value; and (ii) other resettlement assistance \nsuch as allowance and compensation for loss of business, work days, and income because of \ndislocation. Households headed by females, and other vulnerable households will be eligible for \ncash  assistance  to  relocate  and  to  reconstruct  houses  or  structures.  Table  A13.2  shows  the \nmeasures  adopted  in  the  resettlement  plan  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  to  bridge  the \ngap  between  the  ADB  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  the  Government  policy  on  land \nacquisition, and assessment and valuation of acquired property. \n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe short resettlement plan for the six city corporations is in Supplementary Appendix I. \nThere  are  specific  resettlement  procedural  guidelines  to  guide  the  preparation  of  resettlement \nplans  that  will  be  adequate  for  the  magnitude  of  land  acquisition  for  subsequent  subprojects. \nThe resettlement procedure guidelines require: (i) an initial social assessment survey by Local \nGovernment  Division  (LGD)  once  the  scope  of  each  subproject  is  identified,  based  on \npreliminary technical designs; and (ii) a short resettlement plan (as subproject impacts are not \nsignificant).  Since  the  resettlement  impact  of  the  subprojects  will  be  minimal,  approval  will  be \naccorded  only  for  resettlement  category-B  subprojects  and  only  during  the  project  period.  \nThe  short  resettlement  plan  must,  however,  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary \nresettlement and other social safeguard guidelines. \n \nThe following safeguards will be applied to government and donated land: (i) consulting \n6. \nfully on site selection with any project-affected people without titles; (ii) ensuring that voluntary \ndonations  do  not  severely  affect  the  living  standards  of  the  project-affected  people  and  are \nlinked directly to benefits for them, with community-sanctioned measures to replace any losses \nthat they agree to verbally and in writing; (iii) confirming any voluntary donation through verbal \nand  written  records  verified  by  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  consultants;  and  \n(iv)  putting  in  place  adequate  grievance  redress  systems.  Where  projects  directly  benefit \ncommunities and are amenable to a local decision-making process, arrangements to deal with \nlosses on a transparent, voluntary basis may be included in resettlement plans, with appropriate \nsafeguards. \n \nD. \n \nThe Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development, and Cooperatives, through LGD \n7. \nhas  overall  coordination,  planning, \nresponsibilities.  \nAn experienced NGO and/or resettlement specialist with clearly defined tasks will be engaged to \nimplement  the  plans.  A  senior  project  management  unit  officer  or  executive  engineer  will  be \nappointed  as  chief  resettlement  officer  to  supervise  implementation  with  the  help  of  existing \nLGD, city corporation, and municipality community organizers at the city and municipality level. \nThe NGO and/or consultant will liaise with LGD and the contractor to assist the project-affected \npeople, especially women and other vulnerable people, to find jobs during construction. In the \ncontractor  contracts,  LGD  will  include  a  provision  for  preferential  employment  of  qualified \nproject-affected people, including women. \n\nInstitutional Responsibilities and Resettlement Cost \n\nimplementation,  and \n\nfinancing \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n53  \n\nDisclosure, Consultation, and Grievances \n\n \n8. \nLGD will ensure that the resettlement plans adhere to the resettlement policy framework \nand resettlement procedure guidelines so that appropriate entitlements and mitigation measures \nare  established.  LGD  will  ensure  that  the  resettlement  budgets  are  delivered  on  time  to  the \ndeputy  commissioner\u2019s  office  and  the  implementing  NGO  and/or  consultant  for  timely \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  plan.  A  resettlement  contingency  provision  of  $200,000, \nincluding  physical  contingencies,  is  allocated  under  the  costing  for  any  possible  resettlement \ncontingency in the project area. The Government will provide the funds for land acquisition and \nresettlement. The funds will be released through the deputy commissioners' offices for acquired \nproperties,  whereas  all  other  additional  benefits  will  be  paid  directly  by  the  LGD  through  the \nimplementing NGO and/or consultant. \n \nE. \n \n9. \nEach resettlement plan will be prepared and implemented in close consultation with the \nstakeholders  and  will  involve  focus  group  discussions  and  meetings,  particularly  with  the \nproject-affected  people.  The  resettlement  policy  framework  will  be  made  available  in  Bangla \nduring village focus group meetings. Copies of draft resettlement plans will be distributed among \ncommunity  groups  to  obtain  their  inputs  before  finalizing  the  detailed  design,  and  after  the \nsocioeconomic survey to avoid fraudulent claims. Complaints and grievance procedures will be \noutlined  in  each  resettlement  plan,  and  grievance  redress  committees  will  be  established  for \neach  subproject,  with  representatives  from  LGD,  project-affected  people,  women  and  other \nvulnerable groups, local governments, and NGOs. The chief resettlement officer, or authorized \nperson nominated by the officer, will chair the grievance redress committee. Other than disputes \nrelating  to  ownership  rights,  the  committee  will  review  grievances  involving  all  resettlement \nbenefits,  relocation,  and  relevant  assistance.  Grievances  will  be  redressed  within  2\u20134  weeks \nfrom the date the complaint was lodged. \n \nF. \n \n10. \nLGD  will  establish  a  monitoring  system  involving  LGD  and  implementing  staff,  and \nprepare  progress  reports  on  all  aspects  of  land  acquisition,  compensation,  and  resettlement \nactivities. LGD will report to ADB on land acquisition and resettlement in the quarterly progress \nreports.  An  independent  monitoring  and  evaluation  firm  will  monitor  implementation  of \nresettlement plans. \n \nG. \n \n11. \n\nThe entitlement matrix given in Table A13.1 will be followed: \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nEntitlement Matrix \n\nType of Loss  Application \n\nEntitlements \n\n \nTable A13. 1: Entitlement Matrix \n\nExpected \nResults \n\nDefinition of \nProject-\naffected \nPeople \nLegal owners \nof land \n\nLand  \n\nCash compensation under law by deputy \ncommissioner, by category and use of land; \nadditional cash grant to match the market or \nreplacement value, to be determined by LGD \nthrough an independent valuation advisory team; \nrefund of registration cost incurred for \nreplacement land purchase within stipulated time  \n\nReplacement of \nagriculture land, \nhomestead, or \ncommercial land \nor the value to \nthe project-\naffected people  \n\nContinued on next page \n\n1.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n Yes \n \n No \n\n \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?  \n\n \n Yes \n \n No \n\nContribution of the subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \n \nCatastrophic health shocks leading to hospitalization are an important dimension of vulnerability and impoverishment. \nThe poor pay a significant share of their income for health services. However, their health status is substantially lower \nthan  the  national  average,  and  their  access  to  health  services  is  marginal.  Only  in  the  last  decade  have  the \nGovernment  and  donors  started  addressing  urban  primary  health  care\u2014an  area  that  continues  to  be  neglected  in \nother countries of South Asia. The interim-poverty reduction strategy identifies reduction of human poverty, including \nimproving  access  and  quality  of  primary  health  care  (PHC)  to  the  poor,  as  a  key  priority  for  poverty  reduction. \nThe poverty reduction partnership agreement between the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government, and \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  identify  primary  health  as  a  key  area  for  Government  and  ADB  interventions. \nThe Bangladesh health  policy (2000) stressed the  need for expanding  health services in urban areas,  especially for \nthe poor. However, only 5.3% of Government expenditure relates to health, most of it targeted at the rural poor while \nthe urban poor\u2019s health needs are largely unmet by public interventions. \n\n \n\nThe  Project  will  address  many  of  the  concerns  relating  to  PHC  for  the  urban  poor  by  strengthening  and  expanding \npublic health services in urban areas. The Project will include new urban areas that have little or no access to publicly \nprovided urban PHC. The Project will focus on PHC, which mainly benefits the poor and the urban population with no \naccess to PHC services. Health centers  will be established near urban slums  with and will concentrate on the poor. \nThe partnership agreement with nongovernment organizations (NGOs) will require at least 30% of their services to be \nprovided to the poor. The partnership agreement will require targeting specific groups such as casual laborers, street \nvendors, rickshaw and van pullers, garbage collectors, maid servants, street sweepers, commercial sex workers, etc. \nPHC  will  cover  diseases  such  as  diarrhea  and  tuberculosis  (TB),  which  usually  affect  the  poor  and  vulnerable. \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  improve  the  health  of  at  least  14  million  people  living  in  six  city  corporations  and  five \nmunicipalities by helping provide an essential package of health services. \n\n \nB.     Poverty Analysis                                                                         Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n         \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe urban economy is driven by the growth of the overall national economy, which is, in turn, linked inescapably to the \nvagaries of the world economy. Bangladesh has recently benefited from globalization. However, the country is volatile \nas  it  adjusts  to  global  changes  and  this  will  be  reflected  first  of  all  in  the  urban  economy.  Changes  as  a  result  of \nglobalization will push people into poverty as well as taking them out of it. The absolute number of households below \nthe poverty line is falling in rural areas, but increasing in urban areas. This is mainly due to migration of the poor from \nrural  to  urban  areas  in  search  of  jobs.  Most  of  these  rural  migrants  settle  in  urban  slums  or  become  homeless  or \nsquatters.  \n \nThere is abundant evidence of the strong and dynamic relationship between poverty and health.  This is particularly \nacute  when  rural  migrants  do  not  have  the  traditional  support  structures  of  social  networks  and  kinship  and  live  in \nunhygienic conditions. Providing the poor with social services alone is not enough. Most users of the services provided \nby the first Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP-I) were either low- or middle-income urban households. Most \npoor pregnant women in slums continued to give birth at home, increasing the risk of maternal mortality and morbidity. \nHowever, the number of users of weekly satellite clinics in slums can be improved through community mobilization in \nslum  areas.  In  slums  and  squatter  settlements,  mini-clinics  will  need  to  operate  at  night  to  cater  to  the  needs  of \nworking  women.  Discussions  with  the  urban  poor,  health  service  providers,  and  partner  NGOs  indicate  that  use  of \nhealth  services  by  the  urban  poor  is  influenced,  among  others,  by:  (i)  lack  of  money,  (ii)  lack  of  information  on \navailable  health  services,  (iii)  cost  of  health  services,  (iv)  distance  to  the  health  facilities,  (v)  inflexible  hours  of  the \nhealth  facilities,  (vi)  social  prejudice  against  modern  and  established  health  facilities,  (vii)  dependence  on \nneighborhood drug stores, and (vii) reliance on traditional medicine.  \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n57  \n\nThe  Project  will  support  operational  research  on  the  urban  poor  to  aid  design  of  effective  strategies  to  benefit  them \nthrough  PHC  services.  The  project  NGOs  will  be  encouraged  to  devise  approaches  and  procedures  to  expand \nservices in slums and areas with many urban poor. The contract establishing the partnership agreement with NGOs \nwill  include  specific  provisions  to  ensure  inclusion  of  the  poor  as  project  beneficiaries  (Appendix  4).  Measures  to \nimprove  pro-poor  targeting  include:  (i)  baseline  survey  and  identification  of  the  urban  poor  in  the  project  areas, \nmapping of the potential target population, and introduction of entitlement cards; (ii) identification of constraints faced \nby the urban poor in accessing health services; (iii) promotion of basic health services daily in slums; (iv) community \nsocial mobilization activities to develop health awareness in slums; (v) social marketing to increase demand for health \nservices  among  the  poor  living  in  slums;  (vi)  increasing  the  number  of  trained  community  organizers  and  health \nvolunteers; (vii) facility-level health committees in slums and low-income urban areas for monitoring health services to \nthe  poor,  and  representation  of  the  poor  on  the  committees;  (viii)  involvement  of  the  ward  commissioners, \nrepresentatives  of  NGOs  and  civil  society,  and  the  poor  communities  in  monitoring  health  services  to  the  poor; \n(ix) setting  up  targets  for  NGO  outreach  workers  to  mobilize  the  poor  to  access  to  health  services;  (x)  independent \nmonitoring to review access and quality of services to the poor; and (xi) an orientation program for all PHC providers \nto increase the understanding of the poor and planning of health services to the poor. \n \nTo  improve  hygiene  in  the  project  area,  community  toilets  and  bathing  facilities  will  be  established  for  the  poor. \nThe Project  will support community  waste  management efforts to reduce the amount of general  waste, especially in \nslums  and  low-income  areas.  The  project  activities  on  behavior  change,  communications,  and  marketing  will  create \ndemand for PHC services among the poor. The campaign will address some of the sociocultural factors that prevent \nthe poor, especially women and children, from accessing social services. The monitoring of PHC services will include \nrecords  of  poor  patients  seeking  services,  and  patients  will  be  disaggregated  by  income.  Mechanisms  for  regular \nmonitoring  of  quality  of  health  services  and  access  to  health  services  for  the  poor  will  be  institutionalized  in \nneighborhood and ward committees. Experiences in mobilizing the urban poor to access health services will feed into \nthe  development  of  operational  models  that  will  serve  as  the  basis  for  expanding  approaches  to  other  urban  areas. \nThe Project will convey its front-line experience into higher-level discussions to make sure that adequate mechanisms \nare created for the voice of the poor to be heard in the higher-level structures. Ensuring the accountability of the health \nservice providers to the poor will be a major priority for the Project.  \n\nC.     Participation Process \n\n \n\n \n No  \n\n No \n\n Yes \n\n Yes \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nA  stakeholder  analysis  was  conducted  as  part  of  the  feasibility  study.  The  study  helped  to  identify  key  project \nstakeholders and to plan the project activities. Primary stakeholders include selected staff from the Ministry of Local \nGovernment,  Rural  Development,  and  Cooperatives;  Ministry  of  Health  and  Family  Welfare;  project  implementation \nunit  of  the  UPHPC-I;  NGOs  involved  in  the  UPHCP-I;  donor  consortium;  community-based  organizations; \nrepresentatives and officers of city corporations and municipalities; and representatives of the poor and of vulnerable \ngroups.  Stakeholders  include  relevant  line  ministries  and  other  private  providers  of  health  services.  During  project \nimplementation,  participatory  processes  will  be  incorporated  into  mapping  target  beneficiaries  from  urban  slum  and \nlow-income areas, and into monitoring health services through the neighborhood and ward health committees at the \nhealth facilities. Citizen score cards and routine display of up-to-date public information about staffing, stock, facilities, \nand  fee  rates  will  improve  accountability  of  the  service  providers  and  facilitate  participation  of  service  users  in \nmonitoring services. \n \n \nD.     Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n  \nMaternal mortality is high: with a maternal mortality ratio of 300 per 100,000 live births, the estimated life-time risk of \ndying  from  pregnancy  and  childbirth-related  causes  is  about  100  times  higher  than  in  developed  countries. \nBangladesh  has  traditionally  exhibited  low  rates  of  antenatal  care  and  births  in  health  facilities.  The  proportion  of \npregnant women making at least one antenatal visit has improved to 37% in 2000, which leaves more than 2.5 million \npregnancies  annually  lacking  any  antenatal  care.  Despite  significant  investments  in  basic  and  comprehensive \nessential obstetric care, only 6% of births take place in health facilities. Despite good progress in the last two decades, \ngaps  in  health  service  use  are  evident  in  child  health.  High  rates  of  malnutrition  continue  and  micronutrient \ndeficiencies  remain.  Almost  half  of  the  women  and  78%  of  children  6\u201311  months  old  suffer  from  anemia;  45%  of \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\n Appendix 14 \n\nchildren under 5 years old are short for their age or stunted, while 18% are severely stunted. Bangladesh is far from \nachieving the Millennium Development Goal related to maternal mortality. \nPoor  women  lag  behind  men  in  most  indicators  of  well-being  and  are  disadvantaged  socially  and  economically. \nWomen and adolescent girls suffer coercion, exploitation, and violence. The Project will address all these issues and \nexplore ways to reduce their negative impacts on female health.  \n \nThe UPHCP-I showed that more than 75% of the health service users are  women since most project services  were \ncovered under the essential service package (ESP). Major investments under ESP are for reproductive, maternal, and \nchild health. The Project will focus on reducing the maternal mortality ratio and on promoting child survival and health. \nIt will include activities to increase the number of poor women benefiting from health services, and improve the quality \nof  health  services  to  women  by  increasing  the  number  of  health  facilities  and  access  to  PHC  and  obstetric  care. \nThe  project  facilities  will  provide  choice  of  temporary  and  permanent  contraception  and  reduce  unwanted  deliveries \nand their associated morbidity and mortality. The Project will explore and support the rights of women and girls in this \ncontext as well as develop mechanisms to secure these rights.  \n \nGender Plan. The Project will provide for an elaborate network of PHC and comprehensive reproductive health care \n(CRHC) centers, which will provide basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric care facilities for pregnant women, \nin  addition  to  antenatal  check-ups,  and  will  concentrate  on  extending  these  facilities  to  poor  women  and  girls. \nThe Project will provide legal counseling for women who are abused or under the threat of being abused. It will explore \nways  to  empower  women  to  protect  themselves  from  such  pressures.  At  least  50%  of  the  health  providers  of  the \npartner NGOs will be women, thus the Project will create jobs for women. Using a suitable poverty coverage model, \nthe Project will allocate half its community bathing and toilet facilities to women. The female ward commissioners will \nbe  involved  in  community  programs  to  raise  awareness  about  services  available  in  PHC  and  CRHC  centers.  Other \nforms of structured dialogue with poor women and girls will ensure that the Project is meeting their health needs.  \n \nCommunity health volunteers will include women, especially from poor communities. The volunteers will be trained in \nmotivational and community outreach activities. Sustainable incentive packages for the community volunteers will be \ndeveloped under the partnership agreement. Women community leaders and ward commissioners will be involved in \nplanning  community-based  solid  waste  management.  At  least  30%  of  the  national  project  steering  committee, \nproject  management  unit  (PMU),  and  project  implementation  unit  will  be  women.  Of  the  chairs  of  ward  PHC \ncoordination  committees,  at  least  30%  will  be  women,  and  all  the  committees  will  have  women  members. \nThis  framework  will  be  augmented  by  other  accountability  structures  developed  under  the  Project  to  ensure  that  it \nidentifies and meets the health needs of poor women and girls. Preference will be given to bids from NGO with female \nproject managers. Gender-disaggregated monitoring indicators  will be developed to monitor the number of men and \nwomen  and  patients  served  by  the  health  care  center,  recruitment  of  community  health  workers,  volunteers,  and \ninvolvement of women in the PMU.  \n \nThe  capacity-building  project  components  will  focus  on  strengthening  the  abilities  of  partner  NGOs  and  official \nstructures to deepen the understanding of the characteristics, needs, and dynamics of the urban poor, and to design \neffective  community  services  in  slums.  The  needs  of  women  and  girls  will  be  a  priority.  A  gender  specialist  will  be \nincluded  in  the  consulting  services  package  for  6  person-months,  and  a  full-time  officer  specializing  in  gender  and \npoverty  will  be  in  the  PMU  for  the  whole  project  period.  The  specialist  and  the  officer  will  work  with  the  PMU, \npartnership  agreements,  and  Local  Government  Division  to  turn  the  gender  into  an  action  plan.  The  action  plan  will \ninclude a budget, resources, and implementation schedule, and will be monitored regularly and adjusted accordingly.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n59  \n\n \nE.
