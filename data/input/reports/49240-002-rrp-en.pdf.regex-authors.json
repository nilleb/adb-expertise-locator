THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a (i) proposed loan \nand (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Uch-Kurgan Hydropower Plant \nModernization Project. The report also describes the proposed administration of a loan to be \nprovided by the Eurasian Development Bank (EDB) for the Uch-Kurgan Hydropower Plant \nModernization Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan and grant, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the EDB loan. \n \n2.  The proposed project will replace ageing electrical and mechanical equipment for power \ngeneration and transmission at the Uch-Kurgan hydropower plant (HPP) in the Naryn River \ncascade and undertake silt and sedimentation removal which hinders the proper operation of \nhydromechanical equipment of the HPP. This will (i) increase the availability of clean hydropower \nfor domestic use and potential export to Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, (ii) enhance the integrity of \nhydromechanical structures and, ensure safe and optimal reservoir operation, and (iii) contribute \nto multiyear water supply management from the Naryn River cascade, which is essential for \ndownstream agriculture mainly in Uzbekistan. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The Kyrgyz Republic is rich in hydropower resources, which potentially can generate \nabout 150 terra watt-hour (TWh) electricity per year of which only 10% has been exploited so far. \nFor  2018,  about  80%  of  its  3,920-megawatt  (MW)  electricity  generation  capacity  is  from \nhydropower, and the rest comes from two combined heat and power plants in Bishkek and Osh. \nMost of the country\u2019s hydropower generation comes from the Naryn River cascade, with total \ninstalled capacity of 2,870 MW. \n \n4.  Covering 150 kilometers (km), the Naryn River cascade is the powerhouse of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic; its six HPPs produce 92% of the country\u2019s hydropower supply. The Toktogul HPP built \nin 1975 is the largest of the six plants with 1,200 MW of generation capacity, and the Uch-Kurgan \nHPP built in the early 1960s is the oldest; the other four plants are relatively new. Uch-Kurgan is \n271 km southwest of Bishkek, near the Uzbekistan border. It was the first installation and is used \nas a baseload plant.  \n \n5.  The Uch-Kurgan HPP has an earth fill dam1 and a concrete dam with an outdoor \npowerhouse of 180 MW equipped with four vertical Kaplan turbines\u2014suitable for low head and \nhigh flow rates\u2014of 45 MW each. Since its commercial operations in 1962, no major improvement \nhas ever been undertaken. The HPP is in poor condition, is well past its useful economic and \nfunctional life, and needs immediate major rehabilitation and replacement. Replacing ageing \nequipment and modernizing is urgently needed to maintain the integrity of the power system in \nthe cascade. \n \n6.  Toktogul reservoir, as a multiyear water storage, is crucial in supporting downstream \nagriculture by storing water in wet years and releasing stored water in dry years. However, water \nfrom upstream reservoir could only flow effectively if the  downstream HPP is able to fully \ndischarge. Uch-Kurgan\u2019s reservoir has reduced capacity and operates as a run-of-river2 plant, \nthree of the eight bottom outlet gates are not operational because of sediments. If upstream HPPs \n                                                \n1 Earth fill dam is built by compacting successive layers of earth.   \n2Hydropower is generated by harnessing the energy of falling water or fast running water. Run-of-river hydroelectric \n  \ngeneration plants use the energy of running water and need little or no water storage. \n ", "2 \nspill water it may be unable to pass it on safely to the downstream river, which may cause the \nearth-fill dam to fail and potentially cause damage to the downstream populations in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and Uzbekistan. \n \n7.  In 2001, Kyrgyzenergo, the then-state owned, vertically integrated utility was unbundled \ninto seven distinct companies: a generation company, a transmission company, four electricity \ndistribution  companies,  and  a  district  heating  company.  In  2010,  as  part  of  government\u2019s \nprivatization initiative, some hydropower assets were sold to Chakan GES (being the Russian \nname for Chakan HPP), which was later nationalized. In 2018, the power sector consists of two \ngeneration companies (Open Joint-Stock Companies Electric Power Plants [EPP] and Chakan \nGES); a transmission company; four electricity distribution companies; and a district heating \ncompany. EPP owns and operates both Uch Kurgan and Toktogul HPPs.  \n \n8.  About 45% of the installed generation capacity in the Kyrgyz Republic is reaching end of \nits useful life. Most generation assets were commissioned in the 1970s and 1980s, and lack of \ninvestment in maintenance and repair has resulted in poor service reliability and quality. This is \nespecially  critical  in  winter,  when  the  country  faces  an  increasing  gap  between  available \ngeneration capacity (especially in low-hydrology periods) and growing demand. Rehabilitating the \nUch-Kurgan HPP is the logical next step to maintaining the integrity of the Naryn River cascade \nafter upgrading the Toktogul HPP.3  \n \n9.  Replacing ageing equipment and modernization of power plant will provide potentially up \nto 20% of additional capacity and it is the least-cost option to add new capacity. Supply reliability \n(measured by frequency and duration of outages) and service quality (fluctuations in voltage, \nfrequency,  or  harmonics  that  can  damage  equipment)  are  likely  to  worsen  without  new \ninvestments and are key concerns for the business community.  \n \n10.  With access to adequate reliable power, export and profitability will increase. Kyrgyz \nhydropower plays a critical role in regional energy security. As Central Asia\u2019s clean energy hub, \nthe Kyrgyz Republic supplies 90% of the region\u2019s hydropower. In 1995, the Kyrgyz Republic \nexported more than 2,000 gigawatt-hours to Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan which have \nsince declined to less than half that. As more energy becomes available, Kyrgyz power exports \nare  expected to grow.  Export  of  hydropower  and  corresponding  dollar-denominated  export \nrevenues are crucial to improve financial situation of the sector and offset similar payments for \nimport of power from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan during winter months. \n \n11.  The government\u2019s strategy is to rehabilitate existing power plants and invest in long-term \nexport opportunities such as CASA-1000.4 The project, developed on the principle of exporting \nexcess hydropower in the summer from the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, relies heavily on the \ntimely rehabilitation of the Kyrgyz HPPs. The hydropower export will become even more relevant \nas Central Asia will need more clean energy to reduce its overall carbon footprint to meet \ncommitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.5 \n \n12.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030,  which  highlights  infrastructure \ndevelopment and regional cooperation and integration as major value additions and comparative \n                                                \n3  ADB.

ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2018\u20132022 for the Kyrgyz Republic supports growth \nand economic diversification, improve access to public and social services, and leverage regional \ncooperation.9 It is aligned with the country\u2019s medium-term development program and ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030.10 To achieve broad-based growth, ADB is committed to continuing catalytic energy \ninvestments to raise the efficiency and improve the overall performance of the sector.  \n \n14.  Value Added by ADB Assistance. Since 1996, ADB has led multiple power and district \nheating rehabilitation projects.11 ADB is leading the Naryn cascade rehabilitation through its \nongoing work in Toktogul hydropower rehabilitation where ADB has demonstrated its value in \nattracting quality bids at highly competitive prices. Lessons from previous and ongoing projects \nshow EPP\u2019s competency in implementing projects. However frequent changes in key people, \nproject knowledge confined to few technical staff, and language issues are the main causes of \nproject delays. In this project, ADB value addition includes (i) use of high technology underwater \nscanning of hydromechanical structure to better assess its status; (ii) higher quality due diligence \nin all aspects of project design and standards of environmental safeguard that will mitigate any \nserious risks; (iii) leverage co-financing from EDB; (iv) integrate some gender element in the \nproject design by creating a special program for 10 women engineers to work in the operations \nand maintenance of the plant for two years; (v) ADB is supporting introduction of enterprise \nresource planning across all energy companies and the asset valuation activities are ongoing; \nand (vi) about $95 million (mitigation: $85 million, adaptation: $10 million) of these investments \nwill be attributed to climate financing. In addition, dredging and dam reinforcements will contribute \nto climate resilience.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  The project is aligned with the following impact: operational performance of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic power sector improved, consistent with the state policy on energy security.12 The project \nwill  have  the  following  outcome:  hydropower  generation  from  the  Naryn  River  cascade \nimproved.13 \n \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2018.

Site assessment work included inspection of the four units, of which \nthree have been dewatered; operation testing of an intake gate, the downstream stoplog, a bottom \noutlet service gate, the spillway gate, unit synchronization, and gantry cranes; and inspection of \nthe  main  transformers,  high-voltage  switchyard,  electrical  equipment,  mechanical  auxiliary \nsystems, and control and communication systems. \n \n26.  Due diligence also assessed the condition of the civil structures and dam stability. It found \nthat the structures satisfy HPP operational requirements and that no significant deterioration or \nmovement occurred between 1962-2018, confirming the foundation\u2019s sufficient global strength to \ntake the dam loads. However, the foundation\u2019s hydrogeological condition needs to be improved \nbecause of possible internal erosion caused by underground water pressure. The concrete dam \nsections are stable for all load cases\u2014including seismic load case but excluding the right-bank \nblock, which needs reinforcement\u2014and stability checking calculation has shown that the dam is \nstable. \n \n27.  The project will replace the four turbine-generator units and all associated equipment, \nincluding main transformers; replace or repair the hydromechanical equipment; reinforce the \nconcrete and earth-fill dams\u2019 civil structures; and make all eight bottom outlet gates operational. \nThis will increase unit power output from 45 MW to 54 MW and generating unit rated efficiency \nfrom 88.5% to 93.4%. The plant will continue to operate as a run-of-river hydropower system, and \nthe economic life of the rehabilitated units will be 40 years. \n \n ", "7 \n28.  EPP and the consulting team have prepared technical specifications for the design, \nmanufacture, installation, and commissioning of the new turbine-generator. Companies qualified \nto perform the turnkey contracts are available in the international market. The contractors will \nprovide training for EPP staff on operation and maintenance (O&M). \n \n29.  Preliminary climate risk assessment indicates that potential impacts of climate change on \nthe project include (i) inflow decrease, potentially influencing hydropower generation late in project \ndesign lifetime, and (ii) change in flood regime, potentially affecting spillways and embankments. \nOverall  climate  risk  classification  is  medium.  Proposed  adaptation  measures \ninclude reinforcement of the hydraulic steel structure and spillway, and dredging of sediments. \nAdaptation costs are estimated as $10 million, equivalent to 10% of proposed ADB finance. \n \n30.  The quality of the cost estimates, cost structures, appropriateness of the technology, and \nthe execution plan confirmed the project readiness level as high, and the proposed technical \nsolutions to be more cost-effective than the alternatives. EPP\u2019s O&M staff is familiar with the \nproposed  design  concepts. The  technical  proposals  do  not  represent  a  shift from  existing \npractices, except for the digital control system, which will require specialist training of local staff.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n31.  The economic internal rate of return is calculated at 12.8%, which compares favorably \nwith the 9.0% discount rate. The project\u2019s economic viability takes into account cost-and-benefit \nstreams resulting from the modernization of the Uch-Kurgan HPP and its operation over the \nproject\u2019s life. Without the project, the performance of the existing units will continue to deteriorate, \nand they will eventually cease to operate. The project will rehabilitate the power station and \nincrease its generation capacity. Project benefits come from incremental electricity generation, \nwhich will be consumed domestically and exported to neighboring countries; and saved O&M \ncosts.  Sensitivity  analysis  on  key  issues\u2014e.g.,  an  increase  in  capital  costs,  decrease  in \nincremental generation, and delay in completion\u2014confirms the project\u2019s economic viability. \n \n32.  The financial internal rate of return is calculated at 5.6%, which is more than the weighted \naverage cost of capital of 2.3%. The financial viability was gauged by comparing the revenue and \ncost streams of scenarios with and without the project. Sensitivity analysis confirms that the \nproject\u2019s financial viability is robust even under unfavorable circumstances. The financial internal \nrate of return is based on the government\u2019s draft medium-term tariff plan (MTTP), 2019\u20132023. \n \n33.  Substantial institutional reforms in the energy sector since 2014 have resulted in the \nestablishment of an independent regulator in 2014; the creation of a settlement center in 2015; \nthe formation of a national energy holding company to improve the management and effective \nperformance of the industry; and the foundation of the State Committee on Industry, Energy, and \nSubsoil Use to handle policy making. Substantial tariff reforms took place with the implementation \nof the MTTP, 2014\u20132017, which improved EPP\u2019s revenues: its net income turned from a loss in \n2015 to a profit of Som2.2 billion in 2016, and Som3.9 billion in 2017. The sales revenue is \nsufficient to cover direct costs\u2014cost of sales such as wages, maintenance, depreciation of assets, \noperations, and current investment. Government assurance to implement the MTTP, 2019\u20132023 \nis essential to help not only EPP but also the sector in closing the cost-recovery gap. \n \n \n ", "8 \nC.  Governance \n \n34.  A  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  in  July  2018  following  ADB \nguidelines. While the country\u2019s public financial management is progressing slowly and is still \nconsidered weak, EPP is an autonomous corporate enterprise with strong financial management, \naccounting, and reporting systems. However, while EPP\u2019s financial management ability is better \nthan it was in the previous assessment in 2015, it still needs further strengthening. EPP has been \nimplementing phases 1\u20133 of the Toktogul project since 2012 and has submitted its audited \nfinancial statements (prepared in line with International Financial Reporting Standards) and \naudited project financial statements on time and with unqualified opinions. Consequently, the \nfinancial management arrangements in place are considered acceptable for this project. Building \nup financial management capability and effective internal control and auditing, and strengthening \nprocurement capacity and procedures, is critical to improve corporate performance. These steps \nwere taken under the business operations assessment and EPP management modernization \ncomponent of phases 2\u20133 of the Toktogul project, whose implementation is ongoing.16 \n \n35.  A procurement risk assessment concluded that the project risk is medium. To mitigate the \nrisk, a procurement risk management plan was proposed.17 \n \n36.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and EPP. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n37.  The project will benefit Kyrgyz Republic through more reliable energy supply. The energy \nsector is the main driver of economic growth, and sufficient and stable electricity supply will help \ndevelop small and medium-sized enterprises and create jobs. A reliable and affordable supply of \nelectricity has the potential to be particularly beneficial to poor households, which are forced to \nuse expensive alternative fuels in times of electricity shortage during winter.  \n \n38.  The project is classified some gender elements because it will directly benefit women \nbeyond the general benefits of directly improving women's access to reliable electricity and new \neconomic opportunities. The project includes the following elements to enhance benefits to \nwomen: (i) EPP will recruit 10 women engineers for two years under the project; (ii) the women \nengineer team will be trained to support a new enterprise resource planning system to be installed; \nand (iii) the project will create a mentoring scheme to create secondment opportunities for female \nstaff in international organizations. To monitor this initiative, the human resources department will \npublish sex-disaggregated employment data at all levels of the organization in EPP\u2019s website. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n39.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.18 \n \n                                                \n16 The creation of the Kyrgyz Electricity Settlement Center, which is to take control of the distribution of sector revenues, \nwas funded under phase 1 and is ongoing. The inventory and asset revaluation of the energy sector was funded \nunder phase 2 and is ongoing. These steps are expected to be completed in 2019. \n17 Procurement Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n18 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "9 \n \n40.  Environment (category B). EPP has prepared an initial environmental examination with \nan environmental management plan (EMP) in line with the Safeguard Policy Statement. Records \nof related public consultation undertaken in August 2018 are included in the initial environmental \nexamination. The report, endorsed by EPP, was posted on the ADB website on 27 September \n2018. \n \n41.  The following potential environmental impacts may be associated with output 1: (i) safety \nand health issues during construction; (ii) increased truck movements during construction in the \ninhabited  areas;  (iii) transportation  of  heavy  equipment,  construction materials,  and  waste; \n(iv) disposal  of  iron,  steel,  asbestos,  and  other  waste,  including  obsolete  equipment; \n(v) construction waste from civil works and some domestic waste generated by workers; (vi) water \nand soil contamination risks; and (vii) management and disposal of about 500,000 cubic meters \nof sediments to be dredged. The EMP specifies adequate mitigation measures and monitoring \nplans to cover these impacts, including management and disposal of uncontaminated sediments. \nOils and scrap metals will be kept safe in the on-site storage area, which will be improved with \nfinancing under the project. EPP will make sure that licensed companies, under the monitoring \nand supervision of the project management consultants and the project management unit, recycle \nand dispose oils and scrap metals. \n \n42.  Because of uncertainty over sediment contamination, EPP will collect samples at various \ndepths before any dredging activity starts, to check for contaminants in deeper layers, in line with \na sediments sampling and analysis plan to be agreed with ADB. In case sediment contamination \nis found, the Project shall be assessed by ADB for recategorization in accordance with the ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). The Borrower shall, through EPP, update and submit to ADB \nfor clearance the necessary safeguard documents.  \n \n43.  The project management unit will handle the EMP\u2019s implementation with help from the \nproject implementation consultants and EPP\u2019s Reliability and Safety Service Department staff. A \nspecific line item is added in the cost table for social and environmental mitigation. Monitoring \nresults will be included in the project quarterly progress reports and semi-annual environmental \nreports. The cost of the EMP mitigation measures will be included in the turnkey contract, and the \ncost for environmental monitoring will be included in the consulting services contract of the project \nimplementation consultants. \n \n44.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples (category C). During the project \npreparation stage, it was confirmed that (i) all civil works will be implemented within the confines \nof the existing Uch-Kurgan HPP, where no land acquisition or livelihood impacts will occur; and \n(ii) all land used for sediment disposal sites is public land. It was also confirmed that the project \nis not expected to affect indigenous peoples as defined under the Safeguard Policy Statement. \nPublic  consultation  was  conducted  in  August  2018.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  was \nprepared and will be functional when the project is approved. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan  \n \n45.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.19  \n \n \n                                                \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nChanges in transboundary water-sharing  Coordinate with regional government agencies on water \narrangements altering downstream release  management \nrequirements \nEPP\u2019s financial sustainability after project  Implement the medium-term tariff plan, 2019\u20132023 \ncompletion could be jeopardized if tariffs are not \nincreased. \nUnknown dam foundation conditions may affect  Conduct optimum design and option analysis; select \ndam reinforcement.  qualified technical team \nContaminants in sediments may delay  Surface sampling found no contaminants; complete \nimplementation.  sampling before dredging starts. \nUnknown condition of embedded equipment  Use new gates and an underwater, remotely operated \nand equipment currently covered by sediment  vehicle, if needed \nEPP = Electric Power Plants. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n46.  The government and EPP have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government and EPP have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the draft loan, grant, and project agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n47.
