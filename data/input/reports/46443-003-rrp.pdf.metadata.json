The \nproject  will  enhance  climate  resilience  and  will  be  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  \u201c3Es\u201d  of  economy, \nenvironment, and equity, as outlined in its Urban Operational Plan.3 \n \n\nthe  Lao  PDR \n\nin  enhancing \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nThe six GMS countries form a geographically contiguous region and an important cluster \nof economic activity.4 Despite wide divergence in their current level of economic development, \nthe GMS countries are following increasingly similar urban development trajectories. Key drivers \nof urban development and regional integration include the anticipation of the ASEAN Economic \nCommunity  by  December  2015,  increased  domestic  and  international  migration  within  the \nregion, the economic rise of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), significant improvements in \nroad  networks  and  connectivity,  increasingly  ubiquitous  and  improving  cell  phone  and  internet \ncoverage,  and  a  great  potential  and  growing  demand  for  tourism  and  related  activities.  The \nthree economic corridors defined under the GMS framework form a network of important routes \nthat  connect  some  of  the  GMS'  largest  cities,  including  Bangkok,  Ha  Noi,  Ho  Chi  Minh  City, \nKunming, Nanning, and Phnom Penh.5 \n \n4. \nThis  project  in  the  Lao  PDR,  together  with  projects  in  Cambodia  and  Viet  Nam, \nrepresent the second phase of the GMS Corridor Towns Development Project in these countries, \nwhich  supports  urban  development  along  the  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor  and  the  Southern \nEconomic Corridor.6 The focus on developing towns along economic corridors aims to maximize \nthe benefits of increased trade and traffic flows to strengthen their competitiveness and catalyze \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Second Greater Mekong Subregion Corridor Towns \n\nDevelopment Project (TA 8425-REG).  \n\n3  ADB. 2012.

Manila (Loan 2969-VIE). \n\n\f2 \n \nwider  economic  growth  in  the  region.  The  development  of  environmental  infrastructure  will \npromote green growth and climate resilience of these towns in the future. The project supports \nthe  first  four  strategic  thrusts  of  the  GMS  Strategic  Framework  2012\u20122022:  (i)  strengthening \ninfrastructure  links;  (ii)  facilitating  cross-border  trade,  investment,  and  tourism;  (iii)  enhancing \nprivate sector participation and competitiveness; and (iv) developing human resources.7 \n \n5. \nTowns along (i) the Southern Economic Corridor, which links Thailand to southern Viet \nNam through Cambodia; and (ii) the NSEC, with one branch that links the Lao PDR to the PRC, \nThailand, and Myanmar, and another branch that links Ha Noi to Kunming and Nanning in the \nPRC, are well positioned to serve as dynamic centers of investment and economic growth.8 The \nstrategic location of the corridor towns provides the stimulus for increased trade and investment. \nAccess  to  markets  will  provide  many  incentives  for  local  economies  in  the  hinterlands  of  the \ncorridor towns. Given these development opportunities, and with the rapid growth of the urban \npopulation  and  expansion  of  urban  areas,  several  corridor  towns  are  now  facing  demands  for \nurban  infrastructure  and  essential  support  services,  including  Houayxay  and  Luang  Namtha  in \nthe Lao PDR along the NSEC. \n \n6. \nHouayxay  is  a  medium-sized  town  and  the  administrative  capital  of  Bokeo  Province  in \nthe  northwestern  part  of  the  Lao  PDR;  it  is  close  to  the  country\u2019s  border  with  Myanmar  and \nThailand. With a population of about 68,000 in 2013, the town has been growing steadily as a \ncenter  for  commercial  activities  in  the  province,  with  an  expanding  economy  where  growth  is \nlinked to cross-border activities, tourism, logistics, and small-scale industries. The town serves \nas a river port and transfer point for tourists and goods traveling to the northern uplands of the \nLao PDR and to Thailand. \n \n7. \nLuang  Namtha  town  is  the  administrative  capital  of  Luang  Namtha  Province  in  the \nnorthwestern part of the Lao PDR bordering the PRC and Myanmar. Luang Namtha town, with a \npopulation  of  about  55,000  in  2013,  is  strategically  located  near  the  border  with  the  PRC. \nLocated  in  one  of  the  poorest  provinces  in  the  Lao  PDR,  the  local  economy  continues  to  rely \nlargely on the agriculture sector. The town continues to see growth in the tourism sector due to \nits  proximity  to  the  Nam  Ha  Biodiversity  Conservation  Area  and  the  upgrading  of  its  airport  in \n2008. Continued growth is expected in ecotourism, small-scale industries, and agroprocessing. \n \n8. \nLessons  learned.  Among  the  key  lessons  learned  from  completed  or  ongoing  ADB-\nfinanced  projects  in  urban  development,  including  the  first  phase  of  the  GMS  Corridor  Towns \nDevelopment  Project  in  the  Lao  PDR,  are:  (i)  civic  participation  and  demand-driven \ndevelopment  activities  enhance  the  sense  of  local  ownership;  (ii)  capacity  building  requires \nproper  planning,  adequate  targeting,  and  up-front  implementation;  (iii)  institutional  and  policy \nreform should be based on realistic assessments of timing, resource requirements, and political \nwill; (iv) financial cost recovery is critical to project sustainability; (v) streamlined approaches to \nprocurement  and  contract  packaging  secure  effective  project  implementation;  and  (vi)  strong \nexecuting  agency  leadership,  adequate  selection  of  project  staff  with  clearly  defined roles  and \nresponsibilities,  and  capacity  and  training  on  ADB  procedures  and  required  submissions  are \ncrucial  for  effective  implementation.  These  lessons  are  closely  aligned  with  the  project,  which \nhas a strong capacity development component, optimizes the value of community involvement, \nand  adopts  a  business  plan  approach  to  revenue  collection  and  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M). Executing agencies will also receive start-up support on ADB procedures upon project \ncommencement. \n\n                                                \n7  ADB.  2011.

The  project  conforms  with  government  policies  and \nstrategies,  including  the  Seventh  Five-Year  National  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  and \nother relevant national policies and strategies.9 In particular, the project is set within the context \nof a policy framework where the provincial and municipal authorities will incrementally assume \nthe main role for planning and implementation. \n \n10. \nThe  project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132016  for  the  Lao \nPDR;  ADB\u2019s  Urban  Operational  Plan,  which  encourages  economic  competiveness  of  cities, \ngreen development, and inclusive growth (footnote 3); the GrEEEn Cities Approach, which has \nbeen piloted in several cities in Indonesia, Malaysia,  Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam; ADB\u2019s \nWater  Operational  Plan,  2011\u20132020;  the  GMS  Strategic  Framework  (footnote  7);  the  GMS \nUrban  Development  Strategic  Framework  2015\u20132022,  and  the  GMS  Regional  Investment \nFramework Implementation Plan, 2014\u20132018.10 The towns under this project were selected and \nprioritized under the GMS Regional Investment Framework as towns that (i) are localized within \nthe  GMS  economic  corridors,  and  (ii)  directly  contribute  to  economic  and  urban  development. \nAs  part  of  project  preparation,  strategic  local  economic  development  plans  (SLEDPs),  which \npresent  the  medium-term  strategy,  planning,  and  investment  plan  for  each  town,  have  been \nprepared. The SLEDPs are based on assessments of potential investments in four dimensions \n(economic  development,  environment,  equity,  and  good  governance),  and  extensive \nconsultations  and  discussions.  The  SLEDPs,  which  enhance  existing  provincial  master  plans \nand anchor these to the regional context of the GMS, will be refined and endorsed as part of the \nproject. \n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe  impacts  will  be  aligned  with  the  Seventh  Five-Year  National  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment  Plan,  2011\u20132015  targets  of  maintaining  economic  growth,  achieving  poverty \nreduction  targets,  ensuring  sustainable  development,  and  supporting  regional  integration \n(footnote 9). The outcome will be improved urban services in Houayxay and Luang Namtha. \n \nC. \n \nThe  outputs  of  the  project  are  (i)  SLEDPs  developed,  (ii)  priority  urban  infrastructure \n12. \ninvestments \ninvestments \nstrengthened,  and  (iv)  community  awareness  on  project  activities  and  environmental \nsustainability improved. The infrastructure investments in each town are based on local demand \nand match the priorities selected by the government.  \n \n13. \nIn  Houayxay,  the  project  will  finance  solid  waste  management,  urban  roads  and \ndrainage,  riverbank  protection,  a  riverside  road  and  walkway,  river  port  rehabilitation,  and  an \necological  park  and  recreation  area.  This  will  include  (i)  construction  of  a  2-kilometer  (km) \nriverside  walkway  to  provide  enhanced  access  from  the  main  urban  area  to  the  south  of  the \ntown;  (ii)  construction  of  a  1-km  riverside  embankment  for  enhanced  protection  of  the  town \n\nImpacts and Outcome \n\ninstitutional  capacities \n\nfor  managing  public \n\nimplemented,  (iii) \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n9  Government  of  the  Lao  PDR,  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment.  2010.

Under  the  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Planning,  a  project  coordination  unit \n(PCU) will work as the technical team and will liaise with project implementation units (PIUs) to \nbe  established  at  the  provincial  departments  of  public  works  and  transport.  A  central  project \nsteering committee will be established. It will be chaired by a vice minister from the MPWT and \nwill  include  representation  from  other  key  ministries  and  provincial  administrative  units.  A \nprovincial  project  steering  committee  will  be  established  for  each  town,  chaired  by  the \nrespective  province\u2019s  vice  governor  and  including  representation  from  other  key  provincial \ndepartments  and  district  administrative  units.

This \nwill  be  achieved  through  improved  solid  waste  management,  urban  roads  and  drainage \nupgrades,  and  urban  recreation  opportunities  (Houayxay  and  Luang  Namtha);  riverbank \nprotection, a riverside road and walkway and river port rehabilitation (Houayxay); urban village \nupgrade, and construction of a bridge (Luang Namtha). The subprojects are technically feasible \nand use optimum design solutions and standards, where the technology for undertaking the civil \nworks and O&M can be managed by the provincial and municipal authorities. Climate resilient \ndesign  has  been  ensured  including,  for  example,  through  designing  the  Houayxay  riverbank \nprotection  upgrade,  and  riverside  road  and  walkway,  with  an  extra  height;  and  by  designing \ndrainage  in  both  Houayxay  and  Luang  Namtha  to  account  for  future  rainfall  increases  due  to \nclimate  change.  Appropriate  levels  of  capacity  building  and  training  are  assured  in  the  project \nloan.  \n \n21. \nThe  project  recognizes  the  weak  institutional  capacity  of  the  provincial  and  municipal \nauthorities  to  plan  and  manage  urban  sector  development,  implement  and  operate  urban \ninfrastructure,  and  deliver  essential  urban  services.  This  will  be  addressed  through  targeted \ntraining and institutional capacity building. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n22. \nAn  economic  analysis  was  undertaken  for  all  subprojects  to  determine  their  viability, \nusing the computation of economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as the indicator. The base case \nresults indicate all components are economically viable with an estimated EIRR exceeding the \nassumed  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12%.  The  EIRR  results  range  from  16%  to \n33%  for  Houayxay  and  14%  to  19%  for  Luang  Namtha.  All  subprojects  were  generally  also \nviable under adverse scenarios in which costs were higher or benefits lower by 10% compared \nto the  base  case.13 These  scenarios  included  a  10%  increase  in  capital  cost,  10%  increase  in \nO&M cost, 10% reduction in benefits, and a 1-year delay in the realization of benefits. \n \n23. \nA financial analysis was conducted for both the revenue- and the nonrevenue-generating \nsubprojects  of  each  town  to  confirm  the  sustainability  of  the  investment.  The  analysis \nestablished  that,  for  both  towns,  sufficient  counterpart  funds  for  their  investment  components \nwill  be  available.  None of the  public  entities  involved  in  the  operation  of  the  respective  project \ncomponents  is  corporatized.  They  are  all  general  government  sector  units,  and  their  accounts \nare  not  ring-fenced.  Therefore,  a  financial  internal  rate  of  return  has  not  been  calculated.  The \ntariffs  collected  for  the  revenue-generating  components  (e.g.,  solid  waste  management) \ncurrently  do  not  fully  cover  the  cost  for  O&M,  but  will  be  adjusted  over  time  to  meet  these \nrequirements. Any funding gap for meeting the full O&M cost will be covered by the provincial \ngovernments, a commitment that has been covenanted in the loan agreement. \n \nC. \n \nAssessment  shows  that  the  executing  agency  has  experience  with  the  financial \n24. \nmanagement and fund disbursement systems applicable to ADB projects. It has developed the \ninstitutional  capacity  to  undertake  international  and  national  competitive  bidding  for  civil  works \nand goods. The project financial management risk is considered high, primarily in the provinces \nand  municipalities.  Capacity  development  and  training  assistance  will  be  provided  to  the  PCU \nand PIUs on financial and procurement management and fund disbursement. \n                                                \n13 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nGovernance \n\n7 \n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n25. \nwith  the  government  and  the  MPWT. 14 The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 12). \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n26. \nFrom  the  poverty  and  social  analysis  conducted,  the  project  is  classified  as  general \nintervention. 15 The  overall  project  social  impacts  are  expected  to  be  positive,  with  expected \nimprovements to the quality of life for people in both towns. The project will result in improved \nclimate-resilient  infrastructure  for  the  participating  towns,  benefiting  all  social  strata,  including \nthe  urban  poor  and  other  vulnerable  groups  in  each  town.  Proposed  tariffs  for  solid  waste \nmanagement  have  been  assessed  as  affordable  for  low-income  groups.  Specifically,  the \nsubproject component proposals for improving urban drainage will improve flood protection for \nthe  project-affected  people,  their  homes,  and  their  property.  Poor  and  vulnerable  households \nlocated  in  low-lying  flood-prone  areas  and  who  experience  insufficient  and/or  lack  basic \nenvironmental sanitation services stand to benefit the most. \n \n27. \nThe  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  gender  analysis \nconcluded  that  women  in  the  subproject  areas  might  not  fully  realize  project  benefits  and \nopportunities  if  gender  issues  concerning  women\u2019s  employment  opportunities  and  sector \nrepresentation  in  decision  making  are  not  mainstreamed  in  project  activities.  Accordingly,  a \ngender action plan has been prepared with the aim of (i) promoting the mainstreaming of gender \nissues  in  project  planning  and  implementation,  (ii)  addressing  specific  impacts  and  risks  that \nmay  affect  women  differently  or  disproportionately  compared  with  men,  and  (iii)  enhancing \nparticipation of women in project benefits. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n \nSocial  safeguards.  The  safeguard  category  for  involuntary  resettlement  is  B.  Two \n28. \nresettlement  plans,  one  per  town,  will  be  prepared  for  components  that  will  trigger  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  impacts.  For  both  the  subprojects,  a  total  area  of  29.11 \nhectares  of  land  will  be  acquired,  affecting  55  affected  households  (351  affected  persons), \nincluding  32  severely  affected  households (177 affected  persons). In  addition  to  partial  loss  of \nland, other impacts include loss of crops, trees, and aquaculture. The total LAR cost, estimated \nat $440,000 (including contingencies), will be provided through counterpart financing.16 \n \nAll  affected  households  are  entitled  to  compensation  and  rehabilitation  assistance. \n29. \nSeverely affected and vulnerable households will be provided income restoration through cash \nassistance and skills training, and receive priority for employment in project-related construction \nworks.  A  cutoff  date  will  be  established  following  extensive  stakeholder  consultation  and \nparticipation.  Project  information  has  been  disclosed  to  affected  persons  throughout  project \npreparation, and a project information booklet will be updated and distributed during a detailed \nmeasurement  survey  during  project  implementation.  There  will  be  effective  internal  monitoring \nduring  all  stages  of  the  subprojects\u2019  implementation.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  information \ndisclosure  and  consultation  requirements,  the  safeguard  documents  will  be  posted  on  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite. \n\n                                                \n14 ADB. 2010.

The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment  in \n31. \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  One  initial  environmental  examination \n(IEE)  report  and  two  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs)  (one  per  town)  have  been \nprepared. 17  The  proposed  subprojects  are  not  expected  to  cause  irreversible  adverse \nenvironmental impacts. Mitigation measures for identified impacts have been incorporated in the \nEMPs.  In  addition,  potential  impacts  of  climate  change  and  natural  hazards  (e.g.,  flooding  and \nearthquake) on the project have been recommended for integration into the detailed design stage \nas part of the IEE assessment whenever appropriate.  \n \n32. \nThe  final  EMPs  will  form  part  of  the  contract  bidding  documents.  Environmental \nconsiderations  during  design,  and  allocation  of  sufficient  budget  for  O&M,  will  help  mitigate \npotential  adverse  impacts  during  operation.  Effective  environmental  monitoring  at  all  stages  of \nsubproject  implementation  will  be  supported  by  including  budget  and  institutional  arrangements \nfor EMP implementation and monitoring. Specifically, EMP implementation will be supported by a \ndesignated environment officer in the respective PIUs of the executing agency (footnote 17). \n \n33. \nClimate change projections and climate change impacts on the project are discussed in \nthe climate vulnerability and risk assessment section of the IEE. Costs that may be attributed to \nclimate  change  adaptation  are  estimated  at  $1  million,  representing  about  2%  of  the  total  loan \namount.  \n \n34. \nResettlement and environment documents have been prepared in consultation with local \ncommunities and are in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and the laws and \nregulations of the Lao PDR. The documents have been endorsed, approved, and posted on the \nADB  website.  The  project  towns  have  demonstrated  a  high  level  of  commitment  to  social \nsafeguards,  and  have  allocated  their  own  resources  for  LAR.
