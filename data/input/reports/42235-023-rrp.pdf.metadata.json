The  proposed  policy-based  loan  will  support  subprogram  2.  The  Viet  Nam \ncountry  partnership  strategy  2012\u20132015  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  highlights \nmicrofinance as a key area for ADB assistance.4  \n \n\n(ii)  enhancing  supervisory  and \n\nregulatory  environment, \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nExtensive  outreach  in  microcredit  delivery  needing  sustainability.  ADB\u2019s  special \nevaluation study on the Microfinance Development Strategy 20005 found that, as of 2010, Viet \nNam  attained  a  much  higher  penetration  rate  of  75%  of  microcredit  delivery  relative  to  other \nAsian  countries.  The  Vietnam  Bank  for  Social  Policies  (VBSP) 6 has  remarkable  microcredit \noutreach  to  98%  of  11,000  communes  with  almost  7  million  borrowers,  of  which  50%  are \ncategorized  as  poor.  VBSP  has  a  dominant share of  67%  of total  microfinance  borrowers  and \n65%  of  outstanding  microfinance  loans  in  2010.  However,  the  extensive  outreach  achieved \nthrough the current state-driven approach cannot be sustained into the future. \n \nAchievement  with  an  adverse  impact.  The  notably  high  outreach  of  microcredit \n4. \ndelivery has, however, resulted in adverse impacts: (i) increased fiscal burden through financing \noperations  and  interest  rate subsidies,  and  budget  allocation to lending  resources, making the \nsystem  unsustainable;  and  (ii)  unequal  treatment  with  the  state-driven  approach  discouraging \nthe  entry  and  expansion  of  market-based  financial  institutions.  With  persistent  budget  deficit \nrecorded since 2009, the sustainability of VBSP became at risk.  \n \n5. \nSector  reform with  policy  change.  Against this background, in 2010, the government \nrefocused  microfinance  as  a  formal  banking  service  from  a  social  protection  tool.  This  policy \nchange  was  a  timely  response  to  the  rising  demands  of  low-income  household  and \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB\u2019s  microfinance  development  strategy  defines  microfinance  as  \u201cthe  provision  of  a  broad  range  of  financial \nservices  such  as  deposits,  loans,  payment  services,  money  transfers,  and  insurance  to  poor  and  low-income \nhouseholds  and,  their  microenterprises\u201d  (ADB.  2000.

In December 2011, \n6. \nthe  Prime  Minister  announced  the  Vietnam  Microfinance  Development  Strategy,  2011\u20132020 \nformulated  with  ADB  assistance.8   The  national  strategy  provides  a  road  map  to  developing  a \nmarket-oriented  system,  relying  more  on  self-sustaining  financial  institutions  in  providing \nmarket-based  financial  services,  while  the  government  provides  an  enabling  environment \nthrough  regulations  and  supervision,  capacity  development,  and  financial  infrastructure \nsupportive  to  microfinance  transactions.  The  Microfinance  Working  Committee 9  guides \nimplementation of the national strategy and provides policy advice and coordination to the work \nplan.  Further,  the  implementation  of  the  national  strategy  requires  a  comprehensive  program \nwhich ADB agreed to support.  \n \n7. \nADB  assistance.  On  5  July  2012,  ADB  approved  the  programmatic  approach  for  the \nMicrofinance Development Program and a $40 million policy-based loan for subprogram 1 and \n$0.5 million attached technical assistance (TA).10 It was the first full-scale ADB assistance after \nover a decade of TA projects in nurturing formal microfinance institutions (MFIs).11 The program \nsupports government initiatives to develop a vibrant microfinance sector and improve access to \nformal  financial  services  for  the  poor,  especially  in  rural  areas.  It  aims  to  promote  fair \ncompetition  among  diverse \nin \nmicrofinance,  thereby  gradually  reducing  the  government\u2019s  direct  involvement  in  microfinance \noperations.  Lessons  from  the  past  ADB  assistance  and  other  development  partners  identified \nthe following four major requirements still lacking in Viet Nam: \n \n\ninstitutions,  and  support  a  market  orientation \n\nfinancial \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nSupportive policy  and regulatory  environment. The development of inclusive \nand  sustainable  microfinance  requires  a  supportive  policy  and  regulatory \nenvironment.  This  includes  key  development  policy  and  banking  legislation  to \npromote microfinance; \nEnhanced  supervisory  capacity  for  effective  supervision  and  regulation \nover  microfinance.  To  promote  quality  financial  services,  supervisory  capacity \nneeds  to  be  enhanced.  This  can  be  achieved  through  training  on  supervisory \nskills and procedures, securing a pool of microfinance supervisors;  \nStrengthened  financial  institutions  involved  in  microfinance.  A  vibrant \nmicrofinance  sector  can  be  developed  by  strengthening  three  different  types  of \nfinancial  institutions  involved  in  microfinance;  VBSP  seeking  self-sustaining \n\n                                                \n7  In  Viet  Nam,  the  microenterprise  is  defined  as  \u201ca  business  entity  with  less  than  10  employees\u201d  by  Government \nDecree  No.  56/2009/ND-CP  of  30  June  2009  on  assistance  for  development  of  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises. \n\n8  ADB.  2010.

Sound  microfinance \ndevelopment  requires  supportive \ntraining \nfinancial \ninstitutes to enhance overall sector capacity, a microcredit information exchange \nsystem to secure loan portfolio quality, and financial literacy programs aiming to \nenhance knowledge in microfinance and protect clients. \n\ninfrastructure \n\nincluding \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nFollowing  the  achievements  in  subprogram  1,  subprogram  2  has  continued  to  support \n8. \nthe  government  in  implementing  comprehensive  microfinance  sector  reform  by  focusing  on \nthese  four  broad  areas  (para.  7),  aiming  to  achieve  self-sustaining  operations  and  improved \nfinancial services, leading to greater financial inclusion, and a deepened finance sector. \n \nB. \n \n9. \nThe impact will be greater financial inclusion and deepened finance sector. The outcome \nwill  be  increased  access  of  low-income  clients  to  diverse,  sustainable,  and  affordable \nmicrofinance services.  \n \nC. \n \n10. \nAll  policy  actions  including  9  triggers  and  12  milestones  have  been  complied  with \n(Appendix 4). There were minor modifications to five policy actions. Policy actions 2-2, 2-3 and \n2-15  were  revised  from  the  issuance  of  implementing  rules  and  regulations  (IRRs)  to  the \nformulation  of  IRRs.  The  IRRs,  in  the  form  of  State  Bank  of  Vietnam  (SBV)  circulars,  are \nexpected to be issued in early 2015 after a careful approval process of the government which \nincluded  impact  studies.  Policy  action  2-4  was  revised  to  reflect  the  overachievement  of  the \naction.12   Policy  action  2-9  was revised to  more  precisely  reflect  the government  action,  to the \nissuance of IRRs on MFI supervision, from original action of approval and implementation of the \nManual  of  Supervision  for  MFIs.  This  is  because  an  MFI  is  supervised  as  a  credit  institution \nunder  the  prudential  norms  applicable  to  the  banking  sector,  requiring  microfinance  specific \nIRRs  but  not  a  separate  supervision  manual.  Subprogram  2,  through  implementation  of  its \npolicy actions, has delivered the following outputs. \n \nOutput  1:  A  policy  and  regulatory  environment  conducive  to  the  development  of \n11. \nan \nthe \ninclusive  and  sustainable  market-oriented  microfinance  sector.  Following \nformulation  of  a  development  strategy  for  microfinance  under  subprogram  1,  subprogram  2 \nhelped  the  government  implement  the  strategy  and  formulate  detailed  regulations.  Detailed \nregulations  on  MFI  licensing  and  sound  operations  are  needed  to  support  the  increasing \nnumber of semiformal MFIs becoming formal financial institutions under SBV prudential norms. \nFormalization  will  help  these  MFIs  achieve  the  full  potential  to  provide  a  variety  of  formal \nfinancial  services  while  complying  with  prudential  requirements.  Following  the  promulgation of \nthe Credit Institutions Law, 2010 and the formulation of the Vietnam Microfinance Development \nStrategy,  2011\u20132020  under  subprogram  1,  the  Banking  Supervision  Agency  (BSA)  of  SBV \nformulated rules and regulations on sound microfinance operations, governance structure, and \n\n                                                \n12 The original policy action called for the conduct of a study on options for fiscal and regulatory incentives to promote \nthe microfinance  sector. Following  the  study,  the  government  introduced incentives  for  MFIs in  the  form  of  lower \ncorporate  income  tax.  Flexible  interest  rates  were  also  allowed  for  microfinance  services.  These  fiscal  and \nregulatory incentives promote the sustainability of microfinance operations.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fconsumer protection.  An  SBV  circular  on  PCF  licensing,  organization  structure  and  operations \nwas  formulated  to  guide  PCFs  in  the  conduct  of  sustainable  microfinance  operations  for  their \nclients  under  subprogram  2.  SBV  circulars  on  MFI  licensing,  ownership,  and  governance,  and \non MFI prudential requirements were formulated as well to promote sustainable growth of MFIs. \n \n12. \nThe government also responded to the growing demand for insurance services suitable \nand accessible to the low-income segment with a two-step approach to setting up the regulatory \nframework.  While  the  Insurance  Supervisory  Agency  at  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  is \nformulating  the  microinsurance  regulations  for  issuance  and  implementation  in  2015,  it  has \nissued  a  set  of  regulations  guiding  the  sound  operation  of  approved  microinsurance  pilot \nprojects.  This  interim  regulation  meets  the  growing  demand  for  microinsurance  with  a  semi-\nformal status, while ensuring its reliability until the final regulatory framework is formulated. The \npolicy  and  advisory  TA  attached  to  the  subprogram  1  loan  has  provided  policy  advice  and \nsupported the formulation of the microinsurance regulations (footnote 10).  \n \n13. \nOutput 2: Strengthened supervisory and regulatory capacities of the microfinance \nsector  regulators. The supervisory  capacity  of SBV  and  MOF over  microfinance  needs to  be \nstrengthened  through  training  to  supervisors  based  on  newly  issued  microfinance  rules  and \nregulations.  Subprogram  1  initiatives helped the inclusion  of  microfinance  as a formal  banking \nservice under the SBV\u2019s supervision. Under subprogram 2, an associated capacity development \nTA  has  been  providing  supervisory  training  sessions,  and  supporting  regulatory  agencies  to \ndeploy an adequate number of qualified and experienced supervisors in charge of microfinance \noperations.13 The ADB TA has been coordinated with the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement \nand  the  World  Bank  in  strengthening  BSA\u2019s  supervision  over  the  PCF  system  and  MFIs  in \nconducting  microfinance  operations.  Further,  subprogram  2  complements  the  assistance \nprovided by the Government of Canada to enhance BSA\u2019s regulation over the banking sector as \na whole. ADB has been working closely with the International Finance Corporation in conducting \na diagnostic study on responsible finance in Viet Nam. Results of the study will enable the ADB \nTA further develop microfinance training modules.14  \n \n14. \nSince MFIs and PCFs are allowed to mobilize deposits, prudential regulations based on \ninternational banking supervisory standards are applied to ensure the stability of these financial \ninstitutions and protect their depositors. At the same time, considering the unique characteristics \nof  microfinance, 15  supervisory  practices  and  procedures  have  been  adapted  to  maintain  a \nminimal  cost  to  the  supervised  financial  institutions,  as  cost  affects  the  efficiency  of  a \nmicrofinance  operation  given  its  labor-intensive  business  model  dealing  with  many  small \naccounts.  Subprogram  2,  with  the  policy  and  advisory  TA  inputs,  has  encouraged  both \nmicrofinance supervisors and operators to rely on the globally accepted loan monitoring system \nin  generating  reports  to  comply  with  supervisory  requirements  based  on  a  risk-based \napproach.16 The recommended loan monitoring practice has been included in training provided \nby the capacity development TA, helping strengthen microfinance supervision and operation.   \n                                                \n13 ADB.  2013.

Manila (TA 8391-VIE).  \n\n14 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Microfinance lending is provided in a smaller amount than traditional lending, not secured by a traditional collateral \n\nsuch as land, land use right and chattels, but by the borrower\u2019s future cash flow.  \n\n16 For  supervisors,  loan  monitoring  for  microfinance  should  be  a  risk-based  approach  focusing  on  financial \ninstitutions'  risk  management  capacity  and  procedures,  given  a  huge  number  of  small  accounts  involved  in \nmicrofinance.  Peculiar  features  of  microfinance  should  be  well  understood  by  supervisors  to  examine  how \neffectively  a  monitoring  system  works.  Microfinance  operators  should  demonstrate  their  monitoring  procedures, \norganizational structure, appropriate skills mix, and other related capacities needed by adequacy requirements. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f \n15. \nOutput  3:  Credit  institutions  involved  in  microfinance  strengthened  to  provide \naffordable  and  sustainable  services to  the  poor. Following reforms initiated by subprogram \n1,  subprogram  2  has  strengthened  three  major  types  of  financial  institutions  providing \nmicrofinance in Viet Nam: VBSP, PCFs and MFIs. \n \n16. \nVietnam  Bank  for  Social  Policies.  Despite  its  leading  status  in  microcredit  delivery, \nVBSP\u2019s over dependence on government resources and its focus on social policy lending have \nresulted in the following adverse impacts: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ngrowing fiscal burden caused by the public financing of VBSP operations, posing \na serious threat to the sustainability of future VBSP operations;  \ntraditional  focus  on  credit  delivery  not  meeting  client  needs  for  other  financial \nservices  such  as  savings,  which  could  have  supported  VBSP\u2019s  lending \noperations and enhanced self-sustainability; and \nunequal treatment due to government subsidies to VBSP, which can discourage \nthe  entry  of  other  market-based  microfinance  operators  and  hamper  a  sound \ncompetition. \n\n \n17. \nFollowing policy dialogue on VBSP reform under subprogram 1, subprogram 2 called for \nand  confirmed  two  key  policy  actions:  (i)  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  approval  of  the  development \nstrategy  of  VBSP  to  2020  aiming  to  transform  VBSP  to  a  more  self-sustaining  financial \ninstitution, and (ii) strengthening  of the capacity of VBSP and its savings and credit groups for \nmarket-based operations through training and advocacy along with ADB\u2019s capacity development \nTA. The average interest rate of VBSP\u2019s lending has come closer to the market rate, accounting \nfor  about  80%  of  the  market  rate,  improved  from  about  40%  since  2012.  The  program\u2019s \nmedium-term direction requires close monitoring of the review process on the government\u2019s role \nin micro-credit delivery; and the shift of VBSP operations to self-sustenance with further market \norientation through increased deposit mobilization, enhanced information technology solutions, \nand financial product development. \n \n18. \nPeople\u2019s  credit  fund  system.  A  key  thrust  in  strengthening  the  PCF  system  is  to \nestablish an apex institution supportive to financing and capacity development needs of member \nPCFs  and  small  community-based  financial  institutions.  The  traditional  role  of  the  Central \nPeople\u2019s  Credit  Fund  (CCF)  has  been  enhanced  with  clear  mandates  and  greater  authority \ngranted to its successor \u2013 Cooperative Bank under subprogram 2. Cooperative Bank is vested \nwith the deputized authority to supervise PCFs and the mandate to help PCFs strengthen their \noperational  capacity  and  financial  positions.  The  government\u2019s  capital  injection  to  Cooperative \nBank assisted in developing the PCF system during the subprogram 2 period.  \n \nEmerging  microfinance  institutions.  Subprogram  1  supported  formalization  of  two \n19. \nMFIs  licensed  by  SBV  under  the old  licensing  requirements.  New  regulations  were formulated \nunder subprogram 2 to facilitate formalization of an increasing number of MFIs. The impacts of \nformalization includes: (i) diversification of funding source including deposits from the public and \ndonor funding; (ii) enhanced operating capacity with qualified staff motivated by the formalized \nstatus; (iii) a wider variety of savings products offered to clients; and (iv) an extended outreach \nto  clients.    As  of  December  2013,  clients  of  licensed  and  unlicensed  MFIs  accounted  for  only \n7%  of  all  microfinance  clients.  However,  MFI  operations  have  been  growing  rapidly  with \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fAverage  \nLoan Size ($) \n2010 \n  564 \n\ngovernment  support  and  ADB  assistance.17 During  2010-2012,  five  major  MFIs  under  ADB\u2019s \nearlier  assistance 18  increased  their  client  number  by  92%,  credit  provision  by  180%,  and \nsavings  mobilized  by  364%.  Other  MFIs  participating  in  the  ADB  project  also  increased  their \noutreach to clients by 20% on average during the same period. The proven growth potential of \nprivate  sector-led  MFIs  should  be  further  promoted  by  facilitating  formalization  under  SBV \nprudential  norms. The  number  of  newly  licensed  MFIs  is  expected to grow  in the future  under \nthe development framework formulated by subprogram 2.  \n \nTable  1  provides  an  overview  of  microfinance  lending  by  financial  institutions  in  2010 \n20. \nand 2013. All three types of financial institutions covered by the program (i.e., VBSP, PCFs, and \nMFIs)  achieved  steady  growth  in  their  loan  portfolios,  taking  a  share  of  the  microfinance \noperations  of  the  Vietnam  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development,  a  state-owned \ncommercial bank. \n \n\nTable 1: Microfinance Lendinga by Financial Institutions \n\n \n\nNumber of Borrowers \n(million) \n\nLoans Outstanding \n($ million) \n\n3.2 \n\n1.5 \n\n  927 \n\n3,500 \n\n1,390 \n\n1,094 \n\n1.0 \n0.6 \n\n2013 \n  764 \n\n2013 \n 7.0 \n\n2010 \n  7.8b \n\n1,176 \n   236 \n\n1,006 \n   122 \n\n1,294 \n   189 \n\n1,006 \n   203 \n\n2010 \n4,398 \n\n2013 \n5,350 \n\nInstitution \nVietnam Bank for Social \nPolicies \nVietnam Bank for Agriculture \nand Rural Development \nPeople\u2019s credit funds \n1.1 \nMicrofinance institutionsc \n0.8 \na Based on the State Bank of Vietnam definition of a microfinance lending with the amount up to D30 million ($1,423). \nb In 2010, Vietnam Bank for Social Policies (VBSP) recorded a borrower as an individual.

Under subprogram 2, the Microfinance Center was set up within \nthe Banking Academy19 through an SBV Decision.20  A budget allocation was also made for its \noperation  in  2013  and  2014.  It  is  a  leading  training  institute  for  the  microfinance  industry, \ncollaborating with other training institutes such as training units of VBSP, Cooperative Bank, the \nVietnam Microfinance Working Group, as well as large MFIs. In cooperation with these partners, \nthe  Microfinance  Center  has  responded,  on  a  fee  basis,  to  needs  for  capacity  development \nthrough training, research, and training needs assessment. ADB\u2019s capacity development TA has \nbeen  collaborating  with  the  Microfinance  Center  in  strengthening  capacity  for  operation  and \nsupervision  in  the  microfinance  sector,  and  supporting  knowledge  sharing  on  microfinance.  In \nthe  medium  term,  the  Microfinance  Center  is  expected  to  play  a  hub  role  in  enhancing  the \noverall  capacity  of  microfinance  stakeholders  ranging  from  policy  makers  to  practitioners  in \nconducting best practices in microfinance. \n \n24.  Microcredit  information  exchange  system.  SBV  issued  Circular  No.  03/2013/TT-\nNHNN on 28 January 2013 mandating all credit institutions to report all credit information to the \nCredit Information Center (CIC) in SBV. Prior to the circular, only loans of D50 million and above \nwere  required  for  reporting,  thus  microcredit  information  was  not  covered  by  the  CIC  system. \nSubprogram 2 and the policy and advisory TA attached to the subprogram 1 loan (footnote 10) \nhelped  CIC  set  up  a  microcredit  information  exchange  system.  The  new  system  accesses  all \nformal  financial  institutions  operating  microfinance  which,  in  turn,  upload  and  access  credit \ninformation  at  the  CIC  system  in  an  effective  and  cost-efficient  manner,  helping  ensure  the \nquality of the loan portfolio through proper client selection and credit management. \n \nFormulation  and  implementation  of  financial  literacy  programs.  The  government \n25. \nhas allocated budget to VBSP and CCF in formulating and implementing advocacy and financial \nliteracy  programs  on  sustainable  microfinance  and  customer  protection  to  their  clients, \nmanagement and staff, credit and savings groups, and government agencies concerned. ADB\u2019s \ncapacity  development  TA  will  complement  the  implementation.  The  programs  help  promote \nbetter  understanding  of  stakeholders  on  the  importance  of  sustainable  microfinance,  relevant \nrules  and  regulations,  and  client-protection  practices  including  pricing  transparency  and \ngrievance  procedures.  It  empowers  clients  to  make  informed  choices  for  useful  access  to \nmicrofinance services and protects them from inappropriate transactions. The financial literacy \nprograms  under  subprogram  2  should  be  further  developed  to  a  nationwide  program  in  the \nmedium  term,  helping  establish  a  unified  vision  and  common  understanding  on  the  basic \nprinciples and good practices in a robust and responsive microfinance sector. \n \nD. \n \n26. \nThe  program  is  a  programmatic  approach  comprising  two  single-tranche  subprograms. \nSubprogram  1  comprises  a  single  tranche  loan  of  SDR25,919,000  covering  April  2008\u2013June \n2012. Subprogram 2, with an amount of SDR33,723,000, covers July 2012\u2013September 2014.  \n \n27. \nto \nSDR33,723,000 from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help finance  subprogram  2. The  loan \nwill have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \n                                                \n19 The Banking Academy is a national university under the auspices of the Ministry of Education and the State Bank \n\nin  various  currencies  equivalent \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nThe  government  has \n\nrequested  a \n\nloan \n\nof Vietnam providing professional training and research in the fields of economics, finance, and banking.  \n\n20 SBV Decision No. 278/QD-HV-TCCB of 27 December 2012. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fto \n\nits \n\nincrease \n\nloan  agreement.  The  proceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  disbursed  upon  loan \neffectiveness  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.21 The government will use the local \ncurrency counterpart funds generated by the loan proceeds to meet program expenditures and \nassociated costs of reform, and will provide the necessary budget appropriations to finance the \ncosts relating to the implementation of reforms under the program.  \n \n28. \nThe  programmatic  approach  has  supported  reforms  outlined  in  the  development  policy \nletter  (Appendix  3)  and  policy  matrix  (Appendix  4).  The  loan  amount  is  determined  by  the \nsignificance  of  the  microfinance  sector  to  the  overall  economy,  the  expected  development \nimpact  of  the  policy  package,  and  the  development  financing  needs  of  the  government, \nincluding costs for (i) developing the formal MFI sector to improve services to clients; (ii) helping \nstrategy;  \nself-sustainability  along  with \nVBSP \n(iii)  supporting  the  transformation  of  CCF  to  Cooperative  Bank  and  improving  the  PCF\u2019s \ncapacity  to  better  serve  their  clients;  and  (iv)  helping  the  Banking  Academy  establish  the \nMicrofinance Center to provide capacity development services to the microfinance sector. \n \nE. \n \n29. \nThe  implementation  arrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  2.    SBV,  as  the  executing \nagency, established a steering committee to provide overall policy direction and coordination for \nprogram implementation. The steering committee  is chaired by the SBV deputy governor, with \nhigh officials representing stakeholders including MOF, VBSP, Cooperative Bank, CIC, and the \nBanking  Academy  as members.  SBV  also  established  a program management  unit to  provide \ntechnical  support  to  the  steering  committee.  The  unit  oversees  loan  implementation,  confirms \npolicy  actions  taken,  coordinates  associated  TA  activities  among  implementing  agencies, \nundertakes program administration, and communicates with ADB on behalf of the government.  \nThe implementing agencies will be SBV, MOF, VBSP, Cooperative Bank, CIC, and the Banking \nAcademy,  each  of  which  is responsible for  compliance  with  policy  actions  tasked for,  program \nreporting, and discussing implementing issues with SBV.  \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nits  development \n\nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nJuly 2012\u2013September 2014 \nJune 2015 \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)   Implementing agencies \n\nDisbursement \n\nSteering  committee  chaired  by  the  SBV  deputy  governor,  with  agencies  and \nstakeholders  representing  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  VBSP,  Cooperative  Bank, \nCIC, and the Banking Academy. \nSBV \nMOF, VBSP, Cooperative Bank, CIC, and the Banking Academy \nThe $50 million loan will be disbursed in a single tranche. \n\nCIC = Credit Information Center, MOF= Ministry of Finance, SBV = State Bank of Vietnam, VBSP = Vietnam Bank for \nSocial Policies. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n21 ADB. 1998.

Benefits  are  brought  by  economic  growth  from  allocative  efficiency \nresulting  from  an  enabling  policy  and  regulatory  environment  for  sustainable  market-oriented \nmicrofinance,  improvement  in  savings  mobilization,  increased  sustainability  of  VBSP,  lower \nfiscal  burden  from  the  reduction  of  direct  subsidies,  strengthened  PCF  network,  and \nformalization of MFIs. Estimated gross benefits account for some $450 million. Costs, estimated \nat around $200 million, comprise (i) administrative costs incurred by legislative and/or regulatory \ninitiatives,  and  policy  and  strategy  formulation  and  implementation;  (ii)  enforcement  costs \nincurred by SBV supervision and examination over Cooperative Bank, PCFs, VBSP, and MFIs; \nMOF  supervision  over  VBSP;  and  microinsurance;  and  (iii)  fiscal  costs  incurred  by  equity \ninfusion  into  Cooperative  Bank,  budgetary  allocation  to  the  Microfinance  Center,  and  reduced \ntax rate applied to MFIs.22  \n \nB. \n \nThe  government\u2019s  public  management  reforms  include  the  enactment  of  the  Anti-\n31. \nCorruption Law, 2005 establishing a legal framework to protect and reward whistle-blowers. The \nBudget  Law,  2002  is  under  review  to  improve  budget  execution  and  monitoring  by  enhancing \nthe  implementation  of  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework  and  performance-based \nbudgeting.

ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government.   \n \nC. \n \n32. \nThe  government\u2019s  5-year  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132015  aims  to \nachieve  a  sustainable  economic  development  and  reduce  the  poverty  rate  by  2%  each  year \nthrough  various  economic  reforms,  including  reforms  of  commercial  banks  and  financial \ninstitutions. 23  The  program  aims  at  an  overall  reform  to  develop  microfinance  as  a  formal \nbanking  service  in  response  to  the  rising  demands  of  microenterprise  and  low-income \nhousehold  clients  in  need  for  diverse  financial  services  suitable  and  accessible  to  them  in \nconducting  their  businesses  and  livelihood  activities.  The  program  encourages  a  sound \ncompetition  among  diverse  types  of  microfinance  providers \nimproved  enabling \nenvironment for operations, which will benefit their clients with easier access to lower cost and \nmore  flexible  financial  services.  Moreover,  the  program  supports  strategic  reform  and \ndevelopment of VBSP to a self-sustaining microfinance operating financial institution, increasing \nfiscal space for social development purposes. Subprogram 2 is categorized as providing some \ngender  benefits.

Despite  the  sound  track  record  of  Viet \nNam, implementation of the program is still subject to risks described in Table 3. Major risks and \nmitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.24 \n \nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisk \nExogenous, \ninternational \nfinancial shock, \nand \nmacroeconomic \ninstability \nPolitical resistance \nand vested \ninterest against \nthe reform \n\nPoor governance \nand corruption \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe government is strengthening its monetary policy framework, expanding the tax \nbase, and strengthening public expenditure management with the assistance of \ndevelopment partners. ADB and other development partners in Viet Nam, including \nthe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, hold regular consultative \nmeetings with the government on macroeconomic policy and the stability and \ndevelopment of the financial sector.  \nThe government has shown strong commitment to the reform agenda. Its \ncommitment is also manifested in the scope of policy and regulatory reforms across \nthe finance sector. The Microfinance Development Program reduces this risk by \nfocusing policy actions on key reforms, which will have a high impact, with firm and \nwide support from the government and stakeholders. \nThe government is increasingly adopting a tougher stance on corruption and has \nrecently taken measures, including enacting the Anti-Corruption Law, 2005 and \nsetting up a steering committee against corruption.
