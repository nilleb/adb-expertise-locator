Physical  investments  consist  of  improvements  to\ndrainage,  roads,  traffic  management  and  safety,  solid  waste\nmanagement,  and  sanitation.  The  Project  incorporates  a  social\nstrategy to ensure active participation of the urban communities\nin project implementation and effective targeting of the poor and\nvulnerable.  The  project  area  covers  a  hundred  urban  villages\nwith  about  162,000  residents  within  Vientiane  and  falls  under\nthe jurisdiction of VUDAA.\n\nCategory B\nAn \nsummary is a core appendix.\n\ninitial  environmental  examination  was  undertaken; \n\nits\n\ntertiary \n\nCurrent  deficiencies  in  urban  infrastructure  and  services  in\nVientiane  impede  economic  growth  and  undermine  the  quality\nof  life  of  the  urban  residents,  especially  the  poor.  Despite\nrecent investments in primary road and drainage networks, the\npoor  condition  of  secondary  and \ninfrastructure\nconstrains  the  full  potential  of  and  benefits  from  recent\nimprovements  to  primary  infrastructure  and  services.  The\ninadequate infrastructure and services at community level have\na  particularly  adverse  impact  on  the  lives  of  the  poor,  the\nmajority of whom live in low-lying land, flooded for most of the\nyear.  Further  constraints  to  sustained  growth  and  enhanced\nquality of life of the residents are the present urban institutional\nframework  and  nascent  urban  management  that  are  still\nevolving in the process of ongoing reforms for decentralization.\nWhile  considerable  progress  has  been  made \ntoward\ndecentralized  urban  governance  and  development  of  VUDAA\nas  a  new  entity  responsible \nin\nVientiane, the extent of further reforms needed to fully achieve\ndecentralized  urban  governance  requires  extensive  and  long-\nterm  support.  There  is  need  at  this  stage  to  shift  the  focus  of\nefforts  to  secondary  and  tertiary  infrastructure  and  services  to\nensure  that  environmental  improvements  are  felt  by  all,\nespecially the poor. Equally important is further progress in the\ndecentralization  process  and  development  of  VUDAA  with\nadequate  management  systems  and  skills  and \nfinancial\nresources.\n\nfor  urban  management \n\n\fObjectives and Scope\n\nii\n\ntwo  specific  objectives:  (i) \n\nThe  Project  aims  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  the  urban\nresidents,  especially  the  poor,  and  enhance  urban  productivity\nand economic growth in the Vientiane urban area. To this end,\nto  support\nthe  Project  has \nthe\ndecentralization  and  urban  governance  reforms  and \nprocess  toward  an  autonomous,  well-functioning,  and  self-\nsufficient  urban  local  government  that  is  capable  of  planning,\nmanaging,  and  financing  urban  development  and  providing\nservices in a sustainable manner; and (ii) to target investments\nin infrastructure and services to maximize the utility of existing\ninfrastructure  by  closing  the  remaining  gaps  and  focusing  on\nsecondary-  and  tertiary-level  infrastructure  and  services.  The\nProject  represents  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB's)  second\ninvestment  in  the  Vientiane  urban  area,  and  builds  on  lessons\nlearned  from  the  experience  of  the  first  intervention,  the\nVientiane Integrated Urban Development Project.\n\nthe  willingness  of  village  communities \n\nThe  Project  components  follow:  (i)  part  A:  citywide  urban\ninfrastructure  and  services,  comprising  critical  missing  links  of\nprimary  and  secondary \nroads  and  drainage,  efficiency\nimprovements in solid waste management, traffic management\nand  safety,  and  institutional  infrastructure  and  maintenance\nimprovements;  (ii)  part  B:  village  area  improvements  (VAI),\nadopting a demand-led and participatory approach, seeking as\nto\na  prerequisite \nparticipate  in  and  contribute  to  a  portion  of  the  cost  of  the\nimprovements,  and  combining  community  infrastructure  and\nservices with community-level capacity building and awareness\nraising in environmental health, participatory local planning and\ncommunity-based \ninfrastructure  development  and  service\ndelivery;  and  (iii)  part  C:  a  comprehensive  capacity  building\nprogram to support the accomplishment of the urban policy and\nthe  planning,\ninstitutional \noperation and maintenance, revenue mobilization, and financial\nmanagement capabilities of VUDAA.\n\nreform  agenda,  and  enhance \n\nThe project cost is estimated at $37.0 million equivalent, of which\n$20.0  million  is  the  foreign  currency  cost  and  $17.0  million\nequivalent is the local currency cost.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \nSource\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n($ million)\n\nPercent\n\nAsian Development Bank\n\nGovernment\n\nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de\nD\u00e9veloppement\n\nCommunity\n\nTotal\n\n16.5\n\n0.0\n\n 3.5\n\n0.0\n\n20.0\n\n8.5\n\n7.2\n\n0.9\n\n0.4\n\n17.0\n\n25.0\n\n7.2\n\n4.4\n\n0.4\n\n37.0\n\n67\n\n20\n\n12\n\n1\n\n100\n\n\fLoan Amount and Terms\n\niii\n\nRelending Terms\n\nPeriod of Utilization\n\nUntil 28 February 2007\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\nA  loan  in  the  amount  of  SDR  20,023,000  ($25.0  million\nequivalent) in various currencies from  the  ADB's  Special Funds\nresources  will  be  provided  for  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a\ngrace period of 8 years, and with an interest rate of 1.0 percent\nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nthereafter.\n\nfrom \n\nthe  ADB \n\nVUDAA will contribute $2.9 million to the Project cost through\nloan\nthe  Government  using \na  subloan \nproceeds.

International competitive bidding\n(ICB) procedures will be used for major civil works contracts\nestimated  to  cost  over  $1.0  million  and  for  supply  contracts\nestimated to cost over $500,000. For civil works costing up to\n$1.0  million,  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures  will\nbe  used.  The  package  of  work  per  village  under  the  VAI\ncomponent  is  relatively  small,  ranging  from  $30,000  to\n$100,000.  The  works  are  labor-intensive  and  do  not  require\nsophisticated technologies. Therefore, for works estimated to\ncost  less  than  $50,000  and  where  the  capacity  of  the\ncommunity  to  undertake  the  works  is  adequate,  community\nparticipation in procurement will be applied.\n\nConsultants  under  the  loan  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in\naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants\nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging\ndomestic consultants.

This report is based on the reports prepared by\nTA  consultants  using  participatory  approaches,  the  Mission's  discussions  and  consultative\nmeetings with stakeholders, and understanding with central and provincial governments and the\nVientiane Urban Development Administration Authority (VUDAA), the implementing agency for\nthe proposed Project. The project framework is presented in Appendix 1.\n\nA.\n\nThe Urban Sector\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nWith  a  per  capita  income  of  about  $300,  the  Lao  PDR  is  one  of  the  least  developed\n3.\ncountries  in  Asia.  Poverty  incidence  is  estimated  at  38.6  percent.  The  United  Nations  human\ndevelopment index places the country in the bottom fifth of the world's nations. The country is\nessentially rural, but since the mid-1980s the expanded marketing and commercial opportunities\nfollowing economic liberalization stimulated urban growth. As a result, growing numbers of rural\npeople  were  drawn  to  the  urban  areas  in  search  of  better  livelihoods.  The  present  urban\npopulation of 0.85 million, which represents 17 percent of the total, is estimated to increase by\nmore  than  50  percent  over  the  next  10  years.  Although  the  economy  is  largely  rural,  with\nagriculture  accounting  for  some  50  percent  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  the  role  of  the\nurban sector is growing. During 1996-1998 the industry and services sector components of GDP\nincreased  at  average  annual  rates  of  11.5  and  7.2  percent,  respectively,  compared  with  4.3\npercent for agriculture, implying the productivity and associated opportunities in urban areas.\n\n4.\nVientiane, the capital city of the Lao PDR, is by far the largest urban area. The current\npopulation  of  the  Vientiane  urban  area3  is  estimated  at  162,000,  while  the  greater  Vientiane\nurban  area,4  within  the  boundaries  of  the  master  plan,  has  a  population  of  325,000  and  is\ngrowing  at  a  rate  of  3.3  percent  per  annum.  Four  major  provincial  capitals  with  populations\nranging  from  20,000  to  60,000  are  classified  as  secondary  towns.  The  remaining  provincial\n\n                                                \n1 \n2 \n\nTA 3333-LAO: Vientiane Urban Infrastructure and Services Project for $600,000, approved 10 December 1999.\nThe Mission comprised G. Cezayirli, Senior Urban Development Specialist/Mission Leader; T. Kanazawa, Senior\nProject Engineer (23-30 April 2001); R. O'Sullivan, Counsel (24-30 April 2001); and D. Bray, Urban Economist\nand Finance Specialist/Staff consultant (20 -26 April 2001).\nThe  Vientiane  urban  area,  covering  100  contiguous  villages  with  urban  character  within  Vientiane,  was\ndesignated in 1995 as the urban area where VUDAA is responsible for planning, infrastructure development, and\nservice delivery. VUDAA's responsibility for solid waste management, however, goes beyond 100 villages, and\ncovers all 189 villages within the Vientiane master plan boundaries.\nThe  greater  Vientiane  area  within  the  master  plan  boundaries  covers,  in  addition  to  Vientiane  urban  area,  the\nperipheral areas where urban expansion is taking place and includes 189 villages in seven districts. \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n\f2\n\ncapitals  and  some  district  centers  with  urban  characteristics  have  populations  between  5,000\nand 20,000. The primacy of Vientiane in the urbanization process is marked and is expected to\ncontinue. The government sector, and commerce and trade, employing over 50 percent of the\nlabor  force,  dominate  the  city\u2019s  economy.  Virtually  all  domestic  and  export  earning  industrial\nproduction takes place in Vientiane. Tourism is also a high-growth sector, as the city is a focus\nof tourism promotion and is on one of the emerging tourism circuits in the region. The role and\ndevelopment potential of Vientiane is reinforced by its strategic location as the gateway to the\ncentral  part  of  the  country  in  the  Greater  Mekong  subregion  (GMS),  and  on  the  route  of  land\nbridges linking Thailand with the People's Republic of China and Vietnam. Vientiane is expected\nto become an important center for distribution, and logistic activities and higher value production\nrelated to GMS cooperation. It is estimated that GDP associated with the city rose by 10 percent\nbetween 1998-1999 and 1999-2000.\n\n1.\n\nUrban Environment and Infrastructure and Services\n\n5.\nWhile  infrastructure  and  services  in  Vientiane  have  improved  significantly  over  the  last\nfive years with major investments in primary roads and drainage funded by ADB,5 other funding\nagencies, and the Government, a focus on primary infrastructure constrained the ability of the\nnewly  constructed  infrastructure  to  realize  its  full  potential  benefits.  There  remains  a  need  for\nfurther  development  to  (i)  maximize  the  utility  of  the  existing  primary  networks  and  allow  a\ngreater  share  of  population,  especially  the  poor,  to  benefit  from  environmental  improvements;\nand (ii) control future environmental degradation. Storm-water drainage is the key infrastructure\ndevelopment  issue.  Flooding  continues  to  occur  away  from  the  main  drainage  network\ndeveloped with recent investments, and stagnant polluted wastewater still lies in open roadside\nchannels  because  the  primary  network  is  incomplete  and  the  secondary  and  tertiary  networks\nare largely unimproved. There are almost 300 kilometers (km) of drainage channels within the\nurban area, of which about 162 km are either in poor or very poor condition. Moreover, lack of\nroutine  cleaning,  maintenance,  and  rehabilitation  constrains  the  proper  functioning  of  the\nexisting systems.\n\n6.\nThe  impact  of  poor  sanitation  on  the  city  as  a  whole  is  significant  in  terms  of  potential\nhealth risks. There is no sewerage system, and sanitation is primarily through on-site facilities. A\nseptage disposal and treatment facility was constructed and maintenance systems initiated with\nADB  assistance.  While  74  percent  of  the  urban  households  have  access  to  on-site  sanitation\nfacilities,  these  facilities  are  generally  poorly  designed  and  constructed,  and  perform\ninadequately.  Moreover,  the  prevailing  methods  and  frequency  for  treatment  and  disposal  of\nwastewater are inadequate. A flat terrain, high water table, and low soil permeability exacerbate\nthe  problems  with  the  present  system  of  on-site  sanitation,  resulting  in  failure  of  the  systems,\noverflow of effluent, and pollution of surface waters and drains. It is common practice to dispose\nof  sullage  in  surface  drains  and  drainage  channels.  The  storm-water  drainage  system  is\ngenerally  contaminated  by  wastewater  that  ends  up  in  wetlands  and  marshes,  contributing\nfurther  to  environmental  degradation.  Lack  of  an  effective  system  for  maintenance  and\nenforcement of sanitation regulations compounds these problems.\n\nSolid waste collection coverage and disposal have improved with recent investments in\n7.\nequipment,  construction  of  a  workshop,  and  development  of  a  landfill  disposal  site.  However,\nhalf of the urban population, especially those in low-income areas where there is no vehicular\naccess,  is  not  covered  by  the  system.  Inadequate  solid  waste  management  also  hinders  the\nproper  functioning  of  the  drainage  system.  The  operational  and  management  efficiency  of  the\n\n                                                \n5 \n\nLoan 1362-LAO: Vientiane Integrated Urban Development Project, for $20 million, approved on 17 August 1995.\n\n\f3\n\nsolid waste collection and disposal service is currently low and requires further improvements to\nrealize the full potential of the system.\n\n8.\nOf the approximately 300 km of roads within the Vientiane urban area, only one third are\npaved.  The  remaining  roads,  which  are  mainly  earth  or  gravel,  are  in  poor  condition.\nConsequently,  large  volumes  of  mud  are  carried  by  vehicles  onto  newly  constructed  primary\nroads  especially  during  the  monsoon  period.  This  compounds  inadequate  maintenance  and\naccelerates deterioration of the roads. The growing use of motorized vehicles on unpaved roads\ncontributes  to  respiratory  problems  caused  by  suspended  particulate  matter.  Tertiary  roads,\nwhich  account  for  almost  half  of  the  road  network,  are  usually  impassable  to  vehicles  after\nheavy  rainfall.  Very  few  roads  are  adequately  lit,  contributing  to  traffic  accidents  and  personal\ninsecurity at night. The standards for road discipline and traffic management are poor. There is\na high incidence of traffic accidents with road casualties at alarming levels. During 1995-1999,\nfatalities per year averaged 12.5 per 10,000 registered vehicles, which is markedly higher than\nthe figures for other countries in the region.\n\n2.\n\nUrban Poverty\n\n9.\nA  participatory  poverty  assessment,  conducted  under  the  TA  for  preparing  the  Project,\nsuggests that 18 percent of the city's households can be classified as poor6, including 3 percent\nwho  belong  to  the  poorest  groups  where  individual  cash  income  may  be  only  $8  per  month.\nUnlike other cities in the region, where the poor reside in well-defined slum areas, the poor in\nVientiane  are  distributed  throughout  the  city  in  heterogeneous  urban  communities  where  they\noften live adjacent to properties of higher income families. There is considerable diversity in the\nconditions  and  requirements  of  the  poor,  and  a  gradation  of  services  and  infrastructure  is\nrequired to meet the specific needs of and levels of affordability to various groups of the poor.\nThe vast majority of the poor live in low-lying wetland areas, which are flooded for most of the\nyear, and where water can reach depths of over a meter during the wet season. These areas\nare  acutely  underserviced,  links  from  dwellings  to  access  roads  are  via  difficult  routes,  and  in\nmost  cases,  are  via  narrow  timber  planks  balanced  above  contaminated  floodwater.  The  poor\ndo  not  have  access  to  a  typical  range  of  sanitation  options.  Conditions  are  unhygienic,  water-\nand  feces-borne  diseases  are  highly  prevalent,  and  many  elderly  people  are  trapped  in  their\nhouses  during  rainy  season.  Flooding  also  hinders  subsistence  economic  activities  such  as\ngrowing  vegetables  and  raising  small  livestock,  risking  the  food  security  of  the  poor.  There  is\nvirtually  no  practice  of  household  or  community  management  of  solid  waste.  The  participatory\npoverty  assessment  reveals  that  the  problems  most  frequently  identified  by  the  poor  are\ndrainage, poor access roads, uncollected rubbish, and sanitation.\n\nin \n\nthese  areas  are \n\nThe  service  deficiencies \n\n10.\nlinked,  exacerbating\nenvironmental  conditions.  Sanitation  problems  are  compounded  by  constant  flooding.  The\ntendency of the poor to ignore proper solid waste disposal is linked to lack of access to roads.\nLack of adequate land for the construction of better sanitary disposal of human waste and lack\nof access to septic tank disposal limit the options to upgrade services. An integrated approach\nto  improvements  in  these  areas  is  essential  and  a  package  of  service  improvements  must  be\ndeveloped to address the specific needs in each locality.\n\ninextricably \n\n                                                \n6 The participatory poverty assessment categorized poor families on the basis of income levels and other indicators\n(assets, eating habits, access to services, etc.). The assessment indicated that 18 percent of the households within\nthe Vientiane urban area fall into the lowest two poverty categories, with an income of less than KN150,000. This is\nclose to the poverty incidence rate of 16.7 percent determined for the Vientiane urban area by Lao Expenditure and\nConsumption Survey based on the equivalent income needed to purchase 2,100 calories per person per day plus\nsome expenditure for nonfood items.\n\n\f4\n\n11.\nLack of access to land and shelter is also an issue among the poor in Vientiane. While\nthere is no clear evidence of squatters occupying private or state land illegally, about 10 percent\nof the population is estimated to rent their shelter from other private property owners. The issue\nof  land  and  shelter  is  aggravated  by  a  land  gentrification  process  associated  with  the  lack  of\nformal  land  use  rights  in  the  Lao  PDR  and  uncontrolled  development,  whereby  the  non-poor\ninfringe upon marginal areas where the poor live. It is important that the Government's program\nfor  land  titling  be  completed,  and  uncontrolled  development  prevented  with  effective  urban\nplanning and development control.\n\n3.\n\nBuilt-Up Environment\n\n12.\nThe  Vientiane  urban  area  is  growing  in  an  unplanned  manner.  While  the  city  has  a\nmaster  plan,  a  zoning  system,  and  development  control  procedures,  supported  by  a  Planning\nLaw, the system in its current form and operation has limited impact on urban development, and\nhas  failed  to  guide  growth.  The  master  plan,  approved  in  1992  and  revised  recently,  cannot\nmanage contemporary urban growth in the absence of a program approach and local area plans\nthat provide a clear basis for building control. There is no policy at present for a number of large\nopen spaces that have the potential to develop in a haphazard manner. The master plan does\nnot include a strategy to protect the unique cultural heritage in the central part of Vientiane that\nis  threatened  by  uncontrolled  development.  In  addition,  the  revised  master  plan  allows\nconversion  of  a  number  of  wetlands,  which  function  as  natural  flood  retention  basins,  to\nresidential  use.  There  is  an  urgent  need  for  a  program  of  plans  to  address  these  issues  and\nensure that development in Vientiane is environmentally and culturally sustainable and that the\nremaining vacant land in the city's urban fabric is used appropriately and efficiently.\n\n13.\nFurther,  the  master  plan,  prepared  under  the  centralized  planning  system,  prevailing\nuntil recently, lacks ownership by the urban stakeholders, including VUDAA that is responsible\nfor  implementing  the  plan.  While  VUDAA  is  now  empowered  to  undertake  local  planning  and\ncontrol development and building construction in the Vientiane urban area, its current capacity\nto  do  so  is  inadequate.  The  effective  implementation  of  the  plan  is  further  constrained  by  the\nexisting  zoning  system  and  regulations  that  are  too  complex  to  be  implemented  by  an\norganization like VUDAA with little capacity to enforce zoning and regulations.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n1.\n\nMajor Policy Principles\n\n14.\nThe  Government  recognizes  the  significance  of  the  urban  areas  in  the  national\ndevelopment  process  and  has  included  urban  development  as  an  investment  line  in  its  public\ninvestment  program.  In  the  context  of  its  policy  for  raising  living  standards  in  rural  areas,  the\nGovernment is also concerned with the complementary and supportive role of urban centers in\nrural  development.  The  investment  program  for  2000-2003  emphasizes  strengthening  urban-\nrural linkages by adopting appropriate urban development strategies whereby the role of urban\nareas  as  market  and  service  centers  for  the  rural  population  and  products  is  enhanced  to\nachieve broad-based development.\n\n15.\nThe  Government  reconfirmed  poverty  reduction  as  its  overarching  objective  in  the\nSeventh Round Table Meeting (RTM) held in November 2000. In the longer term, the objective\nis  to  graduate,  by  2020,  from  the  group  of  least  developed  countries.  In  the  short  term,  the\ngovernor  of  Vientiane  has  made  it  a  key  development  objective  to  eradicate  urban  poverty  in\nVientiane  by  the  year  2005.  The  Government  recognizes  the  need  for  (i)  deepening  its\nunderstanding  of  the  extent  and  nature  of  poverty,  (ii)  developing  and  adopting  a  coherent\n\n\f5\n\nframework  as  basis  for  investments  in  poverty  reduction,  and  (iii)  continued  monitoring  of\npoverty  and  its  impact.  In  a  recent  policy  address,  the  governor  stated  that  the  three  key\nstrategies  to  combat  poverty  are  providing  adequate  and  reasonable  quality  of  living  space,\nlivelihood,  and  education  for  the  poor.  A  poverty  reduction  committee,  to  be  chaired  by  the\ngovernor, is being formed to prepare an action plan and monitor efforts for poverty reduction in\nVientiane.\n\n16.\nIncreasing  urbanization  led  to  the  recognition  of  the  need  for  enhanced  urban\nmanagement  that  could  be  achieved  with  decentralized  urban  administration.  Gradual\ndecentralization has been a key element of the Government's urban sector policy since 1995. In\nthe  Seventh  RTM,  the  Government  reaffirmed  its  commitment  to  decentralization  and  local\ngovernance reform initiatives in urban areas, redefining the role and culture of the Government,\nand  rationalization  of  central-local  relations.  In  addition  to  the  roles  of  provinces  and  districts,\nthe roles of villages are underlined as the lowest levels of Government located in the proximity\nof  urban  communities  and  an  important  point  of  interface  between  the  community  and  the\nGovernment.  Villages  are  envisaged  to  play  an  important  role  in  planning  and  monitoring\nis  equitable  and  participatory.\ndevelopment  activities \nDecentralization is, therefore, viewed as both a means for effective urban management and as\nan  important  strategy  for  poverty  reduction.  The  Government  considers  capacity  building  and\nhuman  resource  development  as  the  major  challenge  and  priority  in  the  process  of\ndecentralization.\n\nthat  development \n\nto  ensure \n\n2.\n\nUrban Governance and Finance in Transition\n\nUrban  governance  in  the  Lao  PDR  has  undergone  a  major  transition  over  the  last  five\n17.\nyears.  Until  recently  the  country  did  not  have  a  distinct  and  decentralized  system  of  urban\nadministration.  The  Ministry  of  Communication,  Transport,  Posts,  and  Construction  (MCTPC),\nthrough  its  provincial  and  prefectural  departments,  was  responsible  for  urban  planning  and\nmanagement along with its responsibility for rural areas. Public sector investment in urban areas\nwas  financed  entirely  through  the  annual  budget  allocations  from  national  to  provincial\ngovernments,  without  considering  local  plans  and  budget  requirements.  No  specific  budget\nheading was made for urban infrastructure maintenance. In 1995, the Government launched a\nprogram  of  decentralization  and  created  the  Vientiane  Urban  Development  and  Management\nCommittee  (VUDMC)  as  a  legal  urban  entity.  A  decentralized  form  of  urban  governance  was\nadvanced  with  the  consolidation  of  VUDMC  as  VUDAA  in  1999.  VUDAA  was  envisioned  to\neventually  become  an  autonomous  urban  local  government  with  (i)  responsibilities  and\ncommensurate  capacities  for  planning  and  managing  infrastructure  and  services  within  the\nVientiane urban area, and (ii) its own sources of revenue and budget to meet its expenditures\nfor  the  delegated  tasks.  The  creation  of  a  distinct  and  decentralized  urban  entity  in  Vientiane\nwas followed by the establishment in 1997 of urban development and administration authorities\n(UDAAs) in four major secondary towns.\n\n18.\nThe Government's commitment to decentralization has become the dominant theme of a\nnumber  of  prime  ministerial  (PM)  decrees,  instructions,  decisions,  notifications,  and  policy\nstatements. Most significant in the decentralization process are decrees 177/PM issued in 1997\nand  14/PM  in  1999,  and  the  operational  instructions  of  141/PM  issued  in  May  2000  for\nimplementing  decrees  177/PM  and  14/PM.  These  decrees  recognize  UDAAs  in  Vientiane  and\nsecondary towns as legal entities exclusively responsible for urban communities, and define the\nposition of UDAAs as organizations within provincial and prefectural administrative apparatuses.\nUDAAs  are  delegated  tasks  to  plan,  implement,  manage,  and  control  urban  development\nactivities, including roads, drainage, collection and disposal of waste, sanitation and protection\nof environment, public lighting, preventing riverbank erosion, and maintaining public parks. The\n\n\f6\n\ndelegated  tasks  include  land  use  planning  and  building  control  in  cooperation  with  other\nagencies.  More  importantly,  the  decrees  empower  UDAAs  to  raise  revenues  within  the  levels\nset  by  the  central  Government,  from  a  range  of  sources  including  service  fees  and  charges,\nincome from movable or immovable property, sharing of national taxes, borrowing loans, local\nand foreign grants, and allocations of funds from the central Government. UDAAs are entrusted\nwith  using  these  funds  to  perform  the  delegated  tasks.  Finally,  the  decrees  also  provide\nguidelines on the organizational structure and working procedures of UDAAs.\n\n19. Within the framework of the foregoing decrees, VUDAA has been gradually developing\nitself  as  an  urban  entity.  It  has  made  some  progress  in  developing  its  organizational  structure\nand  capacity  to  prepare  for  its  new  responsibilities.  The  president  or  mayor  of  the  VUDAA  is\nvice governor of the Vientiane Prefecture, and VUDAA is managed by a board chaired by the\npresident and comprising the heads of the four districts in the Vientiane urban area. VUDAA has\na  manager  who  is  the  most  senior  staff  member  in  the  organization.  The  manager  acts  as\nsecretary  to  the  VUDAA  board.  There  are  two  deputy  managers  responsible  for  technical  and\nadministrative matters, respectively. Under this management structure, VUDAA has at present\nfive  major  divisions.  It  has  about  70  technical  and  administrative  staff,  and  about  160  field\nworkers. The number of staff recruited over the last quarter of 2000, has significantly increased.\nStaff  have  been  transferred  from  other  departments  of  the  Vientiane  Prefecture,  and  recruited\nfrom outside. More importantly, the governor of Vientiane issued, in December 2000, Decision\n1804 that allowed VUDAA to levy and collect a range of specific direct and indirect user charges\nand fees, including charges for solid waste collection, desludging services, and fees for vehicle\nparking,  building  permits,  advertising  signs,  leasing  public  land,  urban  obligation  fees  from  all\nbuildings  and  commercial  outlets,  and  surcharges  for  water,  electricity,  and  fuel  consumption.\nThe  governor's  decision  was  confirmed  by  a  PM  decision,  21/PM,  on  26  April  2001  to  ensure\nthat  the  income,  to  be  generated  through  water  and  electricity  surcharges,  will  be  made\navailable  to  VUDAA.  These  initiatives  in  the  urban  sector  are  also  supportive  of  the  national\ngoals  of  the  Government  for  domestic  resource  mobilization  to  finance  recurrent  expenditures\nfor social development and to sustain existing physical assets.\n\n20.\nHowever,  in  moving  from  a  centralized  form  of  urban  governance  to  a  decentralized\nmode,  the  Government  faces  a  number  of  further  challenges.  The  Lao  PDR's  existing\nConstitution does not provide for a distinct urban territorial authority. In addition, the provisions\nof  the  prevailing  State  Budget  Law,  which  stipulates  a  centralized  financial  system,  are  not\ncompatible  with  the  Government's  policy  of  decentralized  revenue  generation  and  financial\nmanagement reflected in the foregoing decrees. Apart from inconsistency in the legal basis, the\ncurrent position of the UDAAs in the national territorial hierarchy is ambiguous. The position of\nUDAAs as administrative units of provincial and prefectural governments does not fully conform\nto the concept of autonomous urban local governments. In addition, the interface and linkages\nof UDAAs with other tiers of administration and with district authorities are not clearly defined,\nespecially  in  the  case  of  VUDAA  whose  geographic  jurisdiction  cuts  across  four  districts.  The\nPM's instruction 01/PM, issued in March 2000, which stipulates decentralization from central to\nlower  levels  of  Governments  and  defines  the  province  as  the  strategic  unit,  the  district  as  the\nbudget  and  planning  unit,  and  the  village  as  implementing  unit,  makes  no  reference  to  urban\nauthorities. There is also the issue of the geographic jurisdiction of the authority of VUDAA. The\nVientiane  urban  area,  for  which  VUDAA  is  responsible,  was  determined  in  1995.  The  existing\nboundary of the Vientiane urban area does not cover the urban area, recently developed on the\noutskirts  of  the  city,  and  is  leading  to    inconsistencies  in  the  approach  to  and  the  levels  of\nservices.\n\n21. While  VUDAA  derives  power  from  the  foregoing  decrees  to  raise  revenues  and  utilize\nthem for the urban tasks, as a department of the Vientiane Prefecture VUDAA needs to obtain\n\n\f7\n\napproval from the central Government when setting charges, from the Governor for its annual\nbudget, and from the Vientiane Prefecture administration for expenses above an agreed upon\nthreshold,  resulting  in  incomplete  financial  autonomy  for  VUDAA.  A  great  deal  of  effort  is\nassociated  with  setting  up  the  cost  recovery  measures  within  VUDAA,  and  there  is  broad\nconsensus  in  the  Government  on  their  implementation.  However,  some  issues  are  associated\nwith the recently adopted cost recovery measures. The structure of charges and fees does not\nfully  reflect  the  principles  of  equity  and  consumption  levels  of  services.  Following  the\nGovernment's  decentralization  process,  responsibility  for  collecting  some  national  taxes  has\nbeen devolved to the village authorities. While village-level collection of revenue is likely to lead\nto  greater  transparency,  a  framework  has  yet  to  be  established  to  ensure  transparency  and\nincreased collection efficiency.\n\n22.\nThe overall capacity of VUDAA to effectively perform its new functions and to exercise\nits power to generate revenue and manage its financial resources needs further strengthening.\nManagement  and  operational  systems  are  in  the  process  of  being  established.  The  staff\nrecently increased, but in many cases new members lack experience and skills appropriate to\ntheir  respective  positions.  There  is  need  to  further  develop  management  systems  and  human\nresources to enable VUDAA to perform its delegated tasks better. The scale of reforms toward\nan entirely distinct system of decentralized urban governance in the Lao PDR in general, and in\nVientiane  in  particular,  necessitates  extensive  and  long-term  support  for  the  reforms  and\nassociated capacity building for VUDAA.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance\n\nThe Lao PDR has received considerable assistance from external aid agencies in urban\n23.\ndevelopment. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), through the UN Centre for\nHuman Settlements Development, supported the establishment and strengthening of the Urban\nResearch Institute, providing training and assistance in the preparation of urban plans. UNDP is\ncurrently  assisting  in  the  Governance  and  Public  Administration  Reform  Programme,  which\nincludes local administration reforms. The World Bank (WB), in cooperation with the Australian\nAgency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  has  been  engaged  in  a  long-term  land-titling\nprogram  that  will  provide  secure  land  ownership  and  facilitate  local  resource  mobilization  by\nmeans  of  improved  land  tax  registration  and  the  potential  to  introduce  effective  property\ntaxation.  The  program  is  under  way  in  Vientiane  and  as  of  January  2001,  57  villages  in  the\nVientiane urban area have completed the process, and around 13,000 out of about 49,000 titles\nhave  been  issued.  The  United  Nations  Capital  Development  Fund  (UNCDF)  helped  in  a  pilot\nproject to upgrade low-income areas. The project included a successful microcredit scheme that\nis  now  being  expanded  into  four  urban  districts  of  Vientiane  under  the  Microfinance  and\nSustainable  Livelihood  Project.  The  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  the\nEuropean  Union,  and  the  Government  of  Denmark  are  active  in  environmental  improvements,\ntreatment,  sanitation,  and  riverbank  protection,\nsolid  waste  management,  wastewater \ncomplementing  ADB\u2019s  investments  in  Vientiane.  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD),\nwhich has been involved in a more limited area of the urban sector and with focus on cultural\nheritage protection and water supply, is now expanding its involvement to urban infrastructure\ndevelopment  and  capacity  building.  While  external  assistance  in  the  sector  is  generally\nconsistent  and  complementary,  the  experience  suggests  the  need  for  a  more  effective\ncoordination  among  the  activities  of  funding  agencies  to  ensure  concerted  efforts  toward\ncommon  sector  goals.  Appendix  2  gives  detailed  information  on  the  external  support  to  the\nurban sector in Vientiane.\n\n24.\nADB has one of the largest portfolios of development assistance to the Lao PDR, and is\nthe major external agency in the urban sector. Its involvement in urban development in the Lao\n\n\f8\n\nPDR  began  in  1974  with  water  supply  projects.  Five  loans  ($58  million)  were  provided  since\nthen to rehabilitate and expand water supply systems in Vientiane, and in provincial and small\ntowns.  Investments  in  water  supply  were  accompanied  by  efforts  to  develop  a  regulatory\nframework,  attain  financial  sustainability,  and  decentralize  the  management  of  water  supply.\nADB's involvement with integrated development of urban areas began in 1993 with the TA for\nthe  Vientiane  Integrated  Urban  Development  Project  (VIUDP)  and  the  subsequent  loan.  This\ncontinued  with  the  TA  to  prepare  the  Secondary  Towns  Urban  Development  Project  in  1996,\nfollowed by a further loan.7 The latter two loans were supplemented by three TA8s ($1.8 million)\nto support the Government efforts for policy and institutional reforms in the sector and capacity\nbuilding for sector institutions.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nThe proposed Project is the second loan for urban development in Vientiane. The city,\n25.\nbeing  the  country's  principal  urban  center,  was  the  beneficiary  of  ADB's  first  broad-based\nassistance, VIUDP, whose experience is regarded to be the most relevant to the Project. A loan\nof  $20  million  was  provided  in  1995  to  fund  a  range  of  infrastructure  improvements,  including\nroads,  drainage,  solid  waste  management,  and  sanitation  with  a  main  focus  on  primary\ninfrastructure and services. VIUDP also included an institutional strengthening component and a\nsocial  action  program  to  ensure  community  participation  and  support.  The  physical  and  social\ncomponents  under  VIUDP  were  accompanied  by  a  significant  policy  agenda  to  support\ndecentralized urban governance, creation of urban-focused entities, local resource mobilization,\nand  improved  human  resources,  all  of  which  formed  the  components  of  a  time-bound  action\nplan and the loan covenants.\n\n26.\nVIUDP  is  now  complete  and  has  resulted  in  notable  improvements  in  the  urban\nenvironment.  Road  improvements  led  to  improved  transport  efficiencies  and  reduced  traffic\ncongestion and air pollution. Drainage, sanitation, and solid waste management improvements\nhave  resulted  in  reduced  levels  of  urban  pollution  and  significant  gains  in  public  health.  All\nproject  components  were  implemented  successfully,  except  the  on-site  sanitation  component\nwhose implementation was constrained by inadequate household demand associated with lack\nof  affordability  and  technologies  appropriate  for  specific  local  conditions  within  Vientiane.  The\nsocial action program proved effective in disseminating information on project interventions and\ngaining community support for the project, especially the solid waste management component\nand project-related land acquisition, although the latter seemed to demand a disproportionately\ngreater  time  and  resources.  While  progress  on  the  overall  policy  agenda  was  slower  than\nenvisaged, VIUDP, whereby the core structure of VUDAA was created, pioneered the evolution\nof  a  distinct  urban  institutional  framework  and  decentralized  urban  governance.  A  training\nfacility, created under VIUDP to deliver courses in urban planning and management, has had a\nwide  impact  on  transferring  knowledge  and  skills  on  urban  management  to  the  staff  of  urban\nagencies, including VUDAA.\n\n27.\nThe experience of earlier ADB assistance indicates the need for a consultative approach\nduring  project  preparation  and  careful  design  and  implementation  of  community  mobilization\nprograms to (i) ensure that the stakeholders feel a sense of project ownership, (ii) better target\nthe poor, (iii) derive sustained benefits from physical improvements, and (iv) solicit community\nsupport  for  reforms.  The  review  of  the  earlier  assistance  also  suggests  that  a  demand-led\n                                                \n7 \n8\n\nLoan 1525-LAO: Secondary Towns Urban Development Project, for $27 million, approved on 26 June 1997.\nThese  include:  (i)  TA  2377-LAO: Establishing Municipal Administration System, for  $700,000,  approved  on  17\nAugust 1995; (ii) TA 2972-LAO: Support to Urban Development Administrations, for $500,000, approved on 31\nDecember 1997 and (iii) TA 3331-LAO: Capacity Building for Urban Development Administration, for $600,000,\napproved on 10 December 1999.\n\n\f9\n\napproach should be followed in providing infrastructure and services. A gradation of services will\nfacilitate responsiveness to the needs and affordability requirements of various income groups.\nFurther,  the  experience  reveals  that  institutional  reforms  can  be  achieved  with  broad-based\nsupport, and consensus building requires a longer period of time than that envisaged. Reforms\nneed to be introduced in a progressive manner commensurate with capacities, to be supported\nby extensive and well-targeted capacity building programs. Other lessons highlight the need for\ngreater  emphasis  on  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  increased  capacities  for  project\nmanagement within the Government, and improved contractors' performance.\n\nE.\n\nADB's Sector Strategy in the Lao PDR\n\n28. With the changing circumstances in the Lao PDR and the renewed commitment of ADB\nand  the  Government  to  poverty  reduction,  ADB  is  now  in  the  process  of  revisiting  its  country\noperational  strategy.  The  new  strategy,  currently  being  prepared  on  the  basis  of  the\nGovernment's Fifth Five-Year Socioeconomic Development Plan, 2001-2005, will have poverty\nreduction  as  its  overarching  objective.  ADB  will  support  reforms  for  effective  macroeconomic\nmanagement, good governance, capacity building, and human resource development. Domestic\nresource  mobilization,  participatory  development,  and  private  sector  participation  are  also\nimportant building blocks of ADB's strategy. In accordance with the country operational strategy,\nthe focus of ADB assistance in the urban sector will be on basic urban services, and improving\nthe  environment  and  the  quality  of  life  of  the  urban  residents,  with  greater  emphasis  on  the\nneeds of the poor. ADB's sector strategy will seek to utilize existing urban potentials to support\nbroad-based  regional  development  and  reduce  poverty  within  both  urban  and  rural\ncommunities. In addition to its assistance to date in Vientiane and secondary towns, small towns\nwill be the focus of ADB's interventions in future. ADB will continue to support the creation of an\nenabling  legal,  institutional,  and  financial  framework  for  enhanced  urban  management.  The\nareas  of  policy  dialogue  will  cover  (i)  legal  reforms  for  effective  decentralization,  (ii)\nadministrative  and  financial  devolution  to  UDAAs,  (iii)  local  resource  mobilization  and  cost\nrecovery,  (iv)  reforms  for  responsive  and  pro-poor  urban  governance,  (v)  interventions  for\neffective  planning,  (vi)  urban  poverty  reduction,  and  (vii)  private  sector  involvement  in  the\ndelivery of urban services. Capacity building efforts, including in planning, revenue mobilization,\nfinancial  management,  and  O&M,  will  be  pursued  to  strengthen  newly  established  urban\nauthorities.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nSince  VIUDP,  ADB  has  continued  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government.  Along  with\n29.\nurban  infrastructure  and  environmental  improvements,  creation  of  an  appropriate  legal,\ninstitutional, and financial framework for decentralized urban governance and establishment of\nurban-focused  local  authorities  have  been  the  main  thrust  of  ADB\u2019s  assistance.  A  strong\nemphasis  has  been  placed  on  mobilizing  local  resources  and  cost  recovery  measures  as  an\nintegral  element  of  institutional  reforms  and  a  prerequisite  for  sustainable  delivery  of  services.\nThese objectives have been the salient components of a policy and institutional reform agenda\nset out under VIUDP, and incorporated into the loan covenants agreed to by the Government.\nADB-assisted  urban  projects  in  Vientiane  and  secondary  towns  were  milestones  for  urban\nsector development built on key policy reforms that fully supported the Government efforts for\nthe  creation  of  a  decentralized  form  of  urban  governance.  The  establishment  of  VUDAA  was\ninitiated under VIUDP. The loan for the Secondary Towns Urban Development Project led to the\ncreation of similar authorities in four other major secondary towns. With two completed and one\nongoing  advisory  TAs,  ADB  has  supported  the  institutionalization  and  strengthening  of  newly\nestablished urban-focused local authorities.\n\n\f10\n\n30.\nDuring  project  preparation  an  assessment  of  ongoing  sector  reforms  was  undertaken.\nNoting the slow progress with the policy reform agenda under earlier projects, ADB has pursued\nactive  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  on  the  accomplishment  of  the  targeted  reforms.\nAlthough somewhat slow, the Government took steps to meet the targets of the reform agenda.\nHowever,  more  needs  to  be  done  by  the  Government  to  achieve  full  decentralization.  The\ncontent  of  the  policy  dialogue,  which  builds  on  the  already  initiated  reforms  together  with  the\npolicy  reforms  agreed  upon  in  previous  ADB  projects,  covers  the  remaining  steps  to  be\naccomplished in the decentralization process. Appendix 3 gives a matrix of the urban policy and\ninstitutional  reform  agenda  to  which  the  Government  has  agreed.  Within  the  next  five  years,\nVUDAA  is  envisioned  to  advance  to  a  stage  where  it  is  financially  and  administratively\nautonomous, can successfully manage its urban functions, and can have its services paid for.\n\n1.\n\nEnabling Legal Framework for Decentralization and Devolution\n\n31.\nADB  has  supported  the  creation  of  a  legal  framework  for  decentralized  urban\ngovernance. ADB projects and TAs have been instrumental in the issuance of a number of PM\ndecrees, instructions, and notices that have formed an initial legal base for devolving functions\nand financial powers to UDAAs. At this stage, there is need for further legal reforms to establish\na  strong  and  clear  legal  and  constitutional  basis  for  decentralized  urban  governance  and\nfinance.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  complete  its  review  and  submit  to  the  National\nAssembly  draft  bills  for  the  constitutional  amendment  and  the  Law  on  Local  Administration.\nConsistency  among  the  pieces  of  legislation  with  respect  to  the  role  and  status  of  UDAAs  will\nalso  be  ensured.  The  Project  will  assist  the  Government  in  the  further  development  of  a  clear\nlegal framework for decentralized urban governance.\n\n2. \n\nFinancial Devolution, Local Resource Mobilization, and Cost Recovery\n\nis \n\nfinancial \n\nresources, \n\nfundamental \n\nADB  has  recognized  that  financial  devolution,  whereby  UDAAs  have  control  over  the\n32.\nto  successful\ngeneration  and  management  of \ndecentralization.  Accordingly,  ADB  has  supported  the  delegation  to  UDAAs  of  power  to\ngenerate  and  manage  their  own  revenues  in  performing  their  tasks.  With  a  number  of  PM\ndecrees,  UDAAs  were  empowered  to  levy  and  collect  user  charges  and  taxes.  In  December\n2000, the governor of Vientiane Prefecture issued Decision 1804 which provides VUDAA with a\nsound fiscal basis to achieve resource mobilization and cost recovery from a limited number of\nincome  sources  at  low  administration  costs  and  the  potential  to  generate  substantial  revenue.\nThe implementation of the Decision 1804 is a major element of the urban policy and institutional\nreform  agenda  to  which  the  Government  agreed.  The  Government  made  a  commitment  to\nprovide  all  administrative  and  staffing  support  to  VUDAA  to  ensure  that  VUDAA  will  generate\nrevenues from the sources made available to it through the governor's Decision, to meet at least\n50 percent of the costs incurred in providing services and undertaking O&M by 1 October 2003\nand  100  percent  by  2006.  The  Project  will  help  VUDAA  to  (i)  levy  and  collect  charges  in  an\neffective  manner,  (ii)  undertake  a  review  of  the  charges  to  ensure  social  equity,  (iii)  gradually\nincrease  the  rates  of  charges  and  fees  to  achieve  cost  recovery  targets,  and  (iv)  undertake\nimproved budgeting and accounting practices.\n\n3.\n\nAdministrative and Geographic Jurisdiction of VUDAA\n\n33.\nUDAAs  currently  fall  under  the  respective  provincial  governments  and,  in  the  case  of\nVUDAA under the Vientiane Prefecture, although they differ from other provincial departments\nas they are empowered to levy and collect revenues. It is essential that VUDAA eventually be\nrecognized  as  an  administratively  autonomous  organization  with  clearly  defined  linkages  with\nother  tiers  such  as  Vientiane  Prefecture  and  other  ministries,  especially  MCTPC  and  the\n\n\f11\n\nMinistry  of  Finance  (MOF).  The  issue  of  geographic  jurisdiction  of  VUDAA,  which  currently\nexcludes a substantial portion of the adjacent urban area, also needs to be addressed. Under\nthe  urban  policy  and  reform  agenda  to  be  implemented  in  conjunction  with  the  Project,  the\nGovernment  agreed  that  the  interface  between  and  the  roles  of  the  central,  provincial,  and\ndistrict governments, and UDAAs will be clearly defined. The geographic jurisdiction of VUDAA\nwill  be  gradually  expanded  to  coincide  with  the  expanded  urban  area  of  Vientiane  along  with\ncommensurate capacity building for VUDAA.\n\n4.\n\nGood Governance\n\n34.\nEstablishment  of  VUDAA  and  UDAAs,  whereby  the  urban  administration  is  brought\ncloser to the people, is a major step to good governance. Recent experience with UDAAs has\nclearly  shown  increased  interaction  between  the  urban  community  and  the  Government.\nHowever,  further  reforms  are  required  to  harness  the  full  potential  of  decentralized  urban\ngovernance  to  promote  good  governance  reflected  as  participatory  management,  downward\naccountability, and transparency in urban affairs. The recent policy of the Government to assign\nto the villages a greater role in development provides an immense scope to promote responsive\ngovernance  in  managing  urban  areas.  The  Project  will  support  the  establishment  and\ninstitutionalization of mechanisms for enhanced two-way communication between VUDAA and\nthe  villages.  The  Project  approaches,  which  reinforce  the  roles  of  village  organizations  and\ncommunities, will catalyze reforms for responsive urban governance. The capacities of VUDAA,\nvillage organizations, and communities in participatory urban management will be strengthened.\n\n5.\n\nEffective Planning\n\n35.\nBoth ADB and the Government have recognized the importance of urban planning as a\nbasic  requirement  of  a  cost-effective  infrastructure  development,  environmental  and  cultural\nsustainability, and equitable spatial organization of the city in which all income groups including\nthe poor can find living space of reasonable quality. ADB since 1995 provided assistance in the\npreparation  and  approval  of  the  master  plan  for  Vientiane.  There  is  need  at  this  stage  to\nimprove the effectiveness of the existing planning system and the master plan. The Government\nhas  agreed  to  a  number  of  interventions.  The  master  plan  will  be  amended  to  ensure  the\nprotection of ecologically fragile areas. VUDAA will adopt a program approach with a number of\nstrategic  and  action  plans  for  priority  areas  to  prevent  unplanned  development  and  to  protect\nthe cultural heritage of Vientiane. Existing zoning regulations will be reviewed and simplified to\nfacilitate development control at VUDAA level. Innovative land development techniques will be\ntested  to  establish  effective  instruments  for  planned  development.  The  Project  will  assist  the\nGovernment and VUDAA in undertaking the reforms, and VUDAA's capacity will be enhanced to\nenable it to perform planning and development control functions effectively.\n\n6. \n\nUrban Poverty Reduction\n\n36.\nThe  Government  is  committed  to  poverty  reduction  and  has  specific  targets  to  reduce\npoverty  in  Vientiane.  The  Project,  whose  design  was  guided  by  a  participatory  poverty\nassessment in Vientiane, has a strong focus on the needs of the poor, and incorporates a social\nstrategy to address poverty and associated social issues. ADB will pursue the development of\npro-poor  urban  management  skills  within  VUDAA  by  sensitizing  the  VUDAA  staff  to  urban\npoverty,  and  strengthening  VUDAA's  and  villages'  capacity  in  participatory  local  planning  and\ndevelopment. The poverty impact of the Project will be closely monitored. Coordination will also\nbe maintained with initiatives for poverty reduction at the Vientiane Prefecture level.\n\n\f7.\n\nCapacity Building\n\n12\n\n37.\nThe  Government  views  capacity  building  as  the  greatest  challenge  in  the  process  of\ndecentralization.  In  the  Seventh  RTM,  the  Government  acknowledged  that  decentralization\nrequires reallocation of human, material, and financial resources from central ministries to new\nurban  local  administrations  and  acceleration  of  capacity  building  and  training  programs  to\nenable  these  administrations  to  shoulder  their  new  responsibilities.  ADB  has  supported  the\nGovernment efforts to build institutional capacities within the newly formed decentralized urban\ngovernance.  With  a  greater  enabling  policy  framework  in  place,  VUDAA  needs  at  this  stage\nfurther  support  to  transform  itself  into  a  fully  competent  agency.  ADB  recognizes  the  need  to\ncontinue support to VUDAA with a long-term and comprehensive program of capacity building,\nand  sought  complementary  Government  actions  in  the  form  of  increased  staffing  and  other\nresources  of  VUDAA  to  ensure  that  the  capacity-building  support  will  produce  the  intended\noutcomes.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\n38.\nCurrent  deficiencies  in  basic  infrastructure  and  services  in  the  Vientiane  urban  area\ninhibit economic growth and undermine the quality of life of the urban residents and especially\nthe  poor.  Despite  recent  investments  in  primary  road  and  drainage  networks,  the  poor\nconditions of the secondary and tertiary infrastructure constrain the full potential of and benefits\nfrom recent improvements in primary infrastructure and services. In the absence of a complete\nstorm water drainage system, flooding continues to be a perennial problem affecting large parts\nof  the  urban  area.  Frequent  flooding  contributes  to  the  poor  state  of  roads.  Many  of  the\nsecondary  and  local  roads  remain  impassable  during  and  following  heavy  rainfall  thereby\ndisrupting the urban economy. The inadequate sanitation systems compound the environmental\nproblems.  Lack  of  basic  infrastructure  and  services  at  community  and  household  levels  has  a\nparticularly adverse impact on the lives of the poor who primarily live in low-lying marginal land\nsubject  to  flooding  for  most  of  the  year.  Inadequate  environmental  conditions  and  associated\npoor  health  and  low  productivity  are  the  major  characteristics  of  poverty  in  Vientiane  and  the\nmost overwhelming problem faced by the poor.\n\n39.\nSustained economic growth and the quality of life of the residents in the Vientiane urban\narea  are  further  constrained  by  the  still  evolving  urban  institutional  framework  and  nascent\nurban  management.  While  significant  progress  has  been  made  toward  decentralized  urban\ngovernance,  whereby  the  diverse  needs  of  an  urban  economy  and  a  population  can  be\naddressed  more  effectively,  the  tasks  ahead  to  make  VUDAA  a  fully  autonomous,  financially\nsustainable, and organizationally competent urban authority are considerable.\n\n40.\nFor  Vientiane  to  become  an  important  driver  of  the  national  economy  and  the  locus  of\nurban  poverty  reduction,  it  is  essential  that  the  quality  of  the  urban  environment  be  improved.\nDevelopment  of  the  primary  infrastructure  of  Vientiane  has  progressed  well,  but  is  still\nincomplete,  and  there  is  need  at  this  stage  to  shift  the  focus  of  efforts  to  secondary  and\ncommunity-level infrastructure and services to ensure that environmental improvements are felt\nby  all,  especially  the  poor.  Equally  important  is  smooth  progress  in  decentralization  and\naccomplishment  of  key  reforms  and  development  of  VUDAA  as  an  urban  entity  with  the\nnecessary operational and management systems, staff, and financial resources. The extent of\nreforms needed to fully achieve decentralized urban governance in the Lao PDR in general, and\nin  Vientiane  in  particular,  require  extensive  and  long-term  support  for  reforms  and  the\ncorresponding capacity building.\n\n\f13\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n41.\nThe  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  the  urban  residents,\nespecially  the  poor  and  the  disadvantaged,  and  to  enhance  urban  productivity  and  economic\ngrowth  in  the  Vientiane  urban  area.  To  this  end,  the  Project  has  two  specific  objectives:  (i)  to\nsupport decentralization and urban governance reforms and the process toward an autonomous,\nwell-functioning,  and  self-sufficient  urban  local  government  capable  of  planning,  managing,  and\nfinancing  urban  development  and  providing  services  in  a  sustainable  manner,  and  (ii)  to  target\ninvestments  in  infrastructure  and  services  to  maximize  the  utility  of  existing  infrastructure  by\ncompleting  missing  links  and  through  service  efficiency  improvements  and  focussing  on\nsecondary  and  tertiary-level  infrastructure  thus,  allowing  a  greater  share  of  the  population,\nespecially  the  poor,  to  benefit  from  environmental  improvements.  The  Project  represents  ADB\u2019s\nsecond  intervention  in  the  Vientiane  urban  area,  and  incorporates  lessons  learned  from  the\nexperience with VIUDP.\n\nThe project area covers a hundred villages within the jurisdiction of VUDAA. The project\n42.\ncomponents  follow:  (i)  part  A:  citywide  urban  infrastructure  and  services,  comprising  critical\nmissing  links  of  primary  and  secondary  roads  and  drainage,  efficiency  improvements  in  solid\nwaste  management,  traffic  management  and  road  safety,  and  maintenance  improvements;  (ii)\npart B: village area improvements (VAI), adopting a demand-led and participatory approach and\ncombining  community  infrastructure  and  services  with  community-level  capacity  building  and\nawareness  raising  in  environmental  health,  participatory  local  planning  and  community-based\ninfrastructure  development  and  service  delivery;  and  (iii)  part  C:  project  implementation  support\nand  a  comprehensive  capacity  building  program  to  support  the  accomplishment  of  the  urban\npolicy  and  institutional  reform  agenda,  and  enhance  planning,  O&M,  revenue  mobilization,  and\nfinancial management capabilities of VUDAA.\n\n1. \n\nCitywide Infrastructure and Environmental Improvements (Part A)\n\n43.\nCitywide  infrastructure  and  services  comprise  improvements  to  primary  and  secondary\nroad and drainage networks, traffic management and safety, solid waste management efficiency\nimprovements, and providing VUDAA with an office building and basic maintenance equipment.\nMajor  roads  and  drainage  improvements  in  part  A  were  selected  on  the  basis  of  the  criteria,\nincluding  (i)  completion  of  critical  missing  links  of  primary  and  secondary  roads  and  drainage\nimprovements that were appraised but not included in VIUDP for lack of funding, (ii) provision of\nimproved  secondary  access  and  associated  drainage  in  areas  of  high  population  density  with\ninadequate  infrastructure,  (iii)  improvements  to  the  road  network  and  associated  drainage\nsystem  in  the  central  business  district,  and  (iv)  introduction  of  trunk  infrastructure  in  new\ndevelopment areas to intensify development within the existing built up area.\n\n44.\nSubprojects  in  the  road  sector  seek  to  upgrade  (widen  and  seal)  existing  roads  and\nconstruct new ones. Of the 23 road subprojects, 12.7 km and 21 km are primary and secondary\nroads,  respectively,  to  be  improved  by  rehabilitating  damaged  roads  and  surfacing  previously\nunsurfaced  roads,  while  2.1  km  comprises  new  secondary  alignments.  Investments  in  road\nimprovements  will  be  supported  with  the  provision  of  essential  maintenance  equipment  and\ncapacity building in maintenance to enhance the sustainability of investments.\n\nThe  drainage  component  has  10  subprojects  that  will  improve  and  channelize  existing\n45.\nprimary and secondary drainage lines, and construct new sections to connect isolated stretches\nof drains into an integrated drainage network. A total length of 14 km of drainage channel will be\nimproved, of which 5.8 km is primary and 8.2 km is secondary. Improvements to drainage will\n\n\f14\n\nbe accompanied by the provision of essential maintenance equipment and capacity building in\nmaintenance.\n\n46.\nSolid  waste  management  improvements  at  the  city  level  are  targeted  to  expand\ncoverage  and  enhance  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  the  existing  system.  Citywide  solid\nwaste  management  interventions  include  providing  additional  equipment  to  enable  services  to\ncontinue in an area where services are under threat of being withdrawn due to old equipment.\nThe  interventions  also  include  enhancing  collection  efficiency  through  rationalizing  fleet  usage\nand  delegating  solid  waste  management  initiatives  to  villages,  and  introducing  administrative\nefficiencies  by  shifting  from  household  contracts  (now  15,000)  to  collective  village  contracts\n(189 maximum).\n\n47.\nThe traffic management and road safety component will address the problems of traffic\ngrowth,  poor  traffic  management,  and  deteriorating  road  safety  and  personal  security  for\npedestrians. It will support the road infrastructure component by maximizing road use efficiency\nand improving road safety. The component, as part of a broader strategy to be prepared early in\nproject implementation, will include installation of traffic signals, traffic signs and road marking;\nprovision of streetlights along 18 km of the 102 km of primary and secondary roads; and a road\nsafety awareness program.\n\nThe  institutional  infrastructure  component  will  include  construction  of  an  office  building\n48.\nfor  VUDAA  and  provision  of  basic  road  and  drainage  maintenance  equipment.  The  office\nbuilding  will  allow  VUDAA  to  establish  a  permanent  base  adequate  to  accommodate  the  staff\nnecessary  to  perform  its  mandate  and  also  reinforce  its  institutional  identity  and  profile.\nMaintenance equipment will help VUDAA carry out its routine and occasional periodic road and\ndrainage  maintenance  tasks  in  the  absence  of  imminent  private  sector  involvement  and\nappropriate capacities within VUDAA to manage and supervise privately delivered services. The\nequipment, to be supported by efforts to build the capacity of VUDAA in maintenance under the\ncapacity building component, will enable VUDAA to (i) carry out vital infrastructure maintenance,\n(ii) provide cost benchmark information for the eventual privatization of maintenance activities,\nand (iii) provide contingency facilities in case private contractors fail to perform.\n\n2. \n\nVillage Area Improvements (Part B)\n\n49.\nVillage area improvements (VAI) will comprise community infrastructure and services to\nbe supported by a community preparation and awareness program. VAI will follow a demand-\nled  approach  seeking  as  a  prerequisite  the  willingness  of  village  communities  to  participate  in\nand contribute financially or in kind to a portion of the cost of VAI. This approach, which is based\non  pilot  studies  in  two  villages,  will  better  reflect  the  diverse  community  needs  and  forge  a\ncommunity sense of ownership. The component will adopt a sector program modality. Villages\nwill be accepted into the program on the basis of the criteria that include (i) infrastructure and\nservice deficiencies, (ii) poor socioeconomic conditions and prevalence of poverty, (iii) extent of\ndemand, as expressed by villages' willingness to participate in and contribute to the project (iv)\ninclusion in WB/AusAID-supported land titling project, so that the investments are supported by\nclear land use rights, (v) proximity to trunk infrastructure from which villages can be served, and\n(vi)  revenue  collection  efficiency  in  accordance  with  the  new  policy  of  the  Government  on\ndecentralized  revenue  collection.  Fifty  villages  with  a  total  population  of  about  81,000  will  be\ncovered  under  the  program.  The  VAI  will  assign  a  major  role  to  villages,  and  rely  on  village\norganizations  and  communities  in  planning,  implementing,  and  O&M  of  infrastructure  and\nservices  to  be  provided  under  the  Project.  The  Project's  social  strategy  incorporates  specific\nmeasures for effective targeting of the poor and reinforcing the role of women in the process as\n\n\f15\n\nthe primary users of services. A participatory implementation framework for VAI is in Appendix\n4.\n\n50.\nThe community infrastructure and services will adopt an integrated approach to service\nprovision due to the interlinked nature of service deficiencies in villages. A package of services\ncombining surface drainage, tertiary access roads, primary solid waste collection, and sanitation\nimprovements will be determined for each participating village, based on its specific needs. The\nimprovements will have a range of options affordable for various low-income groups, especially\nthe poorest.\n\n51.\nThe  physical  interventions  of  VAI  will  be  supported  by  a  community  preparation  and\nawareness  program,  comprising  (i)  raising  awareness  in  public  health  and  environmental\nmanagement/sanitation  through  community-based  training  and  media-based  public  campaign;\nand  (ii)  building  the  capacity  of  villages,  communities,  and  VUDAA  for  community-based  local\nplanning, O&M, and monitoring and evaluation. Where needs exist, capacity building will include\norientation  for  microfinance  to  be  provided  under  UNCDF-supported  Microfinance  and\nSustainable  Livelihood  Project.  Training  will  target  the  poor  and  women  to  secure  their\nmeaningful participation in the program.\n\n3.\n\nCapacity Building and Project Implementation Support (Part C)\n\n52.\nThe  capacity  building  program  in  part  C  aims  to  help  achieve  one  of  the  two  key\nobjectives  of  the  Project  \u2013  to  support  the  Government's  policy  for  further  development  of\ndecentralized  urban  governance  and  accelerate  the  transformation  of  VUDAA  into  an\nautonomous, self-reliant, and capable agency to manage and finance urban development, and\ndeliver  urban  services.  The  scope  of  the  capacity  building  assistance  is  closely  linked  to  the\nurban policy and institutional reform agenda to be pursued in conjunction with the Project.\n\nThe  capacity  building  program  will  include  assistance  to  the  Government  in  the  further\n53.\ndevelopment of a clear and sound legal and institutional framework that would establish VUDAA\nas  a  fully  legitimate  level  of  administration  with  clear  linkages  with  Vientiane  Prefecture,  other\ntiers  of  administration,  particularly  districts  and  villages  and  other  key  ministries,  e.g.,  MCTPC\nand MOF. The supported legal and institutional framework will define VUDAA with clear powers\nand  responsibilities  in  generating  revenues  for  its  own  use,  levying  of  taxes  and  charges  and\nfees, and setting rates for various revenue items. VUDAA will be supported in its efforts to meet\nrevenue mobilization targets.\n\n54.\nThe capacity building program will also help in the further development of management\nand operational systems to allow VUDAA to undertake its mandated urban tasks effectively. The\nassistance  will  target  (i)  organizational  development  of  VUDAA,  (ii)  improved  financial\nmanagement,  (iii)  asset  management,  (iv)  further  development  of  operational  systems  to\nimprove the performance of VUDAA in service delivery and maintenance, (v) facilitating private\nsector participation in delivery of urban services especially O&M, (vi) enhancing urban planning\nand  development  control  capacities,  streamlining  planning  regulations,  and  pilot-testing  of\nguided  land  development;  and  (vii)  responsive  governance  through  improving  two-way\ncommunications  between  VUDAA  and  communities  and  utilizing  village  organizations  as  the\nfocal point of interaction with urban residents.\n\nFurther,  the  capacity  building  program  will  include  human  resource  development  to\n55.\nequip  the  VUDAA  workforce  with  the  necessary  skills  to  effectively  operate  the  systems  and\nprocesses established. Human resource development will involve appropriate modes of training\nin  various  areas  based  on  an  assessment  of  needs.\nactivities \n\nto  be  conducted \n\n\f16\n\n56.\nIn  addition  to  the  capacity  building  component,  part  C  includes  support  for  project\nimplementation  management.  This  covers  project  management  costs,  including  incremental\nadministration and operation associated with the project implementation and management unit\n(PIMU),  equipment,  logistics,  and  provision  for  all  surveys  and  investigations  to  support  the\ndetailed design process. Implementation support also covers the cost of 270 person-months of\nconsultancy inputs (76 international and 194 domestic).\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\nThe Project is estimated to cost $37.0 million equivalent (Table 1). The foreign exchange\n57.\ncost  is  estimated  at  $20.0  million,  or  about  54  percent  of  the  total  project  cost,  including  $0.6\nmillion  for  interest  during  construction.  The  local  currency  cost  is  $17.0  million  equivalent,  or\nabout  46  percent  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  cost  of  urban  services,  environmental\nimprovements,  and  community  infrastructure  components  covers  land,  civil  works,  equipment,\nand  materials.  Surveys,  detailed  design,  and  supervision  are  covered  in  the  implementation\nsupport component. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 5.\n\n58.\nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  in  the  amount  of  $25.0  million  from  its  Special\nFunds resources, which will represent 67 percent of the total cost of the Project. The ADB loan\nwill cover 82 percent of the foreign exchange cost and 50 percent of the local currency cost of\nthe Project, excluding taxes. The Borrower will be the Government of the Lao PDR. Proceeds\nfrom  the  ADB  loan  will  finance  the  full  costs  of  services  for  community  preparation  and\nawareness,  consulting  services  for  PIMU  support,  and  the  full  foreign  exchange  cost  and  50\npercent  of  the  local  currency  cost  (excluding  land  and  relocation)  for  the  road,  drainage,  solid\nwaste  management,  maintenance  equipment,  and  community  infrastructure  and  services.\nADB's  financing  for  the  local  currency  expenditure  is  justified  by  (i)  the  country's  limited\ndomestic resources as a result of the continuing effects of the 1997 Asian financial crisis as well\nas the lower-than-projected revenues; and (ii) the nature of the Project, which will improve the\neconomic efficiency of the Vientiane urban area, and enhance the living and health conditions of\nthe  population,  especially  the  poor.  These  will  be  achieved  by  upgrading  drainage  to  reduce\nlocalized  flooding,  upgrading  local  roads  to  improve  accessibility  and  reduce  negative\nenvironmental impacts, and mobilizing communities in the provision and maintenance of urban\ninfrastructure.\n\nComponent\n\nA.

The Government will finance the cost of land and relocation, part of\nthe cost of the office building for VUDAA, taxes and duties, the balance of the cost of civil works,\nand part of the incremental administration costs. A summary of the financing arrangements is in\nTable 2. The detailed financing plan is in Appendix 5.\n\nVUDAA  will  contribute  $2.9  million  equivalent  through  a  subloan  from  the  Government\n61.\nusing the ADB loan proceeds. The subloan will have an interest rate of 6.7 percent per annum\nand a repayment period of 15 years, following project completion, including a grace period of 3\nyears.  VUDAA's  financing  will  cover  100  percent  of  the  cost  of  maintenance  equipment  to\nensure  VUDAA's  recognition  of  the  full  cost  involved  in  maintenance,  and  investment  in  solid\nwaste  management  because  it  is  income  generating  and  is  to  achieve  full  cost  recovery.\nVUDAA's financing will also cover 10 percent of the cost of the urban infrastructure, except the\ntraffic  management  and  safety  component  to  be  financed  by  AFD,  and  VAI,  to  which  the\ncommunity will contribute 10 percent. VUDAA's 10 percent contribution for urban infrastructure\nand services was adopted considering VUDAA's status as a new entity and the challenges that\nit is facing to its financial position.\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nAsian Development Banka\nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement\nGovernment of the Lao PDR and Communityb\nTotal\na\n\nIncludes $2.9 million to be onlent to VUDAA.\nIncludes community contribution of 1 percent of the cost of VAI ($0.4 million).\n\nForeign\nExchange\n16.5\n3.5\n0.0\n20.0\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n8.5\n0.9\n7.6\n17.0\n\nTotal\nCost\n25.0\n4.4\n7.6\n37.0\n\nPercent\n\n67\n12\n21\n100\n\nSource\n\nb\n\nD.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nExecuting and Implementing Agencies\n\nThe  Executing  Agency  will  be  the  Vientiane  Prefecture  with  responsibility  for  strategic\n62.\nguidance,  supervision,  and  execution  of  the  Project.  A  project  steering  committee,  chaired  by\nthe  president  of  VUDAA  and  with  representatives  from  VUDAA,  MOF,  MCTPC,  Ministry  of\nJustice,  Committee  for  Planning  and  Cooperation,  and  Prime  Minister's  Office  (PMO)  has\nalready  been  formed  to  oversee  project  implementation  and  to  ensure  the  cooperation  of\nconcerned  agencies,  and  accomplishment  of  the  urban  policy  and  institutional  reform  agenda.\nVUDAA  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency,  responsible  for  planning  and  implementation  of\nimprovements  in  urban  infrastructure  and  services  (parts  A  and  B)  and  capacity  building  (part\nC). Villages will play a major role in planning, implementation, and O&M of the VAI component.\nThe project organization is shown in Appendix 6. The project implementation arrangements are\ndirected  to  (i)  effective  and  timely  implementation  of  the  Project,  (ii)  using  the  implementation\n\n\f18\n\nprocess as a means to strengthen VUDAA, and (iii) enhancing the role and capacity of village\nauthorities and communities in planning and delivery of basic services. Project implementation,\ntherefore,  will  be  as  far  as  practical  integrated  with  the  current  VUDAA  structure  and  ongoing\ntasks.\n\nA combined PIMU will be set up within VUDAA. PIMU consists of a project director from\n63.\nVUDAA  to  be  assisted  by  (i)  two  deputy  directors;  (ii)  the  leaders  of  the  teams  of  consultants\nwho  are  responsible  for  improvements  in  urban  infrastructure  and  services  and  capacity\nbuilding,  respectively,  and  who  act  as  general  advisers  to  the  project  director  and  deputy\ndirectors;  and  (iii)  an  accounting  and  administration  unit  to  manage  procurement  and  loan\naccount  administration.  One  deputy  director  will  be  responsible  for  management  and\nimplementation  of  urban  infrastructure  and  services,  and  the  other  will  oversee  and  guide  the\ncapacity  building  component.  The  project  director  and  the  two  deputy  directors  have  already\nbeen  appointed.  The  consulting  teams  will  work  under  the  overall  guidance  of  the  project\ndirector  and  deputy  directors,  coordinate  with  each  other,  and  work  closely  with  staff  in  the\ndivisions of VUDAA with the dual tasks of providing the key services required to implement the\nProject and strengthening those divisions in VUDAA.\n\n64.\nPIMU,  supported  by  the  consultants,  will  coordinate  and  manage  all  activities:\nprogramming,  budgeting  and  financial  planning,  detailed  engineering  design,  village  selection,\ncommunity preparation and awareness, subproject preparation and appraisal for VAI, tendering\nand  construction  supervision,  design  and  implementation  of  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation\nactivities, environmental assessment and protection, capacity building, and accomplishment of\nthe policy and institutional reform agenda and loan covenants.\n\n2.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n65.\nThe Project will be implemented over a period of five years (Appendix 7) with consulting\nservices  commencing  in  November  2001.  The  first  year  will  be  dedicated  to  preparation  for\nimplementation,  including  further  detailed  surveys,  developing  procedures,  and  completing\ndetailed  engineering  design  and  tender  documents.  For  the  VAI  component,  this  will  be  the\nperiod during which participatory processes with village organizations and communities will be\nimplementation  of\nestablished  as  a  way \nimprovements. Capacity building will continue throughout the project period. Project completion\nis scheduled for August 2006.\n\nto  detailed  prioritization  and  collaborative \n\n3.\n\nAdvance Action for Recruitment of Consultants\n\n66.\nTo  expedite  project  implementation,  ADB  approved  the  Government's  request  for\nadvance action in engagement of consultants. Selection is expected to advance up to the stage\nof  evaluation  of  the  technical  proposals.  The  Government  has  been  informed  that  approval  of\nadvance action does not in any way commit ADB to finance the relevant expenditures under the\nProject or the Project itself.\n\n4.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n67.\nConsulting  services  will  be  provided  by  foreign  and  domestic  consulting  firms.  The\nforeign  consulting  firms,  to  be  associated  with  domestic  consulting  firms,  will  be  engaged  for\nproject  implementation  management  support,  traffic  management  and  road  safety  programs,\nand capacity building. ADB will finance an estimated 270 person-months of consulting services\n(76 \nin  overall  project  management,\nimplementation,  detailed  engineering  design,  construction  supervision,  design  and\n\ninternational  and  194  domestic) \n\nto  assist  PIMU \n\n\f19\n\nimplementation of community-based and demand-led VAI, development of legal framework for\ndecentralized urban governance, and revenue mobilization within VUDAA. ADB will also finance\nservices by domestic consultants and other groups (e.g., nongovernment organizations [NGOs]\nand  academia)  who  will  assist  in  implementing  the  community  preparation  and  awareness\nprogram and independent monitoring and evaluation of VAI and implementation of resettlement\naction plan, and for supervision of construction works in part A. The consultants will be recruited\nin  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements  for\nengaging domestic consultants satisfactory to ADB. AFD will finance about 191 person-months\nof consulting inputs, including 173 person-months (65 international and 108 local) for capacity\nbuilding and 18 person-months (5 international and 13 local) for traffic management and safety\ncomponents.  Consultants  for  the  capacity  building  and  traffic  management  and  safety\ncomponents will be recruited through separate packages in accordance with AFD's procedures.\nThe project director will ensure coordination between the ADB and AFD consultant teams.\n\n5.\n\nProcurement\n\nGoods  and  works  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\n68.\nGuidelines for Procurement. International competitive bidding (ICB) procedures will be used for\nmajor civil works contracts estimated to cost $1.0 million or more and supply contracts valued at\n$500,000  or  higher.  For  civil  works  contracts  not  exceeding  $1.0  million,  local  competitive\n(LCB)  procedures  will  be  used.  The  Government\u2019s  procurement  guidelines\nbidding \n(Implementing  Rules  and  Regulations  on  Government  Procurement  of  Goods  Construction,\nRepairs  and  Services,  Dec  1998),  prepared  under  an  ADB  TA,  are  satisfactory.  Contract\ndocuments  for  LCB,  developed  under  the  Secondary  Towns  Urban  Development  Project,  can\nbe used, subject to ADB\u2019s review and approval. For supply contracts valued $500,000 or lower,\ninternational shopping procedures will be followed.\n\n69.\nFor  VAI,  most  works  will  be  labor-intensive  and  will  not  require  sophisticated\ntechnologies  and  equipment.  A  package  of  works  per  village  is  relatively  small,  ranging  from\n$30,000 to $100,000. It will, therefore, be appropriate to call for the participation in construction\nworks  of  the  local  communities,  resulting  in  a  sense  of  ownership  and  sustainability  of  the\nproject  assets.  Works  that  do  not  cost  more  than  $50,000  are  not  attractive  to  private\ncontractors,  and  where  the  capacity  of  the  community  to  undertake  the  works  is  adequate,\ncommunity  participation  in  procurement  will  be  applied.  Indicative  procurement  packaging  is\nshown in Appendix 8.\n\n6.\n\nDisbursement\n\n70.\nImmediately upon loan effectiveness, the Government will open and maintain a project\nimprest account for PIMU to ensure the timely release of loan proceeds and counterpart funds\nand expedite project implementation. The initial amount to be allocated to the imprest account is\n$500,000. Imprest funds will be basically used for small expenditures locally incurred, including\nincremental  project  administration  cost.  VUDAA  has  proven  adequate  internal  controls,\naccounting and auditing under VIUDP. The statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure may be\nused  for  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  for  the  Project  and  to  liquidate  advances\nprovided into the imprest account in accordance with the ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook,\nJanuary 2001, as amended from time to time, and detailed arrangements agreed upon by the\nBorrower  and  ADB.  Any  individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  SOE\nprocedure will not exceed $50,000.\n\n\f7.\n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement\n\n20\n\n71.\nThe Project's resettlement and land acquisition impacts are limited. Most of the proposed\nimprovements in part A are within the existing rights-of-way. Where new alignments and right-\nof-way  widening  are  proposed,  changing  of  alignments  and  engineering  designs  have\nminimized  the  acquisition  of  privately  owned  land  and  displacement  of  properties.  The  roads\nand  drainage  improvements  in  part  A  will  require  12.9  hectares  of  land  of  which  about  9\nhectares is privately owned. Only 89 households (500 persons) will be affected by full or partial\nloss of their land, houses, or outbuildings. Of the 89 households affected, 48 will have effects on\ntheir  houses  or  other  structures.  Eighteen  of  these  structures  are  temporary  shelters  made  of\nlight  materials  and  the  remaining  30  are  of  brick  or  wood.  Many  affected  structures  are\nouthouses rather than main dwellings. In most cases, householders will have to give up narrow\nstrips  of  unirrigated  paddy  land.  Of  the  48  households,  only  6  will  require  relocation  and\nresettlement of the households. These households will be accommodated in the same village if\npossible. Transactions on land use for affected households that have not yet been covered by\nthe  Land  Titling  Project  will  be  documented  properly.  The  affected  households  will  receive\nreplacement land or cash for land and immovable assets at replacement prices. Compensation\nwill also be provided for loss of business, livelihood, and shifting of structures or goods, etc. VAI\ncomponent will not require land acquisition. A summary resettlement action plan is attached as\nAppendix 9. A full resettlement action plan, prepared in accordance with policies and practices\nof the Lao PDR and ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, is a supplementary appendix.\n\n8.\n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\nVUDAA will be responsible for the maintenance of the facilities to be created under part\n72.\nA. VUDAA's current capacity in terms of equipment and technical skills requires strengthening.\nThe  Project  will  provide  VUDAA  with  maintenance  equipment.  The  provision  of  equipment  is\ncomplemented  by  capacity  building  under  part  C  which  emphasizes  strengthening  VUDAA's\nskills  in  O&M.  In  addition,  the  recently  adopted  cost  recovery  measures  and  their  projected\nprogressive  increase  over  the  next  five  years  are  expected  to  provide  greater  funds  for  O&M.\nFor  the  VAI  component,  village  communities  will  have  a  major  responsibility  for  periodic\nmaintenance  of  infrastructure.  To  the  extent  possible,  communities  will  also  be  delegated\nresponsibility  for  solid  waste  management  through  village  contracts.  To  ensure  that  O&M  is\nsuccessfully  managed  by  the  village  communities,  the  Project  provides  for  community\npreparation  and  awareness  in  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  the  project  components\nand capacity building of village communities in O&M.\n\n9.\n\nPublic-Private Partnership\n\n73.\nExperience in private sector participation in urban service delivery in Vientiane has been\nlimited,  confined  to  the  desludging  of  septic  tanks  and  solid  waste  management.  While  there\nappears  to  be  potential  for  private  sector  participation  in  various  stages  and  sets  of  urban\nservices (especially in O&M), a number of factors constrain outsourcing to the private sector in a\nfull  scale  in  the  near  future.  Experience  with  the  private  sector  involvement  in  the  solid  waste\nmanagement in Vientiane indicates that the level of fees and collection efficiency is insufficient\nto allow local entrepreneurs to achieve a satisfactory level of cost-recovery. In addition, VUDAA\nat  present  has  insufficient  technical  and  managerial  skills  to  undertake  and  supervise  service\ndelivery  by  private  contractors  on  a  large  scale.  Another  constraint  is  limited  private  sector\ncapacity.  Experience  with  private  sector  involvement  in  septic  tank  cleaning  reveals  the\ndetrimental effect of lack of a sound regulatory framework, with some private operators dumping\nseptage  improperly.  The  strategy  for  private  sector  participation  in  the  delivery  of  urban\nservices, therefore, requires a multipronged approach involving (i) a regulatory framework and\n\n\f21\n\nenforcement  capacity  that  will  protect  environmental  and  social  targets;  (ii)  technical  and\nmanagerial  skills  within  VUDAA  to  effectively  formulate  and  manage  private  operations;  (iii)\ntransparent  prequalification,  tendering,  and  contracting  processes;  and  (iv)  implementation  of\ncharges and fees at reasonable levels. It may be also necessary to assist the private sector in\ndeveloping its capabilities to take on management and operation of services. In the short term,\nthe  focus  will  be  on  contracting  periodic  maintenance  of  infrastructure,  followed  by  routine\nmaintenance  in  the  medium  term.  The  capacity  building  component  will  address  the  above\nissues in the gradual transfer of O&M activities to the private sector.\n\n10.\n\nMidterm Review\n\n74.\nADB  and  AFD,  together  with  the  Government  and  in  consultation  with  urban\ncommunities, will conduct a comprehensive midterm review between two and three years from\nloan effectiveness. The review will assess the progress by the Government and VUDAA on the\nurban  policy  and  institutional  reform  agenda,  as  agreed  upon  by  ADB  and  the  Government.  It\nwill  also  assess  the  performance  of  VUDAA  in  improving  its  capacity.  The  project  design  and\nimplementation  arrangements  will  be  examined.  The  performance  of  VUDAA  in  addressing\nurban  poverty  reduction  issues  and  in  achieving  progress  with  the  introduction  of  participatory\nprocesses  as  part  of  the  VAI  component  will  be  assessed.  The  review  will  also  examine\ncofinancing arrangements and progress in the project components under cofinancing. Also to be\nassessed  are  the  adequacy  of  and  adherence  to  procurement  arrangements,  including\ntransparency  of  selection  and  award  procedures.  Further,  the  performance  of  consultants  in\nproject management support and in maintaining quality standards will be reviewed. Based on all\nthese  assessments,  the  midterm  review  will  formulate,  within  the  updated  sector  setting  and\nother changing circumstances, the necessary courses of action for the Government and ADB to\nensure  successful  project  implementation  and  the  Project's  effectiveness  in  achieving  its\nobjectives.\n\n11.\n\nBenefit Monitoring and Implementation\n\n75.\nBenefit monitoring and evaluation (BME) will be undertaken for each project component\nto  ensure  that  project  facilities  are  managed  efficiently,  and  benefits  realized.  The  PIMU  will\ndevelop  a  comprehensive  BME  system  with  assistance  from  the  project  management\nconsultants.  The  BME  system  will  provide  a  mechanism  to  involve  beneficiary  community  in\nproject  performance  monitoring  system.  Impacts  to  be  measured  are  extent  of  community\nparticipation,  public  accountability,  transparency,  levels  of  provision  and  coverage  of  services\n(especially  for  the  poor,  women  and  minority  groups),  opportunities  created,  and  direct\nemployment generation. An independent monitoring and evaluation of VAI will be undertaken by\nan  external  agency  (NGO)  to  supplement  community  based  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The\nexternal  agency  will  also \nimplementation  of\nresettlement action pan. The PIMU is responsible for carrying out the BME activities, including\nthe establishment of benchmarks through initial baseline physical and socioeconomic surveys,\ndata  collection,  and  analysis.  The  PIMU  will  submit  a  detailed  implementation  plan  for\nmonitoring  benefits  and  preparing  benchmark  information  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and  concurrence\nwithin six months of loan effectiveness. Throughout project implementation, annual BME reports\nwill be submitted to ADB through the PIMU.\n\nindependently  monitor  and  evaluate \n\nthe \n\n12.\n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\n76.\nThe  Government  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project\nimplementation  prepared  by  PIMU.  The  reports  will  particularly  address  the  policy  and\ninstitutional reform aspects and capacity building for VUDAA and will be in such form and detail\n\n\f22\n\nas ADB requests. The report will include information on the physical progress of works and the\nstatus of related organizational and financial issues. The PIMU will also submit to ADB, within\nthree months of the Project's physical completion, a project completion report that will give the\ndetails of project implementation, cost, BME activities, and other relevant information.\n\nThe  project  director  will  establish  and  maintain  accounts  and  records  to  facilitate\n77.\nidentification of income and expenditure related to the Project. The director will be assisted by\nan adequate number of suitably qualified accounting staff, including a financial manager in the\nPIMU. All accounts and statements of expenditures and revenues related to the Project will be\naudited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB. VUDAA\u2019s annual financial statements together\nwith  audited  project  accounts  and  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  nine  months  of  the\nclose of the financial year.\n\nE.\n\nSocial and Environmental Measures\n\n78.\nThe Project has been prepared with extensive participation of stakeholders at all levels;\nbeneficiaries  especially  the  poor  men  and  women,  and  affected  people;  village,  district,  and\nPrefecture  representatives;  relevant  ministries;  the  private  sector;  and  NGOs  and  mass\norganizations and aid agencies. Further, a participatory poverty assessment, conducted under\nthe  project  preparatory  TA,  provided  a  thorough  understanding  of  the  nature  of  poverty,  and\ninfluenced the prioritization and evaluation of the project components as well as the processes\nto  adopt  during  implementation.  The  Project  will  address  the  priority  needs  of  the  poor,  both\ndirectly  and  indirectly.  The  Project  approach  in  addressing  social  and  poverty  issues  and\neffective  targeting  of  the  poor  and  the  disadvantaged  includes  (i)  maximizing  the  direct\nbeneficiaries of urban infrastructure and services by linking primary and secondary with tertiary\ninfrastructure;  (ii)  a  gradation  of  services  providing  a  range  of  options  affordable  to  various\nincome  groups,  especially  the  poor;  (iii)  prioritizing  villages  with  higher  levels  of  poverty  for\ninclusion  in  the  VAI  component;  (iv)  integrating  social  components  and  skills  with  physical\ncomponents and elements of the Project; and (v) assigning a major role to village organizations\nand  communities  in  planning  and  implementation  of  VAI,  and  enhancing  the  capacity  of\nstakeholders  at  all  levels  \u2013  VUDAA,  villages,  and  communities  \u2013  in  participatory  planning  and\nmanagement techniques.\n\n79.\nThe  VAI  component  will  incorporate  mechanisms  to  address  the  specific  needs  of  the\npoor and reinforce the role of women as primary users and managers of urban environmental\nservices.  The  mechanisms  include  (i)  stipulating  the  direct  participation  and  representation  of\nthe poor and women in village-based decision making; (ii) forming poor- and women-only focus\ngroups in participatory village appraisal of the subprojects and leadership training; (iii) targeting\nthe  poor  and  women  in  sanitation  and  solid-waste  management  subcomponents  and\nenvironmental and health awareness; (iv) safeguarding against forced eviction through a village\nmonitoring  and  grievance  mechanism;  (v)  giving  priority  to  the  poor  in  hired  laborers  in\nconstruction activities; (vi) where necessary, linking the training of women to land rights in the\nLand  Titling  Project;  (vii)  where  needed,  orientation  of  the  poor  and  women  for  microfinance\nunder the UNCDF-supported Microfinance and Sustainable Livelihood Project; (viii) training key\nVUDAA staff and village authorities in pro-poor management and gender awareness; and (ix) a\ncommunity-based participatory monitoring, using simple indicators identified by the community,\nand  a  complementary  independent  impact  monitoring  to  be  undertaken  by  a  suitably  skilled\nNGO. The existing structure of the Lao Women's Union (LWU) in villages will also be used to\nachieve  the  social  strategy.  The  Project  will  provide  inputs  required  to  successfully  implement\nthe  social  strategy  and  the  resettlement  action  plan  by  recruiting  community  development\nspecialists,  a  gender  specialist,  and  a  resettlement  expert.  The  poverty  and  social  issues  and\nthe strategy are described fully in Appendix 10.\n\n\f23\n\nThe initial screening of potential environmental impacts indicates that the Project will not\n80.\naffect  environmentally  sensitive  areas,  nor  will  it  cause  large-scale  changes  in  the  physical,\nbiological, or social environment. Further, the proposed physical works are limited in scope, and\nconcern mainly the improvement of existing facilities, drainage channels, and roads. Indeed, the\nmajority of the project components will bring clear environmental benefits. Anticipated adverse\nimpacts  during  construction  are  not  significant  where  (i)  long-term  benefits  to  society  exceed\nshort-term costs, and (ii) appropriate mitigation measures are applied. The Project is classified\nin environmental category B, and a summary initial environmental examination is presented in\nAppendix 11.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nThe  proposed  Project  will  benefit  about  162,000  residents  of  the  Vientiane  urban  area\n81.\nthrough  improved  urban  environment  and  living  conditions  resulting  from  upgraded  roads  and\ndrainage,  improved  traffic  management  and  road  safety,  wider  coverage  of  solid  waste\ncollection,  and  improved  sanitation  conditions.  The  economy  will  benefit  from  increased  urban\nefficiency as the project interventions will mitigate disruptions to urban economy caused by poor\nroad  and  traffic  conditions,  constant  flooding  and  damage  to  urban  assets,  and  inadequate\nurban services. Urban poverty will be reduced by providing basic infrastructure and services for\nthe  poor  and  a  social  strategy  with  inclusive  processes  incorporated  into  the  Project.  The\nProject will directly improve the living conditions of 81,000 urban residents through village area\nimprovements, a partially coincident 60,000 people through drainage improvements, and about\n16,000  people  through  improved  solid  waste  collection  and  disposal.  The  general  population\nand the economy will gain because the increased capacity of VUDAA will result in sustainable\nimprovements to the urban environment and effective delivery of services. The Project's support\nfor decentralized urban governance and participatory management and empowerment of village\ncommunities  in  local  planning  and  service  delivery  will  lead  to  responsive  urban  governance\nwith a greater concern for the needs of the urban poor.\n\n82.\nMore  specifically,  the  Project  will  contribute  to  (i)  reduced  damage,  disruption,  and\ndetrimental  health  impacts  from  localized  flooding;  (ii)  reduced  dust  from  traffic  on  local  roads\nand lower vehicle operating costs on local, secondary, and primary roads; (iii) reduced deaths\nand  injury  from  road  accidents;  (iv)  improved  environmental  and  health  outcomes  from  solid\nwaste  collection  and  disposal,  and  sanitation  improvements;  (v)  increased  community\nawareness  of  environmental  health,  and  enhanced  village  capacities  in  local  planning,\nimplementation and O&M of local infrastructure, with focus on the urban poor; and (vi) improved\nplanning,  development  control,  environmental  and  cultural  sustainability,  and  sustainable\nservice delivery through enhanced capacity of VUDAA in urban management and local resource\nmobilization.\n\nA.\n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses\n\n83.\nEconomic  and  financial  analyses  of  the  proposed  subprojects  were  prepared  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Framework  for  the  Economic  and  Financial  Appraisal  of  Urban\nDevelopment Sector Projects.  The  results  are  in  Appendix  12.  The  overall  economic  internal\nrates  of  return  (EIRR)  for  seven  typical  road  subprojects,  which  account  for  41  percent  of  the\ntotal  cost  of  the  roads  component,  is  24.2  percent.  The  EIRR  for  the  individual  subprojects\nrange from 12.4 to 41.4 percent, with the lowest EIRR occurring for a subproject to construct a\nnew section of road for which the benefits to the network as a whole are not fully reflected in the\nevaluation. The roads component is robust, and will remain viable even with a 105 percent rise\nin costs or a 51 percent decline in benefits.\n\n\f24\n\nThe  overall  EIRR  for  the  storm  water  drainage  component  is  11.9  percent  based  on\n84.\nsavings in damage to private buildings and property. Additional unquantified benefits include (i)\nreduced damage to motor vehicles and public infrastructure such as roads; (ii) reduced loss of\npersonal income when employment is disrupted; (iii) improved conditions with avoided flooding\nof sanitary systems and spread of raw and partially treated sewage and sullage with rainwater\ninto residential areas; and (iv) reduced disruption to personal and community life caused by the\nslow dispersal of storm water. These benefits will ensure that the overall economic benefit of the\ncomponent is higher than that indicated by the economic evaluation. The drainage subprojects\nwill  be  especially  beneficial  to  the  poor,  who  are  more  likely  to  live  in  lower-lying  land  that  is\nmore subject to flooding.\n\n85.\nThe financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the solid waste component is 13.4 percent\nbased on incremental costs and revenue, and using recently approved user fees, which rise by\n3 percent per annum in real terms (similar to growth in real income). The security of the benefits\nis  high,  as  the  Project  will  enable  services  to  continue  in  an  existing  area  where  services  will\notherwise be withdrawn due to inadequate equipment. Based on the average quantity of waste,\nuser fees are equal to 3.3 percent of the 25th percentile household income and 1.4 percent of\naverage household income. However, the burden on low-income households is reduced as they\ngenerate less waste and find more economical means for disposing of waste to reduce costs.\nThere remains pressure on the urban poor to avoid the cost of solid waste disposal by burning\nand dumping rubbish, with negative environmental consequences. The community preparation\nand awareness to be undertaken under VAI, and increasing the use of village-based solid waste\ncollection  contracts,  will  assist  communities  to  implement  measures  to  avoid  such  ways  of\ndisposal.\n\n86.\nThe  sensitivity  of  the  solid  waste  management  component  FIRR  to  adverse  changes\nwas  tested.  The  key  variables  include  (i)  increases  in  capital  and  O&M  costs,  (ii)  decrease  in\nrevenues, (iii) a combination of decreased revenue and increased cost, and (iv) one-year delay\nin project completion. The FIRR is most sensitive to reduced revenues. Revenues may be lower\nthan that forecast because of failure to increase rates to the proposed levels (Appendix 12).\n\nVAI  will  (i)  reduce  flooding,  and  hence  reduce  property  and  livelihood  damage,  loss  of\n87.\nincome, and spread of sewage and sullage with implications for improved health, wellbeing, and\nquality of life; (ii) improve sanitation and collection of solid waste with resulting benefits to public\nhealth  and  the  local  environment;  (iii)  improve  the  accessibility  of  transport  and  access  of\npeople, especially the poor, to vital urban facilities; (iv) reduce dust by developing tertiary roads\nand sealing local roads; (v) create synergies of and maximize benefits from improvements to a\nrange of community infrastructure and services, which are inextricably linked; and (vi) increase\ncommunity  awareness  of  health  and  environment  linkages  and  participation  in  local  planning\nand project implementation and O&M. The component has a particular focus on involving low-\nincome  households  and  meeting  their  needs.  The  average  cost  of  VAI  is  $52  per  capita,  and\ncommunities  will  meet  10  percent  of  the  cost  of  physical  works  from  cash  and  in-kind\ncontributions,  with  the  financial  cost  of  the  community\u2019s  contribution  to  the  component  being\nequal  to  0.4  percent  of  the  average  household  income  over  the  course  of  a  year.  Community\nleaders will levy the contribution on local businesses and households according to their financial\ncapacity,  to  reduce  the  financial  cost  to  low-income  households.  The  emphasis  on  community\nparticipation and social equity will ensure that the improvements meet locally prioritized needs in\nthe most effective manner.\n\n88.\nStreet lighting is a public good with substantial benefits for the community, including (i) a\ndecline in the number and severity of road vehicle accidents at night, especially those involving\n\n\f25\n\npedestrians;  (ii)  reduced  travel  time  and  vehicle  operating  costs  for  motorists;  (iii)  fewer\naccidents, greater convenience and enhanced personal security for pedestrians using footpaths;\nand (iv) increased opportunity for social and business activity. The benefits of street lighting and\nits  current  limited  presence  mean  that  the  marginal  benefit  to  be  gained  from  its  provision  is\ngreater  than  would  be  if  street  lighting  were  more  extensive  at  present.  The  benefit  from  the\nstreet  lighting  program  will  be  maximized  by  prioritizing  the  locations  where  lights  are  to  be\ninstalled during project implementation, using a multicriteria assessment that takes into account\nthe volume of traffic, number of traffic accidents, and quality of footpaths.\n\nInstallation  of  traffic  signals,  improved  road  signage,  better  traffic  enforcement,  and\n89.\ntraffic  safety  education  respond  to  traffic  growth,  poor  traffic  management,  and  deteriorating\nroad safety in Vientiane. The number of fatalities and injuries is rising at more than double the\nrate  of  growth  in  the  number  of  vehicles  over  the  last  decade,  and  is  higher  than  in  countries\nsuch  as  Thailand  and  Indonesia.  The  benefits  from  the  traffic  management  and  safety\ncomponent will include (i) fewer and less severe road accidents, (ii) reduced vehicle operating\ncosts  resulting  from  improved  traffic  flow,  and  (iii)  increased  effective  capacity  of  the  road\nsystem. Traffic accidents in Vientiane are concentrated in certain areas (33 of the 106 deaths in\n1999  occurred  at  13  intersections),  and  so  should  respond  to  a  focused  traffic  management\nstrategy.  Benefits  from  the  traffic  management  strategy  will  be  maximized  by  prioritizing  the\nlocation of measures to be implemented on the basis of the volume of traffic and the number of\ntraffic accidents.\n\n90.\nBoth  VUDAA  and  the  private  sector  have  currently  limited  technical  capacity  and\nexperience  in  contracting  routine  maintenance  of  public  infrastructure.  The  provision  of  basic\nmaintenance  equipment  for  VUDAA  is  justified  by  the  need  to  develop  VUDAA\u2019s  technical\ncapacity for maintenance and to provide benchmark costs for maintenance activities, which will\nform  the  basis  for  subsequent  contracting  out  of  such  services  to  the  private  sector.  The\ncapacity building component of the Project will develop and implement a strategy for the gradual\ntransfer of maintenance activities to the private sector.\n\n1.\n\nFinancial Projections for VUDAA\n\nVUDMC was replaced by VUDAA in February 1999 with the power to collect solid waste\n91.\nand  sanitation  charges,  and  building  permit  and  parking  fees.  Solid  waste  and  sanitation\nservices  have  been  operated  as  a  separate  enterprise  but  at  a  loss,  and  revenue  from  other\nfees has been modest. However, Decision 1804 issued by the governor of Vientiane Prefecture\nin  December  2000,  provides  VUDAA  with  significant  revenue-raising  powers.  The  decision\nauthorized  VUDAA  to  collect  (i)  fees  for  building  permits  and  signboards,  and  lease  of  public\nplaces;  (ii)  user  charges,  including  solid  waste  collection,  sanitation  services,  parking  fees,  a\nsurcharge on the water bill for drainage maintenance, and a surcharge on the electricity bill to\npay  for  public  lighting  maintenance;  and  (iii)  urban  obligation  fees,  including  an  annual  tax\nrelated to the value of buildings, a surcharge on gasoline and diesel, business taxes including a\ncharge on hotels and guesthouses, and a charge for households that do not avail themselves of\nsolid waste collection services. The decision specified the level of charges, and set higher rates\nfor revenue from sources already available to VUDAA. The governor's decision was confirmed\nwith a PM's Decision on 26 April 2001 to ensure that the income, to be generated through water\nand electricity surcharges, will be made available to VUDAA. VUDAA has started to implement\nthese new charges. There is need to establish procedures to efficiently and effectively assess,\nimpose, and collect the income, and to gain community acceptance of the charges.\n\n92.\nDecision  1804  provides  a  sound  basis  for  future  resource  mobilization  by  VUDAA\nthrough  a  limited  number  of  income  sources  with  generally  low  administration  costs  and  the\n\n\f26\n\npotential to generate substantial revenue. The capacity building component will enable VUDAA\nto  levy  and  collect  the  revenue  and  undertake  a  continuing  review  of  the  charges.  Full  and\neffective  application  of  the  new  charges  will  require  political  and  community  support,  and\nsupport from Vientiane Prefecture and the Government. The decision allows the solid waste and\nsanitation service to be undertaken on a full cost recovery basis and other revenue of VUDAA to\nrise from the present KN150 million per year to, in constant prices, KN3 billion in 2004 and KN5\nbillion in 2006, given the improvements in coverage, collection efficiency, and ongoing real rises\nin the level of charges.\n\nFinancial projections for VUDAA are based on (i) expected income from current sources\n93.\nand from new sources recently granted to VUDAA, allowing for a gradual rise in coverage and\ncollection efficiency, and the real level of fees to rise by 10 percent per annum up to 2006; (ii)\nincome  for  solid  waste  management  and  sanitation  services  to  rise  by  3  percent  per  annum\nfrom recently approved fees to fully recover the cost of providing solid waste management and\nsanitation; (iii) an average 8 percent per annum real rise in expenditure to allow VUDAA to fulfill\nits functions, including O&M for existing infrastructure and for infrastructure to be provided under\nthe Project; (iv) VUDAA financing an average of 8.6 percent of the cost of the Project through\nsubloans, with the subloans having an interest rate of 6.7 percent, based on the interest rate on\nthe  loan,  forecast  exchange  risk,  and  management  costs  and  repayment  period  of  15  years\nincluding  a  3-year  grace  period;  and  (v)  Vientiane  Prefecture  and  the  Government  meeting\nfinancing gaps.\n\n94.\nThe  financial  forecasts  for  VUDAA  indicate  that  there  is  potential  \u2013  with  sufficient\npolitical,  institutional,  and  community  support  and  development  of  VUDAA\u2019s  capacity  \u2013  to\ngenerate  adequate  resources  from  the  revenue  base  provided  to  VUDAA  to  meet  its  future\nobligations for service provision. More specifically, the forecasts indicate that (i) VUDAA will be\nable  to  meet  at  least  50  percent  of  the  direct  cost  incurred  in  providing  services  and  in\nundertaking adequate O&M by 2003, and 100 percent by 2006, (ii) improvements in coverage\nand  efficiency  of  solid  waste  operations  will  enable  future  investments  in  assets  for  replacing\nand upgrading, to be financed from its own resources; (iii) debt coverage is very high, reflecting\nthe small level of debt relative to the substantial revenue base; and (iv) VUDAA will continue to\nneed  some  financial  support  from  the  Vientiane  Prefecture  and  the  Government.  VUDAA  is  a\nrelatively  new  organization  that  was  only  recently  provided  with  a  substantial  revenue  base.\nWhile  it  has  begun  to  implement  its  new  revenue  generating  powers,  VUDAA  still  has  the\nconsiderable  task  of  fully  implementing  Decision  1804  and  achieving  continuing  rises  in  real\nincome,  adequate  O&M  of  assets,  and  effective  management  of  its  income  and  expenditure.\nTapping the revenue sources, provided to VUDAA in Decision 1804, forms the major element of\nthe  urban  policy  and  institutional  reform  agenda  linked  to  the  Project  and  the  associated  loan\ncovenants.  The  capacity  building  component  will  support  VUDAA  in  implementing  resource\nmobilization reforms and reduce the institutional risk to the financial forecasts.\n\n2.\n\nCost Recovery, Subsidies, and Sustainability\n\n95.\nA  national  expenditure  and  consumption  survey  in  1997  and  early  1998  indicated  that\n16.7  percent  of  the  urban  population  in  Vientiane  is  below  the  poverty  line,  based  on  the\nequivalent  income  needed  to  purchase  2,100  calories  per  person  per  day  plus  some\nexpenditure for nonfood items. Expressing this amount in current prices is susceptible to error,\ngiven  the  rapid  subsequent  inflation,  e.g.,  142  percent  in  1998  and  108  percent  in  1999.  The\npresent  poverty  line  is  estimated  to  be  between  about  KN150,000-190,000  per  household  per\nmonth,  with  the  25th  percentile  monthly  household  income  at  about  KN310,000  ($38)  and\naverage monthly household income about KN730,000 ($89). Households at the lower end of the\nrange  typically  spend  about  55  percent  of  their  income  on  food;  10  percent  on  utility  services\n\n\f27\n\n(water, solid waste collection, and electricity); 20 percent on rent, health, and education; and 15\npercent on other items.\n\n96.\nInvestments under the Project and revenue generation by VUDAA will require imposition\nof  additional  and  higher  user  charges  and  taxes  on  the  public.  These  include  lump  sum\nsurcharges  on  water  and  electricity,  higher  fees  for  solid  waste  collection  and  disposal,  and  a\nproposed community contribution to the cost of VAI. The burden of these charges on the poor is\nmitigated  by  present  community  practices  such  as  willingness  of  community  leaders  to  take\naccount of the ability to pay when imposing charges, with in-kind contributions to be accepted\nunder VAI. The community contribution to VAI is estimated at 0.5 percent of the 25th percentile\nhousehold  income  and  0.2  percent  of  households  at  the  poverty  line  over  the  duration  of  the\nsubproject after allowing for greater contribution of labor by lower income households. The cost\nof the additional utility charges will, in aggregate, be equal to an average of about 1.7 percent of\nthe  25th  percentile  household  income  and  1.4  percent  for  households  at  the  poverty  line.  The\nlower  share  for  households  on  the  poverty  line  is  due  to  lower  consumption.  The  charges  are\nacceptable, provided that the structure of the charges is reviewed to minimize the impact on the\npoor by using progressive rates. The capacity building component will address this matter.\n\n97.\nSolid  waste  collection  and  disposal  is  the  only  project  component  that  has  a  direct\nmeans for cost recovery, and has the potential to achieve full cost recovery during the project\nimplementation  period.  This  will  ensure  that  the  service  is  sustainable,  does  not  compete\nunfairly with potential competitive private sector services, and could be privatized or contracted\nout at some future date.\n\nThe  provision  of  90  percent  of  the  cost  of  the  projects  as  a  grant  to  beneficiaries  is\n98.\njustified by (i) the public good features and positive externalities of the project components, (ii)\nthe  potential  for  an  improved  urban  environment  and  more  efficient  urban  system  to  indirectly\ngenerate additional revenue for VUDAA and the Government, and (iii) the objective of improving\nconditions  for  the  poor  whose  income  is  severely  limited.  VUDAA  will  need  financial  support\nfrom the Government and Vientiane Prefecture to implement the Project and to contribute to its\ngeneral  administration  costs.  This  support  is  justified  by  the  early  stage  of  development  of  an\nurban  administration  authority  in  the  Lao  PDR  and  the  greater  revenue-raising  power  of  the\nGovernment,  and  is  complemented  by  a  substantial  capacity  building  program  for  revenue\nenhancement and improved O&M for VUDAA to establish the basis for a self-financing authority\nin the longer term.\n\nProject  sustainability  will  be  facilitated  by  (i)  community  involvement  in  identification,\n99.\nimplementation,  and  O&M  of  VAI,  and  greater  involvement  of  and  consultation  with  the\ncommunity regarding other infrastructure development; (ii) resource mobilization by VUDAA to\nprovide  funding  for  O&M  of  infrastructure  and  services,  and  for  replacement  of  current  assets\nused for solid waste collection and disposal; (iii) the provision of basic maintenance equipment\nto  VUDAA;  and  (iv)  the  capacity  building  component  that  will  develop  and  implement  a\nmaintenance strategy, including that for privatized maintenance.\n\nB. \n\nEnvironment and Social Dimensions\n\n100.\nThe initial environmental examination indicates that the impacts of the Project will (i) not\ninvolve the accelerated use of scarce resources and will in the long term contribute to their more\nefficient use by improving the efficiency of the urban system, (ii) have a neutral impact on the\necology of the impact area, (iii) have a significantly positive impact on the physical environment,\nand  (iv)  have  a  beneficial  effect  on  the  physical  and  socioeconomic  well-being  of  the  urban\npopulation through enhancement of the physical environment. Negative environmental impacts\n\n\f28\n\nsuch as removal of a limited number of trees, dust, water contamination, and disruptions during\nconstruction  can  be  minimized  with  remedial  measures  such  as  revegetation,  training,\nconstruction planning, and community consultation, for which allowance has been made in the\ncost of the Project. The long-term environmental benefits of the Project depend on proper O&M\nof  the  completed  investments.  Therefore,  the  Project  has  provided  for  the  purchase  of  basic\nmaintenance  equipment,  measures  for  community  involvement,  and  building  the  capacity  of\nVUDAA for maintenance.\n\n101.\nThe  Project  will  improve  the  living  conditions  of  the  urban  residents,  the  local\nenvironment, and the infrastructure and services needed by households and businesses in the\nVientiane  urban  area.  Beneficiaries  include  (i)  direct  beneficiaries  of  improvements,  including\npeople who (a) use new and upgraded infrastructure and services such as improved roads and\nsolid  waste  services;  (b)  benefit  from  the  improved  infrastructure  and  services  that  result  in\nreduced  flooding,  less  dust  from  unsealed  roads,  and  the  avoided  cost  and  trauma  of  traffic\naccidents;  and  (c)  benefit  from  empowerment  and  involvement  through  the  community\npreparation  and  awareness  program;  and  (ii)  indirect  beneficiaries  who  gain  from  (a)  an\nimproved quality of life resulting from the improved urban environment, (b) the economic growth\nthat  will  be  fostered  by  improvements  in  infrastructure  and  services,  and  (c)  sustained  and\nequitable  improvements  to  the  urban  living  conditions  resulting  from  project  interventions  for\neffective  and  responsive  urban  governance.  The  involvement  of  the  communities  in  project\nimplementation  will  complement  and  reinforce  the  immediate  economic  and  health  benefits\nassociated  with  the  local  road,  drainage,  sanitation,  solid  waste  management,  and  traffic\nmanagement components by ensuring sustainability and a sense of ownership.\n\n102. About 18 percent of the population of the Vientiane urban area, or 30,000 people can be\ndefined  as  very  poor  on  the  basis  of  their  limited  income.  These  people  incur  a  multiplicity  of\nproblems  such  as  inability  to  afford  three  meals  per  day,  limited  intake  of  protein,  children\ngenerally  leaving  school  after  reaching  12  years  of  age,  and  most  importantly,  the\nconsequences of living in low-lying areas that are acutely underserved, and subject to flooding\nand  consequent  environmental  and  health  problems.  The  VAI  component  will  directly  benefit\napproximately  15,000  poor  people  while  30,000  poor  will  benefit  indirectly  from  citywide\nimprovements. The Project will provide a range of infrastructure and services (i) that the poor,\nthrough a participatory poverty assessment, unanimously indicated as the highest priorities; in\nparticular  poor  drainage  and  access  that  has  imposed  limitations  on  their  livelihoods,  health,\nand  the  quality  of  life,  (ii)  that  will  improve  inadequate  solid  waste  collection  systems  and\nsanitation  that  are  grossly  inadequate  in  areas  where  the  poor  live,  and  (iii)  that  will  offer  a\nrange  of  service  levels  affordable  to  various  low-income  groups.  The  community  preparation\nand awareness program under VAI will maximize the benefits from physical improvements by (i)\nfurthering  the  concern  of  community  leaders  for  the  needs  of  the  poor  and  improving  their\ncommunities; (ii) promoting understanding of the importance of environmental health among the\npoor and women, and stimulating the demand for environmental improvements; and (iii) building\nthe capacity of village communities in participatory processes, which will ensure that the needs\nof  the  poor  and  vulnerable  are  addressed  and  potential  adverse  effects  are  mitigated.  The\ncommunity preparation and awareness program will also allow concerns about project impacts\nto  be  addressed  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  improvements,  including  mechanisms  to\nensure that the concern and interests of women are taken into account.\n\n103.\nThe Project's design minimized the acquisition of land and relocation and resettlement of\nhouseholds. 89 households will be affected by full or partial loss of their property most of which\nare  outhouses  rather  than  main  dwellings.  Only  6  households  will  be  relocated.  The  affected\nhouseholds will receive replacement land or cash for loss of land and immovable assets, and be\nalso compensated for loss of business and livelihood. No encroachers or squatters were found\n\n\f29\n\nin the affected areas, and most of  the affected people are relatively well off. The resettlement\naction  plan,  prepared  in  accordance  with  policies  and  practices  of  the  Lao  PDR  and  ADB's\nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement, provides a clear compensation framework, cost estimates,\nimplementation arrangements, and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.\n\nC. \n\nProject Risks\n\n104. Potential risks associated with the Project include (i) legal inconsistencies relating to the\nstructure of urban governance and a level of uncertainty resulting from the use of decrees as a\nmeans for implementing reforms in the urban sector, (ii) inadequate rates for user charges and\nfees and poor cost recovery and limited capacity of VUDAA to undertake its assigned functions\nand implement new revenue raising powers, (iii) lack of experience on the acceptability of urban\nfees and charges and perceived low willingness of community to pay for urban services, and (iv)\ninadequate experience and capacity of VUDAA and village communities in participatory project\nplanning and implementation.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, the Project has devised a strategy, reflected in the urban policy\n105.\nand  institutional  reform  agenda  and  the  corresponding  project  assistance  under  the  capacity\nbuilding component. The Project will support the Government's ongoing efforts for legal reforms.\nThe  limitations  relating  to  cost  recovery  and  local  revenues  and  technical  capacity  of  VUDAA\nconstitute  an  important  element  of  the  reform  agenda  and  the  focus  of  project  assistance\nthrough the capacity building component. The risk relating to the limited experience of VUDAA\nand village communities in participatory project implementation will be mitigated by an extensive\ncommunity  preparation  and  awareness  program  that  seeks  building  the  capacities  of  the\ncommunities  and  VUDAA  in  community-based  decision  making  and  implementation  of  urban\ninfrastructure  and  services.

4, page 1\n\nA PARTICIPATORY IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK\nFOR VILLAGE AREA IMPROVEMENTS\n\nA. \n\nBackground\n\nThis  Appendix  is  a  summary  of  the  implementation  framework  for  the  village  area\n1.\nimprovements (VAI) component under the part B. VAI is designed to (i) extend to the community\nbenefits  from  primary  infrastructure  by  linking  it  to  secondary-  and  tertiary-level  infrastructure;\n(ii)  apply  a  demand-led  approach  based  on  community  participation  and  contribution  to  better\nreflect  diverse  community  needs  and  forge  a  sense  of  community  ownership;  (iii)  combine  a\nsocial component i.e., community preparation and awareness raising with physical infrastructure\nand  service  improvements  to  create  a  demand  for  improvements,  better  target  the  poor,  elicit\ncommunity  support  for  resource  mobilization,  and  ensure  sustainable  urban  infrastructure\nmanagement, and (iv) contribute to the institutionalization of participatory and responsive urban\nmanagement within VUDAA.\n\n2.\nVAI comprises (i) community infrastructure and services and (ii) community preparation\nand  awareness  program.  Community  infrastructure  and  services  include  (i)  tertiary  access\nroads  and  footpaths,  (ii)  surface  water  drainage,  (iii)  sanitation\u2014improvements  of  on-plot\nfacilities, and (iv) solid waste management\u2014community-based collection and concentration and\nother minor works to be identified based on the participatory selection process. The community\npreparation  and  awareness  program  includes  (i)  awareness  raising  on  public  health  and\nenvironmental management and sanitation through community-based training and media-based\npublicity  campaign,  and  (ii)  building  the  capacity  of  VUDAA,  villages,  and  communities  in\ninfrastructure  and  service  delivery,  community-based\ncommunity-based \ncontracting  (where  necessary),  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and  monitoring  and\nevaluation.  Capacity  building  activities  also  cover  leadership  training  for  women  and  the  poor\nand,  where  needs  exist,  orientation  for  microfinance  that  will  be  available  under  the\nMicrofinance  and  Sustainable  Livelihood  Project  supported  by  the  United  Nations  Capital\nDevelopment Fund (UNCDF).\n\nlocal  planning, \n\nB.\n\nProgram Approach\n\n3.\nVAI adopts a demand-led, sector program approach, taking the village as the unit for the\ncommunity/tertiary-level  infrastructure  improvements.  The  VAI  process  incorporates  (i)  a  high\nlevel of community involvement in decision making, and (ii) a community contribution to ensure\nthat  improvements  match  community  requirements  and  benefit  from  community  commitment.\nStarting with two pilot villages, the program will be built up to cover up to 12 new villages a year.\nThree  additional  villages  are  anticipated  to  be  admitted  to  form  the  first  year\u2019s  program;\nthereafter,  villages  will  compete  for  places  in  each  subsequent  year\u2019s  annual  program.  Most\nvillages are expected to apply for inclusion, and about 50 of VUDAA\u2019s 100 villages are likely to\nbenefit from the program.\n\nC.\n\nGeneral Principles\n\n4.\nAlthough  VAI  adopts  a  demand-led  approach,  the  villages  applying  for  inclusion  in  the\nVAI program will have to accept and adhere to three general guiding principles: (i) community\nparticipation  and  joint  decision  making,  especially  by  the  poor  and  women,  in  planning,\ncomponent  selection,  implementation  arrangements,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (ii)\ntransparency and accountability; and (iii) commitment to cost sharing and participation in O&M.\n\n\f43\n\nAppendix 4, page 2\n\nD.\n\nSpecific Conditions\n\n5.\nWhile  the  implementation  arrangements  for  VAI  should  be  flexible  to  reflect  local\nconditions, the participating villages will have to accept and adhere to some specific conditions.\n\n1.\n\nParticipatory Learning and Action Appraisal (PLAA)\n\n6.\nVillage-based  planning  and  design  will  be  carried  out  through  the  process  of  PLAA,  to\nensure consensus building among villagers from all socioeconomic groups. Selected villagers,\nincluding  those  who  usually  have  not  been  involved  in  village-level  decision-making  (such  as\nnon-officeholders),  will  be  trained  in  PLAA  by  Project  Management  and  Implementation  Unit\n(PIMU)/VAI staff and will act as facilitators for this process.\n\n2. \n\nVAI Committee\n\n7.\nVAI will start initially from the existing village organization structure.  However, at the end\nof  the  initial  priority  formulation  by  the  villagers,  a  VAI  committee  will  be  established  among\nthose  who  will  be  directly  involved  in  VAI.  The  committee  will  comprise  the  village  chief,  one\naccountant,  one \nfrom  each  physical\nsubcomponent.  Opportunities  should  be  provided  for  those  who  are  not  currently  village\nofficeholders.  The  Committee  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  and  informing  the  villagers  of\nthe progress and outcomes of VAI and getting their feedback for remedial actions. It will also be\nresponsible for communicating with PIMU/VAI and other relevant parties as necessary.\n\ntechnical  counterpart,  and \n\nrepresentatives \n\ntwo \n\n3. \n\nParticipation of Women and the Poor\n\n8.\nAt least 40 percent of the VAI committee members will be women, while representation\nof  the  poor  will  be  at  least  proportionate  to  the  percentage  of  the  poor  in  each  participating\nvillage.1  At  least  one  representative  of  the  sanitation  subcomponent  will  be  the  poor  as  this\nsubcomponent  targets  the  poor  households.  This  participation  rule  will  apply  to  all  activities,\nincluding  PLAA  meetings,  representation  in  the  initial  resource  persons,  individuals  directly\ninvolved, and monitoring and evaluation activities. The representation of the poor in paid-labor\nopportunities and in the sanitation subcomponent should be much higher, as these activities will\ntarget the poor. Some training such as solid waste management may specifically target women.\n\n4.\n\nFocus on Sanitation\n\nThe  importance  of  sanitation  is  largely  unrecognized  but  recognition  is  clearly\n9.\nnecessary.  The  participating  village  will  be  required  to  receive  training  and  be  involved  in\nawareness  campaign  on  public  health  and  environmental  management  before  finalizing  its\npriorities for VAI. The village will also need to understand that targeting the poor households for\nsanitation will benefit the whole community.\n\n5.\n\nVillage Contribution\n\nAt  least  10  percent  of  the  VAI  cost  in  each  village  will  be  covered  by  the  community\n10.\nmembers  in  cash  or  in  kind,  e.g.,  materials,  labor,  supervision  of  works  (initial  discussions\nindicate up to 20 percent is acceptable to village heads depending on the wealth of the village).\nThe  share  of  individual  households  will  be  decided  by  a  village  consensus,  according  to\n\n                                                \n\n1 Each village keeps the number of the poor households based on criteria provided by Vientiane Prefecture.\n\n\f44\nwillingness and ability to pay or contribute. The poor should be exempt from cash contribution.\nThe  process  of  decision  making  and  the  individual  shares  will  be  documented.  The  funds\ngenerated  through  community  contribution  will  be  used  only  to  fund  on-site  sanitation\nimprovements for the poor, and not for any other on-site improvement.\n\nAppendix 4, page 3\n\n6.\n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\n11.\nTo  ensure  the  sustainability  of  infrastructure,  the  village  will  commit  to  undertake\nmaintenance  of  the  infrastructure  developed.  This  will  be  monitored  both  by  the  village\nmembers themselves and PIMU/VAI.\n\n 7.\n\nAdministration Cost and Procurement\n\nUp to 5 percent of the overall VAI budget can be used to cover the costs borne by the\n12.\nvillagers  in  relation  to  planning,  designing,  implementing,  supervision,  and  monitoring  and\nevaluation (this will be reviewed during the implementation of first-year batch of five villages and\nbe  revised  as  appropriate  with  the  approval  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  [ADB]).  The  VAI\ncommittee will keep accounts for all such expenditures and make them accessible to villagers.\nImplementation arrangements will involve local competitive bidding using local contractors and\ncommunity labor, and where appropriate community participation in procurement will be applied,\ninitially on a pilot basis due to the limited experience of this approach in the Lao PDR.\n\n8. \n\nLand Acquisition or Negative Environmental Impact\n\n13.\nThe  infrastructure  identified  will  not  involve  displacement  of  private  assets  at  a\nsignificant  level,  land  acquisition,  and  significant  adverse  environmental  impact.    All  the  land\nnecessary  for  the  proposed  infrastructure  will  come  from  either  government  land  or  the\ncontribution  of  participating  households,  in  which  case  signatures  of  agreement  by  all\ncontributors will be submitted to the village chief. However, if the land required for the proposed\ninfrastructure  is  of  a  significant  size  as  to  disrupt  the  livelihood  of  individual  households,  or  if\nthere are any encumbrances, the PIMU will be consulted to make a final decision. If it is decided\nthat the proposed works should proceed through expropriation, the affected households will be\ncompensated at full replacement value in accordance with the Project\u2019s resettlement action plan\ndeveloped  for  Part  A,  which  requires  close  supervision  by  PIMU.    PIMU  will  inform  ADB  on  a\nno-objection basis.\n\n9. \n\nDisplacement of Landless Tenants\n\n14.\nThe  benefits  of  VAI  will  not  materialize  for  the  poor  unless  the  latter  are  free  from  the\nfear  of  being  displaced.  The  village-based  monitoring  and  external  monitoring  by  an\nindependent  third  party  will  make  sure  that  this  will  not  happen.  Individuals  will  address  their\ngrievance  to  the  village  chief  who  may  then  communicate  the  grievance  (if  not  resolved)  to\nPIMU. A baseline on the landless poor will be established at the outset of VAI in each village.\n\nE.\n\nFramework for VAI Implementation\n\nThe following steps will be followed in implementing the VAI subprojects. They may be\n\n15.\nreviewed and modified by PIMU as it acquires more experience in the program.\n\n1.\n\nVillage Selection\n\n16. While fundamentally the VAI  program will be demand-led, with villages admitted to the\nprogram based on a strong commitment, applicant villages will be selected on the basis of a set\n\n\fAppendix 4, page 4\n\n45\nof procedures and a series of eligibility criteria. It appears that most villages within the Vientiane\nurban  area  will  apply  for  inclusion  in  the  program.  PIMU  will  select  for  inclusion  about  five\nvillages for the first year, and thereafter about 12 villages per annum. Priority for early inclusion\nwill initially be based on the following criteria: (i) incidence of infectious diseases; (ii) quality and\ncoverage of existing drainage; (iii) incidence of flooding; (iv) quality of access; (v) incidence of\nsanitation  problems;  (vi)  socioeconomic  conditions,  especially  the  prevalence  and  depth  of\npoverty;  (vii)  extent  of  demand  as  expressed  by  the  commitment  of  village  heads  and\ncommittees to project participation and extent of problems identified; (viii) beneficiary of the land\ntitling project supported by the World Bank and Australian Agency for International Development\n(as  area  improvement  without  secure  and  clear  land  use  rights  may  cause  problems);  (ix)\nnearness  to  the  trunk  infrastructure  from  which  villages  can  be  served;  and  (x)  revenue\ncollection  efficiency,  as  expressed  by  village  performance  in  the  mandated  local  collection  of\nvillage  taxes.  The  selection  criteria  will  be  further  developed  during  the  early  stages  of  VAI\nimplementation, but will likely include a number of physical and social aspects.\n\n2.\n\nOutline Procedure for VAI Implementation\n\n17.\nIn  outline,  the  VAI  implementation  procedure  will  involve  (i)  orientation  of  the  Social\nAction  Unit  and  other  divisions  within  VUDAA  by  PIMU  consultants  (community  development\nand gender specialists and community preparation and awareness experts), and assignment of\nengineers and social staff (4 engineers and 4 social experts) to work directly with PIMU for the\nVAI component, and further orientation/training of the assigned staff for the operation of VAI; (ii)\na briefing by PIMU/VAI to village chiefs on the nature, potential scope, principles and conditions,\nand criteria for inclusion in the VAI program; (iii) a series of village-level meetings to introduce\nthe  nature,  objective,  scope,  potential  benefits  from  environmental  improvements,  cost\nimplications,  requirement  of  community  contribution,  general  principles  and  conditions  and\napproach of the VAI Program; (iv) receipt of applications from villages and selection of the first\ngroup  of  villages  in  the  annual  program;  (v)  village-based  priority  formulation  by  the  selected\nvillages through use of PLAA and submission of village proposal outline to PIMU; and (vi) full-\nfledged village-based appraisal and submission of final village proposal to PIMU. The details of\nvillage-based priority formulation and full-fledged appraisal follow.\n\na.\n\nVillage-Based Priority Formulation\n\nIn  each  village  included  in  the  annual  program,  the  following  PLAA  activities  will  take\n\n18.\nplace for about two months.2\n\n(i) \n\nOrienting  villagers  to  the  VAI.  The  first  orientation  will  be  conducted  in  the  village\nmeeting  attended  by  the  village  chief  and  deputy  chiefs;  representatives  from  the  Lao\nWomen\u2019s  Union,  the  Lao  Youth  Union,  and  the  Lao  Front;  representatives  from\nhousehold  clusters;  representatives  of  the  poor  in  the  respective  villages,  and  other\ninterested  individuals.  Cluster  chiefs  will  then  brief  individual  households  on  VAI.  This\nwill  be  accompanied  by  media-based  information  dissemination,  e.g.,  posters,  radio,\nnewspapers  to  be  carried  out  by  PIMU  assisted  by  community  preparation  and\nawareness experts.\n\n                                                \n\n2  Two pilot villages of Ban Fay and Ban Savang were selected. They have completed the village proposal outline,\nand will be included in the first year program. The cost estimate is $102,465 and $61,680, respectively. However,\nmore extensive PLAA and training are required for detailed planning and design.\n\n\f(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nAppendix 4, page 5\n\n46\n\nSigning  a  memorandum  of  understanding  (MOU). After  the  orientation  and  information\ndissemination,  at  least  one  village-wide  meeting  will  be  held  to  decide  whether  the\nconcerned village is willing to participate in the VAI program and to accept the principles\nand conditions. If participation is decided, an MOU will be signed by the village chief and\nPIMU within 30 days from the first orientation meeting.\n\nSelecting  initial  resource  persons  to  represent  all  the  household  clusters.  The  number\nmay be 15 to 20 - at least 40 percent are women - depending on the size of the village.\nOpportunities should be given to those who are not currently village officeholders. The\npoor should be represented among the resource persons at least at the rate equivalent\nto the village\u2019s poverty incidence.\n\nTraining selected resource persons on PLAA. Training will cover participatory planning,\nleadership,  gender  sensitization,  and  public  health/environmental  management,  carried\nout by community preparation and awareness experts.\n\nVillage-based priority formulation through PLAA. PLAA will also collect simple baseline\ninformation on the major problems and socioeconomic situation of villagers for the use in\nfuture  impact  monitoring.  Village  mapping  and  mapping  of  the  poor  will  be  carried  out.\nAt  the  predesign  phase  of  the  chosen  subproject  components,  the  direct  beneficiaries\nwill work closely with PIMU/VAI, especially in survey activities, to ensure that the design\nmeets their needs.\n\nFinalizing  village  proposal  outline  based  on  PLAA  results  and  village  consensus.  The\nProposal  will  have  a  shortlist  of  physical  subcomponents,  justification  for  each\ncomponent, including who will benefit and how, rough cost estimates, and the names of\nthose directly involved in each subcomponent. The PIMU/VAI will help in preparing the\nproposal  and  will  have  a  transparent  process  for  subproject  approval,  which  will  be\ndisseminated to participating villages and communities.\n\n(vii)\n\nSubmitting the village proposal outline to PIMU/VAI for review. PIMU/VAI staff, based on\nthe  proposals,  will  identify  and  plan  the  technical  inputs  required  for  full-fledged\nappraisal in each village.\n\nb.\n\nFull-Fledged Village-Based Appraisal\n\nFurther planning and design will be carried out in each village according to the following\n\n19.\nsteps. The process may take about four months on average.\n\nEstablishing  the  VAI  Committee.    Among  the  names  of  participants  identified  in  the\nvillage proposal outline, and following the participation rule, a formal VAI committee will\nbe established (para. 7).\n\nSelection of design options by the individuals involved through PLAA. Design and level\nof  service  options  include  physical  designs,  financial  plan,  mode  of  contract  (local\ncompetitive bidding vs community contracting), cost sharing, O&M, and monitoring and\nevaluation arrangements, and other aspects identified as necessary. VAI committee will\ncoordinate.\n\nTraining  of  participants.  In  parallel  to  (ii),  the  PIMU/VAI  assisted  by  community\npreparation  and  awareness  experts  will  train  participants  in  participatory  infrastructure\ndevelopment, O&M and monitoring and evaluation. Such training may be conducted with\nother villages that are at a similar stage of VAI.\n\n\f(iv) \n\nPreparing the final village proposal. The final proposal, including detailed cost estimates,\ncost sharing, O&M, implementation arrangements, schedule, and monitoring indicators,\nis  prepared  with  the  help  of  the  PIMU/VAI.  The  proposal  will  be  presented  at  a  village\nmeeting, and needs to be endorsed by the villagers from different groups.\n\n47\n\nAppendix 4, page 6\n\n(v) \n\nSubmission of Final Village Proposal to PIMU for final approval.\n\nc.\n\nImplementation\n\nDuring the implementation stage, VAI committees under the guidance of PIMU/VAI, will\n20.\nensure  that  funds  flow,  procurement,  labor  arrangement,  supervision  of  works  and  any  other\nactivities  will  be  documented  (the  following  paras.  describe  monitoring).  The  committee  is\nresponsible  for  monthly  reporting  to  PIMU/VAI.  The  implementation  stage  may  take  about  six\nmonths (one dry season) on average.\n\nd.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\nThe  committee  is  responsible  for  both  process  and  impact  monitoring.  Process\n21.\nmonitoring  indicators  may  include  (i)  planned  vs  actual  duration  of  tender,  construction  of\nfacilities,  or  procurement  of  equipment  for  each  physical  subcomponent;  (ii)  person-days  and\nwage (or labor contribution); if local labor is used,; (iii) number of households benefiting from the\ninfrastructure; (iv) condition of infrastructure developed; (v) frequency of maintenance; (vi) types\nand  dates  of  training  provided  and  the  number  and  names  of  participants  disaggregated  by\ngender,  poor/non-poor,  and  officeholders  vs  non-officeholders;  (vii)  types  and  dates  of\nmeetings/workshops  held  and  the  participants;  and  (viii)  number  and  types  of  complaints\naddressed to the committee and village chief. Process monitoring will continue monthly during\nthe project period, and results will be submitted to PIMU/VAI.\n\n22.\nParticipatory impact monitoring will be carried out twice; six months and twelve months\nafter the completion of  all physical  works. Impact monitoring indicators may include (i) the felt\nbenefits and the level of satisfaction with the infrastructure and services, (ii) the felt benefits and\nthe  level  of  satisfaction  on  the  decision-making  process  of  VAI,  (iii)  major  problems,  and  (iv)\nimpact of VAI on livelihood. Information for (i) - (iv) will be collected by the committee through\nPLAA with focus group discussions among women/men, village officeholders/non-officeholders\nand the poor/non-poor. More detailed but efficient indicators will be developed by the villagers\nduring  the  design  phase.  The  findings  will  be  reported  to  PIMU/VAI.  PIMU  will  also  carry  out\nbeneficiary satisfaction surveys.\n\n23.\nAny  problem  identified  by  villagers  during  implementation  and  post-implementation\nstages  will  be  reported  to  the  committee.  The  committee  will  discuss  with  villagers  possible\nremedial  measures.  If  this  cannot  solve  the  problems,  the  committee  through  village  chief  will\ncontact the PIMU for further advice.\n\n24.\nGiven  the  complexity  of  VAI  and  the  limited  capacity  and  experience  of  VUDAA  and\nvillages  in  this  type  of  activity,  an  independent  external  monitoring  agency  (nongovernment\norganization)  will  be  hired  for  periodical  monitoring  of  the  preliminary  impact  of  VAI  for  three\nphases.  The  agency  will  not  only  monitor  the  financial,  technical,  environmental,  and\nsocioeconomic aspects but also dispute resolutions, especially those between the poor and the\nbetter-off residents. The agency will report to PIMU and ADB and recommend further actions as\nnecessary. The view and support of the external monitoring agency will complement the village-\nbased participatory self-monitoring and periodical supervision by PIMU.    \n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 5, page 1\n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n\nTable A5.1:  Cost Estimates (by project component)\n($ million)\n\nComponent\n\nA.

Most of the proposed improvements will be made within existing rights-\nof-way, and as such no additional land is required. In some cases, however, the proposed new\nalignments  or  right-of-way  widening  will  involve  the  acquisition  of  land  and  also  affect  a  few\nstructures. A full resettlement action plan, which is a supplementary appendix, was prepared on\nthe  basis  of  comprehensive  socioeconomic  and  physical  surveys,  and  interviews  with  the\nconcerned households.\n\nB. \n\nScope and Scale of Resettlement\n\n2.\nResettlement  and  relocation  activities  will  be  limited  since  (i)  most  subproject\ncomponents  involve  work  within  existing  rights-of-way,  (ii)  the  amount  of  new  land  required  is\nvery small, and (iii) most of this is at the edge of the urban area. The Project will require 12.9\nhectares (ha). About 9 ha is in private use whereas the remaining 3.9 ha is government-owned\nland. Of the over 30,000 households within the Vientiane urban area, only about 89 households\n(500  persons)  will  be  affected  by  full  partial  loss  of  their  houses,  outbuildings,  property\nboundaries, or paddy lands. No encroachers or squatters were found in the affected areas.\n\n3.\nOf  the  total  89  households  affected,  48  will  have  effects  on  their  houses  or  other\nstructures.  Eighteen  of  these  structures  are  temporary  shelters,  made  of  light  materials\n(bamboo), and the remaining 30 are of brick or wood. Many affected structures are outhouses\nrather  than  the  main  family  dwelling.  Where  the  dwelling  is  affected,  only  part  is  required.  In\nmost  cases,  householders  will  have  to  give  up  narrow  strips  of  unirrigated  paddy  land.  These\nhouseholders  will  be  provided  with  either  replacements  from  adjoining  land,  or  land  of  equal\nutility and value elsewhere within the same district, or they will be paid the full market value of\nthe  land  taken.  Trees,  shrubs,  or  gardens  will  be  affected  in  a  few  households,  and  in  such\ncases full compensation will be paid. Of the 48 affected structures, only 6 will require relocation\nand  resettlement  of  the  households.  These  households  will  be  accommodated  in  the  same\nvillage if possible. It is estimated that only two of the masonry structures will require relocation\naway  from  their  existing  sites.  In  these  cases,  alternative  alignments  are  available  that  could\navoid relocation. As a result of the resettlement action plan, none of the affected households will\npermanently  lose  either  agricultural  landholding  or  income  generation  sources.  A  summary  of\nthe land requirements by project component and the associated houses and structures affected\nis shown in Table A9.1. Given that no encroachers or squatters are affected by the Project, and\nthat  many  of  the  affected  people  are  living  on  roadsides  where  access  is  easier,  the  affected\npeople are in general relatively well off.\n\nC. \n\nPolicy Framework\n\n4.\nThe  project  policy  framework  and  compensation  strategy  are  based  on  (i)  the  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank\u2019s  (ADB's)  policy  on  Involuntary Resettlement (1995)  and  Handbook on\nResettlement (1998), (ii) the Lao PDR legislative framework, and (iii) good practice established\nunder other ADB and World Bank-supported projects as there is as yet no formal Government\npolicy on involuntary resettlement. All land is the property of the nation and ownership means\nonly  the  right  to  use  land.  However,  land  rights  are  transferable  and  the  right  to  use  land  is\neffectively  equivalent  to  ownership.  The  constitutional  rights  of  land  users  are  protected  by\nArticle  5  of  the  Land  Law,  with  categories  of  agricultural  land,  forestland,  construction  land,\ncommunications  land,  cultural land,  defense and security land, and water area land.

Apart  from  construction  land  and  a  small  amount  of\nagricultural land, no other types of land are affected by the Project.\n\n1.\nUnder the Land Law (Article 43), persons entitled to use land have these rights: (i) keep\nthe  land  for  a  specific  purpose,  (ii)  use  the  land  in  accordance  with  the  State\u2019s  management\nplans, (iii) enjoy usufruct from the land, (iv) transfer the right of land use, and (v) bequeath the\nright  of  land  use.  Article  63  states  that  the  right  of  land  use  will  terminate  either  through\nvoluntary  relinquishment  of  the  land  or  with  State  retrieval  of  the  land  for  public  purposes.\nCompensation is treated in Articles 67-71, which require each village, province, municipality, or\nspecial zone to keep 5 percent of its total land area in reserve for compensating requisitioned\nland. However, most urban villages of Vientiane do not retain such a provision, and relocations\nwithin  the  same  village  may  not  always  be  possible.  The  Road  Law  (1999)  sets  out  the  road\nlimits, including the right-of-way, for different classes of roads. By that law, people with land use\nrights  will  be  compensated  if  the  land  is  expropriated  for  road  construction.  The  same  can  be\ninferred as being applicable to those whose land is expropriated for drainage and other public\ninfrastructure.\n\nD.\n\nCompensation\n\n2.\nThe affected households will receive replacement land or cash for land and immovable\nassets  at  replacement  prices.  A  number  of  additional  benefits  will  also  be  provided  to\ncompensate  for  loss  of  business,  income,  or  workdays,  and  to  cover  the  cost  of  the  shifting\nhouse  structures  or  goods,  etc.  Given  the  limited  impact  on  most  affected  properties,\npreliminary  discussion  with  affected  households  has  revealed  a  preference  in  favor  of  on-site\nrelocation.  Since  in  most  cases  the  project  will  involve  loss  of  frontage  or  of  a  garden  and\noutbuildings,  the  strategy  adopted  is  to  retain  households  at  or  adjacent  to  their  current\nlocations wherever possible. The entitlement matrix is presented in Table A9.2.\n\nThe \n\nitems \n\ntwo  major  cost \n\nfor\n3.\nresidential/commercial  land  (plots  with  or  without  structures  thereon)  and  the  costs  for\nrelocation/shifting of permanent or semipermanent structures. The costs derived are based on\ncurrent  information  on  unit  prices  in  Vientiane  and  the  experience  gained  under  the  recently\ncompleted  Vientiane  Integrated  Urban  Development  Project  (VIUDP).  The  detailed  estimated\nland acquisition and resettlement costs and the cost of implementation are shown in Table A9.3.\n\nfor  resettlement  will  be  compensation  payable \n\n4.\nAs  part  of  the  process  for  determining  types  of  compensation  offered,  consultation\nmeetings will be held with affected individuals and communities to elicit their preference among\nthe  options  available.  The  project  implementation  unit  (PIMU)  together  with  resettlement\ncommittees to be formed by Vientiane Urban Development Administration Authority (VUDAA) at\nVientiane  Prefecture  and  district  levels  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  resettlement\naction plan. Project-affected people will have the right to file complaints and submit queries on\nany  aspect  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Relocation  will  be  carried  out  immediately\nbefore civil works and during land acquisition, which will be implemented in 2002 and the first\nhalf of 2003. Compensation for land will be made before relocation. PIMU, in consultation with\nresettlement  committees,  will  internally  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  action\nplan.  An  external  monitoring  agency  (nongovernment  organization),  to  be  hired  to  monitor\nvillage  area  improvements  component,  will  also  be  involved  in  periodical  independent\nmonitoring of the implementation of resettlement.\n\n\fTable A9.2: Entitlement Matrix\n\nType of Loss\n\nApplication\n\nDefinition of Entitled Person\n\nCompensation Policy\n\nImplementation Issues\n\nPermanent

Context\n\n1.\nThe  Vientiane  urban  area  covers  100  villages  in  four  districts  for  which  the  Vientiane\nUrban Development Administration Authority (VUDAA) is responsible. The current population is\nestimated at 162,000 growing at the rate of 1.2 per annum over the past five years. The greater\nVientiane  urban  area,  within  the  boundaries  of  the  master  plan  cover  189  villages,  with  a\npopulation  of  325,000,  growing  at  3.3  per  annum.  The  1997  Vientiane  Social  Survey  Project\nindicates that about half the current population were born in the Vientiane urban area, and that\nthe bulk of rural-urban migration took place between 1975 and 1990. No official statistics exist\non recent migration trends, but anecdotal evidence suggests that there is a growing number of\nmigrant workers employed by the industry, especially textiles, although the scale is still limited.\n\nThe  ethnicity  composition  for  Vientiane  Prefecture  in  the  1995  Census  is  92.6  percent\n2.\nLao  Loum  (lowland  Lao)  and  7.4  percent  various  ethnic  minority  groups.  However,  this\ninformation  grossly  understates  the  ethnic  or  even  nationality  diversity  within  each  village  of\nurban  Vientiane.  For  example,  Ban  Nong  Chan,  one  of  the  villages  selected  for  the  Project\u2019s\nparticipatory poverty assessment, had Lao (65 percent), Vietnamese (23 percent), and Chinese\nand  others  (12  percent).  Ten  percent  of  the  population  was  unregistered  immigrants.  The\nparticipatory  poverty  assessment  identified  that  ethnic  minorities  are  often  found  among  the\npoorest and tenants without legal land titles.\n\n3.\nThe Government sector, commerce, and trade employ more than 50 percent of the labor\nforce in urban districts, but 18 percent of the households still depend on farming as their primary\nincome source. The urban-rural mixture is apparent from the current land use pattern in which\nagricultural  and  residential/commercial  land  plots  exist  side  by  side.  Many  of  the  households\nhave  more  than  one  income  source,  and  48  percent  depend  on  remittances  from  relatives\nresiding outside the country. Educational attainment is low \u2013 about 32 percent of the population\nnever  went  beyond  primary  school  \u2013  and  that  of  women  is  much  lower;  about  45  percent  of\nmothers  stopped  at  primary  level,  compared  with  28  percent  of  fathers.  Health  facilities  need\nfurther upgrading. Water- and feces-borne diseases are highly prevalent, especially among the\npoor, whose access to health services is limited.\n\n2.\n\nProfile of the Urban Poor\n\n4.\nAccording  to  the  data  in  the  Lao  Expenditure  and  Consumption  Survey  (LECS  II),  the\nincidence of poverty in the Lao PDR is estimated at 38.6 percent. The country is ranked at the\nbottom  fifth  of  the  countries  in  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme\u2019s  human\ndevelopment  index,  reflecting  its  low  performance  in  the  human  development  sector.  LECS  II\nalso estimates poverty incidence in urban Vientiane at 17 percent. This is close to the poverty\nincidence  of  18  percent  identified  through  the  participatory  poverty  assessment  (based  on  the\ninformation  collected  through  village  chiefs)  using  the  income  of  KN150,000  per  capita  per\n\n                    \n1 The  Project\u2019s  social  and  poverty  assessment  is  derived  from  both  primary  and  secondary  sources.  The  primary\nsources are (i) a participatory poverty assessment covering 750 poor households in seven villages in four districts\nin Vientiane urban area, (ii) a questionnaire responded by 100 village chiefs in the Vientiane urban area, and (iii) a\nnumber of consultations with key stakeholders from the Government, industry managers, and funding agencies and\nnongovernment  organizations.  The  secondary  sources  are  (i)  1995  National  Census  (Vientiane  Prefecture),  (ii)\n1997 Vientiane Social Survey Project for urban districts in Vientiane, and (iii) other studies and documents.\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nmonth as a poverty line. The assessment also shows that 3 percent of the population belonged\nto the poorest group with an income of less than KN60,000 per capita per month.\n\n5.\nUnlike  other  cities  in  the  region,  where  the  poor  reside  in  well-defined  slum  areas,  the\npoor  in  the  Vientiane  urban  are  literally  hidden  in  pockets  throughout  the  city.  Urban  village\nsettlements are highly heterogeneous; the poor households are often found adjacent to higher-\nincome settlements. The vast majority of the poor live on low-lying wetland areas, flooded most\nof  the  year.  These  areas  are  acutely  underserviced,  and  the  links  from  access  roads  to  the\ndwellings are via difficult routes.\n\n6.\nDue  to  the  complex  nature  of  urban  poverty,  there  is  no  single  definition  of  the  poor,\nHowever, the vulnerable groups, which are often the poor, include the physically and mentally\ndisabled,  drug  users/alcoholics,  elderly  people  living  alone,  the  homeless  and  street  children,\ninfrequent  beggars,  female  headed  households,  illegal  immigrants,  dropouts  and  unemployed\nyouth, large families with low income, and ethnic minorities. The poor can be categorized into\ntuk ti sut  (the  poorest)  who  are  destitute,  tuk pang kang  (medium  poor)  usually  employed  in\nirregular low-paying jobs, and tuk thammada (simple poor) who may have a house and land but\nare very susceptible to slipping into a more vulnerable way of life.\n\n7.\nPoverty reduction is the Government's key development strategy. In the Seventh Round\nTable  Meeting  in  November  2000,  the  Government  reconfirmed  its  commitment  to  eradicate\npoverty  and  to  move  out  of  the  ranks  of  least  developed  countries  by  2020.  In  Vientiane\nPrefecture, the governor issued a five-year plan to eradicate poverty by 2005. The participatory\npoverty  assessment  noted,  however,  that  to  date  there  has  been  no  targeted  urban  poverty\nreduction  programs,  although  emergency  assistance  during  fire  and  flood,  assistance  to  the\ndisabled and orphans, and access to metered electricity have been provided by the Ministry of\nSocial Welfare. There is also a system in urban Vientiane that the village authority enable the\npoorest to receive some form of state assistance (e.g., rice provision) in case of emergencies or\nother  external  shocks.  Other  formal  assistance  includes  a  village-based  revolving  drug  fund,\nfree treatment for registered destitute at district hospitals, subsidized education and vocational\ncourses,  and  an  orphan  center.  Financial  services  for  the  poor  are  currently  limited  to  the\nsavings and credit program funded by the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF),\nand covering thus far 30 villages in Chanthabouly District. The program has been successfully\nproviding saving and credit services to 1,684 individuals since 1995 at a close to 100 percent\nrepayment rate.\n\nNonetheless,  formal  programs  do  not  reach  all  poor.  Informal  coping  mechanisms\n8.\nreported  by  the  poor  include  (i)  informal  support  system,  e.g.,  obtaining  food  or  borrowing\nmoney  from  neighbors;  (ii)  engaging  in  survival  activities,  e.g.,  begging,  collecting  vegetables\nand catching fish from swamps, and selling assets; (iii) engaging in illegal activities, e.g., drug\ndealing, stealing, prostitution; and (iv) reducing consumption and costs of living, e.g., eating less\nand not buying drinking water.\n\nB.\n\nConstraints on the Urban Poor\n\n1.\n\nPhysical Exclusion\n\nThe  problem-ranking  exercise  of  the  participatory  poverty  assessment  found  that  the\n9.\nurban  poor  in  Vientiane  have  strong  and  urgent  need  for  improved  urban  infrastructure  and\nservices.  It  also  highlighted  the  strong  linkage  between  poor  infrastructure  conditions  and  the\nability  to  engage  in  subsistence  economic  activities  near  the  house.  The  service  problems\nthough  varied  across  villages  include  in  order  of  priority  (i)  constant  flooding,  (ii)  inadequate\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\naccess  paths  and  roads,  (iii)  poor  sanitation  facilities  and  sewerage,  (iv)  uncollected  rubbish,\nand (v) sharing water and electricity supply.  All these problems are closely linked.\n\n10.\nFlooding is felt at almost all times of the year, as the poor tend to live in low-lying land. \nThe situation was exacerbated recently with the construction of multistory concrete houses by\nthe better-off, which allow the run off from these houses into the adjacent lower, poorer areas\npushing  the  poor  back  onto  lower  and  more  marginal  land.  Polluted  water  flows  create  poor\nenvironmental  conditions  and  waterborne  skin  and  foot  diseases.  Lack  of  space  outside  the\ndwelling for daily activities hinders subsistence economic activities, such as growing vegetables\nor raising livestock.\n\n11.\nAccess paths are impossible or difficult to use because of constant flooding. During the\nmonsoon  season,  most  of  the  poor  access  their  dwellings  along  narrow  timber  planks,\nbalancing  on  dirty  floodwater.  The  elderly  and  disabled  cannot  go  out  of  their  houses,  which\nworsens their vulnerability and marginalization. Even in higher areas, access may be limited by\nthe  narrow  width  of  the  paths  between  houses  and  the  unplanned  and  haphazard  settlement\npattern.  This  makes  the  service  delivery  difficult,  such  as  access  by  vacuum  tankers,  water\ndelivery  trucks,  emergency  services,  and  rubbish  collection  vehicles,  and  routing  of  water\nsupply pipes.\n\nThe  poor  do  not  have  access  to  a  typical  range  of  sanitation  options  available  to  low-\n12.\nincome  households  in  many  other  countries.  The  most  common  system  is  to  dump  human\nwaste  into  floodwaters  or,  at  best,  in  corroded  oil  drums  thus  allowing  effluent  to  run  into  the\nfloodwaters. Most household sanitation facilities are without secure enclosure; this is especially\na problem for women.   \n\n13.\nThere  is  almost  no  household  or  community  management  of  solid  waste  in  the  low-\nincome areas.  A large number of households throw their waste beside or under their dwellings\nor dump it in the swamp or collection areas from which it is not always collected. This creates\nunhygienic  conditions  with  flies,  and  rotting  waste  with  its  putrid  smells,  further  contaminating\nthe floodwaters.\n\nMost households, except the poorest, have some level of access to piped water supply\n14.\nfrom Nam Papa Lao. The informal arrangement whereby the connected households sell water\nto  the  unconnected  ones  at  a  fee  of  about  KN5,000-15,000  per  month  is  widespread.  Water\ncollected through flexible hoses is stored in drums for long periods creating a breeding ground\nfor  malarial  mosquitoes.  However,  apart  from  the  poorest,  most  poor  buy  bottled  water  for\ndrinking.  Electricity  coverage  is  also  high  at  about  90  percent.  The  same  informal  sharing\narrangement  as  with  water  exists  for  electricity;  the  proportions  of  metered  electricity  and\nsharing are about 50:50. The poor allocate about 5 percent of their income to electricity. \n\n2.\n\nSocial Exclusion\n\n15.\nOne  key  manifestation  of  the  social  exclusion  of  the  poor  is  the  formal  land  titling\nprocess.  The  Land  Titling  Project,  financed  by  the  World  Bank  and  Australian  Agency  for\nInternational  Development,  is  in  the  process  of  surveying,  assigning,  and  registering  titles\nthroughout Vientiane Prefecture and other towns. As of January 2001, 57 villages in Vientiane\nurban  area  have  completed  the  process,  10  villages  have  started,  and  33  villages  have  not\nstarted. Around 13,000 of about 49,000 titles have been issued. The notable lack of formal land\nuse  rights  among  most  of  the  poor  households  suggests  that  the  land  titling  initiative  is\nbenefiting  better-off  groups,  e.g.,  government  officials  and  war  veterans,  disproportionately.\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 10, page 4\n\nEven the poor households that have resided in the same place more than a decade may not be\nrecognized deserving of their land use rights. \n\n16.\nPoverty and lack of land use rights are closely linked.  Fear of eviction was ranked one\nof the highest among the problems of the poor. The practice thus far is this: when land occupied\nby the poor is demanded for development purposes, either the poor are directly asked to move\nout or landowners indirectly force the poor out through exorbitant rent increases or by cutting off\nwater and electricity supplies. Under these circumstances, the poor have little incentive to invest\nin maintaining and upgrading their housing and urban services.  \n\n17.\nHelplessness caused by socioeconomic marginalization is a major characteristic of the\npoor. The poor perceive that they cannot get a job because they are so poor that they are not\nwanted  by  other  people.  However,  the  success  of  the  UNCDF-funded  savings  and  credit\nscheme  suggests  that  a  carefully  targeted,  home-based,  microenterprise  development\napproach can help the poor come out of the trap of marginalization.\n\nGender-based  exclusion  is  also  prevalent  in  urban  Vientiane,  as  apparent  in  the\n18.\nwomen's  low  social  status  and  political  representation.  Despite  the  existence  of  the  well-\norganized  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union  (LWU)  at  the  community  level,  women  are  usually  not  key\ndecision  makers  in  village  meetings,  not  to  mention  at  a  higher  level  in  the  political  and\nadministrative  structure.  Poor  women  suffer  from  the  double  impact  of  exclusion.  As  family\ncaretakers  and  home-based  economic  producers,  and  also  primary  users  and  managers  of\nenvironmental  services  in  the  household  and  neighborhood,  poor  women  disproportionately\nface the burden of poor sanitation and environmental conditions. Women\u2019s health, reproductive\nhealth in particular, is at high risk.\n\n19. Women\u2019s  exclusion  from  the  formal  land  titling  process  is  also  a  growing  concern.  A\nrecent  survey  carried  out  by  LWU  in  Vientiane  and  three  other  towns2  shows  that  only  the\nhusbands\u2019  name  was  written  on  the  land  title  in  58  percent  of  the  households  surveyed,\nwhereas  the  traditional  inheritance  patterns  in  only  18  percent  of  the  households  surveyed\nshows  that  land  actually  belonged  to  the  husband.  This  is  especially  problematic  among  the\ntraditionally  matrilineal  ethnic  groups  such  as  the  Lao  Loum.  The  adverse  impact  on  women\nwas  taken  up  by  the  Land  Titling  Project  Office  which  will  carry  out  awareness  raising  and\nadvocacy campaign on women\u2019s full or joint land rights for further titling process.\n\n20.\nAnother  primary  problem  identified  by  the  poor  is  that  the  school  dropouts  and/or\nunemployed  young  people  are  exposed  to  the  risks  of  drug  use,  alcoholism,  sex  work,  and\ngambling, causing their social marginalization. Poor health, disability, ethnicity, illegal migration,\nand old age also contribute to social exclusion.\n\nC.\n\nThe Project's Social Strategy\n\n21.\nThe  overall  project  approach  to  social  and  poverty  issues  includes  (i)  extending  the\nbenefits from the Project to the community by focusing on the linkage between the primary and\nsecondary/tertiary-level  infrastructure;  (ii)  combining  the  physical  and  social  components\nthrough which procedures and conditions for village area improvements (VAI) are established to\navoid implementing the physical component in isolation from the social one (Appendix 4 gives\nthe  participatory  implementation  framework  for  VAI);  (iii)  building  capacity  at  all  levels  of\nstakeholders  including  VUDAA,  villages,  and  direct  beneficiaries  to  manage  the  social  and\n\n                    \n2  Marriage and Family in the Lao PDR: The Pilot Survey on the Situation of Lao Women (Lao Women\u2019s Union/GRID\n\nCenter, July 2000).\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 10, page 5\n\nphysical  components  such  as  participatory  learning  and  action  appraisals  (PLAA),  gender\nawareness, public health and hygiene, and environmental management through classroom and\non-the-job  training;  and  (iv)  promoting  stakeholder  participation  at  all  levels  and  sensitizing\nvillage  organizations  to  their  potential  for  participatory  and  responsive  urban  governance.  The\nspecific strategies follow.\n\n1.\n\nStakeholder Participation\n\nThe Project has been prepared with extensive participation of stakeholders at all levels:\n22.\npoor  men  and  women;  adversely  affected  people;  village,  district,  and  prefecture\nrepresentatives;  relevant  ministries;  private  sector  representatives;  and  funding  agencies.  The\nProject will ensure direct participation of village communities through (i) the VAI component that\nallows  community  participation  and  empowerment  of  village  communities  in  community-based\ndecision making, infrastructure development, service delivery, financial management, operation\nand  maintenance  (O&M),  and  monitoring  and  evaluation,  (ii)  raising  awareness  of  the\nimportance of environmental improvements in promoting public health, as part of VAI; and (iii)\nimplementation  of  a  resettlement  action  plan.  Specific  mechanisms  have  been  included  to\nensure the meaningful participation and representation of the poor and women.\n\n2.\n\nUrban Services for the Poor\n\n23.\nThe  Project  will  address  the  priority  needs  of  the  poor  both  directly  and  indirectly.  The\ndirect targeting mechanisms in VAI under part B of the Project include (i) direct participation and\nrepresentation  of  the  poor  in  village-based  decision  making  and  training/public  awareness\nraising (minimum requirement of the percentage equivalent to the poverty level in each village);\n(ii)  formation  of  poor-only  focus  groups  in  PLAA;  (iii)  targeting  the  poor  in  sanitation\nsubcomponent  and  leadership  training;  (iv)  safeguard  against  forced  eviction  of  the  poor  from\nthe land that they occupy, based on neighborhood monitoring and a grievance mechanism; (v) a\ngradation  of  services  providing  a  range  of  options  affordable  to  the  poor;  (vi)  prioritization  of\nvillages  with  higher  levels  of  poverty  in  the  village  selection;  (vii)  priority  to  the  poor  in  hiring\nlaborers  for  construction  activities;  and  (viii)  where  possible,  orientation  for  microfinance  to  be\nprovided  for  under  UNCDF-supported  Microfinance  and  Sustainable  Livelihood  Project.  Other\nproject  components  (citywide  infrastructure  and  services  and  capacity  building)  will  indirectly\nbenefit the poor. Approximately 15,000 poor will directly benefit from VAI while 35-40,000 poor\ncitywide will indirectly benefit from the Project.\n\n3.\n\nGender Strategy\n\n24.\n  The  Project  will  reinforce  women\u2019s  roles  as  primary  users  and  managers  of  urban\nenvironmental services. The strategy to address women\u2019s needs, constraints, and participation\nincludes  (i)  direct  participation  and  representation  of  women  (minimum  40  percent)  in  village-\nbased  decision  making  and  training;  (ii)  formation  of  women-only  focus  groups  in  PLAA;  (iii)\ntargeting  women  in  community-based  sanitation  and  solid  waste  management,  leadership\ntraining,  and  awareness  raising  in  hygiene  and  environmental  management;  (iv)  where\nnecessary, linking the project activities to training of women on land rights provided by the Land\nTitling  Project;  (v)  where  needs  exist,  orientation  for  microfinance  to  be  provided  under  the\nUNCDF-supported Microfinance and Sustainable Livelihood Project; and (vi) gender awareness\ntraining  for  key  VUDAA  staff  (including  the  Social  Action  Unit  and  technical  units)  and  village\nauthorities. The existing structure of LWU at village level will be used. Women\u2019s\n\nleadership and gender awareness training will be provided by LWU's Gender Resource Information and\nDevelopment Center. A gender specialist will be hired to guide implementation of the strategy.\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 10, page 6\n\n4.\n\nStrategy for Ethnic Minorities\n\n25.\nDue  to  the  heterogeneous  composition  and  mixed  residential  patterns  in  urban  Vientiane\ncommunities,  the  Project  will  not  significantly  affect  specific  ethnic  minority  groups.  However,  the\nparticipatory  poverty  assessment  observed  that  ethnic  minorities  and  illegal  immigrants  are  often  found\namong the poor. Specific mechanisms to mitigate the risks of the better-off dominating the VAI decision\nmaking and eviction of the poor, including minority ethnic groups, have been developed (para. 23 above\nand  Appendix  4).  In  addition,  baseline  information  on  ethnicity  will  be  collected  at  the  outset  under  VAI\nand monitored during implementation. \n\n5.\n\nResettlement and Land Acquisition\n\n26.\nThe Project\u2019s resettlement and land acquisition impacts are limited (summary resettlement action\npan is given in Appendix 9). The total land requirement (privately owned land) is about 9 hectares. Only\n89 households (500 persons) will be affected by full or partial loss of their property. Of the 89 households\naffected,  48  will  have  effects  on  their  houses  or  other  structures.  Eighteen  of  these  structures  are\ntemporary  shelters  and  the  remaining  30  are  of  brick  or  wood.  Many  affected  structures  are  outhouses\nrather  than  main  dwelling.  Of  the  48  households,  only  6  will  require  relocation  and  resettlement  of  the\nhouseholds. These households will be accommodated in the same village if possible. No encroachers or\nsquatters  were  found  in  the  affected  areas.  The  affected  households  will  receive  replacement  land  or\ncash  for  land  and  immovable  assets  at  replacement  prices.  Compensation  will  also  be  provided  for\nshifting  of  structures  or  goods  and  loss  of  business  and  livelihood.  A  full  resettlement  action  plan\n(supplementary appendix) with a clear compensation framework, implementation mechanisms, and cost\nestimates was prepared in accordance with policies and practices of the Lao PDR and ADB's Policy on\nInvoluntary Resettlement.\n\n6.\n\nCapacity Building\n\nOne major lesson learned from the previous Vientiane Integrated Urban Development Project is\n27.\nthe  need  for  capacity  building  for  both  service  delivery  agents  and  direct  beneficiaries  in  social\ncomponents.  The  Social  Action  Unit  of  VUDAA  established  during  the  previous  Project  requires  further\nstrengthening  to  implement  the  Project\u2019s  social  and  poverty  strategy.  Various  training  and  public\nawareness campaigns will be held in VUDAA and villages to increase the capacity for community-based\nplanning, O&M, and service delivery. To avoid isolating the social components and ensure integration of\ntechnical and social issues, training in social components such as PLAA will be extended to other VUDAA\nstaff.\n\n7.\n\nProject Management Support\n\n28.\nThe  Project  will  provide  community  development  specialists,  a  land  acquisition/resettlement\nspecialist, and a gender specialist to support the project implementation and further strengthening of the\nSocial  Action  Unit.  Community  preparation  and  awareness  experts  will  also  be  provided  to  conduct\ntraining/orientation activities in the field. PIMU will carry out overall monitoring and evaluation of VAI, the\ncommunity-based processes and public awareness campaign, and resettlement implementation with the\nfull involvement and support of the Social Action Unit of VUDAA. Independent monitoring and evaluation\nof VAI will also be undertaken by an external agency (NGO) in addition to community-based monitoring to\nbe carried out, using simple indicators identified by the community. Both process and impact monitoring\nindicators have been developed to follow through the participation of and impact on the poor, and gender\ndisaggregated where possible.\n\n\fSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION\n\n64\n\nAppendix 11, page 1\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction\n\n1.\nThe  initial  screening  of  the  potential  environmental  impacts  indicates  that  the  Project  will  not\naffect environmentally sensitive areas, nor will it cause large-scale changes in the physical, biological,\nor social environment. It will not involve the accelerated use of scarce resources, nor will it favour the\nuse of these resources to satisfy short-term over long-term economic or socioeconomic needs. It will\nhave  a  basically  neutral  impact  on  the  ecology  of  the  surrounding  areas  and  a  significant  overall\npositive effect on the physical environment. In the long term, it will contribute to the more efficient use of\nresources  by  improving  the  efficiency  of  the  urban  system  and  reducing  the  incidence  of  flooding,\nwaterborne  diseases,  etc.  Where  negative  environmental  impacts  are  unavoidable,  mitigation  and\ncompensatory measures will be taken to minimize such impacts.\n\nThe  nature  of  the  physical  works  proposed  is  limited  in  scope  and  largely  concerns  the\n2.\nimprovement of existing facilities, mainly drainage channels and roads. Indeed, the majority of the\nproject  components  will  bring  clear  environmental  benefits.  Where  negative  impacts  during  the\nconstruction  phase  are  anticipated,  these  are  not  significant  where  (i)  longer-term  benefits  to\nsociety at large exceed short-term costs, and (ii) appropriate mitigation measures are taken during\nthe  construction  phase.  Consequently,  a  full  environmental  impact  assessment  is  not  considered\nnecessary  for  any  of  the  project  interventions  at  this  stage,  and  an  initial  environmental\nexamination  (IEE)  is  sufficient.  The  Project  is  classified  as  category  B,  which  requires  the\npreparation  of  an  IEE.  Summary  IEEs  have  been  prepared  for  each  project  component  and  are\navailable on request.\n\n3.\nThis  summary  IEE  draws  on  the  individual  project  components  IEEs  and  is  prepared  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines. It is based on a series of field visits to the project sites under\nthe  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA).  Software  components  such  as  the  capacity\nbuilding  and  community  preparation  and  awareness,  which  have  no  impact  on  the  environment,\nwere not subjected to an IEE.\n\nB. \n\nDescription of the Project\n\n4.\nThe  Project  will  provide  improved  urban  infrastructure  and  services  and  a  series  of  non-\nphysical  interventions  e.g.,  capacity  building  measures  to  support  physical  improvements.  The\ncomponents follow: (i) part A: citywide urban infrastructure and environmental improvements\u2013road\nimprovements,  drainage,  solid  waste  management,  provision  of  maintenance  equipment,  traffic\nmanagement  and  road  safety,  and  construction  of  an  office  building  for  the  Vientiane  Urban\nDevelopment  Administration  Authority  (VUDAA);  (ii)  part  B:  village  area  improvements  (VAI)\nprogram\u2013environmentally \ninfrastructure  and  service\nfocused  and  community-based  village \nimprovements  (particularly  tertiary  access,  drainage,  sanitation)  and  associated  community\npreparation and public awareness program; and (iii) part C: implementation support and capacity\nin  project\nbuilding\u2013surveys, \nmanagement  and  implementation  and  capacity  building  for  and  human  resource  development  at\nVUDAA.\n\ninvestigations,  and  consulting  services \n\nto  support  VUDAA \n\nC. \n\nDescription of the Environmental Conditions\n\n1.\n\nPhysical Environment\n\nIn general, the project sites can be classified as urban or semi-urban. They are all within the\n5.\nurban  core  areas,  which  are  generally  characterized  by  low-  or  medium-rise  development,\ncontaining  significant  areas  of  poor-quality  infrastructure  and  housing,  interspersed  with  small\nareas of open wasteland, urban agriculture and wetland. The built-up environment of Vientiane is\nhighly  heterogeneous,  with  most  villages  exhibiting  a  mixture  of  high-,  medium-  and  low-  density\nhousing  within  an  area  of  a  few  hectares.  Many  sites  are  low-lying  and  are  subject  to  frequent\n\n\fflooding during the monsoon season. The growth and development of many of the urban areas are\nunplanned.  While  much  of  the  primary  road  and  drainage  network  is  recently  constructed,  and\ngenerally in good condition, local roads are frequently narrow (seldom more than 4 - 5 meters [m]\nwide) and vary in quality of construction and maintenance.\n\n65\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\n6.\nVientiane  lies  on  the  left  bank  of  the  Mekong  River,  and  is  part  of  the  alluvial  plain  that\nconstitutes  most  of  Vientiane  Prefecture.  The  soils  are  in  general  clay  loam  to  a  depth  of  1  m,\nbelow which lies a gravel clay loam to a depth of about 7 m. Below this lies a sandy gravel and silt\nlayer. Most of the urban core area is flat with an elevation of 168 to 170m above ordinance datum,\nalthough  a  slight  ridge  in  the  east  rises  a  few  meters  to  a  height  of  180  m.  Wetland  areas  lie  at\nelevations  between  167  and  168  m  above  ordinance  datum.  The  water  table  fluctuates  with  the\nseason, but is highest at 168m. The urban area is protected from inundation during Mekong flood\nevents by a bund 175 m high. Vientiane has a tropical climate with average annual temperatures\nranging  from  a  low  of  18\u00b0C  during  December-February,  to  31-33\u00b0C  during  March-May.  The\naverage  annual  precipitation  is  between  1,100  and  2,300  millimeters  a  year,  with  more  than  85\npercent of the rain falling during the monsoon season in May-September.\n\n2.\n\nBiological Environment\n\n7.\nWhile  the  Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  has  a  rich  and  diverse  range  of\ntropical flora and fauna, those in the urban and semi-urban areas covered by the Project are typical\nof  flora  and  fauna  in  the  urban  environment.  The  most  notable  flora  are  the  mature  indigenous\nhardwood  trees  lining  major  thoroughfares.  Sadly,  only  a  few  of  these  remain.  Other  trees  are\nmostly ornamental and shade trees planted along roadsides and in gardens. There is some urban\nagriculture\u2013largely  irrigated  and  unirrigated  rice  land.  The  fauna  in  the  urban  area  are  primarily\ngrazing animals such as sheep and goats, domestic animals such as chickens, dogs and ducks,\nand  small  reptiles\u2013the  common  gecko  and  lizards.  Also  common  are  pests\u2013rodents,  stray  cats,\nand insects that typically thrive on wastes in urban environment.\n\n3.\n\nSociocultural Environment\n\n8.\nFor a capital city, the population density of Vientiane is low at about 55 persons per hectare\nin  the  urban  core  area.  Furthermore,  the  population  growth  rate  in  Vientiane  urban  area  is  not\nhigh\u2014averaging about 1.2 percent per annum between 1995 and 2000. The literacy rate is high\u2014\nover  95  percent.  Of  the  numerous  ethnic  groups  in  Vientiane,  almost  all  are  Lao;  only  about  1\npercent of the population are reported to be non-Lao.1 About half of the existing urban population\nmoved to Vientiane after 1975, most in the first five years.\n\nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\n1. \n\nPositive Environmental Impacts\n\nThe  positive  environmental  benefits  resulting  from  the  Project  as  a  whole  will  include  (i)\n9.\nreduced direct exposure of the population to health risks associated with stagnant wastewater and\npolluted  storm  water,  as  a  result  of  drainage  and  sanitation  interventions;  (ii)  additional  health-\nrelated  benefits  resulting  from  the  elimination  of  numerous  sites  where  stagnant  polluted  water\nfavors mosquito breeding, (iii) reduced damage to both properties and infrastructure from flooding;\n(iv) reduced air pollution resulting from (a) reduced vehicle emissions as a result of improved travel\ntimes, and (b) reduced dust pollution as a result of an increase in the proportion of asphalt roads;\n(v)  overall  improvement  in  the  quality  of  the  urban  environment,  and  reduced  odor  and  insect\nnuisance  due  to  reduced  pollution  of  groundwater  and  surface  water  caused  by  indiscriminate\n\n                                                \n\nProject.\n\n1 Institute  of  Cultural  Research,  Ministry  of  Information  and  Culture  of  Lao  PDR,  1997/1998.

In  most\ncases, the components involve upgrading of existing infrastructure, and as such will affect the local\nenvironment  positively.  However,  some  components,  including\u2014sections  of  new  roads,  and\nconstruction  of  the  office  for  VUDAA\u2014make  use  of  land,  which  is  currently  undeveloped,  and  in\nsome cases will involve the movement of structures. In recognition of this potential negative project\nimpact,  a  full  resettlement  action  plan  was  prepared.  In  the  case  of  roads,  improvements  will\nencourage  development,  which  will  in  turn  result  in  land  use  change  and  consequent\nenvironmental impacts such as increased runoff, wastewater flows, traffic, etc. In no case, will the\ndevelopment  resulting  from  project  investments  or  the  project  investments  themselves  encroach\nupon environmentally sensitive areas, or affect historic or cultural resources.\n\nb.\n\nEnvironmental Problems Related to Design\n\n11.\nThe  design  of  new  infrastructure  will  involve  the  development  of  currently  undeveloped\nareas, and the implications of this in terms of runoff and other potential impacts will be considered\nin  design.  In  the  case  of  drainage  design,  wastewater,  sullage,  and  polluted  storm  water  will  be\ndirected away from residential areas through the drainage network. Newly built or improved tertiary\nchannels  will  discharge  into  largely  existing  primary  channels,  and  thence  to  natural  wetland\nsystems.  The  designs  will  ensure  that  the  proposed  improvements  will  not  result  in  new  or\nintensified drainage problems in other areas.\n\n12.\nStandard designs for roads in these proposals include adequate size roadside drains, which\nwill improve the life expectancy of these investments. Roadside and other drains in heavily built-up\nareas  are  likely  to  receive  sullage,  wastewater,  and  polluted  storm  water,  and  will  be  covered  to\nminimize the risk of direct human contact and environmental nuisance.\n\nc.\n\nEnvironmental Problems Associated with Construction Stage\n\n13.\nThe  construction  of  new  primary  roads  and  drains  under  previous  projects  frequently\ncreated  significant  and,  in  some  cases,  sustained  nuisance;  and  damaged  property,  due  to\ninundation  caused  by  blocked  drains  and  led  to  the  inevitable  nuisance  of  dust  and  noise  during\nconstruction.  Problems  are  attributed  to  a  combination  of  inexperienced  and  ill-equipped\ncontractors, insufficient and inadequately qualified staff assigned to supervise construction, and an\nunderdeveloped approach to the protection of the rights of residents in the Lao PDR. The Project is\ndesigned to ensure that the problems are not repeated.\n\n14.\nThe  construction  of  primary  drainage  channels  and  rehabilitation  of  existing  channels  will\ninevitably  produce  dust  and  noise  during  construction,  which  will  affect  workers  and  nearby\nresidents. There may be temporary stoppage or disturbance of storm water drainage, disruption of\nvehicular traffic, possible destruction of shrubs and trees, and disruption of access to residences\nand  businesses.  Careful  construction  planning  and  monitoring  measures  will  be  essential  to\nminimize impacts on traffic flows during construction and to reduce the nuisance to residents.\n\nd.\n\nEnvironmental Problems Resulting from Project Operations\n\n15.\nFull environmental benefits will be achieved only with adequate operation and maintenance\n(O&M) of the new road and drainage networks and of the VAI. Environmental problems will occur if\nthe need for maintenance and for training in O&M at all levels is ignored.\n\n\f3.\n\nMitigation Measures\n\n67\n\nAppendix 11, page 4\n\nMitigation  measures  to  ameliorate  any  negative  environmental  impacts  are  divided  into\n16.\nthose  that  are  associated  with  the  (i)  project  component  and  site  selection,  (ii)  its  design,  (iii)  its\nconstruction, (iv) its O&M, and (v) its decommissioning. The arrangements, to be put in place, will\nensure that the negative impacts are avoided or mitigated.\n\na.\n\nProject Selection and Location\n\n17.\nProject  components  avoid  areas  of  environmental  sensitivity  and  those  which  would\nnegatively  impact  on  cultural  heritage.  Project  sites  avoid  areas  where  there  are  geological  or\ntopographic problems, and where either groundwater or surface waters likely to be used by others\nwould  be  adversely  affected  by  the  project  components.  Nuisance  to  surrounding  areas  will  be\nlimited to the short term, and will be minimized through effective project management. Where land\nuse changes are likely to be induced by extensions to infrastructure, potential negative impacts will\nbe mitigated by improved urban planning and development control and enforcement capabilities of\nVUDAA,  through  the  capacity  building  component.  Where  livelihoods  or  personal  property  are\nthreatened by project activities, compensation will be provided in accordance with the resettlement\naction plan.\n\nb.\n\nProject Design\n\nProject  components  will  be  designed  to  minimize  destruction  of  the  natural  environment\n18.\n(such as tree cutting), the need for land acquisition and relocation of structures, and disturbance to\nexisting  residential  and  commercial  establishments.  Roads  are  designed  to  provide  adequate\ndrainage  both  for  the  roadway  and  the  surrounding  areas.  Drainage  is  designed  to  accept  both\nstorm water and, in some cases, sullage and/or settled wastewater and direct this to wetlands with\nadequate  absorptive  capacity.  Sanitation  component  is  designed  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  on-\nplot wastewater disposal systems, and the frequency and efficiency of septic tank sludge removal.\nThis  will  minimize  negative  environmental  impacts  from  inappropriate  methods  for  disposing  of\nexcreta.\n\nc.\n\nProject Construction\n\nArrangements  for  construction  management  will  ensure  that  the  negative  environmental\n19.\nimpacts  experienced  in  previous  urban  development  initiatives  will  be  avoided.  These  will  be\nachieved by (i) appointing of experienced and responsible contractors; (ii) including a training and\ncapacity  building  program  for  local  contractors,  focusing  on  efficient  project  management,  site\nsafety, etc.; (iii) assigning a sufficient number of suitably qualified staff to supervise construction;\n(iv) improving the construction management skills of the Implementing Agency VUDAA through the\ncapacity  building  program;  (v)  utilizing  community  contracting  procedures  for  the  VAI  schemes;\nand (vi) improving the complaints procedures by responding within a reasonable time to legitimate\npublic grievances.\n\nd.\n\nProject Operation and Maintenance\n\nProject components can prevent negative environmental impacts only if they are operated\n20.\ncorrectly and maintained regularly. This means that necessary technical skills, financial resources,\nand  O&M,  and  monitoring  systems  must  be  in  place.  The  capacity  building  component  of  the\nProject will provide training in O&M for technical staff of VUDAA. It will also build the capacity for\nvillage-level maintenance of tertiary-level infrastructure and services. Capacity building will also (i)\nincrease  the  capacity  of  VUDAA  to  implement  cost-recovery  schemes  and  mobilize  the  other\nresources necessary to pay for O&M of both the project assets and the existing infrastructure that\nis  under  VUDAA's  responsibility,  and  (ii)  establish  capacities  for  adequate  environmental\nmonitoring in the environment division of VUDAA.\n\n\fe.\n\nProject Demobilization\n\n68\n\nAppendix 11, page 5\n\nThe Project components are likely to remain in place until upgraded in the future. Thus no\n21.\nnegative  environmental  impacts  associated  with  project  demobilization  or  decommissioning  are\nanticipated.\n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring\n\n22.\nThe  Environmental  Law,  enacted  on  3  April  1999,  gives  overall  responsibility  for\nenvironmental  protection  to  the  Science,  Technology  and  Environment  Agency.  The  law  requires\nthat projects, which affect the environment, be subject to an environmental impact assessment for\nsubmission  to  the  concerned  environmental  agency  to  secure  an  environment  compliance\ncertificate  before  starting  the  project.  However,  many  regulations  and  guidelines  required  to\nsupport the law and to govern the preparation of the environmental impact assessments have yet\nto be prepared.\n\n23.\nEnvironmental  monitoring  within  the  Vientiane  urban  area  is  the  responsibility  of  VUDAA.\nUnder  the  Law,  VUDAA  is  to  establish  an  environmental  management  and  monitoring  unit  in\ncooperation with the Science, Technology, and Environment Agency. The duties of this unit include\n(i) preparing and implementing plans for environmental protection of the Vientiane urban area; (ii)\nmonitoring  and  controlling  the  implementation  of  environmental  legislative  instruments;  (iii)\nconducting research and identifying methods for environmental protection and restoration; and (iv)\ncollecting,  analyzing,  and  disseminating  information  on  the  environment  and  related  issues.  The\nunit  responsible  for  these  activities  within  VUDAA  is  the  Sanitation  and  Environment  Division,\nwhich is also responsible for solid waste collection and disposal, septic tank emptying, and street\ncleaning.  While  the  existing  staff  are  adequate  in  number  to  perform  this  mandate,  they  lack  the\nnecessary  skills.  The  capacity  building  component  of  the  Project  will  provide  training  both  in  the\nmanagement of environmental services and in monitoring environmental conditions in the broader\nsense.\n\nF. \n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\n24.\nThe  proposed  Project  aims  to  improve  environment  in  the  Vientiane  urban  area,  and  will\ncontribute significantly to improved living conditions and well-being of the urban poor. The risk to\nthe urban population, particularly the urban poor, of incurring infectious diseases through exposure\nto contaminated surface water will be low. In addition, the health risk and public nuisance caused\nby mosquitoes and flies will be reduced as a result of the reduction in suitable breeding areas for\ninfectious disease vectors. The air quality and public safety will be enhanced by the improved road\nnetwork and access to village areas.\n\n25.\nOn the basis of this initial evaluation, the Project is unlikely to result in any direct adverse\nenvironmental impacts. The identified adverse effects should be readily addressed through proper\nengineering design and incorporation of the identified mitigation measures. Adverse impacts relate\nalmost  entirely  to  the  construction  phase,  and  particular  attention  will  be  paid  to  ensuring  that\ncontractors comply with good engineering practice and avoid creating unnecessary inconvenience\nto  the  public.  Assuming  that  the  construction  process  is  well-managed,  the  short-term  negative\nimpacts of the Project will be far outweighed by the major positive impacts of an improved urban\nenvironment.\n\n\fECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL JUSTIFICATION\n\n69\n\nAppendix 12, page 7\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction\n\nThe subprojects in each subsector under the Project aim to improve the environment and\n1.\neconomic outcomes for the  community and to ensure that the urban poor participate in and gain\nfrom  the  Project.  Economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  and  financial  internal  rates  of  return\n(FIRRs), as appropriate, were estimated for the subprojects in each subsector in accordance with\nADB\u2019s  Framework  for  the  Economic  and  Financial  Appraisal  of  Urban  Development  Sector\nProjects. EIRRs were prepared for road and traffic management, storm water drainage, and village\narea  improvements  (VAI)  subprojects,  and  FIRR  for  solid  waste  management.  Economic\nevaluations  used  the  domestic  price  numeraire,  excluded  taxes,  and  used  an  opportunity  cost  of\nlabor of 0.5 for in-kind labor contribution by low-income households to VAI and a shadow exchange\nrate factor of 1.11 for traded items valued at border prices. Subprojects were generally assessed\nfor a period that included project implementation and 20 years of benefits, with allowance for the\nresidual  value  of  assets  at  the  end  of  the  evaluation  period.  The  evaluations  were  undertaken\nusing constant January 2001 prices, and took into account incremental operation and maintenance\n(O&M)  costs.  Subprojects  that  are  not  amenable  to  economic  or  financial  evaluation  were\nassessed in terms of cost-effectiveness.\n\nB. \n\nRoad Improvements\n\n2.\nTwenty-three  road  subprojects  are  proposed,  covering  construction  of  2.1  km  (kilometers)\nof new road and upgrading (widening and sealing) of 33.8 km of existing poor quality road, with a\ntotal  base  cost  of  $10.8  million.  Economic  evaluations  were  carried  out  for  seven  subprojects\ncovering  34  percent  of  the  total  length  of  the  road  subprojects  and  41  percent  of  their  total  cost.\nThe evaluated projects cover a typical mix of construction of new roads and upgrading of existing\nroads, and a mix of improvements to primary, secondary, and tertiary roads.\n\nThe  evaluation  of  the  upgrading  of  existing  roads  take  into  account  of  savings  in  vehicle\n3.\noperating costs (with distance-related vehicle operating costs expected to decline by an average of\n25 percent based on vehicle operating cost relationships in the highway design and maintenance\nroad evaluation model) and savings in personal travel time (using an average value of travel time\nof 50 percent of average personal income). A small amount of additional traffic is expected to use\nthe subproject roads after their improvement as reduced transport costs allow increased travel for\neconomic  and  social  purposes  and  as  traffic  diverts  from  neighboring  roads.  New  road  links  will\nimprove the connectivity of the road network and allow more direct travel instead of current more\ncircuitous  routes.  Accident  savings  are  also  expected,  but  are  difficult  to  quantify  and  were  not\nincluded in the evaluations.\n\n4.\nThe number of registered vehicles in Vientiane Prefecture has risen by an average of 6.7\npercent  per  annum  for  1980-1999  (7.8  percent  per  annum  for  1989-1999).  The  forecast  average\ntraffic growth of 5 percent per annum used for the evaluation period allows for a decline in the rate\nof  traffic  growth  over  time  and  for  lower  traffic  growth  in  the  central  part  of  the  urban  area  in\nresponse  to  increasing  congestion  over  time.  Traffic  growth  of  5  percent  is  also  consistent  with\nhistoric  national  evidence  that  a  10  percent  growth  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  results  in  a\nvehicle fleet growth of 13 percent for light vehicles, 11 percent for heavy vehicles, and 20 percent\nfor  motorcycles.  The  elasticity  of  demand  for  travel  with  respect  to  income  is  higher  for  lower\nincome groups, suggesting that a combination of economic growth and provision of road capacity\nwill support the mobility needs of the poor.\n\n5.\nThe  full  future  cost  of  maintaining  road  subprojects  was  included  in  the  evaluations,\nalthough  it  overstates  the  incremental  cost  that  will  result  from  the  subprojects  because  current,\nalbeit  deficient  maintenance  expenditure  will  be  avoided.  The  evaluations  (Table  A12.1  indicate\nthat (i) the overall EIRR for the projects assessed is 24.2 percent (range of 12 - 41 percent); (ii) the\nlowest  return  for  an  individual  project  is  from  the  construction  of  a  new  section  of  road  (Project\nR101b),  which  is  more  difficult  to  assess  and  may  not  fully  reflect  the  benefits  of  the  road  in  the\ncontext  of  the  road  network  as  a  whole;  (iii)  the  subprojects  are  robust  with  respect  to  a\ncombination of higher costs and lower and delayed benefits (e.g., with the EIRR for the assessed\n\n\fTable A12.1: Economic Evaluation of Road Subprojects\n\nEIRR\n(%)\n\nFinancial\nCosta\n(KN million,\nJan 2001\nprices)\n\nNPV (KN\nmillion,\nJan\n2001\nprices)\n\nCase 1\n(Costs\n+15%)\n\nCase 2\n(Benefit\n -15%)\n\nCase 3\n(Delayed\nBenefits 1\nyear)\n\nSensitivity Tests (EIRR, %)\nCase 5\n(Traffic\nGrowth\n+50%)\n\nCase 6\n(Traffic\nGrowth\n-50%)\n\nCase 4\n(combination of\nCases 1, 2,\nand 3)\n\nR101a Upgrading P3\nRoad\nR101b Construction\n\n7,269\n\n8,755\n\n30.2\n\n26.7\n\n3,912\n\n93\n\n12.4\n\n10.6\n\n26.2\n\n10.3\n\n35.9\n\n14.3\n\n20.2\n\n24.8\n\n11.0\n\n32.4\n\n14.7\n\n19.8\n\n19.6\n\n7.8\n\n26.0\n\n10.9\n\n15.4\n\n35.3\n\n16.1\n\n47.4\n\n20.8\n\n27.9\n\n23.1\n\n7.7\n\n32.6\n\n11.5\n\n17.3\n\n2,142\n\n4,387\n\n41.4\n\n36.6\n\n3,752\n\n1,062\n\n16.8\n\n14.6\n\n17,257\n\n12,406\n\n23.4\n\n20.6\n\nCase 8\n(Switching\nValue: Rise\nin Cost)\n\nCase 9\n(Switching\nValue: Decr.\nIn Benefits)\n\nCase 7\n(Excl.

It is proposed that street lighting be installed along 18 kilometers of the 102\nkm  of  primary  and  secondary  road  in  the  urban  area,  at  a  base  cost  of  $0.84  million.  Allowing  for\ncapital and O&M costs and the opportunity cost of capital, the total annual cost of public lighting will\nbe  equivalent  to  $150,000  per  year.  Street  lighting  is  a  public  good  with  substantial  benefits  for  the\ncommunity,  including  (i)  a  decline  in  the  number  and  severity  of  road  vehicle  accidents,  especially\nthose  involving  pedestrians;  (ii)  reduced  travel  time  and  vehicle  operating  costs  for  motorists;  (iii)\nfewer  accidents,  greater  convenience,  and  enhanced  personal  security  of  pedestrians  using\nfootpaths; and (iv) increased opportunity for social and business activity.\n\nAvailable  data  is  insufficient  for  an  economic  evaluation  of  the  proposed  street  lighting\n2.\nprogram.  However,  the  benefits  of  street  lighting  and  its  current  limited  presence  mean  that  the\nmarginal benefit to be gained from its provision is greater than would be the case were the project to\ninvolve extension of a more extensive current system. The benefit of the street lighting program will\nbe  maximized  by  determining  the  locations  where  lights  are  to  be  installed  during  project\nimplementation,  using  a  multicriteria  assessment  of  all  primary  and  secondary  roads  that  takes\naccount  of  (i) the quantity of traffic  using each road, (ii) the number of  traffic accidents, and (iii)  the\nquality of footpaths on the roads.\n\n3.\nThe  Vientiane  Urban  Development  and  Administration  Authority  (VUDAA)  is  to  collect  a\nsurcharge on electricity accounts to meet the cost of public lighting. The surcharge is currently set at\nKN1,000 per electricity meter per month, which is 0.3 percent of the 25th percentile household income.\nPractices such as sharing of electricity between several poor households or poor households drawing\non  power  from  a  better-off  neighbor  will  temper  the  effect  of  the  surcharge  on  the  poor.  Financial\nforecasts  for  VUDAA  has  made  allowances  for  the  cost  of  maintaining  and  operating  the  public\nlighting, and for increases in the rate of the electricity surcharge to cover the cost of public lighting.\n\nb. \n\nTraffic Signals, Signage, and Safety Awareness\n\n4.\nThe traffic management strategy, which will involve installation of traffic signals, traffic signs,\nand  road  marking,  and  improved  traffic  safety  awareness,  responds  to  traffic  growth,  poor  traffic\nmanagement,  and  deteriorating  road  safety  in  Vientiane.  The  benefits  of  the  strategy  will  be  (i)\nreduced  number  and  severity  of  road  accidents,  (ii)  reduced  vehicle  operating  costs  resulting  from\nimproved  traffic  flow,  and  (iii)  increased  capacity  of  the  road  system.  The  accident  rate  in  Vientiane\nhas been rising, with the number of fatalities growing from an average annual rate of 4.8 per 10,000\nvehicles in 1980-1984 to 8.0, 11.8, and 12.5 in subsequent five-year periods (and 10.2 in 1999). The\nnumber  of  accidents  resulting  in  injuries  has  risen  at  a  faster  rate.  Over  the  decade  to  1999,  the\nnumber of deaths and fatalities rose at 120 percent of the rate of growth in the number of registered\nvehicles.  The  recent  average  death  rate  of  12.5  per  10,000  vehicles  in  Vientiane  is  high  compared\nwith that in other countries (in 1997 national road deaths per 10,000 vehicles were 11.8 in Indonesia,\n8.5 in Thailand, 2.3 in Australia, and 1.6 in Japan, with death rates in urban areas typically about a\nquarter  lower  than  these  national  rates).  Traffic  accidents  in  Vientiane  are  concentrated  in  certain\nareas (for  example,  33 of the 106 deaths in 1999   occurred   at   13  intersections),  which should be\nthe focus of traffic management strategy. During project implementation, the benefits of the strategy\nwill be maximized by assessing the entire road network and prioritizing the location of measures on\nthe basis of the quantity of traffic and the number of accidents.\n\n\fAppendix 12, page 7\n\nD.\n\nStorm Water Drainage\n\n72\n\nTen  subprojects  are  proposed  to  upgrade  and  extend  the  drainage  system,  involving\n5.\nupgrading and construction of 5.8 km of primary drains and 8.2 km of secondary drains at a base cost\nof  $6.53  million.  These  projects  will  reduce  the  incidence  of  flooding  in  a  catchment  area  of  1,050\nhectares having a population of 60,100. Economic evaluation was prepared for the entire storm water\ndrainage component because linkages between drains result in benefits that are not always discrete\nto an individual subproject. A guide to the relative performance of the subprojects is provided with an\nevaluation for each of the subprojects, with the benefits of the entire component allocated to each of\nthe subprojects. The benefits valued in the economic evaluation include reduced damage to buildings\nand their contents in the areas subject to flooding at present. The savings are estimated at an annual\naverage of 1 percent of the value of property, which surveys indicate has an average value of KN1.4\nbillion (equal to $1,720) per hectare of the affected area per year. The unit savings are consistent with\nbenefits estimated for previous drainage projects in Vientiane allowing for a rise in the real value of\nthe  savings  to  reflect  densification  of  population,  upgrading  of  buildings,  and  increased  value  of\nbuilding contents that are susceptible to flood damage. Allowance is made for the unit benefit to rise\nby 5 percent per annum in the future in line with the forecast growth in GDP per capita.\n\n6.\nThe  economic  evaluations  (Table  A12.2),  which  also  take  into  account  incremental\nmaintenance costs, indicate that (i) the overall EIRR for the projects assessed is 11.9 percent (range\nof 6 - 29 percent for individual subprojects); (ii) the lowest return for an individual project is from the\nconstruction  of  a  short  section  of  drain  to  serve  a  small  village  (Project  D202),  which  does  not  fully\nreflect  the  benefits  gained  by  improved  connectivity  of  the  drainage  network;  (iii)  the  overall  EIRR\ncould fall to about 7 percent with a combination of adverse circumstances (cases 4 and 5); and (iv)\nthe drainage component would need a decline in costs of 1 percent or a rise in benefits of 1 percent to\nachieve an EIRR of 12 percent.\n\n7.\nThe  drainage  subprojects  will  generate  additional  benefits  that  are  difficult  to  quantify:  (i)\nreduced  damage  to  motor  vehicles  and  public  infrastructure  such  as  roads;  (ii)  reduced  loss  of\npersonal income when employment is disrupted; (iii) improved conditions with avoidance of flooding of\nsanitary  systems  and  spread  of  raw  and  partially  treated  sewage  and  sullage  with  rainwater  into\nresidential  areas;  and  (iv)  reduced  disruption  to  individual  and  community  life  caused  by  slow\nwithdrawal  of  storm  water.  These  benefits  will  ensure  that  the  overall  economic  benefit  of  the\ncomponent  is  higher  than  that  shown  in  Table  A12.2.  The  drainage  subprojects  will  be  especially\nbeneficial to the poor, who are more likely to live in low-lying land that is more subject to flooding.\n\n8.\nThe  willingness  of  residents  of  flood-affected  areas  to  contribute  to  the  cost  of  the  drainage\ncomponent to avoid future flood damage is clouded by low income, short time horizons, and limited\nexperience  with  beneficiary  charges.  Improved  drainage  is,  however,  recognized  as  important,  and\nwas the highest ranked need, identified by interviewed residents of villages. The savings in damage to\nbuildings and contents estimated in the economic evaluation are equal to 4.0 percent of the estimated\naverage household income of people.\n\nE.\n\nSolid Waste Management\n\nThe   solid   waste   component     involves    the   provision    of   additional  collection  trucks,\n9.\nbins,   and    equipment,   which will   serve  about  16,000  people. A  financial  evaluation,  using  an\nevaluation  period  of  12  years  of  benefits   (the  expected  life  of  the  investment)  and  taking\naccount        of        incremental          O  &      M        costs    and    incremental    revenue    from    user    charges,\nindicates an   FIRR   of   13.4   percent.  The  project  will  have  a  FIRR  of  at  least  12   percent  if\ncosts should  rise  by  up  to  6   percent,   or   benefits   should   decline    by   up  to  6  percent.  The\nsecurity        of        the      benefits        is        high        as        the    Project    will      enable      services      to    be\ncontinued    to      an     existing area  where  services  will   otherwise   be   withdrawn  due\n\n\fTable A12.2: Economic Evaluation of Storm Water Drainage Subprojects\n\n(property damage savings only)\n\nFinancial Costa\n(KN million,\nJan 2001 prices)\n\nEIRR\n(%)\n\nNPV (KN\nmillion,\nJan 2001\nprices)\n\nCase 1\n(Costs\n+15%)\n\nCase 2\n(Benefit\n-15%)\n\nSensitivity Tests (EIRR, %)\n\nCase 4\n(combination\nof cases\n1, 2, and 3)\n\nCase 5\n(Halve\ngrowth in\nbenefits)\n\nCase 6\n(switching\nvalue: rise\nin cost)\n\nCase 7\n(switching\nvalue: decr.\nin benefits)\n\n16,617\n\n657\n\n12.7\n\n10.7\n\n10.4\n\n7.0\n\n-13.0\n\nDrain\n\nD101 Rehab.
