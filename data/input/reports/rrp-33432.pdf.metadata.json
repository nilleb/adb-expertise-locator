It  combines  physical\ninfrastructure and service improvements with interventions for\ndecentralized urban governance and extensive capacity building\nfor the Vientiane Urban Development Administration Authority\n(VUDAA).  Physical  investments  consist  of  improvements  to\ndrainage,  roads,  traffic  management  and  safety,  solid  waste\nmanagement, and sanitation. The Project incorporates a social\nstrategy to ensure active participation of the urban communities\nin project implementation and effective targeting of the poor and\nvulnerable. The project area covers a hundred urban villages\nwith about 162,000 residents within Vientiane and falls under\nthe jurisdiction of VUDAA.\nClassification Thematic: Human development, good governance\nEnvironment Assessment Category B\nAn  initial  environmental  examination  was  undertaken;  its\nsummary is a core appendix.\nRationale Current  deficiencies  in  urban  infrastructure  and  services  in\nVientiane impede economic growth and undermine the quality\nof  life  of  the  urban  residents,  especially  the  poor.  Despite\nrecent investments in primary road and drainage networks, the\npoor  condition  of  secondary  and  tertiary  infrastructure\nconstrains  the  full  potential  of  and  benefits  from  recent\nimprovements  to  primary  infrastructure  and  services.  The\ninadequate infrastructure and services at community level have\na  particularly  adverse  impact  on  the  lives  of  the  poor,  the\nmajority of whom live in low-lying land, flooded for most of the\nyear. Further constraints to sustained growth and enhanced\nquality of life of the residents are the present urban institutional\nframework  and  nascent  urban  management  that  are  still\nevolving in the process of ongoing reforms for decentralization.\nWhile  considerable  progress  has  been  made  toward\ndecentralized urban governance and development of VUDAA\nas  a  new  entity  responsible  for  urban  management  in\nVientiane, the extent of further reforms needed to fully achieve\ndecentralized urban governance requires extensive and long-\nterm support. There is need at this stage to shift the focus of\nefforts to secondary and tertiary infrastructure and services to\nensure  that  environmental  improvements  are  felt  by  all,\nespecially the poor. Equally important is further progress in the\ndecentralization  process  and  development  of  VUDAA  with\nadequate  management  systems  and  skills  and  financial\nresources.", "ii\nObjectives and Scope The Project aims to improve the quality of life of the urban\nresidents, especially the poor, and enhance urban productivity\nand economic growth in the Vientiane urban area. To this end,\nthe  Project  has  two  specific  objectives:  (i)  to  support\ndecentralization  and  urban  governance  reforms  and  the\nprocess  toward  an  autonomous,  well-functioning,  and  self-\nsufficient urban local government that is capable of planning,\nmanaging,  and  financing  urban  development  and  providing\nservices in a sustainable manner; and (ii) to target investments\nin infrastructure and services to maximize the utility of existing\ninfrastructure by closing the remaining gaps and focusing on\nsecondary- and tertiary-level infrastructure and services. The\nProject represents Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB's) second\ninvestment in the Vientiane urban area, and builds on lessons\nlearned  from  the  experience  of  the  first  intervention,  the\nVientiane Integrated Urban Development Project.\nThe  Project  components  follow:  (i)  part  A:  citywide  urban\ninfrastructure and services, comprising critical missing links of\nprimary  and  secondary  roads  and  drainage,  efficiency\nimprovements in solid waste management, traffic management\nand  safety,  and  institutional  infrastructure  and  maintenance\nimprovements;  (ii)  part  B:  village  area  improvements  (VAI),\nadopting a demand-led and participatory approach, seeking as\na  prerequisite  the  willingness  of  village  communities  to\nparticipate in and contribute to a portion of the cost of the\nimprovements,  and  combining  community  infrastructure  and\nservices with community-level capacity building and awareness\nraising in environmental health, participatory local planning and\ncommunity-based  infrastructure  development  and  service\ndelivery; and (iii) part C: a comprehensive capacity building\nprogram to support the accomplishment of the urban policy and\ninstitutional  reform  agenda,  and  enhance  the  planning,\noperation and maintenance, revenue mobilization, and financial\nmanagement capabilities of VUDAA.\nCost Estimates The project cost is estimated at $37.0 million equivalent, of which\n$20.0  million  is  the  foreign  currency  cost  and  $17.0  million\nequivalent is the local currency cost.\nFinancing Plan    ($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total Percent\nExchange Currency Cost\nAsian Development Bank 16.5 8.5 25.0 67\nGovernment 0.0 7.2 7.2 20\nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de  3.5 0.9 4.4 12\nD\u00e9veloppement\nCommunity 0.0 0.4 0.4 1\nTotal 20.0 17.0 37.0 100", "iii\nLoan Amount and Terms A  loan  in  the  amount  of  SDR  20,023,000  ($25.0  million\nequivalent) in various currencies from the ADB's Special Funds\nresources will be provided for a term of 32 years, including a\ngrace period of 8 years, and with an interest rate of 1.0 percent\nper annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum\nthereafter.\nRelending Terms VUDAA will contribute $2.9 million to the Project cost through\na  subloan  from  the  Government  using  the  ADB  loan\nproceeds.  The  subloan  will  have  an  interest  rate  of  6.7\npercent  per  annum  and  a  repayment  period  of  15  years\nfollowing completion of the Project, including an initial grace\nperiod of 3 years. The Government and VUDAA will enter into\na subsidiary loan agreement. VUDAA's financing will cover\n100  percent  of  the  costs  of  maintenance  equipment  and\ninvestment in solid waste, and 10 percent of the cost of the\nurban infrastructure and services, except traffic management\nand  safety  to  be  financed  by  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de\nD\u00e9veloppement (AFD), and VAI, to which the community will\nmake a contribution of 10 percent.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 28 February 2007\nExecuting Agency The Executing Agency for the Project will be the Vientiane\nPrefecture (the provincial government of Vientiane City). A\nproject steering committee to be chaired by the president of\nVUDAA  and  with  representatives  from  the  ministries  of\nfinance, communication, transport, posts, and construction,\nand justice and the committee for planning and cooperation,\nand the Prime Minister's office will be formed to oversee the\nProject.\nImplementation Arrangements VUDAA will be the implementing agency, with responsibility\nfor  planning  and  implementing  urban  infrastructure  and\nservices  (parts  A  and  B)  and  capacity  building  (part  C).\nVillages will play a major role in planning, implementing, and\noperating and maintaining the VAI component. A combined\nproject management and implementation unit (PIMU), to be\nheaded by a project director, will be set up within VUDAA.\nThe project director will be assisted by two deputy project\ndirectors  responsible  for  urban  infrastructure  and  service\nimprovements  and  capacity  building  components\nrespectively.  PIMU  will  also  have  an  accounting  and\nadministration unit to manage procurement and loan account\nadministration.  PIMU  will  be  responsible  for  project\npreparation, programming, budgeting and financial planning,\ndetailed  engineering  design,  tendering  and  construction\nsupervision,  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities,\nsocioeconomic  and  engineering  surveys;  environmental\nassessment  and  protection;  and  community  participation,\ncapacity building, and execution of the policy and institutional\nreform agenda.", "iv\nProcurement Procurement will be carried out by VUDAA following ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement. International competitive bidding\n(ICB) procedures will be used for major civil works contracts\nestimated to cost over $1.0 million and for supply contracts\nestimated to cost over $500,000. For civil works costing up to\n$1.0 million, local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures will\nbe  used.  The  package  of  work  per  village  under  the  VAI\ncomponent  is  relatively  small,  ranging  from  $30,000  to\n$100,000. The works are labor-intensive and do not require\nsophisticated technologies. Therefore, for works estimated to\ncost  less  than  $50,000  and  where  the  capacity  of  the\ncommunity to undertake the works is adequate, community\nparticipation in procurement will be applied.\nConsulting Services  Consultants under the loan will be selected and engaged in\naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants\nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging\ndomestic consultants. A team of consultants with a total input\nof 270 person-months (76 international and 194 domestic) will\nassist PIMU in overall project implementation management,\ndetailed  engineering  design,  construction  supervision,\ndemand-led VAI, and developing legal and financial reforms\nfor  decentralized  governance.  Additionally,  domestic\nconsultants  will  be  required  to  assist  in  community\npreparation  and  awareness  program  and  construction\nsupervision.  A  further  191  person-months  of  consultancy\ninputs, including 173 (65 international and 108 domestic) for\ncapacity building and 18 (5 international and 13 domestic) for\ntraffic  management  and  safety  components  will  also  be\nprovided with parallel financing by AFD.\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date 31 August 2006\nProject Benefits\nand Beneficiaries The Project will benefit about 162,000 urban residents, 18\npercent of whom belong to low-income groups. The overall\npopulation will benefit from the Project directly or indirectly\nthrough  the  upgraded  roads,  improved  traffic  and  safety\nconditions,  and  enhanced  urban  management  capacities\nwithin  VUDAA,  leading  to  sustainable  delivery  of  urban\nservices. The Project will directly improve the living conditions\nof  81,000  residents  of  the  Vientiane  urban  area  through\nimproved community infrastructure and services under VAI, a\npartially  coincident  60,000  people  through  drainage\nimprovements,  and  50,000  people  through  improved  solid\nwaste collection and disposal. The Project will promote good\ngovernance  by  supporting  decentralized  urban  governance\nand empowering village communities in local planning, project\nimplementation,  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  urban\ninfrastructure and services.", "", "I. THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Vientiane Urban Infrastructure\nand Services Project.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. In response to a request from the Government, the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\nprovided technical assistance (TA)1 to prepare a project to improve the urban environment in\nVientiane and support the Government's reforms for a decentralized form of urban governance.\nA Loan Appraisal Mission2 from ADB visited the Lao PDR during 19 April - 2 May 2001 and\nreached an understanding with the Government on the proposed project scope, estimated cost,\nfinancing and implementation arrangements, and the policy and institutional reform agenda to\nbe implemented in conjunction with the Project. This report is based on the reports prepared by\nTA  consultants  using  participatory  approaches,  the  Mission's  discussions  and  consultative\nmeetings with stakeholders, and understanding with central and provincial governments and the\nVientiane Urban Development Administration Authority (VUDAA), the implementing agency for\nthe proposed Project. The project framework is presented in Appendix 1.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA. The Urban Sector\n3. With a per capita income of about $300, the Lao PDR is one of the least developed\ncountries in Asia. Poverty incidence is estimated at 38.6 percent. The United Nations human\ndevelopment index places the country in the bottom fifth of the world's nations. The country is\nessentially rural, but since the mid-1980s the expanded marketing and commercial opportunities\nfollowing economic liberalization stimulated urban growth. As a result, growing numbers of rural\npeople were drawn to the urban areas in search of better livelihoods. The present urban\npopulation of 0.85 million, which represents 17 percent of the total, is estimated to increase by\nmore than 50 percent over the next 10 years. Although the economy is largely rural, with\nagriculture accounting for some 50 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), the role of the\nurban sector is growing. During 1996-1998 the industry and services sector components of GDP\nincreased at average annual rates of 11.5 and 7.2 percent, respectively, compared with 4.3\npercent for agriculture, implying the productivity and associated opportunities in urban areas.\n4. Vientiane, the capital city of the Lao PDR, is by far the largest urban area. The current\npopulation of the Vientiane urban area3 is estimated at 162,000, while the greater Vientiane\nurban area,4 within the boundaries of the master plan, has a population of 325,000 and is\ngrowing at a rate of 3.3 percent per annum. Four major provincial capitals with populations\nranging from 20,000 to 60,000 are classified as secondary towns. The remaining provincial\n                                                \n1  TA 3333-LAO: Vientiane Urban Infrastructure and Services Project for $600,000, approved 10 December 1999.\n2  The Mission comprised G. Cezayirli, Senior Urban Development Specialist/Mission Leader; T. Kanazawa, Senior\nProject Engineer (23-30 April 2001); R. O'Sullivan, Counsel (24-30 April 2001); and D. Bray, Urban Economist\nand Finance Specialist/Staff consultant (20 -26 April 2001).\n3  The  Vientiane  urban  area,  covering  100  contiguous  villages  with  urban  character  within  Vientiane,  was\ndesignated in 1995 as the urban area where VUDAA is responsible for planning, infrastructure development, and\nservice delivery. VUDAA's responsibility for solid waste management, however, goes beyond 100 villages, and\ncovers all 189 villages within the Vientiane master plan boundaries.\n4  The greater Vientiane area within the master plan boundaries covers, in addition to Vientiane urban area, the\nperipheral areas where urban expansion is taking place and includes 189 villages in seven districts. ", "2\ncapitals and some district centers with urban characteristics have populations between 5,000\nand 20,000. The primacy of Vientiane in the urbanization process is marked and is expected to\ncontinue. The government sector, and commerce and trade, employing over 50 percent of the\nlabor force, dominate the city\u2019s economy. Virtually all domestic and export earning industrial\nproduction takes place in Vientiane. Tourism is also a high-growth sector, as the city is a focus\nof tourism promotion and is on one of the emerging tourism circuits in the region. The role and\ndevelopment potential of Vientiane is reinforced by its strategic location as the gateway to the\ncentral part of the country in the Greater Mekong subregion (GMS), and on the route of land\nbridges linking Thailand with the People's Republic of China and Vietnam. Vientiane is expected\nto become an important center for distribution, and logistic activities and higher value production\nrelated to GMS cooperation. It is estimated that GDP associated with the city rose by 10 percent\nbetween 1998-1999 and 1999-2000.\n1. Urban Environment and Infrastructure and Services\n5. While infrastructure and services in Vientiane have improved significantly over the last\nfive years with major investments in primary roads and drainage funded by ADB,5 other funding\nagencies, and the Government, a focus on primary infrastructure constrained the ability of the\nnewly constructed infrastructure to realize its full potential benefits. There remains a need for\nfurther development to (i) maximize the utility of the existing primary networks and allow a\ngreater share of population, especially the poor, to benefit from environmental improvements;\nand (ii) control future environmental degradation. Storm-water drainage is the key infrastructure\ndevelopment  issue.  Flooding  continues  to  occur  away  from  the  main  drainage  network\ndeveloped with recent investments, and stagnant polluted wastewater still lies in open roadside\nchannels because the primary network is incomplete and the secondary and tertiary networks\nare largely unimproved. There are almost 300 kilometers (km) of drainage channels within the\nurban area, of which about 162 km are either in poor or very poor condition. Moreover, lack of\nroutine  cleaning,  maintenance,  and  rehabilitation  constrains  the  proper  functioning  of  the\nexisting systems.\n6. The impact of poor sanitation on the city as a whole is significant in terms of potential\nhealth risks. There is no sewerage system, and sanitation is primarily through on-site facilities. A\nseptage disposal and treatment facility was constructed and maintenance systems initiated with\nADB assistance. While 74 percent of the urban households have access to on-site sanitation\nfacilities,  these  facilities  are  generally  poorly  designed  and  constructed,  and  perform\ninadequately. Moreover, the prevailing methods and frequency for treatment and disposal of\nwastewater are inadequate. A flat terrain, high water table, and low soil permeability exacerbate\nthe problems with the present system of on-site sanitation, resulting in failure of the systems,\noverflow of effluent, and pollution of surface waters and drains. It is common practice to dispose\nof  sullage  in  surface  drains  and  drainage  channels.  The  storm-water  drainage  system  is\ngenerally contaminated by wastewater that ends up in wetlands and marshes, contributing\nfurther  to  environmental  degradation.  Lack  of  an  effective  system  for  maintenance  and\nenforcement of sanitation regulations compounds these problems.\n7. Solid waste collection coverage and disposal have improved with recent investments in\nequipment, construction of a workshop, and development of a landfill disposal site. However,\nhalf of the urban population, especially those in low-income areas where there is no vehicular\naccess, is not covered by the system. Inadequate solid waste management also hinders the\nproper functioning of the drainage system. The operational and management efficiency of the\n                                                \n5  Loan 1362-LAO: Vientiane Integrated Urban Development Project, for $20 million, approved on 17 August 1995.", "3\nsolid waste collection and disposal service is currently low and requires further improvements to\nrealize the full potential of the system.\n8. Of the approximately 300 km of roads within the Vientiane urban area, only one third are\npaved.  The  remaining  roads,  which  are  mainly  earth  or  gravel,  are  in  poor  condition.\nConsequently, large volumes of mud are carried by vehicles onto newly constructed primary\nroads especially during the monsoon period. This compounds inadequate maintenance and\naccelerates deterioration of the roads. The growing use of motorized vehicles on unpaved roads\ncontributes to respiratory problems caused by suspended particulate matter. Tertiary roads,\nwhich account for almost half of the road network, are usually impassable to vehicles after\nheavy rainfall. Very few roads are adequately lit, contributing to traffic accidents and personal\ninsecurity at night. The standards for road discipline and traffic management are poor. There is\na high incidence of traffic accidents with road casualties at alarming levels. During 1995-1999,\nfatalities per year averaged 12.5 per 10,000 registered vehicles, which is markedly higher than\nthe figures for other countries in the region.\n2. Urban Poverty\n9. A participatory poverty assessment, conducted under the TA for preparing the Project,\nsuggests that 18 percent of the city's households can be classified as poor6, including 3 percent\nwho belong to the poorest groups where individual cash income may be only $8 per month.\nUnlike other cities in the region, where the poor reside in well-defined slum areas, the poor in\nVientiane are distributed throughout the city in heterogeneous urban communities where they\noften live adjacent to properties of higher income families. There is considerable diversity in the\nconditions and requirements of the poor, and a gradation of services and infrastructure is\nrequired to meet the specific needs of and levels of affordability to various groups of the poor.\nThe vast majority of the poor live in low-lying wetland areas, which are flooded for most of the\nyear, and where water can reach depths of over a meter during the wet season. These areas\nare acutely underserviced, links from dwellings to access roads are via difficult routes, and in\nmost cases, are via narrow timber planks balanced above contaminated floodwater. The poor\ndo not have access to a typical range of sanitation options. Conditions are unhygienic, water-\nand feces-borne diseases are highly prevalent, and many elderly people are trapped in their\nhouses during rainy season. Flooding also hinders subsistence economic activities such as\ngrowing vegetables and raising small livestock, risking the food security of the poor. There is\nvirtually no practice of household or community management of solid waste. The participatory\npoverty  assessment  reveals  that  the  problems  most  frequently  identified  by  the  poor  are\ndrainage, poor access roads, uncollected rubbish, and sanitation.\n10. The  service  deficiencies  in  these  areas  are  inextricably  linked,  exacerbating\nenvironmental  conditions.  Sanitation  problems  are  compounded  by  constant  flooding.  The\ntendency of the poor to ignore proper solid waste disposal is linked to lack of access to roads.\nLack of adequate land for the construction of better sanitary disposal of human waste and lack\nof access to septic tank disposal limit the options to upgrade services. An integrated approach\nto improvements in these areas is essential and a package of service improvements must be\ndeveloped to address the specific needs in each locality.\n                                                \n6 The participatory poverty assessment categorized poor families on the basis of income levels and other indicators\n(assets, eating habits, access to services, etc.). The assessment indicated that 18 percent of the households within\nthe Vientiane urban area fall into the lowest two poverty categories, with an income of less than KN150,000. This is\nclose to the poverty incidence rate of 16.7 percent determined for the Vientiane urban area by Lao Expenditure and\nConsumption Survey based on the equivalent income needed to purchase 2,100 calories per person per day plus\nsome expenditure for nonfood items.", "4\n11. Lack of access to land and shelter is also an issue among the poor in Vientiane. While\nthere is no clear evidence of squatters occupying private or state land illegally, about 10 percent\nof the population is estimated to rent their shelter from other private property owners. The issue\nof land and shelter is aggravated by a land gentrification process associated with the lack of\nformal land use rights in the Lao PDR and uncontrolled development, whereby the non-poor\ninfringe upon marginal areas where the poor live. It is important that the Government's program\nfor land titling be completed, and uncontrolled development prevented with effective urban\nplanning and development control.\n3. Built-Up Environment\n12. The Vientiane urban area is growing in an unplanned manner. While the city has a\nmaster plan, a zoning system, and development control procedures, supported by a Planning\nLaw, the system in its current form and operation has limited impact on urban development, and\nhas failed to guide growth. The master plan, approved in 1992 and revised recently, cannot\nmanage contemporary urban growth in the absence of a program approach and local area plans\nthat provide a clear basis for building control. There is no policy at present for a number of large\nopen spaces that have the potential to develop in a haphazard manner. The master plan does\nnot include a strategy to protect the unique cultural heritage in the central part of Vientiane that\nis  threatened  by  uncontrolled  development.  In  addition,  the  revised  master  plan  allows\nconversion  of  a  number  of  wetlands,  which  function  as  natural  flood  retention  basins,  to\nresidential use. There is an urgent need for a program of plans to address these issues and\nensure that development in Vientiane is environmentally and culturally sustainable and that the\nremaining vacant land in the city's urban fabric is used appropriately and efficiently.\n13. Further, the master plan, prepared under the centralized planning system, prevailing\nuntil recently, lacks ownership by the urban stakeholders, including VUDAA that is responsible\nfor implementing the plan. While VUDAA is now empowered to undertake local planning and\ncontrol development and building construction in the Vientiane urban area, its current capacity\nto do so is inadequate. The effective implementation of the plan is further constrained by the\nexisting  zoning  system  and  regulations  that  are  too  complex  to  be  implemented  by  an\norganization like VUDAA with little capacity to enforce zoning and regulations.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n1. Major Policy Principles\n14. The  Government  recognizes  the  significance  of  the  urban  areas  in  the  national\ndevelopment process and has included urban development as an investment line in its public\ninvestment program. In the context of its policy for raising living standards in rural areas, the\nGovernment is also concerned with the complementary and supportive role of urban centers in\nrural development. The investment program for 2000-2003 emphasizes strengthening urban-\nrural linkages by adopting appropriate urban development strategies whereby the role of urban\nareas as market and service centers for the rural population and products is enhanced to\nachieve broad-based development.\n15. The  Government  reconfirmed  poverty  reduction  as  its  overarching  objective  in  the\nSeventh Round Table Meeting (RTM) held in November 2000. In the longer term, the objective\nis to graduate, by 2020, from the group of least developed countries. In the short term, the\ngovernor of Vientiane has made it a key development objective to eradicate urban poverty in\nVientiane  by  the  year  2005.  The  Government  recognizes  the  need  for  (i)  deepening  its\nunderstanding of the extent and nature of poverty, (ii) developing and adopting a coherent", "5\nframework  as  basis  for  investments  in  poverty  reduction,  and  (iii)  continued  monitoring  of\npoverty and its impact. In a recent policy address, the governor stated that the three key\nstrategies to combat poverty are providing adequate and reasonable quality of living space,\nlivelihood, and education for the poor. A poverty reduction committee, to be chaired by the\ngovernor, is being formed to prepare an action plan and monitor efforts for poverty reduction in\nVientiane.\n16. Increasing  urbanization  led  to  the  recognition  of  the  need  for  enhanced  urban\nmanagement  that  could  be  achieved  with  decentralized  urban  administration.  Gradual\ndecentralization has been a key element of the Government's urban sector policy since 1995. In\nthe Seventh RTM, the Government reaffirmed its commitment to decentralization and local\ngovernance reform initiatives in urban areas, redefining the role and culture of the Government,\nand rationalization of central-local relations. In addition to the roles of provinces and districts,\nthe roles of villages are underlined as the lowest levels of Government located in the proximity\nof urban communities and an important point of interface between the community and the\nGovernment.  Villages  are  envisaged  to  play  an  important  role  in  planning  and  monitoring\ndevelopment  activities  to  ensure  that  development  is  equitable  and  participatory.\nDecentralization is, therefore, viewed as both a means for effective urban management and as\nan important strategy for poverty reduction. The Government considers capacity building and\nhuman  resource  development  as  the  major  challenge  and  priority  in  the  process  of\ndecentralization.\n2. Urban Governance and Finance in Transition\n17. Urban governance in the Lao PDR has undergone a major transition over the last five\nyears. Until recently the country did not have a distinct and decentralized system of urban\nadministration. The Ministry of Communication, Transport, Posts, and Construction (MCTPC),\nthrough its provincial and prefectural departments, was responsible for urban planning and\nmanagement along with its responsibility for rural areas. Public sector investment in urban areas\nwas  financed  entirely  through  the  annual  budget  allocations  from  national  to  provincial\ngovernments, without considering local plans and budget requirements. No specific budget\nheading was made for urban infrastructure maintenance. In 1995, the Government launched a\nprogram of decentralization and created the Vientiane Urban Development and Management\nCommittee (VUDMC) as a legal urban entity. A decentralized form of urban governance was\nadvanced with the consolidation of VUDMC as VUDAA in 1999. VUDAA was envisioned to\neventually  become  an  autonomous  urban  local  government  with  (i)  responsibilities  and\ncommensurate capacities for planning and managing infrastructure and services within the\nVientiane urban area, and (ii) its own sources of revenue and budget to meet its expenditures\nfor the delegated tasks. The creation of a distinct and decentralized urban entity in Vientiane\nwas followed by the establishment in 1997 of urban development and administration authorities\n(UDAAs) in four major secondary towns.\n18. The Government's commitment to decentralization has become the dominant theme of a\nnumber  of  prime  ministerial  (PM)  decrees,  instructions,  decisions,  notifications,  and  policy\nstatements. Most significant in the decentralization process are decrees 177/PM issued in 1997\nand  14/PM  in  1999,  and  the  operational  instructions  of  141/PM  issued  in  May  2000  for\nimplementing decrees 177/PM and 14/PM. These decrees recognize UDAAs in Vientiane and\nsecondary towns as legal entities exclusively responsible for urban communities, and define the\nposition of UDAAs as organizations within provincial and prefectural administrative apparatuses.\nUDAAs  are  delegated  tasks  to  plan,  implement,  manage,  and  control  urban  development\nactivities, including roads, drainage, collection and disposal of waste, sanitation and protection\nof environment, public lighting, preventing riverbank erosion, and maintaining public parks. The", "6\ndelegated  tasks  include  land  use  planning  and  building  control  in  cooperation  with  other\nagencies. More importantly, the decrees empower UDAAs to raise revenues within the levels\nset by the central Government, from a range of sources including service fees and charges,\nincome from movable or immovable property, sharing of national taxes, borrowing loans, local\nand foreign grants, and allocations of funds from the central Government. UDAAs are entrusted\nwith  using  these  funds  to  perform  the  delegated  tasks.  Finally,  the  decrees  also  provide\nguidelines on the organizational structure and working procedures of UDAAs.\n19. Within the framework of the foregoing decrees, VUDAA has been gradually developing\nitself as an urban entity. It has made some progress in developing its organizational structure\nand capacity to prepare for its new responsibilities. The president or mayor of the VUDAA is\nvice governor of the Vientiane Prefecture, and VUDAA is managed by a board chaired by the\npresident and comprising the heads of the four districts in the Vientiane urban area. VUDAA has\na manager who is the most senior staff member in the organization. The manager acts as\nsecretary to the VUDAA board. There are two deputy managers responsible for technical and\nadministrative matters, respectively. Under this management structure, VUDAA has at present\nfive major divisions. It has about 70 technical and administrative staff, and about 160 field\nworkers. The number of staff recruited over the last quarter of 2000, has significantly increased.\nStaff have been transferred from other departments of the Vientiane Prefecture, and recruited\nfrom outside. More importantly, the governor of Vientiane issued, in December 2000, Decision\n1804 that allowed VUDAA to levy and collect a range of specific direct and indirect user charges\nand fees, including charges for solid waste collection, desludging services, and fees for vehicle\nparking, building permits, advertising signs, leasing public land, urban obligation fees from all\nbuildings and commercial outlets, and surcharges for water, electricity, and fuel consumption.\nThe governor's decision was confirmed by a PM decision, 21/PM, on 26 April 2001 to ensure\nthat  the  income,  to  be  generated  through  water  and  electricity  surcharges,  will  be  made\navailable to VUDAA. These initiatives in the urban sector are also supportive of the national\ngoals of the Government for domestic resource mobilization to finance recurrent expenditures\nfor social development and to sustain existing physical assets.\n20. However, in moving from a centralized form of urban governance to a decentralized\nmode,  the  Government  faces  a  number  of  further  challenges.  The  Lao  PDR's  existing\nConstitution does not provide for a distinct urban territorial authority. In addition, the provisions\nof the prevailing State Budget Law, which stipulates a centralized financial system, are not\ncompatible with the Government's policy of decentralized revenue generation and financial\nmanagement reflected in the foregoing decrees. Apart from inconsistency in the legal basis, the\ncurrent position of the UDAAs in the national territorial hierarchy is ambiguous. The position of\nUDAAs as administrative units of provincial and prefectural governments does not fully conform\nto the concept of autonomous urban local governments. In addition, the interface and linkages\nof UDAAs with other tiers of administration and with district authorities are not clearly defined,\nespecially in the case of VUDAA whose geographic jurisdiction cuts across four districts. The\nPM's instruction 01/PM, issued in March 2000, which stipulates decentralization from central to\nlower levels of Governments and defines the province as the strategic unit, the district as the\nbudget and planning unit, and the village as implementing unit, makes no reference to urban\nauthorities. There is also the issue of the geographic jurisdiction of the authority of VUDAA. The\nVientiane urban area, for which VUDAA is responsible, was determined in 1995. The existing\nboundary of the Vientiane urban area does not cover the urban area, recently developed on the\noutskirts of the city, and is leading to  inconsistencies in the approach to and the levels of\nservices.\n21. While VUDAA derives power from the foregoing decrees to raise revenues and utilize\nthem for the urban tasks, as a department of the Vientiane Prefecture VUDAA needs to obtain", "7\napproval from the central Government when setting charges, from the Governor for its annual\nbudget, and from the Vientiane Prefecture administration for expenses above an agreed upon\nthreshold, resulting in incomplete financial autonomy for VUDAA. A great deal of effort is\nassociated with setting up the cost recovery measures within VUDAA, and there is broad\nconsensus in the Government on their implementation. However, some issues are associated\nwith the recently adopted cost recovery measures. The structure of charges and fees does not\nfully  reflect  the  principles  of  equity  and  consumption  levels  of  services.  Following  the\nGovernment's decentralization process, responsibility for collecting some national taxes has\nbeen devolved to the village authorities. While village-level collection of revenue is likely to lead\nto greater transparency, a framework has yet to be established to ensure transparency and\nincreased collection efficiency.\n22. The overall capacity of VUDAA to effectively perform its new functions and to exercise\nits power to generate revenue and manage its financial resources needs further strengthening.\nManagement  and  operational  systems  are  in  the  process  of  being  established.  The  staff\nrecently increased, but in many cases new members lack experience and skills appropriate to\ntheir respective positions. There is need to further develop management systems and human\nresources to enable VUDAA to perform its delegated tasks better. The scale of reforms toward\nan entirely distinct system of decentralized urban governance in the Lao PDR in general, and in\nVientiane  in  particular,  necessitates  extensive  and  long-term  support  for  the  reforms  and\nassociated capacity building for VUDAA.\nC. External Assistance\n23. The Lao PDR has received considerable assistance from external aid agencies in urban\ndevelopment. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), through the UN Centre for\nHuman Settlements Development, supported the establishment and strengthening of the Urban\nResearch Institute, providing training and assistance in the preparation of urban plans. UNDP is\ncurrently assisting in the Governance and Public Administration Reform Programme, which\nincludes local administration reforms. The World Bank (WB), in cooperation with the Australian\nAgency for International Development (AusAID), has been engaged in a long-term land-titling\nprogram that will provide secure land ownership and facilitate local resource mobilization by\nmeans  of  improved  land  tax  registration  and  the  potential  to  introduce  effective  property\ntaxation. The program is under way in Vientiane and as of January 2001, 57 villages in the\nVientiane urban area have completed the process, and around 13,000 out of about 49,000 titles\nhave been issued. The United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) helped in a pilot\nproject to upgrade low-income areas. The project included a successful microcredit scheme that\nis  now  being  expanded  into  four  urban  districts  of  Vientiane  under  the  Microfinance  and\nSustainable  Livelihood  Project.  The  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  the\nEuropean Union, and the Government of Denmark are active in environmental improvements,\nsolid  waste  management,  wastewater  treatment,  sanitation,  and  riverbank  protection,\ncomplementing ADB\u2019s investments in Vientiane. Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD),\nwhich has been involved in a more limited area of the urban sector and with focus on cultural\nheritage protection and water supply, is now expanding its involvement to urban infrastructure\ndevelopment  and  capacity  building.  While  external  assistance  in  the  sector  is  generally\nconsistent  and  complementary,  the  experience  suggests  the  need  for  a  more  effective\ncoordination  among  the  activities  of  funding  agencies  to  ensure  concerted  efforts  toward\ncommon sector goals. Appendix 2 gives detailed information on the external support to the\nurban sector in Vientiane.\n24. ADB has one of the largest portfolios of development assistance to the Lao PDR, and is\nthe major external agency in the urban sector. Its involvement in urban development in the Lao", "8\nPDR began in 1974 with water supply projects. Five loans ($58 million) were provided since\nthen to rehabilitate and expand water supply systems in Vientiane, and in provincial and small\ntowns.  Investments  in  water  supply  were  accompanied  by  efforts  to  develop  a  regulatory\nframework, attain financial sustainability, and decentralize the management of water supply.\nADB's involvement with integrated development of urban areas began in 1993 with the TA for\nthe Vientiane Integrated Urban Development Project (VIUDP) and the subsequent loan. This\ncontinued with the TA to prepare the Secondary Towns Urban Development Project in 1996,\nfollowed by a further loan.7 The latter two loans were supplemented by three TA8s ($1.8 million)\nto support the Government efforts for policy and institutional reforms in the sector and capacity\nbuilding for sector institutions.\nD. Lessons Learned\n25. The proposed Project is the second loan for urban development in Vientiane. The city,\nbeing the country's principal urban center, was the beneficiary of ADB's first broad-based\nassistance, VIUDP, whose experience is regarded to be the most relevant to the Project. A loan\nof $20 million was provided in 1995 to fund a range of infrastructure improvements, including\nroads,  drainage,  solid  waste  management,  and  sanitation  with  a  main  focus  on  primary\ninfrastructure and services. VIUDP also included an institutional strengthening component and a\nsocial action program to ensure community participation and support. The physical and social\ncomponents  under  VIUDP  were  accompanied  by  a  significant  policy  agenda  to  support\ndecentralized urban governance, creation of urban-focused entities, local resource mobilization,\nand improved human resources, all of which formed the components of a time-bound action\nplan and the loan covenants.\n26. VIUDP  is  now  complete  and  has  resulted  in  notable  improvements  in  the  urban\nenvironment. Road improvements led to improved transport efficiencies and reduced traffic\ncongestion and air pollution. Drainage, sanitation, and solid waste management improvements\nhave resulted in reduced levels of urban pollution and significant gains in public health. All\nproject components were implemented successfully, except the on-site sanitation component\nwhose implementation was constrained by inadequate household demand associated with lack\nof affordability and technologies appropriate for specific local conditions within Vientiane. The\nsocial action program proved effective in disseminating information on project interventions and\ngaining community support for the project, especially the solid waste management component\nand project-related land acquisition, although the latter seemed to demand a disproportionately\ngreater time and resources. While progress on the overall policy agenda was slower than\nenvisaged, VIUDP, whereby the core structure of VUDAA was created, pioneered the evolution\nof  a  distinct  urban  institutional  framework  and  decentralized  urban  governance.  A  training\nfacility, created under VIUDP to deliver courses in urban planning and management, has had a\nwide impact on transferring knowledge and skills on urban management to the staff of urban\nagencies, including VUDAA.\n27. The experience of earlier ADB assistance indicates the need for a consultative approach\nduring project preparation and careful design and implementation of community mobilization\nprograms to (i) ensure that the stakeholders feel a sense of project ownership, (ii) better target\nthe poor, (iii) derive sustained benefits from physical improvements, and (iv) solicit community\nsupport for reforms. The review of the earlier assistance also suggests that a demand-led\n                                                \n7  Loan 1525-LAO: Secondary Towns Urban Development Project, for $27 million, approved on 26 June 1997.\n8\nThese include: (i) TA 2377-LAO: Establishing Municipal Administration System, for $700,000, approved on 17\nAugust 1995; (ii) TA 2972-LAO: Support to Urban Development Administrations, for $500,000, approved on 31\nDecember 1997 and (iii) TA 3331-LAO: Capacity Building for Urban Development Administration, for $600,000,\napproved on 10 December 1999.", "9\napproach should be followed in providing infrastructure and services. A gradation of services will\nfacilitate responsiveness to the needs and affordability requirements of various income groups.\nFurther, the experience reveals that institutional reforms can be achieved with broad-based\nsupport, and consensus building requires a longer period of time than that envisaged. Reforms\nneed to be introduced in a progressive manner commensurate with capacities, to be supported\nby extensive and well-targeted capacity building programs. Other lessons highlight the need for\ngreater  emphasis  on  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  increased  capacities  for  project\nmanagement within the Government, and improved contractors' performance.\nE. ADB's Sector Strategy in the Lao PDR\n28. With the changing circumstances in the Lao PDR and the renewed commitment of ADB\nand the Government to poverty reduction, ADB is now in the process of revisiting its country\noperational  strategy.  The  new  strategy,  currently  being  prepared  on  the  basis  of  the\nGovernment's Fifth Five-Year Socioeconomic Development Plan, 2001-2005, will have poverty\nreduction as its overarching objective. ADB will support reforms for effective macroeconomic\nmanagement, good governance, capacity building, and human resource development. Domestic\nresource  mobilization,  participatory  development,  and  private  sector  participation  are  also\nimportant building blocks of ADB's strategy. In accordance with the country operational strategy,\nthe focus of ADB assistance in the urban sector will be on basic urban services, and improving\nthe environment and the quality of life of the urban residents, with greater emphasis on the\nneeds of the poor. ADB's sector strategy will seek to utilize existing urban potentials to support\nbroad-based  regional  development  and  reduce  poverty  within  both  urban  and  rural\ncommunities. In addition to its assistance to date in Vientiane and secondary towns, small towns\nwill be the focus of ADB's interventions in future. ADB will continue to support the creation of an\nenabling legal, institutional, and financial framework for enhanced urban management. The\nareas  of  policy  dialogue  will  cover  (i)  legal  reforms  for  effective  decentralization,  (ii)\nadministrative and financial devolution to UDAAs, (iii) local resource mobilization and cost\nrecovery,  (iv)  reforms  for  responsive  and  pro-poor  urban  governance,  (v)  interventions  for\neffective  planning,  (vi)  urban  poverty  reduction,  and  (vii)  private  sector  involvement  in  the\ndelivery of urban services. Capacity building efforts, including in planning, revenue mobilization,\nfinancial  management,  and  O&M,  will  be  pursued  to  strengthen  newly  established  urban\nauthorities.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n29. Since VIUDP, ADB has continued policy dialogue with the Government. Along with\nurban  infrastructure  and  environmental  improvements,  creation  of  an  appropriate  legal,\ninstitutional, and financial framework for decentralized urban governance and establishment of\nurban-focused  local  authorities  have  been  the  main  thrust  of  ADB\u2019s  assistance.  A  strong\nemphasis has been placed on mobilizing local resources and cost recovery measures as an\nintegral element of institutional reforms and a prerequisite for sustainable delivery of services.\nThese objectives have been the salient components of a policy and institutional reform agenda\nset out under VIUDP, and incorporated into the loan covenants agreed to by the Government.\nADB-assisted urban projects in Vientiane and secondary towns were milestones for urban\nsector development built on key policy reforms that fully supported the Government efforts for\nthe creation of a decentralized form of urban governance. The establishment of VUDAA was\ninitiated under VIUDP. The loan for the Secondary Towns Urban Development Project led to the\ncreation of similar authorities in four other major secondary towns. With two completed and one\nongoing advisory TAs, ADB has supported the institutionalization and strengthening of newly\nestablished urban-focused local authorities.", "10\n30. During project preparation an assessment of ongoing sector reforms was undertaken.\nNoting the slow progress with the policy reform agenda under earlier projects, ADB has pursued\nactive policy dialogue with the Government on the accomplishment of the targeted reforms.\nAlthough somewhat slow, the Government took steps to meet the targets of the reform agenda.\nHowever, more needs to be done by the Government to achieve full decentralization. The\ncontent of the policy dialogue, which builds on the already initiated reforms together with the\npolicy  reforms  agreed  upon  in  previous  ADB  projects,  covers  the  remaining  steps  to  be\naccomplished in the decentralization process. Appendix 3 gives a matrix of the urban policy and\ninstitutional reform agenda to which the Government has agreed. Within the next five years,\nVUDAA  is  envisioned  to  advance  to  a  stage  where  it  is  financially  and  administratively\nautonomous, can successfully manage its urban functions, and can have its services paid for.\n1. Enabling Legal Framework for Decentralization and Devolution\n31. ADB  has  supported  the  creation  of  a  legal  framework  for  decentralized  urban\ngovernance. ADB projects and TAs have been instrumental in the issuance of a number of PM\ndecrees, instructions, and notices that have formed an initial legal base for devolving functions\nand financial powers to UDAAs. At this stage, there is need for further legal reforms to establish\na  strong  and  clear  legal  and  constitutional  basis  for  decentralized  urban  governance  and\nfinance.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  complete  its  review  and  submit  to  the  National\nAssembly draft bills for the constitutional amendment and the Law on Local Administration.\nConsistency among the pieces of legislation with respect to the role and status of UDAAs will\nalso be ensured. The Project will assist the Government in the further development of a clear\nlegal framework for decentralized urban governance.\n2.  Financial Devolution, Local Resource Mobilization, and Cost Recovery\n32. ADB has recognized that financial devolution, whereby UDAAs have control over the\ngeneration  and  management  of  financial  resources,  is  fundamental  to  successful\ndecentralization.  Accordingly,  ADB  has  supported  the  delegation  to  UDAAs  of  power  to\ngenerate and manage their own revenues in performing their tasks. With a number of PM\ndecrees, UDAAs were empowered to levy and collect user charges and taxes. In December\n2000, the governor of Vientiane Prefecture issued Decision 1804 which provides VUDAA with a\nsound fiscal basis to achieve resource mobilization and cost recovery from a limited number of\nincome sources at low administration costs and the potential to generate substantial revenue.\nThe implementation of the Decision 1804 is a major element of the urban policy and institutional\nreform agenda to which the Government agreed. The Government made a commitment to\nprovide all administrative and staffing support to VUDAA to ensure that VUDAA will generate\nrevenues from the sources made available to it through the governor's Decision, to meet at least\n50 percent of the costs incurred in providing services and undertaking O&M by 1 October 2003\nand 100 percent by 2006. The Project will help VUDAA to (i) levy and collect charges in an\neffective manner, (ii) undertake a review of the charges to ensure social equity, (iii) gradually\nincrease the rates of charges and fees to achieve cost recovery targets, and (iv) undertake\nimproved budgeting and accounting practices.\n3. Administrative and Geographic Jurisdiction of VUDAA\n33. UDAAs currently fall under the respective provincial governments and, in the case of\nVUDAA under the Vientiane Prefecture, although they differ from other provincial departments\nas they are empowered to levy and collect revenues. It is essential that VUDAA eventually be\nrecognized as an administratively autonomous organization with clearly defined linkages with\nother  tiers  such  as  Vientiane  Prefecture  and  other  ministries,  especially  MCTPC  and  the", "11\nMinistry of Finance (MOF). The issue of geographic jurisdiction of VUDAA, which currently\nexcludes a substantial portion of the adjacent urban area, also needs to be addressed. Under\nthe urban policy and reform agenda to be implemented in conjunction with the Project, the\nGovernment agreed that the interface between and the roles of the central, provincial, and\ndistrict governments, and UDAAs will be clearly defined. The geographic jurisdiction of VUDAA\nwill be gradually expanded to coincide with the expanded urban area of Vientiane along with\ncommensurate capacity building for VUDAA.\n4. Good Governance\n34. Establishment of VUDAA and UDAAs, whereby the urban administration is brought\ncloser to the people, is a major step to good governance. Recent experience with UDAAs has\nclearly  shown  increased  interaction  between  the  urban  community  and  the  Government.\nHowever,  further  reforms  are  required  to  harness  the  full  potential  of  decentralized  urban\ngovernance to promote good governance reflected as participatory management, downward\naccountability, and transparency in urban affairs. The recent policy of the Government to assign\nto the villages a greater role in development provides an immense scope to promote responsive\ngovernance  in  managing  urban  areas.  The  Project  will  support  the  establishment  and\ninstitutionalization of mechanisms for enhanced two-way communication between VUDAA and\nthe villages. The Project approaches, which reinforce the roles of village organizations and\ncommunities, will catalyze reforms for responsive urban governance. The capacities of VUDAA,\nvillage organizations, and communities in participatory urban management will be strengthened.\n5. Effective Planning\n35. Both ADB and the Government have recognized the importance of urban planning as a\nbasic requirement of a cost-effective infrastructure development, environmental and cultural\nsustainability, and equitable spatial organization of the city in which all income groups including\nthe poor can find living space of reasonable quality. ADB since 1995 provided assistance in the\npreparation and approval of the master plan for Vientiane. There is need at this stage to\nimprove the effectiveness of the existing planning system and the master plan. The Government\nhas agreed to a number of interventions. The master plan will be amended to ensure the\nprotection of ecologically fragile areas. VUDAA will adopt a program approach with a number of\nstrategic and action plans for priority areas to prevent unplanned development and to protect\nthe cultural heritage of Vientiane. Existing zoning regulations will be reviewed and simplified to\nfacilitate development control at VUDAA level. Innovative land development techniques will be\ntested to establish effective instruments for planned development. The Project will assist the\nGovernment and VUDAA in undertaking the reforms, and VUDAA's capacity will be enhanced to\nenable it to perform planning and development control functions effectively.\n6.  Urban Poverty Reduction\n36. The Government is committed to poverty reduction and has specific targets to reduce\npoverty  in  Vientiane.  The  Project,  whose  design  was  guided  by  a  participatory  poverty\nassessment in Vientiane, has a strong focus on the needs of the poor, and incorporates a social\nstrategy to address poverty and associated social issues. ADB will pursue the development of\npro-poor urban management skills within VUDAA by sensitizing the VUDAA staff to urban\npoverty, and strengthening VUDAA's and villages' capacity in participatory local planning and\ndevelopment. The poverty impact of the Project will be closely monitored. Coordination will also\nbe maintained with initiatives for poverty reduction at the Vientiane Prefecture level.", "12\n7. Capacity Building\n37. The Government views capacity building as the greatest challenge in the process of\ndecentralization.  In  the  Seventh  RTM,  the  Government  acknowledged  that  decentralization\nrequires reallocation of human, material, and financial resources from central ministries to new\nurban  local  administrations  and  acceleration  of  capacity  building  and  training  programs  to\nenable these administrations to shoulder their new responsibilities. ADB has supported the\nGovernment efforts to build institutional capacities within the newly formed decentralized urban\ngovernance. With a greater enabling policy framework in place, VUDAA needs at this stage\nfurther support to transform itself into a fully competent agency. ADB recognizes the need to\ncontinue support to VUDAA with a long-term and comprehensive program of capacity building,\nand sought complementary Government actions in the form of increased staffing and other\nresources of VUDAA to ensure that the capacity-building support will produce the intended\noutcomes.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n38. Current deficiencies in basic infrastructure and services in the Vientiane urban area\ninhibit economic growth and undermine the quality of life of the urban residents and especially\nthe  poor.  Despite  recent  investments  in  primary  road  and  drainage  networks,  the  poor\nconditions of the secondary and tertiary infrastructure constrain the full potential of and benefits\nfrom recent improvements in primary infrastructure and services. In the absence of a complete\nstorm water drainage system, flooding continues to be a perennial problem affecting large parts\nof  the  urban  area.  Frequent  flooding  contributes  to  the  poor  state  of  roads.  Many  of  the\nsecondary  and  local  roads  remain  impassable  during  and  following  heavy  rainfall  thereby\ndisrupting the urban economy. The inadequate sanitation systems compound the environmental\nproblems. Lack of basic infrastructure and services at community and household levels has a\nparticularly adverse impact on the lives of the poor who primarily live in low-lying marginal land\nsubject to flooding for most of the year. Inadequate environmental conditions and associated\npoor health and low productivity are the major characteristics of poverty in Vientiane and the\nmost overwhelming problem faced by the poor.\n39. Sustained economic growth and the quality of life of the residents in the Vientiane urban\narea are further constrained by the still evolving urban institutional framework and nascent\nurban management. While significant progress has been made toward decentralized urban\ngovernance,  whereby  the  diverse  needs  of  an  urban  economy  and  a  population  can  be\naddressed more effectively, the tasks ahead to make VUDAA a fully autonomous, financially\nsustainable, and organizationally competent urban authority are considerable.\n40. For Vientiane to become an important driver of the national economy and the locus of\nurban poverty reduction, it is essential that the quality of the urban environment be improved.\nDevelopment  of  the  primary  infrastructure  of  Vientiane  has  progressed  well,  but  is  still\nincomplete, and there is need at this stage to shift the focus of efforts to secondary and\ncommunity-level infrastructure and services to ensure that environmental improvements are felt\nby  all,  especially  the  poor.  Equally  important  is  smooth  progress  in  decentralization  and\naccomplishment  of  key  reforms  and  development  of  VUDAA  as  an  urban  entity  with  the\nnecessary operational and management systems, staff, and financial resources. The extent of\nreforms needed to fully achieve decentralized urban governance in the Lao PDR in general, and\nin  Vientiane  in  particular,  require  extensive  and  long-term  support  for  reforms  and  the\ncorresponding capacity building.", "13\nB. Objectives and Scope\n41. The objectives of the Project are to improve the quality of life of the urban residents,\nespecially the poor and the disadvantaged, and to enhance urban productivity and economic\ngrowth in the Vientiane urban area. To this end, the Project has two specific objectives: (i) to\nsupport decentralization and urban governance reforms and the process toward an autonomous,\nwell-functioning, and self-sufficient urban local government capable of planning, managing, and\nfinancing urban development and providing services in a sustainable manner, and (ii) to target\ninvestments in infrastructure and services to maximize the utility of existing infrastructure by\ncompleting  missing  links  and  through  service  efficiency  improvements  and  focussing  on\nsecondary  and  tertiary-level  infrastructure  thus,  allowing  a  greater  share  of  the  population,\nespecially the poor, to benefit from environmental improvements. The Project represents ADB\u2019s\nsecond intervention in the Vientiane urban area, and incorporates lessons learned from the\nexperience with VIUDP.\n42. The project area covers a hundred villages within the jurisdiction of VUDAA. The project\ncomponents  follow:  (i)  part  A:  citywide  urban  infrastructure  and  services,  comprising  critical\nmissing links of primary and secondary roads and drainage, efficiency improvements in solid\nwaste management, traffic management and road safety, and maintenance improvements; (ii)\npart B: village area improvements (VAI), adopting a demand-led and participatory approach and\ncombining  community  infrastructure  and  services  with  community-level  capacity  building  and\nawareness raising in environmental health, participatory local planning and community-based\ninfrastructure development and service delivery; and (iii) part C: project implementation support\nand a comprehensive capacity building program to support the accomplishment of the urban\npolicy and institutional reform agenda, and enhance planning, O&M, revenue mobilization, and\nfinancial management capabilities of VUDAA.\n1.  Citywide Infrastructure and Environmental Improvements (Part A)\n43. Citywide infrastructure and services comprise improvements to primary and secondary\nroad and drainage networks, traffic management and safety, solid waste management efficiency\nimprovements, and providing VUDAA with an office building and basic maintenance equipment.\nMajor roads and drainage improvements in part A were selected on the basis of the criteria,\nincluding (i) completion of critical missing links of primary and secondary roads and drainage\nimprovements that were appraised but not included in VIUDP for lack of funding, (ii) provision of\nimproved secondary access and associated drainage in areas of high population density with\ninadequate  infrastructure,  (iii)  improvements  to  the  road  network  and  associated  drainage\nsystem  in  the  central  business  district,  and  (iv)  introduction  of  trunk  infrastructure  in  new\ndevelopment areas to intensify development within the existing built up area.\n44. Subprojects in the road sector seek to upgrade (widen and seal) existing roads and\nconstruct new ones. Of the 23 road subprojects, 12.7 km and 21 km are primary and secondary\nroads, respectively, to be improved by rehabilitating damaged roads and surfacing previously\nunsurfaced roads, while 2.1 km comprises new secondary alignments. Investments in road\nimprovements will be supported with the provision of essential maintenance equipment and\ncapacity building in maintenance to enhance the sustainability of investments.\n45. The drainage component has 10 subprojects that will improve and channelize existing\nprimary and secondary drainage lines, and construct new sections to connect isolated stretches\nof drains into an integrated drainage network. A total length of 14 km of drainage channel will be\nimproved, of which 5.8 km is primary and 8.2 km is secondary. Improvements to drainage will", "14\nbe accompanied by the provision of essential maintenance equipment and capacity building in\nmaintenance.\n46. Solid  waste  management  improvements  at  the  city  level  are  targeted  to  expand\ncoverage and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the existing system. Citywide solid\nwaste management interventions include providing additional equipment to enable services to\ncontinue in an area where services are under threat of being withdrawn due to old equipment.\nThe interventions also include enhancing collection efficiency through rationalizing fleet usage\nand delegating solid waste management initiatives to villages, and introducing administrative\nefficiencies by shifting from household contracts (now 15,000) to collective village contracts\n(189 maximum).\n47. The traffic management and road safety component will address the problems of traffic\ngrowth,  poor  traffic  management,  and  deteriorating  road  safety  and  personal  security  for\npedestrians. It will support the road infrastructure component by maximizing road use efficiency\nand improving road safety. The component, as part of a broader strategy to be prepared early in\nproject implementation, will include installation of traffic signals, traffic signs and road marking;\nprovision of streetlights along 18 km of the 102 km of primary and secondary roads; and a road\nsafety awareness program.\n48. The institutional infrastructure component will include construction of an office building\nfor  VUDAA  and  provision  of  basic  road  and  drainage  maintenance  equipment.  The  office\nbuilding will allow VUDAA to establish a permanent base adequate to accommodate the staff\nnecessary  to  perform  its  mandate  and  also  reinforce  its  institutional  identity  and  profile.\nMaintenance equipment will help VUDAA carry out its routine and occasional periodic road and\ndrainage  maintenance  tasks  in  the  absence  of  imminent  private  sector  involvement  and\nappropriate capacities within VUDAA to manage and supervise privately delivered services. The\nequipment, to be supported by efforts to build the capacity of VUDAA in maintenance under the\ncapacity building component, will enable VUDAA to (i) carry out vital infrastructure maintenance,\n(ii) provide cost benchmark information for the eventual privatization of maintenance activities,\nand (iii) provide contingency facilities in case private contractors fail to perform.\n2.  Village Area Improvements (Part B)\n49. Village area improvements (VAI) will comprise community infrastructure and services to\nbe supported by a community preparation and awareness program. VAI will follow a demand-\nled approach seeking as a prerequisite the willingness of village communities to participate in\nand contribute financially or in kind to a portion of the cost of VAI. This approach, which is based\non pilot studies in two villages, will better reflect the diverse community needs and forge a\ncommunity sense of ownership. The component will adopt a sector program modality. Villages\nwill be accepted into the program on the basis of the criteria that include (i) infrastructure and\nservice deficiencies, (ii) poor socioeconomic conditions and prevalence of poverty, (iii) extent of\ndemand, as expressed by villages' willingness to participate in and contribute to the project (iv)\ninclusion in WB/AusAID-supported land titling project, so that the investments are supported by\nclear land use rights, (v) proximity to trunk infrastructure from which villages can be served, and\n(vi) revenue collection efficiency in accordance with the new policy of the Government on\ndecentralized revenue collection. Fifty villages with a total population of about 81,000 will be\ncovered under the program. The VAI will assign a major role to villages, and rely on village\norganizations  and  communities  in  planning,  implementing,  and  O&M  of  infrastructure  and\nservices to be provided under the Project. The Project's social strategy incorporates specific\nmeasures for effective targeting of the poor and reinforcing the role of women in the process as", "15\nthe primary users of services. A participatory implementation framework for VAI is in Appendix\n4.\n50. The community infrastructure and services will adopt an integrated approach to service\nprovision due to the interlinked nature of service deficiencies in villages. A package of services\ncombining surface drainage, tertiary access roads, primary solid waste collection, and sanitation\nimprovements will be determined for each participating village, based on its specific needs. The\nimprovements will have a range of options affordable for various low-income groups, especially\nthe poorest.\n51. The physical interventions of VAI will be supported by a community preparation and\nawareness  program,  comprising  (i)  raising  awareness  in  public  health  and  environmental\nmanagement/sanitation through community-based training and media-based public campaign;\nand (ii) building the capacity of villages, communities, and VUDAA for community-based local\nplanning, O&M, and monitoring and evaluation. Where needs exist, capacity building will include\norientation  for  microfinance  to  be  provided  under  UNCDF-supported  Microfinance  and\nSustainable  Livelihood  Project.  Training  will  target  the  poor  and  women  to  secure  their\nmeaningful participation in the program.\n3. Capacity Building and Project Implementation Support (Part C)\n52. The capacity building program in part C aims to help achieve one of the two key\nobjectives  of  the  Project  \u2013  to  support  the  Government's  policy  for  further  development  of\ndecentralized  urban  governance  and  accelerate  the  transformation  of  VUDAA  into  an\nautonomous, self-reliant, and capable agency to manage and finance urban development, and\ndeliver urban services. The scope of the capacity building assistance is closely linked to the\nurban policy and institutional reform agenda to be pursued in conjunction with the Project.\n53. The capacity building program will include assistance to the Government in the further\ndevelopment of a clear and sound legal and institutional framework that would establish VUDAA\nas a fully legitimate level of administration with clear linkages with Vientiane Prefecture, other\ntiers of administration, particularly districts and villages and other key ministries, e.g., MCTPC\nand MOF. The supported legal and institutional framework will define VUDAA with clear powers\nand responsibilities in generating revenues for its own use, levying of taxes and charges and\nfees, and setting rates for various revenue items. VUDAA will be supported in its efforts to meet\nrevenue mobilization targets.\n54. The capacity building program will also help in the further development of management\nand operational systems to allow VUDAA to undertake its mandated urban tasks effectively. The\nassistance  will  target  (i)  organizational  development  of  VUDAA,  (ii)  improved  financial\nmanagement,  (iii)  asset  management,  (iv)  further  development  of  operational  systems  to\nimprove the performance of VUDAA in service delivery and maintenance, (v) facilitating private\nsector participation in delivery of urban services especially O&M, (vi) enhancing urban planning\nand  development  control  capacities,  streamlining  planning  regulations,  and  pilot-testing  of\nguided  land  development;  and  (vii)  responsive  governance  through  improving  two-way\ncommunications between VUDAA and communities and utilizing village organizations as the\nfocal point of interaction with urban residents.\n55. Further, the capacity building program will include human resource development to\nequip the VUDAA workforce with the necessary skills to effectively operate the systems and\nprocesses established. Human resource development will involve appropriate modes of training\nactivities  to  be  conducted  in  various  areas  based  on  an  assessment  of  needs.", "16\n56. In  addition  to  the  capacity  building  component,  part  C  includes  support  for  project\nimplementation management. This covers project management costs, including incremental\nadministration and operation associated with the project implementation and management unit\n(PIMU), equipment, logistics, and provision for all surveys and investigations to support the\ndetailed design process. Implementation support also covers the cost of 270 person-months of\nconsultancy inputs (76 international and 194 domestic).\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n57. The Project is estimated to cost $37.0 million equivalent (Table 1). The foreign exchange\ncost is estimated at $20.0 million, or about 54 percent of the total project cost, including $0.6\nmillion for interest during construction. The local currency cost is $17.0 million equivalent, or\nabout  46  percent  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  cost  of  urban  services,  environmental\nimprovements, and community infrastructure components covers land, civil works, equipment,\nand materials. Surveys, detailed design, and supervision are covered in the implementation\nsupport component. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 5.\n58. It is proposed that ADB provide a loan in the amount of $25.0 million from its Special\nFunds resources, which will represent 67 percent of the total cost of the Project. The ADB loan\nwill cover 82 percent of the foreign exchange cost and 50 percent of the local currency cost of\nthe Project, excluding taxes. The Borrower will be the Government of the Lao PDR. Proceeds\nfrom  the  ADB  loan  will  finance  the  full  costs  of  services  for  community  preparation  and\nawareness, consulting services for PIMU support, and the full foreign exchange cost and 50\npercent of the local currency cost (excluding land and relocation) for the road, drainage, solid\nwaste  management,  maintenance  equipment,  and  community  infrastructure  and  services.\nADB's  financing  for  the  local  currency  expenditure  is  justified  by  (i)  the  country's  limited\ndomestic resources as a result of the continuing effects of the 1997 Asian financial crisis as well\nas the lower-than-projected revenues; and (ii) the nature of the Project, which will improve the\neconomic efficiency of the Vientiane urban area, and enhance the living and health conditions of\nthe population, especially the poor. These will be achieved by upgrading drainage to reduce\nlocalized  flooding,  upgrading  local  roads  to  improve  accessibility  and  reduce  negative\nenvironmental impacts, and mobilizing communities in the provision and maintenance of urban\ninfrastructure.\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nComponent Foreign Local Total Cost Share\nExchange Currencya (percent)\nA.

AFD has assured that it will present a proposal to its board for a grant in the amount of\nEuro4.9 million ($4.4 million equivalent) to finance on a parallel basis the cost of capacity\nbuilding and the traffic management and road safety components and associated consulting\nservices, accounting for 12 percent of the project cost.\n60. The  Government  will  provide  by  itself  or  in  conjunction  with  Vientiane  Prefecture\nbudgetary support of $7.2 million equivalent which, together with a community contribution of\n$0.4 million equivalent, will cover the remaining 21 percent of the project cost or a total amount\nof $7.6 million equivalent. The Government will finance the cost of land and relocation, part of\nthe cost of the office building for VUDAA, taxes and duties, the balance of the cost of civil works,\nand part of the incremental administration costs. A summary of the financing arrangements is in\nTable 2. The detailed financing plan is in Appendix 5.\n61. VUDAA will contribute $2.9 million equivalent through a subloan from the Government\nusing the ADB loan proceeds. The subloan will have an interest rate of 6.7 percent per annum\nand a repayment period of 15 years, following project completion, including a grace period of 3\nyears. VUDAA's financing will cover 100 percent of the cost of maintenance equipment to\nensure VUDAA's recognition of the full cost involved in maintenance, and investment in solid\nwaste  management  because  it  is  income  generating  and  is  to  achieve  full  cost  recovery.\nVUDAA's financing will also cover 10 percent of the cost of the urban infrastructure, except the\ntraffic management and safety component to be financed by AFD, and VAI, to which the\ncommunity will contribute 10 percent. VUDAA's 10 percent contribution for urban infrastructure\nand services was adopted considering VUDAA's status as a new entity and the challenges that\nit is facing to its financial position.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total Percent\nExchange Currency Cost\nAsian Development Banka 16.5 8.5 25.0 67\nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement 3.5 0.9 4.4 12\nGovernment of the Lao PDR and Communityb 0.0 7.6 7.6 21\nTotal 20.0 17.0 37.0 100\na Includes $2.9 million to be onlent to VUDAA.\nb Includes community contribution of 1 percent of the cost of VAI ($0.4 million).\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Executing and Implementing Agencies\n62. The Executing Agency will be the Vientiane Prefecture with responsibility for strategic\nguidance, supervision, and execution of the Project. A project steering committee, chaired by\nthe president of VUDAA and with representatives from VUDAA, MOF, MCTPC, Ministry of\nJustice,  Committee  for  Planning  and  Cooperation,  and  Prime  Minister's  Office  (PMO)  has\nalready  been  formed  to  oversee  project  implementation  and  to  ensure  the  cooperation  of\nconcerned agencies, and accomplishment of the urban policy and institutional reform agenda.\nVUDAA  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency,  responsible  for  planning  and  implementation  of\nimprovements in urban infrastructure and services (parts A and B) and capacity building (part\nC). Villages will play a major role in planning, implementation, and O&M of the VAI component.\nThe project organization is shown in Appendix 6. The project implementation arrangements are\ndirected to (i) effective and timely implementation of the Project, (ii) using the implementation", "18\nprocess as a means to strengthen VUDAA, and (iii) enhancing the role and capacity of village\nauthorities and communities in planning and delivery of basic services. Project implementation,\ntherefore, will be as far as practical integrated with the current VUDAA structure and ongoing\ntasks.\n63. A combined PIMU will be set up within VUDAA. PIMU consists of a project director from\nVUDAA to be assisted by (i) two deputy directors; (ii) the leaders of the teams of consultants\nwho  are  responsible  for  improvements  in  urban  infrastructure  and  services  and  capacity\nbuilding, respectively, and who act as general advisers to the project director and deputy\ndirectors; and (iii) an accounting and administration unit to manage procurement and loan\naccount  administration.  One  deputy  director  will  be  responsible  for  management  and\nimplementation of urban infrastructure and services, and the other will oversee and guide the\ncapacity building component. The project director and the two deputy directors have already\nbeen appointed. The consulting teams will work under the overall guidance of the project\ndirector and deputy directors, coordinate with each other, and work closely with staff in the\ndivisions of VUDAA with the dual tasks of providing the key services required to implement the\nProject and strengthening those divisions in VUDAA.\n64. PIMU,  supported  by  the  consultants,  will  coordinate  and  manage  all  activities:\nprogramming, budgeting and financial planning, detailed engineering design, village selection,\ncommunity preparation and awareness, subproject preparation and appraisal for VAI, tendering\nand construction supervision, design and implementation of benefit monitoring and evaluation\nactivities, environmental assessment and protection, capacity building, and accomplishment of\nthe policy and institutional reform agenda and loan covenants.\n2. Implementation Schedule\n65. The Project will be implemented over a period of five years (Appendix 7) with consulting\nservices commencing in November 2001. The first year will be dedicated to preparation for\nimplementation,  including  further  detailed  surveys,  developing  procedures,  and  completing\ndetailed engineering design and tender documents. For the VAI component, this will be the\nperiod during which participatory processes with village organizations and communities will be\nestablished  as  a  way  to  detailed  prioritization  and  collaborative  implementation  of\nimprovements. Capacity building will continue throughout the project period. Project completion\nis scheduled for August 2006.\n3. Advance Action for Recruitment of Consultants\n66. To  expedite  project  implementation,  ADB  approved  the  Government's  request  for\nadvance action in engagement of consultants. Selection is expected to advance up to the stage\nof evaluation of the technical proposals. The Government has been informed that approval of\nadvance action does not in any way commit ADB to finance the relevant expenditures under the\nProject or the Project itself.\n4. Consulting Services\n67. Consulting  services  will  be  provided  by  foreign  and  domestic  consulting  firms.  The\nforeign consulting firms, to be associated with domestic consulting firms, will be engaged for\nproject implementation management support, traffic management and road safety programs,\nand capacity building. ADB will finance an estimated 270 person-months of consulting services\n(76  international  and  194  domestic)  to  assist  PIMU  in  overall  project  management,\nimplementation,  detailed  engineering  design,  construction  supervision,  design  and", "19\nimplementation of community-based and demand-led VAI, development of legal framework for\ndecentralized urban governance, and revenue mobilization within VUDAA. ADB will also finance\nservices by domestic consultants and other groups (e.g., nongovernment organizations [NGOs]\nand academia) who will assist in implementing the community preparation and awareness\nprogram and independent monitoring and evaluation of VAI and implementation of resettlement\naction plan, and for supervision of construction works in part A. The consultants will be recruited\nin accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements for\nengaging domestic consultants satisfactory to ADB. AFD will finance about 191 person-months\nof consulting inputs, including 173 person-months (65 international and 108 local) for capacity\nbuilding and 18 person-months (5 international and 13 local) for traffic management and safety\ncomponents.  Consultants  for  the  capacity  building  and  traffic  management  and  safety\ncomponents will be recruited through separate packages in accordance with AFD's procedures.\nThe project director will ensure coordination between the ADB and AFD consultant teams.\n5. Procurement\n68. Goods and works to be financed by ADB will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement. International competitive bidding (ICB) procedures will be used for\nmajor civil works contracts estimated to cost $1.0 million or more and supply contracts valued at\n$500,000 or higher. For civil works contracts not exceeding $1.0 million, local competitive\nbidding  (LCB)  procedures  will  be  used.  The  Government\u2019s  procurement  guidelines\n(Implementing Rules and Regulations on Government Procurement of Goods Construction,\nRepairs  and  Services,  Dec  1998),  prepared  under  an  ADB  TA,  are  satisfactory.  Contract\ndocuments for LCB, developed under the Secondary Towns Urban Development Project, can\nbe used, subject to ADB\u2019s review and approval. For supply contracts valued $500,000 or lower,\ninternational shopping procedures will be followed.\n69. For  VAI,  most  works  will  be  labor-intensive  and  will  not  require  sophisticated\ntechnologies and equipment. A package of works per village is relatively small, ranging from\n$30,000 to $100,000. It will, therefore, be appropriate to call for the participation in construction\nworks of the local communities, resulting in a sense of ownership and sustainability of the\nproject  assets.  Works  that  do  not  cost  more  than  $50,000  are  not  attractive  to  private\ncontractors, and where the capacity of the community to undertake the works is adequate,\ncommunity participation in procurement will be applied. Indicative procurement packaging is\nshown in Appendix 8.\n6. Disbursement\n70. Immediately upon loan effectiveness, the Government will open and maintain a project\nimprest account for PIMU to ensure the timely release of loan proceeds and counterpart funds\nand expedite project implementation. The initial amount to be allocated to the imprest account is\n$500,000. Imprest funds will be basically used for small expenditures locally incurred, including\nincremental  project  administration  cost.  VUDAA  has  proven  adequate  internal  controls,\naccounting and auditing under VIUDP. The statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure may be\nused  for  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  for  the  Project  and  to  liquidate  advances\nprovided into the imprest account in accordance with the ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook,\nJanuary 2001, as amended from time to time, and detailed arrangements agreed upon by the\nBorrower and ADB. Any individual payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under the SOE\nprocedure will not exceed $50,000.", "20\n7. Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n71. The Project's resettlement and land acquisition impacts are limited. Most of the proposed\nimprovements in part A are within the existing rights-of-way. Where new alignments and right-\nof-way  widening  are  proposed,  changing  of  alignments  and  engineering  designs  have\nminimized the acquisition of privately owned land and displacement of properties. The roads\nand drainage improvements in part A will require 12.9 hectares of land of which about 9\nhectares is privately owned. Only 89 households (500 persons) will be affected by full or partial\nloss of their land, houses, or outbuildings. Of the 89 households affected, 48 will have effects on\ntheir houses or other structures. Eighteen of these structures are temporary shelters made of\nlight  materials  and  the  remaining  30  are  of  brick  or  wood.  Many  affected  structures  are\nouthouses rather than main dwellings. In most cases, householders will have to give up narrow\nstrips  of  unirrigated  paddy  land.  Of  the  48  households,  only  6  will  require  relocation  and\nresettlement of the households. These households will be accommodated in the same village if\npossible. Transactions on land use for affected households that have not yet been covered by\nthe Land Titling Project will be documented properly. The affected households will receive\nreplacement land or cash for land and immovable assets at replacement prices. Compensation\nwill also be provided for loss of business, livelihood, and shifting of structures or goods, etc. VAI\ncomponent will not require land acquisition. A summary resettlement action plan is attached as\nAppendix 9. A full resettlement action plan, prepared in accordance with policies and practices\nof the Lao PDR and ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, is a supplementary appendix.\n8. Operation and Maintenance\n72. VUDAA will be responsible for the maintenance of the facilities to be created under part\nA. VUDAA's current capacity in terms of equipment and technical skills requires strengthening.\nThe Project will provide VUDAA with maintenance equipment. The provision of equipment is\ncomplemented by capacity building under part C which emphasizes strengthening VUDAA's\nskills in O&M. In addition, the recently adopted cost recovery measures and their projected\nprogressive increase over the next five years are expected to provide greater funds for O&M.\nFor  the  VAI  component,  village  communities  will  have  a  major  responsibility  for  periodic\nmaintenance  of  infrastructure.  To  the  extent  possible,  communities  will  also  be  delegated\nresponsibility for solid waste management through village contracts. To ensure that O&M is\nsuccessfully  managed  by  the  village  communities,  the  Project  provides  for  community\npreparation and awareness in the formulation and implementation of the project components\nand capacity building of village communities in O&M.\n9. Public-Private Partnership\n73. Experience in private sector participation in urban service delivery in Vientiane has been\nlimited, confined to the desludging of septic tanks and solid waste management. While there\nappears to be potential for private sector participation in various stages and sets of urban\nservices (especially in O&M), a number of factors constrain outsourcing to the private sector in a\nfull scale in the near future. Experience with the private sector involvement in the solid waste\nmanagement in Vientiane indicates that the level of fees and collection efficiency is insufficient\nto allow local entrepreneurs to achieve a satisfactory level of cost-recovery. In addition, VUDAA\nat present has insufficient technical and managerial skills to undertake and supervise service\ndelivery by private contractors on a large scale. Another constraint is limited private sector\ncapacity.  Experience  with  private  sector  involvement  in  septic  tank  cleaning  reveals  the\ndetrimental effect of lack of a sound regulatory framework, with some private operators dumping\nseptage  improperly.  The  strategy  for  private  sector  participation  in  the  delivery  of  urban\nservices, therefore, requires a multipronged approach involving (i) a regulatory framework and", "21\nenforcement  capacity  that  will  protect  environmental  and  social  targets;  (ii)  technical  and\nmanagerial skills within VUDAA to effectively formulate and manage private operations; (iii)\ntransparent prequalification, tendering, and contracting processes; and (iv) implementation of\ncharges and fees at reasonable levels. It may be also necessary to assist the private sector in\ndeveloping its capabilities to take on management and operation of services. In the short term,\nthe focus will be on contracting periodic maintenance of infrastructure, followed by routine\nmaintenance in the medium term. The capacity building component will address the above\nissues in the gradual transfer of O&M activities to the private sector.\n10. Midterm Review\n74. ADB  and  AFD,  together  with  the  Government  and  in  consultation  with  urban\ncommunities, will conduct a comprehensive midterm review between two and three years from\nloan effectiveness. The review will assess the progress by the Government and VUDAA on the\nurban policy and institutional reform agenda, as agreed upon by ADB and the Government. It\nwill also assess the performance of VUDAA in improving its capacity. The project design and\nimplementation arrangements will be examined. The performance of VUDAA in addressing\nurban poverty reduction issues and in achieving progress with the introduction of participatory\nprocesses  as  part  of  the  VAI  component  will  be  assessed.  The  review  will  also  examine\ncofinancing arrangements and progress in the project components under cofinancing. Also to be\nassessed  are  the  adequacy  of  and  adherence  to  procurement  arrangements,  including\ntransparency of selection and award procedures. Further, the performance of consultants in\nproject management support and in maintaining quality standards will be reviewed. Based on all\nthese assessments, the midterm review will formulate, within the updated sector setting and\nother changing circumstances, the necessary courses of action for the Government and ADB to\nensure  successful  project  implementation  and  the  Project's  effectiveness  in  achieving  its\nobjectives.\n11. Benefit Monitoring and Implementation\n75. Benefit monitoring and evaluation (BME) will be undertaken for each project component\nto ensure that project facilities are managed efficiently, and benefits realized. The PIMU will\ndevelop  a  comprehensive  BME  system  with  assistance  from  the  project  management\nconsultants. The BME system will provide a mechanism to involve beneficiary community in\nproject  performance  monitoring  system.  Impacts  to  be  measured  are  extent  of  community\nparticipation, public accountability, transparency, levels of provision and coverage of services\n(especially  for  the  poor,  women  and  minority  groups),  opportunities  created,  and  direct\nemployment generation. An independent monitoring and evaluation of VAI will be undertaken by\nan external agency (NGO) to supplement community based monitoring and evaluation. The\nexternal  agency  will  also  independently  monitor  and  evaluate  the  implementation  of\nresettlement action pan. The PIMU is responsible for carrying out the BME activities, including\nthe establishment of benchmarks through initial baseline physical and socioeconomic surveys,\ndata  collection,  and  analysis.  The  PIMU  will  submit  a  detailed  implementation  plan  for\nmonitoring benefits and preparing benchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence\nwithin six months of loan effectiveness. Throughout project implementation, annual BME reports\nwill be submitted to ADB through the PIMU.\n12. Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n76. The  Government  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project\nimplementation  prepared  by  PIMU.  The  reports  will  particularly  address  the  policy  and\ninstitutional reform aspects and capacity building for VUDAA and will be in such form and detail", "22\nas ADB requests. The report will include information on the physical progress of works and the\nstatus of related organizational and financial issues. The PIMU will also submit to ADB, within\nthree months of the Project's physical completion, a project completion report that will give the\ndetails of project implementation, cost, BME activities, and other relevant information.\n77. The  project  director  will  establish  and  maintain  accounts  and  records  to  facilitate\nidentification of income and expenditure related to the Project. The director will be assisted by\nan adequate number of suitably qualified accounting staff, including a financial manager in the\nPIMU. All accounts and statements of expenditures and revenues related to the Project will be\naudited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB. VUDAA\u2019s annual financial statements together\nwith audited project accounts and reports will be submitted to ADB within nine months of the\nclose of the financial year.\nE. Social and Environmental Measures\n78. The Project has been prepared with extensive participation of stakeholders at all levels;\nbeneficiaries especially the poor men and women, and affected people; village, district, and\nPrefecture  representatives;  relevant  ministries;  the  private  sector;  and  NGOs  and  mass\norganizations and aid agencies. Further, a participatory poverty assessment, conducted under\nthe project preparatory TA, provided a thorough understanding of the nature of poverty, and\ninfluenced the prioritization and evaluation of the project components as well as the processes\nto adopt during implementation. The Project will address the priority needs of the poor, both\ndirectly  and  indirectly.  The  Project  approach  in  addressing  social  and  poverty  issues  and\neffective  targeting  of  the  poor  and  the  disadvantaged  includes  (i)  maximizing  the  direct\nbeneficiaries of urban infrastructure and services by linking primary and secondary with tertiary\ninfrastructure; (ii) a gradation of services providing a range of options affordable to various\nincome groups, especially the poor; (iii) prioritizing villages with higher levels of poverty for\ninclusion in the VAI component; (iv) integrating social components and skills with physical\ncomponents and elements of the Project; and (v) assigning a major role to village organizations\nand  communities  in  planning  and  implementation  of  VAI,  and  enhancing  the  capacity  of\nstakeholders at all levels \u2013 VUDAA, villages, and communities \u2013 in participatory planning and\nmanagement techniques.\n79. The VAI component will incorporate mechanisms to address the specific needs of the\npoor and reinforce the role of women as primary users and managers of urban environmental\nservices. The mechanisms include (i) stipulating the direct participation and representation of\nthe poor and women in village-based decision making; (ii) forming poor- and women-only focus\ngroups in participatory village appraisal of the subprojects and leadership training; (iii) targeting\nthe  poor  and  women  in  sanitation  and  solid-waste  management  subcomponents  and\nenvironmental and health awareness; (iv) safeguarding against forced eviction through a village\nmonitoring  and  grievance  mechanism;  (v)  giving  priority  to  the  poor  in  hired  laborers  in\nconstruction activities; (vi) where necessary, linking the training of women to land rights in the\nLand Titling Project; (vii) where needed, orientation of the poor and women for microfinance\nunder the UNCDF-supported Microfinance and Sustainable Livelihood Project; (viii) training key\nVUDAA staff and village authorities in pro-poor management and gender awareness; and (ix) a\ncommunity-based participatory monitoring, using simple indicators identified by the community,\nand a complementary independent impact monitoring to be undertaken by a suitably skilled\nNGO. The existing structure of the Lao Women's Union (LWU) in villages will also be used to\nachieve the social strategy. The Project will provide inputs required to successfully implement\nthe  social  strategy  and  the  resettlement  action  plan  by  recruiting  community  development\nspecialists, a gender specialist, and a resettlement expert. The poverty and social issues and\nthe strategy are described fully in Appendix 10.", "23\n80. The initial screening of potential environmental impacts indicates that the Project will not\naffect environmentally sensitive areas, nor will it cause large-scale changes in the physical,\nbiological, or social environment. Further, the proposed physical works are limited in scope, and\nconcern mainly the improvement of existing facilities, drainage channels, and roads. Indeed, the\nmajority of the project components will bring clear environmental benefits. Anticipated adverse\nimpacts during construction are not significant where (i) long-term benefits to society exceed\nshort-term costs, and (ii) appropriate mitigation measures are applied. The Project is classified\nin environmental category B, and a summary initial environmental examination is presented in\nAppendix 11.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n81. The proposed Project will benefit about 162,000 residents of the Vientiane urban area\nthrough improved urban environment and living conditions resulting from upgraded roads and\ndrainage,  improved  traffic  management  and  road  safety,  wider  coverage  of  solid  waste\ncollection, and improved sanitation conditions. The economy will benefit from increased urban\nefficiency as the project interventions will mitigate disruptions to urban economy caused by poor\nroad and traffic conditions, constant flooding and damage to urban assets, and inadequate\nurban services. Urban poverty will be reduced by providing basic infrastructure and services for\nthe poor and a social strategy with inclusive processes incorporated into the Project. The\nProject will directly improve the living conditions of 81,000 urban residents through village area\nimprovements, a partially coincident 60,000 people through drainage improvements, and about\n16,000 people through improved solid waste collection and disposal. The general population\nand the economy will gain because the increased capacity of VUDAA will result in sustainable\nimprovements to the urban environment and effective delivery of services. The Project's support\nfor decentralized urban governance and participatory management and empowerment of village\ncommunities in local planning and service delivery will lead to responsive urban governance\nwith a greater concern for the needs of the urban poor.\n82. More  specifically,  the  Project  will  contribute  to  (i)  reduced  damage,  disruption,  and\ndetrimental health impacts from localized flooding; (ii) reduced dust from traffic on local roads\nand lower vehicle operating costs on local, secondary, and primary roads; (iii) reduced deaths\nand injury from road accidents; (iv) improved environmental and health outcomes from solid\nwaste  collection  and  disposal,  and  sanitation  improvements;  (v)  increased  community\nawareness  of  environmental  health,  and  enhanced  village  capacities  in  local  planning,\nimplementation and O&M of local infrastructure, with focus on the urban poor; and (vi) improved\nplanning,  development  control,  environmental  and  cultural  sustainability,  and  sustainable\nservice delivery through enhanced capacity of VUDAA in urban management and local resource\nmobilization.\nA. Economic and Financial Analyses\n83. Economic  and  financial  analyses  of  the  proposed  subprojects  were  prepared  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban\nDevelopment Sector Projects. The results are in Appendix 12. The overall economic internal\nrates of return (EIRR) for seven typical road subprojects, which account for 41 percent of the\ntotal cost of the roads component, is 24.2 percent. The EIRR for the individual subprojects\nrange from 12.4 to 41.4 percent, with the lowest EIRR occurring for a subproject to construct a\nnew section of road for which the benefits to the network as a whole are not fully reflected in the\nevaluation. The roads component is robust, and will remain viable even with a 105 percent rise\nin costs or a 51 percent decline in benefits.", "24\n84. The overall EIRR for the storm water drainage component is 11.9 percent based on\nsavings in damage to private buildings and property. Additional unquantified benefits include (i)\nreduced damage to motor vehicles and public infrastructure such as roads; (ii) reduced loss of\npersonal income when employment is disrupted; (iii) improved conditions with avoided flooding\nof sanitary systems and spread of raw and partially treated sewage and sullage with rainwater\ninto residential areas; and (iv) reduced disruption to personal and community life caused by the\nslow dispersal of storm water. These benefits will ensure that the overall economic benefit of the\ncomponent is higher than that indicated by the economic evaluation. The drainage subprojects\nwill be especially beneficial to the poor, who are more likely to live in lower-lying land that is\nmore subject to flooding.\n85. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the solid waste component is 13.4 percent\nbased on incremental costs and revenue, and using recently approved user fees, which rise by\n3 percent per annum in real terms (similar to growth in real income). The security of the benefits\nis high, as the Project will enable services to continue in an existing area where services will\notherwise be withdrawn due to inadequate equipment. Based on the average quantity of waste,\nuser fees are equal to 3.3 percent of the 25th percentile household income and 1.4 percent of\naverage household income. However, the burden on low-income households is reduced as they\ngenerate less waste and find more economical means for disposing of waste to reduce costs.\nThere remains pressure on the urban poor to avoid the cost of solid waste disposal by burning\nand dumping rubbish, with negative environmental consequences. The community preparation\nand awareness to be undertaken under VAI, and increasing the use of village-based solid waste\ncollection contracts, will assist communities to implement measures to avoid such ways of\ndisposal.\n86. The sensitivity of the solid waste management component FIRR to adverse changes\nwas tested. The key variables include (i) increases in capital and O&M costs, (ii) decrease in\nrevenues, (iii) a combination of decreased revenue and increased cost, and (iv) one-year delay\nin project completion. The FIRR is most sensitive to reduced revenues. Revenues may be lower\nthan that forecast because of failure to increase rates to the proposed levels (Appendix 12).\n87. VAI will (i) reduce flooding, and hence reduce property and livelihood damage, loss of\nincome, and spread of sewage and sullage with implications for improved health, wellbeing, and\nquality of life; (ii) improve sanitation and collection of solid waste with resulting benefits to public\nhealth and the local environment; (iii) improve the accessibility of transport and access of\npeople, especially the poor, to vital urban facilities; (iv) reduce dust by developing tertiary roads\nand sealing local roads; (v) create synergies of and maximize benefits from improvements to a\nrange of community infrastructure and services, which are inextricably linked; and (vi) increase\ncommunity awareness of health and environment linkages and participation in local planning\nand project implementation and O&M. The component has a particular focus on involving low-\nincome households and meeting their needs. The average cost of VAI is $52 per capita, and\ncommunities  will  meet  10  percent  of  the  cost  of  physical  works  from  cash  and  in-kind\ncontributions, with the financial cost of the community\u2019s contribution to the component being\nequal to 0.4 percent of the average household income over the course of a year. Community\nleaders will levy the contribution on local businesses and households according to their financial\ncapacity, to reduce the financial cost to low-income households. The emphasis on community\nparticipation and social equity will ensure that the improvements meet locally prioritized needs in\nthe most effective manner.\n88. Street lighting is a public good with substantial benefits for the community, including (i) a\ndecline in the number and severity of road vehicle accidents at night, especially those involving", "25\npedestrians;  (ii)  reduced  travel  time  and  vehicle  operating  costs  for  motorists;  (iii)  fewer\naccidents, greater convenience and enhanced personal security for pedestrians using footpaths;\nand (iv) increased opportunity for social and business activity. The benefits of street lighting and\nits current limited presence mean that the marginal benefit to be gained from its provision is\ngreater than would be if street lighting were more extensive at present. The benefit from the\nstreet lighting program will be maximized by prioritizing the locations where lights are to be\ninstalled during project implementation, using a multicriteria assessment that takes into account\nthe volume of traffic, number of traffic accidents, and quality of footpaths.\n89. Installation of traffic signals, improved road signage, better traffic enforcement, and\ntraffic safety education respond to traffic growth, poor traffic management, and deteriorating\nroad safety in Vientiane. The number of fatalities and injuries is rising at more than double the\nrate of growth in the number of vehicles over the last decade, and is higher than in countries\nsuch  as  Thailand  and  Indonesia.  The  benefits  from  the  traffic  management  and  safety\ncomponent will include (i) fewer and less severe road accidents, (ii) reduced vehicle operating\ncosts resulting from improved traffic flow, and (iii) increased effective capacity of the road\nsystem. Traffic accidents in Vientiane are concentrated in certain areas (33 of the 106 deaths in\n1999 occurred at 13 intersections), and so should respond to a focused traffic management\nstrategy. Benefits from the traffic management strategy will be maximized by prioritizing the\nlocation of measures to be implemented on the basis of the volume of traffic and the number of\ntraffic accidents.\n90. Both  VUDAA  and  the  private  sector  have  currently  limited  technical  capacity  and\nexperience in contracting routine maintenance of public infrastructure. The provision of basic\nmaintenance equipment for VUDAA is justified by the need to develop VUDAA\u2019s technical\ncapacity for maintenance and to provide benchmark costs for maintenance activities, which will\nform the basis for subsequent contracting out of such services to the private sector. The\ncapacity building component of the Project will develop and implement a strategy for the gradual\ntransfer of maintenance activities to the private sector.\n1. Financial Projections for VUDAA\n91. VUDMC was replaced by VUDAA in February 1999 with the power to collect solid waste\nand  sanitation  charges,  and  building  permit  and  parking  fees.  Solid  waste  and  sanitation\nservices have been operated as a separate enterprise but at a loss, and revenue from other\nfees has been modest. However, Decision 1804 issued by the governor of Vientiane Prefecture\nin December 2000, provides VUDAA with significant revenue-raising powers. The decision\nauthorized VUDAA to collect (i) fees for building permits and signboards, and lease of public\nplaces; (ii) user charges, including solid waste collection, sanitation services, parking fees, a\nsurcharge on the water bill for drainage maintenance, and a surcharge on the electricity bill to\npay for public lighting maintenance; and (iii) urban obligation fees, including an annual tax\nrelated to the value of buildings, a surcharge on gasoline and diesel, business taxes including a\ncharge on hotels and guesthouses, and a charge for households that do not avail themselves of\nsolid waste collection services. The decision specified the level of charges, and set higher rates\nfor revenue from sources already available to VUDAA. The governor's decision was confirmed\nwith a PM's Decision on 26 April 2001 to ensure that the income, to be generated through water\nand electricity surcharges, will be made available to VUDAA. VUDAA has started to implement\nthese new charges. There is need to establish procedures to efficiently and effectively assess,\nimpose, and collect the income, and to gain community acceptance of the charges.\n92. Decision  1804  provides  a  sound  basis  for  future  resource  mobilization  by  VUDAA\nthrough a limited number of income sources with generally low administration costs and the", "26\npotential to generate substantial revenue. The capacity building component will enable VUDAA\nto levy and collect the revenue and undertake a continuing review of the charges. Full and\neffective  application  of  the  new  charges  will  require  political  and  community  support,  and\nsupport from Vientiane Prefecture and the Government. The decision allows the solid waste and\nsanitation service to be undertaken on a full cost recovery basis and other revenue of VUDAA to\nrise from the present KN150 million per year to, in constant prices, KN3 billion in 2004 and KN5\nbillion in 2006, given the improvements in coverage, collection efficiency, and ongoing real rises\nin the level of charges.\n93. Financial projections for VUDAA are based on (i) expected income from current sources\nand from new sources recently granted to VUDAA, allowing for a gradual rise in coverage and\ncollection efficiency, and the real level of fees to rise by 10 percent per annum up to 2006; (ii)\nincome for solid waste management and sanitation services to rise by 3 percent per annum\nfrom recently approved fees to fully recover the cost of providing solid waste management and\nsanitation; (iii) an average 8 percent per annum real rise in expenditure to allow VUDAA to fulfill\nits functions, including O&M for existing infrastructure and for infrastructure to be provided under\nthe Project; (iv) VUDAA financing an average of 8.6 percent of the cost of the Project through\nsubloans, with the subloans having an interest rate of 6.7 percent, based on the interest rate on\nthe loan, forecast exchange risk, and management costs and repayment period of 15 years\nincluding a 3-year grace period; and (v) Vientiane Prefecture and the Government meeting\nfinancing gaps.\n94. The  financial  forecasts  for  VUDAA  indicate  that  there  is  potential  \u2013  with  sufficient\npolitical,  institutional,  and  community  support  and  development  of  VUDAA\u2019s  capacity  \u2013  to\ngenerate adequate resources from the revenue base provided to VUDAA to meet its future\nobligations for service provision. More specifically, the forecasts indicate that (i) VUDAA will be\nable  to  meet  at  least  50  percent  of  the  direct  cost  incurred  in  providing  services  and  in\nundertaking adequate O&M by 2003, and 100 percent by 2006, (ii) improvements in coverage\nand efficiency of solid waste operations will enable future investments in assets for replacing\nand upgrading, to be financed from its own resources; (iii) debt coverage is very high, reflecting\nthe small level of debt relative to the substantial revenue base; and (iv) VUDAA will continue to\nneed some financial support from the Vientiane Prefecture and the Government. VUDAA is a\nrelatively new organization that was only recently provided with a substantial revenue base.\nWhile it has begun to implement its new revenue generating powers, VUDAA still has the\nconsiderable task of fully implementing Decision 1804 and achieving continuing rises in real\nincome, adequate O&M of assets, and effective management of its income and expenditure.\nTapping the revenue sources, provided to VUDAA in Decision 1804, forms the major element of\nthe urban policy and institutional reform agenda linked to the Project and the associated loan\ncovenants. The capacity building component will support VUDAA in implementing resource\nmobilization reforms and reduce the institutional risk to the financial forecasts.\n2. Cost Recovery, Subsidies, and Sustainability\n95. A national expenditure and consumption survey in 1997 and early 1998 indicated that\n16.7 percent of the urban population in Vientiane is below the poverty line, based on the\nequivalent  income  needed  to  purchase  2,100  calories  per  person  per  day  plus  some\nexpenditure for nonfood items. Expressing this amount in current prices is susceptible to error,\ngiven the rapid subsequent inflation, e.g., 142 percent in 1998 and 108 percent in 1999. The\npresent poverty line is estimated to be between about KN150,000-190,000 per household per\nmonth,  with  the  25th  percentile  monthly  household  income  at  about  KN310,000  ($38)  and\naverage monthly household income about KN730,000 ($89). Households at the lower end of the\nrange typically spend about 55 percent of their income on food; 10 percent on utility services", "27\n(water, solid waste collection, and electricity); 20 percent on rent, health, and education; and 15\npercent on other items.\n96. Investments under the Project and revenue generation by VUDAA will require imposition\nof  additional  and  higher  user  charges  and  taxes  on  the  public.  These  include  lump  sum\nsurcharges on water and electricity, higher fees for solid waste collection and disposal, and a\nproposed community contribution to the cost of VAI. The burden of these charges on the poor is\nmitigated by present community practices such as willingness of community leaders to take\naccount of the ability to pay when imposing charges, with in-kind contributions to be accepted\nunder VAI. The community contribution to VAI is estimated at 0.5 percent of the 25th percentile\nhousehold income and 0.2 percent of households at the poverty line over the duration of the\nsubproject after allowing for greater contribution of labor by lower income households. The cost\nof the additional utility charges will, in aggregate, be equal to an average of about 1.7 percent of\nthe 25th percentile household income and 1.4 percent for households at the poverty line. The\nlower share for households on the poverty line is due to lower consumption. The charges are\nacceptable, provided that the structure of the charges is reviewed to minimize the impact on the\npoor by using progressive rates. The capacity building component will address this matter.\n97. Solid waste collection and disposal is the only project component that has a direct\nmeans for cost recovery, and has the potential to achieve full cost recovery during the project\nimplementation  period.  This  will  ensure  that  the  service  is  sustainable,  does  not  compete\nunfairly with potential competitive private sector services, and could be privatized or contracted\nout at some future date.\n98. The provision of 90 percent of the cost of the projects as a grant to beneficiaries is\njustified by (i) the public good features and positive externalities of the project components, (ii)\nthe potential for an improved urban environment and more efficient urban system to indirectly\ngenerate additional revenue for VUDAA and the Government, and (iii) the objective of improving\nconditions for the poor whose income is severely limited. VUDAA will need financial support\nfrom the Government and Vientiane Prefecture to implement the Project and to contribute to its\ngeneral administration costs. This support is justified by the early stage of development of an\nurban administration authority in the Lao PDR and the greater revenue-raising power of the\nGovernment, and is complemented by a substantial capacity building program for revenue\nenhancement and improved O&M for VUDAA to establish the basis for a self-financing authority\nin the longer term.\n99. Project sustainability will be facilitated by (i) community involvement in identification,\nimplementation,  and  O&M  of  VAI,  and  greater  involvement  of  and  consultation  with  the\ncommunity regarding other infrastructure development; (ii) resource mobilization by VUDAA to\nprovide funding for O&M of infrastructure and services, and for replacement of current assets\nused for solid waste collection and disposal; (iii) the provision of basic maintenance equipment\nto  VUDAA;  and  (iv)  the  capacity  building  component  that  will  develop  and  implement  a\nmaintenance strategy, including that for privatized maintenance.\nB.  Environment and Social Dimensions\n100. The initial environmental examination indicates that the impacts of the Project will (i) not\ninvolve the accelerated use of scarce resources and will in the long term contribute to their more\nefficient use by improving the efficiency of the urban system, (ii) have a neutral impact on the\necology of the impact area, (iii) have a significantly positive impact on the physical environment,\nand (iv) have a beneficial effect on the physical and socioeconomic well-being of the urban\npopulation through enhancement of the physical environment. Negative environmental impacts", "28\nsuch as removal of a limited number of trees, dust, water contamination, and disruptions during\nconstruction  can  be  minimized  with  remedial  measures  such  as  revegetation,  training,\nconstruction planning, and community consultation, for which allowance has been made in the\ncost of the Project. The long-term environmental benefits of the Project depend on proper O&M\nof the completed investments. Therefore, the Project has provided for the purchase of basic\nmaintenance equipment, measures for community involvement, and building the capacity of\nVUDAA for maintenance.\n101. The  Project  will  improve  the  living  conditions  of  the  urban  residents,  the  local\nenvironment, and the infrastructure and services needed by households and businesses in the\nVientiane urban area. Beneficiaries include (i) direct beneficiaries of improvements, including\npeople who (a) use new and upgraded infrastructure and services such as improved roads and\nsolid waste services; (b) benefit from the improved infrastructure and services that result in\nreduced flooding, less dust from unsealed roads, and the avoided cost and trauma of traffic\naccidents;  and  (c)  benefit  from  empowerment  and  involvement  through  the  community\npreparation  and  awareness  program;  and  (ii)  indirect  beneficiaries  who  gain  from  (a)  an\nimproved quality of life resulting from the improved urban environment, (b) the economic growth\nthat will be fostered by improvements in infrastructure and services, and (c) sustained and\nequitable improvements to the urban living conditions resulting from project interventions for\neffective and responsive urban governance. The involvement of the communities in project\nimplementation will complement and reinforce the immediate economic and health benefits\nassociated  with  the  local  road,  drainage,  sanitation,  solid  waste  management,  and  traffic\nmanagement components by ensuring sustainability and a sense of ownership.\n102. About 18 percent of the population of the Vientiane urban area, or 30,000 people can be\ndefined as very poor on the basis of their limited income. These people incur a multiplicity of\nproblems such as inability to afford three meals per day, limited intake of protein, children\ngenerally  leaving  school  after  reaching  12  years  of  age,  and  most  importantly,  the\nconsequences of living in low-lying areas that are acutely underserved, and subject to flooding\nand consequent environmental and health problems. The VAI component will directly benefit\napproximately  15,000  poor  people  while  30,000  poor  will  benefit  indirectly  from  citywide\nimprovements. The Project will provide a range of infrastructure and services (i) that the poor,\nthrough a participatory poverty assessment, unanimously indicated as the highest priorities; in\nparticular poor drainage and access that has imposed limitations on their livelihoods, health,\nand the quality of life, (ii) that will improve inadequate solid waste collection systems and\nsanitation that are grossly inadequate in areas where the poor live, and (iii) that will offer a\nrange of service levels affordable to various low-income groups. The community preparation\nand awareness program under VAI will maximize the benefits from physical improvements by (i)\nfurthering the concern of community leaders for the needs of the poor and improving their\ncommunities; (ii) promoting understanding of the importance of environmental health among the\npoor and women, and stimulating the demand for environmental improvements; and (iii) building\nthe capacity of village communities in participatory processes, which will ensure that the needs\nof the poor and vulnerable are addressed and potential adverse effects are mitigated. The\ncommunity preparation and awareness program will also allow concerns about project impacts\nto be addressed in the design and implementation of improvements, including mechanisms to\nensure that the concern and interests of women are taken into account.\n103. The Project's design minimized the acquisition of land and relocation and resettlement of\nhouseholds. 89 households will be affected by full or partial loss of their property most of which\nare outhouses rather than main dwellings. Only 6 households will be relocated. The affected\nhouseholds will receive replacement land or cash for loss of land and immovable assets, and be\nalso compensated for loss of business and livelihood. No encroachers or squatters were found", "29\nin the affected areas, and most of the affected people are relatively well off. The resettlement\naction plan, prepared in accordance with policies and practices of the Lao PDR and ADB's\nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement, provides a clear compensation framework, cost estimates,\nimplementation arrangements, and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.\nC.  Project Risks\n104. Potential risks associated with the Project include (i) legal inconsistencies relating to the\nstructure of urban governance and a level of uncertainty resulting from the use of decrees as a\nmeans for implementing reforms in the urban sector, (ii) inadequate rates for user charges and\nfees and poor cost recovery and limited capacity of VUDAA to undertake its assigned functions\nand implement new revenue raising powers, (iii) lack of experience on the acceptability of urban\nfees and charges and perceived low willingness of community to pay for urban services, and (iv)\ninadequate experience and capacity of VUDAA and village communities in participatory project\nplanning and implementation.\n105. To mitigate these risks, the Project has devised a strategy, reflected in the urban policy\nand institutional reform agenda and the corresponding project assistance under the capacity\nbuilding component. The Project will support the Government's ongoing efforts for legal reforms.\nThe limitations relating to cost recovery and local revenues and technical capacity of VUDAA\nconstitute an important element of the reform agenda and the focus of project assistance\nthrough the capacity building component. The risk relating to the limited experience of VUDAA\nand village communities in participatory project implementation will be mitigated by an extensive\ncommunity  preparation  and  awareness  program  that  seeks  building  the  capacities  of  the\ncommunities and VUDAA in community-based decision making and implementation of urban\ninfrastructure and services. The issue of the perceived low willingness to pay for the services\nwill also be addressed by the community preparation and awareness program that will promote\ncommunity understanding of the cost implications of the services and the consequent public\nsupport for user charges and fees.\nVI.

Background\n1. This  Appendix  is  a  summary  of  the  implementation  framework  for  the  village  area\nimprovements (VAI) component under the part B. VAI is designed to (i) extend to the community\nbenefits from primary infrastructure by linking it to secondary- and tertiary-level infrastructure;\n(ii) apply a demand-led approach based on community participation and contribution to better\nreflect diverse community needs and forge a sense of community ownership; (iii) combine a\nsocial component i.e., community preparation and awareness raising with physical infrastructure\nand service improvements to create a demand for improvements, better target the poor, elicit\ncommunity  support  for  resource  mobilization,  and  ensure  sustainable  urban  infrastructure\nmanagement, and (iv) contribute to the institutionalization of participatory and responsive urban\nmanagement within VUDAA.\n2. VAI comprises (i) community infrastructure and services and (ii) community preparation\nand  awareness  program.  Community  infrastructure  and  services  include  (i)  tertiary  access\nroads  and  footpaths,  (ii)  surface  water  drainage,  (iii)  sanitation\u2014improvements  of  on-plot\nfacilities, and (iv) solid waste management\u2014community-based collection and concentration and\nother minor works to be identified based on the participatory selection process. The community\npreparation  and  awareness  program  includes  (i)  awareness  raising  on  public  health  and\nenvironmental management and sanitation through community-based training and media-based\npublicity  campaign,  and  (ii)  building  the  capacity  of  VUDAA,  villages,  and  communities  in\ncommunity-based  local  planning,  infrastructure  and  service  delivery,  community-based\ncontracting  (where  necessary),  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and  monitoring  and\nevaluation. Capacity building activities also cover leadership training for women and the poor\nand,  where  needs  exist,  orientation  for  microfinance  that  will  be  available  under  the\nMicrofinance  and  Sustainable  Livelihood  Project  supported  by  the  United  Nations  Capital\nDevelopment Fund (UNCDF).\nB. Program Approach\n3. VAI adopts a demand-led, sector program approach, taking the village as the unit for the\ncommunity/tertiary-level infrastructure improvements. The VAI process incorporates (i) a high\nlevel of community involvement in decision making, and (ii) a community contribution to ensure\nthat improvements match community requirements and benefit from community commitment.\nStarting with two pilot villages, the program will be built up to cover up to 12 new villages a year.\nThree  additional  villages  are  anticipated  to  be  admitted  to  form  the  first  year\u2019s  program;\nthereafter, villages will compete for places in each subsequent year\u2019s annual program. Most\nvillages are expected to apply for inclusion, and about 50 of VUDAA\u2019s 100 villages are likely to\nbenefit from the program.\nC. General Principles\n4. Although VAI adopts a demand-led approach, the villages applying for inclusion in the\nVAI program will have to accept and adhere to three general guiding principles: (i) community\nparticipation  and  joint  decision  making,  especially  by  the  poor  and  women,  in  planning,\ncomponent  selection,  implementation  arrangements,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (ii)\ntransparency and accountability; and (iii) commitment to cost sharing and participation in O&M.", "Appendix 4, page 2\n43\nD. Specific Conditions\n5. While  the  implementation  arrangements  for  VAI  should  be  flexible  to  reflect  local\nconditions, the participating villages will have to accept and adhere to some specific conditions.\n1. Participatory Learning and Action Appraisal (PLAA)\n6. Village-based planning and design will be carried out through the process of PLAA, to\nensure consensus building among villagers from all socioeconomic groups. Selected villagers,\nincluding those who usually have not been involved in village-level decision-making (such as\nnon-officeholders), will be trained in PLAA by Project Management and Implementation Unit\n(PIMU)/VAI staff and will act as facilitators for this process.\n2.  VAI Committee\n7. VAI will start initially from the existing village organization structure.  However, at the end\nof the initial priority formulation by the villagers, a VAI committee will be established among\nthose who will be directly involved in VAI. The committee will comprise the village chief, one\naccountant,  one  technical  counterpart,  and  two  representatives  from  each  physical\nsubcomponent.  Opportunities  should  be  provided  for  those  who  are  not  currently  village\nofficeholders. The Committee will be responsible for monitoring and informing the villagers of\nthe progress and outcomes of VAI and getting their feedback for remedial actions. It will also be\nresponsible for communicating with PIMU/VAI and other relevant parties as necessary.\n3.  Participation of Women and the Poor\n8. At least 40 percent of the VAI committee members will be women, while representation\nof the poor will be at least proportionate to the percentage of the poor in each participating\nvillage.1 At least one representative of the sanitation subcomponent will be the poor as this\nsubcomponent targets the poor households. This participation rule will apply to all activities,\nincluding PLAA meetings, representation in the initial resource persons, individuals directly\ninvolved, and monitoring and evaluation activities. The representation of the poor in paid-labor\nopportunities and in the sanitation subcomponent should be much higher, as these activities will\ntarget the poor. Some training such as solid waste management may specifically target women.\n4. Focus on Sanitation\n9. The  importance  of  sanitation  is  largely  unrecognized  but  recognition  is  clearly\nnecessary. The participating village will be required to receive training and be involved in\nawareness campaign on public health and environmental management before finalizing its\npriorities for VAI. The village will also need to understand that targeting the poor households for\nsanitation will benefit the whole community.\n5. Village Contribution\n10. At least 10 percent of the VAI cost in each village will be covered by the community\nmembers in cash or in kind, e.g., materials, labor, supervision of works (initial discussions\nindicate up to 20 percent is acceptable to village heads depending on the wealth of the village).\nThe  share  of  individual  households  will  be  decided  by  a  village  consensus,  according  to\n                                                \n1 Each village keeps the number of the poor households based on criteria provided by Vientiane Prefecture.", "Appendix 4, page 3\n44\nwillingness and ability to pay or contribute. The poor should be exempt from cash contribution.\nThe process of decision making and the individual shares will be documented. The funds\ngenerated  through  community  contribution  will  be  used  only  to  fund  on-site  sanitation\nimprovements for the poor, and not for any other on-site improvement.\n6. Operation and Maintenance\n11. To  ensure  the  sustainability  of  infrastructure,  the  village  will  commit  to  undertake\nmaintenance  of  the  infrastructure  developed.  This  will  be  monitored  both  by  the  village\nmembers themselves and PIMU/VAI.\n 7. Administration Cost and Procurement\n12. Up to 5 percent of the overall VAI budget can be used to cover the costs borne by the\nvillagers  in  relation  to  planning,  designing,  implementing,  supervision,  and  monitoring  and\nevaluation (this will be reviewed during the implementation of first-year batch of five villages and\nbe revised as appropriate with the approval of the Asian Development Bank [ADB]). The VAI\ncommittee will keep accounts for all such expenditures and make them accessible to villagers.\nImplementation arrangements will involve local competitive bidding using local contractors and\ncommunity labor, and where appropriate community participation in procurement will be applied,\ninitially on a pilot basis due to the limited experience of this approach in the Lao PDR.\n8.  Land Acquisition or Negative Environmental Impact\n13. The  infrastructure  identified  will  not  involve  displacement  of  private  assets  at  a\nsignificant level, land acquisition, and significant adverse environmental impact.  All the land\nnecessary  for  the  proposed  infrastructure  will  come  from  either  government  land  or  the\ncontribution  of  participating  households,  in  which  case  signatures  of  agreement  by  all\ncontributors will be submitted to the village chief. However, if the land required for the proposed\ninfrastructure is of a significant size as to disrupt the livelihood of individual households, or if\nthere are any encumbrances, the PIMU will be consulted to make a final decision. If it is decided\nthat the proposed works should proceed through expropriation, the affected households will be\ncompensated at full replacement value in accordance with the Project\u2019s resettlement action plan\ndeveloped for Part A, which requires close supervision by PIMU.  PIMU will inform ADB on a\nno-objection basis.\n9.  Displacement of Landless Tenants\n14. The benefits of VAI will not materialize for the poor unless the latter are free from the\nfear  of  being  displaced.  The  village-based  monitoring  and  external  monitoring  by  an\nindependent third party will make sure that this will not happen. Individuals will address their\ngrievance to the village chief who may then communicate the grievance (if not resolved) to\nPIMU. A baseline on the landless poor will be established at the outset of VAI in each village.\nE. Framework for VAI Implementation\n15. The following steps will be followed in implementing the VAI subprojects. They may be\nreviewed and modified by PIMU as it acquires more experience in the program.\n1. Village Selection\n16. While fundamentally the VAI program will be demand-led, with villages admitted to the\nprogram based on a strong commitment, applicant villages will be selected on the basis of a set", "Appendix 4, page 4\n45\nof procedures and a series of eligibility criteria. It appears that most villages within the Vientiane\nurban area will apply for inclusion in the program. PIMU will select for inclusion about five\nvillages for the first year, and thereafter about 12 villages per annum. Priority for early inclusion\nwill initially be based on the following criteria: (i) incidence of infectious diseases; (ii) quality and\ncoverage of existing drainage; (iii) incidence of flooding; (iv) quality of access; (v) incidence of\nsanitation problems; (vi) socioeconomic conditions, especially the prevalence and depth of\npoverty;  (vii)  extent  of  demand  as  expressed  by  the  commitment  of  village  heads  and\ncommittees to project participation and extent of problems identified; (viii) beneficiary of the land\ntitling project supported by the World Bank and Australian Agency for International Development\n(as area improvement without secure and clear land use rights may cause problems); (ix)\nnearness  to  the  trunk  infrastructure  from  which  villages  can  be  served;  and  (x)  revenue\ncollection efficiency, as expressed by village performance in the mandated local collection of\nvillage taxes. The selection criteria will be further developed during the early stages of VAI\nimplementation, but will likely include a number of physical and social aspects.\n2. Outline Procedure for VAI Implementation\n17. In outline, the VAI implementation procedure will involve (i) orientation of the Social\nAction Unit and other divisions within VUDAA by PIMU consultants (community development\nand gender specialists and community preparation and awareness experts), and assignment of\nengineers and social staff (4 engineers and 4 social experts) to work directly with PIMU for the\nVAI component, and further orientation/training of the assigned staff for the operation of VAI; (ii)\na briefing by PIMU/VAI to village chiefs on the nature, potential scope, principles and conditions,\nand criteria for inclusion in the VAI program; (iii) a series of village-level meetings to introduce\nthe  nature,  objective,  scope,  potential  benefits  from  environmental  improvements,  cost\nimplications,  requirement  of  community  contribution,  general  principles  and  conditions  and\napproach of the VAI Program; (iv) receipt of applications from villages and selection of the first\ngroup of villages in the annual program; (v) village-based priority formulation by the selected\nvillages through use of PLAA and submission of village proposal outline to PIMU; and (vi) full-\nfledged village-based appraisal and submission of final village proposal to PIMU. The details of\nvillage-based priority formulation and full-fledged appraisal follow.\na. Village-Based Priority Formulation\n18. In each village included in the annual program, the following PLAA activities will take\nplace for about two months.2\n(i)  Orienting  villagers  to  the  VAI.  The  first  orientation  will  be  conducted  in  the  village\nmeeting attended by the village chief and deputy chiefs; representatives from the Lao\nWomen\u2019s  Union,  the  Lao  Youth  Union,  and  the  Lao  Front;  representatives  from\nhousehold clusters; representatives of the poor in the respective villages, and other\ninterested individuals. Cluster chiefs will then brief individual households on VAI. This\nwill be accompanied by media-based information dissemination, e.g., posters, radio,\nnewspapers  to  be  carried  out  by  PIMU  assisted  by  community  preparation  and\nawareness experts.\n                                                \n2  Two pilot villages of Ban Fay and Ban Savang were selected. They have completed the village proposal outline,\nand will be included in the first year program. The cost estimate is $102,465 and $61,680, respectively. However,\nmore extensive PLAA and training are required for detailed planning and design.", "Appendix 4, page 5\n46\n(ii) Signing a memorandum of understanding (MOU). After the orientation and information\ndissemination, at least one village-wide meeting will be held to decide whether the\nconcerned village is willing to participate in the VAI program and to accept the principles\nand conditions. If participation is decided, an MOU will be signed by the village chief and\nPIMU within 30 days from the first orientation meeting.\n(iii) Selecting initial resource persons to represent all the household clusters. The number\nmay be 15 to 20 - at least 40 percent are women - depending on the size of the village.\nOpportunities should be given to those who are not currently village officeholders. The\npoor should be represented among the resource persons at least at the rate equivalent\nto the village\u2019s poverty incidence.\n(iv) Training selected resource persons on PLAA. Training will cover participatory planning,\nleadership, gender sensitization, and public health/environmental management, carried\nout by community preparation and awareness experts.\n(v) Village-based priority formulation through PLAA. PLAA will also collect simple baseline\ninformation on the major problems and socioeconomic situation of villagers for the use in\nfuture impact monitoring. Village mapping and mapping of the poor will be carried out.\nAt the predesign phase of the chosen subproject components, the direct beneficiaries\nwill work closely with PIMU/VAI, especially in survey activities, to ensure that the design\nmeets their needs.\n(vi) Finalizing village proposal outline based on PLAA results and village consensus. The\nProposal  will  have  a  shortlist  of  physical  subcomponents,  justification  for  each\ncomponent, including who will benefit and how, rough cost estimates, and the names of\nthose directly involved in each subcomponent. The PIMU/VAI will help in preparing the\nproposal and will have a transparent process for subproject approval, which will be\ndisseminated to participating villages and communities.\n(vii) Submitting the village proposal outline to PIMU/VAI for review. PIMU/VAI staff, based on\nthe  proposals,  will  identify  and  plan  the  technical  inputs  required  for  full-fledged\nappraisal in each village.\nb. Full-Fledged Village-Based Appraisal\n19. Further planning and design will be carried out in each village according to the following\nsteps. The process may take about four months on average.\n(i)  Establishing the VAI Committee.  Among the names of participants identified in the\nvillage proposal outline, and following the participation rule, a formal VAI committee will\nbe established (para. 7).\n(ii)  Selection of design options by the individuals involved through PLAA. Design and level\nof  service  options  include  physical  designs,  financial  plan,  mode  of  contract  (local\ncompetitive bidding vs community contracting), cost sharing, O&M, and monitoring and\nevaluation arrangements, and other aspects identified as necessary. VAI committee will\ncoordinate.\n(iii)  Training  of  participants.  In  parallel  to  (ii),  the  PIMU/VAI  assisted  by  community\npreparation and awareness experts will train participants in participatory infrastructure\ndevelopment, O&M and monitoring and evaluation. Such training may be conducted with\nother villages that are at a similar stage of VAI.", "Appendix 4, page 6\n47\n(iv)  Preparing the final village proposal. The final proposal, including detailed cost estimates,\ncost sharing, O&M, implementation arrangements, schedule, and monitoring indicators,\nis prepared with the help of the PIMU/VAI. The proposal will be presented at a village\nmeeting, and needs to be endorsed by the villagers from different groups.\n(v)  Submission of Final Village Proposal to PIMU for final approval.\nc. Implementation\n20. During the implementation stage, VAI committees under the guidance of PIMU/VAI, will\nensure that funds flow, procurement, labor arrangement, supervision of works and any other\nactivities  will  be  documented  (the  following  paras.  describe  monitoring).  The  committee  is\nresponsible for monthly reporting to PIMU/VAI. The implementation stage may take about six\nmonths (one dry season) on average.\nd. Monitoring and Evaluation\n21. The  committee  is  responsible  for  both  process  and  impact  monitoring.  Process\nmonitoring indicators may include (i) planned vs actual duration of tender, construction of\nfacilities, or procurement of equipment for each physical subcomponent; (ii) person-days and\nwage (or labor contribution); if local labor is used,; (iii) number of households benefiting from the\ninfrastructure; (iv) condition of infrastructure developed; (v) frequency of maintenance; (vi) types\nand dates of training provided and the number and names of participants disaggregated by\ngender,  poor/non-poor,  and  officeholders  vs  non-officeholders;  (vii)  types  and  dates  of\nmeetings/workshops  held  and  the  participants;  and  (viii)  number  and  types  of  complaints\naddressed to the committee and village chief. Process monitoring will continue monthly during\nthe project period, and results will be submitted to PIMU/VAI.\n22. Participatory impact monitoring will be carried out twice; six months and twelve months\nafter the completion of all physical works. Impact monitoring indicators may include (i) the felt\nbenefits and the level of satisfaction with the infrastructure and services, (ii) the felt benefits and\nthe level of satisfaction on the decision-making process of VAI, (iii) major problems, and (iv)\nimpact of VAI on livelihood. Information for (i) - (iv) will be collected by the committee through\nPLAA with focus group discussions among women/men, village officeholders/non-officeholders\nand the poor/non-poor. More detailed but efficient indicators will be developed by the villagers\nduring the design phase. The findings will be reported to PIMU/VAI. PIMU will also carry out\nbeneficiary satisfaction surveys.\n23. Any  problem  identified  by  villagers  during  implementation  and  post-implementation\nstages will be reported to the committee. The committee will discuss with villagers possible\nremedial measures. If this cannot solve the problems, the committee through village chief will\ncontact the PIMU for further advice.\n24. Given the complexity of VAI and the limited capacity and experience of VUDAA and\nvillages in this type of activity, an independent external monitoring agency (nongovernment\norganization) will be hired for periodical monitoring of the preliminary impact of VAI for three\nphases.  The  agency  will  not  only  monitor  the  financial,  technical,  environmental,  and\nsocioeconomic aspects but also dispute resolutions, especially those between the poor and the\nbetter-off residents. The agency will report to PIMU and ADB and recommend further actions as\nnecessary. The view and support of the external monitoring agency will complement the village-\nbased participatory self-monitoring and periodical supervision by PIMU.

Introduction\n1. The Project involves the improvement or construction of about 36 kilometers (km) of\nmajor roads, 14 km of main drainage, and a variety of other tertiary-level infrastructure and\nservice improvements. Most of the proposed improvements will be made within existing rights-\nof-way, and as such no additional land is required. In some cases, however, the proposed new\nalignments or right-of-way widening will involve the acquisition of land and also affect a few\nstructures. A full resettlement action plan, which is a supplementary appendix, was prepared on\nthe  basis  of  comprehensive  socioeconomic  and  physical  surveys,  and  interviews  with  the\nconcerned households.\nB.  Scope and Scale of Resettlement\n2. Resettlement  and  relocation  activities  will  be  limited  since  (i)  most  subproject\ncomponents involve work within existing rights-of-way, (ii) the amount of new land required is\nvery small, and (iii) most of this is at the edge of the urban area. The Project will require 12.9\nhectares (ha). About 9 ha is in private use whereas the remaining 3.9 ha is government-owned\nland. Of the over 30,000 households within the Vientiane urban area, only about 89 households\n(500  persons)  will  be  affected  by  full  partial  loss  of  their  houses,  outbuildings,  property\nboundaries, or paddy lands. No encroachers or squatters were found in the affected areas.\n3. Of  the  total  89  households  affected,  48  will  have  effects  on  their  houses  or  other\nstructures.  Eighteen  of  these  structures  are  temporary  shelters,  made  of  light  materials\n(bamboo), and the remaining 30 are of brick or wood. Many affected structures are outhouses\nrather than the main family dwelling. Where the dwelling is affected, only part is required. In\nmost cases, householders will have to give up narrow strips of unirrigated paddy land. These\nhouseholders will be provided with either replacements from adjoining land, or land of equal\nutility and value elsewhere within the same district, or they will be paid the full market value of\nthe land taken. Trees, shrubs, or gardens will be affected in a few households, and in such\ncases full compensation will be paid. Of the 48 affected structures, only 6 will require relocation\nand resettlement of the households. These households will be accommodated in the same\nvillage if possible. It is estimated that only two of the masonry structures will require relocation\naway from their existing sites. In these cases, alternative alignments are available that could\navoid relocation. As a result of the resettlement action plan, none of the affected households will\npermanently lose either agricultural landholding or income generation sources. A summary of\nthe land requirements by project component and the associated houses and structures affected\nis shown in Table A9.1. Given that no encroachers or squatters are affected by the Project, and\nthat many of the affected people are living on roadsides where access is easier, the affected\npeople are in general relatively well off.\nC.  Policy Framework\n4. The project policy framework and compensation strategy are based on (i) the Asian\nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB's) policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and Handbook on\nResettlement (1998), (ii) the Lao PDR legislative framework, and (iii) good practice established\nunder other ADB and World Bank-supported projects as there is as yet no formal Government\npolicy on involuntary resettlement. All land is the property of the nation and ownership means\nonly the right to use land. However, land rights are transferable and the right to use land is\neffectively equivalent to ownership. The constitutional rights of land users are protected by\nArticle 5 of the Land Law, with categories of agricultural land, forestland, construction land,\ncommunications  land,  cultural land,  defense and security land, and water area land.

Apart  from  construction  land  and  a  small  amount  of\nagricultural land, no other types of land are affected by the Project.\n1. Under the Land Law (Article 43), persons entitled to use land have these rights: (i) keep\nthe land for a specific purpose, (ii) use the land in accordance with the State\u2019s management\nplans, (iii) enjoy usufruct from the land, (iv) transfer the right of land use, and (v) bequeath the\nright of land use. Article 63 states that the right of land use will terminate either through\nvoluntary relinquishment of the land or with State retrieval of the land for public purposes.\nCompensation is treated in Articles 67-71, which require each village, province, municipality, or\nspecial zone to keep 5 percent of its total land area in reserve for compensating requisitioned\nland. However, most urban villages of Vientiane do not retain such a provision, and relocations\nwithin the same village may not always be possible. The Road Law (1999) sets out the road\nlimits, including the right-of-way, for different classes of roads. By that law, people with land use\nrights will be compensated if the land is expropriated for road construction. The same can be\ninferred as being applicable to those whose land is expropriated for drainage and other public\ninfrastructure.\nD. Compensation\n2. The affected households will receive replacement land or cash for land and immovable\nassets  at  replacement  prices.  A  number  of  additional  benefits  will  also  be  provided  to\ncompensate for loss of business, income, or workdays, and to cover the cost of the shifting\nhouse  structures  or  goods,  etc.  Given  the  limited  impact  on  most  affected  properties,\npreliminary discussion with affected households has revealed a preference in favor of on-site\nrelocation. Since in most cases the project will involve loss of frontage or of a garden and\noutbuildings,  the  strategy  adopted  is  to  retain  households  at  or  adjacent  to  their  current\nlocations wherever possible. The entitlement matrix is presented in Table A9.2.\n3. The  two  major  cost  items  for  resettlement  will  be  compensation  payable  for\nresidential/commercial  land  (plots  with  or  without  structures  thereon)  and  the  costs  for\nrelocation/shifting of permanent or semipermanent structures. The costs derived are based on\ncurrent information on unit prices in Vientiane and the experience gained under the recently\ncompleted Vientiane Integrated Urban Development Project (VIUDP). The detailed estimated\nland acquisition and resettlement costs and the cost of implementation are shown in Table A9.3.\n4. As  part  of  the  process  for  determining  types  of  compensation  offered,  consultation\nmeetings will be held with affected individuals and communities to elicit their preference among\nthe  options  available.  The  project  implementation  unit  (PIMU)  together  with  resettlement\ncommittees to be formed by Vientiane Urban Development Administration Authority (VUDAA) at\nVientiane Prefecture and district levels will be responsible for implementing the resettlement\naction plan. Project-affected people will have the right to file complaints and submit queries on\nany aspect of land acquisition and resettlement. Relocation will be carried out immediately\nbefore civil works and during land acquisition, which will be implemented in 2002 and the first\nhalf of 2003. Compensation for land will be made before relocation. PIMU, in consultation with\nresettlement committees, will internally monitor the implementation of the resettlement action\nplan. An external monitoring agency (nongovernment organization), to be hired to monitor\nvillage  area  improvements  component,  will  also  be  involved  in  periodical  independent\nmonitoring of the implementation of resettlement.", "Table A9.2: Entitlement Matrix\nType of Loss Application Definition of Entitled Person Compensation Policy Implementation Issues\nPermanent loss of -  Bunded paddies, orchards, and other -  Legal users with Form 01 land use -  Provide equivalent to better land from -  Resettlement census and socioeconomic\nagriculture land permanent agricultural land directly certificates behind or next to the lot, from the village survey: February-July 2001\naffected by acquisition for roads or reserve area, or from neighboring village -  If appropriate, assistance to farmers in\ndrainage lines and other civil works -  Users without Form 01 but claiming within the same district. preparing of new rice paddies, orchards, or\nownership that can be validated by village -  If no replacement land is available in the other agricultural land\nauthorities vicinity, pay in cash at full replacement cost. -  Changes must be registered with the\nPrefecture land titling office.\nLoss of residential -  Residential land directly affected by -  Legal occupants with Form 01 land use -  Provide equivalent land from behind or next -  Resettlement census and socioeconomic\nand/or commercial land acquisition for roads, drainage lines certificates to the lot. survey: February-July 2001\nand other civil works -  If remaining area is insufficient, affected -  Value of new site must be equivalent to or\n-  Occupants without Form 01 but claiming people have right to relinquish entire plot better than that of current property.\nownership that can be validated by village and be given replacement land from village -  Changes must be registered with the\nauthorities land reserve or in vicinity for the entire lot.

Socioeconomic Profile of Urban Vientiane\n1. Socioeconomic Context\n1. The Vientiane urban area covers 100 villages in four districts for which the Vientiane\nUrban Development Administration Authority (VUDAA) is responsible. The current population is\nestimated at 162,000 growing at the rate of 1.2 per annum over the past five years. The greater\nVientiane urban area, within the boundaries of the master plan cover 189 villages, with a\npopulation of 325,000, growing at 3.3 per annum. The 1997 Vientiane Social Survey Project\nindicates that about half the current population were born in the Vientiane urban area, and that\nthe bulk of rural-urban migration took place between 1975 and 1990. No official statistics exist\non recent migration trends, but anecdotal evidence suggests that there is a growing number of\nmigrant workers employed by the industry, especially textiles, although the scale is still limited.\n2. The ethnicity composition for Vientiane Prefecture in the 1995 Census is 92.6 percent\nLao  Loum  (lowland  Lao)  and  7.4  percent  various  ethnic  minority  groups.  However,  this\ninformation grossly understates the ethnic or even nationality diversity within each village of\nurban Vientiane. For example, Ban Nong Chan, one of the villages selected for the Project\u2019s\nparticipatory poverty assessment, had Lao (65 percent), Vietnamese (23 percent), and Chinese\nand others (12 percent). Ten percent of the population was unregistered immigrants. The\nparticipatory poverty assessment identified that ethnic minorities are often found among the\npoorest and tenants without legal land titles.\n3. The Government sector, commerce, and trade employ more than 50 percent of the labor\nforce in urban districts, but 18 percent of the households still depend on farming as their primary\nincome source. The urban-rural mixture is apparent from the current land use pattern in which\nagricultural and residential/commercial land plots exist side by side. Many of the households\nhave more than one income source, and 48 percent depend on remittances from relatives\nresiding outside the country. Educational attainment is low \u2013 about 32 percent of the population\nnever went beyond primary school \u2013 and that of women is much lower; about 45 percent of\nmothers stopped at primary level, compared with 28 percent of fathers. Health facilities need\nfurther upgrading. Water- and feces-borne diseases are highly prevalent, especially among the\npoor, whose access to health services is limited.\n2. Profile of the Urban Poor\n4. According to the data in the Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey (LECS II), the\nincidence of poverty in the Lao PDR is estimated at 38.6 percent. The country is ranked at the\nbottom  fifth  of  the  countries  in  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme\u2019s  human\ndevelopment index, reflecting its low performance in the human development sector. LECS II\nalso estimates poverty incidence in urban Vientiane at 17 percent. This is close to the poverty\nincidence of 18 percent identified through the participatory poverty assessment (based on the\ninformation collected through village chiefs) using the income of KN150,000 per capita per\n                    \n1 The Project\u2019s social and poverty assessment is derived from both primary and secondary sources. The primary\nsources are (i) a participatory poverty assessment covering 750 poor households in seven villages in four districts\nin Vientiane urban area, (ii) a questionnaire responded by 100 village chiefs in the Vientiane urban area, and (iii) a\nnumber of consultations with key stakeholders from the Government, industry managers, and funding agencies and\nnongovernment organizations. The secondary sources are (i) 1995 National Census (Vientiane Prefecture), (ii)\n1997 Vientiane Social Survey Project for urban districts in Vientiane, and (iii) other studies and documents.", "Appendix 10, page 2\n59\nmonth as a poverty line. The assessment also shows that 3 percent of the population belonged\nto the poorest group with an income of less than KN60,000 per capita per month.\n5. Unlike other cities in the region, where the poor reside in well-defined slum areas, the\npoor in the Vientiane urban are literally hidden in pockets throughout the city. Urban village\nsettlements are highly heterogeneous; the poor households are often found adjacent to higher-\nincome settlements. The vast majority of the poor live on low-lying wetland areas, flooded most\nof the year. These areas are acutely underserviced, and the links from access roads to the\ndwellings are via difficult routes.\n6. Due to the complex nature of urban poverty, there is no single definition of the poor,\nHowever, the vulnerable groups, which are often the poor, include the physically and mentally\ndisabled, drug users/alcoholics, elderly people living alone, the homeless and street children,\ninfrequent beggars, female headed households, illegal immigrants, dropouts and unemployed\nyouth, large families with low income, and ethnic minorities. The poor can be categorized into\ntuk ti sut (the poorest) who are destitute, tuk pang kang (medium poor) usually employed in\nirregular low-paying jobs, and tuk thammada (simple poor) who may have a house and land but\nare very susceptible to slipping into a more vulnerable way of life.\n7. Poverty reduction is the Government's key development strategy. In the Seventh Round\nTable Meeting in November 2000, the Government reconfirmed its commitment to eradicate\npoverty and to move out of the ranks of least developed countries by 2020. In Vientiane\nPrefecture, the governor issued a five-year plan to eradicate poverty by 2005. The participatory\npoverty assessment noted, however, that to date there has been no targeted urban poverty\nreduction programs, although emergency assistance during fire and flood, assistance to the\ndisabled and orphans, and access to metered electricity have been provided by the Ministry of\nSocial Welfare. There is also a system in urban Vientiane that the village authority enable the\npoorest to receive some form of state assistance (e.g., rice provision) in case of emergencies or\nother external shocks. Other formal assistance includes a village-based revolving drug fund,\nfree treatment for registered destitute at district hospitals, subsidized education and vocational\ncourses, and an orphan center. Financial services for the poor are currently limited to the\nsavings and credit program funded by the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF),\nand covering thus far 30 villages in Chanthabouly District. The program has been successfully\nproviding saving and credit services to 1,684 individuals since 1995 at a close to 100 percent\nrepayment rate.\n8. Nonetheless,  formal  programs  do  not  reach  all  poor.  Informal  coping  mechanisms\nreported by the poor include (i) informal support system, e.g., obtaining food or borrowing\nmoney from neighbors; (ii) engaging in survival activities, e.g., begging, collecting vegetables\nand catching fish from swamps, and selling assets; (iii) engaging in illegal activities, e.g., drug\ndealing, stealing, prostitution; and (iv) reducing consumption and costs of living, e.g., eating less\nand not buying drinking water.\nB. Constraints on the Urban Poor\n1. Physical Exclusion\n9. The problem-ranking exercise of the participatory poverty assessment found that the\nurban poor in Vientiane have strong and urgent need for improved urban infrastructure and\nservices. It also highlighted the strong linkage between poor infrastructure conditions and the\nability to engage in subsistence economic activities near the house. The service problems\nthough varied across villages include in order of priority (i) constant flooding, (ii) inadequate", "Appendix 10, page 3\n60\naccess paths and roads, (iii) poor sanitation facilities and sewerage, (iv) uncollected rubbish,\nand (v) sharing water and electricity supply.  All these problems are closely linked.\n10. Flooding is felt at almost all times of the year, as the poor tend to live in low-lying land. \nThe situation was exacerbated recently with the construction of multistory concrete houses by\nthe better-off, which allow the run off from these houses into the adjacent lower, poorer areas\npushing the poor back onto lower and more marginal land. Polluted water flows create poor\nenvironmental conditions and waterborne skin and foot diseases. Lack of space outside the\ndwelling for daily activities hinders subsistence economic activities, such as growing vegetables\nor raising livestock.\n11. Access paths are impossible or difficult to use because of constant flooding. During the\nmonsoon  season,  most  of  the  poor  access  their  dwellings  along  narrow  timber  planks,\nbalancing on dirty floodwater. The elderly and disabled cannot go out of their houses, which\nworsens their vulnerability and marginalization. Even in higher areas, access may be limited by\nthe narrow width of the paths between houses and the unplanned and haphazard settlement\npattern. This makes the service delivery difficult, such as access by vacuum tankers, water\ndelivery  trucks,  emergency  services,  and  rubbish  collection  vehicles,  and  routing  of  water\nsupply pipes.\n12. The poor do not have access to a typical range of sanitation options available to low-\nincome households in many other countries. The most common system is to dump human\nwaste into floodwaters or, at best, in corroded oil drums thus allowing effluent to run into the\nfloodwaters. Most household sanitation facilities are without secure enclosure; this is especially\na problem for women.   \n13. There is almost no household or community management of solid waste in the low-\nincome areas.  A large number of households throw their waste beside or under their dwellings\nor dump it in the swamp or collection areas from which it is not always collected. This creates\nunhygienic conditions with flies, and rotting waste with its putrid smells, further contaminating\nthe floodwaters.\n14. Most households, except the poorest, have some level of access to piped water supply\nfrom Nam Papa Lao. The informal arrangement whereby the connected households sell water\nto the unconnected ones at a fee of about KN5,000-15,000 per month is widespread. Water\ncollected through flexible hoses is stored in drums for long periods creating a breeding ground\nfor malarial mosquitoes. However, apart from the poorest, most poor buy bottled water for\ndrinking. Electricity coverage is also high at about 90 percent. The same informal sharing\narrangement  as  with  water  exists  for  electricity;  the  proportions  of  metered  electricity  and\nsharing are about 50:50. The poor allocate about 5 percent of their income to electricity. \n2. Social Exclusion\n15. One key manifestation of the social exclusion of the poor is the formal land titling\nprocess. The Land Titling Project, financed by the World Bank and Australian Agency for\nInternational  Development,  is  in  the  process  of  surveying,  assigning,  and  registering  titles\nthroughout Vientiane Prefecture and other towns. As of January 2001, 57 villages in Vientiane\nurban area have completed the process, 10 villages have started, and 33 villages have not\nstarted. Around 13,000 of about 49,000 titles have been issued. The notable lack of formal land\nuse  rights  among  most  of  the  poor  households  suggests  that  the  land  titling  initiative  is\nbenefiting better-off groups, e.g., government officials and war veterans, disproportionately.", "Appendix 10, page 4\n61\nEven the poor households that have resided in the same place more than a decade may not be\nrecognized deserving of their land use rights. \n16. Poverty and lack of land use rights are closely linked.  Fear of eviction was ranked one\nof the highest among the problems of the poor. The practice thus far is this: when land occupied\nby the poor is demanded for development purposes, either the poor are directly asked to move\nout or landowners indirectly force the poor out through exorbitant rent increases or by cutting off\nwater and electricity supplies. Under these circumstances, the poor have little incentive to invest\nin maintaining and upgrading their housing and urban services.  \n17. Helplessness caused by socioeconomic marginalization is a major characteristic of the\npoor. The poor perceive that they cannot get a job because they are so poor that they are not\nwanted  by  other  people.  However,  the  success  of  the  UNCDF-funded  savings  and  credit\nscheme  suggests  that  a  carefully  targeted,  home-based,  microenterprise  development\napproach can help the poor come out of the trap of marginalization.\n18. Gender-based  exclusion  is  also  prevalent  in  urban  Vientiane,  as  apparent  in  the\nwomen's  low  social  status  and  political  representation.  Despite  the  existence  of  the  well-\norganized Lao Women\u2019s Union (LWU) at the community level, women are usually not key\ndecision  makers  in  village  meetings,  not  to  mention  at  a  higher  level  in  the  political  and\nadministrative structure. Poor women suffer from the double impact of exclusion. As family\ncaretakers and home-based economic producers, and also primary users and managers of\nenvironmental services in the household and neighborhood, poor women disproportionately\nface the burden of poor sanitation and environmental conditions. Women\u2019s health, reproductive\nhealth in particular, is at high risk.\n19. Women\u2019s exclusion from the formal land titling process is also a growing concern. A\nrecent survey carried out by LWU in Vientiane and three other towns2 shows that only the\nhusbands\u2019  name  was  written  on  the  land  title  in  58  percent  of  the  households  surveyed,\nwhereas the traditional inheritance patterns in only 18 percent of the households surveyed\nshows that land actually belonged to the husband. This is especially problematic among the\ntraditionally matrilineal ethnic groups such as the Lao Loum. The adverse impact on women\nwas taken up by the Land Titling Project Office which will carry out awareness raising and\nadvocacy campaign on women\u2019s full or joint land rights for further titling process.\n20. Another  primary  problem  identified  by  the  poor  is  that  the  school  dropouts  and/or\nunemployed young people are exposed to the risks of drug use, alcoholism, sex work, and\ngambling, causing their social marginalization. Poor health, disability, ethnicity, illegal migration,\nand old age also contribute to social exclusion.\nC. The Project's Social Strategy\n21. The overall project approach to social and poverty issues includes (i) extending the\nbenefits from the Project to the community by focusing on the linkage between the primary and\nsecondary/tertiary-level  infrastructure;  (ii)  combining  the  physical  and  social  components\nthrough which procedures and conditions for village area improvements (VAI) are established to\navoid implementing the physical component in isolation from the social one (Appendix 4 gives\nthe  participatory  implementation  framework  for  VAI);  (iii)  building  capacity  at  all  levels  of\nstakeholders including VUDAA, villages, and direct beneficiaries to manage the social and\n                    \n2  Marriage and Family in the Lao PDR: The Pilot Survey on the Situation of Lao Women (Lao Women\u2019s Union/GRID\nCenter, July 2000).", "Appendix 10, page 5\n62\nphysical  components  such  as  participatory  learning  and  action  appraisals  (PLAA),  gender\nawareness, public health and hygiene, and environmental management through classroom and\non-the-job training; and (iv) promoting stakeholder participation at all levels and sensitizing\nvillage organizations to their potential for participatory and responsive urban governance. The\nspecific strategies follow.\n1. Stakeholder Participation\n22. The Project has been prepared with extensive participation of stakeholders at all levels:\npoor  men  and  women;  adversely  affected  people;  village,  district,  and  prefecture\nrepresentatives; relevant ministries; private sector representatives; and funding agencies. The\nProject will ensure direct participation of village communities through (i) the VAI component that\nallows community participation and empowerment of village communities in community-based\ndecision making, infrastructure development, service delivery, financial management, operation\nand  maintenance  (O&M),  and  monitoring  and  evaluation,  (ii)  raising  awareness  of  the\nimportance of environmental improvements in promoting public health, as part of VAI; and (iii)\nimplementation of a resettlement action plan. Specific mechanisms have been included to\nensure the meaningful participation and representation of the poor and women.\n2. Urban Services for the Poor\n23. The Project will address the priority needs of the poor both directly and indirectly. The\ndirect targeting mechanisms in VAI under part B of the Project include (i) direct participation and\nrepresentation  of  the  poor  in  village-based  decision  making  and  training/public  awareness\nraising (minimum requirement of the percentage equivalent to the poverty level in each village);\n(ii)  formation  of  poor-only  focus  groups  in  PLAA;  (iii)  targeting  the  poor  in  sanitation\nsubcomponent and leadership training; (iv) safeguard against forced eviction of the poor from\nthe land that they occupy, based on neighborhood monitoring and a grievance mechanism; (v) a\ngradation of services providing a range of options affordable to the poor; (vi) prioritization of\nvillages with higher levels of poverty in the village selection; (vii) priority to the poor in hiring\nlaborers for construction activities; and (viii) where possible, orientation for microfinance to be\nprovided for under UNCDF-supported Microfinance and Sustainable Livelihood Project. Other\nproject components (citywide infrastructure and services and capacity building) will indirectly\nbenefit the poor. Approximately 15,000 poor will directly benefit from VAI while 35-40,000 poor\ncitywide will indirectly benefit from the Project.\n3. Gender Strategy\n24.  The Project will reinforce women\u2019s roles as primary users and managers of urban\nenvironmental services. The strategy to address women\u2019s needs, constraints, and participation\nincludes (i) direct participation and representation of women (minimum 40 percent) in village-\nbased decision making and training; (ii) formation of women-only focus groups in PLAA; (iii)\ntargeting  women  in  community-based  sanitation  and  solid  waste  management,  leadership\ntraining,  and  awareness  raising  in  hygiene  and  environmental  management;  (iv)  where\nnecessary, linking the project activities to training of women on land rights provided by the Land\nTitling Project; (v) where needs exist, orientation for microfinance to be provided under the\nUNCDF-supported Microfinance and Sustainable Livelihood Project; and (vi) gender awareness\ntraining for key VUDAA staff (including the Social Action Unit and technical units) and village\nauthorities. The existing structure of LWU at village level will be used. Women\u2019s\nleadership and gender awareness training will be provided by LWU's Gender Resource Information and\nDevelopment Center. A gender specialist will be hired to guide implementation of the strategy.", "Appendix 10, page 6\n63\n4. Strategy for Ethnic Minorities\n25. Due  to  the  heterogeneous  composition  and  mixed  residential  patterns  in  urban  Vientiane\ncommunities,  the  Project  will  not  significantly  affect  specific  ethnic  minority  groups.  However,  the\nparticipatory poverty assessment observed that ethnic minorities and illegal immigrants are often found\namong the poor. Specific mechanisms to mitigate the risks of the better-off dominating the VAI decision\nmaking and eviction of the poor, including minority ethnic groups, have been developed (para. 23 above\nand Appendix 4). In addition, baseline information on ethnicity will be collected at the outset under VAI\nand monitored during implementation. \n5. Resettlement and Land Acquisition\n26. The Project\u2019s resettlement and land acquisition impacts are limited (summary resettlement action\npan is given in Appendix 9). The total land requirement (privately owned land) is about 9 hectares. Only\n89 households (500 persons) will be affected by full or partial loss of their property. Of the 89 households\naffected, 48 will have effects on their houses or other structures. Eighteen of these structures are\ntemporary shelters and the remaining 30 are of brick or wood. Many affected structures are outhouses\nrather than main dwelling. Of the 48 households, only 6 will require relocation and resettlement of the\nhouseholds. These households will be accommodated in the same village if possible. No encroachers or\nsquatters were found in the affected areas. The affected households will receive replacement land or\ncash for land and immovable assets at replacement prices. Compensation will also be provided for\nshifting of structures or goods and loss of business and livelihood. A full resettlement action plan\n(supplementary appendix) with a clear compensation framework, implementation mechanisms, and cost\nestimates was prepared in accordance with policies and practices of the Lao PDR and ADB's Policy on\nInvoluntary Resettlement.\n6. Capacity Building\n27. One major lesson learned from the previous Vientiane Integrated Urban Development Project is\nthe  need  for  capacity  building  for  both  service  delivery  agents  and  direct  beneficiaries  in  social\ncomponents. The Social Action Unit of VUDAA established during the previous Project requires further\nstrengthening  to  implement  the  Project\u2019s  social  and  poverty  strategy.  Various  training  and  public\nawareness campaigns will be held in VUDAA and villages to increase the capacity for community-based\nplanning, O&M, and service delivery. To avoid isolating the social components and ensure integration of\ntechnical and social issues, training in social components such as PLAA will be extended to other VUDAA\nstaff.\n7. Project Management Support\n28. The  Project  will  provide  community  development  specialists,  a  land  acquisition/resettlement\nspecialist, and a gender specialist to support the project implementation and further strengthening of the\nSocial Action Unit. Community preparation and awareness experts will also be provided to conduct\ntraining/orientation activities in the field. PIMU will carry out overall monitoring and evaluation of VAI, the\ncommunity-based processes and public awareness campaign, and resettlement implementation with the\nfull involvement and support of the Social Action Unit of VUDAA. Independent monitoring and evaluation\nof VAI will also be undertaken by an external agency (NGO) in addition to community-based monitoring to\nbe carried out, using simple indicators identified by the community.

Introduction\n1. The initial screening of the potential environmental impacts indicates that the Project will not\naffect environmentally sensitive areas, nor will it cause large-scale changes in the physical, biological,\nor social environment. It will not involve the accelerated use of scarce resources, nor will it favour the\nuse of these resources to satisfy short-term over long-term economic or socioeconomic needs. It will\nhave a basically neutral impact on the ecology of the surrounding areas and a significant overall\npositive effect on the physical environment. In the long term, it will contribute to the more efficient use of\nresources by improving the efficiency of the urban system and reducing the incidence of flooding,\nwaterborne diseases, etc. Where negative environmental impacts are unavoidable, mitigation and\ncompensatory measures will be taken to minimize such impacts.\n2. The nature of the physical works proposed is limited in scope and largely concerns the\nimprovement of existing facilities, mainly drainage channels and roads. Indeed, the majority of the\nproject components will bring clear environmental benefits. Where negative impacts during the\nconstruction phase are anticipated, these are not significant where (i) longer-term benefits to\nsociety at large exceed short-term costs, and (ii) appropriate mitigation measures are taken during\nthe construction phase. Consequently, a full environmental impact assessment is not considered\nnecessary  for  any  of  the  project  interventions  at  this  stage,  and  an  initial  environmental\nexamination  (IEE)  is  sufficient.  The  Project  is  classified  as  category  B,  which  requires  the\npreparation of an IEE. Summary IEEs have been prepared for each project component and are\navailable on request.\n3. This summary IEE draws on the individual project components IEEs and is prepared in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines. It is based on a series of field visits to the project sites under\nthe project preparatory technical assistance (TA). Software components such as the capacity\nbuilding and community preparation and awareness, which have no impact on the environment,\nwere not subjected to an IEE.\nB.  Description of the Project\n4. The Project will provide improved urban infrastructure and services and a series of non-\nphysical interventions e.g., capacity building measures to support physical improvements. The\ncomponents follow: (i) part A: citywide urban infrastructure and environmental improvements\u2013road\nimprovements, drainage, solid waste management, provision of maintenance equipment, traffic\nmanagement and road safety, and construction of an office building for the Vientiane Urban\nDevelopment  Administration  Authority  (VUDAA);  (ii)  part  B:  village  area  improvements  (VAI)\nprogram\u2013environmentally  focused  and  community-based  village  infrastructure  and  service\nimprovements  (particularly  tertiary  access,  drainage,  sanitation)  and  associated  community\npreparation and public awareness program; and (iii) part C: implementation support and capacity\nbuilding\u2013surveys,  investigations,  and  consulting  services  to  support  VUDAA  in  project\nmanagement and implementation and capacity building for and human resource development at\nVUDAA.\nC.  Description of the Environmental Conditions\n1. Physical Environment\n5. In general, the project sites can be classified as urban or semi-urban. They are all within the\nurban  core  areas,  which  are  generally  characterized  by  low-  or  medium-rise  development,\ncontaining significant areas of poor-quality infrastructure and housing, interspersed with small\nareas of open wasteland, urban agriculture and wetland. The built-up environment of Vientiane is\nhighly heterogeneous, with most villages exhibiting a mixture of high-, medium- and low- density\nhousing within an area of a few hectares. Many sites are low-lying and are subject to frequent", "65 Appendix 11, page 2\nflooding during the monsoon season. The growth and development of many of the urban areas are\nunplanned. While much of the primary road and drainage network is recently constructed, and\ngenerally in good condition, local roads are frequently narrow (seldom more than 4 - 5 meters [m]\nwide) and vary in quality of construction and maintenance.\n6. Vientiane lies on the left bank of the Mekong River, and is part of the alluvial plain that\nconstitutes most of Vientiane Prefecture. The soils are in general clay loam to a depth of 1 m,\nbelow which lies a gravel clay loam to a depth of about 7 m. Below this lies a sandy gravel and silt\nlayer. Most of the urban core area is flat with an elevation of 168 to 170m above ordinance datum,\nalthough a slight ridge in the east rises a few meters to a height of 180 m. Wetland areas lie at\nelevations between 167 and 168 m above ordinance datum. The water table fluctuates with the\nseason, but is highest at 168m. The urban area is protected from inundation during Mekong flood\nevents by a bund 175 m high. Vientiane has a tropical climate with average annual temperatures\nranging  from  a  low  of  18\u00b0C  during  December-February,  to  31-33\u00b0C  during  March-May.  The\naverage annual precipitation is between 1,100 and 2,300 millimeters a year, with more than 85\npercent of the rain falling during the monsoon season in May-September.\n2. Biological Environment\n7. While the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) has a rich and diverse range of\ntropical flora and fauna, those in the urban and semi-urban areas covered by the Project are typical\nof flora and fauna in the urban environment. The most notable flora are the mature indigenous\nhardwood trees lining major thoroughfares. Sadly, only a few of these remain. Other trees are\nmostly ornamental and shade trees planted along roadsides and in gardens. There is some urban\nagriculture\u2013largely irrigated and unirrigated rice land. The fauna in the urban area are primarily\ngrazing animals such as sheep and goats, domestic animals such as chickens, dogs and ducks,\nand small reptiles\u2013the common gecko and lizards. Also common are pests\u2013rodents, stray cats,\nand insects that typically thrive on wastes in urban environment.\n3. Sociocultural Environment\n8. For a capital city, the population density of Vientiane is low at about 55 persons per hectare\nin the urban core area. Furthermore, the population growth rate in Vientiane urban area is not\nhigh\u2014averaging about 1.2 percent per annum between 1995 and 2000. The literacy rate is high\u2014\nover 95 percent. Of the numerous ethnic groups in Vientiane, almost all are Lao; only about 1\npercent of the population are reported to be non-Lao.1 About half of the existing urban population\nmoved to Vientiane after 1975, most in the first five years.\nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n1.  Positive Environmental Impacts\n9. The positive environmental benefits resulting from the Project as a whole will include (i)\nreduced direct exposure of the population to health risks associated with stagnant wastewater and\npolluted storm water, as a result of drainage and sanitation interventions; (ii) additional health-\nrelated benefits resulting from the elimination of numerous sites where stagnant polluted water\nfavors mosquito breeding, (iii) reduced damage to both properties and infrastructure from flooding;\n(iv) reduced air pollution resulting from (a) reduced vehicle emissions as a result of improved travel\ntimes, and (b) reduced dust pollution as a result of an increase in the proportion of asphalt roads;\n(v) overall improvement in the quality of the urban environment, and reduced odor and insect\nnuisance due to reduced pollution of groundwater and surface water caused by indiscriminate\n                                                \n1 Institute of Cultural Research, Ministry of Information and Culture of Lao PDR, 1997/1998. Vientiane Social Survey\nProject.", "66 Appendix 11, page 3\ndisposal of solid and liquid wastes; and (vi) reduced rates of injury and death from traffic accidents,\nparticularly among young people.\n2. Negative Environmental Impacts\na.  Environmental Problems Due to Project Location\n10. Few environmental problems are associated with project component locations. In most\ncases, the components involve upgrading of existing infrastructure, and as such will affect the local\nenvironment  positively.  However,  some  components,  including\u2014sections  of  new  roads,  and\nconstruction of the office for VUDAA\u2014make use of land, which is currently undeveloped, and in\nsome cases will involve the movement of structures. In recognition of this potential negative project\nimpact, a full resettlement action plan was prepared. In the case of roads, improvements will\nencourage  development,  which  will  in  turn  result  in  land  use  change  and  consequent\nenvironmental impacts such as increased runoff, wastewater flows, traffic, etc. In no case, will the\ndevelopment resulting from project investments or the project investments themselves encroach\nupon environmentally sensitive areas, or affect historic or cultural resources.\nb. Environmental Problems Related to Design\n11. The design of new infrastructure will involve the development of currently undeveloped\nareas, and the implications of this in terms of runoff and other potential impacts will be considered\nin design. In the case of drainage design, wastewater, sullage, and polluted storm water will be\ndirected away from residential areas through the drainage network. Newly built or improved tertiary\nchannels will discharge into largely existing primary channels, and thence to natural wetland\nsystems.  The  designs  will  ensure  that  the  proposed  improvements  will  not  result  in  new  or\nintensified drainage problems in other areas.\n12. Standard designs for roads in these proposals include adequate size roadside drains, which\nwill improve the life expectancy of these investments. Roadside and other drains in heavily built-up\nareas are likely to receive sullage, wastewater, and polluted storm water, and will be covered to\nminimize the risk of direct human contact and environmental nuisance.\nc. Environmental Problems Associated with Construction Stage\n13. The  construction  of  new  primary  roads  and  drains  under  previous  projects  frequently\ncreated  significant  and,  in  some  cases,  sustained  nuisance;  and  damaged  property,  due  to\ninundation caused by blocked drains and led to the inevitable nuisance of dust and noise during\nconstruction.  Problems  are  attributed  to  a  combination  of  inexperienced  and  ill-equipped\ncontractors, insufficient and inadequately qualified staff assigned to supervise construction, and an\nunderdeveloped approach to the protection of the rights of residents in the Lao PDR. The Project is\ndesigned to ensure that the problems are not repeated.\n14. The construction of primary drainage channels and rehabilitation of existing channels will\ninevitably  produce  dust  and  noise  during  construction,  which  will  affect  workers  and  nearby\nresidents. There may be temporary stoppage or disturbance of storm water drainage, disruption of\nvehicular traffic, possible destruction of shrubs and trees, and disruption of access to residences\nand  businesses.  Careful  construction  planning  and  monitoring  measures  will  be  essential  to\nminimize impacts on traffic flows during construction and to reduce the nuisance to residents.\nd. Environmental Problems Resulting from Project Operations\n15. Full environmental benefits will be achieved only with adequate operation and maintenance\n(O&M) of the new road and drainage networks and of the VAI. Environmental problems will occur if\nthe need for maintenance and for training in O&M at all levels is ignored.", "67 Appendix 11, page 4\n3. Mitigation Measures\n16. Mitigation measures to ameliorate any negative environmental impacts are divided into\nthose that are associated with the (i) project component and site selection, (ii) its design, (iii) its\nconstruction, (iv) its O&M, and (v) its decommissioning. The arrangements, to be put in place, will\nensure that the negative impacts are avoided or mitigated.\na. Project Selection and Location\n17. Project  components  avoid  areas  of  environmental  sensitivity  and  those  which  would\nnegatively impact on cultural heritage. Project sites avoid areas where there are geological or\ntopographic problems, and where either groundwater or surface waters likely to be used by others\nwould be adversely affected by the project components. Nuisance to surrounding areas will be\nlimited to the short term, and will be minimized through effective project management. Where land\nuse changes are likely to be induced by extensions to infrastructure, potential negative impacts will\nbe mitigated by improved urban planning and development control and enforcement capabilities of\nVUDAA, through the capacity building component. Where livelihoods or personal property are\nthreatened by project activities, compensation will be provided in accordance with the resettlement\naction plan.\nb. Project Design\n18. Project components will be designed to minimize destruction of the natural environment\n(such as tree cutting), the need for land acquisition and relocation of structures, and disturbance to\nexisting residential and commercial establishments. Roads are designed to provide adequate\ndrainage both for the roadway and the surrounding areas. Drainage is designed to accept both\nstorm water and, in some cases, sullage and/or settled wastewater and direct this to wetlands with\nadequate absorptive capacity. Sanitation component is designed to improve the efficiency of on-\nplot wastewater disposal systems, and the frequency and efficiency of septic tank sludge removal.\nThis will minimize negative environmental impacts from inappropriate methods for disposing of\nexcreta.\nc. Project Construction\n19. Arrangements for construction management will ensure that the negative environmental\nimpacts experienced in previous urban development initiatives will be avoided. These will be\nachieved by (i) appointing of experienced and responsible contractors; (ii) including a training and\ncapacity building program for local contractors, focusing on efficient project management, site\nsafety, etc.; (iii) assigning a sufficient number of suitably qualified staff to supervise construction;\n(iv) improving the construction management skills of the Implementing Agency VUDAA through the\ncapacity building program; (v) utilizing community contracting procedures for the VAI schemes;\nand (vi) improving the complaints procedures by responding within a reasonable time to legitimate\npublic grievances.\nd. Project Operation and Maintenance\n20. Project components can prevent negative environmental impacts only if they are operated\ncorrectly and maintained regularly. This means that necessary technical skills, financial resources,\nand O&M, and monitoring systems must be in place. The capacity building component of the\nProject will provide training in O&M for technical staff of VUDAA. It will also build the capacity for\nvillage-level maintenance of tertiary-level infrastructure and services. Capacity building will also (i)\nincrease the capacity of VUDAA to implement cost-recovery schemes and mobilize the other\nresources necessary to pay for O&M of both the project assets and the existing infrastructure that\nis  under  VUDAA's  responsibility,  and  (ii)  establish  capacities  for  adequate  environmental\nmonitoring in the environment division of VUDAA.", "68 Appendix 11, page 5\ne. Project Demobilization\n21. The Project components are likely to remain in place until upgraded in the future. Thus no\nnegative environmental impacts associated with project demobilization or decommissioning are\nanticipated.\nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring\n22. The  Environmental  Law,  enacted  on  3  April  1999,  gives  overall  responsibility  for\nenvironmental protection to the Science, Technology and Environment Agency. The law requires\nthat projects, which affect the environment, be subject to an environmental impact assessment for\nsubmission  to  the  concerned  environmental  agency  to  secure  an  environment  compliance\ncertificate  before  starting  the  project.  However,  many  regulations  and  guidelines  required  to\nsupport the law and to govern the preparation of the environmental impact assessments have yet\nto be prepared.\n23. Environmental monitoring within the Vientiane urban area is the responsibility of VUDAA.\nUnder the Law, VUDAA is to establish an environmental management and monitoring unit in\ncooperation with the Science, Technology, and Environment Agency. The duties of this unit include\n(i) preparing and implementing plans for environmental protection of the Vientiane urban area; (ii)\nmonitoring  and  controlling  the  implementation  of  environmental  legislative  instruments;  (iii)\nconducting research and identifying methods for environmental protection and restoration; and (iv)\ncollecting, analyzing, and disseminating information on the environment and related issues. The\nunit responsible for these activities within VUDAA is the Sanitation and Environment Division,\nwhich is also responsible for solid waste collection and disposal, septic tank emptying, and street\ncleaning. While the existing staff are adequate in number to perform this mandate, they lack the\nnecessary skills. The capacity building component of the Project will provide training both in the\nmanagement of environmental services and in monitoring environmental conditions in the broader\nsense.\nF.  Findings and Recommendations\n24. The proposed Project aims to improve environment in the Vientiane urban area, and will\ncontribute significantly to improved living conditions and well-being of the urban poor. The risk to\nthe urban population, particularly the urban poor, of incurring infectious diseases through exposure\nto contaminated surface water will be low. In addition, the health risk and public nuisance caused\nby mosquitoes and flies will be reduced as a result of the reduction in suitable breeding areas for\ninfectious disease vectors. The air quality and public safety will be enhanced by the improved road\nnetwork and access to village areas.\n25. On the basis of this initial evaluation, the Project is unlikely to result in any direct adverse\nenvironmental impacts. The identified adverse effects should be readily addressed through proper\nengineering design and incorporation of the identified mitigation measures. Adverse impacts relate\nalmost entirely to the construction phase, and particular attention will be paid to ensuring that\ncontractors comply with good engineering practice and avoid creating unnecessary inconvenience\nto the public. Assuming that the construction process is well-managed, the short-term negative\nimpacts of the Project will be far outweighed by the major positive impacts of an improved urban\nenvironment.", "69 Appendix 12, page 7\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Introduction\n1. The subprojects in each subsector under the Project aim to improve the environment and\neconomic outcomes for the community and to ensure that the urban poor participate in and gain\nfrom the Project. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) and financial internal rates of return\n(FIRRs), as appropriate, were estimated for the subprojects in each subsector in accordance with\nADB\u2019s  Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector\nProjects. EIRRs were prepared for road and traffic management, storm water drainage, and village\narea  improvements  (VAI)  subprojects,  and  FIRR  for  solid  waste  management.  Economic\nevaluations used the domestic price numeraire, excluded taxes, and used an opportunity cost of\nlabor of 0.5 for in-kind labor contribution by low-income households to VAI and a shadow exchange\nrate factor of 1.11 for traded items valued at border prices. Subprojects were generally assessed\nfor a period that included project implementation and 20 years of benefits, with allowance for the\nresidual value of assets at the end of the evaluation period. The evaluations were undertaken\nusing constant January 2001 prices, and took into account incremental operation and maintenance\n(O&M)  costs.  Subprojects  that  are  not  amenable  to  economic  or  financial  evaluation  were\nassessed in terms of cost-effectiveness.\nB.  Road Improvements\n2. Twenty-three road subprojects are proposed, covering construction of 2.1 km (kilometers)\nof new road and upgrading (widening and sealing) of 33.8 km of existing poor quality road, with a\ntotal base cost of $10.8 million. Economic evaluations were carried out for seven subprojects\ncovering 34 percent of the total length of the road subprojects and 41 percent of their total cost.\nThe evaluated projects cover a typical mix of construction of new roads and upgrading of existing\nroads, and a mix of improvements to primary, secondary, and tertiary roads.\n3. The evaluation of the upgrading of existing roads take into account of savings in vehicle\noperating costs (with distance-related vehicle operating costs expected to decline by an average of\n25 percent based on vehicle operating cost relationships in the highway design and maintenance\nroad evaluation model) and savings in personal travel time (using an average value of travel time\nof 50 percent of average personal income). A small amount of additional traffic is expected to use\nthe subproject roads after their improvement as reduced transport costs allow increased travel for\neconomic and social purposes and as traffic diverts from neighboring roads. New road links will\nimprove the connectivity of the road network and allow more direct travel instead of current more\ncircuitous routes. Accident savings are also expected, but are difficult to quantify and were not\nincluded in the evaluations.\n4. The number of registered vehicles in Vientiane Prefecture has risen by an average of 6.7\npercent per annum for 1980-1999 (7.8 percent per annum for 1989-1999). The forecast average\ntraffic growth of 5 percent per annum used for the evaluation period allows for a decline in the rate\nof traffic growth over time and for lower traffic growth in the central part of the urban area in\nresponse to increasing congestion over time. Traffic growth of 5 percent is also consistent with\nhistoric national evidence that a 10 percent growth in gross domestic product (GDP) results in a\nvehicle fleet growth of 13 percent for light vehicles, 11 percent for heavy vehicles, and 20 percent\nfor motorcycles. The elasticity of demand for travel with respect to income is higher for lower\nincome groups, suggesting that a combination of economic growth and provision of road capacity\nwill support the mobility needs of the poor.\n5. The  full  future  cost  of  maintaining  road  subprojects  was  included  in  the  evaluations,\nalthough it overstates the incremental cost that will result from the subprojects because current,\nalbeit deficient maintenance expenditure will be avoided. The evaluations (Table A12.1 indicate\nthat (i) the overall EIRR for the projects assessed is 24.2 percent (range of 12 - 41 percent); (ii) the\nlowest return for an individual project is from the construction of a new section of road (Project\nR101b), which is more difficult to assess and may not fully reflect the benefits of the road in the\ncontext  of  the  road  network  as  a  whole;  (iii)  the  subprojects  are  robust  with  respect  to  a\ncombination of higher costs and lower and delayed benefits (e.g., with the EIRR for the assessed", "Table A12.1: Economic Evaluation of Road Subprojects\nRoad Financial NPV (KN EIRR Sensitivity Tests (EIRR, %)\nCosta million, (%) Case 1 Case 2 Case 3 Case 4 Case 5 Case 6 Case 7 Case 8 Case 9\n(KN million, Jan (Costs (Benefit (Delayed (combination of (Traffic (Traffic (Excl.

Traffic Management and Road Safety\na.  Public Lighting\n1. Very few of the 279 km of primary, secondary, and tertiary roads in the Vientiane urban area\nare adequately lit at night. It is proposed that street lighting be installed along 18 kilometers of the 102\nkm of primary and secondary road in the urban area, at a base cost of $0.84 million. Allowing for\ncapital and O&M costs and the opportunity cost of capital, the total annual cost of public lighting will\nbe equivalent to $150,000 per year. Street lighting is a public good with substantial benefits for the\ncommunity, including (i) a decline in the number and severity of road vehicle accidents, especially\nthose involving pedestrians; (ii) reduced travel time and vehicle operating costs for motorists; (iii)\nfewer  accidents,  greater  convenience,  and  enhanced  personal  security  of  pedestrians  using\nfootpaths; and (iv) increased opportunity for social and business activity.\n2. Available  data  is  insufficient  for  an  economic  evaluation  of  the  proposed  street  lighting\nprogram. However, the benefits of street lighting and its current limited presence mean that the\nmarginal benefit to be gained from its provision is greater than would be the case were the project to\ninvolve extension of a more extensive current system. The benefit of the street lighting program will\nbe  maximized  by  determining  the  locations  where  lights  are  to  be  installed  during  project\nimplementation,  using  a  multicriteria  assessment  of  all  primary  and  secondary  roads  that  takes\naccount of (i) the quantity of traffic using each road, (ii) the number of traffic accidents, and (iii) the\nquality of footpaths on the roads.\n3. The  Vientiane  Urban  Development  and  Administration  Authority  (VUDAA)  is  to  collect  a\nsurcharge on electricity accounts to meet the cost of public lighting. The surcharge is currently set at\nKN1,000 per electricity meter per month, which is 0.3 percent of the 25th percentile household income.\nPractices such as sharing of electricity between several poor households or poor households drawing\non power from a better-off neighbor will temper the effect of the surcharge on the poor. Financial\nforecasts for VUDAA has made allowances for the cost of maintaining and operating the public\nlighting, and for increases in the rate of the electricity surcharge to cover the cost of public lighting.\nb.  Traffic Signals, Signage, and Safety Awareness\n4. The traffic management strategy, which will involve installation of traffic signals, traffic signs,\nand road marking, and improved traffic safety awareness, responds to traffic growth, poor traffic\nmanagement, and deteriorating road safety in Vientiane. The benefits of the strategy will be (i)\nreduced number and severity of road accidents, (ii) reduced vehicle operating costs resulting from\nimproved traffic flow, and (iii) increased capacity of the road system. The accident rate in Vientiane\nhas been rising, with the number of fatalities growing from an average annual rate of 4.8 per 10,000\nvehicles in 1980-1984 to 8.0, 11.8, and 12.5 in subsequent five-year periods (and 10.2 in 1999). The\nnumber of accidents resulting in injuries has risen at a faster rate. Over the decade to 1999, the\nnumber of deaths and fatalities rose at 120 percent of the rate of growth in the number of registered\nvehicles. The recent average death rate of 12.5 per 10,000 vehicles in Vientiane is high compared\nwith that in other countries (in 1997 national road deaths per 10,000 vehicles were 11.8 in Indonesia,\n8.5 in Thailand, 2.3 in Australia, and 1.6 in Japan, with death rates in urban areas typically about a\nquarter lower than these national rates). Traffic accidents in Vientiane are concentrated in certain\nareas (for  example,  33 of the 106 deaths in 1999   occurred   at   13  intersections),  which should be\nthe focus of traffic management strategy. During project implementation, the benefits of the strategy\nwill be maximized by assessing the entire road network and prioritizing the location of measures on\nthe basis of the quantity of traffic and the number of accidents.", "Appendix 12, page 7\n72\nD. Storm Water Drainage\n5. Ten  subprojects  are  proposed  to  upgrade  and  extend  the  drainage  system,  involving\nupgrading and construction of 5.8 km of primary drains and 8.2 km of secondary drains at a base cost\nof $6.53 million. These projects will reduce the incidence of flooding in a catchment area of 1,050\nhectares having a population of 60,100. Economic evaluation was prepared for the entire storm water\ndrainage component because linkages between drains result in benefits that are not always discrete\nto an individual subproject. A guide to the relative performance of the subprojects is provided with an\nevaluation for each of the subprojects, with the benefits of the entire component allocated to each of\nthe subprojects. The benefits valued in the economic evaluation include reduced damage to buildings\nand their contents in the areas subject to flooding at present. The savings are estimated at an annual\naverage of 1 percent of the value of property, which surveys indicate has an average value of KN1.4\nbillion (equal to $1,720) per hectare of the affected area per year. The unit savings are consistent with\nbenefits estimated for previous drainage projects in Vientiane allowing for a rise in the real value of\nthe savings to reflect densification of population, upgrading of buildings, and increased value of\nbuilding contents that are susceptible to flood damage. Allowance is made for the unit benefit to rise\nby 5 percent per annum in the future in line with the forecast growth in GDP per capita.\n6. The  economic  evaluations  (Table  A12.2),  which  also  take  into  account  incremental\nmaintenance costs, indicate that (i) the overall EIRR for the projects assessed is 11.9 percent (range\nof 6 - 29 percent for individual subprojects); (ii) the lowest return for an individual project is from the\nconstruction of a short section of drain to serve a small village (Project D202), which does not fully\nreflect the benefits gained by improved connectivity of the drainage network; (iii) the overall EIRR\ncould fall to about 7 percent with a combination of adverse circumstances (cases 4 and 5); and (iv)\nthe drainage component would need a decline in costs of 1 percent or a rise in benefits of 1 percent to\nachieve an EIRR of 12 percent.\n7. The drainage subprojects will generate additional benefits that are difficult to quantify: (i)\nreduced damage to motor vehicles and public infrastructure such as roads; (ii) reduced loss of\npersonal income when employment is disrupted; (iii) improved conditions with avoidance of flooding of\nsanitary systems and spread of raw and partially treated sewage and sullage with rainwater into\nresidential  areas;  and  (iv)  reduced  disruption  to  individual  and  community  life  caused  by  slow\nwithdrawal  of  storm  water.  These  benefits  will  ensure  that  the  overall  economic  benefit  of  the\ncomponent is higher than that shown in Table A12.2. The drainage subprojects will be especially\nbeneficial to the poor, who are more likely to live in low-lying land that is more subject to flooding.\n8. The willingness of residents of flood-affected areas to contribute to the cost of the drainage\ncomponent to avoid future flood damage is clouded by low income, short time horizons, and limited\nexperience with beneficiary charges. Improved drainage is, however, recognized as important, and\nwas the highest ranked need, identified by interviewed residents of villages. The savings in damage to\nbuildings and contents estimated in the economic evaluation are equal to 4.0 percent of the estimated\naverage household income of people.\nE. Solid Waste Management\n9. The   solid   waste   component     involves    the   provision    of   additional  collection  trucks,\nbins,   and    equipment,   which will   serve  about  16,000  people. A  financial  evaluation,  using  an\nevaluation  period  of  12  years  of  benefits   (the  expected  life  of  the  investment)  and  taking\naccount    of    incremental     O &   M    costs  and  incremental  revenue  from  user  charges,\nindicates an   FIRR   of   13.4   percent.  The  project  will  have  a  FIRR  of  at  least  12   percent  if\ncosts should  rise  by  up  to  6   percent,   or   benefits   should   decline    by   up  to  6  percent.  The\nsecurity    of    the   benefits    is    high    as    the  Project  will   enable   services   to  be\ncontinued    to      an     existing area  where  services  will   otherwise   be   withdrawn  due", "Table A12.2: Economic Evaluation of Storm Water Drainage Subprojects\n(property damage savings only)\nDrain Financial Costa NPV (KN EIRR Sensitivity Tests (EIRR, %)\n(KN million, million, (%) Case 1 Case 2 Case 3 Case 4 Case 5 Case 6 Case 7\nJan 2001 prices) Jan 2001 (Costs (Benefit (benefits (combination (Halve (switching (switching\nprices) +15%) -15%) delayed of cases growth in value: rise value: decr.\nby one 1, 2, and 3) benefits) in cost) in benefits)\nyear)\nD101 Rehab.
