Investment Program Summary\nThe Highlands region of Papua New Guinea (PNG) consists of seven landlocked provinces where approximately 40% of the \ncountry's population resides, most of whom are involved in rural smallholder agricultural production. Aside from abundant and \nunderemployed labor resources, the region is endowed with agricultural and mineral resources which serve as an engine of \ngrowth for the national economy. Characterized by relative high levels of the national agricultural production of fresh produce \nand cash crops, mainly coffee, tea, and cocoa, the region contributes a third of gross domestic product; while the region's \nmineral and petroleum resources account for nearly 80% of national exports. The 1,200 km long 2-lane national Highlands \nHighway is the lifeline for the Highlands region connecting 1,800 km of regional and feeder roads and servicing the region's \npeople particularly those in the rural hinterland. The highway traverses the Highlands region connecting it to the coastal \nprovinces and the country's main port in Lae.\nImpact: Attainment of well-integrated, safe, affordable, and financially and environmentally sustainable transport systems that \nefficiently serve the economy and people of PNG (National Transport Strategy, 2014-2030)\nImproved access to health and education, and living standards of the people of PNG (National Strategy for Responsible \nSustainable Development for Papua New Guinea)\nIncreased opportunity for equality and prosperity in rural areas (Development Strategic Plan, 2010-2030) \nOutcome: Increased efficiency and safe movement of people, goods, and services between the Highlands Region and markets \nOutputs: (i)The 430 kilometer of two-lane rural Highlands Highway from Lae Nadzab airport to Kagamuga airport in Mt Hagen, \nis rehabilitated, upgraded, and effectively maintained, (ii)Road safety on the national Highlands Highway increased, \n(iii)Transport logistics and services in the Highlands Region improved,  and (iv)Institutional capacity of the DOW to deliver the \ninvestment program and sustain its benefits strengthened\nImplementation Arrangements: Department of Works will be the executing agency.\n \nProject Readiness: This proposed investment program has the potential to diversify the nation's economy and have a \ntransformational impact on PNG. The Highlands Highway is a top priority national road of the government's Development \nStrategic Plan (2010-2030), and similarly it was also identified as a priority investment in the National Transport Strategy \n2014-2030 (NTS), the government's roadmap for development in the transport sector which proposes a safe, integrated \ntransport network that ensures domestic and international connectivity by moving people and goods reliably at low cost. The \ninvestment program is aligned with ADB's Country Partnership Strategy, 2016-2020 and the Country Operations Business Plan \n2017-2019 for PNG, which aims at reducing transport and logistical costs to support sustainable development and inclusive \ngrowth. In addition to being aligned with the government's strategies and priorities, the proposed investment program is highly \ncomplementary to ongoing efforts of ADB and other development partners in the sector. Currently, ADB's ongoing MFF for \nHighlands Region Road Improvement Investment Program (HRRIIP) is rehabilitating regional roads connected to the Highlands \nHighway. Road maintenance is supported by Government of Australia and the World Bank, specifically in the coastal areas. For \na coordinated and well-guided approach for the Highlands Highway among government agencies and development partners, a \nhigh level Program Steering Committee, including a core working group (CWG), was established in 2015.\n11.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to Papua New Guinea (PNG) for the Sustainable Highlands \nHighway Investment Program.1 \n \n2.  The investment program will improve the sustainability of the Highlands Highway, the \nnation\u2019s most strategic national road that traverses the Highlands Region, PNG\u2019s most populous \nand  resource-abundant  region.  The  program  will  (i)  rehabilitate,  upgrade,  and  sustainably \nmaintain 430 kilometers (km) of the Highlands Highway; (ii) improve road safety; (iii) support the \nestablishment of logistics platforms and services for agricultural production; and (iv) improve \nsector governance through reforms and institutional development. \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The Highlands Region consists of seven landlocked provinces that are home to about \n40% of the country\u2019s population, most of whom are involved in rural smallholder agriculture. With \nrelatively high production levels of fresh produce and cash crops\u2014mainly coffee, tea, and \ncocoa\u2014the region contributes one-third of PNG\u2019s gross domestic product, which was estimated \nat approximately $17 billion for 2014. Additionally, the region has rich mineral and petroleum \nresources, which account for nearly 80% of PNG\u2019s national exports. Better transport infrastructure \nresulting from the investment program is expected to improve access to markets and services, \nand unlock the Highlands Region\u2019s vast economic development potential. \n \n4.  The 1,200-km-long, two-lane national Highlands Highway is the lifeline for the Highlands \nRegion, connecting 1,800 km of regional and feeder roads and servicing the regions estimated 3 \nmillion people in the rural hinterland. It connects landlocked mountainous provinces to the coastal \nprovince of Morobe and the Lae maritime port. Lae port is PNG\u2019s largest, busiest, and single most \nimportant sea port, serving as the nation\u2019s international gateway and a regional transshipment \nhub for the eastern reaches of the South Pacific.  \n \n5.  Despite its importance to the region and the country, the Highlands Highway is in worse \ncondition than the overall national sealed road network. Nearly all sections of the Highlands \nHighway are in poor condition, primarily because the government lacks the capacity to plan and \nexecute  maintenance  works.  Although  about  70%  of  the  alignment  is  in  fair  maintainable \ncondition, most of these road sections demand immediate and significant repairs.2 Vast stretches \nof the road require emergency works, significant rehabilitation, upgrades, and periodic and routine \nmaintenance. \n \n6.  Because of the mountainous terrain and inadequate engineering design for PNG\u2019s climatic \nconditions,  washouts  and  landslides  are  common  during  the  rainy  season  and  make  the \nHighlands Highway impassable at times. Climate change is expected to increase the frequency \nof extreme rain events. Road safety is poor, and the safety rating for vehicle occupants and \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework for the investment program is in Appendix 1. \n2  Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "2 \npedestrians is 2-star and below.3 In its current state, the road conditions pose serious safety \nhazards to users and pedestrians, with levels of fatalities and injuries far exceeding those in \ndeveloped countries in Asia and the Pacific.4 \n \n7.  The poor condition of the Highlands Highway and the resulting inadequacy of transport \nservices have made the region\u2019s agricultural products costly, limiting their competitiveness in \ndomestic and international markets. The absence of agricultural logistics facilities further restricts \nthe development of value chains for perishable and high-value products. Thus, given most rural \nhouseholds  engage  in agricultural  livelihood  activities,  the  poor  condition  of the  Highlands \nHighway is a major constraint on the region\u2019s inclusive growth and sustainable development. \n \n8.  Strategic context, policy framework, and sector road map. This investment program \nis expected to have a transformational impact on PNG. Ensuring safe and efficient transport along \nthe Highlands Highway is a top government priority under PNG\u2019s Development Strategic Plan, \n2010\u20132030 and the National Transport Strategy, 2014\u20132030 (NTS). 5 The strategic emphasis is \non developing a safe and integrated transport network that ensures domestic and international \nconnectivity, and moving people and goods reliably at low cost. Additionally, the government\u2019s \npolicy framework as stipulated in the medium-term development plan (MTDP) for 2016\u20132017 also \ncalls for (i) increasing the proportion of roads that are in good condition, (ii) preserving investments \nin road infrastructure through road maintenance, (iii) encouraging a quality-based focus on new \nroad construction through integrated construction and maintenance contracting arrangements, \nand (iv) improving road safety infrastructure.6 \n \n9.  PNG\u2019s long-term road investment plan up to 2030 requires more than $17 billion for capital \ninvestment and maintenance, as per the NTS and associated MTDPs with an estimated financing \ngap of $10 billion indicating a significant demand for external financial assistance. Through both \nthe planned physical interventions and sector reforms, the investment program will assist in \nreducing the funding gap in PNG\u2019s road investment plan. Table 1 summarizes the estimated cost \nof PNG\u2019s long-term investment plan for road network development and maintenance. \n \nTable 1: Long-Term Investment Plan, 2016\u20132030 \n($ billion) \nItem  Amount \nRoad network development  13.55 \nRoad network maintenance  4.30 \n      Total   17.85 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates based on the NTS. \n \n10.  The Development Strategic Plan, NTS, and MTDP identify the Highlands Highway as the \ntop priority economic corridor because it is the nation\u2019s transport infrastructure backbone that links \nto many other economic corridors. The region\u2019s economic corridors, consisting of interprovincial \n                                                \n3  Road Assessment Services Limited. 2015.

The combined economic impact \nof this integrated development is expected to be greater than its parts. The MTDP also places \nsignificant importance on maintenance and rehabilitation. A maintenance sustainability analysis \nfocused on national roads has identified the existing gaps in planning, financing, and institutional \nresponsibilities.7 The investment program responds to these gaps through a long-term plan to \nrehabilitate,  upgrade  and  maintain  about  430  km  of  the  Highlands  Highway  and  develop \nsustainable economic corridors, consistent with the goals of the NTS and MTDP.8 \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s past investments, capacity development, and governance. In 2007, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) provided project loans to expand the capacity of the port facilities at \nLae.9 These works are now complete and options for port operations are being developed.10 In \n2008, ADB approved an MFF for the Highlands Region Road Improvement Investment Program \n(HRRIIP) to rehabilitate and improve priority sections of the core road network in the Highlands \nRegion.11 To date, this MFF is rated as \u201con track\u201d, having improved 343 km of the core feeder \nroad network that are connected to the Highlands Highway. In 2009, ADB approved an MFF for \nthe Civil Aviation Development Investment Program (CADIP), which includes the rehabilitation \nand upgrade of the airports at Mt. Hagen and Goroka, two key population centers along the \nHighlands Highway.12 The scheduled completion of these three major infrastructure programs \nreinforces the government\u2019s designation of the Highland Highway as a top development priority, \nwhich will also complete the rehabilitation of PNG\u2019s northern transport network. \n \n12.  In view of the long-term nature of institutional change and the need to have continuing \nengagement, the investment program carries forward the soft (i.e., nonphysical) infrastructure \nagenda being implemented under the existing HRRIIP. Under the HRRIIP, nonphysical outputs \nare  included  to  support  capacity  development,  improve  policy  frameworks,  and  strengthen \ngovernance of PNG government agencies involved in the road subsector. They include preparing \na  new  national  transport  development  plan,  increasing  road  user  charges,  establishing \nperformance-based  maintenance  contracts,  developing  the  capacity  of  the  National  Road \nAuthority (NRA), and increasing the focus on road safety. In July 2013, the government finalized \nthe NTS, which presents a strategic policy framework for the road subsector, anchored on clear \nprinciples for capital investment, maintenance, institutional change, and reform. The NTS also \noutlines the need for better planning and oversight, cost recovery, and adherence to best \npractices  on  procurement,  safety,  construction  standards,  traffic  management,  gender \nconsiderations,  and  improved  governance.  The  NTS  recognizes  better  budgeting,  financial \nmanagement, monitoring, evaluation, and training as essential for strengthening institutional \neffectiveness. \n \n                                                \n7  Maintenance Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  The investment program road is the 430 km section of the Highlands Highway from Lae Nadzab airport to Kagamuga \nairport, comprising of the 57 km Chimbu crossing, which requires full major rehabilitation, and the remaining 373 km \nrequiring restoration, upgrade, and maintenance. \n9  ADB. 2007.

Manila. \n ", "4 \n13.  The government has initiated several road subsector reforms to improve governance, \nalthough further efforts are needed to ensure that such initiatives gain broader and deeper \ntraction. On road maintenance financing, the government introduced road user charges through \na fuel tax and computerized vehicle registration fees, driver licensing fees, and mandatory \ninsurance programs, yet revenues are not being properly allocated for road maintenance works \nand the collective road user charges remain insufficient to provide full coverage of national road \nnetwork maintenance costs. On road maintenance contracting, the government introduced 5-year \nperformance-based maintenance contracts for the two roads completed under the first tranche of \nthe ongoing HRRIIP. The NRA was authorized by the government to manage these long-term \nperformance-based maintenance contracts, but clear delineation of maintenance responsibility \nbetween the NRA and the Department of Works (DOW) remains an issue, as does sufficient \nfunding for the NRA\u2019s current mandate. On road safety, Road Assessment Services Limited \ncompleted a comprehensive road safety study on the Highlands Highway in 2015 (footnote 6), \nand the staff and programs under the National Road Safety Council were centralized under the \nRoad Transport Authority in early 2017. \n \n14.  The investment program responds to the need to address institutional capacities and \ngovernance risks in the areas of (i) project management and contract administration, (ii) financial \nmanagement, and (iii) procurement. Through dialogue with PNG\u2019s central and sector agencies as \nwell as other participating partners, the governance concerns and corresponding measures to \naddress them are incorporated in the design and implementation of the investment program.13 \n \n15.  New multitranche financing facility and ADB value addition. The investment program \nrequires an overall investment of about $1 billion. The government has requested ADB to provide \na new MFF to rehabilitate, upgrade, and maintain the Highlands Highway through 2027. The MFF \nis consistent with the government\u2019s strategic development priorities and includes policies and \nreforms to strengthen institutional capacity and performance of the transport sector. The program \nis designed to be implemented through three tranches over a ten-year period. Detailed designs \nare fully completed for the first tranche and initial due diligence is under way for the remaining \ntwo tranches, but final designs will be prepared during MFF implementation.  \n \n16.  The investment program is included in ADB's country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 \nand country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for PNG, both of which indicate the importance \nof reducing transport and logistics costs to support sustainable development and inclusive \ngrowth. 14  With  the  road  subsector  accounting  for  90%  of  government  expenditures  on \ninfrastructure,  the  investment  program  provides  an  opportunity  to  increase  resources  and \ninstitutional  capacities  for  more  effective  and  sustainable  road  maintenance  planning  and \nimplementation in the Highlands Region. As such, the use of the ADB-financed MFF represents \nsignificant value added for the government\u2019s investment in the road subsector. \n \n17.  The MFF is the most suitable funding modality. Firstly, it offers predicable financing over \na long-term implementation period. It also offers the flexibility and ability to sequence investments, \nwhich is especially valuable given the fragile and conflict-affected situations in PNG. Collectively, \nthese design features of the MFF assist the budget programming of the government\u2019s counterpart \nfunds. Secondly, the MFF supports sustained engagement and policy dialogue on implementing \n                                                \n13 For example, aside from following ADB standards on procurement, financial management, and reporting, the \nnegotiated and signed project agreement documents stipulate that the DOW will provide sufficient counterpart staff \nto work with and learn from the international consultants of the program management office and will develop an \noperations and maintenance plan. \n14 ADB. 2015.

Manila.  \n ", "5 \nthe NTS, including sector governance reforms and maintenance financing. Thirdly, it presents an \nopportunity to mobilize significant cofinancing needed for the investment program. Thus, as \nhighlighted in the preceding paragraphs, all the preconditions for the MFF have been established: \n(i) Road Map (i.e., sector strategy), (ii) strategic context via the Country Partnership Strategy, (iii) \npolicy framework.  \n \n18.   With the ongoing MFFs for the HRRIIP and CADIP, the government, through the executing \nagencies, continues to develop a good record on MFF implementation in the transport sector. The \nexperience with the ongoing investment programs brings out emerging sector issues that are now \nincorporated in the design of this new MFF. The most important lessons revolve around new \nimplementation arrangements, including the use of larger contracts, improved contractor and \nconsultant quality gained through higher bidding standards and specifications, and regular ADB \nteam involvement led by its significant resources deployed in the field through the PNG Resident \nMission. \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n19.  The  investment  program  responds  to  the  government\u2019s  national  development  and \ntransport  strategies  for  promoting  inclusive  and  sustainable  development  of  the  Highlands \nRegion. The impacts are aligned with (i) increased opportunity for equality and prosperity in rural \nareas; (ii) attainment of well-integrated, safe, affordable, and financially and environmentally \nsustainable transport systems; and (iii) improved access to health and education, and improved \nliving standards of the people of PNG.15 The outcome will be increased efficiency and safe \nmovement of people, goods, and services between the Highlands Region and markets. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n20.  The  investment  program  outputs  will  be  (i)  about  430  km  of  the  two-lane  national \nHighlands Highway from Lae Nadzab Airport to Kagamuga Airport rehabilitated, upgraded, and \neffectively maintained; (ii) road safety on the national Highlands Highway increased; (iii) transport \nlogistics and services in the Highlands Region improved; and (iv) institutional capacity of DOW to \ndeliver the investment program and sustain its benefits strengthened. \n \n21.

The investment program will be financed from the following sources: (i) \nup to $610.0 million regular loans from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR), (ii) up to $70.0 \nmillion concessional loans from ADB\u2019s OCR, (iii) about $186.5 million in cofinancing,17 and (iv) \nabout $148.5 million in government contribution (Table 3). For tranche 1, the Government of \nAustralia has committed an $11.5 million grant to be administered by ADB. Although still evolving, \nsignificant cofinancing is expected for future tranches. Financing under the MFF will cover taxes \nand duties.18 \n \n25.  The government has requested an MFF of (i) up to $610 million regular loans from ADB\u2019s \nOCR; and (ii) up to $70.0 million concessional loans from ADB\u2019s OCR to finance part of the \n                                                \n16 To achieve economies of scale, value for money, and effectiveness, each major civil works package includes \nrehabilitation, upgrades, and maintenance. All three types of work have been planned and prioritized based on an \nengineering assessment of the entire length of the Highlands Highway and what is needed to restore and maintain \nit starting from the first tranche. For example, one section of the road may need urgent rehabilitation to restore it to \ngood  condition,  while  another  may  need  maintenance  to  prevent  deterioration.  Both  works  will  be  done \nsimultaneously to gradually restore and maintain the entire Highlands Highway to good condition. \n17 ADB-administered cofinancing will be approved by ADB Management consistent with Enhancing Operational \nEfficiency of the Asian Development Bank.

The  MFF  will  consist  of  three  tranches,  subject  to  the  government\u2019s \nsubmission of related periodic financing requests, execution of related loan agreements for each \ntranche, and fulfillment of the terms and conditions and undertakings set forth in the framework \nfinancing agreement.  \n \n26.  The first tranche of the MFF will be partially financed by an OCR regular loan of $272 \nmillion, an OCR concessional loan of $30 million and a grant of $11.5 million from the Government \nof Australia to be administered by ADB. The regular loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year \n(the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan); and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the government\u2019s choice of \nthe straight-line repayment option, the average maturity is 15.25 years, and the maturity premium \npayable to ADB is 0.2% per year. The concessional loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2.0% per year during the grace period and thereafter \n(the interest and other charges during construction and commitment charges to be capitalized in \nthe loan); and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nTable 3: Financing Plan for the Investment Program \nAmount  Total \nTranche 1  Tranche 2      Tranche 3       Amount         Share of \nSource  ($million)  ($ million)  ($ million)  ($ million)  Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank           \nOrdinary capital resources (regular \nloans)  272.0   191.0   147.0   610.0   60% \nOrdinary capital resources \n(concessional loans)  30.0   40.0   0.0  70.0   7% \nGovernment of Australia  11.5   0.0  0.0  11.5   1% \nOther Development Partners  0.0  115.0   60.0   175.0   17% \nGovernment  44.0   49.0   55.5   148.5   15% \nTotal  357.5   395.0   262.5   1,015.0   100% \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n27.   The DOW will be the executing agency for the investment program. Based on lessons \nlearned regarding implementation under HRRIP\u2019s existing project implementation units (PIUs), \nPMO will be established to administer the investment program. The PMO will be larger than the \nHRRIP PIUs and, as a single PMO for the duration of the MFF, it is designed to promote \nconsistency, uniformity, and continuity across the entire investment program; the PMO will also \nbuild the capacity of DOW through knowledge transfer and promote on-the-job learning by doing. \nThe organizational structure and staffing complement of the PMO directly responds to DOW\u2019s \ncapacity gaps in procurement, and financial management in addition to strengthening project \nmanagement and administration functions. \n \n28.  The DOW will outsource project management and contract administration to the private \nsector via construction supervision consultants and international specialists employed by the \nPMO. The underlying premise is that the quality of implementation depends largely on the quality \nof the contractors and consultants. DOW outlined terms of reference for independent construction \nsupervision with emphasis on in-house qualified staff for core jobs, quality, and timely reporting. \n ", "8 \nAn organizational structure for the PMO has been prepared, including interface channels with the \nDOW and specific terms of reference for all positions. In coordination and consultation with the \nDOW,  the  construction  supervision  and  PMO  consultants  will  be  required  to  clear  design \nproposals and payment requests against agreed contract schedules. All contracts will be subject \nto audits by independent external consultants. \n \n29.  All procurement will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2015, as amended from time to time). Consultants will be recruited following ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). As tranche 1 will be jointly \nfinanced by ADB and the Government of Australia through its Department of Foreign Affairs and \nTrade, universal procurement will be applied to works, goods, and consulting services to be \nfinanced under tranche 1.19 \n \n30.  ADB has taken specific actions to mitigate risks and ensure the efficient implementation \nof future  works  under the  investment  program  during  project  preparation  and  design. The \ninvestment program is at a high state of project readiness based on completed and ongoing due \ndiligence of all sections of the 430 km Highlands Highway. For tranche 1, DOW has prepared \nbidding documents and associated designs and bills of quantities using ADB standard bidding \ndocuments  for  large  works.  The  use  of  large  contract  packages  is  preferred  to  promote \ninternational competition and reduce procurement delays from numerous smaller packages. \n \n31.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe facility administration manual.20 \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  1 July 2017\u201321 June 2027 \nEstimated completion  31 December 2021 (first tranche); the first tranche will close on 30 June 2022, while the \ndate  MFF will close on 21 June 2027 \n(i)  Oversight bodies  Program Steering Committee: Chief secretary (chair), DTR secretary, DNPM secretary, \nDOT secretary; Secretary: Provincial administrators from Morobe, Eastern Highlands, \nChimbu, Jiwaka, and Western Highlands provinces. \n(ii)  Executing agency  DOW \n(iii)  Key implementing  DOW, NRA, DOT, NRSC (RTA) \nagencies \n(iv)  Implementation unit  PMO-DOW in Goroka, 30 staff \nProcurementa  International competitive bidding  12 contracts  $669 million \nNational competitive bidding  1 contract  $2 million \nConsulting services  Construction supervision contracts  1,700 person-months  $54 million \n(11), studies contracts (2), DOW  700 person-months  $15 million \ncapacity building and implementation     \nsupport (3), and  1,200 person-months  $18.5 million \nRoad Safety Community support (3)  280 person-months  $1.4 million \nRetroactive financing  Advance action for procurement of civil works and recruitment of consultants will be \nand/or advance  applied.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.    Technical \n \n32.  The technical viability of the proposed works under the investment program was confirmed \nduring program preparation. The preliminary design of works, bills of quantity, and associated \nbidding documents under tranche 1 were prepared including road maintenance, reconstruction, \nand upgrading; and road safety measures. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n33.  The investment program yields an economic rate of return of 16.4% and the first tranche \nyields 14.6% demonstrating their economic viability. The economic analysis is conservative, \nfocusing on the direct benefits generated from savings in vehicle operating costs and travel time \ncosts. Based on the two-lane road design, the unit costs for periodic and routine maintenance of \nthe Highlands Highway over the project life cycle are manageable. The financial sustainability \nanalysis demonstrates that the government has sufficient resources to meet the maintenance \nneeds of the Highlands Highway in the future (footnote 10), provided it follows best practices in \nasset management as articulated in the policy framework and priorities of the NTS. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n34.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to, and discussed \nwith,  the  government  and  the  DOW.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the facility administration manual. ADB found the government\u2019s \npolicies  and  procedures  on  financial  management,  procurement,  anticorruption,  and  other \ninstitutional issues and mechanisms to be satisfactory, albeit with substantial risks requiring \nmitigation measures.21 All bidding documents for contracts under the investment program will \ninclude provisions specifying ADB\u2019s right to audit records and accounts related to the MFF, as \nwell as those of all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate \nto the MFF. The DOW and the Department of Treasury will take additional measures to strengthen \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency under the MFF, primarily with direct payment \nprocedures. Key measures are (i) external auditing of contracts, project accounts, and financial \nstatements; (ii) PMO assistance in the drafting and evaluation of procurement documents; (iii) \npublic disclosure on all procurement matters; and (iv) verification of contractors\u2019 payment claims \nby supervision consultants following clearly defined contract specifications. \n \n                                                \n21 ADB\u2019s Office of Anticorruption and Integrity conducted three project procurement-related reviews in PNG of projects \nimplemented by the DOW: (i) the Road Maintenance and Upgrading (Sector) Project, published in 2016; (ii) the \nBridge Replacement for Improved Rural Access Sector Project, to be published in 2017; and (iii) the Highlands \nRegion Road Improvement Investment Program, projects 1 and 2, to be published in 2017. ADB\u2019s Pacific \nDepartment, in collaboration with the DOW, is continuously working with the Office of Anticorruption and Integrity to \naddress the key findings from these reviews. The ADB project team carefully considered these lessons when it \nprepared this report and recommendation of the President. \n ", "10 \n35.  The transport assessment identified governance weaknesses related to the financial \nsustainability of road infrastructure investments because of inadequate planning, budgetary \nallocations, and execution of maintenance works. The investment program will address these \nissues through long-term institutional strengthening and capacity building. International expertise \nprovided by the PMO will course sector reforms through government channels and guide the \nDOW through the application of international best practices as modified to the PNG context \nthrough the investment program.  \n \n36.  An institutional analysis and development plan was completed as part of the due diligence \nfor the investment program.22 Lessons learned from the ongoing road investment program \nidentified capacity gaps in the functionality of the DOW, the NRA, and the PIUs. ADB specifically \ndesigned a PMO to support the DOW in addressing these gaps to effectively administer the \ninvestment  program  from  beginning  to  end,  deliver  the  core  outputs,  strengthen  project \nmanagement capacities of the involved agencies, and promote required reforms for improved \nsector governance. By the end of the 10-year investment program, DOW staff will be trained to \nassume all necessary program implementation roles of the PMO. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n37.  The investment program is classified as a general intervention that will generate indirect \npoverty reduction impacts.23 Road users will benefit from shorter travel times and lower vehicle \noperating costs. Expanded access to improved roads will help drive the shift from subsistence to \nmarket-based agriculture, allowing farmers to grow commercial products that can be shipped to \nmarkets more quickly. Farmers may also diversify, cultivate high-value crops, and grow larger \nmarketable surpluses to improve their income-earning capacity. Connectivity will create more \nopportunities for about 3 million people living in the Highlands Region and their businesses, and \nwiden access to social services. \n \n38.  The gender action plan includes targeted activities to maximize benefits for communities \nand women along the investment program road. Specifically designed physical and nonphysical \ninterventions under the investment program include road safety improvements and awareness, \ndedicated female washing facilities and toilets, and roadside markets. The investment program \nalso sets minimum thresholds for women\u2019s participation and employment during construction. \nIncreased access to social services, economic opportunity, and consumer choice is expected to \nsignificantly increase the welfare of women and household incomes, and subsequently reduce \npoverty. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n39.  The impacts of tranche 1 on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples have been assessed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The \nDOW has prepared the required safeguards documents and mitigation measures in compliance \nwith  ADB  procedures  and  requirements  for  consultation  and  disclosure  to  the  public.  The \ngovernment has further illustrated its collective institutional capacity and commitment by agreeing \nto the institutional development plan, showing willingness to undertake an action plan to resolve \nany legacy land acquisition issues, and setting aside the funds required for land acquisition. \n \n                                                \n22 Institutional Analysis and Development Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "11 \n40.  The DOW prepared an environmental assessment and review framework, which sets out \na framework for screening, categorization, impact assessment, management, and monitoring for \nthe investment program. Works under tranche 1 are unlikely to result in significant adverse \nenvironmental impact, and any potential temporary impacts during construction such as noise, \nemissions, or waste generation can be adequately monitored and mitigated. Therefore, tranche \n1  is  classified  as  category  B  for  the  environment.  The  DOW  included  an  environmental \nmanagement and monitoring plan in the initial environmental examination it prepared for tranche \n1. \n \n41.  The DOW prepared a land acquisition and resettlement framework for the investment \nprogram, and undertook due diligence for land acquisition and resettlement impacts for the \nproposed works financed under tranche 1. Given that all the proposed works and other activities \nare  within  the  existing  road  alignment,  the  interventions  are  classified  as  category  C  for \ninvoluntary resettlement. No person who can be defined as indigenous is in the project areas. As \nsuch, the indigenous peoples\u2019 classification is category C, and indigenous peoples safeguard \nmeasures are not required. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n42.  The overall risk is substantial, but manageable through the application of mitigating \nmeasures. Integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh costs. Major risks and \nmitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.24 \nThe main risks include (i) macroeconomic, (ii) sustainability and reforms, (iii) weak public financial \nmanagement,  (iv)  a  lack  of  transparency  in  procurement,  and  (v)  implementation  delays \nassociated with project readiness and procurement. The security of personnel and equipment is \nalso a risk that will be mitigated by constantly having close consultations with communities along \nthe road alignment and employing significant levels of local labor from these communities in the \nconstruction and maintenance works. \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisk \nRisks  Assessment  Mitigating Measures \nMacroeconomic  High  Continuous monitoring of macroeconomic conditions; assessment of impacts of external \nshocks, particularly with respect to commodity prices; and coordination with other \ndevelopment partners will be undertaken. \nSustainability  Substantial  As per the investment program design and associated covenants, adequate future \nand reforms  funding will be set aside for maintenance. Planning will be improved, as well as \nbudgeting, financial management, monitoring, evaluation, and reporting. Institutional and \nsector governance reforms will be accelerated through the PMO, and associated training \nprovided under the investment program will clarify mandates and responsibilities leading \nto greater institutional effectiveness. The civil works contracts and concessions will \ninclude performance-based maintenance for an initial period of 5 years. \nWeak public  Substantial  A financial management assessment has been undertaken. The skills of DOW finance \nfinancial  and accounting staff in regional and provincial offices will be upgraded through rigorous \nmanagement  training. Regular coordination meetings will be conducted between DOW regional and \nprovincial staff to identify problems early and avoid delays in the preparation of reports. \nDOW will hasten the implementation of the IFMS to include all regional and provincial \noffices and have a single unified financial management system. \nLack of  Substantial  Through websites and published notices the government will provide and disclose (i) \ntransparency in  updated and detailed information on project implementation; (ii) information on selection \nprocurement  of consultants and contractors; (iii) independent verification of the quantity, quality, and \ncost of works; and (iv) expected service levels from performance-based contracts. \n                                                \n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12 \nImplementation  Substantial  Implementation  delays  may  be  caused  by  a  lack  of  project  readiness  and  the \ndelays  procurement process. Project readiness will be increased by preparing detailed designs \nassociated with  in advance of procurement; safeguards plans; procurement of goods, works, and \nproject readiness  services; funding for land acquisition; and all internal approvals before ADB approves \nand procurement  new tranches. Readiness will eliminate or reduce delays.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DOW = Department of Works, IFMS = integrated financial management system, PMO \n= program management office. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Department of Works of Papua New Guinea. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n43.  The government and DOW have assured ADB that implementation of the investment \nprogram shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as detailed \nin the facility administration manual and loan documents. \n \n44.  The government has given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, which are set forth in \nthe framework financing agreement. Specific covenants agreed to by the government and the \nDOW with respect to individual tranches under the MFF are set forth in the loan agreements for \nthe respective tranches. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n45.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the multitranche financing facility to Papua New Guinea for the Sustainable Highlands \nHighway Investment Program in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding the equivalent of \n$866,500,000, which comprises  \n \n(i)  the provision of loans from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with \ninterest and other terms to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility;  \n(ii)  the provision of loans from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, \nwith interest and other terms to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s applicable \npolicies relating to ordinary capital resources; and \n(iii)  ADB-administered cofinancing as set forth in paragraph 24; \n \nand is subject to such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the framework financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n1 June 2017 \n ", "Appendix 1  13 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nImpacts the Investment Program is Aligned with \nIncreased opportunity for equality and prosperity in rural areas (Development Strategic Plan, 2010\u20132030)a \nAttainment of well-integrated, safe, affordable, and financially and environmentally sustainable transport \nsystems that efficiently serve the economy and people of PNG (National Transport Strategy, 2014\u20132030)b \nImproved access to health and education, and living standards of the people of PNG (National Strategy \nfor Responsible Sustainable Development for Papua New Guinea)c \n  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2028     \nIncreased  a.
