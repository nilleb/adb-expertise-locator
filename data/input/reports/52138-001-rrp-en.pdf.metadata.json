At least 50% of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) facility will be for loans \nin lagging states.1 As a result of the ADB intervention, FICC will also implement a gender action \nplan (GAP) to expand its lending to women-led MSMEs in India. At least 60% of the ADB facility \nwill finance loans to women MSME borrowers.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nMicro, small, and medium-sized enterprises sector. Based on the findings of the 2018 \nreport of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) on the MSME sector in India, the country \nhad an estimated 55.8 million (nonagricultural) MSMEs in fiscal year (FY) 2017, operating (top 5 \nindustries) in retail (46.0%), food products and beverages (6.0%), apparel (5.0%), motor vehicle \nrepair  (4.0%),  and  textiles  (3.0%).3  Predominately  unregistered,  94.9%  of  MSMEs  were \nmicroenterprises,  4.9%  were  small  enterprises,  and  0.2%  were  medium-sized  enterprises.4 \nMSMEs  accounted  for  about  31%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and  45%  of  exports,  and \nemployed  more  than  124  million  people.  Approximately  59.5%  of  MSMEs  are  located  in  rural \nareas and 40.5% are in urban areas. For MSMEs the lack of adequate access to finance is seen \nas a major obstacle to growth, with 84% of all MSMEs self-financing or using informal finance \nsources and only 16% of MSMEs accessing credit from formal financial institutions. The lack of \nreadily accessible finance is even more acute for women-led MSMEs. \n \n4. \nWomen in the micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises sector. MSMEs owned by \nwomen  accounted  for  14.0%\u201320.4%  of  all  MSMEs  in  FY2017.5  Based  on  a  2014  IFC  study, \napproximately 78% of enterprises owned by women are in the services sector.6 For this and other \nreasons,  women  entrepreneurship  is  largely  skewed  toward  smaller  firms,  with  almost  98%  of \nbusinesses owned by women categorized as microenterprises. Low levels of women-ownership \nof small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are common in many countries in the region. In \nSouth Asia, only 9% of SMEs are owned by women.7 Access to formal finance is one key barrier \n\n \n\n1  Government of India, Ministry of Finance. 2013.  Report of the Committee for Evolving a Composite  Development \nIndex of States. New Delhi. The report identified India\u2019s lagging states, low-income states with high poverty incidence, \nand  special  category  states.  These  include  Assam,  Bihar,  Chhattisgarh,  Himachal  Pradesh,  Jharkhand,  Madhya \nPradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, \nand West Bengal. \n\n2  The terms \u201cwomen-led\u201d and \u201cwomen MSME borrowers\u201d include women borrowers and co-borrowers. \n3  IFC. 2018.

Gender Tool Kit: Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprise Finance and Development. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fto the growth of women-owned businesses, leading to more than 90% of finance requirements \nbeing met through informal sources. The financing gap for women-owned MSMEs totaled \u20b96.37 \ntrillion  or  roughly  73%  of  total  demand  in  FY2012.  Women  have  more  difficulties  than  men  in \naccessing  credit  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  limited  awareness  and  understanding  of \nfinancial products because of their lack of financial education and unfamiliarity with formal banking \ninstitutions, lack of collateral to guarantee credit, difficulty in presenting their personal profiles and \ntrack records, the requirement for support from male family members for loan applications, and \nother discriminatory practices by loan officers (footnote 7). In recognition of the difficulties faced \nby MSMEs, particularly those owned by women, the Government of India has launched several \ninitiatives  designed  to  achieve  greater  participation  of  women  in  the  sector  and  enhance \nenterprise growth.8 \n \nRationale. Notwithstanding the size of the financial sector and the significant strides the \n5. \ngovernment is making in its financial inclusion strategy, access to finance in India remains a key \nissue,  with  fewer  than  7%  of  adults  accessing  loans  through  formal  channels.9  In  rural  areas, \naccess to finance is even more scarce, with only 5% of rural residents reporting having borrowed \nto start, operate, or expand a business (footnote 3). The 2018 IFC report on India\u2019s MSME sector \nidentified MSMEs\u2019 lack of adequate access to finance as the biggest challenge to further growth \nand underlies the reason why most micro and small enterprises do not graduate to become formal \njob-making  SMEs  (footnote  3).  Banks  have  typically  limited  exposure  to MSMEs  because  of  a \nhigher risk perception and MSMEs\u2019 limited access to immovable collateral. Given the continued \nneed to address credit access issues and to support the government\u2019s financial inclusion efforts, \nADB  has  identified  financial  institution  partners  that  have  demonstrated  the  ability  to  reach \nunderbanked segments on  a profitable and sustainable basis  and support the  development  of \nIndia\u2019s  \u201cmissing  middle\u201d  \u2013  SMEs  and  the  lower  middle-income  segment  \u2013  through  their \ninvolvement with MSMEs. One such institution is FICC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Fullerton \nFinancial Holdings (FFH). Incorporated as a nonbank finance institution (NBFI) in India in 2005, \nFICC  targets  the  lower-income  and  emerging  middle-income  segments,  providing  MSME \nbusiness  credit  in  rural  and  urban  India.  Over  the  past  several  years,  FICC  has  become  an \nimportant institution in the market, with total assets under management (AUM) of \u20b9194.7 billion \nas of the end of the first 9 months of FY2019 (9MFY2019). Present across 22 states and 3 union \nterritories, FICC has 616 branches that cover more than 600 towns and 55,000 villages, staffed \nby over 13,600 employees who serve 3 million customers. \n \nB. \n \nOverview. FICC has established a core market niche serving the customer segment with \n6. \nan income range that is below the level traditionally targeted by banks and above the level served \nby microfinance institutions. FICC estimates that nearly 75 million households in India fall within \nthis  category,  comprised  of  self-employed  and  salaried  individuals  with  incomes  that  range \nbetween  \u20b9200,000\u2013\u20b9450,000  per  annum  (approximately  $2,800\u2013$6,400)  in  rural  areas  and \n\u20b9450,000\u2013\u20b91.1 million (approximately $6,400-$15,800) in urban areas. To address the unmet and \nunderserved needs of this segment for tailored financial services, FICC has adopted differentiated \nrural  (includes  semi-urban)  and  urban  strategies  to  engage  efficiently  across  the  customers\u2019 \nbusiness and income growth life cycles, with deliberate and distinct product and strategy mixes. \nFICC\u2019s  rural  business  products  are  marketed  under  the  Gramshakti  brand  and  include  group \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n \n\n8  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  World Bank. Financial Inclusion Data/Global Findex: India. World Bank financial inclusion data for 2017, the latest \nyear reported in its database, show only 8% of males and 5% of females over the age of 15 in India borrowed from \na financial institution. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\floans to women borrowers, MSME working capital loans, loans against property (LAP), and two-\nwheeler loans. The product mix for urban clients includes SME and commercial vehicle loans, the \nlatter of which is a new product with demonstrated high growth potential.10 \n \nBusiness  strategy.  FICC  seeks  to  build  on  its  market  position  as  a  financial  services \n7. \ncompany  focused  on  MSMEs  and  other  underserved  low-income  segments  and  scale  its \noperations  across  India.  Specific  plans  include  expanding  its  branch  network  from  616  as  of \n9MFY2019 to 790 as of fiscal year end (FYE) 2021, opening most of these new branches in rural \nareas, in line with the demand\u2013supply dynamics of the market. During this period, FICC targets \nincreasing the contribution of rural segment loans from 33% to 40% of the portfolio. Beyond its \ngeographical expansion, the company also aims to expand its product portfolio in new secured \nbusiness  segments,  such  as  consumer  durable  loans,  dairy  loans,  and  loans  against  shares. \nComplementing the \u201chigh touch\u201d aspects of FICC\u2019s business strategy is the use of high-tech digital \ntechnology. FICC has invested considerably in the development of its digital technology platform \nto leverage multichannel availability of lending solutions. FICC also uses digital tools to assist in \nits business decision-making process, including using analytics to better target clients, automating \npart  of  the  credit  approval  process,  managing  return  volatility,  identifying  early  indications  of \nstress, and guiding deployment of collection resources based on score cards. In time, FICC seeks \nto  provide  a  fully  digitized  onboarding  process,  starting  from  biometric-enabled  know-your-\ncustomer  forms  to  digitally  accepted  electronic  agreements,  using  geo-location  and  electronic \ndata validation  of  application information,  and  finally  to  online  platforms for  customer  servicing \nthrough web- and mobile-based self-service. This will be complemented by mobile wallets and \nonline payment platforms to improve the effectiveness of collections processes. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nOwnership. FICC is a wholly owned subsidiary of FFH. FFH has 4.31% direct ownership \nof FICC, while the remaining 95.69% is indirectly held through Angelica Investments Pte. Ltd., a \nSingapore-based  asset  management  company  and  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  FFH. \nEstablished in 2003, FFH is a long-term strategic and operating investor in financial and related \nservices  in  emerging  markets  throughout  Asia.  FFH  is  wholly  owned  by  Temasek  Holdings \n(Private)  Limited,  a  Singapore-based  global  investment  company.  FFH  provides  financial \nproducts and services to the lower-income and emerging middle-class customer segments, and \nMSMEs through  its  various  holdings  across the region.  Integrity  due  diligence  was  conducted, \nand no significant or potentially significant integrity risks were found.11 The beneficial owners do \nnot appear to constitute a significant or potentially significant integrity risk, in the absence of any \nunresolved or substantiated adverse media or other information related to the individuals.12 \n \n9. \nCorporate governance. FICC has a robust and experienced board of directors, following \nthe regulatory requirements of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Securities and Exchange \nBoard of India, the country\u2019s capital markets regulator. The nine-member board is comprised of \nfive independent directors with expertise in the financial services industry, FFH\u2019s chief executive \nofficer (CEO), FICC\u2019s managing director, and two nonexecutive directors representing FFH. The \nboard\u2019s  committee  structure  includes  the  audit,  risk  oversight,  nomination  and  remuneration, \ncorporate  social  responsibility,  and  information  technology  strategy  committees,  as  well  as  a \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n \n\n10 FICC  also  launched  a  housing  finance  business  in  December  2015  through  the  creation  of  the  wholly  owned \n\nsubsidiary Fullerton India Home Finance Company, which operates through 82 branches in 13 states. \n\n11 ADB. 2003.

FICC also has four operational \nmanagement committees\u2014for assets and liabilities, operational risk, borrowings, and customer \nservice and grievances. The operating committees are supported by members of FFH as special \ninvitee members. \n \n10.  Management.  FICC  has  a  highly  experienced  management  team  led  by  managing \ndirector  and  CEO  Ms.  Rajashree  Nambiar.  The  former  CEO  and  executive  director  of  India \nInfoline Finance Ltd. (the NBFI arm of the IIFL Group), Ms. Nambiar has more than 25 years of \nbanking  and  financial  sector  experience.  FICC\u2019s  senior  management  team  has  more  than  15 \nyears\u2019  experience  on  average  and  a  strong  track  record  of  leading  business  units  in  their \nrespective  segments  at  various  international  and  domestic  banks  as  well  as  at  other  large \ncorporations. FICC also benefits from the strong support of its parent company, FFH, in terms of \ntechnical  expertise.  The  senior  management  team  from  FFH  regularly  participates  in  FICC\u2019s \nmonthly asset\u2013liability and credit risk reviews through designated committees and continuously \nprovides support and guidance. \n \n11. \nRisk management. FICC has a well-defined risk appetite framework that is approved by \nthe  board  of  directors.  The  risk  framework  sets  defined  risk  limits  for  each  credit,  liquidity, \noperational, and reputational risk to balance returns and earnings targets with core financial needs \nfor  solvency  and  volatility  management.  In  terms  of  organizational  structure,  FICC\u2019s  chief  risk \nofficer  reports  directly  to  the  board  of  directors  and  to  the  board  of  director\u2019s  risk  oversight \ncommittee on a quarterly basis at a minimum. The four-member board risk oversight committee \nmaintains  responsibility  for  oversight  and  monitoring  of  the  company\u2019s  risk  framework,  with \nprogram approval directly reviewed by FFH\u2019s risk management team. \n \nD. \n \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n12. \nprovided to FICC in one or both of the following modalities described in Table 1: \n \n\nADB\u2019s  secured  debt  financing  up  to  $150  million  (in  Indian  rupee  equivalent)  will  be \n\nTable 1: Financing Modalities \n\nStructure Options \nOn or Offshore \n\nNonconvertible Debentures \n(8 years) \n\nOnshore domestic debenture\u2014senior \nsecured, settled in \u20b9 \n\nBilateral External Commercial Borrowing \n(ECB) Loan \n(8 years) \n\nOnshore senior secured loan\u2014settled in \u20b9 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n13. \nNonconvertible debentures, a bilateral loan, or a combination of these two modalities will \nbe considered, depending on market conditions and client needs. ADB\u2019s financing will be senior \nsecured, with recourse to FICC\u2019s balance sheet. ADB may enter into risk transfers with eligible \ncounterparties for a portion of the exposure. \n \nB. \n \n14. \nUse of proceeds. FICC will use the proceeds of ADB\u2019s facility to finance loans to MSMEs \nin India. At least 50% of the ADB facility will be for loans in lagging states, where financial inclusion \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nlevels are lower than elsewhere in the country. FICC will also implement a GAP to expand lending \nto women-led MSMEs across India. At least 60% of the ADB facility will finance loans to women \nMSME borrowers. \n \nReporting  arrangements.  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  will  carry  out \n15. \nproject monitoring. FICC will provide ADB with financial reports at predetermined regular intervals \nand  as  requested,  including  (i)  quarterly  unaudited  financial  statements,  (ii) annual  audited \nfinancial  statements,  (iii)  semiannual  compliance  certificates  for  financial  covenants,  (iv) \nsemiannual reports  on  the  use  of  ADB  proceeds for  loans  in  lagging  states  and  to  women-led \nMSMEs, (v) annual reports on selected development indicators agreed by ADB and the borrower, \nand (vi) GAP implementation monitoring. \n \nEvaluation. Monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB regularly and at \n16. \nleast  annually.  The  first  report  will  be  submitted  no  later  than  12  months  after  the  first \ndisbursement. \n \nC. \n \n17. \nProvide  access  to  longer  tenor  debt.  The  proposed  transaction  will  support  FICC\u2019s \ngrowth  as  it  further  builds  its  presence  in  rural  areas  and  provides  increasing  access  to \nunderserved  clients  in  India\u2019s  lagging  states.  ADB\u2019s  longer  -term  debt  financing  will  provide \nneeded resources to help FICC manage its longer-term loans in both rural and urban areas as \nthe  company  expands  its  secured  and  unsecured  MSME  business  loan  portfolios.  ADB\u2019s \nproposed loan facility will also support FICC\u2019s efforts to narrow the asset\u2013liability management \ngap in its 3\u20135-year and greater than 5 years duration buckets where local markets are unable to \nprovide  reasonable funding  sources.  FICC  estimates that  it  will  need  \u20b975  billion  per  annum  of \nadditional  debt  funding  during  FY2019\u2013FY2021  to meet  its  overall  growth  targets.  ADB\u2019s  debt \nfinancing  of  up  to  $150  million  (in  Indian  rupee  equivalent)  will  support  FICC\u2019s  longer  tenor \nfinancing and would be equivalent to 10% of this requirement for the next 12 months. \n \n18. \nSupport  the  growth  of  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  and  the \ndevelopment  of  the  missing  middle.  ADB  funding  will  support  the  growth  of  FICC\u2019s  MSME \nfinancing portfolio, helping improve access to finance for the missing middle, specifically targeting \nthe  female  missing-middle,  and  providing  needed  financial  products  and  services  to  this \nunderserved  segment.  In  addition  to  providing  MSMEs\u2014many  of  which  are  in  rural  areas  or \nlagging  states  and/or  women-led\u2014with  access  to  finance  for  working  capital  and  investment \nneeds, this transaction will promote entrepreneurship and contribute to enterprise development. \n \n19. \nSupport Fullerton India Credit Company\u2019s gender action plan to increase access to \nfinance  for  women-led  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises.  The  full  potential  of \nwomen-led MSMEs is constrained by their limited access to finance and the credit needed to start \nand grow their businesses (para. 4). The situation is further compounded by the limited awareness \nand understanding of financial products by many women-led MSMEs, the lack of experience with \nbanking institutions; the lack of collateral with which to guarantee credit; and the requirement, in \nmany instances, of having a male family member cosign the loan application (footnote 6). FICC\u2019s \ntotal loan portfolio will more than double over the next 5 years; however, growth of the women \nMSME loan portfolio will increase by  only 1.5 times because of the aforementioned issues, as \nwell as the challenges of outreach to women clients, especially in rural areas and lagging states \n(footnote 6). It is important to note, however, that FICC targets more than 60% of its borrowers to \nbe women, well above the national baseline in which only 5% of women borrowed from a formal \nfinancial institution in 2017. Therefore, ADB\u2019s funding of FICC will contribute to reducing gender \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nfinancing gaps. The size of a business can affect its capacity to access higher levels of credit. \nSince most women\u2019s businesses are microenterprises and men\u2019s businesses tend to be small or \nmedium-sized,  the  average  size of  loans to  female borrowers  is  also  significantly  smaller than \nthat to male borrowers. The GAP developed through this transaction, especially the use of tools \nto target women borrowers and lagging regions, as well as the development of gender-inclusive \nfinancial products, will strengthen and expand FICC\u2019s effort to provide financial services to women \nentrepreneurs and contribute to the objective of increasing the participation of women-led MSMEs \nin the sector. This will be complemented by new activities committed to by FICC as part of this \nproject to provide women with relevant financial and digital literacy skills, access to leadership \npositions, and opportunities for young women to acquire new skills and employment. \n \nD. \n \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nOutcomes. The project will sustainably expand FICC\u2019s lending activities to MSMEs. \n\n \nA. \n \n20. \nImpact.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  access  to  finance  for  the \nunderserved enhanced in alignment with the Government of India\u2019s financial inclusion agenda, \nwhich  highlights  the  delivery  of  affordable  banking  and  other  financial  services  to  unserved  or \nunderserved  groups  as  a  means  to  promote  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive  growth  through \nemployment generation.13 \n \n21. \n \n22. \nOutputs.  The  outputs  will  be  that  (i)  FICC\u2019s  capacity  for  MSME  lending,  particularly  to \nwomen is increased; (ii) FICC\u2019s lending activities to rural and semi-urban segments is increased; \n(iii) that FICC\u2019s lending in lagging states is sustainably expanded; (iv) FICC\u2019s institutional capacity \nto  render  services  to  female  employees  is  enhanced;  and  (v)  FICC\u2019s  corporate  social \nresponsibility programs targeting female beneficiaries are sustained and expanded to new areas. \n \nB. \n \n23. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  ADB\u2019s  new  long-term \ninstitutional  framework,  Strategy  2030,  emphasizes  ADB  support  for  the  financial  sector  by \nhelping develop financial infrastructure, institutions, and products and services.14 The transaction \nwill  contribute  to  financial  sector  development  by  supporting  the  growth  of  an  NBFI  which  is \nimportant  to  providing  increased  access  to  finance  for  MSMEs  in  India.15  According  to  ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2018\u20132022 for India, ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations will continue \nto support the three country partnership strategy strategic priorities in a crosscutting manner by \ncatalyzing  financial  sector  development.16  The  transaction  will  support  the  development  of  the \nMSME sector in India, particularly in rural areas, as part of one of the strategy\u2019s three key pillars \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n \n\n13 Project defined based on the Government of India\u2019s financial inclusion agenda, which includes such initiatives as the \nPradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (Prime Minister\u2019s People Money Scheme), priority sector lending, and the digital \nIndia  scheme;  ADB.  2017.

The  potential \nenvironmental and social impacts of the proposed investments and associated risks have been \nassessed, as well as the company\u2019s commitment to and capacity for environmental and social \nmanagement. FICC will not use the proceeds of ADB\u2019s funding to finance projects with category \nA impacts on the environment or category A or B impacts for involuntary settlement or indigenous \npeoples. FICC will apply ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list, ensure that investments using \nADB  funds  abide  by  applicable  national  laws  and  regulations,  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement, and establish and maintain an environmental and social management system \nsatisfactory to ADB before the first disbursement of the loans.19 FICC\u2019s environmental and social \nmanagement  system  includes  arrangements  to  comply  with  national  labor  laws,  ADB\u2019s  Social \nProtection Strategy (2001), and internationally recognized core labor standards. Since the project \ninvolves the financing of MSMEs with ADB proceeds, it will have very limited direct climate change \nimpact.  \n \n26. \nEffective gender mainstreaming. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development, \nFICC  will  commit  to  incorporating  measures  to  promote  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s \nempowerment in its business activities. Key features of the GAP proposed by ADB include targets \nto (i) increase access of women-led MSMEs to FICC\u2019s loan products, customized to address the \nneeds of women borrowers; (ii) increase  the number of women employees in FICC as well as \nwomen representation in branches and senior management; (iii) improve the competency of FICC \nemployees to deliver services responsive to the needs of women borrowers; and (iv) strengthen \nits corporate social responsibility program by targeting women beneficiaries and introduce new \nwomen-focused initiatives that enhance the skills of women on computer literacy, online business, \nand entrepreneurship. FICC will submit periodic reports on implementation of gender measures \nto ADB. \n \nB. \n \n27. \nFICC was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  FICC\u2019s  know-your-\ncustomer and anti-money-laundering policies (subject to annual board approval in May of each \nyear),  in  addition  to  RBI  requirements,  mitigate  the  risks  of  money  laundering  and  terrorist \nfinancing.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions \nprohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in \nthe event of noncompliance. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n\n17 ADB.  2013.
