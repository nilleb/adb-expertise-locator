THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $50,000,000 to Indorama Ventures Global Services Limited (IVGS) for the Indorama \nVentures Regional Blue Loan Project in India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. The report \nalso describes the proposed administration of a loan of up to $50,000,000 to be provided by the \nLeading Asia\u2019s Private Infrastructure Fund (LEAP),1 and if the Board approves the proposed loan, \nI, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the LEAP \nloan. \n \n2.  The loan will support Indorama Ventures group (IVG), a global integrated polyethylene \nterephthalate  (PET)  manufacturer,  for  their  expansion  of  PET  recycling  capacity  in  India, \nIndonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing will help \npromote a circular economy for recycled PET (rPET) with industry best practices in ADB\u2019s \ndeveloping  member  country  (DMC).  The  loan  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first  internationally  verified \nnonsovereign blue loan, and ADB\u2019s involvement will also ensure compliance with rigorous \nenvironmental and social safeguard standards. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT  \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n3.  Plastics is a material of choice because of its availability, versatility, functionality, flexibility, \nand affordability. This has led to a surge in plastics production from 15 million tons (t) in 1964 to \n311 million t in 2014.2 Historically, plastics were mostly produced in Europe and the United States, \nbut that has changed; as of 2015, half of the world\u2019s plastics production has taken place in Asia.3 \nPlastics production is correlated primarily with decreasing poverty, growing incomes, and rising \nconsumption in fast-growing emerging markets.4 However, the cheapness and convenience of \nplastic also make it ubiquitous, resulting in one of earth\u2019s greatest environmental challenges.5 \nIndeed, plastics production is a primary driver of natural resource depletion, waste, environmental \ndegradation, and climate change; additionally, it has adverse health effects. \n \n4.  In 2019, 95% of plastic packaging material value was lost after a short first use. More than \n40 years after the launch of the first universal recycling symbol, only 14% of plastic packaging is \ncollected for recycling. This has led to an enormous marine plastic pollution problem that \ncontinues to grow. An estimated 150 million t of plastic is already in the ocean, and every year 8\u2013\n12 million t of plastic are added (footnote 2). Asia accounts for more than 80% of the total release \nof plastic into the ocean. The damage of plastic litter to marine ecosystems is estimated to cost \nat least $13 billion per year.6 Furthermore, plastic waste blocks rivers, streams, drains, and \nsewers, exacerbating flooding and creating breeding grounds for pests that transmit vector-borne \ndiseases.7 \n \n1   Financing partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). \n2   World Economic Forum, Ellen MacArthur Foundation and McKinsey & Company. 2016.

Nairobi. \n7  More than 90 % of plastics produced globally are derived from fossil fuel and plastics represents about 6% of global \noil consumption. If growth continues as expected, plastics will account for 20% of total oil consumption by 2050. \n ", "2 \n5.  Marine plastic pollution is a complex multi-sectoral problem, largely resulting from (i) mass \nvolumes of low-residual value, single-use, non-degradable plastics; and (ii) inefficient solid waste \nmanagement and insufficient recycling systems. Plastic packaging is the most common item \nfound during international coastal cleanups. Therefore, the traditional \u201ctake, make, dispose\" \napproach  should  be  replaced  by  a  circular  economy  in  which  products  and  materials  are \nredesigned, recovered, and reused to divert plastic waste away from landfills and oceans and to \nreduce the environmental impact. Reduction of plastic waste, use of recyclable plastics, and \nimprovement of collection and recycling systems should go hand in hand to enable the transition.  \n \n6.  There have been increasing calls for action on marine plastic, including the Statement on \nCombating Marine Plastic Debris by the East Asian Summit Leaders in 2018. Many governments \nare taking steps towards the eliminations of problematic or unnecessary plastic packaging through \nregulatory or other policy actions (footnote 5). However, private sector responsibility is needed to \ntackle this issue throughout supply chains and lifecycles. Leading global food and beverage \nbrands are making commitments to increase the use of recycled materials for their products.  \n \n7.  PET is a type of plastic widely used in beverage bottles; global demand for PET reached \n25.8 million t per annum in 2018. PET products are durable, transparent, lightweight, non-reactive, \ncost-effective, and thermally stable, and PET is preferred to other types of plastic materials in \nterms of its environmental footprint since it can be recycled repeatedly.8 However, although PET \nhas a higher recycling rate than any other type of plastic, there is room for improvement: globally, \nclose to half of PET is not collected for recycling, and only 7% is recycled bottle-to-bottle (footnote \n2). In Asia, the collection rate of PET varies by country: it is more than 80% in Indonesia and \nThailand, and only 40% in the Philippines. While PET has the greatest potential among plastic \nmaterials for the creation of a circular economy, PET\u2019s collection rate needs to be increased, there \nneeds to be better sorting, and more use of rPET in PET products will be required to reduce \ndisposal of PET into landfills and oceans in ADB\u2019s DMCs.9  \n \n8.  Project  selection.  CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION  DELETED.  Despite  higher \nproduction  cost  of  rPET  compared  to  virgin  PET,  global  food  and  beverage  brands  have \nincreasing demand for rPET as they have commitments to increase recycled plastic content in \npackaging to comply with European Union regulations. These global brands in turn require the \nsuppliers of their packaging materials, including IVG, to use rPET. IVG has established long-term, \nstrong sales relationships with a range of global brands, and is itself one of the signatories of the \nNew Plastics Economy.10 The idea behind this initiative is to improve the circularity of plastic \npackaging. To fulfill this objective, IVG aims to recycle 750,000 t of post-consumer PET bottles \nby  2025.  In  addition,  IVG  is  working  with  brand  owners  CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION \nDELETED and government agencies in its operating countries to ensure that PET bottles are \ncollected and sent to recycling plants. PET producers such as IVG are the key players in this \nsupply chain to increase the use of rPET, since they aggregate post-consumer PET, produce \n \n8  Coca-Cola has announced that Sweden, in 2020, and the Netherlands and Norway, in 2021, will become the first \ncountries in the world to make all its plastic bottles from 100% rPET.  \n9  In general, current policies tend to focus on the amount of plastic materials collected. Without proper sorting of the \ncollected materials and demand for recycled plastics including PET, this can create large stocks of recyclable plastics \nwhich may be ultimately incinerated, resulting in GHG emissions.   \n10 Ellen MacArthur Foundation. New Plastics Economy. Launched in 2018 by the United Nations Environment \nProgramme and the Ellen McArthur Foundation, the New Plastics Economy aims to create long-term systemic value \nby fostering a working afteruse economy, drastically reducing leakage and decoupling plastics from fossil feedstocks. \nMore than 400 organizations have joined the movement and many top tier companies such as Coca-Cola, Nestl\u00e9, \nand Unilever have pledged to make their packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable. \n ", "3 \nrPET, and supply it as packaging and other materials.11 ADB has identified IVG as a reputable \nglobal industry leader with which to partner in tackling marine plastic pollution and promoting a \nplastic circular economy because: (i) IVG can create monetary value from post-consumer PET to \ngive incentives for collection which will reduce the amount of post-consumer PET released into \nthe environment, and (ii) IVG can transfer advanced technologies from its rPET facilities in Europe \nand the United States to ADB\u2019s DMCs, capable of producing rPET to the standard required for \nfurther bottle-to-bottle recycling.  \n \nB.  Project Design \n9.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  be  provided  as  a  general  corporate  loan to  IVGS. IVGS  will \ndownstream the loan proceeds to subproject companies for: (i) expansion and operation of PET \nrecycling plants; and (ii) other sustainability initiatives, including energy efficiency, clean energy, \nand other sustainability projects; in India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. The rPET \nplants will produce rPET flakes and single-pellet solutions that will be processed into bottles and \nother PET products. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n10.  The entire ADB loan will be externally verified as a green loan based on the Green Loan \nPrinciples.12 Furthermore, the majority of the loan that will be utilized for IVG\u2019s rPET facilities will \nbe externally verified as a blue loan, following the Blue Natural Capital Financing Facility Blue \nBond Guidelines,13 and will also be assessed against ADB\u2019s Oceans Finance Framework once \nthe framework is operational and if it demonstrates a significant and quantifiable contribution \ntowards its objective.14 It will be ADB\u2019s first internationally verified nonsovereign blue loan. \n \nC.  Borrower and Group \n11.  The borrower, IVGS, was established as IVG\u2019s treasury entity at which its international \nborrowings are consolidated, and is a 99.9% owned subsidiary of Indorama Ventures Public \nCompany Limited (IVL), which is the listed holding entity of IVG. IVG is a Thailand-based global \npetrochemical producer of PET, purified terephthalic acid, ethylene oxide, ethylene glycol, and \npolyester fibers. It is the world\u2019s largest integrated PET producer, operating 119 manufacturing \nfacilities in 33 countries across 5 continents. IVL is listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand and \nhad a total market capitalization of B115.7 billion ($3.7 billion) as of 2 October 2020.   \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n14.   Impact of COVID-19 pandemic. There has been a slowdown of the petrochemical sector \nin general and a decline in demand for IVG\u2019s various products because of the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic. However, the impact is not considered significant for its PET segment. \nIVG\u2019s combined PET segment has seen resilient demand despite lockdowns in many markets, \nreflecting the essential nature of PET products even during the COVID-19 pandemic. ADB\u2019s \n \n11 Although bottle-to-bottle recycling is still not allowed in some countries (such as Thailand), rPET can be used for \nother purposes such as fiber. While IVG aims to increase bottle-to-bottle recycling as much as possible, they are \ncommitted to increase the use of rPET in products regardless of regulatory constraints.  \n12 The Green Loan Principles are based on the Green Bond Principles.

The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) Sustainable Development \nGoal (SDG) 14, target 14.1 (by 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, \nin particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution) achieved; \n(ii) SDG 12, target 12.5 (by 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, \nreduction, recycling and reuse) achieved; and (iii) SDG 13 (take urgent action to combat climate \nchange and its impacts) achieved.16 \n \n16.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: quantity of plastic for recycling in \nIndia,  Indonesia,  the  Philippines,  and  Thailand  increased;  employment  generated;  and \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions avoided. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n  \n17  Outputs. The project will have the following outputs: (i) PET recycling capacity of IVG is \nexpanded in India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand; and (ii) blue and green loan status is \nachieved.  \n  \nE.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n18.  Consistency  with  ADB  strategy.  The  project  is  consistent  with  and  supports  two \noperational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) operational priority 3 (tackling climate change, \nbuilding  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability);  and \n(ii) operational priority 4 (making cities more livable). It also supports Strategy 2030\u2019s objectives \nof fostering regional cooperation and integration, and for ADB to expand private sector operations \nand to pursue development impact.17  \n \n19.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project aligns \nwith ADB\u2019s Action Plan for Healthy Oceans and Sustainable Blue Economies,18 which calls for \nADB to expand its investments and technical assistance to $5 billion during 2019\u20132024. One of \nthe key objectives of the plan is to reduce land-based sources of marine pollution including \nplastics. ADB is also working on the Oceans Financing Initiative (consistent with the global \nSustainable Blue Economy Finance Principles, to which ADB is in the process of becoming a \nsignatory), to create opportunities for the private sector to invest in bankable projects that will help \nimprove ocean health. Consistent with a \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach, the project has benefited and will \nbenefit from cross-departmental coordination on knowledge sharing.19 The project will help \nreduce GHG emissions by facilitating recycling of post-consumer PET, which is less energy \nintensive than producing virgin PET. Other sustainability initiatives including energy efficiency and \nclean energy will also contribute to net reduction of GHG emissions.

IVG\u2019s rPET business will be integrated into its well-established PET \nsegment.  \nRevenue structure  The industry norm is to have long-term volume contracts with customers, with a pre-agreed \nprice adjustment mechanism. The price of rPET was linked to virgin PET in the past; however, \nthere has been a decoupling between the two prices recently because of increased and \ndedicated demand for rPET.  \nOperation and        At all production facilities, IVG conducts regular inspections, preventive maintenance, and \nreplacement of obsolete parts or equipment to avoid breakdown incidents, and minimize \nmaintenance \nunplanned or prolonged shutdowns. Since IVG has experience in operating rPET facilities, it \nhas inhouse capacity to undertake all O&M activities once the plants are complete.  \nPerformance  IVL and IVGS will submit quarterly unaudited financial statements or management accounts, \nand annual audited financial statements to ADB, and will report key performance indicators, \nmonitoring \nincluding output and outcome indicators from the design and monitoring framework. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, IVG = Indorama Ventures group, IVGS = Indorama Ventures Global Services Limited, \nIVL = Indorama Ventures Public Company Limited, O&M = operation and maintenance, PET = polyethylene \nterephthalate, rPET = recycled polyethylene terephthalate. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nH.

Value Added by ADB Assistance \n24.  Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, financial conditions have become tighter in Thailand \nand Thai companies are having more difficulty accessing long-term United States dollar financing. \nADB\u2019s  financing  package  provides  optimal  tenor  and  pricing  for  IVG  to  make  its  planned \ninvestment  in  recycling  facilities.  The  proposed  loans  will  finance  innovative,  high-impact \ntechnologies as well as process transformations that will improve recycling capacities and reduce \nGHG emissions. Additionally, ADB\u2019s financing will enable IVG to confirm the loan as a blue loan \nand a green loan, allowing it to showcase its commitment to ocean-friendly investments and to \nposition itself as the first mover for this new asset class in the regional loan market. This is a \nsignificant additionality since other financial institutions in Thailand do not have the relevant \nexpertise or experience to do so.  \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s involvement and due diligence will ensure that the project is developed and \noperated to international best practice standards and performs to expectations over the project \nlife.  ADB\u2019s  participation  in  the  project  will  also  ensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  rigorous \nenvironmental and social safeguard standards. \n \nC.
