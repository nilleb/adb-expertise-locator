THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Public Service Sector Public\u2013Private Partnership \n(PPP) Promotion and Elderly Care Demonstration Project. \n \n2.  The proposed project aims to support Xiangyang Municipality in Hubei Province of the \nPRC to strengthen coordinated elderly care service provision by helping establish an elderly care \nsystem,  strengthening  elderly  care  and  health  care  service  provision,  and  enhancing  the \ninvolvement of the private sector in elderly care. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  In 2019, the PRC had the world\u2019s largest population of elderly people aged 65 years and \nabove, totaling 176 million. The proportion of elderly people aged 65 years and above to the total \npopulation (the aging rate) was 7.0% in 2000 and 12.6% in 2019, and is expected to reach 14% \nin 2025 and 21% in 2035.1 The PRC faces the largest scale and a rapid pace of population aging. \nTraditional family support systems are increasingly unable to meet elderly care needs because of \nthe combined impacts of rapid urbanization, internal migration of young people, and the previous \none-child policy. \n \n4.  Following  national  trends,  Xiangyang  Municipality  is  facing  significant  aging  of  its \npopulation. Its total population decreased recently from 5.92 million in 2018 to 5.89 million in 2019, \nwhile the elderly population aged 65 years and above increased from 0.75 million to 0.88 million \nduring the same period.2 The aging rate already reached 15% in 2019 in Xiangyang Municipality. \nSuch  substantial  differences  in  the  growth  trend  between  the  total  population  and  elderly \npopulation indicate that the traditional family support system for elderly people is under significant \nstrain. The average number of family members in a household in Xiangyang Municipality was \n3.15 in 2015, smaller than that of Singapore (3.35 in 2016) and is approaching that of Japan (2.47 \nin 2016), the world\u2019s most aging society. It has become critically challenging for many families to \nprovide needed care for their elderly family members in Xiangyang. Further, the nature of elderly \ncare is changing. As people live longer, the expected lifetime living of people with a certain \ndisability would be extended. This is another driver that increases the demand for and duration of \ncare, and changes the nature of care. These aging conditions require continued and coordinated \ncare services, covering non-intensive levels of daily support to more intensive levels of care for \nspecific conditions and end-of-life issues. \n \n5.  The Xiangyang Municipal Government (XMG) has recognized the growing needs for care \nof its elderly people with population aging rising so rapidly. In line with the national and provincial \npolicies,3 the XMG has also prepared municipal policies to enhance its elderly care development. \nXiangyang Municipality\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 provides the policy direction to \ndevelop elderly care services covering institutional care, community-based day care, home-based \n \n1  United Nations Development Programme. 2016.

Hubei. \n ", "2 \ncare, as well as coordination of elderly care and health care services.4 In addition, to enhance the \nestablishment of such an elderly care system, the XMG developed the policy of Implementation \nOpinions on Accelerating Elderly Care Service Development in 2017.5 \n \n6.  However, traditional family support still plays a major role in the care of elderly people in \nXiangyang Municipality, which is a common feature of cities in the central region of the PRC. \nTraditionally, female family members are more likely than men to quit their jobs to assume unpaid \nfamily caregiving responsibilities, leaving female family caregivers with low incomes and further \nreducing opportunities for their career development. \n \n7.  Existing elderly care services in Xiangyang Municipality are of varying quality and unable \nto adequately respond to the needs of elderly people. Before 2015, there were neither public nor \nprivate  elderly  care  institutions  in  the  municipality.  Afterwards,  the  number  of  elderly  care \ninstitutions increased; however, by 2019, there were only a few elderly care institutions in half of \nthe districts in the municipality.6 There is also significant variation in the quality of facilities and \ncare services among those existing elderly care institutions because a standardized elderly care \nsystem has not yet been established in the municipality. The utilization rate of elderly care facilities \nis particularly low in facilities with designs that do not meet the expected elderly care functionality \nneeds, and in the facilities that employ caregivers who are not trained properly. The limited \nexperience of new service providers in elderly care has negatively affected matching of services \nand  facilities  with  the  care  needs  of  elderly  people.  Adequacy  of  elderly  care  services  is \ndetermined mainly by the (i) availability of a functional care needs assessment scheme, standards \nfor elderly care services, and a quality monitoring system; and (ii) availability of facilities meeting \nthe elderly care functionalities. The location of facilities and the financial framework for care \nservice provision also affect physical and economic accessibility to care services. The capacity of \ncaregivers and managers also critically affects the quality of care. Further, geriatric acute care is \nnecessary to meet the physical and mental needs of elderly patients. All of these are critical areas \nthat remain underdeveloped in Xiangyang Municipality. Adequate facilities and services are \ncritically limited to meet the increasing health and well-being needs of the aging society in \nXiangyang. \n \n8.  The XMG needs to develop a model of elderly care service provision that can be replicated \nin all districts in the municipality. Skilled human resources are also necessary to provide proper \nelderly care services fulfilling the level and type of care services required. It is important to improve \nworking conditions to provide better career development opportunities and retain skilled human \nresources. Improved working conditions would also help address key gender issues in elderly \ncare, since the majority of caregivers are women. Further, to respond to these increasing needs, \nthe private sector can play an important role in elderly care service provision. Although the XMG \ndeveloped  a  relevant  policy  on  the  private  sector\u2019s  involvement  in  2017  (footnote  5), the \nexperience and quality of private providers are still limited in Xiangyang Municipality. The XMG \nneeds to establish regulations and implementation guidelines to ensure the adequacy of services \nprovided by the private sector. The XMG has not identified a model for partnerships with the \nprivate sector to deliver proper elderly care services. \n \n9.  Since 2014, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported the development of elderly \ncare services in the PRC. It has been supporting local governments in the PRC in strengthening \n \n4  XMG. 2015.

Xiangyang. \n6  Since elderly care services are still under development in Xiangyang Municipality, the availability of other tiers of \ncare, including community-based day care and home-based care, is also limited. \n ", "3 \nthe quality and capacity of care services and the management capacity of care service provision.7 \nADB has also focused on the development of human resources and the enhancement of the \nprivate sector\u2019s involvement in the elderly care field.8 Further, ADB has supported national and \nlocal policy development for the establishment of an overall elderly care system in the PRC.9 \nADB\u2019s experiences suggest that a standardized system should be established at the local level \nbased on overall guidance provided by the central level to manage care service provision and \ncontrol quality, and to coordinate participants in areas of elderly care, including care service \nproviders, staff, elderly people, and local governments. Another key challenge is to establish a \nsustainable financial framework for elderly care services, which would require further research \nand policy analyses. \n \n10.  Lessons from ADB\u2019s experiences also suggest that it is important to strengthen local \ngovernments\u2019 understanding of the principles of elderly care; and to coordinate responsibilities of \nhealth care providers, the government, and the private sector. Particularly, ADB has introduced \nkey principles relating to elderly care and geriatric care, such as person-centered care and aging \nin place. In terms of practical service provision, ADB\u2019s previous interventions indicate that it is \nnecessary to (i) ensure proper facility designs that meet the elderly care functionality (targeted \ncare mix) of facilities, (ii) prepare and implement practical training on caregiving based on local \nconditions, and (iii) strengthen the operational knowledge and experiences of elderly care service \nmanagement. To prepare a PPP project for elderly care, it is important to confirm the public \nsector\u2019s responsibility for social services, including elderly care services, and a commitment to \nprovide the necessary financial support, as may be required, to make a PPP project viable. \nCareful assessment of the demand risks associated with the scale of a proposed PPP project, in-\ndepth legal and technical due diligence, and market sounding are key to structuring a viable PPP \nproject that complies with local requirements and is able to attract private sector participation. \n \n11.  The project is in line with strategic priority 3 (aging society and health security) of ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for the PRC, 2021\u20132025 with a focus on institutional strengthening \nof elderly care systems and coordination mechanisms of elderly care and health care services.10 \nIt is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, supporting addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequalities, accelerating progress in gender equality, tackling climate change, building \nclimate and disaster resilience and enhancing environment sustainability, and strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity; and further supporting in demonstrating a One ADB \napproach with the support of the Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership.11 Also, as in ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030, the project responds to issues of upper middle-income countries through strengthening \ninstitutions, developing a demonstration project, enhancing private sector involvement through \nPPP, and responding to an emerging social issue, i.e., population aging. \n \n12.

The international evidence associated \nwith coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreaks shows the high risk of mortality associated with \nCOVID-19 in care homes, with indications that the number of deaths in care homes accounts for \nabout 30%\u201350% of all COVID-19 deaths in various economies.12 The XMG recognizes the \nimportance of preparedness and response by elderly care and health care facilities to infectious \ndisease threats. \n \n13.  The project will help the XMG strengthen the preparedness and response capacity of \nelderly care and health care facilities to infectious disease threats, with a focus on facility design, \nfunctional planning, action plan, and staff training, which will help post-pandemic recovery. As the \nbase for preparedness, these facilities will comply with municipal regulations and guidelines on \npublic health security. Further, for elderly care facilities, the project will help (i) prepare infection \ncontrol measures as a part of the elderly care functional plan, (ii) prepare action plans based on \nthe infection control measures with task allocations among staff and managers of the elderly care \nfacilities, and (iii) provide training for staff and managers. In geriatric care-focused hospitals, the \nproject will help (i) prepare a proper hospital functional plan to ensure hospitals\u2019 resiliency to the \nspread of infection, including required design and space allocation; (ii) prepare internal policies \nand managerial structures for hospitals to effectively control hospital-acquired infections; (iii) \nprepare an action plan for safety practices; and (iv) develop staff skills based on the prepared \naction  plan.  The  project  will  demonstrate  a  practical  model  of  infection  preparedness  and \nresponse by elderly care facilities and hospitals, and it will further help the XMG disseminate the \nmodel to elderly facilities and hospitals in Xiangyang through training seminars and workshops. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n14.  The project is aligned with the following impact: welfare of the aging population in \nXiangyang improved (footnote 5). The project will have the following outcome: utilization of \ncoordinated elderly care services in Xiangyang Municipality increased.13 \n \n15.  Output 1: Institutional scheme and capacity for provision of elderly care services \ndeveloped.  Based  on  international  standards  and  domestic  good  practice,  the  output  will \n(i) establish an institutional scheme for proper elderly care service provision, including (a) care \nservice standards, (b) care needs and an eligibility assessment scheme,14 (c) staffing standards, \nand (d) an operational risk management scheme with safety and infection controls; (ii) help \nprepare proper designs of elderly care facilities based on age-friendly design, the concept of \nelderly people-centered care, and the functionality of elderly care facilities; (iii) build at least six \nelderly care facilities based on the proper designs with gender-sensitive facility use;15 (iv) help \ndevelop a sustainable operation plan; (v) train staff, such as caregivers and managers, of the \nelderly care facilities; and (vi) support the operation of elderly care facilities by piloting the above-\nmentioned institutional scheme, which will cover the three tiers of elderly care services, i.e., \ninstitutional care, community-based day care, and home-based care.16 This output will directly \nbenefit women by providing them with opportunities to improve their skills and enhance their \ncareer development in elderly care fields. The availability of improved care services will also \n \n12 A. Comas-Herrera et al.

Output 2: Public\u2013private partnership subproject for elderly care service provision \ndeveloped. To enhance the private sector\u2019s involvement in elderly care service provision in \nXiangyang, this output will (i) help build and operate at least one elderly care facility, and (ii) plan \nto structure the subproject\u2019s implementation under a PPP framework to harness the private \nsector\u2019s technical innovation, operational efficiency, and management experiences. The PPP \nframework  will  define  certain  implementation  arrangements  for  the  design,  construction, \nmaintenance, and operation of the elderly care facilities. The availability payment or viability gap \nfunding models are contemplated for the PPP framework, where the public sector will cover the \nfinancial gap that the private sector cannot recover through user fees.17 It will also define a risk \nallocation between the public and private sectors that is bankable and sustainable to attract \nprivate sector participation. \n \n17.  Output  3:  Capacity  in  provision  of  geriatric  acute  care  and  rehabilitation \nstrengthened. The output will help (i) prepare (a) a functional plan for two hospitals focusing on \ngeriatric acute care and rehabilitation to respond to the needs of elderly patients; (b) a plan of \nstaffing and human resource development for the two hospitals, including staff training programs, \nfocusing on geriatric acute care and rehabilitation for doctors, nurses, and therapists; and (c) a \ncoordination scheme between two hospitals and elderly care facilities; (ii) construct two hospitals \nwith strengthened geriatric acute care and rehabilitation sections based on the above-prepared \nfunctional plan; and (iii) help operationalize the two hospitals by piloting the above-prepared \ncoordination scheme. \n \n18.  Output 4: Support services and capacity for elderly care services strengthened. The \noutput will help strengthen the capacity of human resources through (i) preparing a training \nprogram in caregiving and elderly care service operation, and a course on elderly care business; \nand (ii) building a training facility in the Technology Institute of Hubei University of Arts and \nScience in Xiangyang Municipality.18 The training program will target existing caregivers and \noperators to improve their knowledge and skills in care for activities of daily living, dementia care, \nbasic rehabilitation, and elderly care service operation. It will also target staff who will work for the \nelderly care facilities created under the project. Further, the training program will also be opened \nto family caregivers and volunteers who are interested in elderly care and the issue of population \naging. The elderly care business course will be a formal educational course targeting new \nstudents and entrepreneurs. The output will further develop an elderly care information and \ncommunication technology platform to promote the efficient management of care administration \nand support the exchange of information among elderly people and care service providers. It will \nprovide a business support system for elderly care service provision, including a service delivery \nmanagement system and care service planning support. \n \n19.

Value Added by ADB \n \n20.  Building on ADB's significant accumulated knowledge and experiences in the elderly care \nfield, the project will provide comprehensive support, with an emphasis on nonstructural measures \nbeyond physical investments, to help the XMG strengthen elderly care service provision. This \nincludes support for establishing the municipality\u2019s elderly care system, developing a coordination \nscheme between elderly care and health care, improving elderly care facilities to meet targeted \nelderly care functionalities, and strengthening health care service responsiveness to the needs of \nelderly people. Since a standardized elderly care system is under development in Xiangyang \nMunicipality, such comprehensive support is key to realizing proper and manageable care service \nprovision for elderly people who need care services. The project will help develop the coordination \nbetween elderly care and health care, and between different tiers of elderly care services, i.e., \ninstitutional care, community-based day care, and home-based care. Such coordinated care \nservices  will  respond  to  the  needs  of  elderly  people  and  their  families  across  the  home, \ncommunity,  and  institutional  settings.  The  project  will  also  enhance  the  private  sector\u2019s \ninvolvement through PPP. Further, the project will help strengthen the resiliency of elderly care \nand health care facilities to infectious disease threats in Xiangyang Municipality. Knowledge and \nlessons from the project will be disseminated in the PRC and more widely in the region through \nADB\u2212PRC Regional Knowledge Sharing Initiative, as well as training and workshops. \n \nD.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n27.  The project was reviewed to ensure it is technically feasible following careful examination \nof the project\u2019s compatibility with local conditions and capacity for operation and maintenance. \nDesign options have been compared and the optimal least-cost alternatives selected. The \nfacilities will be designed in accordance with the relevant PRC standards and regulations. The \narchitectural design will need to incorporate international and national good practices on elderly \ncare  and  health  care  facilities,  and  follow  age-friendly,  elderly  care-focused,  efficient,  and \n ", "9 \ninclusive  principles.  Low-carbon  and  resource-efficient  measures,  including  solar  hot  water \nsystems, intelligent lighting control, and passive energy-saving designs, will be adopted. The \nfacility design should meet the expected functionalities and suitable operation of respective elderly \ncare and health care facilities. To ensure the proper facility design, the building design plan and \nthe preliminary design will be reviewed by an elderly care\u2013health care facility architect, and \ncleared by ADB. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n28.  Economic.  The  project  aims  to  develop  elderly  care  and  health care  facilities and \nstrengthen the capacity of such services in Xiangyang Municipality. The expected outcome of this \nproject is an increased utilization of coordinated elderly care services in Xiangyang Municipality. \nThe cost-effectiveness analysis approach was used for economic analysis, in accordance with \nADB guidelines.22 This approach compared ADB\u2019s proposed project design against an alternative \ndesign to assess whether ADB\u2019s proposed design minimizes the resources used to achieve the \ndesired outcomes. The results of the cost-effectiveness analysis show that ADB\u2019s proposed \nproject design is more cost-effective, with a lower cost-effectiveness ratio of CNY368 per person \ncompared to the CNY402 per person under the alternative design. \n \n29.  Financial.  The  financial  analysis  was  conducted  to  determine  the  viability  and \nsustainability of the proposed hospitals. It examined the possible revenues to be generated by \ntwo hospitals created under the project. It assessed their projected incremental financials over a \nlife cycle period in real terms. The financial internal rate of return is 5.18% for the first hospital \nand 2.83% for the second, higher than the weighted average cost of capital of 0.06% for the first \nhospital and 0.07% for the second. These demonstrate their financial viability.23 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n30.  The financial and fiscal sustainability of the elderly care facilities was examined to ensure \nthat all financial requirements such as counterpart funds, operation and maintenance costs, and \nloan repayments will be covered during implementation and operation of the facilities. The \nimplementing agency was assessed to be financially sustainable and has the financial capacity \nto cover all required financing. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n31.  Financial  management  assessment.  The  financial  management  assessment  was \nconducted in accordance with ADB guidelines.24 It considered the financial management capacity \nof the XMG, through the XPMO, as the executing agency, and Hanjiang State-Owned Capital \nInvestment Group Co., Ltd. as the implementing agency. The assessed pre-mitigation financial \nmanagement risk was moderate mainly because the project is the first ADB project for the \nexecuting and implementing agencies, although both have already done advance action of \nundergoing  training  on  ADB  loan  disbursement  procedures.  The  mitigation  measures  are \nexpected to further improve their familiarity with ADB procedures and strengthen their financial \nmanagement capacity to efficiently and effectively manage project implementation. \n \n \n22 ADB. 2017.

Value for money will be achieved through contract packaging, selection of \nprocurement method and bidding procedure, and proposed advance procurement arrangement; \nthese were the result of a strategic procurement planning exercise that considered the strategic \nproject priorities, risks and opportunities, operating conditions of the executing and implementing \nagencies,  and  market  conditions.  The  procurement  risk  assessment  was  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB guidelines.25 It confirmed that the XPMO and the implementing agency, \nacting through a procurement agency and with the assistance of ADB and project implementation \nsupport  consultants,  will  have  adequate  capacity  to  facilitate  compliance  with  the  ADB \nProcurement Policy and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers. The project pre-mitigated \nprocurement risk was high, mainly because the XPMO and the implementing agency have limited \nexperience in PPP projects. The XPMO has experience with international financial institutions' \nprojects. Since the XPMO and the implementing agency lack ADB project experience, their staff \nwill need to be familiarized with ADB policies and procedures. Mitigation measures for those risks \nare summarized in the risk assessment and risk management plan.26 \n \n33.  Integrity due diligence was conducted.27 No significant integrity risks were identified. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment and the XPMO. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 20). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  A poverty and social analysis was conducted, and a social and gender action plan was \nprepared. The poverty and social analysis and social and gender action plan helped in designing \nthe project to ensure that it is socially inclusive and implemented with community participation. \nThe project will potentially benefit 0.4 million elderly residents of urban districts of Xiangyang. \nWomen and men beneficiaries support the project, as they perceive that the project will bring \nsignificant benefits for them through improved elderly care services, as well as strengthened \ngeriatric acute care and rehabilitation. \n \n35.  The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. Given the persistence of gender \ninequality in the workforce, female family caregivers are more likely than men to cut back on work \nhours  or  quit  their  jobs  because  of  their  family  caregiving  responsibilities.  Female  family \ncaregivers are more likely to lose opportunities for their career development and be left with low \nincomes and small savings. Further, the majority of formal caregivers are also women, which \nwould have an adverse impact on their socioeconomic and physical conditions, because of the \npoor working conditions of caregivers. Women will directly benefit from the project through the \nfollowing project measures: (i) better coordinated elderly care services will alleviate the burden of \nthe young, especially young women, from informal family care responsibilities and enable them \nto concentrate on improving their professional skills and finding jobs; (ii) improved working \nconditions of caregivers by providing opportunities for women in elderly care-related skills training \nand career development programs; (iii) fair and equitable participation of and consultation with \nwomen during project design and implementation; (iv) gender-sensitive facility use (footnote 15); \nand (v) assistance to women by providing employment opportunities and skills training during \nproject construction and operation. \n \n \n25 ADB. 2015.

In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.28 \n \n37.  Environment (category B). The project entails construction of elderly care facilities, \nhospitals, and a training facility. An initial environmental examination, including an environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP), was prepared and disclosed on the ADB website on 9 July 2020. The \nimpacts during construction and operation (noise, air quality, wastewater, solid wastes, risk to \ncommunity, and occupational health and safety) will be insignificant and localized, and will be \neffectively  mitigated  through  the  implementation  of  the  EMP.  The  XMG  has  confirmed  its \ncommitment and capacity to implement the EMP, and it will be responsible for implementation of \nand  compliance  with  the  EMP  through  the  XPMO.  Capacity  building  measures,  reporting \ntimelines,  and  roles  and  responsibilities  of  relevant  agencies  are  prescribed  in  the  EMP. \nEnvironmental complaints will be managed through the project grievance redress mechanism. \nPublic consultations, through questionnaire surveys, were conducted during project preparation.29 \nA public consultation plan was developed in the EMP to instruct the XPMO to organize meaningful \nconsultations. \n \n38.  Climate change. A climate risk and vulnerability assessment concluded that the project\u2019s \noverall climate change risk level is medium. Under the supervision of the XPMO, the implementing \nagency will ensure that the facilities\u2019 detailed designs incorporate the adjustments to engineering \ndesigns derived from climate change assessment results in proactive disaster risk reduction and \nclimate adaptation and mitigation measures. Flood-resilient designs and evacuation measures \nare the principal approaches to mitigate risks associated with natural hazards and extreme \nweather events, such as flooding and intense precipitation. Conserving as many existing buildings \nas possible instead of building new ones, renewable energy, and energy and water saving are \nthree main methods to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. \n \n39.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The project requires 140.63 mu of land, of which \n88.35 mu are rural collective lands to be acquired and 52.28 mu are state-owned lands acquired \nin 2013 for another project.30 The proposed acquisition of rural collective lands will affect 71 \nhouseholds with 356 persons in four villages. The project will require demolition of six houses \ncovering an area of 2,170 square meters of land, affecting six households with 49 persons in \nHengzhuang community. A resettlement plan has been prepared to address land acquisition and \nhouse demolition impacts because of the project. Income losses of households arising from \ncollective land acquisition have been assessed as not significant, with less than 1% of household \nincomes being impacted. Due diligence carried out for lands already acquired, which was not in \nanticipation of ADB financing the project, confirmed that there are no past or present concerns, \noutstanding  grievances,  or  complaints  related  to  involuntary  resettlement  impacts.  Key \ninformation in the resettlement plan and due diligence report has been disclosed to the project-\naffected persons. During project implementation, the XPMO and the implementing agency staff \nwill be trained in ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement requirements. A grievance redress mechanism \nwill be established prior to finalization of detailed designs and initiation of resettlement activities, \nand an external monitor will be engaged for semiannual resettlement monitoring. \n \n \n28 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n29 The XPMO will hold public meetings prior to construction to discuss the EMP, project activities, and issues associated \nwith the safety of nearby communities in the vicinity of the construction sites. The measures to address the public \nconcerns will be incorporated into the updated EMP and final design, if necessary. \n30 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n ", "12 \n40.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Ethnic minorities account only for 0.55% of the \nXiangyang\u2019s total population and include the Hui, Manchu, Miao, Mongolian, and Tujia ethnic \nminorities, which are well interrelated with the Han majority. The economic status of ethnic \nminorities is similar to that of the Han majority. Those ethnic minorities will benefit, as others will \ndo, from the project. Therefore, an ethnic minority development plan has not been prepared. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n41.  The overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks involved. \nThe overall risk is rated moderate.
