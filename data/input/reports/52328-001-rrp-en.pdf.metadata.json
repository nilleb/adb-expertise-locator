The  roads  will  improve  connectivity  between  habitations,  productive \nagricultural lands, and economic growth centers across the state. This will enhance employment \nopportunities and help reduce poverty, especially in rural areas where about 55% of the state\u2019s \npopulation  lives.  The  project  will  enhance  agricultural  productivity,  add  value  to  agricultural \nproduce and will contribute to increasing the average growth rate of agriculture and allied activities \nto more than 5% per year by 2030\u2014a target of the state\u2019s long-term strategic development plan, \nVision 2030.1 \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nMaharashtra economy. Maharashtra is India\u2019s leading state in terms of its contribution \n3. \nto  the  national  economy.  In  FY2017  the  state  accounted  for  14.8%  of  India\u2019s  national  gross \ndomestic  product.2  Driven  by  robust growth  in financial  and  other  services  and manufacturing, \nMaharashtra\u2019s economy has been growing steadily. The state\u2019s gross domestic product averaged \n7.4%  growth  per  year  from  2012  to  2017.  However,  economic  development  is  concentrated \naround the urban centers of Mumbai, Pune and Thane. Mumbai alone accounts for 20% of the \ngross district value added,3 while 4 of the state\u2019s 34 districts generate 52% of the gross district \nvalue added. Similarly, the state\u2019s human development index shows imbalances across districts, \nwith 27 of the 34 districts recording below-average values. Consequently, income inequality in \nMaharashtra is one of the highest among all states in India. Despite the state\u2019s impressive and \nsustained economic growth, about 20 million people, or 17% of the state\u2019s population, still live \nbelow the national poverty line.4 Poverty is pronounced in rural areas, where on average about \n24% of the population lives below the poverty line (in some districts the figure is as high as 40%).  \n\n4. \nAgriculture  in  Maharashtra  is  in  distress.  Agriculture  accounts  for  about  47%  of \nemployment,  engages  as much  as  79%  of the rural  labor force,  and  contributes  about  11%  of \nMaharashtra\u2019s gross  state  domestic  product.  However,  agriculture\u2019s  contribution  to gross  state \ndomestic product is in decline, and recorded negative annual growth during four of the past seven \nyears.5  Crop  losses  are a  persistent  problem,  caused  mainly  by  climate variability,  and  limited \n\n                                                \n1   State Government of Maharashtra, Planning Department. 2018.

Continuous crop losses \nresult  in  high  farmer  indebtedness  and  higher  suicide  rates.7  Women  are  particularly \ndisempowered in at least two main areas: access to resources, and representation and leadership \nin groups.8 Improving rural road infrastructure can help overcome  these setbacks and address \nthe causes of persistent poverty and inequality among remote rural communities.  \n\n5. \nOverview  of  the  road  subsector.  Maharashtra  has  an  extensive  network  of  roads \nconsisting of national and state highways and other district roads and village roads. More than \n80% of passengers and 60% of freight traffic use roads as the dominant mode of transportation. \nRural roads, which comprise \u201cother district roads\u201d and \u201cvillage roads,\u201d make up 67% of the state\u2019s \nroad network. About 55% of these rural roads are unsealed making them unsuitable for motorized \ntraffic  and  impassable  during  the  rainy  season.9  Many  rural  community  members,  including \nwomen, children, and seniors, rely on these roads to access health care and educational facilities. \nRoad safety is also a growing concern; in 2017, Maharashtra accounted for 8.3%  of all fatal road \naccidents  in  India.10  Upgrading  rural  road  networks  to  all-weather  condition  will  contribute \nsignificantly towards improving road safety and access to markets and basic services, especially \nfor rural people in the state.  \n\n6. \nGovernment programs for the road subsector. The Government of India recognizes \nthe importance of rural connectivity in improving rural livelihoods and alleviating poverty. In 2000, \nthe Government of India launched the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), a national \nplan to improve connectivity by constructing all-weather roads to eligible unconnected habitations \nin rural areas.11 Under the PMGSY, the Maharashtra state government as of 2018 had completed \nupgrading  about  25,600  kilometers  (km)  of  roads,  connecting  8,315  habitations.  Following  the \nPMGSY model, the state government in 2016 launched the Mukhya Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana \n(MMGSY) program to connect villages by improving roads in remote rural areas that had not been \nreached by the PMGSY.12 The MMGSY aims to cover 30,000 km of rural roads over 5 years. By \nJanuary 2019, the state had completed upgrading about 7,000 km of roads under the MMGSY. \n\ninclusive  socioeconomic  development,  with  a \n\nThe state government\u2019s Vision 2030 presents a five-pillar strategy to achieve sustainable, \n7. \nbalanced,  and \nfocus  on  (i)  agriculture, \n(ii) infrastructure, (iii) industry, (iv) the social sector, and (v) governance. In agriculture, the state \naims to increase the average annual growth rate to more than 5% by 2030. To reach this target, \nthe  state  will  take  measures  to  improve  the  productivity  of  horticulture  and  floriculture,  and \npromote commercialization, and value addition to agricultural products. In terms of infrastructure, \nVision 2030 envisions building quality, reliable, sustainable, safe, and affordable roads that are \naccessible  to  all.  The  infrastructure  plan  includes  provisions  to  improve  national  and  state \nhighways and rural road networks to establish major economic corridors.

ADB  supports  rural  road  development  programs  in \nseveral South Asia countries including Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. The project will \nbuild  on  the  success  of  these  rural  road  programs, which  have  highlighted  the  importance \nof (i) designing  rural  roads  to  all-weather  standards  with  climate-resilient  and  safety  features; \n(ii) improving road maintenance; and (iii) strengthening institutional capacity. ADB will add value \nby promoting climate-resilient designs (e.g. road elevations and cross and side drainage; road \nbases and pavements; earthworks and compaction). These measures will significantly reduce the \nensuing burden of maintaining roads. In addition, civil works contracts will include a provision to \ncarry out post-completion maintenance for 5 years. This measure aims to assess the efficacy of \nthe private sector in undertaking long-term maintenance of roads. The possible benefits include \nthe assurance of better life-cycle quality, greater operational efficiency, and cost effectiveness of \nroad maintenance.13 \n\n9. \nAlignment with the government and Asian Development Bank priorities. The project \nis  aligned  with  (i)  the  state  government\u2019s  Vision  2030;  (ii)  the  country  partnership  strategy  for \nIndia,  2018\u20132022  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\u2014specifically  pillar  2  on  inclusive \nprovision  of  infrastructure  network  and  services;  and  (iii)  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030, specifically  the \nstrategy\u2019s operational priorities on (a) promoting rural development and food security; (b) tackling \nclimate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental \nsustainability;  and  (c)  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity.14  The  project  is \nincluded in the country operations business plan for India, 2019\u20132021.15 \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: Quality, reliable, sustainable, safe, and \naffordable roads that provide equitable access for all developed (footnote 1). The project will have \nthe following outcome: Road transport efficiency in 34 districts in Maharashtra increased.16 \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nOutput 1: Conditions and safety of selected rural roads improved and maintained. \n11. \nThe project team will improve the condition of about 2,100 km of rural roads\u2014connecting rural \ncommunities  with  productive  agricultural  areas  and  socioeconomic  centers\u2014to  all-weather \nstandards, with climate resilience and safety features.17 The project team will incorporate climate \nresilience  measures such  as  improved  cross  and  side  drainage,  increased  surface  elevations, \nand stronger embankments in the designs. Environmentally friendly alternative sealing options \nsuch as asphalt blended with plastic waste will be piloted on selected road segments. The roads \nwill also be covered under contractual maintenance for 5 years following construction.18  \n\n                                                \n13\n\n  It  is  estimated  that  for  every  $1.00  spent  on  preventive  maintenance,  up  to  $3.00  can  be  saved  on  future \nreconstruction.

Safety measures include cautionary \n\nand information signs, guard posts, and speed breakers. \n\n18 The same contractors that build the roads will perform routine maintenance for 5 years. The government will finance \n\nall maintenance costs.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f12. \nOutput 2: Capacity of rural infrastructure agency and awareness among road users \nin the state enhanced. Capacity development of rural infrastructure agency will involve training \nthe  Maharashtra  Rural  Road  Development  Association  (MRRDA)  on  road  safety,  road  asset \nmanagement,  contract  management,  and  climate  resilient  design  and  construction.  Capacity \ndevelopment of road users in the state will include (i) improving road users\u2019 awareness on road \nsafety  and  gender-based  violence  (including  sexual  exploitation,  human  trafficking,  and \nprevention  of  sexually  transmitted  infections);  and  (ii)  enhancing  women  workers\u2019  road \nconstruction and maintenance skills. Under this output, the project team will develop manuals for \nconstruction and maintenance of rural roads with climate-resilient and gender-inclusive designs. \n\nD. \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $296.00  million  (Table  1).

It was established on 8 May 2003 through a government resolution, under the Society \nRegistration Act, 1860. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n19. \nProject  readiness  and  implementation  plan.  MRRDA  finalized  the  master  bid \ndocuments and obtained ADB\u2019s no-objection approval under the prior review procedures for five \nworks packages. MRRDA issued the invitation to bid for all civil works contracts and request for \nexpressions of interest for the project implementation support consultants as part of the advance \nactions. The detailed project readiness activities and overall project implementation plan  are in \nthe PAM. \n\nIII. \n\nATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n20. \nADB will provide transaction TA for Institutional Strengthening of the Maharashtra Rural \nRoad  Sector  for  Sustainable  Development.23  The  TA  will  support  MRRDA  to  improve \nmanagement performance by implementing institutional development initiatives with international \nexpertise.  The  TA  will  focus  on  (i)  road  asset  management,  including  performance-based \nmaintenance; (ii) road safety; (iii) climate-resilient design and construction; and (iv) web-based \nreal-time project monitoring. ADB will recruit an international consulting firm in accordance with \nthe ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) to carry out the TA activities. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $1 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance  Fund  (TASF-Other  sources).  The  government  will  provide  support  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  office  supplies,  secretarial  assistance,  domestic \ntransportation, and other in-kind contributions. \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n21.  MRRDA  prepared  the  detailed  design  for  upgrading  about  2,100  km  of  single-carriage \nroads, which were in various conditions. The designs complied with the government\u2019s standards \nand specifications for improved design and construction of rural roads. MMRDA incorporated road \nsafety measures (such as carrying out road safety audits and precautionary interventions along \nhigh-risk road segments) and climate-resilient rural road construction measures (such as slope \nstabilization,  drainage,  and  cross-drainage  measures)  in  the  designs.  MRRDA  also  adopted  a \ncontext-sensitive  design  approach  to  incorporate  community  concerns.  Construction  will  use \nproven technology (such as polymer-modified asphalt and asphalt blended with plastic waste as \nsealing options) and materials compatible with local conditions.  \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n22. \nEconomic  viability.  ADB  carried  out  the  economic  analysis  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.24  The  principal  benefits  considered  in  the \nanalysis are transport cost savings in terms of vehicle operating costs, travel time savings of the \nexisting and incremental traffic on these roads over the analysis period, and lower greenhouse \ngas  emissions.  Other  unquantified  benefits  include  improved  road  safety,  higher  climate \nresilience,  and  improved  quality  of  life  for  rural  communities.  The  economic  analysis  indicated \nthat the project is economically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of 14.2%. Road \npackages  in  all  districts have  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  above the  acceptable  rate  of \nreturn of 9%. Sensitivity analysis indicated that, with a 10% increase in capital costs or a 10% \ndecrease in benefits, the overall investment remains economically viable. The analysis assumes \nthat  50%  of  vehicle  operating  cost  savings  will  be  accrued  to  vehicle  owners  and  50%  will  be \n                                                \n23 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n \n\n\fpassed on to the road users by the operators in the case of public transport and freight vehicles.  \nThe project directly generates benefits that accrue to the poor and vulnerable population, with the \npoverty impact ratio estimated at 41.1%.25 \n\n23. \nFinancial sustainability. The project will not generate revenue. Instead, MRRDA will be \nresponsible for maintaining the roads improved under the project for the first 10 years, after which \nthe roads and their maintenance will be handed over to local governments. The state government \nwill finance road maintenance in accordance with the PMGSY guidelines. However, past practice \nsuggests that it is unlikely that sufficient funds will be provided to fully cover maintenance costs. \nMRRDA is developing a maintenance policy to improve the sustainability of the constructed and \nupgraded rural roads by ensuring that adequate resources are committed for routine and periodic \nmaintenance.26 To further mitigate the risk of insufficient road maintenance, MRRDA will integrate \nthe following measures in the project: (i) include provision in the road construction contracts for \nthe contractor to carry out routine maintenance of the road for the first 5 years after completion of \nthe works; (ii) prepare manuals for performance-based maintenance; (iii) project implementation \nsupport consultants will prepare training programs for MRRDA and local governments to improve \ntheir capacity to maintain roads, accurately estimate the resources required, and prepare annual \nbudgets that prioritize maintenance over construction; and (iv) under the attached TA, consultants \nwill provide capacity building to MRRDA to improve its road asset management system.  \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nFinancial  management.  ADB  conducted  a  financial  management  assessment  of \nMRRDA,  covering  fund-flow  arrangements,  governance,  staffing,  budgeting,  accounting  and \nfinancial  reporting  systems,  internal  control  procedures,  financial  information  systems,  and \ninternal  and  external  auditing  arrangements.  The  assessment  determined  that  the  financial \nmanagement  risk  was  moderate,  mainly  because  MRRDA  was  inexperienced  with  ADB \nprocedures.  The  assessment  found  that  (i) MRRDA  has  the  minimum  required  policies  and \nprocedures  in  place,  and  that  (ii)  the  statutory  audit  function  of  MRRDA  is  carried  out  by  an \nindependent auditor (appointed in accordance with PMGSY guidelines) and complies with audit \nstandards issued by the comptroller and auditor general of India. However, the assessment also \nidentified the following risks: (i) limited financial staff in the PMU, (ii) MRRDA\u2019s lack of experience \nin ADB procedures, (iii) irregular interim financial reporting within MRRDA, and (iv) decentralized \nflow of funds from the MRRDA head office to the regions. These risks will be mitigated by (i) hiring \nan additional financial management specialist for the project to be placed within MRRDA head \noffice, (ii) providing training to MRRDA in ADB\u2019s procedures, (iii) ensuring that MRRDA submits \nquarterly financial reports and internal audits; and (iv) ensuring that MRRDA maintains centralized \nstorage of its financial records and backs them up of regularly. Moreover, MRRDA will maintain \nseparate books of accounts for the project and will employ an auditor acceptable to ADB, who will \nfollow  auditing  standards  acceptable  to  ADB  and  will  audit  the  project  financial  statements \nannually.  \n\n25. \nProcurement and anticorruption. Procurement of works will be in accordance with the \nADB Procurement Policy (2017 as amended from time to time) and the Procurement Regulations \nfor ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The assessment of the procurement \ncapacity  of  MRRDA  concluded  that  it  has  the  capacity  to  undertake  procurement  under  the \nproject. The government will follow open competitive bidding (national advertisement) procedures \nand  will  use  the  standard  bidding  document  that  was  used  for  the  India  Rural  Connectivity \n\n                                                \n25 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Government of Maharashtra, Rural Development Department. 2018.

Specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n\nD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Impact \n\nThe  project  preparatory  phase  involved  widespread  consultations  with  about  29,000 \n26. \npeople  living  in  the  state  MRRDA  carried  out  transect  walks  with  community  members\u23afboth \nwomen and men\u23afalong all roads. The community members were overwhelmingly supportive of \nthe project and expressed a desire to improve mobility between commercial centers to increase \neconomic  and  employment  opportunities.  Local  communities  expressed  their  belief  that  the \nprovision of all-weather roads in rural areas would contribute to reducing poverty. It is expected \nthat the project will generate about 2 million person-days of employment for local communities (of \nwhich 25% will be for women) over the construction and maintenance periods. The project roads \nwill improve farmers\u2019 access to markets, which in turn will contribute towards improved agricultural \nproductivity  and  will  increase  farmers\u2019  incomes.  Roads  will  also  promote  investment  in \nagribusiness and agriculture value chain infrastructure. \n\n2. \n\nGender and Development  \n\n27. \nGender mainstreaming. The  project  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming. The \nproject\u2019s gender analysis highlighted the need to promote gender equality in the community and \nwithin  MRRDA.    ADB  prepared  a  gender  action  plan  (GAP),  which  delineates  activities  with \nindicators and targets, responsible agencies, and time frames for implementing and monitoring \nand  reporting  on  GAP  activities.29  The  GAP  (i)  guarantees  training  and  employment  for  local \nwomen  in  construction  and  maintenance;  (ii)  provides  women  and  children  with  increased \nawareness  of  road  safety  and  gender-based  violence  (including  sexual  exploitation,  human \ntrafficking, and prevention of sexually transmitted infections); (iii) provides eligible female MRRDA \nstaff  with  increased  awareness  and/or  skills  related  to  road  safety,  road  asset  management, \nfinancial  management,  and  climate-resilient  design  and  construction;  and  (iv) ensures  that  all \nproject outputs incorporate gender-inclusive features.  \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n28. \ncategories are as follows.30 \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n                                                \n27 ADB. 2012.

ADB screened and assessed the impacts from all the project \nroads  using  an  environmental  checklist  developed  for  similar  projects  and  adapted  to  local \nconditions.31 ADB prepared an initial environmental examination report from these checklists, in \nline  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  project  involves  upgrading  existing \nroads,  with  minimal  or  no  land  acquisition.  Most  of  the  negative  impacts  are  related  to \nconstruction; they are site-specific, limited within the construction corridor, and easily mitigated. \nAnticipated  environmental  impacts  are  typical  of  road  maintenance  projects  and  include \ngeneration  of  dust,  noise,  exhaust  (from  haul  trucks  and  hot  mix  plants),  and  waste  (from \nconstruction  and  worker  camps);  water  contamination;  and  occupational  health  and  safety \nhazards. The MRRDA has integrated mitigation measures for all anticipated impacts through the \nincorporation  of  a  standard  environmental  management  plan  in  the  bidding  documents  and \nprovision  of  road-specific  environmental  management  plans  with  the  detailed  project  reports. \nMRRDA  has  formed  an  integrated  social  and  environmental  grievance  redress  mechanism  to \nreceive  feedback  and  complaints  from  affected  parties  and  address  these  complaints  during \nconstruction and operation. To ensure the effective implementation of safeguard requirements, \nenvironmental experts will augment MRRDA in the regions. The initial environmental examination \nreport is disclosed on the ADB and MRRDA websites. \n\n30.  With  rainfall  projected  to  increase  because  of  climate  change  in  the  near  term,  more \nfrequent  and  intense  flooding,  particularly  on  rural  roads  near  river  courses,  is  anticipated.32 \nMRRDA has adopted climate-resilient road designs to address this risk and, in consultation with \nlocal  communities,  has  identified  vulnerable  sections  of  rural  roads  to  be  upgraded  under  the \nproject. Adaptation measures will include increasing cross-drainage capacities, constructing new \ncross-drains,  increasing  final  road  surface  elevations,  strengthening  road  embankments  with \nretaining  walls,  and  constructing  new  side  drains  to  protect  pavement  against  prolonged \nsubmergence. The cost of these adaptation measures is estimated at $22.12 million and will be \nincorporated in the civil works. The project contributes to climate change mitigation by improving \nthe road surfaces thereby enabling vehicles to travel at optimum speed which reduces carbon \nemissions. The corresponding cost of mitigation measures is estimated at $11.11 million.  \n\n31. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C).  ADB  screened  100%  of  the  project  for \ninvoluntary  resettlement  impacts  during  project  preparation.  The  project  will  not  require \ninvoluntary land acquisition, or cause physical or economic displacement of people. Details of the \nsocial safeguard screening along all roads are documented in the social safeguards due diligence \nreports.33 The project has adequate funding and institutional capacity, and arrangements are in \nplace for involuntary resettlement screening throughout the project life cycle. \n\nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  ADB  screened  100%  of  the  project  for  impacts  on \n32. \nindigenous peoples during project preparation. The screening confirms that indigenous peoples \n(scheduled  tribes)  are  present  within  the  state  as  individual  households  living  among  broader \ncommunities rather than distinct communities. The project will not directly or indirectly affect the \ndignity, human rights, livelihood systems, or culture of indigenous peoples because the project \nworks will not impact territories or natural or cultural resources that indigenous peoples own, use, \noccupy, or claim as an ancestral domain or asset.

The method is described in \nthis  project\u2019s  social  safeguards  due  diligence  guideline  (SDDG).  The  SDDG  is  also  commonly  referred  to  as  a \n\u201ccommunity  participation  framework\u201d  and  the  SDDR  as  a  \u201ccommunity  participation  plan.\u201d  In  this  report,  the  titles \nSDDR and SDDG are used to align with standard language adopted in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nF. \n\nall  799  roads  are  documented  in  the  social  safeguards  due  diligence  reports.
