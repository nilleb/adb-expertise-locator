Two \nloans  are  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  ordinary \ncapital  resources  (OCR):  (i)  a  program  loan  of  $45  million  to \n(ii)  a \nsupport \nModernization  of  the  Revenue  Administration  (MRA)  project  loan \nof  $15  million  mainly \nthe  Revenue \nAdministration  Management  Information  System  (RAMIS).  The \nthird  loan  of  SDR  6,672,000  ($10  million  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources  is  a  project  loan  for  Institutional \nStrengthening of Fiscal Management Institutions through capacity \nbuilding, including implementation of the FMRP. \n \nTargeting Classification: General intervention \nSector: Law, economic management, and public policy  \nSubsector: Public finance and expenditure management \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth; Governance \nSubthemes: Promoting macroeconomic stability; Financial and \neconomic governance \n \nCategory C \n\nimpaired \n\n \nThe  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  (the  Government)  is  facing \nincreasing  fiscal  stress  from  mounting  and  unsustainable  fiscal \ndeficits  and  a  concomitant  large  public  debt.  Without  meaningful \nfiscal  consolidation,  unsustainable  current  expenditure \nin \ncombination  with  an \nrevenue  administration  will \nincreasingly  erode  physical  and  social  capital  expenditures  and \ncrowd out private investment, preventing Sri Lanka from reaching \na  higher  and  sustainable  path  of  economic  growth.  Under  the \ncircumstances, addressing the country\u2019s weak public finances will \nbe  critical  in  order  for  the  country  to  successfully  fulfill  its \ndevelopment  objectives,  including  its  evolving  poverty  reduction \nstrategy. \n \nThe  Government  has  responded  to  the  serious  fiscal  challenges \nby \nrevenue \naugmentation\u2014at  the  forefront  of  its  economic  policy  reform \nagenda.  A  three-pillar  strategy  has  been  adopted  to  strengthen \npublic  finances.  This  includes  a  revamped  fiscal  framework \nestablished under the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, an \nthe  overhaul  and \nenabling  policy  environment  based  on \nstreamlining  of \ninstitutional \nstrengthening  of  the  revenue  administration  supported  by  the \ncreation     of    a     modernized    revenue    administration .   The \n \n\ntaxation  policy,  as  well  as \n\nreform\u2014and \n\nparticular \n\nplacing \n\nfiscal \n\nin \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \nEstimated FMRP \nCompletion Date \n \nProgram Loan  \n  Objectives \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nFMRP supports the Government\u2019s strategy of fiscal consolidation \ncompatible with medium-term fiscal sustainability.  \n \nThe  thrust  of  the  FMRP  is  on  developing  and  implementing \nsystems  and  procedures  to  ensure  effective  and  sustainable \ncompliance with fiscal objectives. The ADB assistance is expected \nto  be  complemented  by  an  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) \nPoverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility  (PRGF)  and  Enhanced \nFund  Facility  (EFF),  currently  suspended,  that  is  likely  to  include \ntaxation  policy  reform  measures.  The  second  tranche  release  of \nPRGF  was  originally  due  in  December  2003.  However,  following \npolitical  developments,  including  the  dissolution  of  Parliament  in \nFebruary  2004  and  the  general  elections  of  April  2004,  the  new \nGovernment  is  firming  up  key  macroeconomic  policies  and  is  in \ndiscussions  with  IMF  on  the  resumption  of  PRGF.  Looking \nforward,  the  PRGF  is  not  likely  to  be  renewed  before  early  2005 \nfollowing the Government\u2019s 2005 budget and supporting economic \npolicy framework action plans. \n \nDecember 2007 \n\n \n \nThe  FMRP  supports  the  strengthening  of  public  finances  by \nimproving public resource and expenditure management systems, \npromoting fiscal discipline, and supporting fiscal decentralization. \n \nTo achieve these objectives, the FMRP will support: (i) improving \neffectiveness  of  tax  administration,  (ii) improving  the  budget \nframework,  (iii) improving  expenditure  management  and  control \nsystems,  (iv) strengthening  fiscal  discipline,  and  (v) improving \nfiscal coordination. \n \nMore  generally, \nthe  FMRP  will  help  create  an  enabling \nenvironment  to  foster  mobilization  of  tax  revenues,  improve \neffectiveness  of  public  expenditures  and,  ultimately,  place  public \nfinances on a sustainable path. \n \nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $45 million  equivalent  from  OCR.  The \nFMRP loan will have a 15-year term including a grace period of 3 \nyears,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms \nand conditions set forth in the Program Loan Agreement. \n \n\nPeriod and Tranching  The  FMRP  loan  period  will  be  3  years  from  December  2004  to \nDecember 2007. The loan will be released in three equal tranches \nof  $15 million  each.  The  first  tranche  will  be  released  upon  loan \neffectiveness. The second and third tranches are expected  to be \nreleased  within 18  and  36  months, respectively, from release of \n\n\f \n\n \n\niii\n\nthe  first  tranche,  subject  to  the  satisfactory  compliance  with \nsecond and third tranche release conditions, respectively. \n\nto \n\nthe \n\nthe  secretary \n\nIn  accordance  with \n\n \nThe  Executing  Agency  (EA)  of  the  program  loan  will  be  the \nMinistry  of  Finance  and  Planning  (MOFP).  MOFP  will  set  up  an \ninteragency  implementation  and  coordination  committee  (IICC) \nheaded  by \ntreasury  and  comprising \nrepresentatives  from  the  Fiscal  Policy  Department,  National \nBudget  Department,  External  Resource  Department,  National \nPlanning  Department,  Public  Enterprises  Department,  State \nAccounts Department, Revenue Board, Central Bank of Sri Lanka, \nand Finance Commission. ADB will also be a member of the IICC. \nThe  IICC  will  meet  every  quarter  to  monitor,  coordinate,  and \nensure  the  effective  implementation  of  the  proposed  reforms \nunder the FMRP. \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nexchange costs of items produced and procured in ADB member \ncountries, excluding ineligible items and imports financed by other \nthe \nbilateral  and  multilateral  sources. \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures \nand  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,  the  proceeds  of \nthe  FMRP  loan  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Government  as  the \nBorrower.  The  Government  will  certify  that  the  volume  of  eligible \nimports  exceeds  the  amount  of  ADB\u2019s  projected  disbursements \nunder  the  loan  for  the  given  period.  It  is  expected  that  the  loan \nproceeds will be utilized over a period of 36 months from the date \nof  loan  effectiveness.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of \nthe loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s \ncertification.  Loan  proceeds  may  be  used  to  finance  eligible \nimports for which expenditures were incurred 180 days before the \nFMRP loan becomes effective. \n \nCounterpart funds generated from the FMRP loan will be used to \nmeet FMRP expenditures and associated costs of reform. \n \n \nThe  two  project  loans  will  support:  (i)  institutional  strengthening \nfocusing on the procurement of equipment primarily for the RAMIS \nto  ensure  a  prompt  and  smooth  transformation  of  the  revenue \nadministration;  and  (ii)  capacity  building  for  the  MRA,  MOFP \ndepartments, and other agencies to strengthen implementation of \nprocesses  and  procedures  outlined  in  the  FMRP  through  the \nengagement of consultancy services and training activities. \n \nADB  will  provide  two  project  loans.  The  first  project  loan  is  in  an \namount  of  $15 million  from  ADB\u2019s  OCR  with  a  term  of  25  years, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  and  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based loan facility, a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms \n\nExecuting Agency \nand Implementation \nArrangements  \n\nProcurement \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nProject Loan \n  Objectives \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n \n\n \n\nExecuting Agency \nand Implementation \nArrangements \n\nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\nFMRP Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nand  conditions  set  forth  in  the  Program  Loan  Agreement.  The \nsecond project loan is in an amount of SDR 6,672,000 ($10 million \nequivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.  The  loan  will \nhave  a  32-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years  and  an \ninterest  charge  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and \n1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  and  follow  such  other  conditions  as \nset forth in the Program Loan Agreement. \n \nMOFP  will  oversee  and  coordinate  project  loan  implementation. \nProject  implementation  will  be  carried  out  by:  (i) the  IICC;  and \n(ii) a project implementation unit for the MRA project, headed by a \nproject  manager  (consultant)  who  will  report  jointly  to  the  chief \nexecutive officer of the Revenue Board and to the secretary to the \ntreasury. \n \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  will  be  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Expenditure  procedures  will \nbe  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook. \nConsultants to be financed from the project loans will be recruited \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \nand  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  recruitment  of \ndomestic  consultants.  A \ntotal  of  160  person-months  of \ninternational  and  270  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \ninputs  will  be  required.  In  view  of  the  size  of  the  consulting \nservices  component,  a  management  coordination  team  will  be \nhired to be fully responsible for all administrative and managerial \naspects of the capacity-building activities under the Strengthening \nof  the  Fiscal  Management  Institution  Project.  In  view  of  the \nimportance  of  capacity-building  to  the  success  of  FMRP,  where \nfirms  are  to  be  engaged,  the  quality-based  selection  (QBS) \nmethod will be utilized for selection of consultants. Where possible \nand appropriate, simplified technical procedures will be applied.  \n \nThe FMRP will help establish a well-functioning, coordinated, and \nsemiautonomous  revenue  administration  that  is  expected  to \ncomprise  inland  revenue,  customs,  and  excise  departments,  and \nthat would be responsible for all aspects of revenue collection. As \npart  of  the  automation  of  the  revenue  administration,  the  FMRP \nwill  contribute  toward  establishing  e-government.  The  FMRP  will \nalso  help  streamline  budgeting  procedures  and  expenditure \ncontrol processes within MOFP. \n \nAs part of the reform agenda, the FMRP will support measures to \nstrengthen  fiscal  discipline  through  increasing  transparency  and \naccountability,  and  will  be  based  on  legislative  and  rules-based \nreporting requirements. \n \nThe  FMRP  will  support  the  reorientation  of  budget  management \nfrom a compliance-based system to one incorporating elements of \nresults-based budgeting.  This should set the stage for addressing \n \n\n\f \n\n  v\n\nconcerns  of  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  public  spending  and \neventually improve service delivery. \n \nFinally, support for fiscal decentralization will comprise measures \nto reduce the overlap of public expenditure functions across levels \nof  government  and  other  reforms  to  improve  funding  and \neffectiveness of devolved assignments. \n \nNotwithstanding  an  increase  in  effective  tax  contribution,  direct \nbeneficiaries  will  include  business  at  large  who  despite  paying \nhigher  taxes  on  average  (as  loopholes  are  closed  and  effective \ntax  compliance  strengthened)  over  the  medium  term,  will  benefit \nfrom  clearer,  simplified,  and  more  business-oriented  tax  and \ncustoms  administrations.  In  addition,  those  segments  of  the \npopulation  most  dependent  on  the  provision  of  public  goods  and \nservices\u2014particularly  across  subnational  constituencies\u2014should \nexpect  an  eventual  improvement  of  the  quality of  these  services. \nThis  would  reflect  FMRP  measures  supporting  the  curtailing  of \nduplication of expenditures and other nonproductive use of public \nresources. Finally, the population at large should benefit from the \nreduction  of  domestic  imbalances;  higher,  sustainable,  GDP \ngrowth; and attendant development objectives. \n \nThere  are  multiple  risks  to  the  successful  implementation  of  the \nFMRP. Foremost, consolidation of the peace process and political \nstability will be critical for the Government to oversee meaningful \neconomic  reforms.  Fiscal  consolidation  efforts,  in  particular,  will \nrequire  strong  government  commitment  and  any  slippages  in  the \nsecurity or political fronts may weaken the Government\u2019s resolve. \nAlthough  limited  disbursements  were  realized  in  2004,  resources \ncommitted  under  the  June  2003  Tokyo  Donor  Conference,  and \nsubject  to  progress  in  peace  talks,  should  facilitate  the  fiscal \nconsolidation process. \n \nOn  the  economic  front,  exogenous  shocks  to  the  economy  could \nimpair  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  undertake  aggressive  fiscal \nconsolidation  as  observed  in  2004  following  the  oil  price  shock \nand the prolonged drought. However, over the medium term, fiscal \nconsolidation leads to improved  macroeconomic stabilization and \ngreater  flexibility  to  cope  with  these  shocks,  thereby  creating  a \nreinforcing  link  between  the  deepening  of  fiscal  reforms  and  the \nability to cope with these shocks. In addition, the Government has \nundertaken  reform  measures  including  moves  toward  a  more \nflexible  exchange  rate  system  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  these \nshocks. \n \nOther  risks  include  the  power  of  vested  interests  that  could \nsupport  the status  quo and  that  may  successfully  mobilize public \nopinion (i.e., through strikes and other forms of industrial action) to \ndilute  the  reforms  and  possibly  prove  detrimental  to  the  FMRP \nobjectives.  There  are  also  institutional  risks  given  the  relatively \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\nthe \n\ninclude \n\n\u201cadditionality\u201d  of  a \n\noverstretched  resources  in  key  ministries  and  the  revenue \nadministration.  These,  combined  with  the  comprehensive  nature \nof  the  FMRP  and  the  close  links  with  political  risks,  may  slow \nimplementation of the FMRP.  \n \nSafeguards \nrenewed  and \nconstructive policy dialogue between the Government and IMF on \nconducive  macroeconomic  policies  and \nfiscal  consolidation \nfollowing  the  suspension  of  its  PRGF.  In  addition,  supporting \nproject  loans  under  FMRP  will  mitigate  institutional  risks  and \nothers  through  the  increased  supply  of  resources\u2014including \nconsulting  services,  equipment  and  training\u2014which  should  help \novercome  institutional  constraints,  build  capacity,  and  facilitate \nFMRP \nthis  reason,  close  coordination \nbetween ADB and the Government is of fundamental importance \nespecially with respect to monitoring of FMRP and, in particular of \nconsultants\u2019 performance. \n\nimplementation.  For \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on three proposed \nloans  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Fiscal  Management  Reform \nProgram  (FMRP).  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  support  would  comprise:  (i) an  ordinary \ncapital  resources  (OCR)-funded  program  loan  (policy  component)  for  FMRP  policy  reforms; \n(ii) an  OCR-funded  project  loan  for  Modernization  of  the  Revenue  Administration;  and  (iii) an \nAsian  Development  Fund  (ADF)-funded  project \nthe  Fiscal \nManagement Institutions. \n \n \n\nfor  Strengthening  of \n\nloan \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\n \n\n2. \nSri Lanka\u2019s economy continues on a strong recovery phase with gross domestic product \n(GDP) growing by 5.9% annually in 2003 compared with 4% in 2002 and a contraction of 1.5% \nin 2001. Growth was relatively broad based\u2014on the production side\u2014with the services sector \nrecording  7.7%  growth  (year  on  year)  and  accounting  for  a  55%  share  of  the  economy.  The \nindustry sector recorded 5.5% growth and the agriculture sector 1.5% growth. More generally, \neconomic growth has remained robust supported by accommodative monetary policy and fiscal \nconsolidation  (prior  to  the  oil  shock)  leading  to  seven  consecutive  quarters  of  GDP  growth  in \nexcess  of  5.5%,  including  6.2%  growth  in  2004Q1  before  slowing  to  5.2%  in  2004Q2.  (See \nSupplementary Appendix 1 for economic indicators, 1999\u20132003.)  \n \n3. \nOn the aggregate demand side, the recovery has been driven by domestic demand and \nmainly reflects a combination of improved security conditions in the country and the impact of \nthe Government\u2019s macroeconomic policy reforms. Domestic consumption in real terms in 2003 \nremained strong, growing by 6.1% (year on year) in 2003 against 6.5% in 2002, reflecting the \neffects of pent-up household demand as the security situation improved and disposable income \nincreased. More significantly, investment growth accelerated to 17% in 2003 from 6.7% in 2002, \nas investor confidence picked up from the initial increase in consumer confidence, reflecting the \ncontinuation  of  the  cease-fire  agreement  and  cautious  optimism  on  the  outlook  for  peace \ncombined with the introduction of more market-friendly policies. In particular, lower lending rates \nand  increased  government  investment,  particularly  in  the  North  and  East,  have  led  to  strong \nexpansion  in  power,  roads,  telecommunications,  and  building  construction.  The  upsurge  in \ninvestment  continues  apace  with  import  of  investment  goods  in  2004Q1  increasing  by  56%. \nFinally,  buoyed  by  a  recovery  of  the  world  economy,  exports  of  goods  and  nonfactor  services \ngrew by 4.8% in 2003. \n \n4. \nMore  importantly  for  long-term  growth,  the  recovery  reflected  a  strengthening  of  the \nmacroeconomic environment. In particular, fiscal consolidation\u2014the primary deficit improved to \n0.9% of GDP in 2003 from 1.6% in 2002 and 4.1% in 2001\u2014and exchange rate stabilization\u2014\nthe Sri Lanka rupee\u2019s real effective exchange rate depreciated by a moderate 2.8% in 2003\u2014\nled  to  a  deceleration  of  inflationary  pressures  with  inflation,  as  measured  by  the  Colombo \nconsumer  price  index  (CCPI),  declining  to  6.3%  in  2003  from  9.6%  in  2002.  This  led  to  a \nreduction in total resources raised in the domestic market,1 paving the way for a reduction of the \nprime lending rate to an average of 9.3% in 2003 from 13.2% in 2002 and 19.4% in 2001.  \n \n5. \nOn the external side, the overall balance of payments recorded a surplus of $502 million \nin  2003  (or  2.8%  of  GDP),  the  highest  since  1993.  This  reflected  a  reduced  current  account \n                                                 \n1  The total amount of resources raised in the domestic market in 2003 decreased to 4.5% of GDP from 8% of GDP \n\nin 2002. \n\n\f2 \n\ndeficit  (0.6%  of  GDP)  and  an  increased  surplus  in  the  capital  and  financial  accounts.  The \nreduced current account deficit was driven by a fast recovery in tourism, strong performance in \nthe  ports  subsector,  and  higher  worker  remittances.  In  2003  both  merchandise  exports  and \nimports  grew  by  9%  (year  on  year)  in  dollar  terms.  Meanwhile  capital  flows  into  the  country \nincreased  in  2003  led  by  inflows  of  foreign  direct  investment  of  $229 million  compared  with \n$197 million in 2002, due to larger privatization proceeds of approximately $30 million in 2003. \nTotal  long-term  loan  capital  increased  to  $908 million  from  $542 million  in  2002,  largely \nattributed to improvements in development assistance utilization rates, which increased to 21% \nin  2003  from  15%  in  2002.  Consequently,  in  2003  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  gross  official  external  reserves \nincreased to $2.3 billion, equivalent to 4.2 months of import cover. During the first half of 2004, \nthe  overall  balance  of  payments  pointed  to  a  deterioration  resulting  in  an  estimated  deficit  of \n$223 million. This reflected a widening deficit of the trade and income accounts driven by higher \noil prices that could not be fully offset by lower inflows to the capital and financial accounts.2 As \nof August 2004, gross official external reserves stood at $1.9 billion, a decline of 17% since the \nend of 2003 and equivalent to 3.1 months of imports. \n \nOver  the  medium  term  and  subject  to  an  early  resumption  of  peace  negotiations,  the \n6. \neconomic outlook remains favorable despite a difficult short-term patch reflecting the impact of \nhigh oil prices on the economy. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has recently revised its \nannual GDP growth estimates for 2004 to 5.0\u20135.5%, slightly below the 6% growth target under \nits  Monetary  Program  for  2004.  CCPI  average  inflation  is  targeted  at  4\u20136%  in  2004,  although \nthe  latest  CCPI  figure  for  October  2004  at  11.6%  (point-to-point),  and  reflecting  the  impact  of \nhigh oil prices suggests that the annual CCPI inflation target may be breached. Money supply \n(M2) continues to grow at 16% in August 2004 in excess of the 13.5% projected in the Monetary \nProgram due to higher than expected increases in credit to the private sector and in net credit to \nthe government.  Accordingly, corrective policy measures need to be introduced over the short-\nto medium term including tightening fiscal and monetary policies to curtail potential imbalances.  \nThe Government has reacted to these imbalances and in its meeting of early November 2004, \nthe Monetary Board raised benchmark interest rates by 50 basis points. \n \n7. \nHowever,  the  most  critical  challenge  to  sustained  growth  remains  the  current  fiscal \nstance  and,  particularly,  impaired  revenue  collection.  Following  efforts  to  stem  the  adverse \nimpacts of higher oil prices and a drought and coinciding with the two elections in 2004 (national \nand provincial) and delays in tightening revenue legislation, the target fiscal deficit has slipped \nfrom 6.8% of GDP in the 2004 budget to 7.3% in the Preelection Budgetary Position Report and \n8.6% of GDP in the Budget Economic and Fiscal Position Report 2005 of November 2004. The \nslippage  on  the  fiscal  front  has  already  led  to  a  weakening of  the  Sri  Lanka  rupee,  which  has \ndepreciated  by  approximately  8%  against  the  dollar  since  the  beginning  of  2004  and  3-month \nSLRe/US dollar forward rates in November 2004 were pricing in a further depreciation of 1.7%. \nSimilarly,  and  despite  evidence  of  financial  repression,  there  has  been  upward  pressure  on \ninterest  rates,  reflecting  expectations  of  increased  government  demand  for  loanable  funds \nparticularly at longer-term maturities in the secondary market. \n \n8. \nIn response to the weakening of the fiscal stance, and following the provincial elections \nin July 2004, the Government has begun reducing the subsidies on oil prices. These subsidies \nhave cost the treasury approximately SLRs8 billion according to preliminary estimates, placing \nfurther pressure on the budget. In these circumstances, the Government is expected to tighten \nfiscal policy and introduce a higher degree of fiscal discipline over the coming months. Indeed, \n\n                                                 \n2  The Government is facing a shortfall of foreign funding on the balance of payments of approximately $300 million in \n\n2004 including the $150 million \u201ctemporary relief\u201d credit line from the Government of India. \n\n\f  3\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthe Government has committed to a fiscal consolidation strategy, which will need to be closely \nadhered  to  if  stable  and  sustainable  GDP  growth  is  to  be  maintained.  More  importantly,  while \nthe  fiscal  targets  under  the  Fiscal  Management  (Responsibility)  Act  are  not  expected  to  be \nachieved  by  targeted  date  of  end-2006,  the  Government  will  need  to  undertake  prompt \ncorrective action and publicly commit to avoiding any further slippages beyond the expected 2-\nyears delay announced in the 2005 Budget. \n \n9. \nDuring  the  first  nine  months  of  2004,  tourism  revenues  remained  buoyant  as  tourist \narrivals  increased  by  11%.  Similarly,  the  stock  market  continued  its  bull  run  as  market \ncapitalization at the Colombo stock exchange increased by 38% in Sri Lanka rupee terms during \nthe first 10 months of 2004. Similarly, in international trade, merchandise exports during the first \nnine months of 2004 increased by 9% while merchandise imports during this period soared by \n20.5%.  The acceleration of imports is mostly due to the hike in oil prices, which is expected to \nlead to expenditures on oil imports of $1.6 billion, almost double the import bill in 2003. In these \ncircumstances, the growing current account deficit is projected at approximately 4% of GDP, up \nfrom 0.6% in 2003.  \n  \n10.  More  generally,  the  outlook  will  be  largely  dependent  on  the  overall  prevailing  security \nconditions and, in general, progress in peace talks between the Government and the Liberation \nTigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). If progress is faster than expected, growth could be somewhat \nhigher, aided by the $4.5 billion in foreign assistance committed at the June 2003 Tokyo Donor \nConference  for  the  period  2003\u20132006.  The  challenge  in  this  scenario  would  be  the  need  to \nincrease the Government\u2019s absorptive capacity\u2014including both at the national and subnational \nlevels.  If  there  is  a  setback  to  peace  talks,  investor  confidence  could  plummet,  potentially \naffecting  private  capital  flows  and  undermining  growth  prospects.  Political  stability,  given  the \nwide ideological spectrum of the parties forming the governing alliance, will also weigh heavily \non this front. \n \nFrom a policy perspective, the outlook is subject to continued progress in strengthening \n11. \nthe  macroeconomic  framework.  Two  of  the  key  issues  undermining  stable  and  sustainable \ngrowth  include  reducing  the  fiscal  deficit  and,  closely  related,  lowering  the  public  debt.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  ability  to  meet  the  development  objectives  established  in  its  Economic  Policy \nFramework  will  depend  on  success  in  strengthening  the  macroeconomic  framework  and,  in \nparticular, addressing these economic imbalances. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\nFiscal  consolidation  remains  key  to  improving  the  macroeconomic  performance  in  Sri \n12. \nLanka.  Over  the  years,  mounting  defense  spending  on  top  of  generous  social  sector \nexpenditure  led  to  increasing  pressure  on  the  budget.  Attempts  to  raise  tax  revenues  failed \ngiven the narrow revenue base and weak tax administration. Debt financing proved a temporary \nreprieve.  Financial  liberalization  eroded  the  captive  pool  of  available  funds,  forcing  the \nGovernment  to  pay  higher  interest  on  its  domestic  debt.  In  addition,  strains  on  the  balance  of \npayments  led  to  exchange  rate  devaluations,  raising  the  local  currency  value  of  the  external \ndebt.  Increasing  budget  deficits,  in  turn,  led  to  a  crowding  out  of  needed  physical  and  social \ncapital and private investment, weakening GDP growth. As a result, in 2002 the budget deficit, \nexcluding grants and privatization proceeds, reached 8.9% of GDP and public debt increased to \n106% of GDP. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nOn the revenue side, the problem is traced fundamentally to the complex tax policy that \n13. \nprevailed  in  Sri  Lanka  in  combination  with  the  myriad  of  tax  exemptions.  These  inherent \ndistortions  multiplied  over  the  years  due  to  government  largesse  and,  in  particular,  industrial \npolicy objectives, which dominated tax revenue and other fiscal objectives. In addition, relatively \nweak  revenue  administration  in  the  inland  revenue,  customs  and  excise  departments,  and \nBoard  of  Investment  (BOI)\u2014reflecting  a  shortfall  of  skilled  and  adequately  paid  staff\u2014further \nconstrain  effective  revenue  collection.  Over  the  years,  enforcement  capabilities  were  further \nstrained and there was a general perception of prevalent corruption among many customs and \ntax  officers.  To  make  matters  worse,  governments  were  frequently  granting  tax  amnesties, \ncreating leakage in the system and further undermining tax collection and enforcement efforts. \nFurther  abetted  by  the  elimination  of  taxes  on  international  trade,  tax  yields  declined  by  4.6 \npercentage points from 17.8% of GDP in 1995 to 13.2% in 2003. \n \n14. \nOn  the  expenditure  side,  Sri  Lanka  is  characterized  by  a  framework  that  until  recently \nwas rather lax in terms of both expenditure ceilings and controls and had a weak link between \nfiscal  objectives  and  the  budget  framework.  In  addition,  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  large  and  overstretched \npublic sector, including commercial public enterprises, was unable to meet spiraling costs and \ntended  to  subsist  thanks  to  direct  subsidies  and/or  subsidized  lending  by  the  state,  placing \nadditional pressure on state accounts (and state banks). The internal conflict in Sri Lanka also \ncontributed  to  increased  budgetary  pressure  as  scarce  resources  were  directed  to  financing \nrelatively  large  military  spending.  Finally,  there  has  been  a  pattern  of  politically  induced \nloosening  of  the  fiscal  policy  stance  in  the  run-up  to  elections,  and  once  again  witnessed  in \n2004. Against this backdrop, current expenditures in 2003 were estimated at 19% of GDP, down \nfrom 20.9% in 2002. Public investment absorbed a significant part of the expenditure cutbacks, \nfalling to 4.6% of GDP in 2002, the lowest in a decade, before increasing to 5% in 2003. (See \nSupplementary Appendix 2 for a summary of government fiscal operations.) \n \n15. \nAs  government  revenues  were  unable  to  cover  the  increased  spending  requirements, \nthe  deficits  were  increasingly  financed  through  domestic  borrowing.  However,  rising  deficits \nplaced  upward  pressure  on  interest  rates,  increasing  debt  service  payments.  In  parallel,  the \nGovernment  also  borrowed  overseas  for  the  purchase  of  defense  equipment,  putting  further \npressure on state revenues. In addition, external borrowing was contracted primarily in dollars, \nwhich combined with the depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee led to even higher debt-servicing \npayments.3  Finally,  given  the  nature  of  the  debt  market,  there  was  an  overconcentration  of \nshort-term debt that limited effective debt management. \n \nIn these conditions, public debt soared to 106% of GDP in 2002 from 87% in 1997\u201458% \n16. \npublic domestic debt and 48% public foreign debt. In 2002, and realizing the importance of fiscal \nconsolidation,  the  Government  prepared  a  fiscal  consolidation  program  in  line  with  its  fiscal \nsustainability strategy. As part of the strategy, the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act was \napproved in early 2003. The overall budget deficit target under the Act was set at 5% by the end \nof 2006. On the basis of a tightening of expenditures, and coinciding with significant interest rate \ndeclines  reflecting  an  inflation  stabilization-oriented  monetary  framework,  the  overall  budget \ndeficit  in  2003  was  reduced  to  8%  of  GDP.  While  above  target,  it  nevertheless  represented  a \nsignificant improvement compared with the 8.9% recorded in 2002. The year 2003 also marked \nthe  first  time  that  the  Government\u2019s  outstanding  debt  stock was  contained  as  a  percentage  of \nGDP.  Total  debt-servicing  payments  in  2003  increased  to  almost  20%  of  GDP  comprising \n\n                                                 \n3  According  to  CBSL  Annual  Report  2002,  the  cumulative  increase  in  the  foreign  debt  stock  due  to  exchange  rate \ndepreciation  during  1996\u20132002\u2014amounting  to  SLRs251  billion\u2014was  about  35%  of  the  total  outstanding  foreign \ndebt stock at the end of 2002, equivalent to 15.8% of GDP in 2002.  \n\n\f \n\n  5\n\nalmost  12.5%  in  amortization  and  over  7%  in  interest  payments,  the  latter  almost  entirely  in \ndomestic debt. More critically, higher debt servicing places undue pressure on capital spending. \nIn 2003, interest payments accounted for over one third of current expenditures and exceeded \ncapital spending by a ratio of 1.4:1. To make matters worse, due to a spike in debt amortization \npayments,  debt  service  payments  exceeded  total  revenue  collection  in  both  2002  and  2003. \n(See Supplementary Appendix 3 for Sri Lankan key debt indicators.) \n \n17. \nOn the fiscal front, the first half of 2004 resulted in a mixed picture. On the expenditure \nside,  performance  was  disappointing.  The  impact  of  relief  assistance  to  drought-stricken \nhouseholds  and  subsidies  to  cushion  the  effect  of  higher  international  oil  prices  against  the \nbackdrop of national and provincial elections explain the setback. Despite the oil subsidies not \nbeing  fully  reflected  on  the  budget,  current  expenditure  for  2004  has  been  revised  to  a \nprovisional  figure  of  SLRs353.1  billion  for  2004  compared  with  SLRs330.2  billion  in  2003,  an \nincrease  of 6.9%.  Public  investment  also  increased  to  a  provisional  SLRs361.9  billion  in  2004 \ncompared with SLRs334.5 billion in 2003, an increase of 8.2% over the same period in 2003. \n \nOn  the  revenue  side,  the  performance  was  slightly  more  promising.  Despite  the \n18. \ncarryover  of  outstanding  revenue  loopholes  from  2003,  total  revenues  in  the  first  half  of  2004 \nreached  a  provisional  figure  of  SLRs143.1  billion  compared  with  SLRs136.8  billion  during  the \nsame  period  a  year  earlier,  an  increase  of  4.6%.  These  loopholes  included  (i) administrative \nshortcomings;  (ii) the  complexity  in  determining  types  of  value-added  tax  (VAT)  bases  and \n(iii) high  refund  incidences.  Nevertheless,  the  Government  has  responded  by  tidying  up  loose \nends  and  in  September  2004,  amendments  to  the  VAT4  and  Inland  Revenue  acts  were \nsubmitted to Parliament.  \n \n19. \nDeepening of audit measures also had a positive impact and contributed SLRs2.7 billion \nto revenue collection during the first half of 2004. Of this amount, SLRs1.2 billion was collected \nfrom  VAT  and  SLRs0.9  billion  from  income  tax.  The  customs  department  also  exceeded  its \ntarget  for  the  first  half  of  2004  having  collected  total  revenues  of  SLRs82.4  billion  against  the \ntargeted  revenue  of  SLRs74  billion.  Buoyed  by  strong  imports,  including  higher  oil  prices  and \nmore recently the impact of the depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee, VAT collection on imports \nwas  SLRs33.7  billion  against  a  target  of  SLRs31.9  billion.  On  the  negative  side,  corporate \nincome tax collection, however, was a disappointing 64% of the target for the first 6 months of \n2004. This reflected a combination of investment allowances and lower profits due to offsetting \nlosses traced to restructuring measures in some cases and the writing off of bad debts on the \npart  of  banks.5  On  the  nontax  revenue  side,  privatization  receipts  during  the  first  half  of  2004 \nwere SLRs2.4 billion against an annual target of SLRs13 billion. Similarly, central bank profits\u2014\na major source of nontax earnings in 2003\u2014totaled only SLRs1 billion in the first half of 2004, \nagainst an annual target of SLRs5 billion. \n \nB. \n \n20. \nThe  Government  has  responded  to  the  fiscal  challenge  by  placing  reforms  to  the \nrevenue  administration  at  the  forefront  of  the  economic  reform  agenda  with  the  objective  of \nsetting  public  finances  on  a  sustainable  path.  (See  Appendix  1  for  the  fiscal  program \nunderpinning the Government\u2019s new Economic Policy Framework and Supplementary Appendix \n4 for an analysis of the primary balance and debt sustainability.) \n \n\nThe Government\u2019s Reform Program \n\n                                                 \n4  VAT is estimated to generate 45% of total tax revenue in Sri Lanka. \n5  This also brings to light the weakness in the preparation of revenue estimates. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nThe Government\u2019s reform program for strengthening public finances is based on a three-\n21. \npillar  strategy:  a  revamped  fiscal  framework  established  under  the  Fiscal  Management \n(Responsibility)  Act,  an  enabling  policy  environment  in  the  form  of  an  overhauled  and \nstreamlined  taxation  policy,  and  institutional  strengthening  of  the  revenue  administration \nsupported by the creation of a modernized revenue administration. \n \n22. \nThe Government is committed to the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, approved \nby Parliament in January 2003, albeit with a delay that reflects the impact of the 2004 elections \nand more recently the external oil shock. The Act requires the Government to reduce the overall \nbudget deficit to 5% of GDP and total debt to 85% of GDP, respectively, in a phased manner, by \nthe end of 2006. It will also contribute to greater fiscal transparency and accountability, as the \nGovernment is required to report to Parliament every 6 months on the performance relative to \nthe  intended  fiscal  objectives.  (See  Appendix  2  for  a  description  of  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal \nobjectives  and  reporting  requirements  under  the  Act.)  The  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Fiscal \nProgram  (2005\u20132008)  (MTFP)  (see  Supplementary  Appendix  5)  released  in  November  2004, \nhowever, targets a 5.7% of GDP budget deficit by the end of 2007 and 4.4% of GDP by end of \n2008. \n \n23. \nA centerpiece of the reform agenda is the strengthening of the revenue administration. \nThe  Modernization  of  the  Revenue  Administration  (MRA)  aims  to  integrate  into  one  Revenue \nBoard  the  various  revenue  department  heads  including  inland  revenue,  customs  and  excise \ndepartments.  The  Revenue  Board  will  be  a  semiautonomous  corporate  body  chaired  by  the \ncommissioner  general  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Department  (IRD)  and  with  a  chief  executive \nofficer (CEO) reporting to a board of directors. The Revenue Board will have authority over all \naspects  of  revenue  administration  and  will  be  based  on  the  improved  coordination  of  core \nfunctions of inland revenue, customs and excise departments. A new human resource policy will \nbe designed based on a more flexible and competency-acquired employment system; it will also \nprovide  for  an  improved  incentives  scheme.  As  part  of  the  reforms  to  human  resource \ndevelopment,  IRD  has  already  announced  the  promotion  of  620  of  the  better  performing  IRD \nstaff  from  tax  collectors  to  tax  assessors.  In  addition,  a  new  information  technology  (IT) \ndevelopment  strategy  will  be  introduced  based  on  the  automation  of  tax  administration  and \nthereby contribute toward e-government. \n \n24. \nThe MTFP seeks to achieve a stable macroeconomic environment supported by policies \nthat focus on generating revenue, thereby augmenting fiscal space to ensure greater investment \nand  stable  growth.  On  the  revenue  side,  supported  by  the  FMRP\u2019s  modernizing  and \nstrengthening  of  the  revenue  departments,  overall  revenues  are  targeted  to  increase  by  3.3 \npercentage points from 15.6% of GDP in 2004 to 18.9% in 2007 (19.5% in 2008). This reflects \nan expected strong increase in tax revenues from 14.1% of GDP in 2004 to 17.1% in 2007 and \na  moderate  increase  in  nontax  revenues  from  1.5%  to  1.8%  during  the  same  period.  On  the \nexpenditure  side,  the  FMRP  balances  cutbacks  in  current  expenditure  in  favor  of  increases  in \npublic investment with the aim of accelerating the national infrastructure development program, \nincluding  expanding  rural  infrastructure  facilities  and  supporting  human  resource  development \nfacilities.  Indeed,  total  expenditures  are  targeted  to  increase  moderately  from  24.2%  of  GDP \nexpected in 2004 to 24.6% by 2007 (and a decline to 23.9% in 2008); however, this is based on \na  reduction  of  current  expenditure  by  2.6  percentage  points  to  16.7%  of  GDP  in  2007  and  an \nincrease  in  public  investment  by  2.8  percentage  points  to  7.8%  of  GDP  in  2007  (and  7.9%  in \n2008). The budget deficit is targeted to decline from 8.6% of GDP in 2004 to 5.7% in 2007 (and \n4.4% in 2008). \n \n\n\f \n\n  7\n\nAs  a  means  to  enhance  revenue,  the  2005  Budget  presented  on  18  November  2004 \n25. \nincludes  a  comprehensive  set  of  revenue  measures.  Revenue  policy  measures  reflect  the \nintroduction  of:  (i)  higher  excise  duty  rates  on  various  luxury  (and  non-luxury)  items;  (ii) \nincreased  customs  valuation  of  5%  across  a  range  of  intermediate  and  final  imported  goods \ntogether with an additional 10% excise duty levied on these goods; and (iii) increases in import \ncess (duty) as well as port and airport levies. In addition, civil servants will be brought into the \ntax net and will become liable for pay-as-you-earn (PAYE). Finally, income tax will be applied at \na 15% rate, up to a threshold, with step-wise marginal rate increases up to 30%. VAT bands will \nbe expanded (after the previous government had consolidated them) from 0% and 15% to 0%, \n5%, 15% and 18%. While the standard rate is 15%, a basic commodity rate on essential food \nitems  will  be  introduced  at  5%  and  a  luxury  rate  of  18%  will  be  applied  to  selected  consumer \nitems.  The  recently  introduced  Economic  Service  Charge  (ESC)  will  be  reduced  to  0.5%  of \nwholesale  or  retail  trade  from  1%.  In  a  nod  to  the  business  community,  and  with  the  view  to \ndeepening  the  corporate  debt  market,  withholding  tax  on  corporate  debt  will  be  removed  and \nonly the final tax retained. A host of existing deductions on corporate taxes will be tightened. On \nnon-tax measures the major item includes profits from central bank operations. Financing of the \nbudget will also benefit from privatization of assets from the hospitality industry. In total, revenue \nmeasures  are  projected  to  lead  to  a  1.6  percentage  points  increase  in  revenues  in  2005  to \n17.2% of GDP. (See Supplementary Appendix 6 for the economic classification of revenue by \ncomponent.)  \n \n26. \nExpenditure  rationalization  measures  will  need  to  accommodate  a  40%  increase  of \ncurrent  basic  salary  of  civil  servants  starting  in  December  2004.  While  the  exact  increase  is \ndetermined by a formula according to pay scales, the overall wage bill is projected to increase \nby approximately 27% in 2005 (against an estimated 10% increase in inflation). This increase in \nthe  wage  bill  subsumes  an  increase  of  42,000  new  recruits  into  the  civil  service  in  2004.  In \nparallel,  pension  payments  will  increase  by  15%  of  basic  pension  effective  from  December \n2004. Other expenditure cutback measures will include introducing procurement management, \nimproved  accounting  and  auditing  standards.  (See \ntighter  expenditure  controls,  and \nSupplementary  Appendix  7  for  the  economic  classification  of  expenditure  and  lending  minus \nrepayment.)  In  addition,  debt  management  treasury  functions  are  being  strengthened  to \nrestructure  higher-cost  with  lower-cost  debt.  Public  enterprises  will  also  be  restructured,  both \noperationally  and  financially,  to  reduce  their  dependence  on  budgetary  support.  Finally  public \nexpenditure  programs  will  be  reprioritized  according  to  the  Government\u2019s  pledge  to  increase \nsupport for rural development in line with improved cost efficiency and better quality of services.  \n \nC. \n \n27. \nAgainst this backdrop, activities in the past 2 years under the previous Government have \nbeen impressive in the range and breadth of the systems introduced to address the problems. \nThe  real  question  facing  Sri  Lanka  is  not  whether  the  determination  to  solve  the  problem  of \npersistent budget deficits exists\u2013\u2013indeed even the new Government is keenly aware that there \nis  no  alternative  even  if  2004  has  been  a  lost  year\u2014but  whether  these  activities  are  likely  to \nsucceed.  In  many  cases,  success  will  depend  on  understandings  and  actions  in  areas  where \nstrategies are currently being developed, including  public sector pay, persistently loss-making \nparastatal  corporations,  the  narrow  tax  base,  the  development  of  an  effective  tax  collection \nadministration,  the  integration  of  medium-term  planning  with  the  annual  budget  round,  control \nover  liabilities  created  by  past  promises,  effective  fiscal  devolution,  and  the  pressures  that  a \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nrapidly  aging  population  will  put  on  the  national  budget.6  The  success  of  the  proposed \ngovernment reform program will be closely linked to concrete measures to address these issues \nas they are ultimately related to the wider goals of strengthening public finance. \n \nThe following provides a diagnostic of some of the more critical constraints in three core \n28. \nareas under FMRP, namely, revenue collection, budget programming and expenditure controls, \nand  fiscal  decentralization.  The  assessment  of  these  constraints  will  set  the  stage  for  the \nprogram-supported proposed reform solutions. \n \n\n1. \n\nConstrained Revenue Collection \n\n \n29. \nRevenue  collection  in  Sri  Lanka  is  constrained  by  various  factors.  The  most  critical  of \nthese  is  a  weak  and  underfunded  tax  administration  and  a  tax  policy  regime  that  effectively \ndiscourages  timely  taxpayer  compliance.  Accordingly,  the  tax  base  is  very  narrow  comprising \n789,221 PAYE taxpayers and 194,824 income taxpayers, including 19,582 corporate taxpayers \nof which 2,850 paid income tax in 2003. Moreover, there is a large parallel economy; granting of \ntax  holidays  is  a  frequent  practice;  civil  servants  are  exempt  from  paying  income  tax;  and  the \nretail and wholesale sectors are exempt from VAT. Furthermore, tax collectors tend to arbitrarily \nsanction the legitimate taxpayers, often reflecting poorly designed incentive clauses and lack of \ntaxpayer rights. \n \n30.  More  generally,  there  is  a  compartmentalized  and  fragmented  approach  to  tax \nadministration  reflecting  institutional  constraints  that  hinder  effective  tax  administration.  This  is \ntraced to deep-rooted segmentation between inland revenue, customs and excise departments, \neach  having  its  own  distinct  institutional  culture.  Lack  of  resources  has  undermined  the \ndevelopment of skilled and specialized tax administration staff as well as the modernization of \nintegrated IT systems across tax departments. Reforms to human resource development and IT \nsystems  would  thus  prove  critical  in  exploiting  economies  of  scale  and  lead  to  positive \nexternalities from sharing functions across different tax departments. \n \n31. \nTo  aggravate  matters,  the  tax  regime  is  beset  by  distortions  of  various  types.  First, \ntaxation policy in Sri Lanka has traditionally been used as a means to attract investment through \ntax  holidays  and  other  tax  concessions,  and  thereby  redirect  resources  to  selected  sectors  of \nthe  economy.  Taxation  policy  has  thus  remained  subservient  to  industrial  policies  to  the \ndetriment  of  effective  tax  collection,  but  also  creating  additional  sources  of  \u201ctax  leakage,\u201d \nthereby  increasing  the  costs  of  effective  enforcement.  Second,  governments  have  frequently \nresorted  to  tax  amnesties  or  exonerations,  which  have  proven  costly  to  the  state.  Indeed,  the \n2003  general  tax  amnesty  represents  the  11th  time  in  40  years  that  a  tax  amnesty  has  been \ngranted  in  Sri  Lanka.  This  has  resulted  in  lost  potential  tax  revenue,  as  tax  collectors  forfeit \nrevenues from the backlog of tax arrears under investigation. More detrimentally, tax amnesties \nhave  seldom  had  much  impact  in  terms  of  increasing  either  tax  revenue  or  the  tax  net.  The \namnesties  prove  even  more  costly  to  the  state  in  terms  of  induced  moral  hazard.  Indeed, \nnegative  signaling  results  from  the  Government\u2019s  actions  to  future  taxpayers  (i.e.,  nontax \nregistered/nontax-declaring corporations and individuals) who will reason that they are better off \nremaining outside the tax net and waiting for a future amnesty. \n \n\n2. \n\nWeak Budget Programming and Expenditure Control Framework \n\n \n32. \nBudget programming in  Sri Lanka is in an evolving state and has yet to benefit from a \nfull-fledged, medium-term budget programming and expenditure framework. Critical constraints \n\n                                                 \n6  A more detailed analysis of these issues was presented to the Government under an ADB-funded report, Structural \n\nFiscal Imbalances in Sri Lanka, August 2003. \n\n\f \n\n  9\n\ninclude systems and procedures within the budget department, which prevent line departments \nfrom  effective  management  of  a  steady  stream  of  committed  yet  discontinuously  disbursed \nresources.  In  particular,  there  is  limited  predictability  in  the  allocation  of  revenues  across \ndepartments and over time, given the narrow outreach of the existing framework. For example, \nthe  budget  department  is  only  now  beginning  to  introduce  international  practices  in  using \nforward estimate techniques for budget programming. In addition, the budgeting framework has \ninherent limitations resulting from an outdated classification system that fails to link up current \nand capital expenditures. These constraints often result in difficulties in ensuring effective and \ntimely resource allocation, thereby limiting the returns from public investment projects. \n \n33. \nIn a related area, expenditure control systems are weak and difficult to enforce within the \ncontext of revenue streams that are discontinuous over time and subject to the fluctuations of \nexternal shocks and, more generally, the business cycle. This creates difficulties in expenditure \nmanagement as expenditure (and revenue) targets are often missed. Against this background, \nSri  Lanka  needs  to  pursue  effective  fiscal  consolidation  if  the  structural  deficits  are  to  be \nreduced. Over time, automatic stabilizers will become effective in helping to steer the economy \nby provisioning during boom years and using these savings to make up for the revenue shortfall \nin  downturns.  In  the  meantime,  effective  fiscal  consolidation  will  be  critical  in  supporting  the \nGovernment\u2019s macroeconomic stabilization efforts. \n \nControl  systems  are  also  constrained  by  limited  monitoring  capability  of  off-budget \n34. \nexpenditures  and  borrowings.  The  problem  is  exacerbated  by  a  lack  of  clear  procedures  and \ntreasury  systems  for  registering  and  managing  financial  obligations.  As  a  result,  unaccounted \ncommitments across departments often accumulate, which eventually become due and have to \nbe  liquidated  by  the  Government  imposing  further  and  at  times,  sudden  \u201cleakages\u201d  on  the \nexpenditure side. \n \n\n3. \n\nLimited Fiscal Decentralization \n\n \n35. \nFrom a public policy perspective, fiscal decentralization can be welfare enhancing as it \nbrings spending (and revenue) powers and decisions closer to those who will most benefit from \nthese public projects. The more typical of these delegated public expenditure assignments are, \nfor  example,  road  maintenance,  local  irrigation,  schools,  and  community  health  posts.  These \nspending initiatives are often the ones that have the highest effect on poverty reduction. Hence, \nsupporting effective fiscal decentralization can enhance poverty reduction. \n \n36.  With  the  approval  of  the  13th  amendment  of  the  Constitution  in  1987,  the  legal \nunderpinning  for  devolution  of  power  from  the  center  to  the  provinces  was  established. \nHowever, neither self-sufficiency of subnational government nor efficiency considerations in the \nfiscal framework was part of the underlying principles. Henceforth, and despite the introduction \nof reforms granting spending and revenue powers to provincial councils (PCs), there has been \nlimited  fiscal  devolution.  Provincial  governments  spend  only  about  10\u201311%  of  the  combined \nexpenditure  of  the  center  and  the  provinces,  and  own  revenue  accounts  for  less  than  17%  of \ntheir expenditures. This has led to a vertical imbalance between the provinces and the center, \nthereby fostering dependency. There are also significant horizontal imbalances across PCs. \n \n37. \nPiecemeal  and  limited  devolution,  however,  has  not  prevented  the  overlapping  of \nfunctions and responsibilities between central and provincial departments of the administration. \nThis has resulted in a misuse of scarce resources that is compounded by the fact that salaries \nof provincial civil service staff account for over 65% of provincial government total expenditures \nwhile  capital  expenditures  account  for  only  16%.  On  the  institutional  side,  a  Finance \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nCommission oversees fiscal devolution. However, a combination of limited decentralization skills \nand  resources  and  weak  accountability  has  resulted  in  limited  progress  in  meeting  the \nobjectives of the 13th amendment. \n \nThese  weaknesses  are  overshadowed  by  a  more  critical  factor  in  the  form  of  a  poorly \n38. \ndesigned,  combined  block  and  matching  grant  formula  for  intergovernment  revenue  transfers. \nThe nature of the formula is such that it creates moral hazard by effectively discouraging greater \neffort of revenue mobilization at the provincial level and further entrenching dependency. This is \ndue  to  the  fact  that  for  any  additional  revenues  generated  at  the  provincial  level  from  the \nmatching  grant  element,  there  is  an  almost  offsetting  loss  of  block  grant  from  the  center, \nresulting in only a net marginal gain to the province. As a result, block grants accounted for 81% \nof total intergovernment transfers versus 1% for matching grants in 2003. (See Supplementary \nAppendix 8 for expenditure and revenues at the PCs and intergovernment transfers.) \n \n39. \nFinally, capital expenditure funding from the  center to the  provinces is based solely on \ngrant financing. A move toward debt financing over the medium-term and subject to increased \nabsorptive capacity could free up additional resources and help create greater incentives for the \nprovinces to make more productive use of these funds. \n \n\n4. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \n40. \nADB has had limited experience in operational support for fiscal management reforms. \nHowever,  ADB  has  had  relevant  experience  in  public  expenditure  management  reforms.  A \nspecial  evaluation  study7  raised  important  issues,  highlighting  that  \u201cpublic  expenditure \nmanagement  is  a  core  function  of  governments  and  that  external  assistance  needs  to  build  a \ngovernment\u2019s  capacities  to  fulfill  these  functions.\u201d  The  FMRP  follows  this  approach  with  the \nthrust  on  developing  and  implementing  systems  and  procedures  to  ensure  effective  and \nsustainable compliance with fiscal objectives. \n\n41. \nThe  study  also  stressed  that  \u201cownership  is  one  of  the  key  ingredients  to  develop \ncapacities,\u201d which entails conducting policy dialogue and capacity mapping. There was no better \nexample  in  this  regard  than  the  shortcomings  in  the  previous  Government\u2019s  unsuccessful \nattempt to introduce the concept of the Sri Lanka Revenue Authority (SLRA). While the concept \nhad  some  very  good  initiatives,  the  process  was  not  satisfactorily  managed,  with  limited \nownership  among  critical  stakeholders  and  ultimately  set  aside  by  the  new  Government.  The \ncapacity  mapping,  in  turn,  should  focus  on  a  comprehensive  approach  to  the  budget  cycle, \nintegrating the various agencies involved, instead of focusing on one core agency. \n\n42. \nThe FMRP follows this approach by strengthening coordination of participating agencies \nacross a wide spectrum, providing institutional support to these agencies, and introducing policy \nreforms that promote a more enabling, fiscally sustainable, environment. As part of institutional \nstrengthening,  the  focus  will  be  on  creating  a  coordinated  revenue  administration  based  on \ndeveloping  greater  commonality  in  core  functions  through  IT  integration  and  more  supportive, \nand  incentives-based,  human  resource  development  policies.  Furthermore,  the  FMRP  will \ninclude an assessment of the performance of the revenue administration toward the end of the \nFMRP,  based  on  institutional  performance  indicators  to  be  designed  as  part  of  the  supporting \nmodernization  strategies.  Subject  to  a  favorable  assessment  of  the  revenue  administration \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n  11\n\nreforms  and  continued  government  support,  there  may  be  scope  for  deeper  integration  of \nrevenue administration reforms over the medium-term.  \n\n43. \nThe FMRP has benefited from close coordination with development partners, particularly \nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Blueprints for modernization plans \nfor  the  revenue  departments  were  discussed  at  a  workshop  hosted  by  Canada  Customs  and \nRevenue  Agency  and  organized  by  ADB  and  IMF  in  early  2003.  Close  coordination  between \nADB and the Government has also been critical. A task list or road map for the modernization of \nthe revenue administration was proposed by ADB and presented to senior management of the \nMinistry  of  Finance  and  Planning  (MOFP)  at  a  workshop  in  January  2004  and  chaired  by  the \nsecretary to the treasury (para. 55). \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n \nA. \n \n44. \nADB  together  with  IMF  had  been  supporting  the  previous  Government\u2019s  fiscal \nframework,  in  particular,  the  implementation  of  public  resource  and  expenditure  management \nreforms  under  the  erstwhile  Regaining  Sri  Lanka.  (See  Appendix  3  for  the  list  of  background \nstudies  and  chronology  of  events  in  the  processing  of  the  FMRP.)  The  FMRP  builds  on  this \ninitial  support  and  following  two  rounds  of  intensive  policy  dialogue  with  the  new  Government \nhas  amended  the  FMRP  in  line  with  the  new  Government\u2019s  fiscal  management  priorities.  In \nsummary, the revisions reflect primarily a stronger focus on revenue augmentation efforts, and a \nprioritization on fiscal consolidation consistent with enhanced capital spending. \n \n45. \nThe  proposed  ADB  assistance  is  to  comprise  a  program  (policy)  loan  component \ntargeting  critical  policy  measures  in  support  of  fiscal  management  reforms,  a  project  loan  in \nsupport of institutional strengthening focusing on establishing the MRA, and another project loan \nin  support  of  capacity  building  to  assist  in  the  implementation  of  policy  and  institutional \nstrengthening  components  of  the  fiscal  management  institutions.  The  FMRP  will  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s reform agenda and provide, in particular, support for fiscal consolidation through \nassistance  for  improving  public  resource  and  expenditure  management  systems,  promoting \nfiscal  discipline,  and  supporting  fiscal  decentralization.  More  generally,  the  FMRP  will  help \ncreate an enabling environment to foster mobilization of tax revenues, improve effectiveness of \npublic expenditures and, ultimately, place public finances on a sustainable path. \n \nB. \n \n\nProgram Loan \n\nObjectives \n\n1. \n \nThe  FMRP  will  seek  to  strengthen  public  finances  by  improving  resource  and \nfiscal \n\nfiscal  discipline,  and  supporting \n\n46. \nexpenditure  management  systems,  promoting \ndecentralization. \n \n\nGoals and Outputs \n\n2. \n \n47. \nThe FMRP has five goals: (i) improving effectiveness of tax administration, (ii) improving \nthe  budget  framework,  (iii) improving  public  expenditure  management  and  control  systems, \n(iv) strengthening fiscal discipline, and (v) improving fiscal coordination including supporting the \ngroundwork for fiscal decentralization.  \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\n48. \nA list of policy recommendations has been identified with the purpose of addressing the \nsector  constraints  identified  above.  The  set  of  time-bound  policy  actions  proposed  under  the \nFMRP  and  the  development  policy  letter  are  in  Appendix  4.  The  FMRP  framework  is  in \nAppendix 5. \n \n\nThe  program  loan  (policy  component)  focuses  on  key  measures  for  improved  fiscal \n\n3. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions  \n\n \n49. \nmanagement and sustainable compliance with fiscal objectives. \n \n\na. \n\nImproving Effectiveness of Tax Administration \n\ni. \n\nCreation of a Modernized Revenue Administration   \n\nthe  Revenue  Board  and \n\nthe  Government.  Nevertheless, \n\n \n50. \nTo address the fragmented and compartmentalized nature of the revenue administration, \nthe  Program  will  set  the  foundations  for  the  reorganization  of  the  three  departments  under  a \nunified Revenue Board. The Revenue Board will be established based on three key principles of \nmoving  toward  greater  operational  autonomy,  coordinating  better  the  core  common  functions, \nand creating the basis for a merit-based employment policy. Based on the performance of the \nreforms, the Government will review the prospects of deeper integration toward the end of the \nFMRP. \n  \n51.  Moving toward greater operational autonomy\u2014or government delegation of the powers \nto  ensure  effective  revenue  collection\u2014will  shield  the  revenue  administration  from  political  or \nother vested interests and, accordingly, represents an important step forward. Full autonomy is \nnot being pursued under the FMRP, as the revenue administration will continue to be financially \ndependent  on \nthe  revenue \nadministration in general will follow best practices on transparency and accountability as part of \nincreased  autonomy.  This  would  include  strengthening  reporting  requirements  and  greater \naccountability to Parliament and to the public. \n \nLimited  resources  and  a  host  of  separately  managed,  common  functions  across  inland \n52. \nrevenue,  customs  and  excise  departments  underline  the  need  for  functional  integration.  As  a \nfirst  step,  the  FMRP  will  support  common  IT  and  human  resource  development  programs \nacross  revenue  departments.  There  will  also  be  a  coordinated  effort  to  introduce  common \nstandards  across  tax  collection  and  accounts,  taxpayer  services,  tax  audit  and  investigation, \nlegal services, inspection, and training. \n \n53. \nUltimately,  functional  integration  requires  a  revamping  of  employment  policies.  The \nFMRP  sets  in  practice  a  thrust  toward  staff  specialization,  which  will  facilitate  longer-term \nfunctional integration. Staff specialization, in turn, will require a change in mindset, opening up \ngreater  opportunities  for  those  who  are  willing  to  take  on  this  challenge.  Certainly,  not  all  will \nstand  to  benefit  and  this  will  require  political  will  to  usher  in  new  policies  based  on  a \nis \ncompetency-acquired  and  merit-based  employment  system.  However,  specialization \nconsidered  a  necessary  policy  direction  in  support  of  the  modernization  of  the  revenue \nadministration and will form part of creating better incentives for workers who will be endowed \nwith the training needed to improve performance. \n \n54. \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  this  undertaking  and  is  aware  that  the  three  key \nprinciples outlined above are an integral part of the institutional reform process. Any piecemeal \n\n\f \n\n  13\n\napproach consisting of the adoption of any one of these principles without the others is bound to \ncall  into  question  the  likely  success  of  the  reform  process.  The  Cabinet,  in  one  of  its  first \neconomic  policy  decisions,  approved  a  memorandum  on  3  June  2004  supporting  the \nmodernization  of  the  department  of  inland  revenue,  including  its  restructuring,  thereby  setting \nthe stage for the transformation of the revenue administration. \n \n55. \nThe  creation  of  a  modernized  revenue  administration  will  take  time.  Capacity  building \nand  procurement  of  key  IT  components  will  promote  a  gradual  and  effective  modernization \nreform  program  of  the  revenue  administration.  A  key  design  feature  of  the  FMRP  is  its \ncommitment  to  avoiding  disruptions  to  tax  revenue  collection.  Some  of  the  more  critical \nintermediate  steps  identified  in  the  modernization  program  for  the  revenue  administration \ninclude:  (i)  the  establishment  of  the  Revenue  Board;  (ii)  the  appointment  of  a  CEO;  (iii)  the \ndesign  and  approval  of  modernization  strategies  for  the  different  arms  of  the  authority  inland \nrevenue,  customs,  and  excise  departments;  and  (iv)  the  design  and  approval  of  strategies  for \nhuman resource development and an integrated IT plan. (See Appendix 6 for a plan of activities \nor  task  list  to  support  the  modernization  program  of  the  revenue  administration.)  IMF  had \nprepared  drafts  under  (iii) above  and  the  Strengthening  of  Fiscal  Management  Institutions \nproject loan will support (iv) among others. \n \n\nii. \n\nStrengthening Tax Collection and Compliance \n\n \n56. \nTo complement effective tax administration, the FMRP seeks to strengthen tax collection \nand tax compliance. To begin, the tax net will be broadened. This will involve implementing the \nEconomic Service Charge, removing income tax exemptions on nongovernment salaries of civil \nservants (paras. 87\u201388 below), and rationalizing the use of tax holidays on investment. \n \n57. \nIn addition to widening the tax net, MOFP will establish a central accounts database that \nprovides  a  uniform  system  of  numbering  and  the  ability  to  cross  check  related  taxpayer \ntransaction  and  revenue  information.  Furthermore,  MOFP  will  approve  clear  regulations \nestablishing a unique and unified taxpayer identification number (TIN). While there is a TIN in \nplace  it  suffers  from  various  deficiencies,  which  undermines  its  effectiveness.  First,  it  is  not \ncompulsory.  Second,  it  is  not  unified  across  revenue  departments.  Third,  some  taxpayers  are \nthought  to  have  multiple  TINs.  The  new  TIN  will  be  designed  to  address  these  issues  and \nthereby  serve  as  a  critical  instrument  in  monitoring  compliance  of  tax  payments  and  facilitate \ntargeted enforcement. As part of this process, the tax registry will need to be strengthened, as \nthe  current  system  requires  updating,  with  particular  attention  to  cleaning  out  defunct  and \nmultiple name taxpayers. \n \n58. \nHowever, effective tax compliance will require persuasive enforcement on the part of the \nrevenue  administration  and  complementary  institutions.  Accordingly,  it  is  expected  that  by  the \nend of the FMRP the TIN will be used in a comprehensive manner and required in day-to-day \nactivities such as opening a bank account and purchasing property. To strengthen enforcement, \nthe  FMRP  will  also  support  the  development  of  a  central  accounts  database  for  tax  collection \npurposes and linked to the TIN. \n \n59. \nInternational experience suggests that investing in taxpayer services goes a long way in \nincreasing  tax  revenues.  The  modernization  of  the  revenue  administration  will  include  the \ncreation of a new Taxpayer Service and Education Department. The move toward considering \ntaxpayers as clients is part of this change in focus of the new revenue administration. Education \nof clients in taxpayer filing and other essential services are also being integrated into the reform \nprogram.  To  ensure  that  taxpayer  or  client  rights  are  being  ensured,  the  FMRP  also  calls  for \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nMOFP  to  prepare  and  approve  a  Taxpayer  Bill  of  Rights  and  Duties.  Along  these  lines,  the \nFMRP also supports the appointment of a tax ombudsperson to oversee and uphold taxpayer \n(client) rights. \n \nIn  order  to  enhance  tax  collection  and  compliance,  reporting  requirements  are  to  be \n60. \nstrengthened  in  the  Large  Taxpayer  Unit  (LTU).  The  LTU  covers  about  1,300  companies  and \naccounts for 85% of corporate tax revenues in Sri Lanka. Increasing reporting requirements will \nallow for greater compliance and can serve as a monitoring mechanism by the MRA to assess \ncompliance across companies. As a means of facilitating efficient processing of tax files, and in \norder to set the foundations of the management information system (MIS), the FMRP supports \nmoving toward a fully electronic tax filing system by companies registered under LTU by 2006. \n \nIn  addition,  as  part  of  the  improved  systems  and  procedures  specifically  related  to \n61. \nstreamlining  processing  and  reporting  requirements,  the  FMRP  will  see  to  it  that  the  LTU \nappoints individual account managers across all targets for the largest 1,000 taxpayers. These \nindividual  account  managers  will  be  responsible  for  all  tax  administration  services  for  each \nparticular  taxpayer,  equivalent  to  establishing  an  individualized  one-stop  taxpayer-servicing \noutlet. Finally, the Government also commits under the FMRP to revise the tax code in order to \nconsolidate all revisions under an updated and user-friendly, single reference instrument. \n \n\nb. \n\nImproving the Budget Framework \n\n \n\n \n\ni. \n\nStreamlining Budgeting Procedures \n\nSri  Lanka  operates  a  traditional,  centralized,  and  compliance-based  budget  system.  A \n62. \nset of policy objectives is determined at the beginning of the cycle. Subsequently, and following \na process of review where sector spending limits are set based on an expenditure framework, \nresources are committed to the spending agencies to meet these objectives. Budget execution \nfollows, with ensuing disbursements based on agreed-on appropriations. Finally, rudimentary ex \npost monitoring takes place with limited accountability for the implementation of line ministries\u2019 \nprograms. (See Supplementary Appendix 9 for a summary of the national budget process.) \n \nAmbiguities  in  the  established  budget  classification  system  together  with  difficulties  in \n63. \nenforcing hard budget constraints on spending agencies translate into limited ability to manage \nexpenditure  plans.  To  make  matters  worse,  actual  expenditures  are  not  always  in  line  with \napproved  budgets  and  the  flexibility  needed  to  adjust  fiscal  aggregates  is  not  in  place.  In \naddition, forward expenditure estimates seldom go beyond 1 year. Under the FMRP, MOFP is \nintroducing  an  internationally  accepted  budget  classification  system  and  is  implementing \neffective expenditure ceilings to strengthen budget management. (See Supplementary Appendix \n10  for  a  summary  of  the  budget  classification  system.)  In  addition,  through  ADB  technical \nassistance  (TA),8  MOFP  introduced  in  the  2004  budget  3-year  rolling  forward  estimates  of \ncurrent  and  capital  budgets  based  on  a  medium-term  budget  programming  and  expenditure \nframework. \n \nOther reforms under the FMRP will include amending the budget circular by fixing a firm \n64. \ndate for its issuance to ensure ample time for budget preparation and so avoid the disturbances \nrelated  to  a  relatively  tight  budget  calendar.  Similarly,  to  enhance  intra-year  budgeting \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB.  2003.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  Strengthening  Public \nExpenditure Management Systems. Manila (TA 3301-SRI, which commenced in January 2000 and was finalized in \nJuly 2003). \n\n\f \n\n  15\n\nadjustments  and  improve  timely  delivery  of  resources,  a  transparent  supplementary  budget \nappropriations  system  will  be  developed  to  reduce  the  ad  hoc  nature  of  adjustments.  The \nsystem will be complemented with timely reporting requirements. \n \nFurther  reforms  under  the  FMRP  include  establishing  guidelines  for  use  of  advance \n65. \naccounts  and  unifying  capital  and  current  budget  procedures.  These  measures  will  serve  to \nimprove  budget  management  and  overall  efficiency,  given  common  linkages  between  the  two \nsets of procedures. \n \n66. \nA  review  of  the  budget  preparation  process  suggests  the  need  to  strengthen  certain \naspects linked to integration and coordination of budget estimates. In particular, on the capital \nexpenditures  side,  policy  and  implementation  activities  need  to  be  more  closely  integrated.9 \nIndeed,  in  the  recent  past,  while  the  National  Planning  Department  was  responsible  for \nidentifying capital expenditure ceilings across line ministries, Regaining Sri Lanka provided the \npolicy framework for identification of capital spending requirements. Moreover the Regaining Sri \nLanka committees were, in turn, responsible for recommending and monitoring implementation \nof investment projects, calling into question the involvement of line ministries and the National \nPlanning  Department.  Following  the  election  of  the  new  Government,  the  responsibility  for \nprioritization of core expenditures has been removed from the committees and returned to the \ncentral ministries in coordination with the line ministries. \n \n67. \nIn addition, as part of budget management reforms over the medium-term, the FMRP is \nsetting  out  preliminary  actions  supporting  a  reorientation  toward  results-based  budgeting.  The \nkey  is  to  move  gradually  from  a  budget  management  system  that  focuses  on  inputs  and  how \nthey  are  employed  to  focusing  on  outputs  and  eventually  outcomes  and  how  they  fulfill  their \noriginal  budget  objectives.  This  phased  approach  recognizes  that  compliance-based  systems \ntend to face complex restrictions that diminish the allocative and operational efficiency of budget \nexecution. In addition, accountability tends to be limited in terms of program results. Under the \nFMRP,  MOFP  will  establish  a  working  group  or  committee  to  oversee  the  change  toward  a \nsystem  that  introduces  elements  of  results-based  budgeting.  Indeed,  MOFP  has  already \nintroduced  in  the  2004  budget  circular  performance  indicators  at  the  central  government  level \nfor the purpose of moving toward results-based budgeting reporting. A move toward a results-\nbased  budgeting  system  in  fact  could  lead  to  fiscal  stabilization  objectives  that  complement, \nrather than compete with, efficiency objectives. However, this transformation in Sri Lanka needs \ntime,  and  the  compliance-oriented  systems  and  the  use  of  expenditure  controls  are  still \nexpected to prevail over the medium term. \n \n\nii. \n\nRationalizing Expenditures \n\n \n68. \nAs part of the Government\u2019s structural reform initiatives in support of rationalizing public \nresources,  MOFP  has  issued  a  circular  requesting  all  ministries  to  submit  restructuring  plans. \nThe  FMRP  will  provide  continuity  to  this  initiative  by  supporting  restructuring  plans  for  key \nministries  and  the  Western  Province  provincial  council.  The  restructuring  plans  will  include \nidentification  of  activities  classified  according  to  priority  goals  to  support  the  mandate  of  the \nparticular ministry and the required inputs to meet those activities. Savings are to be identified \nfrom  cost-cutting  measures  with  a  particular  focus  on  reducing  overlap  across  the sector,  and \nthese  may  be  allocated  to  other  priority  areas  in  the  ministry.  On  a  pilot  basis,  the  Western \nProvince provincial council will undertake a similar restructuring exercise with a view to possible \n\n                                                 \n9  According to the World Bank\u2019s 1998 Public Expenditure Management Handbook, the failure to link policy making, \n\nplanning, and budgeting may be the single most important factor contributing to poor budgeting outcomes. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n  \n\nreplication  in  other  PCs.  These  restructuring  plans  should  be  fully  implemented  by  the  end  of \nthe FMRP. \n \n\nc. \n\nImproving Public Expenditure Management and Control Systems \n\ni. \n\nStrengthening Management of Off-Budget Expenditures and \nBorrowings \n\n \n69.  With  increased  fiscal  pressures,  many  countries  have  turned  to  off-budget  financing \nthrough contingent and implicit liabilities as a means of deferring the recognition of committed \ncash expenditures. Conventional budget methodologies tend to ignore the proper accounting of \ncontingent  liabilities  except  when  a  cash  flow  is  created.  As  a  result,  financial  accounting \nsystems generate insufficient data for adequate budgetary control of such policies. \n \n70. \nThe  FMRP  will  focus  on  putting  in  place  the  required  fiscal  accounting  framework  to \nadequately address budget and off-budget expenditures and borrowings both on a cash and an \naccruals  basis  (on  the  latter,  see  para.  79).  To  begin  with,  MOFP  will  prepare  guidelines  for \nproper  classification  of  off-budget  liabilities  as  actual  or  contingent.  Second,  MOFP  is  to \nundertake actuarial balance analyses of the greatest sources of contingent liabilities, including \nboth government, i.e., social security and pension10 funds, and parastatal agencies, i.e., Ceylon \nElectricity  Board  and  Ceylon  Petroleum  Corporation.  Finally,  MOFP  is  to  prepare  a  feasibility \nstudy  on  funding  and  liquidating  government  liabilities  through  the  eventual  creation  of  a \nprovisioning fund. \n \nThe  Government  also  operates  various  statutory  and  nonstatutory  special  funds.  Many \n71. \nof these funds are permitted to raise revenues and spend outside the budgeting process. These \ninclude  (i) the  President\u2019s  Special  Fund  of  SLRs40 million\u201350 million  financed  by  the  national \nlottery,  (ii) the  Cess  Fund  of  SLRs800 million  funded  by  a  levy  on  tea,  and  (iii) the  Customs \nReward Fund funded by fines and sales proceeds. Two issues arise. First, from the perspective \nof budgetary program and planning, unless the funds are properly accounted for in the budget,11 \nefficient use of resources is compromised. Second, unless these funds are subject to published \nannual  audits  and  other  performance  reporting,  there  is  limited  public  accountability  of  the \nmeans  and  use  of  these  funds.  Under  the  FMRP,  the  Government  commits  to  preparing  an \nexhaustive  inventory  of  the  existing,  operating  funds  and  publishing  performance-reporting \nsystems. Under the FMRP,  measures will be introduced to take stock of the magnitude of the \nproblem,  adopt  guidelines  to  prevent  further  build-up  of  off-budget  liabilities  on  nonstatutory \nfunds and, finally, initiate measures to liquidate these liabilities. \n \n\nii. \n\nImproving Budgetary Cash and Asset Management Systems \n\n \nPoor  cash  management  results  in  the  tying  up  of  scarce  resources  for  unnecessarily \n72. \nlong  periods  of  time.  This  may  translate  into  costly  delays  of  public  projects  through  deferred \ncompletion  dates  or,  in  extreme  circumstances,  may  lead  to  costly  overdrafts  or  even  bridge \nfinancing  arrangements.  Under  the  FMRP,  MOFP  will  introduce  a  budgetary  allotment  system \nacross the budget year to synchronize with treasury receipts including transfers to other levels \nof government, and thereby minimize cash deferrals. \n \n\n                                                 \n10 According to Regaining Sri Lanka, there is an unfunded pension liability of approximately SLRs550 billion, which is \n\nincreasing due to a rapidly aging population.  \n\n11 A list of 31 such funds was provided by MOF but without details of amounts raised and disbursed. \n\n\f \n\n  17\n\nThe introduction of a computerized and fully integrated Public Accounting and Financial \n73. \nManagement  Information  System  (PAFMIS)\u2014to  include  (i) payroll,  (ii) civil  service  pensions, \n(iii) drawing and  disbursing  offices,  (iv) capital  projects  budget,  and  (v) public sector borrowing \nrequirements\u2014will  be  critical  to  improve  expenditure  management.  The  World  Bank  and  the \nGovernment  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  are  providing  complementary  support  to  public \nexpenditure  management.  The  World  Bank  is  supporting  the  public  expenditure  review  (PER) \nexercise with a view to prioritizing the Government\u2019s expenditure objectives across key sectors. \nThe Government of the Republic of Korea has had discussions on providing a credit line to the \nGovernment for the procurement of a PAFMIS. The FMRP will support the eventual integration \nof  the  PAFMIS  with  the  proposed  Revenue  Administration  Management  Information  System \n(RAMIS). \n \nThe  current  cash  management  system  also  adversely  affects  disbursement  ratios  for \n74. \nforeign  aid projects,  as  counterpart  funds  are  unavailable  or  available  with  significant  lags.  To \nimprove disbursement ratios, the National Budget Department along with the External Resource \nDepartment  and  the  State  Accounts  Department  will  create  an  MIS  to  link  foreign  aid-related \ngovernment counterpart funds to budget implementation. This will include commitments, warrant \nrequests, and release of funds. \n \n75. \nFinally,  in  order  to  strengthen  management  of  government  income  streams,  the  State \nAccounts Department will develop an asset management system to support the monitoring and \nrecovery of government onlending activities. \n \n\nd. \n\nStrengthening Fiscal Discipline \n\ni. \n\nImproving Budget Estimates \n\n \n76. \nAs an important step to fiscal discipline, the new Government has established a Fiscal \nPolicy Committee under the leadership of the secretary to the treasury, which should provide an \nimportant source of discipline to budget design, preparation, execution, and monitoring. \n \n77. \nHowever,  the  critical  issue  is  the  need  to  strengthen  the  process  for  the  planning  and \npreparation  of  the  budget.  In  the  past,  inputs  have  been  provided  by  the  Fiscal  Policy \nDepartment, National Budget Department, CBSL, and the revenue administration. However, the \nprocess was rather fragmented, lacking effective coordination and limiting the interaction, thus \nstraining  efforts  to  achieve  consensus.  Often  the  pressure  fell  on  the  revenue  administration, \nwhich tended to have its initial revenue estimates raised given the assumptions underlying the \neconomy. Accordingly, budget outturns often missed budget estimates, resulting in difficulties in \nachieving fiscal targets (para. 83). The FMRP will support effective coordination by establishing \na budget preparation consulting process, gathering all of the relevant MOFP departments and \nrevenue  administrations  to  discuss  and  reach  agreement  on  realistic  and  credible  annual  and \nmedium-term revenue estimates. \n \n78. \nTo improve budget estimates, MOFP will also need to properly account for items that are \ncurrently off the budget. Under the FMRP, MOFP will build on actions under section 3.a. above \nto  assist  State  Accounts  Department  to  (i) develop  guidelines  and  reporting  procedures  to \nmonitor all commitments accumulated by government departments, (ii) prepare and update the \nregistrar  on  such  commitments,  and  (iii) publish  the  commitment  details  on  the  Government\u2019s \nweb site. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nAnother  key  government  policy  involves  moving  current  cash-based  government \n79. \naccounting  procedures  toward  an  accrual-based  accounting  system  by  2008.  As  part  of  this \nbroad objective, the Government, supported by FMRP, has agreed to integrate accruals-based \naccounting systems on government accounts for (i) movable government assets and (ii) the net \npositions of public enterprises. \n \n80. \nFinally,  extending  earlier  work  initiated  under  the  Public  Expenditure  Management \nSystems project, a key policy action will involve deepening the expenditure ceilings framework. \nThis will consist of improving the determination of ceilings based on a more rigorous analysis of \nexpenditure priorities. Assumptions and scenarios underlying the establishment of such ceilings \nwill be prepared in conjunction with the treasury\u2019s Economic Policy Research Department and \nwith a closer link to the macroeconomic program and the CBSL. In addition, the Government is \nestablishing  a  commitment  monitoring  system  in  the  National  Budget  Department  to  begin  in \n2005 to improve budget planning and management. \n \n\nii. \n\nIncreasing  Fiscal  Transparency  through  Improved  Reporting \nProcedures \n\nto \n\nfall \n\nKey \n\nfiscal \n\ntransparency  and  parliamentary  oversight  responsibilities \n\n \n81. \nThe  latest  IMF  Report  on  the  Observance  of  Standards  and  Codes  on  fiscal \ntransparency in Sri Lanka highlights achievements, including a reasonably well-developed legal \nand  administrative  framework  for  fiscal  management  and  the  publication  of  comprehensive \nfiscal  accounts.  However,  areas  that  need  strengthening  remain,  including  systematic \naccounting of off-budget liabilities, parliamentary oversight, and audit. \n \nthe \n82. \nGovernment  by  virtue  of  the  recent  Fiscal  Management  (Responsibility)  Act  (and  according  to \nobjectives  highlighted  in  para.  22  above).  In  particular,  under  the  Act,  the  Government  will \nprepare  a  fiscal  strategy  statement,  increase  public  awareness  of  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal \npolicy, and establish standards for evaluating the Government\u2019s conduct of its fiscal strategy. In \naddition,  MOFP  will  be  responsible  for  presenting  in  Parliament  a  budget  economic  and  fiscal \nposition report. The report will set out the Government\u2019s fiscal performance and key estimates \nand assumptions on fiscal accounts for the current and 2 succeeding fiscal years. An additional \nmidyear  fiscal  position  report  will  be  prepared  by  the  Minister  of  Finance  to  explain  any \ndeviations  from  stated  fiscal  objectives.  To  date,  reporting  requirements  have  been  fully \ncomplied with, including the presentation of the Preelection Budgetary Position Report in March \n2004. \n \n83. \nRealistic  revenue  targets  are  critical  to  strengthen  the  Government\u2019s  perceived \ncredibility,  especially  in  view  of  the  Fiscal  Management  (Responsibility)  Act.  However,  in \naddition to realistic revenue estimates, expenditure ceilings will also need to be tightly enforced. \nIndeed  over  the  latest  period  for  which  data  are  available,  1999\u20132001,  the  average  budget \noutturn as a share of the original estimate was 89% for revenue, 103% for current expenditure, \nand  71%  for  capital  expenditure.  To  ensure  greater  discipline  and  maintain  expenditures  on \ntarget,  MOFP  has  started  publishing  on  its  web  site  bulletins  of  monthly  expenditures  and \nrevenues, which track flows according to different classifications and over time. Subjecting the \nGovernment\u2019s public spending and revenue collection programs to public scrutiny is expected to \nraise general awareness and further enhance budget discipline. \n \nUnder the FMRP (as part of the assurances), MOFP will be required to achieve a high \n84. \ndegree of transparency in the reporting of contingent and implicit liabilities with the objective of \nstrengthening  coverage  in  the  Government\u2019s  half-yearly  statements.  More  specifically,  MOFP \n\n\f \n\n  19\n\nImproved \n\nwill  report  on  the  general  Government\u2019s  financial  position,  both  on-  and  off-budget  items, \nincluding commitments, guarantees, and contingent liabilities. Along these lines, the FMRP will \nsupport initiatives so as to quantify the total value of off-budget expenditure and borrowing and \npropose  means  to  (i) increase  financial  disclosure  of  off-budget  expenditure  and  borrowing, \n(ii) transform such expenditure to on-budget items, and (iii) reduce possible distortions resulting \nfrom the modalities of off-budget expenditure and borrowing. \n \n85. \nfiscal  discipline. \nis  a  necessary  condition \nAccordingly, the Government will continue its commitment to improve reporting requirements. In \naddition  to  the  publication  of  monthly  expenditure  and  revenue  accounts,  the  Government  will \nbegin publishing (i) results-based reporting standards including the auditing of all ministries with \nbudgetary  commitments  on  an  annual  basis,  and  (ii) annual  departmental  accounts  within  a \nspecified  time  frame  by  2005.  An  important  reform  in  this  area  is  the  preparation  of  a \ncompendium  of  all  treasury  circulars  for  easy  reference,  which  is  to  be  made  available  as \noperations manuals for treasury officers. A more abbreviated version will also be made available \nto the public on the Government\u2019s web site. \n \n\ntransparency \n\nfor  effective \n\niii. \n\nReducing Distortions \n\n \n86. \nPast practices of granting exemptions to tax evaders has created moral hazard among \ntaxpayers  and  generated  deep  misgivings  among  potential  future  tax  defaulters  about  coming \nclean and among honest taxpayers who feel cheated due to government leniency. Another set \nof  distortions  arises  from  the  Government\u2019s  involvement  in  directing  tax  exemptions  through \nincome  tax  holidays  and  other  misguided  BOI  incentive  schemes  to  selected  sectors  of  the \neconomy,  a  strategy  that  according  to  empirical  evidence  does  not  lead  to  the  intended \nobjectives  of  promoting  sustainable  investment.  According  to  Regaining  Sri  Lanka,  the \nestimated  revenue  losses  from  various  BOI  tax  concessions  amounted  to  2\u20133%  of  GDP \nannually. The FMRP will require the Government to halt these practices throughout the course \nof the FMRP (and beyond) and serve to create a level playing field for all eligible taxpayers (see \nAssurances, below). \n \n87. \nSimilarly, civil servants benefit from income tax exemption  on their earned government \nincome. This is clearly a second best (or non-optimal) policy. While a policy of moving toward \nincreasing gross income and taxing the resulting income could result in resource equivalence on \nthe  state  accounts,  it  could  lead  to  positive  externalities.  In  particular,  greater  awareness  of \ntaxation issues among the population and overall  improved tax education resulting from these \nmeasures  could  improve  compliance  among  taxpayers.  In  addition,  equity  concerns  between \ntaxpayers and tax-exempt individuals would be smoothed, likely reducing tax-evasion behavior \nand  supporting  a  wider  tax  net.  Finally,  taxing  civil  service  income  would  increase  the  policy \ninstruments available to the Government to pursue income distribution measures. \n \n88.  More generally, tax exemption on civil service employment income cannot correct for a \ncivil  service  that  is  unable  to  match  salaries  in  the  private  sector.  Public  sector  employment \nreform is hence essential in terms of overcoming a binding constraint to economic growth and \nensuring  the  flexibility  needed  to  adjust  to  a  changing  economy.  Accordingly,  the  previous \nGovernment had introduced a requirement that all government employees be subject to income \ntax  on  their  nongovernment  incomes.  In  the  maiden  2005  budget,  the  Government  has  made \nthe provisions for all civil servants to be liable for a PAYE coming into effect in 2005. However, \nto  reduce  opposition  to  this  reform,  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  has  accompanied  this \nmeasure  by  including  a  substantial  civil  service  pay  increase  and  a  reprieve  on  PAYE,  as \nincome will be (initially) assumed to be half of the gross salary.  \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\ne. \n\nImproving Fiscal Coordination \n\ni. \n\nStrengthening Fiscal and Macroeconomic Coordination \n\n \n89. \nFollowing the slippages in the fiscal deficit targets for 2004, the Government is expected \nto  start  anew  on  a  fiscal  consolidation  strategy  based  on  well-defined  fiscal  objectives  and \nthereby  adhere  to  the  principles  under  the  Fiscal  Management  (Responsibility)  Act  (Appendix \n2). The strategy recognizes the importance of unwinding domestic imbalances built up over the \nyears by containing fiscal deficits and reducing public debt. The adoption and implementation of \nclear  objectives  under  the  Act  is  an  example  of  the  benefits  of  strengthened  macroeconomic \nand  fiscal  coordination  and  acknowledges  the  importance  of  fiscal  consolidation  as  part  of \noverall macroeconomic stabilization and sustainable GDP growth. \n \n90. \nIn  parallel,  and  as  part  of  greater  integration  of  relevant  departments  in  support  of \neffective  budgeting  at  the  operational  level,  the  Government  has  mobilized  senior  National \nPlanning  Department  officials  to  work  with  the  National  Budget  Department.  The  National \nPlanning  Department  has  been  strengthened  through  recruitment  of  specialists  and  is  now \nassigned  the  responsibilities  of  formulating  a  broad  public  investment  plan  consistent  with  the \nmedium-term budget programming and expenditure framework. This should lead to an improved \narticulation of government policy priorities on the expenditure side by better aligning current and \ncapital  expenditure  requirements.  The  Government\u2019s  commitment \nincreasing  public \ninvestment underscores the need for these reforms, particularly in the elaboration of the public \ninvestment  program.  On  debt  management,  the  Government  has  decided  to  adopt  a  more \ngradual approach to creating an independent public debt management office. Accordingly, the \nGovernment  will  support  the  preparation  of  a  feasibility  study  to  review  the  merits  of  an \nindependent  public  debt  management  office.  In  the  meantime,  work  will  commence  on \ndeveloping a monitoring system for foreign and domestic liability management. \n \n91. \nOther  measures  to  improve  fiscal  coordination  will  involve  developing  a  web-based \nintegrated aid MIS, which is already in preparation with bilateral support from the Government of \nNorway.  This  system  will  serve  to  better  monitor  and  track  implementation  of  development \nassistance  projects  and  will  be  linked  to  the  proposed  PAFMIS  to  improve  realization  of \nbudgeted disbursement targets, thereby improving performance of foreign assistance. \n \n\nto \n\nii. \n\nStrengthening Fiscal Decentralization \n\n \n92. \nConsolidation  of  the  peace  process  is  likely  to  be  closely  linked  to  progress  in \nstrengthening  subnational  governments.  This  will  inevitably  require  public  finances  to  be \nrestructured to accommodate these changes. While the exact nature of any future change to the \nfederal  structure  of  government  has  yet  to  be  defined,  there  are\u2014even  at  this  early  stage\u2014 \nwelfare-enhancing  actions  in  support  of  fiscal  decentralization  that  can  be  pursued  by  sub-\nnational  governments  independently  of  the  chosen  federal  structure.  While  fiscal  stress  has \ndampened \nfurther \ndecentralization.  More  importantly,  the  nature  of  the  reforms  suggested  under  the  FMRP \nessentially aims to bridge the gap between sanctioned devolution and the actual state of affairs. \n \nUnder  the  13th  amendment  of  the  Constitution,  introduced  in  1987,  the  powers  to  be \n93. \ndevolved from the center to the provinces, via PCs, were clearly defined according to subject. \nThe underlying principle for devolution consists of the assignment of expenditure, revenues, and \ntransfers  from  the  central  government  to  the  PCs.  However,  to  date,  these  powers  have  not \n\nit  should  not  be  considered  an \n\nfiscal  devolution \n\nimpediment \n\nto \n\n\f \n\n  21\n\nbeen  fully  devolved.  Moreover,  neither  the  promotion  of  self-sufficiency  at  subnational \ngovernment level or efficiency at all government levels through the system of intergovernment \ntransfers was among the principles pursued in the 13th amendment. Many of the PCs have not \nfollowed  through  in  approving  the  statutes  for  levying  the  relevant  devolved  taxes,  resulting  in \ndependency on the center. Average total revenue as a share of total expenditure across PCs in \n1998\u20132000  is  estimated  at  18%.  The  current  situation  has  thus  given  the  central  Government \nand  line  ministries  the  rationale  to  maintain  their  presence  and  involvement  in  devolved \nsubjects, thereby fostering duplication of functions across various areas. \n \n94. \nDeficiencies  in  the  current  arrangements  are  numerous.  The  Finance  Commission  as \nthe  main  arbiter  in  center-province  financial  relations  is  entrusted  with  overseeing  the \nimplementation  of  fiscal  devolution.  However,  until  recently,  it  met  only  occasionally,  lacked \nfocused technical expertise (as four out of five budgeted positions were vacant), and had limited \naccountability  to  key  stakeholders.  Consequently,  the  FMRP  supported  appointing  a  full-time \nchairperson and secretary, filling the Finance Commission\u2019s vacancies, and vesting it with clear \nrules and procedures governing its responsibilities. \n \n95. \nSince the appointment of a new chairperson of the Finance Commission, there has been \nsignificant  progress  in  various  areas.  First,  the  Finance  Commission  has  been  restructured  in \nline with a larger operating budget. In addition, a new Finance Commission Act is in preparation, \nsupported  by  the  FMRP.  Finally,  a  Committee  for  Capacity  Building  in  Fiscal  Devolution  has \nbeen  established  and  is  meeting  regularly  to  identify  key  recommendations  under  a  United \nNations  Development  Programme  study  on  fiscal  decentralization  and  to  propose  that  the \nGovernment adopts these recommendations. \n \n96. \nThe Finance Commission is also responsible for defining the criteria for the set of central \ngovernment  transfers  to  the  PCs.  Despite  changing  circumstances,  the  criteria  have  not  been \nmodified since first introduced in 1989. Under  the FMRP, the Finance Commission will review \nthe  existing  criteria  and  report  on  the  appropriateness  of  the  current  arrangement  based  on \nprinciples  of  efficiency,  transparency,  simplicity,  equity,  and  predictability.  Criteria  such  as  the \ndegree  of  provincial \nincentives\u2014and  poverty \nfiscal  management\u2014to  better \nconsiderations\u2014to target poverty reduction and greater equity\u2014should be considered. \n \n97. \nAnother  important  step  in  the  devolution  of  revenue  and  expenditure  powers  from  the \ncenter to the provinces involves creating a more solid base for provincial revenues. Accordingly, \nthe FMRP recommends the identification of a defined tax that could either form the basis for the \ninitial  source  of  central  transfer  to  the  PCs  or  alternatively  result  in  the  actual  transfer  of  tax \ncollection responsibility to the PCs. \n \n98. \nOn the expenditure side, the PCs do not have full absorptive capacity to undertake the \nassigned expenditure provisions vested in them by the Constitution. In this context, the FMRP \nsupports  the  preparation  of  a  time-bound  implementation  plan  that  will  assess  the  capacity \nimprovements  needed  to  transfer  expenditure  responsibilities  in  selected  sectors  from  the \ncenter to the provinces, including education, health, and roads. \n  \n99. \nCertainly, PCs will need to be subject to increased scrutiny and accountability as greater \nexpenditure  and  revenue  powers  are  devolved  to  them.  The  FMRP  will  therefore  call  for  a \nredressing  of  any  potential  imbalance  between  authority  and  accountability  at  the  provincial \ngovernment  level,  through  the  publication  of  an  annual  performance  report  to  include \nachievements  with  regard  to  devolved  revenue  and  expenditure  powers  as  well  as  audited \nfinancial statements. \n\nrealign \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n100.  Surprisingly, federal fiscal policy dialogue has been characterized by the absence of an \ninstitutional  forum  where  government  leaders  from  the  two  levels  of  government  can  discuss \ninterprovincial  and  center-provincial  issues.  This  is  an  important  missing  link  in  the  current \ninstitutional  setup  as  in  any  federation,  the  process  of  coordination  is  as  important  as  the \ncoordination  itself.  The  FMRP  will  support  the  convening  of  high-level  and  working-level \nmeetings to oversee and implement agreements reached. The following items could be part of \nthe agenda of these meetings: (i) Finance Commission recommendations, (ii) means to reduce \nvertical and horizontal imbalances, and (iii) proposals to remove overlapping of responsibilities \nbetween central and provincial governments. \n \n101.  Finally,  and  in  recognition  of  the  central  Government\u2019s  prerogative  in  determining  the \npace of future devolution, the FMRP will support the preparation of studies that will provide the \nanalysis  and  technical  considerations  for  informed  decision-making.  The  first  study  would \nanalyze  the  scope  for  moving  toward  increased  devolution  of  capital  expenditures  to  the \nprovincial level. The fostering of provincial powers with regard to capital spending would, over \nthe  long  term,  assist  in  improving  income  generation  at  the  provincial  level  and  begin \naddressing  the  dependency  syndrome.  It  would  also  explore  the  scope  for  improved \nrealignment  of  incentives  by  moving  gradually  and,  when  recommended  by  the  Government, \nfrom pure grant financing to loan financing, in line with increased capacity at the provincial level. \n \n102.  The  second  study  would  analyze  ways  to  improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of \ndecentralized  expenditure  and  revenue  assignments.  As  part  of  the  integration  of  the  various \nactivities under the FMRP, it would also seek to integrate the center-provinces\u2019 revenue sharing \ninto  the  medium-term  budget  programming  and  expenditure  framework.  Last,  it  would  assess \nthe capacity building required to successfully accommodate greater fiscal decentralization and \naim to strengthen such capacity. \n \n\n4. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n103. \nIt is proposed that ADB support the Government\u2019s policy reforms through a policy loan of \n$45 million. The borrower will be the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. The loan will \nbe  from  the  OCR.  The  FMRP  loan  will  have  a  15-year  repayment  period  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility and a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum. (The \nfront-end fee of 1.0% is waived for public sector loans approved during 1 January 2004\u201330 June \n2005.) The Government will provide ADB with: (i) the reasons for the decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions;  and  (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision, not made in reliance on any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \n104.  The adjustment costs of the reforms under the FMRP are tentatively estimated at about \n$80 million and include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nRestructuring  of  MOFP  including  staffing  enhancements  and  preparation  of \nannual audits of key ministries ($5 million); \nMRA  project  including  development  of  the  electronic  direct  interface  program, \nrecruitment  of  a  CEO  and  additional  advisors  as  per  the  new  Revenue  Board \nstructure,  implementation  of  reforms  under  the  FMRP,  and  expenditure  on \ntraining including consulting services ($30 million); \nGovernment financing for the PAFMIS ($20 million); \n\n\f \n\n  23\n\nGovernment financing for the integrated aid MIS ($2 million); \nProcurement of customs container inspection equipment ($20 million); and \nStaffing and institutional strengthening of the Finance Commission ($3 million). \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\n5. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\na. \n\nProgram Management \n\n \n105.  MOFP  will  be  the  FMRP  Executing  Agency  (EA).  MOFP  will  set  up  an  interagency \nimplementation and coordination committee (IICC) headed by the secretary to the treasury and \ncomprising  representatives  from  the  Fiscal  Policy  Department,  National  Budget  Department, \nExternal Resource Department, National Planning Department, Public Enterprises Department, \nState Accounts Department, Revenue Board, CBSL, and Finance Commission. ADB will also be \na member of the IICC. The IICC will meet every quarter to monitor, coordinate, and ensure the \neffective  implementation  of  the  proposed  reforms  under  the  FMRP  and  will  assist  the  EA  in \nensuring successful completion of the FMRP. \n \n\nb. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\n \n106.  The implementation period is 3 years and is to be completed by December 2007. \n \n\nc. \n\nProcurement and Withdrawal Procedure \n\n \n107.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of items produced \nand procured in ADB member countries (other than items specified in the List of Ineligible Items \nincluded  in  Appendix  7)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  The \nGovernment  will  certify  that  the  volume  of  eligible  imports  exceeds  the  amount  of  ADB\u2019s \nprojected  disbursements  under  the  loan  for  the  given  period.  It  is  expected  that  the  loan \nproceeds  will  be  utilized  over  a  period  of  36  months  from  the  date  of loan  effectiveness.  ADB \nreserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  verify  the  accuracy  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  certification.  Loan  proceeds  may  be  used  to  finance  eligible  imports  for  which \nexpenditures were incurred 180 days before the FMRP loan becomes effective. \n \n\nd. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n \n108.  The Government will use the local currency funds generated by the FMRP loan to meet \nFMRP expenditures and associated costs of reform. \n \n\ne. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n\n \n109.  The loan will be released in three equal tranches of $15 million each. The first tranche is \nto be disbursed upon loan effectiveness and government compliance with all prior actions under \nthe  FMRP.  The  second  and  third  tranches  are  expected  to  be  released  within  18  and  36 \nmonths,  respectively,  from  the  release  of  the  first  tranche,  subject  to  satisfactory  compliance \nwith second and third tranche release conditions, respectively. Both the Government and ADB \nwill regularly and closely monitor FMRP implementation. (See Appendix 4 for the list of tranche \nrelease conditions.) \n \n\nf. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n110.  The IICC will establish and maintain a program performance monitoring system that will \ninclude a database on the status of policy measures and program indicators based on the policy \nmatrix. This will be linked with the projects\u2019 performance management systems (para. 132). The \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nIICC will benefit from the wealth of experience accumulated by MOFP over the years with ADB \nand other development partners in project management. \n \n\ng. \n\nProgram Review  \n\n \n111.  The Government and ADB will conduct a comprehensive midterm review at the end of \nyear 2 to evaluate the progress of the reform measures and their impact on fiscal management. \nIn  addition,  ADB  will  also  monitor  implementation  through  periodic  reviews  and  progress \nreports.  ADB  will  conduct  annual  reviews  throughout  the  implementation  period.  These  will \nassist in identifying further actions for continued improvements to fiscal management. \n \nC. \n \n\nProject Loans  \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\n \n112.  The  first  project  loan,  MRA,  will  promote  the  institutional  strengthening  of  the  three \nrevenue  departments  and  the  Finance  Commission  through  the  procurement  of  an  integrated \nRAMIS  and  ancillary  equipment,  respectively.  RAMIS  will,  in  turn,  link  with  the  IT  systems  for \nfinancial management in the areas of treasury, payment, expenditure, and budget progamming. \nThe second project, Strengthening of the Fiscal Management Institutions, will provide capacity-\nbuilding  support  for  institutional  development,  including  that  required  to  implement  the \nModernization  Program  for  the  Revenue  Administration  (Appendix  6).  This  would  comprise \npromoting  the  development  of  skills  and  know-how  of  officials  through  the  contracting  of \nexternal expertise and transfer of knowledge via training and workshops. (See Appendix 8 for a \ndescription  of  RAMIS  and  Appendix  9  for  the  terms  of  reference  for  the  capacity-building \ncomponent of the project loan.) \n \n\n2. \n\nFocus and Outputs \n\n \n\na. \n\nEnhancing the Revenue Administration \n\n \n\n \n\n113.  Automating the work place will be the driving force behind the modernization strategy of \nthe  revenue  administration  for  the  three  revenue  departments.  In  particular,  adopting  a  fully \nintegrated and comprehensive MIS will be critical to improve efficiency in revenue administration \nand  by  moving  toward  a  script-less  system  with  security  checks  rendering  it  less  prone  to \nabuse, and thereby assisting in rooting out circumspect practices of the past. The MRA project \nwill  therefore  contribute  to  integrating  the  tax  data  and  information  from  each  of  the  three \nrevenue  departments  and  the  BOI  into  a  common  platform.  Accordingly,  RAMIS  aims  to  help \nthe  revenue  departments  develop  an  electronic  organization  system  (also  known  as  \u201ce-\norganization\u201d) and ensure that the standard is maintained on an ongoing basis. (See component \n2 under terms of reference for the capacity building component of the project loan in Appendix 9 \nfor a more detailed description.) \n\n \n114.  Assistance will also be provided for procurement of computer hardware and software for \nthe Finance Commission.  \n \n\nb. \n\nStrengthening of the Fiscal Management Institutions \n\n \nInstitutional  development  of  the  revenue  departments  will  be  critical  for  effectively \n115. \nachieving the goals of the revenue modernization strategy. Foremost among the priorities will be \nthe  transformation  of  the  current  cadre  at  the  respective  tax  administrations  into  well-qualified \n\n\f \n\n  25\n\nexperts. This will imply establishing a balance between acquiring specialized technical expertise \nthat  adapts  international  best  practices  to  the  requirements  of  the  modernized  revenue \ndepartments,  on  the  one  hand,  and  building  expertise  through  training  and  working  alongside \ninternational  advisors  including  those  seconded  from  successful  revenue  collection  authorities \non the other (see component 3 under terms of reference for the capacity building component of \nthe project loan in Appendix 9 for a more detailed description). \n \n116.  Assistance  will  also  be  provided  to  support  institutional  development  in  the  Finance \nCommission  with  emphasis  on  MIS,  including  integration  and  linkages  across  relevant \nassociated institutions, and on skills development. \n\n \n3. \n \n\nItem \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n\n117.  The  total  cost  of  the  two  projects  is  estimated  at  $33.4 million  equivalent,  including \ncontingencies  and  financing  charges,  comprising  $22.4 million  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and \n$11 million equivalent in local currency costs. A summary of cost estimates is given in Table 1.  \n \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \nForeign \nExchange \n \n0.0 \n6.2 \n13.2 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n \n7.3 \n9.3 \n13.2 \n\n0.6 \n0.0 \n11.0 \n\n2.5 \n1.1 \n33.4 \n\n1.9 \n1.1 \n22.4 \n\n \n7.3 \n3.1 \n0.0 \n\n \nA.

The  two  project  loans  will  comprise:  (i) $15 million  from  OCR  for  the  MRA,  with  a \nmaturity period of 25 years including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  and  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per \nannum;  13  and  (ii) SDR  6,672,000 ($10 million  equivalent)  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund \n(ADF)  resources  for  Strengthening  of  the  Fiscal  Management  Institutions  and  will  have  a  32-\nyear  repayment  period,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  an  interest  charge  of  1.0% \nduring the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The borrower of the two project loans will be the \nDemocratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka.  The  Government  will  provide  ADB  with  (i) the \nreasons  for  the  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of \nthese terms and conditions; and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision, and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The Government \nhas  indicated  that  interest  during  construction  will  be  capitalized.  A  financing  plan  for  the  two \nprojects is provided in Table 2 (see Supplementary Appendix 11 for the detailed financing plan). \n \n\n                                                 \n12 Includes interest during construction and commitment fees. \n13 Front-end fee of 1.0% is waived for public sector loans approved during 1 January 2004\u201330 June 2005. \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n \nItem \n \nAsian Development Bank  \nGovernment of Sri Lanka \n              Total \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n22.4 \n0.0 \n22.4 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n \n\n \n\n \nPercentage\n \n\n2.6 \n8.4 \n11.0 \n\n25.0 \n8.4 \n33.4 \n\n75 \n25 \n100 \n\n4. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nProject Management \n\na. \n \n\n119.  MOFP  will  oversee  and  coordinate  the  implementation  of  both  projects  through \ndelegation  to:  (i) the  IICC  headed  by  the  secretary  to  the  treasury  and  comprising  senior \nrepresentatives of the fiscal management institutions (see para. 105 for the composition of the \nIICC);  and  (ii) a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  for  the  MRA  project,  headed  by  a  project \nmanager  (consultant)  who  will  report  jointly  to  the  CEO  of  the  Revenue  Board  and  to  the \nsecretary  to  the  treasury.  The  project  manager  will  have  the  authority  to  make  decisions \nessential  to  ensuring  progress  of  the  MRA  project  with  regard  to  facilitating  procurement  of \nequipment, and will liaise closely with the management coordination team (para. 122 below) on \nthe recruitment of consulting services. The project manager will be assisted by a deputy project \nmanager  funded  by  the  Government.  Coordination  across  the  two  projects  will  be  ensured  by \nthe IICC on administrative matters and by the Revenue Board on more substantive issues. The \nRevenue  Board oversees the CEO\u2019s activities and many of its members are also members of \nthe IICC. The secretary to the treasury as head of the IICC and member of the Revenue Board \nwill have full information and reinforce coordination of the FMRP. The secretary to the treasury \nwill have the authority to make decisions essential to ensure progress of the projects with regard \nto facilitating procurement of equipment and recruitment of consulting services under the project \nloans.  PIU  will  submit  quarterly  reports  in  compliance  with  international  accounting  practices \nand  will  ensure  internal  controls.  Activities  related  to  the  Strengthening  of  the  Fiscal \nManagement  Institutions  project  in  support  of  National  Budget  Department,  Fiscal  Policy \nDepartment, and State Accounts Department  will fall under the responsibility of the respective \ndirectors general while those for the Finance Commission will fall under the responsibility of the \nchairperson of the Finance Commission. They are all members of the IICC. (See Appendix 10 \nfor an organizational chart on the coordination and implementation arrangements under FMRP.) \n \n\nb. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\n \n120.  The  implementation  period  is  3  years  to  be  completed  by  December  2007.  (See \nAppendix 11 for the planned project implementation schedule.) \n\n \nc. \n \n\nProcurement  \n\n121.  Under  the  MRA  project,  three  procurement  packages  have  been  identified  and  are \noutlined in Appendix 12. Procurement of goods and services will be subject to the provisions of \ninternational \nADB's  Guidelines \ncompetitive bidding for package 1 on a turnkey basis and to include the purchase, installation, \ntesting, and training of the integrated RAMIS. Packages 2 and 3 will be procured under either \n\nfor  Procurement.  Equipment  will  be  procured \n\nthrough \n\n\f \n\n  27\n\ninternational  competitive  bidding  for  urgent  packages  not  exceeding  $100,000  or  direct \npurchase  for  urgent  packages  not  exceeding  $500,000  equivalent.  Package  2  will  support  the \nprocurement  of  business  machines  and  office  equipment  for  the  Finance  Commission  to \ncomplement  United  Nations  Development  Programme-supported  MIS  systems  recently \nprocured  to  ensure  prompt  link-up  of  the  Finance  Commission  with  the  provincial  councils\u2019 \nfinance departments. Package 3 will support the procurement of business machines and office \nequipment  for  the  newly  created  Revenue  Board  and  other  urgent  requests  in  the  revenue \ndepartments. ADB has approved advance action for procurement packages 2 and 3 to enable \nimmediate  initiation  of  activities  subsequent  to  loan  effectiveness.  The  Government  has  been \nadvised that approval of advance action does not commit ADB to finance the project. \n \n\nd. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n122.  The Strengthening of the Fiscal Management Institutions project loan will finance a total \nof 160 person-months of international and 270 person-months of domestic consulting services. \nAll  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement of domestic consultants. The Strengthening of the Fiscal Management Institutions \nproject  will  also  hire  a  management  coordination  team  to  facilitate  selection,  recruitment,  and \nmanagement of consulting services including the capacity-building and training components of \nthe project. The management coordination team will be provided by a firm through quality-based \nselection (QBS) and recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nUp  to  30%  of  the  total  costs  of  the  consulting  services  under  the  Strengthening  of  the  Fiscal \nManagement Institutions project are to be allocated for recruitment under QBS because (i) the \nassignment is critical as it affects a basic pillar of the economy, namely the Government\u2019s ability \nto  generate  revenue  that  not  only  affects  its  running  but  provides  the  basis  for  articulation  of \ngovernment policies through its spending program; (ii) institutional constraints in Sri Lanka pose \nrisks  for  the  favorable  outcome  of  the  FMRP  and  henceforth,  quality-based  consulting  inputs, \nwhich  are  critical  in  capacity-building  initiatives  under  FMRP,  need  to  override  other \nconsiderations  in  selection  of  consulting  firms;  (iii) the  assignments  are  complex  and  highly \nspecialized  and  process  oriented,  which  does  not  allow  the  writing  of  very  detailed  terms  of \nreference;  and  (iv) there  is  a  high  downstream  impact  and  risk  of  program  failure  if  the  best \nconsultant  is  not  selected.  QBS  will  be  used  for  recruitment  of  the  head  of  the  management \ncoordination team and head of PIU as well as revenue administration, human resources and IT \nspecialists,  and  an  actuarial  expert.  (See  Supplementary  Appendix  12  for  the  consulting \nservices selection criterion). \n \n123.  Separate  subcontracting  of  the  services  of  individual  consultants  or  firms  may  be \nrequired  for  other  components  of  the  Strengthening  of  the  Fiscal  Management  Institutions \nproject.  Consulting  services  for  such  other  components  will  be  provided  through  quality-and \ncost-based selection (QCBS) by one or more consulting firms or individual consultants recruited \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  In  the  case  of  selection  of \nconsulting firms, simplified technical proposals will be used wherever suitable. The Government \nof  Sri  Lanka  has  reached  a  preliminary  agreement  with  the  Revenue  Department  of  the \nGovernment  of  Thailand  to  have  officials  from  Thailand  sent  to  impart  training  and  advisory \nservices  to  Sri  Lanka.  The  recruitment  of  these  consultants  will  be  included  under  direct \nselection  as  part  of  the  overall  support  for  the  institutional  enhancements  of  the  revenue \nadministration in view of Thailand\u2019s recent transformation of its own revenue administration and \nunique  benefit  resulting  from  such  collaboration.  The  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  will  be \nresponsible  for  funding  the  deputy  project  manager,  and  various  human  resources  and  IT \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nspecialists,  as  well  as  selective  revenue  administration  training  courses  both  in  country  and \nabroad.14 All other funding of consultants will be financed by ADB. \n \n124.  The following components and illustrative activities are identified for financing under the \nStrengthening of the Fiscal Management Institutions project loan: \n \n\n(i) \n\nComponent 1: Project Implementation and Coordination \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe PIU under the leadership of the project manager will, \nin  addition  to  its  day-to-day  oversight  and  implementation \nfunctions,  also  assist  in  overseeing  procurement  and \nconsulting services inputs pertaining to the MRA project in \ncoordination with the IICC. There will be close coordination \nbetween  the  PIU  project  manager  and  the  head  of  the \nmanagement  coordination  team  including  (i) design  of \nconsultants, \nterms  of \nto  ensure \n(iii) identification  of  necessary  expertise \nsuccessful  project \n(iv) supervision  of \nimplementation, \nconsultants, and (v) quality control based on evaluation of \nconsultants\u2019  inputs  and  reports.  Coordination  will  be  in \nclose  liaison  with  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  PIU \nproject  manager  will  also  regularly  assess  performance \nand  effectiveness  of  capacity-building  inputs  in  support  of \nthe MRA project. \n\n(ii) selection  of \n\nreference, \n\nThe management coordination team will assist in designing \nterms  of  reference  and  facilitating  recruitment  in  close \nliaison with the PIU project manager, the Government, and \nADB, managing the consultants and reporting performance \nand  effectiveness  of  capacity-building  inputs  in  support  of \nproject-related  activities.  The  head  of  the  management \ncoordination \nfor \nadministrative  issues  on  the  capacity-building  component \nand  technical  oversight  other  than  in  the  modernizing  of \nthe  revenue  administration  component  below.  She  or  he \nwill  liaise  with  the  PIU  project  manager  on  all  matters \nrelated  to  the  modernizing  of  the  revenue  administration \ncomponent below. \n\nteam  will  have  overall  responsibility \n\nComponent  2: Modernizing of the Revenue Administration.  \n\n(ii) \nThis  component  will  support  the  implementation  of  the  Modernization  of \nRevenue  Administration  project  (as  identified  in  Appendix  6,  task  list  for \nthe modernization program of the revenue administration). \n\nComponent  3:  Fiscal  Management  Institutions  (non-MRA). \n(iii) \nThis component will support effective implementation of the policy actions \nidentified in the Program and will include: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n14 The Government will obtain ADB concurrence on consultant selection under government funding. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n  29\n\ndeveloping  a  comprehensive  management  audit  of  key \nministries to support their restructuring; \n\nbuilding  capacity \nprocedures through workshops and other training; \n\nimprove  results-based  budgeting \n\nto \n\npreparing an actuarial balance analysis to identify stock of \nunfunded government liabilities; \n\ndeveloping  a  liability  management  system  that  registers \nobligations at the commitment stage; \n\nimplementing  an  effective \ndesigning  and \nrelated counterpart fund management system; \n\nforeign-aid \n\ndeveloping  training  systems  for  provincial  level  cadres  in \nsuch areas as tax collection, accountancy, and MIS; and \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n \n(c) \n\n \n(d) \n\n \n(e) \n\n \n(f) \n\n \n(g) \n\nstrengthening the Finance Commission MIS. \n\n \n125.  ADB has approved advanced actions for component 1 to enable immediate initiation of \nactivities subsequent to loan effectiveness. \n \n\ne. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\n \n126.  CBSL  on  behalf  of  the  Borrower  will  open  within  1  month  of  loan  effectiveness,  two \nimprest  accounts  denominated  in  dollars,  one  for  each  of  the  project  loans  and  managed  by \nMOFP  (the  EA).  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  operated  and  maintained  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Handbook on Loan Disbursements dated January 2001. ADB will advance 3 months of \nestimated  expenditures  (about  $1.5 million)  into  the  imprest  accounts  for  each  of  the  loans. \nForeign exchange payments or letters of credit, as well as local currency expenditures, may be \npaid out of the imprest accounts. The ADB statement of expenditures procedure will be used to \nliquidate and replenish the imprest accounts for individual payments not exceeding $50,000. \n \n127.  The  EA  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts,  adequate  to  identify  goods  and \nservices financed out of the loan proceeds. Auditors acceptable to ADB will audit such accounts \nand records annually. \n \n\nf. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n128.  An audit of the use of the loan proceeds will be undertaken and ADB retains the right to \n(i) audit any account, and (ii) verify the validity of the certification issued by the Government for \neach withdrawal application. Prior to withdrawal, the Government will open an account at CBSL \nto  receive  all  loan  proceeds.  The  account  will  be  managed,  operated,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. The IICC and the PIU will send quarterly progress \nreports to ADB on project implementation. \n \n129.  The  Government  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  for  the  imprest  funds  and  project \nexpenditure  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  and  will  have  such  accounts  and \nrecords  audited  annually  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the \nsubmission of project reports, audited accounts, and financial statements are in compliance with \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nADB's guidelines. Certified copies of the audit reports together with the auditors\u2019 opinion will be \nsubmitted to the Government and ADB not more than 6 months after the close of financial year. \nThe  audit  reports  will  include  a  separate  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and \nstatement of expenditures procedures. \n \n130.  Each  component  of  the  projects  will  be  implemented  in  three  phases.  During  the \ninception  phase,  the  consultants  of  the  various  components  will  revalidate  the  objectives  and \nassess  priorities,  key  issues,  and  capacity-building  needs.  At  the  end  of  this  phase,  resource \ninputs  may  be  adjusted,  as  appropriate,  within  the  overall  budget  and  project  scope,  to  better \nalign the terms of reference, activities, and outputs with client expectations and needs. During \nthe  design phase,  the consultants will  formulate  in  detail  the  capacity-building  and  operational \ndevelopment plans. Finally, in the implementation phase, the consultants will document required \nregulations, procedures, and systems, as well as arrange for training and skills development, as \nappropriate. \n \n131.  The consultants for each component will prepare an inception report within 2 months of \nthe start of their services, which will fine-tune and detail the work program and establish time-\nbound outputs. A first review report will be submitted at the end of 6 months, a second review \nreport at the end of 12 months, an interim report at the end of 24 months, and a draft final report \nincluding  complete  documentation  at  the  end  of  30  months,  with  the  submission  of  the  final \nreport  at  the  end  of  the  assignment  after  incorporation  of  comments  of  ADB  and  the \nGovernment. \n \n132.  The PIU will submit quarterly reports on the two projects to ADB within 1 month of the \nend  of  each  quarter  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  program  performance  management  system \n(PPMS) guidelines. The reports will contain a narrative description of progress made during the \nperiod, changes to the implementation schedule if any, problems or difficulties encountered and \nthe  remedial  actions  taken,  the  performance  of  the  project  consultants  where  applicable,  and \nthe work to be carried in the upcoming period. The reports will also include a summary financial \naccount for the two projects, consisting of the projects\u2019 expenditures to date. Project completion \nreports will be submitted to ADB within 3 months of the completion of the projects. \n \n \n \n133. \nIn addition to regular and ongoing interaction among the EA, ADB, and its consultants, \nthe  Government  and  ADB  will  periodically  review  project  implementation  based  on  quarterly \nreports of the PIU and consultant reports. The reviews will include evaluation of project scope, \nimplementation arrangements, consultations with MOFP and PIU, and progress with the policy \nreform  agenda  and  capacity-building  measures.  On  an  annual  basis  or  more  frequently  if \nwarranted, the EA will submit a report to ADB on the overall assessment of the quality of inputs. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\ng.  \n\n \nh. \n\nProject Reviews  \n\n \n134.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  periodically  review  project  implementation.  The  reviews \nwill include evaluation of the project scope, implementation arrangements, consultation with EA \nand PIU, and progress with the policy reform agenda and capacity-building measures. ADB will \nalso field regular review missions, including midterm, and project completion review missions. A \ncomprehensive midterm review at the end of year 2 will be undertaken to evaluate actual physical \nand financial progress. Based on this review, modifications and improvements will be considered. \n \n \n\n\f \n\n  31\n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \nBenefits \n\nfiscal  consolidation  compatible  with  medium-term \n\nA. \n \n135.  The proposed FMRP is expected to address constraints highlighted under Section III by \nstrengthening public finances including improving public resource and expenditure management \nsystems, promoting fiscal discipline, and supporting fiscal decentralization. The FMRP will help \nestablish  a  well-functioning,  coordinated,  and  semiautonomous  revenue  administration \ncomprising inland revenue, customs and excise departments, which would be responsible for all \naspects  of  revenue  collection.  As  part  of  automation  of  the revenue  administration,  the  FMRP \nwill  also  contribute  toward  e-government.  The  FMRP  will  also  help  streamline  budgeting \nprocedures and expenditure control processes within MOFP. As part of this reform agenda, the \nFMRP  will  assist  in  reorienting  budget  management  from  a  compliance-based  system  to  one \nincorporating elements of results-based budgeting. Fiscal discipline will be strengthened under \nthe  FMRP  through  measures  to  increase  transparency  and  accountability  and  based  on \nlegislative and rules-based reporting requirements. Finally, support for fiscal decentralization will \ninclude  measures  to  reduce  the  overlap  of  public  expenditure  functions  across  levels  of \ngovernment  as  well  as  other  reforms  to  improve  funding  and  effectiveness  of  devolved \nassignments. These measures are expected to support the implementation of the Government\u2019s \nfiscal  strategy,  emphasizing \nfiscal \nsustainability, and to improve fiscal performance. \n \n136.  The MRA project will focus on the procurement of the RAMIS and ancillary equipment to \nassist in the creation of the MRA and thereby ensure a prompt and smooth transformation of the \nrevenue administration. Under the Strengthening of the Fiscal Management Institutions project, \nsupport  will  be  provided  to,  among  others,  carrying  out  the  activities  on  the  task  list  for  the \nmodernization  program  of  the  revenue  administration,  thereby  complementing  the  RAMIS \nautomation process. In addition, implementation plans have been prepared on strategic inputs \nto  support  a  well-running  revenue  administration  including  organization  and  management, \nhuman  resources  and  training,  and  IT.  The  equipment  procured  under  the  project  loan  will \nprovide  the  necessary  infrastructure  to  facilitate  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  tax  collection \nand compliance. \n \n137.  The  non-MRA  capacity-building  components  under  the  Strengthening  of  the  Fiscal \nManagement  Institutions  project  will  support  the  implementation  of  the  reform  program  under \nFMRP.  As  part  of  this  assistance,  training  activities  as  well  as  highly  specialized  consulting \nservices  will  be  financed  to  improve  the  effective  operations  of  the  fiscal  management \ninstitutions. While some activities under the capacity-building component have been identified, \nothers have yet to be defined, thereby providing greater flexibility for the Government to manage \nresources  under  this  project  loan.  The  project  loans  will  therefore  serve  to  (i) strengthen  the \nrevenue  administration  and  other  fiscal  management  institutions  and,  ultimately,  improve \ncompliance  with  fiscal  objectives;  and  (ii) help  mitigate  risks,  particularly  in  the  setting  up  the \nmodernization  of \nthereby  ensure  successful  program \nimplementation. \n \nB. \n \n138.  The  FMRP  will  seek  to  strengthen  public  finances,  focusing  on  improving  the  budget \nframework  and  expenditure  control  measures  while  enhancing  revenue  mobilization  efforts. \nDirect beneficiaries will include business at large who, despite paying higher taxes on average \n(as  loopholes  are  closed  and  effective  compliance  strengthened)  over  the  medium  term,  will \n\nrevenue  administration  and \n\nImpacts \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nRisks  \n\nbenefit from a clearer, simplified, and more balanced tax and customs administration. Under the \nGovernment\u2019s  reform  program,  fiscal  consolidation  may  result  in  cutbacks  on  current \nexpenditures  in  the  social  sector,  which  may  affect  the  poor.  However,  these  cutbacks  will  be \noffset  by  measures  to  increase  the  effectiveness  of  these  expenditures  and  by  outright \nincreases in capital expenditures in the social sector that over the medium term more than offset \nthe current expenditure cutbacks, in relative terms. \n \n139.  On the positive side, the FMRP will strengthen macroeconomic stabilization by reducing \nthe  country\u2019s  imbalances,  thereby  supporting  higher  and  more  sustainable  growth  prospects. \nThis is expected to contribute to poverty reduction. In addition, under the FMRP, measures to \nstrengthen  fiscal  decentralization  and  performance  monitoring  would  also  target  the  social \nsector  spending  agencies  thereby  providing  greater  effectiveness  of  spending  assignments, \nespecially  for  those  segments  of  the  population  that  are  more  reliant  on  public  goods  and \nservices.  Finally,  under  the  envisaged  reforms  to  intergovernment  transfer  setting,  equity \nconsiderations  and,  in  particular,  poverty  incidence  will  be  given  greater  prominence,  thereby \nsupporting poverty reduction. (See Appendix 13 for the summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy.) \n \n140.  FMRP is classified as category C under ADB\u2019s environmental classification system. The \nFMRP is expected to have no direct environmental impact. \n \nC. \n \n141.  There  are  multiple  risks  to  the  successful  implementation  of  the  FMRP.  Foremost, \nconsolidation  of  the  peace  process  and  political  stability  will  be  critical  for  the  Government  to \noversee  meaningful  economic  reforms.  Fiscal  consolidation  efforts,  in  particular,  will  require \nstrong  government  commitment  and  any  slippages  on  the  security  or  political  fronts  may \nweaken  the  Government\u2019s  resolve.  Although  limited  disbursements  were  realized  in  2004, \nresources committed at the June 2003 Tokyo Donor Conference, subject to progress in peace \ntalks, should facilitate the fiscal consolidation process.  \n \n142.  On  the  economic  front,  exogenous  shocks  to  the  economy  could  potentially  impair  the \nGovernment\u2019s  ability  for  aggressive  fiscal  consolidation.  Current  high  oil  prices  have  weighed \nheavily  on  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  stabilization  efforts  and  in  particular  on  the  balance  of  payments. \nFurthermore,  attempts  to  cushion  the  effect  of  high  oil  prices  on  domestic  users  have  indeed \nadded  further  pressure  on  the  fiscal  balance.  As  fiscal  consolidation  leads  to  improved \nmacroeconomic  stabilization  and  greater  flexibility  to  cope  with  these  shocks,  there  is  a \nreinforcing link between the deepening of reforms and ability to cope with these shocks. \n \n143.  Other risks include the power of vested interests that could attempt to block reforms. The \ngreatest risk here comes from trade unions, which may successfully mobilize public opinion (i.e., \nthrough  strikes  and  other  industrial  action)  in  a  manner  so  as  to  dilute  the  reforms,  potentially \nproving  detrimental  to  the  FMRP\u2019s  objectives.  There  are  also  institutional  risks  given  the \nrelatively  overstretched  resources  in  key  ministries  and  revenue  administration.  These, \ncombined  with  the  comprehensive  nature  of  the  FMRP  and  the  close  links  with  political  risks, \nmay slow implementation of the FMRP. \n \n144.  Safeguards  include  the  \u201cadditionality\u201d  of  a  continuing  and  constructive  policy  dialogue \nbetween  the  Government  and  IMF  on  conducive  fiscal  consolidation  and  stabilization-based \nmacroeconomic  policies.  In  addition,  supporting  project  loans  will  mitigate  risks  through  the \nincreased  supply  of  resources\u2014including  consulting  services,  equipment  and  training\u2014which \n\n\f \n\n  33\n\nshould  help  overcome  institutional  constraints  and  facilitate  program  implementation.  For  this \nreason,  close  coordination  between  ADB  and  the  Government  is  of  fundamental  importance \nespecially  with  respect  to  close  monitoring  of  FMRP  and  of  consultants\u2019  performance.  ADB\u2019s \nproposed  Private  Sector  and  Financial  Markets  Development  and  the  ongoing  Power  Sector \nDevelopment  programs15  will  also  reinforce  measures  such  as  improving  governance  in \ncommercial public enterprises, power sector restructuring, and cost recovery in electricity tariffs, \nthereby  reducing  pressures  on  state  budget.  (See  Appendix  14  for  the  development \ncoordination matrix.) \n \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n145. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  assurances  that \n(i) the policies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of the Program Loan Agreement and \nProject Loan Agreements, as described in the Development Policy Letter, will continue in effect \nfor the duration of the FMRP; and (ii) it will promptly adopt the other policies and take the other \nactions  included  in  the  FMRP  as  specified  in  the  Development  Policy  Letter  and  Loan \nAgreement  to  ensure  that  such  policies  and  actions  continue  in  effect  for  the  duration  of  the \nFMRP. \n \n146.

As  part  of  the  framework  a  revised  medium-term  fiscal  program  and  strategy  for \n2004\u20132007 was launched. \n \nFour challenges are identified in the Economic Policy Framework, namely: (i) increasing \n2. \nemployment,  (ii) overcoming  the  public  debt  crisis,  (iii) mobilizing  resources  for  reconstruction, \nand  (iv) increasing  income  levels.  To  meet  these  challenges,  the  Government  has  prepared  a \nMedium-Term  Macro  Fiscal  Policy  Framework  (MFPF)  2005\u20132008  submitted  with  the  2005 \nBudget to Parliament on 18 November 2004. Salient features of the MFPF include: (i) continued \nincrease in annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate from 6% in 2005 to 7.5% by 2008, \n(ii) a decrease of the GDP deflator from 8% in 2005 to 4.5% in 2008, (iii) a consecutive increase \nof  total  investment  from  28%  of  GDP  in  2005  to  34%  in  2008,  (iv) a  consecutive  increase  of \nnational saving from 23.3% of GDP in 2005 to 30.8% in 2008, (v) a reduction in overall budget \ndeficit from 7.6% of GDP in 2005 to 4.4% in 2008, (vi) an improvement in the revenue balance \nfrom a deficit of 1.3% of GDP in 2005 to a surplus of 3.6% of GDP by 2008, and (vii) a decrease \nin  total  government  debt  from  103.9%  of  GDP  in  2005  to  93.5%  in  2008  (Supplementary \nAppendix 5). \n \n3. \nFiscal  reforms  constitute  a  key  element  under  the  medium-term  macroeconomic  policy \naction plans. The fiscal program in this medium-term strategy aims to restore fiscal sustainability \nand  concurrently  make  available  adequate  resources  for  (i) priority  spending  on  pro-growth \ncapital  and  social  spending,  and  (ii) post-conflict  needs.  The  following  section  describes  the \nmedium-term fiscal measures under this medium-term strategy. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nIn view of the importance of creating fiscal space and significantly reducing large fiscal \ndeficits  and  public  debt,  the  Government  has  embarked  on  fiscal  consolidation  aiming  at \n(i) generating higher revenue; (ii) reducing current expenditure in order to enable higher capital \nexpenditure; and (iii) reducing demand on state resources by controlling leakages resulting from \nlending and transfers to public enterprises, contingent liabilities, and high debt service cost. \n \n\nMedium-Term Fiscal Program \n\n1. \n\nRevenue \n\n \n5. \nUnder the MFPF, total revenue as a percentage of GDP will increase by 3.9 percentage \npoints  from  an  estimated  15.6%  in  2004  to  19.5%  in  2008.  This  comprises  an  increase  in  tax \nrevenues from 14.1% of GDP in 2004 to 17.7% in 2008 driven by increases in value-added tax \n(VAT)  collection,  which  accounts  for  approximately  41%  of  total  tax  revenue.  VAT  including \neconomic service charge is targeted to increase from 5.9% of GDP in 2004 to 7.7% of GDP in \n2008, an increase of 1.8 percentage points. Excise taxes accounting for approximately 23% of \ntotal revenue are targeted to keep constant at approximately 3.2% of GDP in 2004 through to \n2008.  Income  tax,  accounting  for  approximately  15%  of  total  tax  revenue,  is  expected  to \ngenerate a more moderate increase of up to 0.9 percentage points from 2.2% of GDP in 2004 to \n3.1% in 2008. On nontax revenue, there will be a small increase from 1.5% of GDP in 2004 to \n1.9%  of  GDP  in  2008  as  there  will  be  minor  contributions  from  privatization  proceeds.  The \nincrease  in  nontax  revenues  will  reflect  increasing  contributions  from  strategic  enterprises  by \nway  of  profit  and  dividend  and  the  impact  of  cost  recovery  on  state  enterprises.  The  main \n\n\f36\n\nAppendix 1 \n\ninclude \n\nKey  elements \n\nin  support  of \n\nrevenue  augmentation  measures \n\nsources of nontax revenue in the past have been profits from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and \ninterest payments on government lending. The former accounts for approximately 30% of total \nnontax revenue, and the latter for approximately 20%.  \n \n(i) tax \n6. \nadministration, (ii) tax policy, and (iii) tax legislation. The tax administration measures essentially \ncomprise  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-supported  Modernization  of  the  Revenue \nAdministration  project  described  in  the  main  text.  On  tax  policy,  measures  will  target:  (i)  a \nbroadening of the tax base including the major achievement of integrating civil servants under \nthe pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) tax; (ii) increasing the number of VAT and customs duty bands as \nwell as their rates; (iii) introducing the turnover tax; (iv) implementing a simplified tax code; and \n(v)  introducing  a  tightening  of  existing  deductions  on  corporate  taxes.  On  tax  legislation,  the \nonus will be on providing clear legislation that closes loopholes in tax laws and that phases out \nthe myriad of tax concessions. A significant reform submitted under the 2005 Budget includes \nimproving the powers of the revenue administration by introducing dedicated tax courts to deal \nwith recovery and other tax administration disputes. The tax legislation will also be amended to \nprovide the authority to the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue advanced rulings that are \nbinding in law. \n \n2. \n\nExpenditure \n\n \n7. \nOn the expenditure front, the Government plans to reduce current expenditures mainly \nthrough:  (i)  a  significant  reduction  in  subsidies  and  transfers  to  households  and  public \nenterprises; (ii) cutbacks in interest payments and defense spending; and (iii) prioritizing public \nexpenditure1  while  increasing  capital  spending  on  rural  infrastructure  facilities.  From  2003  to \n2007,  the  Government  plans  to  contain  total  expenditure  to  just  below  24%  of  GDP  by  2008. \nThis  comprises  a  reduction  in  recurrent  expenditure  from  19.3%  of  GDP  in  2004  to  15.9%  in \n2008. However, capital expenditure is set to increase by 2.9 percentage points from 5% in 2004 \nto 7.9% in 2008. Debt service payments are targeted to decline from 11.7% of GDP in 2004 to \n7.5%  in  2008  reflecting  the  expected  lower  interest  rate  environment  and  improved  debt \nmanagement  operations.  Government  subsidies  and  transfers  which  in  2004  are  projected  to \naccount  for  a  record,  21%  of  total  expenditures\u2014due  to  oil  price  subsidies  and  drought \nassistance  relief\u2014are  expected  to  decline  to  16%  of  total  expenditures  in  2005.  In  relation  to \nGDP, Government subsidies and transfers will decline from 5.1% in 2004 to 3.8% by 2008. The \nGovernment has announced plans for 2005 to convert SLRs90 billion of loans (with an average \nrate  of  interest  of  11\u201313%)  to  non-convertible,  lower  interest  rate  bonds.  Accordingly,  interest \npayments will decline from 6% of GDP in 2004 to 5.6% in 2005 and onwards to 4.5% by 2008. \nThe  Government  is  also  committed  to  streamlining  defense  spending  which  is  projected  to \ndecline marginally from 3.5% of GDP in 2004 to 3.2% in 2008, subject to the continuation of the \neffective  cease-fire  and  ensuing  peace  process.  On  public  expenditure  prioritization,  the \nGovernment  has  identified  various  measures  including  (i) deepening  expenditure  control \nmeasures  supported  by  the  FMRP,  (ii) strengthening  accounting  and  auditing  standards,  and \n(iii) introducing improved practices in procurement management. These are expected to reduce \nsignificant wasteful expenditure.  \n \n8. \nThe reductions in recurrent expenditure are projected to be partially offset by increases \nin  capital  expenditure  largely  reflecting  the  positive  externalities  from  a  targeted  focus  on \nreconstruction of the north and northeast. The underlying strategy on capital expenditure is for \n\n                                                 \n1  Nearly  20%  of  the  Government\u2019s  current  expenditures  are  used  for  transfers  to  households,  similar  to  patterns \n\nobserved in upper-income Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development nations. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n37 \n\nthe  Government  to  absorb  the  maximum  available  foreign  concessional  investment,  and  by \nputting  in  place  measures  to  improve  monitoring  of  incoming  development  assistance  and \nstrengthened links with the budget to increase the disbursement rate of concessional borrowing.  \n \n\n3. \n\nPublic Enterprises \n\nThe  Strategic  Enterprises  Management  Authority  (SEMA)  was  created  by \n\n \n9. \nThere are more than 150 statutory boards and fully owned government companies and \nat least 40 commercial companies under partial government shareholding. Failure to restructure \nand  introduce  timely  cost-recovery  pricing  will  increase  the  deficits  and  resulting  quasi-fiscal \ndrainage of resources from the budget. To contain further pressure on the state budget caused \nby  public  enterprise  operations,2  the  Government  is  addressing  inefficient  operations  of  public \nenterprises through comprehensive restructuring programs of 12 key public sector undertakings. \n \n10. \nthe \nGovernment  shortly  upon  assuming  office  with  the  objective  to  manage  as  independent \nenterprises  12  strategic  enterprises\u2014with  combined  assets  in  excess  of  $10.5  billion.  A  key \nelement will be to improve profitability and accordingly restructuring plans have been approved \nby  SEMA  and  the  respective  board  of  directors,  which  were  submitted  for  cabinet  approval  in \nlate  October  2004.  As  far  as  the  impact  on  the  budget  is  concerned,  the  restructuring  plans \ncontain strict budget ceilings to reduce the strategic enterprises' impact on public finances and \nto prevent losses of the strategic enterprises from being financed through state-owned banks.  \n \n11. \nThe  results  from  the  restructuring  plans  should  lay  the  foundations  for  increases  in \nnontax revenue remittances from public enterprises, reduction of accumulated tax arrears, and \nreduced  subsidies  and  guarantees  to  public  enterprises.  The  last  point  is  particularly  of  a \ngreater  concern  due  to  the  existing  subsidies  and  other  contingent  liabilities  supported  by  the \nGovernment under its direct transfer and lending program to public enterprises and institutions. \n \n\n4. \n\nPublic Debt Management  \n\n \n12. \nTo  reduce  the  debt  service  cost,  the  Government  has  introduced  measures  to  control \ninterest  payments  by  refraining  from  using  expensive  domestic  borrowing  (such  as  overdraft \nfacilities),  smoothing  the  debt  amortization  schedule,  and  issuing  longer-term  debt.  The \nGovernment  is  also  assessing  the  merits  of  establishing  an  independent  public  debt \nmanagement office at the Ministry of Finance to steward debt management reforms. \n \nInterest payment on government debt peaked at 7.5% of GDP in 2003, and according to \n13. \nthe Economic Policy Framework is projected to gradually decline to 5% in 2007 as the primary \ndeficit moves into balance. Interest payment, which accounted for 35% of current expenditure in \n2003,  was  the  largest  item  of  current  expenditure.  This  reflected  a  combination  of  the \naccumulation  of  high-cost  domestic  debt  together  with  constraints  to  debt  management \nincluding limitations on including a callable option on issued debt. In particular, the Government \ncontinued to expand budget deficits throughout the late 1990s and early 2000 despite a shortfall \nin  financing  sources.  Consequently,  the  interest  rate  was  pushed  up  to  20\u201322%  between  late \n2000  and  mid-20013  due  to  persistently  high  fiscal  deficits.  Furthermore,  large  amortizations, \n\n                                                 \n2  The Government provided an estimated capital injection of $166 million for five strategic public enterprises in 2003 \n\nand another $113 million is estimated for 2004. \n3  Weighted average of bank prime lending rates. \n\n\f38\n\nAppendix 1 \n\nreflecting a past overconcentration of rolled over short-term debt issuance in 1999 and 2000, fell \ndue in 2002 (and 2003)4 adding greater fiscal stress in the form of larger debt-servicing costs. \n \n14. \nIn 2002, the Government replaced high-cost overdrafts with marketable debt instruments \nsuch  as  treasury  bills  and  treasury  bonds.  As  a  result,  the  outstanding  overdraft  was  reduced \nfrom  SRs38  billion  (12%  of  current  liabilities)  at  end-2001  to  SRs3.6  billion  (2%  of  current \nliabilities)  at  end-2002.  This  measure  not  only  lowered  the  interest  cost  but  also  reduced  the \npressure  on  government  cash  flow.  This  effort  will  need  to  be  further  consolidated  over  the \ncoming years. \n \n\n                                                 \n4  According  to  the  government  accounts  reported  in  CBSL  Annual  Report  2002,  total  amortization  payments  (both \ndomestic and foreign) are SRs167,843 million and SRs187,754 million in 2002 and 2003, respectively, compared \nwith total revenue of SRs270,763 million and SRs316,223 million in 2002 and 2003, respectively. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n39 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFISCAL OBJECTIVES AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE FISCAL  \nMANAGEMENT (RESPONSIBILITY) ACT \n\nTable A2.1: Fiscal Objectives under the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act \n \nObjective \n(% of GDP) \n\nTiming \n\nCriteria \n\n1.

The  Revenue \nAdministration Management Information System (RAMIS) is now proposed to fully integrate and \ncomprehensively cover the use of information and communications technology (ICT) to improve \nrevenue mobilization in Sri Lanka. The fully integrated and comprehensive RAMIS will help the \nthree revenue departments\u2014Inland Revenue Department (IRD), Customs Department (CD), and \nExcise  Department  (ED)\u2014in  enhancing  effectiveness,  efficiency,  and  transparency  of  revenue \nadministration through the use of new technology. RAMIS aims to help the revenue departments \ndevelop an electronic organization system (also known as \u2018e-organization\u2019) and ensure that the \nstandard  is  maintained  on  an  ongoing  basis.  RAMIS  will  also  provide  secure,  efficient,  and \nresponsive  systems  for  the  users  in  the  departments  and  for  the  clients  of  the  departments.  In \nother  words,  RAMIS  will  also  promote  voluntary  compliance  among  taxpayers  through,  among \nothers, wide information dissemination modes and a fully integrated one-stop shop for taxpayers. \nThe  integrated  RAMIS  will  lay  down  synergies  in  revenue  administration  across  departments, \nwhich  in  turn  should  enable  tax  collectors  to  cross-check  tax  information  within  and  across \ndepartments. \n\nThe tax data and information from each of the three revenue departments and the Board \n2. \nof Investment (BOI) will be integrated in a common platform. These data and information include \nregistration  information,  taxpayer  accounting,  and  tax  identity  numbers.  Selected  information \nfrom  the  common  platform  will  be  available  to  authorized  tax  officials  in  each  of  the  three \nrevenue  departments.  (See  the  flow  chart  on  information  flow  under  RAMIS  below.)  A  master \nplan will be developed to determine what functions are common and which are unique to each \ndepartment,  and  it  will  identify  a  prioritized  plan  for  development.  During  the  reengineering \nprocess, the systems requirements will be clearly defined. Existing systems were built based on \nprocesses  available  at  the  time  and  are  as  inefficient  as  the  processes  themselves.  The \nfunctionality of all systems must be expanded and in the case of the core systems, all tax types \nshould be included. \n\nFigure A7: Revenue Administration Management Information System \n\n   Common Platform\n\nFinance \nCommission/ \nProvincial Council\n\nTreasury (Public \n \nAccounting And Financial \nMIS) \n\n   Registration Information \n   Taxpayer Accounting \n  Taxpayer Identification      \n   Number \n\nVAT, Income Taxes, etc. \n\nInland Revenue Dept \nLarge Taxpayer Unit \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nASYCUDA = Automated System for Customs Data, BOI = Board of Investment, EDI = Electronic Direct Interface,  \nMIS = management information system, VAT = value-added tax. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nCustoms Duties \nVAT on Imports \nExcises on \nImports, Etc. \n\nTax \nIdentification \nNumber \n\nBOI \nSystem \n\nASYCUDA/EDI\n\nCustoms Dept\n\nExcise Dept \n\nExcise Tax \n\nBanks \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n \n65\n\nIn each of the three departments, a modernization unit will be established to spearhead \n3. \nrevenue modernization and mobilization reforms. The Revenue Modernization Unit (RMU) to be \nestablished in IRD will design and implement the reforms such as maintenance of tax systems, \ndata  entry  of  tax  returns,  hardware,  and  network  support.  The  Customs  Modernization  Unit \n(CMU)  to  be  established  in  CD  will  support  the  Automated  System  for  Customs  Data \n(ASYCUDA)  system,  hardware,  and  network  support,  and  develop  and  support  cargo  control \nsystems.  The  Excise  Modernization  Unit  (EMU)  will  be  established  in  ED  will  design  and \nimplement the administrative reforms of excise tax collection.  \n\n4. \nWhile  seeking  to  introduce  the  new  comprehensive  and  integrated  ICT  system,  the \nRAMIS  will  maintain  and  update  the  existing  systems  used  in  each  of  the  three  revenue \ndepartments.  The  major  existing  IT  systems  include  the  ASYCUDA  and  Electronic  Direct \nInterface (EDI) in the CD. Apart from the ASYCUDA system within CD, the existing IT systems \nprovide  a  very  limited  range  of  support  for  revenue  administration.  Within  the  IRD  there  are \nseparate  systems  to  process  and  account  for  tax  returns  and  payments  for  different  types  of \ntaxes.  It  is  not  possible  to  obtain  a  clear  indication  of  a  taxpayer\u2019s  account  with  regard  to  the \ntaxes  within  the  tax  administration  that  it  controls.  Therefore,  it  is  also  not  possible  to  obtain \ncritical  information  needed  for  auditing  the  status  of  the  taxpayer  who  deals  with  all  three \nrevenue departments. In addition to the stand-alone IT systems, much important tax information \nis  not  entered  into  the  system  at  all.  For  example,  all  import  value-added  tax  information  is \ntransferred from CD to IRD in an ad hoc fashion without being systematically entered into the IT \nsystems of the two departments. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n66\n\nAppendix 9 \n\nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE STRENGTHENING OF THE FISCAL MANAGEMENT \nINSTITUTIONS PROJECT  \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe  primary  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  support  the  key  institutions  responsible  for \npublic  finance  across  various  activities  in  order  to  improve  fiscal  performance.  The  secondary \nobjective of the Project will be to support the implementation of the policy component under the \nFiscal Management Reform Program (FMRP). The thrust of the Project will focus on developing \nnew  systems  and  procedures,  which  in  combination  with  the  procurement  of  the  Revenue \nAdministration  Management  Information  System  (RAMIS)  and  ancillary  computer  equipment, \nunder  the  Modernization  of  the  Revenue  Administration  project,  will  enhance  capacity, \nefficiency, and effectiveness of the revenue and budget administrations. \n \n2. \nThe specific areas to be covered under the terms of reference of the project loan include \nstrengthening  skills  and  know-how  at:  (i)  the  three  revenue  departments  of  inland  revenue, \ncustoms,  and  excise  departments;  (ii)  National  Budget  Department  (NBD);  (iii)  State  Account \nDepartment;  (iv)  Finance  Commission  (FC);  and  (v)  other  government  institutions  linked  to \npublic  finances  and  to  be  defined  at  a  later  stage.  A  Revenue  Board  (RB)  was  established  to \ncoordinate the tasks to be carried out by the three revenue departments under the Modernizing \nof  the  Revenue  Administration  (MRA)  component.  In  addition,  an  Interagency  Implementation \nand  Coordination  Committee  (IICC)  for  the  Project  will  be  established  to  oversee  the \nimplementation of both the program and project components of the FMRP.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \n \n\nThe Project is expected to support activities leading to the following outcomes: \n\nOutcomes  \n\n(i)  \n\nModernizing  Revenue  Administration  (under  Appendix  4,  A.

Yes \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nTargeting Classification:    General Intervention \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka:  \n \nThe  Fiscal  Management  Reform  Program  (FMRP)  contributes  to  poverty  reduction  through  promoting \ngood  governance  by  improving  effectiveness  of  tax  administration,  budget  framework,  expenditure \nmanagement  control  systems,  fiscal  discipline,  and  fiscal  decentralization  framework.  The  FMRP  will \nstrengthen macroeconomic stabilization by reducing the country\u2019s imbalances, thereby supporting higher \nand more sustainable growth prospects. The lower the budget deficit is, the less intense the competition \nfor resources between public and private sector, thereby reducing the price of borrowing, i.e., the interest \nrate.  The  private  sector  can  obtain  more  resources  at  lower  cost  to  expand  investment  and  production. \nThrough  a  better  accessibility  to  such  resources,  the  private  sector  can  actively  and  efficiently  generate \neconomic  growth  and  provide  employment  opportunities  for  the  poor.  This  is  expected  to  contribute  to \npoverty  alleviation.  In  addition,  various  activities  such  as  fiscal  decentralization  and  performance \nmonitoring should provide greater effectiveness of spending assignments, especially for those segments \nof the population that are more reliant on public goods and services. Finally, the review of intergovernment \ntransfers under the fiscal decentralization component of the FMRP should result in a revised formula that \nprovides greater emphasis on equity considerations such as income per capita. \n \nB. \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nWith no reforms, not only the poor of the present generation will increasingly suffer from declining access \nto  public  goods  and  services  but  also  the  poor  of  future  generations  due  to  the  resulting  transfer  of  the \nlarge and uncontained debt burden. The FMRP assists the Government in the area of fiscal consolidation \nand structural reforms. Under the Government\u2019s reform program, fiscal consolidation, resulting in cutbacks \non recurrent expenditures in the social sector, may affect the poor in the short run. However, measures to \nincrease  the  effectiveness  of  these  expenditures  and  outright  increases  in  capital  expenditures  in  the \nsocial  sector  more  than  offset  the  current  expenditure  cutbacks  over  the  medium  term.  In  addition,  the \nGovernment is committed to protecting public spending on services most important to the poor and indeed \nhaving public spending better focused on the needs of the poor. Fiscal consolidation is critical in order for \nthe Government to overcome the serious problem of public debt crisis.  \n \nUnder  the  FMRP,  from  the  revenue  side,  cutting  down  on  tax  exemptions  combined  with  the \n \nremoval of economic distortions arising from an uneven tax system is expected to generate greater fiscal \nrevenues. On the expenditure side, the FMRP will support the improved efficiency of public spending and \ngreater  public  savings  through:  (i) restructuring  efforts  of  departments,  (ii) removal  of  duplication  across \ngovernments and ministries, and (iii) greater transparency in the use of funds including special funds. The \nrestructuring efforts may lead to some labor shedding, however this should be offset by more effective use \nof expenditures and social transfers. \n \n \nIn  line  with  fiscal  consolidation  efforts  supported  by  the  FMRP  and  overall  improved \nmacroeconomic  stabilization,  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  outlook  under  the  government \neconomic development strategy is estimated to increase to 6.4% per annum over the medium term. This is \nexpected to increase income per capita from $838 in 2001 to $940 in 2007. Similarly, inflation, a tax falling \ndisproportionately on the poor, is projected to decline from 6.3% in 2003 to 5% in 2007. More importantly, \nunemployment is forecast to fall from 8.4% in 2003 to an estimated 7% in 2007. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f76 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n  Yes \n\n   Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   No    \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \nC. \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nStakeholder analysis: A poverty reduction strategy developed over the years 1999\u20132002, which provides a \nfoundation for the designing of the reform program, sought widespread participation and consultation with \nstakeholders and interest groups. The Government has undertaken extensive stakeholder consultation in \nthe  elaboration  of  the  2005  budget.  The  Government  is  currently  in  the  process  of  updating  the  poverty \nreduction strategy.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nParticipation  strategy:  The  participation  strategy  is  applicable  for  the  project  component  of  the  program \nloan,  supporting  to  modernization  of  the  revenue  administration.  The  strategy  is  to  maximize  the \ninvolvement  of  and  communication  with  labor  unions  of  Inland  Revenue  Department,  Customs \nDepartment,  and  Excise  Department  in  the  process  of  change.  This  is  to  be  done  by  identifying \nsubstantive  issues  common  to  employees\u2019  concerns  and  that  would  be  dealt  with  in  the  project.  The \nproject will also provide the basis for an internal and external communication strategy. Under this strategy, \nrevenue  reform  project  would  have  transparent  mechanisms  for  interaction  within  the  agencies  and  with \nthe Government to move reforms forward and to mitigate public and inter- and intra-agency conflicts. \n \nD. \nGender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nStrategy  to  maximize  impacts  on  women:  Not  applicable.  Recruitment  of  new  staff  for  the  revenue \nadministration is merit-based. However, the human resources strategy is to ensure that women will not be \ndisadvantaged by the project because of economic, political, or sociolegal discrimination. \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nE. \nItem \n\n    Yes \n\n   No  \n\nSocial Safeguards and other Social Risks \nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n Significant \n\nResettlement \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n \nNot  applicable.

ADB  has  provided \n(i)  Public  Expenditure \ntechnical  assistance \nManagement  Systems  (PEMS)1,  and  (ii)  Public  Sector  Resource  Management  (PSRM).2  The \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  has  provided  policy  recommendations  to  achieve  overall \nmacroeconomic  stability  including  fiscal  stability  through  the  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth \nFacility-Extended  Fund Facility  (PRGF-EFF)  arrangements  to  stabilize  foreign  reserves.  World \nBank  has  provided  assistances  in,  among  other  things,  Country  Financial  Accountability \nAssessment  (CFAA)  study  and  will  provide  technical  assistance  in  public  expenditure  review \nand  public  debt  management.  Other  assistance  includes  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme (UNDP) support for management information system (MIS) linkup between Finance \nCommission (FC) and Provincial Councils (PCs) and United States (US) Treasury Department \nsupport for budget operations (see Figure A.14 Structure of Reforms and Coordination). \n \nB. \n \nPEMS  has  strengthened  the  preparation  of  the  budget  by  introducing  means  to \n2. \nstrengthen  planning  and  programming  including  greater  integration  between  the  fiscal  and \nbudget  departments.  It  has  also  strengthened  expenditure  controls  resulting  from  the  PEMS\u2019 \nprior work on budget classification. The budget monitoring system has also been strengthened \nby introducing, on a pilot basis, elements of performance monitoring in land transport. \n \n3. \nPSRM  had  been  setting  the  groundwork  for  the  creation  of  the  Sri  Lanka  Revenue \nAuthority (SLRA). In view of the change in policy thrust following the elections in April 2004, an \nimplementation plan was designed based on the concept of the Modernization of the Revenue \nAdministration (Appendix 6). Key inputs under the TA include the preparation of a blueprint for \nthe modernized revenue administration (MRA) including a supporting time-bound action plan. \n \nC. \n\nInternational Monetary Fund Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility-Extended \nFund Facility Arrangements \n\nAsian Development Bank Technical Assistance \n\n \n\n4. \nOn  18  April  2003,  IMF  approved  a  3-year  program  under  the  Poverty  Reduction  and \nGrowth  Facility  (PRGF)  and  the  Extended  Fund  Facility  (EFF)  arrangements,  in  an  amount  of \nSDRs269 million under PRGF plus SDR144.4 million under EFF.3 \n \n5. \nThe PRGF-EFF program aims to assist in restructuring the economy with the main focus \non  fiscal  consolidation,  given  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  high  debt  burden.  During  the  3-year  period,  the \nGovernment  and  IMF  agreed  on  program  monitoring  and  review  that  consists  of  a  set  of \nquantitative performance criteria and a structural performance criterion and benchmarks. Under \nthe program, specific ceilings and floors for fiscal indicators were set including (i) net domestic \nfinancing  of  the  central  government  budget,  (ii)  primary  fiscal  deficit,  (iii)  central  government \nrevenue,  (iv)  net  claims  on  government  by  the  banking  system,  and  (v)  credit  to  public \n\n                                                 \n1  TA 3301-SRI commenced in January 2000 and was finalized in July 2003. \n2  TA 3906-SRI commenced in November 2002 and will be finalized in September 2003. \n3  The approved amount of PRGF arrangement is SDR269 million (65 % of quota). That of EFF arrangement is SDR \n\n144.4 million (35% of quota). \n\n \n\n\f78 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\ncorporations  by  the  banking  system.  These  targets  were  derived  from  the  medium-term  fiscal \ntargets  to  reduce  the  budget  deficit,  on  average,  by  about  1.25%  of  GDP  per  year,  i.e.,  from \n8.9% of GDP in 2002 to 7.5% for 2003 and 4.3% by 2006. By 2006, the debt-to-GDP ratio was \ntargeted to reach 84% and interest rate payments to amount to 5.5% to GDP. To date, IMF has \ndisbursed only SDRs38.4 million from the PRGF and SDRs20.7 million from EFF. \n\n6. \nThe  second  tranche  of  the  PRGF  was  originally  due  in  December  2003.  However, \nfollowing  political  developments  linked  to  the  president\u2019s  dismissal  of  two  cabinet  ministers  in \nNovember 2003, the Government\u2019s resolve to pass through critical legislation was affected and \nconsequently the second tranche was suspended. However, following the April 2004 elections \nand  the  formation  of  a  new  Government,  the  Government  has  prepared  its  Economic  Policy \nFramework, including key macroeconomic and sector policies. The Government has met twice \nwith  IMF,  once  at  the  sideline  of  the  IMF/World  Bank  Annual  Meetings  in  early  October  2004 \nand the second time during an IMF consultation mission to Colombo on 18\u201322 October 2004. \nThis has led to preliminary policy dialogue on the Government\u2019s macroeconomic and medium-\nterm fiscal programs in preparation for the 2005 budget. Looking forward, the Government will \nbe  finalizing  its  economic  policy  framework  action  plans  and  will  be  presenting  its  findings  to \ndevelopment  partners  in  early  2005.  In  the  circumstances,  a  revised  PRGF  is  not  likely  to  be \nrenewed before early 2005. \n\nD. \n\nWorld Bank  \n\n7. \nDuring  the  reform  period,  the  World  Bank  has  planned  to provide  nonlending  technical \nassistance  in  the  public  sector  through  a  continuous  and  yearly  updated  public  expenditure \nanalysis  and  country  financial  accountability  assessment  (CFAA).4  The  public  expenditure \nanalysis for 2003 commenced in August 2003. The CFAA was finalized in June 2003.  \n\n8. \nCFAA  is  a  tool  designed  to  assess  the  urgent  reforms  needed  to  arrest  further \ndeterioration  in  public  financial  accountability.  The  assessment  covers  several  areas  including \n(i) parliamentary control of public funds, (ii) public financial management and reporting practices \nat  the  three  levels  of  government  including  public  enterprises,  (iii)  public  audit,  (iv)  legislative \nscrutiny  of  public  funds,  and  (v)  rights  to  information.  CFAA  suggests  two  broad  areas  in \nresponse  to  address  the  problem.  The  first  area  is  institutional  reforms.  New  legislation  and \nrules  are  needed  to  address  institutional  issues.  The  second  area  is  capacity  building  for \ntraining and improving organizational efficiency and effectiveness. \n\nIn terms of lending program, the World Bank approved on 17 June 2003 a $125 million \n9. \nPoverty  Reduction  Support  Credit  (PRSC)  for  Sri  Lanka  that  built  upon  Regaining  Sri  Lanka. \nPRSC aimed at strengthening governance in the public sector, implementing reforms in financial \nmanagement  and  accountability,  and  addressing  vital  issues  in  environmental  management. \nPRSC is a new lending instrument of the World Bank\u2019s International Development Association, \ndesigned to assist with the policy and institutional reforms that governments have formulated to \nimplement  their  own  poverty  reduction  strategies.  Unlike  earlier  policy  reform  support \ninstruments, PRSC is placed firmly within the Government\u2019s 3- to 4-year program, and a series \nof  such  credits  over  time  is  envisaged.  Note  that  PRSC  carries  no  policy  conditions,  since  it \nrecognizes progress achieved to date. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n4  Country  Assistance  Strategy  of  the  World  Bank  Group  for  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka.  World \n\nBank. April 23, 2003. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n79 \n\nIt was envisaged that a second PRSC would follow in 2004, a third in 2005, and a fourth \n10. \nin  2006  in  the  amount  of  $90  million  each  year.  The  2004  PRSC  expected  to  focus  on  civil \nservice reforms is now delayed in the wake of the change of Government and in anticipation of \nthe  new  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper.  The  PRSC  carries  no  interest  and  0.75%  service \ncharge, maturing in 40 years with a 10-year grace period. \n\nOthers \n\nE. \n \nThe  United  Nations  Development  Programme  has  provided  assistance  for  MIS  linkup \n11. \nbetween  PCs  and  FC,  to  facilitate  the  flow  of  financial  information  across  sublevels  of \ngovernment. Additional assistance will be required for strengthening FC\u2019s capacity. \n \nThe  US  Treasury  Department  has  also  provided  a  budget  advisor  to  the  Ministry  of \n12. \nFinance  for  a  2-year  assignment  beginning  in  mid-2003,  mostly  focusing  on  performance \nbudgeting and operational support. \n \nThe  Government  of  Korea  is  providing  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  a  loan  for  the \n13. \nprocurement of a Public Accounting and Financial Management Information System (PAFMIS). \nAccording to the feasibility study, the system will include three major procedures: (i) preparation \nof  budget  estimates  (budgeting),  (ii)  distribution  of  treasury  (warrant),  and  (iii)  consolidation  of \nexpenditure summaries (accounting).  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n
