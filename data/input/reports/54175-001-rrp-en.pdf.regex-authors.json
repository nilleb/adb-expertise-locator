THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nemergency assistance loan and grant, both to the Kyrgyz Republic for the COVID-19 Pandemic \nEmergency Project.  \n \n2.  The proposed project is part of an integral package of support to help the government\u2019s \nimmediate  efforts  to  mitigate  the  significant  health,  social,  and  economic  impacts  of  the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The project will assist the Government of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic to improve testing, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 cases to reduce transmission \nand improve clinical management of patients. The project will also improve government resilience \nto future health pandemics and disasters. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2019, COVID-19 emerged and quickly spread \naround the world, causing a surge in fatalities, especially among people with comorbidities.1 The \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. Since then, \nover 6 million people had been infected globally and over 373,000 had died as of 2 June 2020.2 \nThe Government of the Kyrgyz Republic announced the first three cases of COVID-19 on 17 \nMarch 2020 and declared a state of emergency on 24 March 2020. By 2 June 2020, there were \n1,845 infected people, of whom 20% were health workers. With 83% of health workers being \nfemale, women outnumber men among the infected people. A model of the global impact of \nCOVID-19 predicts that many more people could become infected and require hospital care, with \ndevastating  health  and  socioeconomic  impacts.3  The  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  currently \nanticipates the pandemic will peak in the second quarter of 2020, but a second or third wave is \nalso possible as the country considers loosening restrictions and restarting economic activity. \n \n4.  Socioeconomic impact. The Kyrgyz Republic, with a population of about 6.3 million and \nestimated gross national income per capita of $1,220 (Atlas method, 2018 prices), is one of the \nmost integrated and open economies in Central Asia.4 The country is at high risk to the impacts \nof  the  pandemic  through  its  significant  migrant  population  and  exposure  to  cross-border \ncontamination stemming from high volumes of travel within neighboring countries.5 The economic \ndisruption caused by border closures and emergency lockdown measures have created a large \nfiscal deficit, estimated at $722 million by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).6  \n \n5.  The pandemic has resulted in widespread job losses, particularly for those involved in the \nindustry and service sectors (which account for 70% of all employment). The Ministry of Social \nProtection and Labor identified around 1.8 million people (about 30% of the population) who will \nneed direct social protection support during the economic downturn, including about 1.0 million \n \n1  Comorbidities are defined as the simultaneous presence of multiple conditions in a patient. Patients with diabetes, \nhypertension, and other cardiovascular conditions appear more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19.  \n2  WHO. COVID-19 Dashboard.

The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) estimates that the poverty rate could increase by 26% because of COVID-19 and result in \nan additional 200,000 people falling into poverty.8 \n \n6.  Government response. The government adopted its first legislation to address COVID-\n19 on 29 January 2020.9 The government requested ADB for emergency assistance on 6 April \n2020. To coordinate the COVID-19 response, the Republican Headquarters for the Prevention of \nthe Spread of COVID-19 was established in the Ministry of Emergency Services with the Prime \nMinister of the Kyrgyz Republic as chair and representatives of all ministries and state agencies \nas members. To respond to the substantial adverse impact of COVID-19, the government has \ndeveloped a  $248 million  COVID-19 countercyclical  plan  and health sector response  plan \ncovering population security and food security, business entities, state budget stability, and \nhealth. A separate COVID-19 headquarters was established in the MOH to manage the health \nsector response.10 The government prepared the National Contingency Action Plan (NCAP) for \nCOVID-19  response  with  partners  led  by  WHO  and  activated  intersector  and  interagency \ncoordination mechanisms.11 \n \n7.  Damage and needs assessment. The NCAP is the first part of the government\u2019s strategic \nresponse, focused on the health sector, to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. It \nemphasizes reducing transmission, mortality, and socioeconomic impact, and is expected to cost \n$88 million to implement, assuming 4,000 cases. As stated in the NCAP, the government aims to \n(i) ensure early identification of cases and their safe and effective management; (ii) reduce the \nseverity of disease by providing clinical care, especially to vulnerable populations; (iii) ensure \ncontingencies are in place to avoid disruption of essential medical services; and (iv) minimize \nsocietal disruption by guiding business continuity.  \n \n8.  The capacity of the government and the overall health system to deal with the outbreak \neffectively is low. Therefore as an immediate first step, the country instituted drastic measures to \nprevent the further spread of the pandemic by imposing border restrictions; instituting a lockdown \non the population; closing most businesses, shopping areas, and banks across the country; and \nsuspending international and domestic flights. The MOH also introduced risk communication \nmeasures and isolation and quarantine of people suspected of having COVID-19 infection, and \ntheir contacts. Development partners have supported expansion of the COVID-19 surveillance \nand testing system from two laboratories to seven. Laboratory staff have been trained in technical \nand safety procedures. However, more contact tracing and testing capacity will be required to \ncontain the predicted surge in cases and before the lockdown can be relaxed.12  \n \n7  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 2018.

The Headquarters consists of all ministries and state agencies, including the MOH, Ministry of \nEmergency Situations, Ministry of Interior, State National Security Agency, State Committee for Defense, Security \nCouncil, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Culture and Tourism, \nMinistry of Transportation and Roads, State Border Service, State Custom Service, Veterinary Service, and \nPhytosanitary Agency. \n10 The deputy minister of health is the executive representative and a secretariat in the Department of State Sanitary \nand Epidemiology Control. \n11 Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2020.

For stage one of the pandemic, the government designated 12 hospitals in the cities of \nBishkek and Osh and four regions (Chui, Jalal-Abad, Batken and Osh) as COVID-19 treatment \ncenters, with a total capacity of 950 beds including 87 intensive care beds. For stage two of the \npandemic, an additional 21 hospitals have  been identified throughout the country, with  an \nadditional 1,315 beds including 139 intensive care beds. With effective lockdown, these facilities \nshould, with some adaptation, be enough to handle a slow surge in COVID-19 inpatients, but a \nshortage of intensive care beds is projected as the pandemic progresses. While the MOH can \nmobilize more health workers, there is a shortage of trained intensive care staff.13 The Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2019s public health spending of about 6.2% of gross domestic product in 2017 is insufficient \nto handle a surge in COVID-19 inpatients.14 Health facilities  are overwhelmed, which also \nthreatens the delivery of essential health services including vaccinations. \n \n10.  Furthermore, these facilities are not up to safety and quality standards for COVID-19 case \nmanagement in terms of quarantine and waste management, medical supplies, and personal \nprotective equipment (PPE). WHO\u2019s assessment of hospitals in the Kyrgyz Republic found that \nstaff and visitors were ill-informed about risks and quarantine and care protocols.15 Medical \npersonnel account for  21% of confirmed infections, suggesting that the capacity to prevent \ntransmission in facilities may be very low. Additional detail can be found in the  Summary \nAssessment of Damage and Needs.16 \n \n11.  Emergency assistance  coordination. ADB is coordinating with other development \npartners on all potential areas for support.17 In February 2020, the government reached out \nthrough the Development Partners Coordination Council to mobilize resources. The IMF approved \ntwo consecutive loans totaling $241.80 million to address the fiscal gap of the government budget. \nOn 3 April 2020, the World Bank approved a $12.15 million loan primarily for the purchase of \nmedical supplies and equipment for intensive care units (ICUs) as part of its COVID-19 response, \nand will allocate $9.00 million from its ongoing Enhancing Resilience in the Kyrgyz Republic \nProject to support social protection measures.18 ADB approved a $50.00 million budget-support \nCOVID-19  Active  Response  and  Expenditure  Support  Program  on  4  May  2020.19  Other \ndevelopment partners have established crisis responses such as training and provision of medical \nsupplies. ADB and World Bank teams have preliminarily agreed to conduct joint review missions \nand will be supporting separate treatment facilities, while WHO ensures overall emergency \ncoordination in line with the NCAP to fight COVID-19. \n \n12.  Lessons learned. The government and development partners  are learning lessons \nthrough regular communication and coordination given the unique nature of the COVID-19 \npandemic. The World Bank project for COVID-19 has shown the need for maintaining flexible \nprocurement and implementation arrangements, and that health facilities require flexible funds \nwhich can be used to respond to emerging needs resulting from the pandemic. ADB\u2019s experience \nin supporting countries during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak shows the \n \n13 There are 29,502 health workers in the Kyrgyz Republic, including 8,322 physicians and 21,180 mid-level health \nworkers. \n14 WHO.

During the first critical months, ADB \npartnered with technical agencies such as WHO to assist governments to develop rapid and \neffective responses while longer-term capacity building needs were identified.20  \n \n13.  Proposed ADB assistance. This project will provide the most urgently needed supplies \nand equipment and strengthen the health sector to address the top priorities of mortality and \nmorbidity. This project will support the priorities of (i) increasing testing and diagnostic capacity; \n(ii) supporting the protection of health care workers including appropriate specifications of PPE \nand related support for the high proportion of female health care workers; (iii) strengthening \ninstitutional capacity and accountability mechanisms of government to respond to the crisis; and \n(iv) supporting expansion of treatment capacity including for severely ill patients. The proposed \nproject aligns with five operational priorities within Strategy 2030: (i) addressing poverty and \nreducing inequalities, through improved health access; (ii) accelerating gender equality, through \noccupational safety and training targets for women; (iii) tackling climate change and building \nclimate and disaster resilience and enhancing environmental sustainability, through improving \nhealth sector capacity; (iv) strengthening governance and institutional capacity; and (v) fostering \nregional cooperation, through reducing risks of cross-border disease transmission.21 \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n14.  Impact and outcome. The project is aligned with the following impact: to strengthen the \npublic health system and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the Kyrgyz Republic \n(footnote 11). The project will have the following outcome: capacity in the health system to mitigate \nCOVID-19 improved.22   \n \n15.  Output  1:  Capacity  of  surveillance  and  response  services  to  COVID-19 \nstrengthened. The project will help mitigate the surge in COVID-19 cases by increasing health \nsystem capacity to identify and diagnose potentially infected people and improve contact tracing \nfor isolation of cases. The output will support the procurement of PPE, test kits, reagents, and \nother supplies to increase screening, testing, and prevention of COVID-19 for the sanitary and \nepidemiological services of the MOH, the COVID-19 laboratories, and other key health facilities \nas agreed with the MOH. Health workers and facility staff who are at highest risk of infection will \nhave increased access to diagnostic services.  \n \n16.  Output 2: Capacity for infection prevention control and quality of care for COVID-19 \npatients improved. This output is aligned with the Government\u2019s objective to mitigate the impact \nof the epidemic, by providing improved clinical care of COVID-19 and avoiding disruption of \nessential services. The project will improve eight hospitals that have been designated as COVID-\n19 treatment centers. These comprise five hospitals for stage one in Bishkek, Osh, and Jalalabad \nrequiring additional support; and three hospitals for stage two in Naryn, Talas, and Issyk-Kul \nregion. These hospitals currently have 792 beds with 81 intensive care beds. The hospitals were \nselected on the basis of COVID-19 cases, geographical coverage, existing capacity to manage \ninfectious diseases, support from other donors, and projected need for additional ICU beds.  \n \n17.  The project will assist these hospitals to function as COVID-19 treatment centers including \nstaff training, quarantine, and infection prevention control arrangements and expansion of ICU by \n \n20 ADB. 2011.

To ensure the hospitals are well-prepared and staffed to provide quality \nCOVID-19 treatment, the project will also provide funds for (i) staff incentives in the form of \nhardship allowances as approved by government regulation,23 (ii) minor repairs and refurbishment \nof facilities,24 and (iii) improvement of facilities for hospital staff and including separate changing \nand resting facilities for male and female health workers. The enhanced capacity of the eight \nhospital facilities will strengthen the resilience of the country to future outbreaks and pandemics.25  \n \n18.  Emergency assistance eligibility. The proposed emergency assistance loan and grant \nmeets the eligibility criteria for ADB\u2019s emergency assistance financing as (i) it helps refurbish high-\npriority physical assets, such as hospitals and medical facilities, and restore economic, social, \nand governance activities by improving confidence in public health capacity so that regular \nactivities may resume; (ii) it is designed to mitigate immediate losses to priority assets, capacity, \nor productivity (such as health care workers); (iii) it provides immediate short-term transitional \nassistance; (iv) it is restricted to the transition phase and is exclusively for priority rehabilitation; \nand (v) it complements efforts by other development partners to ease the transition from relief to \nnormal development. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB  \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s overall support to the government will mitigate economic losses and help close the \nfinancing gap in the government\u2019s budget to meeting essential expenditures in 2020. This project \nis part of a comprehensive package of support to the Kyrgyz Republic, including immediate \nsupport in the form of (i) a $200,000 technical assistance grant and additional financing of \n$700,000 from ADB regional technical assistance to procure emergency supplies including PPE;26 \n(ii) a joint ADB\u2013\u2013United Nations Development Programme socioeconomic study of the impact of \nthe pandemic on the country\u2019s poor and vulnerable communities; and (iii) an approved $50 million \nCOVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program, under the countercyclical support \nfacility\u2013\u2013COVID-19 pandemic response option. ADB and the government are discussing an \nadditional $50 million policy-based loan in 2020 for social protection and fiscal resilience.27 In \naddition, ADB will provide additional medium-term support to the government through the regional \ntechnical  assistance  for  Addressing  Health  Threats  in  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  \nCooperation Countries and Central West Region Developing Member Countries.28 As a trusted \npartner in the Kyrgyz Republic, ADB is providing financing, knowledge and technical support. \n \n23 The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic issued regulation No.194, dated 3 April 2020, \u201cRegulation of the ordinance \nof the spending of the funds received for the support of the pandemic measures and its operating mechanism,\u201d which \nadds a hardship allowance to health and other workers supporting facilities fighting COVID-19. The allowance in a \nform of nonrefundable payment is payable through the Mandatory Health Insurance Fund (MHIF), which supports a \nsingle payer system in health care and has adequate facilities to track transactions and e-procurement.  \n24 Minor repairs and refurbishment of facilities cover repair of handwashing and hygiene facilities, electrical and sewage \nrepairs, staff and patient safety, repair of health wards to convert them to ICUs where new equipment will be placed, \nand meeting temporary housing needs for health workers. \n25 Support for health workers allowances beyond the 8 facilities will be considered depending on the scale of the \noutbreak and once detailed costs for supporting the 8 facilities are determined during implementation. \n26 ADB. 2020.

The loan will have an interest \ncharge at the rate of 1% per year; a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years; \nrepayment of principal at 2% per year for the first 10 years after the grace period and 4% per year \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \n22.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. The ADB loan and grant will be applied in \nparallel  manner,  with  grant  funds  prioritized  for  imported  goods  and  equipment  because \nprocurement using grant funds is exempt from customs duties. The ADB loan and grant will be \nfinancing goods, civil works, consulting services, and hardship allowances as set out in the \ndetailed cost estimates in the PAM (footnote 29). The government will provide in-kind support in \nthe form of exemptions of customs duties and taxes on grants, and project management support. \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nOrdinary capital resources (concessional loan)  10.0  46.0 \nSpecial Funds resources (ADF grant)  10.0  46.0 \nGovernment (in-kind only)  1.7  8.0 \nTotal  21.7  100.0 \nADF = Asian Development Fund. \nNote: The project will be funded by a portion of the performance-based country allocation in concessional ordinary \ncapital resources lending (COL) and some freed-up ADF grant resources from savings and cancellations of ongoing \nprojects in countries eligible for ADF grants. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n29 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  The project will be implemented over 18 months from June 2020 to December 2021. The \nloan and grant are expected to be financially closed by 30 June 2022. The implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and- described in detail in the PAM (footnote 29). The \nMOH will be the executing agency and will appoint a senior staff member as the project director. \nThe MOH project implementation unit (PIU) will be the primary implementing agency, while \nfiduciary and disbursement functions will be provided by the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The PIU \nwill report both to the MOH and the MOF. The MOH will be responsible and accountable for \nprocurement, coordinating with other development partners, monitoring and evaluating project \nindicators, and gender targets. Individual consultants will be recruited by the MOH as needed to \nsupport with monitoring and evaluation, procurement, civil works monitoring, procurement, and \nother  implementation  activities.  The  MOF  will  be  responsible  for  financial  management, \ndisbursements, contract management, financial reporting, project records management,  and \naudits management.  \n \n24.  The Mandatory Health Insurance Fund (MHIF) will administer funds for refurbishment of \neight hospital and top-up salary and hardship allowances to health workers under output 2, \namounting to $2 million. The MHIF\u2019s role will be limited to transferring funds; collecting supporting \ndocuments  from  the  eight  hospitals;  recording  individual  contracts  for  refurbishment  and \nmonitoring the contractual payment compliance; recording additional payments to individual \nhealth workers; and preparing financial reporting of activities at the hospital level for the eight \nproject facilities.30 The arrangements for funds transfer will follow the same mode agreed between \nthe government and the World Bank, subject to ADB\u2019s review and approval, and will be updated \nin the PAM.31 Eligible items to be financed include refurbishment and repair of health facilities, \nand installation of equipment and related utilities. The funds may also be used to top up the salary \nand hardship allowance to health workers engaged in the COVID-19 response.  \n \n25.  Procurement. Considering the unique nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing \nglobal shortage of goods required to respond to the health crisis, value for money will be achieved \nby balancing the time, quality, and cost. Direct contracting with MOH established suppliers, World \nBank suppliers, and/or United Nations agencies will be conducted to assure consistent quality of \nproducts and to attain the best price. Goods will be procured using the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as \namended from time to time), as well as the additional exemptions as endorsed per ADB\u2019s \ncomprehensive response to the COVID-19 pandemic.32 Procurement could involve suppliers from \nnon-ADB member countries, and at government request ADB will apply universal procurement \n(footnote 32). Details on procurement arrangements are found in the PAM. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  June 2020 to December 2021 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2021 \n \n30 The MHIF was established in 1996, through health sector reform, as a single purchaser to pool funds at the national \nlevel for standardized packages of services. This helped to shift health care services from input- to output-based \nbudgeting (i.e., capitation for primary health care and case-based payments for secondary care services). The MHIF \nwas  supported  through  the  ADB  Technical  Assistance  for  the  Second  Community-Based  Early  Childhood \nDevelopment project, and by a number of World Bank projects. \n31 World Bank. 2020.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n26.  All  components  of  the  project  are  technically  viable,  based  on  needs  assessment \nconducted by the MOH and WHO.  Project activities are based on key mitigation priorities \nidentified in the NCAP and are based on global best practices, tailored for the local context. By \nfocusing on a small number of facilities for treating COVID-19, resources and staff can be \ndeployed more efficiently. Equipment and infrastructure provided to facilities will be standardized \nwith those provided by other donors to ensure compatibility and minimize training requirements. \nThe project has a low climate risk category as project sites will be in urban and/or semi-urban \nareas with limited to no direct risks from climatic conditions. The activities supported by this project \nwill contribute to increased resilience to future pandemics by increasing the capacity of hospitals \nand the health workforce on infection prevention control and clinical management of patients. \n ", "9 \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n27.  Preliminary  analysis  by  ADB  shows  that  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  will  suffer  significant \neconomic impact because of the COVID-19 pandemic, with estimated losses of up to $529 \nmillion.33 The project outputs will save lives and address short-term gaps in the health system. \nFinancial viability assessment is not necessary since project outputs are public service goods with \nno opportunity for cost recovery as testing and treatment of COVID-19 are sponsored by the \nGovernment of the Kyrgyz Republic.34 Because of the short processing time available for the \nemergency response, due diligence following ADB guidelines on economic analysis will be \nconducted during project implementation within 3 months of project effectiveness.35 The MOF will \nprovide necessary information to ADB to undertake the project economic analysis, in compliance \nwith ADB requirements. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n28.  The operation and maintenance costs of the project assets will be funded through the \nMOH\u2019s recurrent budget. While the contracts for procurement of equipment under the project will \nensure supplier-provided maintenance over the short term, the government\u2019s commitment to \nensure adequate budget allocations for operations and maintenance post-COVID-19 project will \nbe covenanted in the financing agreement and monitored during project implementation. In view \nof expected adverse macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Kyrgyz Republic, \npublic debt levels are expected to peak at 66% of gross domestic product in 2020.36 Therefore, \nduring implementation a loan covenant will ensure that the MOH submits a comprehensive \nfinancial analysis of the operation and maintenance costs for project assets. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n29.  ADB completed a governance risk assessment in 2018 according to the implementation \nguidelines of ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan. The assessment found \nthat the country\u2019s public financial management systems were functioning well overall and had \nimproved in the areas of budgeting, transparency, Treasury functions, tax administration, debt \nmanagement, financial reporting, and legislative framework (new budget code). However, several \nweaknesses remain, including investment planning and estimation of expenditures, off-budget \nfunds, financial management information system, and internal and external audits, which are \nbeing addressed through a 3-year World Bank and European Union technical assistance project. \n \n30.  The financial management assessment concluded that project financial management risk \nis substantial, because of the emergency nature of the project; the potential adverse impacts of \nweak internal and external audit arrangements on the internal controls framework; the limited \nstrength of finance and internal audit staff within the MOF, MOH, and MHIF; and the potential \nmisuse of funds by target hospitals and staff incentive payments. Key risk mitigating strategies \nare set out in the financial management assessment. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government.  The  specific \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 29). \n \n33 ADB. 2020. The Economic Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Developing Asia. Manila. \n34 The MHIF has established a hospital reimbursement rate of Som9,000 per treated case, which is likely insufficient to \ncover costs incurred by hospitals.  \n35 ADB. 2017.

Kyrgyz Republic\u2014Request for Purchase Under the Rapid Financing Instrument and Disbursement under \nthe Rapid Credit Facility\u2014Debt Sustainability Analysis. Washington, DC. \n ", "10 \n31.  As per ADB\u2019s project procurement risk assessment, procurement risk is medium mainly \nbecause of limited experience with ADB procurement procedures  and the smaller size of \npackages. Accordingly, capacity of the PIU will be enhanced with additional consultants and close \nsupervision by project staff, and direct contracting through United Nations agencies will be \nencouraged  to  leverage  buying  power.  The  government  is  also  planning  to  strengthen \nprocurement rules to enhance transparency, including subjecting all procurement of emergency \nsupplies to an ex-post audit by the Audit Chamber with results published on the MOF website.  \n \nE.  Poverty and Social \n \n32.  During 2012\u20132018, the poverty rate in the Kyrgyz Republic dropped from 38% to 22%.37 \nIn the Kyrgyz Republic as elsewhere, the COVID-19 pandemic will have a much higher impact on \nthe poor and near-poor as a result of lower access to information and services, lockdown resulting \nin loss of jobs during and after the pandemic, and the increasing cost of food and medical and \nother services. The project will benefit all citizens of the Kyrgyz Republic including the poor by \npreventing or mitigating the impact of COVID-19 and comorbidity through provision of inclusive \nhealth services and improved well-being.  \n \nF.  Gender \n \n33.  The project\u2019s gender categorization is effective gender mainstreaming. Initial evidence \nsuggests that, globally, COVID-19 affects men more than women. However, infections in women \noutnumber men in the Kyrgyz Republic, with 53% of cases in females. Women predominate in \nthe health services, with 83% of the health workers being female, placing women most at risk of \ncontracting an occupational COVID-19 infection. The government is developing testing protocols \nthat will proactively increase access to testing for health workers, and prioritize testing based on \nrisk. The government has also approved a resolution (footnote 23) that outlines additional \nremuneration for health workers involved in COVID-19 treatment and control. These measures \nare expected to benefit and compensate health workers for the additional risks and workload \ncaused by the COVID-19 response. \n \n34.  Equipment designed for men may not fit women properly. Adequate and gender-sensitive \nfacilities are also important. This project will support provision of sanitation measures for medical \nstaff; separate changing rooms for men and women; and rest areas for female doctors, nurses, \nand other facility staff. Training and retraining for medical personnel involved in COVID-19 patient \ncare will be provided to quickly train staff to safely care for patients and themselves. To ensure \neffective gender mainstreaming in the project, the following gender designs and targets have been \nagreed with the MOH: (i) equal access to testing; (ii) targets for providing incentives to female \nhealth workers; (iii) capacity building and training on appropriate use of PPE, infection prevention, \nand patient management; (iv) gender-sensitive changing and rest areas for health workers; and \n(v) provision of appropriate PPE and sanitary supplies.  \n \nG.  Safeguards \n \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.38 \n \n \n37 ADB. Basic Statistics, Asia and the Pacific (accessed 2 June 2020). \n38 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "11 \n36.  Environment (category C). The proposed project will cover urgent priorities, such as \nPPE, medical equipment for ICUs, and laboratory supplies. There may be very small-scale \nrefurbishment works for preparing the infrastructure for the equipment within the existing facilities. \nHence, minimal environmental impacts are envisaged. Category C for environmental safeguards \nhas therefore been proposed. A code of construction practice has been prepared and attached to \nthe PAM and will be implemented to address the limited environmental impacts. \n \n37.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples (category C). The project will not \nresult in any new land acquisition as civil works will entail minor refurbishment and repair of \nexisting medical facilities. Site-based social due diligence will be performed based on a screening \nchecklist to confirm no impacts related to economic displacement and restriction of access in land \nuse. Should due diligence confirm occurrence of adverse land acquisition and resettlement \nimpacts, the project will be recategorized accordingly and measures will be taken to mitigate such \nimpacts. Ethnic minorities in the proposed urban project sites constitute about 10% of the \npopulation and are economically fully integrated and at parity with the Kyrgyz. These minorities \nare not considered indigenous as defined by the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement for project \noperation purposes.   \n \nH.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n38.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.39  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nLimited capacity of MOH to adequately assess  PIU staff will be engaged to support the MOH to assess needs \nneeds and capacities at the facility level  and capacities at facility level.
