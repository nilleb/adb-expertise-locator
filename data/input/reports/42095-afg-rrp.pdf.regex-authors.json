The Investment Program \nhas  the  required  environmental  and  social  safeguard  frameworks. \nIndividual tranches or batches of subprojects are backed by safeguards \nplans. The project financed from the first tranche (Tranche 1 Project) has \nbeen subjected to due diligence work on environmental and social aspects. \nIndigenous  People\u2019s  issues  are  not  considered  relevant  in  this  case. \nThe  Tranche  1  Project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  the  purpose  of \nenvironmental  safeguards.  Subsequent  tranche  projects  will  follow  the \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  and  the  resettlement \nframework, prepared by the Ministry of Public Works (MPW), examined and \nendorsed as sound by ADB. These frameworks (shown in Appendix 10 and \nSupplementary Appendix D respectively) set out the policies, principles, \nand procedures for assessing, managing, and monitoring environmental \nand resettlement impacts. The Tranche 1 Project does not involve any \nsignificant land acquisition or resettlement issues. \n   \nInvestment  The Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS), launched by the \nProgram  Government  in  April  2008,  is  the  country\u2019s  strategic  platform  for \ndevelopment over the period of 2008\u20132020. Its aim is to promote growth, \ngenerate wealth, and cut poverty and vulnerability. ANDS goes across all \nkey sectors and subsectors. It also embraces several themes. One of the \nmain sectors is transport and logistics. The strategy sets out quantitative \nand  qualitative  targets  (physical  and  nonphysical)  and  covers  various \nsystems,  including  roads  and  railways.  Within  the  road  subsector,  the \nstrategy  caters  for  national,  provincial,  rural,  and  city  roads,  and \nemphasizes  the  construction  of  new  assets  and  the  management, \nmaintenance, and repair of existing ones. The underlying objective is to \nimprove  connectivity  (within  the  country  and  with  neighboring  borders), \nimprove efficiency and safety of travel and goods transport, and strengthen \ninstitutions. Within the roads arena, the national roads take priority over the \nothers, at least in the short to medium term (next 7 years). \n \nThe proposed MFF finances a slice of a broad Investment Program over \nthe  medium  term.  It  focuses  on  the  national  roads.  This  slice  of  the \nInvestment  Program  combines  physical  investments  with  institutional \nchanges. The physical part of the overall Investment Program involves \nconstructing about 2,900 kilometers (km) of national roads and maintaining \n ", "ii   \n \nabout  1,500  km  of  existing  ones.  This  is  to  be  done  by  2013.  The \nnonphysical part of the Investment Program includes the reorganization of \nMPW,  the  creation  of  a  new  agency  to  deal  with  national  roads,  the \nestablishment  of  a  maintenance  facility,  introduction  of  improved  traffic \nsafety  procedures,  and  the  execution  of  training  programs  to  improve \nplanning and project management. \n \nThe Investment Program is part of a road map or strategy for the sector \nspreading into the medium term. This strategy is aligned with ANDS and in \nline with the Government\u2019s current thinking on what ADB should do in the \ncountry. The latter is articulated in a country partnership strategy (CPS) \npaper, which is at an advanced stage of preparation. The CPS will be \nconsidered by the Board early in 2009. The CPS had been held back by the \npresentation of ANDS in Paris in the summer 2008, as well as by the \nrestructuring of the Resident Mission and ADF X negotiations. The main \ndirections taken in the CPS were presented to the Board at an informal \nseminar  in  2007.  This  MFF  submission  should  have  followed  the \npresentation of the CPS. The CPS calls on ADB to focus its action on three \nmain  areas:  infrastructure  (roads,  and  on  a  selective  basis,  railways), \npower and energy, and irrigation. The Government also wants ADB to set \naside an envelope every year to support reforms related to microfinance, \nbusiness climate improvement, and public financial resource management. \nRoads, energy, irrigation, and microfinance are the four areas where (i) the \nGovernment has a need and wants ADB\u2019s involvement, and (ii) ADB has \nskills, knowledge/information, and track record. These are also the areas \nwhere ADB compares well with other development partners. On the other \nhand, ADB has been less active in the social services fields. Other donors \nhave been more active and stronger in these areas. The CPS also caters \nfor work on institutional effectiveness, particularly in relation to the bodies \nmanaging the priority sectors. There will be several levels and types of \ninterventions here: training for better planning and project management; \ngender mainstreaming; financial management, anticorruption and fiduciary \noversight;  private  sector  development;  safeguards  (environmental  and \nsocial) policies and management; and regional cooperation. The CPS calls \non ADB to be more programmatic in terms of its financing approaches, in \nparticular to use whenever possible the MFF modality\u2014as a means of \nincreasing  the  profile  and  resource  envelope  for  implementation  work, \nreducing the incidence of cost overruns on projects (cost estimates change \ntoo quickly and by substantial amounts), and linking finance availability to \nproject readiness. \n \nThe MFF has been designed based on assessments over the past several \nyears  with  donors  including  ADB,  covering  technical,  operational, \ncommercial, legal, financial, and other matters. These assessments led to \nthe problem tree analysis by ADB as shown in Appendix 2. This problem \ntree leads to the investment proposal and that to the outcome shown in the \ndesign and monitoring framework (DMF) of the MFF as a whole, as well as \nfor the Tranche 1 Project. This DMF is shown in Appendix 1. Basically, the \ncurrent national roads network has two main problems: (i) it offers limited \ncoverage (not enough points in the country are interconnected) and quality \n(existing roads are in bad shape because of poor maintenance); and (ii) the \n ", "  iii\ninstitutions dealing with the sector are weak. These two problems take \nplace within an environment beset by insecurity, lack of financial resources \n(national and international), and inadequate qualified people to plan and \nmanage roads. \n \nThe proposed MFF has an important feature: it will address financing gaps \nin several ongoing road projects, including those financed by ADB. Several \nstrategic road projects are at risk of winding down because of mounting \nfinancing gaps; in most cases brought about by fast rising construction \ncosts. Increasing insurgency (making construction slower than it should) \nand the rapid escalation of fuel and material prices (including bitumen) are \nthe main contributors. Under normal circumstances and in line with loan \nagreements, the Government is required to make up for funding shortfalls. \nHowever, Afghanistan\u2019s budget also happens to be badly constrained at \npresent  (tax  revenues  are  down  and  capital  and  recurrent  expenditure \nneeds are up). This situation is making it difficult for the Government to \nmeet  obligations  under  civil  works  contracts.  The  MFF  will  provide \nfinancing for sound and strategic projects affected by these cost overruns \nand the Government\u2019s inability to pay (as opposed to changes in scope). \n \nAn important feature of the Investment Program is its inclusion of the basic \nneeds  of  communities  along  the  construction  routes.  Inadequate \nengagement of local communities and enterprises in past has contributed \nto  insurgent  threats.  The  Government  intends  to  use  the  Afghanistan \nReconstruction  Trust  Fund  to  finance  these  works,  which  will  include \nimproving  basic  small-scale  infrastructure\u2014drinking  water,  school,  and \nhealth clinic repairs, etc. This represents a \u201cwin-win\u201d proposition for all\u2014the \nGovernment, contractors, and consultants\u2014and will lead to greater buy-in \nfrom villages, and thereby lower security risks. \n   \nMultitranche  The Government has requested ADB to provide up to $400 million to help \nFinancing  finance the Investment Program through an MFF. The MFF is justified on \nFacility  several grounds and is considered superior to other modalities on offer. \nFirst,  the  MFF  fits  neatly  within  the  strategic  framework  that  ADB  has \nagreed with Afghanistan. Although the CPS still needs to be approved by \nthe Board, the main elements of the country strategy have been agreed \nwith the Government and are aligned to ANDS. Second, the MFF brings \nthe  analytical  work  upfront  and  then  releases  time  and  resources  for \nimplementation.  To  generate  outcome  and  impacts,  the  Investment \nProgram  must  improve  institutional  effectiveness,  but  also  increase \ncontract awards and disbursements. The MFF provides a good platform for \nestablishing a program management office (PMO) with core expertise in \nproject management and themes, but also for refocusing ADB\u2019s resources \nand skill mix in the field. The MFF allows parties to plan ahead and engage \nexperts for the long haul. Third, the MFF helps the country team plan and \nmanage the Asian Development Fund (ADF) envelope in a more effective \nmanner. Under the CPS business plan, ADB will work simultaneously in \ntransport, energy, irrigation, and reforms. The intention is to have the first \nthree supported through MFFs. This approach will allow the country to \ndraw finance from umbrella facilities in line with project readiness. This \nnot only improves ADF \u201ccash management\u201d, but also means \u201cfresher\u201d and \n ", "iv   \n \nmore reliable investment cost estimates in each of the sectors\u2014a source of \ngreat  concern  in  a  rapidly  changing  construction  cost  environment. \nFourth, although not perfect, the main pre-conditions for the use of the MFF \nare in place: road map, policy framework, investment plan, and financing \nplan. The policy framework is adequate, although this is the weakest of the \nfour pre-conditions for the MFF. The Government has established a set of \nbasic  principles  (including  cost  recovery,  maintenance  and  repair,  and \nfunding  thereof,  adherence  to  best  practice  on  construction  and \nsafeguards, governance, competition, and institutional restructuring), but \nmore  specifics  and  refinements  will  be  needed  over  time.  The  policy \nprinciples look fine on paper but the big issue is the capacity to provide \nproper follow-up and manage change, as and when needed. This gap is \nmostly  a  function  of  lack  of  qualified  personnel.  The  MFF  will  provide \nfinance to work on this. It will also provide advisory services to tighten the \nframework and monitor progress. The rest of the pre-conditions are in \nbetter shape. \n   \nRationale   Afghanistan\u2019s reconstruction and development need investments in many \nareas. Roads are one of these. Poor connectivity hampers investment, \ntrade, people\u2019s mobility, and ultimately job creation. This affects the cost of \ndoing business, but also prevents Afghanistan from becoming an attractive \ntransit option for Central Asian trade. Lack of enough and well maintained \nroads leaves rural areas isolated. This has a negative impact on growth \nand prospects for social inclusiveness, peace, and stability. Everyone is \naffected:  manufacturers,  public  and  private  sector  service  providers, \nfarmers, truckers, wholesalers, retailers, women, and children. The MFF \nmakes sense. One of its merits is to build not only new assets and maintain \nexisting ones, but also to work on the institutional front. \n   \nImpact and  The  problem  tree  analysis  attached  to  the  MFF  summarizes  the  core \nOutcome  problem in the transport sector, including the causes behind it. Afghanistan \nhas an inefficient and unsafe transport system\u2014with limited coverage and \nquality. The Investment Program is intended to fix this problem over time \n(see Design and Monitoring Framework shown in Appendix 1). \n   \nInvestment Plan  The investment plan for the Investment Program in the medium term is \nunder $1.3 billion. Over the longer haul, and with railways and other road \nclasses included, the size of the investment is several times higher than \nthis. The Investment Program costs will be shared by the international \nfinancing  institutions,  including  the  World  Bank  and  the  United  States \nAgency  for  International  Development  (USAID).  The  share  of  the \nInvestment  Program  costs  assigned  to  ADB  amounts  to  $400  million. \nThis is also related to the amount of finance potentially available from ADB \nunder ADF X, which includes an initial 2-year commitment of around $200 \nmillion a year. This might then be adjusted (up or down) depending on \nwhether  the  country  enters  the  performance  based  allocation  system. \nA decision on this will only be made at the mid-term review of ADF X.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  The financing plan for the Investment Program is being worked upon and \nremains  tentative  at  this  stage.  The  Government  has  had  detailed \ndiscussions  with  the  World  Bank,  USAID,  and  others.  At  this  stage, \n ", "  v\ncommitments from others are not yet firm, although it is a fact that the road \nsector figures prominently in the strategies of various organizations. The \nGovernment will also try to tap various bilateral agencies. ADB has had \nconsultations with the donors on the financing plan. So far, it has received \nfirm commitments only from some of them. The plan below is, therefore, \ntentative  and  does  not  commit  any  of  the  parties  to  the  Investment \nProgram. Fund raising work will need to be stepped up in the near future. \n \nTentative Financing Plan: 2008\u20132013 \n \nAmount \nSource  ($ million)  Percentage \nAsian Development Bank  400  32 \nWorld Bank  150  12 \nUnited States Agency for  400  32 \nInternational Development \nOthersa  300  24 \n    Total  1,250  100 \na  Includes the Government\u2019s resources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nThe Government plans to utilize the MFF in four tranches. With regard to \nthe Tranche 1 Project under the MFF, the financing plan will involve only \nADB at this stage. It will amount to $60 million, of which $45 million will be \nfor supplementary financing for civil works and $2 million on initial project \nmanagement work relating to existing projects. About $13 million will be in \nthe form of contingencies. The subsequent tranches will be for around \n$100 million each, except the fourth, which is estimated at $140 million. \nADB will seek cofinancing from third parties for these tranches. This work is \nunderway. \n   \nMFF Terms  Financing under the MFF will be made available in tranches from ADF \nresources.  The  maximum  amount  of  financing  extended  over  the  MFF \nperiod will be $400 million. However, this comes with some caveats. First, \nthe actual final amount made available will be subject to the size of the \nADF envelope. The latter has been agreed for the next three years (2008\u2013\n2010), and includes the last installment under the ADF IX period (2008) \nand the funding agreed for 2009\u20132010 under ADF X. Thereafter, and at the \nADF X mid-term review stage planned for 2010, there will be consultations \nbetween ADB and ADF donors regarding the application, or otherwise, of \nthe performance based allocation formula. The Government understands \nthat the ADB commitment is limited and contingent upon the availability of \nfunds. Although neither ADB nor the Government would be under any legal \nobligation to grant or receive funding, the so-called \u201cmoral hazard\u201d has \nbeen  taken  out  of  the  equation  during  the  MFF  negotiations.  Second, \nalthough, the first tranche financing will be extended on a grant basis, ADB \ncannot  commit  to  retaining  these  terms  and  conditions  during  the \navailability period of the MFF. \n \nAfghanistan will submit a periodic financing request (PFR) for each tranche, \nwhich will be reviewed by ADB in accordance with the framework financing \n ", "vi   \n \nagreement (FFA) between ADB and the Government. Specific terms of \neach tranche will be based on the related PFR. The first PFR is presented \nto ADB\u2019s Board of Directors, together with the MFF proposal and the FFA. \n   \nPeriod of  The last date on which disbursements under individual tranches can be \nUtilization  made is 31 December 2017. The last PFR has to be submitted no later \nthan 30 September 2012. The MFF for the Investment Program will lapse if \nthe legal agreement for the first tranche is not executed within 2 months \nfrom the date of the Management approval for execution of the agreement. \n   \nExecuting  Ministry of Public Works \nAgency \n   \nImplementation  The establishment of an efficient organizational structure, the appointment \nArrangements  of  experienced  personnel  to  it,  close  teamwork  and  sound  lines  of \ncommunication between MPW and ADB, are crucial to ensure the MFF \ngets implemented well and on time. The most critical of the challenges is \nthe limited supply of qualified national and international staff. This is partly \ndue  to the growing demand in and outside Afghanistan, as well as to \nsecurity induced migration. Achieving impact and outcome, and before that, \ncontract award and disbursements, will depend on these factors.  \n \nADB has prepared an implementation plan for the MFF and agreed with \nMPW a series of measures, including the creation of the PMO within its \nstructures. The PMO will be managed by a director with experience in \nproject  management.  It  will  have  separate  teams  to  oversee  different \naspects of the MFF and liaise with stakeholders. These teams will oversee \ntechnical and engineering functions under each contract, legal matters, due \ndiligence  on  new  projects,  safeguards,  finance  and  administration, \nevaluation,  monitoring  and  reporting,  and  results  measurement  and \ncapacity development (training, policy advisory, management information \nsystems and procedures). The PMO will engage the services of national \nand international staff. The budget to run it will cater for a core team of \nexperts  and  then  leave  sufficient  contingencies  to  engage  short-term \nadvisors to undertake specific jobs at short notice. The services of advisors \nwill be secured from firms and directly from individuals. \n \nThe PMO will establish a management information system and operate \nwithin the framework of the implementation plan included with the MFF. \nIt  will  become  the  main  point  of  contact  for  the  ADB  team  providing \noversight and guidance on implementation work. ADB itself has revamped \nits field presence with the appointment of operational and implementation \nexperts (covering each of the priority sectors included in the CPS). These \nindividuals  will  become  focal  points  for  the  MFF.  The  ADB  team  will \nmaintain daily communications with the PMO (see Figure A7.2 of Appendix \n7).  It  will  hold  weekly  meetings  with  the  PMO  team  to  review  the \nimplementation  schedule  (contract  awards,  disbursements,  payments, \nphysical completion, safeguards, etc.) under each project funded under the \nMFF. Any deviations from the original schedule will be discussed at the \nmeetings, and the management consultants will prepare and provide briefs \n \n ", "  vii\nto all parties on the actions taken or needed to be taken by the team. The \nADB team will hold monthly meetings with the deputy minister (Technical) \nof  MPW  and,  if  necessary,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  officials  to  review \nmonthly progress, and share the meeting brief with all team members. \n \nThe joint ADB and MPW team will also ensure the expeditious preparation \nand approval of future tranches by performing continuous due diligence \nfrom the outset. Additionally, the joint team will conduct biannual reviews of \ntranches and the MFF in March and October of each year, and closely \nmonitor the engagement and conduct of independent financial audits of \nproject  accounts,  as  well  as  of  procurement  and  operability  audits. \nA  MFF  administration  memorandum  has  been  drafted  and  shown  in \nSupplementary Appendix A. \n   \nMonitoring,  With the assistance of the PMO, MPW will analyze and report on baseline \nEvaluation,  data collected during consultations with stakeholders, field observations, \nReporting, and  and measurements within 6 months of the start of every works contract. \nMeasurement of  Thereafter,  the  PMO  will  collect  and  analyze  data  annually  during \nResults  implementation, then submit the results and details of actions taken as part \n  of its annual report to ADB. The PMO will also perform a complete analysis \n  of related primary and secondary data at the end of each tranche, and \ninclude  the  results  in  the  recipient\u2019s  project  completion  report  to  ADB. \nThe PMO will set up a small results measurement function. This work may \nbe outsourced to a research institute, firm or individuals. The Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program is planning work in this \narea  with  Belgian  university  team,  leaders  in  the  field  of  infrastructure \nproject impact evaluation.  \n   \nProcurement of  Goods  and  works  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGoods, Works,  Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Advisory services for project \nand Services  management, institutional reform, due diligence for new tranches, evaluation, \nmonitoring,  reporting,  results  measurement  of  the  MFF  and  individual \ntranches, design work, and capacity building as a whole, will be procured \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). These procedures have been agreed between ADB and \nMPW,  and  are  outlined  in  the  procurement  plan  given  in  Appendix  8. \nAfghanistan  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  any  violation  of  these  ADB \nguidelines in any project will constitute a ground for cancellation of the MFF. \n \nSpecial Procurement Condition. Projects will be located in areas where \ncountries  that  are  not  ADB  members  could  provide  materials  at  highly \ncompetitive prices. Explicit procurement restrictions may preclude civil works \nand  maintenance  contractors  from seeking the best business terms from \nsuppliers in these countries and submitting competitive bids. To keep the \nprogram  costs  to  a  minimum,  it  is  proposed  that  civil  works  contractors \nfinanced from the MFF be allowed to procure bitumen from any country, \nincluding from the countries that are not ADB members, strictly for use in \nprojects. This special condition was approved by the Board for four previous \nprojects  in  Afghanistan.  ADB  and  MPW,  through  routine  reviews  and \nprocurement audits, will ensure strict adherence by the contractors to this \nspecial condition. \n ", "viii  \n \n \nAdvance  MPW will initiate advance contracting under each tranche before signing \nProcurement  the  related  financing  agreements.  In  such  cases,  the  procurement \nand Retroactive  procedures, including advertising, shall be in accordance with the ADB \nFinancing  guidelines  in  order  for  the  eventual  contracts  to  be  eligible  for  ADB \nfinancing, and ADB shall review the process used. Expenditure on one or \nmore  components  of  a  project  under  an  individual  tranche  incurred  in \naccordance with agreed procedures, and during the 12 months before the \nsigning  of  the  corresponding  agreement,  will  be  eligible  for  retroactive \nfinancing  up  to  20%  of  the  amount  of  that  financing.  This  approval, \nhowever, does not commit ADB to subsequently approve and finance a \nparticular project. ADB cost sharing and expenditure eligibility rules need to \nbe followed. \n   \nBenefits and  The advantages and results expected from the Investment Program and \nBeneficiaries  ADB financing are shown in the DMF. The Investment Program will expand \nthe country\u2019s road network and maintain existing roads\u2014leading to greater \ncoverage and quality. It will also improve the efficiency of institutions in the \nsector and train staff\u2014to improve planning, management, and fiduciary \noversight. A new national agency will be set up to oversee the development \nof the road network (Afghanistan Highway Authority, AHA). \n \nThe Investment Program outputs will help cut costs of travelling and save \nmoney  on  vehicle  repairs  and  energy  consumption.  That  will  lead  to \nincreased  trade  and  business  opportunities:  various  services,  farming, \nmanufacturing,  food  processing,  distribution/logistics,  wholesaling  and \nretailing.  Better  connectivity  will  benefit  health  and  education  services. \nCommunity related projects along the routes will have a direct positive \nimpact on women and children. The private sector will benefit from the \nInvestment  Program,  including  from  the  creation  of  civil  works  and \nmaintenance contracts. This will generate fixed and temporary jobs. \n \nThere  is  an  ongoing  HIV/AIDS  awareness  campaign  financed  under \nprevious ADB financed projects. These will remain in place to ensure that \nthe impacts are minimized at each of the sites along various roads. Safety \nmeasures  will  be  incorporated  in  the  investments\u2014at  the  design, \nconstruction,  and  later  at  the  operational  stage.  Traffic  management \nsystems will be a responsibility of MPW and the security/police forces. \n \nThe provincial reconstruction teams attached to the international security \nforces have increased surveillance on national and regional roads, to deter \ndrug and people trafficking. \n   \nRisks and  Security  is  the  main  risk.  Awarding  contracts  at  a  reasonable  price  is \nAssumptions  already difficult, but carrying out civil works is more complicated in the \ncurrent security environment. Delays to civil works contracts have been a \ncommon  feature  of  ADB  and  other  donor-backed  road  projects  in \nAfghanistan.  Better  project  management,  more  community  buy-in  and \nsmarter phasing of particular sections (against the financing) will improve \nschedules and cut cost overruns. But security can derail good work at short \nnotice. This falls outside the direct ADB and MPW domain. The small scale \ncommunity investments should cut the number of disruptions to \n ", "  ix\ncontractors. But beyond this, success will be a function of overall security \ncover, and it is assumed that the proposed increase in international forces \nwill help curtail and eventually lessen this risk. \n \nThe Investment Program needs good institutions and strong management \nand  governance.  Good planning, best practice concepts, sound project \nmanagement,  fiduciary  oversight  and  transparent  bidding  and  contract \nmanagement processes require not only experienced personnel, but also \nefficient and effective systems/procedures and controls. On the institutional \nfront, considerable hope is placed on establishment of the AHA. It will take \nover the management of the road network. \n \nThis also requires leaders. But, not all is well in Afghanistan at all times on \nthese fronts. Good and experienced people often leave MPW after training \nand the new ones are not always ready to take on project management \nresponsibilities.  The  Investment  Program  will  introduce  better \norganizational structures, greater staff continuity, including among advisors. \nBut staff turnover will likely remain high. This implies a high level of hand-\nholding. Governance and fiduciary controls need strengthening. The MFF \nwill provide assistance in these areas. The loan agreements will also make \nspecific references to corruption and misprocurement. These will be \u201cdeal \nbreakers\u201d  and  lead  to  the  immediate  suspension  of  ADB  financing. \nAdherence to policy and procedures represent other filters.  \n \nCapacity building will thus be crucial and the only solution in the long term, \nto getting things done well and on time. In the short term, intensive and \ndirect help will need to be a feature of ADB\u2019s work. The quality of this work \nwill also be a function of the quality of the advisors that ADB finances. \nNeither  ADB  nor  most  of  other  development  partners  have  been \noverwhelmingly successful on this front in Afghanistan. Two-year tours of \nduty by consultants and staff are too short in most places, but especially so \nin Afghanistan. This happens even at the resident mission level. \n \nAnother risk is financing. ADB will provide the necessary funding for capital \nexpenditure. But in the long run, the main issue is maintenance and repair. \nThis needs a recurrent budget allocation. Budget allocations in the past \nhave been haphazard. The fiscal policy has been in disarray lately, with tax \ncollection down on expectations. A \u201croad fund\u201d might be part of the solution, \nbut even this requires seed capital. The matter requires attention and will \nbe provided through the PMO. It is not far-fetched to expect some of the \ndonor funding to be brought into the national budget, for this to be made \navailable for priority investment programs under ANDS. At present, only a \nfew donors operate through the budget. ADB is one of them. \n \nA reversal of the strategy and the policy framework by the Government is \nalso a risk. The former is less likely to happen than the latter. In the latter\u2019s \ncase, the aim is to maintain a close eye on the principles and to call for \nadditional refinements over the MFF financing period. The Government is \nwilling to receive advice in this area.  \n ", "64o  00'E 72o  00'E\nAFGHANISTAN\nROAD NETWORK DEVELOPMENT\nTAJIKISTAN\nINVESTMENT PROGRAM\nUZBEKISTAN PEOPLE'S\nREPUBLIC\nOF\nFaizabad CHINA\nKeleft Hairatan\nTURKMENISTAN JOWZJAN\nAndkhoi Balkh Kholm KUNDUZ TAKHAR BADAKHSHAN\nMazar-e-Sharif Kunduz\nSheberghan BALKH Taloqan Eshkashem\n36 o 00'N Sar-e-Pul Baghlan 36 o 00'N\nSamangan Pul-e-Khumri\nSAMANGAN BAGHLAN\nMaimana\nFARYAB PANJSHIR NURISTAN\nSAR-E-PUL Doshi Bazarak\nBADGHIS Charikar Mahmood-e-RaqiKamdish\nBAMYAN KAPISA KONAR\nIslam Qala Qala-i-Naw Bamyan PARWAN MLeAhGtaHrM LAaNm Asadabad\nChaghcharan KABUL\nJalalabad\nHerat WARDAK KABUL\nHERAT Khadir Maidanshahr Pul-e-AlamNANGARHAR Torkham\nGHOR LOGAR PAKTIA N\nDAIKONDI Gardez\nI R A N Shindand Ghazni KHOST\nGHAZNI\nKhost\nORUZGAN Sharan 0 50 100 150 200\nTarin Kot\nFarah FARAH Mukur PAKTIKA Kilometers\nZABOL\n32 o 00'N Delaram 32 o 00'N\nNational Capital\nQalat\nProvincial Capital\nLashkar Gah\nCity/Town\nKandahar\nAirport\nZaranj Regional Road\nHELMAND KANDAHAR ADB--Financed National Road\nNIMRUZ\nPAKISTAN ADB--Finance Regional Road\nLanday\nProposed National Road\nKudbar National Road (unpaved)\nOther Road\nRiver\nProvincial Boundary\nInternational Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n0\n8\n-2\n1\n63 H 64o  00'E 72o  00'E\nR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Road \nNetwork  Development  Investment  Program  (the  Investment  Program).  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework for the Investment Program and the MFF is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS), launched by the Government \nin April 2008, is the country\u2019s main strategic platform for development over the 2008\u20132020 \nperiod. Its aim is to promote growth, generate wealth, and cut poverty and vulnerability. ANDS \ngoes across all key sectors and subsectors. It also embraces several themes. One of the main \nsectors is transport and logistics. In this regard, the strategy sets out quantitative and qualitative \ntargets (physical and nonphysical) and covers various systems, including roads and railways. \nWithin the road subsector, the strategy caters for regional/national, provincial, rural and city \nnetworks, and emphasizes the construction of new assets and the management, maintenance \nand repair of existing ones. The underlying objective is to improve connectivity (within the \ncountry  and  with  neighboring  borders),  improve  efficiency  and  safety  of  travel  and  goods \ntransport, and strengthen institutions. Within the roads arena, the regional and national roads \ntake priority over the others, at least in the short to medium term (next 7 years). The country\u2019s \nroad network, excluding city roads, spans 34,000 kilometers (km).1 \n \n3.  The management of the road network rests with the Ministry of Public Works (MPW), \nwhich  has  a  workforce of about 900 engineers and technical staff plus 2,000 employees.  \nAt present, however, it acts as the executor of development projects financed by multilateral \nbanks and bilateral agencies. In the case of government-financed road development works, \nwhich are limited to rural and local roads, MPW procures construction and periodic \nmaintenance works from private firms through competitive bidding. Routine maintenance is \nexecuted  by  its  regional  offices  using  their  own  personnel  and  equipment.  A  detailed \nassessment of the transport sector is given in Appendix 2. \n \n4.  The roads network is in bad shape. By October 2001, this network built originally in the \n1960s and 1970s had dilapidated through neglect, with only 10% being in good condition. Since \nthen, donors have provided over $3 billion towards their repair and expansion. By the end of \n2007, however, improvement works had either been completed or were ongoing on about 3,200 \nkm of regional roads, 1,900 km of national roads, and 6,000 km of rural roads. These works \nrestored basic mobility in many parts of the country. Donors have tended to specialize in terms \nof geographic coverage and type of network. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has, thus far, \nfinanced the improvement of nearly 1,100 km of regional and national roads (since 2004), \nmostly in north and northwest parts of the country. ADB\u2019s investment amounts to over $600 \nmillion (as of October 2008). The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) \nand the World Bank are other large players in the sector. USAID, with a longer track record in \nthe south, has had a preference for provincial roads. It started a new $400 million program in \nthis area in 2007, targeting 1,800 km. The World Bank has been funding both regional and rural \nroads. It is currently spending $112 million in upgrading 3,000 km of rural roads. The European \n                                                 \n1  Comprised of 3,200 km of regional roads, 4,900 km of national roads, 9,700 km of provincial roads, 17,000 km of \nrural roads, and about 200 major bridges. \n ", "2   \nUnion has been financing an experimental performance-based maintenance contract on the \nKabul to Jalalabad road. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation has been helping MPW \nimprove the management and use of road maintenance equipment. Canada is cofinancing a \nproject in Kandahar. \n \n5.  The national construction industry has evolved over the past 3 years. All works in \nUSAID\u2019s provincial road improvement program and performance-based maintenance works in \nthe future will be procured from national contractors. The United Nations Office for Project \nServices is engaging national contractors almost exclusively on projects they undertake on \nbehalf of donors, and also use the services about half the engineers and technical staff of MPW. \nThat agency is presently training these engineers in procedures and road construction tools, \nwhich would be useful for MPW upon their return to the ministry. Donors supporting rural and \ndistrict  level  programs  are  also  now  procuring  works  from  national  contractors,  and  the \ninternational contractors are collaborating more with national contractors. \n \nB.  Key Problems and Opportunities \n6.  As  shown  in  the  problem  tree  analysis  depicted  in  Figure  A2  of  Appendix  2,  the \nperformance of the road network is constrained by technical, operational, financing, regulatory, \nand institutional deficiencies. These may be categorized as physical and nonphysical in nature. \nCombined, they lead to an inefficient, incomplete, unsafe and poor quality road network. These \nproblems can be fixed over time through targeted investments. \n \n1.  Assets\u2014Physical Aspects \n7.  Network coverage is limited. The existing road network is incomplete. This means that \nvarious parts of the country are poorly connected or not connected at all. Four provincial \ncapitals remain unconnected to the regional network. This delinks them from domestic and \nregional  markets.  The  coverage  gap  affects  connectivity,  which  in  turn  cuts  trade  and \ninvestment  opportunities,  increases  the  cost  of  doing  business  and  reduces  the  country\u2019s \ncompetitiveness  and  job  creation  capabilities.  Table  A3.1  in  Appendix  3  shows  the  most \nimportant gaps in the national roads network. \n \n8.  Quality of existing network is poor. Before 2001, investment in road reconstruction \nand maintenance was negligible. This has increased somewhat since then, although only 7% of \nthe total road length is paved as of today. About 70% of the inter-provincial and inter-district \nroads are in a poor state of repair, in many cases impassable during the winter months.  \nThe investment requirements to improve the network are high. Over the long term, these run \ninto billions of dollars. In the medium term the estimate is about $1.7 billion in the case of \nnational roads (3,000 km) and $1 billion in the case of provincial and rural roads (17,000 km). \n \n2.  Nonphysical Problems and Opportunities \n9.  Institutional gaps are rising. MPW cannot cope with the Investment Program without \nassistance.  A  good  organizational  structure  and  sound  planning  are  essential  to  ensure \nefficiency,  competition,  quality,  and  governance.  Therefore,  the  major  financiers  of  roads \nwelcome the Government\u2019s proposal to establish the Afghanistan Highway Authority (AHA), \nwhich will take over the administration of all roads in the country. But, this will take time to get \noff the ground. The work plan to take over the network will have to be phased. The AHA \nrequires qualified staff and sufficient financial resources to perform on its mandate.  \n \n10.  Lack of Financing. The road subsector requires a stable and predictable financing plan \nand  financing  flows.  This  plan  needs  to  distinguish  better  between  capital  and  recurrent \n ", "  3\nexpenditures, especially in the case of maintenance support. A road fund is required, but the \nGovernment does not have the necessary resources in the short term to put it together. Seed \ncapital could be provided through donor finance. But this means calling on donors to put more \nresources through the budget. Further, not all donors include infrastructure in their business \nstrategies. The result is that the availability of financing will likely remain a binding constraint. \n \n11.  Human  Resources.  MPW,  at  present,  has  a  weak  team  and  inadequate  project \nmanagement skills, systems, and procedures. It has talented staff in place, but the numbers are \nnot enough to cope with the job at hand. The skills mix is also weak. It lacks engineers and \nproject managers. Recruiting advisors from within and outside the country is also a challenge.  \nIn the meantime, the workload will be increasing, particularly if all the networks are included\u2014\nnational, provincial, rural, and city based. \n \n12.  Few Contractors, Engineers, and Materials Suppliers. The local construction industry \nis  fragmented  and  weak.  This  makes  subcontracting  difficult  and  unreliable.  \nThe engineering industry is in bad shape. Few companies have the resources to tackle large \ncontracts and even fewer have alliances with international groups willing and able to do the \nwork. Several contracts have had to combine design and construction. Although this works well \nunder strong institutions, in Afghanistan it has led to unnecessary changes in scope, technical \nspecifications, and dimensioning. There have been frequent and not always warranted contract \nvariation requests. Finally, Afghanistan does not have all the materials necessary for road \nconstruction. This has forced contractors to enter the international market. Bitumen remains the \nmain problem. In the case of ADB projects, this has meant a special waiver to non member \ncountry procurement rules.  \n \n13.  Weak  Governance.  MPW  has  weak  financial  management  and  fiduciary  oversight \nsystems  and  procedures.  The  flow  of  information  is  slow  and  accountability  is  not  strictly \nenforced. There are also gaps in the overall auditing and business process. Planning and \nprogramming is ad hoc, contracting methods are archaic, and contract administration is \nirregular and inadequate. \n \n14.  Security. The Government has found it difficult to attract international contractors to lead \ncivil works contracts. Most bids attract less than 3 bidders. In many cases, this leads to inflated \nprices. The average cost of constructing one kilometer of new two-lane road with 3.5-meter (m) \nlanes and 1.5 m shoulders rose from $371,000 per kilometer in mid 2006 to $534,000 in \nNovember 2007. The corresponding average cost of rehabilitating (milling the old pavement and \nresurfacing) one kilometer of new two-lane road with 3.5 m lanes and 1.5 m shoulders rose from \n$251,000/km in 2004 to $287,000 in March 2007. USAID has experienced an even larger \nincrease  in  the  cost  of  national  roads,  rising  from  $326,000/km  in  2004  to  \n$1 million/km in 2007, and the cost of provincial roads increased from $53,000/km in 2004 to \n$186,000/km in 2007. Not all high costs are because of insecurity. Some cost increases are a \nresult of the rising material prices,2 weak oversight, increasing risk of implementation delays, \nand lack of competition due to the small pool of contractors willing and able to work in the \nprevailing  conditions.  Such  conditions  will  be  accounted  for  in  cost  estimates,  schedules, \ncontracts, and monitoring frameworks of the projects under the MFF. Another reason for the \ncost  increases  is  the  threat  of  insurgent  attacks.  This  brings  the  need  to  introduce  more \nflexibility to the programming of road works. If critical infrastructure is damaged in the ongoing \nconflict or a sudden need arises to provide access to strategically important areas, the MFF \n                                                 \n2  Material prices in the region increased on average by 35\u201345% between 2004 and 2007, with cement price \nincreasing by 200%, and fuel and bitumen prices by 100% and 60%, respectively. \n ", "4   \noffers  flexibility  to  respond  to  those  needs,  even  if  those  works  had  not  originally  been \nprogrammed. There is also a need to involve communities more closely and earlier in the \nplanning and project design process. Financing basic and small scale infrastructure will also \nhelp with community buy-in. This is envisaged under the Investment Program. \n \n3.  Lessons \n15.  Three key lessons can be drawn from ADB\u2019s experience in the road subsector: project \ncosts have been underestimated, procurement of works and services have been slow and non- \ncompetitive, and stakeholder consultation has been weak. Unstable Government cofinancing \nand poor project management have also been recurrent problems.  \n \n16.  Most projects in the sector have suffered from underestimated capital and recurrent \ncosts. This problem has been further exacerbated by fast rising prices for materials, security \nand services, as well as by unnecessary changes in scope (higher technical specifications and \nsize). Under this scenario, MPW has been unable to finance the overruns, leading to long \ndelays  and  in  some  cases  to  actual  contractual  disputes.  This  problem  has  been  further \naggravated  by  the  approval  of  large  individual  financing  facilities  at  a  time.  This  is  often \nnecessary in order for Afghanistan not to forego annual grant allocations under concessional \nfinancing  windows.  Basically,  the  issue  is  that  financing  needs  to  be  better  linked  to  the \nreadiness of one or two road sections rather than to an amalgam of sections at a time. But this \napproach requires a smarter \u201ccash management\u201d plan for concessional finance. The use of \nseparate MFFs for each of the Afghanistan country partnership strategy (CPS) priority sectors \nwill provide the opportunity to allocate the annual funding envelope between smaller projects (or \nsections  of  projects)  in  each  sector,  thus  marrying  much  closely  financing  to  specific \nsubprojects\u2019 readiness. This is the approach being taken in Afghanistan. The implication of this \nis that instead of using the Asian Development Fund (ADF) envelope for one single project in a \ngiven year, ADB will put together MFF programs in each of the main sectors covered under the \nCPS,  and  then  commit  every  year  specific  amounts  of  finance  to  each  sector,  up  to  the \nmaximum amount allowed every year under ADF X. The tranching approach within each sector \nwill allow costs to be estimated in real time (or re-estimated) before the financing for each \ntranche is formally approved. Working on design work upfront (before financing is closed) will \nhelp further in this area.  \n \n17.  Procurement of works for design-build has been done mostly on the basis of quantities \nestimated from preliminary designs. This has required substantial variations in scope and scale \nof works. The consulting firms recruited according to quality and cost have been unable to \nreplace key specialists, who had left the positions on short notice due to the increasing violence. \nAnother complication has been the lack of contractors interest in civil works contracts. More \noften than not, in the case of roads at least, most bids have attracted only one bidder. There is \nan urgent need to promote road works opportunities among the international community. In \nsome cases, it might even be necessary for countries to consider giving extra incentives to \ncontractors to take part in the reconstruction effort. With regard to the MFF, ADB will undertake \na detailed review of prices during implementation. Quantities will be based on detailed designs \nprepared by recognized firms. Additionally, bigger contingencies will be provided in the budgets \nto accommodate unexpected price changes. \n \n18.  Stakeholder  consultation,  especially  with  local  communities,  has  been  inadequate.  \nThe result is that some have not \u201cbought into\u201d the projects or welcomed foreign contractors. It is \nnot  easy  to  carry  out  consultations  in  advance,  mainly  on  account  of  security  concerns. \nHowever, there is no doubt that this has become an issue affecting implementation and ultimate \nsuccess  of  projects.  These  factors  have  been  taken  into  consideration  in  designing  the \n ", "  5\nproposed  MFF.  Specifically,  the  MFF  includes  a  community  infrastructure  development \ncomponent, which will be implemented simultaneously with road works\u2014to allow people to \nbenefit from the improved access at the local level. The consultation process for the subsequent \ntranches will be done with finance provided under the previous tranches. Security cover will be \nprovided by the Government, and as appropriate by the contractors. \n \n19.  None  of  the  road  projects  have  been  fully  evaluated.  But  even  in  the  absence  of \nindependent reviews, it is possible to conclude that the performance on them is unsatisfactory. \nContract awards and disbursements are low and there have been constant changes in scope, \ndriven either by poor design and supervision or by rising price escalations. The low level of \ncontrols by the Government over contractor requests to endorse changes in scope is also \nworrisome.  Another  lesson  is  that  ADB  itself  can,  and  should,  do  more  on  the  ground.  \nThe Resident Mission is being restructured. By the end of 2008, the bulk of the team would \nhave changed and new project execution skills added. Finally, the treatment of themes such as \ngender, mainstreaming, safeguards, capacity, and private sector development needs rethinking. \nThe same applies to institutional effectiveness and reforms. With a programmatic MFF financing \napproach it will be possible to cater today for the expertise needed to handle work on key \nthemes tomorrow. The establishment of program management structures and teams will go a \nlong way to tackling some of these shortcomings. \n \n4.  Rationale for a Multitranche Financing Facility  \n20.  The Government has requested ADB to provide up to $400 million to help finance the \nInvestment Program through an MFF. Its utilization will be up to 2017. The MFF is justified on \nseveral grounds. In this case, it is considered superior to other modalities on offer. First, the \nInvestment  Program  fits  neatly  within  the  strategic  framework  that  ADB  has  agreed  with \nAfghanistan. The main elements of the country strategy have been agreed with the authorities, \nand are aligned to the ANDS as well as ADB\u2019s strategic platform. Second, the MFF brings \nupfront  the  main  analytical  work,  releasing  time  and  resources  for  watch  over  the \nimplementation. To generate impacts and outcome, the Investment Program requires better \ninstitutional effectiveness, but also contract awards and disbursements. The MFF provides a \ngood platform for establishing a program management office (PMO) with core expertise in \nproject  management  and  thematic  coverage,  and  a  platform  from  which  to  refocus  ADB \nresources and skill mix in the field. The MFF allows parties to plan ahead and engage experts \nduring the long haul, giving continuity in a climate of high domestic staff turnover. Third, the \nMFF helps the country team to plan ahead and manage the ADF envelope in an effective \nmanner. Under the CPS business plan, ADB will work simultaneously in four areas\u2014transport, \nenergy, irrigation, and reforms. The intention is to have the first three areas supported through \nMFFs and cluster programs in the case of the fourth. This approach will allow the country to \ndraw finance from umbrella facilities in line with project readiness. This not only improves ADF \n\u201ccash management\u201d, but also means \u201cfresher\u201d and more reliable investment cost estimates in \neach of the infrastructure sectors (which, as indicated, is a source of great concern in a rapidly \nchanging construction cost environment). Fourth, although not perfect, the main pre-conditions \nfor the use of the MFF are in place: road map, policy framework, investment program and \nfinancing plan. The policy framework is adequate, although it is the weakest of the four pre-\nconditions for the MFF.3 The Government has agreed basic principles (including cost recovery, \nmaintenance and repair, and funding thereof, adherence to best practice on construction and \nsafeguards, better governance, competition and institutional restructuring), but more specifics \nand refinements are needed over time. These policy principles look fine on paper but the issue \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2008. Mainstreaming the Multitranche Financing Facility. Manila. \n ", "6   \nis management of change, as and when needed. A program loan might have taken care of \nsome of the shortcomings. But, in the meantime, a bigger binding constraint is the lack of proper \ninfrastructure and qualified personnel. The MFF will provide finance to work on this, recruiting \nadvisory services to tighten up on the framework itself and monitor progress. The rest of the \nMFF pre-conditions are in better shape. \n \n21.  From  a  strategic  perspective,  roads  are  essential  to  Afghanistan\u2019s  economic \ndevelopment  for  at  least  three  reasons.  One,  the  challenging  terrain  and  the  scattered \ndistribution of the population make alternative modes of transport economically and technically \nnonviable. Two, as a landlocked country, its roads are an important conduit for trade with \nneighboring countries. Three, roads lead to national integration by enabling faster interprovincial \ntravel and trade. To this end, full implementation of the Investment Program, which calls for \nsequential investments, is imperative. However, because of mounting budget difficulties and \nrising construction costs, the Government, which depends on donor financing for all road works, \nhas difficulty in sourcing funds. This includes obligations under ongoing projects. The MFF \nprovides certainty (up to the funding made available under ADF X) and predictability. \n \n22.  More  than  40%  of  ADB  lending  to  Afghanistan,  thus  far,  has  been  for  transport \ndevelopment.4 Of this amount, over $600 million (about 25% of total donor financing for regional \nand national roads) went to improving around 1,000 km of roads (about 22% of all regional and \nnational roads improved during 2002\u20132007). The value of these roads for the economy can only \nbe sustained if other important links in the network are also improved, so that freight and people \ncan move seamlessly from one part of the country to another, as well as from/to the neighboring \ncountries. The sector strategy has this as a goal. \n \n23.  ADB has invested heavily in nonphysical aspects in the transport sector. It has provided \nextensive capacity development and training assistance to MPW. However, the capacity gap \nremains a barrier to doing things well and on time. To overcome this barrier, the MFF will \nfinance the engagement of experts upfront and for longer periods of time to do the following:  \n(i)  help  execute  individual  tranches;  (ii)  perform  due  diligence  on  future  investments;  \n(iii) establish evaluation, monitoring, and reporting mechanisms; (iv) manage safeguards and \ngovernance matters and set up a results measurement function; (v) carry out design work \nupfront  to  get  better  estimates  of  construction  costs  before  procurement;  and  (vi)  support \nbroader  capacity  development,  including  planning,  institutional  reform,  policy  reviews,  and \ngovernance/fiduciary improvements. A PMO will be set up within MPW to run the entire set of \nactivities. This office will have teams. The teams will have qualified staff engaged under the \nMFF\u2014national  and  international.  It  will  become  the  direct  counterpart  for  the  ADB  team \nsupervising the execution of the investments under the MFF. ADB\u2019s resident mission in Kabul \nwill play a major role during the implementation of the MFF. This mission will be strengthened \nwith five new staff (with experience in project management and administration). Internal systems \nand procedures are also being improved. \n \n24.  The MFF allows for supplementary financing due to price changes. These price changes \nhave required the Government to award contracts, including contracts in two ongoing projects5 \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2007.

Manila (Loan 2140-AFG, for $100 million, \napproved on 15 December); ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on \na Proposed Loan and Asian Development Fund Grant to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the North\u2013South \nCorridor Project. Manila (Loan 2257-AFG, for $78.2 million; Grant 0054-AFG, for $40 million; and JFPR 9097-AFG, \nfor $20 million, approved on 26 September). \n ", "  7\nfinanced by ADB, at prices higher than appraised prices\u2014with the intent of financing the gap \nfrom its own resources. This is complicated by the fact that the Government has recently \nexperienced  a  large  drop  in  revenues.  Therefore,  the  provision  for  limited  supplementary \nfinancing, even on a retroactive basis, for purely price changes will expedite the completion of \nprojects  that  are  critical  for  sustaining  mobility.  These  projects  are  visible  and  encourage \ncommunity support for the reconstruction and rebuilding process. \n \n25.  Last, but not least, the Investment Program has high regional content. The north-south \nand east-west trade corridors pass through Afghanistan. Despite the bad security situation, the \nrepaired and extended road networks have seen high traffic flows and thus have been making a \ndifference. Passenger and cargo traffic has been on the rise along the \u201cring road\u201d, including \ntraffic from Central Asia. Afghanistan plays a special role in the Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) program, which calls for investments in transport, energy, and trade. \nRoads connect Afghanistan to the outside world, as well as cities, towns, and villages within the \ncountry. Road investments made from the MFF will be visible and yield results, both tangible \nand intangible. \n \n26.  The MFF meets the pre-conditions as elaborated in Appendix 3. \n \n(i)  Road Map. ANDS comes with quantitative and qualitative targets and caters for \nnew assets, the rehabilitation of existing ones and institutional change. \n(ii)  Policy Framework. To implement the strategy, the Government has adopted a \npolicy framework. It states that Afghanistan will seek foreign assistance and use \nits own resources to build and maintain a network of roads that will provide good \naccess from one part of the country to another. The framework outlines steps \nneeded to operationalize the strategy and sustain its impacts. \n(iii)  Investment Program. The road development investment plan of the Government \nsets out its proposal for sustainable, road investment over the long, medium, and \nshort term. It is the largest program of road development planned by Afghanistan \nwith significant investments in physical and nonphysical aspects of the road \nsubsector. \n(iv)  Financing Plan. The Government has prepared preliminary cost estimates and \nschedules, and identified several funding sources for the Investment Program.  \nIt has set up a planning unit at MPW to revise and update these aspects, as and \nwhen new information and commitments are received from financiers. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n27.  The Investment Program is an integral part of ANDS. It follows a thorough analysis of \nkey problems,6 which has revealed deficiencies in two key areas\u2014technical and operational \n(physical) and institutional and thematic (nonphysical). The two aspects (problems and results) \nare linked and were taken into account during the design of the MFF. \n \n28.  Under  the  Investment  Program,  the  road  network  will  expand  and  improve.  The \nInvestment Program will strengthen the mandate and work of the main institution responsible for \nthe sector\u2014while adhering to best practice approaches on themes (gender, capacity, private \nsector  development,  environment,  and  safeguards).  All  physical  works  will  be  carried  out \n                                                 \n6  See problem tree in Figure A2 of Appendix 2. \n ", "8   \naccording to the standards required to meet international and national safety and reliability \nstandards, and supervised and audited by professional engineers. \n \n29.  The improved and expanded road network will increase connectivity, raise intercity travel \nspeeds, create conditions for more inter-city freight and passengers transport services, cut \noperating costs, develop safer roads, thereby allowing people and goods to move efficiently \nfrom one part of the country to another, and to neighboring countries. The Investment Program \nwill benefit the economy as a whole, including investment and job creation conditions in the \nregions and rural areas. Roads will also contribute indirectly to stability and security in the \nremote parts of the country. \n \nB.  Outputs \n30.  Investment components under the Investment Program will be selected according to the \ncriteria and procedures set out in Appendix 4. The physical outputs of these investments will \ninclude (i) 400 km of improved national roads, (ii) 1,500 km of regional and national roads \nsystematically maintained for up to 5 years, and (iii) where necessary, ancillary and emergency \nworks (on about 200 km) that become necessary because of insurgency and natural events. \nThe  investments  will  be  made  in  four  tranches  scheduled  for  the  period  of  2008\u20132011.  \nThe outputs of each tranche are described in para. 32. \n \n31.  The nonphysical outputs (qualitative in nature, although some proxies will be established \nover  the  Investment  Program  period)  include  (i)  better  planning  and  project  management \ncapabilities, (ii) regular budget and donor finance allocations towards maintenance and repair, \n(iii) the establishment of a new agency to oversee the road network, (iv) greater transparency \nand speed in the way contracts are awarded and handled, (v) full compliance with safeguards, \n(vi)  a  major  cut  in  the  number  of  project  and  contract  subject  to  changes  in  scope,  and  \n(vii) stricter fiduciary oversight. \n \n1.  Physical Components \na.  Infrastructure\u2014New and Existing Assets \n32.  Infrastructure  improvements  include  new  road  sections  (300  km)  and  the  repair, \nrehabilitation,  and  reconstruction  works  on  about  100  km.  Four  road  sections  have  been \ntentatively identified and three have been fully designed to be constructed under tranche 2, 3, \nand 4. These include the roads from Faizabad to Ishkashem (100 km), Jabul Saraj to Surobi (90 \nkm), Kabul to Jalalabad (alternative) road (160 km), and part of Darisuf to Yakawlang road (50 \nkm). Ongoing infrastructure improvements under ADB-financed projects whose costs have risen \ndue to purely price increases or a change in the financing plan will also be included in this \ncomponent. The infrastructure improvement component under the Tranche 1 Project falls under \nthis category because of the escalation of costs in (i) Andkhoy\u2013Qaisar Road Project (Loan \n2140-AFG), and (ii) North-South Corridor Project (Loan 2257-AFG/Grant 0054/JFPR 9097). \nDetails of these two projects and the proposed works are given in Appendix 5. \n \nb.  Ancillary and Emergency Works \n33.  The MFF includes a component for emergency works in the regional and national roads. \nThe output of this component will become tangible when specific conflict-induced damages \noccur and/or a sudden requirement for access to strategically important areas or enhancements \nto network connectivity emerge. \n \nc.  Maintenance \n34.  Maintenance works, both routine and periodic, on approximately 1,500 km of regional \n ", "  9\nand national roads are included under the MFF. Works will be performed by the selected \ncontractor(s) according to standards established by MPW for at least 3 continuous years. \n \n2.  Nonphysical Components \na.  Program Management Office \n35.  The PMO will handle the day to day work under the MFF. It will have the capability to \nmanage project execution under each tranche and experts to prepare new projects, including \nfeasibility studies and design work upfront\u2014preliminary and final designs, technical drawings. \nThe PMO will also have units to cater for legal matters; gender mainstreaming; safeguards; \nfinance and administration; financial management; monitoring, evaluation, and reporting; results \nmeasurement; and training on policy, strategy, planning, investment programming, and project \nmanagement. It will also handle the establishment of the AHA. \n \n    b.  Policy and Strategy Oversight \n36.  The current policy framework needs some refinement. This task will be undertaken by \nthe PMO through the engagement of experts on the subject matter. ADB will review the strategy \nfrom time to time to see if the targets are being met or the emphasis on specific interventions \nshould be modified. \n \n  3.  Special Features \n37.  One special feature of the Investment Program is inclusion, as part of the physical \ninvestments, of small works such as construction or rehabilitation of off-road service areas, \nvillage access roads, foot paths, and foot bridges, as well as social infrastructure such as \nschools and medical clinics in communities in the road impact areas. This feature enables the \nlocal areas to share the benefits of the Investment Program, especially during road construction. \nThe Government will provide financing from the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund for \nthese works. ADB will supplement this finance as and when necessary. Cofinancing will also be \nsought from bilateral agencies interested in community driven investments. \n \n38.  Another special feature is supplementary financing from the MFF for completion of works \nthat would otherwise be stalled or curtailed due to unanticipated increases in project costs. \nThese  works  fall  under  the  infrastructure  improvement  component,  but  will  be  eligible  for \nfinancing only if the cost increase is purely due to a price escalation or a change in the financing \nplan,  and  have  been  appraised  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  set  out  in  Appendix  4.  \nThe appraisal procedures set forth in ADB\u2019s policy on supplementary financing7 must also be \nsatisfied. This special feature will be applied for the Tranche 1 Project outlined in Appendix 5. \nThis feature is accompanied by a contingency under the MFF to finance or co-finance ancillary \nemergency works in priority routes. Standard procedures will also be followed in this case. \n \n39.  The third is financing upfront to deal with standard project management functions while \naddressing the risks and best practice approaches on themes. Instead of relying on traditional \nproject management units, a PMO will be set up. It will be structured into teams. Three functions \nof the teams are highlighted here: (i) legal team to deal with all contractual and bidding \nmatters, and (ii) a results measurement capability and project design upfront (to delink it \nfrom civil works). Safeguards will also figure prominently in the PMO structure. All the tasks are \nto  be  incorporated  into  a  management  information  system\u2014blending  project  management \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2005.

Investment Plan \n40.  Implementation of the Investment Program over the medium term is estimated to cost \nabout $1.25 billion. The cost share of the Investment Program assigned to ADB amounts to \n$400 million (shown in Table 1). The estimated total cost of the Tranche 1 Project (shown in \nTable 2) is $60 million and an indicative breakdown of investments by tranches is provided in \nTable 3.

Financing Plan \n41.  The Government has requested ADB to finance part of the Investment Program through \nan MFF in amount up to the equivalent of $400 million. Financing will be provided as grants \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources in accordance with relevant ADB policies, the framework \nfinancing agreement (FFA) between ADB and Afghanistan, and the Special Operations Grant \nRegulations, 8  subject  to  modification  that  may  be  included  under  individual  financing \nagreements. \n \n42.  Afghanistan will submit a periodic financing request (PFR) for batches of projects, which \nADB will review in accordance with the FFA and approve for financing from the MFF. Specific \nterms of each tranche will be based on the related PFR and ADB\u2019s then policy and procedures \nfor financing investment projects in Afghanistan. The first PFR is presented to ADB\u2019s Board of \nDirectors, together with the FFA. The amount of a grant will be determined by the maximum \nannual  Special  Funds  made  available  for  Afghanistan.  The  last  date  on  which  any \ndisbursements under any tranche may be made is by 31 December 2017. Afghanistan is \nexpected to submit the last PFR no later than 30 September 2012. The MFF for the Investment \nProgram will lapse if the legal agreement for the first tranche is executed within 2 months from \nthe date of Management approval for execution of the agreement. \n \n43.  Pursuant to the FFA and in accordance with the first PFR, a grant of $60 million from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will be provided to cover the cost of the Tranche 1 Project.  \nThe grant will have terms and conditions in accordance with the understandings in the FFA, as \nsupplemented under the relevant financing agreement. The tentative financing plan for the \nInvestment Program is in Table 4. \n \nTable 4: Tentative Financing Plan \nAmount \nSource  ($ million)  Percentage \nAsian Development Bank  400  32 \nWorld Bank  150  12 \nUnited States Agency for  400  32 \nInternational Development \nOthersa  300  24 \n      Total  1,250  100 \na  Includes the Government\u2019s resources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 2005. Special Operations Grant Regulations: Applicable to Grants Made by ADB from Its Special Funds \nResources. Manila (7 February). \n ", "12  \n44.  The policy paper titled \u201cRevising the Framework for Asian Development Fund Grants\u201d, \nwhich  proposes  revisions  to  the  ADF  grant  framework  and  approved  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of \nDirectors on 26 September 2007, provides that, for countries eligible for grant assistance, the \nlevel of grants in the country program will be based according to a country\u2019s debt-distress \nclassification. Afghanistan is at present classified as a country with high risk of debt distress, \nand therefore eligible to receive 100% grant assistance. \n \n45.  There are some caveats to the use of ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. First, the actual \nfinal amount will be subject to the size of the ADF envelope. That has been agreed for the next \n3 years (2008\u20132010). Thereafter, and at the ADF X mid-term review stage planned for 2010, \nthere  will  be  consultations  between  ADB  and  ADF  donors  regarding  the  application,  or \notherwise,  of  the  performance  based  allocation  formula.  Afghanistan  has  entered  the \nperformance based allocation system, although this was done on the understanding that its \napplication needs a special review before it kicks in. The Government understands that ADB\u2019s \ncommitment is limited and contingent on the availability of funds. Although neither ADB nor the \nGovernment would be under any legal obligation to grant or receive, the moral hazard element \nhas also been taken out of the equation through detailed discussion of the ADF envelope and \nthe implications for the financing of the Investment Program. Second, although at this stage the \nfirst tranche finance will be extended on a grant basis, ADB cannot commit to retaining these \nterms and conditions during the availability period of the MFF. If the ADF envelope were to be \nreduced  during  the  mid-term  review  of  ADF  X.  ADB  and  the  Government  will  enter  into \ndiscussions with a view to adjust either one or all of the proposed MFF\u2019s for the three sectors \nand the program lending, envisaged over the same period. Under this scenario, it will be either \nnecessary to cut on a prorata basis, cut one or two areas (and leave the others unchanged) or \nseek cofinancing from donors. By 2010 (until then ADF X financing is firm), only a portion of the \ncivil works contracts under the Investment Program would have been committed to. This means \nthat adjustments to the ADF X envelope would not have a negative impact on the contracts \nentered into with civil works contractors. \n \n46.  The first tranche makes a relatively small allocation of funding to program management \n($2 million) whereas the need is projected at $40 million over the MFF period. The reason for \nthis  is  that  the  first  tranche  focuses  on  two  existing  projects  and  not  yet  on  new  road \ninfrastructure development. The allocations made in ongoing ADB financed projects for program \nmanagement will be sufficient to start the establishment of the PMO and engage the services of \nadvisors to put in place a basic structure to be financed under the second tranche. In the \nsecond tranche, the \u201csoft\u201d component could be significant in size. The relatively high budget \nallocation takes into account the fact that a major part of the work will be upfront design work \nand actual contract supervision. These are relatively expensive items, but necessary in the \nAfghan context. The allocations of investment over the MFF period is given in Table 3. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n47.  Closer teamwork and efficient lines of communication between MPW units, which will be \nthe Executing Agency for the Investment Program, and ADB are crucial success factors for \nimplementing  projects  and  institutional  reforms  under  the  MFF.  There  are  three  main \nchallenges: organizational structure, experience, and know-how. The most critical of these is \nthe limited supply of qualified national and international staff.  \n \n48.  The organizational structure is easier to fix. Apart from spinning off the road network \nmanagement responsibility to the AHA, the main proposal is to create a tighter unit\u2014a PMO \n ", "  13\nwith a more precise mandate and resources. As indicated elsewhere in the report, this office will \nbe split into teams, each with a leader, staff, and resources and a clear responsibility and \naccountability lines. These teams will be run by expatriate and national advisors and MPW staff. \nThe  work  will  be  backed  by  the  introduction  of  systems  and  procedures  (including  a \nmanagement information system), a simple project management plan, and a standard ADB \nFacility Administration Memorandum. The office will be the main entry point for ADB staff \noverseeing the execution of the MFF. For decision making on policies, strategies, financial \nmatters, and internal approvals, the PMO will have direct access to the deputy minister of MPW. \nThis deputy minister doubles up as the main focal point for ADB in the transport sector. He is \nalso a major player in CAREC.   \n \n49.  The staff gap is much more difficult to deal with. There is a shortage of qualified national \nstaff, and those who are good soon leave their jobs, either for the local private sector or abroad. \nIt is extremely difficult to build capacity under these circumstances. The history on this front is \nthe equivalent to \u201cboom\u201d and \u201cbust\u201d: we create capacity, it goes away and then it needs to be \nreplaced. This makes it impossible to create institutional and project management memory. \nMore often than not, ADB and other donors have to start again from scratch every time there is \na new transaction. Although this problem will not go away, at least not for a long time, it is \nhoped that the use of the MFF approach might soften it somewhat. Specifically, the proposal is \nto create a large budget line and finance teams: (i) core team of experts to handle immediate \nproject management tasks; (ii) short term experts engaged on demand to sort out specific \nproblems related to these tasks; and (iii) a pool of local staff, trained and coached to do different \njobs. This pool will not prevent staff turnover, but at least it will give continuity to the PMO when \nsome staff leave (at least two people should be trained in the same discipline at the same time). \nThe budget allocation of around $40 million over the MFF period seems substantial by other \ncountry standards. There are two qualifications to make. First, the bulk of the budget will be for \ndesign work (to de-link it from civil works contracts) and contract supervision. This is quite \nexpensive. The objective is to front-load this work, leaving contractors with a simpler and more \nfocused mandate (with fewer conflicts of interest). Second, the PMO needs teams, and these \nneed to cross multitranche periods. This approach provides critical mass and continuity. Many \nof the experts will come from outside Afghanistan, which translates into a higher cost. \n \n50.  The structure of the PMO and the lines of communication are shown in Figures A7.1 and \nA7.2 of Appendix 7 with details in Supplementary Appendix A. The PMO teams are as follows: \n \na.  Leadership \n51.  This team will be run by a program director with experience in civil works contracts in the \nroads sector. The director will report to the deputy minister of MPW but operate independently \non a day to day basis. The job will have performance targets\u2014quantitative and qualitative. ADB \nwill play a role in the appointment. \nb.  Technical Team \n52.  This team will be responsible for two main tasks: design for subprojects and supervision. \nThe experts will also help prepare bid documents, contractor prequalification, and final bid \nassessments. \nc.  Legal Team \n53.  This team will be responsible for the entire bidding process, including the preparation of \ndocumentation, awards and contract negotiations, and final contract management. Contract \nvariations will be channeled through this team\u2014in terms of legal content. The team will also \n ", "14  \nreport on all undertakings made by the Government to ADB under the MFF including operating \npolicies and procedures. \nd.  Safeguards Team \n54.  A pool of experts will handle safeguards matters during implementation. The work will \nstart with due diligence for new projects and include safeguards frameworks and plans (for the \nMFF as a whole and the Tranche 1 Project, respectively). The safeguards experts will monitor \ncompliance during the execution phase. ADB will have a direct entry point to this team. \n  e.  Gender Mainstreaming \n55.  The  PMO  will  engage  the  services  of  experts  to advice on gender mainstreaming.  \nThis is an issue of great importance in a country such as Afghanistan. The concept here is that \neach investment must be \u201cgender proofed\u201d. In addition, it is imperative that broader gender \nissues at the sector level form part of the policy framework. Besides HIV/AIDs matters during \nthe construction phase, the team will also ensure adequate and timely consultations during the \npreparation of subprojects and adherence to gender plans during the implementation phase.  \nThis team will play a pivotal role during the design stage, but also with respect to the community \ndriven investments along the program roads. This is the first time that this approach is being \ntaken in an investment program. There will be some \u201clearning by doing\u201d. Appropriate reports will \nbe submitted on the subject matter. An ADB regional department front office gender focal point \nwill work closely with the gender team assigned to the MFF. \n \nf.  Evaluations, Monitoring, and Reporting \n56.  This function is required not only for ADB but also for the Government\u2014to see how the \ninvestments are performing and benefiting communities. A pool of experts will be engaged by \nthe PMO for this purpose. \n \ng.  Results Measurement \n57.  This is another new feature of the Investment Program and the MFF. The idea here is to \nengage  the  services  of  an  expert  (or  to  outsource  work  to  a  local  institute)  to  measure \nquantifiable and non- quantifiable impacts, outcome, and outputs arising out of the Investment \nProgram. There is a \u201cbefore\u201d, \u201cduring\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d scenarios at play. There is no well- established \nmethodology to perform this type of work on infrastructure projects, although a university in \nBelgium  is  spearheading  ideas  on  this  front.  This  team  has  been  engaged  by  CWRD  to \nundertake pilot assessments under CAREC road projects. The work will commence in 2009. It is \nhope that the Investment Program, and the experts engaged to do this work in Afghanistan, will \nbenefit from this assessment. \n \nh.  Finance and Administration \n58.  One of the most important tasks under the PMO is to ensure that all the funds are used \nfor the intended purposes and to record and account for them on a regular basis. A special \nteam will be tasked to perform this work and will be responsible for cash management, payment \nrequests and withdrawals and for the commissions of audits of accounts. This team will be led \nby an expert with experience and a sound track record on the subject matter, reporting directly \nto  the  PMO  director.  ADB  will  have  direct  access  to  this  expert.  All  key  anticorruption, \nprocurement, and financial management arrangements will be channeled through this team.  \n \ni.  Due Diligence \n59.  The preparation of new subprojects requires due diligence: technical, commercial, legal, \nfinancial, social, safeguards, financial management, procurement, implementation, governance, \n ", "  15\netc. The PMO will commission work as and when required to undertake such work. This will \nlead to the submission of new PFRs.  \n \nj.  Capacity, Policy, and Strategy \n60.  The road sector has institutions that are ineffective and inefficient. The restructuring \nproposed under the Investment Program (creation of the AHA) is complex, and requires a pool \nof experts, local and international. The other area to focus on is the training of staff on project \nmanagement, administration, safeguards, and procurement. There will also be a need to watch \nover the policy framework and strategy, coming up with refinements as and when required. This \nteam will look at the \u201cbig institutional picture\u201d; but also at sector, project, and thematic issues.  \n \n61.  The ADB team at the resident mission in Kabul will be strengthened, with a permanent \nfocal point for each sector and technical and administrative back-up staff. Headquarters will \nintegrate with this team. The objective is to do the bulk of the work in the field, including \nchecking  procurement  and  disbursement  matters,  providing  technical  advice  and  handling \nadministrative work and reporting. The ADB team will work with the PMO in a seamless manner. \nThis joint venture will cut paperwork and ease decision-making. The objective is to increase \ncontract awards and disbursements while improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the \ninstitutions. The draft facility administration memorandum, which will be finalized by ADB and \nagreed with MPW during the inception of the MFF, is shown in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n2.  Periodic Financing Requests \n62.  The criteria for selecting, and procedure for obtaining ADB\u2019s approval of a tranche are \ngiven in Appendix 4. The PMO will prepare a draft appraisal report in line with standard ADB \nrequirements. The report will also include details of the contract packages, contracting method \n(design-bid-build or design-build), special features, if applicable, and the services that will be \nprocured for supervision of works or to support the PMO. The technical designs will meet \nappropriate standards and relevant policies, and all social and environmental safeguards. \n \n63.  MPW will submit a draft appraisal report on each PFR to ADB, which will perform a due \ndiligence analysis in accordance with the relevant policies and procedures, and approve the \nreport, if in good condition. If required by ADB, the PMO will revise the report, and submit the \nfinal version of the PFR, to ADB for approval. MPW may simultaneously carry out advance \ncontracting  for  goods,  works,  and  services  as  approved  by  ADB.  ADB  has  reviewed  and \napproved  the  appraisal  report  on  the  Tranche  1 Project, and the Ministry of Finance has \nsubmitted the first PFR. The appraisal reports and PFRs related to subsequent projects will \nhave the same format as the first report and PFR. \n \n3.  Implementation and Disbursement Schedules \n64.  The indicative implementation and disbursement schedules for the MFF are shown in \nFigure A7.3 and Table A7 of Appendix 7, and in details in Supplementary Appendix A. These \nschedules  will  be  continually  reviewed  and  updated  by  the  joint  team  to  ensure  timely \ncompletion of activities. \n \n4.  Procurement of Consulting Services \n65.  Consultant Selection Methods. Careful oversight of works and a strong professional \nrelationship with the employer and contractor will be part of the mandate of the PMO. Under \nongoing  projects,  consultants  selected  according  to  the  quality  and  cost-based  selection \n(QCBS) method were unable to exercise adequate oversight and replace key supervision staff \nincluding team leaders due to cost implications. Moreover, lapses in monitoring and reporting \n ", "16  \nhave caused unnecessary costs and embarrassment to the Government. Therefore, flexibility to \nplace more emphasis on quality than on the cost of consulting services is essential. To this end, \nMPW will select and engage consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and the procurement plan in Appendix 8, \nusing  either  QCBS  or  the  quality-based  selection  (QBS)  method,  as  appropriate.  The \nprocurement plan, which covers activities in the next 18 months, will be updated, at least \nannually. Procurement of additional services under the Tranche 1 Project is not anticipated \nbecause project management services are ongoing. \n \n66.  Core and Short-Term Consultants. MPW will engage a core experts and budget for \nshort term ones, which will be recruited to perform tasks on demand and at shorter notice.  \nThe consultants will be engaged either as firms or individuals under the second tranche. Terms \nof reference for these consultants will be submitted as part of the second PFR. \n \n5.  Procurement of Goods and Works \n67.  Methods  of  Procurement  and  Contracting.  MPW  will  undertake  all  procurement \nactivities in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime), and the procurement plan is in Appendix 8. At least once in 12 months, MPW will update \nthe procurement plan to include activities in the next 18 months. MPW may opt to include post-\ncompletion maintenance for periods of up to 5 years as part of infrastructure improvement \nworks,  which  will  be  procured  using  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedure. \nMaintenance works on existing roads and emergency and ancillary works, if necessary bundled \ninto packages for ease of administration, will be procured using ICB or national competitive \nbidding  (NCB)  procedures.  The  NCB  Annex  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B  summarizes \nnecessary modifications to or clarification of Afghanistan\u2019s procurement procedures to carry out \nNCB for ADB-financed projects. NCB will be used only for projects valued at less than $1 million \nand in cases where it is deemed more expeditious than ICB. Design-bid-build or design-build \ncontracting may be used for infrastructure improvement, and ancillary and emergency works. \nMaintenance contracting will be performance (output) based or based on a hybrid of input (bills \nof quantity) and output. Under the Tranche 1 Project, financing will be solely for price changes in \nongoing ADB-financed projects, where all works contracts have been awarded. Therefore, there \nis no need for procurement of goods or works. \n \n68.  Bidding Documents. ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents will be used for procuring \ninfrastructure improvement works. They will, to the extent possible, contain performance criteria \nand security assurances that will increase the efficiency and timeliness of completion. In the \ncase of design-build works, depending on the level completion of designs at the procurement \nstage, bids may be called on the basis of standards and specifications instead of quantities.  \nBidding documents for maintenance works on existing roads will follow the World Bank\u2019s9 or \nother  international  agencies\u2019  documents  for  performance-based  works,  modified  to  ensure \nconsistency  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  and  Afghanistan  Procurement  Law  (October  2005)  with \nreference to NCB Annex in Supplementary Appendix B, and Section 3 of the procurement plan \nin Appendix 8. For post completion maintenance of infrastructure improvement works, the same \nmaintenance bidding documents may be included as part of the standard documents. In either \ncase, MPW will prepare the documents for works and maintenance, and submit them to ADB for \napproval before calling for tenders. \n \n                                                 \n9  Available: http://www.worldbank.org/html/opr/procure/bdocpage.html. \n ", "  17\n69.  Special Procurement Condition. Some projects of the Investment Program will be \nlocated in areas where countries that are not ADB members could provide materials, at highly \ncompetitive prices. Explicit procurement restrictions may preclude civil works and maintenance \ncontractors  from  seeking  the  best  business  terms  from  suppliers  in  these  countries  and \nsubmitting  competitive  bids.  To  keep  the  project  costs  to  a  minimum,  ADB  Management \nproposes that works contractors financed from the MFF be allowed to procure bitumen from any \ncountry,  including  the  countries  that  are  not  ADB  members  for  use  in  the  Project.  \nThis special condition was approved by the Board for previous four projects10 in Afghanistan. \nADB and MPW, through routine reviews and procurement audits, will ensure the contractors\u2019 \nstrict adherence to this special condition. \n \n6.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n70.  To expedite the bidding process, ADB Management has approved advance contracting \nand retroactive financing from the MFF for expenditures incurred on eligible works, goods, and \nservices. Advance contracting allows MPW to commence procurement activities, at its own risk, \nprior  to  signing  of  the  financing  agreement.  Afghanistan  was  informed  that,  in  order  for \nexpenses  incurred  under  advance  contracting  to  be  eligible  for  retroactive  financing,  such \nprocedures  (including  advertising)  must  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Once  the  financing  under  each  tranche  becomes \neffective, up to 20% of grant proceeds from any tranche may be used to retroactively finance \neligible expenditures incurred under that tranche, pursuant to advance contracting, during the \nperiod  not  exceeding  12  months  prior  to  signing  of  the  project  financing  agreement. \nAlternatively, the Government may opt for advance contracting without retroactive financing, in \nwhich case the procurement procedures completed under advance contracting do not conclude \nwith the award of contract until after the grant becomes effective. Afghanistan acknowledges \nthat any concurrence by ADB with the procedures, documentation, or proposal for award does \nnot commit ADB to finance such expenses. \n \n7.  Anticorruption Measures \n71.  MPW,  through  the  PMO,  will  maintain  oversight  of  all  externally  funded  projects  in \naccordance with international best practices. The national procurement law has several key \nsafeguards and specifies the accepted conduct of public officials in the event of a conflict of \ninterest and corruption. Methods of procurement for externally financed activities, including \nADB\u2019s projects, follow specific procedures and guidelines. Procurement of works and services \nfor budget-financed projects is based on the national procurement law. However, there is no \nformal record keeping, evaluation of contractors\u2019 and consultants\u2019 performance, or conflict-of-\ninterest disclosure by procurement committee members and bidders. Site reviews by MPW are \ninadequate. As part of its reform process, MPW will establish eligibility criteria for persons \nserving on bid evaluation committees and will require disclosure of assets and conflicts of \ninterest. Additionally, MPW will engage private firms to conduct procurement and operability \n(technical) audits of randomly selected works contracts within 12 months of contract and 6 \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2003.

A detailed review of the \nfinancial  management  and  governance  procedures  of  MPW  and  MOF  is  provided  in \nSupplementary Appendix C. \n \n72.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  MPW.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to a project.  \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents related to each tranche project. In particular, all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with a tranche shall include provisions specifying the \nright of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of MPW and all contractors, \nsuppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  a  tranche.  MPW  will \nundertake necessary measures to publicly disclose project-related procurement actions such as \ninformation on bidding procedures adopted, specifications of goods, works, and consulting \nservices, participating bidders, and award of contracts. ADB made clear to the Government that \nany proven wrong-doing on the fiduciary front will automatically lead to the suspension and/or \ncancellation of the MFF.   \n \n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n73.  Proceeds from the MFF will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). In order to pay routine project management \ncosts, a separate imprest account with an approved ceiling of $100,000 will be established \npromptly after effectiveness of each grant agreement at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB, \nand  the  account  will  be  managed  by  MPW.  To  expedite  the  flow  of  funds  and  simplify \ndocumentation processing, the statement of expenditures procedure will be used for liquidation \nand  replenishment  of  the  imprest  account  and  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  not \nexceeding  $50,000  per  individual  payment.  Based  on  supporting  documentation,  ADB  will \nreimburse, liquidate, or replenish payments in excess of the statement of expenditures ceiling. \nMOF will monitor the imprest account, and review monthly reconciliation of the account. \n \n9.  Reviews \n74.  In addition to monitoring by the operational division and periodic reviews by missions, \nADB, together with MOF and MPW, will perform on and off-site reviews of the Investment \nProgram and the projects financed from the MFF. In the first 2 years of the Investment Program, \nquarterly or biannual reviews may be needed. A midterm review of the Investment Program (all \ncomponents of all projects financed from the MFF) will be performed in mid\u20132011. The reviews \nwill focus on identifying causes and agreeing on measures to correct negative deviations from \ntargets for (i) output rates, (ii) disbursements, (iii) reforms, (iv) financial and procurement audits, \nand (v) safeguards compliance. ADB has allocated additional resources and staff to ADB\u2019s \nresident  mission  in  Kabul  to  participate  in  the  reviews,  facilitate  coordination  with  the \nGovernment, and maintain better oversight. \n \n10.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n75.  The PMO will maintain, for each tranche, records and accounts required to identify  \n(i)  goods,  works,  and  services  procured;  (ii)  funds  received  from  ADB  and  MOF;  and  \n(iii) expenditures incurred. Annual financial audits will be performed by the Office of the Auditor \nGeneral of Afghanistan. In instances when that office is unable to undertake the financial audits \non time, MPW will engage a private firm of auditors using the QCBS method according to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year, \n ", "  19\nMPW will submit to ADB the audited project accounts and the auditors\u2019 report, for each project, \nincluding a separate opinion of the auditors on the use of the imprest account and the \nstatement of expenditure procedures. A detailed assessment of the strengths and weaknesses \nof  the  present  accounting,  auditing,  and  reporting  system  in  Afghanistan  is  given  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \n76.  Additionally, MPW will engage specialists to conduct technical audits using the QCBS \nmethod according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Technical audit reports will \nbe submitted to ADB within 1 month after completion. The PMO will also prepare, and submit to \nADB,  summary  quarterly  reports  on  the  performance  of  each  component  of  each  project.  \nThe  reports  will  include  information  on  physical  progress,  past  disbursements,  projected \ndisbursements in the following quarter, implementation of social and environment safeguards, \nproblems (if any) encountered, actions taken, and activities planned in the following quarter. \n \n11.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n77.  Based on guidance provided by ADB, MPW has prepared a systematic procedure of \nrecording and analyzing related data to monitor and report performance of ongoing projects to \nits stakeholders. MPW will use the same procedure, with modifications where necessary, to \nmonitor and report to ADB on the performance of the MFF. The reports will contain baseline \nvalues of indicators, targets, and milestones corresponding to the expected impacts, outcome, \noutputs, and activities identified in the design and monitoring framework, including special \nfeatures and other relevant measures agreed between ADB and MPW. \n \n78.  The  PMO  will  collect  baseline  data  and  other  information  during  implementation. \nThereafter, it will analyze data every 12 months, and including the results of the analyses and \ncorrective measures (if any) taken to reverse negative trends and MPW\u2019s quarterly report to \nADB impacts. ADB review missions will discuss these reports and actions taken by MPW to \nensure that all the targets and milestones are met. \n \n79.  MPW will perform a final analysis of related primary and secondary data on impacts and \noutcome within 1 month from completion of each project. The results of this analysis will be \nincluded in the recipient\u2019s project completion report, which will be submitted to ADB within  \n3 months of each project completion. These results will be verified by ADB and reported in its \nproject completion report for each corresponding project. \n \n12.  Stakeholder Participation and Consultation \n80.  ADB, USAID, and the World Bank together have financed more than 75% of the cost of \nimproving the economically and strategically vital \u201cring road\u201d in Afghanistan. To ensure that \nfuture development efforts in the road sector are aimed at a common goal, ADB has consulted \nUSAID and the World Bank while preparing the MFF. Likewise, ADB has met with people of \nvillages adjacent to the roads being constructed, road users and road builders to ascertain the \nimmediate  impacts,  both  positive and negative. These meetings revealed that the positive \nimpacts  far  outweigh  the  negatives.  Based  on  these  lessons,  MPW  will  ensure  that  the \nInvestment Program is implemented with active participation of all national stakeholders, using \nparticipatory  practices.  Consultation  will  continue  throughout  the  Investment  Program \nimplementation. MPW, through regular field visits and the use of specialists, will implement each \ntranche.  Disclosure  of  relevant  information  will  continue  throughout  implementation  of  the \nInvestment Program. In the case of tranche 1, resettlement and environmental impacts have \nbeen discussed with the stakeholders, including affected persons and local administrative units, \n ", "20  \nand the relevant information has been publicly disclosed through the local media and ADB\u2019s \nwebsite. \nIV.  BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n  1.  Economic Benefits \n81.  The condition of roads and level of network connectivity at present are such that even \nminor improvements to them provide large economic benefits to road users and the economy as \na whole. Interviews with traders in the villages and towns along the improved roads confirmed \nthat the price of key commodities have dropped by up to 50% soon after the works were \ncompleted. These benefits could be sustained by making selected investments in the right \nplaces at the right time. To this end, for every investment from the MFF, MPW will perform \neconomic analyses in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects \n(1997)  to  ensure  that  it  meets  the  benefit  thresholds  before  requesting  financing  for  that \ninvestment from the MFF. The two subprojects of the Tranche 1 Project, (Loan 2140-AFG and \nLoan 2257-AFG), had significant positive net present values (NPVs), and economic internal \nrates of return (EIRRs) of 19% and 31%, respectively. The increase in their costs by 22% and \n31%, respectively to contract price changes will lower the NPVs estimated at appraisal by 9% \nand 22%, and EIRRs estimated at appraisal by 3% and 4%. However, the subprojects remain \nrobust, as described in Appendix 9. \n \n2.  Sustainability\u2014Physical Components \n82.  MPW will have to set aside funding to maintain and repair the networks. This is part of \nthe MFF conditions. Failure to do so will trigger a cancellation or suspension of the MFF.  \nThe MPW is implementing a management information system under the ongoing Grant 0081-\nAFG. This system would enable many of the tasks handled manually at present to be expedited \nand information to be stored for future use on maintenance needs. Additionally, ADB recently \nassisted  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Civil  Aviation  in  revising  surface  transport  service \nregulations, which would increase cost recovery from road users. In the interim, USAID and the \nEuropean  Union  are  financing  part  of  the  required  maintenance  costs  through  separate \nprograms, which later could be mainstreamed into MPW operations. ADB has also allocated \n$20 million from Grant 0081-AFG for maintenance of roads already improved and set aside $30 \nmillion  from  the  MFF  for  continuing  this  work.  Implementation  of  vehicle  weight  control \nmeasures by MPW and supported by ADB will gradually reduce the number of overloaded \nvehicles on the roads, and the consequent damages to the pavements. Additionally, a sound \nfinancial management system has been implemented at the PMO, and it will be upgraded to be \npart of MPW\u2019s overall management information system (which will be operationalized by 2010). \nThese activities, in concert with the maintenance and institutional reform components of the \nInvestment Program, will help increase the sustainability of Afghanistan\u2019s investment in its road \nnetwork. \n \n3.  Sustainability\u2014Nonphysical Components \n83.  Staff  training  planned  under  the  Investment  Program  will  be  supplemented  by  the \nGovernment salary and career program. The operationalization of AHA will allow the delegation \nof responsibilities to various operational departments. That should increase accountability and \nstaff satisfaction. Other institutional improvement areas are highlighted above under the role \nand functions of the PMO. \n \n \n ", "  21\n4.  Environmental Impacts \n84.  The Investment Program has been assessed according to ADB\u2019s Environmental Policy \n(2002). It is classified as category B due to the minimal short-term environmental impacts of \nimprovement and maintenance works planned in each of the projects. Long-term environmental \nimpacts of the Investment Program will be addressed during implementation. Assessment of \nshort-term impacts and their mitigation will be made in accordance with the environmental \nassessment and review framework given in Appendix 10. MPW prepared the framework in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines \n(2003), as well as relevant laws and regulations in Afghanistan. It has been agreed with ADB. \nSufficient funding has been set aside from the MFF to mitigate, where necessary, environmental \nimpacts of the projects to be funded from it. MPW will monitor implementation of environmental \nmanagement plans for the projects through its staff and supervision consultants, and report to \nADB every 6 months. After reviewing MPW\u2019s environmental impact monitoring reports and \ndiscussing with the supervision consultants for each subproject of the Tranche 1 Project, ADB is \nsatisfied that there have been no significant environmental impacts up to now and none in the \nfuture. Minor lapses on the part of the contractor (such as inadequate dust control, delays in \ndisposing of construction waste, and excess run off from vehicle servicing) have been identified \nby the supervision consultants and immediate corrective action has been taken. Moreover, \nrelated  requirements  in  the  loan  and  grant  covenants  have  been  satisfied  and  the  initial \nclassification (category B) of the Tranche 1 Project still holds. \n \n5.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n85.  Land acquisition and resettlement impacts of each project under the MFF will be treated \naccording  to  the  resettlement  framework  given  in  Supplementary  Appendix  D,  which  was \nprepared  by  MPW  in  consultation  with  national  and  local  administrative  bodies  and  in \naccordance relevant ADB policies. The impact assessment and mitigation will depend on the \nmethod of contracting for the different types of physical works. In design-bid-build contracts, \nMPW will prepare detailed designs and corresponding resettlement plans (RPs) and implement \nthem simultaneously with procurement of works. MPW will not sign works contracts prior to \ncompleting land acquisition and resettlement activities. In the case of design-build contracts, \nwhich would allow works to be expedited by the designing the road while physical works \nprogress, after the award of contracts and during the detailed design phase, MPW will work \nthrough the supervision consultant(s) and the contractor(s) to determine impacts. Depending on \nthese impacts, MPW will prepare resettlement plans and implement the plans after obtaining \napproval from ADB.11  \n \n86.  Works  contracts  will  contain  specific  provisions,  and  MPW  and  the  supervision \nconsultants will exercise careful oversight to ensure that works in the impacted areas are not \nundertaken until the key resettlement activities are completed. The supervision consultants\u2019 \ncontracts will contain specific monitoring provisions requiring their teams to include resettlement \nand social development specialists to monitor the works and assist MPW. MPW will engage an \nexternal monitor to review and report on resettlement activities to the stakeholders and ADB. \nThe  external  monitor  will  be  responsible  for  issuing  a  no-objection  certificate  for \ncommencement of civil works. Funding from the MFF has been set aside for land acquisition, \nresettlement,  and  safeguard  monitoring.  After  reviewing  MPW\u2019s  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement impact monitoring reports and discussing with the supervision consultants for each \n                                                 \n11 This condition is an assurance provided by Afghanistan in Loan 2140-AFG: Andkhoy-Qaisar Road Project, and will \nbe included in legal documents pertaining to each Project of this Investment Program. \n ", "22  \nsubproject  of  the  Tranche  1  Project,  ADB  is  satisfied  that  there  has  not  been  any  land \nacquisition or resettlement up to now, and there will be none in the future. Moreover, related \nrequirements in the covenants have been satisfied.  \n \n87.  An assessment of the impact of the Investment Program related activities on indigenous \npeoples has been performed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Indigenous Peoples Policy (1998).  \nThe constitutional categorizations of the people of Afghanistan do not include any as indigenous \npeoples, and there are no people that will be negatively affected by the Investment Program \nrelated activities. The Investment Program is accordingly classified as category C. \n \n6.  Social and Poverty Impacts \n88.  There will be several externalities of the Investment Program, direct and indirect. Among \nthese are employment opportunities for road works, and the 3 to 5 year maintenance contracts \nenvisaged under the construction works contracts, which will be for longer periods for road \nworks. Additionally, access to health care and potable water will be increased as a result of the \ncommunity  infrastructure  improvements  planned  in  conjunction  with  road  improvements.  \nThere is an ongoing HIV/AIDS awareness campaign financed under previous ADB-financed \nprojects that is expected to have an impact countrywide by focusing on vulnerable mobile \ngroups  such  as  commercial  vehicle  operators.  The  provincial  reconstruction  teams  of  the \ninternational forces have increased surveillance on national and regional roads, which will serve \nas a deterrent to trafficking of drugs and people. Afghan forces are expected to take over these \nduties in the long run. To maximize these externalities, poverty reduction and social strategies \nwill be prepared according to ADB\u2019s handbooks on poverty reduction and social analysis12 \nduring the design of subsequent projects financed from the MFF. Implementation of the strategy \nwill be closely monitored by external observers engaged by MPW. \n \nB.  Assumptions and Risks \n89.  Security is the main risk. Awarding contracts at a reasonable price is already difficult, but \ncarrying out civil works is more complicated in the current security environment. Delays to civil \nworks contracts have been a common feature of ADB and other donor-backed road projects. \nBetter project management, more community buy-in and smarter phasing of particular sections \n(against the financing) improve schedules and cut cost overruns. But security can derail good \nwork at short notice. This falls outside the direct ADB and MPW domain. The small scale \ncommunity investments should cut the number of disruptions to contractors. But beyond this, \nsuccess  will  be  a  function  of  overall  security cover, and it is assumed that the proposed \nincrease in international forces will help curtail and eventually lessen this risk. \n \n90.  The  Investment  Program  needs  good  institutions  and  strong  management  and \ngovernance.  Good  planning,  best  practice  concepts,  sound  project  management,  fiduciary \noversight  and  transparent  bidding  and  contract  management  processes  require  not  only \nexperienced  personnel,  but  also  efficient  and  effective  systems/procedures  and  controls.  \nOn the institutional front, considerable hope is placed on the establishment of AHA, which will \ntake over the management of the road network. \n \n91.  This also requires leaders. But, not all is well in Afghanistan at all times on these fronts. \nGood and experienced people often leave MPW after training and the new ones are not always \nready to take on project management responsibilities. The Investment Program will introduce \nbetter organizational structures, greater staff continuity, including among advisors. But staff \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2006. Poverty Handbook. Manila. ADB. 2007. Handbook on Social Analysis. Manila. \n ", "  23\nturnover will likely remain high. This implies a high level of hand-holding. Governance and \nfiduciary controls need strengthening. The MFF will provide assistance for improving these \nareas.  The  FFA  and  the  legal  agreements  clarify  that  corruption  and  violations  of  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  These  will  be  \u201cdeal \nbreakers\u201d and may lead to the immediate suspension of ADB financing. Adherence to policy and \nprocedures represent other filters.  \n  \n92.  Capacity building will be crucial and the only solution in the long term to getting things \ndone well and on time. In the short term, intensive and direct help will need to be a feature of \nthe ADB work. The quality of this work will be a function of the quality of the advisors ADB \nfinance. Neither ADB nor most of other development partners have been successful on this front \nin Afghanistan. Two year tours of duty by consultants and staff are too short in most places, \nespecially so in Afghanistan. This happens even at the resident mission level. \n \n93.  Another risk is financing. ADB will provide the necessary funding for capital expenditure, \nbut in the long run the main issue is maintenance and repair. This needs a recurrent budget \nallocation. Budget allocations in the past have been haphazard and the fiscal policy has been in \ndisarray lately, with tax collection down on expectations. A \u201croad fund\u201d might be part of the \nsolution, but even this requires seed capital. The matter requires attention and this will be \nprovided through the PMO. It is not far-fetched to expect some of the donor funding to be \nbrought into the national budget, for this to be made this available for priority investment \nprograms under ANDS. At present, only a few donors operate through the budget. ADB is one \nof them.  \n \n94.  A reversal of the strategy and the policy framework by the Government is also a risk. \nThe former is less likely to happen than the latter. In the latter\u2019s case, the aim is to maintain a \nclose  eye  on  the  principles  and  to  call  for  additional  refinements  over  the  MFF  period.  \nThe Government is willing to receive advice in this area.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n95.  ADB will seek assurances from Afghanistan that, through MPW, it will ensure that: \n \n96.  Sector Specific Undertakings. The Afghanistan Highway Authority envisaged under \nthe MPW Strategy will be established and operationalized by 2013 at the latest. Afghanistan \nprovides counterpart funds for selected social infrastructure (e.g. buildings for schools and \nmedical services, drinking water wells, etc.) in the communities in the Investment Program \nimpact areas. Adequate funds for completing improvements to the remaining regional and \nnational roads in accordance with the MPW Strategy are secured, and are available, and \nsufficient funds are allocated from its own budget and made promptly available for maintenance \nof roads financed from the MFF and previous grants and loans from ADB. \n \n97.  Environment.  Roads  and  related  infrastructure  are  designed  and  operated  in \naccordance with applicable laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), and all \nsteps are taken to (i) prepare, during the detailed design stage and submit for ADB review and \napproval, an initial environmental examination report and/or environmental impact assessment \nreport, and at the point of starting of works, an environmental management plan to prevent or \nmitigate  adverse  impacts  of  each  tranche  project;  and  (ii)  monitor  implementation  of  the \nenvironmental  management  plan  and  report  on  the  status  of  each  tranche  to  ADB  every  \n6 months. \n \n ", "24  \n98.  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  In  accordance  with  applicable  laws  and \nregulations, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), and the resettlement framework (i) a \nresettlement plan is prepared after the completion of detailed design and agreed on with ADB, \nand disclosed to the affected persons (ii) all compensation is paid in a legal and transparent \nmanner before taking possession of the acquired land, structures, and other assets; (iii) as a \ncondition for commencing works in a given location, the external monitor will submit a no-\nobjection certificate to the PMO and ADB, confirming that there are no outstanding issues \nrelated to the resettlement plan implementation; and (iv) an independent resettlement/social \ndevelopment monitor is engaged to consult with local governments and communities, as well as \nnongovernment organizations and report on the resettlement plan implementation quality to the \nnational stakeholder and ADB. The monitor will submit biannual reports to MPW and ADB. \n \n99.  Gender and Development, Health, and Labor. The MFF is implemented in compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998), and contractors and consultants will be \nrequired to (i) comply with all applicable laws of Afghanistan; (ii) offer equal opportunities to men \nand women; (iii) disseminate at the work and campsites, information on the risks of sexually \ntransmitted  diseases;  (iv)  provide  equal  pay  to  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  type;  \n(v) ensure that worksites and campsites are safe for all employees, service providers, public, \nand road users; and (vi) abstain from engaging persons below the legally employable age in \nAfghanistan. \n \n100.  Fiduciary Oversight. Independent auditors shall conduct audits of procurement, and \ncorrective action, including legal action, will be taken to correct actions to prevent misallocation \nof resources or recover any losses. Funds for road development and maintenance will be \nallocated and tracked through the management information system (MIS) implemented under \nADB Grant 0081-AFG. \n \n101.  Quality. The works, goods, and services procured for each project will be monitored \ncontinuously and evaluated periodically so that the designs, professional conduct, and outputs, \nas  the  case  may  be,  are  in  accordance  with  relevant  national,  regional,  and  international \nstandards, criteria, best practices, and agreements, and are in compliance with ADB\u2019s policies. \n \n102.  Security. Armed forces and police in the Investment Program areas provide protection \nrequired for smooth and uninterrupted implementation of the Investment Program. In addition, \nAfghanistan shall require service providers and works contractors in each project under the \nMFF to submit security plans as part of the bids, which will be part of the contracts, and include \nadequate financing in the project budgets to enable implementation of these plans. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n103.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and acting in the absence of the \nPresident,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  \nI recommend that the Board approve: \n \n(i)  the provision of funding under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate \nprincipal amount not exceeding $400,000,000 equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Road Network \nDevelopment  Investment  Program  upon  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in accordance with those set forth in the Framework Financing \nAgreement presented to the Board; and  \n \n ", "  25\n(ii)  the  proposal  set  out  in  para.  69  of  this  report  that  bitumen  procured  from \nnonmember countries of ADB for civil works be eligible for financing from the \nfunding provided under the Road Network Development Investment Program.  \nIf the requisite affirmative vote of Directors representing not less than two thirds \nof the total voting power of ADB's members, pursuant to Article 14(ix) of the \nArticles of Agreement of ADB, is not obtained for this recommendation and the \nBoard approves only the recommendation in para. 103 (i), then only bitumen for \ncivil works procured from member countries of ADB will be eligible for financing \nfrom  grants  under  the  multitranche  financing  facility  for  the  Road  Network \nDevelopment Investment Program.  \n \n \n \nC.

Status of Transport Infrastructure and Services \n1.  Afghanistan\u2019s  transport  system  comprises  of  road,  rail,  air,  and  inland  waterways.  \nThe official road network spans 38,500 kilometers (km): 300 km of regional roads, 4,700 km of \nnational roads, 9,700 km of provincial roads, 17,000 km of rural roads, and 3,800 km of urban \nroads.  The  total  length  of  railways  is  24.6  km,  which  are  cross-border  extensions  from \nTurkmenistan  and  Uzbekistan  to  transshipment  yards  in  Towraghondi  and  Kheyrabad, \nrespectively (about 10 km and 15 km from the respective borders). Inland waterways are limited \nto the Amu Darya and its tributaries,1 although only the formal inland port at Shirkhan Bandar is \noperational at present. There are more than 60 airports and airfields spread across the country. \nThere are two international and 22 domestic airports that meet International Civil Aviation \nOrganization (ICAO) Class 4 categorization standards.2 By 2010, the Kabul International Airport \nand Herat Airport are expected to achieve full international ICAO compliance while Mazar-i-\nSharif, Jalalabad, and Kandahar will be upgraded.  \n \n2.  At the end of 2001, more than 90% of the transport system was unconnected and in \npoor condition. Since then, the donors have helped improve key infrastructure, especially roads. \nAbout 86% of the regional road network is scheduled to be operational by end 2008 with the \nremainder to be completed by 2010. Work is underway or funding has been obtained for the \nremaining regional roads, with the exception of a 50 km section east of Herat. The improved \nroads include almost 2,100 km (63%) of regional roads, 650 km (14%) of national roads, and \n6,000 km of provincial and rural roads. Roads serve 90% of the national and regional travel \ndemand. \n \n3.  Rail  services  at  Hairatan  take  in  4\u20135  trains  per  day  with  30  cars  each.  Traffic  at \nTorghundi  is  two  trains  per  day  with  20\u201325  cars  each.  The  major  imports  are  petroleum \nproducts and humanitarian food aid and at Torghundi, scrap metal is transshipped by truck to \nPakistan. There is little reverse traffic except for some seasonal fruit. The Kabul International \nAirport handled approximately 0.5 million international and domestic passengers in 2005, and \ncivil aviation generated about $40 million from commercial overflights and airport taxes.   \n \n4.  In 2007, registered vehicles included over 300,000 cars, 40,000 buses, 100,000 trucks, \n100,000 motorcycles, and 5,000 rickshaws. Vehicle numbers increased rapidly, with annual \ngrowth over the past 3 years of 23% for cars, 15% for trucks, 48% for motorcycles, but only 2% \nfor buses and rickshaws. Virtually all vehicles are second-hand imports from Japan and Europe. \n \n5.  Domestic  air  passenger  and  freight  services  are  provided  by  the  state  carrier  and \nseveral private carriers. At least daily flights are available between Kabul and most cities.  \nInternational services between Kabul and several Asian destinations are provided currently by \nboth national and international carriers. A private foundation operates a passenger ferry three to \nfour times daily to Tajikistan. Tajikistan\u2019s state-owned barge service ferries trucks a few times \nper day, depending on traffic. A road bridge across the Pyanzh River near to Sirkhan Bandar \nwas  completed  in  2007  with  funding  from  the  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment. The traffic potential through this border crossing is significant and plans are being \nmade for full border facilities. \n                                                 \n1  Dachiku,  Kiyoshi  and  Azeem  Tahir.  2002.

Two hundred and fifty-three private bus companies\u2014135 based in Kabul and 118 in the \nprovinces\u2014with a fleet of 38,568 buses operate intercity services on the regional and national \nroads. The remaining buses are 8- to 12-seat vans owned by individuals providing informal \npassenger transport services in the cities and connections between rural areas and towns.  \nThe only cross-border bus service is between Jalalabad and Peshawar. An estimated 45 million \npassenger trips were made by bus transport in 2005.  \n \n7.  More than 150 registered taxi companies operate in the country\u201453 in Kabul with a fleet \nof 16,309 taxis and 108 in the provinces with a fleet of 30,248. In 2007, the taxi fares varied \nfrom $0.01/km to $0.03/km depending on various classes of passenger vehicles and terrain \ntypes for paved roads, whereas it varied from $0.015/km to $0.03/km for unpaved roads. \nOperators pay a 3% commission to the Government at provincial or national borders and at the \noutskirts of major towns. \n \n8.  Freight is carried primarily in private owned trucks. The truck population is approximately \n20% heavy articulated trucks with the remaining 80% divided equally into heavy, medium, and \nlight or pickup classes. Freight charges are approximately $0.07/ton-km on paved roads and \n$0.08/ton-km on unpaved roads. A 5% commission per trip is levied by the Government. There \nare no special transit charges and foreign trucks transporting freight through Afghanistan are \ncharged the 5% commission only. \n \nB.  Institutional and Regulatory Frameworks \n9.  Multiple government ministries are involved in operating and regulating the transport \nsector: Ministry of Public Works (MPW), Ministry of Transportation and Civil Aviation (MOTCA), \nMinistry of Urban Development (MOUD), Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development \n(MRRD), Ministry of Interior (MOI). Local authorities are also involved. In the road subsector, \nMPW  is  assigned  the  responsibility  for  planning,  designing,  constructing,  and  maintaining \nregional, national, and provincial roads. MRRD is responsible for rural roads, and MOUD and \nthe local authorities administer the urban roads. There have been discussions at a high level \nabout governance of the sector transitioning to international best practices within the Afghan \ncontext. This is expected to be achieved by merging the MPW, MOTCA, plus those units in \nMRRD, MOI, and MOUD dealing with transport into a single Ministry of Transport by 2009.  \n \n10.  MPW has a workforce of approximately 200 engineers and administrative staff, as well \nas 2,000 laborers at the regional maintenance centers and provinces. At present, however, it \nserves as administrator for donor-financed projects and executor of budget-financed minor \nconstruction  and  maintenance  works.  MOTCA  issues  operating  and  transit  permits,  sets \ntechnical standards and tariffs, collects road-user fees, and enforces standards and tariffs. \nIt also provides passenger and freight transport services using state-owned vehicles. Legislation \nin 2008 has authorized the Government to provide nationwide freight and passenger services. \nMOI carries out vehicle registration and administers driver training, testing, and driver licensing. \n \nC.  Policy and Legal Frameworks \n11.  Afghanistan is yet to formulate a transport policy. However, the Afghanistan National \nDevelopment  Strategy  (ANDS),  which  was  launched  in  April  2008,  guides  investment  and \nreforms in the sector. In the road subsector, the MPW Strategy under the ANDS calls for \ninvestments to upgrade and maintain the ring road and roads to neighboring countries by the \nend of 2009, as well as to establish a fiscally sustainable system for road maintenance using \nprivate contractors as much as possible by 2008. Also, it calls for 40% of all villages to be \nconnected  by  all-weather  roads  to  the  national  road  system  and  40%  of  all  roads  in \nmunicipalities to be improved to a good standard by 2010. The current situation is that 86% of \n ", " 34  Appendix 2 \nthe regional road network is scheduled for completion by end-2008 and the remaining length will \ncompleted by 2009 or 2010. \n \n12.  In  addition  to  the  Civil  Aviation  Law,  Law  of  Highway  Traffic,  Law  on  Regulating \nMovement and Function of Land Transportation Vehicles, Law for Punishment of Transport \nViolators, and Law for International Transit and Transport, which have direct relevance to the \nsector,  much  new  legislation  affecting  its  performance  has  been  enacted  or  existing  laws \namended in the past 5 years. Among these are the Environment Law, Law on Preservation of \nHistoric and Cultural Artifacts, Customs Law, Procurement Law, and the Law on Taxing Driving \nPermits for Motor Vehicles. \n \nD.  Challenges and Opportunities in the Road Subsector \n13.  Donors have invested an estimated $3 billion on improving roads and building road \nsubsector institutions in Afghanistan. The contribution of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nthese efforts stood at over $600 million by the end of 2007. There are positive signs and strong \nevidence of the contribution of the road subsector to fostering economic growth and reducing \nprovincial disparities. The reduction in travel time due to the improved regional roads has \nreportedly increased the frequency of personal trips and domestic trade. MPW is preparing for \nthe creation of the Afghanistan Highway Authority to function as a road network manager with \nall works outsourced to private contractors. \n \n14.  However, the road network, with a density of 4 km per 1,000 km2 of land and only 7% of \nit paved, is inadequate to spur economic growth. Four provincial capitals remain unconnected to \nthe regional network, which provides access to domestic and regional markets, and more than \n70%  of  the  interprovincial  and  interdistrict  roads  remain  in  a  poor  state.  Many  roads  are \nimpassable by motor vehicles, and people in the mountainous central part of the country do not \nhave all-weather access to the main road network. Likewise, transport services are inadequate, \nof low quality, and expensive. \n \n15.  As depicted in the problem tree in Figure A2, this situation is a consequence of myriad \ndeficiencies  in  policy,  legal,  institutional,  and  regulatory  frameworks.  Corrections  to  these \ndeficiencies may take many years to design, finance, and implement. For instance, almost  \n$1 billion more is needed to fully implement the road sector component of ANDS. First and \nforemost, there should be a transport policy that is in accordance with the cultural, social, and \npolitical characters of the people and governments. \n \n16.  In the interim, road investment efficiency should be increased by shortening project \ncycles  and  adhering  to  budgets.  This  requires  the  use  of  innovative  technical  designs, \nprocurement planning, contracting methods, and monitoring schemes. Donors, including ADB, \nare financing advisory services that could facilitate the use of these approaches, but, in the long \nterm, MPW\u2019s overall business process has to be revised. This includes the processes in such \nnonoperational areas as public-relations and marketing, as well as to reform the pricing and \nregulatory policies of MOTCA or the entity that would eventually be responsible for these \nfunctions. The main donors, by remaining engaged with the Government, coordinating their \nactivities, and facilitating change within MPW, can help provide equal accessibility and mobility \nin all parts of Afghanistan by 2020. \n \n ", " \nFigure A2: Problem Tree Analysis of the Road Subsector \n \nContinuing Conflict Persistent Poverty\nProvincial Economic \nand Social Disparity \nLack and High Cost of  Low Density and \nTransport Services Connectivity of Roads\nArchaic Tariff and  High Capital Cost of  Lack of Service  High Cost of  Inadequate Landuse  Inadequate  Multi-Agency and Multi-\nLicensing Structures  Vehicles Information to Users Dispersed Population Construction Planning Maintenance Jurisdictional \nR ibilit\nWeak Regulatory  Limited Leasing and  Lack of Sector  Lack of Experienced  Inadequate Donor \nDifficult Terrain\nCapacity of MOTCA Financing Options Coordination  Contractors Coordination\nLack of Scientific \nHigh Import Duties Security Threat\nMaintenance Program \nInadequate Oversight  Inadequate Oversight \nby MPW by MPW\nLack of Technical  Irregular and \nPersonnel/Experience Insufficient Funds\nHighly Centralized \nDecision-Making \nAbsence of Timely \nFinancing \nInfant National \nConstruction Industry\nA\nRising Price of  p\nMaterials pe\nn\nMOTCA = Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, MPW = Ministry of Public Works.  d\nix\nSource: Asian Development Bank.   2\n   \n3\n5\n \n ", " 36  Appendix 3 \nROAD MAP AND INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Road Map \n1.  In  April  2008,  the  Government  of  Afghanistan  (the  Government)  launched  the \nAfghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS) with the aim of fostering economic growth \nthrough systematic investments in infrastructure and governance improvements in the next  \n5 years, among other measures. ANDS is the country\u2019s overarching strategy for promoting \ngrowth, generating wealth, and reducing poverty and vulnerability. It has many components and \ntargets for the key sectors of the economy to be achieved between 2008 and 2020. The road \nsector component of ANDS, known as the MPW (Ministry of Public Works) Strategy, commits \nthe Government of Afghanistan (the Government) to (i) developing a network of all-weather \nroads, constructed to national standards;1 (ii) preserving of the road network through better \nmaintenance; (iii) outsourcing all civil works and specialized technical services to the private \nsector;  (iv)  greater  cooperation  with  neighboring  governments  and  departments;  and  \n(v) reforming MPW. It calls for physical investments to improve all key regional and national \nroads including (i) completion of the so-called \u201cring road\u201d, which is the circular regional road with \nlinks to all the neighboring countries; and (ii) improvements to the remaining national roads that \nlink the provincial capitals to the regional road network listed in Table A3.1. This strategy would \nenhance network connectivity to a basic level, which in turn would help expand domestic and \nregional  trade  and  also  overcome  provincial  disparities  while  providing  mobility  to  more \nAfghans. ANDS also calls for half of the villages to be connected to a national road by all-\nweather roads and for 40% of all municipal roads to be in good condition by 2010.  \n \n2.  Realization  of  these  road  improvement  targets  depends  upon  several  factors:  \n(i) capacity of MPW (which is in charge of regional, national, and provincial roads) and of the \nMinistry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (which is responsible for rural roads planning, \nprocuring works and services, and overseeing works); (ii) timely availability of resources (labor, \nmaterial, and financing); (iii) efficiency of passenger and freight transport services; and (iv) the \nsecurity  situation  in  the  country.  For  these  reasons,  the  MPW  Strategy  also  calls  for  key \nnonphysical investments to improve institutional capacity, governance, fiduciary controls, and \nroad network management skills at MPW. Furthermore, the MPW Strategy calls for creating the \nAfghanistan Highway Authority (AHA) plus revising tariffs and vehicles licensing to increase the \nefficiency  of  road  transport  services  by  2013.  Moreover,  ongoing  works,  which  have \nexperienced cost escalations due to increases in materials prices, are scheduled for completion \nin 2010. \n \nB.  Strategic Context \n3.  Afghanistan provides access to trade along the North\u2013South Asia and East\u2013West Asia \ncorridors, especially in Central Asia. It also plays a special role in the Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation (CAREC) program, which supports investments in transport, energy, and \ntrade. Roads connect Afghanistan to the outside world, but they also connect cities, towns, and \nvillages within the country. Road sector investments are visible and yield results, both tangible \nand  intangible.  They  increase  the  impacts  of  the  other  two  sectors  that  ADB  supports  in \nAfghanistan, namely energy and agriculture, by linking markets, products, and people. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Public Works. 2007. Afghanistan Interim Road Standards. Kabul. \n ", "Appendix 3  37\nC.  Policy Framework \n4.  The national transport policy is presently guided by the MPW Strategy that outlines the \nprinciples and vision of the transport sector. The MPW Strategy forms the basis for further policy \nmaking following the enactment of legislation in 2008 to bring all modes of transport under one \numbrella ministry. \n \nD.  Investment Program \n5.  The Road Network Development Investment Program (the Investment Program) is an \nintegral part of the MPW Strategy. That strategy sets out several ambitious targets and timelines \nfor the road subsector, the main ones being to construct more than 5,000 km of national and \nprovincial roads by 2011, set up a fiscally sustainable road maintenance system to effectively \nand  efficiently  maintain  7,000  km  of  roads  within  1  year,  improve  safety,  implement  a \ntransparent cost recovery plan, and achieve structural reform of MPW. The MPW Strategy \nwould, by improving basic road network connectivity, increase efficiency of travel and trade \nwithin the country and with its neighbors, thereby relieving some of Afghanistan\u2019s economic and \nsocial constraints of being landlocked. The key national roads that must be improved to meet \nthis goal are shown in Table A3.1. The indicative investment plan is shown in Table A3.2 and \nthe indicative schedule of nonphysical investments is shown in Table A3.3. In concert, the \nphysical and nonphysical investments will improve transport efficiency and reduce provincial \nincome disparities. \n \n6.  Investments  in  small-scale,  community-level  infrastructure  and  services,  (e.g. \nimprovements to water wells, drinking water, schools, and clinics) are a special feature. This is \na win-win proposition for all\u2014the Government, contractors, and consultants\u2014due to greater \nbuy-in  from  the  villages  and  thus  lower  security  risks.  The  Government  will  fund  these \ninvestments to coincide with the implementation schedule for the larger investments.  \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n7.  Implementation of the Investment Program over the medium term is estimated to cost \nabout $1.25 billion. As shown in Table A3.4, about $950 million of that amount is available at \npresent  for  part  of  that  investment.  The  Government  is  actively  pursuing  other  financing \nopportunities to enable the Investment Program to be fully implemented. \n \n \n ", " \n3\nTable A3.1: Roads Programmed for Improvement (2008\u20132013) 8\n \nEstimated  Master Plan \nLength  A\nYear Road Number         From        To     Province Cost  Notes Rating      p\n(km) p\n($ million) (100 max) e\nn\n     RH05    Kabul    Jalalabad     Nangerhar       160                90  Detailed design completed \u2014 dix\n     NH43    Fayzabad    Ishkashim     Badakhshan       100                50  Detailed design completed 76  3\n \n2009 Works to be procured under \n     NH05/20    Dara I Suf    Yakawlang     Bamyan       180              120 \ndesign-build contract \u2014\n     NH04    Jabalussaraj    Sorubi     Kapisa        90                50  Detailed design completed 85\nLinks Nuristan capital to \n     NH02    Mihtarlam (RH05)    Nuristan      Laghman       100                70  82\n2010 regional highway \n     NH41A    Dara I Suf   Bamyan    Samangan      150              150  77\n     NH44    Taluqan     Yangi Qala     Takhar       100                90  90\n     NH42    Khulm   Kunduz    Kunduz      130                60  89\n2012\n     NH05    Chaharikar    Bamyan     Parwan       160              110  87\n     NH21    Larshkar Ghah   Khanishim    Hilmand      160                90  82\n2013\n     NH11    Sharan    Zurmat     Paktiya         50                30  79\nSubtotal   1,380              910 \nMaintenance    1,500              300 \nTotal    2,880           1,210 \n\u2014 = not available, km = kilometer.\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n ", " \nTable A3.2: Indicative Investment Plan \n($ million) \nTotal \nInvestment   2002\u20132007  2008  2009 2010 2011 2012  2013\n2008\u20132013 \nA.

The Government requested for ADB\u2019s approval for awarding three civil works contracts \nvalued at a total of $127.7 million to the lowest bidders. However, these bids were substantially \nhigher than the estimated values of the packages stated in the report and recommendation of \nthe President. There is a provision of $100.7 million under the loan and grants for the civil \nworks. Therefore, there was a funding gap of $27 million. ADB approved award of the contracts \non the understanding that the Government would bridge the gap in funding.  \n \n10.  Due to the paucity of funding for road network development, however, the Government \nnow  requests  ADB  to  provide  supplementary  funding  of  $28  million  from  the  multitranche \nfinancing facility to complete the subproject. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 5  47\nTable A5.8: Details of Contracts Awarded \nAmount of \nDate of  Date of  Contract  Original Date \nContract  Award  Commencement  ($ million)  of Completion \nCivil Works Contract Pkg. 1\u2013Mazar to \nNov\u201907  May\u201908  30.93  May\u201911 \nPul-e-Baraq \nCivil Works Contract Pkg. 2\u2013Pul-e-Baraq \nNov\u201907  May\u201908  37.69  May\u201911 \nto Dar-I-Suf \nConsultancy Construction Supervision \nMay\u201908  May\u201908  3.24  May\u201911 \n(Pkg. 1)\u2013Mazar to Dar-I-Suf \nCivil Works Contract Pkg. 3\u2013Bamyan to \nNov\u201907  May\u201908  59.05  Oct\u201911 \nYakawlang  \nConsultancy Construction Supervision \nJan\u201908  April\u201908  2.61  Sep\u201911 \n(Pkg. 2)\u2013Bamyan to Yakawlang \nJan = January, Nov = November, Oct = October, Pkg = package, Sep = September. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTable A5.9: Revised Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n    Original  Revised  Funding \nItem  Cost  Cost  Gap \nA.

The Government has established a PMU in MPW fully staffed to implement \nthe project. The PMU maintains separate accounts and records for within MPW subproject.  \nThe audited financial statements for 2008 are due by December 2008. The Government has \n ", " 48  Appendix 5 \nbeen allocating adequate funds on a yearly basis for routine maintenance and emergency \nworks.

The Government shall ensure that \nadequate road safety measures are incorporated into the design of the subproject. \n \n  5.  Current Status \n12.  The contractor was given notice to proceed with works in May 2008. Although MPW \ninitiated the procurement activities in September 2006, the loan and grants became effective in \nJanuary  2007,  the  civil  works  contracts  could  be  awarded  only  in  November  2007.  \nThe procurement process was prolonged due to the time taken in finalizing the bid documents. \nFurther,  MPW  did  not  have  the  requisite  human  resources  to  independently  handle  this \nsubproject. MPW has so far recruited a separate project manager for this subproject, and \ntherefore no further delay is contemplated. The bid documents and other details required have \nsince been standardized. Moreover, MPW has initiated recruitment of project managers for \nfuture projects. Therefore, MPW can avoid such delays in future. \n ", "Appendix 6  49\n \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLANS \nTable A6.1: Multitranche Financing Facility \n \nFinancing Plan \nCost Estimates  $ million  % \n% Base  ADB  AFG \nItem  $ Million  Costs  ADB  AFG  Total  Share  Share \nA.

An economic assessment was performed on the two subprojects of Tranche 1 Project,1 \nfor which supplementary financing is proposed from the multitranche financing facility. The \nassessment  aimed  to  determine  the  impact  on  the  economic  benefits  of  supplementary \nfinancing that is provided to complete physical works in the subprojects. This was assessed in \nrelation to the net present values (NPVs), economic internal rates of return (EIRRs), and the \nsensitivities of the NPVs and EIRRs to further increases in costs and decreases in benefits. \n \n2.  Economic analyses of the subprojects were conducted during appraisal of these projects \nin  2003,  2004,  and  2006.  These  analyses,  contained  in  the  corresponding  reports  and \nrecommendations  of  the  President,  indicated  that  the  subprojects  are  economically  viable. \nTable A9.1 summarizes the economic analyses. \n \nTable A9.1: Summary of Economic Analyses \nItem  EIRR (%) NPV ($ million) \nLoan 2140 (Year 2004)     \nContracts 2 and 3  19.1  54.8a \n     \nLoan 2257 (Year 2006)b     \nMazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf Section  29.9  82.3 \nBamian\u2013Yakawlang Section  20.6  28.2 \n     \n  Total Project  25.8  110.6 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \na  Against the previous project cost estimates as given in the PFR-1. \nb  EIRR and NPVs as calculated from the cost and benefit streams given in the \nRRP for Loan 2257. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n3.  The previous analyses were carried out following Asian Development Bank\u2019s guidelines \nby  comparing  the  with-  and  without-project  scenarios  that  weighed  the  savings  in  vehicle \noperating costs and travel time costs gained from each subproject against the initial investment \ncosts and the savings in future periodic and routine maintenance costs over a 20-year period. \nThe cost and benefits were estimated according to base year traffic and projected traffic over \nthe subprojects\u2019 life horizons, exiting pavement conditions, design parameters, and unit value of \ntravel time. The economic analyses indicated that the subprojects would provide between 19% \nand 25% returns, with correspondingly large positive NPVs, and that the results would be quite \nrobust. \n \n4.  The estimated supplementary financing of $60 million will be allocated to civil works of \nthe subprojects as shown in Table A9.2 to meet the cost increases due to: \n(i)  bid prices being higher than available funds for improvement of the Andkhoy to \nQaisar section of the ring road implemented under Loan 2140, and \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

The impact of increase in economic cost on NPV and EIRR was assessed by assuming \nthat the economic benefits remain unchanged. The increase in economic cost was estimated \nusing a standard conversion factor of 0.9 to convert the financial cost. The estimated increases \nin economic costs of the subprojects in 2008 were discounted at a rate of 12% in order to adjust \nthem to the base year values. The base years for the economic analyses of Loans 2140 and \n2257 were 2004 and 2006, respectively. The impact of the increased costs on NPVs and EIRRs \nare summarized in Table A9.3. \n \nTable A9.3: Impact of Increased Cost on NPVs and EIRRs \nDiscounted  NPV with  EIRR with \nNPV at  EIRR at  Increase in  Supplementary  Supplementary \nAppraisal  Appraisal  Economic Cost Financing  Financing \nProject  ($ million)  (%)  ($ million)  ($ million)  (%) \nLoan 2140  54.8  19.1  12.0  42.7  16.2 \n(Year 2004) \nLoan 2257  110.6  25.8  22.3  88.2  22.0 \n(Year 2006) \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n6.

Purpose of the Environmental Assessment and Review Framework \n1.  This environmental assessment and review framework (EARF) has been developed to \nguide  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  (MPW),  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  staff,  road \ndesigners,  supervision  consultants,  and  construction  contractors  in  carrying  out  the \nenvironmental  assessment  and  relevant  mitigation  and  monitoring  activities  required  when \ndesigning and implementing subprojects to be financed under the multitranche financing facility \n(MFF).  \n \n2.  The EARF is based on the existing regulatory and technical frameworks in Afghanistan \nfor environmental management and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). Consequently, within the \ncontext of the continuing efforts by Afghanistan to improve environmental protection in the \ncountry, the EARF will be periodically reviewed and revised, in consultation with ADB, on the \nbasis of experience gained during implementation and changes, if any, in Afghanistan\u2019s or \nADB\u2019s policies, regulations, and institutional arrangements. Revisions may also be introduced \nduring the preparation of periodic financing requests for subsequent tranches. \n \nB.  Environmental Criteria for Subproject Selection \n3.  Subprojects selected for financing the MMF shall: \n(i)  avoid passing through any designated wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, other \nsanctuaries,  or  area  of  international  significance  (e.g.,  protected  wetland \ndesignated by the Wetland Convention); and \n(ii)  avoid, as much as possible, passing through any cultural heritage designated by \nUNESCO.  \n \nC.  Environmental Assessment Requirements \n  1.  National Environmental Policies \n4.  The Government of Afghanistan (the Government) approved and adopted the first-ever \nenvironmental framework law in 2005 (i.e., Environment Act, 2005) with an aim to include and \naddress  environmental  issues  in  the  process  of  development.  Subsequently,  the  National \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (NEPA), an independent agency, was set up in 2005 for \nenvironmental governance in the country. NEPA has overall responsibility to address policy and \nlegal  issues  as  well  as  environmental  management  in  coordination  with  other  related \ndepartments. NEPA reports directly to the Office of the President. \n \n5.  In coordination with other government offices and external agencies, NEPA is in the \nprocess of drafting environmental regulations and guidelines for the country\u2019s environmental \nmanagement. Presently, there exist the following environmental regulations, guidelines, and \npolicies in Afghanistan:  \n(i)  Environmental Law, 2006, Islamic Republic of Afghanistan; \n(ii)  Interim Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations, NEPA, Islamic Republic \nof Afghanistan; \n(iii)  Administrative  Guidelines  for  the  Preparation  of  Environmental  Impact \nAssessments, March 2007 (draft 2): NEPA, Islamic Republic of Afghanistan; and \n(iv)  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Policy\u2014\u201cAn  Integrated  Approach  to \nEnvironmental Impact Assessment in Afghanistan,\u201d August 2006, NEPA, Islamic \nRepublic of Afghanistan. \n \n ", "Appendix 10  63\n6.  Environment  Act,  2005.  The  Environment  Act  was  approved  by  the  Cabinet  in \nDecember 2005. The Act contains the tailor-made legal frameworks needed to sustainably \nmanage Afghanistan\u2019s natural resources and rehabilitate its damaged environment. The Act \nalso  clarifies  institutional  responsibilities  and  contains  the  compliance  and  enforcement \nprovisions required to allow the Government to enforce the legislation. The law is a fundamental \nprerequisite to enable NEPA to fulfill its mandate. The primary objectives of the Act are to \n(i)  improve living conditions and protect the health of humans, fauna, and flora; \n(ii)  maintain ecological functions and evolutionary processes; \n(iii)  secure the needs and interests of present and future generations; \n(iv)  conserve natural and cultural heritages; and \n(v)  facilitate  the  reconstruction  and  sustainable  development  of  the  national \neconomy.  \n \n7.  The Environment Act was developed by NEPA over a period of 2 years with the support \nand  technical  advice  of  the  United  Nations  Environment  Programme  (UNEP)  and  the \nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature and international experts. UNEP also facilitated \nan  extensive  national  consultation  process  on  the  draft  act  with  all  national  stakeholders \n(ministries, quasi-government agencies, and civic society) and other interested parties (United \nNations agencies, ADB, World Bank, International Union for Conservation of Nature, United \nStates  Agency  for  International  Development).  UNEP  is  supporting  NEPA  in  developing \nregulations subsequent to the Environment Act (particularly in the fields of environmental \nimpact assessment, integrated pollution control, and compliance and enforcement) and \nthe institutional processes and systems required to adequately and effectively implement \nthe Environment Act. \n \n8.  Administrative Guidelines for Preparation of Environmental Impact Assessments, \nMarch 2007 (Draft 2). The guidelines are in a draft form prepared by NEPA in coordination with \nUNEP.  The  purpose  of  the  guidelines  is  to  provide  guidance  to  project  proponents  while \nundertaking  development  projects  that  may  have  potential  impacts  on  the  environment.  \nThey also provide guidance on how the public should be consulted and define the roles and \nresponsibilities of various stakeholders in that process. \n \n9.  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Policy\u2014\u201cAn  Integrated  Approach  to \nEnvironmental Impact Assessment in Afghanistan,\u201d August 2006. NEPA, with assistance \nfrom UNEP, has developed the environmental impact assessment (EIA) policy. The policy \nstipulates  broad  guidelines  for  project  proponents  on  integrating  EIA  into  the  process  of \ndevelopment, and procedures to address environmental consequences and involve necessary \ninstitutions in the process of project implementation. The policy has yet to be approved by the \nCabinet (Ministry of Justice), which is necessary for it to obtain statutory status with regard to \nproject proponents. \n \n10.  Interim Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations, NEPA (Draft 2.3). These \nregulations  govern the process of environmental impact assessment in Afghanistan on an \ninterim  basis  pending  establishment  of  the  EIA  board  of  experts  under  Article  20  of  the \nEnvironment  Law  and  issuing  of  final  regulations.  These  regulations  provide  the  detailed \nprocess of EIA and divide the projects into categories A and B based on potential impacts.  \nIn  accordance  with  Article  13(1)  of  the  Environment  Law,  these  regulations  apply  to  the \nfollowing prohibited activities: \n(i)  Category A activities, set out in Schedule I of the Regulations, are those activities \nlikely  to  have  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  that  are  sensitive, \n ", " 64  Appendix 10 \ndiverse, or unprecedented, and that will impact a broader area than the sites or \nfacilities subject to the physical works of the activity. \n(ii)  Category B activities, set out in Schedule I of the Regulations, are those activities \nlikely  to  have  significant  adverse  impacts  on  human  environments  or \nenvironmentally sensitive areas that are less adverse than those of category A \nactivities, are site-specific, and in most instances are not irreversible. \n(iii)  Any activity that is likely to have significant adverse impact on the environment of \nan area that has been determined by NEPA to be an environmentally sensitive \narea.  \n(iv)  Any  other  activity  that  is  likely  to  have  a  significant  adverse  impact  on  the \nenvironment and is determined by NEPA to be a prohibited activity.  \n \n  2.  ADB Environmental Safeguards Requirements \n11.  Environment Policy (2002). ADB\u2019s Environment Policy mandates consideration for the \nenvironment in all aspects of ADB operations. The Environment Policy and Operations Manuel \n(OM)  20:  Environmental  Considerations  in  ADB  Operations  outlines  ADB\u2019s  environmental \nassessment  procedures  and  requirements.  To  facilitate  implementation  of  the  Environment \nPolicy and OM 20, environmental assessment guidelines were prepared.  \n \n12.  Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). These guidelines provide a holistic \napproach for the user for integrating environmental considerations into ADB operations. They \nprovide project categorization and procedures to undertake environmental impact assessment \nbased on significant potential impacts. ADB categorizes projects into categories A, B, C, and FI \naccording to the significance of likely impacts. The categorization criteria are as follow: \n(i)  Category  A.  Projects  with  potential  for  significant  adverse  environmental \nimpacts: An EIA is required to address significant impacts. \n(ii)  Category B. Project judged to have some adverse impacts, but of lesser degree \nand/or significance than category A: An initial environmental examination (IEE) is \nrequired  to  determine  whether  or  not  significant  environmental  impacts \nwarranting an EIA are likely. If an EIA is not needed, the IEE is regarded as the \nfinal environmental assessment report. \n(iii)  Category C. Projects unlikely to have adverse impacts: No EIA or IEE required, \nalthough environmental implications are still reviewed. \n(iv)  Category FI. Projects are classified as category FI if they involve a credit line \nthrough  a  financial  intermediary  or  an  equity  investment  in  a  financial \nintermediary.  The  financial  intermediary  must  apply  an  environmental \nmanagement system, unless all subprojects will result in insignificant impacts. \n \n13.  Based  on  the  Government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental  policies,  the  projects  to  be \nfinanced under the MFF will be subject to the following requirements: \n(i)  A requirement for environmental assessment of each subproject depends on its \npotential  impacts.  Based  on  these  potential  impacts,  and  using  ADB\u2019s  rapid \nenvironmental assessment, a subproject will be classified in accordance with the \nGovernment\u2019s and ADB\u2019s environmental assessment guidelines.  \n(ii)  For each category A project, an EIA including an EMP is required. For each \ncategory B project, an IEE including EMP is required. \n(iii)  A project will be categorized as A if the project \n(a)  requires a complex mitigation measure needing to be prepared through \nan in-depth assessment of the impacts and detailed study for preparing \nmitigation measures;  \n ", "Appendix 10  65\n(b)  will generate impact on an ecologically sensitive area, particularly if the \nproject (1) passes through or is located less than 100 meters from any \ndesignated wildlife sanctuary, national park, other sanctuary, botanical \ngarden, or area of international significance (e.g., a protected wetland \ndesignated by the Wetland Convention); (2) is located within 300 meters \nof a coastline; or (3) passes through any cultural heritage designated by \nUNESCO; or \n(c)  involves establishment of a bypass or new alignment passing through any \necologically  sensitive  areas  (hilly  or  mountainous,  forested,  wetlands, \nnearby estuarine, or other area with important ecological function). \n(iv)  Road upgrading and rehabilitation subprojects that do not fall into the above \nclassification are classified as B. \n \nD.

MPW\u2019s Responsibilities \n15.  MPW will be responsible for the following: \n(i)  Prepare environmental screening checklist and classify projects in consultation \nwith NEPA and other departments. \n(ii)  Based on the environmental classification of projects, prepare terms of reference \nto conduct IEE or EIA studies. \n(iii)  Hire an environmental consultant to prepare IEE or EIA reports including EMP \nand summary EIA for public disclosure.  \n(iv)  Ensure that an IEE or EIA are prepared in compliance with the requirements of \nthe Government and ADB, and that adequate consultation with affected people is \nundertaken in accordance with ADB requirements. \n(v)  Undertake review of the IEE or EIA, summary EIA, and EMP reports to ensure \ntheir compliance with the requirements of the Government and ADB. \n(vi)  Obtain necessary permits and/or clearance, as required, from NEPA and other \nrelevant government agencies, ensuring that all necessary regulatory clearances \nare obtained before commencing any civil work on the relevant sections. \n(vii)  Submit  to  ADB  the  IEE  or  EIA,  summary  EIA,  and  EMP  reports  and  other \ndocuments, as necessary.  \n(viii)  Ensure  that  any  EMP  including  relevant  mitigation  measures  needing  to  be \nincorporated during the construction stage by the contractor are included in the \nbidding documents. \n(ix)  Ensure that contractors have access to the EIA or IEE and EMP reports of the \nprojects. \n(x)  Ensure  that  contractors  understand  their  responsibilities  to  mitigate \nenvironmental problems associated with their construction activities.  \n(xi)  Ensure and monitor that an EMP including an environmental monitoring plan will \nbe properly implemented.  \n(xii)  In  case  unpredicted  environmental  impacts  occur  during  the  project \nimplementation stage, prepare and implement as necessary an environmental \nemergency program in consultation with NEPA, any other relevant government \nagencies, and ADB. \n(xiii)  In  case  a  project  needs  to  be  realigned  during  implementation,  review  the \nenvironmental  classification,  revise  it  accordingly,  and  identify  whether  a \n ", " 66  Appendix 10 \nsupplementary  IEE  or  EIA  study  is  required.  If  yes,  prepare  the  terms  of \nreference for undertaking a supplementary IEE or EIA and hire an environmental \nconsultant to carry out the study. \n(xiv)  Submit annual reports on implementing EMPs, including implementation of an \nenvironmental emergency program, if any, to NEPA and ADB. \n \n  2.  ADB Responsibilities \n16.  ADB is responsible for the following: \n(i)  Review IEE and/or EIA reports and the rapid environmental assessment checklist \nas a basis to issue approval for the project. \n(ii)  Undertake periodic monitoring of the EMP implementation and due diligence as \npart of an overall project review mission. \n(iii)  If  required,  provide  advice  to  MPW  in  carrying  out  its  responsibilities  to \nimplement the EMP for the project. \n \n  3.  Compliance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Policy\u2014Due Diligence \n17.  MPW  has  the  responsibility  to  undertake  environmental  due  diligence  and  monitor \nimplementation of environmental mitigation measures for all projects under each respective \nresponsibility. The due diligence report as well as monitoring of EMP implementation (described \nin the annual report) need to be documented systematically. ADB must be given access as \nneeded to undertake environmental due diligence for all projects.  \n \n  4.  Public Disclosure \n18.  MPW  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  environmental  assessment  documents, \nincluding  the  environmental  due  diligence  and  monitoring  reports,  are  properly  and \nsystematically kept as part of the project record of each project under its responsibility. \n \n19.  All environmental documents are subject to public disclosure. These documents should \nbe made available to the public, if requested \n \nE.  Institutional Setup and Implementation Arrangements \n  1.  Implementation \n20.  MPW will be the Executing Agency of the Investment Program. Project management \nstaff of MPW have already been assigned to monitor and oversee implementation. The project \nmanagement staff at present are headed by a project director and supported by three project \nmanagers, an accountant, and an information technology specialist. External advisors engaged \nunder  TA  4675-AFG  will  assist  MPW  in  procurement  and  administering  construction  and \nconsultancy  service  contracts  at  the  beginning.  Subsequently,  a  fully  staffed  program \nmanagement office will be established to take over the responsibility of monitoring, coordination, \nand management of the Investment Program; auditing the accounts and financial statements of \neach project; and preparation of the various progress reports.  \n \n  2.
