Almost 100% \nof the country's power generation (about 1,500 megawatts [MW]) is based on hydropower. Of the \ntotal power generated, 70% is exported to India, and power exports account for more than 40% of \nnational revenue. Nevertheless, mountainous terrain and the resultant difficulties of grid extension \nhave  kept  a  large  percentage  of  the  rural  population  out  of  access  to  clean  energy.  Traditional \nfuels, such as kerosene and fuelwood, cause indoor pollution and health burdens, particularly on \nwomen and children in rural households.  \n \n4. \nFor the purpose of poverty alleviation, the Government of Bhutan has established a goal of \nelectrifying  all  rural  households  during  the  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan. 3  Since  1995,  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has  supported  Bhutan  in  expanding  rural  electrification  through  four \nconsecutive  loan  and  grant  projects,  covering  30,000  households,  or  35%  of  the  total  rural \npopulation in Bhutan.4 As of December 2009, Bhutan had achieved rural electrification of 60% of \nall  households,  and  this  figure  is  expected  to  reach  84%  by  2012  on  the  completion  of  two \nongoing  projects  supported  by  ADB  and  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA).5 \nAfter  the  completion  of  the  government\u2019s  own  rural  electrification  program,  which  is  running  in \nparallel  with  those  projects,  around  8,500  households  will  still  be  left  for  further  electrification \nthrough grid extension. Those households are scattered in remote areas throughout the country \nand  most  of  them  are  in  the  central  and  eastern  regions  of  Bhutan,  which  are  far  from  the \ncommercial  and  industrial  centers  in  the  western  region.  As  a  state-owned  transmission  and \ndistribution  utility,  the  Bhutan  Power  Corporation  (BPC)  is  responsible  for  implementing  on-grid \nrural electrification, while the Department of Energy (DOE) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs \nlooks after implementing off-grid rural electrification.  \n \n5. \nTo achieve the overarching goal of electricity for all, 1,896 additional households will need \nto be electrified on an off-grid basis. Due to the wide spread and low density of rural communities \nand  the  mountainous  terrain,  it  is  costly  and  difficult  to  extend  distribution  lines  to  provide \nelectricity  to  remote  and  isolated  villages.  Where  the  grid  extension  is  assessed  economically \n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance:  ADB.  2009.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loans,  Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grant, Technical Assistance Grant, and Administration of Grant to the Kingdom of Bhutan for \nthe  Green  Power  Development  Project.  Manila.  Rural  electrification  and  Dagachhu  hydropower  development  are \nincluded. In parallel with this project, JICA provided a loan for rural electrification.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nunfeasible,  off-grid  electrification  has  been  pursued,  mainly  through  stand-alone  solar  home \nsystems.  Most  of  them  have  been  installed  in  rural  households  under  donor-assisted  grant \nprojects, 6 and 1,750 additional solar home systems are being installed by the government under \nthe National Solar Electrification Program. However, there were few tracking systems to identify \nthe exact location and working condition of solar home systems installed prior to 2006. This made \nit  difficult  to  conduct  regular  operations  and  maintenance  activities  or  replace  batteries  on  solar \nhome systems. To tackle these operational issues, the DOE has established (i) a comprehensive \ndatabase  system  that  records  information  about  the  solar  home  systems  installed,  and  (ii)  an \noutsourcing  operation  and  maintenance  program  through  community-based  village  technicians \ncontracted  with  the  BPC. 7  To  ensure  operational  sustainability,  these  technicians  will  have \ntechnical  backup  support,  regular  training,  and  supervision  from  BPC  customer  service  centers. \nTheir  services  will  cover  both  off-grid  and  remote  on-grid  areas  where  minor  repairs  and \nmaintenance, customer care, billing, and collection work are included.   \n \n6. \nIn Bhutan, domestic demand for electricity has been growing by 17% per year on average \nover  these  5  years.  This  demand  growth  is  expected  to  escalate  in  the  long  run  due  to  the \nincrease  in  the  number  of  new  customers  connecting  as  ongoing  rural  electrification  is \ncompleted.8 Experiences  with  rural  electrification  indicate  that  overall  electricity  consumption  will \nincrease as rural economies develop and households increasingly rely on electricity and acquire \nnew appliances. Bhutan has already experienced power shortages, particularly in the dry winter \nperiods  when  hydropower  generation  is  reduced  due  to  low  river  flows.  Despite  the  nation's \nannual net power surplus, Bhutan\u2019s power generation from run-of-the-river hydropower plants is \nvery  seasonal,  as  the  water  flows  and  levels  are  difficult  to  control  in  the  dry  season. \nConsequently, the existing generation systems have been unable to meet the recent fast-growing \ndemand during the dry winter peak periods. In the last two winters, the BPC has been forced to \nlimit power supply to industry, resulting in economic and revenue losses. In the 2010 winter, it is \nestimated that the power generation shortfall against the growing demand will be around 25 MW, \nwhich will have significant impacts on industry\u2019s production.9 The Druk Green Power Corporation \n(a  state-owned  generation  company)  also  reported  that  levels  of  water  flow  in  rivers  had  been \ndeclining  in  the  past  2  years  due  to  changes  of  monsoon  patterns,  leading  to  less  hydropower \nproduction. Increased power imports from India would not be feasible due to more severe power \ndeficits on the Indian side.  \n \n7. \nTo  improve  national  energy  security,  the  DOE  intends  to  issue  the  Renewable  Energy \nPolicy  that  aims  to  promote  alternative  renewable  energy  sources  other  than  large  hydropower, \nand  diversify  the  energy  supply  base  through  wind,  solar,  biomass,  and  small  and  micro \nhydropower.10 Based on wind mapping data and subsequent surveys,11 the pilot wind power mills \n                                                 \n6  Around 2,500 systems are in existence, or in the process of being installed by the government, based on surveys \nconducted by the government under: ADB. 2006.

Lessons have been \nincorporated in the BPC's outsourcing systems established and 30 village technicians have been deployed.  \n\n8   An  additional  30,000  households  are  expected  to  be  electrified  within  the  next  5  years.  The  BPC  had  47,846 \n\ndomestic rural customers as of 2009.  \n\n9  The 2009 winter demand had already exceeded the system peak generation of 237 MW and the overall demand \nwas anticipated to increase by the end of 2010 because of additional demand from new customers including large \nfactories and plants (e.g., cement, chemicals, and hydropower construction).  \n\n10  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Promotion of Clean Power Export Development. \n\nManila. This technical assistance (TA) has helped the government prepare the Renewable Energy Policy.  \n\n11  The  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory  of  the  United  States  Department  of  Energy  assessed  the  wind \nmapping  data.  Of  10,592  MW  of  technical  potential,  542  MW  is  estimated  available  on  the  basis  of  smaller  wind \n\n\fare  designed  to  support  this  objective.  Since  wider  rural  electrification  coverage  is  expected  to \nmake  the  domestic  demand\u2013supply  balance  even  tighter,  additional  alternative  energy  sources \nwill  need  to  be  developed  to  meet  the  country\u2019s  demand  without  reducing  exports  of  surplus \npower and its revenue-earning opportunity.12 It will be an option to export  additional power from \nrenewable energy to neighboring countries if there is surplus power in the future.            \n \n8. \nWhile electricity is useful for lighting, fuelwood is still the main source of primary energy for \ncooking  and  heating  in  rural  areas,  where  about  70%  of  the  country's  population  lives.  While \nurban households mostly use modern cleaner energy (e.g., electricity and/or liquefied petroleum \ngas) for cooking, rural households depend heavily on fuelwood,13 which emits indoor air pollutants \nand poses a health hazard.14 Consumption of fuelwood in Bhutan is about 1.2 tons per capita per \nyear,  which  is  the  highest  consumption  in  the  world  (and  twice  as  high  as  Nepal).  The  survey \nconducted under the ADB project preparatory technical assistance (TA) indicated that most rural \npeople often cut down trees in  exchange  with payments  of fuelwood  royalty to the government. \nThis is partly because the fuelwood royalty is cheaper than alternatives, and it is getting difficult to \ncollect adequate fuelwood in nearby forests. This suggests that there is a need to provide access \nto  reliable  and  clean  cooking  fuels  and  technology  so  as  to  improve  inefficient  energy \nconsumption,  avoid  deforestation,  and  meet  the  energy  demand  for  the  rural  population  in  an \naffordable manner. Biogas technology simply converts cattle dung to clean and renewable biogas, \nand  this  can  replace  polluting  fuelwood  and  more  expensive  kerosene  and  liquefied  petroleum \ngas. It is becoming popular in some developing countries (e.g., Bangladesh, Nepal, and Viet Nam) \non a commercial basis through private service providers. The market assessment indicates that \nthere are potentially 16,000 households that could become biogas users in Bhutan.15 \n \nRural  electrification  as  well  as  alternative  renewable  energy  development  will  not  only \n9. \naddress local energy demand and national energy security but will also act as social interventions \nfor  the  poor,  as  they  help  diversify  income-earning  activities  in  rural  areas.  Small  business \nestablishments sprout where electricity is available. Electric rice mills and flour mills will increase \nsupplementary  income,  and  the  by-product  of  the  biogas  plants  (odorless  bio-slurry)  is  an \nexcellent  organic  fertilizer  that  will  increase  productivity  for  rural  farmers.  It  is  evident  that \nelectrification  will  also  increase  socioeconomic  benefits  in  the  areas  of  education  and  health. \nComprehensive activities under the project are thus expected to improve the quality of life and the \nstandard of living in rural areas, where more than 90% of poor people live. The project will also \ncontribute  to  environmental  sustainability  by  reducing  deforestation  and  greenhouse  gas \nemissions.  \n \n10. \napproaches through various energy sources, focusing on sustainable rural energy operations.17 \n\nTo respond to sector issues,16 the project will be implemented as an integrated package of \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nturbines and slope restriction, and there is 78 MW of feasible potential based on proximity to the existing roads and \ntransmission accessibility.  \n\n12  The power export tariffs are higher than the domestic sales tariffs, and Bhutan is allowed to export power to India \nafter  meeting  its  domestic  demand.  This  suggests  that  unless  the  generation  capacity  is  added,  hydropower \nexports and its revenue be reduced over time to meet the growing domestic demand.       \n\n13  The survey indicates that most rural households use a large volume of fuelwood for cooking cattle feed.   \n14  The  direct  burning  of  straw  and  fuelwood  leads  to  large  emissions  of  carbon  dioxide  and  other  toxic  gases.  The \nrecent  evaluations  have  shown  that  rural  electrification  reduces  fuelwood  consumption  by  25%\u201335%.  Austrian \nDevelopment Cooperation. 2008.

As an outcome, the coverage and \nmix of clean energy supply will be expanded throughout the country in a sustainable manner. In \nparticular,  the  project  will  contribute  to  achieving  100%  rural  electrification  of  all  households \nidentified in the Rural Electrification Master Plan 2005, and diversifying energy supply sources \nto meet a growing demand, particularly in the winter dry seasons.  \n \nC. \n\n12.  \n\nOutputs \n \nThe project will have the following four components: \n(i) \n(ii) \n\non-grid rural electrification sourced from hydropower (5,075 new households), \noff-grid  rural  electrification  sourced  from  solar  power  (1,896  new  solar  home \nsystems  installed  and  2,500  existing  systems  rehabilitated  throughout  the \ncountry),  \npilot  wind  power  generation  plants  connected  to  the  grid  (two  180-kilowatt \nturbines and an additional three wind masts installed), and \npilot domestic biogas plants (1,600 new households through microfinance). \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \nTo  achieve  electricity  for  all  as  defined  under  the  Rural  Electrification  Master  Plan, \n13. \naround  8,500  households  are  expected  to  be  electrified  by  extension  of  distribution  lines  and \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  parallel  with  the  Austrian  Development  Agency  (ADA)  and  JICA. 18 \nHouseholds  in  isolated  remote  areas  will  also  have  access  to  electricity  through  solar  home \nsystems on  an off-grid basis. The project will also support rehabilitation of existing solar home \nsystems, particularly through battery replacement.19   \n \n14.  \nTo  deal  with  growing  demand  for  energy  along  with  expanding  rural  electrification, \nadditional  alternative  energy  sources  will  need  to  be  developed.  The  pilot  wind  power  and \nbiogas development is expected to help improve national energy security by diversifying energy \nresources  in  the  long  run. 20  The  pilot  wind  power  mills  will  demonstrate  the  feasibility  of \ngenerating  wind  power  that  will  help  alleviate  the  power  shortage  problems  in  dry  winter \nseasons,  and  enable  Bhutan  to  gain  practical  experience  in  planning,  constructing,  and \noperating wind farms before implementing them on a larger scale. The biogas development is \nexpected to replace fuelwood for cooking (as electricity replaces kerosene for lighting). Biogas \nand  electricity  can  thus  complement  each  other  in  rural  households  to  reduce  indoor  pollution \noriginating mainly from kerosene and fuelwood.  \n \nD. \n \n15. \nadministration manual.21 \n                                                 \n18 ADB will focus on six districts (Lhuentse, Mongar, Samdrup Jongkhar, Trashigang, Trashiyangtse, and Zhemgang) \nin the eastern and central regions. ADA is expected to support one district (Gasa) where special technology will be \nconsidered for high mountainous areas. JICA is expected to cover 11 other districts.  \n\nThe  project is  estimated  to  cost  $24.91  million  (Table  1).  The  details  are  in  the project \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n19 Gender  Action  Plan  (Appendix  2).  In  line  with  expansion  of  rural  electrification,  the  skills  training  for  village \ntechnicians for operation and maintenance, user education programs, and livelihood improvement activities will be \nprovided through a related gender mainstreaming initiative for the Improving Gender-Inclusive Access to Clean and \nRenewable Energy in Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, which is being processed separately (para. 26).  \n\n20 The pilot wind power mills will be installed at Tshimalakha in Chukha and the pilot biogas plants will be in Chukha, \n\nSamtse, Tsirang, and Sarpang.  \n\n21 Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n\n\fTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nBase Cost \n1.

The operation and maintenance of off-\ngrid  rural  electrification will  be  outsourced  to  the  BPC,  while  the  DOE  will  own  assets  of  solar \nhome  systems  and  conduct  procurement  and  installation  of  new  systems  and  spare  parts. \nVillage technicians will be contracted by the BPC to support the operation and maintenance of \nboth on-grid and off-grid rural electrification in remote areas. Any financial resources necessary \nfor off-grid service performed by the BPC will be reimbursed by the DOE.26 To promote the wind \npower component, the DOE will ensure the project's viability and safeguard compliance, and the \nBPC will implement and operate the proposed pilot project through procurement, construction, \nsafeguard  implementation,  and  operation  and  maintenance  by  owning  the  assets  of  the \nsubproject. The  DOE  will  coordinate  the  project  activities  for  the  biogas  component.  The  DOL \nwill be responsible for implementing the overall biogas project component while the BDFC will \nprovide  microcredit  services  as  a  financial  intermediary  for  recipient  farmer  groups.27 SNV  will \n\n                                                 \n26 Since  the  DOE  outsources  operation  and  maintenance  for  solar  home  systems  to  the  BPC,  BPC\u2019s  incremental \n\ncosts related to such off-grid services will be reimbursed and compensated for by the DOE.  \n27  The biogas component will use an imprest account and statement of expenditure procedures. \n\n\fprovide  capacity  building,  training,  quality  control,  management  support,  and  monitoring \nactivities.28  \n \n20. \nADB  will  coordinate  implementation  with  ADA  and  JICA  to  support  the  on-grid  rural \nelectrification  component.  To  implement  the  biogas  component,  ADB  will  also  coordinate  with \nSNV and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which plans to provide a small \nnumber of biogas plants and related livelihood programs.29  \n \nThe  government  and  the  executing  agency  requested  ADB  for  advance  contracting  and \n21.  \nretroactive  financing  for  procurement  of  works,  goods,  and  services.  To  ensure  sustainability  of \noff-grid rural electrification, the DOE will establish a bulk procurement and inventory management \nsystem for spare parts, and support village technicians for operation and maintenance of off-grid \nsolar  home  systems  through  the  BPC.  The  wind  power  and  biogas  components  will  be \nimplemented on a pilot basis where they are intended to establish the capacity to enable Bhutan \nto  run  a  large-scale  program  in  the  subsequent  phase.  To  ensure  implementation  of  those \nactivities, each of the off-grid solar and wind power components will include individual consultants \non a small scale, and SNV will be engaged in capacity building support for the biogas component. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n22. \nThe mountainous terrain, lack of road access, and low population density results in high \ncapital  costs  and  slow  network  expansion  of  rural  electrification  due  to  logistical  problems. \nTherefore,  the  cost  and  time-saving  design  will  be  crucial  for  the  \u201clast  mile\u201d  of  on-grid  rural \nelectrification.  Telescopic  poles  and  single-phase  transformers  will  be  applied  for  cost-effective \nand  easy  transport  in  remote  mountainous  areas. 30  Where  on-grid  rural  electrification  is  not \neconomically  feasible,  off-grid  solar  home  systems  will  be  installed  with  maintenance-free \nbatteries. Recent energy-efficient technology\u2014such as ultra-low-power, white light-emitting-diode \nlamps\u2014has  reduced  the  required  solar  home  system  capacity  and  capital  cost  while  increasing \nthe room for electricity consumption for lighting and other small electric appliances (e.g., a radio \nand  a  cell  phone  charger).  The  biogas  plants  are  technically  simple,  and  the  plant  model  used \nwidely in Nepal has been adopted based on the technical feasibility assessment done by SNV.31 It \nwill be deliberate to pilot-test new energy potential of wind power technology to learn wind firm's \nconstruction and operations before its scaling up.  \n \nB. \n \n23. \nThe overall project is economically viable based on an aggregate economic internal rate of \nreturn of 13.9%.32 The institutional financial positions of the BPC and BDFC are also viable.33 The \ngovernment  ensures  the  BPC\u2019s  financial  sustainability,  which  can  be  affected  by  rural \n                                                 \n28  SNV  was  selected  as  a  consultant  through  single-source  selection  because  of  (i)  its  unique  expertise  and \nqualification for creating the biogas market (footnote 22), and (ii) continuation of previous work carried out (footnote \n15). SNV will finance part of the consulting services cost for implementation support and capacity development.  \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n29  Development Coordination (Appendix 2). \n30  ADB. 2006.

The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  each  component  is  also  analyzed  and \n\nassessed economically viable.  \n33  Financial Analysis (Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nelectrification  through  a  tariff  mechanism  subsidized  by  energy  royalty.34 The  BPC  has  already \nstarted  a  decentralized  operation  system  and  outsourcing  arrangement  to  reduce  the  financial \nburdens  of  operation  and  maintenance  costs  in  remote  rural  areas.  To  ensure  operational \nsustainability of off-grid systems, the DOE has agreed with the BPC to outsource operation and \nmaintenance  for  solar  home  systems  to  village  technicians  contracted  by  the  BPC,  and  the \ngovernment  will  meet  the  BPC\u2019s  costs  of  providing  these  outsourcing  services.  The  pilot  wind \nmills connected to grid systems are assessed financially feasible through free capital provision to \nthe BPC, where the revenue will fully meet the operation and maintenance costs in cash terms. \nThe  pilot  biogas  component  is  financially  and  economically  viable,  assuming  a  certain  level  of \nsubsidy support  during the initial stage of development.  While the subsidy is required to reduce \nthe  entry  barriers  to  the  biogas  market  for  rural  farmers,  the  plant  cost  will  be  contributed  to  by \nupfront equity from biogas users, and the balance will be credited through the BDFC to enhance \nmarket-driven  development.  The  subsidy  and  credit  are  from  the  Biogas  Fund,  which  will  be \nestablished  from  the  ADF  grant  and  administered  by  the  BDFC. 35 To  ensure  its  operational \nfeasibility,  part  of  the  financing  will  be  used  to  create  a  capacity  and  commercial  environment \nwhere (i) farmers will be better educated and more aware of biogas plants, (ii) farmers will have \naccess to credit that underpins any successful introduction of certified technologies, and (iii) the \nDOL,  DOE,  and  private  masons  for  the  plant  construction  will  be  fully  enabled  for  operations \nthrough  intensive  and  long-term  training  and  capacity  building  with  support  from  SNV. 36 The \nbiogas program has initiated an application process for the clean development mechanism.  \n \nC. \n \n24. \nIn August 2010, the government approved a new regulatory framework on tariff pricing \nthat  clarifies  segregation  between  the  regulator\u2019s  assessment  on  cost-based  tariffs  and  the \ngovernment\u2019s decision on tariff subsidies sourced from the royalty energy supply. This enables \nconsumers  to  know  the  cost-based  tariffs  and  subsidy  requirements;  it  will  make  the  cost \nrecovery  accountable  and  the  tariff  pricing  and  subsidy  systems  transparent. 37  The  royalty \nenergy will be sold at a discounted price to the BPC from the government and its revenue will be \nallocated  to  the  government\u2019s  resources  to  sustain  operation  and  maintenance  of  overall  rural \nelectrification  and  pilot  renewable  energy  subprojects  as  stipulated  in  the  provision  of  the \nEconomic  Development  Policy  2010. 38  The  policy  also  defines  holistic  adaptation  of  the \nRenewable Energy Policy, which is in the process of being approved by the government.39 \n \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                 \n34  Fifteen  percent  of  the  power  generation  from  the  Druk  Green  Power  Corporation\u2019s  medium-sized  and  large \nhydropower plants is capped and provided as free royalty energy to the government. The benefits from the royalty \nenergy sold at discounted price to BPC from the government are used to provide electricity tariff subsidies, mainly \nto residential consumers.   \n\n35  As  the  credit  risks  will  be  borne  by  the  BDFC,  the  revolving  credit  principal  will  be  sustainable.  To  maintain  the \nsubborrower's interest rate at a minimum of 10% and ensure affordability, the government will not relend the grant \nto the BDFC, but establish its fund comprising the revolving credit and subsidy accounts at the BDFC. Out of the \ntotal  unit  price  (Nu26,000)  of  the  typical  size  of  biogas  plant  (4  cubic  meters),  45%  of  the  unit  cost  will  be \nsubsidized and the balance will be supported equally by recipient\u2019s equity and BDFC credit. \n36  Sustainable Business Modeling for Alternative Renewable Energy Development (Appendix 2). \n37  Since the previous regulator only announced final tariffs after deducting subsidies, the consumers had no specific \n\ninformation on the cost-based tariffs and subsidies.    \n\n38  The  royalty  energy  supply  sold  at  the  discounted  price  is  primarily  used  by  BPC  for  cross-subsidies  of  electricity \ntariffs within the power sector. The government\u2019s cash revenue from the sales of the royalty energy will further be \nused to support renewable energy initiatives and conserve the catchment area of hydropower projects. \n\n39  The Economic Development Policy 2010 has already required that the Renewable Energy Policy be issued within \n\nthe 10th Five Year Plan. \n\n \n\n\fPoverty and Social \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n25. \nwith the government, DOE, and the implementing agencies. 40 The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual.  \n \nD. \n \n26. \nThe  project  is  expected  to  promote  equitable  rural  development  and  improve  rural \nconnectivity.  Access  to  electricity  will  provide  the  poor  with  equal  opportunity  to  enjoy  an \nimproved  quality  of  life,  facilitating  their  participation  in  social  and  economic  activities  that  can \ncontribute  to  poverty  alleviation.41 Modern  clean  energy  will  enable  women  to  equally  benefit \nthrough reduced time spent collecting fuelwood, pollution-free lighting and fuel, and use of rice \ncookers  and  other  electrical  appliances  that  will  reduce  indoor  smoke.  The  provision  of  clean \nenergy will not only make their chores easier but will also improve their health. Respiratory and \neye ailments are more common in women, children, and the elderly since these groups remain \nindoors  more  than  men.  The  project  will  be  implemented  in  close  coordination  with  ADB\u2019s \ngender mainstreaming initiative.42 The initiative is expected to support training programs for the \nvillage  technicians  involved  in  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  rural  electrification  so  as  to \nexpand female employment opportunities in rural areas. It will also provide livelihood programs \nand  training  opportunities  for  revenue-earning  activities  in  partnership  with  nongovernment \norganizations.43 The  biogas  market  is  expected  to  create  new  private  sector  opportunities  in \nrural communities for masons and service providers. \n \nE. \n \nThe  project  is  classified  under  safeguard  category  B  for  environment  and  involuntary \n27. \nresettlement  and  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  The  initial  environmental  examination  and  the \nresettlement  plan  were  prepared  following  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  the \ngovernment's related guidelines, policies, and legislation.44 The environmental clearances were \ngranted by the National Environment Commission for each of the four project components. The \nenvironment  management  plans  mainly  include  (i)  a  collection  system  for  used  lead-acid \nbatteries  of  solar  home  systems,  and  (ii)  barriers  against  potential  wind  turbine  noise.45 While \nthe project does not involve physical displacement, five households will be affected by the loss \nof  a  portion  of  their  land  (equivalent  to  less  than  10%  of  their  total  landholding)  due  to  the \nexpansion of an access road to the wind power site. The government will provide the affected \nhouseholds  with  substitute  land  in  accordance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The \nresettlement plan includes an entitlement matrix that ensures appropriate and fair compensation \nfor  the  loss  of  private  land  and  crops.  Project  stakeholders  and  affected  people  have  been \nconsulted  throughout  the  project  design  and  planning  phases. 46 A  grievance  mechanism  to \naddress  stakeholder  concerns  is  included  in  the  resettlement  plan.

The  cost  and  time  overrun  risks  are  to  be  mitigated  by  (i)  adequate  physical  and \nprice  contingencies,  and  cost  estimates  on  recent  actual  bid  prices  for  rural  electrification \ncomponents;  and  (ii) advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing.  To  mitigate  risks  related  to \ntechnical and operational feasibility, proven energy and labor-efficient technology will be adapted \nand capacity building and implementation support will be built into the development of alternative \nrenewable  energy  components  through  consultancy  services  and  aid  coordination.  To  ensure \noperational and financial sustainability, (i) memoranda of understanding were agreed between the \nDOE  and  each  of  the  implementing  agencies,  and  (ii)  the  government  assured  any  additional \nresources through its budgetary allocation based on adequate energy royalty provision. Based on \nthese mitigation measures, the overall project risks are considered low.47       \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe government, the BPC, and BDFC have agreed with ADB certain covenants for the \n\n \n29. \nThe  government,  the  BPC,  and  BDFC  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the \nproject shall conform with all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and grant documents. \n \n30. \nproject, which are set forth in the grant and project agreements.  \n \n31. \nEffectiveness of the grant will be subject to (i) a signed subsidiary financing agreement \nbetween the government and the BPC, satisfactory to ADB;

Survey  on  Preparing  a  Project  Design  Document  of  Clean  Development  Mechanism  for  Rural \nElectrification of Bhutan. Tokyo. The greenhouse gas emission reduction was studied in preparing a project design \ndocument,  after  aggregating  estimates  from  ongoing  and  proposed  rural  electrification  projects  of  both  JICA  and \nADB. Benefits from other renewable energy components under the project were also added.  \n\nUsers\u2019 contribution: \n$0.30 million \n\nGovernment/BPC: \n$2.75 million \n\nSNV: $0.27 million \n\nb   The gender-inclusive design is related to the project\u2019s major output of rural electrification on an on-grid and off-grid \nbasis, which will cover more than 80% of the project cost. This gender-related output is expected to be supported \nand  monitored  by  the  gender  mainstreaming  initiative  of  the  Improving  Gender-Inclusive  Access  to  Clean  and \nRenewable Energy in Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, which is being considered separately for approval.   \n\nSources: Asian Development Bank and government agencies. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/RRPs/?id=42252-02-2 \n\n \n\nGrant Agreement \n\nProject Agreement  \n\nSector Assessment (Summary): Energy  \n\nProject Administration Manual  \n\nContribution to the ADB Results Framework  \n\nDevelopment Coordination \n\nFinancial Analysis  \n\nEconomic Analysis  \n\nCountry Economic Indicators  \n\nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy  \n\nGender Action Plan \n\nInitial Environmental Examination  \n\nResettlement Plan  \n\nRisk Assessment and Risk Management Plan  \n\n \n\nSupplementary Documents \n\nSustainable Business Modeling for Alternative Renewable Energy Development  \n\nAssumptions for Economic Analysis \n\nBiogas Project Structure and Procedure \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\n10. \n\n11. \n\n12. \n\n13. \n\n14. \n\n15. \n\n16. \n\n17. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 September 2010) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "ngultrum (Nu) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "Nu1.00\n$1.00\n", "$0.0215 \nNu46.45 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nADA \nADF \nBPC \nBDFC \nDOE \nDOL \nJICA \nMW \nTA \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAustrian Development Agency \nAsian Development Fund \nBhutan Power Corporation \nBhutan Development Finance Corporation \nDepartment of Energy \nDepartment of Livestock \nJapan International Cooperation Agency \nmegawatt (1,000 kilowatts) \ntechnical assistance \n", " \n", "NOTE \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n \nPeer reviewers \n \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \nX.
