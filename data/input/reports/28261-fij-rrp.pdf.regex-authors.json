The Project is well advanced, with only the ongoing \nAssessment  upgrading of subproject roads still to be completed. There are \nenvironmental management plans for the remaining subproject \nand  these  are  being  implemented  by  the  contractors  and \nmonitored by the supervising consultants and the ministries of \ntourism and the environment.  \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  contributes  to  the  Government\u2019s  objectives  of \neconomic and social development by reducing transport sector \nconstraints  on  economic  development  and  improving  the \neconomic  returns  on  transport  infrastructure.  It  supports  the \nGovernment\u2019s program to improve the national road network and \nthe management of roads. The supplementary loan will finance  \n50 kilometers (km) of road upgrading, which was partly completed \nunder the original loan. \n   \nRationale  Land transport is the dominant form of transport in the Fiji Islands. \nWhile the road network is largely complete, a large proportion still \nconsists of low-standard gravel roads, where the vehicle operating \ncosts are high. These roads impede socioeconomic development, \nlengthen travel time, and cause damage to transported goods. \nThey are inadequate for current traffic loads. Traffic volume is \nincreasing  and  heavy  vehicles  are  damaging  the  roads.  \nUpgrading  the  roads  will  expand  the  income-generating \nopportunities, particularly for small-scale dairy, fruit, and vegetable \nfarmers, and reduce transport costs. The population will benefit \nfrom  faster  and  less  costly  transportation  to  health  and \neducational services. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project will lead to economic and social development, and to \nreduced hardship and poverty. It will improve access to services \nand markets, thereby providing better opportunities for economic \nand social development. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The revised cost of the Project is estimated at US$162.1 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of US$33.9 million. The project cost \noverrun is estimated to be US$72.1 million, including taxes and \nduties of US$16.2 million. \n   ", "ii   \nSupplementary  A loan of US$36.1 million from the ordinary capital resources of \nFinancing Plan  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  provided  to  the \nBorrower under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending facility.  The  loan  will  have a  term  of 20  years \nincluding a grace period of 2 years, an interest rate determined \naccording to ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment \ncharge of 0.15% yearly, and other terms and conditions set forth \nin  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The  Government  will  provide \nUS$36.0 million, or 50% of the cost overrun. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  15 March 2009 to 30 June 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2011 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Department of National Roads (DNR) in the Ministry of Works and \nTransport  \n   \nImplementation  The permanent secretary of the Ministry of Works and Transport \nArrangements  will  be  responsible for  the  implementation  of  the Project.  The \nexisting project management unit will continue to administer daily \nactivities  under  the  director  of  roads.  Local  and  international \ncontractors  and  the  DNR  will  carry  out  the  civil  works,  and \nconsultants will be hired for preconstruction activities, including \nthe  preparation  of  tender  documents,  and  for  construction \nsupervision and quality control. \n   \nProcurement  Roads will be upgraded under contracts to be awarded through \ninternational  competitive  bidding  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nAn ongoing contract package for the supply of pavement materials \nwas  approved  by  ADB  in  2006.  The  balance  of  the  cost  not \nfinanced by the original loan will be eligible for financing under the \nsupplementary loan.  \n   \nConsulting Services  International  and  national  consultants  will  supervise  the \nconstruction  of  the  remaining  road  upgrading  subproject.  The \nBorrower  will  select  and  hire  competent  and  experienced \nconsultants acceptable to ADB to carry out the assignment. The \nterms of reference of the consultants will be determined by ADB \nand  the  DNR.  Any  substantial  changes  proposed  in  the \nsupervision arrangements will have to be approved by ADB. DNR \nwill  see  to  it  that  competent  and  experienced  consultants \nacceptable to ADB are hired to supervise the civil works. \n   ", "  iii \nProject Benefits and  Subprojects  under  the  original  and  supplementary  loans  must \nBeneficiaries  have a minimum economic internal rate of return of 12% to be \neligible for ADB financing. The direct benefits of the Project will \naccrue from reduced vehicle operating costs and time savings. \nIndirect benefits will include improved access of rural communities \nto  basic  social  facilities,  as  well  as  improved  socioeconomic \nconditions in the areas served by the upgraded roads. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The completion of the remaining subproject is subject to technical \nrisks that are largely within the control of the Executing Agency. \nThese risks can be satisfactorily mitigated through sound project \nmanagement and supervision. \n ", "178o  00'E 180 o 00'\n177 o 00'E REPUBLIC OF THE FIJI ISLANDS\nTHIRD ROAD UPGRADING\nNORTHERN     DIVISION\n12 o 40'S 12 o 40'S Labasa (SECTOR) PROJECT\nRotuma\n177 o 00'E\nV A N U A     L E V U Taveuni Coast Road\nN\nSavusavu\nWaiyevo\n17 o 00'S P Buca Bay Road TAVEUNI 0 10 20 40 60 80 17 o 00'S\nO U  Nabouwalu Kilometers\nR \nG \nA     \nW  WESTERN     DIVISION\nS A  Vanua Balavu\nY A  Rakiraki Koro\nK  o  r  o         S  e  a\nBa Kings Road\nTavua\nWEnaailmoaalnoua  RRooaadd LautokaNadi V I T I     L E V U Natovi SLaowOdaoLnVnei AiR vRLouoAakadaUd L OG M R  AO I  UV  PI T I Nairai E  A  S  T  E  R  N         D  I  V  I  S  I  O L  AN U     O R     E A S T E R N     G R O U P\nNausori Gau\nSigatoka\nSUVA 180 o 00'\nNavua\nCENTRAL     DIVISION 150 o 00'E 170 o 00'W\nBeqa P2h0io Sl i0ep0ap'Nine N o r t h     P a c i f i c  M  A ORS cH AeL aL   nISLANDS International  D PACIFIC  REGION 20o  00'N\nNational Capital P  A  C  I  F  I  C          O  C  E  A  N ROEFP PUABLLAIUC FEDERATED STATES OF ateline\nMICRONESIA\nTown\n0o 0o\nProject Road NAURU\n19 o 00'S Road Vunisea 19 o 00'S INDONESIA PAPUA K     I     R     I     B     A     T     I\nNEW GUINEA\nSOLOMON\nRiver ISLANDS TUVALU\nKADAVU\nDivision Boundary SAMOA\nInternational Boundary C o r a l   S e a VANUATU ROEPFU TBHLEIC ISCLOAONKDS\n0 Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative. 20o  00'S ISLFAINJIDS TONGA 20o  00'S\n8\n-4\n3 A U S T R A L I A\n34 H 178o  00'E 150 o 00'E S o u t h     P a c i f i c  1 7  0O o 0 c0 'We a n\nR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsupplementary loan to the Republic of the Fiji Islands for the Third Road Upgrading (Sector) \nProject (FRUP III).1 \n \n \nII.  THE APPROVED PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Rationale \n \n2.  Transport services for both passengers and freight on the main islands of Vanua Levu \nand Viti Levu rely heavily on roads. Although the road network is largely complete, however, \nmuch of it is built to a low standard. Travel by road takes longer, transported goods are prone to \ndamage, and socioeconomic development suffers. Heavy vehicles on roads not designed for \nthe growing traffic volume and axle loads also do serious harm. On the other hand, because of \ninadequate capacity on some national trunk roads, particularly circular roads and wharf access \nroads, uneconomic routes are often chosen. Rising transport costs, which hinder economic \ngrowth, make the upgrading of roads necessary. The subprojects under FRUP Ill were selected \non  the  basis  of  passenger  traffic  volume,  the  transport  requirements  of  international  and \ndomestic trade, and demand created by tourism. \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) operational strategy supports the Government \nin  its  policy  of  improving  transport  infrastructure  in  the  wider  economic  policy  context  of \npromoting  private  sector  development,  reducing  regional  inequalities,  and  delivering  better \nsocial services. Road upgrading is a key component of the National Transport Sector Plan, \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s policy of supporting high-yielding projects. ADB\u2019s aim in the Pacific region \ncontinues to be the creation of an environment of improved productivity, increased private \nsector investment, and sustained economic growth. In line with ADB\u2019s strategy for the Pacific,2 \nFRUP III (the Project) addressed the improvement of physical infrastructure, a key factor in \neconomic growth. Through associated technical assistance (TA),3 ADB supported significant \npolicy reform and capacity building in the sector. The background, policy issues, sector analysis, \nand  institutional  framework  are  fully  described  in  the  report  and  recommendation  of  the \nPresident for the original loan. \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope of the Original Project \n \n  1.  Objectives \n4.  The original Project was aimed at helping the Government to (i) improve the efficiency of \nroad sector services and increase private sector participation, and (ii) improve the management \nof road assets and sector resources. The intent was to reduce transport sector constraints on \neconomic development, and thus improve the economic returns on transport infrastructure. \n                                                \n1  ADB. 1997.

", "2   \nSupport  for  asset  management  was  to  help  integrate  transport  sector  planning  and \nmacroeconomic planning. \n \n1.  Scope \n \n5.  The  principal  components  of  the  Project  (the  scope  will  not  change  under  the \nsupplementary financing) were as follows: \n \n(i)  Civil  works  for  the  upgrading  of  about  100  kilometers  (km)  of  gravel  roads \nselected from among the 19 roads identified under FRUP Ill; \n(ii)  Civil works for the rehabilitation of roads and the strengthening of about 80 km of \nsealed pavements; \n(iii)  Civil works for road safety improvements in road infrastructure under the Fiji \nRoad Safety Action Plan; \n(iv)  The procurement of specialized road maintenance and laboratory equipment; \nand \n(v)  Consulting services, as follows: \n(a)  Detailed  engineering  work  and  construction  supervision  for  road \nupgrading subprojects; \n(b)  Support for the project management unit (PMU), provided by a project \nmanagement engineer, a local liaison officer, and an accountant; \n(c)  Strengthening of the technical services of the Public Works Department; \nand \n(d)  Asset  management  and  engineering  support  for  road  rehabilitation \nsubprojects. \n \n6.  In addition to these project components, associated TA (footnote 3) was provided to \nbuild road sector capacity by (i) reorganizing the Public Works Department of the Ministry of \nWorks and Transport in the context of the new Public Enterprise Act; (ii) establishing the Land \nTransport Authority under the land Transport Bill, merging the Central Traffic Authority, the \nTransport  Control  Board,  and  the  Principal  Licensing  Authority  into  a  single,  self-funding, \nintegrated,  and  commercial  Land  Transport  Authority;  and  (iii)  building  the  capacity  of \nstakeholders to implement the Fiji Road Safety Action Plan. \n \nC.  Original Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n7.  The total cost of the Project, including interest and charges on the ADB loan during \nconstruction,  was  estimated  at  US$90  million  equivalent\u2014US$39.7  million  (about  44%)  in \nforeign exchange and US$50.3 million equivalent (about 56%) in local currency. The detailed \noriginal and revised cost estimate is shown in Table 1. \n \n8.  The ADB loan of US$40.0 million, about 44% of the project cost, comprised (i) US$34.3 \nmillion in civil works for the road upgrading subprojects (60% of category costs); (ii) US$3.5 \nmillion in road rehabilitation (35% of category costs); (iii) US$1.2 million equivalent in civil works \nfor  safety  improvements  (34%  of  category  costs);  and  (iv)  US$1.0  million  equivalent  in \nspecialized maintenance and laboratory equipment (100% of category costs). The rest of the \nproject costs, including interest during construction, were to be met from the Government\u2019s own \nresources. \n \n ", "  3 \n9.  The US dollar loan came from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. It had an amortization \nperiod  of  25  years  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  and  carried  interest  determined \naccording to ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar loans and a yearly \ncommitment charge of 0.75%. In 2002, the undisbursed balance of the loan was transferred to \nthe London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based loan facility. The original and revised financing \nplan is in Table 2. \n \nD.  Status and Progress of Project Implementation \n \n10.  The status of project implementation is as follows: \n \n(i)  50 km of roads have been upgraded, out of the expected 100 km. A subproject \n(the upgrading of the Kings and Lodoni roads, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe \nsubproject\u201d) for the balance of 50 km is ongoing and is about 50% complete. \n(ii)  120 km of road rehabilitation has been completed, 40 km more than the expected \noutput of 80 km. This work was completed by December 2005, within the activity \ncategory budget. \n(iii)  All civil works for road safety improvements in road infrastructure were completed \nby December 2005. \n(iv)  All specialized road maintenance and laboratory equipment was procured by \nDecember 2005. \n(v)  All consulting services, except for those needed for the construction supervision \nof the ongoing subproject, were delivered by December 2005. \n \n11.  The associated TA (footnote 3) was completed in June 2005. Its intended objectives \nwere generally achieved and the TA was rated partly successful.4 The TA assisted the Ministry \nof Works and Transport in developing and implementing institutional and policy reform by \nestablishing the Land Transport Authority and the Department of National Roads (the latter \nbeing  the  first  stage  of  a  two-step  process  to  establish  a  Fiji  Roads  Authority).  But  the \nimplementation time frame was considerably extended and the institutional reform was only \npartly accomplished. The reform efforts were to continue under a proposed loan for the Fourth \nRoad Upgrading (Sector) Project (FRUP IV) and associated TA for Road Sector Performance \nImprovement. Together these were to support the transition of the roads authority from a public \nsector road agency to a statutory authority, with maximum involvement from the private sector \nand performance-based management. Unfortunately, ADB\u2019s reengagement approach5 halted \nthe processing of the FRUP IV and much of the momentum for the reform of the road transport \nsector was lost. The process should be revived once reengagement allows FRUP IV to proceed. \n \n12.  Efforts at systematic and responsive road asset management under the Project were \ngenerally  successful,  but  still  require  the  following  elements  for  long-term  sustainability: \n(i) government  commitment  to  fully  fund  road  maintenance,  which  depends  in  part  on  a \ndedicated stream of road funding; (ii) a continuing human resources program to recruit and train \nstaff  and  replace  incumbents  who  are  promoted  or  move  to  other  jobs;  (iii)  government \nbudgetary support, including the use of external suppliers, to maintain software and hardware \nsystems so these do not become outdated or obsolete; (iv) rebranding and reissue of manuals \nand guidelines prepared for the Public Works Department; (v) a formalized and appropriately \nfunded bridge replacement program; (vi) a dedicated budget item for emergency maintenance; \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance Completion Report on Road Sector Reform and Safety Improvement in the Fiji \nIslands. Manila. \n5  ADB. 2007. Fiji Islands: Reengagement Approach. Manila. \n ", "4   \n(vii) quality control systems for force account and contracted maintenance works; (viii) more \ntimely, complete, and accurate entry of data on road inventory and condition in the divisions; \n(ix) integrated road asset management and financial information systems; and (x) support for \nthe outsourcing of maintenance activities through the training of Department of National Roads \n(DNR) staff in contract supervision, and of domestic contractors in labor, plant, and materials \nmanagement, estimation, and business management. While the Project improved capacity for \nroad asset management, the Executing Agency (EA) was unable to retain or replace staff, partly \nbecause momentum toward the long-term sustainability of institutional arrangements for sector \nmanagement was lost. The EA is now looking into twinning arrangements to firm up its position \nand help it to move forward in a way that accords with plans to establish a roads authority. The \nProject also provided only limited opportunities for domestic contractors in small-scale civil \nworks  including  road  rehabilitation  and  road  safety  improvements.  One  reason  was  the \npreponderance of work under force account, beyond the level foreseen at appraisal. Private \nsector capacity has thus diminished as the few opportunities have discouraged investment in \nnew equipment. Government has therefore had to rely even more on works by force account, \ncontrary to the aims of the Project. In subsequent projects, contracts suitable in scale for the \nlocal contracting industry should be included in the implementation plan. \n \n13.  The status of progress of the subproject is as follows: \n \n(i)  Earthworks and drainage have been completed for 30 km out of the total of \n50 km. \n(ii)  Pavement works have been completed to the subbase level for 22 km out of the \ntotal of 50 km. \n(iii)  Pavement works for base course and bituminous sealing have been completed \nfor 2 km out of the total of 50 km. \n(iv)  All bridgeworks, comprising 16 two-lane concrete bridges, have been completed. \n \n14.  Two civil works contracts are ongoing. The contract to complete the pavement to the \nsubbase level over 29 km is expected to be completed by February 2009. The other contract, to \nproduce pavement materials to supply the material needs of the subproject, will continue until \nthose needs are fully met. \n \n15.  Eleven km of road, including earthworks, drainage, and pavement, is being built under \nthe  Government\u2019s  force  account  arrangements,  involving  local  plant-hire  contractors,  local \nmaterials suppliers, and a government project management team. This work is about 15% \ncomplete. \n \n16.  The Government has received bids for two other contracts\u2014(i) the construction of base \ncourse and seal over 29 km of the subproject; and (ii) the construction of 10 km of road, \nincluding earthworks, drainage, and pavement. The bids conformed to ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) including prior review of bidding documents by \nADB.  \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Cost Overrun \n \n17.  The cost of completing the Project is now estimated to be US$162.1 million, US$72.1 \nmillion more than originally expected. The cost overrun is almost entirely due to the increased \n ", "  5 \ncost of completing the subproject (the civil works for the upgrading of the Kings and Lodoni \nroads).  \n \n18.  In January 2001, the subproject was awarded as a single contract through international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB).6 When the bids were opened, the US dollar was relatively strong7 and \nit was thought that the cost of the subproject, although large by Fiji standards, could comfortably \nbe accommodated within the budget for the Project. At the same time, with anticipated savings \nfrom the strong US dollar, the EA increased the length of road rehabilitation under the Project \nfrom a planned 80 km to 120 km. The increase was achieved without exceeding the budget for \nthe road rehabilitation category of the original loan. \n \n19.  By the end of 2005, the Project had been completed except for the subproject, which \nwas only 35% complete. The unit rates under the contract had gone up by about 28%, in \naccordance with a rise and fall provision, and the exchange rate had weakened. The estimated \nfinal cost had jumped from F$57.3 million (US$28.1 million at bid opening) to F$74 million \n(about US$41.5 million). Even with the substantial increase, the cost overrun for the Project \nwould have been only about US$6 million, within the absorptive capacity of the Borrower. \n \n20.  However,  the  contractor  stopped  working  in  August  2005  when  the  EA  deducted \nliquidated damages from interim payments because of the delay. After issuing contractually \nrequired notices in an effort to persuade the contractor to resume working, the supervising \nengineer certified to the EA that the contract had been breached by the contractor and could be \nterminated by the EA. The Government formed a cabinet subcommittee in October 2005 to \nreview the circumstances surrounding the contractor\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Project and \nto consider alternative arrangements for completing the work. The committee decided that the \ncontractor had no reasonable excuse for abandoning the work, and agreed with the supervising \nengineer that claims for additional time and payment were groundless. The EA terminated the \ncontract in March 2006. While the committee\u2019s deliberations took some time, the EA proceeded \nin  parallel  to  prepare  a  revised  procurement  plan  and  associated  bidding  documents  for \ncompleting the works, thereby minimizing further delays. \n \n21.  ADB approved the revised procurement plan for completing the works, comprising five \nICB packages and one force account package. Bids were invited for the first three of the five \nICB contracts in 2006 but the accepted tender prices were significantly above the rates and \nprices in the original contract. The original contract price was based on prevailing fuel and \nmaterials prices and the relatively lower labor and management costs available to the contractor \nfrom the People\u2019s Republic of China. All construction inputs have since undergone further \nsignificant cost increases, particularly in fuel, oil, and materials costs (by a factor of at least two) \nover the last 2 years, such that the contract rates for the final two contracts are now three to four \ntimes higher than those in the original contract. With the delays caused by the poor performance \nof the contractor, the termination process, and the procurement of the new contract packages, \nthe Project is not expected to be completed before October 2011. \n \n22.  The base cost of completing the subproject is therefore estimated to have risen from \nUS$28.1  million  to about  US$87.0  million  (excluding project  management and  supervision \ncosts), or by US$58.9 million. The original financing plan provided for a civil works component \n                                                \n6  Kings and Lodoni roads, Contract No. QS 1/99 for F$57.3 million (about $28.1 million at bid opening), awarded to \nChina National Overseas Engineering Corporation on 24 January 2001. The estimated final cost is F$150.0 million \n(about $89.3 million). \n7  F$1.00 = US$0.72 at appraisal; F$1.00 = US$0.49 at bid opening. \n ", "6   \nunder FRUP III of US$76.9 million. Largely because of the increased costs of the Kings and \nLodoni roads component, the total cost of completing the civil works component of the Project is \nnow estimated to be US$135.3 million, including taxes and duties but excluding contingencies \nand additional financing costs during construction. \n \n23.  The Government has given notice to the original contractor that it intends to pursue a \nclaim against it, in accordance with the contract, to recover the additional costs of completing \nthe work, over and above the cost that would have been incurred had the work been completed \nat the rates and prices stated in the original contract. Such a claim cannot be pursued, however, \nuntil the actual cost of completing the work is known, and has been certified by the engineer for \nthe contract. The work is not expected to be completed before October 2011, and the claim will \nalmost certainly be resisted and require arbitration. This is likely to take a further 2 years, with \nuncertain outcome, given the nature of the proceedings and the likelihood of counterclaims \nagainst the Government by the contractor. While the Government may ultimately succeed in \nrecovering the cost overrun (in whole or in part), the supplementary finance is needed now to \nensure  the  completion  of  the  subproject  within  a  reasonable  time  and  to  prevent  the \ndeterioration of partially completed work. Given the substantial backlog of road rehabilitation \nwork, the Government has agreed that if it is able to recover the cost overrun, in whole or in \npart, from the original contractor, the sums will be applied to the extent necessary,  to priority \nroad rehabilitation as defined by the road asset management system, and to ensure adequate \nfunding of road maintenance. \n \nB.  Impact on the Project \n \n24.  Only 2 km of a total of 50 km of the subproject has been sealed so far; the rest is in \nvarying  stages  of  completion.  In  all  other  areas,  the  pavement  has  either  been  partially \ncompleted to the subbase (lower pavement) level or not been started. Partially completed \npavement cannot carry heavy axle loads and will suffer from accelerated deterioration, resulting \nin loss of the investment made so far. Upgrading a road to sealed standard has the principal \nbenefit of reducing vehicle operating costs by reducing roughness, improving geometry, and \nshortening route length. The partially completed work captured some route-length reductions \nand improvements in geometry, but the gravel pavement is still rough and vehicle operating \ncosts remain high. All bridges\u201416 in all\u2014were completed by August 2008. Thirteen are in use, \nbut three cannot be used until the road realignments have been completed. \n \n25.  The  civil  works  under  the  subproject  will  have  an  impact  on  economic  and  social \ndevelopment, and on hardship and poverty reduction in the areas served by the roads. As the \nSubproject is a significant part of the overall road upgrading component, failure to complete it \nwill significantly affect the overall impact of the Project. \n \nC.  Rationale for the Completion of the Kings and Lodoni Roads Subproject \n \n26.  The  development  policy  objectives  set  out  in  the  Government\u2019s  draft  Strategic \nDevelopment  Plan  2007\u20132011  center  on  the  development  of  efficient  and  cost-effective \ninfrastructure for economic and social development and private sector investment, accompanied \nby  institutional  strengthening  for  more  capable  and  better-quality  facilities  and  services. \nStrategies for achieving these objectives include improving access to safe, efficient, affordable, \nand environmentally sustainable transport services; and reducing the cost of transporting people \nand goods. The three primary goals of the plan are sustained growth, rural and outer island \ndevelopment, and efficient transport services. The Government\u2019s overall aim for the transport \nsubsector, given in the Review and Update of the Transport Sector Plan (2004), supports the \n ", "  7 \nnational development objectives by targeting the development of an integrated transport system \nthat is safe, efficient, affordable, accessible, and economically and environmentally sustainable. \n \n27.  The results-based framework of the country strategy and program update 2006\u201320088 \napproved in March 2006 supports the Government\u2019s objectives of (i) generating private sector\u2013\nled growth through sound macroeconomic policies, infrastructure, and alternative livelihoods; \n(ii) delivering affordable basic social services through support for water and sanitation services, \nand improvements in local governance; and (iii) establishing effective development institutions \nthrough a sequenced and interlinked TA package. The preparation of a new country partnership \nstrategy 2007\u20132011 to support the country\u2019s Strategic Development Plan began in 2006 but was \nsuspended on 5 December of that year, after a peaceful takeover of the democratically elected \ngovernment by the Fiji military forces. \n \n28.  The Kings and Lodoni roads serve the rural and impoverished areas of the east and \nnortheast of the main island, Viti Levu. Kings Road (29 km from Korovou to Nayavu), the final \nsection of the circum-insular highway to be upgraded to sealed standard, will benefit rural \ncommunities by establishing regular access to markets and services in the Suva area. The \nmajority of the rural population is engaged in subsistence farming; some sell surplus garden \nproduce at roadside stalls to augment their income. Previous road-upgrading programs in the \nFiji Islands have shown that upgrading Kings Road will expand income-generating opportunities, \nparticularly for small-scale fruit and vegetable farmers in the surrounding Wainibuka valley, and \nreduce transport costs for dairy farmers along the southern part of the route. Improved access \nto Suva from the northeast of Viti Levu will also make the costs of transportation to health and \neducational  services  more  affordable  to  the  population  of  this  underdeveloped  and \ndisadvantaged area. \n \n29.  Lodoni  Road  (21  km)  serves  the  east  coast  to  the  north  of  Korovou.  The  rural \ncommunities here will likewise benefit from easier access to the greater Suva area, as will \nstudents from two large state boarding schools served by the road. The link between the \ninternational port of Suva and the roll-on, roll-off jetty at Natovi will improve, and land transport \ncosts will be reduced. The Natovi jetty serves both the second-largest island of Viti Levu and the \nisland of Ovalau. The reduction in land transport costs and the shorter sea route to Vanua Levu \n(5 hours, as opposed to 10 hours from Suva) will allow goods and services to be priced lower. \n \n30.  The Project is eligible for supplementary financing under ADB\u2019s policy criteria for the \nfollowing reasons: \n \n(i)  The  Project  supports  the  development  policy  objectives  set  out  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s draft Strategic Development Plan 2007\u20132011; \n(ii)  Supplementary financing will help achieve the objectives and benefits of the \nProject; \n(iii)  The subproject roads have an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) greater \nthan 12%, meeting the subproject selection criteria; \n(iv)  No supplementary financing was previously provided; and \n(v)  The amount of supplementary financing will not exceed the original financing \napproved by ADB. \n \n31.  A design and monitoring framework for the subproject is in Appendix 1 and a chronology \nof the Project is in Appendix 2. \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008): Fiji Islands. Manila. \n ", "8   \nD.  ADB\u2019s Reengagement Strategy \n \n32.  ADB is implementing a two-stage reengagement strategy (footnote 5) in the Fiji Islands \nfollowing the political crisis in 2006. In the first stage, ADB has continued to support ongoing \noperations, as it has ascertained that the interim government (i) effectively controls the country, \n(ii) generally recognizes the country\u2019s international obligations, (iii) is willing and able to assume \nall of its predecessor\u2019s obligations to ADB, (iv) can ensure the continued implementation of \nongoing projects and programs, and (v) has authorized a representative to make withdrawals. \n \n33.  ADB  has  not  yet  proposed  a  resumption  of  formal  discussions  on  a  new  country \npartnership strategy or a new loan or TA. A proposal to resume full operations in the Fiji Islands \nwill  be  made  once  there  is  evidence  that  the  conditions  for  that  second  stage  of  the \nreengagement strategy exist. The Pacific Department will regularly assess the conditions for \nnew  engagement.  Poverty  reduction  is  a  key  consideration  in  defining  new  lending  and \nnonlending priorities. FRUP III, on the other hand, is included in ADB\u2019s approved and ongoing \nprogram, and it needs supplementary financing to reach completion. Its cost overruns were due \nto factors such as the impact of rising global commodity prices that were largely beyond the \ncontrol of the interim government. The significantly higher construction costs will use up the loan \nresources before the Project is completed. FRUP III is estimated to be about 75% complete \noverall. If it is not completed the Project will not deliver its intended benefits to the poor, namely, \nregular  road  access  to  mainstream  markets and employment.  This failure,  in  turn,  carries \nconsequences for (i) the country, in terms of worsening poverty; and (ii) ADB, in terms of \nreputation risk associated with not reaching the desired development outputs and outcomes. As \nfor the partially completed roads, significant areas (about 65% of the total length, or 33 km) will \ndeteriorate, resulting in partial loss of the investment and increased costs of future upgrading to \nsealed highway standard. \n \nE.  Revised Cost Estimates \n \n34.  The cost estimate for the completion of the Project (US$162.1 million) is based on the \nactual costs incurred thus far and the Government\u2019s estimates of the cost of completing the \nsubproject, including taxes and duties. The estimates are based on (i) rates and prices of \nongoing  contract  packages,  (ii)  rates  and  prices  of  bids  received  for  remaining  contract \npackages, and (iii) the Government\u2019s estimate of the cost of completing a work section by force \naccount. An  investment  plan for the Project  including  cost  overrun  to be financed  by  the \nsupplementary loan is in Table 1 and a detailed cost estimate is in Appendix 3. \n \n ", "  9 \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n(US$ million) \nCost  \nItem  Original  Overruna, b  Total Cost \nA.

Revised Financing Plan \n \n35.  The Government has requested a loan of US$36.1 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a term of 20 years including a grace \nperiod of 2 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility, a yearly commitment charge of 0.15%, and other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft loan agreement. The proposed loan will finance the civil works components (excluding \ntaxes and duties) of the subproject that have been or will be procured through ICB. The \nremaining  costs,  including  financing  charges  during  implementation,  will  be  met  from  the \nGovernment\u2019s own resources. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility given these terms and conditions, \nand  (ii)  an  undertaking  to the effect  that  it  decided  independently,  without  relying  on any \ncommunication or advice from ADB.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Executing Agency \n \n36.  DNR9 will continue to be the EA for the proposed Project, with the permanent secretary \nof the Ministry of Works and Transport responsible for implementation. DNR\u2019s existing FRUP III \nPMU, staffed by a project management engineer and a qualified accountant, will continue to \nhandle procurement and oversee the consulting services, under the supervision of the director \nof roads and airfields. The performance of the PMU in implementing the Project under the \nexisting  sector  loan  has  been  satisfactory:  the  Project  (except  for  the  Kings  and  Lodoni \nSubproject) was completed by the end of 2005. However, a project procurement audit10 brought \nout  critical  deficiencies  in  documenting  project  expenditures,  particularly  for  force  account \nworks.  The  audit  report  urged  the  EA  to  strengthen  the  PMU  for  future  ADB  project \nadministration  and  management.  Improvements  were  made  after  the  audit,  including  the \nestablishment  of  separate  financial  records  for  the  Project.  Such  financial  records  will \nsubstantiate the actual cost of completing the Project in a potential arbitration with the original \ncontractor (para. 24). The EA has arranged for periodic external review of its records. The PMU \nwill have a considerably lighter workload than it had until the end of 2005, when it administered \nseveral contracts, including those for road rehabilitation and consulting services. The remaining \nworks involve only two contracts and one force account section, and so no expansion of the \nPMU  staffing  is  required.  Contract  supervision  and  quality  control  will  be  carried  out  by \nexperienced consultants in contract management roles (as defined in the civil works contracts), \nsupported by a technical staff (engineers, surveyors, materials testing technicians, and works \ninspectors) to be provided directly by the EA. \n \n2.  Consulting Services \n \n37.  Although  the  consulting  firm  that  designed  and  supervised  the  works  performed \nsatisfactorily, it will be replaced by suitably qualified and experienced individual consultants, and \na supporting technical team to be hired directly by the EA. The EA considers the cost of the \nconsulting services so far (about F$11.5 million) to be excessive relative to the value of the work \nsupervised and is seeking greater flexibility to defray costs if the rate of progress is not as \nexpected. International and national consultants will be hired individually. The international \nconsultants will comprise the following: a project manager, to serve as engineer under the \nconstruction  contracts  (26 person-months);  a  resident  engineer,  to oversee  the day-to-day \nsupervision and administration of the contracts (24 person-months); a materials engineer, to \ncontrol  the  quality  of  the  works  (22  person-months);  and  a  senior  works  inspector \n(20 person-months).  National  consultants  (about  280  person-months)  will  support  the \ninternationally recruited personnel. Their terms of reference will be agreed on by ADB and the \nEA, and will include the supervision of the force account work, as recommended in the audit \nreport. Any substantial changes in the supervision arrangements will have to be approved \nbeforehand  by  ADB.  The  EA  will  see  to  it  that  competent  and  experienced  consultants \nacceptable to ADB are employed to supervise the civil works at all times. \n                                                \n9  DNR was established within the Ministry of Works and Transport as the first stage of the transition to an \nindependent road authority. DNR is still a department within the ministry, reporting to its permanent secretary. \n10 ADB. 2006. Office of the Auditor General: 2006 Annual Report: Appendix 4: Project Procurement-Related Audit for \nLoan 1530-FIJ: Third Road Upgrading Sector Project. Manila. \n ", " 11 \n3.  Procurement \n \n38.  Contracts for road upgrading under the proposed supplementary loan will be awarded \nthrough ICB according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nA contract package for the supply of pavement materials, approved by ADB in 2006, is ongoing, \nand the balance of the cost not financed by the original loan will be eligible for financing under \nthe supplementary loan. \n \n39.  The Government will build a 10 km section of the road using its own force account \nprocedures. As recommended in the audit report, the costs will not be eligible for financing \nunder the supplementary loan. \n \n4.  Implementation Schedule \n \n40.  Work  on  the  subproject  is  ongoing  and  will  be  completed  by  October  2011.  An \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 4. \n \n5.  Advance Action and Retroactive Financing \n \n41.  Continuity of the physical work is critical to completing the subproject in a reasonable \nperiod of time. ADB financing for ongoing contracts will be used up in the fourth quarter of 2008. \nThe Government has asked ADB to approve advance action for the procurement of civil works. \nAdvance action covers invitation of bids, bidding, bid evaluation, and contract award. The \nadvance  action  will  be  reviewed  for  conformity  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of the advance action, if granted, does not commit \nADB to provide supplementary financing for the Project. \n \n42.  The Project will provide retroactive financing for civil works. Retroactive financing will be \npermitted only if (i) ADB and the Borrower specifically agree to it in the loan agreement, and \nonly under the terms of the relevant agreement; (ii) the works for which it is requested are \nprocured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines; and (iii) not more than 20% of the loan \namount is financed retroactively. The expenditures must have been incurred before the loan \nagreement takes effect, but no earlier than 12 months before the date the agreement is signed. \n \n43.  The Government has informed ADB that it applied ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines in \nobtaining bids for the remaining two civil works contract packages, including advertising of \ntenders  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  Procurement  followed  single-stage,  one-envelope  international \nbidding with post-qualification. The Government will submit its bid evaluation reports, including a \nfull account of the procurement process, to ADB for review before any contract award. The \nprocurement plan is in Appendix 5. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n44.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  as  provided  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Direct payment procedures will be used for \nthe civil works contracts. There will be no imprest account. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n45.  DNR  will  make  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  reporting  progress  in  project \nimplementation. It will submit to ADB quarterly progress reports about preconstruction activities \n ", "12  \nand  construction  of  all  civil  works  including  physical  and  financial  progress,  status  of \nenvironmental  management,  institutional  development,  asset  management,  financial \nadministration and forward budgeting, institutional capacity building, public communications, \nand other activities relevant to project implementation. To facilitate performance monitoring and \npost-project  review,  the  Government  will  provide  ADB,  within  3  months  of  the  physical \ncompletion of the Project, a completion report covering project implementation details, costs and \nbenefits, and any other information that may be required by ADB. \n \n46.  DNR will keep separate records and accounts for the Project identifying the goods and \nservices financed from the loan, the expenditures incurred for the Project, and the use of \ncounterpart funds. The project accounts will be established and maintained according to sound \naccounting principles and practices based on internationally accepted accounting standards. \nThe project accounts and annual financial statements will be subject to annual external audit by \nauditors acceptable to ADB. The annual audit reports will include an auditor\u2019s opinion on the use \nof the loan proceeds and compliance with the financial covenants in the loan agreement. The \nGovernment will provide ADB with the annual audited financial statements, audited project \naccounts, audit reports, and management letters and other related statements in English, no \nlater than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year throughout the implementation period. ADB \nwill issue a formal warning for accounts that are more than 6 months overdue and will suspend \ndisbursements for accounts that are 12 months overdue. \n \n8.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n47.  The Government has compiled and analyzed base data to facilitate benefit monitoring \nand evaluation of the Project\u2019s socioeconomic impact. The monitoring and evaluation program \ncomprises three major activities: (i) benchmarking, to assist project planners and implementers \nin designing and implementing projects that respond to the needs of the intended beneficiaries, \nand to provide a basis for an objective assessment of the impact of the Project; (ii) monitoring \nduring implementation to ensure that the Project indeed benefits the intended beneficiaries; and \n(iii) evaluation  after  the  Project  to  assess  its  overall  effectiveness.  Such  monitoring  and \nevaluation has been done for the completed subprojects and is ongoing for the Kings and \nLodoni roads subproject. Measurement indicators under the original Project are in Appendix 6. \n \n9.  Anticorruption Policy  \n \n48.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  the  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. The Project will also \ncomply with all applicable anticorruption laws of the Republic of the Fiji Islands. A project \nwebsite will be established and used to disclose the audited project financial accounts, project \nprogress, and procurement activities. \n \n \n \n \n ", " 13 \n10.  Project Review \n \n49.  ADB and the Government will undertake semiannual and midterm reviews of the Project \nto assess (i) compliance with the loan covenants, (ii) physical achievements against milestones, \n(iii) loan disbursements and financial progress, and (iv) project implementation issues that need \nto be resolved or acted on. The EA will review the estimates of the subproject costs each \nquarter and reassess the project benefits if such costs increase by more than 10% of the base \ncosts. Assumptions and risks noted in the design and monitoring framework will be periodically \nreviewed and corrective action taken if needed. \n \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Economic Analysis \n50.  The subproject is part of the Government\u2019s FRUP Ill and supports its macroeconomic \nand sector objectives. To ensure the economic viability of all subprojects eligible for ADB \nfinancing, the minimum economic internal rate of return was set at 12%. The benefits of road \nupgrading will accrue primarily from savings in vehicle operating costs. Daily traffic on each \nsubproject road was forecast in the feasibility documentation. From experience with earlier road \nupgrading projects in Fiji Islands, traffic on upgraded road links has increased beyond the \nforecasts. Other benefits include lower transport costs both to suppliers and to users of goods \nand  services;  increased  agricultural  production  resulting  from  improved  access  to  rural \ncommunities and market centers; better access to health services, jobs, and schools; reduced \ndust; and increased tourism. Besides the benefits from road use, the civil works under the \nProject  have  generated  at  least  4,000\u20135,000  person-years  of  employment  for  skilled  and \nunskilled labor. The partly completed roads will deteriorate if they are not completed or if \ncompletion is deferred. The deterioration will result in increased maintenance costs and loss of \nbenefits from sunk costs. \n \n51.  The subproject was previously investigated under feasibility studies carried out for FRUP \nIII in 1997\u20131998 under preparatory TA. The present review of the economic analysis uses \nmethods similar to those used in the FRUP III feasibility study, with updated traffic projections \nand cost base. But instead of the Transport Research Laboratory Road Transport Investment \nModel as the tool of analysis, this review uses the World Bank Highway Development and \nManagement Model and updates the base case to take account of the work done in the interim. \nAlso, the present analysis is incremental, so it considers only those construction costs that are \nnot already sunk, and those benefits obtained from upgrading the road from its partly completed \nstate to its final design standard. \n \n52.  Economic  costs,  derived  from  financial  costs,  include  construction,  operation,  and \nmaintenance costs and exclude price contingencies, taxes, duties, subsidies, and royalties.11 A \nstandard conversion factor of 0.986 was used to revalue goods and services at world prices into \nnational currency, and a shadow wage rate factor of 0.86 was applied to local unskilled labor. \nThese same factors were applied to capital and maintenance costs and the elements of vehicle \noperating and passenger time costs. For minor items where assessing the proportion of tax and \nduty within the financial costs was difficult, a conversion factor of 0.80 was applied. The project \nroads  are  expected  to  have  an  economic  life  of  20\u201325  years  before  major  pavement \nrehabilitation is needed, with resurfacing at intervals throughout this period. The incremental \n                                                \n11 Royalties refer to payments to landowners for gravel and soil extracted from quarries and pits on their land. \n ", "14  \noperation and maintenance costs are the difference between the maintenance requirements for \nthe proposed upgraded bitumen-sealed roads and the maintenance requirements of the existing \ngravel-surface roads. \n \n53.  To estimate the benefits to road users, the differences between road user costs with and \nwithout the Project were compared. Quantified road user benefits comprise vehicle operating \ncost and journey time savings, and reductions in traffic delay and associated vehicle operating \ncosts at one-lane bridges. Producer surplus benefits were included for agricultural development \nstimulated by the subproject within the direct area of influence of the road. Road user savings \nwere not included for agricultural freight traffic to avoid double-counting. The producer surplus \nbenefits were derived from detailed analysis from the original FRUP III feasibility study, updated \nto reflect changes in the cost base from 1997 to 2008. \n \n54.  Unit cost data for vehicle replacement, tires, fuel, oil, maintenance labor, and crew \nwages came from road feasibility studies done in 2005 and 2007 for the Department of National \nRoads and ADB for the proposed FRUP IV. These studies included comprehensive surveys of \nvehicle operating cost inputs, market prices, taxes, and duties. Apart from fuel, vehicle running \ncosts were updated through the use of the \u201call groups\u201d and \u201ctransport group\u201d components of the \nconsumer price index as reported by the Reserve Bank of Fiji Islands and the Fiji Islands \nBureau of Statistics. In the case of the transport group index, increases since 2007 are almost \nentirely  attributable  to  gasoline  and  diesel  fuel;  the  economic  cost  of  fuel  was  therefore \nreassessed through the use of current retail prices, without taking duties and taxes into account. \nFuel costs are volatile, but the present level is judged to be suitably representative of the \nmedium-term outlook, and corresponds to a light crude oil price of around US$120 per barrel. \nFuel, a significant component of road user costs, has more than doubled in economic cost since \nthe original FRUP III feasibility study was prepared. \n \n55.  Sensitivity testing was applied to the EIRR against construction cost, base traffic level, \nand traffic growth rate, including or excluding producer surplus and economic multiplier benefits. \nThe value needed to give an EIRR of 12% (the switching value) and the sensitivity index (the \npercentage change in the variable divided by the percentage change in the net present value) \nwere  calculated  in  each  case.  Numerical  simulation  techniques  were  used  to  model  the \nprobability that the EIRR would exceed 12%, given the maximum, most likely, and minimum \nvalues of the main input parameters and assumed probability distributions. \n \n56.  As in the original analysis, no allowance was made for changes in accident costs. While \nthe improved alignment and road surface are potential safety improvement factors, increased \ntraffic  speeds  may  lead  to  crash  injuries  that  could  be  more  severe,  depending  on  the \neffectiveness of traffic management, particularly through or close to villages, signage, and \npolicing. A summary economic analysis for the subproject is in Appendix 7. \n \n1.  Kings Road \n57.  Kings Road is expected to yield benefits that other roads considered for the Project will \nnot offer. These are due to a reduction in length of almost 5 km, representing a distance saving \nof over 9% of the existing length, and benefits to diverted traffic. The benefits to diverted traffic \nwere calculated from the results of origin and destination surveys that estimated the traffic \ndiverting to Kings Road from other routes, and from savings accruing from the reduced journey \nlength. The calculation of vehicle operating cost savings was based on economic costs per \nkilometer, on the assumption that the journeys would be made on a good sealed road in both \nthe with- and the without-project cases. \n ", " 15 \n58.  Traffic growth in recent years on the Kings Road project section has been very variable, \naveraging 8% on the first link between Korovou and Waito, but erratic on the other links. The \nprogressive upgrading of adjacent sections of the road has influenced traffic growth on the \nproject links. The section north of Nayavu has been upgraded since 2004, and this has probably \ncontributed to strong growth between 2004 and 2008. More generally across the country, traffic \ngrowth rates, averaged over 175 of DNR\u2019s traffic counts between 2000 and 2004, showed an \nincrease of 25% (4.5% per year) compared with an increase of 14.6% in real gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) (3.5% per year), for an implied factor of 1.72. \n \n59.  The  original  FRUP  III  feasibility  study  established  the  traffic  generation  effects  of \nupgrading  sections  of  Kings  Road  from  gravel  to  seal.  Traffic  increases  after  completion \nmeasured at six sites were observed to vary from 28% to 92%, with a general relationship of \n50% growth for light traffic and 5% for heavy traffic for road lengths of over 10 km. The evidence \nis still valid and in some respects may be a conservative estimate, as the subproject will \ncomplete the sealing of Kings Road. In particular, it is not possible to distinguish between heavy \nand light vehicles in generated traffic growth: both respond strongly to upgrading. A 50% growth \nrate for normal traffic after implementation was therefore used. \n \n60.  The estimated traffic did not allow for possible increases caused by an acceleration of \ndevelopment in the northeast of Fiji Islands, which may follow the upgrading of Kings Road. \nAnother source of additional benefit that was not included in the analysis is the removal of \nconstraints on traffic caused by the closure of the road in the rainy season. Bridgeworks, \nalready completed under the subproject, will prevent such closures. \n \n61.  An evaluation period of 25 years, covering the 2-year construction period and the design \nlife of the road before major rehabilitation, was used in the analysis. The diverted traffic and \nproducer surplus benefits were estimated for the Kings Road link as a whole, and were added to \nthe benefits to normal and generated traffic calculated for each link through the use of the World \nBank\u2019s Highway Development and Management (HDM) model.12 The incremental analysis to \nproject completion resulted in a present value of F$49.5 million for discounted costs and F$50.3 \nmillion for discounted benefits, and an EIRR of 12.2%. \n \n62.  An analysis of risk using numerical simulation in which the main sensitivity parameters \nwere replaced with defined probability distributions was carried out. On this basis, there is 54% \nprobability that the EIRR for the subproject will exceed 12%, and 94% probability that the EIRR \nwill exceed 10%. \n \n63.  The original feasibility study, on the other hand, yielded an EIRR of 15.7%, and a \npresent value of F$16.8 million for discounted costs and F$23.0 million for discounted benefits. \nThe EIRR  for  the completion of  the  subproject  still  just exceeds  12% despite  the  greatly \nincreased cost for the following reasons: (i) base traffic has grown substantially from 230 \nvehicles per day in 1997 to 540 vehicles per day in 2008, averaged over the length of the \nsubproject; (ii) the traffic that can be diverted has also grown; (iii) while some savings in \ndistance reduction and single-lane bridge replacement have already been achieved, most of the \nuser  benefits  will  arise  from  the  pavement  construction  and  sealing,  which  is  yet  to  be \ncompleted; and (iv) while construction costs have increased, so too have the unit values of \nproject benefits. A post-evaluation of the total costs and benefits of the subproject, including \nsunk costs and benefits compared against the pre-construction condition, is likely to show a \n                                                \n12 The software models pavement deterioration and corresponding changes in vehicle operating costs. \n ", "16  \nlower EIRR. However, it is the incremental costs and benefits to completion that are relevant to \nthe supplementary-funding decision. \n \n2.  Lodoni Road \n \n64.  Traffic volumes on Lodoni Road are influenced by the ferry services operating from \nNatovi Jetty. When the FRUP III feasibility study was prepared, there were daily return services \nto Ovalau (Buresala) and Nabouwalu, and a single weekly service to Savusavu, all operated by \nPatterson Brothers Shipping. At that time, ferry services were estimated to contribute about 40 \nheavy trucks per day. Patterson Brothers continues to operate a daily service to Savusavu, and \nhas had disputes with other operators regarding berth occupancy at Natovi, a public facility, \nindicating that  there  will  be  continued  strong  demand for  its  use  as a  boarding point for \ninterisland services. The completion of a sealed road connection is likely to make the facility \neven  more  attractive.  Lodoni  Road  also  serves  two  major educational establishments,  the \nQueen Victoria School and the Ratu Kadalevu School, in addition to the entire population of the \neast coast of Viti Levu north of Korovou. \n \n65.  Traffic growth over 2000\u20132004 on Lodoni Road averaged about 6.5% (linear) at both \nDNR traffic count sites. However, a comparison against the 1995 counts indicates that this may \nbe a statistical aberration. A normal traffic growth rate of 3.5% over the medium to long term, \nsimilar to that adopted for Kings Road, was therefore used in the analysis. As with Kings Road, \nand following an analysis of previous projects in the area, generated traffic was assumed to be \n50%. \n \n66.  A present value of F$12.5 million for discounted costs and F$15.6 million for discounted \nbenefits for the completion of the Lodoni Road upgrading, and incremental EIRR of 15.2%, was \nderived. The risk analysis shows 89% probability that the EIRR for the completion of the Project \nwill exceed 12%, and 99% probability that it will exceed 10%. \n \n67.  In comparison, the original feasibility study gave an EIRR of 14.8%, with a present value \nof  F$10.0  million  for  discounted  costs  and  F$12.4  million  for  discounted  benefits.  The \nincremental EIRR is still greater than 12% despite the increased subproject cost for reasons \nsimilar  to  those  for  Kings  Road,  although  in  this  case  there  is  no  diverted  traffic  and  a \nmuch-smaller reduction in road length. \n \n3.  Confirmation of Economic Viability \n \n68.  When the incremental benefits and costs of completing each road are compared, both \nlinks remain economically viable, with an EIRR of 12.2% for Kings Road and 15.2% for Lodoni \nRoad. The combined EIRR for the entire Project is 12.8%. \n \nB.  Environmental Impact \n \n69.  The original contractor for the Kings and Lodoni roads was required to prepare an \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP)  for  the  construction  of  the  works.  In  addition, \nenvironmental impact assessments (EIAs) and associated EMPs were required for all quarries \nor borrow pits from which more than 5,000 cubic meters of soil, gravel, or rock were to be \nextracted. These EMPs and EIAs were prepared and approved by the supervising engineers \nand by the Ministry of Tourism and Environment, and the work has conformed to the subproject \nEMPs. About 80% of the site has been worked on, with earthworks completed within the site \nboundaries. Existing quarries (those for which EIAs were prepared by the original contractor) \n ", " 17 \nwill be used to complete the works; no new borrow pits of significance are expected. In fact, \nunused borrow pits have been satisfactorily reinstated, as was noted during the Fact-Finding \nMission. \n \n70.  Bidding documents for contract packages awarded for the completion of the subproject \nafter the termination of the original contract require the contractors to adhere to approved \nEMPs. No significant or unanticipated environmental impact from construction has so far been \nexperienced. The supplementary loan is therefore classified as category C. \n \nC.  Social Impact \n \n71.  A social impact study of the subproject (Supplementary Appendix A) confirmed that the \nsubproject roads serve a predominantly rural and relatively disadvantaged segment of the \ncommunity. In 2002, the incidence of poverty was significantly higher in the area served directly \nby the roads (76.4% of the sample group) than in rural areas nationwide (40%).13 That same \nyear, the incidence of poverty (84%) was considerably higher among Fijians in the study area \n(84%) than among Fijians nationwide (34%). In contrast, the incidence of poverty was less \namong  the  Indo-Fijian  sample  group  (22%)  than  among  Indo-Fijians  nationwide  (37%). \nFurthermore, 90% of the Fijian sample group had household incomes in 2002 that were well \nbelow  the  national  average14 for  rural  Fijian  households  ($11,082),  while  only 22% of the \nIndo-Fijian  sample  group  was  living  well  below  the  national  average for  rural  Indo-Fijians \n($9,653). The subproject will reduce vehicle operating costs and produce time savings (direct \nbenefits), and will also improve access to rural communities and to basic social facilities, as well \nas socioeconomic conditions in the areas served by the upgraded roads (indirect benefits). \n \nD.  Resettlement Impact \n \n72.  All  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  actions  needed  for  the  subproject  have  been \ncompleted  satisfactorily  according  to  the  provisions  of  the  original  loan  agreement,  the \nGovernment\u2019s policy and procedures, and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \n \nE.  Gender Impact \n \n73.  No gender issues or specific opportunities for gender equality are associated with the \ncompletion of the Kings and Lodoni roads, given the limited focus of the subproject on road \nconstruction. But the Project as a whole will have pervasive benefits: all segments of the \npopulation\u2014women, men, youth, and disadvantaged groups\u2014will gain from it. \n \nF.  Risks \n \n74.  The disengagement of the consulting firm that was supervising the subproject brings a \nrisk that alternative arrangements will not be satisfactory, since the EA seems to have replaced \nthe consultant solely to save on costs. The quality of the work, in a difficult environment of poor \nsoils and high rainfall, requires a comprehensive system of inspection and testing, but such a \nsystem may not hold up if those responsible are not independent of the EA and are not held \naccountable for failing to perform adequately. Kings Road in particular is in a high-rainfall area, \n                                                \n13 Narsey, W. 2008. The Quantitative Analysis of Poverty in Fiji. Fiji Islands Bureau of Statistics and The University of \nthe South Pacific. Suva, Fiji. \n14 Narsey, W. 2006. Report on the 2002\u20132003 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. Fiji Islands Bureau of \nStatistics. Suva, Fiji. \n ", "18  \nand poor climatic conditions during implementation could delay its completion. Hiring individual \nconsultants who are professionally and academically qualified, and have considerable and \nverifiable experience, can mitigate this risk. The risk should also be seen in light of the fact that \nkey technical challenges, including the construction of 16 bridges and the establishment of \nsuitable quarries and borrow pits, have already been surmounted and the remaining work is of \nmodest complexity, despite the difficult environment in which it is to be carried out. \n \n75.  The Government has been slow in arranging a variation to the contract for the provision \nof pavement materials. Base-course material must be washed to remove clay contaminants so \nthat it meets the specified quality; the potential need for such washing (at additional cost to the \nGovernment) was foreseen in the contract. Delays in resolving this issue will directly affect \nsubsequent work, as the material is needed for the final pavement layer before the bituminous \nseal can be applied. This is an immediate requirement in one of the contracts still to be \nprocured. Deferring the award of this contract until there is enough supply of base course may \nmitigate this risk. However, deferment will also increase the risk of damage to the underlying \npavement layers that have already been constructed. The EA has advised that the bids received \nso  far  are  either  heavily  qualified  (to  the  extent  of  being  unresponsive)  or  submitted  by \nunqualified bidders. The earliest at which this contract can be awarded, after new bids are \ninvited, is April 2009, giving the EA more time to resolve the issue of base-course supply. Base \ncourse will not be needed for the second contract until August 2009, if the contract is awarded \nby January 2009. The issue preventing agreement is financial rather than technical. Risks lie in \nthe possibility that negotiations will continue to be protracted. An agreement for mediation or \narbitration on the cost of the additional work would allow it to begin immediately, with costs to be \ndetermined on the basis of actual costs. \n \n76.  Two ICB contracts still have to be awarded, and the cost of all work, including the force \naccount work, is very sensitive to the price of fuel in particular. The cost estimates are based on \nbid prices received in mid-2008, and these were in turn based on high fuel costs, which have \nsince moderated significantly. Actual fuel costs will be reflected in the final contract price of one \nof the ICB contracts (if awarded under the current bid process) through its contractual provisions \nfor price adjustment. The other ICB contract has no price adjustment provision because it is of \nrelatively short duration (13 months). The latter contract may be rebid with price adjustment \nprovisions. The former contract may also be rebid to ensure that the bid prices adequately \nreflect  the  significant  economic  changes  that  have  occurred  worldwide  since  July  2008 \n(including currency realignments and a significant fall in the price of oil). \n \n77.  The timely completion of the subproject depends on the careful selection of appropriately \nexperienced and competent contractors to do the work. The original contractor failed to provide \nadequate skilled supervisory personnel or sufficient equipment for the work, with due regard to \nthe  production  rates  required  and  the  limitations  imposed  by  the  generally  wet  climatic \nconditions in the area. A thorough review of the bidders\u2019 experience in similar work, and the \namount, age, and condition of the equipment that is proposed for the work, should therefore be \npart of the bid evaluation. The EA should require a firm undertaking from the recommended \ncontractor that it will mobilize at least the promised level of resources. \n \n78.  The completion of the subproject is subject to technical risks that are largely within the \ncontrol of the EA. These risks can be satisfactorily mitigated through sound project management \nand supervision. \n \n \n ", " 19 \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n79.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Counterpart  financing.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  throughout  the \nimplementation of the Project, adequate budgetary allocations of the required \ncounterpart funds are made, approved, and released in a timely manner in order \nto ensure the proper implementation of the Project. \n \n(ii)  Cost recovery under the original civil works contract. In the event that the \nGovernment is successful, in whole or in part, in recovering the cost overrun from \nthe original contractor, then such sums will be applied to the extent necessary,  \nto priority road rehabilitation as defined by the road asset management system \nand to ensure adequate funding of road maintenance. \n \n(iii)  Project management. The Government will ensure that the PMU is adequately \nstaffed and resourced, including a qualified financial officer and an experienced \nproject management engineer, exclusively for the Project. DNR shall recruit and \nretain, during the implementation of the Project, consultants with competence \nand  experience  acceptable  to  ADB,  for  construction  supervision,  including \nsupervision  of  the  force  account  work.  The  terms  of  reference  of  such \nconsultants will be determined by agreement between ADB and DNR. \n \n(iv)  Construction quality. DNR will ensure that the Project is built in accordance \nwith the technical design specifications and that construction supervision, quality \ncontrol,  and  contract  management  are  implemented  in  accordance  with \ninternationally accepted standards. \n \n(v)  Land acquisition and resettlement. The Government will ensure that any land \nacquisition or involuntary resettlement required for the Project will be managed in \naccordance  with  applicable  government  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \n \n(vi)  Environmental  management.  DNR  will  (a)  design,  construct,  operate,  and \nmaintain the roads in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations in the \nFiji Islands and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002); (b) ensure that EMPs for the \nremaining civil works contract packages (except civil works contract packages \nthe bidding documents for which have been issued by DNR and approved by \nADB prior to the effectiveness of the loan agreement) and works procured by \nforce account are updated and approved by ADB prior to the bidding of those \ncivil works contract packages or the commencement of works procured by force \naccount,  as  the  case  may  be;  (c)  incorporate  all  environmental  mitigation, \nmonitoring,  and  reporting  measures  specified  in  the  updated  EMPs  in  the \nrelevant bidding documents and civil works contract specifications; and (d) report \nto ADB any unanticipated negative environmental impact, and take proper action \nto mitigate the impact. \n \n ", "20  \n(vii)  Environmental monitoring and reporting. DNR will (a) ensure that the force \naccount works and civil works contractors are monitored closely to comply with \nall environmental impact mitigation, monitoring, and consultation requirements in \nthe EMPs; and (b) prepare and submit to ADB a consolidated quarterly report for \nall EMPs being implemented during the project implementation. \n \n(viii)  Labor standards. DNR will ensure that provisions are stipulated in all civil works \ncontracts  to  require  contractors  employed  under  the  Project  to  incorporate \nminimum  workplace  occupational  safety  norms,  including  the  core  labor \nstandards  as  identified  in  the  fundamental  International  Labour  Organization \nconventions.  DNR  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all \napplicable  labor  laws  and  do  not  employ  child  labor  in  any  aspect  of  their \nactivities.  DNR  will  ensure  that  contractors  provide appropriate  training, and \ninformation materials for workers on HIV/AIDS prevention, and that contractors \nand their workers observe local protocols concerning acceptable behavior toward \nthe  local  population.  DNR  will  require  contractors  not to  differentiate  wages \nbetween men and women for work of equal value. All civil works contracts to be \nfinanced under the ADB loan will include specific clauses to this effect, and \ncompliance shall be strictly monitored during project implementation. \n \n(ix)  Governance  and  anticorruption.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  (a)  the \nProject is carried out in accordance with all applicable anticorruption laws and \nregulations in the Fiji Islands and ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date); and (b) a project website is developed within 2 months of effectiveness \nof the loan agreement, and maintained to disclose the audited project financial \naccounts, project progress, and procurement activities. \n \nB.  Condition for Disbursement \n \n80.  No disbursement of the loan proceeds for works will take place until DNR will have \nrecruited consultants with competence and experience acceptable to ADB, for construction \nsupervision,  including  supervision  of  the  works  procured  by  force  account.  The  following \nfull-time  positions  will  be  occupied  by  the  consultants:  a  supervising  engineer,  a  resident \nengineer, a materials engineer, and a senior works inspector. \n \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n81.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the supplementary \nloan of US$36,100,000 to the Republic of the Fiji Islands for the Third Road Upgrading (Sector) \nProject from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  term  of  20  years, \nincluding a grace period of 2 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n24 February 2009 \n ", "  Appendix 1  21  \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and  Assumptions \nSummary  and Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nEconomic and social  Incidence of  Household income and  Country economic conditions \ndevelopment; hardship  households in the  expenditure survey (HIES)  are conducive to uptake of \nand poverty reduction   subproject catchment  2002/03 and future  improved economic \narea beneath the Fiji  reports, rural  opportunities \nbasic needs poverty  unemployment data \nline (US$150 per week)   \nreduced from 76% to   \n \nless than 60% by June \n2012 \n \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved access to  13,000 people resident  Demographic surveys  New contracts are \nservices and markets   in the catchment area  (Bureau of Statistics)  implemented on time \nwith direct access to     \nsealed roads by     \nOctober 2011     \n   \nReduced travel times  Savings in transport costs \non Kings and Lodoni  (BME) \nroads (average vehicle   \noperating speeds  Traffic counts by \nincreased from 30 km  Department of National \nper hour to 50 km per  Roads (DNR) \nhour by October 2011)   \n   \nReduction in vehicle  Road roughness \noperating cost through  measurements (DNR) \nreduction in average   \ninternational road   \nroughness index from   \ngreater than 10 mm/km   \nto less than 4 mm/km   \nby October 2011    \n   \nIncrease in daily traffic   \n(baseline values in   \n2008 surveys to review  Change in number of road \nsubproject viability) by  accidents and in causes of \nan average annual  accidents (BME) \ncompound rate of 3.5%  (analysis of police traffic \n  accident data unit road \nRoad safety  accident records and \nimprovements  reports) \n \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.

For the Lodoni and Kings Road upgrading subproject, the without-project \nbase case against which changes in road provider and road user costs are compared is the \npartially  upgraded  gravel-standard  road on  a  constrained  alignment.  The  with-project  case \ninvolves  carriageway  widening,  double  surface-treated  bitumen  chip-seal  pavement,  minor \nhorizontal realignment with some length reduction, improvements in the vertical profile, and \nreplacement of single-lane bridges in poor structural condition with two-lane bridges. \n \n2.  Previous Investigation. The subproject was previously investigated under feasibility \nstudies carried out for Third Road Upgrading (Sector) Project (FRUP III) in 1997\u20131998 as \npreparatory technical assistance.1 These studies should be referred to for details of the prior \neconomic analysis. The Kings Road section (Korovou\u2013Dama) was originally investigated in \n1995 as a possible subproject for the earlier FRUP II, but the matter was not pursued at that \ntime. \n \n3.  The  prior  economic  analysis  estimated  discounted  economic  costs,  benefits,  and \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR), as shown in Table A7.1 below. Vehicle operating cost \nand travel time savings were evaluated in the usual way for normal, generated, and, in the case \nof Kings Road, diverted traffic. For agricultural freight traffic, a producer surplus approach was \nused for Kings Road, in view of the Subproject\u2019s function in enabling cash crop production from \nthe hinterland served. The cash cropping of perishable market produce, sensitive to time delay \nand road roughness, is now constrained by lack of reliable all-weather access. The price \nstructure, supply elasticities, and potential production volumes were estimated through the use \nof Ministry of Agriculture data for fruit and vegetable crops, but excluding the area already \nearmarked for a government development project. \n \nTable A7.1: Prior Economic Assessment  \n(US$) \n \nItem  Kings Road  Lodoni Road \nDiscounted Costs     \n  Construction  18.99  11.33 \n  Maintenance Savings  (2.16)  (1.28) \n  Total  16.83   10.05 \nDiscounted Benefits     \n  Vehicle Operating Cost Savings  15.69  10.60 \n  Time Savings  4.23  5.53 \n  Single-Lane Bridge Delay  0.14  0.36 \nSavings \n  Agricultural Producer Surplus   2.92  \u2014 \n  Total  22.98  16.49 \n  EIRR  15.7%  14.8% \n\u2014 = not available, ( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, - = not available. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 1997.

Current Review. This review of the economic analysis uses methodology similar to that \nused  in  the  FRUP  III  feasibility  study  but  with  updated  traffic  projections  and  cost  base. \nDifferences lie in the use of the World Bank Highway Development and Management (HDM) in \nplace of the Transport Research Laboratory Road Transport Investment Model (RTIM) as the \nanalysis tool, and the updating of the base case to take account of the work already done in the \ninterim on the first section of Kings Road. The analysis is made on an incremental basis, \ncomparing the economic benefits yet to be obtained by completing the subproject against the \nincremental  costs  to  completion  of  construction.  Costs  already  expended  in  the  partial \nconstruction to date are regarded as sunk, and so are not included in the analysis. Similarly, \nbenefits already obtained, such as through route shortening on the first section of Kings Road \nand completion of several single-lane bridges, are excluded from the analysis. \n \n5.  Costs.  Economic  costs  were  derived  from  financial  costs  and  include  the  cost  of \nconstruction, operation, and maintenance. Price contingencies, taxes, duties, subsidies, and \nroyalties  are  excluded.  As  with  other  recent  ADB  projects  in  the  Fiji  Islands,  a  standard \nconversion factor of 0.986 was used to revalue goods and services at world prices into national \ncurrency and a shadow wage rate factor of 0.86 was applied to local unskilled labor. These \nsame factors  were applied  to  capital  and  maintenance  costs and the elements of  vehicle \noperating and passenger time costs. A conversion factor of 0.80 was applied to minor items \nwhere assessing the proportion of tax and duty within the financial costs was difficult. The \nproject roads are expected to have an economic life of 20\u201325 years before major pavement \nrehabilitation,  with  resurfacing  applied  at  intervals  throughout  this  period.  The  incremental \noperation and maintenance costs are the difference between the maintenance requirements for \nthe proposed upgraded bitumen-sealed roads and the maintenance requirements of the existing \ngravel-surface roads. \n \n6.  Benefits. The benefits to road users were estimated by comparing the differences \nbetween road user costs for the with- and without-project cases. Quantified road user benefits \ncomprise vehicle operating cost and journey time savings, and reductions in traffic delay and \nassociated vehicle operating costs at one-lane bridges. Producer surplus benefits have been \nincluded for agricultural development stimulated by the subproject within the direct area of \ninfluence of the road. Road user savings have not been included for agricultural freight traffic to \navoid double-counting. The producer surplus benefits are based on detailed analysis from the \noriginal FRUP III feasibility study, updated to reflect changes in the cost base between 1997 and \n2008. \n \n7.  Modeling. The HDM model was used to compare the annual streams of economic \ncapital and operating costs and benefits and derived net present values (NPVs) and EIRR. All \ncosts and benefits are expressed in 2008 constant prices. The analysis period was 25 years \nfrom 2009 to 2033, extending over a 2-year construction program and the economic life of the \nupgraded road links before major rehabilitation. Diverted traffic benefits and producer surplus \nbenefits were estimated exogenously to the HDM model. \n \n8.  Sensitivity  and  Risk.  Sensitivity  testing  was  applied  to  the  EIRR  against  a  20% \nincrease in construction cost, a 20% decrease in base traffic level, a one-percentage-point \nreduction in normal traffic growth rate, a crude oil price reduction of 25%, the exclusion of \nproducer surplus benefits, and a project completion delay of 1 year. The value needed to give \nan EIRR of 12% (the switching value) and the sensitivity index (the percentage change in the \nvariable divided by the percentage change in the NPV) were calculated in each case. Numerical \nsimulation techniques were used to model the probability that the EIRR would exceed 12% and \n ", "3  2  Appendix 7 \n10%, given the maximum, most likely, and minimum values of the main input parameters and \nassumed probability distributions. \nB.  Road User Costs \n9.  Unit cost data for vehicle replacement, tires, fuel, oil, maintenance labor, and crew \nwages have been derived from road feasibility studies carried out in 2005 and 2007 for the \nDepartment of National Roads (DNR) and ADB for the proposed FRUP IV. These studies \nincluded comprehensive surveys of vehicle operating cost inputs, market prices, taxes, and \nduties. Apart from fuel, vehicle running costs have been updated using the \u201call groups\u201d and \n\u201ctransport group\u201d components of the consumer price index as reported by the Reserve Bank of \nFiji and the Fiji Islands Bureau of Statistics. In the case of the transport group index, increases \nsince 2007 are almost entirely attributable to gasoline and diesel fuel, and the economic cost of \nfuel has therefore been reassessed using current retail prices and removing duties and taxes. \nFuel costs are volatile, but the present level is judged to be suitably representative of the \nmedium-term outlook, and corresponds to a light crude oil price in the region of US$120 per \nbarrel. Fuel forms a significant component of road user costs and its economic cost has more \nthan doubled since the original FRUP III feasibility study was prepared. \n \n10.  Values for work travel time, crew wages, and maintenance labor are based on 2007 \nsurveyed values used in prior feasibility studies carried out for the DNR. Although wage growth \nexpectations as reported by the Reserve Bank of Fiji, average 3% per year, in the present \neconomic climate no increment from 2007 has been assumed. \n \n11.  As with the original analysis, no allowance has been made for changes in accident \ncosts. While the improved alignment and road surface are potential safety improvement factors, \nincreased traffic speeds may lead to more severe crash injuries. The outcome will depend on \nthe effectiveness of traffic management, particularly through or close to villages, signage, and \npolicing. \nC.  Kings Road, Korovou\u2013Nayavu \n1.  Road Links for Analysis \n12.  The study section of Kings Road begins at the roundabout immediately north of Korovou \nat the junction with Lodoni Road, identified as Road 23000, kilometer (km) 10.108, in the DNR\u2019s \nasset management inventory. It ends at the DNR depot in Nayavu, identified as km 32.864 in \nthe inventory (note: inventory kilometer points may not correspond to actual distances because \nconstruction changes route length over time). The road has been divided into three links for \nanalysis in relation to changes in traffic level, road alignment, and terrain: (i) the first 9.2 km to \nWaito, which is mainly level to rolling terrain through agricultural land used for dairy farming; \n(ii) a mountainous 11.4 km section, where the road rises over a range of hills before descending \nto the Wainibuka Valley, the end of the section being at Waioluta, the junction with Vunidawa \nRoad; and (iii) the remaining 11.2 km, which follows the east bank of the Wainibuka River \nthrough numerous villages, some of which are bypassed by the new road alignment. \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 7  33  \n2.  Road Geometry and Condition \n13.  The existing road geometry, averaged over each link, is shown in Table A7.2 for the \nexisting road condition and for the proposed upgrading.

Existing road conditions were determined from the DNR road asset inventory and from \nvisual inspection and roughness surveys carried out for this analysis, as shown in Table A7.3. \nAverage  road  surface  roughness  is  in  international  road  roughness  index  (IRI)  units  of \nmillimeters per kilometer, integrated over the road length.

Traffic Growth and Projections \n17.  Traffic is considered in the three categories of normal traffic growth (traffic growth that \nwould occur irrespective of the Project), generated traffic (new traffic developed as a result of \nincreased activity attributable to the Project, and diverted traffic (rerouting of traffic induced by \nthe Project). \n \n18.  Normal Traffic. Traffic growth over recent years on the Kings Road subproject section \nhas been very variable, averaging 8% on the first link between Korovou and Waito, but erratic \non  the  remaining  links.  Progressive  upgrading  of  adjacent  sections  of  Kings  Road  has \ninfluenced traffic growth on the project links. The section north of Nayavu has been upgraded \nsince 2004, and is credited with the strong growth between 2004 and 2008. More generally \nacross the country, traffic growth rates, averaged over 175 of DNR\u2019s traffic counts between \n2000 and 2004, showed an increase of 25% (4.5% yearly), compared with an increase of 14.6% \nin real gross domestic product (GDP) (3.5% yearly), an implied factor of 1.72. Over the longer \nterm from 1992, traffic growth on interurban routes has averaged around 4.0%\u20134.5% per year. \nWhile GDP has been flat since 2005, the Reserve Bank of Fiji expects an upward path to be \nregained by 2010. Historic performance indicates linear rather than compound growth, and the \nmedium- to long-term growth in GDP is estimated to be 2%, and interurban normal traffic growth \n3.5% (linear). The HDM model requires the use of compound growth rates, which can be \napproximated by providing for 3.5% growth to 2018 and 3% thereafter. \n \n19.  Generated  Traffic.  The  original  FRUP  III  feasibility  study  established  the  traffic \ngeneration effects of upgrading sections of Kings Road from gravel to seal. Traffic increases \nafter completion measured at six sites varied from 28% to 92%, with a general relationship of \n50% growth for light traffic and 5% for heavy traffic for road lengths over 10 km. The evidence is \nstill valid and in some respects may be a conservative estimate, as the Subproject will provide \nthe missing link to complete the sealing of Kings Road. In particular, it is not possible to \ndistinguish between heavy and light vehicles in generated traffic growth: both respond strongly \nto upgrading. A 50% rate of growth in normal traffic levels after implementation has therefore \nbeen  used. Agricultural  development  traffic,  the  economic benefits of  which are  evaluated \nthrough the producer surplus approach, is additional to this generated traffic.  \n \n20.  Diverted Traffic. Traffic levels on Kings Road, measured at Vunidawa Junction, have \nvaried between 100 vpd and 200 vpd as far back as the 1970s. Traffic has increased and \ndecreased in response to economic conditions and to the comparative attractiveness of Kings \n ", "  Appendix 7  35  \nRoad and Queens Road as possible alternative routes for longer-distance traffic. As Queens \nRoad was upgraded in the 1980s, historic traffic counts suggest that some 60\u201380 vpd diverted \naway from Kings Road. This indicates the potential, once Kings Road is upgraded to a sealed \nstandard over its full length, for a diversion of traffic back to Kings Road for those trips, mainly \nwith one end in Suva, and destination in the north and northeast of Viti Levu. \n \n21.  The attraction back to Kings Road will come from reduced travel times, distance savings \non the upgraded road, lower vehicle operating costs, and the inherent attractiveness of a sealed \nroute over a gravel road particularly for light traffic, because of higher trip reliability and the \nabsence of loose gravel and dust, which are known drawbacks for road users, even if not \nroutinely quantified in monetary benefits. Indeed, sealing the last section, which the subproject \nwill achieve, is likely to give a once-off increase in traffic specifically by making the route \nacceptable for two-wheel drive vehicles. The original FRUP III feasibility study noted that the \npoint of equidistance from Suva lies midway between Ba and Lautoka, but that Suva\u2013Ba traffic \ncurrently uses Queens Road, even with a 20 km distance penalty. The traffic that can be \ndiverted was estimated to be 82 vpd in 1995, based on traffic counts, and 120 vpd in 2008, \ntaking into account growth in the intervening period. \n5.  EIRR and Sensitivity \n22.  The discounted cash flow, net present value of benefits less costs and economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) are shown in Table A7.6. An evaluation period of 25 years has been used, \ncovering a 2-year construction period and the design life of the road before major rehabilitation. \nThe diverted traffic and producer surplus benefits are estimated for the subproject as a whole, \nand are added to the benefits to normal and generated traffic calculated on a link basis using \nthe HDM model. The EIRR is calculated to be 12.2%. \n \n ", " \n3\nTable A7.6: Economic Discounted Cash Flow for the Kings Road Subproject   6\n \n(F$ million, 2008) \n \nA\np\nVOC Savings,  Travel Time Savings,  p\ne\nby Traffic Type  by Traffic Type  Single-Lane  Producer  nd\nConstruction Maintenance Bridge  Net Benefits/  ix\nYear  Costs  Costs  Removal  Surplus  (Costs)   7\nNormal  Generated  Diverted  Normal  Generated  Diverted  Benefits  Benefits       \n \n  \nUndiscounted Costs and Benefits \n2009  (29.01)   0.00   0.00   0.00   0.00   0.00   0.00   0.00   0.00   0.00   (29.01)  \n2010  (29.01 )  0.00   0.08   0.00   0.00   0.04   0.00   0.00   0.00   0.00   (29.01)  \n2011  0.00   0.01   2.60   0.79   1.24   0.86   0.12   0.25   0.06   0.97   6.88  \n2012  0.04   0.04   2.63   0.79   1.28   0.87   0.12   0.26   0.06   1.01   7.09  \n2013  0.00   0.01   2.04   0.79   1.33   0.65   0.12   0.27   0.06   1.04   6.29  \n2014  0.00   0.01   2.64   0.79   1.37   0.85   0.12   0.27   0.07   1.08   7.19  \n2015  0.00   0.01   2.96   0.79   1.42   0.98   0.12   0.28   0.07   1.11   7.74  \n2016  0.00   0.01   3.07   0.79   1.47   1.02   0.12   0.29   0.07   1.15   7.99  \n2017  0.04   0.05   3.18   0.80   1.52   1.07   0.12   0.30   0.07   1.19   8.34  \n2018  (1.38)   0.01   2.51   0.80   1.58   0.81   0.12   0.32   0.07   1.24   6.05  \n2019  0.00   0.01   3.20   0.80   1.63   1.06   0.12   0.33   0.08   1.28   8.49  \n2020  0.00   0.01   3.51   0.80   1.68   1.19   0.12   0.34   0.08   1.32   9.04  \n2021  0.00   0.01   3.62   0.80   1.73   1.23   0.12   0.35   0.08   1.36   9.28  \n2022  0.04   0.05   3.73   0.81   1.78   1.27   0.12   0.36   0.09   1.40   9.64  \n2023  0.00   0.01   2.98   0.81   1.84   0.98   0.12   0.37   0.09   1.44   8.62  \n2024  0.00   0.01   3.80   0.81   1.89   1.27   0.12   0.38   0.09   1.48   9.85  \n2025  0.00   0.01   4.10   0.81   1.95   1.40   0.12   0.39   0.09   1.53   10.39  \n2026  (1.38)   0.01   4.21   0.82   2.01   1.44   0.12   0.40   0.10   1.57   9.29  \n2027  0.04   0.05   4.32   0.82   2.07   1.49   0.12   0.41   0.10   1.62   11.04  \n2028  0.00   0.01   3.52   0.82   2.13   1.18   0.12   0.43   0.11   1.67   9.97  \n2029  0.00   0.01   4.47   0.82   2.19   1.52   0.12   0.44   0.11   1.72   11.40  \n2030  0.00   0.01   4.75   0.83   2.26   1.64   0.12   0.45   0.11   1.77   11.94  \n2031  0.00   0.01   4.88   0.83   2.33   1.69   0.12   0.47   0.12   1.82   12.25  \n2032  0.04   0.06   5.02   0.83   2.40   1.74   0.12   0.48   0.12   1.88   12.68  \n2033  0.00   0.01   4.16   0.83   2.47   1.40   0.12   0.49   0.13   1.93   11.54  \nDiscounted Costs and Benefits \nTotal  (49.60)   0.09   18.88   4.91   9.61   6.28   0.71   1.92   0.46   7.54   0.90  \nEIRR  12.2%                 \n(  ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 7  37 \n   \n23.  EIRR sensitivity has been estimated with respect to changes in the values of some of \nthe major inputs. The switching values (the change needed in the variable to give an EIRR of \n12%) and sensitivity indexes (the percentage change in the EIRR divided by the percentage \nchange in the variable) are shown in Table A7.7. Smaller values of the sensitivity index imply \nless sensitivity to the variable. In view of the current volatility in the price of crude oil and refined \nproducts, a sensitivity test has been included for a reduction of 25% in the crude oil price, from \nUS$120 to US$90, corresponding to a 22% and 23% fall in the economic cost of diesel and \npetrol. This has an effect both on vehicle operating cost savings and on construction costs, \nalthough for vehicle operating cost savings, the change in fuel price reduces both the with- and \nthe without-project cost stream, so the net effect is relatively small. The fuel cost component of \nconstruction is estimated to be 20% of total costs, so a 22% reduction in diesel input prices \nreduces construction costs by 4.4%, assuming a competitive construction market. The net effect \nis almost neutral, a small increase in the EIRR from 12.2% to 12.5%. \n \nTable A7.7: Sensitivity Tests \nSwitching \nChange  EIRR  Sensitivity  Value \nScenario  (%)  (%)  Index  (%) \nBase Case    12.2     \nSensitivity Parameters         \n1.

An analysis of risk using numerical simulation has been carried out in which the main \nsensitivity parameters are replaced with defined probability distributions. The simulation then \nrandomly samples each variable from within these mathematical distributions and recalculates \nthe EIRR over several thousand trials, thus allowing an output probability distribution of the \nEIRR or other economic indicator to be estimated. On this basis, there is 78% probability that \nthe EIRR for the project will exceed 12%, and 98.5% probability that the EIRR will exceed 10%. \nThe assumptions made in the risk analysis are shown in Table A7.8. \n \nTable A7.8: Risk Analysis Assumptions \nParameter  Distribution  Minimum  Most Likely  Maximum \nCapital Cost  triangular  (20)%  as estimated  20% \nBase Traffic Level  triangular  (25)%  as estimated  25% \nNormal Traffic Growth  triangular  (1.5)pp  as estimated  1.5 pp \n         \n( ) = negative, pp = percentage points. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "3  8  Appendix 7 \nD.  Lodoni Road, Korovou\u2013Natovi Jetty \n \n1.  Road Links for Analysis \n \n25.  The  project  section  of  Lodoni  Road  starts  at  the  roundabout  immediately  north  of \nKorovou at the junction with Kings Road and Deepwater Road, identified as Road 23001, \nchainage 0.00, in the DNR\u2019s asset management inventory. The project section ends at km 21.33 \nat Queen Victoria School, a large secondary school about 3.7 km beyond the turnoff to Natovi \n(at km 17.69). Lodoni Road continues for a further 22 km beyond the school, providing access \nto coastal settlements. The road provides access to the interisland ferry terminal at Natovi Jetty \nat km 17.69, which supports roll-on, roll-off freight and passenger services to Nabouwalu on \nVanua Levu and Buresala on Ovalau. \n \n26.  The project section has been broken into three links for the HDM analysis, according to \nterrain and upgrading standard. The first link to km 7 includes a 2.7 km hilly section and carries \na traffic volume approximately double that measured at Natovi Jetty. The second link is mainly \nlevel to rolling terrain. Seven single-lane bridges with spans of 12\u201326 meters will be replaced \nwith new two-lane structures. \n2.  Road Geometry and Condition \n27.

Recent traffic counts \nrecorded by DNR are shown in Table A7.11 for 2000\u20132004, together with a 1-week count \nundertaken by DNR for this analysis in August 2008.

Traffic volumes on Lodoni Road are influenced by the ferry services operating from \nNatovi Jetty. When the FRUP III feasibility study was prepared, there were daily return services \nto  Ovalau  (Buresala) and  to  Nabouwalu, and a  single  service per  week  to  Savusavu, all \noperated  by  Patterson  Brothers  Shipping.  At  that  time,  ferry  services  were  estimated  to \ncontribute about 40 heavy trucks per day. Patterson Brothers continues to operate from Natovi, \nrunning  a  daily  service  to  Savusavu,  and  there  have  been  disputes  with  other  operators \nregarding berth occupancy at Natovi, which is a public facility, indicating that there will be \ncontinued strong demand for its use as a boarding point for interisland services. Completion of a \nsealed road connection is likely to enhance its attractiveness. \n \n ", "4  0  Appendix 7 \n4.  Traffic Growth and Projections \n32.  Traffic is considered in the three categories of normal traffic growth (traffic growth that \nwould occur irrespective of the Project), generated traffic (new traffic developed as a result of \nincreased activity attributable to the Project, and diverted traffic (rerouting of traffic induced by \nthe Project). \n \n33.  Normal Traffic. Traffic growth over 2000\u20132004 on Lodoni Road averaged about 6.5% \n(linear)  at  both  DNR  traffic  count  sites.  However,  a  comparison  against  the  1995  counts \nindicates that this may be a statistical aberration, and a medium- to long-term growth rate of \n3.5% similar to that for used for Kings Road should be adopted as the normal traffic growth rate. \nThe HDM model requires the use of compound growth rates, which can be approximated by \nproviding for 3.5% growth to 2018 and 3% thereafter. \n \n34.  Generated Traffic. A general relationship of 50% generated traffic has been established \nfrom other road upgrading works on Kings Road and other similar situations. This percentage is \napplied to the level of normal traffic at the end of the construction period. \n \n35.  Diverted  Traffic.  There  is  a  possibility  of  some  minor  traffic  diversion  from  other \ninterisland  ferry  routes  as  a  result  of  the  Lodoni  Road  upgrade.  However,  this  was  not \nconsidered in the original FRUP III feasibility study. The extent of the diversion is probably small \nand  dependent on ferry  operator  response,  and  so has not  been  included.  However,  the \npotential for traffic growth to be slightly above the base value has been incorporated in the risk \nanalysis. \n5.  EIRR and Sensitivity \n36.

EIRR sensitivity has been estimated with respect to changes in the values of some of \nthe major inputs (Table A7.14). In most cases, the subproject remains economically viable, i.e., \nthe EIRR remains above the opportunity cost of capital of 12%. In cases where the EIRR is \nbelow 12%, the switching values (the value needed to give an EIRR of 12%) and sensitivity \nindexes (the percentage change in the variable divided by the percentage change in the NPV) \nare shown. As with the Kings Road analysis, a test of sensitivity to a reduction in the oil price \nhas  been  included.  The  result  shows  a  marginal  increase  in  the  EIRR  due  to  the  lower \nconstruction cost, which more than offsets the reduction in vehicle operating cost savings. \n \nTable A7.14: Sensitivity Tests \nChange  EIRR  Sensitivity  Switching \nScenario  (%)  (%)  Index  Value (%) \nBase Case    15.2     \nSensitivity Parameters         \n1.

An analysis of risk using numerical simulation has been carried out in which the main \nsensitivity parameters are replaced with defined probability distributions. The simulation then \nrandomly samples each variable from within these mathematical distributions and recalculates \nthe EIRR over several thousand trials, thus allowing an output probability distribution of the \nEIRR or other economic indicator to be estimated. On this basis, there is 90% probability that \nthe EIRR for the Project will exceed 12%, and 99.5% probability that the EIRR will exceed 10%. \nThe assumptions made in the risk analysis are shown in Table A7.15. \n \nTable A7.15: Risk Analysis Assumptions \nMinimum  Maximum \nParameter  Distribution  (%)  Most Likely  (%) \nCapital Cost  triangular  (20)  as estimated  20 \nBase Traffic Level  triangular  (25)  as estimated  25 \nNormal Traffic Growth  triangular  (1.5) pp  as estimated  1.5 pp \npp = percentage points. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090225125815Z", "Subject": "RRP: FIJ 28261", "Author": "R.
