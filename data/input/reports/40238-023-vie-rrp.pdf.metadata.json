The project will be carried out in Viet Nam\u2019s Central Highland \nprovinces  (CHPs)  of  Dak  Lak,  Dak  Nong,  Gia  Lai,  Kon  Tum,  and  Lam  Dong  over  5  years.3 It \ndirectly  supports  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  National  Target  Program  for  New  Rural \nDevelopment, 2010\u20132020 (NRD) with activities based on the socioeconomic development plans \n(SEDPs)  of  the  participating  provinces.  It  supports  the  National  Water  Resources  Strategy \n(NWRS),  2006\u20132020,  for  which  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  playing  a  major  role  in \nrevising and updating water resources policy and strengthening water sector institutions.4  \n                         \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nHigh  rates  of  rural  poverty.  The  majority  (about  71%)  of the  CHP  population lives  in \nrural  areas  where  the  primary  income  source  is  farming.  While  poverty  has  been  reduced \nnationwide from 18.1% in 2002 to 10.7% in 2010, in the CHPs in 2010, the average poverty rate \nwas  22.2%.  Contributing  factors  are  difficult  terrain,  and  hence  inaccessibility,  and  the  lack  of \ncommercial  opportunities,  social  services,  and  arable  land  in  some  of  the  areas,  compounded \nby  deteriorated  PRI.  Poverty  rates  in  some  isolated  areas  of  the  CHP  are  70%\u201380%  among \nethnic  minority  people,  who  represent  between  21%  and  53%  of  the  provincial  populations.5 \nWomen, especially those of ethnic minorities, tend to account for higher poverty rates than men.  \n \n4. \nTo upgrade underdeveloped or outdated PRI that constrains agricultural and rural \nproductivity. Less than 11% of arable land in the CHP has irrigation infrastructure and much of \nit  is  performing  poorly  because  of  age,  under-engineered  for  current  use,  limited  funding \navailable  for  new  investment,  and  a  historically  limited  capacity  for  asset  maintenance.  Viet \nNam\u2019s  record  of  poverty  reduction  has  been  driven  by  agricultural  reforms  facilitated  by  good \naccess  to  infrastructure.6 Viet  Nam  has  gained  an  important  position  in  the  global  agricultural \nmarket, particularly coffee, pepper, and rice. More effective PRI will greatly increase production \nof these  products. The project  will  improve PRI to enable  optimal  agricultural  output,  diversity, \nand  production  efficiency.  This  is  also  expected to  allow  quicker  and  safer  access to  markets, \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  term  PRI  refers  to  infrastructure  that  helps  improve  agricultural  production  through  irrigation  (reservoirs, \n\ncanals, water management and control structures) and access (rural roads and bridges). \n\n3   The CHPs have a combined area of 5.46 million hectares (ha)\u2014of which 1.64 million ha are arable, including 0.18 \n\nha with irrigation\u2014and a population of 5.28 million, of whom 3.75 million live in rural areas. \n\n4  ADB assistance has been provided since the mid-1990s through several sector loans and technical assistance (TA) \nprojects, most recently:  ADB. 2012.  Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the \nRiver Basin Water Resources Management and Development Project. Manila; ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to \nthe  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Water  Sector  Review.  Manila;  and  ADB.  2005.  Report  and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam \nfor the Central Region Water Resources Project. Manila.  \n\n5   In Viet Nam, the officially preferred term for indigenous people is ethnic minority people.  \n6  Year round irrigation can increase CHP rice yields from 4 tons per hectare (t/ha) to more than 8 t/ha annually. \n\n\femployment  opportunities,  and  social  services.  Simultaneously,  it  will  lower  the  costs  of  rural \nproduction and marketing, and reduce food wastage during transport and handling. PRI in good \ncondition  will  increase  incomes  from  on-  and  off-farm  employment,  lessen  the  work  burden  of \nwomen, and boost food availability. The project is pro-poor, will increase food security as well as \nland and water resource productivity, all of which strengthen climate change resilience.7  \n \n5. \nThe  project  advances  three  key  NRD  priorities:  (i)  to  extend  the  coverage  of  PRI \ndevelopment  to  the  CHPs;  (ii)  to  improve  PRI  sustainability  by  concentrating  investments  in \nselected  productive  areas  and  using  appropriate  designs  to  enable  sustainable  management \nand  boost  climate  change  resilience;  and  (iii)  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  stakeholders  to \nsustainably develop, manage, operate, and use PRI.8  \n \nImmediate  needs  of  the  CHPs.  In  consultation  with  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and \n6. \nRural  Development  (MARD)  and  the  CHPs,  28  candidate  subprojects  from  the  provinces\u2019 \nSEDPs  have  been  screened  for  possible  inclusion  in  the  project  and  were  found  to  meet \nagreed-upon eligibility criteria for preliminary technical, financial, economic, environmental, and \nsocial  considerations.  Feasibility  studies  were  carried  out  in  three  representative  subprojects \n(RSPs),  with  positive  results  led  by  substantial  increases  in  farm  incomes,  including  for  poor \nfarmers,  from  both  higher  production  and  employment. 9  The  other  subprojects  have  been \nprioritized  and  will  be  subject  to  feasibility  studies  during  implementation.  Available  funding \nsuggests that 15 to 18 subprojects will be implemented using ADB loan proceeds.  \n \n7. \nThe  project  has  innovative  technical  and  implementation  features  that  highlight \nADB\u2019s  value  addition  to  the  sector.  Four  technical  features  that  contribute  to  the  ongoing \npolicy  dialogue  on  water  resource  management  in  general  and  irrigation  sustainability  in \nparticular  are:  (i)  strengthening  of  dams  and  reservoirs  that  are  the  backbone  of  irrigation \nsystems in the CHPs but are now aging and likely to become increasingly unstable, especially \ngiven the predicted stresses associated with climate change\u2014it is anticipated that this initiative \nwill  lead to  an  expansion  of future  investments  in reservoir  stability;  (ii)  in conjunction  with the \ndam and reservoir improvements, establishment of community-based danger warning systems; \n(iii) integration of soil and water conservation measures into PRI design through bioengineering \ntechniques10\u2014this will improve the environs in the subproject areas and the stability of PRI; and \n(iv) research and demonstration of approaches to better irrigation and water management in the \nCHPs,  which  will  be  essential  for  coping  with  more  extreme  weather.  A  new  implementation \nfeature is the provision of startup consultants to support project implementation activities while \nthe loan implementation consultants are recruited, thus avoiding early implementation delays. \n \n8. \nMeeting national and provincial priorities. The central government\u2019s SEDP for 2011\u2013\n2016,11 the  NRD,  and the  NWRS  prioritize upgrading  PRI to serve the  dual  objective  of  social \nand  economic  development.  This  includes  improving  irrigation  for  rural  water  supply,  double \npaddy cropping, and the expansion of irrigated areas for cash crops. It also includes developing \n\n                                                \n7   ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic \n\nof Viet Nam for Productive Rural Infrastructure Development in the Central Highlands. Manila. \n\n8   A sector modality is proposed, as it directly supports the NRD to meet the priority development needs of the sector. \nThere  is  demonstrated  institutional  capacity  to  implement  the  sector  development  plan,  and  it  follows  the \nexperience in three previous and ongoing PRI development projects financed by ADB. The policies applicable to \nagriculture and rural development are appropriate and will be improved through the proposed project. \n\n9   Subprojects are Ea Kao in Dak Lak, Tan Son in Gia Lai, and Kon Trang Kla in Kon Tum. \n10   The  project  will  cooperate  with  ADB  2012.

In Viet Nam it is demonstrated that the poor gain the \nmost  by  better  access.  There  are  two  ongoing  ADB-supported  PRI  projects\u2014Integrated  Rural \nDevelopment  Sector  Project  in  the  Central  Provinces  and  Sustainable  Rural  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Project in Northern Mountain Provinces. Lessons were incorporated from these as \nwell  as  six  successfully  completed,  MARD-implemented,  and  ADB-supported  PRI  projects, \nparticularly the Rural Infrastructure Sector Project. It builds upon the successful ADB-supported \ninterventions  in  water  and  irrigation  development  and  management,  notably  the  Second  Red \nRiver Basin Sector Project, which helped formulate Viet Nam\u2019s law on water resources and train \nthe  irrigation  and  drainage  management  companies  (IDMCs),12 and  the  Central  Region Water \nResources Project (footnote 4), which helped develop successful institutional models for IDMCs \nand  water  user  organizations  (WUOs).  The  project  complements  investments  in  poverty \nreduction being made in the CHP by the development partners.13 \n \n9. \nThe  project  design  is  based  on  (i)  a  recognized  demand  to  rehabilitate  and  upgrade \npriority  PRI  to  improve  socioeconomic  conditions  in  the  CHPs;  (ii)  government  and  ADB \nstrategies  of  providing  PRI  as  a  means  to  reduce  poverty  as  described  in  the  government\u2019s \nSEDP and NRD, as well as ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy;14 and (iii) the successful design, \nimplementation experience, and lessons from related past and ongoing ADB-funded projects, in \nparticular the need to (a) prescreen subprojects for prima facie viability with minimal safeguard \nissues; (b) limit the geographic coverage to obtain a good balance between capital investments \nand overhead costs, as well as contain implementation weaknesses at a manageable level; (c) \nconfine  activities  to  those  that  can  be  readily  carried  out  within  local  capacities;  (d)  carefully \nprepare the procurement plan to optimize contract size, number, and methodology; and (e) take \nadvance  actions  to  ensure  that  competent  counterpart  project  staff  are  assigned  and  trained, \nand prepare procurement packages to reduce implementation delays.  \n   \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe impact of the project will be increased rural incomes and sustained livelihoods in the \nCHPs. The outcome will be improved rural and agricultural productivity with improved access to, \nand use of, water, materials, knowledge, production inputs and markets. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \nThe  project  will  have three main outputs:  (i)  improved  PRI  with  activities carried  out  by \nimplementing subprojects, including (a) civil works to improve irrigation infrastructure in at least \n15 schemes;15 (b) construction of rural roads to support the mobility and transport needs of the \npopulation in and around the irrigation schemes; and (c) creation of jobs during civil works that \nbenefit local people, including women and ethnic minorities;16 (ii) enhanced capacity to develop, \nmanage,  and  use  PRI,  with  activities  in  all  subprojects  including  (a)  training  on  project \nimplementation  management;  (b)  preparation  of  condition  inventories  and  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) plans; (c) training of staff at MARD, equivalent agencies in the CHPs, and \nIDMCs; (d) in-service training to upgrade the formal qualifications of PRI managers; (e) training \nof PRI users to best use the upgraded PRI; (f) campaigns to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS, and \nof road and water reservoir safety; and (g) special PRI studies, pilots, and demonstrations; and \n\n                                                \n12 ADB. 2012.

The  vice  chairperson  of  each  PPC  will  have  overall  responsibility  for \nimplementation coordination in his or her province. Each PPC will act through its department of \nagricultural  and  rural  development,  which  will  establish  a  PPMU  responsible  for  province-\nspecific, day-to-day project management. A sub-account will be established for each PPMU.  \n \n18. \nIn the communes, the project will coordinate closely with the local administrations, using \nthe  commune  people's  committees  as  points  of  liaison.  The  PPMUs  will  work  closely  with \n\n                                                \n18  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 MARD shall provide qualified counterpart project staff who will be dedicated full-time to the project.  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\ncommune  personnel  who  will  ensure  coordination  of  day-to-day  activities  between  the  project \nand  commune  authorities.  These  activities  will  include  organizing  public  consultations  and \ndesign  and  implementation  monitoring  by  commune  supervision  boards. 20  The  boards  are \nalready supported by regular budget allocation from the districts.  \n \n19. \nSubprojects  will  be  implemented  in  three  phases:  (i)  the  three  RSPs  prepared  under \nproject preparatory technical assistance (TA) will start right upon loan effectiveness; (ii) the two \ntop priorities for the provinces of Dak Lak, Gia Lai, and Kon Tum, and the three top priorities for \nthe  provinces  of  Lam  Dong  and  Dak  Nong  will  start  as  soon  as  the  feasibility  studies  are \ncompleted (after about 1 year); and (iii) the remaining subprojects will be implemented after all \ncontracts  are  tendered  and  their  funding  is  verified.  All  subprojects  will  be  subject  to  pre-\nimplementation  feasibility  studies  according  to  the  following  criteria:  (i)  the  subproject  is \ntechnically  feasible  with  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  above  12%; 21  (ii) \nprocurement packages are in conformity with the procurement plan, cost estimates  are clearly \nidentified  and  recorded,  and  all  sources  of  funding  have  been  confirmed;  (iii)  the  feasibility \nreport contains a detailed financing plan for O&M; (iv) public hearings on subproject proposals \nare  conducted  in  the  communes  concerned,  and  measures  for  future  public  consultation  and \nsupervision by the commune supervision boards are clearly spelled out; (v) the subproject has \nno major negative environmental or social impacts, and mitigation measures have been defined \nfor minor impacts;22 (vi) the subproject has no significant resettlement impacts and, for category \nB subprojects, a resettlement plan has been prepared in accordance with agreed Government \nof Viet Nam and ADB policies; and (vii) the subproject has no significant ethnic minority impacts \nand, where necessary, ethnic minority development plans will be prepared. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical  \n\nThe  subprojects  involve  the  rehabilitation,  upgrading,  repair,  and  strengthening  of  PRI. \n20. \nThe technology for undertaking such works is within the capacity of the provincial government \nagencies  assigned  to  implement  them.  The  civil  works  design  will  be  based  on  appropriate \nstandards  to  ensure  sustainability.  This  will  entail  the  use  of  high-standard  designs  (such  as \nconcrete  roads)  and  the  latest  available  technologies  for  improving  water  storage  and  control \nstructures.  It  will  also  involve  stabilizing  the  environs  around  the  PRI  through  soil  and  water \nconservation  measures.  The  capacity  building  component  focuses  on  O&M  and  includes \ntraining for the end users of the upgraded infrastructure, with an asset management initiative for \nincluding  reservoir  engineering,  repair  and  maintenance.  Provincial \nirrigation  schemes \ngovernments  will  ensure  the  availability  of  O&M  funds  as  part  of  the  feasibility  screening  and, \nwhere relevant, will register the road improvements with the provincial departments of transport \nto ensure inclusion in maintenance programs. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nBenefits  from  PRI  improvements  include  more  agricultural  productivity  along  with \nreductions in travel costs and times, while indirect benefits include the diversification of income \nsources,  greater  diversification  of  market-oriented  agriculture  output,  and  more  value-added \nproduction. Indirect benefits also include broader access to health and education services, and \nlower costs of inputs and household commodities, all leading to better socioeconomic conditions \n                                                \n20 The commune supervision boards will include at least one women\u2019s representative. \n21 An EIRR of 10% is acceptable if a significant level of unquantifiable benefits is documented. \n22 Subprojects with any safeguard classification of A will be excluded. \n\n\fin  beneficiary  communities.  Analysis  of  the  RSPs  indicates  that  PRI  improvements  will  allow \ncrop diversification and adoption of high-value crops, and estimates are that annual incremental \nproduction attributable to the RSP investments will be in the range of 4,390 tons - 9,800 tons for \nrice and 927 tons - 2,200 tons for coffee.23 As a result, incremental net crop financial value per \nhousehold will be in the range of $573\u2013$1,042 per annum. Based on quantifiable benefits, the \nEIRRs  of  the  three  RSPs  are  18.9%,  20.0%,  and  20.2%.24 The  EIRRs  are  deemed  attractive \nand  robust,  as  none  of  the  risk  factors  appears  to  place  the  subprojects\u2019  economic  viability  in \nimmediate jeopardy. The EIRRs can be used as proxies to  demonstrate the economic viability \nof the overall project since the RSP analysis will guide the evaluation of other subprojects. It is \nestimated that an average D8.8 billion per year per province (in 2013 constant prices) is needed \nto meet  the  O&M  cost  of  subproject  PRI. The fiscal  analysis  indicates  that this  is  affordable.25 \nThe project loan agreement has incorporated covenants to the effect that each PPC will allocate \na budget for O&M from 2018\u20132034, as per the whole-life asset analysis,26 and ensure that the \nIDMCs receive adequate allocations for the O&M under their responsibility.27 \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n22. \nAll procurement and recruitment of consultants to be financed by the loan funds will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to \ntime) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). MARD \nhas  committed  to  ensuring  that  all  accounts  administered  by  the  CPMU  and  PPMUs  are \nconsolidated  and  audited  annually  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  project  will  strengthen \nthe capacities of CPMU and PPMU staff in disbursement and financial management procedures \nto  allow  efficient  operation  of  imprest  and  sub-accounts,  and  the  reporting  of  financial \nperformance to the government and ADB. Implementation of the project will be consistent with \nthe  government\u2019s  requirements  for  provincial  implementation  under  national  coordination. \nWhere possible, the involvement of district and lower-level administrations and communities will \nbe  sought  to  effect  their  participation  in  design  and  construction  monitoring.  The  project  will \nestablish  a  webpage  on  the  Agriculture  Projects  Management  Board  website  to  disclose \nimplementation  progress  and  bid  notifications  and  their  results,  and  provide  a  grievance \nmechanism against corrupt practices. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n23. \nwith the government and MARD. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n24. \nThe  project  will  have  a  direct  positive  impact  on  rural  incomes  and  poverty  levels  by \nstimulating  more  agricultural  production  (both  food  and  commercial  crops),  which  in  turn  will \nincrease demand for labor and hence create jobs, reduce travel times, and lower transport costs \nfor  both  goods  and  project  beneficiaries,  and  increase  access  to  services  such  as  health  and \neducation. 28  While  the  selection  of  subprojects  arises  from  the  provincial  SEDP  process, \n                                                \n23 Using year 10 of the subproject\u2019s completion as the representative year. \n24 This is well above the economic cost of capital of 12%. \n25 The fiscal affordability analysis indicates that (i) based on the past 5 years\u2019 figures, all PPCs will be able to allocate \nsignificant budget for infrastructure investment and O&M; (ii) the required average annual budget of D8.8 billion per \nprovince is in the range of 2.0%\u20133.4% of the projected allocations. Review of past and ongoing projects suggests \nthat if the O&M budget required of PPCs is below 5%, the annual allocations are affordable. \n26 This is consistent with Decree 115/2008/NDCP as described in Table 4 under \u201cSustainability\u201d. \n27  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\ncomponents within the subprojects will be determined both by the IDMCs and the communities, \nand coordinated through the commune people\u2019s committees and WUOs. The IDMCs will see to \nit that critical infrastructure issues are solved, e.g., by repairing water reservoirs. The WUOs will \nsee  to  it  that  canals  reach  key  areas  and  that  road  access  priorities  reflect  the  communities\u2019 \nmobility and transport needs. During construction, the commune supervision board will deal with \nlocal concerns and interests.  \n \n25. \nThe  project's  gender  classification  is  \u201ceffective  gender  mainstreaming,\u201d  category  2.  To \nensure  that  benefits  accrue  to  women,  a  gender  action  plan  has  been  prepared.29 Women, \nincluding women's groups and the Vietnam Women's Union, will be consulted on infrastructure \ndesign.  There  will  be  separate  meetings  for  women,  held  at  appropriate  times  and  using \nlanguage  and  cultural  sensitivity  that  allow  women  to  participate.  The  commune  supervision \nboard will have female representation. Contractors will be encouraged to employ women in civil \nworks, and must pay men and women equally for work of equal type. The project will improve \nwomen\u2019s  decision  making  on  PRI  management  and  O&M.  PRI  training  under  the  project  will \ntake into account the needs of female farmers and target at least 40% female participation.  \n \n26. \nFunds  have  been  included  in  the  project  to  secure  the  structural  integrity  of  the \nsubproject  reservoirs  and  to  ensure  that  community-based  safety  and  warning  systems  are \nestablished and operational. To improve safety along roads to be upgraded by the project, funds \nhave  been  provided  to  undertake  road  safety  information  campaigns.  In  addition,  HIV/AIDS \nawareness campaigns will be carried out in the subproject areas. These safety and awareness \ncampaigns and systems will factor in the needs of vulnerable groups, women and children. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n27. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  Adverse  environmental  impacts  are  not  likely.  The  initial \nenvironmental  examinations  for  three  sample  subprojects  found  no  indication  of  significant \nadverse  environmental  impacts.  The  PPTA  subproject  screening  excluded  those  subprojects \nwith  potentially  serious  negative  environmental  impacts.  MARD  has  gained  environmental \nsafeguard  management  capacity  through  implementing  similar  projects.  Additional  training  for \nthe  CPMU  safeguard  staff  and  the  PPMUs  is  included  in  the  project  costs.  An  environmental \nassessment and review framework30 has been agreed to and disclosed by the government and \nADB  to  guide  environmental  assessments  and  measures  to  deal  with  potential  environmental \nimpacts.  Proper  use  of  pesticides  and  fertilizer  will  be  promoted  as  part  of  the  irrigation \nefficiency  and  management  training  to  minimize  soil  and  water  pollution.  The  paving  of  roads \nwill reduce dust, which has negative impacts on human and livestock health, crops, and safety. \nMeasures  to  improve  climate  change  resilience  include  the  stabilization  of  local  environs  by \nimproving  reservoirs  and  integrating  soil  and  water  conservation  measures  into  subproject \ndesign. Also, greater irrigation efficiency will reduce the stress on water resources.  \n \n28. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  No  significant  resettlement  impacts  are \nexpected because the majority of PRI improvements will occur along existing rights of way and \nwill mainly require compensation for roadside trees, crops, and/or small structures with possibly \na  small  amount  of  land  acquisition.  No  actual  resettlement  is  foreseen\u2014the  absence  of  major \nresettlement  issues  was  one  of  the  criteria  when  screening  subprojects  for  eligibility.  An \nindication  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  screening  is  that  the  three  RSPs  were  assessed  to  be \ncategory  C for resettlement  and did not require resettlement  plans.  The government  and  ADB \n\n                                                \n29 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Environment Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fhave  agreed  on  and  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  a  project  resettlement  framework  and \nassociated  procedures,  which  outlines  the  responsibilities  for  preparing  resettlement  plans  for \npotential  category  B  subprojects.31 The  plans shall  be  submitted  and  approved  by  ADB  before \nthe  subprojects  are  implemented.  Compensation,  allowances,  operation  and  administration \ncosts,  surveys,  monitoring,  and  reporting  will  be  financed  from  provincial  counterpart  funds. \nAdequate  provisions  will  be  made  for  preparing  and  implementing  resettlement  plans,  and  for \nengaging resettlement specialists. \n \nIndigenous  people  (category  B).  In  the  priority  subprojects  proposed  by  the  CHPs, \n29. \nethnic  minorities  were  found  to  account  for  21%\u201398%  of  the  subproject  area  population;  the \npredominant  share  being  47%.  The  minorities  will  be  among  the  main  beneficiaries  of  the \nproject. Moreover, no negative changes are envisaged in their farming and livelihood systems or \ntheir cultural practice and ancestral domains. Any possible negative impacts such as temporary \nloss of crops or crop land for construction purposes will be avoided as best as possible, or will \nbe compensated according to the resettlement plans. Impacts in these areas are expected to be \noverwhelmingly  positive  since  the  subprojects  will  be  aimed  at  overall  economic  and  social \nimprovement  of  the  population.  An  ethnic  minority  development  framework  to  manage  any \nissues  that  might  arise  has  been  agreed  to  and  disclosed  by  the  government  and  ADB.32 It \nguides  the  preparation  of  ethnic  minority  development  plans  for  potential  category  B \nsubprojects. The plans shall be approved by ADB before a subproject is implemented. As with \ninvoluntary resettlement, the three RSPs were assessed to be category C for indigenous people \nand did not require such plans. \n \n30. \nSafeguard design, review, and monitoring consultants are included in the project design \nfor all phases of implementation and, in adherence to government regulations and procedures, \nwill provide sufficient capacity and expertise to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement  (2009).  Resources  from  loan  proceeds  are  available  to  cover  the  costs  of \nimplementing ethnic minority development plans. \n\nF. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n31. \nThe  benefits  and  impacts  of the  project  are  expected  to  far  outweigh the  costs.    Major \nrisks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan.33 \n  \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nSustainability: \nInappropriate designs, \npoor-quality \nconstruction, \ninadequate O&M \nfunding, or deficient \nO&M practices may \nlead to premature asset \ndeterioration and thus \nreduce benefits. \nClimate: Catastrophic \n                                                \n31 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Indigenous  Peoples  Planning  Framework:  Ethnic  Minority  Development  Framework  (accessible  from  the  list  of \n\nMitigating Measures \nLICs will provide guidance on PRI engineering design, especially for dams and \nreservoirs, as well as oversight during construction. A significant effort will be \nplaced on ensuring sustainable O&M, including capacity building and adoption \nof institutional structures developed in earlier successful ADB projects. \nParticipating provinces have committed to provide adequate O&M funding for \nthe IDMCs. The government has recently made a commitment to improve the \nsustainability of irrigation schemes under Decree 115/2008/NDCP. \nGovernment funding is now guaranteed for the IDMCs responsible for carrying \nout O&M down to the secondary canal level.a Road improvements will use \nrobust technologies and will be registered with the responsible authorities. \nCareful attention will be paid to the planning, timing, and sequencing of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n33 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nimplementation activities, to match seasonal conditions. The use of robust \ndesigns and good construction quality control will reduce the vulnerability of the \nPRI to climatic events. In addition, soil and water conservation measures will \nbe included in subproject design to stabilize the local environment. \nThe experience and qualifications of candidates for key positions will be \nreviewed by MARD with ADB\u2019s support. LICs will provide support, capacity \nbuilding, training, and technical review, while monitoring consultants will ensure \nproject quality in terms of technical and safeguard requirements. As an \nincentive for good performance and delivery, implementation will be phased, \nrewarding better-performing provinces in the third phase with additional \nresources. \nAdvance actions will be carried out up to loan effectiveness. Thereafter, startup \nconsultants will be mobilized to provide training in ADB procurement \nprocedures and requirements, and to ensure establishment of a sound \nfinancial management system. The financial management system will be the \nsame as the one the Agriculture Projects Management Board now uses in \nongoing ADB projects. To deter corrupt practices, implementation procedures \nencourage maximum transparency, including consultation with and monitoring \nby the beneficiaries. \n\nRisks \nclimatic events interrupt \nimplementation or \ndamage the \ninfrastructure. \nTechnical capacity:  \nImplementation \ncapacities of the \nprovinces to meet all \nADB and project \nrequirements are \nlimited. \nGovernance: Limited \npublic financial \nmanagement and \nprocurement capacity \nmay impair \nimplementation \nefficiency and allow \ncorrupt practices to \ndevelop. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, IDMC = irrigation and drainage management company, LIC = loan implementation \nconsultant, O&M = operation and maintenance, PRI = productive rural infrastructure.  \na  The  IDMCs  previously  received  irrigation  service  fees  from  both  government  and  water  user  groups  to  carry  out \nO&M.
