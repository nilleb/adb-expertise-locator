I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to  India  for  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Energy  Efficiency \nImprovement Investment Program.1 The report also describes proposed technical assistance \n(TA) for Enhancing Energy-Based Livelihoods for Women Micro-Entrepreneurs, and if the Board \napproves the proposed MFF, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will \napprove the TA. \n \n2.  An adequate, better-quality supply of electric power in rural Madhya Pradesh, where \n70% of the population lives, would spur economic growth and development. In order to ensure a \ngood quality, 24-hour supply of power to rural households, the Government of Madhya Pradesh \n(GOMP) has been undertaking a distribution improvement program (feeder separation program) \nwith an approximate cost of $1,100 million. The first phase of this program is already being \nimplemented  and  the  MFF  provides  financial  assistance  to  the  investment  program  that \nconstitutes  the  second  phase.  The  investment  program  will  install  separate  feeders2 for \nhouseholds  and  irrigation  water  pumps,  install  high-voltage  distribution  systems  (HVDSs), \nprovide new power connections, install meters, map the assets of the distribution companies \n(DISCOMs),  and  undertake  network  analysis  to  ensure  better  quality  power  supply  to \nhouseholds and the financial sustainability of the DISCOMs. Of the total of 50 districts of \nMadhya  Pradesh,  the  investment  program  covers  32  districts  served  by  three  DISCOMs: \nMadhya Pradesh Madhya Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company (DISCOM-C); Madhya Pradesh \nPoorva Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company (DISCOM-E); and Madhya Pradesh Paschim Kshetra \nVidyut Vitaran Company (DISCOM-W). 3 \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Sector performance. At present, power supply lines in rural areas supply power for \nboth agricultural pumps and other customers. This mixed rural distribution network faces several \nproblems: the overuse of subsidized electricity for agricultural water pumping leaves households \nwith an inadequate power supply, and the unauthorized use of electricity causes the DISCOMs \nto suffer financial losses. Aging and overloaded distribution lines and transformers result in \nexcessive technical losses and poor quality power. To prevent the overuse of electricity by \nagricultural pumps and to reduce losses, the DISCOMs switch on the distribution lines serving \nthe rural areas for a limited number of hours per day. The existing mixed-feeder system does \nnot allow power to be supplied on a 24-hour basis to households and business establishments, \nconstraining economic growth and development in rural areas. \n \n4.  To  promote  efficient  use  of  groundwater  in  agriculture  and  improve  on-farm  water \nconservation practices, the DISCOMs supply 3-phase electricity in rural areas for 8\u201310 hours \ndaily. However, this constraints economic activities and the constant (24-hour) supply of quality \npower to households. Attempted supply of one phase power, after 8\u201310-hour supply of three \nphase  power,  to  reduce  overuse  of  power  by  irrigation  pumps  by  the  DISCOMs  was  not \neffective.  Separation of power supply  lines (feeders) to agriculture and other customers is \nnecessary to ensure the 24-hour supply of power to households. Additional measures\u2014such as \ninstallation of a HVDS and metering, together with better system management practices\u2014are \nnecessary to reduce DISCOMs\u2019 technical and commercial losses. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Power supply lines from 33 kilovolts (kV)/11 kV substations in the distribution system are known as feeders. \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory TA. ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to India for \nPreparing the Madhya Pradesh Energy Efficiency Improvement. Manila. ", "2   \n5.  Policy framework. India\u2019s economy grew at an average rate of 8.5% per annum during \n2006\u20132011; the Madhya Pradesh state economy, which grew at a lower rate compared with the \nnation in the past, has grown at similar rates since 2009. This remarkable growth will be \naccompanied  by  increasing  energy  demand,  and  ensuring  energy  for  all  has  become  an \nimportant policy challenge. The Integrated Energy Policy of India, 2006, envisages the adequate \nand reliable supply of energy in a technically efficient, economically viable, and environmentally \nsustainable manner. Moreover, inclusive growth and development is a policy priority of the \nGovernment of India; in the power sector this translates into equity in power supply quality to \nrural and urban areas. The government\u2019s rural electrification program\u2014Rajiv Gandhi Grameen \nVidyutikaran  Yojana\u2014intends to  expand  power  supplies  to rural  areas  and  to  ensure  that \ndelivered services are on par with those in urban areas. \n \n6.  Guided by the National Electricity Act, 2003, GOMP undertook a broader set of reforms, \nincluding  unbundling  the  State  Electricity  Board  into  six  state-owned  companies;  tariff \nrationalization; sector financial restructuring; and significant changes in regulatory approaches, \nsuch as open access to the grid and power trading. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nsupported these policy reform efforts through a sector development program (SDP).4 To further \nconsolidate the reforms and to realize the benefits of the improved policy and institutional \nenvironment, ADB provided an MFF.5 The last tranche of the previous MFF was approved in \nDecember 2010. \n \n7.  Strategic  context.  ADB\u2019s  strategic  priorities  in  India,  as  envisaged  in  the  country \npartnership  strategy  (2009\u20132012),6 will  continue  to  focus  on  infrastructure  development  in \nenergy in the poorer states to help address interstate disparities, build capacity, and support \ninclusive growth. The country operations business plan (2011\u20132013) 7 includes the proposed \ninvestment  program  for  improving  power  supply  to  rural  households  in  Madhya  Pradesh, \nenabling the rural populations to be part of the ongoing development process. \n \n8.  Policy reforms and the investment of the Government of India and ADB improved the \nMadhya Pradesh power sector significantly, and 85% of villages have access to electricity and \n60% households in the state have formal power connections. The financial positions of the \nDISCOMs have improved, but they are not yet profitable. Average commercial and technical \ndistribution  losses  were  about  39%  in  2005,  decreasing  to  32%  in  2010,  while  statewide \ncollection efficiency increased from 88.6% in 2005 to 94.6% in 2010. Although substantial, the \nreductions  in  technical  and  commercial  losses  were  inadequate  to  make  the  DISCOMs \nfinancially viable and the prevailing loss levels are unacceptably high. Proposed investments \nare an integral part of GOMP\u2019s strategy for loss reduction and making the DISCOMs profitable.  \n \n9.  Sector road map. Distribution system improvement and installation of an HVDS were \nthe main measures taken to reduce losses under the abovementioned SDP and the previous \nMFF. These investments were undertaken mainly in urban areas. While the distribution systems \nin urban areas were supported with the HVDS and other improvements, the Government of \nIndia\u2019s rural electrification program\u2014Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana\u2014expanded \nthe power supply to rural areas. The recent expansion of the distribution network to rural areas \nwith long low-voltage lines and unmetered connections is one reason for the high average \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2001.

Country Operations Business Plan: India, 2011\u2013\n2013. Manila. ", "    3  \ndistribution losses in the state, despite the substantial loss reduction in urban areas.8 The \nproject  preparatory  TA  estimates  show  that  average  distribution  losses  in  the  32  districts \ncovered by the investment program is about 46%, much higher than the statewide average. \nGOMP\u2019s feeder separation program sets out a clear road map for distribution improvements \nwith the objective of reducing these high loses by separating feeders and installing HVDS. This \nwill enable the DISCOMs to ensure a 24-hour supply of good quality power to households and \nother customers in the villages. Irrigation pumps will receive a preannounced supply of 3-phase \npower for 8 hours. \n \n10.  An Independent Evaluation Department (IED) study9 on the SDP (footnote 4), concludes \nthat regulatory and institutional reforms should be combined with accountability measures and \nincentives to improve operational performance in the Madhya Pradesh power sector. Its follow-\nup actions emphasize the importance of the restoration of financial viability, accountability, and \nimproved  operational  performance  of  power  sector  companies.  The  lack  of  full  financial \nautonomy of the DISCOMs has been recognized as a barrier to improvement by the companies \nof their financial positions and operational performance. Among other measures, the IED report \nalso recognizes the importance of the ongoing investments under the Revised Accelerated \nPower Development and Reform Program, installation of a HVDS, and feeder separation to \nreduce distribution losses, which is vital for the sector\u2019s financial sustainability.  \n \n11.  Multitranche financing  facility. The ongoing feeder separation program in Madhya \nPradesh  needs  flexible  financial  support  to  achieve  its  long-term  objectives.  The  MFF \nrepresents a slice of long-term contract packages of an investment program. The investment \nprogram is supported by necessary MFF elements, such as a policy framework, strategic vision, \nand sector road map together with a detailed investment plan. GOMP preferred an MFF rather \nthan a project or a sector loan mainly because of the successful implementation of the previous \nMFF. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The investment program\u2019s broader long-term impact would be inclusive economic growth \nin rural areas of Madhya Pradesh through access by households to a continuous, higher-quality \nelectricity supply. The measurable impact in the short term would be the 24-hour supply of \nhigher-quality electricity to rural households in Madhya Pradesh. The investment program\u2019s \noutcome would be improved operational efficiency in electricity distribution in rural areas of \nMadhya Pradesh. \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.  The  investment  program  will  deliver  five  components:  (i)  separate  power  supply  to \nfarmers and households through feeder separation,  (ii) installation of HVDS, (iii) upstream \nimprovement of 33 kilovolts (kV) systems, (iv) supply quality improvements and metering, and \n(v)  enhancement  of  energy-based  livelihoods  for  women  micro-entrepreneurs. 10  Feeder \nseparation work will provide dedicated new 11 kV supply lines and rehabilitate old lines to \nhouseholds or farms. Installation of an HVDS includes installation of 11/0.433 kV distribution \ntransformers in new locations closer to the households, conversion of low-voltage lines to 11 kV \nlines, and upgrading the existing low-voltage lines with aerial bundle cables. The upstream \nimprovements in the 33 kV network require new 33 kV lines, upgrading of or new 33/11 kV \nsubstations, and installation of 33/11 kV transformers. The supply quality improvement and \nmetering  component  will  provide  new  connections  and  meters,  and  undertake  overall \n                                                \n8  In some urban areas where illegal use of electricity is widespread, the introduction of an HVDS has reduced losses \nfrom 70% (2009) to19% (2010) according to case studies conducted by DISCOM-C. \n9  ADB. 2011.

This component will fully utilize the resources provided by the previous MFF 11 for \ncomputerized system management and related capacity building. The social and gender outputs \nof the investment program include: improving access to business development services for up \nto 20,00012 microenterprises headed by women across 32 districts, capacity building for up to \n1,000 women\u2019s self-help groups across 32 districts to deliver these business development \nservices, and awareness building regarding household-level energy conservation and efficient \nelectricity use. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n14.  GOMP plans to undertake approximately $1,100 million in investments under the feeder \nseparation program. The first phase of the feeder separation program is being implemented, at \na cost of about $544 million, and the second phase will cost $556 million. The government has \nrequested up to $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the second-\nphase investments. The investment program is expected to have two tranches, subject to the \ngovernment\u2019s  submission  of  periodic  financing  requests;  execution  of  loan  and  project \nagreements; and fulfillment of terms, conditions, and undertakings set forth in the framework \nfinancing agreement. The indicative investment plan for the investment program includes two \n$200  million  tranches.  The  two  tranches  will  have  same  project  components  except  that \nimprovement in 33 kV systems is only in tranche 2. \n \n15.  The indicative investment plan for the program is in Table 1. The first tranche of $200 \nmillion will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, and an annual interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions as set \nforth in the draft loan and project agreements. Interest and other charges during construction \nare estimated to be $4.89 million. ADB loan proceeds in each tranche will be made available by \nthe central government to GOMP on terms and conditions consistent with Indian legislation and \nacceptable to ADB.  \n \nTable 1: Indicative Investment Plan of the Program  \n($ million) \n                     Amount \nItem    MFF  Tranche 1 \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The three electricity DISCOMs (para. 2) will serve as the executing agencies for the \ninvestment program. All three DISCOMs have established project management units (PMUs) for \nimplementation  of  the  previous  MFF  and  these  units  will  continue  their  roles  under  the \ninvestment program. These PMUs have been fully operational and have substantial experience \nin ADB project implementation as demonstrated by their good performance in implementation of \nthe  previous  MFF.  During  implementation,  the  PMU  will  conduct  day-to-day  project \nmanagement  including  procurement,  construction  supervision,  inspection  and  testing  of \nequipment,  payments  to  contractors,  and  monitoring  and  reporting  of  progress.  The  PMU \nmanager will report directly to chairmen and managing directors of the DISCOMs. \n \n18.  A  coordinating  committee  comprising  the  chairmen  and  managing  directors  of  the \nexecuting agencies will be established by the Energy Department to monitor and coordinate the \noverall implementation of the investment program. This committee will coordinate between the \nexecuting agencies, ADB and the Department of Economic Affairs on substantial issues related \nto the implementation of the investment program. At the state level, the Energy Department \nmonitors  the  implementation  of  power  sector  investments.  The  Madhya  Pradesh  Energy \nRegulatory Commission monitors the performance and improvements in service delivery of the \nexecuting agencies at the state level. At the central level, the Ministry of Power oversees the \nstate sector policy and investment program implementation. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  August 2011\u2013August 2014 \nEstimated completion date  28 February  2015 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Coordinating Committee \nSecretary, Energy Department, GOMP -  chair \nAdditional secretary, Energy Department, GOMP \nDeputy secretary, Energy Department, GOMP \nCMD, DISCOM-C, CMD, DISCOM-E, and CMD, DISCOM-W \n(ii)  Executing agencies  DISCOM-C, DISCOM-E, and DISCOM-W \n(iii)  Implementation unit  DISCOM-C, PMU, 11 staff, DISCOM-E, PMU, 11 staff, and DISCOM-W, \nPMU, 11 staff \nProcurement  All works and goods to be financed under the MFF will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from \ntime to time) \n ", "6   \nAspects  Arrangements \nConsulting services  All consultancy services to be financed under the MFF will be selected and \nengaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to tome) \nRetroactive financing and/or advance  Under each tranche, ADB may, subject to its policies and procedures, allow \ncontracting  on request (i) advance contracting, and (ii) retroactive financing of up to \n20% of the proposed individual loan for eligible expenditures incurred prior \nto loan effectiveness but not earlier than 12 months before the date of \nsigning of the related legal agreement. \nDisbursementa  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CMD = chairman and managing director, DISCOM-C = central zone distribution \ncompany, DISCOM-E = eastern zone distribution company, DISCOM-W = western zone distribution company, GOMP \n= Government of Madhya Pradesh, MFF = multitranche financing facility, PMU = project management unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n19.  Capacity development TA in the amount of $1,100,000 equivalent is proposed to be \nprovided to enhance the business opportunities for female micro-entrepreneurs resulting from \nthe availability of power on a 24-hour basis. The TA will train women micro-entrepreneurs and \nwomen\u2019s self-help groups as trainers and business service providers, and build gender-sensitive \nawareness of power use and energy conservation. ADB will provide TA not exceeding the \namount  of  $1,000,000  equivalent  and  GOMP  will  provide  $100,000  equivalent  as  in-kind \nsupport. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special \nFund (TASF\u2013other sources). A national nongovernment organization (NGO) will be recruited by \nADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). About 14 person-months of international consultant inputs and 35 person-months \nof national consultant inputs will be provided by the NGO to implement the TA. The NGO will be \nselected in accordance with ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection method using a quality \ncost ratio of 80:20 and a simplified technical proposal. The terms of reference for consultants \nare set out in the facility administration manual (FAM).13 \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n20.  The  investment  program  uses  an  effective  technical  solution  to  reduce  overuse  of \nsubsidized power for irrigation water pumping in order to ensure a 24-hour supply of power to \nhouseholds. The same technology has been used in feeder separation projects in other states \nin India and these projects have demonstrated that this technical solution is effective and has \nresulted in significant economic and social benefits. For example, a feeder separation project \nmade a 24-hour supply of power available to rural household in Gujarat, which resulted in a \nvibrant rural economy with higher employment, better educational opportunities for children, \nmany positive impacts on women, and a boom in rural industries. The overall impact of the \nfeeder separation in Gujarat on the agriculture sector has also been positive. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  The investment program is expected to benefit 2.68 million households in terms of \nproviding a good quality power supply on a 24-hour basis. It will also provide 1.3 million new \npower connections. The investment program therefore enables a large number of households to \nimprove  their  economic,  commercial,  educational,  and  entertainment  opportunities.  The \nadditional benefits of the investment program include potential water conservation and reduction \n                                                \n13 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

The feeder separation allows the efficient use of subsidized power by \nwater pumps. Given that there is a large potential for on-farm water conservation, water use can \nbe reduced without affecting crop productivity.14 The separation of agricultural and household \nfeeders allows agricultural consumers to be supplied during nonpeak hours, reducing peak \npower demand. The investment program\u2019s energy efficiency improvements also result in an \nestimated carbon emission reduction of 920,00015 tons per annum, and an estimated 1,100  \ngigawatt-hour power savings per annum. \n \n22.  The economic viability of the project was assessed by incorporating the benefits of \ntechnical loss reduction and associated energy savings, incremental consumption due to the 24-\nhour  supply  of  power  and  new  connections,  and  reduced  transformer  failures.  Using \nconservative benefit assumptions, the tranche 1 economic internal rate of return is estimated to \nbe 20.6%. The sensitivity analysis shows that returns are robust against the main risk factors. \nThe willingness to pay for 24-hour power supply for households, estimated using a stated \npreference  survey, 16  indicates  that  household  benefits  are  substantial;  incorporation  of \nwillingness to pay in the economic analysis provides a much higher economic internal rate of \nreturn.  \n \n23.  The financial viability assessment of tranche 1 was undertaken considering reduced \nelectricity  purchases  arising  from  the  reduction  in  network  losses,  additional  sales  due  to \nextending  the  supply  hours  of  electricity  to  rural  consumers,  and  conversion  of  informal \nconnections  to  formal  connections.  The  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  was  calculated \nfollowing ADB guidelines. The financial internal rates of return were estimated for the three \nDISCOMs separately, and all exceed the weighted average cost of capital of 3.5%. Tranche 1 \nprovided a financial internal rate of return of 15.4%, which clearly demonstrates the financial \nviability of the project. The financial management assessment shows that the current financial \nposition of the three DISCOMs is not impressive. None of the companies currently make profits \nand their debt situation is also not healthy. The business plans of the companies forecast profits \nin 2015. Anticipated loss reductions due to ongoing and proposed investments and better \nfinancial  management  are  expected  to  result  in  improvements  in  the  companies\u2019  financial \npositions. \n \nC.  Governance \n24.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  GOMP  and  the  DISCOMs.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, implementation of the projects under the MFF shall adhere to \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy. ADB reserves the right to review and examine, directly or through \nits agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to projects \nunder the MFF. In this regard, investigation of government officials, if any, would be requested \nby ADB to be undertaken by the government. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents. In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of the DISCOMs and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the projects under the MFF. Financial \ninstitutional  and  corporate  governance  assessment  undertaken  as  part  of  the  financial \n                                                \n14 A similar feeder separation in Gujarat has resulted in the reduction of power use for groundwater pumping by an \nestimated 37%. \n15 Feeder  Separation  and  High-Voltage  Distribution  Systems  (accessible  from  the  list of  linked  documents  in \nAppendix 2). \n16  Assessment of Willingness to Pay for 24-Hour Power Supply in Madhya Pradesh (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "8   \nmanagement assessment shows that effective measures recommended under the previous \nMFF are in place for good governance. The specific requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the FAM (footnote 13).  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n25.  The power sector has significant potential to contribute to economic development and \nsocial wellbeing, and is both directly and indirectly linked to poverty reduction. Stable electricity \nsupply promotes the agriculture sector and business expansion, and increases employment \nopportunities, which will have a positive impact on poverty reduction. A good quality, reliable \nelectricity supply is also a key to meeting the basic human needs of health and education. Poor \nand vulnerable consumers, as well as public utilities such as hospitals and schools, are often \nparticularly disadvantaged by an inadequate power supply, load shedding, and poor power \nquality, and will therefore benefit directly from the investment program. The investment program \nis  expected  to  generate  considerable  employment  for  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  during \nconstruction. A household survey conducted by the project preparatory TA consultant shows \nthat beneficiaries believe that availability of a 24-hour supply of power will result in children \nspending more time studying (60%), women spending less time on household tasks (30%), the \npurchase of electrical appliances to make life easier (28%), and people spending more time on \nleisure (24%).  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n26.  An environmental assessment and review framework, and a resettlement framework \nwere prepared outlining the environmental and social safeguard principles and requirements.17 \nThe executing agencies will undertake environmental and social safeguard due diligence on \nsubprojects based on the environmental assessment and review framework and resettlement \nframework and submit bi-annual reports on implementation of the environmental management \nplan and resettlement plan for subprojects. Tranche 1 is classified as category B for both \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  the  environment.  The  proposed  project  has  no  potential  for \nsignificant air, water, or noise pollution. It does not fall in the vicinity of any natural ecosystems, \nreserve forests, protected areas, and cultural sites. It has temporary minor impacts during \nconstruction  that  can  be  readily  mitigated.  An  initial  environmental  examination  and \nenvironmental management plan have been prepared for tranche 1 components based on \nselected representative subprojects sites. \n \n27.  Tranche 1 components will not require private land acquisition. Construction of new \ndistribution lines will be pole\u2013based, which will have minor temporary impacts on standing \ncrops. Tranche 2 components will have 21 new 33/11 kV substations in the DISCOM-W area for \nwhich the sites have already been identified. Most of the substations are proposed to be located \non government land. The lines under tranche 2 will have no impact on land acquisition and \nresettlement except some temporary damage to standing crops that may occur during the \nconstruction. \n \n28.  Tranche  1  is  classified  as  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  According  to  social \nassessments, no indigenous peoples are expected to be impacted by either of the investment \nprogram\u2019s projects (tranches 1 and 2). However, an indigenous peoples planning framework \nhas been prepared for the investment program. In the event of impacts on indigenous peoples, \nthe project will apply the mitigation measures provided in the indigenous peoples planning \nframework  and  the  resettlement  framework,  which  include  specific  measures  that  provide \nentitlements to vulnerable groups, including indigenous peoples. Project construction activities \nare expected to be small in scale, with the possible involvement of local people in construction \n                                                \n17 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework, and Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2).
