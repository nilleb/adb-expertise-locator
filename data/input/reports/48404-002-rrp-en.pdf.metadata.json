Specifically,  the \ninvestment  program  will  rehabilitate  and  upgrade  the  road  network  of  747  km  constituting  the \nCAREC corridors mainly in Sindh, Punjab, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.1 \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nBackground.  Located  at  the  crossroads  of  Afghanistan,  Central  Asia,  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC),  India,  and  Iran,  Pakistan  has  huge  potential  to  become  a  regional \ntransport and trade hub. It can maximize its national capabilities and resources to support trade-\nbased economic growth mainly by playing the role of a transit trade hub. However, transit trade \nthrough  Pakistan  is  still  limited  while trade remains maritime-centric,  aligned  with the  southern \ngateway  port  of  Karachi,  and  focused  on  major  global  developed  markets  like  North  America, \nEurope,  and  the  Middle  East.  Poor  transport  and  border  cross-point  infrastructure  and  costly \ntransport and cross-border services pose an obstacle to exploiting the untapped potential. \n\nPakistan  is  putting  its  effort  toward  more  land-based  regional  trade  with  neighboring \n4. \ncountries  through  participation  in  regional  programs.  In  2011,  Pakistan  joined  the  CAREC \nProgram.  Pakistan\u2019s  transport  corridors  offer  the  shortest  route  to  the  sea  for  landlocked \nAfghanistan,  Central  Asia,  and  the  PRC\u2019s  Xinjiang  province.  Pakistan\u2019s  accession  to  CAREC \nenables subregions in Asia and Europe to be virtually integrated and seamlessly connected from \nEast Asia through South Asia and Central Asia to Europe. In 2013, the CAREC transport corridors \nwere extended to Pakistan to provide Afghanistan, Central Asia, and the PRC with connection to \nthe ports of Gwadar and Karachi on the Arabian Sea. CAREC Corridor 5, extended to Pakistan \nalong  N55,  links  PRC  and  Afghanistan  to  the  Arabian  Sea  and  provides  the  PRC\u2019s  Xinjiang \nprovince and landlocked countries in Central Asia the shortest trade route through the Karachi \nPort. Improving CAREC Corridor 5 along N55 in Pakistan will enable Pakistan to realize potential \neconomic benefits from accelerated trade with surrounding countries. The CAREC Transport and \nTrade Facilitation Strategy (TTFS) 2020 endorsed by the CAREC ministers at the 12th ministerial \nconference in 2013 proposes investment projects to build the CAREC corridors in Pakistan.2 \n\n5. \nIn 2013, Pakistan and the PRC agreed to develop the China\u2013Pakistan Economic Corridor \n(CPEC)  to  improve  transport  and  energy  infrastructure  in  Pakistan  and  enhance  trade  links \nbetween the two countries. The CPEC will allow Pakistan to maximize its potential as a regional \ntransport and trade hub while enabling the PRC to integrate its western regions and neighboring \ncountries into the Silk Road economic belt initiatives. The synergy between the CAREC corridors \nand the CPEC could enable Pakistan to play the role of a regional transport and trade hub.  \n\n6. \nSector  performance.  Transport  contributes  10%  to  Pakistan\u2019s  gross  domestic  product \nand more than 6% to the country\u2019s overall employment in 2013. Upgrading Pakistan\u2019s transport \n\n                                                \n1  The MFF is included in ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: Pakistan, 2017\u20132019. Manila. ADB provided \n\nproject preparatory technical assistance. \n\n2  ADB. 2014. CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy 2020. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fsystem  is  critical  to  both  export  competitiveness  and  economic  growth.  Roads  are  the \npredominant mode of transport in Pakistan, accounting for more than 92% of passenger and 96% \nof  freight  traffic  in  2010;  total  inland  traffic  by  road  was  estimated  at  325  billion  passenger-\nkilometers (km) and 59 billion freight ton-km by rail. \n\n7. \nPakistan\u2019s road network of 263,000 km consists of 12,500 km of national highways and \n93,000 km of provincial highways, with the remainder classified as either district or urban roads. \nThe national highway network, which is less than 5% of the total road network, caters to 80% of \ncommercial traffic. The National  Highway  Authority  (NHA)  is  responsible for  national  highways \n(including  access-controlled  motorways  and  expressways),  while  provincial  and  district \nadministrators are responsible for provincial highways and district roads. Despite the high reliance \non road transport, the quality of the road infrastructure severely constrains capacity. Although the \nquality of the national highways considerably improved from continuous investments and better \nroad asset management, the overall condition is wanting\u2014only 50% of highways are assessed \nto be in good or fair condition. The condition of the provincial highways is worse than that of the \nnational highway network. Many are either permanently impassable or subject to closure during \nbad weather. \n\n8. \nSector  road  map.  The  government\u2019s  transport  sector  strategy  is  highlighted  in  Vision \n2025, which aims to establish an efficient and integrated transportation system that facilitates the \ndevelopment of a competitive economy.3 Key related targets are to reduce transport costs and \npromote \n(physical \nconnectivity),  effective  institutional  arrangements  (institutional  connectivity),  and  empowered \npeople (people-to-people connectivity). \n\ninfrastructure  development \n\nregional  connectivity \n\nthrough  enhanced \n\n9. \nVision 2025\u2019s strategic direction for promoting regional connectivity has evolved into two \nkey  regional  cooperation  and  integration  initiatives,  i.e.,  the  CAREC  Program  and  the  CPEC \n(paras. 4\u20135). In line with Vision 2025\u2019s strategic direction, the CAREC TTFS 2020 sets out the \nfollowing operational priorities: (i) development of multimodal corridor network focusing on road \nand  rail  network  development,  logistics  center  development,  and  border  crossing  points \nimprovement;  (ii)  improvement  of  trade  and  border  crossing  services  focusing  on  coordinated \nborder  management,  customs  modernization,  integrated  trade  facilitation,  and  single  window \ndevelopment; and (iii) improvement of operational and institutional effectiveness focusing on road \nmaintenance,  road  safety,  designated  rail  corridor,  and  policies  and  institutional  development. \nTTFS 2020 identifies 23 priority investment projects in Pakistan amounting to $7.7 billion. \n\nStrategic context. The country  partnership strategy  2015\u20132019 for  Pakistan  highlights \n10. \nthe focus on strengthening regional connectivity in transport and energy through ADB support for \n(i) the extension of CAREC corridors to the ports of Gwadar and Karachi, (ii) the Turkmenistan\u2013\nAfghanistan\u2013Pakistan\u2013India natural gas pipeline project, and (iii) transport and trade facilitation \nwith  emphasis  on  developing  economic  corridors  to  expand  economic  opportunities  for \ncommunities  in  surrounding  areas. 4  This  strategic  direction  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Regional \nCooperation and Integration Strategy (2006) and the Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation \nand  Integration  (2016),  which  aim  to  strengthen  connectivity  between  economies  and  raise \ncompetitiveness in connected markets.5 \n\n                                                \n3  Government of Pakistan. 2014.

Manila. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nPolicy  framework.  Through  institutional  capacity  development  and  reforms  aided  by \n11. \ndevelopment partners, NHA has become a capable road agency despite structural constraints. \nIt  managed  to  (i)  establish  the  road  maintenance  fund  and  secure  a  stable  source  of  road \nmaintenance expenditure; (ii) establish the road asset management system, which allows more \nefficient use of scarce resources; and (iii) establish the National Highway and Motorway Police, \nwhich  contributes  to  controlling  overloading  and  reducing  traffic  violations  and  accidents  on \nmotorways and national highways. Despite these achievements, sector reforms should continue, \nparticularly  for  (i)  establishing  a  national  transport  policy  together  with  NHA\u2019s  business  plan; \n(ii) enhancing the sustainability of road networks and preserving road assets; and (iii) establishing \na national policy for road safety and promoting public awareness. \n\n12. \nNational transport policy. A national transport policy is a prerequisite for the effective \ndevelopment of a sustainable and cost-effective transport system. Government efforts to develop \na national transport policy in 2008 failed because of lack of strong ownership from the top; the \ndraft  national  transport  policy  was  shelved.  In  2014,  through  policy  dialogue,  government\u2019s \ninterest  was  revived  and  in  November  2015,  ADB  approved  capacity  development  technical \nassistance for Enabling Economic Corridors through Sustainable Transport Sector Development \n($15.4 million; financed by the Government of the United Kingdom) to help develop a national \ntransport policy and master plan.6 The government will prepare the national transport policy and \nmake it endorsed by 31 December 2018. \n\n13. \nSustainability of road network and road assets preservation. In 2003 the government \nestablished  a  road  maintenance  fund,  which  was  mainly  financed  by  toll  revenue  from  the \nmotorways  and  national  highways.  Securing  a  stable  source  of  funding  for  road  maintenance \nexpenditures  (free from federal fiscal  budget  allocations that  are  usually  influenced by  political \nconsideration) enabled NHA to adequately plan and effectively prioritize maintenance needs in \naccordance with the rankings of the road asset management system. The road maintenance fund \nhas shown a consistent and stable increase each year; however, a huge backlog inherited from \nthe  past  and  exacerbated  by  repeated  heavy  floods  distorts  the  effective  use  of  scarce \nmaintenance funds. To rectify this distortion,  NHA plans to reconstruct 1,113 km of roads with \nresidual life less than 2 years through the assistance of development partners including ADB. \n\nRoad  safety.  Road  safety  is  a  serious  issue  in  Pakistan.  Inadequate  safety  design, \n14. \ninsufficient attention to safety, and inadequate traffic enforcement and driver training all contribute \nto Pakistan\u2019s poor safety record. In 2016, the government prepared a draft national road safety \nframework and action plan for national highways and motorways. With the support of road safety \nexperts engaged in 2016 under ADB\u2019s technical assistance (footnote 6), the draft framework and \naction  plan  for  national  highways  and  motorways  will  be  expanded  to  cover  the  entire  road \nnetwork in Pakistan as the National Road Safety Plan. A comprehensive road safety act will be \ndeveloped  and  a  national  road  safety  body  will  be  established  to  coordinate  and  monitor  the \nimplementation of the National Road Safety Plan. \n\n15. \nNHA\u2019s  financial  statements.  Since  NHA  was  established  as  a  corporate  entity,  the \ngovernment budgetary support for road investment has been in the form of government loans to \nNHA.  The  practice  leads  to  severe  distortion  of  NHA\u2019s  financial  statements,  accumulation  of \nunserviceable debts and accrued interests in the balance sheet, and a huge net loss in the income \nstatement  because  of  NHA\u2019s  meager  revenues  from  tolling.  With  these  distorted  financial \nstatements,  NHA  cannot  mobilize  funds  from  capital  markets  to  promote  public\u2013private \npartnership.  To  correct  the  distortion,  the  government  will  consider  (i)  equitizing  NHA\u2019s \n                                                \n6  ADB.  2015.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  Enabling  Economic  Corridors  through \n\nSustainable Transport Sector Development. Manila. \n\n \n\n\faccumulated  debt;  (ii)  revaluing  NHA\u2019s  road  assets  at  current  prices;  and  (iii)  treating  future \ngovernment support to NHA for road investment either as government equity investment or as \nproper financing modalities that NHA can absorb and reflect in its financial statements. \n\nDevelopment  coordination.  ADB  has  been  the  lead  agency  for  road  subsector \n16. \ndevelopment in Pakistan and has coordinated its activities with development partners such as the \nWorld  Bank,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  and  the  Department  for  International \nDevelopment of the United Kingdom. The collaboration of development partners was instrumental \nin overcoming previous constraints on the institutional transformation of NHA from a government \nadministration  to  a  service-oriented  asset  manager  equipped  with  an  effective  road  asset \nmanagement system. As a bilateral development partner, the PRC has taken an active role in \nroad  subsector  development  in  Pakistan  since  2010.  ADB  will  continue  to  take  the  lead  in \ncoordinating  the  different  strategies  and  interests  of  development  partners  in  Pakistan\u2019s  road \nsubsector to synergize resources and maximize their impact. \n\n17. \nLessons.  Since  2005,  ADB  assistance  has  focused  on  trade  corridors  and  regional \nconnectivity to help the government take advantage of its strategic location and act as a hub for \nregional transport. Two MFFs provided in 2005 and 2007 were designed to improve key trade \ncorridors connecting sea ports, industrial centers, and border crossing points.7 Despite the high \nrelevance  of  the  MFF,  both  MFFs  were  not  implemented  as  designed  and  left  a  considerable \nportion  of  MFF  resources  unutilized  mainly  because  (i)  NHA\u2019s  capacity  was  not  adequate  to \nmanage massive land acquisition and resettlement requirements and consequent startup delay \nfollowed;  and  (ii)  security  situation  was  beyond  adequate  control  and  cancellation  of  projects \nresulted  in  security-sensitive  areas.  NHA  has  developed  its  capacity  for  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement and established a standard timeline to complete the cycle of land acquisition and \nresettlement following the Land Acquisition Act. All tranches are designed in such a way that land \nacquisition and resettlement will be completed when contractors are mobilized so that necessary \nproject sites are handed over to the contractors on time. In the process of selecting project roads, \nsecurity risks were thoroughly assessed and security vulnerable areas were avoided. Contractors \nwill be requested to develop a security mitigation and management plan. \n\n18. \nValue added by ADB assistance. Since 1997, ADB has developed the CAREC Program \ninto a premier regional cooperation program with a clear vision anchored on partnership and a \ncomprehensive action plan  that  defines  shared priorities for cooperation.  ADB,  as the  CAREC \nSecretariat,  played  an  instrumental  role  in  defining  CAREC  corridors  in  Pakistan  in  2013. \nFrom  its  experience  in  road  network  development  in  Pakistan,  ADB  knows  transit  traffic  flow \npatterns  and  the  network  effects  the  CAREC  corridors  will  create.  ADB\u2019s  sector  road  map  in \nPakistan  will  help  the  country  become  a  regional  transport  and  transit  hub  in  line  with  the \ndevelopment of the CAREC corridors. ADB\u2019s active involvement in CAREC corridor development \nthrough  the  proposed  MFF  will  encourage  the  government  to  accord  high  priority  in  terms  of \nallocating national resources to build a seamless regional connectivity among CAREC countries. \n\n19. \nSuitability of financing modality. The MFF is a suitable financing modality that allows \nADB  to  program  its  assistance  in  line  with  the  long-term  needs  of  the  government,  especially \nsince the sector road map and policy framework including sector reform measures are clearly set \nout in the context of the CAREC Corridor development initiative and the government investment \n\n                                                \n7  ADB.  2007.

The government has \n23. \nrequested an MFF in an amount up to $800 million from ADB's ordinary capital resources to help \n                                                \n8  The government has committed itself to implement sector reform measures derived from policy framework (paras. \n12\u201315)  as  part  of  loan  covenants  and  undertakings  of  the  MFF  (refer  to  Schedule  6  of  the  framework  financing \nagreement accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n \n\n\ffinance a part of the investment program. The MFF will consist of several tranches, subject to the \ngovernment's submission of related periodic financing requests, execution of the related loan and \nproject agreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms and conditions and undertakings set \nforth in the framework financing agreement. The first tranche of the MFF will comprise a regular \nloan of $180 million, have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year,  (the  interest  and  other  charges  during \nconstruction to be capitalized in the loan,) and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft loan and project agreements. Based on the custom-tailored method, the average maturity is \n15.97 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per year.  \n\nTable 2: Summary Cost Estimates ($ million) \n\nItem \nA.

A project implementation unit will be established under \nNHA  for  overall  implementation  of  construction,  including  supervision  of  contractors  and \nsupervision consultants. A general manager will head the unit, which will have suitably qualified \nstaff including project directors and safeguard specialists. \n\n27. \nProcurement of civil works and related services financed under the investment program \nwill be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\ntime). Consulting services will be required for supervising construction and capacity development. \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). \n\nAdvance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  pursued  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \n28. \nProcurement Guidelines to facilitate project implementation. The government has been advised \nthat  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  do  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  project. \nThe project is categorized as procurement- and design-ready. The implementation arrangements \nare summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the facility administration manual.10 \n\nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2027 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2028 \nManagement \n\nArrangements \nJuly 2018\u2013December 2027 \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n(ii)  Executing agency \n\nProcurement \n\nSteering committee under NHA chair \nNHA \nInternational competitive \nbidding \n\nConsulting services \n\nConstruction \nsupervision \n\nQCBS \n(90:10) \n\nTranche 1: Two contracts for building \nan additional 2-lane carriageway and \none contract for rehabilitating existing \n4-lane road \nTranches 2 and 3 \nTranche 1: 67 person-months \n(international) and 346 person-\nmonths (national) \nTranches 2 and 3 \nBased on NHA needs assessment \n\n$149.5 million \n\n$585.3 million \n$9.0 million \n\n$18.0 million \n\nAdvance contracting and \nretroactive financing \n\nDisbursement \n\nQCBS \n(90:10) \nQCBS \n(90:10) \n\nBased on NHA needs assessment \n\nDue diligence \nadvisory services \nAssistance with \nproject \nimplementation \nAdvance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  for  goods,  works,  and  consulting \nservices.

The  additional  carriageway  including  the  shoulders  will  be  benched  into  the \nexisting  width  and  pavement  layers  constructed  and  compacted  as  per  NHA\u2019s  technical \nspecifications after checking the soil properties of pavement and shoulder.  As for rehabilitating \nthe existing four-lane carriageway for Dara Adamkhel\u2013Peshawar road, the existing carriageway \nof 14.6 m wide with 2.0 m outer shoulder and 1.0 m inner shoulder will be upgraded with a design \nspeed of 100 km/h. Climate change risks and adaptation measures were considered in the project \n                                                \n10 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\ndesign. The road embankment is sufficiently high to withstand flows of highest floods. The design \nprovides  adequate  cross  drainage  and  hydraulic  structures  (based  on  100-year  recurrence \ninterval flood discharges), which were adopted by NHA after the 2010 mega-flood. The impact of \ntemperature  on  asphaltic  pavement  layers  has  been  mitigated  by  adopting  pavement \nspecifications suitable for the climate in the project areas. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic.  An  economic  analysis  of  project  1  was  conducted  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \n30. \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.11 Costs of the project were compared against \nthe benefits of vehicle operating cost savings, travel time savings, and reductions in maintenance \nand operating costs to NHA. The analysis shows that project 1 is highly and economically feasible, \nwith an economic internal rate of return of 24.3% and a net present value of $354.0 million, at a \n9% discount rate. Sensitivity tests reveal that the project is robust against increases in cost and \ndecreases in benefits. However, the project is sensitive to changes in future maintenance regimes, \nhighlighting the importance of timely and appropriate maintenance. \n\nFinancial.  The  Road  Maintenance  Fund\u2014a  pool  of  toll  revenues,  penalties,  and  other \n31. \nfunds  provided  by  the  government  and  established  in  2003  through  the  Road  Maintenance \nAccount  Rules\u2014is  earmarked  to  finance  maintenance  of  the  entire  national  highway  network. \nThe  project  roads  will  be  maintained  under  NHA\u2019s  annual  maintenance  plan  generated  by  the \nroad  asset  management  system.  The  resources generated  by  the  road maintenance fund  are \ninsufficient to maintain roads at the quality of newly paved roads with an international roughness \nindex  (IRI)  of  less  than  2.0  m/km.  With  this  constraint,  NHA  aims  to  maintain  roads  with  an \naverage IRI of 3.5 m/km (current average is 4.0 m/km). \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\ninternal  control  systems \n\n32. \nNHA\u2019s capacity for procurement, financial management, and project implementation was \nassessed  and  found  to  be  sufficient  to  manage  international  procurement  and  maintain \naccounting systems, financial controls, and audit arrangements. Its financial accounting, auditing \nrules,  and \ninternational  practices. \nNHA maintains separate project records and accounts adequate to identify the works, goods, and \nservices financed from loan proceeds, financing resources received, expenditures incurred for the \nproject,  and  use  of  local  funds,  as  well  as  adequate  internal  controls  and  financial  reporting \narrangements. The project accounts and related financial statements will be audited annually in \naccordance with national and international auditing standards by the auditor general of Pakistan \nand by a chartered accountant. \n\nfollow  generally  accepted \n\n33. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and NHA. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the FAM (footnote 10). \n\nD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n34. \nThe Pakistan Economic Survey 2015\u20132016 reports the latest headcount multidimensional \npoverty incidence at 38.8% for 2015, with a disparity of 9.43% (urban) and 54.6% (rural). Poverty \nis  unequally  distributed  across  the  four  provinces  of  Pakistan  and  between  rural  and  urban \npopulations. The multidimensional poverty incidence for Punjab province is 31.5%, followed by \nSindh  with  43.2%,  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  with  49.1%,  and  Balochistan  with  71%.12 Areas  with \n\n                                                \n11 ADB. 2017.

Pakistan Economic Survey 2015\u20132016. \n\n\f9 \n\nlimited access to basic social amenities and off-farm livelihood opportunities have higher poverty \nincidences. Factors that affect the livelihood of the poor include (i) low literacy; (ii) lack of access \nto  employment  opportunity;  and  (iii)  exclusion  from  benefit  of  development  projects.  The  main \ndirect  beneficiaries  of  the  investment  program  will  be  agricultural  traders,  freight  forwarders, \ntransporters, commuters, and those living and working along the project road sections. Indirect \nbeneficiaries  include  large  sectors  of  the  population  who  will  gain  from  more  employment \nopportunities in trade and transport business and ready access to markets and resources across \nthe country. The local population will get employment opportunities during the construction and \noperation  phases  of  projects.  Women  will  benefit  through  improved  access  to  basic  social \nservices  such  as  health,  education,  and  social  networking  facilities.  Additional  assistance  to \nhouseholds  headed  by  women  will  be  provided  as  part  of  the  resettlement  plan.  During \nimplementation, more gender elements fit for project site situations will be devised and included \nin construction contracts. \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nResettlement. A land acquisition and resettlement framework for the investment program \n35. \nand two draft land acquisition and resettlement plans for tranche 1 project have been prepared \nbased on census and inventory of losses. Although most works will generally follow the available \nright-of-way limits, additional land will be needed to provide the required vertical and horizontal \ngeometrical improvements for certain sections and to build the 2.32 km bypass near Dakkan in \nRatodero\u2013Shikarpur road. A total of 512,737.1 m2 of agricultural land and 1,618.8 m2 of residential \nand  commercial  land  will  be  acquired.  Around  356  households  (with  2,411  members)  will  be \naffected.  Of  these,  548  persons  will  experience  significant  resettlement  impacts,  of  which \n412  persons  will  be  physically  displaced  while  136  persons  will  lose  10%  or  more  of  their \nproductive  assets.  For  the  rehabilitation  of  the  34  km  Dara  Adamkhel\u2013Peshawar  road,  no \ninvoluntary resettlement impact is anticipated as all works will be limited to the existing right-of-\nway and will not impact on any existing fixed structure within the right-of-way. The draft plans will \nbe  updated  based  on  the  detailed  design.  Project  1  is  classified  category  A  for  involuntary \nresettlement and category C for indigenous peoples safeguards. \n\n36. \nEnvironment.  Project  1  is  classified  category  B  for  environment.  An  environmental \nassessment and review  framework and draft initial environmental examinations were prepared \nand  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website.  The  project  roads  do  not  cross  or  are  not  located  near \nprotected  areas.  The  environmental  assessment  established  that  the  project  can  have  site-\nspecific  environmental  impacts  related  to  air  and  water  pollution,  noise  and  vibration, loss  of \nroadside trees, and traffic disruptions during construction. Because of construction of additional \nlanes  and  increase  in  traffic,  the  project  can  split  communities  and disrupt  farming  patterns. \nAdequate  mitigation  measures  will  be  included  in  and  implemented  through  an  environmental \nmanagement  plan.  The  project  design  will  incorporate  measures  for  preserving  community \ncohesion  such  as  improved  crossings  (underpasses  and  overpasses)  and  access  to  public \nfacilities. Public consultations were conducted in October\u2013November 2016. Overall responsibility \nfor the implementation of the plan will rest with contractors. NHA's project implementation unit will \nhire  an  environmental  and  social  officer  to  supervise  the  implementation  of  the  project\u2019s \nenvironmental safeguards. \n\nF. \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n37. \nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  5  and  described  in \ndetail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 13  The  risks  are  assessed  to  be \n\n                                                \n13 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nWeak financing \narrangements on \ndevelopment and \nmanagement of \nthe road network \nLack of \ncounterpart funds \n\nDelayed land \nacquisition and \nresettlement, and \ninadequate \nsafeguard \narrangements \n\nmanageable once mitigating measures are adopted, and the integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs of mitigation. \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe practice of providing loans to NHA to finance its development program since its creation in \n1991  undermines  the  authority\u2019s  financial  standing.  ADB-administered  technical  assistance \napproved  in  November  2015  will  help  build  capacity  and  carry  out  analytical  work  on  NHA \nbalance sheet restructuring. The government also intends to expand the toll base, rationalize \ntolls, and allocate more revenue to the road maintenance account of NHA. \nThe  government  will  accord  transport  infrastructure  as  top  priority  in  the  country\u2019s  resource \nallocation.  NHA  will  expand  public-private-partnership-based  road  construction  to  reduce  the \ngovernment subsidy and make more fiscal resources available for counterpart funding. \nNHA has started consultation, land acquisition, and resettlement compensation for the affected \npeople.  A  qualified  and  experienced  external  monitoring  agency  will  verify  the  executing \nagency's  monitoring  reports,  monitor  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  implementation, \nidentify issues, and recommend corrective measures as needed. \nNHA, assisted by the construction supervision consultant, will supervise the implementation of \nthe environmental management plan, monitor the implementation process, and regularly submit \nsafeguard monitoring reports to ADB. \nThe  new  government  is  strongly  committed  to  eradicating  corrupt  practices.  The  National \nAccountability Bureau is fully empowered to enforce the National Anticorruption Ordinance to \nprevent, detect, investigate, and prosecute cases involving corruption, corrupt practices, misuse \nor  abuse  of  power,  misappropriation  of  property,  kickbacks,  and  commissions.
