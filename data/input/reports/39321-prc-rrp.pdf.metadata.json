An initial environmental examination was undertaken. \n \n \nThe Qinling Mountains are an internationally important biodiversity \nhot  spot  and  represent  about  70%  of  the  PRC\u2019s  biodiversity, \nincluding  an  estimated  300  giant  pandas.  The  Qinling  Mountains \nare  central  to  soil  and  water  management  of  the  Yangtze  and \nYellow  rivers.  The  Project  will  improve  biodiversity  conservation \nand  management  by \nimproving \nendangered  species  management  and  providing  sustainable \nlivelihoods \nthe  project  area,  and \ndemonstrating  the  benefits  to  the  rest  of  the  Qinling  Mountains \nand  other  similar  areas  in  the  PRC.  The  Project  will  provide \nsignificant  environmental,  economic,  and  social  benefits \nthroughout the project area. It will address underlying causes and \neffects of historical and contemporary resource degradation.  \n \nThe  project  area  is  458  square  kilometers  (km2),  about  45 \nkilometers  southwest  of  Xi'an,  the  capital  of  Shaanxi,  and  is \nidentified as the birthplace of the Taoist religion. The project area \nis  divided  into  a  plains  area  for  ecotourism  and  agriculture \ndevelopment,  and  a  mountainous  area \nfor  biodiversity \nconservation. It is home to about 20,400 people. The plains have \nabout  15,800  residents  (77%  of  the  total)  who  live  on  about  58 \nkm2 (13% of the total project area) bordering the northern end of \nthe  project  area.  The  poverty  incidence  is  about  23%.  This  area \nalso includes the township of Louguantai; several Taoist temples; \nthe  Qinling  National  Botanical  Garden  (QNBG)  and  nursery;  the \nShaanxi  Animal  Rescue  Center \nincludes \nthreatened species of giant panda, golden monkey, golden takin, \nand  crested  ibis;  and  the  Louguantai  Forest  Farm.  About  71 \nmillion  tourists  visit  Shaanxi  province  annually,  of  which  about \n400,000  visit  the  project  area  and  about  1  million  visit  the\n  \n\nthe  population  of \n\n(SARC),  which \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRationale \n\nis \n\nin \n\nfor \n\nfunds \n\nthat  supports \n\nlow-impact  development \n\nthe  mountainous  area, \n\nlarger  but  scarcely  populated \nQinling  Mountains.  The \nmountainous  area  is  called  the  Qinling  Biological  Conservation \nand  Demonstration  Area  (QBCDA),  where  the  management \nobjective \nthe \nconservation  of  biodiversity  and  provides  sustainable  livelihoods \nfor about 4,600 residents (23% of total) on about 400 km2 (87% of \nproject area). \n \nThe  Project  will  produce  three  primary  outputs:  (i)  participatory \nbiodiversity  management \n(ii) \nenhancement  of  biodiversity  conservation  in  the  plains  area,  and \n(iii)  improved  project  management.  Using  sustainable  financing \nmechanisms  for  biodiversity  conservation,  the  habitat  of  the \nmountainous  area,  QBCDA,  will  be  improved  to  promote  mixed \nforest  coverage,  and  flora  and  fauna  species  expansion.  The \nsmall population lives in scattered settlements in QBCDA and will \nbe encouraged to support biodiversity conservation objectives and \nminimize unsustainable farming and other activities. \n \nThe  Project  will  develop  biodiversity-based  attractions  that  will \nthe  management  and  enhancement  of \ngenerate \nQBCDA. The commercial activities will involve a botanical garden, \nwildlife  breeding  and  research  (including  a  giant  panda  center \nsecond only to Sichuan province\u2019s Wolong Nature Reserve), and \nrelated  ecotourism.  QNBG  will  address  a  major  weakness  of  the \nmany past biodiversity projects by ensuring sustainable financing \nusing  part  of  the  ecotourism  revenue.  Links  with  the  Qinling \nMountains  nature  reserves  and  an  increase  in  biodiversity \ncorridors will be pursued. \n \nThe Qinling Mountains is biologically rich with many endangered, \nthreatened, and endemic animal and plant species that need to be \nprotected.  The  Qinling  Mountains  have  about  25  national  and \nprovincial  nature  and  forest  reserves,  many  of  which  have \nreceived  assistance  from  the  Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF), \nWorld Bank, and World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).  \n \nThe  geography  is  dominated  by  mountains,  rivers,  streams,  and \nforests.  The  major  environmental  issues  are  related  to  land  and \nenvironmental  degradation,  endangered  animals  and  plants,  the \npresence of some exotic tree species, and the need for long-term \nanimal  and  plant  species  regeneration  and  expansion  as  well  as \npreservation  management\nsustainable \nand \nincome-\ntechniques.  Other \ngenerating  opportunities  for  the  inhabitants,  the  availability  of \nfinancing  for  biodiversity  conservation  in  the  project  area  and \nQinling  Mountains,  and  basic  rural  services  in  the  project  area. \nAbout  37%  of  the  population  in  the  project  area  is  poor,  with \npoverty  increasing  markedly  from  Louguantai  south  into  the \nrugged mountain and forest terrain. \n \n\nconservation \nissues \n\ninclude  employment  and \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthe \n\n(2006\u20132010), \n\nBecause  of  the  prevailing  poverty,  the  project  area  and  nature \nreserves  in  Qinling  Mountains  are  subject  to  a  high  level  of \ncompeting  land-use  pressure.  This  is  a  major  reason  why  the \nsustainable management of biodiversity resources is important to \nthe  Shaanxi  government,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB), \nGEF,  and  WWF.  However, \nfinancial  sustainability  of \nbiodiversity  conservation  is  precarious,  because  conservation \ncannot  compete  financially  with  other  less  environment-friendly \nforms of land use. Species diversity is largely a public good, and \nthe revenue generated from ecotourism often does not cover the \ncosts  of  creation  and  management.  To  improve  the  funding \nsituation,  protected  areas  must  generate  their  own  revenue. \nBecause  of  its  favorable  location  in  relation  to  Xi'an,  the  project \narea will be able to generate revenues to cover most, if not all, of \nits operational and management costs. \n \nThe  Project  will  pursue  a  market-based  approach  to  biodiversity \nconservation,  featuring  sustainable  revenue  generation  and  use, \nalong  with  land  and  conservation  management.  Biodiversity \nconservation  is  a  high  priority  of  the  Government,  as  reflected  in \nthe  Ministry  of \nthe  11th  Five-Year  Plan \nEnvironmental  Protection\u2019s  biodiversity  strategy,  and  the  Qinling \nMountains  Ecosystem  Function  Conservation  Plan.  The  Project \nwill strengthen the management of nature reserves in the Qinling \nMountains  through  integrated  approaches,  including  market-\noriented  measures  to  sustain  environmental  and  biodiversity \nobjectives  while  increasing  rural  incomes  and  reducing  poverty. \nThe public sector is required to ensure preservation of the natural \nand cultural heritage sites in the project area. \n \nThe lessons from previous environmental projects in the PRC and \nShaanxi  province,  as  well  as  other  major  provinces  with \nbiodiversity  activities  including  Sichuan  and  Yunnan,  have  been \nincorporated  in  the  Project.  The  provincial  government  and  the \nImplementing  Agency  (IA),  QNBG,  have  strong  commitment  to \nand  ownership  of  the  Project.  All  major  stakeholders  have  been \nextensively  consulted.  Linking  biodiversity  conservation  with \nrevenue generation in the project area and the Qinling Mountains \nis  fully  supported.  The  Project  is  well  focused  in  terms  of  area \ncoverage,  and  the  outputs  are  well  defined,  closely  linked,  and \nwithin the capacities of QNBG to effectively manage. The Shaanxi \nprovincial government (SPG) has successfully implemented three \nADB-financed  projects  in  environmental  protection,  roads,  and \nrailways.  It  has  also  successfully  implemented  12  World  Bank-\nfinanced projects in forestry, water, agriculture, poverty reduction, \nand  environmental  protection.  Several  of  these  projects  are \ncofinanced  with  GEF.  Many  of  the  successful  features  of  WWF \nassistance  in  biodiversity  conservation  and  income  generation \nhave been included in the Project. \n \n\niii \n\n \n\n\fto  protect  globally-significant  species  and \n\nThe  project  impact  is  sustainable  biodiversity  conservation  in \norder \nto  sustain \neconomic  growth.  The  expected  outcome  of  the  Project  is \nimproved  and  integrated  biodiversity  management  that  provides \nsustainable livelihoods for the population of the project area. The \noutcome  will  also  be  shared  and  demonstrated  to  the  rest  of  the \nQinling Mountains. \n \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $132.64  million,  including  taxes \nand duties of $5.65 million.  \n \nA loan of $40 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided  under  its  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.15% per year on undisbursed funds, and such other terms and \nconditions  as  set  forth  in  the  loan  and  project  agreements.

SPG  will  be \nsupported by a project management office (PMO) comprising the \nProvincial  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  the  Shaanxi \nProvincial  Finance  Department,  and  the  Shaanxi  Forest  Bureau. \nThe  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  administration  and \nmonitoring of the Project. QNBG will be the IA, which consists of \nthree  divisions  for  the  Shaanxi  Qinling  Botanical  Garden,  the \nSARC, and the QBCDA. \n \nShaanxi provincial government  \n \nAll  goods  and  works  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nContracts  for  goods  estimated  to  exceed  $1.0  million  and \ncontracts  for  works  estimated  to  exceed  $10.0  million  will  be \nprocured  using  international  competitive  bidding  procedures. \nContracts  for  goods  and  works  estimated  to  cost  less  than  the \ninternational competitive bidding values, but more than $100,000, \nwill be procured through national competitive bidding procedures, \nin  accordance  with  the  PRC  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law,  1999, \nsubject  to  clarifications  agreed  upon  with  ADB.  Contracts  for \ngoods  and  works  estimated  to  cost  $100,000  or  less  will  be \nprocured  using  shopping  procedures.  The  relevant  sections  of \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  will  be \nincluded in all procurement documents and contracts. \n \nThe Project will require 84 person-months of consulting services, \ncomprising  15  person-months  of  international  and  69  person-\nmonths  of  national  experts.  These  will  be  procured  in  two \npackages. Package A, which comprises six individual consultants \nfor  1  month  each  contracted  by  QNBG,  will  be  financed  by  the \nGEF  grant.  Package  B,  comprising  78  person-months  of \nconsultants, will also be financed by the GEF grant. The PMO will \ncontract  the  package  through  a  consulting  firm  using  the  quality- \nand  cost-based  selection  method  (80:20),  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). \n \nThe  Project  targets  residents  within  the  project  area,  of  which \nabout 4,600 live within QBCDA and 15,800 in the plains area. An \nadditional  23,400  residents  within  the  immediate  fringe  of  the \nproject  area,  especially  those  close  to  the  plains  area,  will  also \nbenefit.  Within  the  project  area,  the  poverty  ratio  is  estimated  at \n37%  on  a  head  count  basis,  or  close  to  40%  on  a  household \nbasis. However, the incidence of poverty is over 70% in QBCDA, \ncompared  with  23%  in  the  plains  area.  Poverty  will  be  reduced \nthrough  (i)  the  creation  of  a  significant  number  of  jobs  during \n \n\nv \n\n \n\n\fRisks and Assumptions \n\nvi \n\n \n\n \n\nthrough \n\nimprovements \n\nconstruction,  (ii)  the  generation  of  about  1,370  full-time  jobs  by \nQNBG,  (iii)  indirect  economic  benefits  provided  to  QBCDA,  (iv) \ndevelopment  of  home-based  businesses,  (v)  development  of  10 \nhome-stay community tourism enterprises, (vi) provision of better \nmountain  pathways  and  roads,  and  (vii)  social  infrastructure \nprograms.  More  than  90%  of  QBCDA  residents  are  expected  to \nbenefit directly from the Project. The major environmental benefits \ninclude  (i)  better  welfare  of  animals;  (ii)  the  advancement  of \nscience  related  to  endangered  species  recovery;  (iii)  genetic \nspecies  collection;  (iv)  public  awareness  and  conservation;  (v) \noverall conservation of biodiversity; (vi) better ecological functions \nfrom more and higher-quality forest cover; (vii) intangible benefits \nfrom  the  conservation  of  Taoist  religious  sites;  and  (viii)  better \nenvironmental  quality \nin  sanitation, \nwastewater, and management systems.  \n \nDelays  in  construction  would  place  significant  pressure  on  the \ncash flow of QNBG. Recognizing this risk, the SPG has committed \nto  underwrite  the  cash  flow  with  counterpart  funds.  Weak \nmanagement and poor operation of the proposed investments will \nthreaten  the  financial  viability  of  QNBG,  which  is  assessed  as \nadequate  but  not  strong.  All  of  the  agencies  consolidated  into \nQNBG,  including  the  Shaanxi  Qinling  Botanical  Garden,  SARC, \nand the Louguantai Forest Farm, have many years of biodiversity \nproject  experience.  QNBG  is  well  staffed  with  experienced  and \nqualified  personnel.  The  challenge  for  QNBG  will  be  to  work \ntogether  to  effectively  manage  all  project  activities  related  to \nhabitat  restoration,  species  regeneration,  botanical  gardens, \nSARC,  ecotourism,  and  income-generating  activities  for  poor \nresidents  in  the  mountainous  and  plains  areas.  The  SPG  has \nagreed to strengthen QNBG by providing additional staff, start-up \nfunds, and sufficient staff training. QNBG will undergo institutional \nstrengthening  through  the  use  of  consulting  services,  as  well  as \nthe  recruitment  of  expert  and  experienced  staff  in  biodiversity \nconservation, \nand \nengineering. The financial sustainability of QNBG and the Project \nwill  be  ensured  through  ecotourism  revenue  generation  sufficient \nto  meet  all  projected  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  plus  the \nexpansion  of  biodiversity  conservation  activities  in  the  Qinling \nMountains. The design of the Project has factored in the potential \nrisks from invasive species and poor animal welfare by introducing \ninternational  expertise  and  limiting  QNBG  to  plant  species  from \nthe  Qinling  Mountains.

The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nShaanxi province is home to about 2.8% of the country\u2019s population, contributes about \n1.8% to its gross domestic product (GDP), and has about 2.1% of the PRC\u2019s land area (206,000 \nsquare  kilometers  [km2]).  The  rate  of  economic  growth  in  the  western  PRC  has  lagged  the \neastern  provinces.  Shaanxi  province  grew  on  average  of  about  7.5%  per  year  during  1990\u2013\n2000, compared with a national average of about 10%. When coupled with population growth, \nGDP per capita in Shaanxi is only about 60% of the national average. Since 2000, Shaanxi has \ngrown  more  quickly,  equaling  or  exceeding  the  national  average  largely  because  of  the \nimplementation  of  the  western  development  strategy  under  the  country\u2019s  10th  Five-Year  Plan \n(FYP). During 2000\u20132007, Shaanxi\u2019s GDP grew on average of about 11% per year, faster than \nthe national average; and Shaanxi\u2019s per capita GDP was about 63% of the national average. Of \nthe  31  provinces,  autonomous  regions,  and  independent  municipalities  in  the  PRC,  Shaanxi \nranks 16th in population size, 22nd in terms of the size of the economy and production base (as \nmeasured by GDP and industrial production), and 26th in GDP per capita.  \n\n \nThe capital, Xi'an, accounts for 21% of the population, but it produces more than 40% of \n3.  \nthe  province\u2019s  GDP.  The  GDP  per  capita  in  the  poorer  rural  counties  of  Shaanxi  is  less  than \n30%  of  the  national  average,  and  55  of  the  88  counties  are  classified  as  poor.  In  2008,  the \naverage annual income of Shaanxi urban residents was CNY12,858 while the per capita income \nof  the  rural  population  was  CNY3,136.  Rural  incomes  are  only  35%  of  the  $1.25  per  day \nbenchmark  for  extreme  poverty  and  about  50%  of  the  average  provincial  income.  Low  living \nstandards  and  high  levels  of  poverty  are  a  result  of  past  natural  resource  degradation  and  a \ncause  for  ongoing  degradation.  Many  of  the  counties  classified  as  poor  are  in  the  Qinling \nMountains, including Zhouzhi County where the Project is located. \n\n \n4.  \nThe success of the Shaanxi province under the 11th FYP (2006\u20132010) depends heavily \non protecting the biological and natural assets from which ecotourism products and services can \nbe developed. The main natural asset is the Qinling Mountains range, which is immediately to \nthe southwest of Xi'an and runs east-west, straddling the southern part of Shaanxi. More than \n90%  of  the  range  lies  within  Shaanxi  province,  where  it  forms  a  north-south  divide  and  is  a \nmajor  climatic  influence  on  the  northern  PRC  and  the  water  resources  of  the  Yellow  and \nYangtze  rivers.  The  southern  slopes  contribute  more  than  50%  of  the  water  stored  in  the \nDanjiangkou Reservoir on the Han River, a tributary of the Yangtze River. The northern slopes \nsupply  water  to  the  Yellow  River  system,  which  flows  to  the  dry  northern  parts  of  the  country. \nThe  Qinling  Mountain  range  is  the  most  valuable  environmental  and  biological  resource  for \nfuture biodiversity conservation in Shaanxi. \n\n \n5.  \nThe  development  of  cities  and  counties,  and  the  use  of  the  Qinling  Mountains  forestry \nand  biodiversity  resources,  began  more  than  2,000  years  ago  during  the  Qin  and  Han \ndynasties. Currently, the Qinling Mountains support about 5 million residents, or about 14% of \nthe Shaanxi population. The Qinling Mountains, which consist of a temperate broad-leaved and \nmixed forest, is a global biodiversity hot spot supporting many endangered and endemic plant \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nand  animal  species. 1 The  endangered  species  include  the  giant  panda,  the  global  icon  of \nconservation, and the only known wild population of one of the world\u2019s rarest birds, the crested \nibis (the national bird of Japan). The Qinling Mountains are characterized by very high levels of \nendemic biodiversity and a vertical spectrum of vegetation types. Of all the vegetation types in \nthe PRC, about 70% can be found in the Qinling Mountains.2 \n\n \n6. \nThe  project area  is  in  the  Qinling  Mountains,  about  45  kilometers  (km)  from  Xi'an,  and \ncovers a rural area of about 458 km2 with about 20,400 people. The geography is dominated by \nmountains,  rivers,  streams,  and  forests.  About  37%  of  the  population  is  poor,  with  poverty \nincreasing  markedly  south  of  the  plains  into  the  rugged  mountain  and  forest  terrain.  About \n15,800  people  live  in  the  2-km  strip  of  plains along  the  national  4-lane  east-west  highway  (an \narea of about 58 km2) that borders the northern end of the project area. In this area, which is \nlargely  dependent  on  agriculture,  the  poverty  incidence  is  about  23%.  This  area  also  includes \nthe small town of Louguantai; several Taoist temples (Taoism was founded here); the Shaanxi \nAnimal Rescue Center (SARC),  which includes the threatened species of giant panda, golden \nmonkey, golden takin, and crested ibis; the Louguantai Forest Farm (LFF); the Qinling National \nBotanical Garden (QNBG); and the Louguantai hot springs. Shaanxi wants to divide its tourism \nproducts  into  two  major  categories  of  attractions:  historical  and  environmental.  The  strategy \nstresses the need to increase the value of each visitor, as opposed to increasing the number of \nvisitors. It lists 10 priority-tourism developments including QNBG.3 About 71 million tourists visit \nShaanxi province annually, of which about 400,000 visit the project area and about 1 million visit \nthe  Qinling  Mountains.  Based  on  survey  results,  an  additional  4,600  people  live  in  the \nmountainous  interior,  widely  spread  out  in  several  villages  in  the  400  km2  Qinling  Biological \nConservation and Demonstration Area (QBCDA). Poverty incidence in this area is about 70%.  \n\nB. \n\n \nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nProject Area Situation \n\n1. \n \nThe key problems affecting the Qinling Mountains and the project area include (i) loss of \n7. \nbiodiversity, (ii) low incomes and limited jobs for the poor inhabitants, and (iii) poor institutional \neffectiveness and coordination to manage biodiversity conservation and natural resources. The \nproblem  tree  analysis  is  in  Appendix  2.  The  major  problems  are  related  to  land  and \nenvironmental  degradation,  animals  and  plants  (including  forest)  endangered  or  under  threat, \nthe presence of some exotic or alien tree species, the need for long-term species regeneration \nand  expansion,  and  the  need  for  sustainable  conservation  and  preservation  management \ntechniques. The loss of biological resources, ecosystems, and habitats for rare and endangered \nspecies  is  strongly  correlated  with  habitat  loss  because  of  land  degradation.  As  such, \nbiodiversity conservation and habitat restoration in the Qinling Mountains and the project area \n                                                 \n1  Eight animal species are in class I, including the giant panda, golden monkey, golden takin, crested ibis, clouded \nleopard, and oriental white stork; and 34 animal species are in class II. The Qinling Mountains have considerable \nbiodiversity  with  more  than  3,100  plant  species  and  more  than  600  animal  species.  The  Qinling  Mountains  have \nWorld Wide Fund for Nature conservation status. \n\n2   More  than  15  animal  species  are  on  the  national  priority  protection  wildlife  list,  including  the  giant  panda \n(Ailuropoda  melanoleuca),  golden  takin  (Budorcas  taxicolor),  golden  snub-nosed  monkey  (Rhinopithecus \nroxellana), crested ibis (Nipponia nippon), brown-eared pheasant (Crossoptilon mantchuricum), red panda (Ailurus \nfulgens), clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), and giant salamander (Andrias davidianus). The Qinling Mountains, \nhome to about 20% of the People's Republic of China's (PRC) total  wild panda population, has the highest giant \npanda population density in the country. Many important plant species are endemic (1,428 species), relic, rare, or \nendangered, including the ginkgo, one of the oldest tree species in the world. The Chinese mountain larch (Larix \nchinensis), oneflower kingdonia (Kingdonia uniflora), the important source-species of the cultivated peony (Paeonia \nsuffruticosa),  the  Mao-tai  maple  (Acer  miaotaiense),  and  the  Chinese  fir  (Cunninghamia  lanceolata)  are  also \nendangered and listed by the Government as protected species. \n\n3   The Qinling National Botanical Garden (QNBG) obtained national botanical garden status, and is one of only two \n\nsuch gardens in the PRC. The other is in Shanghai. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nrequire interventions that respond to land degradation and its underlying causes. The practice of \nagriculture  on  sloped  land  is  a  continuous  threat  to  biodiversity.  Simultaneously,  deforestation \nhas given rise to shrub lands and the replanting of exotic species that crowd out native tree and \nshrub species. However, many other less-severely degraded areas have options for restoring, \nsustaining,  and  enhancing  the  productive  capacity  of  the  land  for  mixed  forests  through  the \nadoption  of  the  appropriate  controls  and  better  land  management  measures.  The  Project  will \naddress all these major problems. \n \n8.  \nDespite these problems affecting the Qinling Mountains and the project area, they offer \nmany  opportunities  to  address  biodiversity  loss,  low  incomes  and  limited  jobs,  and  poor \nmanagement of biological resources. Through ongoing and planned economic opportunities that \ndo  not  adversely  affect  the  biodiversity  conservation  objectives,  more  visitors  to  the  Qinling \nMountains  may  choose  to  visit  the  wildlife  facilities,  botanical  gardens,  hot  springs,  religious \nsites, and protected biodiversity areas, raising revenues and generating more jobs for residents. \nSecured land rights on community forest lands coupled with income-generating activities, such \nas those popularized in the Qinling Mountains by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), can \nlead  to  more  sustainable  and  environment-friendly  activities  of  QBCDA  and  other  Qinling \nMountains  residents.  More  reforestation  on  community  and  state  forestry  lands  of  indigenous \nspecies  will  encourage  the  restoration  of  land  to  original  conditions,  which  will  lead  to  the \ngradual  proliferation  of  endangered  and  threatened  species  of  plants  and  animals.  More \neffective management and agency coordination of biodiversity including at the SARC, and the \ngradual  and  scientific  reintroduction  of  captured  animals  to  the  wild,  will  also  support  the \nregeneration  of  the  natural  environment.  Better  links  and  an  increase  in  biodiversity  corridors \ncan improve all nature reserves and forest reserves of the Qinling Mountains. Institutional and \ncommunity strengthening activities will encourage better planning, design, implementation, and \nmonitoring  of  infrastructure,  forestry,  agriculture,  and  income-generating  activities.  As  a  result, \nthe  project  area  can  generate  more  ecotourism  revenue,  as  well  as  jobs  and  income \nopportunities. Some of this additional revenue can be used for more effective and sustainable \nbiodiversity conservation in the Qinling Mountains and the project area. \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment Policies and ADB\u2019s Country Strategy  \n\n \n9. \nThe PRC aims to conserve 90% of key wild plants through state protection by 2010. To \nreverse  land  degradation,  the  Government  instituted  the  Sloping  Land  Conversion  Program \n(known  as  the  \u201cgrain  for  green\u201d  program)  in  2000.  The  program  provided  grain,  cash,  and \nsaplings to farmers who convert their steep farmlands to grassland or woodland. The program \nhas  been  carried  out  on  600,000\u2013800,000  hectares  (ha)  in  the  Qinling  Mountains,  including  a \nportion of the project area. The PRC ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity in January \n1993,  and  has  implemented  many  of  the  actions  required  by  the  convention  to  achieve \nratification.  The  Government  also  approved  the  Biodiversity  Conservation  Action  Plan  in  June \n1994. The Government approved the first National Strategy for Plant Conservation in February \n2008 to document and conserve plant diversity, and to generate public awareness. The system \nof nature reserves and forest reserves in the Qinling Mountains has been expanded, particularly \nin  eastern  areas.  The  financing  and  management  of  the  25  nature  reserves4 in  the  Qinling \nMountains have been significantly improved in the past few years.  \n \n10. \nThe  Qinling  Mountains  are  listed  as  one  of  the  11  most  critical  regions  for  biodiversity \nconservation  in  the  PRC,5 and  the  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection  nominated  the  Qinling \n\n                                                 \n4   This  number  covers  19  nature  reserves  that  are  administered  by  the  Shaanxi  Forest  Administration  and  forestry \ndepartments and bureaus at the provincial and local government levels, and six smaller nature reserves managed \nby other government agencies such as water resources and the Environmental Protection Bureau.   \n\n5   State  Environmental  Protection  Administration.  1998.  China\u2019s  Biodiversity:  A  Country  Study.  Beijing  (it  is  now \n\nknown as the Ministry of Environmental Protection). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nMountains  Ecosystem  Function  Conservation  Area  (QMEFCA)  as  a  national  pilot  program  in \n2001.  The  strategies  proposed  to  protect  the  Qinling  Mountains  include  (i)  establishing  joint \nmanagement  with  forest  bureau  staff  and  villagers;  (ii)  establishing  biological  corridors  to \ncounter  the  impacts  of  highways  and  railways;  (iii)  strengthening  management  of  nature \nreserves and forest reserves along highways to counter illegal entry by villagers and livestock, \nand blockage of wildlife movements by fences installed to protect natural forests; (iv) enhancing \nthe  administration  of,  and  increasing  investment  in,  nature  reserves  and  forest  reserves;  (v) \nimproving tourism management; and (vi) diversifying village enterprises. \n \nThe Government has introduced subsidy programs to encourage voluntary resettlement \n11.  \nout of the mountainous area. In 2007, the Shaanxi government announced a program to reform \nforest  lands  owned  by  the  state  and  collectives  to  improve  forest  management  by  contracting \nmore user rights to farmers and other investors for up to 70 years. Such land-use policies will be \nessential to achieving the permanent forest cover that will enable households to improve their \nlivelihoods from lands that are too steep for cultivation. The New Socialist Countryside Policy of \n2006 emphasizes accelerating rural income growth, acknowledging that the persistent decline in \nnatural resources and the deteriorating environment need to be addressed.6  \n \n12.  \nThe  project  area  is  included  within  the  Southern  Shaanxi  Regional  Strategy,  which \nprioritizes  sustainable  economic  development,  conservation  and  protection  of  ecological \nresources  and  functions,  and  the  need  to  build  local  enterprises  to  address  rural  poverty  by \nlinking  the  rural  poor  to  local  value-adding  industry  and  market  chains.  Tourism,  including \necotourism, is also identified as an important element of the economic development strategy. \n \n13.  \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC  (2008\u2013\n2010)  supports  poverty  reduction  and  investment  that  improves  the  quality  of  life  for  those  on \nlow incomes.7 It also provides assistance to protect natural resources and environmental assets, \nespecially  those  that  have  regional  or  even  international  significance.  ADB\u2019s  operations  will \nsupport  the  Government\u2019s  policies  with  a  focus  on  improving  equity  and  environmental \nsustainability. \n \n \n \n14.   Biodiversity  conservation  programs  have  been  well  supported  within  the  Qinling \nMountains  since  1985  when  the  first  World  Bank-GEF  protected  area  and  nature  reserve \nprogram  was  implemented  (Appendix  3).  The  program  sought  to  strengthen  nature  reserve \nmanagement capacity, and to introduce new approaches to conservation management built on \ndevelopment-partner  collaboration.  WWF  has  supported  species  management  for  the  giant \npanda,  habitat  protection  and  restoration,  capacity  building  programs,  and  rural  livelihood  and \necotourism programs in the Qinling Mountains with considerable success and influence. WWF\u2019s \nQinling  Panda  Focal  Project  emphasizes  cooperation  with  nontraditional  conservation  forces, \nsuch  as  national  and  regional  government  projects  and  economic  development  activities \n(Appendix 3). The Government has implemented some related initiatives over the past decade \nwith ADB and other international partners. Related programs and projects that will offer valuable \nlinks and potential collaboration with this Project include the ongoing PRC-GEF Partnership on \nLand  Degradation  in  Dryland  Ecosysbtems,  and  the  Capacity  Building  to  Combat  Land \nDegradation  Project  cofinanced  by  ADB  and  GEF. 8  Land  degradation,  especially  through \n                                                 \n6  Communist  Party  of  China  Central  Committee.  2007.

The  World  Bank  has  successfully  implemented  12  environmental  improvement \nprojects in Shaanxi, while the International Fund for Agricultural Development has implemented \none project. Japan has also implemented one reforestation project in Shaanxi. The total value of \nthese projects exceeds $1 billion (Appendix 4). \n \n \n \nThe following lessons are derived from similar ADB projects: (i) provincial governments \n15.  \nshould ensure strong ownership; (ii) an effective provincial-level leading group is necessary to \nprovide leadership and guidance; (iii) commercial operations should adopt a flexible approach, \nand  be  sensitive  to  changes  in  market  demand  and  prices;  and  (iv)  consultants  must  support \ninstitutional capacity  building  of the stakeholders  involved,  including  project  management.  Key \nlessons from World Bank-funded projects (Appendix 3) include the need to (i) build in financial \nsustainability, (ii) involve local people, (iii) identify community forest rights and responsibilities in \nresource  use,  and  (iv)  establish  supportive  policies  and  incentives  for  resource  conservation. \nKey  lessons  from  GEF\u2019s  experience  with  global  projects  and  activities  in  biodiversity \nconservation include the need to ensure stakeholder participation through user groups, village \nproject  committees,  and  decentralization  of  project  management.  Close  cooperation  among \nmajor  stakeholders,  including  local  government  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations,  and \nlocal inhabitants, was found to be critical to project success. \n \n16. \nThe lessons from previous agriculture and environment projects in the PRC and Shaanxi \nprovince,  as  well  as  in  other  major  provinces  with  biodiversity  activities  including  Sichuan  and \nYunnan  provinces,  have  been  incorporated  in  the  Project.  The  provincial  government  and \nQNBG,  as  the  Implementing  Agency  (IA),  have  a  strong  commitment  to  and  ownership  of  the \nProject.  All  major  stakeholders  have  been  extensively  consulted.  Linking  biodiversity \nconservation  with  revenue  generation  in  project  area  and  the  Qinling  Mountains  is  fully \nsupported.  The  Project  is  well  focused  in  terms  of  area  coverage,  and  the  outputs  are  well \ndefined, closely linked, and within the capacities of QNBG to effectively manage.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n17. \nThe  expected  impact  of  the  Project  is  sustainable  biodiversity  conservation  to  protect \nglobally-significant species and sustain economic growth. This will be measured by a reduction \nin  degraded  land  and  soil  erosion,  an  increase  in  the  area  that  protects  endangered  species, \nand an increase in rural incomes and employment. Livelihood diversification, including the ability \nof  the  rural  poor  to  access  higher-paying  employment,  will  increase  rural  incomes  and  skills. \nBiodiversity conservation will be enhanced through habitat protection and restoration programs \nlinked  to  conservation  forestry,  stronger  management,  and  species  management  programs \noutside their original location, and extensive awareness and education programs. \n \n18. \nThe  expected  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  improved  and  integrated  biodiversity \nmanagement,  providing  sustainable  livelihoods  for  the  population  of  the  project  area.  The \noutcome will also be shared and demonstrated to the rest of the Qinling Mountains. The Project \nwill provide significant environmental, economic, and social benefits throughout the project area. \nThe Project will address underlying causes and effects of historical and contemporary resource \ndegradation. The main monitoring indicators will be (i) livelihood improvements for farmers and \nQBCDA  residents,  (ii)  management  plans  prepared  for  at  least  five  endangered  species,  (iii) \nincreases in quantity and quality of habitat within the project area, and (iv) contributions to well-\nmanaged conservation breeding programs. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \nB. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n \n\n1. \n\nParticipatory Biodiversity Management in the Mountainous Area \n\n \nThis  component  will  support  (i)  the  demonstration  of  biodiversity  conservation,  and  (ii) \n19.  \nforest-based livelihoods for poor villages through restoration of about 7,000 ha of forest habitat \nsuitable for the indigenous flora and fauna. The mountainous area is not suitable for agriculture, \nbut has been used to grow some food on steeply sloping lands. Biodiversity conservation in the \nproject area and elsewhere in the Qinling Mountains will be financed with revenue from QNBG \n(including SARC) through an innovative revenue-sharing and redistribution program. QNBG will \ntransfer grant funds annually to QBCDA. QNBG will ensure that sufficient funds are available for \nQBCDA.9 \n \nDemonstrating  Conservation  of  Biodiversity.  This  subcomponent  will  have  three \n20. \nmajor  activities:  (i)  restoration  of  state  forest  land  managed  by  the  Shaanxi  Forest  Bureau \n(SFB),  (ii)  preparation  of  a  forest  management  plan,  and  (iii)  development  of  endangered \nspecies management programs. About 2,000 ha of habitat on state forest land will be restored \nfor ecological research, forest silviculture, understory planting, and canopy manipulation. State \nforest land is managed by SFB throughout the Qinling Mountains, and specifically by QNBG in \nQBCDA. The objective of habitat restoration is to transform the existing monoculture into mixed \nforest  cover.  Non-endemic  species  will  not  be  introduced  into  the  forest  area.  Existing  non-\nendemic  species  will  be  identified  and  removed  during  the  reforestation.  QBCDA  has  been \nselected  as  a  demonstration  and  training  site  for  those  working  in  other  parts  of  the  Qinling \nMountains.  In  effect,  it  will  function  as  a  field  conservation  training  and  demonstration  area. \nMethods and skills will be developed and lessons disseminated from the area. A detailed forest \nand habitat management plan will be prepared consistent with the village development plans for \nQBCDA  as  a  training  program  for  agency  staff  in  the  Qinling  Mountains.  QNBG  will  work  with \nlocal  inhabitants  to  develop  the  plans  and  implement  the  habitat  restoration  programs  in  a \nparticipatory  manner  conducive  to  adoption  of  more  sustainable  livelihood  activities.  The  local \ninhabitants, assisted by QNBG, will be responsible for habitat restoration management. QNBG \nwill provide training and employment to participating QBCDA inhabitants to restore mixed forest \nhabitat.  The  costs  for  land  preparation,  nurseries  and  seedlings,  planting,  establishment  and \nmaintenance,  pest  control,  and  labor  will  be  financed  by  QNBG  under  the  Project.  GEF \nfinancing will support the conservation forestry programs.  \n \n21.  \nThe  Project  will  also  develop  at  least  five  endangered  species  management  programs \nthat  will  operate  within  and  beyond  nature  reserve  boundaries.  Support  will  be  provided  to \nintegrate the management of SARC under QNBG. The SARC division of QNBG, in cooperation \nwith  the  SFB,  will  implement  the  endangered  species  recovery  plans.  The  objectives  of  the \nplans are to (i) remove the target species from the endangered list,10 and (ii) progressively lower \nthe threat level from endangered to threatened. For example, the crested ibis foraging habitat in \nwetlands and rice fields would have to be restored in the project area and maintained to enable \nthe  eventual  release  of  captive  birds  into  the  wild.  The  integration  will  be  developed  through \nshared  research,  joint  planning  exercises,  and  sharing  of  data  and  experiences  for  controlled \nrelease  programs.  The  demonstration  model  framework  will  be  replicated  in  other  parts  of  the \n                                                 \n9   Funds  can  be  allocated  for  the  following  activities:  (i)  habitat  development,  40%  ($160,000);  (ii)  monitoring,  25% \n($100,000);  (iii)  livelihood  improvement,  25%  ($100,000);  and  (iv)  implementation  of  endangered  species \nmanagement  plans,  10%  ($40,000).  As  the  revenue  increases,  the  funds  allocated  to  wider  livelihood  and \nconservation  programs  will  increase,  including  support  for  the  Qinling  Mountains,  such  as  grants  for  residents  to \nwork in conservation and livelihood enterprises. \n\n10 The criteria for delisting species from the endangered species list include (i) decline of a population by less than \n20% over the last 20 years, (ii) a population of more than 10,000, and (iii) less than 20% probability of extinction in \nthe next 100 years. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nprovince,  as  well  as  in  other  provinces  in  the  PRC.  The  endangered  species  management \nprogram will use the project area as a field conservation research area from which monitoring \ncan be carried out and lessons can be disseminated throughout the Qinling Mountains. \n \n22. \nImproved  Village  and  Forest-Based  Livelihoods.  The  Project  will  support  the \ndevelopment of about 5,000 ha of conservation forestry and agriculture on collective forest land \nin the mountainous area in cooperation with local inhabitants on a voluntary basis. This will be \nachieved  through  the  provision  of  technical  support,  planting  materials,  and  site  management \ntechnologies,  including  shade  planting  to  enhance  light  penetration  and  intercropping.  Local \ninhabitants  operate  and  manage  the  collective  forest  land  after  being  granted  long-term  land- \nuse  rights.  Local  residents  will  receive  support  for  the  development  of  nurseries,  land \npreparation,  and  planting  and  tree  maintenance  costs.  Inhabitants  in  QBCDA  will  be \ncompensated  for  any  losses  incurred  in  replacing  subsistence  farming  with  more  sustainable \nand  environment-friendly  forest  and  income-enhancing  activities.  QNBG  will  assist  local \ninhabitants with  livelihood  improvements  that will  encourage  the  replacement  of  unsustainable \nactivities.11 Mixed flora species that mature into natural forests will generate substantial benefits, \nincluding reduced soil and water loss, and forest and non-forest products. To help increase rural \nincomes, valuable medicinal plants and trees will also be promoted on a household scale. The \nProject  will  support  forest-based  production  systems  to  enable  policy  reforms  and  future \nreplication  of  successful  models.  The  village  development  plans  will  identify  collective  forest \nlands that will be surveyed and demarcated. The SFB, along with Zhouzhi County  and village \nleaders,  will  issue  forest-user  rights  contracts  to  all  households.  During  the  planning  process, \nvillage forestry associations will be formed through which the conservation forestry program will \nbe  implemented.  The  Project  will  introduce  environmentally  compatible  rural  technologies, \ninfrastructure, and business practices for villagers that choose to shift into forest management \nand  ecotourism  livelihoods.  This  will  enable  local  residents  to  remain  in  QBCDA  in  a  manner \nthat  supports  the  forest  conservation  and  biodiversity  objectives.  All  16  village  communities  in \nthe area have expressed support for the Project.  \n \n23.   QNBG  will  upgrade  community  infrastructure,  including  up  to  about  17.5  km  of  roads \nalong  the  Tianyu  River  and  about  100  km  of  mountain  pathways,  to  reduce  travel  time  and \nensure  access  during  bad  weather.  QNBG  will  also  promote  home-stays  and  other  income-\ngenerating activities, which will directly benefit residents. This activity will be modeled after the \nsuccessful  WWF-supported  home-stays  and  income-generating  activities  in  several  nature \nreserves in the Qinling Mountains. Training and technical advice will be provided to farmers to \nencourage  them  to  adopt  these  eco-friendly  activities.  QBCDA  communities  will  also  access \nproject  funds  on  a  grant  basis  for  small  home-based  business  development,  including \nsustainable  forest  production  systems  and  other  benign  activities,  such  as  beekeeping,  and \nessential  oil  and  medicinal  plant  production.  Support  will  be  provided  for  market  research  to \nensure viability and links to local value chains. Grants will also be available for villages and all \nhouseholds  to  develop  alternative  energy  sources  (biogas  and  solar),  and  water  supply  and \nsanitation schemes where these are identified during the village development plans. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnhanced Biodiversity Conservation in the Plains Area \n\n \nThis component will support QNBG, a public sector enterprise, in enhancing biodiversity \n24. \nconservation  through  the  development  of  botanical  gardens,  and  rehabilitation  of  the  animal  \n \n\n                                                 \n11 QNBG,  in  consultation  with  community  leaders,  will  provide  small  income-generating  grants  to  the  households  in \nthe  Qinling  Biological  Conservation  Demonstration  Area  (QBCDA)  (totaling  about  1,000  households)  for  such \nbusiness  activities  as  beekeeping,  poultry  raising,  handicraft  making,  establishment  of  small  restaurants,  and \nproduction of biogas digesters. The grants will not exceed CNY25,000 per household. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nrescue  center.12 QNBG  will  manage  all  operations  in  the  project  area,  including  biodiversity \nconservation  in  QBCDA.  Through  QNBG,  the  Project  will  (i)  enhance  public  awareness  of \nbiodiversity conservation; (ii) create off-farm jobs, especially for the poor population residing in \nand  around  the  project  area;  (iii)  expand  and  diversify  the  ecotourism  industry  in  Shaanxi \nprovince;  (iv)  transfer  a  portion  of  QNBG\u2019s  revenues  to  support  biodiversity  conservation  and \nalternative  livelihood  development  activities  in  QBCDA;  and  (v)  support  QBCDA  activities \nthrough research and technological assistance. \n \n25. \nThe Shaanxi provincial government (SPG) has proposed a long-term plan for the project \narea, with ADB and GEF providing finance during 2010\u20132015. The SPG and the private sector \nwould  provide  financing  for  a  longer  second  phase  of  gradual  expansion,  based  on  lessons \nlearned from the Project, to the wider Qinling Mountains. The Project is designed to (i) formulate \na long-term plan for the project area based on the successful models that will be demonstrated; \n(ii)  reach  an  agreement  with  villages  on  land  uses  and  forest  management  practices  that  will \nensure  forest  conservation  and  biodiversity;  and  (iii)  establish  sustainable  levels  of  financing \nfrom  the  SPG,  ecotourism,  and  forest  management  enterprises.  This  would  allow  for  (i) \nexpansion of infrastructure for ecotourism in the project area, (ii) preparation of plans to improve \nbiodiversity  conservation  in  the  other  nature  reserves  and  forest  reserves  in  the  Qinling \nMountains, and (iii) incorporation of lessons learned from the Project. The Project will undertake \nconstruction  of  essential  infrastructure,  including  internal  site  roads,  drainage  system,  water \nsupply,  animal  exposition  and  display  areas,  animal  enclosures,  lighting,  water  supply \ninvestments, and integrating Taoist features into cultural developments with QNBG. \n \nBotanical  Gardens.  QNBG\u2019s  botanical  gardens  will  consist  of  gardens  linked  by \n26. \nwalkways.  Public  education  and  awareness  displays  along  these  walkways  will  provide \ninformation  on  themes  such  as  natural  history,  environment,  and  biodiversity.  QNBG  will  also \nconstruct a major exhibition hall to represent aspects of natural history and a service reception \ncenter.  The  18  contiguous  botanical  gardens  and  other  infrastructure  will  cover  about  269  ha. \nThe gardens will also be linked by walkways and a cable car to a series of Taoist and Buddhist \ncultural  sites  that  will  be  restored  or  recreated. 13 Taoism,  Buddhism,  and  local  culture  and \nhistory will be displayed along the entrances to these sites. \n \n27.   Revenues  will  be  generated  from  day  visitors  and  the  use  of  entry  tickets  along  with \nprofits from attractions or services, including the cable car, restaurants, rental cars, temple sites, \nand  an  exhibition  hall.  The  number  of  visitors  to  the  gardens  alone  is  expected  to  rise  from \n350,000  in  2011  to  about  478,000  on  project  completion  to  more  than  1.2  million  in  2020. \nForecasts indicate that revenue will increase from about CNY30 million to about CNY65 million \nin  2015  and  about  CNY158  million  in  2035.  Employment  will  increase  from  the  current  40  to \nmore than 250 staff by project completion; as the number of visitors grows, employment could \nreach about 600. \n \n28.   Animal Rescue Center. QNBG\u2019s SARC operates from a 141-ha site within the LFF. The \nmain rescue center is a 6-ha area for animal pens for public viewing. The site is in disrepair and \nfacing significant animal welfare issues. The center attracts about 30,000 visitors per year. The \nProject  will  significantly  expand  SARC  to  reposition  it  as  a  center  of  excellence  operating  at \n\n                                                 \n12 The Shaanxi provincial government established QNBG in August 2007, as an amalgamation of the Shaanxi Qinling \nBotanical Garden, Shaanxi Animal Rescue Center, and the Louguantai Forest Farm, to facilitate the management \nand  financing  of  improvements  in  QBCDA.  QNBG  will  be  under  the  supervision  of  the  Shaanxi  Forest  Bureau. \nQNBG is fully operational and has three divisions: Botanical Garden, Shaanxi Animal Rescue Center, and QBCDA. \n13 QNBG  and  the  Louguantai  Taoist Temple will  jointly  undertake  the  restoration  program. The  temple  will  assist  in \nthe identification of legitimate sites and design specifications. The temple will be required to ratify the final designs \nto  the  project  management  office  before  any  ADB  approval  for  the  financing  of  these  sites.  This  approval  will \ninclude design and operational parameters, including the sharing of revenue. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\ninternational  standards  in  the  management,  display,  and  gradual  release  of  threatened \nindigenous  species.  The  Project  will  modernize  the  center  by  (i)  increasing  the  personnel  and \ntheir  capacity  in  wildlife  conservation;  (ii)  achieving  more  efficient  rescue  of  wild,  endangered \nanimals and their gradual rehabilitation and release; (iii) developing a high-quality tourism site; \n(iv) increasing the quantity and quality of research into wildlife; and (v) creating an awareness \nand  education  program  for  visitors  and  local  communities  on  wildlife  and  biodiversity.  The \nProject will entail an increase in the area from 141 ha to 1,008 ha. The enlargement will include \nthe  development  of  satellite  sites  in  more  natural  environments  for  the  major  endangered \nspecies\u2014giant panda, crested ibis, and golden snub-nosed monkey. \n \n29.   At project completion, SARC will have about 70% of the forage area developed and will \nbe able to support about 80% of total planned numbers of iconic species. As numbers and the \nscience  allow,  SARC  will  undertake  the  controlled  release  of  species  from  breeding  centers. \nThe Giant Panda Breeding and Research Center will be expanded to include 10 nursery rooms, \n32  enclosures,  a  reception  and  display  area,  and  a  research  and  feed-growing  area.  The \nCrested  Ibis  Center  will  include  the construction  of  a  140,000-square  meter  facility  comprising \nan artificial wetland on which a large flight aviary will be constructed to enable nesting colonies \nto be established. The Golden Monkey Center will involve about 10 ha of forested land that will \nsupport about 30 animals. The number of visitors is projected to increase to about 430,000 by \nproject  completion  in  2013,  and  then  increase  to  more  than  1  million  in  2030.  Revenue  will \nincrease to about CNY33.3 million by project completion, CNY63 million by 2015, and CNY130 \nmillion  in  2035.  SARC  management  will  contract  a  commercial  tourism  operator.  Current  staff \nlevels of 28 full-time jobs will increase to 200 full-time jobs by 2013. \n \n\n3. \n\nImproved Project Management \n\n \n30. \nThe  component  will  comprise  (i)  strengthening  the  project  management  office  (PMO) \nand  IA,  (ii)  institutional  strengthening,  and  (iii)  a  conservation  replication  and  dissemination \nprogram.  Successful  practices  in  biodiversity  conservation  and  habitat  restoration  with \ncommunity  participation  and  livelihood  development  will  be  analyzed  and  documented  for \nreplication in the Qinling Mountains.  \n \n31.   Strengthened  Project  Management  Office  and  Implementing  Agency.  The  Project \nwill be implemented through a PMO that will support QNBG in coordinating implementation. The \nPMO  will  be  supported  with  11  newly  recruited  staff  supplied  and  financed  by  the  Shaanxi \nDepartment  of  Finance,  the  Provincial  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  and  the  SFB. \nThe  Project  will  finance  staff,  office  facilities,  field  monitoring  equipment,  project  impact \n(including resettlement monitoring), and training. Fifteen professional job exchanges for up to 2 \nmonths are allocated\u201410 to staff of QNBG, the IA; 5 to staff of the SPG, the Executing Agency \n(EA) staff. Project procurement will be undertaken by the IA and will be administered by a local \ncompany contracted by the PMO. \n \n32.   Strengthened  Biodiversity  Safeguards.  The  Project  will  develop  options \nfor \nsustainable  management  and  development  to  safeguard  and  mainstream  biodiversity.  The \nProject will review policies and regulations, and develop recommendations for the Government \non  (i)  collective  forest  land  tenure  and  management,  and  (ii)  ecotourism  guidelines  and \nstandards.  The  studies  will  be  contracted  to  reputable  research  institutions  with  a  strong \nknowledge  of  the  subject  matters.  QNBG  will  ensure  that the  recommendations  of  the  studies \nare implemented to strengthen biodiversity conservation. \n \n33.   Conservation  Dissemination  Program.  The  Project  will  undertake  a  series  of \nparticipatory dissemination programs involving biodiversity experts from the Qinling Mountains, \nusing  the  project  area  as  a  basis  for  developing  and  testing  approaches  to  biodiversity \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nActivities Financed by the Global Environment Facility  \n\nconservation. The SFB, with earlier support from WWF, has made important gains in landscape \napproaches  to  management  of  nature  reserves,  and  in  linking  corridors  with  remaining  forest \nand  farm  lands.  Support  will  be  provided  to  further  define  and  test  landscape  planning  and \nconservation management models for the Qinling Mountains. The models will be evaluated and \nthen used to prepare landscape management guidelines for the Qinling Mountains. Participants \nwill  form  a  professional  communication  network  to  build  a  stronger  professional  cadre.  The \nProject will assist stakeholders in developing an ecotourism master plan that can guide QNBG\u2019s \ninvestment program.  \n \n34.   Support  will  be  provided  for  (i)  the  development  of  a  data  collection  system,  including \nprocurement  of  field  monitoring  equipment  (such  as  camera  traps  and  global  positioning \nsystems); (ii) data collection and interpretation of imagery; (iii) training for existing QNBG staff to \nenable  them  to  form  a  field  monitoring  team;  (iv)  monitoring  of  biodiversity  and  habitats  using \ngeographic  information  system  application  of  data;  and  (v)  dissemination  of  this  data  and \nanalysis  throughout  the  Qinling  Mountains.  The  dissemination  program  will  include  the \ncommunication  of  data,  analysis,  and  lessons  learned  from  the  Project  to  a  wide  set  of \nstakeholders within the Qinling Mountains. WWF may be considered for this activity because of \nits  extensive  monitoring  program  in  the  Qinling  Mountains  and  its  close  association  with  the \nSFB.  The  baseline  will  be  formed  through  a  series  of  contracted  field  survey  and  research \nstudies  involving  (i)  vegetation,  (ii)  vertebrates,  (iii)  invertebrates,  (iv)  fish  and  aquatic \nbiodiversity, (v) amphibians, and (vi) soil microbial organisms.  \n \nC. \n \n35.  \nThe  GEF  will  provide  $5  million  to  the  Project.  After  deductions  to  recover  the  project \npreparation costs and a 10% management fee, the net GEF investment funds available to the \nProject will be $4.27 million. GEF funds will be used for the components that are directly related \nto strengthening the conservation of biodiversity in the project area and the Qinling Mountains. \nThe  approach  to  using  the  GEF  funds  emphasizes  the  development  of  communication  and \nshared  information  and  lessons  through  (i)  wider  participation  in  conservation  planning  and \ndecision making; (ii) the demonstration of new management systems related to landscape-wide \nplanning; (iii) the development of species management plans in the Qinling Mountains; (iv) the \nadoption  of  new  technologies,  including  monitoring  and  information  systems;  (v)  the  use  of \nanalog  forestry  models;  and  (vi)  the  development  of  ecologically  defined  habitat  restoration \nprograms. The GEF support will also help test innovative models for scaling up in other parts of \nthe Qinling Mountains and the PRC. \n \nFor  assisting  biodiversity  management  in  the  mountainous  area  (output  1),  GEF  and \n36.  \nloan  funds  will  support  the  demonstration  of  biodiversity  conservation  (subcomponent  1), \nincluding  (i)  the  preparation  of  a  habitat  and  natural  forest  management  plan;  (ii)  ecological \nresearch grants to develop the data sets and to test silviculture systems for habitat restoration; \n(iii)  technical  assistance  in  conservation  forestry  to  support  the  habitat  restoration  programs; \nand  (iv)  programs  for  endangered  species  recovery,  including  field  survey  contracts,  species \nrecovery  management  plans,  and  initial  implementation  of  recovery  implementation  programs. \nTo assist project management (output 3), GEF funding will support (i) legal reform studies, (ii) \nlandscape conservation planning, (iii) field conservation monitoring, (iv) technical assistance for \nspecies and monitoring expertise, (v) monitoring baseline research contracts, (vi) job exchange \nopportunities for technical conservation staff, and (vii) a replication and awareness program. \n \nD. \n \n37.   An important feature of the Project is the demonstration of biodiversity conservation in a \nsmaller  and  focused  area,  and  its  link  to  other Qinling  Mountains  conservation  programs.  The \nlink  includes  a  review  of  conservation  priorities  and  plans  for  the  Qinling  Mountains;  the \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\ndemonstration  of  new  technologies  and  practices;  and  the  sharing  of  information  and \nopportunities  for  research,  monitoring,  and  management.  The  institutional  and  organizational \nreforms in the project area mirror the major challenges to improving management in the wider \nQinling  Mountains.  The  vast  array  of  scattered  and  often  overlapping  organizational  interests \nhave resulted in competitive behavior, lack of cooperation, resources wastage, and the dilution \nof skills in short supply. The consolidation of various agencies into one management entity for \nbiodiversity  conservation  represents  a  significant  achievement  that  could  be  replicated \nthroughout the PRC and internationally. \n \nAnother innovation is the demonstration model for financial sustainability of biodiversity \n38. \nconservation.  The  SPG  has  embarked  on  an  ambitious  program  to  use  protected  areas  to \ngenerate  revenue  to  help  cover  its  costs  for  conservation  establishment  and  management.  In \nthis case, QNBG will respond to customer demand for rare animal experiences, and will expand \nthe market of natural attractions, such as the botanical garden, the animal center, the birthplace \nof  the  Taoist  religion,  and  the  remarkable  landscape.  The  proposed  model  for  transferring \nfinancial  resources  to  the  wider  biodiversity  conservation  program  will  provide  a  sustainable \nfinancing  mechanism  that  will  not  depend  on  continued  donor  or  government  support.  The \ndevelopment of QNBG offers world-class and highly-demanded ecotourism opportunities linked \nto  globally-iconic  species.  SARC  will  be  developed  as  a  world-class  center  for  the  care  and \nwelfare  of  animals,  and  will  be  the  conduit  for  expanding  animal  biodiversity  throughout  the \nproject area. The project area\u2019s proximity to Xi'an and the mass tourism market provide a good \nopportunity  to  establish links  to  the Shaanxi  tourism  market  chain.  The potential  benefits  from \necotourism are also expected to help reduce poverty in the project area. \n \nE. \n \n39. \nmillion.

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility for US dollar loans, a commitment \ncharge of about 0.15% per year on undisbursed funds, and such other terms and conditions set \nforth  in  the  loan  and  project  agreements.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the \nreasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The GEF grant of \n$4.27 million will finance about 3.2% of the project cost. The remaining $88.37 million (66.6%) \nwill be contributed by the SPG as counterpart funds or from IA revenues. The financing plan is \nsummarized in Table 2. \n \n\nSource \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \n\nTotal \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGlobal Environment Facility  \nGovernment \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n40.00 \n4.27 \n88.37 \n132.64 \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n% \n\n30.2 \n3.2 \n66.6 \n100.0 \n\n \n \nThe Borrower is the PRC, which will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan to the SPG for \n41. \nonlending  to  the  IA  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan.  The  flow  of \nfunds  and  onlending  arrangements  are  shown  in  Appendix  6.  The  Chinese  Academy  for  the \nAdvancement  of  Science,  the  SPG,  and  State  Forestry  Administration  each  will  provide  about \n28.5%  of  the  counterpart  funds  for  QNBG,  while  the  remaining  14.5%  will  be  provided  by  the \nXi'an municipal government. \n \nG. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n42. \nThe SPG will be the EA responsible for overall implementation of the Project. The SPG \nwill coordinate activities with the Shaanxi Provincial Finance Department and the SFB. The SPG \nhas  formed  a  project  leading  group,  chaired  by  a  vice  governor  with  representatives  from  the \nProvincial Development and Reform Commission, the Shaanxi Provincial Finance Department, \nSFB,  the  Shaanxi  Audit  Department,  the  Shaanxi  Tourism  Bureau,  and  the  Xi'an  municipal \ngovernment.  The  project  leading  group  will  provide  policy  advice  and  approve  annual  work \nplans.  The  SPG  has  also  formed  a  PMO  through  the  Provincial  Development  and  Reform \nCommission which, upon project approval, will be provided with 11 full-time staff members. The \norganizational  chart  is  in  Appendix  7.  The  PMO  will  support  project  implementation  by \ncontracting a procurement agency to undertake the project procurement program on a fee-for-\nservice  basis.  The  SPG  has  successfully  used  this  approach  previously  for  ADB  and  World \nBank  projects.  The  PMO\u2019s  major  tasks  and  responsibilities  include  (i)  overseeing  all \nimplementation  matters;  (ii)  preparing  annual  work  plans  and  budgets  in  consultation  with  the \nEA  and  IA;  (iii)  supervising  procurement  according  to  ADB  guidelines;  (iv)  maintaining  project \naccounts; (v) preparing and submitting to ADB applications for loan and grant fund withdrawals; \n(vi) monitoring physical and financial progress, including benefits and costs to beneficiaries; and \n(vii) ensuring adequate and timely counterpart financing. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n43. \nQNBG will be the IA for all components and activities. Its three divisions for the botanical \ngardens, SARC, and QBCDA will be responsible for (i) habitat restoration and reforestation; (ii) \nprocurement and provision of inputs for construction and habitat restoration; (iii) preparation of \nvillage  development,  habitat  restoration,  endangered  species,  and  landscape  management \nplans  in  a  participatory  manner  with  local  inhabitants;  (iv)  construction,  operation,  and \nmaintenance  of  the  botanical  gardens  and  SARC;  (v)  training  of  QNBG  staff  and  QBCDA \ninhabitants  in  biodiversity  conservation,  forest  management,  project  implementation,  and \nfinancial  management;  and  (vi)  close  consultation  with  the  Louguantai  Daoist  Temple  on  all \ndesign  and  implementation  aspects  of  reconstruction,  and  improvements  of  religious  and \nhistorical relics and buildings. \n \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  from  April  2010  to  April  2015.  The \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n44. \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n45. \nAll  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Contracts for goods estimated \nto  exceed  $1.0  million  and  contracts  for  works  estimated  to  exceed  $10.0  million  will  be \nprocured  using  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Contracts  for  goods  and  works \nestimated  to  cost  less  than  the  international  competitive  bidding  values,  but  more  than \n$100,000, will be procured through national competitive bidding procedures in accordance with \nthe  PRC  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law,  1999,  subject  to  modifications  agreed  upon  with  ADB. \nContracts  for  goods  and  works  estimated  to  cost  $100,000  or  less  shall  be  procured  using \nshopping procedures. Details are in Appendix 9. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all procurement documents and contracts. \nIn  accordance  with  ADB  procedures,  an  assessment  has  been  made  of  the  procurement \ncapacity of the SPG and other project agencies. The assessment concludes that the SPG and \nQNBG  have  adequate  procurement  experience  in  domestically-  and  ADB-financed  projects. \nHowever,  their  staffs  will  need  training  on  financial  management,  and  ADB  procurement \nprocedures  and  requirements  to  ensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  For \nthis  purpose,  SPG  and  QNBG  staff  will  be  nominated  to  attend  ADB-sponsored  courses  and \nseminars on procurement and project implementation. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n46. \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The Project will provide 84 person-months of consulting \nservices,  comprising  15  person-months  of  international  experts  and  69  person-months  of \nnational experts. These services will be procured in two packages. For package A, which will be \nfinanced  under  the  GEF  grant,  QNBG\u2019s  SARC  division  will  select  and  engage  six  individual \nconsultants for  1  month  each\u2014one  international  and  one  national  expert  for  each  of  the  giant \npanda,  crested  ibis,  and  golden  monkey  habitats  and  plans  for  effective  conservation.  For \npackage B, which will also be financed under the GEF grant, the PMO will select and engage a \nconsulting firm using the quality- and cost-based selection method (80:20) and the full technical \nproposal  procedures.  The  consulting  firm  will  provide  expertise  in  biodiversity  conservation, \nspecies  recovery  management,  ecotourism  planning,  village  development  planning,  animal \nexposition and breeding, wildlife veterinary services, species recovery and survey, conservation \nforestry, and geographic information systems. The terms of reference for consulting services are \nin Appendix 10. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n47. \nThe  Government  requested  retroactive  financing  for  procurement  and  construction \nactivities  during  2009.  The  detail  of  activities  to  be  procured  and  financed  will  be  set  out  in  a \nwritten request to ADB. The Government was advised that retroactive financing could only apply \nto up to 20% of the ADB loan for expenditures incurred prior to loan effectiveness but not earlier \nthan 12 months before the signing of the Loan Agreement. All contracts proposed for advanced \naction  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  QNBG  and  SPG. \n48. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding \ndocuments for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB and GEF in connection \nwith  the  Project  will  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the \nrecords and accounts of the QNBG, SPG, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  The  project  design  and  implementation \narrangements  provide \nrisks.  Risks  associated  with  project \nmanagement,  including  procurement  and  disbursement,  will  be  mitigated  by  (i)  engaging  an \ninternational  consultant  and  a  national  consultant  to  advise  and  assist  in  the  procurement  of \ngoods  and  services,  and  the  engagement  of  other  consultants;  (ii)  introducing  a  dual  signing \nsystem in which the civil works contractor awarded the contract will also sign an anticorruption \ncontract  with  the  employer;  and  (iii)  the  PMO  periodically  inspecting  the  contractor\u2019s  activities \nrelated  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements.  The  SPG  will  ensure  that  the  PMO  establishes \nfinancial  control  and  management  arrangements  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the \nFinancial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (2005)  and  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nfor  mitigating  corruption \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \n49. \nDisbursement Handbook. To facilitate project implementation and the flow of funds, an imprest \naccount  will  be  set  up  in  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB  upon  loan  effectiveness;  a \nseparate  imprest  account  will  be  opened  for  the  GEF  grant  funds.  The  SPG\u2019s  Department  of \nFinance  will  manage  both  accounts.  The  initial  advance  to  be  deposited  to  the  loan  imprest \naccount  will  not  exceed  either  6  months  of  estimated  expenditures  to  be  financed  from  an \nimprest account or about 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The initial advance to be \ndeposited  to  the  grant  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  either  6  months  of  estimated \nexpenditures to be financed from an imprest account or 20% of the grant amount, whichever is \nlower. The direct payment procedures will apply for the large contracts. If the SPG initially funds \neligible  expenditures  from  its  own  resources,  the  reimbursement  procedure  will  be  used.  To \nexpedite  funds  flow  and  simplify  the  documentation  process,  the  statement  of  expenditures \n(SOE)  procedure  will  be  used  for  liquidation  and  replenishment  of  imprest  accounts  and \nreimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $100,000  per  individual  payment. \nPayments exceeding the SOE ceiling will be reimbursed, liquidated, or replenished based on full \nsupporting  documentation.  A  financial  management  assessment  of  the  SPG  and  QNBG  was \nconducted  (Supplementary  Appendix  D).  The  assessment  concludes  that  they  satisfy  ADB\u2019s \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nfinancial  management  requirements,  and  that  they  have  satisfactory  financial  management \ncapability. The PMO will provide training on project and financial management. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \nAll agencies involved in project implementation will maintain records and accounts that \n50. \nidentify  goods  and  services  from  loan  proceeds  and  the  GEF  grant,  financing  resources \nreceived, expenditures incurred, and use of local funds. These accounts will be established and \nmaintained  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  and  internationally-accepted \naccounting  standards.  The  PMO  will  review  and  consolidate  these  accounts,  and  have  them \naudited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  practices  by  externally  appointed \nauditors of the Government or other auditors acceptable to ADB. The audit report will include a \nstatement verifying whether the funds disbursed by ADB were used for the purposes for which \nthey were provided, as well as the separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the imprest account \nand SOE procedures. Copies of the audited accounts and auditor\u2019s report will be submitted to \nADB  within  6  months  of  the  end  of  each  financial  year.  The  PMO  will  prepare  consolidated \nsemi-annual  reports  indicating  progress  made, problems  encountered during  the  period,  steps \ntaken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the  problems,  proposed  program  of  activities,  and  progress \nexpected  for  the  following  6  months.  In  addition,  SPG  will  provide  to  ADB  a  brief  report  3 \nmonths  prior  to  each  semi-annual  report  summarizing  contract  awards,  disbursements,  and \nphysical progress to cover the 3 months under review. The loan and GEF grant will be covered \nin these reports. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the PMO will submit to \nADB a completion report that describes the achievements in relation to the Project\u2019s expected \nimpact, outcome, and outputs. QNBG will have its accounts audited and its financial statements \nprepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards by auditors acceptable to \nADB.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \nTo  monitor  the  progress  of  the  Project  in  achieving  the  planned  outcome  and  outputs, \n51. \nthe  PMO  will  establish  and  maintain  a  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS),  which \nwill be designed to permit adequate flexibility to adopt remedial action regarding project design, \nschedules, activities, and development impacts. The PPMS will adopt the following agreed-upon \nindicators:  (i)  project  progress,  (ii)  enabling  framework  improvements  (policies  and  legal \nharmonization  and  clear  institutional  mandates),  (iii)  results  of  capacity  development,  (iv) \nprogress towards demonstration and pilot targets using participatory procedures, (v) beneficiary \nimpacts,  (vi)  related  improvement  to  the  sustainable  financing  of  field  conservation,  and  (vii) \nADB safeguards compliance. At project inception, the PMO, in consultation with QNBG and with \nthe  assistance  of \nto \nsystematically  generate  data  on  inputs  and  outputs  of  the  project  activities;  and  the \nsocioeconomic,  health,  and  environmental  indicators  to  measure  project  impacts.  This  will \ninclude  individual  and  consolidated  work  plans,  which,  once  approved,  will  form  the  basis  for \nassessing  progress  and  achievements.  The  PMO  will  refine  the  PPMS  framework,  confirm \nachievable targets, firm up monitoring and recording arrangements, and establish systems and \nprocedures  no  later  than  6  months  after  loan  effectiveness.  QNBG  will  report  baseline  and \nprogress  data  at  the  requisite  time  intervals  to  the  PMO,  including  resettlement  monitoring \nresults and reporting on environmental management. The PMO will be responsible for analyzing \nand  consolidating  the  reported  data  through  its  management  information  system,  and  for \nreporting the outcome to ADB through quarterly progress reports. \n \n\nthe  consultants,  will  develop  comprehensive  PPMS  procedures \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n52. \nIn  addition  to  regular  monitoring,  ADB  and  SPG  will  jointly  review  the  project \nperformance  at  least  once  a  year.  The  review  will  assess  implementation,  and  financial \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nperformance  and  progress  towards  achieving  project  outcome  and  outputs.  It  will  also  identify \nissues and constraints affecting implementation, and work out a time-bound action plan for their \nresolution.  ADB  and  SPG  will  undertake  a  midterm  review  before  the  end  of  the  third  year  to \nassess  implementation  status  and  take  appropriate  measures,  including  modifying  the  scope \nand implementation arrangements, and reallocating loan and grant proceeds, as appropriate, to \nachieve the Project\u2019s impact and outcome. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \n53. \nThe  population  of  some  of  the  endangered  species  has  declined  rapidly.  Under  the \nProject,  this  population  will  slowly  regenerate,  expanding  in  numbers  and  coverage  area.  The \narea  experiencing  soil  degradation  and  erosion  will  be  reduced  through  forest  expansion  and \nbetter management. The Project seeks to achieve these objectives by including local villagers in \nthe  improvement  and  management  of  forest  lands.  The  residents  in  QBCDA  will  be  provided \nwith  user  and  management  rights  for  70  years.  Further,  they  will  receive  grants  and  technical \nassistance  to  (i)  establish  analog  forest  systems,  (ii)  develop  local  value-adding  industries  for \nforest-derived  products,  (iii)  establish  home-stays,  (iv)  introduce  alternate  energy  and  water \nsupplies, and (v) improve access by upgrading the Tianyu River road and a network of mountain \npathways.  The  Project  will  substantially  increase  the  production  of  non-forest  products.  An \nestimated  100  permanent  jobs  for  the  home-stays,  about  100  jobs  for  the  home-based \nbusinesses, and about 200 jobs for maintaining the conservation forest program on state land \nwill be generated. \n \nIn the project area, the plains area has been earmarked for revenue-generating activities \n54. \nbased on QNBG and the existing Taoist cultural sites. QNBG will generate resources that will be \ntransferred for investment into the sustainable biodiversity management within QBCDA and the \nQinling  Mountains.  QNBG  will  generate  a  significant  number  of  jobs  for  local  residents  in  the \nproject  area  and  the  surrounding  fringe  areas.  Revenue-generating  activities  will  be  planned \nwith  safeguards  to  ensure  that  environmental  pollution  is  managed,  including  solid  waste, \nwastewater,  and  noise  and  air  pollution.  About  10,000  jobs  will  be  created  during  the \nconstruction  phase,  and  an  additional  870  permanent  jobs  will  generated  within  the  related \nagencies. These jobs will be awarded to local inhabitants wherever possible. The quality of life \nfor local inhabitants will be improved through access to safe drinking water, better sanitation and \nwastewater treatment, and biogas systems. \n \nB. \n \n55.  \nFinancial analyses were carried out for the botanical gardens, SARC, and the home-stay \nactivities  in  QBCDA.  The  home-based  businesses  and  the  conservation  forestry  livelihood \nactivities were not financially assessed because (i) the exact nature of the small businesses and \ntheir  scale are  uncertain,  and  (ii)  the  high  proportion  of  public  good benefits  linked  to  habitats \nand  improved  ecological  services  is  long  term  in  nature.  The  botanical  gardens,  SARC,  and \nhome-stays  display  financial  internal  rates  of  return  (FIRRs)  both  before  and  after  tax  that \nexceed  the  weighted  average  cost of  capital.  QNBG  may  lack  liquidity  during  the  construction \nperiod, and the Government has agreed to underwrite this working capital requirement of QNBG \nduring  this  period.  The  before-tax  FIRR  for  QNBG  is  9.5%,  while  the  post-tax  FIRR  is  8% \n(Appendix 11). An FIRR was not calculated for the Project as a whole. \n \nC. \n \n56.   Economic analyses were undertaken for the botanical gardens, SARC, home-stays, and \nthe Project as a whole. The quantified benefit stream was limited to the visitor and revenue data \n\n \nFinancial Analyses \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n(IEE)  has  been  prepared, \n\ninitial  environmental  examination \n\nEnvironmental Benefits and Impacts \n\nfor each, and did not include the contribution to global species management, genetic collections \nfor  biodiversity,  cultural  and  religious  values,  and  scientific  contribution  to  biodiversity \nconservation.  Major  non-quantified  benefits  include  (i)  payment  for  the  establishment  of \nconservation  forestry  on  about  7,000  ha  in  the  mountainous  area  that  will  provide  increased \njobs;  (ii)  shorter  travel  time  because  of  better  road  and  mountain  pathway  access;  (iii)  higher \neconomic  output  derived  from  alternative  livelihoods  through  the  provision  of  about  40  small \nbusiness development grants, about 10 home-stays, and about 100 household biogas systems; \nand (iv) better health from improvements in access to water, alternative sources of energy, and \nreduced  fuelwood  cutting.  No  economic  benefits  were  quantified  for  the  impacts  and  benefits \narising from the profit redistribution to the QBCDA program. The economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) for QNBG including SARC is 13.7%. The EIRR for the home-stay activity is 23.4%. No \nEIRR was calculated for biodiversity management in the mountainous area (output 1) because \nof the public good nature and uncertainty attached to the quantification of benefits. The benefits \nare substantial in terms of potential livelihood and environmental improvements in QBCDA and \nthe wider Qinling Mountains. The quantified EIRR for the total project is 10.9% however, there \nare additional substantial nonquantifiable environmental and other benefits (Appendix 11). \n \nD. \n \nThe Project is classified as category B, according to ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). A \n57.  \nsummary \nincluding  an \nenvironmental  management  plan  and  environmental  monitoring  plan  (Appendix  12).  The \nmajority of the project impacts are environmentally beneficial, including improvements to long-\nterm  biodiversity  conservation  and  sustainability  in  the  Qinling  Mountains.  The  major \nenvironmental benefits include (i) improvement in the welfare of animals in SARC and QBCDA; \n(ii)  advancement  of  science  on  endangered  species  recovery  from  SARC;  (iii)  the  genetic \ncollection  established  at  QNBG;  (iv)  public  awareness  and  education  regarding  the  Qinling \nMountains  and  biodiversity  conservation;  (v)  overall  conservation  of  biodiversity;  (vi) \nimprovement in ecological functions in QBCDA from more and higher-quality forest cover; (vii) \nintangible  benefits  arising  from  the  conservation  of  Taoist  religious  sites;  and  (viii)  better \nenvironmental  quality  through  the  provision  of better  sanitation,  wastewater,  and management \nsystems.  Some  adverse  impacts  may  also  occur,  including  (i)  the  introduction  of  nonnative \nplants  into  the  botanical  garden  with  the  potential  to  become  invasive  species;  and  (ii)  the \ngradual release of faunal species, such as the giant panda and the crested ibis, in the wild. The \npotential impacts have been assessed, and these will be mitigated to acceptable levels.  \n \nE. \n \n58.  \nThe incidence of poverty is over 70% in QBCDA, compared with 23% in the plains area, \nwhere  most  of  the  people  live.  Poverty  in  QBCDA  is  highlighted  by  low  grain  availability  per \ncapita  of  only  198  kilograms  compared  with  422  kilograms  in  the  plains  area.  A  survey  found \nthat QBCDA\u2019s income per capita was about CNY600 in 2007, only 18% of the national average \nand  27%  of  Shaanxi\u2019s  rural  population  average.  The  livelihood  survey  conducted  under  the \ntechnical  assistance 14 found  that  the  stakeholders  had  extremely  limited  human  capital,  as \nreflected in the poor education levels among adults. The habitation in QBCDA are scattered (12 \npersons  per  km2  compared  with  267  per  km2  elsewhere  in  the  project  area)  because  of  the \nmountainous  and  isolated  conditions.  Physical  capital  has  improved  with  the  road  upgrading \nalong  the  Tianyu  River,  but  other  infrastructure  is  virtually  nonexistent  because  the  local \ngovernment  had  encouraged  people  to  move  out  of  the  mountains.  Access  to  formal  banking \nservices is limited because of the lack of security, deposits, and access to banks.

About 1,200 households in QBCDA will receive benefits from \n(i) employment, (ii) opportunities to start small businesses, (iii) forest-use rights with supporting \nconservation  forest  plantings,  and  (iv)  better  access  to  water  supplies  and  alternative  energy \nsources.  About  10,000  jobs  will  be  created  during  project  construction,  with  an  additional  870 \nfrom  more  ecotourism  and  economic \ndirectly  employed \ndevelopment. The shift into forest-based livelihoods will provide long-term benefits.  \n \nF. \n \nGender  roles  are  determined  by  a  combination  of  cultural  factors,  environmental \n59. \nconditions,  education  levels,  and  jobs.  In  the  project  area,  income  inequities  create  incentives \nfor rural workers to migrate to urban labor markets. However, because it is close to good roads \nand  to  county  towns,  female  laborers\u2014particularly  young  women\u2014share  the  available \nopportunities with men for off-farm jobs. Agricultural feminization is only slight in the developed \ncommercial and agricultural area. Young people in QBCDA tend to be mobile, and the group left \nbehind  is  older.  In  general,  the  Project  will  benefit  women  significantly  and  will  not  have  an \nadverse impact on women or children. Women will benefit from the ecotourism facilities, and will \nhave greater access to information and jobs, and more opportunities for starting small income-\ngeneration  activities.  They  will  get  jobs  during  the  construction  of  QNBG.  As  part  of  the \nparticipation  strategy,  women  will  be  prioritized  for  direct  and  indirect  project  benefits  and  for \nprotection against social risks. Special gender measures have been included in the resettlement \nplans.  Gender-disaggregated  indicators  will  be  monitored  in  the  PPMS.  The  Project  will  not \nhave significant negative impacts on women, and they will participate equally in project activities \nand  have  equal  opportunities  for  access  to  social  services,  training,  employment,  land \nrelocation, and beneficiary agreements. \n \nG. \n \n60.   A summary resettlement plan has been prepared (Appendix 14). For the construction of \nQNBG,  19.6  ha  of  land  will  be  permanently  acquired.  The  land  acquisition  will  affect  115 \nhouseholds  with  504  people.  The  houses  of  143  households  with  617  people  totaling  19,319 \nsquare meters will be demolished, and these people will be relocated nearby in the same village \nof  Dianzhen.  QNBG  will  pay  compensation  of  about  CNY28.9  million,  including  taxes  and \nmanagement fees. QNBG will also lease the land-use rights for an additional 249.7 ha, affecting \nabout  3,780  people  in  948  households  (i.e.,  the  entire  village  population).  The  village  and  the \nhouseholds  will  continue  to  own  this  land.  QNBG  will  sign  land-lease  agreements  with  the \naffected  groups  of  Dianzhen  village  to  establish  a  50-year  land-use  right  for  the  botanical \ngardens.  QNBG  will  make  fixed  annual  payments  to  affected  households  for  50  years,  plus \nannual  payments  based  on  gate  revenues  or  profit  when  the  botanical  garden  becomes \noperational. The improved village and forest-based livelihood improvement programs in QBCDA \nwill  be  implemented  with  the  16  villages  on  a  voluntary  basis.  No  adverse  impacts  are \nanticipated, but QNBG has assured the livelihoods of local inhabitants will be safeguarded.  \n \n61.  \nThe upgrading and expansion of SARC will use an additional 1,008 ha of land, but most \nalready belong to LFF. Only 9 ha need to be acquired permanently from three villages for the \nconstruction of the Crested Ibis Center (2 ha), the Golden Monkey Center (3 ha), and the Giant \nPanda Breeding and Research Center (4 ha). The land acquisition will affect 30 households with \n125  people;  2.9  ha  of  land  is  dry  farmland,  5.5  ha  is  sloped  land,  and  0.6  ha  irrigated  land. \nQNBG will pay compensation of CNY13.6 million to the affected villages.  \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\nH. \n \n62.   Construction  delays  will  place  significant  pressure  on  the  cash  flow  of  QNBG. \nRecognizing  this  risk,  the  SPG  has  committed  to  underwrite  the  cash  flow  with  counterpart \nfunds.  Weak  management  and  poor  operation  of  the  proposed  investments  will  threaten  the \nfinancial  viability  of  QNBG,  which  is  currently  assessed  as  adequate  but  not  strong.  All  of  the \nagencies consolidated into QNBG, including the Shaanxi Qinling Botanical Garden, SARC, and \nthe  LFF,  have  many  years  of  biodiversity  project  experience.  QNBG  is  well  staffed  with \nexperienced  and  qualified  personnel.  The  challenge  for  QNBG  will  be  to  work  together  to \neffectively  manage  all  project  activities  related  to  habitat  restoration,  species  regeneration, \nbotanical gardens, SARC, ecotourism, and income-generating activities for poor residents in the \nmountainous and plains areas. The SPG has agreed to strengthen QNBG with additional staff, \nstart-up  funds,  and  sufficient  staff  training.  QNBG  will  undergo  institutional  strengthening \nthrough  the  use  of  consulting  services,  as  well  as  the  recruitment  of  expert  and  experienced \nstaff  in  biodiversity  conservation,  ecotourism  promotion,  management,  and  engineering.  The \nfinancial  sustainability  of  QNBG  and  the  Project  will  be  ensured  through  the  generation  of \necotourism revenue sufficient to meet all projected operation and maintenance costs, plus the \nexpansion  of  biodiversity  conservation  activities  in  the  Qinling  Mountains.  The  design  of  the \nProject  has  factored  in  potential  risks  from  invasive  species  and  poor  animal  welfare  by \nintroducing  international  expertise  and  limiting  QNBG  to  plant  species  from  the  Qinling \nMountains. The risks of food supply shortages and price increases because of the resettlement \nof affected farmers in the plains area are considered minimal, even in local village markets. The \nrisks  associated  with  agricultural  or  other  encroachment  on  forest  land  are  also  considered \nminimal. QNBG is adequately staffed to enforce regulations regarding encroachment on forest \nland, and will employ local residents as forest monitors and ecotourism guides. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n63.  \nfollowing assurances that have been incorporated into the legal documents: \n \n\nIn addition to standard assurances, the Government, the SPG, and the IA have given the \n\nCounterpart  financing.

The  SPG  and  the  IA  will  cause  the  contractors  involved  in \nthe  project  implementation  to  maximize  the  employment  of  local  poor  people, \nincluding  affected  persons  who  meet  the  job  and  efficiency  requirements  for \nemployment.  Such  workers  will  be  provided  with  adequate  on-the-job  training. \nSPG  will  monitor  the  project  impact  on  poverty  and  submit  annual  monitoring \nreports to ADB during project implementation. \n\nEnvironment. The SPG will cause the IA to construct, maintain, and operate the \nproject  facilities  in  strict  conformity  to  (a)  all  applicable  national  and  local \nlaws,  regulations,  and  procedures;  (b)  ADB\u2019s \ngovernment  environmental \nEnvironment  Policy;  and  (c)  the  environmental  mitigation  and  monitoring \nmeasures set out in their environment impact assessments for the Project.  \n\nEnvironment  monitoring  plan.  The  SPG  will  ensure  that  the  IA  (a)  allocates \nsufficient  resources  to  implement  the  environmental  monitoring  plan;  and  (b) \nprovides monitoring reports to the PMO, which will coordinate the preparation of \na  semiannual  environmental  report  on  the  implementation  of  the  environmental \nmonitoring plan in a format acceptable to ADB for the duration of the Project. \n\nLabor standards. The SPG and the IA will ensure that under the Project all the \nemployment and labor standards provided in the applicable laws and regulations \nof  the  Government  are  complied  with,  and  in  particular,  that  all  civil  works \ncontractors engaged under the Project (a) provide timely payment of wages on at \nleast  a  monthly  basis  and  safe  working  conditions  to  all  workers,  with  such \nrequirements  being  included  in  the  civil  works  contracts  and  monitored  by  the \nconstruction  supervision  consultants;  (b)  provide  employment  opportunity  to \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\n \n(viii) \n\n \n(ix) \n\nwomen  and  ethnic  minorities,  where  appropriate,  and  pay  equal  wages  to  the \nmale  and  female  employees  for  equivalent  works;  and  (c)  do  not  employ  child \nlabor in the project works. \n\nGender  and  development.

\n\n27\n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS AND LESSONS LEARNED \n\nIntroduction \n\nBiodiversity Conservation \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe  goal  of  the  biodiversity  program  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  is  the \nconservation of biodiversity that provides its people a fair and equitable share of benefits from a \nbetter  utilization  of  generic  resources.  However,  increasing  population  pressures,  cultural \ntraditions, and economic development have degraded the PRC\u2019s biological resources. The large \npopulation  combined  with  limited  land  and  water  resources  have  caused  extensive  loss  of \nhabitats  to  meet  the  growing  needs  for  housing,  infrastructure,  farming,  logging,  fuelwood \ncollection,  and  livestock  grazing.  These  problems  are  also  characteristic  of  the  Qinling \nMountains. As a result, 804 species in the PRC are on the International Union for Conservation \nof Nature list of globally-threatened species. Of these, 442 are plants and 362 are animals. The \nPRC\u2019s own Red Data Book of threatened species includes a much larger total.  \n \nB. \n \nThe project area and the Qinling Mountains have three types of protected areas: nature \n2. \nreserves,  forest  reserves,  and  ecological  function  conservation  areas.  The  Qinling  Mountains \nhas 27 nature reserves and forest reserves, and one ecological function conservation area. The \nnature  reserves  cover  557,298  hectares  (ha)  or  nearly  10%  of  the  total  of  5  million  ha.  The \nShaanxi Forest Bureau, with support from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), planned and \nestablished  the  reserve  network  for  giant  pandas.  It  includes  five  well-established  nature \nreserves,  nine  recently-established  nature  reserves,  five  corridors,  and  five  planned  nature \nreserves. While the protected area system in the Qinling Mountains is excellent in its coverage \nof  the  upper  elevations,  the  lower  slopes  that  support  forests  and  provide  winter  habitats  for \nmany  species,  including  the  giant  panda  and  the  golden  takin,  have  little  protection. 1  The \ndifficulty in protecting the lower slopes is that they have been settled and farmed for centuries. \nThe Project addresses the need to protect lower elevation habitats of the Qinling Mountains. \n \n3. \nIn  March  2002,  WWF  launched  its  Qinling  Giant  Panda  Project  to  protect  the  giant \npandas  and  their  habitats  in  the  Qinling  Mountains.  The  Qinling  panda  population  includes \nabout 300 pandas that are geographically and genetically isolated from other panda populations \nin Gansu and Sichuan provinces. Similar to the Asian Development Bank\u2013Global Environment \nFacility  (GEF)  project,  the  WWF  panda  project  seeks  balance  between  conservation  and \ndevelopment. WWF involves private sector investors to fund the development of new industries, \nactivities, and livelihoods for villagers to reduce or eliminate human-caused pressures on panda \nhabitats.  WWF\u2019s  panda  project  plans  to  achieve  a  10%  increase  in  the  Qinling  giant  panda \npopulation by 2012, and a 20% increase in the area of protected panda habitats.  \n \n4. \nThe World Bank\u2013GEF China Nature Reserve Management Project began in 1995 and \nwas  completed  in  2002.  The  project  focused  on  nature  reserves  of  Poyang  Lake  in  Jiangxi, \nShengnongjia in Hubei, Wuyi Mountain in Fujian, Xishuangbanna in Yunnan; nature reserves of \nChangqing,  Foping,  Niubeiliang,  Taibaishan,  and  Zhouzhi  in  the  Qinling  Mountains,  Shaanxi; \nand  Wuyishan  nature  reserve  in  Jiangxi,  and  Changqing  Forestry  Bureau  in  Shaanxi.  This \nproject  drew  on  project experiences  from  other countries  under  the  GEF  pilot  phase  and  from \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs). The Project draws on the following related lessons from \n\n                                                 \n1  Li Diqiang, Song Yangling, and Ouyang Zhiyun. 2003.

The community participation program supported under the Project incorporates \nlessons  learned  from  several  ongoing  pilot  activities  in  the  PRC  managed  by  NGOs  and  the \nGovernment, particularly (i) the importance of integrating local villagers into the assessment of \ncommunity needs through participatory rural appraisal techniques; and (ii) the need to establish \nclear, mutually-agreed contracts that identify the respective rights and responsibilities of nature \nreserve staff and local communities in resource use.  \n \nThe World Bank-financed Sustainable Forestry Development Project3 was approved in \n5. \n2002 and will be completed in 2009. It has three components: (i) plantation establishment, (ii) \nnatural  forests  management,  and  (iii)  protected  area  management.  GEF  and  Europe  Aid \nprovided cofinancing grants. Important lessons included the following: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\nforestry needs to be fully integrated into land-use planning;  \nsuccessful management is only possible with a defined and enforced permanent \nforest area;  \ndecisions  on  forest  management  must  take  into  account  the  interests  of  all \nstakeholders; \nall  management  options  for  forests,  even  total  protection,  have  financial  and \neconomic  costs;  the  options  selected  must  have  long-term  financial  and \neconomic sustainability;  \nalternative  resource  control  systems,  such  as  decentralization  and  co-\nmanagement  with  government  agencies,  local  communities,  the  private  sector, \nNGOs, and others, should be supported;  \neffective  policy  analysis  and  development  should  be  prioritized,  because  policy \nand  market  failures  have  been  more  serious  than  technical  problems  of  forest \nmanagement, silviculture, and conservation;  \nsupport  for  commercial  forestry  plantation  development  should  continue  to \nreduce pressure on natural forests and expand domestic wood supply; and \nthe GEF program should be expanded, because biodiversity resources warrant a \nlarger share of international support than is currently received. \n\nThreats to Biodiversity Conservation \n\n \nC. \n \nGeneral  threats  to  biodiversity  in  the  Qinling  Mountains  were  identified  in  19984 as  (i) \n6. \nintensive commercial timber harvesting near nature reserves, (ii) agricultural encroachment, (iii) \nillegal harvesting of natural resources, (iv) fragmentation of nature reserves by construction of \nnational highways and reduced potential for gene exchange, and (v) unregulated development \nof  tourism.  In  1998,  logging  was  banned  in  natural  forests  nationwide.  While  this  stopped \ncommercial logging (except in forest plantations), it did not regulate household use of timber for \nconstruction,  cooking,  and/or  heating.  Extensive  household  use  of  timber  remains  a  threat  to \nnature reserves nationwide, because villagers live within or near all nature reserves.

Some of the Main Problems of the Qinling \n\n(Loan 709-MAL). \n\nNature Reserves and Managing Strategies. Chinese Biodiversity 6(4):312\u2013315. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3        29 \n\nencroachment  onto  forest  lands  began  in  modern  times,  as  population  pressures  pushed \nfarmers  further  into  the  mountains  in  search  of  arable  lands.  Farming  on  the  steep  slopes \ncaused soil erosion that washed away valuable soils and choked waterways. The Government \ninstituted  the  Sloping  Land  Conversion  Program  (or  \u201cGrain  for  Green\u201d  program)  beginning  in \n2000.  The  program  provides  grain,  cash,  and  saplings  to  farmers  who  convert  their  steep \nsloping farmlands to grassland or woodland.5 The program has been implemented on 600,000\u2013\n800,000 ha in the Qinling Mountains. To counter the other threats, strategies were proposed to \n(i)  establish  co-management  with  villagers  living  in  and  around  nature  reserves;  (ii)  establish \nbiological corridors to counter the impacts of highways and railways; (iii) restrict illegal entry by \nvillagers and livestock, and blockage of wildlife movements by fences installed to protect natural \nforests; (iv) improve the management of ecotourism; and (v) diversify village enterprises. \n \nEach  of  these  strategies  has  been  implemented  to  some  extent.  Co-management  is \n7. \nnow  standard  operating  procedure  in  Taibaishan  and  Foping  nature  reserves  in  the  Qinling \nMountains,  and  seems  to  be  working  well.  The  impact  of  these  co-management  policies  has \nbeen  that  the  villagers  now  consider  protection  of  nature  reserves  and  natural  resources  not \nonly  as  their  right  and  responsibility  but  also  their  most  reliable  means  of  achieving  higher \nstandards  of  living.  Biological  corridors  have  been  established  in  part  by  an  aggressive \ncampaign  by  the  Government  and  WWF  to  establish  new  nature  reserves.  Two  significant \nissues appear to remain with respect to links between critical habitats. These are reforestation \nprojects of the 1950s and 1960s that involved two nonnative species of larch (Japanese Larch \nLarix kampfera and North China Larch Larix princi), which have grown in mono-species stands \nthat block natural colonization by other species. The result is large expanses of forest that lack \nunderstory vegetation and have little floristic diversity. These are referred to as \u201cgreen deserts\u201d \nby ecologists because, from a distance, they appear as beautiful natural forests, but on closer \ninspection,  they  are  ecologically  barren.  The  inability  of  bamboo  and  other  plants  to  colonize \nthese plantations precludes their use by pandas and many other species. The exotic trees were \nplanted  to  compensate  for  prior  excesses  in  timber  exploitation,  but  now  stand  in  the  way  of \neffective nature conservation. The second outstanding issue related to links between habitats is \nthe  growing  number  of  highways  and  railways  through  the  Qinling  Mountains,  especially  the \nassociated  chain-link  fences  that  restrict  animal  movements  and  migration  for  giant  pandas, \nclouded leopards, and golden takins. Resolution of this issue might require a combination of (i) \nmodification  of  the  fences,  (ii)  construction  of  wildlife  underpasses  and  overpasses,  and  (iii) \nstronger management of those nature reserves alongside rail and road corridors. \n \n8. \nVirtually all stakeholders in the PRC conservation note that funding is seldom adequate \nfor anything more than paying salaries. Nature reserves in the PRC receive about one-eighth of \nthe world's average budget allocation per unit area ($113 vs. $893 per square kilometer [km2]), \nand even less than the average allocation for reserves in developing countries ($157 per km2). \nProvincial  and  local  reserves  receive  even  less  ($57  per  km2).  In  general,  nature  reserves \nreceive  government  funding  for  about  one-third  of  their  spending  requirements  only.  The \nbalance  must  be  met  by  entrepreneurial  efforts  that  are  often  antagonistic  to  the  conservation \nmandate of the reserves. Regulation of tourism is needed to ensure that natural resources are \nnot further degraded in the interest of economic gain. \n \n\n                                                 \n5  Xu Jintao, E.

Such \nadvertisement  will  be  made  in  sufficient  time  for  prospective  bidders  to  obtain \nprequalification  or  bidding  documents,  and  prepare  and  submit  their  responses.  In  any \nevent, a minimum preparation period of 30 days will be given. The preparation period will \ncount  (a)  from  the  date  of  advertisement,  or  (b)  when  the  documents  are  available  for \nissue,  whichever  date  is  later.  The  advertisement,  and  the  prequalification  and  bidding \ndocuments will specify the deadline for such submission. \nQualification  requirements  of  bidders  and  the  method  of  evaluating  the  qualification  of \neach  bidder  will  be  specified  in  detail  in  the  bidding  documents,  and  in  the \nprequalification documents if the bidding is preceded by a prequalification process. \nIf bidding is preceded by a prequalification process, all bidders that meet the qualification \ncriteria set out in the prequalification document will be allowed to bid and no limit will be \nplaced on the number of prequalified bidders. \nAll  bidders  will  be  required  to  provide  a  performance  security  sufficient  to  protect  the \nExecuting  Agency  in  case  of  breach  of  contract  by  the  contractor,  and  the  bidding \ndocuments will specify the required form and amount of such performance security. \nBidders will be allowed to submit bids by mail or by hand. \nAll  bids  will  be  opened  in  public;  all  bidders  (either  in  person  or  their  representatives) \nmay attend the bid opening, but are not required to be present. \nAll  bid  evaluation  criteria  will  be  disclosed  in  the  bidding  documents  and  quantified  in \nmonetary terms or expressed in the form of pass or fail requirements. \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  No  bid  will  be  rejected  solely  on  the  basis  that  the  bid  price  falls  outside  any  standard \ncontract  estimate,  margin,  or  bracket  of  average  bids  established  by  the  Project \nExecuting Agency. \nEach  contract  will  be  awarded  to  the  lowest  evaluated  responsive  bidder,  that  is,  the \nbidder who meets the appropriate standards of capability and resources and whose bid \nhas  been  determined  (a)  to  be  substantially  responsive  to  the  bidding  documents,  and \n(b)  to  offer  the  lowest  evaluated  cost.  The  winning  bidder  will  not  be  required,  as  a \ncondition  of  award,  to  undertake  responsibilities  for  work  not  stipulated  in  the  bidding \ndocuments or otherwise to modify the bid as originally submitted. \nEach  contract  financed  by  the  loan  proceeds  will  provide  that  the  suppliers  and \ncontractors will permit ADB, at its request, to inspect their accounts and records relating \nto  the  performance  of  the  contract  and  to  have  said  accounts  and  records  audited  by \nauditors appointed by ADB. \nGovernment-owned enterprises in the Borrower\u2019s country may be permitted to bid if they \ncan  establish  that  they  (a)  are  legally  and  financially  autonomous,  (b) operate  under \ncommercial law, and (c) are not a dependent agency of the Project Executing Agency. \n\n(xi) \n\n(x) \n\n(xii)  Rebidding will not be allowed solely because the number of bids is less than three. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10            \n39\n\n \n\n \nA. \n\nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES \n\nPackage  A:  Shaanxi  Animal  Rescue  Center  Species  Expert  Team  (6  positions,  1 \nperson-month each) \n\n \n1. \nPackage  A  will  be  contracted  directly  by  the  Qinling  National  Biological  Garden\u2019s \nShaanxi  Animal  Rescue  Center  (SARC)  division  as  individual  consultants  using  the  Global \nEnvironment Facility grant.

The \nProject  has  three  components.  The  first  component  supports  a  number  of  activities  in  the \nprotected  biodiversity  area  called  the  Qinling  Biological  Conservation  and  Demonstration  Area \n(QBCDA)  and  the  wider  Qinling  Mountains,  including  (i)  habitat  reestablishment  and \nendangered  species  management  for  which  project  costs  have  been  estimated  and  benefits \nassessed  in  qualitative  terms;  and  (ii)  support  for  residents  to  transition  to  new  and  more \nsustainable  livelihood  options,  including  home-stay  ventures,  road  and  mountain  pathway \nimprovement, small family-based business development, and the creation of rights to collective \nforest  land  to  be  planted  into  analog  forest  systems.  Project  costs  have  been  estimated  and \nbenefits estimated for representative businesses related to essential oils, medicinal plants, and \nthe home-stays. No benefits have been quantified for the shorter transport and travel times, and \nimproved  water  and  energy  supplies.  The  second  component  provides  support  to  biodiversity \nconservation.  The  Implementing  Agency  is  the  Qinling  National  Botanical  Garden  (QNBG), \nwhich  will  develop  the  botanical  garden  and  also  consolidate  the  Shaanxi  Animal  Rescue \nCenter  (SARC)  and  QBCDA.  For  QNBG,  project,  financial,  and  economic  costs  and  benefits \nhave been assessed based on the associated revenue receipts. The third component includes \nproject  management  support  for  (i)  institutional  arrangements,  (ii)  institutional  strengthening, \nand  (iii)  conservation  replication  and  awareness.  The  first  two  subcomponents  are  treated  as \noverhead,  while  the  third  is  a  public  good  and  global-value  set  that  is  assessed  only  in \nqualitative terms. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  economic  and  financial  analyses  are  in  constant  2009  prices.  The  project  life  is \ncalculated to end in 2035. For the financial analysis, a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) \nof  2.6%  is  used.  The  financial  analysis  is  based  on  cash  items  with  noncash  items,  such  as \ndepreciation and amortization of intangible assets, separated from operating costs. Most of the \nfinancial  analyses  are  based  on  the  net  cash  flow  before  the  payment  of  corporate  tax  to \nremove  the  influence  of  differing  taxes  based  on  the  overall  tax  position  of  each  enterprise. \nDomestic  price  escalations  are  assumed  to  be  0.8%  for  2009,  1.0%  for  2010,  1.5%  for  2011, \n2.0% for 2012, and 2.0% for 2013 onwards; while international price escalations are assumed to \nbe 1.9% for 2009, 1.0% for 2010,  0.0% for 2011, 0.3% for 2012, and 0.5% for 2013 onwards. \nPhysical  contingencies  are  (i)  5%  for  civil  works,  materials,  surveys,  and  studies;  (ii)  10%  for \nresettlement costs; and (iii) 2% for training. The economic analysis uses the domestic price level \n(not the world price level) as the numeraire or reference point for converting financial prices into \neconomic  prices.  Financial  prices  were  converted  to  economic  prices  by  removing  taxes, \nsubsidies, and market distortions. Sales taxes were removed from operating costs and/or cash \noutflow  and  a  factor  of  0.95  was  applied  to  the  nonwage  purchases  of  the  revenue-earning \nentities. This is consistent with a sales tax rate of about 5%. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.8 \nhas been applied to casual and unskilled labor costs. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 was \nused  for  construction,  and  botanical  tree  and  garden  planting  costs.  Upgrading  of  road  and \nmountain pathways used a standard conversion factor of 0.84 for casual labor. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nIn addition to the quantified benefits that have been incorporated into the financial and \neconomic assessments, the Project will generate many benefits that have not been quantified. \nMost of these benefits fall into two major categories: (i) environmental and ecosystem benefits; \nand  (ii)  quality  of  life,  cultural,  religious,  and  heritage  values.  Together,  these  are  significant \n\nProject Assessment \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nbenefits  that  add  further  justification  for  the  Project,  whose  primary  impact  is  to  develop \nsustainable  conservation  of  biodiversity.  Included  in  these  categories  are  (i)  benefits  accruing \nfrom  the  improvements  in  the  welfare  of  animals  in  SARC  and  in  QBCDA;  (ii)  benefits  from \nendangered-species recovery from SARC; (iii) benefits from the genetic collection established at \nQNBG;  (iv)  benefits  arising  from  public  awareness  and  education  with  respect  to  the  Qinling \nMountains and biodiversity conservation; (v) benefits in the overall conservation of biodiversity; \n(vi)  improvement  in  ecological  functions  in  QBCDA  from  more  and  higher-quality  forest  cover; \n(vii)  intangible  benefits  arising  from  the  conservation  of  Taoist  religious  sites;  and  (viii) \nimprovements  in  environmental  quality  through  the  provision  of  better  sanitation,  wastewater, \nand  management  systems.  Further  tangible  but  not  quantified  benefits  are  generated  for  the \ncurrent  4,600  residents  of  QBCDA.  These  include  (i)  payment  for  the  establishment  of \nconservation forestry over 7,000 hectares that will provide jobs; (ii) shorter travel time because \nof  improved  road  and  mountain  pathway  access;  (iii)  higher  economic  output  derived  from \nalternative livelihoods, as represented by medicinal plants, essential oils, biogas systems, and \nhome-stay  tourism;  and  (iv)  better  health  from  improvement  in  access  to  water,  alternative \nsources of energy, and reduced fuel wood cutting. \n \n\n1. \n\nComponent  1:  Participatory  Biodiversity  Management  in  the  Mountainous \nArea \n\n \n4. \nThe Project will gradually improve the population of endangered flora and fauna species \nin  QBCDA  by  increasing  mixed  forest  coverage  and  creating  the  incentives  for  species \nregeneration.  Forest  expansion  and  improved  management  will  also  reduce  soil  degradation \nand erosion. The production of non-timber forest products that increases forest pathways will be \nimproved.  Local  communities  in  QBCDA  are  keen  to  participate  in  the  Project  and  assist  with \nforest management and species regeneration. They are also eager to improve livelihoods and \nquality  of  life  through  ecotourism  home-stays  and  village  development  planning.  Community-\nbased ecotourism home stays for medium- to high-value clients will be developed to support the \ngrowing  demand  for  overnight  accommodation  in  wild  or  natural  environments.  The  financial \nanalysis indicates a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of 19.1% for a 4-room home-stay that \nwill employ 8\u201310 people full time. The financial model assumes 40% occupancy, increasing to \n50% after 10 years, and stabilizing at that level with an average tariff per night of CNY150. The \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  a  single  home-stay  is  23.4%,  indicating  that  the \nhome-stay  is  economically  justified.  Community  infrastructure,  including  17.5  kilometers  of \nroads along the Tianyu River and about 100 kilometers of mountain pathways, will be upgraded \nto  reduce  travel  times  and  ensure  access  during  adverse  weather.  No  estimates  have  been \nmade  of  the  time  savings.  Grants  are  proposed  for  either  villages  or  households  to  develop \nsocial infrastructure, especially alternative energy sources (biogas and solar) and water supply \nschemes. The benefits have not been quantified. \n \n5. \nThe  investment  in  component  1  is  estimated  to  generate  about  10,000  jobs  during  the \nconstruction  phase  of  the  Project,  and  about  450  from  2015.  These  levels  of  employment  are \nsignificant  and  suggest  that  close  to  33%  of  QBCDA  households  could  receive  an  additional \nwage after the construction period. Equally important, the conservation forestry program could \naffect  more  than  70%  of  QBCDA  households  through  participation  in  planting  programs  and \nobtaining secure tenure to collective forests.  \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Enhanced Biodiversity Conservation in the Plains Area \n\n \nQNBG will derive its revenue from the botanical garden division and the SARC division. \n6. \nIt  will  generate  total  revenue  of  CNY127.5  million  by  2015,  and  CNY250  million  by  2025. \nBenefits  were  estimated  based  on  a  visitor  profile  for  the  botanical  garden,  starting  from  the \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11        45 \n\ncurrent level of 350,000 and increasing at an average rate of 5.3% over the life of the analysis. \nFor SARC, the visitors are projected to start from 280,000, and grow at 15% per year. The total \nnumber of visitors is expected to reach about 800,000 by 2013, which is a conservative estimate \ngiven  the  higher  rates  of  growth  for  tourism,  including  ecotourism  in  Shaanxi  province.  Entry \nfees of CNY50 per visitor were used in the analysis.  \n \n7. \nThe  FIRR  for  the  QNBG  division  is  9.5%  before  tax  and  8.0%  after  tax.  Sensitivity \nanalysis  was  conducted  on  the  financial  rates  of  returns  for  shifts  in  revenue  and  costs,  and \nfound to be robust (Table A11.1). The EIRR of the QNBG division was estimated to be 10.9%. \nThe EIRR is sensitive to the movement in revenue and costs (Table A11.2). Given the difficulty \nin  revenue  forecasting,  a  careful  reassessment  of  the  investment  and  the  underlying \nassumptions  is  needed.  A  conservative  estimate  was  taken  for  visitor  numbers.  The  QNBG \ndivision is a viable investment, but the risk of commercial failure during the first 5\u201310 years is \nconsiderable.  Experienced  commercial  management,  cost  reviews,  and  more  market  research \nare important risk management strategies. \n \n\nTable A11.1: Qinling National Botanical Garden Division Financial Sensitivity Analysis \nFinancial Internal Rate of Return (%) \n\nItem \n\nBase Case \nInvestment Cost and Implementation Delay (10% increase) \nEcotourism Revenue (10% decrease) \n   Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nItem \nBase Case \nInvestment Cost and Implementation Delay (10% increase) \nInvestment Cost (20% increase) \nEcotourism Revenue (10% decrease) \n\nBefore Tax \n\n9.5 \n8.7 \n8.0 \n\nAfter Tax \n8.0 \n7.2 \n6.6 \n\n10.9 \n10.0 \n9.4 \n9.3 \n\nTable A11.2: Qinling National Botanical Garden Division Economic Sensitivity Analysis \nEconomic Internal Rate of Return (%) \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n \n8. \nFor the SARC division, the FIRR was estimated to be 16% before tax and 13.5% after \ntax, both of which are well above the WACC. The income transfer to QBCDA based on 8% of \nthe net profit will produce a contribution of $160,000 in 2013 and reduces the post-tax FIRR to \n12.75%.  The  financial  viability  was  found  to  be  robust  under  scenarios  involving  up  to  30% \nmovement of current projections (Table A11.3). Strengthening management will reduce the risks \nattached to the operation of SARC. The EIRR of SARC is 17.9%, based on the net cash flow for \n\u201cwith  project\u201d  and  \u201cwithout  project\u201d  scenarios.  The  EIRR  was  found  to  be  robust  up  to  20% \nmovement in either the costs or revenue streams. Given the conservative visitor numbers, the \ninvestment as forecast is considered to be economically feasible (Table A11.4). \n\n \nTable A11.3: Shaanxi Animal Rescue Center Financial Sensitivity Analysis \n\nItem \n\nBase Case \nInvestment Cost (30% increase) \nEcotourism Revenue (30% decrease) \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return (%) \n\nBefore Tax  \n16.0 \n13.6 \n10.5 \n\nAfter Tax  \n13.5 \n11.5 \n8.7 \n\n                       Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nTable A11.4: Shaanxi Animal Rescue Center Economic Sensitivity Analysis \nItem \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return (%) \n\nBase Case \nInvestment Cost (40% increase) \nEcotourism Revenue (20% decrease) \nEcotourism Revenue (30% decrease) \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n17.9 \n14.5 \n13.6 \n11.8 \n\n \n \nThe combined QNBG divisions have an estimated FIRR of 12.1% before tax and 10.2% \n9. \nafter  tax.

These benefits do not include the intangible benefits linked \nto  species  conservation,  awareness  and  education,  and  the  scientific  knowledge  to  be \ndeveloped  from  QNBG  and  SARC.  The  beneficiaries  include  the  domestic  and  international \ntourists  who  will  visit  the  ecotourism  sites  and  enjoy  the  facilities  and  services,  and  will  learn \nmore  about  the  Qinling  Mountains  resources,  history,  culture,  and  religions.  The  target \nbeneficiaries  within  the  project  area  will  receive  jobs  generated  by  constructing  and  operating \nthe  facilities.  The  EIRR  was  found  to  be  robust  up  to  30%  movement  in  either  the  costs  or \nrevenue  streams,  and  the  investment  as  forecast  is  considered  to  be  economically  feasible \n(Table A11.7). \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11        47 \n\nTable A11.6: Economic Cash Flows for Consolidated Qinling National Botanical Garden  \n(CNY million) \n2011 \n\n2016\u20132025 \n\n2015 \n\n2014 \n\n2009 \n\n2008 \n\n2012 \n\n2013 \n\n2010 \n\nDivision \n\nQNBG \nSARC  \nConsolidated QNBG \nEIRR \n\n(93) \n(34) \n(127) \n13.7%\n\n(243) \n(82) \n(326) \n  \n\n(29) \n(107) \n(137) \n  \n\n(3) \n2 \n(2) \n  \n\n22 \n20 \n42 \n  \n\n27 \n29 \n56 \n  \n\n22 \n32 \n55 \n  \n\n28 \n39 \n67 \n  \n\n28 \n39 \n67 \n\n \n\n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, QNBG = Qinling National Botanical Garden, SARC = \nShaanxi Animal Rescue Center. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nItem \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return (%) \n\nTable A11.7: Economic Sensitivity Analysis \n\nBase Case \nInvestment Cost and Implementation Delay (10% increase) \nInvestment Cost (20% increase) \nEcotourism Revenue (10% decrease) \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n13.7 \n12.6 \n11.8 \n11.7 \n\n3. \n\nSummary of Project Assessment \n\n \n11. \nThe Project results in significant economic and environmental benefits. Indirect benefits \ninclude the supply of goods and services by local businesses and households, and contracts to \nvillage groups and small businesses to conduct biodiversity conservation activities. Another set \nof benefits is the value that people place on improvements to the Qinling Mountains. To some \ndegree, these benefits can be quantified and given monetary values through willingness-to-pay \nsurveys and through the donations that private individuals, foundations, corporations, and other \ngroups  may  provide  to  accelerate  government  and  international  efforts  to  restore  the  Qinling \nMountains.  \n \n12. \nThe  estimated  EIRR  for  the  whole  project  is  10.9%.  The  EIRR  is  sensitive  to  price \nchanges.  Additional  nonquantifiable  benefits  relating  to  biodiversity  conservation,  ecological \nfunction improvement, and rural livelihoods benefits are significant and will further increase the \noverall  economic  performance.  The  investment  is  considered  economically  feasible  and \nenvironmentally sound, and these benefits will make the EIRR for the entire Project within the \nacceptable range. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n48 \n\nAppendix 12            \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\n1. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environment  safeguard  category  B.  This  summary  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (SIEE)  was  prepared  based  on  the  Qinling  National  Botanical \nGarden  (QNBG)  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  report1 prepared  in  accordance  with \nthe  regulations  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  These  reports  comply  with  Asian \nDevelopment Bank requirements for category B projects. \n \nA. \n\nProject Description \n\n2. \nThe project area is on the northern slope of the Qinling Mountains, about 45 kilometers \n(km)  from  Xi'an,  comprising  an  area  of  458  square  kilometers  with  about  20,400  people.  The \nQinling Mountains is an internationally-important biodiversity hot spot and represents about 70% \nof  the  PRC\u2019s  biodiversity,  including  an  estimated  300  giant  pandas.  The  Qinling  Mountains  is \ncentral to soil and water management linked to the Yangtze and Yellow rivers. The Project will \nimprove  biodiversity  conservation  and  management  by  restoring  forest  habitat,  improving \nendangered  species  management,  and  providing  sustainable  livelihoods  for  the  population  of \nthe project area, and demonstrating the benefits to the rest of the Qinling Mountains and other \nsimilar  areas  in  the  PRC.  The  Project  will  provide  significant  environmental,  economic,  and \nsocial  benefits  throughout  the  project  area.  The  Project  will  address  underlying  causes  and \neffects of historical and contemporary resource degradation. It will have three primary outputs: \n(i)  participatory  biodiversity  management  in  the  mountainous  area,  (ii)  enhanced  biodiversity \nconservation  in  the  plains  area,  and  (iii)  improved  project  management.  Using  sustainable \nfinancing  mechanisms  for  biodiversity  conservation,  the  habitat  of  the  protected  area,  Qinling \nBiological Conservation and Demonstration Area (QBCDA), will be improved to promote mixed \nforest  coverage,  and  flora  and  fauna  species  expansion.  The  small  population  that  lives  in \nscattered  settlements  in  QBCDA  will  be  encouraged  to  support  biodiversity  conservation \nobjectives and stop unsustainable farming and other activities. \n \nPlains Area. This area consists of a 2-km wide strip of predominantly flat land along the \n3. \nnorth side of the Qinling Mountains that is developed for ecotourism, agricultural, and residential \npurposes. The population is about 15,800. The Project will support the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nQNBG.  The  activities  proposed  under  this  subcomponent  include  building  18 \nspecialized  gardens  and  other  infrastructure,  covering  about  269  hectares  (ha); \none  greenhouse  of  600  square  meters  (m2);  two  main  exhibition  halls;  and \nresearch  facilities  and  infrastructure,  including  irrigation  system,  drinking  water \nsupply,  wastewater  treatment,  solid  waste  management,  roads,  and  cableway. \nThis  component  also  includes  restoration  of  18  Taoist  religious  buildings  and \ntemples.  The  number  of  annual  visitors  to  the  gardens  and  Shaanxi  Animal \nRescue Center (SARC) is projected to be 478,000 by 2015. \nSARC. The proposed SARC development will expand from the current 141 ha to \n1,008 ha. The expanded SARC is being designed to promote animal welfare and \ncaptive  breeding  of  at-risk  species.  These  functions  are  linked  to  ecotourism \ndevelopment,  as  well  as  to  the  adoption  of  new  innovative  approaches  for \nrescuing, protecting, and improving the living conditions of endangered and rare \nwild  animals.  The  proposed  activities  include  (a)  building  an  animal  hospital,  a \nrescue and emergency department, a zoology research lab, and a dormitory for \nexperts; (b) breeding and raising bases for giant pandas, crested ibis, and golden \nmonkeys, and other artiodactyls, as well as forage bases for the above animals; \n\n                                                 \n1  The  Shaanxi  Qinling  Botanical  Garden  and  the  Shaanxi  Animal  Rescue  Center  completed  by  Xi'an  University  of \n\nArchitecture and Technology, May 2007. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12        49 \n\n(c)  establishing  animal  protection  and  exhibition  facilities;  and  (d)  constructing \ninfrastructure,  including  internal  roads  and  paths,  and  a  wastewater  treatment \nplant. \n\n \nQBCDA.  QBCDA  consists  of  steep  land  with  a  population  of  about  4,600  persons \n4. \ndispersed over about 400 square kilometers. The Louguantai Forest Farm previously managed \nthe  area,  which  had  large  areas  that  were  heavily  logged.  More  remote  areas  retain  high-\nbiodiversity  values.  The  Project  will  support  habitat  rehabilitation  for  biodiversity  conservation. \nQBCDA  has  a  number  of  isolated  communities  practicing  unsustainable  agriculture  on  steep \nslopes that will be assisted to develop more sustainable livelihoods and adopt more appropriate \nland-use practices. The long-term vision for QBCDA is to develop and enhance the ecological \nsustainability of natural resources and ecosystems to increase biodiversity. Models developed in \nthe  management  of  QBCDA  will  be  extended  with  financing  to  nature  reserves  in  the  Qinling \nMountains.  \n \nB. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nMore  than  90%  of  the  Qinling  Mountains  has  been  degraded  through  inappropriate \n5. \nfarming, logging, overuse of natural resources, destructive mining operations, and pollution from \nsolid waste and agro-chemicals over many decades. As a result, the water resource quality is in \nserious decline. The project area has two major rivers, the Tianyu and Jiuyu rivers. The water \nquality  of  Tianyu  River  meets  the  class  I  water  standard\u2014water  from  natural  sources,  except \ncoliform  bacteria,  which  is  associated  with  the  discharge  of  human  and  animal  waste. \nGroundwater from Dianzhen village adjacent to the site of the botanical garden meets the class \nIII quality standard for groundwater, except ammonia and coliform. The high ammonia may be \nassociated with the agricultural activities.   \n \n6. \nThe Qinling Mountains is biologically rich, with many endangered rare or endemic plant \nand  animal  species,  including  the  giant  panda,  golden  takin,  golden  snub-nosed  monkey,  and \ncrested ibis (the national bird of Japan). The mountains are characterized by very high levels of \nendemic  biodiversity  found  in  temperate  and  subtropical  ecosystems,  as  well  as  a  vertical \nspectrum  of  vegetation  types;  70%  of  all  vegetation  types  in  the  PRC  are  represented.  In  the \nproject  area,  six  species  are  globally  threatened,  including  four  amphibians  and  two  reptiles. \nTwo species of fish are vulnerable, one of which is protected in Shaanxi, the other is listed in the \nnational  red  data  book  as  class  II.  Noted  species  of  concern  in  the  Tianyu  River  include  the \nManchurian  trout,  the  giant  salamander,  and  the  soft-shelled  tortoise.  The  project  area  is \nincluded in the Qinling Mountains Ecosystem Function Conservation Area (QMEFCA) within the \nhigh-priority  Central  Conservation  Zone  of  Qinling  Water  Resources  and  Biodiversity  Function \nZone.  The  proposed  activities  in  this  Project  are  consistent  with  the  requirements  of  the \nQMEFCA.  Under  the  proposed  QMEFCA  framework,  the  Shanxi  Environmental  Protection \nBureau  prepared  and  approved  the  Shaanxi  Qinling  Mountains  Northern  Slope  Ecological \nEnvironment  Protection  Plan  in  March  2007.  The  Project  conforms  to  the  development \nstandards stated in the plan. The population of the project area has living standards well below \nprovincial averages.   \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental Impact and Mitigation Measures \n\n7. \nQNBG.  Potential  adverse  impacts  associated  with  the  QNBG  include  (i)  those  arising \nfrom road and cableway construction; (ii) impacts of exotic species on indigenous species; (iii) \nimpacts on local water resources from water supply extraction; (iv) wastewater and solid waste \nimpacts;  and  (v)  impacts  to  landscape,  culture,  and  religion.  A  total  of  33.5  km  roads  will  be \nimproved  (including  about  13  km  of  roads  in  the  plains  area  and  17.5  km  of  the  road  in \nQBCDA),  and  a  cableway  will  be  constructed  for  QNBG.  Potential  adverse  impacts  from  road \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\ninclude \n\n(i)  appropriate  storage  of  hazardous  materials \n\nand  other  construction  activities  would  affect  soil,  water  resources,  and  air  quality.  Potential \nimpacts on the soil by road construction are from soil erosion and soil contamination. Mitigation \nmeasures  against  soil  erosion  during  construction  will  include  appropriate  engineering  design \n(batter  slopes,  compaction  levels,  installation  of  culverts,  etc.),  planting  of  vegetation, \nconstruction  of  appropriate  storm  water  drainage,  and  limiting  off-corridor  vehicle  movements. \nMitigation against loss of agricultural land includes (i) where possible, not locating construction \ncamps and material storage areas on agricultural land, and using preexisting hardstand storage \nareas;  (ii)  where  this  is  impossible,  rehabilitating  agricultural  land  after  completion  of \nconstruction,  and  removing  the  construction  camps  and  material  storage  areas;  and  (iii) \nconfining  construction  traffic  to  the  existing  road  corridor.  Mitigation  measures  against  soil \ncontamination  will \n(including \nhydrocarbons), and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes; (ii) provision of an oil interceptor for \nall  vehicle  wash-down  activities;  and  (iii)  disposal  of  all  hazardous  wastes  and  nonhazardous \nwastes  at  local  municipal  waste  disposal  facilities;  there  will  be  no  site-specific  landfills \ndeveloped for the Project. The potential impact on water resources along the alignment includes \nhydrocarbon  leaks  and  sewage  discharge  from  construction  camps.  Sanitary  wastewater  from \nthe construction camps will be collected and disposed  at nearby municipal treatment facilities. \nSanitary wastewater will not be disposed untreated in adjacent waterways. Hydrocarbon leaks \nwill  be  mitigated  through  appropriate  storage  and  handling  of  hydrocarbon  in  work  camps, \nincluding secondary containment and provision of spills cleanup equipment.  \n \n8. \nThe specialized gardens will involve more than 1,000 species of plants. Exotic species \npossibly invading QBCDA is a threat. QNBG will develop and implement an environmental risk \nassessment  for  biosafety  as  part  of  the  detailed  design.  QNBG  will  receive  water  from  two \nsources.  About  1,405  tons  per  day  (t/d)  of  surface  water  will  be  taken  from  the  Tianyu  River \n(less than 1% of total flow) for the irrigation system (west part). About 252 t/d of groundwater will \nbe  extracted  from  a  well  near  the  Tianyu  River.  Given  the  sufficient  precipitation  and  surface \nwater  recharge  in  the  area,  the  demand  is  not  significant  and  potential  impacts  can  be \nminimized  by  site  selection,  water  saving,  and  a  monitoring  program.  About  201  tons  of \nwastewater and 1.51 tons of solid wastes will be produced daily. Secondary sewage treatment \nwill be constructed to treat sewage up to the national irrigation standard, and discharge will be \nused for grey water irrigation purposes. Solid waste will be collected and sorted for recycling on-\nsite, and then trucked to the municipal solid waste treatment facility. Reconstruction of the eight \nhistorical  culture  sites  ranging  from  200  m2  to  3,600  m2  will  add  to  local  cultural  values.  The \npublic and religious groups will be consulted on the design and style of these reconstructions to \nensure the building designs are acceptable.  \n  \n9. \nSARC. Potential impacts will include (i) soil erosion, (ii) source water protection, (iii) loss \nof  vegetation,  (iv)  water  pollution,  and  (v)  waste  disposal.  Of  the  expanded  area,  85%  will  be \nused for forage bases to plant bamboo and other suitable plants and fruits for the animals. This \noperation  will  be  favorable  for  water  and  soil  conservation.  However,  64  ha  of  land  will  be \nconverted  for  animal  breeding  and  raising.  Development  of  infrastructure  facilities  in  these \nbases may create soil erosion during construction. The soil erosion will be effectively controlled \nby sound planning, good engineering, and integrated management. Water pollution associated \nwith  SARC  would  mainly  occur  in  the  main  area  and  the  satellite  centers.  A  secondary \nwastewater  treatment  facility  with  a  capacity  of  300  t/d  is  designed  for  treating  wastewater \ngenerated  by  animals  and  visitors.  The  sewage  generated  in  the  satellite  centers  is  relatively \nsmall and scattered, and is currently sold to local farmers. The treated effluent will be used for \nirrigation, and none will be discharged directly into the surface water. Solid waste management \nand the potential impacts from road construction will be managed in a similar way as proposed \nfor QNBG. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12        51 \n\nQBCDA. QBCDA will be managed for the primary purpose of biodiversity conservation. \n10. \nThe  long-term  vision  for  QBCDA  is  to  develop  and  enhance  the  ecological  sustainability  of \nnatural  resources  and  ecosystems  to  enable  biodiversity  to  be  increased,  managed,  and \nsecured.  The  long-term  status  of  QBCDA  involves  better  coverage  and  quality  of  forest  to \nincrease  the  habitat  for  the  Qinling  Mountains  biodiversity.  The  reforestation  and  silviculture \ndevelopment proposed, while on a large scale, is not expected to have any negative effects and \nwill be managed through the preparation of a habitat and forest management plan for QBCDA. \nThe project management office (PMO) and QNBG will screen any small business development, \nincluding home-stay tourism and forest-product processing.  \n \n11. \nactivities. These will be mitigated by the following environmental considerations:  \n\nThe provision of social infrastructure is linked to water and solar energy, and ecotourism \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nthe design should be consistent with the landscape and will include sustainable \npractices to reduce environmental impact; \nlow energy consumption technologies for lighting will be utilized;  \nbiodegradable  solid  waste  will  be  converted  into  compost  that  can  be  used  on \nsite. Nonbiodegradable waste would be collected and removed for disposal in the \nmunicipal landfill or recycled; \nwater supply is expected to come from a local spring source (quality tested); \nfor sewage and wastewater, septic tanks combined with on-site small biological \ntreatment will be applied;  \nexisting footpaths will be used for walking trails; because there are few users, no \nupgrading or surfacing of paths will be required; and \nthe ecology, home-stay, and other micro-scale resource-based tourism activities \nwill be managed under an environmental monitoring plan.  \n\n \n12. \nSome  road  and  mountain  pathway  improvement  will  also  be  conducted,  including  the \ncanyon  road  (17.5  km)  and  mountain  paths  (100  km).  Potential  adverse  impacts  are  (i) \nuncontrolled  vehicles  and  visitors;  (ii)  construction  requiring  earthworks;  (iii)  possible  blockage \nof  wildlife  movement;  (iv)  impacts  during  construction  (wildlife  disturbance  and  temporary  or \npermanent  displacement);  (v)  riverbank  erosion  by  increased  traffic,  unintentional  wildlife,  and \nhabitat  disturbance;  and  (vi)  other  construction-associated  impact.  Mitigation  measures  will \ninclude (i) careful site (alignment) design to avoid encroachment into the sensitive wildlife area; \n(ii) controlled attendance at the QNBG entrance and implementation of an access management \nplan; (iii) no construction between dusk and dawn, and avoidance of excessive noise; and (iv) \nreplanting and afforestation along the road and riverbanks to minimize soil erosion and protect \nhabitat.  Construction  mitigation  measures  for  the  roads  component  will  be  the  same  as \ndescribed for the QNBG.  \n \nD. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan \n\nInstitutional Requirements. The Shaanxi provincial government, the Executing Agency \n13. \nfor the Project, will have overall responsibility for ensuring that all environmental standards and \nprocedures  are  followed.  Under  the  supervision  of  Provincial  Development  and  Reform \nCommission, the Implementing Agency, QNBG, will be responsible for the implementation of all \ncorresponding  environmental  mitigation  measures  and  for  monitoring  programs  recommended \nin  its  EIA  and  this  SIEE.  Before  project  construction,  QNBG  will  form  an  environmental \nmanagement unit (EMU) for environmental management and operation, including environmental \nsupervision  of  contractors.  The  EMU  will  ensure  the  implementation  of  the  environmental \nmanagement plan and environmental monitoring plan during construction and operation of the \nProject. The construction contractor will designate an environmental representative, who will be \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nfor  conducting \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\nresponsible  for  the  environmental  management  of  construction  activities  during  project \nconstruction.  \n \n14. \nEnvironmental  Management  and  Monitoring  Plan.  The  summary  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP),  included  in  this  SIEE,  is  based  on  the  full  EMP  included  in  the  EIA \nreports. The PMO will translate the SIEE, including the summary EMP, into Chinese. The PMO \nwill ensure that the SIEE (including summary EMP) and the full EMP in the corresponding EIA \nare  included  in  all  contractors  bidding  documents  and  operating  contracts.  The  EMU  will  be \nresponsible for implementing the EMP during project construction and operation. The EMU will \nensure  that  the  EMP  is  updated  periodically  during  construction.  The  Project  will  utilize \nappropriately  qualified  environmental  monitoring  service  providers \nthe \nenvironmental  monitoring  duties  specified  in  this  SIEE.  The  environmental  monitoring  agency \nwill conduct the monitoring program and submit monitoring reports to the (i) PMO, (ii) Shaanxi \nEnvironmental  Protection  Bureau,  (iii)  QNBG,  and  (iv)  Asian  Development  Bank  semiannually \nduring construction.  \n \nE. \n \n15. \nPublic  consultation  consisted  of  issuing  questionnaire  surveys  to  affected  persons  and \nholding workshops with relevant stakeholders. Two public consultative surveys were conducted \nduring project preparation, consisting of (i) 24 valid respondents from 30 questionnaires during \npreparation  of  the  EIA,  and  (ii)  97  valid  respondents  from  101  questionnaires  during  the \nsupplementary EIA study. The surveys are considered to have sufficient representatives in the \nproject area. Two workshops were also held with a panel of 47 participants, including provincial \nand  local  government  representatives.  Leaders  of  the  townships  and  villages  in  the  vicinity  of \nthe project area, academy, and nongovernment organization representatives, such as the Xi'an \noffice  of  the  World  Wide  Fund  for  Nature,  were  fully  involved  in  the  workshops.  Information \nregarding the Project was also disseminated to the public through media and QNBG\u2019s website. \nThe  public  participation  has  played  an  important  role  in  the  EIA  and  project  design.  For \nexample, the width of the road from Jinniuping to Caihulu via Shouyangshan has been reduced \nfrom 6 meters to 1.5 meters with a saving of about $1.7 million. These adjustments will not only \nsave the project cost but reduce the potential environmental impact on the fragile ecosystem in \nthe project area and contribute to a sustainable and cost-effective investment. \n \nF. \n \n16. \nThe analysis undertaken in this SIEE indicates that the majority of the Project\u2019s impacts \nis  environmentally  beneficial,  and  will  have  a  large  and  positive  impact  on  securing  long-term \nbiodiversity  conservation  and  sustainability  in  the  Qinling  Mountains.  Some  minor  adverse \nimpacts are associated with the Project, mainly related to construction activities. All of these can \nbe mitigated by appropriate measures. Therefore, no further EIA is required. \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13            \n53\n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title: People\u2019s Republic of China/Shaanxi Qinling Biodiversity Conservation and Demonstration Project \n\nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\nProject based \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\nEast Asia Department/ \nAgriculture, Environment, and Natural Resources Division \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Country  Partnership  Strategy  2008\u20132010  for  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  a  (PRC) \nhighlighted  ADB\u2019s  priorities  which  are  in  line  with  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  and  stresses  its  continual  efforts  to \nsupport the Government to (i) sharpen its fight against poverty; and (ii) achieve the Millennium Development Goals, including \npolicy  work  in  such  areas  as  social  protection,  strengthening  the  role  of  nongovernment  agencies  in  reducing  poverty,  and \ncooperating with development partners to advance policy dialogue on the changing nature of poverty in the PRC. Nationally, \nthe  majority  of  the  poor  live  in  the  central  and  western  provinces,  which  lag  behind  the  eastern  provinces  in  achieving  the \nMillenium Development Goals. In these regions, poverty is rural and strongly correlated to access to land and the incidence of \nland degradation. Growth has outpaced environmental sustainability in many of these areas and the environment has become \na  major  constraint  to  sustained  economic  development.  Environmental  protection,  ecosystem  restoration,  and  biodiversity \nconservation are the key priorities in the western development strategy. The majority of ADB\u2019s lending to the interior provinces \nseek  to  create  a  climate  for  pro-poor  economic  growth.  Ongoing  ADB-financed  policy  work  is  addressing  poverty-related \nissues  in  health,  education,  social  protection,  nutrition,  land  degradation,  access  to  clean  drinking  water,  and  sanitation  in \nrural areas. The Poverty Partnership Agreement, signed by the Government and ADB in September 2003, sets out strategies \nand interventions for poverty reduction. The Government and ADB will continue to (i) cooperate on a broad range of activities \nrelated to policy and regulatory reform, and capacity building in the environment sector; and (ii) support projects to address \nenvironmental problems. Projects will be designed so that the poor capture some of the environmental benefits. To sharpen \nthe  poverty  focus  of  its  environmental  work,  the  Government  and  ADB  are  addressing  land  degradation  by  supporting  the \nimplementation  of  the  10-year  PRC-Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF)  Partnership  for  Land  Degradation  in  Dryland \nEcosystems. \n \nThe Project directly contributes to these objectives by introducing biodiversity management models, which promotes market-\ndriven  biodiversity  conservation  and  provides  sustainable  livelihoods  for  the  population  of  the  project  area  that  can  be \ndemonstrated for, and replicated in the wider Qinling Mountains. The Project promotes the participation and empowerment of \nrural communities and sustainable livelihood by means of (i) improved agricultural and other technologies; (ii) value addition; \nand  (iii)  non-extractive  use  of  natural  resources  using  commercial  enterprises  in  such  areas  as  ecotourism,  Chinese  herbal \nmedicines,  non-timber  forest  products,  biodiversity  conservation  services,  and  innovation  in  public\u2013private-community \npartnerships. \n \nThe  project  area  is  within  the  Qinling  Mountains  and  is  a  highly-complex  area  of  different  geographic  features,  settlement \npatterns  and  densities,  and  multiple  and  overlapping  land  use  and  related  management  rights  among  forestry  and  other \ngovernment  agencies,  Zhouzhi  County,  and  various  townships,  villages,  and  households.  The  total  registered  population  in \nthe  project  area  is  about  20,400  including  3  townships  and  30  administrative  villages.  No  ethnic  minorities  are  living  in  the \nproject  area.  Poverty  is  widespread  both  in  the  Qinling  Mountains  and  the  project  area  based  on  the  national  poverty \nbenchmark,  with  small-scale  agriculture  on  steep  slopes,  very  limited  infrastructure  throughout  the  rugged  and  isolated \nvalleys,  and  few  links  to  the  modern  economy.  Zhouzhi  County  is  directly  under  Xi'an  City.  Its  total  area  is  2,974  square \nkilometers, including 2,200 square kilometers of mountain area in the Qinling Mountains that takes up 74% of the total land \narea,  cultivated  land  covers  60,000  mu  (land  measurement)  and  forestland  196,600  mu.  Gross  domestic  product/capita  in \nZhouzhi County is estimated to be only 50% of the provincial average, 30% of the average for the total country, and only 20% \nof the average for the Xi'an urban districts. Zhouzhi County is well below the provincial and national averages in virtually all of \nthe  main  socioeconomic  indicators\u2014retail  sales  per  capita,  gross  fixed  investment,  household  savings,  and  fiscal  capacity. \nNet farmer per capita income in Zhouzhi County was only CNY1,317 in 2005, which was only 40% of the national average, \nand 64% of the provincial average in that year. Despite its low household incomes and levels of development, Zhouzhi County \nis  not  a  national  or  provincial  poverty  county  under  national  or  provincial  programs.  However,  about  17%  of  the  Zhouzhi \nCounty population reportedly is below the poverty line, and 103 out of 379 administrative villages in the county are considered \nto  be  poverty  villages.  Poverty  levels  are  particularly  high  in  the  mountain  areas  where  60%  of  the  population  is  below  the \npoverty threshold. Mountain areas account for about 74% of the county\u2019s land area, 60% of its poverty population, but only \n10% of the total population. \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nPoverty  in  the  project  area  remains  significant.  Using  the  poverty  line  of  Shaanxi  province  of  CNY865  per  capita  per  year \nresults in 21 villages out of 30 being poor. A survey done in 2005 by the Provincial Poverty Reduction Office shows that a total \nof 7,586 people in both ex-situ and in-situ are counted as poverty population covering 1,889 households. Further splitting the \npoverty  populations  into  the  protected  and  mountainous  Qinling  Biological  Conservation  and  Demonstration  Area  (QBCDA) \nand the commercial and agricultural area in the plains or flat lands, higher poverty incidence occurs in QBCDA. About 4,600 \npeople  or  23%  of  the  total  population  in  the  project  area  live  in  QBCDA,  of  which  about  73%  is  poor.  By  contrast,  of  the \n19,800 residents in the plains area, about 27% is poor. The poverty ratio in the overall project area is about 37%. The project \npoverty  classification  fits  the  \u201cgeneral  intervention\u201d  as  less  than  50%  of  the  population  comprises  the  poor  among  project \nbeneficiaries. \n \nPoverty analysis was undertaken using formal field surveys and participatory key informant discussions throughout the project \narea.  Institutional  consultation  was  undertaken  regarding  the  ongoing  efforts  and  experiences  in  poverty  reduction  in  the \nprovince. The design of interventions on improving rural livelihoods and poverty reduction will result in improvements through \nincreased incomes while conservation of the environment, a strong and growing ecotourism sector through construction of an \ninternational  standard  Qinling  National  Botanical  Garden  (QNBG),  an  expansion  of  the  Animal  Rescue  Center  (Shaanxi \nAnimal  Rescue  Center  [SARC],  which  is  part  of  QNBG),  reconstruction  of  several  temples  with  the  cooperation  of  the \nLouguantai  Daoist  Temple,  as  well  as  associated  alternative  livelihood  opportunities  and  training  for  more  sustainable \nlivelihoods through higher incomes, job creation, and small business opportunities. \n \n2. Design Features \nA social and poverty assessment was carried out in compliance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Incorporation of Social Dimensions \nin Bank Operations (1997). The assessment included a rural livelihood assessment  which confirmed disparate growth rates \nbetween  sectors  resulting  in  large  income  inequities  between  rural  and  urban  residents,  and  between  different  rural  areas. \nThe causes of poverty in the project area are complex, but these are associated with land degradation and the harsh human \nliving  conditions.  The  following  causes  were  identified  during  the  household  survey  and  the  assessment  exercises:  (i) \npervasive small-scale agriculture on steep slopes, threatened by wild animals; (ii) limited infrastructure; (iii) limited alternatives \nfor other livelihood activities; (iv) unsustainable land conversion program, and no alternative job and income opportunities for \nsurplus labor; (v) poor access to social services such as education and health care with few links to the modern economy; and \n(vi) traditional agricultural practices are used as the main exit from poverty, which leads to limited solutions for high poverty \nlevels and can further degrade the environment. \n \nThe National Poverty Reduction program is still being implemented in QBCDA. Specific alternative livelihood activities as well \nas improvements to infrastructure such as roads, water supply, etc., will directly benefit these communities, reduce their \nreliance on low-productive sloped land farming, and provide increased access to income-generating activities. \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nKey  Issues.  The  villages  in  the  biodiversity  conservation  area,  QBCDA,  are  poorer  and  with  less  social  services  and \neconomic  opportunities  than  the  villages  in  the  northern  plains  section  of  the  project  area  that  has  more  tourism  and \nagriculture  with  substantially  more  population.  The  population  in  QBCDA  of  about  4,600  will  be  targeted  for  employment \nopportunities in ecotourism and forest replanting on community forest land. These villagers have experienced substantial out-\nmigration  of  younger  people  seeking  more  lucrative  employment  opportunities.  The  remaining  population  practices \nunsustainable  agriculture  on  steep  slopes  that  is  environmentally  harmful  to  the  biodiversity  of  QBCDA.  Under  the  Project, \nthese  villagers  will  receive  (i)  direct  employment  benefits; (ii)  paid  land  conversion  programs  supporting  conservation  forest \nplantings;  and  (iii)  opportunities  to  start  small  businesses,  and  improved  access  to  water  supplies  and  alternative  energy \nsources. It is expected that villagers in QBCDA will voluntarily move out of agriculture and into forest-based livelihoods that \nwill provide long-term benefits. The Project will provide more sustainable alternative livelihoods. \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \nConsultation with stakeholders, beneficiaries, and directly-affected people has been undertaken and will continue during the \ndesign  and  implementation  of  the  Project.  Detailed  discussion  with  the  Xi'an  City  government,  the  line  agencies, \nrepresentatives  of  QNBG  and  other  investors,  cultural  and  ecotourism  operations,  and  groups  of  rural  residents  were  held. \nThe project management office (PMO) under the Executing Agency, the Shaanxi provincial government, was established. The \nleading group is chaired by the Governor, and  will coordinate and enlist the support of involved and concerned agencies to \nensure smooth implementation. The group will also play its role as a steering committee. The PMO is engaging 11 staff and \nlinks  closely  to  the  existing  QNBG.  In  addition,  the  ongoing  PRC-GEF  Partnership  on  Land  Degradation  will  provide  an \nopportunity  to  build  capacity  in  project  planning  and  implementation.  The  PMO  has  provided  assistance  in  making  local \nexperts from different disciplines available to work with the Project. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13        55 \n\n \nA participatory and consultative methodology was adopted to undertake the social analysis and rural livelihood survey during \nthe project preparatory technical assistance. It involved (i) a formal questionnaire survey of 200 households; (ii) discussions \nwith project stakeholders; (iii) key informant interviews  in rural communities; (iv) a series of stakeholder  workshops; and (v) \ninterviews  with  key  government  staff,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  women.  During  project  implementation,  the \nparticipation of stakeholders will be further supported and deepened. An institutional framework is included, which will provide \nfurther opportunity for participation in both planning and implementation. Institutional capacity building will be undertaken early \nin  the  project  design  to  facilitate  successful  operation  of  the  Project.  The  resettlement  plans  include  consultation  and \nparticipation  during  implementation.  Participatory  village  development  planning  will  further  enhance  the  participation  of \nbeneficiaries. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nVillagers  in  QBCDA  will  be  involved  and  will  participate  fully  in  the  village  development  plans  and  the  implementation  of \nconservation forestry  activities on community forest  land. Resettlement by QNBG  will be conducted  with full  participation  of \naffected villagers near Dianzhen village. \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n\n No  \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n1.  Key  Issues.  Gender  roles  are  determined  by  a  combination  of  cultural  factors,  occupations,  environmental  conditions, \neducation levels, and employment opportunities. In the project area, income inequities create incentives for rural workers to \nmigrate  to  urban  labor  markets.  However,  due  to  its  close  location  to  good  roads  and  to  both  county  town  and  township \ncompounds,  female  laborers,  particularly  young  women,  share  the  available  opportunities  with  men  for  off-farm  jobs.  Only \nslight agricultural feminization in the developed commercial and agricultural area is observed, while in QBCDA, young people \ntend to be mobile and the group left behind is older. There is high illiteracy among women in some QBCDA villages. \n \n2.  Key  Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n \n \nIn general, the Project will benefit women significantly and will not have an adverse impact on women or children. They will \nbenefit  from  the  ecotourism  facilities,  greater  access  to  information  and  jobs,  and  increased  opportunities  for  starting  small \nincome-generating  activities.  Women  will  gain  employment  during  the  construction  of  QNBG.  As  part  of  the  participation \nstrategy, priority will be given to women for direct and indirect project benefits and for protection against social risk. Special \ngender  measures  have  been  included  in  the  resettlement  plans.  Gender  disaggregated  indicators  will  be  monitored  in  the \nproject performance management system. The Project will not have significant negative impacts on women, but a proposed \ngender  plan  will  ensure  equal  participation  of  women  in  project  activities  and  equal  opportunities  of  women  for  access  to \nsocial services, training, employment, land relocation, and beneficiary agreements. \n \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nIssue \n\nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \nSignificant \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n   Full Plan \n   Short Plan \n   Resettlement  \n\n       Framework \n   No Action \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nthe \n\nimpacts \n\nacquisition \nare \n\nrelocation,  115  households \n\nWith  close  consultation  and  careful  screening \nand \nprocedures, \nland \nresettlement \nconsidered \nsignificant.b  QNBG  will  have  resettlement \nimpacts,  requiring  permanent  land  acquisition \nand  relocation  of  houses  and  people.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION \n\nAre social indicators included in the design and monitoring framework to facilitate monitoring of social development activities \nand/or social impacts during project implementation?   x   Yes     \u25a1   No      \na  ADB. 2008. People's Republic of China: Country Partnership Strategy 2008\u20132010. Manila. \nb  ADB's  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  defines  resettlement  as  \u201csignificant\u201d  where  200  or  more  people  experience \nmajor impacts. Major impacts are defined as involving affected people being physically displaced from housing and/or losing \n10% or more of their productive, income-generating assets. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14             57 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n\ntaxes  and  management \n\n \n1. \nThe Project has three components or activities that could cause resettlement impacts: (i) \nthe Qinling National Botanical Garden (QNBG), (ii) the Shaanxi Animal Rescue Center (SARC), \nand (iii) the forest conservation in the Qinling Biological Conservation and Demonstration Area \n(QBCDA).  Each  subcomponent  was  investigated  and  it  was  found  that  only  two  required  a \nresettlement  plan\u2014QNBG  and  SARC.  The  other  two  subcomponents  do  not  involve \nresettlement  impacts.  The  Implementing  Agency  is  QNBG, 1  which  is  responsible  for  the \nbotanical gardens, SARC, and QBCDA. \n \nQNBG.  QNBG  is  planned  to  cover  an  area  of  269.3  hectares  (ha),  or  4,039.5  mu,2 of \n2. \ncollective  land  that  is  currently  owned  by  Dianzhen  village.  QNBG  plans  to  acquire  up  to  427 \nmu3 of land for the main buildings and other infrastructure, and to lease the remaining 3,612.5 \nmu  of  garden  areas  from  the  villagers  who  will  become  shareholders  in  the  QNBG  company.  \nFor the initial stage, 293.63 mu of land will be permanently acquired, including (i) 133.0 mu of \nirrigated land, (ii) 42.2 mu of dry farmland, (iii) 29.7 mu of orchards, (iv) 42.9 mu of housing land, \nand (v) 45.83 mu of uncultivated land. The land acquisition will affect 115 households with 504 \npeople.  In  addition,  19,319  square  meters  of  houses  will  be  demolished,  which  will  affect  143 \nhouseholds with 617 people, who will be relocated to the main residential section of the village. \nSupporting infrastructure, including walls (3.54 kilometers [km]), power lines (0.96 km), telecom \nlines  (01.125  km),  1  well,  and  7,150  trees.  QNBG  will  pay  compensation  of  CNY51.7  million, \nlump  sum \nfees.  The  affected \nincluding \ncompensation payments for permanently acquired land and housing. QNBG will lease the land-\nuse  rights  on  3,612.5  mu  of  farmland,  which  will  affect  948  households  with  3,780  people. \nHowever, village and the households will continue to own this land. QNBG will sign land-lease \nagreements with the affected groups of Dianzhen village to establish a 50-year use right for the \nbotanical gardens. QNBG will make fixed annual payments to affected households for 50 years, \nplus  annual  payments  based  on  gate  revenues  or  profit  when  the  botanical  garden  becomes \noperational.  QNBG  will  also  employ  more  than  250  people  after  full  development,  and \npreference  will  be  given  to  these  shareholders  for  jobs.  This  way,  local  villagers  will  be \nadequately  compensated  for  interim  incomes  losses,  and  will  earn  wages  and  income  from \npayments as QNBG generates more revenues from new visitors to QNBG and SARC. \n \nSARC.  SARC  will  be  expanded  from  141  ha  to  1,008  ha,  but  most  of  the  land  area \n3. \nalready belong to the owner, the Louguantai Forest Farm, which manages 18,780 ha of forest \narea.  The  expansion  will  require  9  ha  of  collectively  owned  land  in  three  small  parcels  to  be \nacquired  permanently  for  the  construction  of  (i)  the  Crested  Ibis  Center  (2  ha),  (ii)  the  Golden \nMonkey Center (3 ha), and (iii) the main research center (4 ha). This land acquisition involves \nminor  impacts  on  three  villages:  East  Louguantai,  Qiandongming,  and  West  Louguantai.  The \naffected land includes 2.9 ha of dryland, 5.5 ha of slope land, and 0.6 ha irrigated land, which \nwill affect 30 households and a total of 125 people. QNBG will pay compensation of CNY13.65 \nmillion,  including  taxes  and  management  fees.  The  affected  farmers  will  receive  lump  sum \ncompensation payments for land that is permanently acquired. \n \n4. \nForest  Conservation  in  QBCDA.  This  subcomponent  includes  better  sustainable \nmanagement and conservation of natural resources, including forestry and wildlife habitat. The \nresidents  of  QBCDA  will  be  directly  involved  in  this  program,  development  of  5,000  ha  of \nconservation forestry, and ecotourism-based business development. All of these programs will \n\nfarmers  will  receive \n\n                                                 \n1  A public sector entity has been established consisting of QNBG, SARC, and the Louguantai Forest Farm, and this \n\nentity manages QBCDA. \n\n2  15 Chinese mu = 1 hectare (ha). \n3  Initially, only 293.63 mu is to be acquired. The remainder will be purchased as the botanical gardens expand. \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nbe  voluntary.  Villagers  will  benefit  from  higher  agro-forestry  incomes,  more  secure  land-use \nrights  on  collective  forest  land,  and  employment  in  new  ecotourism  businesses.  There  is  no \nneed  for  land  acquisition.  Any  local  road  or  village  road  improvements  would  be  done  along \nexisting alignments for environmental reasons. \n \n5. \nExisting Socioeconomic Conditions. The incidence of poverty in QBCDA is more than \n70%,  compared  with  23%  for  the  narrow  northern  strip  of  land  in  the  project  area  where  the \ngreat majority of the population reside. Poverty in QBCDA is highlighted by low-grain availability \nper  capita  of  only  198  kilograms,  compared  with  422  kilograms  in  the  other  area.  QBCDA \nincome per capita is only 18% of the national average. The livelihood survey conducted under \nthe technical assistance4 found that the stakeholders had extremely limited human capital and \nadults were poorly educated. The residents in QBCDA are sparsely scattered in 16 villages (12 \npersons per square kilometer compared with 267 per square kilometer elsewhere in the project \narea).  The  mountain  environment  has  limited  the  development  of  social  capital,  and  the  local \ngovernment has encouraged out-migration to solve  poverty. Recently, the physical capital has \nimproved  with  road  upgrading  along  the  Tianyu  River,  but  other  infrastructure  is  virtually \nnonexistent. Although the natural capital is extremely rich, much of the land are degraded and \nthe  forest  resources  can  no  longer  be  exploited  by  the  local  residents.  Many  of  these \nhouseholds  depend  on  subsistence  agriculture  and  subsidy  payments  from  government \nprograms.  The  narrow  strip  of  good  farmland  just  north  of  the  Qinling  Mountains  supports \n15,800  residents.  They  are  mainly  engaged  in  farming,  but  many  obtain  most  of  their  income \nfrom  tourism-related  businesses.  These  households  are  significantly  better  off  as  they  have \naccess  to  (i)  physical  infrastructure,  especially  roads;  (ii)  health  and  education  services;  (iii) \nmore opportunities for off-farm employment; (iv) access to productive land and markets for high-\nvalue  fruit  crops,  including  kiwi  fruit;  and  (v)  land  for  renting  to  commercial  enterprises. \nHowever, households that are entirely dependent on farming remain relatively poor. \n \nSummary of Project Impacts. To avoid or minimize land acquisition and resettlement, \n6. \nlocal officials, village committees, and affected persons were consulted during project feasibility \nplanning and resettlement plan preparation. Most of the lands to be used for the Project already \nbelong  to  the  Louguantai  Forest  Farm.  This  has  minimized  the  need  to  acquire  collectively \nowned  land.  However,  to  preserve  the  forest  resources,  commercial  ventures  would  only  be \nlocated on the plains north of QBCDA. This necessitated the acquisition  of some farmland  for \nthe botanical gardens and some small parcels of land for SARC. The impacts on the Dianzhen \nvillage  would  be  serious.  For  this  reason,  a  land-shareholding  agreement  was  proposed  that \nwould  allow  these  villagers  to  benefit  directly  from  the  Project.  In  total,  the  Project  requires \npermanent land acquisition of 28.6 ha, of which 17.2 ha is farmland; this will cause partial land \nloss  (50%  on  average)  for  629  persons.  The  Project  will  require  the  displacement  of  only  143 \nhouses with 617 persons, who will be compensated and relocated nearby. An additional 3,780 \npersons will receive shareholding agreements for the lease of their farmland. \n \n7. \nLegal Framework and Resettlement Principles. For people unavoidably affected, the \nresettlement objective is to achieve equal or better income and living standards in line not only \nwith  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  laws  and  regulations  but  also  the  Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  (1995)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  PRC  laws  and \nregulations  provide  the  legal  basis  for  the  Project,  primarily  the  Land  Administrative  Law,  the \nDecision  on  Reinforcing  Reform  in  Land  Administration  (State  Council  [2004]  No.28),  and  the \nPRC  Ministry  of  Land  Resources  Guidelines  on  Improving  Land  Acquisition  and  Relocation \nRegulations  (Document  [2004]  No.  238).  In  addition,  Shaanxi  province  and  Xi'an  municipality \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2005.

All these documents \nhave provided the essential policy and procedural basis contained in the resettlement plans. For \nthis Project, the following resettlement principles were adopted:  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n(ix) \n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\ninvoluntary resettlement should be avoided or minimized where feasible;  \ncompensation and entitlements provided for the affected persons should be able \nto at least maintain or improve their \u201cpre-project\u201d standard of living;  \nno  matter  whether  they  have  legal  entitlements,  all  affected  persons  will  be \ncompensated and assisted;  \nwhere  land  per  capita,  after  land  acquisition,  is  not  sufficient  to  maintain \nlivelihood, compensation by cash or through land replacement and other income-\ngenerating activities will be provided for;  \nall  affected  persons  will  be  adequately  informed  on  eligibility,  compensation \nmode and standards, livelihood and income restoration plans, and project timing, \nand will be involved in resettlement plan implementation;  \nno  land  acquisition  will  take  place  unless  replacement  land  or  sufficient \ncompensation are given to affected persons;  \nthe Executing Agency and an independent third party will monitor compensation \nand resettlement operations; \nvulnerable groups will receive special assistance to ensure they are better off;  \nall affected persons should have the opportunities to benefit from the Project;  \nresettlement  plans  should  be  combined  with  overall  county  and  township \nplanning; and \nimplementing agencies should provide adequate and timely funds, including any \nobligations in excess of the resettlement plan budget estimates. \n\n \n8. \nCompensation  and  Rehabilitation  Plans.  Land  compensation  will  be  paid  to  the \naffected village and/or affected persons, and the resettlement subsidy and other compensation \nfor individual asset loss will be paid to the affected persons. Villagers who lease their lands will \nreceive annual payments from QNBG for the 50-year lease period. Households to be relocated \nwill  receive  compensation  at  replacement  cost  for  the  lost  structures  and  attachments  without \nconsideration  of  depreciation.  The  affected  household  can  rebuild  their  houses  by  themselves \nwith  free  house  plots  provided  by  the  village.  Affected  persons  can  salvage  the  structural \nmaterials,  and  a  moving  subsidy  will  also  be  provided.  The  new  section  of  the  village  for \nrelocating  the  143  households  has  been  designed  based  on  modern  standards  with  good \nstreets, water supply, drainage, electricity, and communication lines. The local government will \ncontribute  funds  for  village  infrastructure.  The  detailed  programs  of  restoration  and  relocation \nhave  been  set  out  in  each  resettlement  plan  to  mitigate  the  resettlement  impacts  for  affected \npersons  and  to  restore  their  living  standards  according  to  the  economic  characteristics  of \naffected  villages.  People  can  choose  the  options  according  to  their  own  requirements.  The \nProject  will  not  have  any  impacts  on  ethnic  minorities.  Any  affected  persons  will  be  identified \nand provided preferential treatment to ensure their rehabilitation. Assistance measures include \nprovision  of  training  and  employment  for  project  construction  and  operation  (including  50% \nwomen), and other employment information for jobs in the area.  \n \nResettlement  Costs  and  Funding.  The  estimated  cost  for  land  acquisition  and \n9. \nresettlement  is  about  CNY38.04  million,  including  contingencies  and  land  taxes.  In  addition, \nQNBG will make annual payments for 50 years ranging from CNY1.5 million in 2011 to CNY4.4 \nmillion in 2025 for leasing the land from Dianzhen village. Detailed measurement surveys will be \nconducted  in  each  village,  and  the  compensation  contracts  will  be  negotiated  and signed  with \nvillage committees, households, and enterprises. The resettlement costs are included as part of \ntotal  project  cost  and  will  be  funded  by  QNBG  and  guaranteed  by  the  Shaanxi  provincial \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\ngovernment. Affected persons have been informed about the key elements of land acquisition \nand resettlement through consultation during the planning stage and distribution of resettlement \ninformation booklets. During meetings, interviews, focus group discussions, public consultation \nworkshops,  and  community  consultation  meetings,  local  representatives  participated  in  the \nplanning, and concerns were integrated into the resettlement plans.  \n \n10. \nResettlement Implementation and Monitoring. The project management office (PMO) \nis  responsible  for  overall  coordination  of  resettlement  planning,  supervision,  monitoring,  and \nreporting.  QNBG  will  establish  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  unit  for  supervising \nimplementation,  continuing  public  consultation,  responding  to  grievances,  and  reporting \nprogress.  The  main  responsibility  for  administration  of  land  acquisition,  compensation,  and \nresettlement  is  Zhouzhi  County.  The  grievance  redress  procedures  are  set  out  in  the \nresettlement  plans.  The  resettlement  implementation  schedules  were  prepared  based  on  the \nfeasibility  study  and  construction  timetable.  Internal  and  external  monitoring  of  resettlement \nimplementation  will  be  required.  QNBG  and  the  PMO  will  handle  internal  supervision  and \nmonitoring  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  the  resettlement  plan.
