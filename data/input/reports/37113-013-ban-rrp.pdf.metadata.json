The  project  includes  (i)  replacing  five  aging  generating \nunits  with  a  combined  capacity  of  274  megawatts  (MW)  at  Ashuganj  power  station  with  an \nefficient combined cycle power plant (CCPP) of 450 MW using natural gas as the fuel source; \n(ii)  installing  a  5  MW  solar  photovoltaic  system  connected  to  the  national  grid  at  Kaptai;  (iii) \ninstalling  a  hybrid  wind  (1  MW)\u2013solar  photovoltaic (1 MW)\u2013diesel (5.5  MW) generating  system \nin  Hatiya;  and  (iv)  installing  or  retrofitting  streetlights  that  use  photovoltaic  and  light-emitting \ndiode  (LED)  technology  in  the  cities  of  Barisal,  Chittagong,  Dhaka,  Khulna,  Rajshahi,  and \nSylhet.  These  subprojects  will  help  Bangladesh  to  embark  on  a  program  of  energy  efficiency, \nsource diversification, and reduced dependence on imported fuels.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3.  \nEnergy shortage is the most critical infrastructure constraint  on Bangladesh\u2019s economic \ngrowth. In 2011, the maximum demand for electricity is 6,000 MW, which is expected to rise to \n7,000  MW  by  2013.  But  the  maximum  available  generation  is  4,500\u20134,750  MW  (from  an \ninstalled  capacity  of  5,719  MW),  leaving  a  significant  supply  gap.  The  main  causes  for  the \nsupply  shortage  are  (i)  the  poor  operational  efficiency  of  thermal  power  plants  and  inefficient \nuse of energy; (ii) inadequate supplies of natural gas, which is the primary source of energy for \nelectricity  generation;  (iii)  slow  progress  on  cross-border  energy  cooperation;  and  (iv)  lack  of \ndiversification  in  energy  supply,  including  inadequate  exploitation  of  renewable  energy.  These \nissues were highlighted in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) 2009 Bangladesh energy sector \nassistance program evaluation (SAPE).3 \n \n4. \nThe  government\u2019s  declared  vision  for  the  power  sector  in  2010  is  to  eliminate  load \nshedding  beyond  2010  and  to  make  electricity  available  to  all  by  2021.  The  government \nestimated that realizing this vision would require an additional 9,000 MW of generating capacity \ninstalled by the end of 2015. Of this, 5,400 MW of generation capacity would be added by the \nprivate  sector.  Since  the  declaration  of  this  policy,  586  MW  of  generating  capacity  has  been \nadded to the system and additional approvals have been granted for new power plants. Other \ninitiatives aim to diversify energy sources by developing coal resources, renewable energy, and \ncross-border cooperation.  \n \n5. \nSAPE  has  concluded  that  ADB\u2019s  contribution  to  the  development  of  the  Bangladesh \npower sector has been significant and successful. One of the key recommendations of SAPE is \npromoting  energy  efficiency,  the  main  intervention  in  the  proposed  project.3    ADB\u2019s  country \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  ADB.  2009.  Technical \nAssistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  Preparing  the  Power  System  Efficiency  Improvement \nProject. Manila. \n\n3   ADB. 2009. Sector Assistance Program Evaluation: Energy Sector in Bangladesh. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fpartnership  strategy  for  Bangladesh 4  emphasizes  (i)  investments  in  energy  efficiency  and \nnetwork  expansion;  (ii)  continuing  policy  dialogue  on  energy  pricing  and  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment for private sector participation; and (iii) regional cooperation. ADB is strengthening \nits efforts toward clean energy investments through public\u2013private partnerships. As a part of this \nstrategy,  ADB  approved  a  loan  to  facilitate  the  flow  of  500 MW  from  India  to  Bangladesh \nthrough  an  electricity  transmission  interconnection  on  Bangladesh\u2019s  western  border 5 .  The \nproposed  project  will  supplement  ADB\u2019s  efforts  to  assist  Bangladesh  in  eliminating  supply \nshortages.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n6. \nThe impact of the project will be increased provision of better access to electricity. The \noutcome will be increased generating capacity. The capacity to generate 176 MW will be added \nby  installing  a  CCPP  to replace  some  aging,  inefficient  plants.  Further, the  project  will  support \nexpanding  renewable  energy  in  the  country  by  installing  solar  photovoltaic  and  wind  power \nsystems with a total capacity of 14 MW.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n7. \nThe project outputs can be grouped in two parts. Part A is improved energy efficiency, to \nbe  achieved  by  replacing  aging  steam  and  gas  turbine  plants  at  Ashugani  power  station  that \nhave  a capacity  of  274 MW  with  a state-of-the-art  CCPP  that  has  a capacity  of  450  MW,  and \nconstructing a 1-kilometer transmission line to connect the new plant to the national grid. Part B \nis  increased  renewable  energy  use,  to  be  achieved  by  (i)  installing  a  5  MW  solar  photovoltaic \ngrid-connected power generating plant at Kaptai hydropower plant site; (ii) installing an off-grid \nwind\u2013solar  hybrid  system  with  diesel  generator  on  Hatiya  Island  (1 MW  solar  photovoltaic,  1 \nMW  wind,  and  5.5 MW  diesel);  and  (iii)  installing  or  retrofitting  streetlights  that  use  solar \nphotovoltaic and LED technology in the six cities. \n \n8.  \nInfrastructure investments in parts A and B will be supplemented by capacity building for \neach,  toward  supporting  project  implementation  and  training  on  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M)  for  the  staff  of  executing  agencies  (EAs)  and  communities  to be  served  by  the  off-grid \nwind\u2013solar hybrid plant. This will include training women on the O&M of solar photovoltaic and \nsolar\u2013wind  hybrid  plants  and  a  gender-sensitive  educational  program  for  beneficiaries  on \nhousehold energy efficiency.  \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n9. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $300  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  to  help  finance  the  project.6 The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered rate (LIBOR)-based  lending facility,  a commitment charge  of  0.15%  per  year \n(with  interest  and  other  charges  during  construction  to  be  capitalized  in  the  loan),  and  such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The government \nhas  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending facility based on these terms and conditions; and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \n                                                \n4   ADB. 2010.

As  it  is  not  possible  to  separately \nprocure individual components of this package, its procurement will be conducted jointly by ADB \nand IDB. In order to enable such joint procurement, it is proposed to expand  country eligibility \nfor procurement under part A by allowing firms, subcontractors, and sourcing of materials from \nany country eligible under ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and IDB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement \nof  Goods  and  Works  under  IDB  Financing  (2009).  Such  an  expansion  of  country  and  source \neligibility is required to implement the jointly financed package and would require a waiver under \nArticle 14 (ix)  of the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank.

Consulting  firms  will  be  recruited  using  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection, with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. \n  \n15. \nThe  funds  required  for  the  jointly  financed  package  will  be  directly  disbursed  to  the \nsupplier by IDB. For effective coordination between the cofinanciers and the borrower, ADB will \ndevelop,  in  consultation  with  IDB,  a  memorandum  of  understanding  to  lay  out  the  basic \nprinciples and procedures for collaboration, cooperation, and exchanging information at the time \nof implementation. The minutes recording discussions on the contents of such a memorandum \nof understanding were finalized by ADB and IDB during the appraisal mission. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n  \n\nThe  draft  power  sector  master  plan  update  2010  identifies  the  need  to  add  11  CCPPs \n16. \neach with 450 MW capacity in 2010\u20132016. The proposed Ashuganj 450 MW plant (part A) can \nbe considered one of these CCPPs. Further, the government has identified the proposed plant \nas  a  priority  project  in  its  expansion  plan.  The  economic  cost  of  electricity  supply  from  the \nAshuganj CCPP is similar to or lower than those of a coal-fired power plant (based on the costs \ntaken from the master plan), confirming that the proposed plant is among the least-cost options \nfor generating new capacity. CCPP design will use the latest commercially available technology \nto  harness  the  maximum  benefit  of  energy  efficiency.  Part  B  of  the  project  will  demonstrate \nrenewable  energy  technologies  and  their  application  for  long-term  large-scale  penetration  into \nthe  Bangladesh  power  system.  The  subcomponents  in  part  B  use  solar  photovoltaic,  wind \npower, and LEDs, which are commercially proven technologies. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n17. \nFinancial  analysis  of  the  proposed  project  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nFinancial Management and Analysis of Projects.9 All financial costs and benefits are expressed \nin  constant  2010  prices.  The  financial  viability  of  the  Ashuganj  CCPP  was  assessed  by \ncomparing  the  incremental  costs  and  benefits  of  the  project.  The  incremental  benefits  were \ncalculated based on the revenue stream from power sales to BPDB and avoided costs of O&M \nfor  aging  power  plants.  The  capital  investments,  O&M  costs,  and  taxes  incurred  to  install  and \noperate the project were used as costs. In renewable energy components, the revenue stream \nin the form  of power  sales  or  avoided power  purchase  and  a  cost stream consisting of  capital \ncosts, O&M costs, and taxes were used. The financial internal rate of return for part A is 7.6% \nagainst an estimated weighted average cost of capital of 2.16%, while that for part B is negative \ndue  to  high  capital  costs  and  low  power  sales  and  avoided  power  purchase  tariffs.  However, \npart B has redeeming demonstration impact on renewable energy development in Bangladesh. \n \n18. \nAs  Bangladesh  currently  faces  a  power  deficit,  cost  savings  from  prevented  power \noutages  are  a  direct  tangible  economic  benefit  of  the  project  in  addition  to  any  resource  cost \nsavings achieved through replacement with alternative fuels and efficiency gains. Part A of the \nproject provides an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 70%, derived mainly from a large \nreduction  in  the  use  of  gas  per  unit  of  electricity  generated.  Part  B,  consisting  of  renewable \nenergy,  provides  only  a  marginal  EIRR  of  12%  because  of  high  capital  costs.  However,  its \n\n                                                \n9  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fdemonstration impact and avoided costs brought by reduced local pollution and climate change \nmitigation  are  additional  benefits  that  would  significantly  enhance  the  EIRR  if  quantified  and \nincluded. The integrated project provides an EIRR of 63.4%. Sensitivity analyses show project \nreturns  to  be  stable  against  changes  to  critical  variables  and  demonstrate  the  economic \nfeasibility of the project. \n \n19. \nThe  Clean  Development  Mechanism,  established  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  and \nmanaged  by  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change,  has  significant \npotential  to  provide  additional  carbon  financing  to  support  the  development  of  clean  energy \nprojects  that  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  Kyoto  Protocol  signatory  countries.  As \nBangladesh is a signatory of the  Kyoto Protocol, the project can benefit from carbon financing \nunder the Clean Development Mechanism.  \n \n20. \nPart A of the project, which replaces aging steam and gas turbine plants with a state-of-\nthe-art  CCPP,  will  avoid  300,000  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emissions  per  annum.  Part  B, \ninstalling solar photovoltaic, wind power, and LED lighting, will avoid emission of 25,000 tons of \nCO2  per  annum.  These  make  the  project  eligible  under  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism, \nwhich could improve its financial viability. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nArea \nInstitutional and \ncorporate governance \n\nAnticorruption \n\nProcurement \n\nTable 4: Governance Measures \nMeasures \n\nAPSC and BPDB will independently file tariff petitions with the Bangladesh \nEnergy Regulatory Commission. \n\nADB will review and examine any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or \ncoercive practices relating to the project.  \n\n(i)  Project management units are to be established, headed by senior officers \nreporting directly to the managing director of APSC and BPDB and the \nadditional secretary to the Power Division in the case of part B (iii). \n\n(ii)  Bid specifications and packaging are being prepared to ensure maximum \n\ncompetition under international competitive bidding procedures. \n(iii)  Information on procurement will be disclosed on company websites. \n(iv)  Procurement capacity support will be made available at the ADB Resident \n\nMission to expedite action on procurement issues. \n\nFinancial \nmanagement \nand audit \n\nestablished. \n\n(i)   Measurable financial performance indicators for APSC and BPDB have been \n\n(ii)   Expenditures, other financial transactions, and safe custody of project-\n\nfinanced assets will be monitored by the accounting and control systems of \nAPSC and BPDB. \n\n(iii)  Internal audit reports will be provided to the audit committees of the company \n\nboards of the respective companies. \n\n(iv)  Financial statements will be audited by independent auditors acceptable to \n\nADB and regularly published and reported to shareholders. \n\nGrievance review \n\nA grievance redress mechanism will be established to address issues relating to \nproject implementation. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  APSC  =  Ashuganj  Power  Station  Company,  BPDB  =  Bangladesh  Power \nDevelopment Board. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nThe government established its Anticorruption Commission in 2004, and ADB provided \n21. \ntechnical assistance to help build capacity and provide support for an integrated anticorruption \nstrategy.10 The  government  will  ensure  that  APSC  and  BPDB  have  operational  autonomy  and \nthat  no  organizational  changes  will  affect  their  ability  to  perform  their  obligations  under  the \nproject.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  government,  APSC,  BPDB,  and  the  Power  Division.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \nTable 4 summarizes major governance measures adopted for the project. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n22. \nBangladesh  remains  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in  the  world  with  nearly  half  of  its \npopulation  living  below  the  $1.25  poverty  line.  Lack  of  adequate  and  reliable  electricity  has \ncontributed to perpetuating poverty. Only 49% of the population has access to electricity. Even \nthose  with  electricity  face  power  shortages  and  poor  reliability  of  supply.  These  factors  have \nseverely  constrained  the  growth  of  industry  and  the  delivery  of  essential  services  (including \nhealth care and education) and contributed to environmental pollution and poverty. \n \n23. \nFrom  a  poverty  and  sustainability  perspective,  the  project  will  have  positive  benefits \nlocally  and  regionally  across  the  project  areas  of  influence.  Benefits  will  be  direct  and  indirect \nconsequences of increased access to reliable and clean energy supplies, allowing progressive \neconomic  and  social  development.  The  project  will  generate  a  considerable  number  of \ntemporary  and  permanent  jobs.  New  and  expanded  access  to  reliable  power  supplies  will \nenhance  the  production  capacity  of  industries  and  facilitate  new  commerce,  creating \nopportunities in agriculture, garment manufacture, and complementary businesses. \n \n24. \nImproved  power  supplies  will  lighten  women\u2019s  household  drudgery  and  enhance \nwomen\u2019s  energy-related  livelihood  opportunities.  Bangladesh\u2019s  commitment  to  integrating \ngender and social considerations in the energy sector was  agreed during a 1-day consultation \nmeeting  in  November  2010  with  the  Power  Division.  The  project  was  identified  for  integrating \ngender and social enhancement interventions. The inputs from the consultation have guided the \ndesign of the gender action plan, which includes as key design features (i) increasing women\u2019s \nparticipation  in energy-related  employment  and energy-based  livelihood  opportunities resulting \nfrom  the  loan;  (ii)  providing  technical  training  to  women  to  enable  them  to  maximize  these \nopportunities; (iii) a gender-sensitive user-education program and module to improve household \nenergy  efficiency;  and  (iv)  the  provision,  in  selected  project  sites,  of  improved  cook  stoves  to \nimprove  household  energy  efficiency,  reduce  women\u2019s  time  burden,  and  improve  women\u2019s \nhealth. A pilot project on enabling poor women\u2019s participation in the renewable energy sector in \nBangladesh that integrates these gender design features will be implemented on Hatiya Island. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n25. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  under  environmental  category  A  due  to  the \ninstallation of the 450 MW Ashuganj CCPP. The government also classified this component as \ncategory  A,  and  APSC  prepared  an  environmental  impact  assessment  in  May  2009  based  on \nthe  Environmental  Conservation  Rules  of  1997.  The  environmental  impact  assessment  was \napproved by the Department of Environment on 5 May 2010 and revised to conform with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n\n                                                \n10 ADB.  2003.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  Supporting  Good  Governance. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n26. \nThe Ashuganj CCPP will be located within the existing Ashuganj power station complex. \nThe  project  will  use  natural  gas  as  fuel  and  meet  the  cooling  water  requirements  of  6.4  cubic \nmeters  cubic  meters  per  second,  or  52,000  cubic  meters  per  gigawatt-hour,  using  water  from \nthe  Meghna  River,  which  will  be  released  back  to  the  river  after  3%\u20135%  loss,  or  1,500\u20132,600 \ncubic meters per gigawatt-hour. CCPP technology has high thermal efficiency, and a burner will \nbe  used  that  limits  the  formation  of  nitrogen  oxide.  A  pond  will  temporarily  hold  cooling  water \ndischarges,  and the  discharge  channel  will  have  adequate  turbulence to dissipate  heat  before \nits  final  discharge  back  into  the  Meghna  River.  The  plan  for  abandoning  the  replaced  power \nplant  units  will  be  prepared  by  APSC.  ADB  will  review  the  plan  prior  to  any  decommissioning \nworks. \n \nThe  other  subprojects  in  part  B  are  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  Initial \n27. \nenvironmental  examination  reports  have  been  prepared  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.  Part  B  will  utilize  clean  energy  technologies  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas \nemissions  by  25,460  tons  per  year.  The  subprojects  have  been  assessed  for  their  risk  and \nvulnerability  to climate change  impacts,  and design measures have  been  integrated to ensure \nthat these risks are minimized. The environmental impact assessment and initial environmental \nexamination  reports  were  publicly  disclosed  through  the  ADB  website  on  25 March  2011.  The \nEAs  are  committed  to  implementing  the  environmental  management  plan  and  submitting \nsemiannual environmental monitoring reports to ADB. \n \n28. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  under  involuntary  resettlement \ncategory B. Constructing the Ashuganj CCPP will require relocating 134 people11 to alternative, \nvacant, and suitable accommodation inside the Ashuganj industrial compound. Affected people \nhave been consulted on the process and consented to relocation under the terms promised by \nAPSC. Relocation will be fully managed by APSC through a resettlement plan, the provisions of \nwhich shall comply with the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement.  \n \n29. \nOther resettlement impacts include the acquisition of 3.5 hectares of small landholdings \non Hatiya, and minor and temporary nuisances and disturbances caused during the retrofitting \nand  upgrading  of  streetlights,  all  of  which  will  be  minimized  through mitigation.  Compensation \nfor any temporary or permanent loss of crops and trees will accord with entitlements indicated in \nresettlement  plans.  Care  will  be  taken  to  engage  and  consult  with  stakeholders  as  necessary \nand  in  a  culturally  sensitive  manner.  The  EAs  will  ensure  that  project  information  is  disclosed \nand  disseminated  to  project  stakeholders  in  a  timely  manner.  If,  during  implementation, \nadjustments  are  made  to  the  project,  these  will  be  reflected  in  the  entitlement  matrix  in \nconsultation with displaced and otherwise affected people.  \n \n30. \nIndigenous peoples. The project is classified under indigenous peoples category C. No \nindigenous  groups  have  been  identified  as  potentially  affected  by  the  project.  Additionally, \nwhere  worker  migration  is  required,  the  project  will  minimize  the  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  through \ninformation  dissemination  campaigns  at  project  areas  per  the  provisions  in  the  project \nadministration manual.12 \n \n\n                                                \n11  ASPC workers and family members, of which 42 workers are security guards.  \n12  Section VII (safeguards) and section VIII (gender and social) of the project administration manual (accessible from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n\f \n \n\n \n \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n9 \n\n \n\n31. \nThe  main  risks  to  the  project  are  to  part  A,  which  is  more  than  80%  of  the  total \ninvestment. The main risk to Ashuganj subproject viability is the absence of a long-term power \npurchase agreement (PPA) between APSC and BPDB. A provisional PPA signed between the \ntwo entities in 2005 was last reviewed in September 2009. BPDB will expedite developing long-\nterm PPAs for all the generating companies. \n\nThe other risk to the viability of the Ashuganj subproject is the possibility of reduced gas \n32. \nallocation  to  the  Ashuganj  power  station.  Considering  that  the  gas  requirement  for  the  new \npower  plant  is  less  than  that  of  the  power  plants  to  be  replaced,  the  gas  allocation  risk  is \nminimal.  Further,  Ashuganj  power  station  is  located  closer  to  the  gas  fields,  and  several  gas \npipelines  feed  the  power  station.  Therefore,  the  possibility  of  reduced  gas  availability  for  the \npower station is low. However, an assurance to this effect will be included in the loan agreement. \nFurther coordination between ADB and IDB on issues such as the sequencing of procurement, \ncontract  awards,  and  disbursements  is  critical  to  the  successful  implementation  of  the  project, \nparticularly  with  regard  to  the  envisioned  joint  procurement  in  part  A.  The  memorandum  of \nunderstanding expected to be signed between ADB and IDB will address this issue.  \n\n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5.  \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nBPDB and APSC fail to enter or \ndelay entering into long-term \nPPAs \n\nMitigating Measures \nBPDB will expedite developing long-term PPAs for all the generating \ncompanies. PPAs need to be reviewed by the Bangladesh Energy \nRegulatory Commission. \n\nCoordination between ADB and \nIDB on loan disbursements \n\nReduced gas allocation to the \nAshuganj power station over the \ncoming years  \n\nCoordination on issues such as the sequencing of procurement, \ncontract awards, and disbursements will be covered under loan \nagreements and a memorandum of understanding between ADB and \nIDB. \n\nAn assurance relating to maintaining the existing gas allocation to the \nAshuganj power station is included in loan documentation. \n\nLimited capacity of APSC and \nBPDB to implement project \ncomponents \n\nThe project components will be implemented as engineering, \nprocurement, and construction contracts, which will require minimal \nintervention from EAs.  \n\nIncrease in prices for raw \nmaterials \n\nLack of competition in the \nprocurement in renewable \nenergy components \n\nImplementation consultants will be provided to project management \nunits of the EAs. \n\nAdequate contingency amounts have been provided. Costs will be \npassed on to consumers through the PPAs to be endorsed by the \nBangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission. \n\nAppropriate clauses will be included in the bid documents to enable \nbidding to be cancelled if the number of bidders is inadequate. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  APSC  =  Ashuganj  Power  Station  Company,  BPDB  =  Bangladesh  Power \nDevelopment Board, IDB = Islamic Development Bank, PPA = power purchase agreement. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n34. \nThe  government,  APSC,  BPDB,  and  the  Power  Division  have  assured  ADB  that \nimplementation  of  the  project  will  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n35. \nThe  government,  APSC,  BPDB,  and  the  Power  Division  have  agreed  with  ADB  on \ncertain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  loan  agreement  and  project \nagreement.  The  government  has  also  agreed  with  ADB  that  effectiveness  of  the  loan  and \nproject agreements is conditional upon a subsidiary loan agreement, satisfactory to ADB, under \nwhich the loan proceeds are relent to APSC and BPDB. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n36. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  of  $300  million  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Power \nSystem  Efficiency  Improvement  Project
