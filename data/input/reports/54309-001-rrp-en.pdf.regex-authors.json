THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nCountercyclical Support Facility grant to the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) for the Health \nExpenditure and Livelihoods Support Program under the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \n(CPRO).1  \n \n2.  The program is part of an integrated package of assistance by the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to the FSM to support short-term efforts to mitigate the potential health consequences \nand socioeconomic impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. It is aligned with \nthe Pacific Approach\u2019s priority of managing risks and building economic resilience to protect the \npopulation from hardships;2 and the Strategy 2030 priority of directing ADB grant resources to the \nmost vulnerable developing member countries.3 The FSM meets all of the access criteria of ADB\u2019s \nCPRO, which include sound macroeconomic management, undertaking key structural reforms, a \npro-poor countercyclical expenditure program, and debt sustainability (Table 1).4   \n \nTable 1: Summary Assessment of Compliance with the Access Criteria for the \nCountercyclical Support Facility and the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \nAccess Criteria  ADB Assessment \n1. Adverse impact of  The FSM economy is projected to contract by 5.4% in FY2020 and by a further 1.8% in \nexogenous shock  FY2021. Total formal job losses across sectors are estimated at 1,975 (up to 70% are \nwomen) by the end of FY2021. Per capita income is expected to fall by 3.6% from FY2019 \nto FY2021, with the poverty rate rising from 32.3% to 36.8% over the same period. \nThis translates to more than 4,500 people falling below the poverty line, with more severe \nimpacts on female-headed households.  \n2. Countercyclical  The  government  has  approved  total  countercyclical  expenditures  of  $58.7  million \ndevelopment  ($28.6 million in FY2020 and $30.1 million in FY2021). Mainly funded through grants and \nexpenditure  funds realignment, these development expenditures include (i) a health action plan \n($29.0 million) on COVID-19 preparedness and response, (ii) an economic stimulus \npackage  ($18.4  million)  to  assist  affected  businesses  and  workers,  and  (iii)  social \nprotection programs ($11.3 million) for the poor and vulnerable groups.  \n3. Pre-shock record  The FSM\u2019s GDP grew by an average of 1.9% annually in FY2015\u2013FY2019, largely driven \nof generally sound  by the services sector (trade, financial intermediation, and real estate). Inflation was low, \nmacroeconomic  at 0.1%, over the same period. With higher grants and revenues (74.6% of GDP in \nmanagement  FY2015\u2013FY2019), and restraints on recurrent expenditure (at 59.8% of GDP), annual fiscal \nsurpluses rose to 14.8% of GDP in FY2015\u2013FY2019. The surpluses were used mainly to \nbuild up the FSM Trust Fund and reduce public debt.  \n4. Structural reforms   Strong actions in the form of early travel restrictions and border closures have prevented \na  COVID-19  outbreak.  The  government  is  implementing  a  COVID-19  Response \nFramework to develop quarantine and isolation facilities across the nation, provide \nmandatory infection control training for all first responders, and increase testing capacity \nand ventilators for each island state in the FSM. All four state hospitals are now equipped \nwith COVID-19 testing machines. Risk communication and community outreach are \nongoing to educate the public on COVID-19 awareness, in coordination with development \npartners. Under the 2023 action plan to enhance economic and financial stability, the \ngovernment is working to improve public financial management, strengthen tax reforms, \nand contain expenditures, including on the public wage bill. Annual contributions to the \nFSM Trust Fund were increased through laws mandating mandatory percentages from \nfishing license fees and corporate income taxes.  \n5. Debt sustainability  The FSM\u2019s public debt stock is relatively low (at 20% of GDP in FY2019), but the IMF \nclassifies the country to be at high risk of debt distress in view of the fiscal uncertainties \nafter FY2023, with the expiration of the economic provisions of the second Compact of \nFree Association with the US.

Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  The FSM is a remote Pacific small island developing state, encompassing 607 islands that \nare spread over the world\u2019s 14th largest geographic exclusive economic zone. It is a lower middle-\nincome island nation with a small population of 104,468 in 2018, of whom about 45% live in \nChuuk, 37% in Pohnpei, 11% in Yap, and 7% in Kosrae. The country is vulnerable to climate \nchange, facing frequent natural hazards and rising sea levels. The public sector dominates the \neconomy, with private economic activities focused mainly on subsistence farming and fishing, \nwholesale and retail trade, transportation, and tourism services. Less than 15% of the population \nwas in formal employment in 2010, with significantly more people directly or indirectly  depending \non them: those under the age of 15 (36%), outside the labor force (27%), or in the subsistence \nsector (16%).5 In FY2018, the government and public enterprises accounted for 32% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP), followed by households (26%), private enterprises (19%), and financial \ninstitutions (16%).6 The FSM has one of the highest estimated rates of poverty in the Pacific, with \n41% of the population living below the total poverty line and 10% below the food poverty line in \n2014.7 The United Nations Development Programme\u2019s Human Development Index ranked the \nFSM 135th out of 189 economies for 2019.8 \n \n4.  Despite the geographic isolation of the Pacific, the risk of COVID-19 transmission to \nvulnerable populations remains high, with confirmed cases in Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and \nSolomon Islands.9 As a small island developing state, the FSM faces distinct challenges in \naddressing  the  threat  of  the  pandemic,  such  as  weak  health  infrastructure,  geographically \ndispersed populations, and institutional capacity constraints. While COVID-19 has not yet spread \nto the FSM (no confirmed cases), the projected health, economic, and social impacts of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic are already significant. \n \n5.  Vulnerability to external shocks. The narrow economic base, reliance on external \nrevenue  sources,  and  vulnerability  to  climate  change  and  natural  hazards  make  the  FSM \nsusceptible to external shocks. The economy benefited greatly from the fishing industry, which \nhas attracted substantial increases in domestic revenues from fishing licenses sold to foreign \n \n5  FSM Office of Statistics, Budget, Overseas Development Assistance and Compact Management. 2012.

However, fiscal policy is dependent \non official development assistance and grants, particularly from the United States (US) via the \namended Compact of Free Association Agreement that became effective in 2004.10 Compact \ngrants provide funding for education, health, private sector development, environment, public \nsector capacity building, and enhancing reporting and accountability. The annual sector grants \nstarted at $76 million in FY2004 and have been reduced by $0.8 million annually since FY2007. \nThe difference between the total contribution and the annual sector grant levels is deposited into \nthe Compact Trust Fund (CTF). Compact grants, at around 20% of GDP, are projected to be \nreplaced by investment returns from the CTF (expected to be around 11% of GDP) beyond 2024, \na substantial reduction in revenues.  Unless arrangements under the Compact are renewed \nbefore expiry in 2023, the FSM\u2019s fiscal position will experience severe revenue volatility afterward.  \n \n6.  Weak health system and preparedness to deal with a pandemic outbreak. The state \ngovernments manage and regulate the FSM\u2019s health care system. Each of the four states has a \nmain public hospital, and the country has one private hospital. At the municipal level, including \nthe outlying islands, health care is available only through dispensaries, which function as health \nclinics  for  basic  diagnosis  and  treatment.  The  FSM  lacks  the  health  infrastructure  and \npreparedness to cope with a pandemic outbreak, with less than 20 beds available for the isolation \nof suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, and isolation rooms only available in one of the \nfour  island  states.  Essential  medical  supplies  and  equipment,  such  as  personal  protective \nequipment and ventilators, have arrived in the FSM in batches; and the training of frontline \nworkers has yet to be completed. The capacity to undertake infectious disease surveillance and \ncontact tracing is limited, with inadequate routine reporting of severe acute respiratory illnesses \nand influenza-like illnesses. The FSM has only 38 skilled health workers per 10,000 population, \nshort of the recommended indicator of 59.4 of the World Health Organization (WHO).11 \n \n7.  The high incidence of noncommunicable diseases and comorbidities in the FSM increases \nits population\u2019s susceptibility to COVID-19, and to the risk of a heightened mortality rate. A \nCOVID-19 outbreak would be even more challenging for people living in communal and informal \nsettlements, which are densely populated and have poor access to basic services such as health \ncare, water, and sanitation facilities. The impact of a localized epidemic in the Pacific was seen \nin October 2019 during a measles outbreak in Samoa. The FSM has had epidemic outbreaks \nrelated to dengue and waterborne diseases, which have been expensive for the cash-strapped \nstate  and  national  health  departments.  In  2019,  the  Global  Health  Security  Index,  which \nbenchmarks countries on pandemic preparedness, ranked the FSM 124th of 195 countries.12 \n \n8.  Strong government measures to contain the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic. The \ngovernment enacted strong and timely containment measures to limit the risk of a local outbreak \nby introducing travel restrictions and closing its borders, requiring 14-day self-quarantine in a \nCOVID-19-free area before entry to the FSM, restricting residents from traveling abroad and \nimplementing social distancing standards. A state of public health emergency remains in effect \nsince  31  January  2020.  The  government  has  been  implementing  its  COVID-19  Response \nFramework, with important progress in strengthening health screening and surveillance at points \nof entry in airports and seaports, and in procuring essential medical supplies and equipment. All \nfour state hospitals have COVID-19 testing capacity. While these measures are critical from a \n \n10 The Compact of Free Association between the FSM and the US provides for US economic assistance (including \neligibility for certain US federal programs) and defense of the FSM in exchange for US military and other operating \nrights within the FSM\u2019s territory.

The  FSM\u2019s  economy  has \ngenerally been performing well in the past 5 years, with GDP growth averaging 1.9% per annum \nin FY2015\u2013FY2019 (Table 2 and Appendix 4). Its fiscal position has recorded budget surpluses \nbecause of strong revenues from fishing license fees and large-scale offshore corporate tax \npayments,  while  expenditures  (in  particular,  public  sector  wages)  were  restrained.13 With \nrevenues averaging 74.6% of GDP, while expenditure was 59.8% of GDP, the average surplus \nwas 14.8% of GDP in FY2015\u2013FY2019. The government has been allocating a significant part of \nthe fiscal surplus to its sovereign wealth fund, the FSM Trust Fund, which totaled $270 million at \nthe end of FY2019.14  \n \nTable 2: Pre\u2013COVID-19 Macroeconomic Indicators \nItem  FY2015  FY2016  FY2017  FY2018  FY2019e \nGDP growth (%, constant prices)  4.6   0.9   2.7   0.2   1.2  \nInflation (CPI period average)  0.0   (1.0)  0.7   1.7   (1.0) \nTotal revenue (% of GDP)  36.9   35.9   41.3   53.7   53.3  \nTotal revenue and grants (% of GDP)  66.1   69.0   78.3   79.9   79.8  \nExpenditure (% of GDP)  55.7   61.7   63.9   55.6   62.2  \nOverall fiscal surplus (deficit) (% of GDP)  10.4   7.3   14.3   24.3   17.6  \nGross external public debt (% of GDP)  25.6   24.2   21.9   18.9   20.2  \nCurrent account balance (% of GDP)  3.6   7.2   10.3   20.4   24.8  \n( ) = negative, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, CPI = consumer price index, e = estimates, FY = fiscal year, \nGDP = gross domestic product.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates; and Graduate School USA Pacific Island Training Initiative. 2019. \nFederated States of Micronesia FY2018 Statistical Appendices.

Extended border closures amid the pandemic are projected to result in economic \ncontractions of 5.4% in FY2020 and 1.8% in FY2021, largely through constraints on trade and \ntravel flows affecting agriculture and services.15 Table 3 summarizes the adverse economic \nconsequences of the pandemic for the FSM through several channels. \n \nTable 3: Key Transmission Channels for COVID-19 \nTransmission  Issues \nChannel \nAgriculture  Agriculture is largely based on smallholder farms producing root crops, vegetables, fruit, and \nlivestock for household consumption and local sale. Commercial agriculture remains largely \nundeveloped. Although 63% of households engage in agriculture activities, only 24% sell any of \ntheir production. Hence, agriculture\u2019s contribution to GDP remained low at an average of 14% in \nFY2015\u2013FY2019. Restrictions on international and local travel constricted demand, severely \nlimiting opportunities available to small farmers to sell their produce.  \nFisheries  Although fisheries contributed only about 11.5% of GDP in FY2015\u2013FY2018, royalties from fishing \nlicense fees increased significantly from 6.0% of GDP in FY2011 to an average of 19.4% of GDP \nin FY2015\u2013FY2018. Travel and quarantine restrictions have prevented purse seine fishing vessels, \n \n13  In 2005, the FSM passed corporate tax legislation that enabled the creation of an overseas domicile for companies \nwith a corporate tax rate of 21%, which makes the FSM an attractive domicile (primarily for Japanese captive \ninsurance companies and other corporations).  \n14  Under a series of legislation (Public Law 18-107 and Public Law 20-134), the government has specified annual \ncommitments to the fund. Under Public Law 20-134, it allocated 50% of corporate tax earnings from the captive \ninsurance and large corporation segment to the FSM Trust Fund (about $6 million in normal years). It also allocated \n20% of fishing fee revenue to the fund (about $12 million). In total, the government has legislated to contribute \n$24 million annually to the FSM Trust Fund on a conservative basis.  \n15 ADB. 2020.

Transshipment output is \nexpected to fall by more than a third from FY2020 to FY2021. Container vessel visits have also \nfallen, especially to the two smaller states of Yap and Kosrae. Fishing license fee revenues are \nexpected to decline from 20.6% of GDP in FY2019 to 18.0% in FY2020 and 16.2% in FY2021. \nTrade and travel restrictions are also affecting small-scale exporters of fish and other agricultural \nproducts, which are transported by air cargo or hand-carried by travelers.   \nTourism  Tourism-related industries contributed revenues of about $43 million in 2019 (15.3% of total \nrevenues and grants). It is one of the largest formal sector employers outside the public sector, \nemploying 1,048 people directly in FY2019 and more indirectly through ancillary services. More \nthan 60% of employees in accommodation and food service activities are women. The hotel and \nrestaurant industry, which caters mostly to overseas and interstate visitors, is projected to lose \n669 jobs. It accounted for 6.7% of formal employment in FY2019 and 1.7% of GDP during FY2016\u2013\nFY2018 but is projected to fall by 46% in FY2020 and a further 75% in FY2021.  \nTransport and  With international passenger flights reduced to one flight per month and only outbound traffic \ntrade  permitted, the cargo airline that picks up fresh fish from Pohnpei and Kosrae provides a cargo \nservice 3 days a week, which allows continued imports by air of critical medical equipment and \nsupplies. The country also depends on food imports, which creates an added challenge of ensuring \nfood security during the pandemic crisis. Despite some difficulties with transport to the outer islands \nand delays related to quarantine restrictions, no shortages of supplies have been reported. The \ntransport sector is projected to decline by 27% in FY2020 and a further 14% in FY2021.

Economic contraction deepens. The continued threat of COVID-19 and the closure of \nthe FSM\u2019s borders are severely affecting the economic activities and livelihoods of its already \nsmall and vulnerable population. Total formal job losses across sectors are projected to reach \n1,975 (of whom women may account for up to 70%) by the end of FY2021, a 12% drop from \nFY2019 employment levels.16 Unemployment will be more significant in the private sector. \nPoverty levels are heightened for people in the informal economy, comprising small businesses \nand individual workers, as businesses shut down and those reliant on the cash-based enterprises \nlose their income. As the FSM also depends on food imports, the loss of employment and reduced \nincomes create the added challenge of ensuring food security. Increasing poverty levels heighten \nthe vulnerability of women, children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. All these shocks \nhave an adverse effect on the government\u2019s fiscal position, creating urgent financing needs. In \nthe event of a COVID-19 outbreak in the FSM and community transmission, the negative \neconomic and social impact could be more severe than anticipated.  \n \n12.  Gender impacts.

Indirect health risks include worsening health outcomes for women \nand girls, as essential services such as maternal and reproductive health have a lower priority \nbecause of COVID-19 and women may be reluctant to seek health care because of fear of \nCOVID-19 infection. Women are more vulnerable to economic hardships given their reliance on \nremittances and informal work, particularly in travel and tourism-related industries. In the formal \nsector, 39% of employees were women, who received 36% of gross earnings and earned 13% \nless than men, on average.17 About 20% of total households are female-headed, and they face \nan increased risk of poverty. Before the COVID-19 crisis, 50% of female-headed households were \nbelow the poverty line compared with 39% of male-headed households. Existing prevalence data \nindicate that one in three women in the FSM have experienced some form of gender-based \nviolence (GBV) in their lifetime, and this is likely to increase because of COVID-19 measures.18 \n  \nB.

It  also  includes  a  risk \ncommunication  plan  that  guides  the  mitigation  interventions  in  the  event  of  community \ntransmission. As the pandemic shows no signs of abating, the government is increasing the health \nstimulus by another $9 million as part of the FY2021 budget to include a vulnerable population \nmitigation plan to decentralize clinical services and establish remote consultation options for \nvulnerable groups, such as the elderly and those with pre-existing comorbidities. \n \n15.  Economic Stimulus Package ($18.4 million). In March 2020, the FSM Congress passed \nPublic Law 21-104 setting up the Tourism Mitigation Fund, appropriating an initial $1 million of \nfinancial assistance for the tourism industry, which is heavily affected by travel restrictions and \nborder closures. As COVID-19 evolved into a global pandemic, with a sustained and deep impact \non the economy, the government formulated the Economic Stimulus Package (ESP). On 22 April \n2020, the government passed Public Law 21-105, which temporarily diverts funding from fishing \naccess fees and revenue derived from major corporations to the country\u2019s ESP, which otherwise \nwould have been diverted to the FSM Trust Fund. The ESP includes: \n(i)  Financial support to an estimated 186 affected tourism businesses that have been \nheavily hit by the pandemic through the provision of wage subsidies, interest \npayment relief on business loans, and social security and gross revenue tax \nrebates to help cushion the impact on economic activity and protect job losses. \nAssistance  will  also  be  expanded  to  other  business  sectors  affected  by  the \npandemic, subject to approval by Congress.  \n(ii)  A concessional credit line through the FSM Development Bank to provide loans to \nat least 200 micro and small enterprises, with up to 50% of the loan amount to be \nallocated to women-owned businesses. This provides access to affordable credit \nand grants to support the growth of microenterprises and small businesses.  \n(iii)  Temporary  unemployment  assistance  to  support  an  estimated  100  migrant \nworkers who have lost their jobs because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n \n16.  The program will support the implementation of the FY2021 stimulus response. The ESP \nis complemented by a separate grant of $36 million from the US through a temporary Pandemic \nUnemployment Assistance (PUA) program for both US and FSM citizens in the country who have \nlost their jobs or suffered reduced hours as a direct result of the pandemic.20  \n \n17.  Social protection programs ($11.3 million). Recognizing the severe challenges and \nvulnerabilities facing the poor, the elderly, persons with disabilities, and survivors of GBV during \nthe crisis, the government developed social protection programs (SPP) comprising:21   \n(i)  Cash transfer grants to support an estimated total of 4,500 low-income households \noutside the PUA program (inclusive of low-income female-headed households). \n \n20 In March 2020, the Government of the US signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, \n2020, creating the temporary PUA program. Eligible individuals receive a minimum payment of $166 per week \nbackdated from 27 January up to the end of December 2020. The FSM Department of Finance and Administration \nadministers the PUA and the US Department of Labor oversees the PUA program. The PUA, like all grants, flows \nthrough the FSM Government General Fund account. Only off-budget amounts are in-kind grants (medical equipment \nand supplies). \n21 Details of the estimated number of target beneficiaries, eligibility criteria, and implementation mechanisms (including \ngrievance mechanisms) of the subcomponents under the ESP and SPP are in the Summary of Economic and Social \nProtection Measures of the Government\u2019s COVID-19 Response Program (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2).  \n ", "8 \nThis will provide temporary cash relief for affected informal workers to help meet \ntheir immediate cash needs in the absence of any income replacement. \n(ii)  A food security program for community groups and low-income households to \nenhance  food  production  through  subsistence  livelihood  training  and  the \ndistribution of seeds, planting, and fishing materials at no cost. \n(iii)  COVID-19  community-based  small  grants,  working  with  nongovernment \norganizations and civil society organizations to strengthen community awareness \nof COVID-19; education on handwashing and social distancing; distribution of \nsoaps, masks, and information materials to remote areas; and adapting GBV \nservice provision, including pilot testing a GBV hotline in Pohnpei.  \n(iv)  Financial assistance to vulnerable groups (including low-income households, the \nelderly, persons with disabilities, and survivors of GBV) through (a) temporary \nwaivers of medical expenses not included under the Compact Funds (i.e., in-\npatient, medicine, ambulance, transportation from households to hospitals, and \nphysical  therapy);  (b)  electricity  subsidies  to  an  estimated  2,000  low-income \nhouseholds with dependents who have disabilities; (c) the distribution of solar \nlamps to at least 5,000 households on the outer islands, which are not connected \nto the grid; and (d) clinical management of rape and intimate partner violence kits \nand consultation options for survivors of GBV in community health centers. \n(v)  One-off cash payments to an estimated 900 stranded FSM citizens and students \nabroad.  \n \nC.  Proposed Program, Impact, and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n18.  The government has requested CPRO assistance. The proposed program will provide the \ngovernment with fiscal space and timely support for the implementation of its countercyclical \nCOVID-19 response. It will contribute to the government\u2019s efforts in containing the pandemic and \naddressing its economic and social impacts, particularly on the poor and vulnerable. The effect of \nthe program will be adverse effects of COVID-19 on the FSM\u2019s citizens and businesses reduced. \nThe program will have three outputs: (i) measures to combat the entry and spread of COVID-19 \nin  the  FSM  delivered;  (ii)  measures  to  provide  economic  stimulus  relief  to  businesses \nimplemented; and (iii) measures to provide social protection to poor and vulnerable groups \nenhanced. The program is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030\u2019s operational priorities of \naddressing remaining poverty and reducing inequality, accelerating progress in gender equality, \nand strengthening governance and institutional capacity. The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1. \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s  value  addition.  The  program  is  part  of  a  comprehensive  package  of  ADB \nassistance that covers the immediate response to COVID-19, short-term financing support for the \ngovernment\u2019s fiscal response to manage adverse socioeconomic impacts, and medium-term \ninterventions to promote recovery and resilience. In the immediate aftermath of the pandemic, the \nFSM drew down $6 million in grants from the Pacific Disaster Resilience Program for contingent \ndisaster financing.22 ADB provided $474,000 in technical assistance (TA) and collaborated with \nUNICEF in the procurement of essential medical equipment and supplies.23 The FSM also \naccessed $470,000 from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund to meet immediate financing \ngaps, such as overtime renumeration for frontline workers, quarantine and contact tracing costs \nof suspected COVID-19 patients, and other logistics costs. The FSM received a further allocation \nof $1.03 million from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund, financed by the Government of \n \n22 ADB. 2017.

ADB\u2019s regular dialogue with the government was key \nin the design of the SPP. In terms of post-COVID-19 recovery efforts, ADB will continue to support \nclimate and disaster-resilient infrastructure; build a social protection system for the poor and \nvulnerable groups; reorient the design of health and social sector projects to strengthen the \nresilience of the FSM to health emergencies and outbreaks; and replenish the contingent disaster \nfinancing for future disasters caused by natural hazards and health emergencies.25 ADB is \nworking closely with key development partners in the Pacific to encourage policy and legislative \nreforms that will strengthen the business environment, spur investment and private sector-led \ngrowth, and support financial inclusion, including for women.  \n \n20.  Lessons learned. The program applies lessons from ADB\u2019s experience in providing \nbudget support for effective countercyclical aid to its developing member countries in response to \ncrises, as evident in the Economic Recovery Support Programs for Pacific countries during the \n2008 global financial crisis.26 Timeliness is critical in crisis response\u2014earlier responses are \nusually  more  effective.  Social  protection  programs  are  also  effective  crisis-mitigating  and \nresponse instruments, as they protect the poor and vulnerable who are the first to be affected by \na crisis. The program leverages these lessons and ensures that ADB support is timely and \ntargeted at the poor and vulnerable groups. \n \n21.  Development partner coordination. To ensure the pandemic responses are well-aligned \nand complementary, ADB coordinated with partners during virtual country programming and fact-\nfinding  missions  in  July  and  August  2020. 27  ADB  provided  immediate  support  for  the \nimplementation of the government\u2019s stimulus response for FY2020, under various TA funds (para. \n19). The government also received funds and donations of medical supplies and equipment from \npartners. The US provided (i) an emergency allocation of $7 million from unexpended Compact \nsector grant funds for health sector needs; (ii) a $36 million PUA to compensate for job losses \nunder the US Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (para. 16); and (iii) an allocation \nof about $1.3 million from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s emergency \nresponse. The World Bank provided $2.5 million contingency emergency response for health \nsector preparedness and the procurement of medical supplies. The People\u2019s Republic of China \nand the Government of Japan provided cash donations and in-kind assistance through medical \nmasks, protective clothing for first responders, and medical supplies.  \n \n22.  ADB took the lead in coordinating policy advice from development partners to support the \ngovernment in preparing the ESP and SPP. The WHO, together with UNICEF, Micronesia Red \nCross,  and  local  nongovernment  organizations,  is  supporting  the  FSM  in  implementing  a \ncomprehensive COVID-19 community outreach package that aims to empower communities to \nprotect themselves from COVID-19 infection. This will also be supported by community-based \nsmall grants under the program.  Moreover, ADB and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have \nhad regular bilateral meetings on macroeconomic and fiscal issues through participation during \nArticle IV  missions  (the  latest  was  held  in  June  2019  in  Pohnpei),  and  as  part  of  wider \ndevelopment partner discussions on supporting the government during the crisis.

Development Financing Needs and Budget Support  \n \n23.  Financing needs. Because of the adverse economic and fiscal impact of the COVID-19 \npandemic, the government\u2019s financing needs are projected to increase to $16.5 million in FY2020 \nand a further $33.4 million in FY2021. The government has requested a grant not exceeding \n$14.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the \nprogram. The grant proceeds will support development financing needs. The government also \nplans to seek additional grants from development partners. In the absence of further grants, the \ngovernment plans to reprioritize expenditures, mobilize revenues, or rely on domestic resource \nefforts to help narrow the financing gap (Table 5).  \n \nTable 5: Federated States of Micronesia\u2014Development Financing Needs, \nFY2020 and FY2021  \n($ million) \nFY2020  FY2021 \nMajor Budget Categories  Pre- COVID-19  Pre- COVID-19  % of \n  COVID-19  Adjusted  % of GDP  COVID-19  Adjusted  GDP \nRevenues  283.2  252.4  74.4  286.1  236.0  69.7 \nExpenditures  257.2  268.9  79.3  260.5  269.4  79.6 \nOverall Fiscal Balance    26.0    (16.5)    (4.9)    25.6    (33.4)    (9.9) \nTotal Financing Needs   (26.0)    16.5    4.9    (25.6)    33.4    9.9 \nFSM Trust Fund   (26.0)        (25.6)     \nRealignment and transfer from      5.5    1.6      17.0    5.0 \ndomestic funds \n ADB CDF      6.0    1.8       \nADB CPRO            14.0    4.0 \nWorld Bank      2.5    0.7       \nTo be determined      (2.5)        (2.4)   \n( ) = negative, ADB = Asian Development Bank, CDF = contingent disaster financing, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, \nCPRO = COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product.  \nNote: Realignments under consideration by the government include the reduction of travel budgets, contractual \nservices, and other nonessential spending, as well as further diversion of fishing license and corporate income tax \nrevenues toward the Economic Stimulus Package and the Tourism Mitigation Fund.

(pre-COVID-19); and ADB estimates, based \non data provided by the Government of the FSM, Department of Finance and Administration (adjusted for COVID-19). \n \n24.  Debt sustainability. No new loans are expected within the forecast horizon, as the deficits \nare expected to be financed through external grants and the realignment of domestic resources. \nBefore COVID-19, the IMF\u2019s debt sustainability analysis (DSA) assessed the FSM to be at high \nrisk of external and overall debt distress in 2019. The analysis suggests that DSA thresholds on \nthe present value of external debt will be breached within a 20-year horizon. With the outbreak of \nCOVID-19, the FSM economy is now projected to contract while fiscal deficit is expected to \ndeteriorate further, thereby, increasing the public debt\u2013GDP ratio moderately. DSAs by ADB and \nthe IMF (through a June 2020 assessment letter) maintains the high risk of debt distress rating \nbut concludes that the FSM\u2019s public debt remains sustainable. The high risk of debt distress stems \nfrom a projected fall in revenues in FY2024, with greater revenue volatility afterward, unless \neconomic  provisions  of  the  Compact  Agreement  are  renewed.  Compact  grants  and  fiscal \ntransfers totaling 20% of GDP will expire in FY2023 and be replaced by investment returns \naccruing to the CTF, projected at about 11% of GDP in FY2024. While debt is expected to be \nfinanced by non-debt creating flows (such as grants), the risk of a fiscal cliff after FY2023 remains. \nADB\u2019s assessment corroborates these views. Although economic contraction is expected to be \nmore severe than the IMF\u2019s post\u2013COVID-19 assessment (\u20135.4% in FY2020 and \u20131.8% in \nFY2021), the revenue shortfall is expected to be covered by grants from development partners \nand the realignment of domestic revenues and expenditures. Hence, the debt\u2013GDP ratio will \nremain sustainable. However, longer containment measures and a further decline in domestic \n ", "11 \nand external demand could have a potential adverse impact on macroeconomic stability and \ncompromise the debt\u2013GDP trajectory. Nevertheless, the analysis suggests the overall debt\u2013GDP \nratio will remain sustainable in the medium to long run. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.  A program steering committee co-chaired by the secretary of finance and administration \nand the secretary of health, and comprising key government officials from the Department of \nFinance and Administration (DFA) and the implementing agencies, and the finance directors of \neach state government\u2014will oversee and monitor the budget execution and flow of funds for \ncountercyclical measures through the DFA\u2019s monthly reports. The program steering committee \nwill provide a monthly update to the President of the FSM on the program\u2019s overall progress and \noutcomes. The DFA will be the executing agency for the program and will oversee and coordinate \nthe  program  implementation.  The  implementing  agencies  will  include  (i)  the  DFA,  (ii)  the \nDepartment of Health and Social Affairs, (iii) the Department of Resource and Development, and \n(iv) the FSM Development Bank, to ensure the efficient implementation, monitoring, and reporting \nof the C-HAP, ESP, and SPP. The ESP and SPP will mostly use implementation mechanisms \nalready established for the PUA to reach the target beneficiaries. The implementation of the C-\nHAP will be reported through the National COVID-19 Taskforce. The implementing agencies will \npartner with municipal governments, nongovernment organizations, or civil society organizations \nto provide welfare services to the poor and vulnerable. ADB TA will support the implementation \nof targeted schemes for the poor and vulnerable groups, and monitoring of social outcomes using \nsex-disaggregated data.29 The executing agency will provide quarterly reporting to ADB for \nmonitoring of the program outcomes and indicators, as specified in the design and monitoring \nframework, summary of economic and social protection measures of the government\u2019s COVID-\n19 response program and gender monitoring matrix. The program will be implemented from 1 \nDecember 2020 to 30 September 2021. The proceeds of the policy-based grant will be withdrawn, \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n26.  Governance. The FSM\u2019s strong recent record of sound fiscal management is exhibited \nby the achievement of annual consolidated fiscal surpluses since FY2012, as well as the steady \nbuildup of fiscal buffers in the FSM Trust Fund, which has more than quadrupled in value since \nFY2015. However, the latest IMF assessments point to lingering weaknesses in public financial \nmanagement  (PFM),  including  inadequate  procurement  procedures  and  deficiencies  in  the \nscreening of capital projects.30 A Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability self-assessment \nwas conducted by the government in 2016 to assess progress made since the FSM\u2019s first formal \nPublic Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment conducted in coordination with the \nPacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre in 2013. The resulting PFM Roadmap, 2017\u20132020 \nprioritizes (i) implementing a new financial management information system (currently supported \nby  a  World  Bank  project);  (ii)  reviewing  and  updating  the  FSM\u2019s  financial  management \nregulations;  (iii)  improving  reporting  standards,  including  through  a  new  DFA  website;  and \n(iv) sustaining capacity development efforts, particularly in accounting, auditing, and financial \nmanagement. 31 The  President  of  the  FSM  approved  the  updated  financial  management \nregulations  in  February  2019\u2014strengthening  integrity  in  PFM\u2014but  final  thresholds  for \nprocurement, asset capitalization, and open bidding in the public sector remain pending with \n \n29 ADB. 2020.

Based on ADB\u2019s 2018 country performance assessment, the country\u2019s \nratings are particularly low (2.0\u20132.5 on a scale of 1.0\u20136.0, where higher scores indicate better \nresults) for critical areas including the business regulatory environment, the equity of public \nresource use, and the quality of public administration.32 Thus, further interventions in the FSM will \nbe anchored on lessons from ADB\u2019s ongoing regional TA supporting effective and sustainable \ndelivery of development results in fragile situations in the Pacific.33 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \n27.  Social and poverty impact. The government\u2019s comprehensive and targeted schemes for \npoor households and vulnerable groups will prevent poverty exacerbation. A cumulative increase \nin real per capita incomes of 10.8% during FY2014\u2013FY2019 is estimated to have reduced poverty \nincidence to 32.3% just before the COVID-19 crisis, but the projected 6.9% contraction in incomes \nhas the potential to push poverty back to 36.8% of the population by the end of FY2021.34 \nUnconditional  cash relief targeted  at  low-income  households  and  those  outside the formal \neconomy will provide supplementary income and avoid negative coping mechanisms such as \nselling assets and incurring debts to support basic needs. These households are likely to have \nmore children, be female-headed, have lower education attainment levels, and be without a \nreliable source of income. The risks of heightened vulnerability of persons with disabilities, \nchildren, and the elderly from lack of access to services and adequate food supply will be \naddressed through additional cash assistance, utility subsidies, and medical waivers. A targeted \napproach will prevent their welfare from being compromised during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n28.  Gender.  The  program  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming.35 The  program \nincludes proactive measures to reduce key negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and \nsupport women and girls\u2019 health and economic empowerment. Schemes supporting women \nemployees and women-owned businesses include (i) support to tourism-related businesses to \nmaintain employees and pay salaries, including 418 female employees (out of 863 employees); \n(ii) support to 14 women-owned tourism businesses (out of 186 total businesses); and (iii) support \nto women migrant workers in the tourism industry who have become unemployed because of \nCOVID-19. In addition, grants and loans will be offered to micro and small enterprises, with a \ntarget of 100 women-owned enterprises. Several schemes support low-income households and \nfemale-headed households, including (i) a one-off cash transfer scheme for 4,500 households \nwith additional payments for those with caring responsibilities, such as children and the elderly; \nand (ii) a utility subsidy allowance for at least 2000 households. Actions to prevent and respond \nto GBV include (i) provision for the clinical management of rape and intimate partner violence in \neight health clinics across all states; (ii) medical waivers for survivors of GBV; and (iii) measures \nto  establish  GBV  services  and  referral  pathways. Women\u2019s  health  is further  supported  by \nringfencing budget for maternal, child, and reproductive health services; and investing in providing \nquality decentralized services so that women and girls do not need to travel to a hospital and put \nthemselves at increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Finally, the community-based COVID-19 \npreparedness scheme supports women\u2019s organizations, and all proposals will be assessed on \ngender equality criteria.   \n \n29.  Safeguards.

Adverse impact of  The FSM economy is projected to contract by 5.4% in FY2020 (ends 30 September 2020) and by a further 1.8% \nexogenous shock  in FY2021 (Figure 1). This reflects adverse impacts of ongoing border closures and social-distancing measures \non agriculture and fisheries, trade, transportation, and tourism-related services sectors, as well as on the \nimplementation of infrastructure projects. The temporary closure of the fisheries observer program which monitors \nthe fish catch of the purse seine fleet and reduced demand for vessel days result in loss of revenues.  \nThe economic contraction, can result in the loss of 1,975 full-time formal sector jobs by FY2021, representing a \n12% drop from FY2019 levels.a  With losses concentrated in hotels and restaurant (671); transport, storage, and \ncommunications (585); public administration, education, and health (476); and wholesale and retail trade (132). \nUp to 70% of those who are expected to lose their jobs are women (around 1,400). While some women would \nmove to the subsistence sector, more are expected to withdraw from the labor market leading to greater \nvulnerability. \nPer capita income is seen to fall by 3.6% from $3,427 in FY2019 to $3,305 in FY2021 (Table 1). An additional \n4,500 people can be pushed below the poverty line with poverty rates rising from 32.3% in FY2019 to 36.8% in \nFY2021 (Figure 2). Female-headed households, accounting for 20% of total, are expected to be more severely \naffected with poverty rates at 50%, compared to 39% for male-headed households.b  \n \n  \n2. Countercyclical  To address the emergency and immediate financing requirements caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the \ndevelopment expenditure  government has approved a total package of $28.6 million in FY2020 (8.4% of GDP) and $30.1 million in FY2021 \n(8.9% of GDP). Key components of these development expenditures, include (i) a health action plan ($29 million) \non COVID-19 preparedness and mitigation response; (ii) an economic stimulus package ($18.4 million) which \n ", "  Appendix 4  23 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Assessment \nincludes a Tourism Mitigation Fund, pandemic unemployment assistance, and for concessional loans to micro and \nsmall enterprises, with mandatory allocation of 50% of the total loan amount supporting women-owned enterprises; \nand (iii) social protection programs ($11.3 million) for the poor and vulnerable groups, including women, elderly, \npersons with disabilities, and victims of gender-based violence and sexual abuse. These are mainly funded through \ndevelopment partner grants, with the rest through realignment of domestic expenditures and funds, including \nintended contributions to the FSM Trust Fund. \n 3. Pre-shock record of  After contracting by an average of 2.6% of GDP annually in FY2012\u2013FY2014, the economy grew by an average \ngenerally sound  of 1.9% annually in FY2015\u2013FY2019. Main contributors were in the services sector: wholesale and retail trade, \nmacroeconomic  real estate, and financial intermediation. Transport and communications, public administration, and agriculture and \nmanagement  fisheries also contributed to the growth. The FSM had been running annual fiscal surpluses since FY2009, except \nfor a small deficit (1.8% of GDP) incurred in FY2011. Total grants and revenues\u2014mainly from fishing license fees \nand corporate income tax from offshore companies reached 74.6% of GDP in FY2015\u2013FY2019, while total \nexpenditure was only 59.9% of GDP\u2014mainly due to restraint on the public sector wage bill. Fiscal surpluses rose \nsharply in FY2015\u2013FY2019, averaging 14.1% of GDP (Figure 3). These fiscal surpluses were used mainly to build \nup the FSM Trust Fund, which increased from $22 million in FY2014 to $270 million by FY2019 (the trust fund can \nonly be drawn upon after FY2023 when the economic provisions under the Compact Agreement with the US \nexpire). The surplus was also used to reduce external debt from $81.1 million in FY2014 to $71.1million in FY2019 \n(from 28.1% of GDP to 20.2%). \n4. Structural reforms  In preparation of a potential reduction in revenues with the expiration of the economic provisions of the US \nCompact in 2023, the government unveiled in 2014 the 2023 Action Plan. Aimed to enhance economic and \nfinancial stability, the plan set goals in terms of revenue enhancement, expenditure management, and overall \neconomic reform. In FY2015, pay structure and staff grading of national government were reviewed and revised, \nrestraining increases in the public wage bill. Annual contributions to the FSM Trust Fund was increased through a \nseries of laws mandating mandatory percentages from fishing license fees and corporate income taxes. The share \nof state governments from the Compact Fund was also increased, providing additional resources for states for \nsocial spending. Since 2017, tax collection methods have been enhanced with further improvements expected as \nthe  new  automated  Revenue  Management  System  is  implemented  in  FY2020.  In  FY2019,  the  Financial \nManagement Act and related internal procedures were also updated. \nBoth the national and state governments took early and pre-emptive actions to contain the threat of the pandemic \noutside FSM borders. Interventions include the declaration of National Public Health Emergency which remains in \neffect; closure of borders for all international arrivals; mandatory health screenings of interstate travelers; and \nschool closures. The government, with technical support from WHO and UN, has developed a COVID-19 \nResponse Framework, which is the platform of the country\u2019s COVID-19 Health Action Plan (C-HAP) to strengthen \nthe health system\u2019s capacity for surveillance and early detection of diseases, infection prevention control, \nquarantine,  isolation,  contact  tracing,  clinical  case  management,  and  laboratory  for  local  testing.  Risk \ncommunication and community outreach are also being implemented, in coordination with development partners, \n ", "24  Appendix 4 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Assessment \nto create public awareness on COVID-19. This framework also guides the mitigation interventions at both national \nand state levels, and across five scenarios based on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases with an operational \nbudget disaggregated by sector and across the four states. The country has made progress in strengthening health \nscreening and surveillance at point-of-entry in airports and seaports, procuring essential medical supplies and \nequipment. The framework also provides for separate plans for vulnerable populations through decentralized \nclinical services.  \n5. Debt sustainability  Although the FSM\u2019s public debt stock is relatively low, equivalent to 20.2% of GDP as of FY2019, the IMF rates \nthe country\u2019s risk of debt distress as \u201chigh\u201d in view of a reduction in revenues after FY2023 (Figure 4). Debt \nsustainability analysis by ADB and the IMF (through a June 2020 assessment letter) maintains the high risk of debt \ndistress rating but concludes that the FSM\u2019s public debt remains sustainable. The COVID-19 crisis is projected to \nreverse the fiscal position to a deficit at least in FY2020, but the impact on debt is expected to be moderate if \nfinancing needs continue to be financed by grant assistance from the FSM\u2019s development partners. The IMF \nrecommends the development of a comprehensive fiscal adjustment strategy that accounts for the potential near-\nterm impacts of the pandemic, the medium-term implications of the fiscal cliff, and the long-term impacts of \ndisasters to safeguard debt sustainability. Tax and tax administration reforms, along with steady improvements in \npublic financial management, will be crucial elements of such a fiscal adjustment strategy.  \n6. IMF Coordination  ADB has been closely coordinating with the IMF and has built strong relationships through active participation \nduring Article IV missions and staff visits to FSM. In an Assessment Letter (dated 25 June 2020), the IMF \nexpressed its support for the proposed CPRO and expressed agreement with ADB\u2019s views on: (i) FSM\u2019s pre-shock \nrecord of generally sound macroeconomic management, as reflected primarily by the achievement of annual fiscal \nsurpluses over a sustained period; and (ii) public debt remains sustainable, though the risk of debt distress is high \nmainly due to uncertainties pertaining to the renewal of the economic provisions of the Compact Agreement with \nthe US (currently under negotiations) expiring in 2023.  \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, CPRO = COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option, FSM = Federated States of Micronesia, FY = \nfiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International Monetary Fund, US = United States. \na  ADB estimates; Graduate School USA Pacific Islands Training Initiative. 2020.
