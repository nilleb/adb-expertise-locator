It will involve upgrading \nmajor district roads to intermediate lane-width of 5.5 m, or two lane-width of 7 m, depending on \ntraffic requirements, including reconstruction, widening and strengthening culverts and bridges, \nand maintaining the improved road assets for a period of five years after construction.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nMadhya  Pradesh  is  the  second  largest  state  in  India,  with  an  area  of  about \n308,000 square km. It is among the poorer states in the country, with per capita income about \n60% of the national average. However, the gross state domestic product grew at a compound \nannual  growth  rate  of  8.8%  during  2005\u20132013,  fostered  through  a  series  of  development \nmeasures. 4  These  include  developments  on  the  Delhi\u2013Mumbai  Industrial  Corridor  passing \nthrough Madhya Pradesh, 229 notified industrial areas, 19 growth centers, four notified special \neconomic  zones,  and  12  product-specific  industrial  parks.  With  a  population  of  about \n72.6 million, agriculture is the mainstay of the state\u2019s economy and about 73% of the people live \nin  rural  areas.  The  dispersed  nature  of  industrial  development  and  agricultural  production \nmeans that the road network is a critical element of the economic infrastructure.  \n \n4. \nThe  state  has  a  road  network  of  about  127,000  km\u20144,700  km  national  highways, \n11,000 km  state  highways,  and  20,000  km  MDRs.  Rural  roads  make  up  the  balance.  The \nnumber  of  registered  vehicles  has  increased  by  about  10%  per  year,  from  about  3  million  in \n2001  to  about  8  million  in  2011.  Madhya  Pradesh  Road  Development  Corporation  (MPRDC) \nprojects vehicular growth of more than 7% per year over 2011\u20132021.5 Average daily traffic has \nalso increased. More traffic will need greater road capacity to maintain service levels and better \nmaintenance. MPRDC estimates that more than $1.2 billion will be required over 2013\u20132023 to \nmeet investment requirements in the state road sector.6 \n  \n5. \nThe  state  is  close  to  completing  the  upgrade  of  the  state  highway  network  with  a \ncombination  of  budgetary  allocations,  previous  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  support,  and \npublic\u2013private  partnerships.  However,  MDRs  have  received  marginal  attention,  and  major \nportions  still  need  to  be  upgraded.  The  state  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  has  now \ncommenced improvement of MDRs as a critical part of the state road network, as proposed in \nTable 1. Even after the proposed assistance from ADB, a significant length of MDRs will need to \nbe  improved,  for  which  the  government  of  India  is  exploring  budgetary  and  bilateral  agency \nfinancing. \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for TA 8598 IND: Preparing \n\nMadhya Pradesh District Connectivity Sector Project. \n\n4   Government  of  Madhya  Pradesh,  Department  of  Economics  and  Statistics.  2013.

Across the country, various programs \nhave  been  undertaken  to  develop  national  highways,  state  roads,  and  rural  roads.  However, \ndistrict  roads,  which  form  20%\u201330%  of  the  road  network,  have  not  had  such  a  planned \napproach. For ADB, this will be an opportunity to initiate a planned approach for district roads, \nand will be ADB\u2019s first loan for district roads in the country. Developing this network will foster \ninclusiveness  by  enabling  larger  segments  of  the  state\u2019s  population  to  better  access  markets \nand  basic  services. The project  is consistent  with  the  strategic  objective  set  out  in the  country \npartnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 on development of the state road network focusing on lagging \nstates;  and  the  transport  sector  objective  of  increased,  more  efficient,  and  sustainable \nmovement of people and goods.9 The project is not included in the country operations business \nplan,  2013\u20132015. 10  However,  the  Department  of  Economic  Affairs  has  requested  ADB \nassistance for the project. \n \n7. \nModality. The project is prepared as a sector loan, which is well suited for the financial \nassistance  because  (i)  the  project  pertains  to  a  number  of  MDRs  distributed  across  the  state; \n(ii) the  state  has  a  sector  development  plan  in  place  (Development  Plan  for  State  Roads  in \nMadhya  Pradesh,  2013\u20132033);  and  (iii)  the  state  has  the  institutional  capacity  to  prepare  and \nimplement the sector plan and to prepare the individual road packages. MPRDC, set up under \nADB technical assistance (TA), is crucial to this capacity.11 MPRDC  was incorporated in 2004, \nand  designated  a  highway  authority  under  the  state\u2019s  highway  legislation  to  develop  state \nhighways,  MDRs,  and  other  infrastructure. 12 The  chief  minister  of  Madhya  Pradesh  is  chair  of \nthe  board  of  MPRDC,  and  the  minister  for  Madhya  Pradesh  Public  Works  Department \n(MPPWD) and the chief secretary of the state are vice\u2013chairs. MPRDC has developed a strong \n                                                \n7   ADB. 2002.

MPRDC  has  substantive \nexperience from prior ADB loans in project design and implementation.  \n \n8. \nSample  roads.  Under  the  sector  lending  modality, four  sample  subprojects  have  been \nprepared:  (i)  Chitrangi\u2013Kasar  road,  (ii)  Dabra\u2013Bhitarwar\u2013Harsi  road,  (iii)  Mahua\u2013Chuawahi \nroad, and (iv) Ujjain\u2013Maksi road. These sample roads aggregate to about 188 km, about 11% of \nproposed  road  length  under  the  project,  for  which  the  project  cost  is  assessed  as  about \n$77 million.  The  non-sample  roads  will  be  selected  and  approved  in  line  with  the  criteria  and \nprocess outlined in the project administration manual (PAM).13 \n \n9. \nSustainable  maintenance.  To  ensure  better  construction  quality  and  better \nmaintenance  of  the  road  assets  after  construction,  the  project  will  include  a  5-year, \nperformance-based  maintenance  period  adjunct  to  the  construction  contract.  This  will  transfer \nsome  construction  quality  risk  and  maintenance  risk  to  the  private  sector,  and  provide  better \nvalue for money to the users. While this is being done on national and state highway projects in \nthe country, this project is among the first system-wide attempt for MDRs in a state. \n \n10. \nRoad  safety  and  accident  response.  Previous  ADB  loans  have  supported  MPRDC\u2019s \nefforts  to  improve  road  safety  and  design  an  accident  response  system.  MPRDC  is \nimplementing  a  geographical  information-based,  information  technology-enabled  accident \nresponse  system  in  the  state.  To  make  the  system  amenable  to  the  first-response  financial \nneeds  of  accident  victims,  MPRDC  is  also  proposing  to  link  insurance  funds  to  the  accident \nresponse  system;  this  linkage  will  be  the  first  such  initiative  in  the  country.  MDRs  improved \nunder this project will also be covered by the accident response and insurance fund structure. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  improved  road  transport  connectivity  in  the  state  of \nMadhya  Pradesh.  The  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  improved  road  transport  efficiency  in \nMadhya Pradesh. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nThe  project  outputs  will  be  (i)  MDRs  reconstructed  and  rehabilitated  to  all-weather \nstandards  and  designed  for  road  safety;  and  (ii)  improved  road  maintenance  and  asset \nmanagement.  About  1,600  km  of  MDRs  will  be  reconstructed  and  rehabilitated  to  an \nintermediate lane width of 5.5 m, or two-lane width of 7.0 m, depending on traffic requirements. \nContracts  will  include  5-year  performance-based  maintenance  obligations.  MDRs  under  the \nproject will be integrated into the accident response system being developed by MPRDC. \n \nD. \n \n13. \nfinancier and by year are included in the PAM.  \n \n \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $500  million  (Table  2).

Interest  during  construction  for  the  ADB  loan(s)  is  computed  at  the \n5-year forward London interbank offered rate plus a spread of 0.5% and maturity premium of 0.10%. Commitment \ncharges for an ADB loan are 0.15% per year on the undisbursed loan amount.  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n14. \nThe  government  of  India  has  requested  a  loan  of  $350,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital  resources  to  help  finance  the  project.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a \ngrace  period  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest rate determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. The \ngovernment  of  India  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. The government of India has requested that repayment \nfollow the equal repayment option. Based on the above loan terms and repayment option, the \naverage  loan  maturity  is  15.25  years  and  the  maturity  premium  payable  to  ADB  is  0.10%  per \nannum. \n \n15. \nThe financing plan is in Table 3. The ADB loan will finance 70% of the project cost. This \nis considered acceptable, taking into account that the state government of Madhya Pradesh has \nallocated  counterpart  financing  for  30%  of  the  cost.  By  including  more  roads  in  the  loan,  the \nbenefits will be spread into more areas of the state. \n \n\nTable 3: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n     Ordinary capital resources (loan) \nGovernment (state government of Madhya Pradesh) \n\nTotal \n\nAmount ($ million) \n \n350 \n150 \n500 \n\nShare of Total (%) \n \n 70 \n 30 \n100 \n\nSources: Government of Madhya Pradesh and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n16. \nThe  executing  agency  for  the  project  will  be  the  state  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh \nacting  through  MPRDC.  MPRDC  will  implement  the  project  through  its  field  offices  at  key \nlocations,  which  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  project  implementation  and  management, \nand  will  assign  staff  to  work  on  the  project.  One  or  two  full-time  project  managers  will  be \nassigned for each contract package. The project managers will be delegated adequate technical \nand  administrative  authority  for  expeditious  project  implementation.  MPRDC  will  engage \n\n4 \n\n \nE. \n\n \n\n\fconstruction  supervision  consultants  as  the  engineers  for  the  construction  contracts.  All \nprocurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). All consultants will be recruited according to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \n \n17. \nthe PAM.  \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Executing agency \n(ii)   Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \nDisbursement \n\nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \nNovember 2014\u2013April 2018 \n30 April 2018 \n\nGovernment of Madhya Pradesh, acting through MPRDC \n10  project  implementation  units  of  MPRDC  at  Bhopal,  Gwalior  (2),  Indore  (2), \nJabalpur,  Rewa  (2),  Sagar,  and  Ujjain.

During  project \n18. \npreparation, MPRDC\u2019s procurement activities for the sample roads were well advanced. Based \non this, the government of India requested retroactive financing for all project components. Up \nto 20% of the loan proceeds will be eligible for retroactive financing, provided that expenditures \nare  incurred  on  works,  equipment,  and  consulting  services  for  the  project  in  accordance  with \nagreed  procedures  and  during  the  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  loan  agreement.  The \ngovernment of India and MPRDC have been informed that approval of advance contracting and \nretroactive financing does not in any way commit ADB to finance the project. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n19. \nThe  project  was  prepared  with  the  enhanced  capacity  of  MPRDC,  gained  through  the \nthree previous ADB loans and TA provided for capacity building. MPRDC engaged consultants \nwith its own funds to prepare detailed design documents for roads proposed for ADB financing, \nincorporating  ADB  requirements  of  economic,  social,  and  environmental  studies  into  the \nconsultants\u2019 terms of reference. ADB engaged a consultant firm under project preparatory TA to \nconduct  due  diligence  to  ensure  the  consultants\u2019  work  complies  with  ADB  requirements.  The \nengineering  design  was  prepared  to  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  as  well  as  social  and \nenvironmental  impacts,  take  road  safety  into  account,  and  minimize  climate  change  risks.  In \naddition, advance actions have been taken to ensure the construction can commence early. All \nof these measures have improved project readiness and will mitigate the risk of delay. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n20. \nThe economic evaluation of the project followed the standard practice of comparing life \ncycle road and user costs with and without the project, using the net present value with a 12% \ndiscount  rate  and  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  as  decision  criteria.  The  highway \ndevelopment  and  management  system  was  used  in  the  analysis,  which  focused  on  transport \ncost  savings.  Value  added  from  better  transport  links,  resulting  in  new  industries  and \nemployment, are captured through benefits from generated traffic. \n     \n21. \nThe EIRR for the sample roads evaluated is 15.6% for the Chitrangi\u2013Kasar Road, 17.6% \nfor the Mahua\u2013Chuwahi Road, 23.0% for the Dabra\u2013Bhitarwar\u2013Harsi Road, and 21.9% for the \nUjjain\u2013Maksi Road. Overall, sample roads have an EIRR that satisfies the economic efficiency \ncriteria. The  sensitivity  of the  EIRR for the  sample  project  roads  was  analyzed  with  respect  to \nchanges  in  the  benefit  and  cost  streams.  The  following  sensitivity  cases  were  examined: \n(i) construction  costs  increased  by  10%,  (ii)  vehicle  operating  cost  and  travel  time  savings \nreduced by 10%, (iii) construction cost increased by 10% and vehicle operating cost and travel \ntime  savings  reduced  by  10%,  and  (iv)  a  1-year  delay  in  project  commencement.  The  results \nshow the quantified economic benefits are robust to various sensitivity tests. All selected roads \nhave an EIRR above 12% in all sensitivity tests. \n \nFinancial  sustainability.  Incremental  recurrent  costs  associated  with  the  project  are \n22. \nestimated to be 0.80% of the current maintenance budget of MPRDC and 0.03% of the overall \nMPPWD  maintenance  budget  on  an  annual  basis.  The  allocation  for  the  annual  average  road \nmaintenance  budget  for  2010\u20132013  was  Rs179  million  for  MPRDC  and  Rs4,113  million  for \nMPPWD. It is reasonable to expect that funds will be available to meet the maintenance costs. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nInstitutional capacity. The executing agency, MPRDC, was incorporated in 2004 under \n23. \nthe  Companies  Act,  1956,  and  is  an  entity  wholly  owned  by  the  state  government  of  Madhya \nPradesh.  MPRDC\u2019s  board  includes  the  highest  levels  of  political  and  administrative  officers  in \nthe  state.  It  has  10  divisional  offices  across  the  state.  MPRDC  has  been  the  implementing \nagency  for  three  prior  ADB  loans  and  is  familiar  with  ADB  procedures.  It  also  manages  many \npublic\u2013private partnership projects and has strong institutional capacity.   \n  \n24. \nFinancial  management.  An  assessment  of  MPRDC\u2019s  accounting  systems,  financial \nreporting, and external audit procedures concluded that the capacity of MPRDC is adequate in \nproject  financial  accounting  and  in  ADB  disbursement  procedures  due  to  significant  prior \nexperience  with  ADB-funded  projects.  MPRDC  follows  double-entry  accrual-based  accounting \nand prepares financial statements in accordance with Indian accounting standards. MPRDC will \nmaintain separate project accounts and records by funding source for all expenditures incurred \non the project. Project accounts will follow accounting principles and practices prescribed by the  \naccounting  laws  and  regulations  of  the  government  of  India.  Internal  audit  is  carried  out  by  a \nfirm  of  chartered  accountants  appointed  by  MPRDC.  External  audit  is  conducted  by \nindependent  auditors  from  the  panel  of  auditors  appointed  by  the  comptroller  and  auditor \ngeneral in accordance with auditing standards issued by the government of India. \n \n25. \nProcurement.  MPRDC  has  extensive  experience  of  procurement  and  consultant \nrecruitment  for  ADB  projects,  as  well  as  use  of various  forms  of  public\u2013private  partnership  for \nroad projects. Goods and works will be procured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \nAll civil works will be procured through international competitive bidding. All consulting firms will \n\n \n\n\fbe recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants using quality- and \ncost-based  selection,  with  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20.  MPRDC  has  prepared  the  bid \ndocuments and commenced procurement for the first four works contracts and for recruitment of \nthe supervision consultants for the project as part of advance action. The procurement plan for \nthe project is in the PAM. \n \n26. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  of  India  and  MPRDC.  The  specific  policy  requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n27.  Madhya  Pradesh  encompasses  an  area  of  about  308,000  square  kilometers\u2014the \nsecond  largest  state  in  India.  It  is  one  of  the  less  developed  states  in  India,  with  a  human \ndevelopment  index  of  0.375  in  2011,  which  is  well  below  the  national  average.14 Agriculture  is \nthe  main  sector  in  the  local  economy.  A  social  impact  assessment  found  that  the  poor  road \nconditions  were  preventing  safe  and  reliable  travel,  especially  during  the  rainy  season. \nImproved  roads  will  increase  new  economic  and  employment  opportunities  by  improving \nlinkages  to  commercial  facilities.  Rural  communities  will  benefit  by  having  faster  and  more \nreliable transport of their produce to markets and by receiving higher profit margins. Access to \npublic and social service facilities (such as government agencies, health centers, and schools) \nwill  also  be  improved.  Project  beneficiaries  include  local  residents,  road  users,  businesses, \ncommercial services, and government workers. The project roads cover 29 districts in the state. \nAbout  48  million  residents  live  in  the  project  districts.  Provisions  are  in the  bidding  documents \nfor the civil works contracts to comply with core labor standards.15  \n \n28. \nGender.  The  gender  indicators  for  Madhya  Pradesh  are  low  at  930  females  per \n1,000 males. The state has a lower sex ratio than the national average of 940, which is low in \ninternational  comparison.15  During  the  social  study,  17  women-only  focus  group  discussions \nwere  held.  The  discussions  revealed  that  women  are  not  actively  engaged  in  family  and \ncommunity  decision-making  processes.  Women  indicated  that  poor  road  conditions  were \npreventing safe and reliable travel. Improved road conditions are expected to provide (i) better \naccess  to  health  services,  higher  levels  of  education,  and  social  interactions;  and  (ii) better \npublic and private transport options. Gender-sensitive features include (i) integrating road safety \nfeatures for the elderly, women, children, and people with disabilities into road design such as \nproper  signage,  marked  crossings,  and  pedestrian  paths  at  appropriate  locations;  (ii)  giving \npreference to employing local women and vulnerable groups for road maintenance during the 5-\nyear maintenance period, and ensuring that provisions for equal wages for equal work done by \nboth male and female skilled and unskilled labor in project works are in the bidding documents; \n(iii) providing  training  to  all  staff  employed  in  routine  road  maintenance,  which  will  generate \nabout  146  person-years  of  employment;  (iv)  appointing  a  social  and  gender  focal  person  at \nMPRDC  and  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  level;  and  (v)  building  the  capacity  of  MPRDC \nstaff on gender-inclusive design and mainstreaming gender in project preparation, consultation, \nroad construction, and maintenance. \n \n\n                                                \n14 Government of India, Planning Commission. 2011. India Human Development Report (Towards Social Inclusion). \n\nDelhi. \n\n15 Government of India. 2011. Census 2011. Delhi. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fHIV/AIDS.  The  adult  HIV  prevalence  in  India  is  0.27%  as  of  2011.  New  infections \n29. \ndeclined 57% from 2000 to 2011, and AIDS-related deaths dropped 29% from 2007 to 2011.16 \nAccording to India\u2019s National AIDS Control Organisation, HIV infection is typically concentrated \namong the poor and marginalized groups (including such high-risk groups as sex workers, drug \nusers,  migrant  laborers,  and  truck  drivers).  Madhya  Pradesh  is  a  low-prevalence  state.  Based \non  the  poverty  and  social  assessment,  the  project  will  not  increase  HIV/AIDS  incidence  as  all \nimproved  roads  will  be  along  the  existing  corridor.  Contractors  will  carry  out  HIV/AIDS \nawareness for laborers at work sites, monitored by the construction supervision consultants.  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n30. \nInvoluntary  resettlement. The  project  is  categorized  B  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009). The  project  was  developed  with  a  view  to  avoid  land  acquisition  and \ninvoluntary  resettlement  by  adopting  the  most  feasible  technical  design.  The  proposed \nimprovement  of  roads  will  occur  within  the  existing  right-of-way.  For  sample  subprojects, \nmeaningful  consultation  and  information  disclosure  were  undertaken  during  preparation.  No \nland  acquisition  is  envisaged,  but  34  roadside  vendors  will  experience  temporary  disruption to \ntheir  livelihoods  during  construction.  A  due  diligence  report  has  been  prepared  for  the  sample \nsubprojects.  The  sample  subprojects  are  representative  of  the  kinds  of  impact  likely  to  be \nencountered  in  non-sample  roads.  For  the  sector  project,  a  resettlement  framework  has  been \nprepared  in  accordance  with  the  acts  and  policies  of  the  government  if  India,  and  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  framework  will  guide  the  screening  and  planning  for  all \nsubsequent  subprojects  that  have  resettlement  impacts.  Displaced  persons,  if  any,  will  be \ncompensated  at  replacement  cost;  and  rates  for  different  categories  of  loss  and  special \nassistance  are  detailed  in  the  framework.  If  any  changes  or  additional  land  requirements  or \ninvoluntary  resettlement  impacts  are  identified  during  implementation,  a  resettlement  plan  will \nbe prepared or updated. ADB\u2019s prior approval will be obtained before further implementation of \nthe relevant section of the subproject. MPRDC is experienced in implementing ADB projects. At \nthe MPRDC level, two dedicated staff will oversee the project; and at the implementation level, \neach of the 10 PIUs of MPRDC will have a social safeguard focal person. \n \n31. \nIndigenous  people. The project is categorized C in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.  Madhya  Pradesh  has  a  significant  tribal  population,  which  constitutes  more \nthan  one-fifth  of  its  total  population.  The  state  is  home  to  46  \u201cscheduled  tribes.\u201d17 The  tribal \npopulation  is  largely  concentrated  in  and  around  the  forest  area.  All  project  roads  will  be \nimproved  within  the  existing  alignment  and  no  greenfield  construction  will  take  place.  The \npoverty and social assessment survey confirmed that the socioeconomic impacts will not differ \nbetween  tribal  groups  and  non-tribal  groups.  Subprojects  with  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples \nwill  not  be  financed.  An  indigenous  peoples  planning  framework  has  been  prepared  to  guide \nscreening of the impact of non-sample subprojects.  \n \n32. \nEnvironmental  impact.  The  scope  of  works  under  the  sample  subprojects  involves \nimprovement and maintenance of existing MDRs. Adequate right-of-way is available for all the \nsample  subprojects  and  no  significant,  long-term,  or  irreversible  environmental  impacts  are \nexpected.  Therefore,  the  sample  subprojects  have  been  categorized  B  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Initial  environmental  examination  reports  have  been \nprepared  for  each  of  the  four  sample  subprojects  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \n\n                                                \n16 Government  of  India,  Ministry  of  Health  and  Family  Welfare.  2011.

Delhi. \n\n17 Tribes or tribal communities recognized under the Constitution of India through applicable legislation. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fStatement, and will be disclosed on the ADB website. An environmental assessment and review \nframework  has  been  prepared  to  guide  compliance  with  environment  safeguard  requirements \nunder  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forests  of  the  Government  of  India  as  well  as  the \nSafeguard Policy Statement for the non-sample subprojects, and will be disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite.  According  to  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework,  no  category  A \nsubprojects  will  be  included  under  the  project.  Anticipated  environmental  impacts  under  the \nsample  subprojects  during  construction  entail  typical  road  construction-related  issues  such  as \ngeneration  of  dust,  noise,  exhaust,  waste  from  construction  and  worker  camps,  water \ncontamination,  occupational  health  and  safety,  erosion,  and  siltation.  Potential  operational \nimpacts such as noise, pollution, and safety issues caused by increased traffic are expected to \nbe  insignificant.  Mitigation  measures  to  address all  construction  and operation-related  impacts \nhave been included in the environmental management plan (EMP) prepared as part of the initial \nenvironmental examination. The EMP will form part of the bidding documents and be mandatory \nfor implementation by the contractor. Meaningful consultations have been conducted during the \nproject preparation stage, and all concerns of the affected persons and stakeholders have been \nincorporated in the initial environmental examination and EMP. A grievance redress mechanism \nhas  been  established  to  continue  receiving  feedback  and  complaints,  if  any,  from  affected \nparties and addressing them during the construction and operation stages. \n \n33.  MPRDC has implemented three ADB projects since 2002, so it is well versed with ADB \nsafeguard requirements. However, the environment and social cell within MPRDC has only one \ndedicated officer to manage both environment and social safeguards. Hence, the staffing of the \ncell  will  be  increased  by  one  additional  environment  safeguards  expert  and  two  social \nsafeguards  experts,  bringing  the  total  number  of  staff  to  four.  At  the  site  level,  the  respective \ndivisional office of MPRDC will be the PIU. The four sample subprojects will have a total of three \nPIUs.  Each  PIU  will  have  one  focal  person  for  managing  environment  and  social  safeguards. \nThe  environment  and  social  cell  at  MPRDC  and  safeguards  focal  person  at  the  PIU  will  be \nsupported  by  an  environmental  specialist  under  the  construction  supervision  consultant (CSC) \nfor regular monitoring and reporting on EMP implementation. An initial coordination-cum-training \nworkshop  will  be  carried  out  by  ADB  and  the  CSC  environmental  specialist  during  the  pre-\nconstruction  stage  for  MPRDC  staff,  other  CSC  staff,  and  the  contractors.  Further  training  will \nbe conducted during the construction stages as necessary. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.18 The assessment indicates that the overall \nrisk assessment considering the management measures is low, and the integrated benefits and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs.  \n \n\nTable 5: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nInitial delays in \nproject \nimplementation \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nMPRDC has prepared the detailed design for the four sample roads, and has \ncompleted safeguard related surveys and reviews. Detailed project reports (DPRs) for \nthe non-sample roads are also progressing well, and are expected to be completed by \nNovember 2014. For sample roads, consultant recruitment for construction supervision \nand procurement for works contracts has been initiated, and in progress. Procurement \nactions for non-sample roads will commence in November 2014. Project designs have \nbeen prepared to minimize land acquisition. However, because of the large number of \n\n                                                \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \n\nSustainability of \nroad \nmaintenance \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nnon-sample roads, the risk after mitigation is still medium. \nEngineers and construction supervision consultants will be engaged for quality checks \nin accordance with contracts. ADB will undertake frequent review missions to ensure \ntimely undertaking and quality of contracts. Ten project implementation units are \nenvisaged, distributed around the state near work sites. These units will be supported \nby three separate firms of construction supervision consultants. The introduction of 5-\nyear performance-based maintenance in works contracts will substantially increase \ncontractor accountability for construction quality. Despite these steps, quality control \nand checking will be an activity that is best addressed by field staff. The roads are \ndispersed geographically throughout this large state.
