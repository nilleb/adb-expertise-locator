Environmental  implications  of  the  proposed  policy  and \ninstitutional reforms were reviewed, and environmental interventions have \nbeen incorporated, as required. \n \nThe  Program  will  provide  for  the  development  of  a  strengthened \ngovernance  framework  for  the  oversight  of  public  enterprises  in  Tuvalu, \nimproved  capacity  for  oversight  on  the  part  of  the  Government,  the \ncapacity  to  respond  positively  to  such  oversight  on  the  part  of  public \ncorporations,  strengthened  capacity  to  manage  debt,  and  a  reduction  in \ngovernment debt to the National Bank of Tuvalu (NBT). \n \nTuvalu\u2019s economy is strongly dependent on external earnings, the level of \nwhich is determined by global economic forces. In recent years, external \nearnings  have  fallen,  placing  fiscal  pressure  on  the  Government,  and \nhighlighting  the  need  to  reduce  the  domestic  economy\u2019s  reliance  on  the \npublic sector as the driver of growth and instead create opportunities for \nprivate sector development to build insurance against volatility. \n \nThe  intended  impact  of  the  Program  will  be  sustained  economic  growth \nand  fiscal  stability  as  prioritized  in  Tuvalu\u2019s  national  plan  objectives. \nIndicators  of  success  will  be  the  Government\u2019s  performance  benchmark \nindicators. \n \nThe  outcome  of  the  Program  will  be  improved  government  capacity  for \nfiscal  planning  and  management.  The  policy  matrix  is  structured  around \nthree  outputs: \nimproved  public  debt  management  capacity, \n(ii) strengthened  oversight  of  public  enterprises,  and  (iii)  strengthened \nmanagement capacity in public enterprises. The outputs are designed to \ndirectly address the core of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) country \npartnership strategy, which focuses on effective fiscal management. The \nsalient features of the policy matrix include (i) passing of taxation reform \nlegislation;  (ii)  endorsement  of  a  public  enterprise  strategic  policy; \n(iii) development of a public corporations act and its tabling in Parliament; \n(iv)  repayment  of  the  outer  islands  agency  suspense  account  held  with \nNBT;  (v)  endorsement  of  a  debt  risk  management  and  mitigation  policy \nand strategy; (vi) analysis of private sector growth potential; (vii) adoption \nof  a  legal  framework  for  the  licensing  and  ongoing  supervision  and \nregulation of banking institutions; and (viii) NBT board-approved policies \nfor the timely collection of past due loans and advances of credit; and for \nmeasuring, monitoring, and maintaining adequate liquidity by NBT. \n\n(i) \n\n\f \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MFEP) \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nii \n\n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \nCounterpart \nFunds \n\n \nProgram Period \n\n \nProgram Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\nADB will support the Program by providing a grant of $3.24 million from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. Tuvalu is classified as country with high \nrisk  of  debt  distress  and  is  therefore  eligible  to  receive  100%  grant \nassistance. The grant will be provided in two tranches. The first tranche of \n$1.24  million  will  be  available  upon  satisfaction  of  the  first  tranche \nconditions and grant effectiveness, estimated at around December 2008. \nThe second tranche of $2 million will be available upon satisfaction of the \nsecond tranche conditions, estimated at around November 2009. \n \nCounterpart  funds  generated  from  the  grant  will  be  applied  to  the \nrepayment  of  the  Government\u2019s  estimated  A$3,795,610  overdraft  in  the \nouter  islands  agency  suspense  account  with  NBT,  with  any  remaining \nfunds to be directed toward other outstanding debt to NBT. \n \nThe  Program  is  from  1  November  2008  to  31  March  2010.  Policy, \nlegislative, organizational, and operational changes agreed upon with the \nGovernment and set out in the policy matrix are to be put in place from 1 \nNovember 2008 to 30 November 2009. \n \n\n \nMFEP will coordinate policy, legal, and regulatory actions and ensure that \nthe  reforms  as  agreed  to  by  the  Government  and  ADB  are  duly  carried \nout  on  time.  A  program  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  secretary  of \nMFEP and including representatives of the Office of the Attorney General \nand  MFEP\u2019s  budget  and  public  enterprise  oversight  areas,  will  be \nestablished to monitor and coordinate the Program and support technical \nassistance from ADB and other agencies. \n \nThe Program is anticipated to provide benefits to society in terms of fiscal \nstability, improvement in enterprise performance, and business and public \nconfidence. \n \nRisks are the continued political will required to implement a robust policy \nframework  for  enterprise  performance  improvement  and  support  for \nneeded institutional structures, and the ongoing availability of appropriate \ntechnical  capacity.  The  Government\u2019s  adoption  of  the  performance \nbenchmark  indicators  is  seen  as  a  statement  of  political  will  to  initiate \nchange in financial management, and the financial incentive provided by \nAustralia  and  New  Zealand  to  achieve  these  targets  will  also  support \ncontinued political will and allow for retention of capacity. \n \nThe  proceeds  of  the  program  grant  will  be  disbursed  against  a  broad \nrange of imports, subject to a negative list.  \n\n\f177  00'Eo\n\n150  00'Eo\n\nN o r t h     P a c i f i c     O c e a n\n\n170  00'Wo\n\nTUVALU\nIMPROVED FINANCIAL\nMANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nLakena Matagi\n\nNANUMEA\n\n20  00'No\n\nPhilippine\nSea\n\nREPUBLIC\nOF PALAU\n\n0o\n\nMARSHALL  ISLANDS\n\nPA C I F I C    R E G I O N\n\nI\n\nt\n\nn\ne\nr\nn\na\n\nt\ni\n\no\nn\na\n\nl\n \n \n\nD\na\ne\n\nt\n\nl\ni\n\nn\ne\n\nFEDERATED STATES OF\nMICRONESIA\n\nNAURU\n\nINDONESIA\n\nPAPUA\nNEW GUINEA\n\nSOLOMON\nISLANDS\n\nTUVALU\n\nKIRIBATI\n\nCOOK\nISLANDS\n\nSAMOA\n\nTONGA\n\nREPUBLIC\nOF THE\nFIJI\nISLANDS\n\nA U S T R A L I A\n\n150  00'Eo\n\nS o u t h     P a c i f i c     O c e a n\n\n170  00'Wo\n\n20  00'No\n\n0o\n\no\n20  00'S\n\n6  00'So\n\nNORTHERN    ISLANDS\n\n6  00'So\n\nC o r a l   S e a\n\nVANUATU\n\nNANUMAGA\n\nNIUTAO\n\no\n20  00'S\n\nS  O  U  T  H        P A C I F I C        O C E A N\n\nNUI\n\nFenuatapu\n\nN\n\nCENTRAL    ISLANDS\n\n179  00'Eo\n\nVAITUPU\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nKilometers\n\nNational Capital\n\nAirstrip\n\nRoad\n\nReef/Atoll\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nNUKUFETAU\n\nFuunaota\n\nFale\n\nLafaga\n\nMotulalo\n\nFualefeke\n\nTegako\n\nFuafatu\n\nFOGAFALE\nFUNAFUTI\n\nFunafala\n\n177  00'Eo\n\n179  00'Eo\n\nFualefeke\n\nMulitefala\n\nAmatuku\n\nTegako\n\nTepuka\n\nFualopa\n\n8  30'So\n\nFuafatu\n\nL   a   g   o   o   n\n\n8  30'So\n\nFOGAFALE\n\nFUNAFUTI\n\nFatato\n\nPapaelise\n\nFunamanu\n\nFUNAFUTI  ATOLL\n\nVasafua\n\nFuakea\n\nTefala\n\nTuamotu\n\nTegasu\n\nFalefatu\n\nMateika\n\nLua Motu\n\nFunafala\n\nAvalau\n\nTelele\n\nMotuloa\n\n179  00'Eo\n\nNUKULAELAE\n\nFagaua\n\nTumuiloto\n\nNiuoku\n\nSOUTHERN    ISLANDS\n\n10  00'So\n\n10  00'So\n\nNIULAKITA\n\n179  00'Eo\n\n08-4658 HR\n\n\f\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto  Tuvalu  for  the  Improved  Financial  Management  Program.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\n \nTuvalu  is  small  and  isolated.  It  has  a  land  area  of  only  26  square  kilometers  (km2) \n2. \ncovering nine coral atolls and reef islands spread across more than 900,000 km2 of the Pacific \nOcean.  Of  the  total  population  of  approximately  11,000  persons,  more  than  half  live  on  the \n2.8 km2 island of Fongafale in the Funafuti atoll. The small size and isolation lead to a high-cost \nenvironment  for  most  business  activities.  Productivity  is  impaired  by  capacity  constraints  that \narise  from  difficulties  faced  in  generating  appropriate  competencies  and  performance  and  in \nretaining highly skilled individuals.  \n \nTuvalu\u2019s future growth strategy is set out in its national plan, Te Kakeega II, which was \n3. \ndeveloped using an extensive consultative and participatory process.1 Eight strategic areas are \nprioritized  including  good  governance,  macroeconomic  growth  and  stability,  and  employment \nand  private  sector  development.  The  expected  outcomes  are  more  employment  opportunities, \nhigher  economic  growth,  better  health  care,  better  education,  better  basic  infrastructure,  and \ncontinued  social  stability.  In  May  2007,  the  Government  adopted  five  performance  benchmark \nindicators (PBIs) to track the achievement of the stated social sector outcomes through a focus \non improved financial management. These are discussed further in paras. 12\u201315. \n \n4. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  supports \nimplementation of Te Kakeega II.2 In the micro-sized economy of Tuvalu, poor decisions about \nexpenditure  allocation  have  significant  opportunity  costs.  For  this  reason,  effective  fiscal \nmanagement  will  make  the  greatest  contribution  to  meeting  government  priorities  and  is  the \nfocus of the CPS.  \n \n5. \nTuvalu\u2019s  economy  is  strongly  dependent  on  external  earnings,  which  are  around  twice \nthe  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  Sources  include  remittances  from  seafarers,  fishing \nlicenses,  the  .tv  domain  name,3  and  return  on  the  Tuvalu  Trust  Fund  (TTF)  and  Falekaupule \n(local island council) Trust Fund.4 The level of these earnings is determined by global economic \nforces,  and  in  recent  years  external  earnings  have  fallen,  placing  fiscal  pressure  on  the \nGovernment. The TTF is further discussed in Box 1. \n \n6. \nThe public sector contributes about 70% of GDP and has a direct crowding-out effect on \nthe  private  sector,  undertaking  jobs  that  could  be  done  by  private  business.  In  2005,  general \ngovernment employees formed 57% of formal sector employees, with the employees of public \nenterprises accounting for a further 12%. Public sector pay rates are above private sector rates, \nand  public  sector  productivity  is  low.  Agriculture  and  fishing  are  the  principal  private  sector \nactivities, but they provide less than 20% of GDP and about 40% of employment.  \n\n                                                 \n1   Government of Tuvalu. 2005.

Proposed  Loan  and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to Tuvalu for Island Development Program. Manila (approved on 13 July 1999 for $4 \nmillion). \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nIn 2002, GDP per capita was about $2,100.5 The Tuvalu economy grew at a real rate of \n7. \n7.3%  per  annum  from  1996  to  2002  on  the  back  of  an  expansion  in  public  construction  and \npublic  business  activities,  and  growth  in  the  civil  service  wage  bill.  The  external  conditions \nsupporting  high  public  expenditure  have  fallen  away  recently.  GDP  growth  in  2007  was \nestimated at 2%\u20133%, supported by an 18% increase in public spending. The TTF distribution to \nthe  budget  fell  by  16%,  and  .tv  domain  name  receipts  were  down  by  20%.  Overall  revenue \nlevels were sustained by a 34% rise in fishing license fees and a 14% rise in external grants. \nTuvalu is now being confronted by rising average annual inflation. Measured in the 2nd quarter \nof 2008, this had reached 4.6% per annum, and the quarterly rise was a substantial 11.4%.  \n \n\nBox 1: Tuvalu Trust Fund  \n\n \nThe  TTF  was  established  in  1987  through  a  multilateral  agreement  among  Tuvalu,  New  Zealand,  United  Kingdom \n(UK), and Australia. Its purpose is to contribute to the long-term financial viability of Tuvalu by providing an additional \nsource of revenue for the recurrent expenses of the Government of Tuvalu.  \n \nThe TTF was initially capitalized with A$27.1 million in contributions from UK (A$8.5 million), New Zealand (A$8.282 \nmillion), Australia (A$8 million), Tuvalu (A$1.6 million), Japan (A$0.695 million), and the Republic of Korea (A$0.031 \nmillion). The maintained value of the TTF grew to A$103.9 million as of March 2008. At about 2.5 times GDP, the TTF \nhas  contributed  roughly  11%  of  the  annual  government  budget  each  year  since  1990.  This  provides  an  important \ncushion for Tuvalu's highly variable external income. \n \nThe TTF is governed by a board of directors consisting of one representative each from Tuvalu (chair), Australia, and \nNew Zealand. The UK was initially represented on the board but withdrew following a review in 2003, as a part of a \nbrorader process in which UK withdrew from the Pacific region as a bilateral donor. A separate advisory committee \nconsisting  of  government  and  donor  representatives  provides  additional  advice  and  input  to  trustees\u2019  decision \nmaking. The advisory committee is more widely beneficial to Tuvalu through its reviews of the Government\u2019s budget \nand through provision of advice on macro- and microeconomic issues on a twice yearly basis. The TTF is subject to \nparliamentary  scrutiny.  Although  governance  of  the  TTF  is  multinational,  Tuvalu  has  significant  autonomy  over \ninvestment decisions and the use of fund proceeds.  \n \nTrust fund proceeds are invested primarily in Australia in a diversified portfolio of assets reflecting the requirements \nto (i) maintain  real  purchasing power  of the TTF, and (ii)  provide a regular stream of income to the Government of \nTuvalu. The TTF is managed by  professional fund managers, currently  based in Australia,  and is monitored by the \nfund  monitor  (consultant  actuaries  who  report  to  the  board  on  a  three-monthly  basis  concerning  investment \nperformance).  However, since the recent collapse in the major stock markets, the total value of the TTF has seen a \ndecline of about 20%. \n \nIn 1991, to provide a mechanism for holding distributions from the TTF until they were required to be drawndown into \nthe  budget,  the  Government  of  Tuvalu  established  a  second  fund,  the  Consolidated  Investment  Fund  (CIF),  into \nwhich  TTF  earnings  would  be  deposited.  The  CIF  greatly  benefits  planning  by  reducing  the  volatility  of  drawdowns \nand allowing the Government to continue making them during years when the primary trust fund earnings are zero or \nnegative. Unlike the primary trust fund, governance of the CIF falls entirely upon the Government of Tuvalu. The CIF \ncan  be  used  by  the  Government  as  it  sees  fit,  subject  to  parliamentary  appropriation.  The  CIF  also  serves  as  a \nrepository  for  other  intermittent  income.  Withdrawals  from  the  CIF  include  drawdowns  into  the  recurrent  budget  as \nwell  as  capital  reinvestments  that  are  back-transferred  into  the  primary  trust  fund.  Tuvalu  has  devised  a  unique, \nbinary structure, with a primary true trust fund operating alongside a secondary revolving fund. \n \nSources:  Graham,  B.  2005.

Vaiaku, Tuvalu.  \n \nIssues of political economy greatly affect the way Tuvalu\u2019s economy is performing. This \n8. \nwas clearly recognized during the public meetings held in preparing Te Kakeega II. This reality \nunderlies the priorities set out in that document. Tuvalu is an egalitarian society, which acts as a \ndisincentive to individual effort and achievement. Tuvalu\u2019s small size means that the population \n\n                                                 \n5   2002 is the latest year of GDP measurement. The lack of recent key economic statistics in Tuvalu results from a \nsmall statistics office with limited technical capacity and a decision to focus efforts on the consumer price index and \nsocial statistics. Tuvalu has relied on external experts to irregularly update economic statistics.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nis  bound  by  close  ties. Preserving  these  relationships is  prioritized,  and  any  form  of  conflict is \navoided, often at substantial cost. There is also an entrenched public perception of government \nas  the  provider  of  jobs  and  services.  The  expectations  with  regard  to  free  health  care  and  to \nheavily subsidized education and utility services are deeply entrenched but unsustainable.  \n \nThe private sector is affected by cultural constraints on trade in land. Access to land can \n9. \nbe  problematic,  and  land  cannot  be  used  as  collateral  when  seeking  finance.  Cultural  norms \npresume that when a Tuvaluan enters into business, profits will be shared, and there can also \nbe  difficulties  in  charging  kin  for  goods  and  services.  Such  factors  reduce  the  returns  and \nincentive for private sector activity. \n \n10. \nThe development challenges Tuvalu faces are addressed in Te Kakeega II, but a more \ntargeted approach dealing with identified priorities is required. Tuvalu requires enhanced public \nfinancial  management,  a  downsizing  of  the  public  sector,  and  improvements  in  the  business \nregulatory environment to provide a platform for private sector growth so as to build insurance \nagainst  volatility.  Innovative  policies  and  a  willingness  to  embrace  economic  and  structural \nreforms are needed to achieve economic and employment growth and to ensure that the outer \nislands receive a reasonable share of the benefits of development. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PUBLIC FINANCE SECTOR \n\n \nA. \n \n\nSector Description and Performance  \n\n1. \n\nFiscal Issues \n\n \nTuvalu\u2019s  public  financial  management  is  impacted  by  the  volatility  of  its  external \n11. \nearnings. The TTF and the Consolidated Investment Fund (CIF) have been designed to alleviate \nsome  of  the  uncertainty  this  volatility  creates.  The  degree  to  which  the  TTF  and  drawdowns \nfrom the CIF supplement the budget is dependent on the level of TTF returns and is constrained \nby the size of CIF drawdown (4% of TTF maintained value is a sustainable level). This situation \ndoes not guarantee that the resultant adjusted recurrent budget is in surplus or even balanced. \nIndeed,  in  2003  through  2005  and  again  in  2007,  adjusted  recurrent  budget  deficits  were \nrecorded.  Tuvalu  is  projecting  adjusted  recurrent  budget  deficits  for  2008  through  2011.  The \nglobal economic outlook indicates the likelihood that the TTF will not provide a return in the next \n2\u20133 years and with the projected recurrent deficits, the CIF reserves will be depleted by around \n2011.  In  accordance  with  the  projections  of  the  TTF  advisory  committee  that  reviews  the \nperformance  of  the  Fund  twice  yearly,  the  current  global  conditions,  the  recent  decline  in  the \nmajor  stock  markets,  particularly  in  Australia,  where  the  assets  of  the  TTF  are  predominatly \ninvested,  are  likely  to  affect  the  investment  returns  negatively  leaving  the  Fund  without \ndividends  in  the  next  2-3  years.  In  addition,  the  recent  hikes  in  the  food  and  fuel  prices  built \nfiscal  pressures  that  are  still  working  their  way  through  the  Pacific  economies,  including  in \nTuvalu,  with  the  projected  fiscal  deficits  in  Tuvalu  likely  to  result  in  a  total  drawdown  of  the \nbalance of about A$12 million currently available in the CIF by 2011.   \n \n12. \nRevenue  growth,  expenditure  control,  and  debt  reduction  all  have  an  important  role  to \nplay in lessening volatility. The Government is committed to a program of fiscal restraint. This is \nmost clearly demonstrated by its adoption of a set of five PBIs, which were developed jointly by \nthe Government, ADB, the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), and the \nNew Zealand Agency for International Development (NZAID). The PBIs track the achievement \nof  the  stated  social  sector  outcomes  through  a  focus  on  improved  financial  management  and \nfiscal  consolidation.  The  PBIs  are  updated  annually  as  required  in  consultation  with  aid \nagencies to reflect broader fiscal conditions and affordability. The PBIs are as follows: \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nBenchmark 1.1. The Government\u2019s recurrent expenditure each year should not \nexceed the total of its recurrent revenue plus a sustainable TTF distribution (CIF \ndrawdown).  \n\nBenchmark 1.2. The target minimum  value of funds retained in the CIF should \nbe not less than 16% of the maintained value of the TTF at the beginning of the \nTTF  year  so  as  to  ensure  that  a  sustainable  distribution  is  available  to  help \nfinance annual budgets.  \n\nBenchmark  1.3.  The  Government\u2019s  total  debt  liability  (both  domestic  and \nexternal) at any time should not exceed 60% of GDP, as specified in Te Kakeega \nII. \nBenchmark 2.1.6 In 2008, the Government will increase its budgeted nonsalary \nexpenditure on basic education by at least 5%. \n\nBenchmark  2.2.  In  2008,  the  Government  will  increase  its  budgeted  nonsalary \nexpenditure on primary and preventive health services by at least 5%. \n\nFigure 1:  Trends in Expenditure and Revenue \n\n60\n\n40\n\n50\n\n30\n\nA$million\n\nEstimates\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: Tuvalu Central Statistics Department, Government audited accounts and budget papers, various years. \n \n\nExpenditure and net lending\n\nBudget balance\n\n8\n0\n0\n2\n\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n7\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\n1\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\n9\n0\n0\n2\n\n3\n0\n0\n2\n\n4\n0\n0\n2\n\n6\n0\n0\n2\n\n9\n9\n9\n1\n\n0\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\n0\n0\n2\n\n2\n0\n0\n2\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n \n13. \nFiscal  performance  against  the  PBIs  is  monitored  by  the  Tuvalu  Trust  Fund  Advisory \nCommittee  (TTFAC),  which  ensures  impartiality,  and  watched  closely  by  the  Government  and \nby  international  aid  agencies.  Assessment  in  April  2008  by  TTFAC  against  the  2007  budget \noutturn found that the Government had met benchmarks 1.3, 2.1, and 2.2. Against benchmark \n1.1,  TTFAC  found  that  the  recurrent  budget,  when  added  to  the  grants\u2019  balance  outturn  for \n2007, was in deficit of A$2.06 million, which was then reduced to a A$1.04 million deficit after \n\n                                                 \n6  More specifically, benchmarks 2.1 and 2.2 set clear targets for a specific year (the 5% targets for 2008 being the \nfirst such annual targets) with the intent that these be reset annually in consultation with development partners. It is \nnotable  that  monitoring  of  Tuvalu\u2019s  performance  against  benchmark  2.1  (education)  against  the  2007  budget \noutturn  showed  that  the  proportion  of  the  education  budget  spent  on  primary  education  and  vocational  training \n(excluding salaries, allowances, and scholarships) had increased significantly to 15% (compared with 7% in 2006). \nFor  benchmark  2.2  (health)  the  proportion  of  the  health  budget  spent  on  primary  and  preventive  health  care \nincreased slightly in 2007 to 18%. The evolving nature of these last two PBIs allows appropriate and agreed upon \nadjustments to be made to the targets, which ensures that these continue to promote fiscally responsible actions \nsupportive of social sector objectives. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\ndeducting the Government\u2019s A$1.02 million contribution to the TTF. As such, the 2007 budget \noutturn did not meet benchmark 1.1. TTFAC stated that benchmark 1.1 was arguably the most \nimportant  one.  Box  1  provides  details  about  the  function  and  operation  of  the  CIF.  TTFAC \nfurther  noted  against  benchmark  1.2  that  there  was  a  marked  improvement  in  government \nefforts to achieve the targeted minimum balance.  \n \n14. \nBoth  AusAID  and  NZAID  are  already  supporting  activities  that  target  PBI  achievement \nthrough  their  country  programs.  AusAID  will  channel  at  least  50%  of  its  A$3  million  yearly \nprogram  allocation  for  Tuvalu  to  directly  support  the  PBIs  through  the  TTF.  Similarly,  NZAID \ncontributes  on  average  15%\u201320%  of  its  annual  allocation  of  around  $1.5  million  to  the  TTF \ntoward achievement of the PBIs. In addition to this support, the AusAID and NZAID programs \nprovide  a  10%  incentive  payment  of  their  respective  country  allocations  upon  achievement  of \nthe  PBIs,  which  will  be  directed  to  support  Tuvalu\u2019s  recurrent  budget.  This  approximately \nA$0.4 million  potential  incentive  payment  is  significant  and  may  add  as  much  as  3%  to  the \nannual budget.  \n \nIn  response  to  Tuvalu\u2019s  adoption  of  the  PBIs  in  mid-2007,  incentive  payments  were \n15. \nmade  to  Tuvalu  by  Australia  (A$200,000)  and  New  Zealand  (A$90,080).  Following  TTFAC\u2019s \nApril 2008 assessment that Tuvalu had met three of the five PBIs in 2007, prorated payments \nwere  made  to  Tuvalu  by  Australia  (A$100,000,  or  50%  of  the  funds  that  would  have  been \navailable if all PBIs had been met) and New Zealand (A$112,000, or 60%) in June 2008. \n \n16. \nIn  terms  of  supporting  revenue  growth,  ADB  has  been  assisting  the  Government  of \nTuvalu in the area of taxation reform. Currently, Tuvalu\u2019s tax system suffers from an extensive \narray of exemptions, deductions, and allowances that shift the incidence of taxation to particular \nsegments  of  the  community.  The  situation  affects  collection,  which  becomes  inequitable  and \ninefficient  to  administer.  Furthermore,  compliance  problems  exist,  and  the  Inland  Revenue \nDepartment  lacks  the  necessary  administrative  powers  or  appropriate  sanctions  to  deal  with \nnoncompliance. External pressure to improve the taxation system comes from the potential loss \nof revenue under the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement, which requires a commitment \nto  customs  tariff  reduction,  and  its  eventual  elimination,  among  parties.  Ratification  of  this \nagreement by Tuvalu is estimated to create a potential revenue loss on imports in the order of \nmore than 14% of current import duty by the time the agreement is fully implemented.7 Alternate \nrevenue sources need to be identified to replace these losses.  \n \n17. \nADB  technical  assistance  (TA)  has  supported  the  development  of  three  draft  laws  (an \nincome tax  act amendment, a customs act amendment,  and a consumption tax bill) that were \nreferred to Parliament in June 2008. This package of legal amendments is designed to reform \nand  update  the  tax  and  customs  systems  in  Tuvalu  so  as  to  provide  the  Government  with \nsufficient  revenues \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s  ratification  of  the  Pacific  Island  Countries  Trade  Agreement.  The  package  is \ndesigned to be fiscally neutral. The consumption tax bill will bring in a broad-based consumption \ntax  (or  value-added  tax)  to  counter  the  anticipated  loss  of  revenue  likely  to  arise  from  the \nsignature  by  Tuvalu  of  certain  international  agreements,  and  over  a  period  of  time  will  reduce \nTuvalu\u2019s  reliance  upon  trade  taxes.  The  proposed  changes  were  initially  recommended  in  a \nPacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) consultant\u2019s report in 2004, have been \nreviewed  and  updated  by  revenue  experts,  and  reflect  input  received  from  public  and  private \nsector representatives. \n \n\nthe  customs  duty  reductions  required  by \n\nto  compensate \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n7   Tuvalu\u2019s cabinet ratified the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement on 16 April 2008, and this became effective \n\non 16 May 2008.  \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n18. \n \n\nThe key amendments contained within the package are \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\nrevamping the income tax to create a fairer system with more progressive rates \nthat will be easier to administer for small businesses; \nintroducing a broad-based consumption tax; \nremoving the sales tax on imports; \neventually removing the room tax; \nremoving  the  requirement  for  the  Taxation  Office  to  assess  every  individual \nemployee\u2019s  tax  each  year,  with  the  tax  paid  by  employers  deemed  to  be  their \nfinal tax unless the taxpayer submits a tax return because he or she believes he \nor she is entitled to a refund; \nintroducing more effective enforcement provisions to enable the Taxation Office \nto  better  deal  with  persistent  noncompliers  rather  than  having  to  take  action \nthrough the courts; \nintroducing  a  \u201ccost\u2013insurance\u2013freight\u201d  basis  of  valuation  for  calculation  of \ncustoms duties; \nadopting  a  valuation  regime  for  imports  for  customs  duty  purposes  that  is \nconsistent with World Trade Organization requirements; and \nupdating  the  monetary  values  of  penalties  and  fines  that  apply  in  respect  of \ncustoms offenses. \n \n\n19. \nPublic enterprises have a significant impact on the budget and, more broadly, on fiscal \nposition. In 2005, about 13% of budgeted expenditure was allocated to funding the shortfall in \noperating  revenues  of  public  enterprises  and  the  business-like  units  of  ministries.  This \npercentage  is  considered  likely  to  have  risen.  In  addition  to  providing  operating  subsidies,  the \ncapital  of  almost  all  public  enterprises  is  provided  through  government  grants  that  often  are \nsupported by funding agencies. The Government has also guaranteed National Bank of Tuvalu \n(NBT) loans of A$1.35 million for corporations that have no capacity to repay these debts and is \nguaranteeing  further  loans  and  overdrafts  for  other  public  enterprises.  Extra-budgetary \nexpenditure  in  support  of  public  enterprises  is  considered  significant,  although  it  is  not  well \ntracked.  Thus,  focused  efforts  to  improve  public  enterprise  performance  can  be  expected  to \nprovide  a  measurable  budget  saving,  freeing  government  resources  for  priority  areas  and/or \ndecreasing the budget deficit. This would variously contribute to meeting PBIs 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, and \n2.2. \n \n20. \nPublic  debt  has  reached  significant  levels,  and  steps  to  reduce  this  debt  will  ease  the \nbudget  deficit.  They  would  also  directly  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  PBI  1.3.  The \nGovernment  has  given  a  practical indication  of  its  commitment  to  tackling  debt  and  promoting \nthe  commercial  operations  of  NBT  by  repaying  A$1.0  million  to  the  outer  islands  agency \nsuspense  account  (OIASA)  overdraft  in  May  2008.8  The  Government  had  an  OIASA  debt  of \nA$3.796 million as of 30 September 2008, with NBT. This is discussed further below; elimination \nof this debt would provide significant benefits to NBT and, more broadly, to the private sector. It \nwould  also,  at  least  partially,  put  in  place  necessary  conditions  for  consideration  of  alternate \nownership  options,  should  the  Government  decide  that  some  form  of  divestment  meets  its \nbroader development and other policy objectives.  \n\n                                                 \n8   NBT in 2004 appointed the Falekaupule (local council) treasurer as official agent for NBT to receive deposits and \nlend  money.  All  transactions  were  recorded  daily  and  sent  by  facsimile  to  NBT  in  Funafuti.  The  treasurer  was \nallowed  a  maximum  cash  holding,  and  any  excess  was  to  be  transported  back  to  NBT  and  deposited  into  the \nindividual accounts. It appears that the money was instead deposited into the Government\u2019s general account and \nNBT  instead  recorded  the  outstanding  amount  as  a  government  overdraft.  However,  the  Government  had \nstipulated  that  this  overdraft  would  be  non-interest  bearing,  but  with  an  overdraft  at  its  peak  of  around  A$5.024 \nmillion at the end of 2006, NBT has a foregone income of about A$500,000 per year. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nframework  (including  a  multiyear  budget \n\n21. \nTuvalu does not utilize a medium-term fiscal framework. Formulation of a medium-term \nto  guide  budgetary \nfiscal  policy \nperformance and to attain balanced budgets has been included in Te Kakeega II but has not yet \nbeen  realized.  Such  a  framework  would  enhance  the  ability  of  the  Government  to  better \nunderstand, plan for, and manage volatility in revenues and expenditure.  \n \n\nframework) \n\n2. \n\nPublic Enterprises \n\n \n22. \nindividual enabling legislation: \n \n\nThe Government of Tuvalu currently owns 11 public corporations, each operating under \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nthe  country\u2019s  compulsory \n\nNBT established as the sole commercial bank; \nthe  Development  Bank  of  Tuvalu  (DBT),  to  provide  concessional  finance  to \nbusiness; \nthe  Tuvalu  National  Provident  Fund  (TNPF), \nsuperannuation scheme; \nthe  National  Fishing  Corporation  of  Tuvalu  (NAFICOT),  to  develop  export  and \nlocal sales of fish by Tuvaluans; \nthe Tuvalu Electricity Corporation (TEC), to provide electrical power on all of the \nisland groups; it is illegal to compete with TEC; \nthe  Tuvalu  Telecommunications  Corporation  (TTC),  which  provides  phone, \nmobile phone, internet, and other telecommunications services on Funafuti and, \nto a lesser extent, on the outer islands; it is illegal to compete with TTC without \nits consent; \nthe Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute (TMTI), to train seafarers; \nthe  Tuvalu  Philatelic  Bureau,  to  produce  and  sell  stamps  for  mailing  and  for \ncollectors; \nthe Vaiaku Lagi Hotel (VLH), to run a hotel, restaurant, and bar on Funafuti;  \nthe  Copra  Trading  Corporation,  to  purchase  and  export  copra  produced \ndomestically; and \nthe  Tuvalu  Media  Corporation  (TMC),  to  operate  the  only  radio  station; \ncompetition is permitted but unlikely owing to the small size of the economy. 9 \n\n \n23. \nThe  Government  does  not  have  an  overall  policy  for  public  enterprises  that  clearly \ndefines  their  purposes  and  objectives,  sets  agreed  upon  levels  of  operation,  provides  the \nnecessary  funding  for  community  service  obligations,  and  sets  out  clear  accountability  for \noperational  and  financial  matters.  Instead,  enterprises  each  operate  under  their  individual \nenabling  legislation,  and  government  involvement  is  dispersed  across  a  number  of  ministries. \nThe Government had assumed that, once corporatized, the enterprises could be left to their own \ndevices and would operate profitably. This has not proved to be the case.  \n \n24. \nEnterprises  have  budgets,  but  most  do  not  have  business  plans.  Budgets  tend  to  be \nbased on a traditional government vote-type structure. That is, the budgets are presentations of \nline  item  expenditure  intent,  without  any  link  to  intended  outputs  or  outcomes.  The  lack  of \nbudgeting against plans is a major limitation in performance management. There generally are \nno targets by which to measure performance. Continuation of the current approach will lead to \ncorporations  becoming  insolvent  and  reliant  upon  growing  subsidies  and  guarantees  from  the \nGovernment. This is completely the antithesis of why the corporations were established. \n \n\n                                                 \n9   TMC was decorporatized in 2007 and is now part of the Ministry of Communications and Transport.  \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n25. \nThe Report of the Auditor General 2006 (released in June 2008) indicates a high level of \ndebt  across  all  enterprises,  and  that  several  of  the  enterprises  were  operating  on  overdraft, \nseveral  had  questionable  financial  viability,  and  most  did  not  prepare  their  own  accounts\u2013\u2013\nhence  the  actual  financial  situation  would  likely  not  be  known  until  the  enterprise  received  an \naudit report.10 Issues of profitability are facing many of the corporations:  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nNAFICOT,  TEC,  and  TTC  have  each  accumulated  losses  of  more  than \nA$1 million.  NAFICOT  has  faced  commercial  difficulties  since  its  inception,  and \nthe Government is now servicing a A$1.23 million loan secured by NAFICOT in \n2003 to purchase fishing vessels. A temporary suspension of the corporation was \nissued in February 2006.  \n \nThe  setting  of  tariffs  by  the  cabinet  at  a  level  below  cost  and  non-  or  partial \npayment  of  bills  by  the  Government  are  key  factors  behind  the  poor  financial \nperformance  of  TEC  and  TTC.  Debts  owed  by  the  Government  to  TTC  had \naccumulated  over  a  number  of  years,  and  in  2007  TTC  accepted  A$1.2  million \nfrom  the  Government  as  full  and  final  payment.  Payments  owed  to  TEC  by  the \nGovernment were estimated to stand at A$0.4 million in 2006, while a payment of \nA$0.1  million  toward  this  was  made  in  2007.  TTC  moved  to  a  prepaid  service \nsystem  in  2004  but  subsequently  moved  away  from  this  system.  TEC  is \nconsidering such a move although it has concerns about the high upfront capital \ncost.  \n \nTMTI  does  not  charge  trainees  for  its  services,  and  TMC  has  few  of  its  own \nrevenue  sources.  Both  TMTI  and  TMC  are  reliant  on  government  subsidies  to \nmeet day-to-day expenses.  \n \nThe Tuvalu Philatelic Bureau now only operates on a small scale and has limited \ncommercial value. \n \nVLH  has  been  unprofitable  over  a  considerable  period,  although  recently  there \nhave  been  adjustments  to  the  pricing  structure  and  staffing  that  may  engender \nimproved  financial  performance.  Service  quality  is  not  generally  considered \ncommensurate with tariffs. There have been periodic discussions of moving to a \nmanagement  contract  for  VLH.  However,  issues  of  preservation  of  jobs  and \ngovernment maintenance of the assets have proved problematic.   \n\n \n26. \nA number of government businesses are also embedded in individual ministries. These \nare  not  producing  the  financial  and  management  reports  needed  to  assess  their  revenue-\nearning potential. These additional businesses include the main port, stevedoring operations, a \ntravel  agency,  two  interisland  vessels,  housing,  repair  shops,  outer  islands  fisheries  centers, \nand an internet facility.  \n \n27. \nNBT, TNPF, and DBT can lend money, a responsibility that brings with it a wider set of \nconcerns in regard to corporate performance. Only NBT and TNPF are profitable. The lack of a \nfinancial institutions act in Tuvalu means that banking institutions (defined as those institutions \nthat  take  deposits\u2014in  the  case  of  Tuvalu  only  NBT)  are  unregulated  and  unsupervised.  The \nresults of this situation are presented below:  \n \n\n(i) \n\nNBT\u2019s  pretax  rate  of  return  on  assets  was  41%  in  2007  and  27%  in  2006.  The \nhigh  profits  are  indicative  of  market  share.  NBT\u2019s  profitability  had  previously \nattracted private sector investment interest, although this interest may have been \n\n                                                 \n10  Office of the Auditor General. 2008. Report of the Auditor General 2006. Funafuti.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nlessened  by  the  lack  of  banking  regulations  in  Tuvalu  together  with  current \nliquidity  issues.  A  recent  assessment  by  PFTAC  (July  2008)  notes  that,  while \ncapital  is  strong,  this  is  needed  to  support  NBT\u2019s  less  than  satisfactory  asset \nquality.11  Earnings  performance  is  considered  satisfactory,  although  it  appears \noverstated. Earnings potential is hindered by the large volume (about $5 million) \nof non-earning government assets, and this would need to be resolved ahead of \nany consideration of private interest involvement in NBT. Further, NBT\u2019s liquidity \nposition  is  exposed  because  of  the  Government\u2019s  and  public  enterprises\u2019  large \nand unexpected withdrawals. Liquidity problems are further and most significantly \ncompounded at present by the large interest-free OIASA overdraft with NBT. The \ngovernment overdraft is currently costing NBT in the order of at least A$190,000 \nannually  in  foregone  returns.  This  is  significant  in  comparison  with  estimated \nprofits in 2008 (using industry best practice measures for its calculation) of less \nthan A$400,000. Further analysis of NBT is provided in Appendix 2.  \n \nTNPF  holds  most  of  its  funds  offshore,  and  this  investment  strategy  has \nunderpinned  good  commercial  performance  over  time.  TNPF  has  entered  into \nlending operations, allowing members to borrow against their contributions. The \nimplications  of  this  for  performance,  and  sustained  operations  as  an  effective \nprovider  of  superannuation  benefits,  are  substantial  but  have  not  been  widely \ninvestigated. \n \nDBT  has  at  times  reported  a  profit  but  typically  operates  at  a  loss,  and  it  was \nrequired to write down more than A$1 million in bad debts in 2003.  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n28. \nThe problems faced by public enterprises with regard to operating profitably are not new; \nthey have plagued enterprises since corporatization. The Government has remained concerned \nbut  has  not  had  a  clear  vision  for  addressing  and  remedying  the  problems.  Te  Kakeega  II \nidentified a number of priorities to improve public enterprise management, all of which are still to \nbe implemented: \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nStrengthen management and staff. \nProduce annual reports and audited accounts in accordance with legislation, with \nboth available to the public. \n\n(iii)  Clearly define, cost out, and better target government subsidies. \n(iv)  Assess the viability of privatizing selected public enterprises. \n(v) \n\nImprove  the  selection  process  of  boards  of  directors  of  public  enterprises,  and \nbroaden membership. \n\n(vi)  Establish  clear  guidelines  on  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  ministers,  boards, \n\nand management of public enterprises.  \n\n \nEach of these issues is important. However, what is lacking is the substance that binds \n29. \nthe  individual  issues  into  a  clear  framework  and  provides  for  the  necessary  prioritization  and \nsequencing of activities in support of improved public enterprise governance and performance. \nThe establishment of the policy, planning, and legal frameworks to support government decision \nmaking  with  regard  to  corporations  is  a  priority  need.  The  intermittent  and  inconclusive \ndiscussions  regarding  various  ownership  and  management  options  for  NBT  and  VLH,  the \ncontinued  losses  by  NAFICOT,  and  the  lack  of  discussion  regarding  ownership  of  TTC  are \nsymptomatic  of  the  lack  of  an  overarching  approach  to  public  corporation  performance  and  to \nconsideration  of  the  role  of  the  public  sector  in  the  provision  of  goods  and  services. \nImplementation  of  specific  reforms  (including  ownership  and  management  arrangements)  to \n\n                                                 \n11  PFTAC. 2008.

Yet  the  Pacific  is  littered  with  more  stories  of  failure  than  success.  The  ADB-funded \nprogram  loans  in  the  Pacific  during  the  1990s  mostly  fell  short  of  intended  impacts.  Lessons \nfrom success or failure are inherent in both the technical designs of the reform programs as well \nas  the  frameworks  within  which  the  reforms  have  been  implemented.  Lessons  from  this \nexperience have been summarized by Saldanha and Knapman, as follows:12  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nInsufficient  attention  was  paid  to  the  need  for  political  commitment,  ownership, \nand participation in design and in implementation. \nDesign needs to more carefully consider sequencing, scoping, and phasing, and \nto be more pragmatic. \nA much longer-term perspective is needed. \nInputs, process, outputs, and impacts should be more carefully distinguished. \nTimeliness  can  be  key,  e.g.,  reforms  were  put  in  place  in  the  case  of  the  Cook \nIslands following a debt crisis. \nIsland cultures, traditions, and the political economy influence outcomes. \n(vi) \n(vii)  Other  lessons  relate  to  the  need  for  appropriate  staffing,  consultants,  and  staff \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nengagement in design and implementation. \n\n \nGovernment  willingness  and  commitment  to  implementation  have  also  often  not  been \n31. \nevident with sufficient robustness to sustain improvements after external assistance has ended. \nThe  reasons  for  nonsustainability  differ,  some  being  associated  with  the  social  and  political \nimplications of the activities. Other reasons are that there was no real depth of understanding of \neither the rationale or the application, such that the activities simply faded away.  \n \n32. \nA  further  lesson  is  the  benefits  to  implementation  and  sustainability  of  the  appropriate \nuse of consultative and participatory processes. For example, the program completion report on \nthe  fiscal  and  financial  reform  program  included  as  major  lessons  the  \u201cneed  for  prior, \ntransparent, and participatory assessment of the social and political feasibility and sustainability \nof  reforms;  \u2026  A  more  participatory  assessment  could,  of  course,  determine  that  no  reform \nprogram  is  feasible.\u201d13  The  inclusion  of  appropriate  outreach  activities  to  support  stakeholder \neducation and public awareness and to strengthen implementation has been successfully used \nin  the  ongoing  technical  assistance  for  capacity  building  for  taxation  reform.14  Indeed,  the \nGovernment  employed  extensive  consultation  and  participation  in  the  development  of  Te \nKakeega  II.  The  use  of  consultation  and  participation  methodology  in  the  TA  supporting  the \nproposed  Program  grant  will  be  essential  to  successful  program  implementation  and \nsustainability  of  impact.  The  lessons  of  Pacific  experience  provide  valuable  guidance  to  the \ndesign of a reform Program to address factors behind Tuvalu\u2019s weak fiscal performance. \n \nThe  Tuvalu  CPS  2008\u20132012  notes  a  number  of  lessons  from  the  relatively  limited \n33. \nnumber  of  ADB  loans  and  grants provided  to the  country (footnote  2).  It  is  recognized  that,  in \nthe  past,  development  partners\u2019  programs  have  been  spread  thinly  over  a  number  of  sectors \n                                                 \n12   Knapman B, and C.

Implementation  has  often  been  resource-intensive  for  all \npartners, and aid coordination was poor until recently. TA operations have not been well aligned \nwith the Government\u2019s priorities and have often created dependency. Although there has been \nongoing support for the TTF, little attention has been paid to fiscal management. As a result, TA \nassistance to Tuvalu has not produced sustainable improvements in capacity and in operations, \nand  maintenance  costs  of  infrastructure  projects  have  rarely  been  met.  The  most  relevant \nlessons include (i) the need to integrate assistance within government frameworks and systems; \n(ii)  the  importance  of  focus;  (iii)  the  need  to  ensure  that  TA  operations  are  well  defined,  well \ndesigned,  and  well  managed  by  Tuvalu;  (iv)  the  importance  of  good  fiscal  management;  and, \nabove all (v) much better coordination and collaboration with development partners, starting with \nthe Government\u2019s full disclosure of planned and approved interventions. \n \nImport-dependent  Tuvalu  is  open  to  global  economic  forces  and  has  been  negatively \n34. \naffected  by  poor  global  market  performance  and  rising  fuel  and  food  prices.  The  current,  and \nexpected ongoing, budget deficit is creating an unsustainable fiscal situation. The deficits being \nexperienced have been increased by the lack of fiscal restraint in previous years, as a result of \nwhich recurrent financial commitments have been allowed to build up. The Government has not \ntaken a medium-term approach to budgeting and does not use a medium-term fiscal framework \n(MTFF),  which  would  assist  in  planning  and  reallocation  of  resources  against  priorities.  The \nGovernment must improve its capacity to control expenditure and generate revenue to address \nthe deficit. In many countries, the private sector makes a substantial contribution to government \nrevenue. However, in Tuvalu the opportunities for private sector growth are very limited. Current \nliquidity  problems  in  the  financial  system  further  reduce  incentives  for  private  business \ndevelopment.  \n \n35. \nThe Government of Tuvalu holds domestic and external debt, and in 2007 debt service \ncosts were estimated to amount to 7% of recurrent expenditure. The debt is a drain on limited \ngovernment  resources,  and  weak  monitoring  of  the  debt  is  indicative  that  the  drain  on  the \nbudget  will  continue.  While  the  external  debt  is  on  concessional  terms,  the  domestic  debt  is \nhaving a negative impact on the performance of NBT, which is the provider of funds. Several of \nthe domestic debtors (NAFICOT, TMC) are not making payments, which restricts the liquidity of \nNBT  and  reduces  its  return  on  assets.  This  reduces  NBT\u2019s  effectiveness  as  a  financier  to  the \nprivate sector. \n \n36. \nGovernment-owned public corporations place a further call on government expenditure. \nRising global commodity prices have necessitated increased subsidies to offset the rising cost \nof  all  imported  items  such  as  fuel  and  food.  Government  subsidies  (untied,  generally \nnonrepayable  and  non-interest  bearing)  to  public  enterprises  are  often  unplanned  and \nunbudgeted,  placing  a  further  burden  on  the  Government.  Nine  of  the  11  corporations  are \nalways loss incurring, with subsidies given to  enable them to continue operating. Tariff setting \nby  the  cabinet  at  a  level  below  cost  and  non-  or  partial  payment  of  bills  by  the  Government \ncontribute to the nonprofitability of several corporations. Some, like the Tuvalu Philatelic Bureau, \nTuvalu  Copra  Trading  Corporation,  and  NAFICOT,  have  not  submitted  financial  reports  for  a \nnumber of years, and therefore no audited accounts can be prepared.  \n \n37. \nThere  appears  to  be  no  clear  understanding,  by  the  Government  or  the  corporate \nentities  of  the  changes  in  roles  and  responsibilities  required  under  corporatization.  The \nexpectation  was  that  corporate  entities  would  become  profitable  simply  by  being  corporatized. \nTMC  has  recently  been  decorporatized,  although  the  legal  basis  for  so  doing  is  unclear.  The \nthinking  in  doing  this  was  that  providing  closer  government  control  would  address  financial \nperformance issues.  \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n38. \nDiscussion of potential privatization of enterprises has polarized enterprise staff and the \nGovernment,  and  has  confused  the  public  in  the  absence  of  information  on  options  or \nimplications.  A  private  sector  investor  expressed  interest  in  NBT,  but  discussions  were  not \nsuccessfully concluded. Similarly, there have been various expressions of interest in VLH, but \nno meaningful talks have taken place. These have all been instances wherein the private sector \nhas  approached  the  Government,  rather  than  being  a  response  to  government  action  to \nspecifically  seek  out  interest.  Thus,  while  it  cannot  be  definitively  said  that  the  previously \nconsidered changes would have improved service provision and reduced the demands on the \ngovernment  budget,  a  government  policy  position  on  public  corporation  ownership  and  a \nframework within which to consider options would have better placed the Government to make \ntransparent decisions in regard to the approaches received.  \n \n39. \nThe corporations are each governed under their own act of Incorporation, but there is no \noverarching  legislation  that  sets  out  the  requirements  of  a  corporation,  or  government \nresponsibilities with respect to the corporations. While corporations are allocated to ministerial \noversight,  no  formal  regulation  or  monitoring  occurs.  Corporations  generally  do  not  prepare \ncorporate plans and have few if any performance targets, and many neither prepare nor submit \nannual  reports.  While  most  have  boards,  board  members  say  they  have  never  had  a  clear \nstatement of their role or legal responsibilities, and even if they knew, in the absence of plans \nand  performance  targets,  their  capacity  to  assist  and  monitor  the  performance  of  the  general \nmanager is negligible.  \n \n40. \nPolitical  representation  on  boards  and  the  shortage  of  competent  directors  without \nconflicts  of  interest  are  further  problems.  All  public  corporations  are  chaired  by  a  government \nrepresentative  (Appendix  3),  which  creates  the  potential  for  political  pressure  to  be  placed  on \nboards and hence on public corporations. This risk is increased when directors, as a group, lack \nexpertise  in  areas  such  as  accounting,  human  resource  management,  and/or  the  technical \nfunctions undertaken by the public corporation.  \n \n41. \nStaff  skills  within  public  enterprises  are  generally  weak,  especially  in  planning  and \naccounting.  A  few  general  managers  are  considered  to  be  performing  very  well,  and  in  these \ninstances the performance of the corporation has improved. However, corporate performance is \ngenerally contingent on the willingness of the person to stay in the role. No succession planning \nis in place, and education scholarships do not appear to be tied to the commercial, professional, \nand technical requirements of the country.  \n \nThree  corporations  (NBT,  TNPF,  and  DBT)  are  able  to  lend  money,  while  NBT  also \n42. \ntakes  deposits.  However,  there  is  no  overarching  financial  sector  legislation  binding  NBT\u2019s \ndeposit-taking activities. This greatly increases the risk being faced by the corporatized entity as \nwell as by borrowers and depositors.  \n \n43. \n \n44. \n \n\nDetailed analysis of the problems and constraints identified is in Appendix 4.  \n\nThe following opportunities have been identified as priorities: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nimproved  debt  risk  management  planning  and  debt  repayment  by \nGovernment to NBT; \nputting in place a strong governance framework to guide government thinking on \nthe performance of corporations and public enterprises;  \nimproved corporation performance and oversight through improving the selection \nprocess  of  boards  and  broadening  board  membership,  as  well  as  establishing \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\f13\n\n \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nclear guidelines on the roles and responsibilities of ministers in relation to public \ncorporations;  \nprovision  of  the  legal  means  to  ensure  compliance  of  lending  institutions  with \ninternationally agreed upon standards;  \nexamination  of  the  level  of  subsidies,  and  means  by  which  these  are  currently \nbeing  provided  to  public  corporations  with  a  view  to  reducing  the  volume  of \nsubsidies and targeting these to cover the cost of providing for clearly identified \ncommunity service obligations;  \nreview of tariffs and tariff-setting practices;  \nan  MTFF,  already  committed  to  by  the  Government  through  Te  Kakeega  II,  \nwhich will enable Te Kakeega II requirements to be sequenced according to what \nis financially achievable and to identify the necessary groundwork for longer-term \nachievement  of  objectives,  thus  contributing  to  a  continuous  planning  and \nrevision process; and  \nfurther strengthening of development partner cooperation. \n\n(viii) \n \nThe  timing  is  good  to  address  these  opportunities.  Recent  actions  by  the  Government \n45. \nindicate  a  commitment  to  change.  For  example,  adoption  of  the  PBIs  provides  progress \nmeasures  and  incentives  for  more  thorough  planning  and  budgeting.  It  also  enables \ndevelopment partners to align their assistance to PBI achievements, thus reducing the likelihood \nof  a  fiscal  crisis.  The  Government\u2019s  demonstrated  commitment  to  reducing  its  debt  with  NBT \nthrough repayment of A$1 million in May 2008 is another indicator of its commitment to reform.  \n \n46. \nFurther,  tax  reforms  planned  for  introduction  in  mid-2009  will  improve  the  equity  of  tax \napplication  as  well  as  tax  revenue.  The  development  of  these  reforms  has  been  supported \nthrough ADB TA (footnote 14). \n \n47. \nADB\u2019s assistance has been designed to create understanding and commitment and will \nbe  supported  by  the  depth  of  skill  transfer  to  enable  sustainability  to  support  an  ongoing \nprogram of reform. In setting out the proposed Program below, consideration has been given to \nthe  lessons  of  past  policy-based  program  loans  in  the  Pacific  as  well  as  to  the  issues  and \nopportunities  presented  above.  These  have  been  used  to  formulate  actions  for  tranche \nconditions to provide for a practical demonstration of the Government\u2019s commitment to program \nimplementation.  Specifically,  tranche  conditions  have  been  carefully  sequenced  to  (i)  test  and \nsecure government commitment to improved fiscal and enterprise management; (ii) ensure that \nthe  Government  undertakes  some  of  the  technical  pre-Program  preparation  ahead  of  TA \nsupport, particularly with regard to a short review of private sector opportunities and successes; \nand  (iii)  ensure  that  the  Government  understands  the  implications  of  key  components  of  the \nProgram,  based  on  the  issues  above,  through  extensive  discussions  on  issues,  opportunities, \nand their implications before committing to the conditionalities.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n48. \nThe intended impact of the Program, as set out in the design and monitoring framework \n(Appendix 1) and to be supported by the Program grant and TA, is sustained economic growth \nand fiscal stability as prioritized in the objectives of Te Kakeega II. Indicators of success are the \nPBIs. The expected outcome is improved fiscal planning and management capacity.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\nB. \n \nThe proposed Program is structured around three outputs supporting (i) improved public \n49. \ndebt  management  capacity, \n(ii)  strengthened  oversight  of  public  enterprises,  and \n(iii) strengthened  management  capacity  in  public  enterprises.  The  outputs  are  designed  to \ndirectly  address  the  core  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership,  which  focuses  on  effective  fiscal \nmanagement. The Program will place under an integrated framework for effective government \ndecision  making  a  number  of  areas  where  the  Government  has  indicated  priority  issues  to  be \naddressed and has even initiated some actions. In this way, coordination and coherence among \nefforts to promote fiscal stability and improve public enterprise performance can be achieved. \n \n50. \nThe  Program  will  take  a  two-pronged  approach  by  focusing  at  the  macro  level  of \ngovernment  to  improve  public  debt  management  capacity  and  by  creating  the  policy  and \nlegislative  environment  for  improved  performance  of  all  public  enterprises.  The  Program  will \nsimultaneously require that all enterprises put in place management and planning tools that will \nbetter  enable  the  enterprises  to  understand  and  improve  their  performance  and  enable  the \nboards  of  directors  for  public  corporations  and  the  Government  to  monitor  performance  and \nintervene,  if  necessary.  The  Program  will  support  the  introduction  of  appropriate  corporate \nplanning, budgeting, and financial forecasting and improved management skills and systems for \nenterprises;  and,  therefore,  the  strengthened  capacity  of  enterprises  to  manage,  report,  and \ncomply with requirements under a new public corporations act and so work toward profitability.  \n \n51. \nThe  Program  will  assist  the  Government  in  putting  in  place  a  policy  and  legislative \nframework  that  will  support  sound  decision  making  regarding  public  corporations  and \ngovernment business enterprises. Instead of focusing directly on privatization, the Program will \naim to get the governance framework right to put the Government in the best position to make \nsound  ownership  decisions.  Further,  political  will  for  privatization  needs  time  to  develop.  The \nProgram  will  help  create  this  pro-reform  environment,  and  it  is  expected  that  the  Government \nwill  then  commence  making  decisions  regarding  appropriate  ownership  options  for  specific \npublic  corporations.  Decisions  surrounding \nthe  ownership  and  management  of  public \ncorporations  will,  by  their  very  nature,  be  ongoing  and  will continue  beyond  the  time  period  of \nthe Program. At the same time, ensuring that the tools and skills for improved performance have \nbeen put in place within corporations and within areas of the Government responsible for their \noversight  is  necessary  to  enable  the  corporations  to  respond  to  the  improved  policy  and \nlegislative environment. Reform requires continuous attention so that adjustments can be made \nto  reap  the  opportunities  provided  by  changing  internal  and  external  conditions.  The  Program \nwill start Tuvalu on the path to heightened corporation performance, private sector development, \nand strengthened fiscal management.  \n \n52. \nOutput  1\u2014Improved  Public  Debt  Management  Capacity.  The  Program  will  support \nthe  development  and  implementation  of  a  debt  risk  management  and  mitigation  policy  and \nstrategy.  The  intent  is  to  help  the  Government  move  to  a  more  sustainable  debt  level  and  to \nensure  that  financial  risks  are  at  prudent  levels.  The  policy  and  strategy  will  build  the \nGovernment\u2019s capacity to manage its commitment to meeting PBI 1.3 (para. 12). The policy and \nstrategy  will  be  based  on  risk  analysis  undertaken  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic \nPlanning  (MFEP)  and  will  utilize  the  valuable  debt  information  provided  biannually  by  TTFAC. \nThe policy and strategy can also be potentially used to facilitate dialogue on the use and scope \nof  debt  management  tools  and  their  capacity  for  integration  with  other  financial  planning  and \nmanagement tools.  \n \n\n \n\n\f15\n\n \n\n53. \n\nThe policy and strategy will be inclusive of \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nprocesses  by  which  guarantees  and  debt  are  analyzed  ahead  of  being  entered \ninto;  \nprocesses and responsibilities for approval of new debt; \nconsideration of interest rate and foreign currency risks of existing and proposed \nnew debt; \nclear presentation of debt and planned debt payments in the annual budget; \nstrengthened coordination between MFEP and other stakeholders in the issue of \npublic debt;  \ndebt repayment priorities;  \nprocesses for scheduling debt repayment;  \na  mechanism  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  entry  into  discussions  regarding \ngovernment  debts  that  are  not  subject  to  a  payment  schedule  and  for  which \nrescheduling would be beneficial;  \na  schedule  of  timely  and  standardized  reporting  on  the  Government\u2019s  debt \nportfolio; and \nregular updating of the debt strategy for fiscal results and its alignment with the \nfiscal  and  macroeconomic  forecasts  in  the  budget  and  in  an  MTFF  as  this  is \ndeveloped.  \n\n \nThe  counterpart  funds  generated  from  the  grant  will  allow  for  the  Government\u2019s  full \n54. \nrepayment  of  the  OIASA  overdraft  to  NBT.  The  total  amount  of  the  overdraft  is  estimated  at \nA$3,795,610.15  Any  remaining  counterpart  funds  will  be  directed  by  the  Government  toward \nother  outstanding  debt  to  NBT.  Such  repayments  will  directly  facilitate  the  Government\u2019s \nachievement of PBI 1.3 (para. 12) by reducing its total debt liability. The overdraft repayment will \nsupport the intended outcome of the Program set out in the policy matrix through improving the \nGovernment\u2019s debt position while simultaneously improving the performance indicators for NBT. \nThis should improve the flow of capital to the private sector by alleviating the liquidity constraints \non  NBT.  In  this  way,  the  private  sector  can  be  encouraged  to  take  up  new  and  emerging \nopportunities,  particularly  those  generated  as  the  Government  makes  decisions  regarding  its \nbusiness enterprises.  \n \nThe  taxation  reforms,  as  detailed  in  paras.  16\u201318,  are  anticipated  to  support  more \n55. \nefficient  delivery  of  government  services  and  greater  pro-growth  public  investment  in \ninfrastructure by directly improving government taxation services and providing the resources to \nsupport  the  Government\u2019s  overall  expenditure  decision  making  in  line  with  Tuvalu's  national \nplan. This will also improve the capacity of the Government to manage its debt risk. The longer-\nterm  impact  of  the  reforms  will  contribute  to  the  creation  of  a  more  supportive  business \nenvironment  (through  a  more  equitable  taxation  system,  improved  infrastructure,  and  more \nefficient  government  services  supported  by  enhanced  revenue  management),  which  will \nincrease  the  potential  for  private  sector  activity  and  investment.  The  enabling  legislation  for \ntaxation  reform  is  expected  to  be  approved  in  the  parliamentary  session  commencing \n17 November  2008.  The  intended  implementation  date  is  1  July  2009.  ADB  considers  the \nelements of the taxation reform package listed in para. 18 as being essential to its success and \nrequires these components to be included in the legislation approved by Parliament to ensure \nthat the related tranche 1 condition is achieved.  \n \n56. \nOutput  2\u2014Strengthened  Oversight  of  Public  Enterprises.  The  Government  will \nreview and restructure its public enterprise oversight arrangements to improve management of \nthe  enterprise  monitoring  process  and  performance  outcomes.  To  date,  the  Government  does \n\n                                                 \n15   Government of Tuvalu. 2008. Information Brief. Funafuti. Provided to AusAID, NZAID, and ADB, 22 September.  \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nnot have a strategic or policy-based approach; hence public enterprise performance issues are \nbeing approached very  differently across and within ministries on an ad hoc basis (without an \nunderstanding of underlying causes).  \n \n57. \nImproved  oversight  will  include  changes  to  institutional  arrangements  through  the \nestablishment  of  a  public  enterprise  reform  steering  committee  that  is  representative  of \nTuvaluan society, given the focus on public corporations and public goods. The composition of \nthe  steering  committee  should  adequately  reflect  its  tasks\u2013\u2013hence  the  need  for  it  to  (i)  be \nchaired by a senior official (secretary of MFEP); (ii) have representatives from the Government; \nand  (iii)  have  representatives  from  the  public  (who  are  end  users  of  these  public  goods), \nincluding women and the disadvantaged. An important role of the steering committee will also \nbe to review lessons in enterprise ownership and management, and to facilitate the application \nof lessons to ongoing activities. A public enterprises unit (comprising two professional staff plus \na secretary) will be established, through consolidating currently dispersed oversight roles, and it \nwill  become  the  interface  between  public  enterprises  and  the  Government.  Through  these \nstructures,  a  detailed  and \nissues  underlying \nunderperformance of corporations and government businesses will be developed.  \n \n58. \nAn important element of the Program will be the development and implementation of a \ncabinet-approved  public  enterprise  governance  reform  strategic  policy  to  assist  government \nthinking on the performance of corporations and public enterprises. The strategic policy will be \ninclusive of  \n\ntime-bound  action  plan \n\nto  address \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nGovernment\u2019s service delivery priorities and requirements;  \nidentification of strategic assets and why these are classified as such;  \nposition on ownership of enterprises;  \nconsideration of options for ownership and divestment in relation to each enterprise; \na  process  for,  and  scope  of,  review  of  the  social  and  sustainability  implications  of \nchanges in ownership of government assets; and  \nidentification of small government business-like activities for possible transfer to the \nprivate sector, either through sale or contracting out.  \n\n \n59. \nThe  strategic  policy  will  promote  understanding  of  the  issues  that  arise  in  changing \nownership and/or management of public corporations. Given Tuvalu\u2019s starting point of no policy \nto  guide  decisions  on  ownership  and  management,  and  no  overall  legislation  on  performance \noversight  of  public  corporations,  specific  decisions  on  ownership  are  not  expected  within  the \nprogram period but would be viewed positively should they occur. The Program will be flexible \nto support specific changes wherein the Government proves willing to move ahead. Future ADB \nsupport  is  contemplated  (footnote  2).16  The  intent  of  this  Program  grant  is  to  help  the \nGovernment  reach  a  point  at  which  reform  decisions  can  be  taken  from  a  position  of \nunderstanding.  \n \n60. \nThe Program will support the implementation of the public enterprise governance reform \nstrategic  policy  through  the  preparation  of  a  draft  public  corporations  act.  The  draft  act  will \nprovide a legal framework for the establishment and divestment of public enterprises, including \nreporting  requirements  for  public  enterprises  and  related  monitoring  by  the  Government.  In \nparticular, the draft public corporations act will include \n\n(i) \n\nestablishment of public enterprises as bodies corporate;   \n\n                                                 \n16  Page 68 of the CPS states, \u201cdepending on the outcome of the 2008 grant program, another grant and/or lending \nprogram will be considered for 2009\u20132010 with the focus to more broadly address the inefficiencies of the public \nenterprises and thereby reinforce ADB\u2019s focus on improved financial management.\u201d  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\nrole of the board of directors and management, and the procedure and criteria for \nappointment and dismissal of directors and managers; \nrequirement for periodic disclosure of information and filing of audited accounts; \nprocedure for decorporatization (if any) and the implications thereof;17 \nroles of the relevant minister and the auditor general;  \nprovision for the introduction of performance contracts for management based on \nagreed upon outputs; and \n\n(vii)  penalties for noncompliance with the public corporations act. \n\nfunctions.  Appendix  4  (problems  and  constraints  analysis)  contains \n\n \nThe  provision  of  such  a  clear  regulatory  framework  is  particularly  important  in  a  small \n61. \nsociety with close kinship links such as Tuvalu. Clarity in regulatory requirements will reduce the \npotential for discretion by individuals in the application of policies and so will reduce the ability of \ninterest  groups  to  place  inappropriate  pressures  on  decision  makers  and  bureaucrats  with \nfurther \nregulatory \nassessment of social and cultural constraints in Tuvalu.  \n \nPursuant  to  the  enactment  of  the  public corporations  act,  revisions  will  be  made  in  the \n62. \ngoverning acts of each public enterprise to reflect changes introduced by the public corporations \nact.  A  framework  for  relationships  and  powers  of  authority  of  the  relevant  ministers  of \ncorporatized  entities  will  also  be  developed.  The  Program  will  also  consider  the  legal  status, \nunder  the  proposed  new  bill,  of  the  Tuvalu  Copra  Trading  Corporation,  NAFICOT,  and  the \nTuvalu  Philatelic  Bureau  (which  currently  are  considered  by  the  auditor  general  to  be \ncorporations, although they do not have their own legal framework). \n \nThe  Program  will  support  an  assessment  of  the  trends  and  level  of  current  subsidies \n63. \nincluding  the  management  issues  that  form  the  basis  for  the  subsidy  or  overdraft  request  and \nwill  develop  clear  plans  to  reduce  and  eliminate  these  within  a  defined  time  frame.  This \nassessment  will  include  review  of  the  extent  (if  any)  to  which  subsidies  are  required  to  cover \ncosts  of  essential  but  nonprofitable  services.  The  assessment  will  review  the  merits  of \nintroducing community service obligation contracts and payments based on negotiation of fees \nand services between the corporation and the Government.  \n \n64.  More  specifically,  the  Program  will  also  address  the  financial  sustainability  issue  being \nfaced by TEC and TTC by reviewing existing studies and assessing the current tariff levels as a \nbasis for providing options as to how the financial requirements of these public enterprises could \nbe  balanced  with  the  cost  of  the  community  service  obligations  required  of  them  by  the \nGovernment.  The  intent  is  to  move  TTC  and  TEC  to  a  financially  sustainable  basis  wherein \nnonprofitable social services are transparently funded by the Government.  \n \n65. \nThe  scope  of  the  Program  will  also  extend  to  assessing  the  viability  of  improving  the \nperformance  of  the  small  business-like  activities  that  are  embedded  in  ministry  functions, \nincluding through the contracting out of these services to the private sector. The capacity and \npotential  of  government  noncorporatized  businesses  will  be  assessed,  and  planning  and \nreporting  frameworks  based  on  the  templates  for  enterprises  will  be  introduced  and  built  as \nfound beneficial. \n \n66. \nThe Government does not have a detailed understanding of the scope of private sector \nopportunities  in  Tuvalu  (and  reflecting  differing  opportunities  on  Funafuti  and  on  the  outer \n\n                                                 \n17  In Tuvalu, decorporatization has involved bringing a public corporation back within the structure and direct control \nof  a  ministry  as  opposed  to  being  apart  from  ministries  and  being  overseen  by  a  board.  There  will  need  to  be \nspecific consideration of the legal status of the decorporatized Tuvalu Media Corporation. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nislands).  While  Tuvalu\u2019s  small  population,  dispersed  geographical  nature,  and  currently  limited \ntransportation linkages place natural barriers upon the scope for private sector development, an \nanalysis  of  patterns  in  private  sector  lending,  business  licensing,  and  human  resource \ncapacities in the private sector would allow the Government to identify potential areas for growth \nand niche markets. The Program will carry out this analysis. This will be of particular use when \nlooking at government business activities currently embedded within ministries but that could be \ncontracted  out.  This  understanding  will  help  the  Government  when  approached  by  foreign \ninvestors.  \n \nOutput 2 is expected to impact on Tuvalu\u2019s budgetary position by facilitating the ability of \n67. \nthe  Government  to  control  the  level  of  subsidies  being  demanded  by,  and  directed  to,  public \ncorporations and by improving the financial performance of public enterprises. This will alleviate \nexpenditure demands and so assist the Government in achieving PBI 1.1 (para. 12). PBIs 1.3, \n2.1,  and  2.2  will  be  indirectly  assisted,  as  better  expenditure  management  will  free  funds  that \nthe Government can direct to support achievement of these other PBIs.  \n \nOutput 3\u2014Strengthened Management Capacity in Public Enterprises. The Program \n68. \nwill  facilitate  a  review  of  the  role  of  the  board  of  directors  in  public  enterprises  and  of  its \nmembership.  The  intended  result  will  be  a  series  of  recommendations  to  strengthen  board \nperformance. These should include a clear understanding of the relationship between the board \nand  the  general  manager  and  the  requirement  for  role  separation,  and  the  coverage  to  the \ndegree  possible  of  all  major  roles  and  skill  requirements  (financial,  human  resource \ndevelopment, technical, etc.) by board members.  \n \nAt  the  micro  level,  the  Program  will  work  with  general  managers  and  boards  of  public \n69. \nenterprises to develop and implement a corporate plan and an action plan for each enterprise to \nassist them to meet the requirements of the public corporations act, based on the Government\u2019s \npublic  enterprise  governance  reform  strategic  policy.  The  capacity  of  boards  and  general \nmanagers will be improved in preparation, management, and monitoring. Auditor control issues \nwill  be  incorporated  into  the  corporate  plans,  with  quarterly  and  annual  progress  reports \nprepared  to  address  issues  raised  by  the  auditor  general.  Templates  will  be  prepared  for \ncorporate plans, annual reports, and quarterly reports to the board.  \n \n70. \nresource \nmanagement in public enterprises. Accounting will be improved through the introduction of basic \naccounting skills as required, allowing accounts to be prepared and submitted to the board (and \nthen to the Public Enterprise Unit) in standardized formats and on time. Priority will be accorded \nto  the  development  or  recruitment  of  financial  management  expertise  for  all  enterprises.  Job \ndescriptions  will  be  developed  for  use  by  enterprises,  together  with  a  performance  appraisal \nformat.  The  merits  of  introducing  performance  contracts  for  general  managers  (initially)  based \non achievement of corporate plan targets will be considered. This will also act as a mechanism \nfor  the  board  to  control  excesses  in  salary  increases  and  employment  conditions  without \ncommensurate performance improvement. \n \nThe Program will make a specific target of NBT, reflecting its vital role as a provider of \n71. \nfinance  to  the  private  sector.  Improved  NBT  performance  can  reduce  lending  costs  for \nborrowers. The intent is to recognize NBT\u2019s status as Tuvalu\u2019s most profitable public enterprise, \nto ensure that the conditions that have supported this profitability are sustained, and to further \naddress issues concerning performance. The required actions will also improve NBT\u2019s operating \npolicies and remove constraints to private sector investor interest in NBT. \n \n\nin  accounting  and  human \n\nThe  Program  will  support \n\nimprovements \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\n72. \nThe  Program  will  support  specific  changes  in  NBT  policy  and  practice  directed  at \nimproved  performance.  Board-approved  revisions  in  NBT\u2019s  policies  for  the  timely  collection  of \npast due loans and advances of credit are needed to comply with international best practices. \nThe  written  collection  policy  should  include  specific  and  increasingly  more  stringent  actions \n(comprising  telephone  contact,  personal  visits  with  the  borrower,  and  demand  letters)  to  be \ntaken for the collection of past due loans, and the time lines for each action. The adoption of a \nwritten and board-approved liquidity policy is needed to better measure, monitor, and maintain \nadequate  liquidity.  This  policy  should  (i)  provide  for  the  establishment  of  an  asset\u2013liability \nmanagement  committee  and  determine  its  responsibilities;  (ii)  determine  authorities  to  make \nliquidity and funds management decisions, and require reporting on these; (iii) set loan\u2013deposit \nratios; (iv) set liquidity target parameters; (v) require maturity gap analysis reports of realizable \nearning assets (excluding nonperforming loans) and liabilities; and (vi) require regular reviews of \nNBT\u2019s deposit structure.   \n \n73. \nFurther, the Program will promote the adoption and implementation of a legal framework \nfor the licensing and ongoing supervision and regulation of banking institutions that provides for \nimplementation  of,  and  adherence  to,  the  Basel  core  principles  for  effective  banking \nsupervision.18  Financial  supervision  will  be  conducted  to  enhance  the  stability,  reliability, \ntransparency, and efficiency of the financial sector to reduce systemic risks and to prevent the \nabuse  of  the  financial  sector  for  criminal  purposes,  with  a  view  to  protecting  the  interests  of \nclients and investors by safeguarding their financial resources, and thereby supporting financial \nstability.  \n \n74. \nThis component of the Program will be directly supported by PFTAC, and is reflective of \nstrong fiscal and financial sector aid coordination in Tuvalu. NBT undertakes both deposit-taking \nand  lending  and  so  will  be  immediately  covered  by  the  legal  framework  developed.  DBT  and \nTNPF are both currently providing only lending services so will not be included in the coverage \nof the legal framework until such time as they embark upon deposit-taking.  \n \n75. \nOutput 3 will support achievement of the PBIs both directly and indirectly. Output 3 will \nsupport  the  Government  in  ensuring  that  public  corporations  generate  less  fiscal  demand  and \nmay  support  the  move  of  some  to  a  positive  financial  outcome  and  hence  the  Government\u2019s \nearning of dividends. This will alleviate expenditure demands and so assist the Government in \nachieving  PBI  1.1  (para.  12).  PBIs  1.3,  2.1,  and  2.2  will  be  indirectly  assisted,  as  better \nexpenditure management will free funds that the Government can use to support achievement \nof these other PBIs.  \n \n76. \nLeveraging Change. The Program will set Tuvalu on a path of reform, with the tranche \nconditions playing an important role in leveraging needed changes. The tranche conditions will \ndevelop  the  Government\u2019s  understanding  of  the  need  for  reforms  and  will  act  to  create  an \nenvironment in which reformist actions can be taken.  \n \n77. \nThe  first  set  of  tranche  conditions  will  act  to  demonstrate  both  the  Government\u2019s \ncommitment to reform and broader parliamentary support for priority reforms. This will be done \nthrough, first, requiring Parliament to pass legislation reforming the taxation system (para. 16\u2013\n18). Passing of the taxation reform legislation will be the outcome of a considerable process of \npublic  consultation  and  parliamentary  scrutiny  through  three  readings  of  the  proposed \nlegislation. The first tranche conditions will also elicit government commitment to move forward \nwith  the  reforms  through  cabinet  approval  for  the  development  of  a  public  enterprise \n\n                                                 \n18  Bank for International Settlements. 2006. Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision. Basel Committee on \n\nBanking Supervision. Basel, Switzerland.  \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\ngovernance reform strategic policy, a public corporations act, and a debt risk management and \nmitigation  policy  and  strategy.  Achieving  cabinet  commitment  to  this  work  will  require  cabinet \ndiscussion  and  understanding  of  the  scope  and  intent  of  these  proposed  policies,  strategies, \nand legislation. Finally, the first set of tranche conditions will require the Government (MFEP) to \nundertake preliminary analysis of the private sector\u2019s growth potential, and in so doing a better \nunderstanding of the potential longer-term benefits flowing out of reforms will be generated.  \n \n78. \nThe second set of tranche conditions will require firm reformist actions on the part of the \nGovernment.  The  cabinet  will  need  to  put  in  place  policies  and  strategies  to  guide  them  in \nreform  implementation\u2014through  cabinet  approval  of  the  public  enterprise  governance  reform \nstrategic policy and the debt risk management and mitigation policy and strategy. Parliament\u2019s \ncommitment to reform will also be leveraged through the second tranche conditions. Tabling of \na  public  corporations  act  will  be  required,  as  will  the  adoption  of  a  legal  framework  for  the \nlicensing  and  ongoing  supervision  and  regulation  of  banking  institutions.  Second  tranche \nconditions  will  require  the  Government  to  cause  the  operational  policies  of  one  public \ncorporation to be strengthened\u2014NBT should have in place written and board-approved policies \nfor the timely collection of past due loans and advances of credit and for measuring, monitoring, \nand  maintaining  adequate  liquidity.  The  second  tranche  will  also  require  government  action  to \nreduce its debt level (through repayment of the OIASA and other debt held with NBT) and in so \ndoing  will  remove  some  of  the  financial  constraint  under  which  NBT  is  operating.  Finally,  the \nsecond tranche will require the Government (MFEP) to prepare a detailed report on the private \nsector\u2019s growth potential inclusive of market capacity and sustainability. Together, these actions \nwill create an environment supportive of further and more specific reform actions. \n \nHarmonization.  The  principles  of  harmonization  and  coordination  with  other \n79. \ndevelopment  partners\u2019  activities  will  underlie  the  success  of  the  Program.  The  Program  will \nsupport the Government in its achievement of the PBIs, which were developed in concert with \nADB, AusAID, and NZAID. Tuvalu\u2019s receipt of financial support from AusAID and NZAID for the \nrecurrent budget through incentive payments, over the usual country allocation, for achievement \nof the PBIs will be facilitated by ADB\u2019s program grant.  \n \n80.  Capacity Development. Capacity development is a further principle that will underlie the \nsuccess of the Program. Capacity development will be supported by the standalone TA detailed \nin Appendix 5 and is essential to the Program at both the individual and organizational levels to \nensure  continuous  skill  development,  competence,  and  confidence  of  MFEP,  the  public \nenterprise  reform  steering  committee,  the  public  enterprises  unit,  boards,  and  general \nmanagers. Capacity building through the development of high-level policy and legislation and its \nimplementation will require attention to the capacity of the institutional and political environment, \nwhich  will  be  supported  by  the  approved  TA,  in  particular  through  the  inclusion  of  a  local \nfacilitator in the consultant team, who will bring an understanding of issues of political economy \nto specific activities under the TA. The TA will provide for capacity development of individuals \nthrough formal and informal training and mentoring, with emphasis on on-the-job development \nand learning by doing, with a team approach taken to all activities and issues. Consultative and \nparticipatory public and stakeholder activities will also be undertaken in regard to the proposed \nreforms  and  specific  public  enterprise  performance  issues,  which  will  contribute  to  broader \ncapacity  development  promoted \nthe  effective \nengagement of these groups in the reform process.  \n \nC. \n \n81.  Asian Development Fund IX Grant. A policy paper on Revising the Framework for Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grants was approved by the ADB Board on 26 September 2007. According \n\nthe  program  grant  by  allowing \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nthrough \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nto the policy paper, Tuvalu is classified as country with high risk of debt distress and is therefore \neligible to receive 100% grant assistance. \n \n82.  ADB  will  support  the  Program  through  a  grant  of  $3.24  million  provided  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources to support the Government\u2019s implementation of the policy, institutional, \nand  legal  reforms  for  strengthened  financial  management.  The  framework  put  in  place  will \nsupport  the  government  in  sound  decision  making  regarding  public  corporations  and \ngovernment business enterprises. The resultant decisions can be expected to have social and \npolitical  impacts.  The  policy  framework  guiding  these  decisions  will  support  Government's \nanalysis of the impacts of its decisions and provide tools to ameliorate negative social impacts, \nas well as setting out processes for broad-based consultation to generate the required political \nsupport  for  change.  The  counterpart  funds  generated  from  the  grant  will  allow  for  the \nGovernment\u2019s full repayment of the OIASA overdraft to NBT. The total amount of the overdraft \nis  estimated  at  A$3,795,610.  Any  remaining  counterpart  funds  will  be  directed  by  the \nGovernment  toward  other  outstanding  debt  to  NBT.  The  overdraft  repayment  will  support  the \nintended  outcome  of  the  Program  set  out  in  the  policy  matrix  through  improving  the \nGovernment\u2019s debt position while simultaneously improving the performance indicators for NBT. \nThere  are  significant  potential  savings  to  the  Government  from  improved  public  enterprise \nperformance. Annual on-budget expenditure by the Government in support of public enterprises \nhas been estimated to exceed A$6 million (with further off-budget expenditure), compared with \ntotal annual government on-budget expenditure, which has ranged between A$16.2 million and \nA$32.9 million during the past decade. The size of the grant is based on the importance of the \nreforms, the state of public finances, and the level of government debt. \n \nD. \n \n83. \nProgram Management. MFEP will be the Executing Agency and will coordinate policy, \nlegal,  and  regulatory  actions.  MFEP  will  also  ensure  that  the  policy  reforms,  as  agreed  to  by \nADB and the Government and as described in the development policy letter and set forth in the \npolicy  matrix  (Appendix  6),  are  duly  carried  out  in  a  timely  manner.  In  particular,  MFEP  will \nensure that provisions for reporting, monitoring, auditing, and other administrative requirements \nwill  be strictly  followed. A  program  steering committee,  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  MFEP  and \nincluding representatives of the Office of the Attorney General and MFEP\u2019s budget and public \nenterprise  oversight  areas,  will  be  established  to  monitor  and  coordinate  the  Program  and \nsupporting TA from ADB and others.  \n \nImplementation  Period.  The  Program  period  is  from  1  November  2008  to  31 March \n84. \n2010.  Policy,  legislative,  organizational,  and  operational  changes  agreed  upon  with  the \nGovernment and set out in the policy matrix are to be put in place from 1 November 2008 to 30 \nNovember 2009.  \n \n85. \nProcurement and Disbursement. The proceeds of the grant will be disbursed to Tuvalu \nas  the  recipient  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and  related \nrequirements for programs loans.19 The proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange \ncost of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding items included in a \nlist  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  7)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral \nsources.  Grant  proceeds  disbursed  against  imports  will  require  a  certificate  from  the \nGovernment  stipulating  that  the  value  of  the  total  imports  of  Tuvalu,  minus  its  imports  from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance, is equal to or greater than the amount of the grant expected to be disbursed during \n\n                                                 \n19  ADB. 1998.

ADB will have the right to audit the use of the grant proceeds, and to verify the \naccuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \n86. \nTranches. The grant will be provided in two tranches. The first tranche of $1.24 million \nwill  be  available  upon  satisfaction  of  the  first  tranche  conditions  and  grant  effectiveness, \nestimated  at  around  November  2008.  The  second  tranche  of  $2  million  will  be  available  upon \nsatisfaction of the second tranche conditions, estimated at around October 2009. In addition, the \nGovernment  must  complete  the  nontranche  release  policy  actions  set  out  in  the  policy  matrix \nduring the implementation period. While these policy actions are not conditions for the release \nof the first or second tranches, they are essential steps for achieving the program outcome.  \n \n87. \nCounterpart  Funds.  Local  currency  generated  from  the  grant  will  be  directed  to \nrepayment  of  the  Government\u2019s  overdraft  in  the  OIASA  with  NBT.  The  overdraft  totals \nA$3,795,610,  and  the  local  currency  generated  from  the  grant  will  eliminate  this  overdraft.  In \nparticular,  $1.24  million  equivalent  from  the  first  tranche  and  $2  million  equivalent  from  the \nsecond  tranche  will  be  applied  for  the  complete  repayment  of  the  A$3.796  million  OIASA \noverdraft.  Any  remaining  counterpart  funds  will  be  directed  by  the  Government  toward  other \noutstanding debt to NBT. \n \n88. \nProgram Performance Monitoring and Evaluation. MFEP will (i) within 3 months from \ngrant  effectiveness,  establish  and maintain  a  performance  evaluation  system  for  the  Program, \nwhich will include the policy actions from the policy matrix; and (ii) monitor and report to ADB, \non  a  semiannual  basis,  the  implementation  of  policy  actions  and  their  impact  on  budget \noutcomes and public enterprise performance (including financial and performance indictors), in \nline with the program impact and outcome indicators agreed upon with the Government. As the \noutcomes  and  impacts  of  the  Program  will  be  most  clearly  felt  beyond  the  period  of  its \nimplementation, the monitoring of these will continue to be undertaken by MFEP. Monitoring of \noutcomes and impacts will be useful to the Government\u2019s own processes and decision making \nand  as  such  is  not  an  onerous  requirement.  A  review  of  the  progress  of  the  Program  will  be \nundertaken  jointly  by  ADB  and  PFTAC  in  consultation  with  the  Government  before  the  end  of \nthe third quarter of 2009 to ensure that the second tranche conditions (and other policy actions), \nas specified in the development policy letter and the program matrix (Appendix 6), are met.   \n \n89. \nprogram reviews will be carried out in conjunction with associated TA reviews. \n \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \n90. \nto  and  discussed  with  the  Government  and  the  Executing  Agency.  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations. In particular, all contracts financed by \nADB in connection with the Program will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Program. \n \n91. \nTechnical  Assistance.  On  3  November  2008,  ADB  approved  TA  for  capacity \ndevelopment for public financial management to the Government of Tuvalu (Appendix 5).20 The \n                                                 \n20  ADB.  2008.

Apart  from  the  joint  review  with  PFTAC  mentioned  in  para.  88, \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\nTA  will  enhance  fiscal  stability  through  (i)  providing  for  a  broad  diagnostic  analysis  of  MFEP\u2019s \ncapacity,  (ii)  supporting  government  preparation  of  an  MTFF,  and  (iii)  creating  the  policy  and \nlegislative  environment  for  improving  the  performance  of  public  enterprises.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented  over  a  3-year  period  to  enable  the  progress  achieved  under  the  Program  to  be \nbuilt upon through continued support to the implementation of government decisions regarding \nreform  of  specific  public  corporations.  The  TA  will  not  provide  for  the  assessment  of  program \npolicy actions.  \n \n92. \nThe MTFF and the capacity assessment of MFEP will both provide important support to \nprogram  activities.  The  MTFF  will  assist  in  strengthening  planning  and  reallocation  of \ngovernment resources against priorities, thereby  acting to reinforce program actions regarding \nappropriate assessment of subsidies and costs of community service obligations. The MTFF will \nalso  provide  an  anchor  for  the  debt  risk  management  and  mitigation  policy  and  strategy.  The \nfindings  of  the  MFEP  capacity  assessment  will  allow  for  identification  of  priority  areas  for \nstrengthening and will provide a mechanism to attract additional development partners\u2019 support \nfor capacity building. Clearly, a stronger MFEP will be of benefit to program implementation.  \n \n93. \nOther  Assistance.  PFTAC  will  provide  support  as  required  for  the  development  and \nimplementation of the financial institutions act through its banking supervision advisor or through \nperipatetic  advisors.  PFTAC  did,  in  2002,  provide  model  legislation  to  Tuvalu  that  had \nundergone  some  development  in-country  but  was  not  completed.  PFTAC  will  seek  to \nreinvigorate this process with the intention of enabling the Government to meet second tranche \nconditions.  \n \nA range of other development partner assistance is also relevant to the sustainability of \n94. \nthe program grant outcome and impact. The current and planned assistance from Australia and \nNew  Zealand  directed  toward  strengthened  financial  management  creates  a  sound  continuing \nenvironment  for  program  grant  implementation.  For  example,  AusAID  has  funded  a  budget \nadviser  in  Tuvalu  since  2005,  with  this  position  providing  support  for  the  development  and \nimplementation  of  an  MTFF.  AusAID  is  also  funding  an  advisor  to  the  auditor  general,  with \nimproved  functioning  of  this  office  supporting  the  oversight  of  public  enterprises.  ADB\u2019s  own \nfuture  program  of  assistance,  set  out  in  the  Tuvalu  CPS  2008\u20132012,  provides  for  a  second \nphase of TA to support capacity development  for financial management, which is indicative of \nADB\u2019s ongoing commitment to this sector (footnote 2). Thus this TA is situated within a larger \nand ongoing program of development partner support for strengthened financial management. \nAppendix 8 contains a matrix of current and planned external assistance to Tuvalu.  \n \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \n95. \nThe  major  benefits  of  the  Program  will  be  long-term  fiscal  stability  and  improved \nenterprise  performance.  These  benefits  will  act  to  reinforce  the  political  will  to  implement \nchange.  \n \n96. \nFiscal. A reduction in the demand on the budget by public enterprises will create fiscal \nspace  and  allow  for  allocation  of  expenditures  to  priority  areas,  thus  improving  Tuvalu\u2019s  fiscal \nperformance. A 2005 estimate suggested that 13% of on-budget expenditure (about $6 million \nin  2005)  was  directed  to  supporting  the  shortfall  in  operating  revenues  of  public  enterprises. \nThere are also clear indications that a significant level of off-budget expenditure is also directed \nto supporting public enterprises.  \n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\n97. \nThe  longer-term  impact  of  the  actions  supported  by  the  Program  will  be  to  reduce  the \nGovernment\u2019s  responsibility  for  such  support  to  that  of  providing  for  contracted  community \nservice obligations. Thus the longer-term fiscal implications of the Program could be savings in \nthe order of 7%\u20138% of on-budget expenditure. The support this level of funds could provide to \nmeeting the fiscal PBIs would facilitate Tuvalu\u2019s access to incentive payments from both AusAID \nand NZAID and so further leverage the benefits of the Program.  \n \n98. \nGreater  transparency  in  transfers  to  public  enterprises  and  the  provision  of  these  in \nexchange  for  services  will  contribute  to  greater  budget  clarity.  This  will  also  be  served  by \nstrengthened financial understanding on the part of both public enterprise employees and board \nmembers.  \n \n99. \nUtilization of the fiscal space created by the grant to repay the OIASA overdraft will have \nbenefits  both  for  the  Government,  in  terms  of  a  reduced  debt  level  and  improved  financial \nposition,  and  also  for  NBT,  placing  NBT  in  an  improved  financial  position,  freeing  capital  for \nlending and/or investment, thus enabling greater private sector access to funds. Fiscal stability, \nas well as improved NBT liquidity, is likely to engender increased business confidence and the \ninterest  of  the  private  sector  in  new  and  existing  business  development,  and  therefore  to \ncontribute  to  improvements  in  social  impact  including  better  access  to  education  and  health \nservices through reduced household financial pressure.  \n \n100.  Strengthened  Government  Decision  Making.  With  the  adoption  of  the  public \nenterprise  governance  reform  strategic  policy,  the  Government  will  be  well  placed  to  consider \nand  assess  alternate  ownership  and  management  options  for  its  public  corporations  and \ngovernment businesses.  \n \n101.  Government  Oversight  of  Public  Corporations.  Ministries  with  responsibilities  to \npublic  enterprises  will  need  to  develop  a  new  working  relationship  with  the  public  enterprises, \nmoving away from a master\u2013servant interaction to a client\u2013provider relationship. Ministries will \ninitially  need  to  work  closely  with  public  enterprises  to  identify  community  service  obligations, \nset these at appropriate levels, and cost them. Ministries will benefit from such a process in that \nthe  required  supplements  to  public  enterprise  budgets  will  be  transparent  and  related  to  the \nquality and quantity of services received.  \n \n102.  The  establishment  of  a  public  enterprise  unit  will  consolidate  efforts  to  improve \ngovernment revenue through establishing profitable enterprises by establishing the unit as the \nvehicle  for  encouraging  performance,  providing  skill  development  to  enterprise  managers  and \nboards, and monitoring performance against agreed upon indicators. \n \n103. \nImproved  public  enterprise  efficiency  and  performance,  including  returning  a  profit,  will \nconsolidate the value of fiscal discipline and performance measures. Improved service delivery \n(the way in which services are delivered as well as what is delivered) will both enhance political \ncommitment  and  consolidate  the  public  perception  of  political  commitment  to  better  fiscal \nmanagement as well as effect enterprises. \n \n104.  Public  Enterprise  Management.  The  impact  of  the  Program  will  be  felt  most \nimmediately  by  general  managers  and  staff  of  the  public  enterprises.  Efficiency  and \nperformance  will  be  elevated  in  importance,  and  mechanisms  will  be  put  in  place  to  monitor \nindicators of these. Current reliance on family and communal connections to overlook poor work \neffort  will  be  reduced  through  the  development  of  job  descriptions  and  clear  performance \ntargets.  New  and  enforced  requirements  for  financial  and  performance  reporting  will  enforce \nfiscal transparency and promote fiscal discipline within public enterprises.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25\n\nRisks \n\n105.  Within  public  enterprises,  capacities  will  be  developed  to  support  performance-focused \nmanagement and strengthened financial management. This is one of the benefits of undertaking \na holistic approach to the improvement of public enterprise performance outside of a situation of \nfiscal  crisis,  when  the  urgency  of  change  would  be  paramount  and  capacity  development  a \nlesser priority.  \n \nB. \n \n106.  Risks  relate  mainly  to  continued  political  will  to  establish  and  carry  out  a  robust  policy \nframework  for  improvement  of  enterprise  performance,  availability  and  sustainability  of \nappropriate  technical  capacity,  appropriateness  of  institutional  requirements  and  government \ncommitment  to  establish  a  public  enterprise  unit,  and  commitment  to  capacity  development \nsuccess and sustainability. Because external economic factors may affect the willingness of the \npublic  and  the  private  sector  to  take  on  risk\u2014and  therefore  may  affect  lending  and  business \ndevelopment\u2014they must be included in risk assessment and in management strategies. \n \n107.  Economic.  World  economic  volatility  leaves  import-reliant  Tuvalu  vulnerable  to  price \nescalation.  National,  Pacific  regional,  and  international  economic  indicators  will  need  to  be \nmonitored  as  an  aid  to  fiscal  management.  The  recent  increase  in  import  prices,  such  as  has \nbeen  the  case  for  fuel  and  food,  has  left  a  significant  impact  on  both  customers  and  the \nGovernment.  While  the  global  commodity  prices,  particularly  fuel  are  declining,  the  impacts  of \nthe  increases  are  experienced  by  Tuvalu  with  a  significant  lag  as  the  prices  flow  through  the \nsupply  contracts  through  Fiji  Islands,  from  where  supply  channels  finally  transfer  the  prices  to \nTuvalu. This translates to built budgetary pressures that will continue to reduce Tuvalu\u2019s fiscal \nspace in 2009.   \n \n108.  Political Will. The current Government has indicted commitment to the five fiscal PBIs. \nThe  commitment  to  working  toward  achievement  of  the  PBIs  is  fundamental  to  program \nsuccess.  A  change  in  the  Government  or  its  leadership  may  weaken  this  commitment.  The \nimpacts  of  the  Program  will  take  time  to  manifest  themselves,  but  the  costs  will  occur  earlier. \nThe  Government  must  be  confident  and  present  publicly  the  benefits  of  the  fiscal  reforms  on \nmacroeconomic stability and how this will benefit all. Mitigation efforts will be supported by the \nTA, which provides for a local project facilitator who will have the role of developing public and \nstakeholder awareness and understanding of the objectives of the reforms being implemented. \nThis is expected to promote broad-based support for the reforms and will be complemented by \nsimilar  educational  activities  for  members  of  Parliament  and  public  enterprise  staff.  Mitigation \nmeasures for those who may be negatively affected by the Government\u2019s subsequent actions in \nrelation to public corporation ownership, management, and operations will need to be developed \nby the Government. \n \n109.  The  Program  will  likely  increase  the  workload  of  board  members,  as  they  will  have \nimproved information to consider at their meetings and increased skills to apply to their task as \ndirectors. The board will also be expected to play a role in setting the strategic direction of the \npublic enterprise during corporate planning activities. There is a risk that board members will not \nrise  to  this  challenge,  although  this  will  be  mitigated  through  capacity  development  and \nimproved board selection criteria and processes.  \n \n110.  Capacity  Development.  Embarking  on  fiscal  and  enterprise  improvement  of  this \nmagnitude requires both skills and an understanding of the ongoing and iterative nature of the \nprocess.  It  signifies  a  commitment  to  ongoing  fiscal  improvement.  Public  servants  will  require \nongoing  capacity  development  to  enable  them  to  have  the  competence  and  confidence  to \nparticipate fully and take ownership of this process. The low skill base constitutes a significant \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\ntrack \n\nrecord \n\nin  paying \n\nrisk. This risk will be mitigated through the TA, which ties TA input closely to tranche conditions. \nThe  TA  will  also  provide  for  a  local  facilitator  to  assist  the  technical  specialists  in  increasing \nunderstanding of the issues the program grant and TA are designed to address; and to support \nconsultation,  participation,  and  awareness-raising  directed  at  members  of  Parliament,  relevant \ngovernment and public enterprise staff, as well as the public. This position will further enhance \nthe incorporation of an understanding of issues of political economy in specific activity design.  \n \n111.  Capacity development is both an underlying risk management factor and a risk. Capacity \ndevelopment  of  a  cadre  of  staff  with  the  critical  mass  to  manage  the  process  of  fiscal  reform \nthrough  to  measurable  impacts  is  essential.  However,  Tuvalu,  like  the  rest  of  the  Pacific,  is \nvulnerable  to  the  loss  of  human  resources  to  the  enticement  of  greater  financial  rewards  and \ncareer opportunities available only in a larger economy. \n \n112.  Government  Oversight  of  Public Corporations.  Ministries  and  government  agencies \nwill be placed under greater pressure to meet their obligations to public enterprises for service \nprovision.  The  Government  has  a  poor \nits  electricity  and \ntelecommunications  bills,  although  this  seems  to  have  been  largely  addressed  recently.  It  will \nneed to continue to make adequate provision to pay its bills, as in a more performance-focused \noperating environment, TEC and TTC will need to treat the Government in a similar manner to \nall  their  other  customers  when  it  comes  to  delinquency.  Support  provided  to  the  Government \nthrough the TA, and by other development partners, to improve annual budget development and \nmanagement will act to further mitigate this concern.  \n \n113.  Social Impact. The public and private sector may also feel the impacts of the Program \nin  terms  of  changes  in  quality  and  costs  of  services.  Given  the  degree  of  subsidization  of \nservices  to  the  consumer,  both  directly  (through  artificially  low  tariffs)  and  indirectly  (through \ngeneral  subsidies  to  public  enterprise  budgets),  there  will  likely  have  to  be  some  upward \nadjustment of prices of services by some public enterprises. It is also expected that an improved \nquality  of  service  will  be  provided.  Again,  planning  of  these adjustments  can  allow  them  to  be \nstepped  over  time  and  also  allow  for  development  of  programs  of  assistance  to  target  the \nneediest in society to ensure that their basic service needs are met.  \n \n114.  Rationalization seems a likely path for at least one public enterprise, and such a decision \nmay  have  social  impacts  should  the  Government  chose  to  cut  jobs  rather  than  to  reposition \nstaff, with reductions being made through natural attrition. Again, making this decision in a less \npressured  environment  that  allows  time  for  analysis  and  consideration  of  options  means  that \nsteps can be taken, in terms of retraining or compensation, to avert the worst social impacts and \nto  avoid  imposing  hardship  on  those  families  directly  involved.  Appendix  9  contains  the \nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy.   \n \n115.  Overall.  Achievement  of  the  potential  benefits  to  the  Government  in  terms  of  fiscal \nstability,  and  improvements  in  enterprise  performance  and  in  business  and  public  confidence \nthrough supporting the Program far outweigh the risks. Indeed, the cost of no action would be \nborne  by  the  Government  through  ballooning  subsidies  to  public  corporations,  and  by  the \npeople  of  Tuvalu  through  declining  public  services.  The  overall  benefits  of  the  program  grant \nconsiderably outweigh the costs and the risks. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n27\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecial Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n116. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\nThe  Government  will  (a)  ensure  that  the  policies  adopted  and  actions  taken  as \ndescribed in the development policy letter, including the policy matrix, continue in \neffect for the duration of the program period and subsequently; and (b) promptly \nadopt  all  other  policies  and  take  all  other  actions  indicated  in  the  development \npolicy letter, including the policy matrix, and ensure that such policies and actions \ncontinue in effect for the duration of the program period and subsequently. \n\nThe  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nmultilateral or bilateral aid agencies that have implications for implementation of \nthe  Program,  keep  ADB  informed  of  the  progress  made  in  carrying  out  the \npolicies and actions set out in the development policy letter and the policy matrix, \nand  provide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy \nproposals.  The  Government  will  continue  timely  policy  dialogue  with  ADB  on \nproblems and constraints encountered during implementation of the Program and \non desirable changes to overcome or mitigate such problems and constraints. \n\nThroughout the implementation of the Program, the Government will ensure that \nadequate  resources  are  allocated  and  released  in  a  timely  manner  in  order  to \nensure  proper  implementation  of  the  Program  as  described  in  the  development \npolicy  letter.    The  Government  will  ensure  that the  counterpart  funds  generated \nout  of  the  grant  proceeds  are  directed,  first,  to the  repayment  of  its  overdraft  in \nthe OIASA with NBT, and, second, toward the repayment of any outstanding debt \nof the Government to NBT.  \n\nThe  Government  will  undertake  necessary  measures  to  create  and  sustain  a \ncorruption-free  environment;  ensure  that  its  anticorruption  law  and  regulations \nand ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) are strictly enforced \nand  complied  with  during  the  program  implementation;  and  facilitate  ADB\u2019s \nexercising  its  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. \n\nThe  Government  will  establish,  by  31  January  2009,  a  program  steering \ncommittee  chaired  by  the  Secretary  of  MFEP  and  comprised  of  representatives \nof  the  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  and  MFEP\u2019s  budget  and  public  enterprise \noversight areas to monitor and coordinate the Program and supporting technical \nassistance from ADB and other agencies. \n\nCondition to Grant Effectiveness \n\n \nB. \n \n117.

There  is  interest  in \nprivatization  on  the  part  of  the  Government  with  some  talks  with  a  foreign  bank  regarding \ncomplete  divestiture  having  taken  place  intermittently  between  2004  and  2006.  However,  this \ndid  not  eventuate.  There  has  also  been  a  suggestion  of  the  issuance  of  shares  to  the  public, \nthough again this would be dependent on reduced government involvement.   \n \n2. \nAt least two issues proved problematic in moving to private ownership. These included \nconcerns regarding NBT\u2019s level of liquidity and the lack of appropriate banking regulations. The \nGovernment  initiated  the  development  of  a  financial  supervisory  act;  however,  this  was  not \ncompleted.1 Regardless of whether NBT is privatized, dealing with its monopoly position as the \ndominant  commercial  bank  in  Tuvalu  is  also  important.  The  high  historical  rates  of  return  on \ninvestment suggest this market power has already been exploited. \n \n3. \nNBT\u2019s  biggest  customer  is  the  Government,  which  has  accumulated  a  large  overdraft \nstemming  from  budget  support  coupled  with  a  considerable  debt  (A$3.796  million  at  30  June \n2008)  from  its  involvement  in  the  outer  islands  agency  suspense  account  (OIASA),  where \npersonal deposits made by people in the outer islands were remitted back into the consolidated \nrevenues instead of back to NBT in a period when the Government was acting as an agent for \nNBT in the outer islands.  \n \nThis, combined with a spate of poor quality lending to local businesses and households, \n4. \ncontributed  to  a  liquidity  crisis.  The  financial  statements  contained  in  the  2003  annual  report \nstates:  \u201cAs  at  31  December  2003,  the  Bank\u2019s  liquidity  position  had  been  severely  depleted \nresulting  in  material  uncertainty  as  to  whether  the  Bank  will  be  able  to  meet  its  obligations  to \ndepositors  and  discharge  its  short-term  liabilities  in  the  normal  course  of  business.\u201d2  The \nfinancial  statements  showed  the  alarming  growth  in  lending  and  drop  in  deposits,  offset  by  a \n90% reduction of term deposits with overseas banks during 2003. This trend continued until a \nchange  of  management  recognized  the  problem  and  took  steps  to  address  it.  Outstanding \nloans, at 93% of deposits as of October 2005, subsequently reached well in excess of 100%. As \na result NBT entered into very little new lending. \n \n5. \nFor  a  long  time  NBT  was  the  only  institution  in  Tuvalu  that  accepted  deposits  (the \nDevelopment Bank of Tuvalu [DBT] is now able to do so), offering a normal array of savings and \nchecking accounts, currency exchange, money transfers, and loans. For years, it was the only \nbusiness in the country that accepted credit cards (for cash advances), but in 2005 it stopped \nproviding  this  service.  This  has  caused  concern  in  the  tourist  industry  and  allied  businesses \ncatering to international travelers.  \n \n6. \nThe NBT loan portfolio is dominated by personal borrowing, with only about 30% lent for \nbusiness  purposes.  Only  a  few  well-established,  long-time  customers  are  still  receiving  new \nbusiness  credit;  all  others  are  referred  to  DBT.  Housing  loans\u2014previously  an  important \ncomponent of the business portfolio since most were for rental units\u2014have stopped completely. \n\n                                                 \n1   The reasons behind the draft FIA as prepared with PFTAC assistance never moving to the stage of parliamentary \ntabling  are  unknown.  All  the  key  players  (minister  and  secretary  of  finance,  attorney  general,  and  NBT  general \nmanager) have changed in the intervening period.  \n\n2   National Bank of Tuvalu. 2004.

This was done through a review of the general operating condition and performance \nof  the  NBT  and  the  adequacy  of  operating  policies  to  determine  what  factors,  if  any,  may  be \nhindering the performance of NBT or which may otherwise deter private sector investor interest \nin  NBT.  The  summary  report  is  presented  in  Box  A2,  with  a  detailed  report  having  been \nprovided to both NBT and the Government (as owner).  \n \n\nBox A2: Summary Report by Financial Sector Supervision Advisor, PFTAC \non the National Bank of Tuvalu \n\n \nOverall, the condition and performance of NBT appears to be generally satisfactory based on a \nreview of the 2006 audited financial statements and unaudited financial statements for the year \nending 31 December 2007 and for the 6 months to 30 June 2008. Capital is strong, despite the \nlack  of  accruals  for  income  taxes  on  the  profits  for  the  year  December  2007  and  for  the \n6 months  ending  30  June  2008  and  the  need  to  increase  provisions  for  bad  debts.  After \nadjusting  for  these  items,  the  bank\u2019s  leverage  capital  ratios  (total  capital  to  total  assets)  are \nestimated at 19.38% as of 31 December 2007 and 20.42% as of 30 June 2008. This high capital \nposition is, however, needed to support the bank\u2019s expanding and high-risk loan portfolio.  \n \nAsset quality is less than satisfactory with a high proportion of loans identified by the bank as \nbeing  nonperforming  (NPL).  The  bank\u2019s  identification  of  NPLs,  however,  is  believed  to  be \nunderstated. The bank defines a NPL as any loan past due 180 days or more while the more \ngenerally accepted practice is to recognize loans past due 90 days or more as NPL. The bank\u2019s \nmore  liberal  definition  of  NPL  also  raises  questions  as  the  quality  of  reported  earnings  and \nincome.  Management was unable to provide a complete aging of past loans due as of 30 June \n2008 to assess the volume and severity of NPLs. Weaknesses have also been identified in the \nbank\u2019s lending and loan grading policies. Earnings performance, as noted above, appears to be \noverstated  but  is  generally  satisfactory.  Improvement,  however,  is  needed  in  the  budgeting \nprocess. Earnings performance is, however, being hindered by several large interest-free loans \nto  government  (i.e.,  the  OIASA  and  long-standing  NPLs  to  Tuvalu  Media  Corporation  and  the \nNational  Fishing  Corporation).  Liquidity  is  satisfactory;  however,  improvement  is  needed  in \nplanning and management of liquid assets.  \n \nOperations of the bank are generally satisfactory and no major impediments, beyond resolution \nof the large volume of nonearning government borrowings and the need for a banking law, have \nbeen identified, which would discourage outside investor interest in the bank. Lending is guided \nby  a  written  lending  policy,  a  policy  for  categorizing  loans  by  risk  has  been  adopted  and \nmanagement  prepares  an  annual  earnings  budget.  Revisions  to  these  policies  are  needed  to \ncomply with international best practices and the adoption of a written liquidity policy is needed to \nbetter  manage  and  assure  the  maintenance  of  adequate  liquidity.  Resolution  of  the  large \nvolume  of  nonearning  government  borrowings  totaling  about  A$5  million  as  of  30  June  2008 \nwould likely be required if outside investors were to be attracted to the bank.  \n \nNBT = National Bank of Tuvalu, NPL = nonperforming loan, OIASA = outer Islands agency suspense account. \nSource: PFTAC. 2008.

Funafuti. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nPUBLIC FINANCE SECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nFiscal Stance \n\n \nA. \n \nGovernment expenditure is very high in Tuvalu; the ratio of expenditure and net lending \n1. \nto gross domestic product (GDP) ranged from 150% to 220% in 1999\u20132003 and is likely to have \nremained  close  to  100%  subsequently.  Hence,  government  expenditure  is  the  main  driver  of \neconomic activity, and the fiscal position is a critical dimension of economic management.  \n \n2. \nDuring 2000\u20132002, there was a surge in external revenue from fishing licenses and the \ninternational marketing of the .tv domain name. Grants and revenue from offshore investments \nheld in the Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) were also relatively high during the period. Revenue from \nthese sources then declined in 2003\u20132005, averaging A$9 million per annum compared with the \nannual  average  of  A$35  million  during  2000\u20132002.  These  earnings  have  not  increased \nsignificantly  since  then,  and  forward  projections  indicate  declining  offshore  earnings  through \n2010. \n \n3. \nExpenditure grew quickly as offshore revenue rose (Figure A3). Much  of the additional \nexpenditure was allocated to one-off items such as the sealing of the road network on Funafuti \n(2002), an outer islands electrification project (2000), and grants to the Falekaupule Trust Fund \nestablished to assist outer islands development. Some of the expanding expenditure items were \nrecurrent  in nature  or  incurred  some  level  of  recurrent  costs,  and  proved  difficult  to  reduce  as \nthe revenue position weakened. This resulted in considerable fiscal pressure. The value of the \nbudget was equivalent to 30% of GDP in 2003, 10% in 2004, and 20% in 2005.  \n \n\nFigure A3:  Expenditure and Revenue Balance \n\nEstimates\n\n9\n9\n9\n1\n\n0\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\n0\n0\n2\n\n2\n0\n0\n2\n\n3\n0\n0\n2\n\n4\n0\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\n6\n0\n0\n2\n\n7\n0\n0\n2\n\n8\n0\n0\n2\n\n9\n0\n0\n2\n\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n1\n1\n0\n2\n\nExpenditure and net lending\n\nBudget balance\n\n \n\nSource: Tuvalu Central Statistics Department, Government audited accounts and budget papers, various years. \n\n \nThe  large  deficits  quickly  drew  down  the  Government\u2019s  liquid  financial  reserves.  In  net \n4. \nterms,  liquid  financial  resources  stood  at  59%  of  GDP  at  the  end  of  2002,  but  they  were \nexhausted  by  the  end  of  2005.  The  downturn  in  revenue  resulted  in  very  tight  expenditure \nrestraints  and  the  compression  of  capital  expenditures,  particularly  on  maintenance  and  on \ngoods and services. Financial relief was provided over 2006 by strengthening in the Australian \ncapital  market.  This  allowed  a  A$12  million  distribution  from  the  Tuvalu  Trust  Fund  (TTF)  in \n2006  and  a  further  distribution  of  A$7  million  in  2007,  replenishing  the  Government\u2019s  cash \n\n \n\nA$ million\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n\fAppendix 3   \n\n35\n\nreserves  held  in  the  Consolidated  Investment  Fund  (CIF).1  The  budget  surplus  was \napproximately 32% of GDP in 2006; however, a deficit of A$1.04 million was recorded for 2007. \nTuvalu is projecting budget deficits for 2008 through 2011 (but the reliability of such projections \nis unclear, given the volatility in key revenue items). \n \n5. \nThe  Government  is  taking  steps  to  address  the  fiscal  situation,  and  is  committed  to  a \nprogram  of  fiscal  restraint.  This  is  most  clearly  demonstrated  by  its  adoption  of  a  set  of  five \nperformance benchmark indicators (PBIs), which was formulated by the Government, the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank,  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  and  the \nNew Zealand Agency for International Development (NZAID) to track achievement of the stated \nsocial  sector  outcomes  through  a  focus  on  improved  financial  management  and  fiscal \nconsolidation. The PBIs are as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nBenchmark 1.1. The Government\u2019s recurrent expenditure each year should not \nexceed the total of its recurrent revenue plus a sustainable TTF distribution (CIF \ndrawdown).  \nBenchmark 1.2. The target minimum  value of funds retained in the CIF should \nbe not less than 16% of the maintained value of the TTF at the beginning of the \nTTF  year  so  as  to  ensure  that  a  sustainable  distribution  is  available  to  help \nfinance annual budgets.  \nBenchmark  1.3.  The  Government\u2019s  total  debt  liability  (both  domestic  and \nexternal) at any time should not exceed 60% of GDP, as specified in Te Kakeega \nII. \nBenchmark  2.1.  In  2008,  the  Government  will  increase  its  budgeted  nonsalary \nexpenditure on basic education by at least 5%. \nBenchmark  2.2.  In  2008,  the  Government  will  increase  its  budgeted  nonsalary \nexpenditure on primary and preventive health services by at least 5%. \n\nRevenue Collection Systems \n\n \n6. \nFiscal  performance  against  the  PBIs  is  being  monitored  by  the  Government,  by  the \ninternational  aid  agencies. \nTuvalu  Trust  Fund  Advisory  Committee  (TTFAC),  and  by \nAssessment  in  April  2008  by  TTFAC  against  the  2007  budget  outturn  found  that  the \nGovernment  had  met  only  benchmarks  1.3,  2.1,  and  2.2,  although  TTFAC  noted  against \nbenchmark 1.2 that there was a marked improvement in the Government\u2019s efforts to achieve the \ntarget minimum balance. The performance against the PBIs is looked to by AusAID and NZAID \nas a basis to assess the Government\u2019s eligibility for incentive payments to support the recurrent \nbudget. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nThe key challenge facing the revenue system is the high degree of volatility in external \nrevenue. For 2000\u20132005, annual external revenue ranged from A$13 million to A$47 million. In \naddition to being volatile, the future year\u2019s revenue is difficult to forecast, and payment of one of \nthe single largest revenue items (viz., fishing licenses) is received very late in the financial year. \nExpenditure decisions are thus made in the face of considerable uncertainty as to how they will \nbe  funded.  The  length  and  depth  of  periods  of  low  revenue  are  difficult  to  forecast,  as  they \ndepend  on  a  range  of  factors  outside  Tuvalu\u2019s  control.  Also,  considerable  uncertainty  prevails \n                                                 \n1  The Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) provides budget support from its distribution over and above its maintained value, but \nfluctuates  with  the  performance  in  the  financial  markets  in  Australia.  The  existence  of  the  TTF  has  created  a \nfinancial  asset  for  current  and  future  generations,  provided  funding  for  the  budget  (at  around  10%  of  recurrent \nexpenditure  in  2007),  and  strengthened  external  perceptions  of  Tuvalu\u2019s  finances  and  governance  structure. \nHowever, it also has created some complacency in the Government budget planning and a certain level of moral \nhazard, particularly in years of good financial performance.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nwith respect to the volatility in the value of the US dollar, as fishing licenses and income from \nthe  domain  name  are  both  paid  in  that  currency.  These  factors  greatly  complicate  fiscal \nmanagement and have contributed to the emergence of fiscal difficulties. \n \nThe  most  immediate  issue  facing  the  internal  revenue  system  is  the  potential  loss  of \n8. \nrevenue  under  the  Pacific  Island  Countries  Trade  Agreement,  which  became  effective  in  May \n2008 following ratification in April 2008. Implementation of this by Tuvalu requires that duties on \nimports from other Pacific Island countries will be progressively reduced over a 10-year period. \nThe  current  import  duty  system  comprises  a  large  range  of  ad  valorem  and  specific  rates \napplied  to  free-on-board  values,  with  the  weighted  average  import  duty  estimated  at  15%  in \n2005.  The  main  concern  to  Tuvalu  is  the  potential  loss  of  revenue  on  imports  from  Fiji,  which \naccounted  for  14%  of  import  duty  or  A$0.36  million  in  2005.  As  import  duties  will  only  be \nreduced  progressively,  the  loss  of  revenue  will  tend  to  be  small  initially.  Relatively  simple \nrevenue  measures  have  been  identified  that  could  readily  correct  for  the  revenue  loss  in  the \nforeseeable future. \n \nNonetheless, more extensive import duty reforms are warranted. The intent is to reduce \n9. \nthe  reliance  on  import  duties  through  adoption  of  a  broad-based  consumption  tax,  with \nlegislation  to  be  approved  in  November  2008.  There  are  also  grounds  for  raising  charges  for \nelectricity, telecommunications, and shipping. Cost recovery initiatives could also be justified for \nmedical  and  education  services,  notably  for  overseas  scholarships  (with  support  provided  for \nthe disadvantaged), to better spread the benefits of these services through the community. \n \n10. \nRevisions  to  the  charges  of  government  businesses  would  be  most  helpful  if \naccompanied  by  reforms  in  the  management  regime,  such  as  the  establishment  of  service \noperating  agreements  for  public  enterprises  and  revisions  to  their  board  structures.  While \nelements of such reforms have been considered, there has been no progress in implementation. \nThere  has  been  a  substantial  investment  in  infrastructure  recently,  but  the  potential  gains  are \nimpaired  by  operating  inefficiencies,  including  shortfalls  in  funding  operating  costs  and  the \nhigher maintenance now required.  \n \nC. \n \n11. \nHigh  staff  costs  are  a  key  source  of  fiscal  pressure  for  the  medium  term.  They  now \naccount  for  40%  of  on-budget  expenditure,  well  up  from  the  24%  share  of  1996.  In  1994,  the \npublic sector reform program became a core component of the national plan, and a civil service \ndownsizing  was  proposed.  But  by  2005,  the  number  of  established  posts  had  grown  by  37% \nabove  the  1994  level,  although  the  population  had  grown  by  less  than  10%.  Average  rates  of \npay also increased substantially during the period. A recent wage restraint has been lifted with a \nwage  rise  for  public  employees  included  in  the  FY2009  budget  considered  by  Parliament  in \nNovember 2008. Staff costs have risen to such high levels that they are now an ongoing source \nof fiscal pressure and compression of nonstaff expenditure.  \n \n12. \nThe  national  development  plan,  Te  Kakeega  II,  identifies  the  expenditure  priorities  as \nbasic education and health care and vocational education. These items receive a very low share \nof the budget and are largely supported through external inputs. Shifting funds to these priorities \nrequires  making  savings  by  stopping  or  cutting  back  some  activities.  Candidates  for  savings \ninclude  overseas  scholarships  (at  7.2%  of  2004  on-budget  expenditure),  travel  expenses \n(2.7%),  and  subsidies  to  government  businesses.  Public  expenditure  could  also  be  improved \nthrough the adoption of a targeted approach to meeting the needs of the disadvantaged rather \nthan the current broad-brush approach. \n\nPublic Expenditure Program \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3   \n\n37\n\nD. \n\nPublic Financial Management System and Budgeting \n\n13. \nDespite improvements in the quality of financial management, the fiscal position remains \ndifficult  to  track.  Changes  in  the  net  cash  position  (which  equals  the  fiscal  balance)  are  not \nreported  publicly  and  are  obscured  by  the  Government\u2019s  use  of  multiple  sources  of  cash. \nGaining  a  clear  interpretation  of  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  management  is  complicated  by  the \npresence  of  a  range  of  estimates  of  expenditure  and  revenue  and  the  budget  balance.  The \nbudget papers themselves present more than one estimate of some of the key aggregates (e.g., \nrecurrent  expenditure,  the  wage  and  salary  bill),  and  historical  data  presented  in  the  budget \npapers differ significantly from that presented in the audited accounts. This situation appears to \nbe  a  reflection  of  the  use  of  multiple  accounting  systems  to  prepare  the  budget  as  well  as  a \ngeneral  weakness  in  the  accounting  systems.  A  recent  review  further  identified  significant \nweaknesses  in  public  financial  management  including  the  lack  of  a  medium-term  fiscal \nframework (MTFF).2 Issues identified in this review have been built into the technical assistance \n(TA) components. \n \nPublic sector record keeping has generally been in a poor state. Information on the debt \n14. \nposition of the public sector and the value of investment and performance of the offshore assets \nare  generally  not  disclosed  to  the  public.  The  extent  of  government  guarantees  is  difficult  to \ndetermine, even though the policy is for such guarantees to receive parliamentary approval. The \nrecent rundown (now corrected) in the Government\u2019s net cash holdings is still poorly understood \nwithin and outside the Government despite its seriousness.  \n \n15. \nAccountability  and  transparency  are  impaired  by  the  limited  information  available  on \ngovernment  operations  and  mechanisms  for  civil  society  to  engage  in  government  decision \nmaking. The main source of information on the Government\u2019s operations is the budget papers. \nThese  papers  identify  the  activities  of  the  main  sections  within  each  ministry,  performance \nindicators, and expenditure by item and revenue. However, there are inconsistencies within the \nbudget papers, and performance measures are often unrealistic. \n \n16. \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  setting  the  economy  and  fiscal  position  right,  and \nimprovement  in  public  expenditure  and  financial  management  are  accorded  highest  priority. \nReforms are been guided by Te Kakeega II. The strength of the plan is its highly participatory \nformulation. A key weakness is its ambitious scope and lack of prioritization.  \n \nE. \n \n17. \nThe  gross  value  of  public  debt  was  estimated  as  A$24  million  as  of  the  end  of  2005. \nTaking  into  account  the  Government\u2019s  cash  holdings,  the  net  debt  was  estimated  at  72%  of \nGDP,  or  45%  of  GDP  in  net  present  value  terms.  Such  debt  levels  were  substantially  above \ndesirable levels. Yet the improvement in returns from the Tuvalu Trust Fund meant that by the \nend  of  2006  gross  debt  stood  at  A$21  million  (about  70%  of  GDP),  net  debt  stood  at \nA$10 million  (35%),  and  the  net  present  value  of  net  debt  was  about  A$3  million  (11%). \n\nDebt Sustainability \n\n                                                 \n2  The National Bank of Tuvalu (NBT) in 2004 appointed the Falekaupule (local council) treasurer as official agent \nfor the bank to receive deposits and lend money. All transactions were recorded daily and sent by facsimile to the \nbank. The treasurer was allowed a maximum cash holding, and any excess was to be transported back to NBT \nand  deposited  into  the  individual  accounts.  It  appears  that  the  money  was  instead  deposited  into  the \nGovernment\u2019s  general  account,  and  NBT  instead  recorded  the  outstanding  amount  as  a  government  overdraft. \nHowever, the Government had stipulated that this overdraft would be non-interest bearing, but with an overdraft at \nits peak of around A$5.024 million at the end of 2006, NBT has foregone income of approximately A$500,000 per \nyear.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nEstimates by TTFAC using 2007 data indicated that at year end-2007, the Government\u2019s gross \ndebt was equivalent to 51.6% of estimated GDP.  \n \n18. \nThe Government has a considerable domestic debt owed to the National Bank of Tuvalu \n(NBT). This is from the outer islands agency suspense account overdraft (A$3.796 million as of \n30 September 2008), a guaranteed loan for the refurbishment of two longline fishing vessels to \nthe government-owned National Fisheries Corporation (NAFICOT) (A$1.23 million as at 30 June \n2008),  and  debt  incurred  by  the  recently  decorporatized  Tuvalu  Media  Corporation  (TMC) \n($121,500 as at 30 June 2008). These loans, and the Government\u2019s failure to make repayments \non them, are hindering the earnings performance of NBT.  \n \n19. \nIn  considering  Tuvalu\u2019s  debt  sustainability,  it  is  important  to  recognize  country-specific \nfactors.  One  is  the  presence  of  the  TTF,  the  maintained  value  of  which  was  calculated  to  be \nA$103,907,772 as of 31 March 2008. The TTF is held in trust and is not directly owned by or \nunder  the  control  of  the  Government;  thus it  is  not  recorded  as  an  asset  when  calculating the \nlevel of government net debt.  \n \n20. \nA  second  country-specific  factor  is  that  about  A$5  million  of  the  external  debt  has  not \nbeen  spent.  It  has  instead  been  held  in  the  Falekaupule  Trust  Fund\u2014a  trust  fund  that  also \nincludes  contributions  from  local  communities  to  provide  a  long-term  funding  source  for  outer \nislands development. The market value of the Falekaupule Trust Fund stood at A$24.7 million \nas of 31 March 2007. All funds are invested offshore. \n \n21. \nThe third and most important country-specific factor is the very high volatility in revenue. \nTuvalu has allowed the trend level of expenditure and net lending to rise above the trend level of \nrevenue  and  grants.  This  has  given  rise  to  an  underlying  budget  deficit.  This  is  a  trend \nprojection,  not  the  immediate  position.  Tuvalu  will  probably  be  free  of  fiscal  difficulties  in \nfavorable years\u2014that is, when offshore revenue is relatively high. This was the case over 2006 \nand 2007 and is likely to remain the case as long as Australian capital markets remain strong. \nBut based on past experience, the trend will be for fiscal problems to reemerge in the absence \nof substantial correction of the underlying fiscal pressures.  \n \nFinancial buffers need to be built up in good years so they can be used in poor years. \n22. \nThe  financial  buffers  are  the  Government\u2019s  holdings  of  liquid  assets  in  the  Consolidated \nInvestment Fund (CIF) and the cash deposits in bank accounts. Action is required on both the \nexpenditure and revenue side of the budget to build these buffers, and some progress has been \nmade.  The  Government  also  utilizes  an  overdraft  facility  with  NBT  for  its  cash  management \nneeds, so as to have access to cash throughout the year, since earnings occur predominantly \nlate in the financial year. This practice results in NBT being exposed to large and unexpected \nwithdrawals by the Government.  \n \n23.  While the Government is aware of the problems\u2013\u2013but to a lesser degree how they have \noccurred\u2013\u2013concerns still remain that there is some potential for the Government to again run up \nfurther debt.3 An integrated and operational MTFF will limit this possibility, but decision-making \nprocesses themselves must be reviewed so that implications of decisions, especially regarding \ndebt, are clear before a decision is made.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n3   Though debt cannot be incurred again through the OIASA. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3   \n\n39\n\nPublic Finance and Public Corporations \n\nF. \n \n24. \nThe  Government  of  Tuvalu  currently  owns  11  public  corporations  (their  details  and \nperformance  status  are  outlined  in  Table  A3.1),  each  operating  under  individual  enabling \nlegislation: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(TNPF), \n\nNBT, established as the sole commercial bank; \nDevelopment Bank of Tuvalu (DBT), to provide concessional finance to business; \nTuvalu  National  Provident  Fund \nthe  country\u2019s  compulsory \nsuperannuation scheme; \nNAFICOT, to develop export and local sales of fish by Tuvaluans; \nTuvalu  Electricity  Corporation  (TEC),  to  provide  electrical  power  on  all  of  the \nisland groups; it is illegal to compete with TEC; \nTuvalu  Telecommunications  Corporation  (TTC),  which  provides  phone,  mobile \nphone,  internet,  and  other  telecommunications  services  on  Funafuti  and,  to  a \nlesser  extent,  the  outer  islands;  it  is  illegal  to  compete  with  TTC  without  its \nconsent; \nTuvalu Maritime Training Institute (TMTI), to train seafarers; \n\n(vii) \n(viii)  Tuvalu  Philatelic  Bureau,  to  produce  and  sell  stamps  for  mailing  and  for \n\n(ix) \n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\ncollectors; \nVaiaku Lagi Hotel (VLH), to run a hotel, restaurant ,and bar on Funafuti;  \nCopra Trading Corporation, to purchase and export copra produced domestically; \nand \nTMC,  to  operate  the  only  radio  station;  competition  is  permitted  but  unlikely \nowing to the small size of the economy.4 \n\n \n25. \nThe  Government  does  not  have  an  overall  policy  for  public  corporations  that  (i)  clearly \ndefines  their  purpose  and  objectives,  (ii)  sets  agreed-upon  levels  of  service  operation  and \nperformance targets, (iii) provides the mechanism for agreement on the necessary funding for \nits  community  service  obligations,  and  (iv)  sets  out  clear  accountability  for  operational  and \nfinancial matters. Instead, corporations each operate under their individual enabling legislation, \nwithout cohesion, and government involvement is dispersed across a number of ministries. The \nGovernment  had  assumed  that,  once  corporatized,  the  enterprises  could  be  left  to  their  own \ndevices and would operate profitably. This has not proved to be the case. The lack of a clear \npolicy is a fundamental weakness in government management of its enterprises. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n4   TMC was decorporatized in 2007 and is now part of the Ministry of Communications and Transport. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nTable A3: Status of Tuvalu\u2019s Corporations \n\nCorporation \nNational Bank of \nTuvalu \nDevelopment Bank of \nTuvalu \nTuvalu National \nProvident Fund \nTuvalu Electricity \nCorporation \n\nEnabling \nLegislation \n(year) \n1982 \n\n1990 \n\n1984 \n\n1990 \n\nAcronym \nNBT \n\nDBT \n\nTNPF \n\nTEC \n\nChair \n\nSecretary, MFEP \n\nGovernment \nAccountant, MFEP \nDirector of Planning, \nMFEP \nSecretary, Ministry of \nPublic Works and \nUtilities \nSecretary, Ministry of \nCommerce \n\nLatest \nAudit \nYear \n2006 \n\n2006 \nProfit \n($\u2019000) \n410 \n\nNumber \nEmployed \n(2005) \n42 \n\n2006 \n\n(153) \n\n2006 \n\n245 \n\n2006 \n\n(777) \n\n19 \n\n11 \n\n86 \n\n4 \n\n1 \n\n\u2013 \n\n64 \n\nTPB \n\nTCT \n\nTTC \n\n2006 \n\n2006 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2002 \n\n(536) \n\n(22.9) \n\n(65.9) \n\n35 \n\u2013 \n\n(223.4) \n\nNAFICOT \n\n1988 \n2000 \n\n2006 \n2000 \n\n(889) \n(39) \n\nVLH \nTMTI \n\nWorks and Utilities \n\nNot given  MFEP \n\nNot given  Ministry of Public \n\nNot given  Ministry of Natural \n\nResources \nMFEP \nMinistry of Education \n\nTuvalu \nTelecommunications \nCorporation \nNational Fishing \nCorporation \nVaiaku Lagi Hotel \nTuvalu Maritime \nTraining Institute \nTuvalu Philatelic \nBureau \nTuvalu Copra Trading \nCorporation \nMFEP = Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning. \nSource: Office of the Auditor General. 2008. Report of the Auditor General 2006. Funafuti. \n \nThe Report of the Auditor General 2006 (released in June 2008) indicated a high level of \n26. \ndebt across all enterprises.3 Several of the enterprises were operating on overdraft, several had \nquestionable financial sustainability, and most did not prepare their own accounts\u2013\u2013hence, the \nactual financial situation was likely not known until the enterprise received an audit report. The \ncorporations  have  budgets,  but  do  not  have  business  plans.  ADB-funded  TA  revealed  that \navailable funding is often inadequate to support the planned level of operations of these public \nenterprises.5 Continuation of the current approach will lead to corporations becoming insolvent \nand reliant upon growing subsidies and guarantees from the Government.  \n \n27. \nA number of government businesses are also embedded in individual ministries and are \nnot  producing  financial  and  management  reports  to  assess  their  revenue-earning  potential. \nThese additional businesses include the main port, stevedoring operations, a travel agency, two \ninterisland  vessels,  housing,  repair  shops,  outer  islands  fisheries  centers,  and  an  internet \nfacility. The Government is also a (minority) shareholder in Air Fiji. \n \n28. \nsense.  \n \n29. \nNBT\u2019s  pretax  rate  of  return  on  assets  was  13.2%  in  2005  and  27.1%  in  2006,  with  an \nestimate of 41.3% for 2007. NBT\u2019s high profits are suggestive of market domination as well as \ngood management. However, the lack of a financial institutions act in Tuvalu means regulatory \noversight is nonexistent.  \n \n\nOf  the  public  enterprises,  only  NBT  and  TNPF  are  profitable  in  a  normal  commercial \n\n                                                 \n3   Office of the Auditor General. 2008.

An assessment by the \n\n30. \nPacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (Appendix 2) notes that \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\noverall  the  condition  and  performance  of  NBT  appears  to  be  generally \nsatisfactory; \ncapital  is  strong,  but  a  high  capital  position  is  required  to  support  NBT\u2019s \nexpanding and high-risk loan portfolio; \nasset quality is less than satisfactory, with nonperforming loans over 10% of total \nloans; \nearnings  performance  appears  to  be  overstated  but  is  generally  satisfactory, \nalthough hindered by the high level of nonperforming loans and by large interest-\nfree loans to the Government; and \noperations of NBT are generally satisfactory, and no major impediments, beyond \nresolution  of  the  large  volume  of  non-earning  government  assets  and  the  need \nfor a bank law, were identified that would discourage outside investor interest in \nNBT.  \n\n \nTNPF  holds  most  of  its  funds  offshore,  an  investment  strategy  that  has  underpinned \n31. \ngood  commercial  performance  over  time.  TNPF  has  entered  into  lending  operations,  allowing \nmembers to borrow against their contributions. The implications of this for performance, and for \nsustained  operations  as  an  effective  provider  of  superannuation  benefits,  are  substantial  but \nhave not been widely considered.  \n \n32. \nDBT, NAFICOT, TEC, and TTC have each accumulated losses of more than A$1 million. \nDBT  has  at  times  reported  a  profit,  but  typically  operates  at  a  loss  and  was  required  to  write \ndown more than A$1 million in bad debts in 2003. NAFICOT has faced commercial difficulties \nsince  its  inception,  and  the  Government  is  now  servicing  a  A$1  million  loan  secured  by \nNAFICOT in 2003 to purchase fishing vessels.  \n \nThe setting of tariffs by cabinet at a level below cost and partial payment of bills by the \n33. \nGovernment  are  key  factors  behind  the  poor  financial  performance  of  TEC  and  TTC.  Debts \nowed by the Government to TTC had accumulated over a number of  years, and in 2007 TTC \naccepted A$1.2 million from the Government as full and final payment. Payments owed to TEC \nby  the  Government  were  estimated  to  stand  at  A$0.4  million  in  2006,  while  a  payment  of \nA$0.1 million toward this was made in 2007.6 TTC moved to a prepaid service system in 2004 \nbut  subsequently  moved  away  from  it.  TEC  is  also  considering  a  system  of  prepayment, \nalthough it holds concerns about the high upfront capital cost of such a move.  \n \n34. \nTMTI  does  not  charge  trainees  for  its  service,  and  TMC  has  few  of  its  own  revenue \nsources.  Both  TMTI  and  TMC  are  reliant  on  government  subsidies  to  meet  day-to-day \nexpenses.  The  Tuvalu  Philatelic  Bureau  now  only  operates  on  a  small  scale.  VLH  has  been \nunprofitable over a considerable period, although recently there have been adjustments to the \npricing  structure  and  staffing  that  may  flow  through  to  improved  financial  performance.  There \nhave  also  been  periodic  discussions  of  moving  to  a  management  contract  for  VLH;  however, \nissues  of  preservation  of  jobs  and  government  maintenance  of  the  assets  have  proved \nproblematic, and no framework has been developed for the introduction of such a scheme.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n6   2006 is the most recent year for which audited accounts of TEC are available. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nTe Kakeega II identified a number of priorities to improve public enterprise management, \n\n35. \nall of which are still to be implemented: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nStrengthen management and staff. \nProduce annual reports and audited accounts in accordance with legislation, with \nboth available to the public. \nClearly define, cost out, and better target government subsidies. \nAssess the viability of privatizing selected public enterprises. \nImprove  the  selection  process  of  boards  of  directors  of  public  enterprises  and \nbroaden membership. \nEstablish  clear  guidelines  on  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  ministers,  boards, \nand management of public enterprises.  \n\nIn the absence of a strategic plan and operational policies that encompass all enterprises, these \nindividual interventions will have little impact. \n \n36. \nThe benefits of strengthened public enterprise performance in terms of achievement of \nthe  fiscal  PBIs  are  clear.  Improving  the  performance  of  public  enterprises  would  reduce  their \nfinancial  call  on  the  Government  and  so  reduce  recurrent  expenditure  and/or  allow  the \nredirection  of  this  expenditure  to  basic  health  and  education  priority  areas.  Reduced  financial \ndemands  by  public  enterprises  would  reduce  the  need  to  draw  down  from  the  CIF.  Improving \nthe  performance  of  corporations  would  also  reduce  the  debt  risk  to  the  Government  of  the \nguarantees  it  has  provided  for  public  enterprises  as  well  as  requests  to  the  Government  for \nsubsidies to continue service provision. \n \n37. \nHowever,  improved  enterprise  performance  is contingent  upon  the  Government  putting \ninto  place  overarching  policies  and  regulatory  mechanisms\u2014the  lack  of  which  has  led  to \nconsistent underperformance. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n43 \n\nPROBLEM AND CONSTRAINTS ANALYSIS \n\n \n1. \nTuvalu  faces  difficulties  in  fiscal  management\u2013\u2013both  through  external  factors  such  as \nhigh external debt and volatility of external revenue and through internal issues such as weak \nmanagement  and  planning  procedures  and  controls.  Internal  factors  include  the  large  and \nincreasing size of the public sector, and placing an extreme drain on financial resources\u2014which \nis not commensurate with performance, tariffs, service quality, or overall revenue from its public \nsector workforce.   \n \n2. \nAs fiscal management is weak, it is difficult for the Government to accurately determine \nits  financial  position,  and  there  are  inconsistencies  between  budget  papers  and  audited \naccounts.  Record  keeping  is  poor  both  within  the  Government  and  as  supplied  by  public \nenterprises.  The  Government  does  not  use  a  medium-term  fiscal  framework  (MTFF)  for \nplanning and monitoring expenditures, and decisions are often unrelated to its current financial \nposition.  This  is  particularly  the  case  with  regard  to  the  provision  of  subsidies  for \nunderperforming enterprises or those with cash flow problems. \n \n3. \nThe  private  sector  is  very  weak,  and  there  are  limited  opportunities  for  growth  without \noversaturation.  The  Government  manages  business-like  operations  that  could  be  tendered  or \ntaken up by the private sector under management contracts, but this has not yet occurred. \n \n4. \nOnly  2  of  the  11  public  corporations  are  operating  profitably.  There  is  no  overarching \nlegislation that defines the obligations of the corporations, and many do not prepare corporate \nplans or state performance targets. Many do not submit annual reports, and some corporations \nhave not been audited for several years due to lack of financial records.  \n \n5. \nThe economy is fragile and highly dependent on external assistance as well as on trust \nfunds.  Options  for  improving  the  internal  revenue  base  have  been  identified  but  not  yet  fully \nimplemented. These include tax reforms, tariff reviews, and mechanisms to improve enterprise \nperformance and profitability.   \n \n6. \nby Tuvalu are considered below. \n \nA. \n \nWhile Tuvalu has had stable government for some years now, the political will for long-\n7. \nterm commitment to reforms has been unclear. The policy intent set down in Te Kakeega II has \nnot  been  followed  through  with  key  elements  such  as  development  of  a  MTFF,  and  public \nenterprise reform is still outstanding. Steps had been taken toward at least partial privatization \nof the National Bank of Tuvalu and at looking at private sector involvement in the Vaiaku Lagi \nHotel,  but  this  had  not  been  followed  through  to  completion.  At  the  same  time,  an  opposing \nmessage  was  sent  regarding  the Government\u2019s  policy  stance  through  decorporatization  of  the \nTuvalu Media Corporation.  \n \nB. \n \n8. \nThe Government\u2019s ability to manage fiscal pressures and promote fiscal sustainability is \nfiscal \nconstrained  by \nmanagement  tools  and  disciplines,  including  utilization  of  a  MTFF.  This  hampers  effective \npriority setting and budget control.  \n\nThe key constraints to addressing the broad problem of fiscal sustainability being faced \n\ninstitutional  environment.  The  Government \n\nInstitutional Constraints \n\nPolitical Constraints \n\nlacks  many  key \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nOrganizational Constraints \n\nSocial and Cultural Constraints \n\nThe  legislative  environment,  which  guides  government  actions,  is  also  lacking  is  some \n9. \nkey aspects. There is no overarching legal framework to guide public corporations. Nor is there \nan  act  to  allow  for  the  oversight  of  financial  institutions  to  ensure  that  they  meet  international \nstandards.   \n \n10. \nThe  policy  environment  is  a  further  constraint.  There  are  no  policies  on  government \nownership and divestment despite there having been a range of decisions entered into in these \nareas. The lack of a policy means there is no guiding principle behind decisions, and decisions \ncan even be conflicting or counterproductive.  \n \nC. \n \nKey oversight organizations, such as the offices of the attorney general and the auditor \n11. \ngeneral,  have  failed  to  take  an  assertive  approach  to  institutional  issues.  There  has  been  no \neffort  to  address  the  lack  of  overarching  policies  that  could  be  applied  uniformly,  especially  to \n(i) enterprise  reporting  and  performance,  (ii)  wages  and  staffing  of  enterprises,  (iii)  banking \npractices, (iv) ownership, and (v) divestment. \n \nD. \n \nTuvalu has a very strong community outlook. This has a number of positive impacts in \n12. \nterms of welfare, but some negative ones that impact on the level of public sector performance \nas  well  as  the  development  of  the  private  sector  in  particular.  In  such  a  community-focused \nsociety,  it  is  difficult  for  competent  individuals  to  stand  out,  as  resources  and  earnings  are \nconsidered the property of the extended family. Because there is no individual reward for effort, \nthe  incentives  for  individual  performance  are  not  present.  Further,  law  enforcement  and \nenforcement of tariffs and bills are difficult due to the constraints imposed by family structures \nand personal relationships.  \n \n13. \nTuvalu is still relatively new to the cash economy, and much of the population remains \nsubsistence-based. Subsistence lifestyle tends to promote a relatively short-term outlook; long-\nterm planning and intergenerational planning concepts, such as wealth creation, are not easily \nassimilated. Monetary trade can sometimes be inconsistent with traditional values and systems. \nThe  interplay  between  traditional  systems  and  market  forces  can  result  in  second-best \noutcomes. \n \nThe Government, or the public sector, is the driver of Tuvalu\u2019s domestic economy and as \n14. \nsuch  is  seen  as  the  provider,  considered  to  have  infinite  capacity  to  generate  and  disperse \nfunds. As the population grows and their needs become more sophisticated, the fiscal pressure \ngenerated by growing government expenditure cannot be sustained.   \n \nE. \n \n15. \nThe  constraints  described  above  directly  impact  on  the  provision  of  public  services. \nThere  are  no  mechanisms  in  place  to  monitor  enterprise  performance  and  quality  of  service \ndelivery. There is no link between performance and remuneration. There are no consequences \nfor  general  managers  or  boards \nfor  underperformance  and  nonprofitability  of  public \ncorporations.  Government  responsibility  for  public  corporations  is  shared  by  control  being \ndispersed across various ministries, without a policy framework or tradition of enforcement. \n \n\nImplications of Constraints \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n45\n\nThe  constraints  also  affect  the  management  of  public  enterprises.  The  Government  is \n16. \nholding  down  prices  for  electricity,  telecommunications,  and  shipping  below  cost.  The  Tuvalu \nMaritime  Training  Institute  does  not  charge  individuals  for  training  and  is  reliant  on  external \nassistance  for  service  provision.  The  Government  has  run  up  substantial  debts  to  public \ncorporations, and there have been limited attempts to redress this situation. There has been no \nidentification  of  community  service  obligations  and  cost  apportionment.  Under \nthese \ncircumstances, sound financial management of public corporations is hampered. \n \nFrom  a  wider  development  perspective,  the  poor  fiscal  management  of  Tuvalu,  in \n17. \ncombination  with  the  poor  performance  of  public  corporations,  has  contributed  to  the  lack  of \nopportunities  for  real  private  sector  development  other  than  through  private  management  of \ngovernment businesses.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n1. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved technical assistance (TA) to Tuvalu \nfor Capacity Development for Public Financial Management.1 The intended impact of the TA is \nsustained  economic  growth  and  fiscal  stability,  as  prioritized  in  Tuvalu\u2019s  national  plan,  Te \nKakeega  II.  The  expected  outcome  is  improved  government  fiscal  planning  and  management \ncapacity.  The  achievement  of  the  expected  outcome  will  be  reflected  in  the  Government\u2019s \ncapacity  to  achieve  the  policy,  legislative,  and  institutional  changes  to  which  it  has  committed \nunder  the  proposed  grant  for  the  Improved  Financial  Management  Program.  The  TA  will  go \nfurther by improving the management of finances and government enterprises while considering \nissues of strategy and ownership.  \n \nA. \n \nThe TA will develop a medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) and create the policy and \n2. \nlegislative  environment \nIt  will \nsimultaneously  work  with  enterprises  to  put  in  place  management  and  planning  tools  to  help \nthem understand and improve their performance and enable the Government and its enterprises \nto  monitor  and  manage  performance.  The  TA  will  provide  capacity  development  and  support \nthrough four components: \n \n\nthe  performance  of  public  enterprises. \n\nMethodology and Key Activities \n\nimproving \n\nfor \n\nComponent 1: Management Services  \n\n1. \n \n3. \nThe TA will be supported by augmented management services from the consultant firm, \nwhich will provide ongoing management, liaison, and mentoring, as well as the coordination of \ninputs,  to  ensure  that  inputs  are  directed  toward  the  agreed  upon  objectives  rather  than \nfragmented.  The  expected  output  will  be  effective  capacity  development  and  management  of \npublic enterprise reforms.  \n \n4. \nThe main activities will be to (i) support the establishment of a mechanism through which \nthe Government can better manage enterprise monitoring, including a steering committee and a \npublic  enterprise  unit;  (ii)  develop  an  overall  strategy  and  implementation  plan  for  the  TA; \n(iii) coordinate  all  TA  inputs,  including  coordination  with  other  development  partner-funded \nactivities;  (iv)  help  the  Government  review  lessons  in  enterprise  ownership  and  management, \nand \ntheir  application;  (v) promote  positive  and  productive  relationships  with \ngovernment, enterprises, development partners, and ADB; and (vi) provide quarterly and annual \nmonitoring of TA progress and associated reporting. \n \n\nfacilitate \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Strengthening Fiscal and Enterprise Management \n\n \nThis  component  will  provide  stronger  and  more  coherent  oversight  of  fiscal  and  public \n5. \nenterprise performance. The main activities will be to (i) help Ministry of Finance and Economic \nPlanning  (MFEP)  develop  and  implement  an  MTFF;  (ii)  provide  training  for  staff  of  the  public \nenterprise  unit  on  its  role;  (iii)  develop  and  implement  a  strategic  policy  on  public  enterprise \ngovernance reform, outlining the Government\u2019s position on enterprise ownership and options for \ndivestment;  (iv) prepare  the  public  corporations  act  as  overarching  legislation  that  sets  out \n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2008.

The  Government  of  Tuvalu  will  finance  $125,000 \nequivalent  by  providing  office  space  and  facilities,  legal  services,  counterpart  staff,  support \nservices, and office supplies.  \n \nC. \n \n9. \nMFEP  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  and  will,  with  TA  support,  establish  a  public \nenterprise unit comprising two professional staff and a secretary. This unit will be the focal point \nfor  the  TA  and  will  remain  as  the  interface  between  enterprises  and  the  Government  after  TA \ncompletion.  The  secretary  for  finance  will  provide  guidance  for  TA  implementation  with  the \nsupport of a steering committee comprising government representatives.  \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nThe TA will finance 25.5 person-months of intermittent international consulting services \n10. \nand  8  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  ADB  will  recruit  a  firm  based  on  a \nsimplified  technical  proposal  under  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  process,  using  an \n80:20 weighting for quality and cost. The consultant team will have a (i) team leader and advisor \non  institutional  strengthening  and  public  enterprise  development  (international,  12  person-\nmonths),  (ii)  specialist  in  developing  public  financial  management  capacity  (international, \n2.5 person-months), (iii) public financial management advisor (international, 8 person-months), \n(iv)  planning  and  human  resource  development  advisor  (international,  3  person-months),  and \n(v) project  facilitator  (national,  8  person-months).  International  advisors  will  be  very  senior \ntechnical  specialists  in  their  field,  with  extensive  experience  in  small  island  states,  as  well  as \nskilled trainers committed to capacity building.  \n \nTA  implementation  will  be  supported  with  augmented  management  services  from  a \n11. \nproject  manager  working  approximately  3  person-months  and  provided  by  the  firm  for  a  lump \nsum.  The  management  and  administrative  input  of  the  project  manager  will  be  provided \nintermittently but according to an agreed upon plan throughout TA implementation. The project \nmanager will be responsible for developing the detailed terms of reference for the advisors and \nthe national consultant. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nThe  TA  will  be  implemented  intermittently  over  38  months  starting  in  December  2008 \n12. \nand ending in December 2011. TA implementation will commence with a diagnostic analysis of \nMFEP  capacity.  The  implementation  of  remaining  activities  will  commence  with  an  inception \nreport prepared for ADB and the Government by the team leader within 4 weeks of the start of \nfield activities, which will include an overall work plan for the full period and a detailed work plan \nfor the first year. Brief quarterly progress reports will be prepared in consultation with the public \nenterprise unit and provided to ADB. Semiannual progress reports will be submitted throughout \nthe  TA,  and  a  draft  final  report  will  be  submitted  by  30  October  2011.  The  final  report  will  be \nsubmitted within a month of the incorporation of ADB and Government comments on the draft \nfinal  report.  The  outcomes  of  the  diagnostic  analysis  will  be  the  subject  of  a  separate  report. \nADB will help the Government share all reports with other development partners.  \n \n\n \n\n\fDEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER AND POLICY MATRIX \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n49\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n51\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \nFocus of the \nReforms \n\nTable A6: Policy Matrix for Improved Financial Management Program \n\nPolicy Actions to be Taken Prior to First \nTranche Release December 2008 \n\nPolicy Actions to be Taken Prior to \nSecond Tranche Release November \n2009 \n\nPolicy Actions to be Taken Prior to Program \nEnd ,i.e., by 30 March 2010 (Non-tranche policy \nactions) \n\nAchieving Performance Benchmark Indicator 1.3: In 2009, Government\u2019s Total Debt Liability (both domestic and external) at any time should not exceed 60% of \nGDP, as specified in Te Kakeega II. \nOutput 1: \nImproved Public \nDebt \nManagement \nCapacity \n\n \n\n \n\n1.1  Parliament  to  pass  taxation  reform \nlegislation  (an  income  tax  act  amendment, \na  customs  act  amendment,  and  a \nconsumption tax bill). \n(MFEP  to  provide  copy  of  the  enacted \nlegislation) \n \n1.2 Cabinet to approve the development of \na  Debt  Risk  Management  and  Mitigation \nPolicy and Strategy, which shall include: \n(i)  the  processes  and  responsibilities  for \nthe  analysis  and  approval  of  proposed \nnew guarantees and debt;

\n\nCountry and Project Title:  Tuvalu Improved Financial Management Program \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n \n\n \n\nProgram Grant \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n \n\nPacific Department/Pacific \nSubregional Office \n\n \n\nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describe how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of \nthe partner country. \n \nTuvalu has experienced poor economic growth over the last 5 years. Real gross domestic product grew at only around \n2%\u20133% per annum. Economic growth is mainly driven by offshore earnings, public sector expenditure, and construction. \nBroadening of economic activity and private sector development are key strategies for improving economic growth rates \nand reducing poverty.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s Te Kakeega II 2004\u20132010 lays the foundation for sustainable and broad-based economic growth \nsupported by continued reforms and private sector development to improve the quality of life for all people in Tuvalu. In the \nmicro-sized economy of Tuvalu, poor expenditure allocation decisions have significant opportunity costs. For this reason, \neffective fiscal management will make the greatest contribution to meeting Government priorities and is the focus of the \nCPS. Poor people are disproportionately affected by shifts in government expenditure and also by poor reliability and \nquality of utility services (power, water), and by inefficiencies in public utilities \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:   General intervention \n\n1.  Key Issues  \nDuring implementation of the public enterprise governance reform strategic policy included in the policy matrix poverty \nanalysis will be required in relation to changes made to public service providing public corporations and government \nbusiness enterprises\u2014these may include providers of power, water, telecommunications and banking services. This \nshould include both analysis of impact of any changes (including in tariffs and service quality) on current clients and also \non potential clients where access to services is increased. This analysis should inform the design of community service \nobligations and allow for better targeting of safety nets to ensure the access of the poorest to basic levels of services.  \n \n2. Design Features.  \nThere are no specific pro-poor design features.  \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nKey Issues. The impact of the program on the budget should provide benefits to the Tuvalu economy and the Tuvaluan \npeople. The specific areas of impact ans scale of impact will be dependent on the decisions government makes once a \nstrengthened policy and legislative environment is put in place and so is unable to be assessed at this point. The potential \nimpacts of resultant government decisions will be assessed and analyzed under the supporting TA.   \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nStakeholder analysis will be undertaken as part of the reform process to fully understand and take into account the views \nof, and interests of, and impacts on all stakeholder groups. This analysis will be supported through the technical \nassistance (TA) for Capacity Development for Public Financial Management.  \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n   Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n63\n\nStakeholder analysis will be undertaken as part of the reform process to fully understand and take into account the views \nof, and interests of, and impacts on all stakeholder groups. This analysis will be supported through the technical \nassistance (TA) for Capacity Development for Public Financial Management.  \n \nThe TA for Capacity Development for Public Financial Management which supports the implementation of the policy matrix \nincludes provision for a local project facilitator, the TOR for which focus on consultation and participation activities to be \nundertaken under the guidance of the technical specialists and advisors. These activities will be directed at client groups \nand public enterprise workers, as well as government officials and parliamentarians. The TA for Capacity Development for \nPublic Financial Management incorporates the preparation and implementation of stakeholder participation and \nconsultations into the reform process. \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues.  \nCurrently, no specific adverse impacts on women are foreseen.  \n \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to \nand use of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n \n\n  Gender plan      \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n \nSummarize key design features of the gender plan or other gender-related actions/measures, including performance \ntargets, monitorable indicators, resource allocation, and implementation arrangements. \n \nThe activities supported under the policy matrix will actively encourage representation by women on the boards of public \ncorporations.  \nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\n \nIssue \n\n \nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\nNo impact \n\n \nIndigenous Peoples \n \n\nNo impact \n\nLimited \n\n \nLabor \n\n Employment  \nopportunities \n Labor retrenchment \n Core labor standards \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n \n\n   Full Plan \n   Short Plan \n   Resettlement Framework \n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action \n   Indigenous Peoples \n\nFramework \n\n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action  \n   No Action \n\nStrategy to Address \nIssue \nThe Program is not \nenvisioned to require any \nresettlement \n\nThe Program is not \nenvisaged to have any \nimpacts on indigenous \npeople. \n\nIn the medium term the \nProgram is expected to \ncreate new private sector \njob opportunities as \ncontracting out of \ngovernment services is \nconsidered. In the longer \nterm more efficient public \ncorporations should reduce \nthe costs of doing business \nand promote private sector \ndevelopment, hence, \ncreate private sector job \nopportunities. \nGovernment is currently \nensuring affordability of \nutility services (power \ntelecom, water, etc.) by \ncontrolling tariffs. This, \nhowever, does not \nspecifically target the \nneediest, and has become \nunaffordable to \nGovernment.
