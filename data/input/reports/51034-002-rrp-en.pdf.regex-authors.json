THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of Uzbekistan for the Sustainable Solid-Waste Management Project.1 \n  \n2.  The project will take a holistic approach to improve solid-waste management (SWM) \nservices nationwide, and strengthen sector performance and environmental sustainability by (i) \nupgrading SWM collection systems, (ii) building institutional capacity, (iii) strengthening the SWM \nregulatory  framework,  (iv)  enhancing  public  awareness,  and  (v)  improving  environmental \nmonitoring capacity.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  National context. Uzbekistan is one of the most dynamic economies in Central Asia, \nachieving a consistent annual growth rate of 4%\u20138% during 2005\u20132018.3 Since independence in \n1991, a gradual transition to a market-based economy has characterized growth in Uzbekistan.4 \nSince 2016, the Government of Uzbekistan has intensified structural transformations, with a focus \non increasing industrialization and economic diversification, attracting foreign direct investment, \nand balancing urban and rural development. Strategic investments in infrastructure, including \nSWM, are therefore an essential part of the government\u2019s economic growth strategy.5 \n \n4.  Sector performance and issues. The Ministry of Communal Services was responsible for \nthe collection, transport, and disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW)6 until its dissolution in 2001. \nSince then, the responsibility for SWM provision has been transferred to departments of municipal \ngovernments (hokimiyats) that were responsible for landscaping and territorial improvements, \nincluding in rural areas.7 However, these entities suffered from severe performance issues and \naccountability, cost recovery, low tariff and capacity deficiencies, resulting in widespread systemic \ncollapse of the nation\u2019s SWM system. By 2014, only 20% of MSW was even collected across the \ncountry, with collection largely restricted to in and around Tashkent, the nation\u2019s capital. MSW is \ngenerally disposed of in open dump sites, with virtually no environmental protection measures. There \nis limited recycling, and public awareness is low. As it is estimated that Uzbekistan generated more \nthan 4 million tons of MSW in 2014, and this is expected to grow to 6.6 million tons by 2035, \ncumulatively generating more than 100 million tons, significant investments are needed in the SWM \nsystem to meet the growing demands. \n \n \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2019. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Uzbekistan for Sustainable Solid-\nWaste Management Project. Manila.  \n3  The growth rate was 6.2% in 2016, 4.5% in 2017, and 5.1% in 2018, with forecasts of 5.8% for 2019 and 6.0% for \n2020. ADB. 2019. Uzbekistan: Economy. Tashkent (accessed 17 February 2020). \n4  Government of Uzbekistan. 2017. Presidential Decree No. 4947. On Strategy of Actions for Further Development of \nUzbekistan. Tashkent. \n5  Republic of Uzbekistan. 2019. Resolution No. PP-4291 About approval of Strategy according to the treatment of \nmunicipal solid waste in the Republic of Uzbekistan for 2019\u20122028. Tashkent. \n6  Municipal  solid  waste  (MSW)  is  nonhazardous  solid  waste  from  residential,  commercial,  and  institutional \nestablishments. It also includes green waste and street sweeping waste. It does not include industrial, hazardous, \nmedical, or other wastes. \n7  Tashkent city was the exception: Tashkent developed its solid-waste management (SWM) system through World Bank \nfunding, later to be rehabilitated through an ADB-funded loan (ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President \nto the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Republic of Uzbekistan for Solid Waste Management Improvement \nProject. Manila (approved October 2013, $69 million)). \n ", "2 \n \n5.  Sector reforms. Since 2014, the government has responded directly to these challenges \nby implementing widespread sector reforms, including fostering sector dialogue, reforming policy, \nenacting legislation, reorganizing and strengthening sector institutions, investing in physical \ninfrastructure, and promoting private sector intervention. Initially, reforms focused on enacting \nregulations to enhance environmental standards and compliance and improving SWM service \nprovision. The government established 157 district sanitary cleaning units to provide services in \nrural areas, procured more than 1,400 vehicles and equipment units, and constructed 14,000 \nMSW community collection points. Private sector participation also increased, both by outsourcing \nwaste  collection  services  in  41  of  the  nation\u2019s  83  cities  and  towns,  and  subsequently  by \nestablishing public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) for SWM services in nine large city and urban \ncenter \u2018clusters\u2019.8  \n \n6.  Since 2017, government has accelerated further sector reforms, including the transitioning \nof nationwide responsibility from the hokimiyats to the State Committee of the Republic of \nUzbekistan for Ecology and Environmental Protection (SCEEP).9 In parallel, the government also \ncreated Toza hududs (state unitary enterprises) in the Republic of Karakalpakstan and each of the \nnation\u2019s 12 provinces to improve provincial (urban and rural) SWM services in areas not served \nby the private sector,10 and established the Republican Association of Specialized Enterprises for \nSanitary Cleaning to promote, coordinate, and monitor toza hudud institutional development and \ncapacity building at the national level. Sector monitoring has also improved.11 As a result of these \nreforms, by March of 2019, MSW collection coverage has reportedly improved nationwide from \nless than 20% to about 48% (15.7 million inhabitants), and about 5,000 jobs have been created.12 \n \n7.  National strategy for solid-waste management. Assisted by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), the government also formulated a national strategy for SWM in April 2019 (footnote 5). The \nstrategy\u2019s overarching objective is to integrate all SWM activities to (i) minimize public health and \nenvironmental impacts; (ii) create effective, reliable, and socially acceptable SWM systems; (iii) \nmaximize the reduction, reuse, and recycling of waste; and (iv) promote new technologies and \nfinancing mechanism. The strategy includes a detailed action plan with 36 actions to be completed \nin a phased approach between 2019 and 2028.13 The actions aim to (i) update the legislative \nframework; (ii) strengthen the asset and technical base; (iii) improve organizational capacity; (iv) \nintroduce waste segregation and promote recycling; (v) mainstream SWM education, awareness, \nand advocacy; (vi) update tariffs and improve cost recovery; and (vii) strengthen environmental \nmonitoring and compliance.  \n \n \n8   These city and urban center \u2018clusters\u2019 are in the autonomous Republic of Karakalpakstan and the provinces of Andijan, \nBukhara, Khorezm, Surkhandayra, Kashkadarya, Navoi, Djizzak, and Syrdarya. \n9   Republic of Uzbekistan. 2017. Decree of the President of Uzbekistan No. UP-5024. Tashkent. SCEEP is therefore both \nthe regulator in charge of environmental oversight and control, and the nationwide proponent of most SWM services.  \n10  Toza hududs are mandated to serve the most difficult operational areas, where haulage distances, remoteness, limited \nMSW quantities, and consumer inability and unwillingness to pay are most prevalent. \n11  Entities are assigned to strengthen internal and external control systems within the sector\u2019s institutional framework: (i) the \nProvincial  Center  for  Organizing  Sanitation  Services  controls  the  national  SWM  billing  database,  monitors  the \nperformance of toza hududs and private operators, and handles customer complaints and litigation; and (ii) the Collection \nEnforcement Agency of the Chief Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Uzbekistan collects tariffs. \n12  Including coverage for toza hudud (32%), Maxsustrans (4% coverage), Maraqand Obod (1%), and private sector \ngroup (11%). Based on SCEEP published report. \n13  Including (i) an initial phase to strengthen the regulatory framework, rationalize and operationalize SWM service \ndelivery institutions, address acute MSW collection deficiencies, and improve dump sites; (ii) a second phase to \nachieve universal SWM collection coverage, and transit from existing dump sites to modern sanitary landfills; and \n(iii) a third phase to accelerate waste reduction and recycling initiatives, and incorporate alternative technologies. \n ", "3 \n8.  Priority needs. Key areas for support are (i) developing the regulatory framework, (ii) \nmaking  operational  and  improving  the  Republican Association of Specialized Enterprises for \nSanitary Cleaning and toza hududs, (iii) enhancing environmental monitoring and compliance, and \n(iv) filling investment gaps for basic SWM collection vehicles and equipment to expand service \ncoverage (currently at 48%). \n \n9.  ADB  and  development  partner  support.  ADB  has  been  actively  assisting  the \ngovernment to rehabilitate and expand the Tashkent city SWM system, and to formulate the \nnational SWM strategy.14 Similarly, the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement is implementing an \nSWM project in Samarkand city, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is \npreparing an SWM project to establish sanitary landfills in Karakalpakstan and Horezm. Close \ncoordination is ongoing with the development partners under the guidance of the national SWM \nstrategy. The government has commenced improvement of the MSW disposal systems through \nupgrading of existing dump sites. Waste-to-energy proposals are being explored to minimize the \nwaste to be disposed of.  \n \n10.  Project alignment and lessons learned. The project is consistent with the ADB country \npartnership strategy, 2019\u20122023 for Uzbekistan,15 and aligns with ADB's Strategy 2030 operational \npriorities of strengthening governance and institutional capacity, addressing remaining poverty, \naccelerating progress in gender equality, enhancing environmental sustainability, and creating \nlivable  cities.16 It  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2020\u2012202217 for \nUzbekistan. The project prioritizes asset operation and maintenance (O&M), performance-based \noperations, and cost recovery to improve sustainability. Lessons incorporated in the project design \ninclude (i) an inclusive development approach through transparent mechanisms that enable \nstakeholders to participate and contribute meaningfully as users, enablers, and providers; (ii)  \nstreamlined procurement management and additional procurement support to reduce project \nimplementation delays; (iii) quality standards for civil works structures; and (iv) progressively \ntransforming the toza hududs to asset managers, enabling and encouraging private sector and \ncivil society for asset operation and service delivery. \n \nB.  Project Description  \n \n11.  Proposed project. The project will assist the government to (i) update the SWM legal \nframework by developing specific regulatory directives; (ii) build institutional capacity in and improve \nthe sustainability of the Republican Association of Specialized Enterprises for Sanitary Cleaning and \ntoza hududs; (iii) develop and mainstream environmental education, awareness, and advocacy; (iv) \nstrengthen toza hudud asset bases and improve collection services through the provision of vehicles, \nequipment, and physical infrastructure; and (v) improve SCEEP\u2019s environmental testing capabilities. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: environment, health, and living conditions \nimproved. The project will have the following outcome: reliable and sustainable SWM services \nimproved and expanded in small urban centers and peri-urban and rural areas nationwide, \nbenefiting at least 6 million people (footnote 1). \n \n \n14  ADB. 2013.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n23.  The project supports priorities identified in the SWM strategy and addresses critical \ndeficiencies in SWM service provision by expanding MSW collection services to about 6 million \nunserved or underserved inhabitants nationwide. Feasibility assessment has considered a range \nof SWM vehicle and equipment alternatives and the selection of a preferred alternative that \nmaximizes efficiency while ensuring equitable vehicle and equipment distribution throughout the \nnation\u2019s 13 provinces. The service centers will strengthen long-term system sustainability, and in \nturn build managerial and operational capacity. The project investments have also been designed \nto seamlessly integrate with future SWM system upgrades, notably the establishment of regional \nMSW collection, transfer, treatment, and disposal systems. The system design prioritizes the \nintroduction of new technologies, including enhanced GPS tracking features for SWM vehicles, \nvehicles and equipment that meet international emission standards, and the use of alternative \nfuels such as compressed natural gas in vehicles. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n24.  Economic analysis. The project is economically viable with an economic internal rate of \nreturn of 17.3%, which is above ADB\u2019s minimum prescribed discount rate of 9.0%. The project \nremains economically robust under various scenarios including a 10% increase in investment \ncost, a 10% increase in O&M costs, and a 10% decline in project benefits. The quantified \n ", "8 \n \neconomic benefits of the project include (i) incremental consumption benefits from the improved \nSWM for residents, and (ii) the incremental (value added) tourism benefits accruing to the \neconomy as a result of a cleaner and consequently more attractive environment. The project team \ncalculated the incremental consumption benefits of the project based on an estimated willingness \nto pay of SUM2,319 per person per month using a contingent valuation methodology. The project \nteam estimated the tourism benefits based on about 170,000 international visitors visiting the \nproject towns and cities, as well as their length of stay and average daily spending.22 \n \n25.  Financial analysis. The financial analysis assesses the 13 toza hududs and their ability \nto generate sufficient revenues to cover their operating expenses. Although the toza hududs were \nestablished in late 2017, the analysis of their 2018 audited financial statements reveal that 12 out \nof the 13 toza hududs generated sufficient revenues to cover their operating expenses. Only one  \ndid not meet its operating expenses in 2018, however it mitigated this shortfall with a 17% tariff \nincrease in January 2019 and covered its operating expenses in 2019. The projections of the toza \nhududs over the next 10 years, with a 5% profit margin and 20% debt repayment for each required \nby SCEEP, indicate that all will meet their operating expenses with an average annual tariff \ncompound growth of 8.6% over a 5-year period (2019\u20132024) when they start to pay their debts in \n2024, and from then annual tariff increases of about 7.7% (same as the inflation rate). The impact \nof tariff increases is about 0.4% of monthly household income, within 1.0% of monthly household \nincome which is considered reasonable and affordable.23  \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n26.  The project\u2019s outcome will be sustained over the long term through a combination of \nproject  interventions.  Through  the  project,  (i)  the  subsector\u2019s  regulatory  framework  will  be \nenhanced  to  improve  sector  operations;  (ii)  the  capacity  of  the  Republican  Association  of \nSpecialized Enterprises for Sanitary Cleaning and toza hududs will be strengthened; (iii) a public \neducation  and  awareness  program  will  promote  SWM  consumer  awareness  and  improved \ncommunity SWM nationwide; and (iv) the project\u2019s vehicle and equipment fleets maximize \nefficiency and distribution equity, being sustained through the service centers. The project is \nfinancially and economically viable and has built-in climate mitigation measures. It will improve \nthe environment, reduce public health risks, support tourism and economic development, and \nimprove the quality of life of 6 million people, many of whom live in peri-urban and rural areas. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n27.  The financial management assessment concluded that the capacity of SCEEP and its \nPMU is adequate to implement this project.24 The overall risk is considered substantial, because \nthe public financial management risk at the country level is substantial due to weak internal audit \nfunctions and international standards not being followed. The project-level risk is, however, \nmoderate, as both SCEEP and the PMU have experience with ADB-financed projects and are \nfamiliar with ADB's financial management requirements and disbursement procedures. Certain \nfinancial management areas will be further strengthened under the project, as detailed in the PAM \n(footnote 19). \n \n \n22  Based on travel statistics published by the State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan for Tourism Development. \n23 Water  Sanitation  Program.  2011.  Cost  Recovery  in  Urban  Water  Services:  Select  Experiences  in  Indian \nCities.  Washington, DC. World Health Organization benchmark of expenditure at 5% of monthly household income.  \n24  The financial management assessment was conducted in September 2019 in accordance with (ADB. 2005. Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects. Manila.; and ADB. 2009. Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note. \nManila.) \n ", "9 \n28.  A  project  procurement  risk  assessment  was  conducted  as  part  of  the  strategic \nprocurement planning process. The overall risk is considered moderate. Risks identified in the \ncountry sector procurement risk assessment impacting at the project level are moderate. The \ncapacity of SCEEP and its PMU is considered satisfactory. Risks for each of the different project \nphases (i.e. design, tender, contract implementation) were identified, with twelve out of total forty-\neight are considered as high. Details of risks and mitigation measures are described in the project \nprocurement risk assessment and PAM (footnote 19). To achieve the principle of value for money, \nfit-for-purpose  procurement  arrangements  will  be  considered  during  the  implementation  in \naccordance with the procurement strategy prepared in the strategic procurement planning. The \nproject team conducted integrity due diligence. No significant integrity risks were identified.  \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and SCEEP. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n30.  Overall, the national poverty rate is estimated at 11.4%.25 However, using 1.5 times the \nminimal wage as a poverty threshold, the poverty and social assessment concluded that 23.3% \nof the project area\u2019s households are poor. The project will improve SWM for underserved rural \nareas and improve the level of customer satisfaction from 63% to 80%. Social infrastructure \nfacilities also suffer from a lack of SWM services. In the project areas, more than 40,000 \ninstitutions and organizations located in rural areas are functioning with irregular solid-waste \ncollection. The overall project social impacts are expected to be positive, with improvements to \nthe quality of life for people in peri-urban and rural areas. The project will improve solid-waste \ncollection, recovery, and disposal services for the full range of social strata, including the rural \npoor and other vulnerable groups in each toza hudud\u2019s areas. The majority (92.7%) of the \nsurveyed households are willing to pay for the improved SWM services.  \n \n31.  Women  are  less  represented  in  the  subsector  (12%),  with  limited  employment \nopportunities. The project will create new managerial and technical jobs and provide professional \nskills improvement for female staff in toza hududs. Women are disproportionately engaged in the \nhandling of household waste and are affected when scavenging in uncontrolled environments. \nThe project will have a positive impact on rural livelihoods and women\u2019s burden. The poverty \nreduction  and  social  strategy  includes  measures  to  address  social  impacts  and  enhance \ndistribution of benefits from the project. Proposed tariffs have been assessed as affordable for \nlow-income groups. Women and children (especially girls) will benefit from the project because of \nsecure and better waste collection and disposal services. The project will be classified as effective \ngender mainstreaming. The gender benefits of the project include (i) gender equity provisions in \nthe  regulatory  framework,  (ii) gender-responsive  measures  in  the  institutional  strengthening \nprogram, (iii) gender-sensitive customer relations and complaints systems, and (iv) female staff\u2019s \nprofessional advancement and equal employment opportunities.  \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n32.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.26 \n \n \n25  ADB. 2019. Basic 2019 Statistics. Manila. \n26  ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "10 \n \n33.  Environment (category B). An initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken, \nand it includes 13 sites (one in each province of the nation) selected for the construction of service \ncenters. Environmental impacts from the project are expected to be site specific and include dust, \nwaste generation, asbestos, and the transportation of construction materials. These impacts can \nbe mitigated by proper implementation of mitigation measures developed in the environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP).  The  IEE  includes  mitigation  measures  for  the  construction  and \noperational phases, as presented in the EMP. For two sites, additional waste management and \ndust control measures are included in the EMP for the construction period because of their \nlocations in the vicinity of settlements. PMU will prepare an asbestos management and disposal \nplan as part of the EMP for the sites where asbestos is present. All sites are in compliance with \nrelevant sanitary protection zone requirements. Because of the limited and specific types of \nmaintenance works which will be provided by the service centers, environmental impacts during \nthe operational phase will be limited. The project team conducted public consultation meetings \nwith stakeholders in each project site.  \n \n34.  The PMU under SCEEP will be responsible for EMP implementation and compliance with \nADB\u2019s safeguards requirements and national regulations. One environment specialist will oversee \nEMP implementation. A grievance redress mechanism to mitigate environmental and social \nsafeguard issues has been confirmed with the executing agency, implementing agency, and \nstakeholders during public consultations. The grievance redress mechanism will be established \nafter project effectiveness. PMU will prepare the environmental monitoring reports (EMRs)  and \nsubmit to ADB and relevant government agencies. This includes semiannual EMRs and a final \nEMR  that  will  incorporate  post-construction  environmental  audits.  The  EMRs  will  also  be \ndisclosed to the public on the SCEEP and toza hudud websites (in Uzbek or Russian) and the \nADB website (in English). ADB disclosed the draft IEE on its website on 8 October 2019. \n \n35.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). Due diligence confirmed that the construction of \nthe 13 service centers will not entail involuntary resettlement impacts. Land plots for nine new \nservice centers have been allocated from government reserve lands, and the remaining four \nservice centers will not require additional land provision. The project team prepared a safeguards \ndue diligence report to (i) screen all the project activities and potential involuntary resettlement \nimpacts and risks associated with the project, (ii) confirm there are no outstanding legacy issues \nin the project sites, and (iii) confirm that measures to avoid the adverse impacts are integrated \ninto the project design. The executing agency has sufficient understanding of ADB\u2019s safeguards \npolicy, principles, and requirements, and has committed to mitigation measures as appropriate. \nThe supervision consultant will conduct periodic monitoring to verify that there are no adverse \nimpacts during implementation and that public consultation, information disclosure, and grievance \nredress are carried out during the project period. \n \n36.  Indigenous peoples (category C). There are no indigenous peoples or communities \npresent at or around the project sites.  \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n37.
