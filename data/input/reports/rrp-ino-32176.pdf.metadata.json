The summary is a core appendix. \n   \nProject Description  The Project is the second of a three-phase comprehensive, 15-\nyear  program  funded  by  several  financing  institutions  for  the \nrehabilitation  and  management  of  coral  reefs  in  Indonesia. \nIncorporating  lessons  learned  from  Phase  I,  Loan  1613-INO: \nCoral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Project, the Project \nwill  adopt  a  holistic  approach  to  the  management  of  coastal \nresources,  particularly  coral  reefs  and  associated  ecosystems. \nThe Project will focus on a few key provinces where the costs of \ndelaying, and the benefits from expediting, such a project are \ngreatest. The Project will follow a participatory process by which \ncoastal communities will organize themselves, with the assistance \nof local governments and project facilitators; identify their specific \nneeds; and plan and implement their community-specific resource \nmanagement and livelihood programs based on their perceived \nneeds.  \n   \nRationale  Indonesia\u2019s  coral  reefs  form  the  key  ecosystem  on  which  the \nmajority  of  the  coastal  inhabitants  rely  for  food,  income \ngeneration,  construction  materials,  and  coastal  protection.  The \nIndonesian coastal and marine sector is beset with a number of \nproblems.  Foremost  among  these  are  the  two  critical  and \ninterrelated  issues  of  resource  degradation  and  the  pervasive \npoverty among coastal communities. A rapid social assessment of \ncoastal villages in the targeted project districts found that 65\u201383% \nof  the  population  in  the  proposed  project  sites  live  below  the \nnational poverty line and are deprived of basic social amenities \nand services like potable water supply, sewerage and sanitation, \nand health and education. In these areas, the extensive coral \nreefs and associated ecosystems are subject to continuing threats \nfrom  natural  processes  and  from  human  activities,  including \ndestructive and illegal fishing, sand mining, and coral mining. In \naddition, the coastal and marine sector continues to suffer from \npolicy, legal, and institutional constraints. Phase I has successfully \ndeveloped  and  established  a  comprehensive  framework  and \nprogram of national policy, monitoring, control and surveillance, \npublic awareness, information and monitoring, and research in \nsupport of coral reef management and monitoring. The proposed \nProject will build on these and promote sustainable management \nof coral reef resources, and thereby reduce poverty. \n \n ", "ii \n   \nObjectives  The  Project  will  (i) enhance  the  national  and  local  capacity  to \nmanage the country\u2019s coral reef resources and (ii) rehabilitate and \neffectively manage priority coral reef ecosystems, thereby helping \nraise income levels and improving living standards among poor \ncoastal  communities.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  in  six \ndistricts  in  three  provinces,  namely  (i) Kota  Batam,  Kepulauan \nRiau, and Natuna in Riau Province; (ii) Nias and Tapanuli Tengah \nin North Sumatra Province; and (iii) Mentawai in West Sumatra \nProvince. It will comprise two major components: (i) institutional \nstrengthening and project management and (ii) community-based \nresource management and development. The first component will \ncomprise (i) strengthening of national and regional institutions in \npolicy, strategy, and guideline formulation and resource planning \nand  management;  (ii)  establishment  and  strengthening  of  a \nnetwork of coral reef information and training centers (CRITCs); \n(iii)  human  resources  development  (HRD)  and  extension;  and \n(iv) project  management.  The  second  component  will  involve \n(i) community  empowerment,  (ii)  community  resource \nmanagement,  (iii)  community  social  services  and  infrastructure \ndevelopment,  and  (iv)  community  livelihood  and  income \ngeneration. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost, including service charge and contingencies, \nis  estimated  at  $41.25 million  equivalent,  comprising  a  foreign \nexchange component of $8.27 million (20% of total cost) and a \nlocal currency cost of $32.98 million equivalent (80% of total cost). \nThe estimates include a provision for $0.92 million equivalent in \ntaxes and duties. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan  of  $33 million \nequivalent (80% of the total project cost) will finance the entire \nforeign exchange cost of $8.27 million and a portion of the local \ncurrency  cost  amounting  to  $24.73 million  (75%  of  total  local \ncosts). The remaining local currency cost of $8.75 million will be \nfinanced  by  the  Government  and  project  beneficiaries.  The \ngovernment contribution will come from the central Government \nand  the  governments  of  the  three  provinces  and  six  districts. \nBeneficiaries\u2019  contribution  will  be  in  the  form  of  labor  for \ncommunity-based  law  enforcement,  construction  and \nimprovement  of  various  small-scale  infrastructure  facilities  and \naccess roads, and livelihood development activities. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $33 million will be provided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources (SDR 25,004,000). The loan will have a 32-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, an interest charge of 1% per \nannum on principal amount disbursed during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft Loan Agreement. \n   \n   ", "iii \nEstimated Project  30 June 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The  Project  will  be  implemented  by  four  directorates  general \nArrangements  under  the  Ministry  of  Marine  Affairs  and  Fisheries  (MMAF): \n(i) Coasts  and  Small  Islands  (DGCSI),  (ii) Capture  Fisheries, \n(iii) Aquaculture,  and  (iv) Marine  Resource  and  Fisheries \nControlling. A project management office (PMO) will be set up \nwithin DGCSI, with a qualified full-time project director, to oversee \nthe  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  Project.  The  Indonesian \nInstitute  of  Sciences  (LIPI) will  be  the  national  implementing \nagency for research, information, monitoring, and training on coral \nreef management. The PMO established in LIPI during Phase I \nProject will be converted into a national project implementation \nunit. Six regional project implementation units will be set up, one \nin  each  project  district,  to  oversee  and  coordinate  field-level \nimplementation.  An  interagency  national  steering  committee \n(NSC) will be established to guide the overall direction of the \nProject and ensure overall coordination of activities between the \nProject and other government programs and projects. The NSC \nwill  be  supported  by  a  national  technical  committee,  whose \nchairperson  will  serve  as  NSC  secretary.  A  regional  advisory \ncommittee (RAC) will be established in each project province to \noversee  project  coordination  between  various  implementing \nagencies  (IAs)  at  the  local  level  and  liaise  with  the  NSC  as \nrequired. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) \n   \nProcurement  All services, supplies, and equipment to be financed by ADB will \nbe  procured  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. All goods to be purchased through local competitive \nbidding  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  Government \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Equipment  and  materials  for \npackages valued at $500,000 or more will be procured through \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Some  supply \ncontracts  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $500,000  and  certain \nspecialized items will be procured using international shopping \nprocedures. Minor items of equipment and materials costing less \nthan $100,000 will be procured through direct purchase. The civil \nworks packages are estimated to cost less than $1 million each \nand will therefore be awarded on the basis of local competitive \nbidding procedures among prequalified contractors, in accordance \nwith  the  Government\u2019s  standard  procurement  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. \n   ", "iv \nConsulting Services  International and domestic consultants will be engaged through an \ninternational consulting firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to \nADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. A total of 534 \nperson-months  of  consulting  services,  consisting  of  54 \ninternational and 480 domestic person-months, will be required for \neffective project implementation. The consultants will support the \nPMO and the project implementation units in two broad areas: \n(i) project management and (ii) technical advice in specific areas \nlike coral reef management, community monitoring, control and \nsurveillance,  community  development,  policy  planning,  training \nand  extension,  database  management,  and  public \ncommunications. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will benefit coastal communities in six districts through \nBeneficiaries  increased employment at the community and district levels and \nimproved living conditions and standards of coastal residents. It \nwill  target,  as  its  primary  beneficiaries,  those  households \ncomposed mainly of small fishers, fish farmers, fish processors, \nand workers in the fishing industry and allied fields. Training of \ncommunity-based organizations in better resource management \nwill improve the productive capacity of the coastal communities, \nand transform the fishers among them into responsible resource \nusers  and  managers.  Local  fishers  will  be  provided  with \nalternative income through specific fishery-related skills training, \nwhich will help prevent them from using destructive and illegal \nmeans of fishing. Increased income and greater access to basic \nsocial infrastructure facilities and services will improve health and \nnutrition and raise the living standards of the communities. As \nwomen  will  be  involved  in  these  various  activities,  the \nimprovements  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  their  families\u2019 \nsocioeconomic status, health, and general well-being. The Project \nwill result in substantial environmental benefits in the form of (i) an \nincrease in live coral cover in areas previously bombed or mined \nand  a  resulting  increase  in  the  abundance  of  commercially \nimportant reef resources such as reef fish, turtles, b\u00eaches-de-mer, \ngiant clams, trochus shells, pearls, and other mollusks such as \ncone shells and cowries; and (ii) a reduction in the extent of coral \nreef degradation. In addition, the Project is expected to produce \nnonquantifiable  benefits  arising  from  planning  and  policy \ndevelopment, institutional strengthening, and community resource \nmanagement and development. \n   ", "v \nRisks and Assumptions  The  project  risks  that  could  adversely  affect  project \nimplementation and the attainment of project objectives include: \n(i) the slow growth of corals that could delay the realization of \nproject  targets;  (ii) institutional  inadequacies  in  the  Executing \nAgency and IAs, as well as community-based organizations and \nthe communities themselves, for their roles in coastal resource \nmanagement;  (iii) uncertainties  emanating  from  the  evolving \ndecentralization  process  and  institutional  arrangements  at  the \nprovincial  and  district  levels;  (iv) persistence  of  nonadaptive, \ncontrol-based  attitudes  on  the  part  of  national  government \nagencies; and (v) government limitations in providing adequate \nfinancial and human resources for continued implementation of \nproject  activities  and  facilities  beyond  the  term  of  the  Project. \nMitigating measures and specific assurances to address these \nrisks have been included in the project design. \n ", "vii ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Project Phase II \n(the Project).1 \n \nII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Indonesia is the world\u2019s largest archipelagic nation, with more than 17,000 islands and \n81,000 kilometers (km) of coastline. Its coastal and marine waters cover an area of 5.8 million \nsquare kilometers (km2), comprising 3.1 million km2 of territorial and archipelagic seas and \n2.7 million km2 of exclusive economic zones. The coastal zone is a highly productive ecosystem \nthat serves as an important base for the country\u2019s economic growth. Coastal habitats play an \nimportant role in the daily lives of the people in terms of livelihood, economic output, and food \nproduction. Over 55% of the national fishery harvest comes from capture fisheries in coastal \nareas. Some of the richest areas of biodiversity are found in the coastal zone of the country, and \ninclude coral reefs, mangrove swamps, seagrass beds, lagoons, and estuaries. Indonesia\u2019s \ncoastal zone is home to 2,500 species of mollusks, 2,000 species of crustaceans, six species of \nsea turtles, 30 species of marine mammals, and over 2,000 species of fish. With its 70 genera \nand 450 species of corals covering 42,000 km2 (or 16.5% of the global area of coral reefs), \nIndonesia is the coral biodiversity center of the world. \n \n3.  Indonesia\u2019s coral reefs form the key ecosystem on which the majority of the coastal \ninhabitants of the country rely for food, income generation, construction materials, and coastal \nprotection. They are also of critical significance for science, education, pharmaceuticals, and \nglobal conservation and heritage. Healthy reefs can produce marine products worth $15,000 per \nkm2 per year, and are an important source of food and economic opportunities for about 67,500 \ncoastal villages. Coastal and marine economic activities have been estimated to account for \nsome  25\u201330%  of  Indonesia\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  and  provide  employment  to  about \n20 million  people.  The  reefs  also  play  an  important  role  in  marine-based  tourism  and  in \nproviding white sand for beaches. The tourism value of coral reefs has been estimated at \n$3,000 per km2 per year in low potential areas to $500,000 per km2 per year in high potential \nsites. Fringing coral reefs also play key roles in dissipating wave energy, thereby protecting \ncoastal  lands  from  storms  and  wave  erosion.  The  net  benefits  of  coastal  protection  are \nestimated at $15,000\u2013120,000 per km2 of reef, depending on the value of the infrastructure. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n4.  The Indonesian coastal and marine resources sector suffers from policy, legal, and \ninstitutional constraints affecting resource management in the coastal areas. The National Coral \nReef Policy drafted under Phase I Project is yet to be operationalized at the regional level. The \nSpatial  Planning  Act  24/1992,  which  provides  the  framework  and  legal  basis  for  natural \nresources planning and resource allocation, needs to be amended for consistency with the \nprovisions of recent laws on decentralization. Law 22/1999 on Regional Governance and Law \n25/1999 on Financial Balance between the Central and Regional Governments have added new \n                                                 \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided funds to the Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Project \nPhase I (Loan 1613-INO) as well as an attached technical assistance grant (TA 3001-INO) to design the proposed \ninvestment project. The project framework for the proposed Project is in Appendix 1. ", "2 \ndimensions to governance and natural resources planning and management.2 The lack of \ninstitutional capacity and preparedness of many local governments for the required tasks could \nexacerbate the problems of resource degradation. \n \n5.  There is, thus, an urgent need to strengthen the institutional capacity of provincial and \ndistrict governments in participatory resource planning and management to enable them to \nexercise  their  newly  mandated  authority  and  responsibility  in  resource  management.  The \nBAPPEDAs (regional development planning agencies), at the provincial and district levels, and \nother provincial and district agencies, need strengthening to equip them for their significantly \ngreater  planning  functions  and  role.  It  is  also  necessary  to  continue  support  for  national \ninitiatives in sector planning, information management, networking, and intersector coordination. \nAs the jurisdiction for marine waters beyond the 12-nautical mile boundary remains with the \ncentral  Government,  continuing  technical  and  financial  support  needs  to  be  extended  to \nconcerned sector agencies to enable them to carry out national-level sector planning and policy \nformulation for appropriate resource management. \n \n6.  As resource degradation is exacerbated by the extreme poverty of artisan (small-scale) \nfishers, who engage in fishing as a livelihood of last resort, it is necessary to improve their \nincome-earning potential and retrain them to undertake alternative livelihood activities so that \nthey avoid destructive fishing practice. Viable livelihood activities in coastal areas and small \nislands have to be developed/introduced specifically for small-scale fishers. Local resource \nrights also have to be strengthened to ensure that investment benefits flow to the communities. \n \n7.  To address the foregoing identified needs and constraints, the proposed Project will be \nimplemented in three provinces3 where areas have been identified as having high poverty \nincidence  and  high-priority  coral  reefs.  The  Project  supports  the  Government\u2019s  priority  on \npoverty reduction in coastal communities and the shift in focus from resource utilization to \nresource protection, conservation, and sustainable management. Although the sector issues \ntoday are basically the same as they were when Phase I Project was designed, the environment \nfor resource management and project implementation has improved significantly as a result of a \nnumber of recent developments, including (i) enactment of Laws 22 and 25; (ii) formulation of a \nNational Coral Reef Policy and a supporting National Coral Reef Strategy under Phase I of the \nProject; (iii) creation of Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF); (iv) heightened public \nawareness of the importance and benefits of coral reef resource conservation; and (v) stronger \npolitical will on the part of public officials to address institutional, regulatory, and enforcement \nissues that plagued coral reef management in the past. \n \n8.  The Project will be the second of three phases of a multiyear initiative funded by multiple \nagencies4  to  strengthen  the  management  and  conservation  of  Indonesia\u2019s  coral  reefs  and \n                                                 \n2  Law 22/1999 on Regional Governance calls for the devolution of jurisdiction over living and nonliving coastal \nresources  out  to  the  territorial  limits  of  12  nautical  miles  from  the  low  tide  line  to  provincial  and  district \ngovernments. \n3  Five  other  provinces  have  been  provisionally  identified  for  possible  funding  under  a  World  Bank/Global \nEnvironment Facility loan, namely, Southeast Sulawesi, South Sulawesi, North Sulawesi, Maluku, and Papua. \n4  Phase I is cofinanced by the World Bank, Global Environment Facility, and ADB. Parallel financing is provided by \nthe Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), which joined the Project after the approval of the \nProject by the World Bank and ADB. The combined investment of these agencies in Phase I (1998\u20132002) is \napproximately $23 million; the Government invested about $8 million. Phase I will be completed by October 2003. ", "3 \nassociated ecosystems.5 An independent evaluation of Phase I6 showed that the Project had \nsuccessfully developed and established a comprehensive framework and programs of national \npolicy; monitoring, control, and surveillance; public awareness; information and monitoring; and \nresearch in support of coral reef management. Specifically, the assessment indicated (i) a very \nhigh level of community involvement in coral reef resource management in the project areas, \nresulting in a significant reduction in illegal and destructive fishing and coral mining in most of \nthe  project  sites  by  more  than  50%  in  some  cases;  (ii) greater  public  awareness  of  the \nimportance  of  coral  reef  resource  management;  and  (iii) stronger  political  will  for  coastal \nresource management and poverty reduction at all levels of government. \n \n9.  However, the limited geographic coverage of Phase I has resulted in limited impacts on \naltering coral reef use patterns or on improving institutional effectiveness to coordinate coral \nreef  management.  This  is  because  of  (i) limited  resources  available  for  community-based \nmanagement (CBM) and alternative income-generating activities; (ii) the lack of a supportive \nlegal framework and weak enforcement of regulations; (iii) fragmented field implementation due \nto lack of cohesiveness between project components; (iv) the lack of a strategic approach and \ncapacity in local government agencies to meet their enhanced role under the Law 22/1999 for \ncoastal resource management; and (v) inadequate provision of basic social services and few \ntangible returns to poor coastal communities. \n \n10.  Other lessons from Phase I include the following: (i) coral reef protection cannot be \nsuccessful  unless  there  is  a  strong  legal  and  enforcement  regime;  (ii) a  balance  must  be \nachieved  between  activities  aimed  purely  at  reef  conservation  and  those  targeting \nimprovements in the quality of life of the communities; (iii) a broader ecosystem-based approach \nto address coral reef and biodiversity conservation is more effective than narrowly focused \ninterventions;  (iv) community  improvement  should  emphasize  sustainable  socioeconomic \nactivities that promote alternative livelihood, and social infrastructure projects should conserve \nresources, improve public health, or reduce pollution; and (v) considerable flexibility should be \nallowed  in  tailoring  programs  to  the  very  diverse  cultural,  socioeconomic,  and  biophysical \nconditions in different localities in Indonesia. \n \n11.  Incorporating lessons from Phase I and other similar funding agency-assisted projects in \nthe sector,7 the Project will be cohesive in its design. The Project will adopt a holistic approach \nto  coastal  resource  management  and  provide  poor  coastal  communities  with  basic  social \nservices, social infrastructure, and income-generating opportunities to balance environmental \nand resource management with socioeconomic development. It will place heavy emphasis on \nthe  active  participation  of  project  beneficiaries,  local  government  institutions,  and \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  in  the  planning  and  implementation  of  resource \nmanagement programs.  \n \n12.  The Project is in line with the Government\u2019s current Medium-term Development Program \n2001\u20132005 (PROPENAS) and the Guidelines of State Policy (1999\u20132004). It will assist the \nGovernment\u2019s poverty reduction thrust, which gives priority to developing income-generating \nactivities in the coastal zone and small islands, particularly for small-scale fishers. The Project \n                                                 \n5  The Project was planned for implementation in three phases over 15 years. Phase I, the Initiation Phase, \nconsisted of intensive resource rehabilitation and management activities in four pilot sites (Riau, South Sulawesi, \nIrian Jaya, and Nusa Tenggara Timur) as well as national-level activities aimed at establishing a viable policy and \nlegal framework and strategy for coral reef management. Phases II and III, each to be implemented over a 6-year \nperiod, are intended to be the Acceleration Phase and Expansion Phase, respectively.  \n6  The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) conducted the evaluation of Phase I in June 2002. \n7  See Appendix 3 for more information on recent external assistance to the sector. ", "4 \nlikewise supports the overarching poverty reduction goal of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand its country and sector strategies8 and is complementary to ongoing projects funded by ADB \nand other external agencies aimed at benefiting coral reefs, either at the local or regional level.9 \nIt is also supportive of government-funded poverty reduction programs, including the Inpres \nDesa Tertinggal (IDT)10 implemented in a number of coastal villages in the country.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n13.  The proposed Project is the second phase of a national coral reef rehabilitation and \nmanagement program whose overall goals are healthy coral reef ecosystems and prosperous \ncoastal communities. The objectives of the Project are to (i) enhance the national and local \ncapacity  to  manage  the  country\u2019s  coral  reef  resources  and  (ii) rehabilitate  and  effectively \nmanage  priority  coral  reef  ecosystems,  thereby  raising  income  levels  and  improving  living \nstandards among poor coastal communities. The Project will be implemented in six districts in \nthree provinces. These districts are: (i) Kota Batam, Kepulauan Riau, and Natuna in Riau; \n(ii) Nias and Tapanuli Tengah in North Sumatra; and (iii) Mentawai in West Sumatra. These \npriority districts contain more than 300,000 hectares (ha) of inshore coral reefs, representing \nsome 98% of the total reefs in the three provinces. They also have at least 450 coastal villages, \nof  which  about  87%  have  adjacent  reefs  and  depend  predominantly  on  fisheries  for  their \nlivelihood. In each district, core sites for CBM will be selected, based on agreed selection \ncriteria (Appendix 4). \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n14.  The  Project  will  comprise  two  major  components:  (i) institutional  strengthening  and \nproject management and (ii) community-based resource management and development. The \nfirst component will comprise (i) strengthening of national and regional institutions in policy, \nstrategy, and guideline formulation and resource planning and management; (ii) establishment \nand  strengthening  of  a  network  of  coral  reef  information  and  training  centers  (CRITCs); \n(iii) human resources development (HRD) and extension; and (iv) project management support. \nThe  second  component  will  include  (i) community  empowerment,  (ii) community  resource \nmanagement,  (iii) community  social  services  and  infrastructure  development,  and \n(iv) community livelihood and income generation.  \n \n1.  Institutional Strengthening and Project Management  \n15.  The Project will aim at (i) strengthening national and regional public sector institutions \nresponsible for coral reef management in the areas of coral reef policy and strategy formulation \nand  planning;  (ii) supporting  the  establishment  of  a  network  of  CRITCs  that  will  enable \n                                                 \n8  ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program (2003-2005) for Indonesia includes environmental management and human \nand social development. Within this framework, ADB\u2019s assistance to the marine and coastal sector of Indonesia \nfocuses on (i) resource evaluation, planning, and sustainable management; (ii) environmental protection and \nsocial development; (iii) human resources development; and (iv) support for decentralized resource management.  \n9  These include the (i) Coastal Community Development and Fisheries Resource Management Project (Loans: \n1570/1571 [SF]-INO); (ii) Marine and Coastal Resources Management Project (Loan 1770 [SF]-INO); (iii) USAID-\nfunded Natural Resources Management Project; (iv) Strategy Study for Marine and Coastal Resources Use and \nCoastal Environmental Management funded by the Canadian International Development Agency; and (v) the \nNature Conservancy-supported pilot project at the marine park within the Komodo National Park. \n10  The IDT program for poverty reduction covers around 28,000 IDT villages and has funds amounting to about \nRp520 billion per year. ", "5 \nnetworking,  information  sharing/exchange,  and  technical  direction  and  coordination  across \nproject sites, between the national center and the regional centers, and between the national \ncenter and other government agencies implementing similar projects; and (iii) equipping the \nproject executing and implementing agencies, NGOs, and project beneficiaries with the skills \nrequired for effective project implementation. \n \na.  Strengthening of National and Regional Government Institutions \n16.  National, regional, and local government agencies will be assisted in the development of \npolicies,  strategies,  guidelines,  and  regulations  for  sustainable  coral  reef  utilization  and \nmanagement, particularly in light of the devolution of coastal resource management functions to \nthe regional governments. At the national level, the Project will strengthen the policy-making, \nplanning,  and  regulatory  functions  of  MMAF  and  its  concerned  directorates.  Training  and \ntechnical support will be provided to other concerned ministries, such as Environment, Forestry, \nHome  Affairs,  Tourism  and  Culture,  Education,  and  the  Navy.  It  will  also  support  policy \ndevelopment  work  in  other  sector  agencies,  including  BAPPENAS  (National  Development \nPlanning Agency), which has jurisdiction over marine parks. \n \n17.  The Project will support each target province and district government in the review and \ndevelopment of an appropriate regional policy and legal framework for sustainable coral reef \nuse and protection. The regional CRITCs and regional project implementation units (RPIUs), will \nassist regional governments in (i) reviewing existing laws, regulations, and traditional rights and \npractices  on  coral  reef  management,  (ii) determining  the  need  to  amend  existing  laws  or \nrelevant regulations to promote more effective enforcement or to enact new laws consistent with \nnational  guidelines  on  coral  reef  management  and/or  to  recognize  traditional  rights,  and \n(iii) drafting  required  legal  amendments  or  enacting  new  laws  for  sustainable  coral  reef \nmanagement. To improve law enforcement, the Project will assist regional governments in \n(i) developing  appropriate  mechanisms  for  interagency  coordination,  (ii) institutionalizing \nprocedures and practices for transparency and participation in decision-making processes for \nresource  allocation  and  management,  and  (iii) implementing  regulatory  and  other  related \nfunctions that have been devolved to them by virtue of Law 22.  \n \n18.  Each participating district will formulate a marine action strategy and a corresponding \ncoral  reef  management  plan  (CRMP)  that  will  include  a  district  spatial  plan  to  guide  the \nallocation  of  marine  resources.11  The  marine  action  strategy  and  CRMP  will  be  prepared \nthrough a participatory process that will involve the local communities and will be facilitated by \nNGOs, fishery extension workers, and other extension services. The planning process will be \nbased on the findings of a prior rapid resource and ecological assessment conducted by the \nIndonesian  Institute  of  Sciences  (LIPI)  or  academic  and  research  institutions.  CRMPs  will \ninclude pilot activities intended to address identified priority issues and opportunities, including \ncommunity-based monitoring, control, and surveillance to address issues of destructive and \nillegal fishing. \n \n19.  The regional governments will be assisted by MMAF and project management office \n(PMO) consultants in the establishment of marine management areas and the conduct of \ncommunity-based  enforcement  and  compliance  at  selected  sites  in  target  districts.  Marine \nmanagement areas will be co-management areas aimed at a more effective management of \nissues common to neighboring villages as well as external issues such as sand mining, trawling, \nand  biodiversity  conservation.  Marine  management  areas  will  encompass  the  local  marine \n                                                 \n11  See Supplementary Appendix B for the CRM planning process and plan framework. ", "6 \nareas of several villages and could extend to up to 25,000 ha. Marine management areas will be \nidentified, delineated, and pilot-tested in each target district. Under the overall supervision of \nMMAF  and  the  regional  governments,  with  support  from  the  sector  agencies,  regional \ngovernments will organize and manage the various activities involved in marine management \narea establishment and local enforcement and compliance. The MMAF and regional CRITCs \nwill assist in the conduct of field assessment activities and liaison between the community, local \ngovernment, and the communities. They will also assist in the conduct of marine management \narea training activities and provision of technical advice, and will organize co-management of \nlocal enforcement and compliance activities, including joint local patrols and reef watchers. \n \nb.  Network of Coral Reef Information and Training Centers \n20.  The network of CRITCs established in Phase I will organize and link technical programs \nin support of coral reef protection and management and ensure appropriate technical direction, \nsupport, and integration of approaches and actions. The CRITCs will support each others\u2019 \nprograms by sharing resources and results, and by exchanging information and lessons as well \nas successful tools, strategies, and methodologies.  \n \n21.  Research. The Project will provide funds for national and local research in support of \ncoral reef management and livelihood development using research expertise available in the \ncountry. The national research program will be carried out by LIPI, MMAF, or other academic \nand research institutions, or consortia of public and private organizations under the overall \ndirection and supervision of the national CRITC. At the regional level, research activities will be \nconducted  under  the  supervision  of  the  regional  CRITCs  with  support  from  the  national \nCRITC/LIPI, as required. Research studies to be commissioned by the national CRITC, through \nthe project implementation unit at LIPI (PIU-LIPI), will include strategic studies of national \nsignificance such as those associated with policy development, biotechnology, climate change, \nfish stocks, trade in corals, trawling, biodiversity, and pollution. Research will focus on studies \nwith practical application in CBM, including coral reef ecology, ecological surveys of project \nsites, and socioeconomic surveys of target communities. \n \n22.  Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation (BME). LIPI will oversee the extension of the BME \nsystem and the Coral Reef Spatial Information System developed under Phase I to the Phase II \ndistricts and target sites to facilitate the evaluation of project impacts/benefits. BME will focus on \nquarterly creel surveys, semiannual reef health surveys, and socioeconomic surveys conducted \nevery  3  years,  each  providing  feedback  to  communities  and  partner  organizations  on  the \nprogress of project implementation. The national CRITC will play a key role in aggregating \nselected data to provide a \u201creport card\u201d on the state of coral reef ecosystems and resource use \nactivities every 3 years. The regional CRITCs will coordinate and maintain local information \nmanagement systems required for BME with the participation of village groups/associations and \nin conjunction with local government agencies, research/academic institutes, and NGOs. They \nwill also establish and develop BME for the Project\u2019s field operations and the associated Coral \nReef Spatial Information System, and provide technical advice and training to local agencies in \nthe use of these systems. \n \n23.  Information Management. The national CRITC will be set up as the national reference \npoint or clearinghouse for up-to-date information on coral reef management in the country. It will \nprovide technical support and guidance to the regional CRITCs in database development, \nmaintenance, and reporting, and collaborate with them in the development of an integrated \ninformation strategy and system design that will facilitate the flow and exchange of information \nbetween  project  locations  and  programs  and  with  partner  organizations.  At  each  regional ", "7 \nCRITC, an information unit will be set up to house a library and documentation center. The \nregional CRITCs will coordinate and maintain local information management systems with an \nemphasis on collation, packaging, and dissemination of technical information to the managers \ninvolved in national and district-wide planning, pilot initiatives, and CBM.  \n \nc.  Human Resources Development and Extension \n24.  HRD and Training. The Project will develop an HRD program for MMAF, LIPI, and \nregional agencies (such as dinas Kelautan Dan Perikanan [provincial/district Marine Affairs and \nFisheries Service] and BAPPEDA). The HRD program will be developed by senior management \nof MMAF/Directorate General of Coasts and Small Islands (DGCSI) and PMO with inputs from \nLIPI, the regional governments, and the RPIUs, and with the assistance of an international \ninstitutional development specialist. Districts with high degrees of ethnicity and remoteness will \nbe given priority by the Project\u2019s HRD and capacity-building programs. The Project will support \na wide range of national- and local-level training and village development. A master training plan \nwill be drawn up by MMAF/PMO and LIPI/PIU to be implemented by concerned government \nagencies  or  contracted  out  to  suitable  local  and  international  academic  institutes,  private \nconsulting firms, or NGOs. Training contractors will be engaged by MMAF/PMO for sector-\nrelated training or by LIPI/PIU for CRITC-related training.12  \n \n25.  The local training programs will consist of short courses, training workshops/seminars, \nexchange visits or study tours, and overseas and in-country fellowships. Training will cover a \nbroad range of subjects, including (i) management skills and systems, including participatory \ntechniques, policy development, project planning and management, monitoring, recording and \nreporting,  and  database  and  information  management;  (ii) marine  resource  management, \nincluding  legal  and  regulatory  aspects,  spatial  planning,  strategy  development,  CBM, \nenvironmental impact assessment, resource conservation and sustainable use, and species \nprotection; and (iii) community and social development, including microenterprise development, \nfinancial management, and community empowerment.  \n \n26.  Extension. The PMO will develop a comprehensive extension program to (i) equip local \nresource users and managers in coral reef management, (ii) strengthen coastal communities to \nmaster technical skills for livelihood development and income generation, (iii) disseminate the \nresults of CBM activities undertaken by the Project in target districts, and (iv) promote and \nfacilitate additional investment by the private sector in successful microenterprises pilot-tested \nat the core sites. The extension program, which will systematically target priority groups in each \ndistrict, will be implemented in cooperation or collaboration with regional sector agencies or \nexisting government extension programs in the project sites. The RPIUs will be responsible for \ncoordinating the delivery of extension services by extension personnel from the dinas Kelautan \nDan Perikanan and other regional government agencies, with the assistance of NGOs involved \nin community empowerment activities.  \n \nd.  Project Management Support \n27.  Management support will be provided to ensure timely and effective implementation of \nproject activities, as well as the cost-efficient utilization of funds and other project resources. \nProject management support will comprise (i) operations of a PMO in MMAF, an NPIU in LIPI, \n                                                 \n12  The training plan will include (i) areas for training, diploma, and degree programs to be selected; proposed \ninstitutions; and duration of training; (ii) the justification for selecting international institutions for short-term study \nvisits and the proposed competitive selection criteria for local training institutes and international academic \ninstitutions; and (iii) trainee selection criteria and proposed trainees. ", "8 \nand RPIUs in the six project districts; (ii) provision of specialist support through international \nconsulting  firms  and  associated  domestic  consultants;  (iii) engagement  of  NGOs,  local \nacademic and research institutes, and other contractors to carry out various project activities; \n(iv) provision  of  equipment,  vehicles,  and  supplies  and  materials;  and  (v) setting  up  of \naccounting, monitoring, and reporting systems. \n \n2.  Community-Based Resource Management and Development \n28.  Community  Empowerment.  The  RPIUs  will  contract  the  services  of  NGOs  and/or \nacademic institutions to assist in organizing, training, and empowering the local communities at \nthe project sites for coral reef management, and social and livelihood development.13 The NGOs \nwill carry out social preparation and community organizing activities and facilitate participatory \nplanning and decision making at the village level within the framework of an overall marine \naction strategy to ensure the consistency of interventions with project goals. They will also \nassist the village government in establishing a village representative forum (badan perwakilan \ndesa or BPD) or similar equivalent institutions, where none exists, and organize pokmas to \nserve as their counterparts in project implementation. Finally, the NGOs, jointly with government \nextension personnel, will provide training and technical/administrative support to the pokmas \nand other community groups to develop their capacity to organize, manage, and administer \nCBM and livelihood activities.  \n \n29.  Community Resource Management. The Project will support local communities in the \nmanagement  and  use  of  their  natural  resources  through  a  series  of  activities  in  the \nimplementation of CRMPs (para. 18). The CRMPs will be developed by the communities, with \nthe  assistance  of  NGOs  and  RPIUs,  and  will  contain  recommended  site-specific  resource \nmanagement strategies and corresponding CBM programs. The CRMPs, once approved by the \nlocal government, will be implemented by the pokmas and other local stakeholders under the \noverall supervision of the BPD and with assistance from the concerned RPIUs.  \n \n30.  Community  Social  Services  and  Infrastructure  Development.  The  Project  will \nprovide selected villages with assistance for village and community development projects to \nimprove community welfare, health and sanitation, and education. Potential village development \nprojects include (i) basic services such as potable water supply, solid waste management and \nsanitation  facilities,  primary  health  facilities,  and  support  to  primary  schools;  (ii) basic \ninfrastructure development like pathways, boat moorings, jetties, site and boundary markers, \nand village meeting places; and (iii) community environmental protection, rehabilitation, and \nenhancement  projects  such  as  soil  erosion  control,  village  tree  planting,  and  mangrove \nrestoration. The specific social services and infrastructure facilities to be provided to the target \nvillages  will  depend  on  the  identified  needs  of  the  local  communities,  as  gauged  through \nsocioeconomic and needs assessment surveys conducted by NGO contractors.14 \n \n31.  Community Livelihood and Income Generation. NGOs and government extension \nstaff will work closely with BPD and pokmas to assist the communities in upgrading their \nsocioeconomic  status.  More  specifically,  NGOs  and  extension  workers  will  (i) assist  the \n                                                 \n13  NGOs will be selected based on criteria including (i) geographic experience, (ii) work experience, (iii) technical and \nfinancial capacity, (iv) longevity, (v) recognition, (vi) gender orientation and experience in applying participatory \napproaches, and (vii) ethical practices. Out of two facilitators per village, one will be a woman. \n14  As the envisaged social infrastructure facilities are of a small scale and will be established on public land, no \nresettlement problems are anticipated. Nevertheless, PMO will develop detailed selection criteria for the location \nand type of facilities or interventions proposed for establishment to prevent resettlement-related problems during \nproject implementation. ", "9 \norganized groups or interested private individuals in identifying, developing, pilot-testing, and \nimplementing microenterprises and other livelihood opportunities in the area;15 (ii) provide the \norganized community groups with extensive technical support services, including skills training \nand extension, in particular, to transform them into microentrepreneurs; (iii) promote group \nsavings mobilization; (iv) link potential borrowers to existing microfinancing schemes that could \nbe tapped for identified income-generating projects; and (v) provide marketing assistance and \nlinkages with input suppliers and output buyers. \n \n32.  NGOs or other training contractors will provide training to the organized community \ngroups and interested individuals in credit management, entrepreneurial skills, and business \nmanagement and operation. The NGOs will also disseminate information on existing microcredit \nschemes  in  the  project  provinces  and  districts  to  the  BPD,  pokmas,  other  groups  and \nindividuals,  and  assist  them  in  preparing  project  proposals  for  funding  through  suitable \nmicrocredit  facilities.16  The  Project  will  also  assist  small  producers,  processors,  and  other \nmicroentrepreneurs through an inputs assistance program to be operated using a part of the \nADB loan proceeds.17 \n \nC.  Special Features \n33.  The Project will adopt a holistic approach to the management of coastal resources, \nparticularly coral reefs and associated ecosystems. It will focus on few key provinces where the \ncosts of delaying, and the benefits from expediting, such a project are greatest. The Project will \nbe nationally coordinated but implemented under a decentralized management, with the bulk of \nits capacity-building efforts to take place at the district (kabupaten) level and, to a lesser degree, \nat the province level. Close coordination and effective linkages will be established between \nnational,  regional,  and  local  governments  within  the  context  of  their  defined  roles  and \nresponsibilities in project implementation. Finally, the Project will adopt a participatory process \napproach by which coastal communities will have the opportunity to organize themselves with \nthe assistance of project facilitators, identify their specific needs, and plan and implement their \ncommunity-specific resource management and livelihood programs based on their own needs. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates  \n34.   The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies and interest during \nconstruction,  is  estimated  at  $41.25 million  equivalent,  comprising  a  foreign  exchange \ncomponent of $8.27 million (20% of total cost) and a local cost of $32.98 million equivalent (80% \nof total cost). The estimates include the provision for $0.92 million equivalent in taxes and \nduties. The cost estimates are summarized in Table 1, and details are in Appendix 5.  \n \n                                                 \n15  Some  35  different  types  of  microenterprises  have  been  identified  during  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance as having potential for development under the Project. These include, among others, brick making, \nbackyard farming, poultry and livestock operation, goat fattening, fish processing (e.g., pindang, fish crackers), \nmariculture, seaweed farming, and ecotourism.  \n16  ADB-financed Rural Income Generation Project (Loan No. 1583-INO). \n17  Essential items of equipment will be allocated to qualified and approved candidates on condition that they return \none set of the equipment (or products of equivalent value) for transfer to other beneficiaries. The items involved in \nthis program will vary from one site to the other, but may include insulated fish boxes for fish transport, solar \ndriers, pindang boilers, hand casts, pearl or seaweed rafts, and fish cages (Supplementary Appendix C).

Financing Plan \n35.  In view of Indonesia\u2019s economic difficulties and fiscal constraints in the short to medium \nterm, the Government requested that ADB\u2019s share in project financing be increased from 60% to \n80%.  Although  Indonesia\u2019s  economic  recovery  continues,  the  economic  situation  remains \ndifficult and the fiscal situation is expected to remain unfavorable over the medium term. In view \nof this and the core poverty intervention nature of the Project, ADB\u2019s cost-sharing of 80% of \nproject financing is reasonable.  \n \n36.  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  to  Indonesia  in  the  amount  of  $33 million \nequivalent (80% of the total project cost) from its Special Funds resources to finance the entire \nforeign exchange cost of $8.27 million equivalent and a portion of the local currency cost \namounting  to  $24.73 million  equivalent  (75%  of  total  local  costs).  The  loan  will  have  an \namortization period of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of \n1% per year on principal amount disbursed during the grace period, and 1.5% per year during \nthe remaining amortization period. The remaining local currency cost of $8.25 million equivalent \nwill be financed by the Government and project beneficiaries. The government contribution will \ncome from the central Government and the governments of the three provinces and six districts. \nBeneficiaries\u2019 contribution will be in the form of labor for community-based law enforcement, \nconstruction and improvement of various small-scale infrastructure facilities and access roads, \nand livelihood development activities.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management and Coordination \n37.  Executing and Implementing Agencies. MMAF will be the Executing Agency (EA) for \nthe  Project,  and  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  the  coordination,  supervision,  and \nimplementation of all project activities. MMAF has the mandate for marine and coastal resource \nmanagement in the country, and is the EA for the ongoing Coastal Community Development \nand Fisheries Resource Management Project (Loans 1570/1571 [SF]-INO) and the Marine and \nCoastal  Resources  Management  Project  (Loan  1770  [SF]-INO).  Although  the  Ministry  was \ncreated only in 1999, MMAF has a strong group of senior fisheries and resource management \nspecialists who have accumulated extensive experience in implementing and monitoring ADB-\nfunded projects under the Directorate General of Fisheries. The following four directorates \ngeneral will be working closely with each other to implement the Project: (i) Coasts and Small \nIslands,  (ii) Capture  Fisheries,  (iii) Aquaculture,  and  (iv) Marine  Resource  and  Fisheries \nControlling.  LIPI  will  be  the  national  Implementing  Agency  (IA)  responsible  for  the  overall \ncoordination  of  CRITC  operation,  including  information,  monitoring,  research,  and  training. \nOther  IAs  include  the  provincial  and  district  government  agencies  in  the  project  areas, \nparticularly BAPPEDA and dinas Kelautan Dan Perikanan. The national CRITC that has been \nset up at LIPI will be the lead IA for research, training, and information management.  \n \n38.  PMO and PIUs. To oversee the day-to-day implementation of the Project, a PMO will be \nset up within DGCSI. The PMO will be headed by a full-time project director who will report to \nthe director general, DGCSI. It will have adequate qualified technical and administrative staff \nand will be provided with the necessary office and communications equipment and vehicles. It \nwill  have  the  following  responsibilities:  (i) planning  and  scheduling  of  project  activities; \n(ii) administration  of  contracting  activities  for  national  activities;  (iii) bookkeeping  and \nmaintenance  of  Project  accounts  and  preparation  and  consolidation  of  liquidation  reports; \n(iv) supervision and monitoring of the work program of the entire Project and preparation of \nconsolidated monitoring reports; (v) serving as secretariat to the National Steering Committee \n(NSC)  and  National  Technical  Committee  (NTC);  (vi) coordination  of  field  activities;  and \n(vii) liaison with ADB. \n \n39.  One  national  and  six  regional  PIUs  will  be  set  up  to  oversee  and  coordinate  the \nimplementation of project activities in the field. The PIU-LIPI will be set up in LIPI and the RPIUs ", "12 \nwill be established at the district governments in the six project districts. The RPIUs will work \nvery closely with the bupati and district staff from the sector line agencies as well as with village \ngovernment heads at the core sites. The PIU-LIPI and RPIUs will be responsible for (i) planning \nthe  work  program,  administering  contracting  services,  maintaining  project  accounts  for \nmonitoring project expenses, and preparing liquidation reports; (ii) supervising and monitoring \nthe work program for specific components and activities and preparing local progress and \nmonitoring reports; (iii) providing technical advice and assistance to local government agencies \non the technical aspects of the Project; and (iv) coordinating the specific national and local \nactivities of the different project implementers. \n \n40.  National Steering Committee (NSC). This will be established to guide the overall \ndirection of the Project and ensure overall coordination of activities. The NSC will be chaired by \nBAPPENAS and include the director general, DGCSI, as secretariat. Other NSC members will \ninclude representatives of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), LIPI, State Ministry of Environment, \nMinistry of Forestry, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Cooperatives and Small Enterprise \nDevelopment, Ministry of Health, and the Navy. The NSC will provide policy guidance as \nneeded to follow up on policy and legal work, resolve any interagency problems, and formulate \nsolutions to impediments to project implementation. It will meet at least quarterly in the first 2 \nyears  of  implementation  and  semi-annually  thereafter.  The  NSC  will  be  assisted  by  NTC \ncomprising the technical staff of NSC members, whose chairperson will act as secretary to the \nNSC. The proposed project organization structure is shown in Appendix 6.  \n \n41.  Regional Advisory Committee (RAC). This will be established in project provinces, \nheaded  by  the  chairperson  of  provincial  BAPPEDA  and  composed  of  representatives  of \nconcerned  sector  agencies,  local  government  agencies,  NGOs,  and  community-based \norganizations (CBOs). The RAC will oversee local project coordination between participating \nagencies at the local level and liaise with the NSC as required. The RAC will meet at least \nquarterly each year. \n \n2.  Implementation Schedule \n42.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  6-year  period  (2003\u20132008).  The  project \nimplementation schedule is shown in Appendix 7. \n \n3.  Procurement \n43.  The PMO, NPIU, and the PIUs will be responsible for the procurement of all goods and \nrelated services and civil works under their respective areas of supervision (Appendix 8). All \nservices, supplies, and equipment to be financed by ADB will be procured in accordance with \nthe ADB Guidelines for Procurement. All goods to be purchased through local competitive \nbidding  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  Government  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nEquipment and materials for packages valued at $500,000 or more will be procured through \ninternational competitive bidding procedures. Some supply contracts and certain specialized \nitems estimated to cost at $500,000 or less will be procured using international shopping \nprocedures.  Minor  items  of  equipment  and  materials  costing  at  $100,000  or  less  will  be \nprocured through direct purchase. The civil works packages, which are estimated to cost less \nthan  $1 million  each,  will  be  awarded  using  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  among \nprequalified contractors in accordance with the Government\u2019s standard procurement procedures \nacceptable to ADB. The EA and IAs were advised of the need to maintain transparency and \naccountability, as required under ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy, in procuring goods and services. \n ", "13 \n4.  Consulting Services \n44.  Two  groups  of  consultants  will  be  engaged  to  assist  PMO  and  LIPI  in  project \nmanagement and CRITC operation, respectively. The total consultant input for both groups is \nestimated  at  534  person-months,  consisting  of  54  international  and  480  domestic  person-\nmonths. The outline terms of reference of the consultants are in Appendix 9. The consultants \nwill be selected following the quality and cost-based selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. The Project will also engage NGOs and academic \ninstitutions to organize and assist local communities in undertaking resource management and \nsocial development activities in the project districts and in accessing existing microfinance \nschemes operating in those areas for income generation projects to be promoted under the \nProject.  The  NGOs  and  academic  institutions  will  be  selected  on  a  competitive  basis  in \naccordance  with  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  Project  will  also  contract  qualified \ndomestic academic/research institutions and consulting firms to carry out various research, \nspecial studies, surveys, and training programs in accordance with competitive selection criteria \nand procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements and Funds Flow \n45.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook. The commitment, direct payment, imprest fund, and reimbursement procedures will \nbe required by the Project. The Government will, immediately after the loan becomes effective, \nestablish a special account with Bank Indonesia (BI) to expedite disbursement of loan proceeds, \nparticularly for expenditures under small contracts. The special account will be established, \nmanaged, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \nThe initial deposit will be based on the estimated expenditures for a 6-month period, but will not \nexceed the equivalent of $1.5 million. The statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure will be \nused to replenish and liquidate the special account and to reimburse eligible expenditures up to \na maximum amount of $100,000 per expenditure. ADB reserves the right to conduct spot or \nrandom checks of expenditures covered by SOE through disbursement or review missions. \nNotwithstanding  the  Government\u2019s  own  disbursement  procedures,  sufficient  supporting \ndocumentation, as defined in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, must be kept at each level \nof project management to substantiate all expenditures incurred from the loan proceeds. The \nflow of funds is illustrated in Appendix 10. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n46.  The PMO, PIUs, and other agencies involved in project implementation will prepare and \nmaintain separate accounts exclusively for the Project and will register in such accounts all \nreceipts and payments for the Project in accordance with sound accounting principles and \nprocedures. The accounts and financial statements for each fiscal year, including the special \naccount and the SOE records, will be audited by the sovereign audit agency of the Government \nor other auditors acceptable to ADB, in accordance with appropriate auditing principles. The \nPMO will review and consolidate the accounts from the various agencies and, after audit, submit \nthem to MOF and ADB. The audit report will include a statement verifying that funds disbursed \nby ADB against the SOEs were used for the purposes for which they were provided. Project \naccounts, including financial statements, SOEs, and special account records, together with \ndisbursement documents, will be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB, \nand will be submitted to ADB not later than 9 months after the end of each fiscal year. The \nauditor\u2019s report will also include the auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the special account and the \nSOE procedure. Both the financial statements and the auditor\u2019s report will be in English. The ", "14 \nGovernment and MMAF were informed of ADB policy on submission of audited accounts, which \ncovers failure to submit audited accounts and financial statements within the due time. A formal \nwarning will be issued for accounts more than 6 months overdue, and disbursements will be \nsuspended for accounts that are 12 months overdue. \n \n47.  Reporting systems will be set up at the national, regional, and local levels to enable \nDGCSI, through the PMO, to effectively supervise the implementation of all project activities and \nprovide timely advice and support to the PIUs. The PMO will be responsible for (i) collecting and \nconsolidating all project progress reports, site reports, technical and financial reports, and their \nsubmission to ADB; and (ii) preparing quarterly progress reports, the midterm project evaluation \nreport, and the overall project completion report. The PIUs will be responsible for (i) preparing \nproject  progress,  technical,  and  financial  reports  covering  site-specific  activities;  and \n(ii) collecting and consolidating field data and feedback from local participating agencies and \ncontractors that, in turn, will be relayed to the PMO. \n \n48.  The PMO will furnish quarterly progress reports to ADB on project implementation, to be \nsubmitted within 1 month of the end of the quarter to which they relate, and such other reports \nand information relating to the Project as ADB may reasonably request. Within 3 months of the \nphysical completion of the Project, the PMO will submit a project completion report to the NSC \nand ADB. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n49.  MMAF and LIPI will establish an appropriate project performance monitoring system in \nPMO within 1 year of loan effectiveness. The system will encompass monitoring (i) physical and \nfinancial progress as well as the economy and efficiency of key activities such as recruitment of \nconsultants,  procurement  of  equipment  and  materials,  training  arrangements,  conduct  of \nsurveys and special studies, policy development, drafting of implementation guidelines; (ii)  the \nlevel and adequacy of participation of various stakeholders, including local communities, in \nproject activities, particularly those related to natural resources planning and management and \nsocial development; (iii) the Project\u2019s social, environmental, and economic impact, including the \nestablishment of benchmark information and data; and (iv) assessing the effectiveness and \nutilization of CRITC networking; and (v) developing a mechanism for incorporating lessons \nlearned from similar projects in the sector in project planning. \n \n50.  With the supervision of PMO and PIU-LIPI staff, contracted consultants will design and \nundertake a baseline survey. This survey will be repeated at midterm and at project completion, \nto provide information necessary to evaluate the financial, economic, social and environmental \nimpacts of the Project. At the community level, participatory monitoring and evaluation will be \nintroduced as part of the Project\u2019s comprehensive participatory development approach. Special \nstudies  may  be  conducted  to  investigate  issues  relating  to  project  implementation  and  its \nimpacts. For periodic monitoring, key indicators will be developed and incorporated in the \nregular reporting system. PMO and PIU-LIPI staff will make regular visits to the field sites to \nmonitor progress. Project monitoring and evaluation reports will be submitted by the PMO to \nADB on a quarterly basis. On project completion, the impacts of the Project will be evaluated \naccording to a schedule and the terms of reference to be agreed upon by the Government and \nADB. \n ", "15 \n8.  Project Review \n51.  At the start of the fourth year of implementation, a comprehensive midterm review of the \nProject will be carried out to identify any problems and constraints encountered and assess the \nneed  for  mid-course  modification  of  the  project  scope  and  implementation  arrangements. \nTechnical and budgetary changes to the project document, requested or arising from project \nperformance monitoring system findings, will also be considered, as will be the inclusion of \nadditional  activities  at  any  of  the  field  sites  or  the  consideration  of  possible  expansion  of \nactivities/sites over the remaining project life.   \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Financial and Economic Analysis  \n1.  Financial and Economic Analysis of Indicative Microenterprises \n52.  The Project will promote the establishment and development of microenterprises and \nincome-generating  activities  by  providing  technical  skills  development  and  financial \nmanagement support program for its 90 target coastal communities.18 To determine the viability \nof potential microenterprises, four representative microenterprises were subjected to financial \nanalysis at the farm level.19 The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) and the economic internal \nrate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  these  microenterprises  were  greater  than  the  estimated  weighted \naverage cost of capital of 16% and the social cost of capital of 12%. Details are in Appendix 11; \nfurther details are in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n2.  Economic Analysis \n53.  The Project\u2019s major quantifiable economic benefits are envisaged from (i) rehabilitation \nof  coral  reefs  in  areas  previously  degraded  through  the  establishment  of  erosion  control \nstructures, artificial reefs, marine protected areas, fish restocking, and mangrove reforestation to \nrestore  the  abundance  of  commercially  important  reef  and  fish  resources;  (ii) reduction  in \ndestructive fishing and overfishing through effective information and education campaigns and \nmonitoring, control, and surveillance activities; (iii) establishment of basic social services and \ninfrastructure development to promote the socioeconomic well-being of the coastal communities \nto complement the conservation efforts of the Project; and (iv) establishment of microenterprises \nto improve the income-earning capacity of fisherfolk, thereby contributing to poverty reduction in \ncommunities that rely on reef resources for food and income.  \n \n54.  The Project is expected to realize an EIRR of 19%. At a discount rate of 12%, the \nresulting net present value showed that the Project is expected to generate approximately \n$32.4 million for the economy. Sensitivity analysis indicated that it would take a 56% increase in \nproject cost and a decrease in project benefits, global benefits, and microenterprise benefits of \n36%, 35%, and 35%, respectively, for the EIRR to decline to the cutoff level of 12% (Appendix \n11). \n \n                                                 \n18  The Project will not directly finance the operation of microenterprises and income-generating activities, but will \nprovide rigorous social preparation and technical demonstration activities to be carried out within the Village \nDevelopment Plan framework. Prior to being widely promoted in the project target communities, the financial \nviability of each type of enterprise will be assessed through feasibility and market analyses. \n19  These microenterprises include (i) mud crab fattening, (ii) estuarine grouper cage culture, (iii) seaweed culture, \nand (iv) fish cracker making. ", "16 \nB.  Social Measures and Impact on Poverty20 \n55.  Population Size and Social Stratification. The total population in the six target districts \nin the project area is 1.8 million in 360,000 households with an average household size of five \nmembers. Poverty is widespread in the coastal villages of the project area. The incidence of \npoverty ranges from a high of 83% in Nias to a low of 41% in Kepulauan Riau. Of the total \ncoastal households, about 53% fall below the poverty threshold, 13% are very poor, 40% poor, \nand about 16% are low income earners. The remaining coastal households, accounting for 31% \nof the total, are made up of moderate (11%) and high (20%) income earners, with earnings \ngreater than Rp4.86 million (or $486) per year. Those that fall below the poverty threshold are \ncomposed mostly of small fishers, fish processors, and workers in the fishing industry and allied \nfields, while the high income earners are businesspeople, landowners, big boat and plant \nowners, and successful entrepreneurs. The high household incidence of poverty is evident in \nthe existence of the Government\u2019s Inpres Desa Tertinggal (IDT) program for alleviating poverty \nin most of the villages in the project area. Most of the households in the target communities do \nnot have the capacity to increase their household income from fishing, as most of their fishing \ngrounds are overfished and have damaged coral reefs. In addition, as most do not have access \nto improved fishing gears and boats, they are limited from exploring new fishing grounds or \nopportunities to increase their fish catch and income.  \n \n56.  Lack of Access to Basic Services. Human development is weak in the proposed \nproject sites, with the coastal residents having limited education and limited access to basic \nsocial  services  such  as  potable  water  supply,  sewerage  and  sanitation,  electricity,  and \ntransportation. In many villages, only elementary schools are available, and some do not have \nany schools at all. The Project will support the establishment of basic services such as potable \nwater supply, sewerage and sanitation facilities, primary school facilities, and village meeting \nplaces in villages where such basic amenities are lacking or inadequate. \n \n57.  Gender. Gender bias is strong in some places. The educational levels of males and \nfemales are generally unequal, with men having a somewhat higher educational attainment than \nwomen. Credit is also generally given to men, especially by the formal financial institutions, \nsince they are considered the breadwinners. A gender action plan will delineate how the Project \nwill  encourage  women\u2019s  participation  in  setting  up,  operating,  and  managing  small-scale \nincome-generating  projects.  The  PMO  and  the  PIUs  will  ensure  that  the  formation  and \nstrengthening of CBOs will give equitable opportunities for membership and representation of \nwomen and for women to assume leadership functions in the organizations. They will also \nensure that training courses are scheduled with special consideration given to women\u2019s needs. \nGender-disaggregated  data  will  be  collected  through  the  baseline  project  performance \nmonitoring system survey and in subsequent surveys; gender indicators will be included in the \nproject performance monitoring system. \n \n58.  Indigenous  Peoples.  An  Indigenous  Peoples\u2019  Development  Framework  has  been \nprepared  for  the  Suku  Mentawai  people,  and  the  summary  is  available  in  Supplementary \nAppendix H. The Framework ensures participation of indigenous peoples to fully benefit from \nthe Project and guarantees that procedures for grievance redress are in place and functioning in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples.  \n \n59.  Impact  on  Poverty  and  Social  Development.  The  Project  will  address  poverty \nconcerns  through  its  core  development  activities  of  (i) community  empowerment  and \n                                                 \n20  More detailed information is provided in Appendix 12 and Supplementary Appendixes G\u2013I. ", "17 \ninstitutional  development  and  (ii) sustainable  livelihood  and  income  generation  to  enhance \nwelfare, thereby reducing exploitation pressure on coral reefs. Communities will be empowered \nand trained to manage, control, and utilize reef resources in a sustainable manner, and will be \nprovided  with  (i) basic  services;  (ii) basic  infrastructure  development;  and  (iii) community \nenvironmental protection, rehabilitation, and enhancement projects. However, participation in \nthe Project by beneficiary communities will be purely on voluntary basis. The Project will not \nimpose any specific income-generating activities. Individuals will be given training and help in \nobtaining funding but will not be given outright grants. Prior to the implementation of activities at \nproject sites, the communities will engage in a comprehensive planning process that identifies \nconstraints, risks, and opportunities. It will also ensure that indigenous peoples are consulted on \nactivity development and are able to participate fully in and obtain benefits from the planning \nand implementation of community empowerment activities, particularly from the establishment \nof required basic services. \n \nC.  Environment \n60.  An initial environmental examination conducted during project preparation concluded \nthat  a  few  adverse  impacts  could  result  from  some  income-generating  projects,  such  as \nmariculture, and the construction of small-scale social infrastructure facilities (Appendix 13 and \nSupplementary Appendix J). However, these potential negative impacts are small, localized, \nand can be avoided or mitigated by appropriate measures. None of the proposed interventions \nis  environmentally  critical  or  anticipated  to  create  significant  adverse  impacts  on  the \nenvironment. Instead, the Project is likely to bring about significant environmental and co-\ndependent social benefits associated with coastal resource management policy development \nand  implementation,  institutional  development  of  government  agencies  and  community \norganizations, and community empowerment for resource management and socioeconomic \ndevelopment. \n \n61.  A detailed environmental management and monitoring plan will be formulated in the first \nyear of project implementation with the assistance of an environment specialist. The plan will \noutline the general guidelines and procedures for environmental screening, scoping, and review \nof proposed project activities in line with ADB and government guidelines. The regional CRITCs \nwill be specifically responsible for environmental monitoring and will be provided with necessary \nequipment and personnel for the task. Environmental considerations will be included in the \nselection criteria for specific sites for the establishment of mariculture and other projects to \nensure that none of these is set up in environmentally critical or sensitive areas, such as marine \nparks  or  protected  areas.  Private  contractors  engaged  for  the  construction  of  social \ninfrastructure facilities will be properly oriented on the need for environmental safeguards and \nwill actively participate in environmental monitoring. This will ensure that any potential adverse \nenvironmental impact is minimized and that project activities fully conform to the environmental \nguidelines of the Government and ADB. \n \nD.  Risks \n62.  The Project faces certain risks that could adversely affect project implementation and the \nattainment of project objectives. These are: (i) the slow growth of corals that could delay the \nrealization of project targets; (ii) institutional inadequacies in the EA and IAs, as well as CBOs \nand  the  communities  themselves,  for  their  roles  in  coastal  resource  management; \n(iii) uncertainties  emanating  from  the  evolving  decentralization  process  and  institutional \narrangements at the provincial and district levels; (iv) persistence of nonadaptive, control-based \nattitudes  on  the  part  of  national  government  agencies;  and  (v) government  limitations  in ", "18 \nproviding adequate financial and human resources for continued implementation of project \nactivities and facilities beyond the term of the Project.  \n \n63.  To  minimize  these  risks,  the  following  countermeasures  have  been  incorporated  in \nproject design: (i) the adoption of a reasonable target of 2% coral growth per year in the project \nframework; (ii) inclusion of a substantial institutional development and project management \ncomponent in the Project; (iii) adoption of a \u201clearning approach\u201d to project implementation, \nwhereby resource management initiatives will first be pilot-tested in core sites prior to expansion \nto other sites; (iv) formation of an NSC, RACs, and a network of CRITCs; (v) establishment of \ninteragency linkages and close working relationships among NGOs/CBOs, local extension staff, \nlocal government agencies, and participating coastal communities; (vi) the use of a participatory \napproach and extensive networking and interaction among the different project implementers \nand stakeholders; (vii) provision of long-term project management consultants to assist and \nsupport PMO and the PIUs in project implementation; and (viii) design and implementation of an \neffective  monitoring  and  reporting  system  to  obtain  prompt  feedback  and  enable  timely \nremedies. ADB will also strengthen its supervision of the Project, including semi-annual reviews \nin the initial years, to identify problems and recommend modifications in project design and \nimplementation  arrangements,  as  required.  Most  importantly,  a  strong  commitment  was \nobtained from MMAF management to support the Project, oversee project implementation, and \nprovide counterpart funding for project activities. Overall, the participatory approaches and \nsocial preparation activities, together with the technical soundness of the proposed resource \nmanagement interventions, will result in the expected benefits and impacts exceeding the costs. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n64.  The Government has given the following specific assurances, in addition to the standard \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Prior  to  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  establish  (i) a  national-level \ninteragency NSC to guide the overall direction and coordination of the Project; \nand (ii) an RAC in each of the three project provinces.  \n \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that during each year of project implementation, \nadequate budgetary allocation of all necessary counterpart funds will be provided \nin  a  timely  manner  and,  to  such  end,  the  Government  will  make  timely \nsubmissions of annual budgetary appropriation requests, including funding for \nannual  operation  and  maintenance  expenditures  required  after  project \ncompletion.  The  Government  will  further  take  all  necessary  or  appropriate \nmeasures for prompt disbursement of appropriated funds on a timely and regular \nbasis  to  the  PMO,  PIU-LIPI,  and  RPIUs  during  each  year  of  project \nimplementation.  \n \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that the proceeds of the loan and the corresponding \namounts of necessary counterpart funds will be disbursed to the PMO, PIU-LIPI, \nand the RPIUs for the respective project districts, by budgetary transfer of funds \nearmarked for such purpose.  \n \n(iv)  The Government will ensure that the provision of funds from the proceeds of the \nloan, and the corresponding counterpart contributions necessary for financing \nproject activities, will continue throughout the period of project implementation \nnotwithstanding (i) any reallocation of authority or responsibility for channeling of ", "19 \nexternal  assistance  and  for  the  provision  of  corresponding  counterpart \ncontributions between the Government, PMO, PIU-LIPI, project provinces, and \nproject districts; or (ii) any requirement for the provision of matching counterpart \ncontributions  for  funding  project  activities  from  project  provinces  or  project \ndistricts arising out of the implementation of Laws 22 and 25, unless otherwise \nagreed by ADB. \n \n(v)  The Government will ensure, or will cause the project provinces and project \ndistricts  to  ensure,  that  the  gender  action  plan  developed  for  the  Project  is \ncomplied with, so that there will be (i) equal opportunity for men and women in all \nproject activities; (ii) formation and strengthening of CBOs under the Project with \nequal opportunity for men and women to be members and assume leadership \nfunctions; (iii) prioritized appointment of women as managerial staff to the PMO, \nPIU-LIPI, and RPIUs; (iv) prioritized fielding of women as community organizers \nby NGOs under the Project; (v) inclusion of women in national and regional \npublic  sector  institutions  in  training  programs  under  the  Project;  and \n(vi) preference for women project beneficiaries in microenterprise training, with \ninclusion of access to women as a criterion for all training courses under the \nProject. \n \n(vi)  The Government will ensure, or will cause the project provinces and project \ndistricts to ensure, that no persons will be adversely affected according to the \nterms of ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy. By the end of the first year of \nproject  implementation,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  the  PMO  will  have \ndeveloped detailed site selection criteria for community infrastructure facilities to \nbe financed under the loan to screen out the possibility of any losses occurring \nthat would require an application of ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy.  \n \n(vii)  The Government will ensure, or will cause the project provinces and project \ndistricts to ensure, that an environmental management and monitoring plan will \nbe prepared by the PMO, with assistance of an environmental specialist, within \nthe  first  year  of  project  implementation,  and  will  include  an  outline  of  the \nguidelines and procedures for environmental screening, scooping and review of \nproject  activities,  in  accordance  with  ADB  and  government  environmental \nguidelines. \n \n(viii)  The Government will ensure, or cause the project provinces and project districts \nto  ensure,  that  under  the  Project  there  will  be  continued  operation  and \nmaintenance by villages of social infrastructure constructed under the Project \nthrough (i) counterpart support in cash or in kind and (ii) a memorandum of \nunderstanding  between  each  village  organization  and  the  respective  RPIU \ndetailing the obligations of the village for routine maintenance activities.

Coastal Resources of Indonesia: An Overview \n1.  Indonesia is the world\u2019s largest archipelagic nation, with a marine area of 5.8 million \nsquare kilometers (km2), comprising 3.1 million km2 of territorial and archipelagic seas and \n2.7 million km2 of exclusive economic zone. With an 81,000-km coastline and 17,508 islands, \nmuch of it fringed by coral reef, Indonesia is truly a maritime continent rich in reef resources. \nThe coral reefs cover 42,000 km2 or 16.5% of the global areas of coral reefs. In contrast, its land \nmass occupies only 1.9 million km2. Indonesia is the coral biodiversity center of the world with \n70 genera and 450 species of corals.1 These resources support many coastal communities, \nartisan fisheries as well as industrial fisheries. In 1997, the total product of coastal and marine \neconomic activities was estimated at some 25\u201330% of Indonesia\u2019s gross domestic product, \nproviding employment for about 20 million people.  \n \n2.  Indonesia\u2019s seas have about 20,000 species of mollusks, 2,000 species of crustaceans, \nsix species of sea turtles, 30 species of marine mammals, and over 8,500 species of fish. No \ncomprehensive survey has been carried out in recent years to assess the current state of these \nliving aquatic resources, but it is believed that continued stress threatens the existence of many \nspecies. To protect marine biodiversity, the Government has planned to identify and designate \n30 million hectares (ha) for marine conservation by the year 2000, but only a fraction of this area \nhas so far been identified and is being conserved. \n \n3.  Despite the importance of coral reef ecosystems to global biodiversity and to Indonesia\u2019s \neconomy and environment, this resource has not been managed sustainably. Resource use and \nexploitation have led to extensive coastal zone degradation, i.e., the destruction of coral reefs \nand important associated seagrass and mangrove ecosystems, depletion of fish stocks, water \npollution, and biodiversity loss. Coral reefs are deteriorating rapidly, mainly because of intensive \nhuman activities such as coral mining, blast and cyanide fishing, sedimentation, tourist activities, \ncoastal development, and pollution. Using a measure of live coral cover, a national survey in \n1994  found  that  only  30%  remained  in  good  to  excellent  condition.  Global  warming  and \nassociated coral bleaching, plus increased reliance on coastal fishing, have further damaged \nthe nation\u2019s reefs. Since coral reefs are habitats of about 90% of the fish caught by the coastal \nfishers in the country, their degradation results in rapid decrease of fisheries production in \ncoastal areas.  \n \n4.  The coastal environment has also been affected by land-based activities. Watershed \ndeforestation and erosion have led to increased sedimentation on fringing coral reefs, adversely \naffecting fisheries resources. Industrial and urban wastes and runoff containing chemicals and \npesticides  from  agricultural  land  have  polluted  coastal  waters  and  impaired  the  ecological \nfunctions of coral reefs as nursery and breeding grounds for marine aquatic resources. An Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)-assisted study2 confirmed serious depletion of fisheries resources in \nthe coastal regions of Sumatra, North Java, and the straits of Malacca and Makassar. The \ndegradation of coastal and marine resources, including coral reefs, poses a serious threat to \nIndonesia\u2019s rich and unique marine biodiversity.  \n \n5.  Coral reef degradation and environmental problems in the coastal zone have affected \nthe livelihoods of coastal people, particularly artisan fishers. Artisan fishing is the occupation of \nlast resort for many poor people in the country due to population growth, decreased availability \n                                                 \n1  Veron.

", "  Appendix 2  27 \nof farmland and uncontrolled access to fish resources. Consequently, the number of coastal \nfishers increased by more than 50% over the past decade. Because of a deteriorating fisheries \nresource base, fish catch per unit of effort has been steadily declining, adversely affecting \nincomes. The average income of coastal fishers is below the average national level. Various \nstudies show that the coastal fishing communities are among the poorest segments of society in \nthe country. They lack access to basic social infrastructure such as clean water, sanitation, \nhealth care, roads, and transportation, and fail to benefit from formal credit facilities because \nthey lack credit history and collateral. \n \nB.  Planning and Management Framework \n6.  Legal  and  Policy  Framework.  The  Indonesian  Constitution  requires  that  natural \nresources be managed to achieve the greatest possible benefit for the people. A number of laws \nrelevant to coral reef ecosystems have been passed by the legislature. The three primary laws \nare (i) Fisheries Act No. 9 of 1985, (ii) Conservation of Living Resources and their Ecosystems \nAct No. 5 of 1990, and (iii) Forestry Act of 1967. Other laws include (i) Environment Act No. 4 of \n1982, (ii) Spatial Planning Act No. 24 of 1992,3 and (iii) Environmental Management Act No. 23 \nof 1997. Indonesia is also a signatory to a number of international declarations on natural \nresources  and  environmental  management,  and  has  issued  laws  ratifying  some  of  these \ndeclarations. These include (i) the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, \n(ii) UN  Convention  of  the  Law  of  the  Sea  (UNCLOS)  (1982),  (iii) International  Maritime \nOrganization laws on marine pollution (1969, 1971, 1989), (iv) the Global Program of Action for \nthe  Protection  of  the  Marine  Environment  from  Land-Based  Activities,  and  (iv) the  Global \nConvention on Biological Diversity (1992). These agreements have been supplemented by \nregulations setting out basic sector policies on mining, fisheries, forestry, and environment. \nThere  are,  in  addition,  customary  local  laws  governing  the  allocation  and  use  of  natural \nresources, but these laws are now seldom applied or observed. The enforcement of laws and \nregulations has, however, been weak and many resource allocation and resource use decisions \nwere taken at high levels of Government without proper consultation with local governments and \naffected communities. \n \n7.  Law 22/1999 on Regional Governance and Law 25/1999 on Financial Balance between \nCentral and Regional Governments seek to address these weaknesses and have added a new \ndimension to governance and natural resources planning and management. Law 22 aims to \ndecentralize most government services and to devolve planning and management functions and \nresponsibilities for marine and coastal resources within Indonesia\u2019s territorial waters to the \nprovincial  and  district  governments.  It  also  provides  incentives  to  local  governments  for \nsustainable management of natural resources within their respective jurisdictions and requires a \nrevision of some existing laws and regulations to bring them into harmony with it.  \n \n8.  A  National  Strategy  and  Action  Plan  for  Coral  Reef  Ecosystem  Conservation  and \nManagement was issued by the Ministry of Environment in 1992. The document lists the priority \nobjectives on coral reef management as: (i)  improving community awareness and participation, \n(ii) increasing the coverage of marine conservation areas and improving the monitoring and \nmanagement  of  existing  areas,  (iii) establishing  spatial  planning  and  zoning  to  prevent \noverexploitation, (iv) improving coordination among relevant agencies, and (v) establishing a \ncoordinated research program on coral reefs and associated ecosystems. A National Coral Reef \nPolicy was also drafted under Phase I of the Project, but is yet to be operationalized at the \nregional level. \n                                                 \n3  The Act, which provides the framework and legal basis for natural resources planning and resource allocation, \nneeds to be amended for consistency with provisions of recent laws on decentralization. ", "28  Appendix 2 \n \n9.  Institutional Framework. The Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) was \nestablished in 1999, with a pronounced vision of the sea as the nation\u2019s future. The Government \nhas targeted to establish and manage 10 million ha of marine conservation areas in accordance \nwith  the  Biodiversity  Action  Plan  of  1993.  Within  MMAF,  a  Directorate  General  of  Marine \nResources  and  Fisheries  Controlling  (DGMRFC)  was  established  exclusively  for  protecting \nmarine reserves and enforcing laws and regulations in harvesting marine resources, including \nthe coral reefs. In addition to MMAF, however, there are other agencies involved in regulating \nand promoting the use, protection, and management of coral reef ecosystems, and they are not \nproperly coordinated. Institutional weaknesses and lack of political will have failed to sufficiently \ninstitutionalize the spatial planning concept in managing marine and terrestrial resources, as \nembodied in the Spatial Planning Act 24/1992. Nongovernment organizations (NGOs) are also \nplaying  an  increasingly  significant  role  in  promoting  and  facilitating  the  establishment  of \nconservation and sustainable development programs.  \n \n10.  Planning  Framework.  In  the  past,  national  development  policy  formulation  was \nundertaken in the context of macroeconomic development that was, in turn, translated into a \nregional economic approach. This led to a planning system that often overlooked resource \nsustainability.  However,  over  the  past  decade,  there  has  been  a  shift  in  emphasis,  with \nmeasures introduced for resource values to be taken into account in preparing development \nplans. Projects have been implemented to enhance the capabilities of government agencies for \ndata acquisition and exchange, and resource assessment.4 An important contribution of these \nprograms and projects is the heightened awareness created among government planners of the \nneed for sustainable use of resources, including coral reefs. However, most projects affect only \na small part of Indonesia\u2019s land and marine areas, and a considerable program of sustained \neffort will be required to make a significant difference to the ways in which the country\u2019s natural \nresources, including coral reefs, are managed.  \n \n11.  Sector planning at the national level is the responsibility of individual ministries but, as a \nresult of Law 22, national sector plans, strategies, policies and guidelines developed at the \ncentral level are now implemented by provincial and district agencies. Provincial and district \nplanning  is  the  responsibility  of  the  respective  BAPPEDA  (regional  development  planning \nagency). Provincial and district BAPPEDAs are responsible to the governor or bupati for overall \nplanning within the jurisdiction and for coordinating sector plans prepared by regional services \nof sector agencies. While ADB- and other externally assisted projects in natural resources \nevaluation  and  planning  have  assisted  many  regional  BAPPEDAs  in  developing  human \nresources and strengthening capacities for effective planning, further capacity building efforts \nare  required  to  prepare  BAPPEDAs  for  significantly  greater  planning  functions  and \nresponsibilities devolved to them under Law 22.  \n                                                 \n4   These include the (i) ADB-assisted Land Resource Evaluation and Planning Project (LREP) (Loan 730-INO), \n(ii) Second Land Resources Evaluation Project (LREP II) (Loan 1099-INO), (iii) Marine Resources Evaluation and \nPlanning Project (MREP) (Loan 1203-INO), (iv) Coastal Community Development and Fisheries Resources \nManagement Project (Loans 1570/1571[SF]-INO), (v) Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Project \u2013 \nPhase I, (vi) Marine and Coastal Resources Management Project (MCRMP) (Loan 1770 [SF]-INO), and (vii) the \nUSAID-assisted Natural Resources Management Project.

Background \n1.  The Project will adopt a dual approach to the management and conservation of local \ncoral  reefs,  by  working  both  (i) extensively  across  priority  districts  and  (ii) intensively  via \ncommunity-based management (CBM) initiatives at core sites within the districts. By using this \nstrategy, the Project will be providing support to the management and conservation of 98% of \nthe total coral reef area of the three provinces of Riau, North Sumatra, and West Sumatra. The \nidentification of provinces, districts, areas of interest and CBM core sites was based on a \nreconnaissance  mapping  of  reefs  and  other  coastal  habitats  using  Landsat  TM-7  and  the \nanalysis of socioeconomic data, for 2000, contained in the national PODES database of the \nCentral Bureau of Statistics (CBS). This comprehensive database has enabled geographic \ninformation system analysis and mapping down to the village level. \n \nB.  Selection of Provinces \n2.  Riau and North Sumatra and West Sumatra provinces were selected based on previous \nfeasibility studies under Phase I and were reconfirmed during the project preparatory technical \nassistance  (PPTA)  for  Phase  II.  The  selection  of  these  provinces  was  based  on  (i) their \nimportance for reef protection and management and (ii) the economic significance of these reefs \nto the fishing communities in a total of 26 maritime districts. The three provinces have a total of \napproximately  320,000  hectares  (ha)  of  inshore  coral  reefs:  (i) 217,000  ha  (68%)  in  Riau, \n(ii) 36,000 ha (11%) in West Sumatra, and (iii) 65,000 ha (20%) in North Sumatra. \n \nC.  Selection of Districts \n3.  The priority districts were selected on the basis of the potential ecological and economic \nsignificance  of  coral  reefs  within  the  district\u2019s  coastal  waters.  The  selection  process  was \ndesigned to determine, by remote sensing methods, the districts that have extensive coral reefs \ncombined with high numbers of villages dependent on marine fish resources for livelihood, \nemployment, and income. This resulted in the selection of six priority districts, namely: (i) Kota \nBatam,  Kepulauan  Riau,  and  Natuna  in  Riau,  where  35\u201364%  of  the  coastal  villagers  are \ndependent on fisheries; (ii) Nias and Tapanuli Tengah in North Sumatra, where around 98% of \nall coral reefs in the province are located and where about 31\u201336% of the villagers depend on \nfisheries for their livelihood; and (iii) Mentawai in West Sumatra, where around 90% of all reefs \nin the province are found, and where 32% of the villagers are dependent on fishing for a living. \nThe six priority districts have more than 300,000 ha of inshore coral reefs, representing some \n98% of the total reefs in the three provinces. These districts have at least 450 coastal villages, \nof which about 87% have adjacent reefs.  \n \nD.  Selection of Areas of Interest \n4.  The next phase in the selection was the identification of areas of interest based on the \nfollowing criteria: (i) they encompass all major contiguous coral reef areas within the priority \ndistricts; (ii) they consist of at least 500 ha of reefs; and (iii) adjacent coastal villages are reliant \non fishing. The selection resulted in 20 areas in the three provinces, as shown in Table A4.1. \nThe 20 areas encompass about 300,000 ha of inshore reefs or 93% of the total available reefs \nin the six priority districts, and include about 159 (over 40%) of the coastal villages with fishing \nas the primary occupation. \n ", "  Appendix 4  31 \nTable A4.1: Areas of Interest and Priority Districts \n \nProvince  Provisional Priority Districts  Areas of Interest \nRiau  1.

Financial  and  economic  analysis  was  undertaken  to  determine  the  viability  of  the \nindicative  income-generating  microenterprises  to  be  promoted  by  the  Project.  Economic \nanalysis was carried out for the Project as a whole, covering noncost recovery components as \nwell  as  microenterprise  investment  and  operation.  As  the  benefit  impacts  of  different \ncomponents of the Project are interdependent, project economic analysis was not conducted for \nindividual components. Economic costs and benefits are expressed in terms of the domestic \nprice numeraire. Detailed tables are presented in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nB.  Financial and Economic Analysis of Indicative Microenterprises \n2.  Four indicative enterprise models were identified as possible income-generating projects \nfor  the  target  10,000  households  in  the  project  areas,  namely  (i) mud  crab  fattening, \n(ii) estuarine  grouper  cage  culture,  (iii) seaweed  culture,  and  (iv) fish  cracker  making.  The \nresults of the financial and economic analysis indicate that each representative microenterprise \nis financially sustainable and economically viable, with the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \nand economic internal rate of return (EIRR) above the weighted financial cost and social cost of \ncapital  estimated  at  about  16%  and  12%,  respectively  (Supplementary  Appendix  F).  The \nrelatively high FIRR and EIRR values may be attributed to relatively attractive domestic prices \nfor these commodities and the local abundance and low prices of primary production inputs. \nAside from being economically viable, the representative livelihood projects are appropriate to \nthe project areas as they utilize locally available resources. About 10,000 households are \nassumed to benefit from the microenterprises to be promoted by the Project through the inputs \nassistance program, delivery of extension services, and marketing assistance.  \n \nC.  Major Economic Benefits \n3.  Benefits not Quantified. The Project is expected to produce benefits difficult to quantify \ngiven the nature of, and the limited time and resources arising from, its two major components: \n(i) institutional  strengthening  and  project  management;  and  (ii) community-based  resource \nmanagement and development. The preliminary results from Phase I show success of initial \nimplementation  and  development  of  these  two  components.  The  policy  and  strategy \ndevelopment work to be carried out under the Project will ensure appropriate controls and \nguidance for local development activities, thereby reducing adverse environmental impacts on \ncoral  reef  ecosystems  originating  from  various  sources  including  unsustainable  fisheries \npractices,  mining,  tourism,  marine  transport,  land  reclamation,  and  urban  and  industrial \ndevelopment. The implementation of an institutional development component will build national \nand local capacity in, and empower coastal communities for, community-based management \n(CBM) and project implementation. It will also enhance interagency linkages and public-private \nsector partnerships in income generation and resource management. Information, education, \nand communication programs as well as extension programs will result in behavioral changes in \ncoastal inhabitants and bring about improvements in reef health. The delineation of marine \nmanagement areas and implementation of CBM initiatives will lessen the destruction of coral \nreefs and improve rehabilitation efforts in the project area and, by transferring lessons learned \nat these sites to other coral reef systems, improve the general coastal and marine biodiversity in \nIndonesia. \n   ", "  Appendix 11  41 \n4.  The enhanced recreational and tourism benefits arising from the improved biodiversity \nand aesthetic appeal of the generated coral reefs and fish population were excluded from the \ncalculation of benefits. This is due to the difficulty in estimating consumer surplus for domestic \ntourists and economic profits from foreign tourists, due mainly to lack of reliable data. Health \nbenefits were also excluded from the analysis as these are not linked to improvements in coral \nreef quality and are associated entirely with the Project\u2019s social sector interventions. There are \nalso methodological difficulties and lack of reliable data for analysis. \n  \n5.  Quantifiable Benefits. The major quantifiable economic benefits of the Project are \nenvisaged  to  arise  from  (i) rehabilitation  of  coral  reefs  in  previously  degraded  areas  and \nsubsequent restoration of abundance of commercially important reef resources1 through the \nestablishment of erosion control structures, artificial reefs and marine protected areas, fish \nrestocking, coral transplantation, and mangrove reforestation; (ii) reduction in destructive fishing \nand overfishing through effective information, education, and communication activities, and \nmonitoring, control, and surveillance activities; (iii) establishment of basic social services and \ninfrastructure development to promote the socioeconomic well-being of coastal communities \nand  complement  the  conservation  efforts  of  the  Project;  and  (iv) establishment  of \nmicroenterprises to improve the income-earning capacity of fisherfolk, thereby contributing to \npoverty reduction in communities relying on reef resources for food and income. \n \nD.  Economic Valuation \n6.  For  this  Project,  all  benefits  were  estimated  through  the  specification  of  a  single \n\u201cincremental scenario\u201d that is relative to some presumed reference case.2 The reference case \nrefers to the estimate of benefits elsewhere, but adopted to a current study with appropriate \nadjustments to capture, as much as possible, the unique characteristics of the areas under \nstudy. This approach, referred to as the benefit transfer method, was adopted because (i) it \npermits a standardized methodology across multiple districts where information quality and \navailability vary widely; (ii) it provides a relatively simple methodology that is adequate for \ndemonstrating the potential level of benefits associated with the Project;3 (iii) it permits linking of \nsome of the project performance criteria in the project framework analysis (e.g., coral reef \nquality,  incomes  to  target  communities)  to  the  dose-response  assumptions  in  the  benefit \ncalculation; and (iv) it can be easily replicated at other Phase II sites that may be supported by \nother financing in other parts of Indonesia where similar data constraints may be expected. The \nstudies or reference cases4 adopted to approximately capture the economic benefits likely to be \ngenerated by this Project are presented in Supplementary Appendix F. To make the resource \nvalues site specific, the reference values were adjusted for the target six districts of the Project \nusing available economic, biophysical, and demographic information.  \n \n7.  Economic Benefits. Global biodiversity values are typically quite high but are difficult, if \nnot impossible, for countries to capture. The adjusted incremental benefit values for global \nbiodiversity attributable to intact mangroves and coral reefs are $43/ha/yr and $2,808/ha/yr, \n                                                 \n1  Such as reef fish, turtles, b\u00eaches-de-mer, giant clams, trochus shells, pearls, and other mollusks such as cone \nshells and cowries. \n2  Normally, project benefit-cost analysis (BCA) requires specification of differential benefits between a \u201cwith project\u201d \nand a \u201cwithout project\u201d scenario, and explicit definition of the two scenarios for areas under study. \n3  As these benefits are not direct financial flows related to project sustainability, a higher level of uncertainty in the \nbenefit estimates is acceptable. \n4  An exhaustive literature search was conducted to obtain reference cases that would closely approximate the \nuniqueness and characteristics of Indonesia\u2019s fishery resources. The only relevant and meaningful references to \nthis Project are presented herein.  ", "42  Appendix 11 \nrespectively. Estimates of the global biodiversity incremental benefits are based on the 6,000 ha \nof coral reefs and 1,625 ha of mangroves directly targeted by the Project. These benefits are \nassumed to peak only after the 12th year of project implementation.

Poverty and Social Dimensions in the Project Area1 \n1.  Population in the Project Area. The total population of the coastal and noncoastal \nvillages  in  the  six  project  districts  is  1.8 million  in  360,000  households  with  an  average \nhousehold size of five members. Poverty is widespread in the coastal villages of the project \narea, with the poverty incidence ranging from 83% in Nias to 41% in Kepulauan Riau. Of the \ntotal coastal households, about 53% fall below the poverty threshold, 13% are considered very \npoor,  40%  are  poor,  and  about  16%  are  low  income  earners.  The  remaining  coastal \nhouseholds, accounting for 31% of the total, are made up of moderate (11%) and high (20%) \nincome earners, with earnings greater than Rp4.86 million (or $486) per year. Those that fall \nbelow the poverty threshold are composed mostly of small fishers, fish processors, and workers \nin the fishing industry and allied fields, while the high income earners are businesspeople, \nlandowners, big boat and plant owners, and successful entrepreneurs.  \n \n2.  Most of the villagers in the project area are highly dependent on fishing for livelihood, \nwith  many  claiming  that  their  income  from  fishing  is  insufficient  to  meet  even  their  basic \nsubsistence  needs.  They  have  limited  capacity  to  explore  new  fishing  grounds  or  other \nopportunities  for  increasing  fish  catch  and  income,  have  limited  facilities  to  store  fishery \nproducts,  lack  marketing  channels,  and  have  limited  transportation  services.  Human \ndevelopment is weak; coastal residents have limited education and limited access to health and \nother basic social services such as potable water supply, sewerage and sanitation, electricity, \nand transportation. In most proposed project sites, the absence of clear legal \u201cownership\u201d rights \nto resource use has created conflicts in utilizing coastal and marine resources. Conflict is due \nmainly to outside fishers who usually own fishing vessels and use specific fishing techniques \nthat enable them to catch more fish in less time than those using the more traditional methods \nof the local fishers.  \n \n3.  Gender Issues. A clear division of labor exists in many villages in the project districts, \nwith  women  and  men  undertaking  their  traditional  reproductive  and  productive  roles, \nrespectively. Women\u2019s tasks mainly revolve around household-related activities while men have \nprimary responsibility for making a living, mostly in fishing. The educational level of males and \nfemales is generally unequal, with men having a somewhat higher educational attainment than \nwomen. Credit is also generally given to men, especially by the formal financial institutions, \nsince they are considered the breadwinners. Women not only have limited access to economic \nservices  but  also  have  limited  roles  in  the  family  decision-making  process,  particularly  for \nimportant decisions.  \n \n4.  Institutional Support Systems. In most project sites, there are either formal or informal \ninstitutions  that  have  experience  in  implementing  community-based  management  (CBM) \nprogram activities. Women\u2019s groups and fishers\u2019 organizations can be used as a base for \ncommunity mobilization. Similarly, the relatively new democratic bodies, such as the village \nrepresentative forum and the village development management board, can be strengthened and \nempowered to assist the community to actively participate and be directly involved in local \nresource management.  \n \n5.  Indigenous Peoples. The Suku Mentawai people make up 80% of the total population \nof  Mentawai,  which  currently  number  about  60,987.  Immigrant  populations  make  up  the \n                                                 \n1  Additional details are presented in Supplementary Appendixes G\u2013I. ", "  Appendix 12  45 \nremaining 20%, which include the ethnic groups of Minang, Batak, Nias, and Ambon. Although \nsome Suku Mentawai people are located also in the coastal areas, they reside primarily in the \ninland areas of Siberut. Suku Mentawai people are migratory, moving within the island of \nSiberut, with livelihood activities centered upon hunting, raising wild pigs, and growing tubers \nand cloves. The native language of Suku Mentawai is Bahasa Mentawai, an oral language \nheritage. Approximately 40% of the total Suku Mentawai people have received primary school \neducation.  Religious/spiritual  laws,  called  the  punen,  govern  relationships  between  people \nregarding agreements made, but none delineates resource use. Although the use of health \ncenters is increasing, a large number of Suku Mentawai women still rely on the sikere, or the \nvillage spiritual healer, to assist them in childbirth. They have high representation in local \ngovernments, and an increasing number now hold formal employment.  \n \nB.  The Project\u2019s Poverty and Social Strategy \n6.  Targeted Interventions. As its primary beneficiaries, the Project will target households \nin the coastal communities with annual incomes up to Rp6.48 million ($648), consisting mainly \nof small fishers, fish farmers, fish processors, and workers in the fishing industry and allied \nfields. Those households with annual income over Rp6.48 million will not be included among the \nProject\u2019s target beneficiaries although their cooperation in project activities will be advantageous \nto the Project. Some project activities will benefit all persons or households in the community, \nwhile others will have a more specific impact on specific groups. The target communities will be \nprovided with income-generating and employment opportunities and better access to basic \namenities. They will be trained in better resource management to improve their productive \ncapacity and transform the fishers among them into responsible resource users and managers.  \n \n7.  Conflict Management. Resource management decisions taken by the local community \nwill be legitimized through the establishment of new measures or the formalization of existing \nones. For instance, if there is a community consensus in managing a marine resource or area \nby prohibiting trawl operations within 12 miles of an island, this could be legalized to ensure that \nothers  recognize  this  decision.  The  people  will  be  involved  not  only  in  choosing  the  reef \nmanagement area but also in the preparation and implementation of local rules over use and \nprotection. In the absence of resource management plans, the Project will assist in drafting \nregulations as required. Planning for coral reef management, village plan development, and the \nformulation of income-generating activities will be conducted in a participatory manner and will \nbe inclusive of the needs of indigenous coastal communities, where they exist at project sites. \n  \n8.  Poverty  Mitigation  and  Social  Development.  The  Project  will  address  poverty \nconcerns  through  its  core  development  activities  of  (i) community  empowerment  and \ninstitutional  development  and  (ii) sustainable  livelihood  and  income  generation  to  enhance \nwelfare, thereby reducing pressure on coral reefs. Communities will be empowered and trained \nto manage, control, and utilize reef resources in a sustainable manner, and will be provided with \n(i) basic  services;  (ii) basic  infrastructure;  and  (iii) community  environmental  protection, \nrehabilitation,  and  enhancement  projects.  However,  the  Project  will  only  enter  those \ncommunities  into  which  it  is  expressly  invited,  and  will  not  impose  any  specific  income-\ngenerating activities. Individuals will be given training and help in obtaining funding but will not \nbe  given  outright  grants.  Prior  to  the  implementation  of  activities  at  project  sites,  the \ncommunities will engage in a comprehensive planning process that identifies constraints, risks, \nand opportunities. A gender action plan will delineate how the Project will encourage women\u2019s \nparticipation and provide opportunities for them to play active roles in setting up, operating, and \nmanaging small-scale income-generating projects (Supplementary Appendix I).  ", "46  Appendix 13 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  An initial environmental examination of the proposed Project was carried out to ascertain \nits impacts on the environment and to identify and recommend measures to prevent or mitigate \nany adverse environmental impacts which could arise from project implementation.  \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n2.  The proposed Project is the acceleration phase of a national coral reef rehabilitation and \nmanagement program whose overall goals are healthy coral reef ecosystems and prosperous \ncoastal communities. The Project will contribute to this overall program goal by (i) enhancing the \nnational and local capacity to manage the country\u2019s coral reef resources and (ii) rehabilitating \nand effectively managing priority coral reef ecosystems, thereby helping raise income levels and \nimproving living standards among poor coastal communities. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) will finance project activities in six districts in the three provinces of (i) Riau, (ii) North \nSumatra, and (iii) West Sumatra.1 These districts are: (i) Kota Batam, Kepulauan Riau, and \nNatuna in Riau; (ii) Nias and Tapanuli Tengah in North Sumatra; and (iii) Mentawai in West \nSumatra.2 These priority districts contain more than 300,000 hectares (ha) of inshore coral \nreefs, representing some 98% of the total reefs in the three provinces. They also have at least \n450 coastal villages, of which about 87% have adjacent reefs. In these districts, some 20 core \nsites have been provisionally selected during project preparation, but will be confirmed during \nthe implementation, subject to the Project being invited in by the local communities. Where the \ncommunities  do  not  fully  support  the  community-based  management  (CBM)  program, \nalternative core sites will be selected. \n \n3.  The Project will have two major components: (i) institutional strengthening and project \nmanagement,  which  will  comprise  (a)  strengthening  of  national  and  regional  institutions  in \npolicy,  strategy,  and  guideline  formulation  and  resource  planning  and  management; \n(b) establishment and strengthening of a network of coral reef information and training centers \n(CRITCs);  (c)  human  resources  development  (HRD)  and  extension;  and  (d)  project \nmanagement; and (ii) community-based resource management and development, which will \ninvolve (a) community empowerment, (b) community resource management, (c) community \nsocial  services  and  infrastructure  development,  and  (d)  community  livelihood  and  income \ngeneration. The detailed description of the activities to be carried out under each of these \ncomponents and subcomponents is given in paras. 15\u201331 of the main report. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n4.  Mapping of the target districts by Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite imagery showed that the \nthree districts in Riau (namely, Batam, Kepulauan Riau, and Natuna) have the most extensive \npooled coral reef cover of about 260,000 ha. This area represents over 67% of the 380,000 ha \nof coral reefs in the three provinces (Riau, North Sumatra, and West Sumatra) combined. \nNatuna has the most extensive coral reefs, with about 125,000 ha, equivalent to about 33% of \nthe pooled coral reef areas for the selected districts in the three provinces. Mangroves, which \n                                                 \n1  The World Bank is expected to fund project activities in five other provinces. These have only been provisionally \nidentified and include Southeast Sulawesi, South Sulawesi, North Sulawesi, Maluku, and Irian Jaya. \n2  Information on the proposed project districts, as well as selection criteria used for identifying them, are given in \nAppendix 4 and Supplementary Appendix A. ", "  Appendix 13  47 \nact as biological filters and buffers against coastal erosion, as repositories of high biodiversity \nand critical areas, and as nurseries for commercially important fish species, are common in the \nselected districts in all three provinces. However, the vast majority of mangroves are located in \nRiau, with some 43,000 ha (68%) mapped there out of a total 63,500 ha in the three provinces. \n \n5.  Various  socioeconomic  variables  were  collected  as  part  of  the  social  assessment \nconducted during project preparation. As these are described in Appendix 12, they will not be \nrepeated here. However, in view of the causal linkages between environmental degradation and \nthe principal occupation of the coastal communities, it is worth mentioning that fishing is the \nprimary occupation recorded in over half (58%) of the 67 villages proposed for Phase II, and \nmost of them (25 out of 39) are located in Riau. The estimated population of the proposed \nPhase II districts is about 103,360 individuals living in 22,251 households, equivalent to 4.6 \nmembers per household, higher than the national average household size of 4.3 members.  \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n6.  The  project  activities  were  screened  and  the  results  tabulated  according  to  the \noperational  stages  of  the  Project:  (i) environmental  problems  due  to  project  location; \n(ii) environmental  problems  related  to  design;  (iii) environmental  problems  associated  with \nconstruction; and (iv) environmental problems resulting from project operations. Based on the \nenvironmental screening of Project components and interventions using ADB\u2019s Environmental \nAssessment Requirements (1998), the project components were classified, as shown in Table \nA13.1.  \n \nTable A13.1: Screening of Project Activities \n \nActivity  1  2  3  4 \nComponent I: Institutional Strengthening and Project Management \nStrengthening of National and Regional Institutions  No  No  No  No \nStrengthening the Coral Reef Information and Training Centers  No  No  No  No \nHuman Resources Development and Extension  No  No  No  No \nProject Management  No  No  No  No \nComponent II: Community-Based Resource Management and Development \nCommunity Empowerment  No  No  No  No \nCommunity Resource Management  No  No  No  No \nCommunity Social Services and Infrastructure Development  No  No  Yes  No \nCommunity Livelihood and Income Generation  No  No  No  Yes \n1 = Environmental problems due to project location; 2 = Environmental problems related to design; 3 = Environmental \nproblems associated with construction; 4 = Environmental problems resulting from project operations; No = no \nadverse environmental impacts; Yes = with potential adverse environmental impacts. \n \n7.  For the subcomponents classified as Category B, some prototype interventions were \ntested for their potential adverse impacts vis-\u00e0-vis the actions affecting environmental resources \nand  values  as  listed  in  ADB\u2019s  checklist  of  environmental  parameters  for  fisheries  and \naquaculture projects to segregate those parameters with \u201cno significant impacts\u201d from those \n\u201cwith significant adverse impacts\u201d (small, moderate, or major). Small-scale village development \nactivities mainly involving the provision of basic social infrastructure facilities such as those for \npotable water supply, sanitation, public health, and physical access (e.g., small jetties for boats \nand  access  roads  leading  to  the  communities)  may  produce  minor  impacts  during  the \nconstruction stage. However, given that the development is of a small scale, the magnitude of \nthe impacts (e.g., dust and noise, road traffic) is also expected to be small and of a temporary \nnature. For example, the dust and noise produced by the construction of the facilities are not ", "48  Appendix 13 \nexpected to cause a major disturbance to the population living to the sites of these facilities. \nBesides, these effects can be mitigated through proper site selection and construction planning. \n \n8.  Among 35 possible microenterprises tested for their environmental impacts, mariculture \nand land-based aquaculture activities were identified as having potential adverse impacts on the \nenvironment (Supplementary Appendix C). Small impacts could arise from: (i) site selection, \nparticularly  as  a  result  of  conflicts  with  other  site  uses  (waterways);  (ii) construction;  and \n(ii) operation, specifically water pollution hazards. The selection of sites for establishment of \nmariculture enterprises should therefore be made carefully and with full consideration of other \nuses of the sites to prevent conflicts, such as with the use of the waterway for navigation. \nPrivate contractors engaged by the project implementation units (PIUs) for the construction of \nsocial infrastructure facilities will be properly oriented on the need for environmental safeguards. \nThe culture method to be used should be extensive or semi-intensive, at the most, to prevent \nwater pollution caused by excess fish feeds and fish wastes. Monitoring of water quality at the \nculture  sites  and  downstream  will  help  in  the  early  detection  of  water  pollution  and  the \nimplementation  of  mitigation  or  corrective  measures  to  prevent  further  damage  to  the \nenvironment.  \n \nE.  Environmental Impact Monitoring \n9.  In general, environmental impact monitoring involves the measurement of indicators \nbefore,  during,  and  after  the  establishment  of  project  interventions  to  determine  the \neffectiveness  of  management  measures  adopted,  assess  the  Project\u2019s  benefits  on  the \nenvironment, allow early detection of environmental damage, and ensure that environmental \nsafety criteria are complied with. For this Project, the interventions listed as having potential \nnegative  environmental  impacts  should  be  monitored,  particularly  those  whose  effects  are \npredicted due to site selection. Those impacts that are temporary and that are likely to result \nfrom construction or renovation of physical facilities obviously need not be monitored after \ncompletion. A detailed environmental management and monitoring plan will be prepared, with \nthe  assistance  of  an  environment  specialist,  in  the  first  year  of  project  implementation. \nEnvironmental monitoring will be the responsibility of the regional CRITCs, specifically their \ntechnical staff, but will be supported by the national CRITC and by the project management \noffice (PMO) and the PIUs, as necessary. The results of environmental monitoring carried out at \nthe field level will be compiled at the PIUs and transmitted to the CRITCs for storage and easy \nretrieval. \n \nF.  Conclusions and Recommendations \n10.  Using the ADB checklist of environmental parameters for fisheries and aquaculture \nprojects, the potential environmental impacts of the interventions classified under Category B \nwere identified. Examination of these interventions showed that none of them would need an \nenvironmental impact assessment, i.e., not one of the interventions is environmentally critical or \nprojected to create significant adverse or negative impacts on the environment. Only a few \nminor environmental impacts are likely as a result of factors related to site selection and \nconstruction, but these are small and avoidable/mitigatable and, in the case of construction-\nrelated impacts, localized and temporary in nature and could be minimized through careful \nplanning and the adoption of proper construction practices.
