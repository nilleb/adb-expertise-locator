The summary is a core appendix. \n \nThe  Project  is  the  second  of  a  three-phase  comprehensive,  15-\nyear  program  funded  by  several  financing  institutions  for  the \nrehabilitation  and  management  of  coral  reefs  in  Indonesia. \nIncorporating  lessons  learned  from  Phase  I,  Loan  1613-INO: \nCoral  Reef  Rehabilitation  and  Management  Project,  the  Project \nwill  adopt  a  holistic  approach  to  the  management  of  coastal \nresources,  particularly  coral  reefs  and  associated  ecosystems. \nThe Project will focus on a few key provinces where the costs of \ndelaying,  and  the  benefits  from  expediting,  such  a  project  are \ngreatest.  The  Project  will  follow  a  participatory  process  by  which \ncoastal communities will organize themselves, with the assistance \nof local governments and project facilitators; identify their specific \nneeds; and plan and implement their community-specific resource \nmanagement  and  livelihood  programs  based  on  their  perceived \nneeds.  \n \nIndonesia\u2019s  coral  reefs  form  the  key  ecosystem  on  which  the \nmajority  of \nincome \ngeneration,  construction  materials,  and  coastal  protection.  The \nIndonesian  coastal  and  marine  sector  is  beset  with  a  number  of \nproblems.  Foremost  among  these  are  the  two  critical  and \ninterrelated  issues  of  resource  degradation  and  the  pervasive \npoverty among coastal communities. A rapid social assessment of \ncoastal villages in the targeted project districts found that 65\u201383% \nof  the  population  in  the  proposed  project  sites  live  below  the \nnational  poverty  line  and  are  deprived  of  basic  social  amenities \nand  services  like  potable  water  supply,  sewerage  and  sanitation, \nand  health  and  education.  In  these  areas,  the  extensive  coral \nreefs and associated ecosystems are subject to continuing threats \nfrom  natural  processes  and  from  human  activities,  including \ndestructive  and  illegal  fishing,  sand  mining,  and  coral  mining.  In \naddition,  the  coastal  and  marine  sector  continues  to  suffer  from \npolicy, legal, and institutional constraints. Phase I has successfully \ndeveloped  and  established  a  comprehensive  framework  and \nprogram  of  national  policy,  monitoring,  control  and  surveillance, \npublic  awareness,  information  and  monitoring,  and  research  in \nsupport of coral reef management and monitoring. The proposed \nProject will build on these and promote sustainable management \nof coral reef resources, and thereby reduce poverty. \n \n \n\ninhabitants  rely \n\nthe  coastal \n\nfood, \n\nfor \n\n\fii \n\n \nObjectives \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n(ii) \n\ncommunity \n\nempowerment, \n\n \nThe  Project  will  (i) enhance  the  national  and  local  capacity  to \nmanage the country\u2019s coral reef resources and (ii) rehabilitate and \neffectively manage priority coral reef ecosystems, thereby helping \nraise  income  levels  and  improving  living  standards  among  poor \ncoastal  communities.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  in  six \ndistricts  in  three  provinces,  namely  (i) Kota  Batam,  Kepulauan \nRiau, and Natuna in Riau Province; (ii) Nias and Tapanuli Tengah \nin  North  Sumatra  Province;  and  (iii) Mentawai  in  West  Sumatra \nProvince.  It  will  comprise  two  major  components:  (i) institutional \nstrengthening and project management and (ii) community-based \nresource management and development. The first component will \ncomprise  (i)  strengthening  of  national  and  regional  institutions  in \npolicy,  strategy,  and  guideline  formulation  and  resource  planning \nand  management;  (ii)  establishment  and  strengthening  of  a \nnetwork  of  coral  reef  information  and  training  centers  (CRITCs); \n(iii)  human  resources  development  (HRD)  and  extension;  and \n(iv) project  management.  The  second  component  will  involve \n(i) community \nresource \nmanagement,  (iii)  community  social  services  and  infrastructure \nincome \ndevelopment,  and \ngeneration. \n \nThe total project cost, including service charge and contingencies, \nis  estimated  at  $41.25 million  equivalent,  comprising  a  foreign \nexchange  component  of  $8.27 million  (20%  of  total  cost)  and  a \nlocal currency cost of $32.98 million equivalent (80% of total cost). \nThe  estimates  include  a  provision  for  $0.92 million  equivalent  in \ntaxes and duties. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank \nloan  of  $33 million \nequivalent  (80%  of  the  total  project  cost)  will  finance  the  entire \nforeign  exchange  cost  of  $8.27 million  and  a  portion  of  the  local \ncurrency  cost  amounting  to  $24.73 million  (75%  of  total  local \ncosts).  The  remaining  local  currency  cost  of  $8.75 million  will  be \nfinanced  by  the  Government  and  project  beneficiaries.  The \ngovernment  contribution  will  come  from  the  central  Government \nand  the  governments  of  the  three  provinces  and  six  districts. \nBeneficiaries\u2019  contribution  will  be  in  the  form  of  labor  for \ncommunity-based \nand \nimprovement  of  various  small-scale  infrastructure  facilities  and \naccess roads, and livelihood development activities. \n \n\n(iv)  community \n\nlivelihood  and \n\nenforcement, \n\nconstruction \n\n(ADB) \n\nlaw \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  $33 million  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources  (SDR  25,004,000).  The  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, an interest charge of 1% per \nannum on principal amount disbursed during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft Loan Agreement. \n \n \n\n \n \n\n\f30 June 2009 \n\nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\niii \n\n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  by  four  directorates  general \nunder  the  Ministry  of  Marine  Affairs  and  Fisheries  (MMAF): \n(i) Coasts  and  Small  Islands  (DGCSI),  (ii) Capture  Fisheries, \n(iii) Aquaculture,  and \n(iv) Marine  Resource  and  Fisheries \nControlling.  A  project  management  office  (PMO)  will  be  set  up \nwithin DGCSI, with a qualified full-time project director, to oversee \nthe  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  Project.  The  Indonesian \nInstitute  of  Sciences  (LIPI) will  be  the  national  implementing \nagency for research, information, monitoring, and training on coral \nreef  management.  The  PMO  established  in  LIPI  during  Phase  I \nProject  will  be  converted  into  a  national  project  implementation \nunit. Six regional project implementation units will be set up, one \nin  each  project  district,  to  oversee  and  coordinate  field-level \ninteragency  national  steering  committee \nimplementation.  An \n(NSC)  will  be  established  to  guide  the  overall  direction  of  the \nProject  and  ensure  overall  coordination  of  activities  between  the \nProject  and  other  government  programs  and  projects.  The  NSC \nwill  be  supported  by  a  national  technical  committee,  whose \nchairperson  will  serve  as  NSC  secretary.  A  regional  advisory \ncommittee  (RAC)  will  be  established  in  each  project  province  to \noversee  project  coordination  between  various \nimplementing \nagencies  (IAs)  at  the  local  level  and  liaise  with  the  NSC  as \nrequired. \n \nMinistry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) \n \nAll  services,  supplies,  and  equipment  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will \nbe  procured \nfor \nProcurement. All goods to be purchased through local competitive \nin  accordance  with  Government \nbidding  will  be  procured \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Equipment  and  materials  for \npackages  valued  at  $500,000  or  more  will  be  procured  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Some  supply \ncontracts  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $500,000  and  certain \nspecialized  items  will  be  procured  using  international  shopping \nprocedures.  Minor  items  of  equipment  and  materials  costing  less \nthan $100,000 will be procured through direct purchase. The civil \nworks  packages  are  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $1 million  each \nand  will  therefore  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive \nbidding procedures among prequalified contractors, in accordance \nwith \nthe  Government\u2019s  standard  procurement  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. \n \n\nthe  ADB  Guidelines \n\nin  accordance  with \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\nand \n\ntarget,  as \n\ndatabase  management, \n\nits  primary  beneficiaries, \n\nInternational and domestic consultants will be engaged through an \ninternational consulting firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to \nADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  A  total  of  534 \nperson-months  of  consulting  services,  consisting  of  54 \ninternational and 480 domestic person-months, will be required for \neffective  project  implementation.  The  consultants  will  support  the \nPMO  and  the  project  implementation  units  in  two  broad  areas: \n(i) project  management  and  (ii) technical  advice  in  specific  areas \nlike  coral  reef  management,  community  monitoring,  control  and \nsurveillance,  community  development,  policy  planning,  training \nand \npublic \nextension, \ncommunications. \n \nThe Project will benefit coastal communities in six districts through \nincreased  employment  at  the  community  and  district  levels  and \nimproved  living  conditions  and  standards  of  coastal  residents.  It \nwill \nthose  households \ncomposed  mainly  of  small  fishers,  fish  farmers,  fish  processors, \nand  workers  in  the  fishing  industry  and  allied  fields.  Training  of \ncommunity-based  organizations  in  better  resource  management \nwill  improve  the  productive  capacity  of  the  coastal  communities, \nand  transform  the  fishers  among  them  into  responsible  resource \nusers  and  managers.  Local \nfishers  will  be  provided  with \nalternative  income  through  specific  fishery-related  skills  training, \nwhich  will  help  prevent  them  from  using  destructive  and  illegal \nmeans  of  fishing.  Increased  income  and  greater  access  to  basic \nsocial infrastructure facilities and services will improve health and \nnutrition  and  raise  the  living  standards  of  the  communities.  As \nthe \nwomen  will  be \nimprovements  will  have  a  direct \nfamilies\u2019 \nsocioeconomic status, health, and general well-being. The Project \nwill result in substantial environmental benefits in the form of (i) an \nincrease in live coral cover in areas previously bombed or mined \nand  a  resulting  increase  in  the  abundance  of  commercially \nimportant reef resources such as reef fish, turtles, b\u00eaches-de-mer, \ngiant  clams,  trochus  shells,  pearls,  and  other  mollusks  such  as \ncone shells and cowries; and (ii) a reduction in the extent of coral \nreef  degradation.  In  addition,  the  Project  is  expected  to  produce \nnonquantifiable  benefits  arising \nfrom  planning  and  policy \ndevelopment, institutional strengthening, and community resource \nmanagement and development. \n \n\nthese  various  activities, \n\nimpact  on \n\ninvolved \n\ntheir \n\nin \n\n\fv \n\nrisks \n\nthat  could  adversely  affect  project \nThe  project \nimplementation  and  the  attainment  of  project  objectives  include: \n(i) the  slow  growth  of  corals  that  could  delay  the  realization  of \nproject  targets;  (ii) institutional  inadequacies  in  the  Executing \nAgency  and  IAs,  as  well  as  community-based  organizations  and \nthe  communities  themselves,  for  their  roles  in  coastal  resource \nmanagement;  (iii) uncertainties  emanating \nthe  evolving \ndecentralization  process  and  institutional  arrangements  at  the \nprovincial  and  district  levels;  (iv) persistence  of  nonadaptive, \ncontrol-based  attitudes  on  the  part  of  national  government \nagencies;  and  (v) government  limitations  in  providing  adequate \nfinancial  and  human  resources  for  continued  implementation  of \nproject  activities  and  facilities  beyond  the  term  of  the  Project. \nMitigating  measures  and  specific  assurances  to  address  these \nrisks have been included in the project design. \n\nfrom \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n\fvii \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Project Phase II \n(the Project).1 \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nIndonesia is the world\u2019s largest archipelagic nation, with more than 17,000 islands and \n81,000 kilometers (km) of coastline. Its coastal and marine waters cover an area of 5.8 million \nsquare  kilometers  (km2),  comprising  3.1 million km2  of  territorial  and  archipelagic  seas  and \n2.7 million km2 of exclusive economic zones. The coastal zone is a highly productive ecosystem \nthat  serves  as  an  important  base  for  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth.  Coastal  habitats  play  an \nimportant role in the daily lives of the people in terms of livelihood, economic output, and food \nproduction.  Over  55%  of  the  national  fishery  harvest  comes  from  capture  fisheries  in  coastal \nareas. Some of the richest areas of biodiversity are found in the coastal zone of the country, and \ninclude  coral  reefs,  mangrove  swamps,  seagrass  beds,  lagoons,  and  estuaries.  Indonesia\u2019s \ncoastal zone is home to 2,500 species of mollusks, 2,000 species of crustaceans, six species of \nsea turtles, 30 species of marine mammals, and over 2,000 species of fish. With its 70 genera \nand  450  species  of  corals  covering  42,000 km2  (or  16.5%  of  the  global  area  of  coral  reefs), \nIndonesia is the coral biodiversity center of the world. \n \nIndonesia\u2019s  coral  reefs  form  the  key  ecosystem  on  which  the  majority  of  the  coastal \n3. \ninhabitants of the country rely for food, income generation, construction materials, and coastal \nprotection.  They  are  also  of  critical  significance  for  science,  education,  pharmaceuticals,  and \nglobal conservation and heritage. Healthy reefs can produce marine products worth $15,000 per \nkm2 per year, and are an important source of food and economic opportunities for about 67,500 \ncoastal  villages.  Coastal  and  marine  economic  activities  have  been  estimated  to  account  for \nsome  25\u201330%  of  Indonesia\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  and  provide  employment  to  about \n20 million  people.  The  reefs  also  play  an  important  role  in  marine-based  tourism  and  in \nproviding  white  sand  for  beaches.  The  tourism  value  of  coral  reefs  has  been  estimated  at \n$3,000 per km2  per  year  in  low  potential  areas  to  $500,000  per  km2 per year in high potential \nsites.  Fringing  coral  reefs  also  play  key  roles  in  dissipating  wave  energy,  thereby  protecting \ncoastal  lands  from  storms  and  wave  erosion.  The  net  benefits  of  coastal  protection  are \nestimated at $15,000\u2013120,000 per km2 of reef, depending on the value of the infrastructure. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nThe  Indonesian  coastal  and  marine  resources  sector  suffers  from  policy,  legal,  and \n4. \ninstitutional constraints affecting resource management in the coastal areas. The National Coral \nReef Policy drafted under Phase I Project is yet to be operationalized at the regional level. The \nSpatial  Planning  Act  24/1992,  which  provides  the  framework  and  legal  basis  for  natural \nresources  planning  and  resource  allocation,  needs  to  be  amended  for  consistency  with  the \nprovisions  of  recent  laws  on  decentralization.  Law  22/1999  on  Regional  Governance  and  Law \n25/1999 on Financial Balance between the Central and Regional Governments have added new \n\n                                                 \n1  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  funds  to  the  Coral  Reef  Rehabilitation  and  Management  Project \nPhase I (Loan 1613-INO) as well as an attached technical assistance grant (TA 3001-INO) to design the proposed \ninvestment project. The project framework for the proposed Project is in Appendix 1. \n\n\f2 \n\ndimensions  to  governance  and  natural  resources  planning  and  management.2  The  lack  of \ninstitutional capacity and preparedness of many local governments for the required tasks could \nexacerbate the problems of resource degradation. \n \nThere  is,  thus,  an  urgent  need  to  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of  provincial  and \n5. \ndistrict  governments  in  participatory  resource  planning  and  management  to  enable  them  to \nexercise  their  newly  mandated  authority  and  responsibility  in  resource  management.  The \nBAPPEDAs (regional development planning agencies), at the provincial and district levels, and \nother  provincial  and  district  agencies,  need  strengthening  to  equip  them  for  their  significantly \ngreater  planning  functions  and  role.  It  is  also  necessary  to  continue  support  for  national \ninitiatives in sector planning, information management, networking, and intersector coordination. \nAs  the  jurisdiction  for  marine  waters  beyond  the  12-nautical  mile  boundary  remains  with  the \ncentral  Government,  continuing  technical  and  financial  support  needs  to  be  extended  to \nconcerned sector agencies to enable them to carry out national-level sector planning and policy \nformulation for appropriate resource management. \n \nAs resource degradation is exacerbated by the extreme poverty of artisan (small-scale) \n6. \nfishers,  who  engage  in  fishing  as  a  livelihood  of  last  resort,  it  is  necessary  to  improve  their \nincome-earning  potential  and  retrain  them  to  undertake  alternative  livelihood  activities  so  that \nthey  avoid  destructive  fishing  practice.  Viable  livelihood  activities  in  coastal  areas  and  small \nislands  have  to  be  developed/introduced  specifically  for  small-scale  fishers.  Local  resource \nrights also have to be strengthened to ensure that investment benefits flow to the communities. \n \n7. \nTo address the foregoing identified needs and constraints, the proposed Project will be \nimplemented  in  three  provinces3  where  areas  have  been  identified  as  having  high  poverty \nincidence  and  high-priority  coral  reefs.  The  Project  supports  the  Government\u2019s  priority  on \npoverty  reduction  in  coastal  communities  and  the  shift  in  focus  from  resource  utilization  to \nresource  protection,  conservation,  and  sustainable  management.  Although  the  sector  issues \ntoday are basically the same as they were when Phase I Project was designed, the environment \nfor resource management and project implementation has improved significantly as a result of a \nnumber of recent developments, including (i) enactment of Laws 22 and 25; (ii) formulation of a \nNational Coral Reef Policy and a supporting National Coral Reef Strategy under Phase I of the \nProject; (iii) creation of Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF); (iv) heightened public \nawareness of the importance and benefits of coral reef resource conservation; and (v) stronger \npolitical  will  on  the  part  of  public  officials  to  address  institutional,  regulatory,  and  enforcement \nissues that plagued coral reef management in the past. \n \n8. \nThe Project will be the second of three phases of a multiyear initiative funded by multiple \nagencies4  to  strengthen  the  management  and  conservation  of  Indonesia\u2019s  coral  reefs  and \n\n                                                 \n2  Law  22/1999  on  Regional  Governance  calls  for  the  devolution  of  jurisdiction  over  living  and  nonliving  coastal \nresources  out  to  the  territorial  limits  of  12  nautical  miles  from  the  low  tide  line  to  provincial  and  district \ngovernments. \n\n3  Five  other  provinces  have  been  provisionally  identified  for  possible  funding  under  a  World  Bank/Global \nEnvironment Facility loan, namely, Southeast Sulawesi, South Sulawesi, North Sulawesi, Maluku, and Papua. \n4  Phase I is cofinanced by the World Bank, Global Environment Facility, and ADB. Parallel financing is provided by \nthe Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), which joined the Project after the approval of the \nProject  by  the  World  Bank  and  ADB.  The  combined  investment  of  these  agencies  in  Phase  I  (1998\u20132002)  is \napproximately $23 million; the Government invested about $8 million. Phase I will be completed by October 2003. \n\n\f3 \n\nassociated  ecosystems.5  An  independent  evaluation  of  Phase  I6  showed  that  the  Project  had \nsuccessfully developed and established a comprehensive framework and programs of national \npolicy; monitoring, control, and surveillance; public awareness; information and monitoring; and \nresearch in support of coral reef management. Specifically, the assessment indicated (i) a very \nhigh  level  of  community  involvement  in  coral  reef  resource  management  in  the  project  areas, \nresulting in a significant reduction in illegal and destructive fishing and coral mining in most of \nthe  project  sites  by  more  than  50%  in  some  cases;  (ii) greater  public  awareness  of  the \nimportance  of  coral  reef  resource  management;  and  (iii) stronger  political  will  for  coastal \nresource management and poverty reduction at all levels of government. \n \n9. \nHowever, the limited geographic coverage of Phase I has resulted in limited impacts on \naltering  coral  reef  use  patterns  or  on  improving  institutional  effectiveness  to  coordinate  coral \nreef  management.  This  is  because  of  (i) limited  resources  available  for  community-based \nmanagement  (CBM)  and  alternative  income-generating  activities;  (ii) the  lack  of  a  supportive \nlegal framework and weak enforcement of regulations; (iii) fragmented field implementation due \nto lack of cohesiveness between project components; (iv) the lack of a strategic approach and \ncapacity in local government agencies to meet their enhanced role under the Law 22/1999 for \ncoastal  resource  management;  and  (v) inadequate  provision  of  basic  social  services  and  few \ntangible returns to poor coastal communities. \n \nOther  lessons  from  Phase  I  include  the  following:  (i) coral  reef  protection  cannot  be \n10. \nsuccessful  unless  there  is  a  strong  legal  and  enforcement  regime;  (ii) a  balance  must  be \nachieved  between  activities  aimed  purely  at  reef  conservation  and \ntargeting \nimprovements in the quality of life of the communities; (iii) a broader ecosystem-based approach \nto  address  coral  reef  and  biodiversity  conservation  is  more  effective  than  narrowly  focused \ninterventions;  (iv) community  improvement  should  emphasize  sustainable  socioeconomic \nactivities that promote alternative livelihood, and social infrastructure projects should conserve \nresources, improve public health, or reduce pollution; and (v) considerable flexibility should be \nallowed  in  tailoring  programs  to  the  very  diverse  cultural,  socioeconomic,  and  biophysical \nconditions in different localities in Indonesia. \n \n11. \nIncorporating lessons from Phase I and other similar funding agency-assisted projects in \nthe sector,7 the Project will be cohesive in its design. The Project will adopt a holistic approach \nto  coastal  resource  management  and  provide  poor  coastal  communities  with  basic  social \nservices,  social  infrastructure,  and  income-generating  opportunities  to  balance  environmental \nand  resource  management  with  socioeconomic  development.  It  will  place  heavy  emphasis  on \ninstitutions,  and \nthe  active  participation  of  project  beneficiaries, \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  in  the  planning  and  implementation  of  resource \nmanagement programs.  \n \nThe Project is in line with the Government\u2019s current Medium-term Development Program \n12. \n2001\u20132005  (PROPENAS)  and  the  Guidelines  of  State  Policy  (1999\u20132004).  It  will  assist  the \nGovernment\u2019s  poverty  reduction  thrust,  which  gives  priority  to  developing  income-generating \nactivities in the coastal zone and small islands, particularly for small-scale fishers. The Project \n\nlocal  government \n\nthose \n\n                                                 \n5  The  Project  was  planned  for  implementation  in  three  phases  over  15  years.  Phase  I,  the  Initiation  Phase, \nconsisted of intensive resource rehabilitation and management activities in four pilot sites (Riau, South Sulawesi, \nIrian Jaya, and Nusa Tenggara Timur) as well as national-level activities aimed at establishing a viable policy and \nlegal framework and strategy for coral reef management. Phases II and III, each to be implemented over a 6-year \nperiod, are intended to be the Acceleration Phase and Expansion Phase, respectively.  \n\n6  The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) conducted the evaluation of Phase I in June 2002. \n7  See Appendix 3 for more information on recent external assistance to the sector. \n\n\f4 \n\nlikewise supports the overarching poverty reduction goal of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand its country and sector strategies8 and is complementary to ongoing projects funded by ADB \nand other external agencies aimed at benefiting coral reefs, either at the local or regional level.9 \nIt  is  also  supportive  of  government-funded  poverty  reduction  programs,  including  the  Inpres \nDesa Tertinggal (IDT)10 implemented in a number of coastal villages in the country.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\n13. \nThe  proposed  Project  is  the  second  phase  of  a  national  coral  reef  rehabilitation  and \nmanagement  program  whose  overall  goals  are  healthy  coral  reef  ecosystems  and  prosperous \ncoastal  communities.  The  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  (i) enhance  the  national  and  local \ncapacity  to  manage  the  country\u2019s  coral  reef  resources  and  (ii) rehabilitate  and  effectively \nmanage  priority  coral  reef  ecosystems,  thereby  raising  income  levels  and  improving  living \nstandards among poor coastal communities. The  Project  will  be  implemented  in  six  districts  in \nthree  provinces.  These  districts  are:  (i) Kota  Batam,  Kepulauan  Riau,  and  Natuna  in  Riau; \n(ii) Nias  and  Tapanuli  Tengah  in  North  Sumatra;  and  (iii) Mentawai  in  West  Sumatra.  These \npriority  districts  contain  more  than  300,000  hectares  (ha)  of  inshore  coral  reefs,  representing \nsome 98% of the total reefs in the three provinces. They also have at least 450 coastal villages, \nof  which  about  87%  have  adjacent  reefs  and  depend  predominantly  on  fisheries  for  their \nlivelihood.  In  each  district,  core  sites  for  CBM  will  be  selected,  based  on  agreed  selection \ncriteria (Appendix 4). \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n14. \nThe  Project  will  comprise  two  major  components:  (i) institutional  strengthening  and \nproject  management  and  (ii) community-based  resource  management  and  development.  The \nfirst  component  will  comprise  (i) strengthening  of  national  and  regional  institutions  in  policy, \nstrategy,  and  guideline  formulation  and  resource  planning  and  management;  (ii) establishment \nand  strengthening  of  a  network  of  coral  reef  information  and  training  centers  (CRITCs); \n(iii) human resources development (HRD) and extension; and (iv) project management support. \nThe  second  component  will  include  (i) community  empowerment,  (ii) community  resource \nmanagement, \ninfrastructure  development,  and \n(iv) community livelihood and income generation.  \n \n\n(iii) community  social  services  and \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening and Project Management  \n\n15. \nThe  Project  will  aim  at  (i) strengthening  national  and  regional  public  sector  institutions \nresponsible for coral reef management in the areas of coral reef policy and strategy formulation \nand  planning;  (ii) supporting  the  establishment  of  a  network  of  CRITCs  that  will  enable \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program (2003-2005) for Indonesia includes environmental management and human \nand social development. Within this framework, ADB\u2019s assistance to the marine and coastal sector of Indonesia \nfocuses  on  (i) resource  evaluation,  planning,  and  sustainable  management;  (ii) environmental  protection  and \nsocial development; (iii) human resources development; and (iv) support for decentralized resource management.  \n9  These  include  the  (i) Coastal  Community  Development  and  Fisheries  Resource  Management  Project  (Loans: \n1570/1571 [SF]-INO); (ii) Marine and Coastal Resources Management Project (Loan 1770 [SF]-INO); (iii) USAID-\nfunded Natural Resources Management Project; (iv) Strategy Study for Marine and Coastal Resources Use and \nCoastal  Environmental  Management  funded  by  the  Canadian  International  Development  Agency;  and  (v)  the \nNature Conservancy-supported pilot project at the marine park within the Komodo National Park. \n\n10  The  IDT  program  for  poverty  reduction  covers  around  28,000  IDT  villages  and  has  funds  amounting  to  about \n\nRp520 billion per year. \n\n\f5 \n\nnetworking,  information  sharing/exchange,  and  technical  direction  and  coordination  across \nproject  sites,  between  the  national  center  and  the  regional  centers,  and  between  the  national \ncenter  and  other  government  agencies  implementing  similar  projects;  and  (iii) equipping  the \nproject  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  NGOs,  and  project  beneficiaries  with  the  skills \nrequired for effective project implementation. \n \n\na. \n\nStrengthening of National and Regional Government Institutions \n\nNational, regional, and local government agencies will be assisted in the development of \n16. \npolicies,  strategies,  guidelines,  and  regulations  for  sustainable  coral  reef  utilization  and \nmanagement, particularly in light of the devolution of coastal resource management functions to \nthe  regional  governments.  At  the  national  level,  the  Project  will  strengthen  the  policy-making, \nplanning,  and  regulatory  functions  of  MMAF  and  its  concerned  directorates.  Training  and \ntechnical support will be provided to other concerned ministries, such as Environment, Forestry, \nHome  Affairs,  Tourism  and  Culture,  Education,  and  the  Navy.  It  will  also  support  policy \ndevelopment  work  in  other  sector  agencies,  including  BAPPENAS  (National  Development \nPlanning Agency), which has jurisdiction over marine parks. \n \n17. \nThe Project will support each target province and district government in the review and \ndevelopment  of  an  appropriate  regional  policy  and  legal  framework  for  sustainable  coral  reef \nuse and protection. The regional CRITCs and regional project implementation units (RPIUs), will \nassist regional governments in (i) reviewing existing laws, regulations, and traditional rights and \npractices  on  coral  reef  management,  (ii) determining  the  need  to  amend  existing  laws  or \nrelevant regulations to promote more effective enforcement or to enact new laws consistent with \nnational  guidelines  on  coral  reef  management  and/or  to  recognize  traditional  rights,  and \n(iii) drafting  required  legal  amendments  or  enacting  new  laws  for  sustainable  coral  reef \nmanagement.  To  improve  law  enforcement,  the  Project  will  assist  regional  governments  in \n(i) developing  appropriate  mechanisms \ninteragency  coordination,  (ii) institutionalizing \nprocedures  and  practices  for  transparency  and  participation  in  decision-making  processes  for \nresource  allocation  and  management,  and  (iii) implementing  regulatory  and  other  related \nfunctions that have been devolved to them by virtue of Law 22.  \n \nEach  participating  district  will  formulate  a  marine  action  strategy  and  a  corresponding \n18. \ncoral  reef  management  plan  (CRMP)  that  will  include  a  district  spatial  plan  to  guide  the \nallocation  of  marine  resources.11  The  marine  action  strategy  and  CRMP  will  be  prepared \nthrough a participatory process that will involve the local communities and will be facilitated by \nNGOs,  fishery  extension  workers,  and  other  extension  services.  The  planning  process  will  be \nbased  on  the  findings  of  a  prior  rapid  resource  and  ecological  assessment  conducted  by  the \nIndonesian  Institute  of  Sciences  (LIPI)  or  academic  and  research  institutions.  CRMPs  will \ninclude pilot activities intended to address identified priority issues and opportunities, including \ncommunity-based  monitoring,  control,  and  surveillance  to  address  issues  of  destructive  and \nillegal fishing. \n \n19. \nThe  regional  governments  will  be  assisted  by  MMAF  and  project  management  office \n(PMO)  consultants  in  the  establishment  of  marine  management  areas  and  the  conduct  of \ncommunity-based  enforcement  and  compliance  at  selected  sites  in  target  districts.  Marine \nmanagement  areas  will  be  co-management  areas  aimed  at  a  more  effective  management  of \nissues common to neighboring villages as well as external issues such as sand mining, trawling, \nand  biodiversity  conservation.  Marine  management  areas  will  encompass  the  local  marine \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n11  See Supplementary Appendix B for the CRM planning process and plan framework. \n\n\f6 \n\nareas of several villages and could extend to up to 25,000 ha. Marine management areas will be \nidentified,  delineated,  and  pilot-tested  in  each  target  district.  Under  the  overall  supervision  of \nMMAF  and  the  regional  governments,  with  support  from  the  sector  agencies,  regional \ngovernments  will  organize  and  manage  the  various  activities  involved  in  marine  management \narea  establishment  and  local  enforcement  and  compliance.  The  MMAF  and  regional  CRITCs \nwill assist in the conduct of field assessment activities and liaison between the community, local \ngovernment, and the communities. They will also assist in the conduct of marine management \narea  training  activities  and  provision  of  technical  advice,  and  will  organize  co-management  of \nlocal enforcement and compliance activities, including joint local patrols and reef watchers. \n \n\nb. \n\nNetwork of Coral Reef Information and Training Centers \n\nThe network of CRITCs established in Phase I will organize and link technical programs \n20. \nin support of coral reef protection and management and ensure appropriate technical direction, \nsupport,  and  integration  of  approaches  and  actions.  The  CRITCs  will  support  each  others\u2019 \nprograms by sharing resources and results, and by exchanging information and lessons as well \nas successful tools, strategies, and methodologies.  \n \n21. \nResearch.  The  Project  will  provide  funds  for  national  and  local  research  in  support  of \ncoral  reef  management  and  livelihood  development  using  research  expertise  available  in  the \ncountry.  The  national  research  program  will  be  carried  out  by  LIPI,  MMAF,  or  other  academic \nand  research  institutions,  or  consortia  of  public  and  private  organizations  under  the  overall \ndirection and supervision of the national CRITC. At the regional level, research activities will be \nconducted  under  the  supervision  of  the  regional  CRITCs  with  support  from  the  national \nCRITC/LIPI, as required. Research studies to be commissioned by the national CRITC, through \nthe  project  implementation  unit  at  LIPI  (PIU-LIPI),  will  include  strategic  studies  of  national \nsignificance such as those associated with policy development, biotechnology, climate change, \nfish stocks, trade in corals, trawling, biodiversity, and pollution. Research will focus on studies \nwith  practical  application  in  CBM,  including  coral  reef  ecology,  ecological  surveys  of  project \nsites, and socioeconomic surveys of target communities. \n \n22. \nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation (BME). LIPI will oversee the extension of the BME \nsystem and the Coral Reef Spatial Information System developed under Phase I to the Phase II \ndistricts and target sites to facilitate the evaluation of project impacts/benefits. BME will focus on \nquarterly creel surveys, semiannual reef health surveys, and socioeconomic surveys conducted \nevery  3  years,  each  providing  feedback  to  communities  and  partner  organizations  on  the \nprogress  of  project  implementation.  The  national  CRITC  will  play  a  key  role  in  aggregating \nselected data to provide a \u201creport card\u201d on the state of coral reef ecosystems and resource use \nactivities  every  3  years.  The  regional  CRITCs  will  coordinate  and  maintain  local  information \nmanagement systems required for BME with the participation of village groups/associations and \nin conjunction with local government agencies, research/academic institutes, and NGOs. They \nwill also establish and develop BME for the Project\u2019s field operations and the associated Coral \nReef Spatial Information System, and provide technical advice and training to local agencies in \nthe use of these systems. \n \n23. \nInformation Management. The national CRITC will be set up as the national reference \npoint or clearinghouse for up-to-date information on coral reef management in the country. It will \nprovide  technical  support  and  guidance  to  the  regional  CRITCs  in  database  development, \nmaintenance,  and  reporting,  and  collaborate  with  them  in  the  development  of  an  integrated \ninformation strategy and system design that will facilitate the flow and exchange of information \nbetween  project  locations  and  programs  and  with  partner  organizations.  At  each  regional \n\n\f7 \n\nCRITC,  an  information  unit  will  be  set  up  to  house  a  library  and  documentation  center.  The \nregional  CRITCs  will  coordinate  and  maintain  local  information  management  systems  with  an \nemphasis  on  collation,  packaging,  and  dissemination  of  technical  information  to  the  managers \ninvolved in national and district-wide planning, pilot initiatives, and CBM.  \n \n\nc. \n\nHuman Resources Development and Extension \n\n24. \nHRD  and  Training.  The  Project  will  develop  an  HRD  program  for  MMAF,  LIPI,  and \nregional agencies (such as dinas Kelautan Dan Perikanan [provincial/district Marine Affairs and \nFisheries Service] and BAPPEDA). The HRD program will be developed by senior management \nof MMAF/Directorate General of Coasts and Small Islands (DGCSI) and PMO with inputs from \nLIPI,  the  regional  governments,  and  the  RPIUs,  and  with  the  assistance  of  an  international \ninstitutional development specialist. Districts with high degrees of ethnicity and remoteness will \nbe given priority by the Project\u2019s HRD and capacity-building programs. The Project will support \na wide range of national- and local-level training and village development. A master training plan \nwill  be  drawn  up  by  MMAF/PMO  and  LIPI/PIU  to  be  implemented  by  concerned  government \nagencies  or  contracted  out  to  suitable  local  and  international  academic  institutes,  private \nconsulting  firms,  or  NGOs.  Training  contractors  will  be  engaged  by  MMAF/PMO  for  sector-\nrelated training or by LIPI/PIU for CRITC-related training.12  \n \nThe  local  training  programs  will  consist  of  short  courses,  training  workshops/seminars, \n25. \nexchange  visits  or  study  tours,  and  overseas  and  in-country  fellowships.  Training  will  cover  a \nbroad  range  of  subjects,  including  (i) management  skills  and  systems,  including  participatory \ntechniques,  policy  development,  project  planning  and  management,  monitoring,  recording  and \nreporting,  and  database  and  information  management;  (ii) marine  resource  management, \nincluding \nlegal  and  regulatory  aspects,  spatial  planning,  strategy  development,  CBM, \nenvironmental  impact  assessment,  resource  conservation  and  sustainable  use,  and  species \nprotection; and (iii) community and social development, including microenterprise development, \nfinancial management, and community empowerment.  \n \n26. \nExtension. The PMO will develop a comprehensive extension program to (i) equip local \nresource users and managers in coral reef management, (ii) strengthen coastal communities to \nmaster  technical  skills  for  livelihood  development  and  income  generation,  (iii) disseminate  the \nresults  of  CBM  activities  undertaken  by  the  Project  in  target  districts,  and  (iv) promote  and \nfacilitate  additional  investment  by  the  private  sector  in  successful  microenterprises  pilot-tested \nat the core sites. The extension program, which will systematically target priority groups in each \ndistrict,  will  be  implemented  in  cooperation  or  collaboration  with  regional  sector  agencies  or \nexisting government extension programs in the project sites. The RPIUs will be responsible for \ncoordinating the delivery of extension services by extension personnel from the dinas Kelautan \nDan Perikanan and other regional government agencies, with the assistance of NGOs involved \nin community empowerment activities.  \n \n\nd. \n\nProject Management Support \n\n27.  Management  support  will  be  provided  to  ensure  timely  and  effective  implementation  of \nproject  activities,  as  well  as  the  cost-efficient  utilization  of  funds  and  other  project  resources. \nProject management support will comprise (i) operations of a PMO in MMAF, an NPIU in LIPI, \n                                                 \n12  The  training  plan  will  include  (i) areas  for  training,  diploma,  and  degree  programs  to  be  selected;  proposed \ninstitutions; and duration of training; (ii) the justification for selecting international institutions for short-term study \nvisits  and  the  proposed  competitive  selection  criteria  for  local  training  institutes  and  international  academic \ninstitutions; and (iii) trainee selection criteria and proposed trainees. \n\n\f8 \n\nand  RPIUs  in  the  six  project  districts;  (ii) provision  of  specialist  support  through  international \nconsulting  firms  and  associated  domestic  consultants;  (iii) engagement  of  NGOs,  local \nacademic  and  research  institutes,  and  other  contractors  to  carry  out  various  project  activities; \n(iv) provision  of  equipment,  vehicles,  and  supplies  and  materials;  and  (v) setting  up  of \naccounting, monitoring, and reporting systems. \n \n\n2. \n\nCommunity-Based Resource Management and Development \n\nCommunity  Empowerment.  The  RPIUs  will  contract  the  services  of  NGOs  and/or \n28. \nacademic institutions to assist in organizing, training, and empowering the local communities at \nthe project sites for coral reef management, and social and livelihood development.13 The NGOs \nwill  carry  out  social  preparation  and  community  organizing  activities  and  facilitate  participatory \nplanning  and  decision  making  at  the  village  level  within  the  framework  of  an  overall  marine \naction  strategy  to  ensure  the  consistency  of  interventions  with  project  goals.  They  will  also \nassist  the  village  government  in  establishing  a  village  representative  forum  (badan  perwakilan \ndesa  or  BPD)  or  similar  equivalent  institutions,  where  none  exists,  and  organize  pokmas  to \nserve as their counterparts in project implementation. Finally, the NGOs, jointly with government \nextension  personnel,  will  provide  training  and  technical/administrative  support  to  the  pokmas \nand  other  community  groups  to  develop  their  capacity  to  organize,  manage,  and  administer \nCBM and livelihood activities.  \n \n29. \nCommunity Resource Management. The Project will support local communities in the \nmanagement  and  use  of  their  natural  resources  through  a  series  of  activities  in  the \nimplementation of CRMPs (para. 18). The CRMPs will be developed by the communities, with \nthe  assistance  of  NGOs  and  RPIUs,  and  will  contain  recommended  site-specific  resource \nmanagement strategies and corresponding CBM programs. The CRMPs, once approved by the \nlocal  government,  will  be  implemented  by  the  pokmas  and  other  local  stakeholders  under  the \noverall supervision of the BPD and with assistance from the concerned RPIUs.  \n \n30. \nCommunity  Social  Services  and  Infrastructure  Development.  The  Project  will \nprovide  selected  villages  with  assistance  for  village  and  community  development  projects  to \nimprove community welfare, health and sanitation, and education. Potential village development \nprojects include (i) basic services such as potable water supply, solid waste management and \nsanitation  facilities,  primary  health  facilities,  and  support  to  primary  schools;  (ii) basic \ninfrastructure  development  like  pathways,  boat  moorings,  jetties,  site  and  boundary  markers, \nand  village  meeting  places;  and  (iii) community  environmental  protection,  rehabilitation,  and \nenhancement  projects  such  as  soil  erosion  control,  village  tree  planting,  and  mangrove \nrestoration. The specific social services and infrastructure facilities to be provided to the target \nvillages  will  depend  on  the  identified  needs  of  the  local  communities,  as  gauged  through \nsocioeconomic and needs assessment surveys conducted by NGO contractors.14 \n \n31. \nCommunity  Livelihood  and  Income  Generation.  NGOs  and  government  extension \nstaff  will  work  closely  with  BPD  and  pokmas  to  assist  the  communities  in  upgrading  their \nsocioeconomic  status.  More  specifically,  NGOs  and  extension  workers  will  (i) assist  the \n\n                                                 \n13  NGOs will be selected based on criteria including (i) geographic experience, (ii) work experience, (iii) technical and \nfinancial  capacity,  (iv)  longevity,  (v)  recognition,  (vi) gender  orientation  and  experience  in  applying  participatory \napproaches, and (vii) ethical practices. Out of two facilitators per village, one will be a woman. \n\n14  As  the  envisaged  social  infrastructure  facilities  are  of  a  small  scale  and  will  be  established  on  public  land,  no \nresettlement problems are anticipated. Nevertheless, PMO will develop detailed selection criteria for the location \nand type of facilities or interventions proposed for establishment to prevent resettlement-related problems during \nproject implementation. \n\n\f9 \n\norganized  groups  or  interested  private  individuals  in  identifying,  developing,  pilot-testing,  and \nimplementing  microenterprises  and  other  livelihood  opportunities  in  the  area;15  (ii) provide  the \norganized community groups with extensive technical support services, including skills training \nand  extension,  in  particular,  to  transform  them  into  microentrepreneurs;  (iii) promote  group \nsavings mobilization; (iv) link potential borrowers to existing microfinancing schemes that could \nbe  tapped  for  identified  income-generating  projects;  and  (v) provide  marketing  assistance  and \nlinkages with input suppliers and output buyers. \n \nNGOs  or  other  training  contractors  will  provide  training  to  the  organized  community \n32. \ngroups  and  interested  individuals  in  credit  management,  entrepreneurial  skills,  and  business \nmanagement and operation. The NGOs will also disseminate information on existing microcredit \nschemes  in  the  project  provinces  and  districts  to  the  BPD,  pokmas,  other  groups  and \nindividuals,  and  assist  them  in  preparing  project  proposals  for  funding  through  suitable \nmicrocredit  facilities.16  The  Project  will  also  assist  small  producers,  processors,  and  other \nmicroentrepreneurs  through  an  inputs  assistance  program  to  be  operated  using  a  part  of  the \nADB loan proceeds.17 \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n33. \nThe  Project  will  adopt  a  holistic  approach  to  the  management  of  coastal  resources, \nparticularly coral reefs and associated ecosystems. It will focus on few key provinces where the \ncosts of delaying, and the benefits from expediting, such a project are greatest. The Project will \nbe nationally coordinated but implemented under a decentralized management, with the bulk of \nits capacity-building efforts to take place at the district (kabupaten) level and, to a lesser degree, \nat  the  province  level.  Close  coordination  and  effective  linkages  will  be  established  between \nnational,  regional,  and  local  governments  within  the  context  of  their  defined  roles  and \nresponsibilities in project implementation. Finally, the Project will adopt a participatory process \napproach  by  which  coastal  communities  will  have  the  opportunity  to  organize  themselves  with \nthe assistance of project facilitators, identify their specific needs, and plan and implement their \ncommunity-specific resource management and livelihood programs based on their own needs. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates  \n\n34.  \nThe  total  project  cost,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies  and  interest  during \nconstruction,  is  estimated  at  $41.25 million  equivalent,  comprising  a  foreign  exchange \ncomponent of $8.27 million (20% of total cost) and a local cost of $32.98 million equivalent (80% \nof  total  cost).  The  estimates  include  the  provision  for  $0.92 million  equivalent  in  taxes  and \nduties. The cost estimates are summarized in Table 1, and details are in Appendix 5.  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n15  Some  35  different  types  of  microenterprises  have  been  identified  during  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  as  having  potential  for  development  under  the  Project.  These  include,  among  others,  brick  making, \nbackyard  farming,  poultry  and  livestock  operation,  goat  fattening,  fish  processing  (e.g.,  pindang,  fish  crackers), \nmariculture, seaweed farming, and ecotourism.  \n\n16   ADB-financed Rural Income Generation Project (Loan No. 1583-INO). \n17  Essential items of equipment will be allocated to qualified and approved candidates on condition that they return \none set of the equipment (or products of equivalent value) for transfer to other beneficiaries. The items involved in \nthis  program  will  vary  from  one  site  to  the  other,  but  may  include  insulated  fish  boxes  for  fish  transport,  solar \ndriers, pindang boilers, hand casts, pearl or seaweed rafts, and fish cages (Supplementary Appendix C). \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates  \n($ million equivalent) \n\n \nItem \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA.

Although  Indonesia\u2019s  economic  recovery  continues,  the  economic  situation  remains \ndifficult and the fiscal situation is expected to remain unfavorable over the medium term. In view \nof  this  and  the  core  poverty  intervention  nature  of  the  Project,  ADB\u2019s  cost-sharing  of  80%  of \nproject financing is reasonable.  \n \n36. \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  to  Indonesia  in  the  amount  of  $33 million \nequivalent (80% of the total project cost) from its Special Funds resources to finance the entire \nforeign  exchange  cost  of  $8.27 million  equivalent  and  a  portion  of  the  local  currency  cost \namounting  to  $24.73 million  equivalent  (75%  of  total  local  costs).  The  loan  will  have  an \namortization period of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of \n1% per year on principal amount disbursed during the grace period, and 1.5% per year during \nthe remaining amortization period. The remaining local currency cost of $8.25 million equivalent \nwill be financed by the Government and project beneficiaries. The government contribution will \ncome from the central Government and the governments of the three provinces and six districts. \nBeneficiaries\u2019  contribution  will  be  in  the  form  of  labor  for  community-based  law  enforcement, \nconstruction and improvement of various small-scale infrastructure facilities and access roads, \nand livelihood development activities. The financing plan is summarized in Table 2; details are \nin Appendix 5. \n\n\f11 \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million equivalent) \n \n\nSource \n\nA.  ADB \nB.  Government \n      1.

MMAF will be the Executing Agency (EA) for \n37. \nthe  Project,  and  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  the  coordination,  supervision,  and \nimplementation of all project activities. MMAF has the mandate for marine and coastal resource \nmanagement  in  the  country,  and  is  the  EA  for  the  ongoing  Coastal  Community  Development \nand Fisheries Resource Management Project (Loans 1570/1571 [SF]-INO) and the Marine and \nCoastal  Resources  Management  Project  (Loan  1770  [SF]-INO).  Although  the  Ministry  was \ncreated only in 1999, MMAF has a strong group of senior fisheries and resource management \nspecialists who have accumulated extensive experience in implementing and monitoring ADB-\nfunded  projects  under  the  Directorate  General  of  Fisheries.  The  following  four  directorates \ngeneral  will  be  working  closely  with  each  other  to  implement  the  Project:  (i) Coasts  and  Small \nIslands,  (ii) Capture  Fisheries,  (iii) Aquaculture,  and  (iv) Marine  Resource  and  Fisheries \nControlling.  LIPI  will  be  the  national  Implementing  Agency  (IA)  responsible  for  the  overall \ncoordination  of  CRITC  operation,  including  information,  monitoring,  research,  and  training. \nOther  IAs  include  the  provincial  and  district  government  agencies  in  the  project  areas, \nparticularly  BAPPEDA  and  dinas  Kelautan  Dan  Perikanan.  The  national  CRITC  that  has  been \nset up at LIPI will be the lead IA for research, training, and information management.  \n \n38. \nPMO and PIUs. To oversee the day-to-day implementation of the Project, a PMO will be \nset up within DGCSI. The PMO will be headed by a full-time project director who will report to \nthe  director  general,  DGCSI.  It  will  have  adequate  qualified  technical  and  administrative  staff \nand will be provided with the necessary office and communications equipment and vehicles. It \nwill  have  the  following  responsibilities:  (i) planning  and  scheduling  of  project  activities; \n(ii) administration  of  contracting  activities \n(iii) bookkeeping  and \nmaintenance  of  Project  accounts  and  preparation  and  consolidation  of  liquidation  reports; \n(iv) supervision  and  monitoring  of  the  work  program  of  the  entire  Project  and  preparation  of \nconsolidated  monitoring  reports;  (v) serving  as  secretariat  to  the  National  Steering  Committee \n(NSC)  and  National  Technical  Committee  (NTC);  (vi) coordination  of  field  activities;  and \n(vii) liaison with ADB. \n \n39. \nOne  national  and  six  regional  PIUs  will  be  set  up  to  oversee  and  coordinate  the \nimplementation of project activities in the field. The PIU-LIPI will be set up in LIPI and the RPIUs \n\nfor  national  activities; \n\n\f12 \n\nwill  be  established  at  the  district  governments  in  the  six  project  districts.  The  RPIUs  will  work \nvery closely with the bupati and district staff from the sector line agencies as well as with village \ngovernment heads at the core sites. The PIU-LIPI and RPIUs will be responsible for (i) planning \nthe  work  program,  administering  contracting  services,  maintaining  project  accounts  for \nmonitoring  project  expenses,  and  preparing  liquidation  reports;  (ii) supervising  and  monitoring \nthe  work  program  for  specific  components  and  activities  and  preparing  local  progress  and \nmonitoring reports; (iii) providing technical advice and assistance to local government agencies \non  the  technical  aspects  of  the  Project;  and  (iv) coordinating  the  specific  national  and  local \nactivities of the different project implementers. \n \n40. \nNational  Steering  Committee  (NSC).  This  will  be  established  to  guide  the  overall \ndirection of the Project and ensure overall coordination of activities. The NSC will be chaired by \nBAPPENAS and include the director general, DGCSI, as secretariat. Other NSC members will \ninclude  representatives  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  LIPI,  State  Ministry  of  Environment, \nMinistry  of  Forestry,  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  Ministry  of  Cooperatives  and  Small  Enterprise \nDevelopment,  Ministry  of  Health,  and  the  Navy.  The  NSC  will  provide  policy  guidance  as \nneeded to follow up on policy and legal work, resolve any interagency problems, and formulate \nsolutions  to  impediments  to  project  implementation.  It  will  meet  at  least  quarterly  in  the  first  2 \nyears  of  implementation  and  semi-annually  thereafter.  The  NSC  will  be  assisted  by  NTC \ncomprising the technical staff of NSC members, whose chairperson will act as secretary to the \nNSC. The proposed project organization structure is shown in Appendix 6.  \n \n41. \nRegional  Advisory  Committee  (RAC).  This  will  be  established  in  project  provinces, \nheaded  by  the  chairperson  of  provincial  BAPPEDA  and  composed  of  representatives  of \nconcerned  sector  agencies,  local  government  agencies,  NGOs,  and  community-based \norganizations  (CBOs).  The  RAC  will  oversee  local  project  coordination  between  participating \nagencies  at  the  local  level  and  liaise  with  the  NSC  as  required.  The  RAC  will  meet  at  least \nquarterly each year. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  6-year  period  (2003\u20132008).  The  project \n\n42. \nimplementation schedule is shown in Appendix 7. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nThe PMO, NPIU, and the PIUs will be responsible for the procurement of all goods and \n43. \nrelated  services  and  civil  works  under  their  respective  areas  of  supervision  (Appendix  8).  All \nservices,  supplies,  and  equipment  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with \nthe  ADB  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  All  goods  to  be  purchased  through  local  competitive \nbidding  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  Government  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nEquipment  and  materials  for  packages  valued  at  $500,000  or  more  will  be  procured  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Some  supply  contracts  and  certain  specialized \nitems  estimated  to  cost  at  $500,000  or  less  will  be  procured  using  international  shopping \nprocedures.  Minor  items  of  equipment  and  materials  costing  at  $100,000  or  less  will  be \nprocured  through  direct  purchase.  The  civil  works  packages,  which  are  estimated  to  cost  less \nthan  $1 million  each,  will  be  awarded  using  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  among \nprequalified contractors in accordance with the Government\u2019s standard procurement procedures \nacceptable  to  ADB.  The  EA  and  IAs  were  advised  of  the  need  to  maintain  transparency  and \naccountability, as required under ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy, in procuring goods and services. \n \n\n\f13 \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n44. \nTwo  groups  of  consultants  will  be  engaged  to  assist  PMO  and  LIPI  in  project \nmanagement  and  CRITC  operation,  respectively.  The  total  consultant  input  for  both  groups  is \nestimated  at  534  person-months,  consisting  of  54  international  and  480  domestic  person-\nmonths.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  of  the  consultants  are  in  Appendix  9.  The  consultants \nwill be selected following the quality and cost-based selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  Project  will  also  engage  NGOs  and  academic \ninstitutions to organize and assist local communities in undertaking resource management and \nsocial  development  activities  in  the  project  districts  and  in  accessing  existing  microfinance \nschemes  operating  in  those  areas  for  income  generation  projects  to  be  promoted  under  the \nProject.  The  NGOs  and  academic  institutions  will  be  selected  on  a  competitive  basis  in \naccordance  with  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  Project  will  also  contract  qualified \ndomestic  academic/research  institutions  and  consulting  firms  to  carry  out  various  research, \nspecial studies, surveys, and training programs in accordance with competitive selection criteria \nand procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements and Funds Flow \n\n45. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook. The commitment, direct payment, imprest fund, and reimbursement procedures will \nbe required by the Project. The Government will, immediately after the loan becomes effective, \nestablish a special account with Bank Indonesia (BI) to expedite disbursement of loan proceeds, \nparticularly  for  expenditures  under  small  contracts.  The  special  account  will  be  established, \nmanaged, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \nThe initial deposit will be based on the estimated expenditures for a 6-month period, but will not \nexceed  the  equivalent  of  $1.5 million.  The  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedure  will  be \nused to replenish and liquidate the special account and to reimburse eligible expenditures up to \na  maximum  amount  of  $100,000  per  expenditure.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  conduct  spot  or \nrandom  checks  of  expenditures  covered  by  SOE  through  disbursement  or  review  missions. \nNotwithstanding \nthe  Government\u2019s  own  disbursement  procedures,  sufficient  supporting \ndocumentation, as defined in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, must be kept at each level \nof  project  management  to  substantiate  all  expenditures  incurred  from  the  loan  proceeds.  The \nflow of funds is illustrated in Appendix 10. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n46. \nThe PMO, PIUs, and other agencies involved in project implementation will prepare and \nmaintain  separate  accounts  exclusively  for  the  Project  and  will  register  in  such  accounts  all \nreceipts  and  payments  for  the  Project  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  and \nprocedures.  The  accounts  and  financial  statements  for  each  fiscal  year,  including  the  special \naccount and the SOE records, will be audited by the sovereign audit agency of the Government \nor  other  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB,  in  accordance  with  appropriate  auditing  principles.  The \nPMO will review and consolidate the accounts from the various agencies and, after audit, submit \nthem to MOF and ADB. The audit report will include a statement verifying that funds disbursed \nby  ADB  against  the  SOEs  were  used  for  the  purposes  for  which  they  were  provided.  Project \naccounts,  including  financial  statements,  SOEs,  and  special  account  records,  together  with \ndisbursement documents, will be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB, \nand  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  not  later  than  9  months  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year.  The \nauditor\u2019s report will also include the auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the special account and the \nSOE  procedure.  Both  the  financial  statements  and  the  auditor\u2019s  report  will  be  in  English.  The \n\n\f14 \n\nGovernment and MMAF were informed of ADB policy on submission of audited accounts, which \ncovers failure to submit audited accounts and financial statements within the due time. A formal \nwarning  will  be  issued  for  accounts  more  than  6  months  overdue,  and  disbursements  will  be \nsuspended for accounts that are 12 months overdue. \n \n47. \nReporting  systems  will  be  set  up  at  the  national,  regional,  and  local  levels  to  enable \nDGCSI, through the PMO, to effectively supervise the implementation of all project activities and \nprovide timely advice and support to the PIUs. The PMO will be responsible for (i) collecting and \nconsolidating all project progress reports, site reports, technical and financial reports, and their \nsubmission to ADB; and (ii) preparing quarterly progress reports, the midterm project evaluation \nreport, and the overall project completion report. The PIUs will be responsible for (i) preparing \nproject  progress, \nfinancial  reports  covering  site-specific  activities;  and \n(ii) collecting  and  consolidating  field  data  and  feedback  from  local  participating  agencies  and \ncontractors that, in turn, will be relayed to the PMO. \n \n48. \nThe PMO will furnish quarterly progress reports to ADB on project implementation, to be \nsubmitted within 1 month of the end of the quarter to which they relate, and such other reports \nand information relating to the Project as ADB may reasonably request. Within 3 months of the \nphysical completion of the Project, the PMO will submit a project completion report to the NSC \nand ADB. \n \n\ntechnical,  and \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n49.  MMAF and LIPI will establish an appropriate project performance monitoring system in \nPMO within 1 year of loan effectiveness. The system will encompass monitoring (i) physical and \nfinancial progress as well as the economy and efficiency of key activities such as recruitment of \nconsultants,  procurement  of  equipment  and  materials,  training  arrangements,  conduct  of \nsurveys and special studies, policy development, drafting of implementation guidelines; (ii)  the \nlevel  and  adequacy  of  participation  of  various  stakeholders,  including  local  communities,  in \nproject activities, particularly those related to natural resources planning and management and \nsocial development; (iii) the Project\u2019s social, environmental, and economic impact, including the \nestablishment  of  benchmark  information  and  data;  and  (iv) assessing  the  effectiveness  and \nutilization  of  CRITC  networking;  and  (v) developing  a  mechanism  for  incorporating  lessons \nlearned from similar projects in the sector in project planning. \n \n50.  With the supervision of PMO and PIU-LIPI staff, contracted consultants will design and \nundertake a baseline survey. This survey will be repeated at midterm and at project completion, \nto provide information necessary to evaluate the financial, economic, social and environmental \nimpacts  of  the  Project.  At  the  community  level,  participatory  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be \nintroduced as part of the Project\u2019s comprehensive participatory development approach. Special \nstudies  may  be  conducted  to  investigate  issues  relating  to  project  implementation  and  its \nimpacts.  For  periodic  monitoring,  key  indicators  will  be  developed  and  incorporated  in  the \nregular  reporting  system.  PMO  and  PIU-LIPI  staff  will  make  regular  visits  to  the  field  sites  to \nmonitor  progress.  Project  monitoring  and  evaluation  reports  will  be  submitted  by  the  PMO  to \nADB  on  a  quarterly  basis.  On  project  completion,  the  impacts  of  the  Project  will  be  evaluated \naccording to a schedule and the terms of reference to be agreed upon by the Government and \nADB. \n \n\n\f15 \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n51. \nAt the start of the fourth year of implementation, a comprehensive midterm review of the \nProject will be carried out to identify any problems and constraints encountered and assess the \nneed  for  mid-course  modification  of  the  project  scope  and  implementation  arrangements. \nTechnical  and  budgetary  changes  to  the  project  document,  requested  or  arising  from  project \nperformance  monitoring  system  findings,  will  also  be  considered,  as  will  be  the  inclusion  of \nadditional  activities  at  any  of  the  field  sites  or  the  consideration  of  possible  expansion  of \nactivities/sites over the remaining project life. \n \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analysis  \n\n1. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analysis of Indicative Microenterprises \n\nThe  Project  will  promote  the  establishment  and  development  of  microenterprises  and \n52. \nincome-generating  activities  by  providing \nfinancial \nmanagement support program for its 90 target coastal communities.18 To determine the viability \nof  potential  microenterprises,  four  representative  microenterprises  were  subjected  to  financial \nanalysis at the farm level.19 The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) and the economic internal \nrate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  these  microenterprises  were  greater  than  the  estimated  weighted \naverage cost of capital of 16% and the social cost of capital of 12%. Details are in Appendix 11; \nfurther details are in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n\ntechnical  skills  development  and \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n53. \nThe  Project\u2019s  major  quantifiable  economic  benefits  are  envisaged  from  (i) rehabilitation \nof  coral  reefs  in  areas  previously  degraded  through  the  establishment  of  erosion  control \nstructures, artificial reefs, marine protected areas, fish restocking, and mangrove reforestation to \nrestore  the  abundance  of  commercially  important  reef  and  fish  resources;  (ii) reduction  in \ndestructive fishing and overfishing through effective information and education campaigns and \nmonitoring,  control,  and  surveillance  activities;  (iii) establishment  of  basic  social  services  and \ninfrastructure development to promote the socioeconomic well-being of the coastal communities \nto complement the conservation efforts of the Project; and (iv) establishment of microenterprises \nto improve the income-earning capacity of fisherfolk, thereby contributing to poverty reduction in \ncommunities that rely on reef resources for food and income.  \n \n54. \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  realize  an  EIRR  of  19%.  At  a  discount  rate  of  12%,  the \nresulting  net  present  value  showed  that  the  Project  is  expected  to  generate  approximately \n$32.4 million for the economy. Sensitivity analysis indicated that it would take a 56% increase in \nproject cost and a decrease in project benefits, global benefits, and microenterprise benefits of \n36%, 35%, and 35%, respectively, for the EIRR to decline to the cutoff level of 12% (Appendix \n11). \n \n\n                                                 \n18  The  Project  will  not  directly  finance  the  operation  of  microenterprises  and  income-generating  activities,  but  will \nprovide  rigorous  social  preparation  and  technical  demonstration  activities  to  be  carried  out  within  the  Village \nDevelopment  Plan  framework.  Prior  to  being  widely  promoted  in  the  project  target  communities,  the  financial \nviability of each type of enterprise will be assessed through feasibility and market analyses. \n\n19  These  microenterprises  include  (i) mud  crab  fattening,  (ii) estuarine  grouper  cage  culture,  (iii) seaweed  culture, \n\nand (iv) fish cracker making. \n\n\f16 \n\nB. \n\nSocial Measures and Impact on Poverty20 \n\n55. \nPopulation Size and Social Stratification. The total population in the six target districts \nin the project area is 1.8 million in 360,000 households with an average household size of five \nmembers.  Poverty  is  widespread  in  the  coastal  villages  of  the  project  area.  The  incidence  of \npoverty  ranges  from  a  high  of  83%  in  Nias  to  a  low  of  41%  in  Kepulauan  Riau.  Of  the  total \ncoastal households, about 53% fall below the poverty threshold, 13% are very poor, 40% poor, \nand about 16% are low income earners. The remaining coastal households, accounting for 31% \nof  the  total,  are  made  up  of  moderate  (11%)  and  high  (20%)  income  earners,  with  earnings \ngreater than Rp4.86 million (or $486) per year. Those that fall below the poverty threshold are \ncomposed mostly of small fishers, fish processors, and workers in the fishing industry and allied \nfields,  while  the  high  income  earners  are  businesspeople,  landowners,  big  boat  and  plant \nowners,  and  successful  entrepreneurs.  The  high  household  incidence  of  poverty  is  evident  in \nthe existence of the Government\u2019s Inpres Desa Tertinggal (IDT) program for alleviating poverty \nin most of the villages in the project area. Most of the households in the target communities do \nnot have the capacity to increase their household income from fishing, as most of their fishing \ngrounds are overfished and have damaged coral reefs. In addition, as most do not have access \nto  improved  fishing  gears  and  boats,  they  are  limited  from  exploring  new  fishing  grounds  or \nopportunities to increase their fish catch and income.  \n \nLack  of  Access  to  Basic  Services.  Human  development  is  weak  in  the  proposed \n56. \nproject  sites,  with  the  coastal  residents  having  limited  education  and  limited  access  to  basic \nsocial  services  such  as  potable  water  supply,  sewerage  and  sanitation,  electricity,  and \ntransportation. In many villages, only elementary schools are available, and some do not have \nany schools at all. The Project will support the establishment of basic services such as potable \nwater  supply,  sewerage  and  sanitation  facilities,  primary  school  facilities,  and  village  meeting \nplaces in villages where such basic amenities are lacking or inadequate. \n \nGender.  Gender  bias  is  strong  in  some  places.  The  educational  levels  of  males  and \n57. \nfemales are generally unequal, with men having a somewhat higher educational attainment than \nwomen.  Credit  is  also  generally  given  to  men,  especially  by  the  formal  financial  institutions, \nsince they are considered the breadwinners. A gender action plan will delineate how the Project \nwill  encourage  women\u2019s  participation  in  setting  up,  operating,  and  managing  small-scale \nincome-generating  projects.  The  PMO  and  the  PIUs  will  ensure  that  the  formation  and \nstrengthening  of  CBOs  will  give  equitable  opportunities  for  membership  and  representation  of \nwomen  and  for  women  to  assume  leadership  functions  in  the  organizations.  They  will  also \nensure that training courses are scheduled with special consideration given to women\u2019s needs. \nGender-disaggregated  data  will  be  collected  through  the  baseline  project  performance \nmonitoring system survey and in subsequent surveys; gender indicators will be included in the \nproject performance monitoring system. \n \n58. \nIndigenous  Peoples.  An  Indigenous  Peoples\u2019  Development  Framework  has  been \nprepared  for  the  Suku  Mentawai  people,  and  the  summary  is  available  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  H.  The  Framework  ensures  participation  of  indigenous  peoples  to  fully  benefit  from \nthe Project and guarantees that procedures for grievance redress are in place and functioning in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples.  \n \n59. \nconcerns \n\nImpact  on  Poverty  and  Social  Development.  The  Project  will  address  poverty \nits  core  development  activities  of  (i) community  empowerment  and \n\nthrough \n\n                                                 \n20  More detailed information is provided in Appendix 12 and Supplementary Appendixes G\u2013I. \n\n\f17 \n\ninstitutional  development  and  (ii) sustainable  livelihood  and  income  generation  to  enhance \nwelfare, thereby reducing exploitation pressure on coral reefs. Communities will be empowered \nand trained to manage, control, and utilize reef resources in a sustainable manner, and will be \nprovided  with  (i) basic  services;  (ii) basic  infrastructure  development;  and  (iii) community \nenvironmental  protection,  rehabilitation,  and  enhancement  projects.  However,  participation  in \nthe  Project  by  beneficiary  communities  will  be  purely  on  voluntary  basis.  The  Project  will  not \nimpose  any  specific  income-generating  activities.  Individuals  will  be  given  training  and  help  in \nobtaining funding but will not be given outright grants. Prior to the implementation of activities at \nproject sites, the communities will engage in a comprehensive planning process that identifies \nconstraints, risks, and opportunities. It will also ensure that indigenous peoples are consulted on \nactivity  development  and  are  able  to  participate  fully  in  and  obtain  benefits  from  the  planning \nand  implementation  of  community  empowerment  activities,  particularly  from  the  establishment \nof required basic services. \n \nC. \n\nEnvironment \n\nAn  initial  environmental  examination  conducted  during  project  preparation  concluded \n60. \nthat  a  few  adverse  impacts  could  result  from  some  income-generating  projects,  such  as \nmariculture, and the construction of small-scale social infrastructure facilities (Appendix 13 and \nSupplementary  Appendix  J).  However,  these  potential  negative  impacts  are  small,  localized, \nand can be avoided or mitigated by appropriate measures. None of the proposed interventions \nis  environmentally  critical  or  anticipated  to  create  significant  adverse  impacts  on  the \nenvironment.  Instead,  the  Project  is  likely  to  bring  about  significant  environmental  and  co-\ndependent  social  benefits  associated  with  coastal  resource  management  policy  development \nand  implementation,  institutional  development  of  government  agencies  and  community \norganizations,  and  community  empowerment  for  resource  management  and  socioeconomic \ndevelopment. \n \nA detailed environmental management and monitoring plan will be formulated in the first \n61. \nyear  of  project  implementation  with  the  assistance  of  an  environment  specialist.  The  plan  will \noutline the general guidelines and procedures for environmental screening, scoping, and review \nof proposed project activities in line with ADB and government guidelines. The regional CRITCs \nwill be specifically responsible for environmental monitoring and will be provided with necessary \nequipment  and  personnel  for  the  task.  Environmental  considerations  will  be  included  in  the \nselection  criteria  for  specific  sites  for  the  establishment  of  mariculture  and  other  projects  to \nensure that none of these is set up in environmentally critical or sensitive areas, such as marine \nparks  or  protected  areas.  Private  contractors  engaged  for  the  construction  of  social \ninfrastructure  facilities  will  be  properly  oriented  on  the  need  for  environmental  safeguards  and \nwill actively participate in environmental monitoring. This will ensure that any potential adverse \nenvironmental impact is minimized and that project activities fully conform to the environmental \nguidelines of the Government and ADB. \n \nD. \n\nRisks \n\nThe Project faces certain risks that could adversely affect project implementation and the \n62. \nattainment  of  project  objectives.  These  are:  (i) the  slow  growth  of  corals  that  could  delay  the \nrealization of project targets; (ii) institutional inadequacies in the EA and IAs, as well as CBOs \nand \nin  coastal  resource  management; \n(iii) uncertainties  emanating  from  the  evolving  decentralization  process  and  institutional \narrangements at the provincial and district levels; (iv) persistence of nonadaptive, control-based \nattitudes  on  the  part  of  national  government  agencies;  and  (v) government  limitations  in \n\nthe  communities \n\nthemselves, \n\ntheir  roles \n\nfor \n\n\f18 \n\nproviding  adequate  financial  and  human  resources  for  continued  implementation  of  project \nactivities and facilities beyond the term of the Project.  \n \n63. \nTo  minimize  these  risks,  the  following  countermeasures  have  been  incorporated  in \nproject design: (i) the adoption of a reasonable target of 2% coral growth per year in the project \nframework;  (ii) inclusion  of  a  substantial  institutional  development  and  project  management \ncomponent  in  the  Project;  (iii) adoption  of  a  \u201clearning  approach\u201d  to  project  implementation, \nwhereby resource management initiatives will first be pilot-tested in core sites prior to expansion \nto other sites; (iv) formation of an NSC, RACs, and a network of CRITCs; (v) establishment of \ninteragency linkages and close working relationships among NGOs/CBOs, local extension staff, \nlocal government agencies, and participating coastal communities; (vi) the use of a participatory \napproach  and  extensive  networking  and  interaction  among  the  different  project  implementers \nand  stakeholders;  (vii) provision  of  long-term  project  management  consultants  to  assist  and \nsupport PMO and the PIUs in project implementation; and (viii) design and implementation of an \neffective  monitoring  and  reporting  system  to  obtain  prompt  feedback  and  enable  timely \nremedies. ADB will also strengthen its supervision of the Project, including semi-annual reviews \nin  the  initial  years,  to  identify  problems  and  recommend  modifications  in  project  design  and \nimplementation  arrangements,  as  required.  Most  importantly,  a  strong  commitment  was \nobtained from MMAF management to support the Project, oversee project implementation, and \nprovide  counterpart  funding  for  project  activities.  Overall,  the  participatory  approaches  and \nsocial  preparation  activities,  together  with  the  technical  soundness  of  the  proposed  resource \nmanagement interventions, will result in the expected benefits and impacts exceeding the costs. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe Government has given the following specific assurances, in addition to the standard \n\n64. \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nPrior  to  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  establish  (i) a  national-level \ninteragency  NSC  to  guide  the  overall  direction  and  coordination  of  the  Project; \nand (ii) an RAC in each of the three project provinces.  \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  during  each  year  of  project  implementation, \nadequate budgetary allocation of all necessary counterpart funds will be provided \nin  a  timely  manner  and,  to  such  end,  the  Government  will  make  timely \nsubmissions  of  annual  budgetary  appropriation  requests,  including  funding  for \nrequired  after  project \nannual  operation  and  maintenance  expenditures \ncompletion.  The  Government  will  further  take  all  necessary  or  appropriate \nmeasures for prompt disbursement of appropriated funds on a timely and regular \nbasis \nthe  PMO,  PIU-LIPI,  and  RPIUs  during  each  year  of  project \nto \nimplementation.  \n\nThe Government will ensure that the proceeds of the loan and the corresponding \namounts of necessary counterpart funds will be disbursed to the PMO, PIU-LIPI, \nand the RPIUs for the respective project districts, by budgetary transfer of funds \nearmarked for such purpose.  \n\nThe Government will ensure that the provision of funds from the proceeds of the \nloan,  and  the  corresponding  counterpart  contributions  necessary  for  financing \nproject  activities,  will  continue  throughout  the  period  of  project  implementation \nnotwithstanding (i) any reallocation of authority or responsibility for channeling of \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\nfor \n\nthe  provision  of  corresponding  counterpart \nexternal  assistance  and \ncontributions  between  the  Government,  PMO,  PIU-LIPI,  project  provinces,  and \nproject districts; or (ii) any requirement for the provision of matching counterpart \ncontributions  for  funding  project  activities  from  project  provinces  or  project \ndistricts  arising  out  of  the  implementation  of  Laws  22  and  25,  unless  otherwise \nagreed by ADB. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure,  or  will  cause  the  project  provinces  and  project \ndistricts  to  ensure,  that  the  gender  action  plan  developed  for  the  Project  is \ncomplied with, so that there will be (i) equal opportunity for men and women in all \nproject activities; (ii) formation and strengthening of CBOs under the Project with \nequal  opportunity  for  men  and  women  to  be  members  and  assume  leadership \nfunctions; (iii) prioritized appointment of women as managerial staff to the PMO, \nPIU-LIPI, and RPIUs; (iv) prioritized fielding of women as community organizers \nby  NGOs  under  the  Project;  (v) inclusion  of  women  in  national  and  regional \npublic  sector \nthe  Project;  and \n(vi) preference  for  women  project  beneficiaries  in  microenterprise  training,  with \ninclusion  of  access  to  women  as  a  criterion  for  all  training  courses  under  the \nProject. \n\ntraining  programs  under \n\ninstitutions \n\nin \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure,  or  will  cause  the  project  provinces  and  project \ndistricts  to  ensure,  that  no  persons  will  be  adversely  affected  according  to  the \nterms  of  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy.  By  the  end  of  the  first  year  of \nproject  implementation,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  the  PMO  will  have \ndeveloped detailed site selection criteria for community infrastructure facilities to \nbe  financed  under  the  loan  to  screen  out  the  possibility  of  any  losses  occurring \nthat would require an application of ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy.  \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure,  or  will  cause  the  project  provinces  and  project \ndistricts  to  ensure,  that  an  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  will \nbe  prepared  by  the  PMO,  with  assistance  of  an  environmental  specialist,  within \nthe  first  year  of  project  implementation,  and  will  include  an  outline  of  the \nguidelines and procedures for environmental screening, scooping and review of \nproject  activities,  in  accordance  with  ADB  and  government  environmental \nguidelines. \n\n \n(viii)  The Government will ensure, or cause the project provinces and project districts \nto  ensure,  that  under  the  Project  there  will  be  continued  operation  and \nmaintenance  by  villages  of  social  infrastructure  constructed  under  the  Project \nthrough  (i) counterpart  support  in  cash  or  in  kind  and  (ii) a  memorandum  of \nunderstanding  between  each  village  organization  and  the  respective  RPIU \ndetailing  the  obligations  of  the  village  for  routine  maintenance  activities.  The \nGovernment will further ensure that the first such memorandum of understanding \nwill be subject to prior review and approval by ADB. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure,  or  will  cause  the  project  provinces  and  project \ndistricts  to  ensure,  that  all  necessary  measures  will  be  taken  under  the  Project \nwith  regard  to  indigenous  peoples  in  accordance  with  the  Indigenous  Peoples\u2019 \nDevelopment Framework and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples. \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n \n(ix) \n\n \n\n\f(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure,  or  will  cause  the  project  provinces  and  project \ndistricts to ensure, that the PMO and concerned RPIUs will develop and monitor \nmechanisms  for  consultation  with  and  participation  of  indigenous  peoples  who \nare  beneficiaries  in  project  activities,  including  community  empowerment  and \ndevelopment, resource management, and microenterprise training. \n\nThe  Government  will  undertake  all  necessary  measures \nthe \nestablishment  of  national,  regional,  and  local  accounting  and  reporting  systems \nto  enable  the  PMO  to  supervise  the  implementation  of  all  project  activities  and \nprovide timely advice and support to the PIU-LIPI and RPIUs. \n\nto  ensure \n\n(xii)  Within  3  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  MMAF  will  have  reviewed  the  policy \nframework  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Project  (Phase  I) and  will  have \nidentified  areas  for  incorporation  into  the  legal  framework  for  the  coastal  and \nmarine sector.  \n\n \n(xiii)  By  30  June  2006  the  MMAF  will  have,  in  consultation  with  all  concerned \ngovernment  agencies  (i) agreed  on  a  legal  framework  for  management  of  coral \nreefs  and  associated  ecosystems  taking  into  account  Laws  22  and  25  and \n(ii) recommended  and  submitted  a  Coastal  Resource  Management  Law  to \nParliament  for  enactment,  incorporating  provisions  in  accordance  with  the  legal \nframework under subsection (i).  \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n65. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  25,004,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Coral  Reef \nRehabilitation and Management Project Phase II from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an \ninterest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter;

With  an  81,000-km  coastline  and  17,508  islands, \nmuch  of  it  fringed  by  coral  reef,  Indonesia  is  truly  a  maritime  continent  rich  in  reef  resources. \nThe coral reefs cover 42,000 km2 or 16.5% of the global areas of coral reefs. In contrast, its land \nmass occupies only 1.9 million km2. Indonesia is the coral biodiversity center of the world with \n70  genera  and  450  species  of  corals.1  These  resources  support  many  coastal  communities, \nartisan fisheries as well as industrial fisheries. In 1997, the total product of coastal and marine \neconomic  activities  was  estimated  at  some  25\u201330%  of  Indonesia\u2019s  gross  domestic  product, \nproviding employment for about 20 million people.  \n \n2. \nIndonesia\u2019s seas have about 20,000 species of mollusks, 2,000 species of crustaceans, \nsix species of sea turtles, 30 species of marine mammals, and over 8,500 species of fish. No \ncomprehensive survey has been carried out in recent years to assess the current state of these \nliving aquatic resources, but it is believed that continued stress threatens the existence of many \nspecies. To protect marine biodiversity, the Government has planned to identify and designate \n30 million hectares (ha) for marine conservation by the year 2000, but only a fraction of this area \nhas so far been identified and is being conserved. \n \n3. \nDespite the importance of coral reef ecosystems to global biodiversity and to Indonesia\u2019s \neconomy and environment, this resource has not been managed sustainably. Resource use and \nexploitation have led to extensive coastal zone degradation, i.e., the destruction of coral reefs \nand  important  associated  seagrass  and  mangrove  ecosystems,  depletion  of  fish  stocks,  water \npollution, and biodiversity loss. Coral reefs are deteriorating rapidly, mainly because of intensive \nhuman activities such as coral mining, blast and cyanide fishing, sedimentation, tourist activities, \ncoastal  development,  and  pollution.  Using  a  measure  of  live  coral  cover,  a  national  survey  in \n1994  found  that  only  30%  remained  in  good  to  excellent  condition.  Global  warming  and \nassociated  coral  bleaching,  plus  increased  reliance  on  coastal  fishing,  have  further  damaged \nthe nation\u2019s reefs. Since coral reefs are habitats of about 90% of the fish caught by the coastal \nfishers  in  the  country,  their  degradation  results  in  rapid  decrease  of  fisheries  production  in \ncoastal areas.  \n \nThe  coastal  environment  has  also  been  affected  by  land-based  activities.  Watershed \n4. \ndeforestation and erosion have led to increased sedimentation on fringing coral reefs, adversely \naffecting fisheries resources. Industrial and urban wastes and runoff containing chemicals and \npesticides  from  agricultural  land  have  polluted  coastal  waters  and  impaired  the  ecological \nfunctions of coral reefs as nursery and breeding grounds for marine aquatic resources. An Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)-assisted study2 confirmed serious depletion of fisheries resources in \nthe  coastal  regions  of  Sumatra,  North  Java,  and  the  straits  of  Malacca  and  Makassar.  The \ndegradation  of  coastal  and  marine  resources,  including  coral  reefs,  poses  a  serious  threat  to \nIndonesia\u2019s rich and unique marine biodiversity.  \n \n5. \nCoral  reef  degradation  and  environmental  problems  in  the  coastal  zone  have  affected \nthe livelihoods of coastal people, particularly artisan fishers. Artisan fishing is the occupation of \nlast resort for many poor people in the country due to population growth, decreased availability \n\n                                                 \n1  Veron.

Corals of the Indo-Pacific.  \n2  TA 2053-INO: Coastal Environmental Management Planning, for $1.2 million, approved on 3 January 1994.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nof  farmland  and  uncontrolled  access  to  fish  resources.  Consequently,  the  number  of  coastal \nfishers increased by more than 50% over the past decade. Because of a deteriorating fisheries \nresource  base,  fish  catch  per  unit  of  effort  has  been  steadily  declining,  adversely  affecting \nincomes.  The  average  income  of  coastal  fishers  is  below  the  average  national  level.  Various \nstudies show that the coastal fishing communities are among the poorest segments of society in \nthe  country.  They  lack  access  to  basic  social  infrastructure  such  as  clean  water,  sanitation, \nhealth  care,  roads,  and  transportation,  and  fail  to  benefit  from  formal  credit  facilities  because \nthey lack credit history and collateral. \n \nB. \n\nPlanning and Management Framework \n\n6. \nLegal  and  Policy  Framework.  The  Indonesian  Constitution  requires  that  natural \nresources be managed to achieve the greatest possible benefit for the people. A number of laws \nrelevant to coral reef ecosystems have been passed by the legislature. The three primary laws \nare (i) Fisheries Act No. 9 of 1985, (ii) Conservation of Living Resources and their Ecosystems \nAct No. 5 of 1990, and (iii) Forestry Act of 1967. Other laws include (i) Environment Act No. 4 of \n1982, (ii) Spatial Planning Act No. 24 of 1992,3 and (iii) Environmental Management Act No. 23 \nof  1997.  Indonesia  is  also  a  signatory  to  a  number  of  international  declarations  on  natural \nresources  and  environmental  management,  and  has  issued  laws  ratifying  some  of  these \ndeclarations.  These  include  (i) the  Convention  on  International  Trade  in  Endangered  Species, \n(ii) UN  Convention  of  the  Law  of  the  Sea  (UNCLOS)  (1982),  (iii) International  Maritime \nOrganization laws on marine pollution (1969, 1971, 1989), (iv) the Global Program of Action for \nthe  Protection  of  the  Marine  Environment  from  Land-Based  Activities,  and  (iv) the  Global \nConvention  on  Biological  Diversity  (1992).  These  agreements  have  been  supplemented  by \nregulations  setting  out  basic  sector  policies  on  mining,  fisheries,  forestry,  and  environment. \nThere  are,  in  addition,  customary  local  laws  governing  the  allocation  and  use  of  natural \nresources, but these laws are now seldom applied or observed. The enforcement of laws and \nregulations has, however, been weak and many resource allocation and resource use decisions \nwere taken at high levels of Government without proper consultation with local governments and \naffected communities. \n \n7. \nLaw 22/1999 on Regional Governance and Law 25/1999 on Financial Balance between \nCentral and Regional Governments seek to address these weaknesses and have added a new \ndimension  to  governance  and  natural  resources  planning  and  management.  Law  22  aims  to \ndecentralize most government services and to devolve planning and management functions and \nresponsibilities  for  marine  and  coastal  resources  within  Indonesia\u2019s  territorial  waters  to  the \nprovincial  and  district  governments.  It  also  provides  incentives  to  local  governments  for \nsustainable management of natural resources within their respective jurisdictions and requires a \nrevision of some existing laws and regulations to bring them into harmony with it.  \n \nA  National  Strategy  and  Action  Plan  for  Coral  Reef  Ecosystem  Conservation  and \n8. \nManagement was issued by the Ministry of Environment in 1992. The document lists the priority \nobjectives on coral reef management as: (i)  improving community awareness and participation, \n(ii) increasing  the  coverage  of  marine  conservation  areas  and  improving  the  monitoring  and \nmanagement  of  existing  areas,  (iii) establishing  spatial  planning  and  zoning  to  prevent \noverexploitation,  (iv) improving  coordination  among  relevant  agencies,  and  (v) establishing  a \ncoordinated research program on coral reefs and associated ecosystems. A National Coral Reef \nPolicy  was  also  drafted  under  Phase  I  of  the  Project,  but  is  yet  to  be  operationalized  at  the \nregional level. \n\n                                                 \n3  The  Act,  which  provides  the  framework  and  legal  basis  for  natural  resources  planning  and  resource  allocation, \n\nneeds to be amended for consistency with provisions of recent laws on decentralization. \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n9. \nInstitutional  Framework.  The  Ministry  of  Marine  Affairs  and  Fisheries  (MMAF)  was \nestablished in 1999, with a pronounced vision of the sea as the nation\u2019s future. The Government \nhas targeted to establish and manage 10 million ha of marine conservation areas in accordance \nwith  the  Biodiversity  Action  Plan  of  1993.  Within  MMAF,  a  Directorate  General  of  Marine \nResources  and  Fisheries  Controlling  (DGMRFC)  was  established  exclusively  for  protecting \nmarine  reserves  and  enforcing  laws  and  regulations  in  harvesting  marine  resources,  including \nthe coral reefs. In addition to MMAF, however, there are other agencies involved in regulating \nand promoting the use, protection, and management of coral reef ecosystems, and they are not \nproperly coordinated. Institutional weaknesses and lack of political will have failed to sufficiently \ninstitutionalize  the  spatial  planning  concept  in  managing  marine  and  terrestrial  resources,  as \nembodied in the Spatial Planning Act 24/1992. Nongovernment organizations (NGOs) are also \nplaying  an  increasingly  significant  role  in  promoting  and  facilitating  the  establishment  of \nconservation and sustainable development programs.  \n \n10. \nPlanning  Framework.  In  the  past,  national  development  policy  formulation  was \nundertaken  in  the  context  of  macroeconomic  development  that  was,  in  turn,  translated  into  a \nregional  economic  approach.  This  led  to  a  planning  system  that  often  overlooked  resource \nsustainability.  However,  over  the  past  decade,  there  has  been  a  shift  in  emphasis,  with \nmeasures  introduced  for  resource  values  to  be  taken  into  account  in  preparing  development \nplans. Projects have been implemented to enhance the capabilities of government agencies for \ndata  acquisition  and  exchange,  and  resource  assessment.4  An  important  contribution  of  these \nprograms and projects is the heightened awareness created among government planners of the \nneed for sustainable use of resources, including coral reefs. However, most projects affect only \na  small  part  of  Indonesia\u2019s  land  and  marine  areas,  and  a  considerable  program  of  sustained \neffort will be required to make a significant difference to the ways in which the country\u2019s natural \nresources, including coral reefs, are managed.  \n \nSector planning at the national level is the responsibility of individual ministries but, as a \n11. \nresult  of  Law  22,  national  sector  plans,  strategies,  policies  and  guidelines  developed  at  the \ncentral  level  are  now  implemented  by  provincial  and  district  agencies.  Provincial  and  district \nplanning  is  the  responsibility  of  the  respective  BAPPEDA  (regional  development  planning \nagency). Provincial and district BAPPEDAs are responsible to the governor or bupati for overall \nplanning within the jurisdiction and for coordinating sector plans prepared by regional services \nof  sector  agencies.  While  ADB-  and  other  externally  assisted  projects  in  natural  resources \nevaluation  and  planning  have  assisted  many  regional  BAPPEDAs  in  developing  human \nresources  and  strengthening  capacities  for  effective  planning,  further  capacity  building  efforts \nare  required \nfunctions  and \nresponsibilities devolved to them under Law 22.  \n\nfor  significantly  greater  planning \n\nto  prepare  BAPPEDAs \n\n                                                 \n4   These  include  the  (i) ADB-assisted  Land  Resource  Evaluation  and  Planning  Project  (LREP)  (Loan  730-INO), \n(ii) Second Land Resources Evaluation Project (LREP II) (Loan 1099-INO), (iii) Marine Resources Evaluation and \nPlanning  Project  (MREP)  (Loan  1203-INO),  (iv)  Coastal  Community  Development  and  Fisheries  Resources \nManagement  Project  (Loans  1570/1571[SF]-INO),  (v)  Coral  Reef  Rehabilitation  and  Management  Project  \u2013 \nPhase I,  (vi) Marine  and  Coastal  Resources  Management  Project  (MCRMP)  (Loan  1770 [SF]-INO),  and  (vii) the \nUSAID-assisted Natural Resources Management Project. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nADB-FINANCED LOAN AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \nPROJECTS IN THE SECTOR \n \n \n\nLoan/TA Number \n\n \nTitle \n\nAmount \n($'000) \n\nDate \nApproved \n\nLoans \n94(SF) \n154(SF)/155 \n216 \n474 \n566 \n598 \n693 \n742 \n894/895(SF) \n959 \n1095 \n1203 \n1251 \n\n1475/1476(SF) \n1570/1571(SF) \n\n1613 \n1770 (SF) \nSubtotal \nTAs \n236 \n368 \n395 \n415 \n422 \n464 \n529 \n661 \n818 \n847 \n1424 \n1551 \n\n1550 \n\n1791 \n1828 \n\n2053 \n2529 \n\n2535 \n2958 \n\nSubtotal  \nTotal \n\n \nRiau Fisheries Development  \nIrian Jaya Fisheries Development  \nJava Fisheries Development  \nSumatra Fisheries Development  \nSecond Irian Jaya Fisheries Development  \nBrackishwater Aquaculture Development  \nFisheries Infrastructure (Sector) \nFisheries Industries Credit  \nMarine Science Education  \nSecond Brackishwater Aquaculture Development  \nSecond Fisheries Industries Credit  \nMarine Resources Evaluation and Planning  \nMangrove Rehabilitation and Management in \nSulawesi  \nSegara Anakan Conservation and Development  \nCoastal Community Development and Fisheries \nResources Management  \nCoral Reef Rehabilitation Management  \nMarine and Coastal Resources Management  \n \n \nSumatra Fisheries Development  \nSumatra Fisheries Development  \nSecond Irian Jaya Fisheries Development  \nBrackishwater Aquaculture Development  \nJava Fisheries Development  \nFisheries Sector Study  \nFisheries Infrastructure  \nSecond Brackishwater Aquaculture Development  \nSecond Irian Jaya Fisheries Development  \nFisheries Sector Study  \nMarine Resource Evaluation and Planning  \nStudy of Fisheries Development Potential in \nEastern Indonesia  \nStrengthening of Fisheries Term-Lending \nCapability of Participating Banks  \nFisheries Sector Study \nA Study on Shrimp Health Management and \nDisease Control  \nCoastal Environment Management Planning  \nCoastal Community Development and Fisheries \nResource Management \nCoral Reef Rehabilitation and Management  \nMarine Resources Evaluation and Management \nPlanning  \n \n \n\n \n\n2,500  \n7,900  \n13,200  \n14,000  \n34,000  \n23,000  \n50,000  \n65,000  \n73,350  \n38,000  \n100,000  \n33,000  \n8,080  \n\n45,600  \n41,000  \n\n7,000  \n50,000 \n605,630 \n \n\n98 \n200 \n150 \n100 \n180 \n50 \n237 \n260 \n75 \n455 \n480 \n512 \n\n380 \n\n600 \n400 \n\n1,200 \n480 \n\n600 \n600 \n\n7,057 \n612,687 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n6 Apr 1972\n4 Dec 1973\n21 Jan 1975\n23 Oct 1980\n25 Mar 1982\n11 Dec 1982\n25 Sept 1984\n17 Oct 1985\n14 Jul 1988\n30 May 1989\n22 Aug 1991\n8 Dec 1992\n9 Sep 1993\n\n17 Oct 1996\n1 Nov 1997\n\n1 Mar 1998\n24 Oct 2001\n\n8 Jun 1978\n23 Oct 1980\n15 Jan 1981\n25 Sep 1981\n20 Oct 1981\n24 Jun 1982\n28 Jul 1983\n28 Dec 1984\n12 Nov 1986\n20 Jan 1987\n23 Nov 1990\n22 Aug 1991\n\n22 Aug 1991\n\n20 Oct 1992\n29 Dec 1992\n\n3 Jan 1994\n5 Feb 1996\n\n15 Feb 1996\n19 Dec 1997\n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nA. \n\nBackground \n\nPROJECT AREA \n \n\nThe  Project  will  adopt  a  dual  approach  to  the  management  and  conservation  of  local \n1. \ncoral  reefs,  by  working  both  (i) extensively  across  priority  districts  and  (ii) intensively  via \ncommunity-based management (CBM) initiatives at core sites within the districts. By using this \nstrategy, the Project will be providing support to the management and conservation of 98% of \nthe total coral reef area of the three provinces of Riau, North Sumatra, and West Sumatra. The \nidentification  of  provinces,  districts,  areas  of  interest  and  CBM  core  sites  was  based  on  a \nreconnaissance  mapping  of  reefs  and  other  coastal  habitats  using  Landsat  TM-7  and  the \nanalysis  of  socioeconomic  data,  for  2000,  contained  in  the  national  PODES  database  of  the \nCentral  Bureau  of  Statistics  (CBS).  This  comprehensive  database  has  enabled  geographic \ninformation system analysis and mapping down to the village level. \n \nB. \n\nSelection of Provinces \n\n2. \nRiau and North Sumatra and West Sumatra provinces were selected based on previous \nfeasibility studies under Phase I and were reconfirmed during the project preparatory technical \nassistance  (PPTA)  for  Phase  II.  The  selection  of  these  provinces  was  based  on  (i) their \nimportance for reef protection and management and (ii) the economic significance of these reefs \nto the fishing communities in a total of 26 maritime districts. The three provinces have a total of \napproximately  320,000  hectares  (ha)  of  inshore  coral  reefs:  (i) 217,000  ha  (68%)  in  Riau, \n(ii) 36,000 ha (11%) in West Sumatra, and (iii) 65,000 ha (20%) in North Sumatra. \n \nC. \n\nSelection of Districts \n\n3. \nThe priority districts were selected on the basis of the potential ecological and economic \nsignificance  of  coral  reefs  within  the  district\u2019s  coastal  waters.  The  selection  process  was \ndesigned to determine, by remote sensing methods, the districts that have extensive coral reefs \ncombined  with  high  numbers  of  villages  dependent  on  marine  fish  resources  for  livelihood, \nemployment, and income. This resulted in the selection of six priority districts, namely: (i) Kota \nBatam,  Kepulauan  Riau,  and  Natuna  in  Riau,  where  35\u201364%  of  the  coastal  villagers  are \ndependent on fisheries; (ii) Nias and Tapanuli Tengah in North Sumatra, where around 98% of \nall coral reefs in the province are located and where about 31\u201336% of the villagers depend on \nfisheries for their livelihood; and (iii) Mentawai in West Sumatra, where around 90% of all reefs \nin the province are found, and where 32% of the villagers are dependent on fishing for a living. \nThe  six  priority  districts  have  more  than  300,000  ha  of  inshore  coral  reefs,  representing  some \n98% of the total reefs in the three provinces. These districts have at least 450 coastal villages, \nof which about 87% have adjacent reefs.  \n \nD. \n\nSelection of Areas of Interest \n\n4. \nThe next phase in the selection was the identification of areas of interest based on the \nfollowing  criteria:  (i) they  encompass  all  major  contiguous  coral  reef  areas  within  the  priority \ndistricts; (ii) they consist of at least 500 ha of reefs; and (iii) adjacent coastal villages are reliant \non  fishing.  The  selection  resulted  in  20  areas  in  the  three  provinces,  as  shown  in  Table  A4.1. \nThe 20 areas encompass about 300,000 ha of inshore reefs or 93% of the total available reefs \nin the six priority districts, and include about 159 (over 40%) of the coastal villages with fishing \nas the primary occupation. \n \n\n\fTable A4.1: Areas of Interest and Priority Districts \n\nProvince \n\nProvisional Priority Districts \n\nAreas of Interest \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n\nRiau \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNorth Sumatra \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWest Sumatra \n\n \nE. \n\n1.

Five  are  in  Riau,  two  in  North  Sumatra,  and  two  in  West  Sumatra,  including \nSiberut  Island,  which  is  considered  to  be  of  national  conservation  significance.  These \nprovisional sites encompass approximately 80,000 ha of coral reef, close to one quarter of the \ntotal  in  the  three  provinces.  They  contain  over  15,277  households  in  a  total  of  49  coastal \nvillages. \n\nTable A4.2: Provisional Identification of Community-Based Management Core Sites \n \n\nProvince \n\nProvisional District \n\nProvisional Site \n\nReef (ha)\n\nHH \n\nFDV \n\nRiau \n \n \n \n \nNorth Sumatra  Nias \n\nKota Batam \nKepulauan Riau \n \nNatuna \n \n\n \nTapanuli Tengah \n\n \n \nWest Sumatra  Mentawai \n \nHH = household, FDV = fishing dependent village. \n \n\n \n\nGalang Baru \nNorth Lingga \nSenayang \nBunguran Barat \nSiantan \nLahewa or Kepulauan \nSirombo \nPulau Pulau Batu \nKolang\u2013Sibolga Lumut \nSiberut Selatan \nSipora \n\n8,935 \n3,135 \n21,744 \n21,003 \n4,866 \n3,023 \n\n7,670 \n2,963 \n3,850 \n5,950 \n\nCoastal \nVillages \n7 \n3 \n5 \n4 \n4 \n8 \n\n2,160 \n786 \n3,280 \n2,370 \n1,377 \n1,955 \n\n10 \n7 \n5 \n3 \n\n1,093 \n16,681 \n1,645 \n611 \n\n6 \n3 \n5 \n3 \n4 \n2 \n\n8 \n6 \n0 \n0 \n\n\f3\n2\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n5\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n33 \n\nNational Level\n\nPROJECT ORGANIZATION \n \n\nADB\n\nGovernment of Indonesia\n\nDGCF, DGMRFC, \nDGAF\n\nMinistry of Marine Affairs \nand Fisheries \n\nDirectorate General of \nCoasts and Small Islands\n\nProject Management Office\n\nPIU-LIPI\n\nRegional Coordinating Unit\n\nAcademic \nInstitutes and \nConsultants\n\nProvincial Level\n\nDistrict Level\n\nRegional \n\nConsultants/NGOs/     \nAcademic Institutes/ \nExtension Workers\n\nProject Implementation \nUnit \n\nCoastal Communities\n\nCoordination/advisory support/assistance\nCommand responsibility\n\nNational Steering \nCommittee, National \nTechnical Committee, \nBAPPENAS, MMAF, LIPI, \nand Other Sector \nAgencies\n\nRegional Advisory \nCommittee, BAPPEDA, \nNGOs, and Other Sector \nAgencies\n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  BAPPEDA  =  Regional  Development  Planning  Agency,  BAPPENAS  =  National \nDevelopment Planning Agency, DGAF = Directorate General of Aquaculture Fisheries, DGCF = Directorate General \nof  Capture  Fisheries,  DGMRFC  =  Directorate  General  of  Marine  Resource  and  Fisheries  Controlling,  DGSSP  = \nDirectorate General of Surveillance and Sea Protection, LIPI = Indonesian Institute of Science, MMAF = Ministry of \nMarine Affairs and Fisheries, NGO = nongovernment organization, NPIU = national project implementation unit, PIU = \nproject implementation unit. \n \n \n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nPROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE \n \n\nCOMPONENTS/ACTIVITIES\n\nYEAR 1\n\nYEAR 2\n\nYEAR 3\n\nYEAR 4\n\nYEAR 5\n\nYEAR 6\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1.

One  group,  the  project \n1. \nmanagement  consultants,  will  be  recruited  by  the  Ministry  of  Marine  Affairs  and  Fisheries \n(MMAF),  through  the  Directorate  General  of  Coasts  and  Small  Islands  (DGCSI),  to  provide \ntechnical advice and support to the project management office (PMO) and the regional project \nimplementation units (RPIUs) for project implementation. The other group will be contracted by \nthe  Indonesian  Institute  of  Sciences  (LIPI)  to  work  with  the  national  and  regional  coral  reef \ninformation  and  training  centers  (CRITCs)  in  coral  reef  research,  information,  monitoring,  and \ntraining.  The  consulting  firms  will  be  selected  following  the  quality  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The consulting firm to be \nengaged by MMAF will have a total input of 396 person-months, consisting of 36 international \nand 360 domestic person-months. The consulting firm to be recruited by LIPI will provide a total \nof  138  person-months,  broken  down  into  18  international  and  120  domestic  person-months \n(Table A9.1). \n \n\nTable A9.1: Breakdown of Consulting Services \n\nPosition \n\nNumber of Person-Months \n\nProject Management Specialist \nRegional Advisors  \nCoral Reef Management Specialist \nCommunity Development Specialist  \nMicroenterprise Specialist \nInstitutional Development Specialist \nTraining and Extension Specialist \nCommunity MCS Specialist \nPolicy and Planning Specialist  \nLegal Specialist \nDatabase Management Specialist \nEnvironment Specialist \nTotal \n\nInternational \n12 \n0 \n12 \n0 \n0 \n6 \n6 \n0 \n6 \n6 \n6 \n0 \n54 \n\nDomestic \n36 \n108 \n54 \n90 \n36 \n12 \n36 \n18 \n18 \n18 \n36 \n18 \n480 \n\n \n\nMCS = monitoring, control, and surveillance. \nNotes: \n1.

Economic \nanalysis was carried out for the Project as a whole, covering noncost recovery components as \nwell  as  microenterprise  investment  and  operation.  As  the  benefit  impacts  of  different \ncomponents of the Project are interdependent, project economic analysis was not conducted for \nindividual  components.  Economic  costs  and  benefits  are  expressed  in  terms  of  the  domestic \nprice numeraire. Detailed tables are presented in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nB. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analysis of Indicative Microenterprises \n\n2. \nFour indicative enterprise models were identified as possible income-generating projects \nfor  the  target  10,000  households  in  the  project  areas,  namely  (i) mud  crab  fattening, \n(ii) estuarine  grouper  cage  culture,  (iii) seaweed  culture,  and  (iv) fish  cracker  making.  The \nresults of the financial and economic analysis indicate that each representative microenterprise \nis financially sustainable and economically viable, with the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \nand economic internal rate of return (EIRR) above the weighted financial cost and social cost of \ncapital  estimated  at  about  16%  and  12%,  respectively  (Supplementary  Appendix  F).  The \nrelatively high FIRR and EIRR values may be attributed to relatively attractive domestic prices \nfor  these  commodities  and  the  local  abundance  and  low  prices  of  primary  production  inputs. \nAside  from  being  economically  viable,  the  representative  livelihood  projects  are  appropriate  to \nthe  project  areas  as  they  utilize  locally  available  resources.  About  10,000  households  are \nassumed to benefit from the microenterprises to be promoted by the Project through the inputs \nassistance program, delivery of extension services, and marketing assistance.  \n \nC. \n\nMajor Economic Benefits \n\n3. \nBenefits not Quantified. The Project is expected to produce benefits difficult to quantify \ngiven the nature of, and the limited time and resources arising from, its two major components: \n(i) institutional  strengthening  and  project  management;  and  (ii) community-based  resource \nmanagement  and  development.  The  preliminary  results  from  Phase  I  show  success  of  initial \nimplementation  and  development  of  these  two  components.  The  policy  and  strategy \ndevelopment  work  to  be  carried  out  under  the  Project  will  ensure  appropriate  controls  and \nguidance  for  local  development  activities,  thereby  reducing  adverse  environmental  impacts  on \ncoral  reef  ecosystems  originating  from  various  sources  including  unsustainable  fisheries \npractices,  mining,  tourism,  marine  transport,  land  reclamation,  and  urban  and  industrial \ndevelopment. The implementation of an institutional development component will build national \nand  local  capacity  in,  and  empower  coastal  communities  for,  community-based  management \n(CBM) and project implementation. It will also enhance interagency linkages and public-private \nsector  partnerships  in  income  generation  and  resource  management.  Information,  education, \nand communication programs as well as extension programs will result in behavioral changes in \ncoastal  inhabitants  and  bring  about  improvements  in  reef  health.  The  delineation  of  marine \nmanagement  areas  and  implementation  of  CBM  initiatives  will  lessen  the  destruction  of  coral \nreefs and improve rehabilitation efforts in the project area and, by transferring lessons learned \nat these sites to other coral reef systems, improve the general coastal and marine biodiversity in \nIndonesia. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n41 \n\nThe  enhanced  recreational  and  tourism  benefits  arising  from  the  improved  biodiversity \n4. \nand  aesthetic  appeal  of  the  generated  coral  reefs  and  fish  population  were  excluded  from  the \ncalculation of benefits. This is due to the difficulty in estimating consumer surplus for domestic \ntourists  and  economic  profits  from  foreign  tourists,  due  mainly  to  lack  of  reliable  data.  Health \nbenefits were also excluded from the analysis as these are not linked to improvements in coral \nreef quality and are associated entirely with the Project\u2019s social sector interventions. There are \nalso methodological difficulties and lack of reliable data for analysis. \n  \nQuantifiable  Benefits.  The  major  quantifiable  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  are \n5. \nenvisaged  to  arise  from  (i) rehabilitation  of  coral  reefs  in  previously  degraded  areas  and \nsubsequent  restoration  of  abundance  of  commercially  important  reef  resources1  through  the \nestablishment  of  erosion  control  structures,  artificial  reefs  and  marine  protected  areas,  fish \nrestocking, coral transplantation, and mangrove reforestation; (ii) reduction in destructive fishing \nand  overfishing  through  effective  information,  education,  and  communication  activities,  and \nmonitoring,  control,  and  surveillance  activities;  (iii) establishment  of  basic  social  services  and \ninfrastructure  development  to  promote  the  socioeconomic  well-being  of  coastal  communities \n(iv) establishment  of \nand  complement \nmicroenterprises  to  improve  the  income-earning  capacity  of  fisherfolk,  thereby  contributing  to \npoverty reduction in communities relying on reef resources for food and income. \n \nD. \n\nthe  conservation  efforts  of \n\nEconomic Valuation \n\nthe  Project;  and \n\n6. \nFor  this  Project,  all  benefits  were  estimated  through  the  specification  of  a  single \n\u201cincremental  scenario\u201d  that  is  relative  to  some  presumed  reference  case.2  The  reference  case \nrefers  to  the  estimate  of  benefits  elsewhere,  but  adopted  to  a  current  study  with  appropriate \nadjustments  to  capture,  as  much  as  possible,  the  unique  characteristics  of  the  areas  under \nstudy.  This  approach,  referred  to  as  the  benefit  transfer  method,  was  adopted  because  (i) it \npermits  a  standardized  methodology  across  multiple  districts  where  information  quality  and \navailability  vary  widely;  (ii) it  provides  a  relatively  simple  methodology  that  is  adequate  for \ndemonstrating the potential level of benefits associated with the Project;3 (iii) it permits linking of \nsome  of  the  project  performance  criteria  in  the  project  framework  analysis  (e.g.,  coral  reef \nquality,  incomes  to  target  communities)  to  the  dose-response  assumptions  in  the  benefit \ncalculation; and (iv) it can be easily replicated at other Phase II sites that may be supported by \nother financing in other parts of Indonesia where similar data constraints may be expected. The \nstudies or reference cases4 adopted to approximately capture the economic benefits likely to be \ngenerated  by  this  Project  are  presented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  To  make  the  resource \nvalues site specific, the reference values were adjusted for the target six districts of the Project \nusing available economic, biophysical, and demographic information.  \n \n7. \nEconomic Benefits. Global biodiversity values are typically quite high but are difficult, if \nnot  impossible,  for  countries  to  capture.  The  adjusted  incremental  benefit  values  for  global \nbiodiversity  attributable  to  intact  mangroves  and  coral  reefs  are  $43/ha/yr  and  $2,808/ha/yr, \n\n                                                 \n1  Such  as  reef  fish,  turtles,  b\u00eaches-de-mer,  giant  clams,  trochus  shells,  pearls,  and  other  mollusks  such  as  cone \n\nshells and cowries. \n\n2  Normally, project benefit-cost analysis (BCA) requires specification of differential benefits between a \u201cwith project\u201d \n\nand a \u201cwithout project\u201d scenario, and explicit definition of the two scenarios for areas under study. \n\n3  As these benefits are not direct financial flows related to project sustainability, a higher level of uncertainty in the \n\nbenefit estimates is acceptable. \n\n4  An  exhaustive  literature  search  was  conducted  to  obtain  reference  cases  that  would  closely  approximate  the \nuniqueness and characteristics of Indonesia\u2019s fishery resources. The only relevant and meaningful references to \nthis Project are presented herein.  \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nrespectively. Estimates of the global biodiversity incremental benefits are based on the 6,000 ha \nof  coral  reefs  and  1,625  ha  of  mangroves  directly  targeted  by  the  Project.  These  benefits  are \nassumed to peak only after the 12th year of project implementation. The summary of reference \nand  adjusted  transfer  benefits  of  coral  reefs  and  mangroves  attributable  to  global  biodiversity, \nerosion control function, fishery, and local uses is presented in Table A11.1.  \n \n\nTable A11.1: Summary of Adjusted Transfer Benefits and Project Benefits \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nArea \n(ha) \n\nTransfera \nBenefits \n($/ha/yr) \n\nTransfer  \nBenefits  \n($/ha/yr) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEstimated Project Benefits  \n\nFinancial \n\nEconomic \n\n(Rp million/yr)  (Rp million/yr)\n \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \n\n \n \n1.

The  results  of  the  EIRR  calculation  for  the  whole  Project  are \npresented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  The  EIRR  of  the  base  case  was  estimated  at  19%, \nwhich is comparatively higher than the opportunity cost of capital of 12%. At a discount rate of \n12%,  the  resulting  net  present  value  showed  that  the  Project  is  expected  to  generate \napproximately $32.4 million for the economy. \n \n9. \nSensitivity Analysis. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the effects of a \n10% increase in project cost, and a decrease of 10%, 30%, and 50% in project benefits, global \nbenefits,  and  microenterprise  benefits,5  respectively,  on  the  economic  viability  of  the  Project. \nThe analysis indicates that it would take a 56% increase in project cost and a 36%, 35%, and \n35% decrease in project benefits, global benefits, and microenterprise benefits, respectively, for \nthe EIRR to decline to the cutoff level of 12% (Table A11.2).   \n \n\n                                                 \n5  The global biodiversity benefits as stated in para. 7 are typically quite high but are difficult, if not impossible, for \ncountries  to  capture;  while  the  success  of  microenterprises  is  quite  unpredictable  due  to  dependence  on  a \nconsiderable number of factors, though only projects with high economic viability will be promoted and supported. \nFor these reasons, a sensitivity analysis for these key variables was conducted at a relatively high level.  \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n43 \n\nItem \n\nTable A11.2: Summary Economic Analysis \n \nNPVa \n(Rp million)\n323,835 \n265,740 \n233,358 \n121,209 \n238,048 \n\n \nBase Case \n10% Increase in Project Cost \n10% Decrease in Benefits \n30% Decrease in Global Benefits \n50% Decrease in Microenterprise Benefits \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value.  \na Net present value discount rate is 12%. \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n19.0 \n17.3 \n17.2 \n14.8 \n17.2 \n\n1.8 \n2.8 \n2.8 \n2.8 \n\n \n\n \n\nSensitivity \nIndicator \n\nSwitching \nValue (%) \n\n \n\n56 \n36 \n35 \n35 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nA. \n\nPoverty and Social Dimensions in the Project Area1 \n\nlimited \n\nlack  marketing  channels,  and  have \n\nPopulation  in  the  Project  Area.  The  total  population  of  the  coastal  and  noncoastal \n1. \nvillages  in  the  six  project  districts  is  1.8 million  in  360,000  households  with  an  average \nhousehold  size  of  five  members.  Poverty  is  widespread  in  the  coastal  villages  of  the  project \narea,  with  the  poverty  incidence  ranging  from  83%  in  Nias  to  41%  in  Kepulauan  Riau.  Of  the \ntotal coastal households, about 53% fall below the poverty threshold, 13% are considered very \npoor,  40%  are  poor,  and  about  16%  are  low  income  earners.  The  remaining  coastal \nhouseholds,  accounting  for  31%  of  the  total,  are  made  up  of  moderate  (11%)  and  high  (20%) \nincome  earners,  with  earnings  greater  than  Rp4.86 million  (or  $486)  per  year.  Those  that  fall \nbelow the poverty threshold are composed mostly of small fishers, fish processors, and workers \nin  the  fishing  industry  and  allied  fields,  while  the  high  income  earners  are  businesspeople, \nlandowners, big boat and plant owners, and successful entrepreneurs.  \n \nMost  of  the  villagers  in  the  project  area  are  highly  dependent  on  fishing  for  livelihood, \n2. \nwith  many  claiming  that  their  income  from  fishing  is  insufficient  to  meet  even  their  basic \nsubsistence  needs.  They  have  limited  capacity  to  explore  new  fishing  grounds  or  other \nopportunities  for  increasing  fish  catch  and  income,  have  limited  facilities  to  store  fishery \ntransportation  services.  Human \nproducts, \ndevelopment is weak; coastal residents have limited education and limited access to health and \nother  basic  social  services  such  as  potable  water  supply,  sewerage  and  sanitation,  electricity, \nand transportation. In most proposed project sites, the absence of clear legal \u201cownership\u201d rights \nto resource use has created conflicts in utilizing coastal and marine resources. Conflict is due \nmainly  to  outside  fishers  who  usually  own  fishing  vessels  and  use  specific  fishing  techniques \nthat enable them to catch more fish in less time than those using the more traditional methods \nof the local fishers.  \n \n3. \nGender Issues. A clear division of labor exists in many villages in the project districts, \nwith  women  and  men  undertaking  their  traditional  reproductive  and  productive  roles, \nrespectively. Women\u2019s tasks mainly revolve around household-related activities while men have \nprimary responsibility for making a living, mostly in fishing. The educational level of males and \nfemales is generally unequal, with men having a somewhat higher educational attainment than \nwomen.  Credit  is  also  generally  given  to  men,  especially  by  the  formal  financial  institutions, \nsince they are considered the breadwinners. Women not only have limited access to economic \nservices  but  also  have  limited  roles  in  the  family  decision-making  process,  particularly  for \nimportant decisions.  \n \n4. \nInstitutional Support Systems. In most project sites, there are either formal or informal \ninstitutions  that  have  experience  in  implementing  community-based  management  (CBM) \nprogram  activities.  Women\u2019s  groups  and  fishers\u2019  organizations  can  be  used  as  a  base  for \ncommunity  mobilization.  Similarly,  the  relatively  new  democratic  bodies,  such  as  the  village \nrepresentative forum and the village development management board, can be strengthened and \nempowered  to  assist  the  community  to  actively  participate  and  be  directly  involved  in  local \nresource management.  \n \n5. \nIndigenous Peoples. The Suku Mentawai people make up 80% of the total population \nof  Mentawai,  which  currently  number  about  60,987.  Immigrant  populations  make  up  the \n\n                                                 \n1  Additional details are presented in Supplementary Appendixes G\u2013I. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n45 \n\nremaining 20%, which include the ethnic groups of Minang, Batak, Nias, and Ambon. Although \nsome Suku Mentawai people are located also in the coastal areas, they reside primarily in the \ninland  areas  of  Siberut.  Suku  Mentawai  people  are  migratory,  moving  within  the  island  of \nSiberut,  with  livelihood  activities  centered  upon  hunting,  raising  wild  pigs,  and  growing  tubers \nand  cloves.  The  native  language  of  Suku  Mentawai  is  Bahasa  Mentawai,  an  oral  language \nheritage. Approximately 40% of the total Suku Mentawai people have received primary school \neducation.  Religious/spiritual  laws,  called  the  punen,  govern  relationships  between  people \nregarding  agreements  made,  but  none  delineates  resource  use.  Although  the  use  of  health \ncenters  is  increasing,  a  large  number  of  Suku  Mentawai  women  still  rely  on  the sikere,  or  the \nvillage  spiritual  healer,  to  assist  them  in  childbirth.  They  have  high  representation  in  local \ngovernments, and an increasing number now hold formal employment.  \n \nB. \n\nThe Project\u2019s Poverty and Social Strategy \n\n6. \nTargeted Interventions. As its primary beneficiaries, the Project will target households \nin the coastal communities with annual incomes up to Rp6.48 million ($648), consisting mainly \nof  small  fishers,  fish  farmers,  fish  processors,  and  workers  in  the  fishing  industry  and  allied \nfields. Those households with annual income over Rp6.48 million will not be included among the \nProject\u2019s target beneficiaries although their cooperation in project activities will be advantageous \nto the Project. Some project activities will benefit all persons or households in the community, \nwhile others will have a more specific impact on specific groups. The target communities will be \nprovided  with  income-generating  and  employment  opportunities  and  better  access  to  basic \namenities.  They  will  be  trained  in  better  resource  management  to  improve  their  productive \ncapacity and transform the fishers among them into responsible resource users and managers.  \n \n7. \nConflict Management. Resource management decisions taken by the local community \nwill  be  legitimized  through  the  establishment  of  new  measures  or  the  formalization  of  existing \nones. For instance, if there is a community consensus in managing a marine resource or area \nby prohibiting trawl operations within 12 miles of an island, this could be legalized to ensure that \nothers  recognize  this  decision.  The  people  will  be  involved  not  only  in  choosing  the  reef \nmanagement  area  but  also  in  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  local  rules  over  use  and \nprotection.  In  the  absence  of  resource  management  plans,  the  Project  will  assist  in  drafting \nregulations as required. Planning for coral reef management, village plan development, and the \nformulation of income-generating activities will be conducted in a participatory manner and will \nbe inclusive of the needs of indigenous coastal communities, where they exist at project sites. \n  \nPoverty  Mitigation  and  Social  Development.  The  Project  will  address  poverty \n8. \nconcerns \nits  core  development  activities  of  (i) community  empowerment  and \ninstitutional  development  and  (ii) sustainable  livelihood  and  income  generation  to  enhance \nwelfare, thereby reducing pressure on coral reefs. Communities will be empowered and trained \nto manage, control, and utilize reef resources in a sustainable manner, and will be provided with \ninfrastructure;  and  (iii) community  environmental  protection, \n(i) basic  services;  (ii) basic \nrehabilitation,  and  enhancement  projects.  However, \nthose \ncommunities  into  which  it  is  expressly  invited,  and  will  not  impose  any  specific  income-\ngenerating activities. Individuals will be given training and help in obtaining funding but will not \nbe  given  outright  grants.  Prior  to  the  implementation  of  activities  at  project  sites,  the \ncommunities will engage in a comprehensive planning process that identifies constraints, risks, \nand opportunities. A gender action plan will delineate how the Project will encourage women\u2019s \nparticipation and provide opportunities for them to play active roles in setting up, operating, and \nmanaging small-scale income-generating projects (Supplementary Appendix I).  \n\nthe  Project  will  only  enter \n\nthrough \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \n \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\n1. \nAn initial environmental examination of the proposed Project was carried out to ascertain \nits impacts on the environment and to identify and recommend measures to prevent or mitigate \nany adverse environmental impacts which could arise from project implementation.  \n \nB. \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n2. \nThe proposed Project is the acceleration phase of a national coral reef rehabilitation and \nmanagement  program  whose  overall  goals  are  healthy  coral  reef  ecosystems  and  prosperous \ncoastal communities. The Project will contribute to this overall program goal by (i) enhancing the \nnational  and  local  capacity  to  manage  the  country\u2019s  coral  reef  resources  and  (ii) rehabilitating \nand effectively managing priority coral reef ecosystems, thereby helping raise income levels and \nimproving  living  standards  among  poor  coastal  communities.  The  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  will  finance  project  activities  in  six  districts  in  the  three  provinces  of  (i) Riau,  (ii) North \nSumatra,  and  (iii) West  Sumatra.1  These  districts  are:  (i) Kota  Batam,  Kepulauan  Riau,  and \nNatuna  in  Riau;  (ii) Nias  and  Tapanuli  Tengah  in  North  Sumatra;  and  (iii) Mentawai  in  West \nSumatra.2  These  priority  districts  contain  more  than  300,000  hectares  (ha)  of  inshore  coral \nreefs, representing some 98% of the total reefs in the three provinces. They also have at least \n450 coastal villages, of which about 87% have adjacent reefs. In these districts, some 20 core \nsites  have  been  provisionally  selected  during  project  preparation,  but  will  be  confirmed  during \nthe implementation, subject to the Project being invited in by the local communities. Where the \ncommunities  do  not  fully  support  the  community-based  management  (CBM)  program, \nalternative core sites will be selected. \n \nThe  Project  will  have  two  major  components:  (i) institutional  strengthening  and  project \n3. \nmanagement,  which  will  comprise  (a)  strengthening  of  national  and  regional  institutions  in \npolicy,  strategy,  and  guideline \nformulation  and  resource  planning  and  management; \n(b) establishment and strengthening of a network of coral reef information and training centers \n(CRITCs);  (c)  human  resources  development  (HRD)  and  extension;  and  (d)  project \nmanagement;  and  (ii) community-based  resource  management  and  development,  which  will \ninvolve  (a)  community  empowerment,  (b)  community  resource  management,  (c)  community \nsocial  services  and  infrastructure  development,  and  (d)  community  livelihood  and  income \ngeneration.  The  detailed  description  of  the  activities  to  be  carried  out  under  each  of  these \ncomponents and subcomponents is given in paras. 15\u201331 of the main report. \n \nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n4. \nMapping  of  the  target  districts  by  Landsat  7  ETM+  satellite  imagery  showed  that  the \nthree districts in Riau (namely, Batam, Kepulauan Riau, and Natuna) have the most extensive \npooled coral reef cover of about 260,000 ha. This area represents over 67% of the 380,000 ha \nof  coral  reefs  in  the  three  provinces  (Riau,  North  Sumatra,  and  West  Sumatra)  combined. \nNatuna has the most extensive coral reefs, with about 125,000 ha, equivalent to about 33% of \nthe  pooled  coral  reef  areas  for  the  selected  districts  in  the  three  provinces.  Mangroves,  which \n                                                 \n1  The World Bank is expected to fund project activities in five other provinces. These have only been provisionally \n\n2 \n\nidentified and include Southeast Sulawesi, South Sulawesi, North Sulawesi, Maluku, and Irian Jaya. \nInformation  on  the  proposed  project  districts,  as  well  as  selection  criteria  used  for  identifying  them,  are  given  in \nAppendix 4 and Supplementary Appendix A. \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n47 \n\n \n\n \n\nact  as  biological  filters  and  buffers  against  coastal  erosion,  as  repositories  of  high  biodiversity \nand critical areas, and as nurseries for commercially important fish species, are common in the \nselected districts in all three provinces. However, the vast majority of mangroves are located in \nRiau, with some 43,000 ha (68%) mapped there out of a total 63,500 ha in the three provinces. \n \n5. \nVarious  socioeconomic  variables  were  collected  as  part  of  the  social  assessment \nconducted  during  project  preparation.  As  these  are  described  in  Appendix  12,  they  will  not  be \nrepeated here. However, in view of the causal linkages between environmental degradation and \nthe  principal  occupation  of  the  coastal  communities,  it  is  worth  mentioning  that  fishing  is  the \nprimary  occupation  recorded  in  over  half  (58%)  of  the  67  villages  proposed  for  Phase  II,  and \nmost  of  them  (25  out  of  39)  are  located  in  Riau.  The  estimated  population  of  the  proposed \nPhase  II  districts  is  about  103,360  individuals  living  in  22,251  households,  equivalent  to  4.6 \nmembers per household, higher than the national average household size of 4.3 members.  \n \nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nThe  project  activities  were  screened  and  the  results  tabulated  according  to  the \n6. \noperational  stages  of  the  Project:  (i) environmental  problems  due  to  project  location; \n(ii) environmental  problems  related  to  design;  (iii) environmental  problems  associated  with \nconstruction;  and  (iv) environmental  problems  resulting  from  project  operations.  Based  on  the \nenvironmental  screening  of  Project  components  and  interventions  using  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nAssessment Requirements (1998), the project components were classified, as shown in Table \nA13.1.  \n \n\nTable A13.1: Screening of Project Activities \n\n1 \n\nActivity \nComponent I: Institutional Strengthening and Project Management \nStrengthening of National and Regional Institutions \nStrengthening the Coral Reef Information and Training Centers \nHuman Resources Development and Extension \nProject Management \nComponent II: Community-Based Resource Management and Development \nCommunity Empowerment \nCommunity Resource Management \nCommunity Social Services and Infrastructure Development \nCommunity Livelihood and Income Generation \n\nNo \nNo \nNo \nNo \n\nNo \nNo \nNo \nNo \n\nNo \nNo \nNo \nNo \n\nNo \nNo \nNo \nNo \n\nNo \nNo \nNo \nNo \n\nNo \nNo \nNo \nNo \n\nNo \nNo \nNo \nNo \nYes  No \nYes \nNo \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n1 = Environmental problems due to project location; 2 = Environmental problems related to design; 3 = Environmental \nproblems  associated  with  construction;  4  =  Environmental  problems  resulting  from  project  operations;  No  =  no \nadverse environmental impacts; Yes = with potential adverse environmental impacts. \n \nFor  the  subcomponents  classified  as  Category  B,  some  prototype  interventions  were \n7. \ntested for their potential adverse impacts vis-\u00e0-vis the actions affecting environmental resources \nand  values  as  listed  in  ADB\u2019s  checklist  of  environmental  parameters  for  fisheries  and \naquaculture  projects  to  segregate  those  parameters  with  \u201cno  significant  impacts\u201d  from  those \n\u201cwith significant adverse impacts\u201d (small, moderate, or major). Small-scale village development \nactivities mainly involving the provision of basic social infrastructure facilities such as those for \npotable water supply, sanitation, public health, and physical access (e.g., small jetties for boats \nand  access  roads  leading  to  the  communities)  may  produce  minor  impacts  during  the \nconstruction stage. However, given that the development is of a small scale, the magnitude of \nthe impacts (e.g., dust and noise, road traffic) is also expected to be small and of a temporary \nnature.  For  example,  the  dust  and  noise  produced  by  the  construction  of  the  facilities  are  not \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nexpected  to  cause  a  major  disturbance  to  the  population  living  to  the  sites  of  these  facilities. \nBesides, these effects can be mitigated through proper site selection and construction planning. \n \n8. \nAmong 35 possible microenterprises tested for their environmental impacts, mariculture \nand land-based aquaculture activities were identified as having potential adverse impacts on the \nenvironment  (Supplementary  Appendix  C).  Small  impacts  could  arise  from:  (i) site  selection, \nparticularly  as  a  result  of  conflicts  with  other  site  uses  (waterways);  (ii) construction;  and \n(ii) operation,  specifically  water  pollution  hazards.  The  selection  of  sites  for  establishment  of \nmariculture  enterprises  should  therefore  be  made  carefully  and  with  full  consideration  of  other \nuses  of  the  sites  to  prevent  conflicts,  such  as  with  the  use  of  the  waterway  for  navigation. \nPrivate  contractors  engaged  by  the  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  for  the  construction  of \nsocial infrastructure facilities will be properly oriented on the need for environmental safeguards. \nThe  culture  method  to  be  used  should  be  extensive  or  semi-intensive,  at  the  most,  to  prevent \nwater pollution caused by excess fish feeds and fish wastes. Monitoring of water quality at the \nculture  sites  and  downstream  will  help  in  the  early  detection  of  water  pollution  and  the \nimplementation  of  mitigation  or  corrective  measures  to  prevent  further  damage  to  the \nenvironment.  \n \nE. \n\nEnvironmental Impact Monitoring \n\nIn  general,  environmental  impact  monitoring  involves  the  measurement  of  indicators \n9. \nbefore,  during,  and  after  the  establishment  of  project  interventions  to  determine  the \neffectiveness  of  management  measures  adopted,  assess  the  Project\u2019s  benefits  on  the \nenvironment,  allow  early  detection  of  environmental  damage,  and  ensure  that  environmental \nsafety  criteria  are  complied  with.  For  this  Project,  the  interventions  listed  as  having  potential \nnegative  environmental  impacts  should  be  monitored,  particularly  those  whose  effects  are \npredicted  due  to  site  selection.  Those  impacts  that  are  temporary  and  that  are  likely  to  result \nfrom  construction  or  renovation  of  physical  facilities  obviously  need  not  be  monitored  after \ncompletion.  A  detailed  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  will  be  prepared,  with \nthe  assistance  of  an  environment  specialist,  in  the  first  year  of  project  implementation. \nEnvironmental  monitoring  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  regional  CRITCs,  specifically  their \ntechnical  staff,  but  will  be  supported  by  the  national  CRITC  and  by  the  project  management \noffice (PMO) and the PIUs, as necessary. The results of environmental monitoring carried out at \nthe field level will be compiled at the PIUs and transmitted to the CRITCs for storage and easy \nretrieval. \n \nF. \n\nConclusions and Recommendations \n\n10. \nUsing  the  ADB  checklist  of  environmental  parameters  for  fisheries  and  aquaculture \nprojects,  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of  the  interventions  classified  under  Category  B \nwere  identified.  Examination  of  these  interventions  showed  that  none  of  them  would  need  an \nenvironmental impact assessment, i.e., not one of the interventions is environmentally critical or \nprojected  to  create  significant  adverse  or  negative  impacts  on  the  environment.  Only  a  few \nminor  environmental  impacts  are  likely  as  a  result  of  factors  related  to  site  selection  and \nconstruction,  but  these  are  small  and  avoidable/mitigatable  and,  in  the  case  of  construction-\nrelated  impacts,  localized  and  temporary  in  nature  and  could  be  minimized  through  careful \nplanning and the adoption of proper construction practices. Some socioeconomic impacts may \nresult  from  project  implementation,  but  these  could  be  mitigated  by  participatory  mechanisms \nand the application of conflict resolution techniques. Overall, the Project is not expected to result \nin  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  and  instead,  is  likely  to  bring  about  numerous \neconomic and environmental benefits. The preparation of an environmental impact assessment \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n49 \n\nis, therefore, not required, and this initial environmental examination can suffice for the purpose. \nNevertheless,  environmental  conditions  at  the  project  sites  should  be  monitored  regularly  to \ndetermine changes in the levels of essential environmental parameters, which indicate the need \nfor remedial or preventive measures. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n \n", "  \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 31 October 2002) \n", "Currency Unit\nRp1.00\n$1.00\n", "- \n= \n= \n", "rupiah (Rp) \n$0.000108 \nRp9,240 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013  Australian Agency for International Development \n", "ADB \n \nAusAID \nBAKORKAMLA  \u2013  National Coordination Board for Sea Security \nBANGDA \nBAPPEDA \n", "\u2013  Ministry of Home Affairs \n\u2013  Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Derah  \n(Regional Development Planning Agency) \n\u2013  Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional  \n(National Development Planning Agency) \n", "BAPPENAS \n", " \n", "BPD \nBME \nCBM \nCBO \nCRITC  \nCRMP  \n", "DGAF \nDGCF \nDGCSI \nDGMRFC \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", "EA \nEIRR \nFIRR \nha \nHRD \nIA \nkm2 \nIDT \nLCB \nLIPI \n \nMCSIS  \nMMAF  \nMOF \nNGO \nNSC \nNTC \nPIU \nPMO \nPROPENAS \n", " \n", "RAC \n", " \n", " \n", "\u2013  badan perwakilan desa (village representative forum) \n\u2013  benefit monitoring and evaluation \n\u2013  community-based management \n\u2013  community-based organization \n\u2013  coral reef information and training center \n\u2013  coastal resource management plan/coral reef management \n", "plan \n", "\u2013  Directorate General of Aquaculture Fisheries \n\u2013  Directorate General of Capture Fisheries \n\u2013  Directorate General of Coasts and Small Islands \n\u2013  Directorate General of Marine Resources and Fisheries \n", "Controlling \n", "implementing agency \n", "Inpres Desa Tertinggal \nlocal competitive bidding \nIndonesian Institute of Sciences \n", "\u2013  executing agency \n\u2013  economic internal rate of return \nfinancial internal rate of return \n\u2013 \n\u2013  hectare \n\u2013  human resources development \n\u2013 \n\u2013  square kilometer \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  monitoring, control, and surveillance information system \n\u2013  Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries \n\u2013  Ministry of Finance \n\u2013  nongovernment organization \n\u2013  national steering committee \n\u2013  national technical committee \n\u2013  project implementation unit \n\u2013  project management office \n\u2013  Program Pembangunan Nasional 2001\u20132005  \n", "(Medium-term Development Program) \nregional advisory committee \n", "\u2013 \n", "RPIU \nSOE \n", " \n \n", "regional project implementation unit \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013  statement of expenditure \n", " \n \n \n", " \n \n \n", " \n \nGLOSSARY OF TERMS \n", " \n", "\u2013  mayor \n\u2013  village \n\u2013  provincial/district Marine Affairs and Fisheries Service \n", " \n \n \n", " \n", "bupati \ndesa \ndinas Kelautan \nDan Perikanan \nkabupaten \nkepala desa \npokmas \nperda \npunen \nunit desa \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "\u2013  district \n\u2013  village head \n\u2013  village group \n\u2013  village regulation \n\u2013 \nreligious/spiritual laws \n\u2013  village banking structure \n", " \nNOTE \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "This  Report  was  prepared  by  a  team  consisting  of  W.
