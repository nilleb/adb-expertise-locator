It is in substantive terms \na continuation of DPSPs 1\u20133, the programmatic series of annual \nsingle-tranche  operations  from  2005  to  2007.  The  DPSP \nseries\u2014cofinancing  the  Development  Policy  Loan  (DPL)  series \nsupported by the World Bank and the Government of Japan\u2014is \nthe  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  National \nembedded \nDevelopment  Plan  (RPJM)  for  2004\u20132009.  It  supports  the \nRPJM\u2019s  broad  goals  of  stimulating  higher  and  sustainable \neconomic  growth  with  lower  levels  of  unemployment  and \npoverty, in three core areas: (i) investment climate, (ii) enhanced \npublic  financial  management  and  governance,  and  (iii)  public \nservice delivery to the poor. The DPSP-4 is also proposed as a \nsingle-tranche  operation  based  on \ncompleted  actions \nIt  builds  on  reforms \ndemonstrating  satisfactory  progress. \nundertaken  during  past  DPSPs  and  sets  the  groundwork  for  an \nexpanded policy dialogue for future operations. \n \nIn addition to the economic rationale mentioned above, the DPL \nseries  aims  to  harmonize  policy  reform  support  from  key \ndevelopment  partners.  The \nthe  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  in  the  DPL  process  effectively  builds \non  and  deepens  sector-specific  reforms  supported  by  ADB \nthrough  its  past,  ongoing,  and  planned  operations  under  the \nIndonesia country strategy and program 2006\u20132009. \n \nADB\u2019s participation in the DPL also stems from its endeavors to \nreduce  transaction  costs  for  its  developing  member  countries. \nThe  approach  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  reform  agenda,  as \noutlined  in  the  long-term  strategic  framework  and  the  middle-\nthe  DPL  helps \nincome  country \nimplement and fulfill ADB\u2019s obligations to the Rome Declaration \non Harmonization (February 2003) and the Paris Declaration on \nAid Effectiveness (March 2005). \n\ninitiative.  Participation \n\ninvolvement  of \n\nin \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nThe impact of the DPSP-4 will be in the form of higher economic \ngrowth that is sustained over the medium term, and lower levels \nof poverty and unemployment. Its principal outcome is improved \noverall  economic  management  anchored  on  good  governance \nthrough  (i)  an  investment  climate,  (ii)  improved  public  financial \nmanagement  and  good  governance,  and  (iii)  improved  delivery \nof public services.  \n \nFor the DPSP-4, the Government has requested ADB to provide \na loan of $200 million. The DPSP-4 provides parallel cofinancing \nfor  the  World  Bank-supported  fifth  DPL  (DPL-5),  for  which  the \nGovernment  has  requested  $750  million.  The  Government  also \nintends  to  request  parallel  cofinancing  of  $100  million  from  the \nGovernment of Japan for the DPL-5. \n \n\nthe \n\n \nDisbursement \n\n \nProgram Period \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  single-tranche  program  loan  of  $200  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources will be provided under ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.  The  loan \nwill have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum; \nconversion options that may be exercised in accordance with the \ndraft  Loan  Agreement, \nloan  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s \nconversion  guidelines;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as \nare set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. \n \nThe loan will be disbursed in a single tranche upon declaration of \nloan effectiveness. \n \nThe  program  implementation  period  for  the  DPSP-4  is  from \nJanuary  to  December  2008  and  the  loan  amount  will  be \ndisbursed \nloan \neffectiveness. All actions included in the policy matrix have been \nimplemented within the year. The DPSP-4 fits within the overall \nreform  agenda  supported  under  the  DPLs,  which  cover  2003\u2013\n2008. \n \nCoordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nexchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans (1998), the loan proceeds will \nbe  disbursed  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  as  the  Borrower.  No \nsupporting import documentation will be required if, during each \nyear  when  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the \nvalue  of \nfrom \nnonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\ntranche  upon  declaration  of \n\nimports  minus \n\nin  a  single \n\nIndonesia\u2019s \n\nimports \n\ntotal \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nobjectives \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  medium-term \n\nunder other official development assistance is equal to or greater \nthan  the  amount  of  the  loan  expected  to  be  disbursed  during \nsuch  year.  The  Government  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this \nformula  with  each  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise, \nimport \ndocumentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be  required.  ADB \nreserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  and  verify \nthe accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \nThe key benefits expected from the DPSP series are (i) progress \ntoward \nof \nimproved \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  creditworthiness, \ninvestment  climate, \nimproved \nreduced  corruption,  and \ngovernance; (ii) raising the profile of key issues at the ministerial \nlevel,  accelerating  the  timetable  for  policy  actions  to  be  taken, \naddressing  administrative  and  bureaucratic  bottlenecks,  and \nproviding  an  impetus  for  decision  makers  to  coordinate  further \ninstitutional \nacross  economic  and \ndevelopment  within  government  institutions,  Bank  Indonesia, \nand banks; (iv) greater public confidence in the banking system \nstemming from implementation of the deposit protection scheme; \n(v)  sustained  ADB  engagement  in  policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment  on  the  direction  and  content  of,  and  strategies  for, \nits  economic,  structural,  and  institutional  reform  agenda\u2014with \nthe  DPSP-4  providing  for  policy  continuity  and  consistency  in \nsectors  where  ADB  has  been  actively  involved;  (vi)  facilitation, \nthrough crosscutting reforms, of sector-specific reforms in areas \nwhere  ADB \nsupport;  and \nis  providing  or  planning \n(vii) harmonization and parallel financing by the key development \npartners (ADB, World Bank, and Government of Japan) around a \ncommon  policy  framework  and  dialogue,  and  the  resulting \nendorsement  of  the  Government\u2019s  sound  policy  implementation \nand macroeconomic management. \n \nImplementation  of  the  DPSP  series  is  subject  to  the  following \nrisks:  \n\nline  ministries; \n\n(iii) \n\n(i)  External  vulnerabilities.  With \n\nindicators, \n\nimprovements \nin \nIndonesia\u2019s  resilience \n\nits \nto \nmacroeconomic \nexternal  shocks  has  increased.  Factors  limiting  the \npotential  impacts  of  external  shocks  include  diversity  of \nexports, limited external debt exposure, and an adequate \nlevel  of  reserves.  The  banking  sector  is  also  now \nsufficiently strong to weather a moderate external shock. \nThe  maintenance  of  a \nfinancial  sector  safety  net \nsupported  by  the  DPL/DPSP  will  help  to  improve  the \nresilience  of  the  banking  sector.  However,  significant \nsubsidies  continue  in  fuel  and  electricity,  despite  the \nGovernment\u2019s  decision  to  raise  fuel  prices  by  28.7%  in \nMay 2008. There is a risk of an adverse market reaction \nto  growing  expenditures  on  energy  subsidies.  Indonesia \nhas  considerable  gross  financing  needs  and  the  cost  of \nmeeting these will almost certainly go up if outlays on oil \n\n \nProgram Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nRisks and Safeguards \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n(ii)  Fiduciary \n\nsubsidies  and  budgetary  financing  needs  continue  to  go \nup.  In  such  an  environment,  a  sharp  deterioration  in \nIndonesia \nglobal  economic  conditions  could  make \nparticularly  vulnerable \ninvestor \nsentiment,  possibly  triggering  rapid  capital  outflows  and \nraising the risks of broader financial sector disruption.  \n\nto  sudden  shifts \n\nin \n\nconstraints. \n\nNotwithstanding \n\nthe \nimprovements under way, there are continuing concerns \nregarding  utilization  of  public  resources.

Ongoing  programs \nsupported  by  several  development  partners  provide \nsignificant  technical  assistance  support  to  strengthen \nfiduciary governance. The DPL/DPSP focus on improving \nin \nbudget  preparation,  execution,  and \nfinancial  management  will \nenhance \ntransparency.  \n\ntransparency \n\nsignificantly \n\nin \n\nthe  Government \n\nremains  committed \n\n(iii)  The  2009 \nlegislative  and  presidential  elections. \nto \nAlthough \nsustaining its economic reform agenda despite the global \neconomic  slowdown  and  general  elections  next  year, \nelections  often  reduce  the  time  horizons  of  politicians, \nleading  them  to  avoid  new  policy  initiatives  in  the \npreelection  period  and  shifting  their  focus  to  populist \nshort-term  measures.  This  could  undermine  the  reform \nagenda contained in the DPSP-4. There is, however, also \nthe  possibility  of  a  countervailing  tendency  where  the \nprospect  of  approaching  elections  spurs  political \nentrepreneurs \ninto  more  clearly  establishing  reform \ncredentials and recording clear accomplishments. \n\n(iv)  Heightened  security  risks.

The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE CONTEXT \n\nA. \n\nMacroeconomic Developments \n\n2. \nTen  years  after  the  Asian  financial  crisis  and  domestic  political  turmoil,  Indonesia  has \nemerged economically stronger, more democratic, and increasingly resilient to both internal and \nexternal  shocks.  In  the  past  5  years  in  particular,  the  country  has  performed  impressively  in \nterms  of  macroeconomic  management  and  political  stability  has  become  more  entrenched,  as \nthe  democratic  process  has  deepened  and  achieved  wider  acceptance.  Progressively  higher \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  has  led  since  2005  to  per  capita  real  GDP  exceeding \nprecrisis  levels.  Prudent  macroeconomic  management  has  resulted  in  lower  budget  deficits,  a \nmuch  lower  debt\u2013GDP  ratio,  and  manageable  inflation,  until  recently.  The  financial sector  has \nlargely  recovered  from  the  1998  crisis  and  market  sentiment  appears  largely  positive.  Exports \nare  at  record  levels,  the  balance  of  payments  position  is  strong,  and  foreign  reserves  are  at \nhistoric  highs.  In  addition,  investment,  while  still  low  by  historical  standards,  is  rising  fast. \nDespite the current global economic slowdown, real GDP accelerated to a 10-year high of 6.3% \nin  2007.  However,  recent  growth  has  not  translated  into  commensurate  increases  in \nemployment and reductions in poverty, and nearly half of the population remains vulnerable to \npoverty. The challenge is to build on the foundations of macroeconomic and social stability; and \naccelerate growth to reduce unemployment, poverty, and overall levels of vulnerability.  \n \n3. \nTo  achieve  these  objectives,  the  Government  is  pursuing  a  pro-growth  agenda  while \npushing  forward  on  broad  structural  and  institutional  reforms.  Progress  has  been  made  on  all \nfronts, albeit unevenly in some areas. Despite recent improvements, there is a continued need \nto  improve  the  investment  climate,  public  financial  management,  and  service  delivery \nmechanisms  to  the  poor.  The  DPSP  series  has  allowed  the  Government  to  work  with \ndevelopment partners in a flexible manner to implement critical high-level macroeconomic and \ncrosscutting  sector  reforms  that  address  constraints  to  growth  and  poverty  reduction  while \nproviding predictability of financial support. As such, its coverage is fairly broad. Governance is \na recurring theme throughout the DPSP series, as it aims to promote transparency in all its core \npolicy areas. The proposed DPSP-4 is anchored in the country strategy and program (CSP) of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB), 1  which  in  turn  provides  for  deeper  sector-level \ninterventions  to  complement  the  macroeconomic  and  governance  reforms  supported  through \nthe  DPSP  series.  The  DPSP-4  builds  on  past  DPSP  operations  to  support  the  Government \nfurther  on  key  reform  measures  in  the  core  areas  of  investment  climate,  public  financial \nmanagement and anticorruption, and service delivery to the poor.  \n \n4. \nIndonesia\u2019s  growth  performance  has \nremained strong, despite a deteriorating global environment. Having recorded its highest growth \nrate in a decade of 6.3% in 2007, the growth momentum was sustained at 6.4% during the first \nsemester of 2008. The main drivers of growth were private consumption, and gross fixed capital \nformation,  including  a  sharp  rise  in foreign  direct  investment.  While  still  below  precrisis  levels, \n                                                 \n \n1  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132009): Indonesia. Manila. \n\nSustained  Macroeconomic  Performance. \n\n\f 2 \n\ninvestment has steadily increased from 19% of GDP immediately after the crisis to 25% of GDP \nin 2007. Encouragingly, since 2007 investment growth has been dominated by a sharp increase \nin plant and machinery, auguring well for future production capacity.  \n \nDespite  the  global  economic  crisis,  Indonesia\u2019s  macroeconomic  fundamentals  held  up \n5. \nreasonably well during the first 8 months of the year. Indonesia\u2019s balance of payments remained \nin strong surplus in 2007, with the current account recording a surplus of 2.5% of GDP. Exports \njumped  by  31%  during  the  first  6  months  of  2008  because  of  higher  commodity  prices  and \nvolume growth. However, reflecting strong domestic consumer and investment growth, imports \nmore  than  doubled  during  this  period,  resulting  in  a  small  deficit  in  the  current  account  in  the \nsecond quarter of 2008. Foreign direct investment continued to remain strong during this period \nand reserves were at an all-time high of $60.5 billion at the end of July 2008, before moderating \nto $50.6 billion by end-October, as the Government attempted to stabilize the rupiah amid the \nglobal financial turmoil (para. 9). However, public debt has continued to fall as a share of GDP \nto below 35% in 2007 and is likely to approach 30% in 2008. Total external debt is also falling, \nmost  likely  to  be  a  little  below  30%  of  GDP  in  2008.  The  budget  deficit  remains  moderate \ndespite significant changes in the underlying parameters (para. 7).  \n \n6. \nLike its neighbors, Indonesia\u2019s inflation has risen sharply since the beginning of the year, \nto  11.8%  year-on-year  in  October  2008.  While  much  of  the  increase  in  inflation  has  been \nattributed  to  higher  food  prices2 (food  items  accounting  for  nearly  40%  of  the  consumer  price \nindex),  a  28.7%  increase  in  administered  fuel  prices  in  late  May  2008  added  to  subsequent \ninflationary pressures both directly and indirectly through generalized price setting. To address \nsuch pressures, Bank Indonesia has gradually tightened monetary policy by a series of 25 basis \npoint increases in interest rates that have led to its policy rate increasing from 8.0% in May 2008 \nto 9.5% in October 2008. \n \n7. \nIndonesia\u2019s  fiscal  performance  has  remained  strong  despite  pressure  from  increasing \nenergy subsidies. Energy (fuel and electricity) subsidies rose to 3% of GDP in 2007. The fiscal \ndeficit was, however, contained at 1.3% of GDP, slightly below the deficit of 1.5% projected in \nthe revised budget. Energy subsidies increased sharply in 2008 as the oil price assumption in \nthe budget was raised from an original $60 to $95, and then again to $110 per barrel. After oil \nprices passed the $110 per barrel threshold, the Government raised regulated fuel prices by an \naverage  of  28.7%  in  late  May.  It  is  applying  part  of  the  saving  to  fund  an  unconditional  cash \ntransfer  that  offsets  rising  food  costs  for  70  million  of  the  country\u2019s  poor  and  near-poor.  The \nGovernment  is  using  most  of  the  remainder  to  reduce  this  year\u2019s  budget  deficit.  The  oil  price \nhike  in  May,  combined  with  the  recent  decline  in  international  oil  prices,  has  helped  contain \nenergy  subsidies  in  2008.  Most  of  these  subsidies  are  highly  regressive\u2014the  richest  fifth  of \nhouseholds directly receive as much as two-thirds of Indonesia\u2019s fuel subsidy. Higher levels of \nfossil  fuel  subsidies  also  create  a  disincentive  to  invest  in  renewable  sources  of  energy  and \nenergy efficiency measures, producing a detrimental impact on the environment. A few selected \nfood  and  agriculture  items  are  also  subsidized,  but  such  outlays  account  for  a  relatively  small \nshare of total subsides. The real cost of the subsidies is the lost opportunity to invest increased \noil  and  gas  revenues  in  the  higher  priority  social  and  infrastructure  areas,  needed  to  sustain \nIn  2008,  development \nIndonesia\u2019s \n                                                 \n \n2   Rice had been the exception. Import restrictions in 2005 and 2006 left domestic rice prices almost 50% higher than \ninternational prices in late 2007. As a result, when international rice prices started rising in early 2008, the price of \nrice in Indonesia did not rise in parallel. However, the continued sharp increases in global rice prices reversed this \nrelationship and domestic rice prices started rising again. \n\nlonger-term  growth  and  development  objectives. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nexpenditures\u2014comprising  capital  and  social  spending\u2014are  projected  to  amount  to  2.8%  of \nGDP,  slightly  below  the  2007  level.  The  Government  is  well  aware  of  the  need  to  reduce  the \ncost  of  fuel  subsidies  and  has  indicated  that  steps  will  be  taken  in  the  future  to  address  this \nissue.  Efforts  are  under  way  to  contain  subsidized  fuel  consumption  by  possibly  capping \npurchases  of  subsidized  fuels  to  certain  amounts  and  to  replace  heavily  subsidized  kerosene \nwith  the  more  economical  LPG  as  the  main  cooking  fuel.  The  proposed  budget  for  2009  also \nintroduces  other  measures  such  as  sharing  the  cost  of  energy  subsidies  with  subnational \ngovernments,  and  linking  domestic  fuel  prices  with  international  prices  when  prices  exceed  a \ncertain threshold. The latest tentative projections for 2008 indicate a deficit of about 1.2%, lower \nthan the 2.1% deficit indicated in the revised budget (Table 1). This in part is based on buoyant \nrevenue  performance  and  expenditure  savings.    Revenues  are  likely  to  exceed  targets  by \naround  5.0%  reflecting  improved  tax  administration,  and  an  increase  in  oil  production  and \nconsequent rise in oil revenues.  Expenditures are likely to come in below the budgeted levels \ndue  to  reduced  oil  subsidies  on  account  of  the  recent  decline  in  oil  prices,  and  a  10%  cut  in \nroutine Government expenditures. \n \n\nTable 1: Central Government Budget \n(% of GDP) \n2007 \n\n2006 \n\n2008 \n(revised) \n\n2008 \n(outlook) \n\nem \n\n19.1 \n10.6 \n5.0 \n3.7 \n6.0 \n2.5 \n20.0 \n13.2 \n1.4 \n2.4 \n3.2 \n1.2 \n1.6 \n6.8 \n1.5 \n(0.9) \n0.9 \n1.1 \n(0.8) \n \n\n17.8 \n10.8 \n4.9 \n3.9 \n4.3 \n2.9 \n19.1 \n12.8 \n1.4 \n2.0 \n3.8 \n1.3 \n1.6 \n6.4 \n0.8 \n(1.3) \n1.1 \n1.4 \n(0.6) \n \n\nRevenues \n Non-oil domestic tax \n  o/w Income tax \n  o/w VAT \n Oil and gas \n Other \nExpenditures \n Central Government \n  Materials \n  Interest payments \n  Subsidies \n  Social assistance \n  Capital \n Transfer to regions \nPrimary balance \nOverall balance \nNet financing \n Bonds \n Official finance \nAssumption \n Exchange rate (Rp/$) \n Oil price ($/bbl) \n( ) = negative; bbl = barrel; GDP = gross domestic product; o/w = of which; VAT = value \nadded tax. \nSource: Ministry of Finance \n \n\n20.0 \n11.7 \n5.6 \n4.4 \n5.3 \n2.9 \n22.1 \n15.5 \n1.5 \n2.1 \n5.2 \n1.3 \n1.8 \n6.5 \n0.0 \n-2.1 \n2.1 \n2.6 \n-0.3 \n \n9100.0 \n95.0 \n\n20.3 \n11.3 \n5.4 \n4.2 \n6.6 \n3.1 \n21.5 \n15.2 \n1.4 \n2.0 \n5.8 \n1.2 \n1.6 \n6.3 \n0.8 \n-1.2 \n1.3 \n1.9 \n-0.3 \n \n\n9141.0 \n64.0 \n\n9419.0 \n78.0 \n\n101.72 \n\n9435.0 \n\n2009 \n(agreed \nbudget) \n18.5 \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n19.5 \n- \n- \n1.9 \n3.1 \n- \n- \n6.0 \n \n-1.0 \n1.0 \n1.0 \n-0.2 \n \n\n9400.0 \n80.0 \n\n \n8. \nNotwithstanding  moderate  fiscal  deficits,  Indonesia\u2019s  gross  borrowing  needs  during  the \nnext  2  years  remain  high  because  of  high  levels  of  domestic  and  foreign  debt  principal \nrepayments  (Table  2).  Given  that  these  financing  needs  coincide  with  higher  domestic  and \ninternational  borrowing  costs,  program  loans  from  development  partners  provide  a  preferred \ncontribution to  Indonesia\u2019s  overall  financing  needs.  In  2008, ADB  will  provide  the  Government \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nwith $830 million in program loans, while the Government of Japan will provide $500 million and \nthe World Bank a further $1,600 million in budget support (amounting to $900 million in program \nloans and a further $700 million in budget support utilizing country systems). \n \n\nTable 2: The Government\u2019s Gross Financing Needs, 2005\u20132009 \n(Rp trillion) \n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2005 \n\nItem \nGross financing \nOverall deficit \nTotal amortization \n- In rupiah \n- In foreign currency \nNotes: \nGross financing ($ billion) \nRp/$ \nSource: Ministry of Finance. \n\n63.9 \n7.1 \n56.8 \n19.7 \n37.1 \n \n6.6 \n9,751.0 \n\n \n\n105.4 \n29.1 \n76.3 \n23.6 \n52.7 \n \n11.5 \n9,141.0 \n\n \n\n142.2 \n49.8 \n92.4 \n34.4 \n57.9 \n \n15.5 \n9,164.0 \n\n \n\n2008 \n161.6 \n59.2 \n99.6 \n38.6 \n61.0 \n \n17.5 \n9,257.0 \n\n \n\n2009 \n172.6 \n52.7 \n106.5 \n44.8 \n61.6 \n \n18.4 \n9,400.0 \n\n \n\n \n9. \nThe global economic turmoil has had a significant impact on Indonesia. The structure of \nIndonesia\u2019s financial sector and exports would have, however, suggested that the country was \nbetter equipped than some of its neighbors to confront the current downturn. The banking sector \nhad limited direct exposure to developments in the United States financial markets, low reliance \non  external  financing,  and  had  low  levels  of  nonperforming  loans  (3.4%)  and  high  capital \nadequacy  ratios  (17.1%)  in  August  2008.  Indonesia\u2019s  trade  share  at  50%  of  GDP  is  also \nrelatively  small,  while  the  structure  and  destination  of  its  exports  potentially  offered  some \nprotection  to  its  external  sector  from  the  global  slowdown.  Almost  two-thirds  of  Indonesia\u2019s \nexports are commodities, whose prices had remained strong for much of the year. Indonesia\u2019s \nexports have also been increasingly moving toward economies in Asia and away from the US \n(12.3% of total exports in 2007) and European Union (14.5% of total exports in 2007). However, \nexport  growth  has  moderated  in  recent  months  as  commodity  prices  have  weakened  and  the \nglobal economic outlook has deteriorated.  Domestic capital markets have also been subject to \nperiodic bouts of volatility since the beginning of 2008, and capital flight since October 2008. By \nthe end of September 2008, the Indonesian stock exchange had fallen by 33% since the start of \nthe  year,  and  by  7  November  the  stock  exchange  had  fallen  by  a  further  27%  from  end-\nSeptember levels. A lower risk appetite for emerging market debt, higher domestic inflation, and \ntighter  credit  markets  have  adversely  affected  sentiment,  with  spreads  on  Indonesian  5-year \ncredit default swaps increasing from 352.7 on 1 October 2008 to 1,256.7 on 23 October 2008, \nbefore  moderating  to  620.8  on  7  November  2008.  These  developments  have  impacted \nnegatively  on  government  debt  markets,  with  yields  on  government  bonds  having  risen  on \naverage  by  1,021  basis  points  by  end-October,  before  moderating  to  609  basis  points  by  7 \nNovember  2008.  The  rupiah,  which  had  remained  broadly  stable  against  the  US  dollar  during \nthe  first  9  months  of  2008  has,  however,  continued  to  decline  since  end-September  and  has \ndepreciated by 18% as of 7 November 2008. \n \n10. \nGDP  growth  is  expected  to  moderate  to  6.1%  in  2008  and  5.2%  in  2009,  as  export \ngrowth  and  foreign  direct  investment  slows  with  the  global  economic  downturn  (Table  3). \nGrowth  during  this  period  will  be  sustained  by  domestic  consumption  demand.  However,  the \npossibility  of  a  prolonged  and  more  severe  slump  in  the  global  economy  holds  considerable \ndownside  risks  to  Indonesia.  A  sharper  slowdown  in  the  global  economy  and  continued \nturbulence in international financial markets would further affect demand for Indonesian exports \nand limit investment growth as credit markets tighten. Tighter credit markets and increased risk \naversion could also limit the Government\u2019s ability to tap international financial markets. This has \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nalready forced the Government to revise the 2009 budget to target a deficit of 1% of GDP.  The \nGovernment plans to do this by reducing routine line ministry spending by a further 5% to 15%, \nwhile maintaining infrastructure spending and scaling up social-sector spending, in particular for \nits  flagship  community-based  poverty  alleviation  program.    The  Government  is  considering \nvarious alternative budget financing modalities in view of the tightening financial markets.  \n \n11. \nThe Government has also announced a raft of policy measures to counter the effects of \nthe  crisis,  and  boost  liquidity  and  confidence  in  the  financial  system.  These  include  the \nrelaxation  of  reserve  requirements  for  commercial  banks  and  the  use  of  central  bank  and \ngovernment  debt  as  secondary  reserves,  the  lowering  of  reserve  requirements  on  foreign \nexchange  deposits,  the  extension  of  the  tenor  on  foreign  exchange  swaps  from  7  days  to \n1 month, abolishing the limits placed on the daily balance position of short-term foreign loans, \nincreasing the ceiling on deposit insurance from Rp.100 million to Rp.2 billion, and easing rules \nfor  share  buybacks  for  companies  with  share  price  declines.  The  Government  has  also \nimplemented a regulation strengthening the legal basis and interagency coordination in dealing \nwith the financial crisis, including on decisions relating to injecting liquidity and whether to bail \nout troubled banks. In the real sector, the Government has provided various tax incentives for \ninvestment,  and  has  initiated  measures  to  accelerate  state  budget  disbursements  and \nprocurement (both areas supported by this program loan). \n \n\nTable 3: Indonesia Key Macroeconomic Indicators \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nIndicator \n\nReal GDP growth (%) \n\nInflation (%; average of period) \n\nM2 growth (%) \n\nExternal debt (% of GDP) \n\nOverall fiscal balance (% of GDP) \n\nCurrent account balance (% of GDP) \n\nGross official reserves ($ billion) \n\n  in months of imports \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n4.8 \n\n6.8 \n\n9.8 \n\n57.7 \n\n(2.0) \n\n3.5 \n\n36.3 \n\n6.1 \n\n5.0 \n\n6.1 \n\n10.0 \n\n53.5 \n\n(1.4) \n\n0.6 \n\n36.3 \n\n4.8 \n\n2005 \n\n5.7 \n\n10.5 \n\n13.0 \n\n46.6 \n\n(0.3) \n\n0.1 \n\n34.7 \n\n4.4 \n\n5.5 \n\n13.1 \n\n18.1 \n\n35.5 \n\n (0.9) \n\n2.6 \n\n42.6 \n\n4.8 \n\n6.3 \n\n6.4 \n\n19.1 \n\n31.7 \n\n(1.3) \n\n2.5 \n\n56.9 \n\n5.1 \n\n \n\n \n\n6.1 \n\n10.3 \n\n15.8 \n\n28.4 \n\n(1.2) \n\n0.1 \n\n50.0 \n\n5.0  \n\n. \n( ) = negative; GDP = gross domestic product; M2 = Broad Money. \nSources: Bank Indonesia, Central Bureau of Statistics, ADB estimates \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nB. \n\nSocial and Governance Context \n\nTranslating  Growth \n\n12. \ninto  Poverty  Reduction  and  Employment  Generation. \nIndonesia\u2019s poverty rate, measured with reference to the national poverty line, fell from 16.6% in \nMarch  2007  to  15.4%  in  March  2008.  The  decrease  resumed  the  trend  of  gradually  declining \npoverty  rates  since  2000,  which  had  been  interrupted  in  2006  by  a  nearly  2 percentage  point \nincrease caused by a sharp rise in rice prices. Both urban and rural poverty declined over the \ncourse  of  2007;  the  decline  was  spatially  quite  uniform,  with  even  the  poorest  provinces \nregistering decreases in their poverty rates. These levels of poverty, however, translate to about \n35 million poor people, while nearly half the population could be considered among the poor or \nnear-poor  because  their  per  capita  consumption  levels  were  less  than  one-third  above  the \nnational  poverty  line.  These  figures  suggest  that  there  is  a  very  large  group  of  near-poor  in \nIndonesia who are highly vulnerable to shocks at all levels. The poverty profile in Indonesia still \nindicates  considerable  regional  differences  in  poverty\u2014nine  provinces  have  poverty  rates  of \nless than 10% (4.3% in Jakarta) while 10 provinces have poverty rates of more than 20% (37% \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\nin Papua). A challenge for the Government is that, while the poverty incidence is far higher in \neastern  regions,  most  of  Indonesia\u2019s  poor  live  in  the  densely  populated  and  relatively  more \nprosperous western  regions.  Indonesia\u2019s  labor  market  may  also  be  turning  the  corner  and  the \nphenomenon  of  \u201cjobless  growth\u201d  may  be  easing.  The  employment  numbers  from  the  latest \n(February  2008)  national  labor  force  survey  indicate  improvements  in  many  labor  market \noutcomes, continuing what appears now to be an improving trend since 2005. The employment \nrate,  the  share  of  the  labor  force  with  nonfarm  employment,  as  well  as  the  share  with  formal \njobs  have  all  been  rising,  while  the  open  unemployment  rate  has  fallen  to  8.5%  in  February \n2008 from 9.8% a year earlier. \n \n13. \nNon-Income  Millennium  Development  Goals.  Indonesia\u2019s  progress  toward  meeting \nother Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets is somewhat mixed. Malnutrition remains a \nsignificant  public  health  problem,  with  the  percentage  of  children  under  5  years  who  are \nunderweight  rising  from  24.6%  in  2000  to  28.0%  in  2005.  This  has  been  attributed  in  part  to \ndecentralization  in  2000,  since  the  responsibilities  for  the  previous  highly  centralized  family \nnutrition programs were devolved to more than 400 districts. This created difficulties in planning, \nfinancing, and supervising these programs. On the MDG goal relating to education, Indonesia is \nwell on track to achieve the target in primary net enrollment, but it is falling behind in achieving \nnet  enrollment  in  lower  secondary  education.  In  relation  to  the  MDG  on  gender  equality, \nIndonesia is on track to achieve gender equality in education. The gender gaps in terms of net \nenrollment  rates  in  primary  and  lower  secondary  education  have  already  been  closed. \nMeasured  in  terms  of  labor  market  participation  in  the  nonagricultural  sector  and  seats  in \nParliament, however, participation of women continues to lag behind that of men. Indonesia is \nalso on track to achieve the MDG target of reducing the under-5 mortality rate by two-thirds by \n2015, but progress in reducing the maternal mortality ratio has not been sufficient to meet the \nlevels  targeted  in  the  MDGs.  While  the  country  remains  on  track  for  achieving  the  targets  for \nimproved drinking water, it is off track with regard to attaining the target on access to improved \nsanitation facilities. The country is severely off track in achieving the targets of reversing forestry \nloss.  In  most  of  the  MDG-related  indicators,  sharp  regional  and  socioeconomic  differentials \nremain and progress in many instances remains less than has been achieved by the relatively \nmore advanced economies of Southeast Asia.  \n \nin  Governance. \n14. \nSubnational  elections  held  over  the  past  years  have  mostly  been  well  run  and  peaceful,  and \nhave  often  led  to  losses  for  incumbents,  demonstrating  the  electorates\u2019  willingness  to  punish \npoor performance. At the national level, policy debate is often vigorous and political parties are \ndeveloping stronger identities. This political stability and public debate are proving conducive to \ngradually  improving  governance  and  economic  growth  that  is  more  sustainable.  Indonesia\u2019s \ngovernance indicators have improved markedly in recent years but there is still scope for much \nmore  improvement,  and  despite  recent  advances,  corruption  remains  a  significant  obstacle  to \ndoing business. \n \n15. \nSeveral high-profile cases led by the Corruption Eradication Commission anti-corruption \ncommission  (KPK)  are  advancing  the  Government\u2019s  corruption-fighting  credentials.  One \ninvolved the transfer of funds from Bank Indonesia to members of parliamentary committees to \ninfluence the passing of several bills, including one that would have transferred responsibility for \nsupervising the financial sector from Bank Indonesia to a separate agency. In a separate case, \nan  attempt  by  senior  members  of  a  large  conglomerate  to  influence  the  Attorney  General\u2019s \noffice  has  seen  KPK  arrest  the  businesspeople,  and  many  attorney  generals  and  state \nprosecutors have been reassigned or dismissed. Various customs offices have been raided and \ncustoms  officials  arrested  for  suspect  payments.  In  addition,  regional  government  officials  are \n\ninto  Equity  and  Efficiency\u2014Progress \n\nTranslating  Growth \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nbeing prosecuted for corruption, such as one case of a protected mangrove area being rezoned \nfor a port development. \n \n16. \nIn  addition  to  pursuing  past  cases,  the  Government  is  also  gradually  introducing \nmeasures to prevent corruption. Senior public servants in the Ministry of Finance (MOF) may no \nlonger  also  hold  senior  positions  in  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs).  Throughout  the  public \nservice, pay levels are being brought closer to the skill and responsibility of the position, and the \nprivate  sector  equivalents.  Vacancies  are  being  filled  through  internal  advertisements  rather \nthan automatic promotion. \n \n17. \nIndonesia\u2019s  democratic  governance  made  major  advances  in  2004  with  its  first  direct \npresidential  election,  and  all  indicators  suggest  that  the  national  elections  in  2009  will  repeat \nthose  achievements.  Nevertheless,  the  2009  elections  increase  the  uncertainties  surrounding \nthe  conduct  of  policy  over  the  next  year,  and  its  longer-term  direction.  On  the  one  hand,  the \nelection process could place on hold certain reforms with longer-term returns, or with high short-\nterm  costs  to  vocal  sectional  interests,  such  as  reducing  Indonesia\u2019s  very  large  energy \nsubsidies. On the other, more legislative measures may be passed as the preelection pressure \nmounts for the Government to demonstrate its achievements. \n \n\nIII. \n\nGOVERNMENT STRATEGY, PROGRAM STRUCTURE, AND RESULTS \n\nA. \n\nThe Development Policy Support Program and Government Strategy \n\n18. \nThe  DPSP  supports  the  development  policy  agenda  of  the  Development  Policy  Loan \n(DPL)  series  prepared  by  a  joint  team  of  the  Government  of  Indonesia,  ADB,  Government  of \nJapan, and the World Bank.3 The DPL series aims to help the Government achieve its medium-\nterm  growth  and  poverty  reduction  objectives  through  three  core  policy  areas:  (i) improved \ninvestment  climate,  (ii)  improved  public  financial  management  and  governance,  and  (iii) \nimproved delivery of public services to the poor. Building on the support provided by the DPSP-\n3 (approved in December 2007), the proposed DPSP-4 will provide parallel cofinancing support \nto the Government to help implement reforms under the fifth Development Policy Loan (DPL-5), \nwhich is the fifth in a series of five annual, single-tranche loans. \n \n19. \nThe  Government\u2019s  national  medium-term  development  plan  (RPJM)  aims  to  achieve \npeace and security, justice and democracy, while advancing the welfare of the people within the \ntime  frame  of  2004\u20132009.  The  RPJM  includes  the  eight  MDGs  that  provide  an  overarching \nframework, placing human development and poverty reduction at the center of the development \nagenda. The RPJM has set a number of social targets, some of which are more ambitious than \nthe MDGs. For example, it aims to halve the 2004 national poverty rate from 16.6% to 8.2% by \n2009.  The  Government\u2019s  work  plan  (RKP),  approved  each  year  by  the  cabinet,  guides  RPJM \nimplementation. The RKPs set out annual development priorities, including quantitative targets \nand policy directions, which in turn provide a guide to aggregate budgetary allocations.4  \n \n                                                 \n \n3  As ADB did not participate in DPL-1, a different title\u2014DPSP\u2014has been adopted for ADB\u2019s operations. Thus, the \nequivalence  is  as  follows:  DPL-1  =  ADB\u2019s  participation  through  policy  dialogue;  DPL-2  =  DPSP-1;  DPL-3  = \nDPSP-2; DPL-4 = DPSP-3; and DPL-5 = DPSP-4. The proposed Program is in line with ADB\u2019s CSP 2006\u20132009 for \nIndonesia, which supports continued cofinancing of the DPLs. \n\n4  In an apparent recognition of the difficulty of attaining  the poverty target, the 2009 RKP sets a target of reducing \n\nthe poverty rate to 12%\u201314% in 2009 from 15.4% in March 2008. \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nThe  RKP  for  2008  indicates  that  the  overall  development  theme  for  next  year  is \n20. \n\u201cAccelerated Economic Growth for Job Creation and Poverty Reduction\u201d. To address this overall \ntheme,  the  RKP  for  2008  has  the  following  eight  priority  areas:  (i)  increasing  investment, \nexports,  and  job  opportunities;  (ii)  revitalizing  agriculture,  fisheries,  forestry,  and  rural \ndevelopment;  (iii)  accelerating  development  of  infrastructure  and  improvement  of  energy \nmanagement; (iv) improving access and quality of education and health services; (v) improving \nthe  effectiveness  of  poverty  reduction  measures;  (vi)  corruption  eradication  and  accelerated \nbureaucratic  reform;  (vii)  strengthening  defense  capabilities  and  improving  domestic  security; \nand (viii) disaster response, disaster risk reduction, and improvement of avian influenza control. \nOf  these,  the  first,  fourth,  fifth,  and  sixth  priority  areas  relate  to  the  core  policy  areas  of  the \nDPSP-4. ADB\u2019s Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program addresses the priority area \nrelated to infrastructure5. \n \n21. \nTo help implement the RKP priorities, economic policy packages have been introduced \nin  each  of  the  last  3  years,  from  which  specific  measures are  derived  to  be  achieved  within  a \ndefined  period.  In  2006,  the  Government  issued  three  economic  policy  packages  covering \ninvestment climate, infrastructure, and financial sector reform. In 2007, a comprehensive follow-\nup  package  was  issued  detailing  measures  to  accelerate  development,  and  empower  micro, \nsmall, and medium-sized enterprises. The latest package, introduced in May 2008, builds on the \nprevious  packages  and  details  reforms  in  the  following  eight  areas:  (i)  investment  climate; \n(ii) financial  sector;  (iii)  energy  security;  (iv)  natural  resources,  environment,  and  agriculture; \n(v) small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SME);  (vi)  implementation  of  the  Association  of \nSoutheast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  commitments;  (vii)  infrastructure;  and  (viii) labor  policy. \nThrough these policy packages, the Government has demonstrated a clear willingness to deal \nwith  a  number  of  complex,  and  in  some  cases  politically  sensitive,  issues  that  have  been  on \nhold for some time. Each policy package has time-bound actions and stipulates a minister to be \nresponsible  for  each  item.  The  packages  also  represent  a  foundation  for  future  DPL/DPSPs, \nwhich are envisioned to deepen the policy dialogue in select areas. The triggers for the DPSP-4 \ninclude several actions identified in the policy packages. \n \n22. \nThe DPSP Series, Other ADB Sector Programs, and Donor Harmonization. Support \nfor  the  RPJM  through  parallel  cofinancing  of  the  DPL  series  is  a  key  pillar  of  ADB\u2019s  CSP  for \n2006\u20132009  (footnote  1).  Under  the  CSP,  a  dual-track  approach  is  adopted  to  ensure  that  the \nhigh-level macroeconomic and governance reforms supported through the policy dialogue of the \nDPL series complement, and are reinforced by, ADB\u2019s sector programs. Underpinning the policy \ndialogue  has  been  a  series  of  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  provided  by  the  World  Bank \nand ADB that the Government has drawn upon. Figure 1 presents the approach, which involves \nstructuring ADB\u2019s support through (i) participation in the DPLs to strengthen the macroeconomic \nand  fiscal  framework  while  addressing  crosscutting  concerns;  and  (ii)  sector-specific  policy \ninterventions in the areas of infrastructure, financial deepening, local government finance, and \npoverty reduction and accelerated progress toward the MDGs. ADB\u2019s dual-track approach aims \nto  harmonize  and  align  development  partner  strategies  with  Indonesia\u2019s  country  strategy  and \npriorities. The participation of ADB and the Government of Japan in the World Bank-coordinated \nDPL  series,  and  the  participation  of  the  Government  of  Japan  and  the  World  Bank  in  ADB\u2019s \nInfrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program,  have  helped  reduce  the  Government\u2019s \ntransaction  costs  of  policy  dialogue  with  three  of  the  country\u2019s  most  important  development \npartners.  Moreover,  development  partner  harmonization  around  the  Government\u2019s  own \n                                                 \n \n5 ADB.  2008.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nRepublic of Indonesia for the Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program (Subprogram 2). Manila \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nprograms has bolstered country ownership of the reform process and helped change the nature \nof  the  relationship  with  the  three  development  partners  to  one  of  reliable  collaboration.  ADB\u2019s \nactive  participation  in  the  policy  discussions  in  all  areas  of  the  DPL  and  the  parallel  policy \ndialogue  on  sector  reforms  have  been  particularly  appreciated  by  the  Government,  as  these \nhave helped in setting the overall macroeconomic framework for sector-level reforms supported \nby  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  engagement  in  these  policy  discussions  and  its  strength  in  the  areas  of \ninfrastructure,  financial  sector,  decentralization,  and  support  for  achieving  MDGs  have  helped \navoid duplication of effort and improved the monitoring as well as the quality of the triggers. \n\nB. \n\nThe Evolution of the Program \n\n23. \nAt its inception in 2004, the DPL series was designed to support Indonesia\u2019s transition \nfrom postcrisis stabilization to more long-term development. The DPL was expected to provide \nthe foundation for continued, medium-term policy engagement in the areas of macroeconomic \nstability,  the  investment  climate,  and  public  financial  management  and  anticorruption.  It  also \nprovided for a flexible means of taking into account the pace and fluidity of the reform process. \nHence, as the program has evolved, the scope of the reform agenda has become broader. The \nbroadening  of  the  agenda  has  also  been  accompanied  by  a  deepening  of  reforms,  whereby \nsuccessive DPL operations have built on previous ones to ensure incremental implementation. \nThe  theme  of  the  DPL-1  was  on  restoring  and  maintaining  macroeconomic  stability  and \nconsolidating macroeconomic achievements at a time when Indonesia was leaving its postcrisis \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  program.  Within  this  context,  the  main  focus  was  on \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  creditworthiness, \nfinancial \nmanagement  and  governance.  The  theme  of  the  DPL-2/DPSP-1  progressed  toward  creating \nfiscal  space.  This  led  to  themes  more  focused  on  implementation.  The  emphasis  of  the  DPL-\n3/DPSP-2 was on utilizing the fiscal space that had been created in the DPL-2 to have a greater \nimpact on service delivery, while the theme of the DPL-4/DPSP-3 carried this further forward by \ndeepening  the  process  of  institutional  reform  Reflecting  the  flexibility  of  the  program  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  success in  achieving macroeconomic  stability  and  attaining  the  macroeconomic \ntriggers of the DPL program ahead of time, the Government and development partners agreed \nin  early  2006  to  remove  the  macroeconomic  pillar  in  the  proposed  DPL-4/DPSP-3,  but  to \ncontinue the policy dialogue on macroeconomic stability. At the same time, the increased fiscal \nspace  generated  by  the  reduction  in  fuel  subsidies,  declining  debt  service  payments,  and \nincreasing revenues had opened up opportunities for a greater focus on public service delivery \nas a new policy area (Appendix 2 provides the evolution of DPL/DPSP triggers). \n\ninvestment  climate,  and  public \n\nC. \n\nResults Achieved \n\n24. \nPolicy  actions  under  the  macroeconomic  pillar  relating  to  debt  and  fiscal  policy \nmanagement  contributed  considerably  to  lower  levels  of  debt  to  GDP  and  a  considerable \nincrease  in  non-oil  tax  revenues 6.  Rating  agencies  have  also  cited  debt  reduction  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  reforms,  including  changes  to  the  investment  law,  customs  and \ntax  reforms,  and  fiscal  reforms\u2014all  activities  supported  by  the  DPL/DPSP\u2014as  the  reason  for \nrecent sovereign rating upgrades. Policy actions supported under the investment climate have \nled to significant improvements in business start-up times, value-added tax (VAT) refund times, \nand have led to the establishment of a sounder and sustainable financial safety net. DPL/DPSP \n                                                 \n \n6   This  section,  and  the  subsequent  section  on  Lessons,  is  based  on  the  findings  of  a  program  completion  report \nundertaken for the DPSP-1 in 2008, and discussions that ADB held with the World Bank and the Government for \nthe preparation of a separate program completion report for the DPSP-2, and the DPSP-3 in 2009 (Appendix 3). \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\npolicy  measures  have  also  supported  revisions  to  the  Tax  Law,  the  implementing  decree \nrelating to tax audit procedures, implementation decrees supporting the investment law, and the \nrollout  of  a  national  single  window  (NSW)  with  online  clearance  of  merchandise.  A  key \nachievement under the public financial management pillar has been the implementation of the \ntreasury single account (TSA) to improve cash management of public finances. The DPL/DPSP \nprogram has helped move forward reforms to reengineer business processes across the budget \ncycle.  The  national  budget  is  now  compatible  with  the  international  standard  government \nfinance  statistics  (GFS)  classification.  Fiscal  reporting  is  more  comprehensive  and  timely,  and \nelements of a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) have been introduced, though not \nfully  operational  in  the  budget  system.  Initial  steps  to  address  civil  service  reform  have  been \nlaunched  under  the  DPL/DPSP  series.  As  an  initial  measure,  the  DPL/DPSP  supported  the \ndevelopment of a comprehensive reform of the structure and remuneration framework for high-\nranking state officials. A task force was set up to examine the entire compensation package with \nthe  goal  of  creating  a  more  transparent,  systematic,  and  coherent  framework  for  pay  and \nallowances based on a comprehensive job evaluation and pay grading. Building on this, MOF \nhas  developed  a  comprehensive  civil  service  reform  action  plan,  which  is  being  pilot  tested  in \nother agencies. Important steps were also established under the DPL/DPSP series to help lay \nthe  groundwork  for  improving  poverty  targeting  of  basis  services.  As  the  2005  fuel  price  hike \nmade  available  more  funds  for  social  spending,  the  DPL/DPSP  supported  building  capacity  in \ngovernment institutions to create a more evaluative institutional framework that would improve \nthe  targeting  of  these  released  funds.  Lessons  from  targeting  were  incorporated  into  the  new \ncash transfer program that accompanied the May 2008 fuel price increase. The DPSP/DPL has \nalso supported critical actions to improve the quality of public service delivery in education and \ncommunity-based development. \n\nD. \n\nLessons \n\n25. \nDonor  coordination.  The  DPL/DPSP  facility  provided  a  useful  platform  for  donor \ncoordination  of  policies  and  programs.  The  Government  welcomed  the  development  of  a \nconsistent  approach  to critical  reform  issues  among  key  donors.  Sharing  of  technical  advisory \nsupport,  information,  and  data  that  had  implications  for  cooperation  in  other  operational  areas \ntook  place  among  donors  (notably  in  programs  to  support  infrastructure  development,  where \nADB took the lead role). \n \n26. \nCoordination within Government. The negotiations to develop the DPL/DPSP and the \nneed  to  develop  joint  positions  on  policy  issues  necessitated  regular  and  continuous \ninteragency  consultation  and  coordination  that  may  have  indirectly  led  to  systemic  changes  in \nthe  policy  coordination  process  within  key  agencies  of  the  Government.  This  was  noted  by \nstakeholders during the current review process. \n \nThe Role of Policy Triggers. Although these represented actions that the Government \n27. \nfully  intended  to  undertake  independently,  the  choice  of  outcomes/triggers  was  important  in \nguiding both the direction and pace of the reform process within the Government. The inclusion \nof  a  trigger/outcome  in  the  DPL/DPSP  was  welcomed  by  those  pushing  for  particular  reforms \nwithin the Government,  as this would increase the political profile of the reform and this could \nhelp  ensure  the  maintenance  of  the  momentum  needed  to  achieve  the  reform.  At  the  same \ntime,  the  process  of  identifying  triggers  was  sometimes  used  by  reformers  to  unrealistically \noverpromise to push through as much of the reforms as possible without regard to meeting the \ndeadline of the prior actions.  \n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nThe Importance of Continuity in the Reform Process, Building on Earlier Changes. \n28. \nSome  reforms\u2014such  as  the  TSA\u2014led  to  solid  progress  on  a  reform  objective,  and  the \nDPL/DPSP played a clear role in their achievement. These reforms are also more sustainable, \nas the reforms progressed and were deepened, and the parties involved remained engaged in \nthe reform process. \n \n29. \nThe Design and Specification of Specific Triggers. The wording of each policy action \nrequired  under  the  program  was  developed  on  the  basis  of  mutual  trust  and  understanding \nbetween the Government and the three development partners, with a clear understanding of the \ndirection  of  reforms,  without  excessive  specificity  that  would  create  political  difficulties  or \ncompromise  the  flexibility  of  the  Government  in  overcoming  obstacles  to  reform.  This  was \nespecially important in areas where the executing agency (MOF) or the agencies working most \nclosely  with  it  Coordinating  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs  (CMEA)  and  Bappenas  National \nDevelopment Planning Agency) had no direct control over implementation of a particular reform, \nas other agencies or Parliament were involved. \n \nStrengthening  Change  Management  Capacity  in  the  Government  and  Identifying \n30. \nKey Change Management Points. The success of the DPL/DPSP programs has hinged on the \nproactive  role  taken  by  key  counterparts  willing  to  take  up  difficult  change  management \nfunctions. This has involved a strong communications strategy with all concerned stakeholders, \nmaking  assessments  of  potential  gains  and  losses  to  key  stakeholders,  having  realistic \nassessments of the time frames required to implement specific actions, and identifying potential \nrisks  and  obstacles  as  well  as  remedial  and  palliative  actions.  It  was  widely  recognized  that \nsupporting  the  agencies  leading  the  reform  process  (through  advisory  services  or  technical \nsupport) would yield disproportionately large benefits in terms of the facilitation of future reforms \nand the formulation and design of the Government\u2019s forward-looking reform agenda. DPL/DPSP \nreforms  have  tended  to  be  most  successful  in  areas  where  they  were  complemented  by  a \nstrong TA program. \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\nFigure 1: Support for the Government\u2019s Medium-Term National Development Plan \n\nStrategic Framework: Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJM)\nOutcomes:  \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nRevive economic growth to achieve 7% average annual real GDP growth by 2009.  \nHalve poverty from 16.6% in 2004 to 8.2% by 2009. \nReduce unemployment by 2009 from the current levels above 10%. \nPromote good governance through combating corruption. \nEnsure peace, safety, security, justice, and democracy for all Indonesians. \n\nDPL Series (Coordinated by \nthe World Bank) \n\n \n(cid:190)  High-level macroeconomic \nand cross-sector reforms \n(cid:190)  Small number of strategic \ntriggers per core policy \narea \n\n(cid:190) Annual program lending\n\nClose seamless \ncoordination \nmoving from \nmacro-\neconomic to \nsector reforms, \nreinforced by \ncofinancing \nwhere possible \n\nSector Programs under the New \nCSP (Coordinated by ADB) \n\n \n(cid:190)  Deeper sector-specific \n\nimplementation support for policy, \ninstitutional, regulatory reforms  \n\n(cid:190)  Each program designed as a \ncluster, with subprograms \nsequenced over 18\u201324 months\n\nCore Policy Area 1: \nMacroeconomic Stability and \nCreditworthiness \n\n\u2022  Monitoring progress \n\n \n\n \n\nInfrastructure Reform Sector Development Program Cluster\n\n\u2022  Comprehensive sector and cross-sector reforms as \noutlined in the Program Cluster over 2005\u20132010 \n\n\u2022  Establishment of Project Development Facility \n\u2022  Supporting infrastructure project transactions \n\nCore Policy Area 2: Improving \nInvestment Climate \n\n\u2022  Regulatory reforms \n\u2022  Tax and customs reforms \n\u2022  Strengthening financial \n\nsector and SME access to \nfinance \n\nCore Policy Area 3: Improving \nPublic Financial Management \n\u2022  Strengthening budgeting, \n\ncontrols, and transparency, \nand procurement \n Civil Service Reform \n\n\u2022 \n\nCore Policy Area 4: Improved \nDelivery of Public Services \n\u2022  Pro-poor  targeting  of  public \n\nprograms \n\n\u2022  Strengthening public service \ndelivery and community \ndriven development \n\nCapital Market Development Program Cluster\n\n\u2022  Enhanced information disclosure and improved price \n\ndiscovery \n\n\u2022  Deeper and more liquid financial markets \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\nImproved market surveillance and investor protection \nImproved governance and human resource capacity in \nmarket institutions\n\nLocal Government Finance and Governance Reform \nProgram Cluster and the State Audit Reform Program \n\u2022  Ex  ante  planning  and  budget  reforms  through  Program \n\nCluster \n\n\u2022  Streamlining fiscal decentralization \n\u2022  Local government level civil service reforms \n\u2022 \n\nImproving public financial management (ex ante aspects \nthrough Program Cluster and internal control and audits \nthrough State Audit Reform Program) \n\nPoverty Reduction and MDG Acceleration Program Cluster\n\u2022 \n\nImproving delivery of health, education, and other \ncommunity services in MDG-deficit areas, in a \nprogrammatic manner \n\n\u2022  Enhancing accountability for service delivery at local \n\ngovernment and institutional levels, reinforced by well-\ndefined standards that are based on clear costing  \n\u2022  Facilitating transition toward greater performance-\n\norientation \n\nRPJM = Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah (medium-term development plan); DPL = development policy \nloan; CSP = country strategy and program; MDG = Millennium Development Goal.  \nSource: ADB. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n31. \nThe impact of the DPSP-4 will be in the form of higher economic growth that is sustained \nover the medium term and accompanied by lower levels of unemployment and poverty. Its main \noutcome  is  improved  overall  economic  management  anchored  on  good  governance  through \n(i) an improved investment climate, (ii) improved public financial management, and (iii) improved \ndelivery of public services. \n \n32. \nThe  design  and  monitoring  framework  for  the  DPSP-4  is  in  Appendix  1.  The  letter  of \ndevelopment  policy  for  DPSP-4  is  in  Appendix  4,  and  the  policy  matrix  is  in  Appendix  5. \nAppendix 6 presents the development partners coordination matrix, outlining support from ADB \nand other development partners in areas related to the DPSP series, while Appendix 9 presents \nthe summary poverty reduction and social strategy. \n\nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n33. \nThe  DPSP-4  is  in  substantive  terms  a  continuation  of  DPSPs  1\u20133,  the  programmatic \nseries  of  annual  single-tranche  operations  from  2005  to  2007. 7  The  proposed  Program \ncontinues the policy dialogue on, and support to, Indonesia\u2019s reform program in the three core \nareas  that  were  the  focus  of  the  DPSP-3:  (i)  the  investment  climate,  (ii)  public  financial \nmanagement  and  governance,  and  (iii)  improved  delivery  of  public  services  to  the  poor. \nImprovements  in  the  investment  climate  are  critical  to  accelerating  growth;  public  financial \nmanagement and civil service reforms are essential for enhancing government effectiveness in \na  decentralized  and  democratic  Indonesia.  In  addition,  improving  service  delivery  and  poverty \nalleviation efforts is essential if Indonesia is to bring about more broad-based improvements in \nwelfare for all its population.  \n \n34. \nAll  the  triggers  in  these  three  areas  were  chosen  as  part  of  the  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment  during  preparation  of  the  DPSP-3,  and  represent  a  natural  next  step  from  those \nthat were achieved in that program. The policy and reform focus of these triggers have further \nevolved  and  moved  progressively \nincreased \ntransparency, and deepened institutions prerequisites to sustain medium-term growth and social \ndevelopment.  The  DPSP-3  program  document  laid  out  17  indicative  triggers  (prior  actions) \nacross  nine  policy  areas  for  the  DPSP-4.  Satisfactory  progress  has  been  made  on  all  the \ntriggers, with two having exceeded requirements (Table 4).8  \n                                                 \n \n7   As  originally  envisaged  in  the  Indonesia  CSP,  there  was  to  be  no  DPSP  loan  in  2008,  with  the  last  loan  in  the \nseries  (DPSP-4)  programmed  for  2009.  However,  based  on  a  government  request  for  ADB  to  participate  in  the \nDPL process in 2008, the proposed loan in 2009 was advanced to 2008, and a new loan for 2009 (DPSP-5) has \nbeen  programmed  in  the  Indonesia  country  operations  business  plan  (ADB.  2008.  Country  Operations  Business \nPaln (2009\u20142011): Indonesia. Manila), to coincide with the ending of the Government\u2019s medium-term development \nplan 2004\u20142009.   \n\nimproved  regulations, \n\nforward \n\ninclude \n\n8  In  keeping  with  the  DPL  modality,  which  has  been  characterized  by  medium-term  engagement,  strong  country \nownership, and continuous policy dialogue with the Government, triggers are used in a more process-oriented and \nflexible  sense  with  less  of  a  focus  on  compliance  with  conditions.  International  experience  with  policy-based \nlending  and  recent  literature  on  the  subject  suggests  that  a  focus  on  traditional  conditionality  could  undermine \ncountry  ownership  and  the  sustainability  of  the  reform  process  (World  Bank.  2005.  Conditionality  Revisited. \nWashington,  DC;  ADB.  2007.  Special  Evaluation  Study  on  Policy-Based  Lending:  Emerging  Practices  in \nSupporting Reforms in Developing Member Countries.

As a share of GDP, investment reached \n25%, a major improvement from 19% immediately after the Asian financial crisis, but still not a \nfull recovery to pre-crisis levels of nearly 30% of GDP, and considerably below the investment \nrates  of  countries  such  as  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (45%)  and  Viet  Nam  (32%). \nInvestment  growth  continued  to  accelerate  during  the  first  semester  of  2008,  reaching  14.1%, \nand contributing 41% to GDP growth.  \n \nSome  of  the  impetus  for  recent  strong  investment  trends  may  be  coming  from  higher \n36. \nforeign direct investment. The Investment Board reports that realized foreign investment nearly \ndoubled from $5.9 billion in 2006 to $10.4 billion in 2007, and increased by nearly 2.5 times to \n$10.4 billion during January\u2013June 2008 (from $4.1 billion during the same period in 2007).  \n \n37. \nto \nimprovements in macroeconomic stability and economic policy, may explain part of the recent \n\ninvestment  climate,  especially \n\nBusiness  perceptions  of \n\nrelating \n\nthose \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\nrecovery of  investment.  The annual survey of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation of \n600  Japanese  multinational  companies  also  showed  an  improvement  in  Indonesia\u2019s  global \nranking  in  2007,  following  4 straight  years  of  decline,  with  Japanese  multinationals  rating \nIndonesia as the eighth most promising country for overseas investment.  \n \n38. \nPart  of  this  improvement  in  perceptions  may  be  due  to  the  economic  reform  programs \nintroduced by the Government over the past 3 years (Appendix 3). Major achievements under \nthese packages include the Investment Law, 2007; the Tax Administration Law, 2007; and the \n2008  law  on  electronic  transactions  that  provides  a  legal  basis  for  e-Government.  The \ninvestment  law  stipulates  equal  treatment  for  foreign  and  domestic  investors  and  reinforces \ninvestor protections. \n \n39.  Major reforms in tax administration and customs administration are under way, including \na  new  VAT  refund  system  that  promises  refunds  in  7  days  for  \u201cgolden\u201d  taxpayers,  within \n2 months  for  low-risk  exporters,  and  within  4  months  for  medium-risk  exporters.  Standard \noperating procedures for a complaints management system have also been issued, including a \ncode  of  ethics  for  tax  officials.  Implementation  of  a  single  window  for  export  and  import \ndocumentation  was  launched  on  a  pilot  basis  for  selected  large  importers  in  Indonesia\u2019s  main \nseaport  in  December  2007  and  is  currently  being  expanded  to  additional  importers  and  ports. \nFull  implementation  will  eventually  allow  electronic  submission  and  approval  of  a  single \ncombined  customs  form  covering  all  required  clearances,  and  a  consequent  reduction  in \nclearance  times.  Reforms  to  the  procedures  for  establishing  a  limited  liability  company  were \nissued in September 2007, reducing business start-up times from 105 days in 2007 to 76 days \nin 2008. \n \n40. \nNotwithstanding  these  reforms,  recent  gains  have  taken  place  from  a  low  base  and \nbusinesses  in  Indonesia  still  face  an  overall  poor  business  climate.  Indonesia\u2019s  investment \nclimate continues to rank poorly in international comparisons. The World Bank\u2019s Doing Business \n2009 report ranks Indonesia 129 out of 181 countries on the ease of doing business, a drop of \ntwo  places  since  the  2008  report,  and  well  behind  its  regional  competitors  such  as  Thailand \n(13),  Malaysia  (20),  PRC  (83),  and  Viet  Nam  (92). 9  Other  indicators  such  as  the  World \nEconomic Forum\u2019s Global Competitiveness Index also show little improvement, with Indonesia\u2019s \nranking  remaining  virtually  unchanged  from  2007  to  2008  (54  out  of  131  countries  in  2008, \ncompared to 51 out of 122 countries in 2007)10. Indonesia\u2019s poor performance in these indices \nreflects the fact that other countries have been making a greater effort to improve their business \nclimate  relative  to  Indonesia.  Business  in  Indonesia  continues  to  face  a  difficult  legal  and \nregulatory  environment,  while  implementation  of  policies  remains  poor  because  of  inefficient \ncoordination and capacity constraints in government agencies. Strict labor regulations continue \nto create a disincentive to employment expansion, while lack of access to long-term finance and \ninfrastructure weaknesses raises the cost and uncertainty of doing business. The Government \nis  attempting  to  address  this  issue  by  forging  partnerships  with  the  private  sector.  To  support \ngovernment efforts in this area, ADB is providing TA to strengthen institutions promoting public\u2013\nprivate partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure provision, and it is providing a loan to fund a project \ndevelopment facility that will assist in preparing PPP projects for tendering to the private sector \non  a  transparent  and  competitive  basis. 11  ADB  is  also  providing  assistance  for  long-term \n                                                 \n \n9  World Bank. 2008.

The new list \nwas issued in December 2007 and clarifies that companies existing prior to the issuance of the \nnegative  list  were  grandfathered  with  respect  to  new  restrictions.  A  few  sectors,  such  as \nbusiness  and  management  consulting  services,  were  also  opened  to  greater  levels  of  foreign \ninvestment. The development of technical guidelines for investment procedures and undertaking \na  mapping  of  business  licenses  to  support  license  simplification  is  behind  schedule,  partly \nbecause of a delay in obtaining the requisite finances for these activities. Funds have now been \nearmarked and a tender has been issued for a study of sectoral investment regulations that will \nsupport mapping of business licenses.  \n \n\nb. \n\nTrigger 2: Increase the ability to monitor the investment climate by: (i) posting \npublicly, average processing time for VAT refunds; (ii) making available data on the \ntime taken to establish a company from reserving the name to issuing the \nlegalization decree; and (iii) designing a system to monitor and report on import \nclearance time from unloading to gate-out combining data from the Port Operator \nand Customs. (current status: achieved) \n\n \n42. \nDirectorate General of Taxes (DG Tax) has already published on its website the average \nprocessing  time  for  a  number  of  taxpayer  services,  including  VAT  refunds  (broken  down  by \ntaxpayer risk categories: low, medium, and high). Pursuant to Director General Taxes Circular \nLetter 19/PJ/2008, this data will be updated quarterly as part of the tax office key performance \nindicators. The Ministry of Justice has made available data from its SISMINBAKUM database on \nthe  time  taken  to  establish  a  company  from  reserving  the  name  to  issuing  the  legalization \ndecree.  Standard  templates  for  reporting  and  publishing  summary  statistics  are  being \ndeveloped. The Customs Department has designed a new data system known as TPS Online \nthat will combine customs data with data from terminal operators, thereby allowing more careful \nmonitoring of import clearance time. TPS Online is scheduled to go live in December 2008. \n \n\nc. \n\nTrigger 3: Continue to implement the national single window (NSW), including \nincreasing the number of participating agencies and companies.  Extend the original \npilot (current status: achieved) \n\n \nConsiderable  progress  has  been  made  in  developing  the  NSW.  A  national  team  to \n43. \nestablish the single window, chaired by the minister of finance and led at the working level by a \ndeputy under the coordinating minister for the economy, has been created. A pilot project was \n                                                                                                                                                          \n \n\nBoard  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector \nDevelopment Program. Manila (Loan 2264-INO[SF], approved November, $26.5 million equivalent). \n\n \n\n\f 18 \n\nlaunched  at  Jakarta's  Tanjung  Priok  seaport  in  December  2007,  involving  100  priority  lane \ncompanies and customs, the port authority, Ministry of Trade, the Food and Drug Agency, and \nquarantine. In August 2008, this was expanded to an additional 10 government agencies, and \nas of early September 2008, 143 companies were reported to be using the NSW. The pilot has \nbeen  extended  to  the  three  additional  seaports  as  well  as  the  Jakarta  airport.    The \nGovernment\u2019s  2008  Economic  Policy  Package  (Presidential  Instruction  No.  5/2008)  targets  a \ndecision  to be  made  on  the  operational  model  for  the  NSW  by  December  2008,  which  will  be \ncritical for the next stage of implementation. \n \n44. \nThe NSW for imports and exports is the most important trade facilitation initiative under \nway  in  Indonesia.  Under  a  single  window,  traders  (importers  and  exporters)  will  no  longer  be \nrequired  to  apply  individually  to  multiple  government  agencies\u2014such  as  customs,  the  port \nauthority,  Ministry  of  Trade,  the  Food  and  Drug  Agency,  and  quarantine\u2014to  clear  cargoes.  A \nsingle  application  is  instead  submitted  using  a  single  administrative  document  and  this \napplication  is  transmitted  to  each  relevant  agency  by  the  operator  of  the  single  window. \nApproval is transmitted back to the operator so that the trader communicates directly with one \nauthority  rather  than  multiple  authorities.  The  Indonesian  NSW  is  being  established  in  the \nframework  of several ASEAN agreements as an initial step toward an eventual ASEAN single \nwindow for international trade. \n \n\nd. \n\nTrigger 4: Issue implementing regulations for the Tax Administration Law and \nmonitoring instructions to tax offices.  Establish a system to monitor and report on \nresponse time for tax audit objections and appeals. (current status: exceeded) \n\n \nAs of September 2008, all implementation regulations for the tax administration law have \n45. \nbeen  issued  and  posted  on  the  DG  Tax  website,  and  socialized  to  tax  offices  across  the \ncountry.    The  Tax  Administration  Law,  2007,  strikes  a  better  balance  between  the  rights  and \nobligations of taxpayers and the powers of tax officials\u2014an issue of longstanding concern to the \nbusiness  community.  To  take  effect,  the  law  needed  to  be  supported  by  implementing \nregulations  issued  by  DG  Tax  and  socialized  to  tax  offices  across  the  country.  These  new \nregulations clarify and provide certainty in the administrative procedures for taxpayers to comply \nwith the law, as well as for the tax officials to provide services to taxpayers. \n \n46. \nIn August 2008, DG Tax published on its website the average processing time for each \nof  the  eight  major  taxpayer  services,  including  tax  objections,  taxpayer  registration,  VAT \nrefunds,  exemption  of  withholding  tax  on  imports,  and  property  relief  tax.  This  data  on  the \naverage  response  times  of  these  major  taxpayer  services  will  be  updated  and  monitored  by \nDG Tax  every  quarter.  This  follows  the  issuance  of  Director  General  of  Taxes  Circular  Letter \n19/PJ/2008  requiring  all  tax  offices  to  report  on  a  quarterly  basis  the  average  time  to  process \nthese  taxpayer  services  as  part  of  its  effort  to  improve  taxpayer  services  and  monitor  the \nperformance of tax offices.  \n \n\ne. \n\nTrigger 5: Continue the tariff harmonization program and implement effective and \ntransparent operating procedures, including public disclosure (current status: \nachieved) \n\n \n47. \nIndonesia  has  been  implementing  a  major  tariff  harmonization  program  since  2005  to \nsimplify the structure of import tariffs and reduce the number of tariff brackets. The program is \nscheduled  to  end  in  2010.  Tim  Tarif,  the  agency  reviewing  proposals  for  tariff  change,  is  on \ntrack  for  its  tariff  harmonization  target  for  2008  as  shown  by  the  MOF  Regulation  (PMK) \nNo. 70/PMK.011/2008.  As  a  result  of  the  latest  tariff  harmonization,  in  2008  around  86%  of \n\n\f \n\n19\n\napplied tariff lines will be 0%\u201310% with only 2% of tariffs higher than 35%. In 2008, the simple \naverage tariff will be down to 7.7%, compared to 9.9% in 2004. \n \n48. \nThe  Government  is  showing  commitment  to  improving  procedures  and  transparency  in \nreviewing  tariff  proposals  by  Tim  Tarif  by  introducing  a  ministerial  decree  that  dictates  the \nmaximum  time  allowed  for  reviewing  tariff  proposals,  and  governs  general  rules  for  plenary \nmeetings  in  Tim  Tarif  (appendix  in  MOF  decree  to  renew  the  mandate  for  Tim Tarif,  KMK \nNo. 285/KMK.011/2007).  With  respect  to  disclosure,  Tim  Tarif  has  been  disclosing  MOF \ndecrees on tariff policies on its website.12 \n \n\nf. \n\nTrigger 6: Issue a government decree specifying a higher capital requirement for \ninsurance companies (current status: achieved) \n\n \n49.  Peraturan  Pemerintah  (PP)  or  government  regulation  No.  39/2008  specifying  a  higher \ncapital requirement for insurance companies was issued on 19 May 2008. The decree is part of \nthe  broader  effort  to  reduce  financial  sector  vulnerabilities  and  improve  the  stability  and \noperations of insurance markets, a key nonbank market needed to spread risk and increase the \navailability of longer-term finance. An earlier regulation in 1999 (PP No. 73/99) had raised the \nminimum  paid-up  capital  to  Rp100  billion  for  insurance  companies  and  Rp200  billion  for \nreinsurance  companies  (from  Rp2  billion  for  life  insurance  companies,  Rp3 billion  for  nonlife \ninsurance  companies,  and  Rp10  billion  for  reinsurance  companies).  However,  this  regulation \nwas  only  applicable  to  new  companies,  which  meant  that  companies  that  existed  before  the \neffective  date  of  PP  No.  73/99  were  not  subjected  to  this  regulation.  This  created  unfair \ntreatment  among  companies  and  unfavorable  conditions  for  industry  development.  The  new \nregulation stipulates that the minimum paid-up capital of Rp100 billion for insurance companies \nand  Rp200  billion  for  reinsurance  companies  should  be  applicable  to  all  such  companies  and \nsets a date of 31 December 2010 for full compliance with this requirement. \n \n\ng. \n\nTrigger 7: Rationalize SME financing/microfinance schemes across line ministries \nand state-owned enterprises (SOE), including issuing a presidential decree on the \nlegal establishment of provincial credit guarantee and re-guarantee institutions \n(current status: achieved) \n\n \n50. \nAccess  to  credit  has  long  been  a  major  constraint  to  the  growth  of  micro,  small,  and \nmedium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs)  in  Indonesia.  Numerous  line  ministries  and  SOEs  have \ntried to run several schemes to finance micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises with limited \nsuccess.  On  the  other  hand,  the  ability  of  PT  Askrindo  and  Perum  Jamkrindo,  the  two  credit \nguarantee  institutions  set  up  by  the  Government  to  reduce  risks  to  banks,  to  underwrite  new \nbusiness  had  been  severely  constrained  by  the  limited  availability  of  capital.  The  Government \nresolved  this  issue  by  injecting  capital  of  Rp1.4  trillion  to  these  companies  in  late  2007.  In \nOctober 2007, the Government also moved towards rationalizing all SME financing programs of \nline  ministries  into  a  unified  guarantee  scheme  by  initiating  the  signing  of  a  memorandum  of \nunderstanding  with  six banks,  five  line  ministries  and  the  two  credit  guarantee  companies  to \nlaunch  the  People\u2019s  Entrepreneurship  Credit  Program  (KUR)  to  facilitate  partially  guarantee \ncredits to MSMEs. Under the KUR scheme, the banks will take up 30% of the credit risk and the \ncredit guarantee institutions will take the remainder. As of July 2008, disbursements under the \nKUR  had  reached  around  Rp9  trillion.  In  addition,  the  Government  also  issued  Presidential \n                                                 \n \n12 Tim Tarif. www.tarif.depkeu.go.id \n\n \n\n\f 20 \n\nRegulation  No.  2/2008  in  January  2008  that  allowed  for  the  establishment  of  provincial  credit \nguarantee companies and the development of re-guarantee companies. \n\n2. \n\nCore Policy Area II: Improved Public Financial Management and \nGovernance \n\n51. \nAfter  the  adoption  of  a  new  regulatory  framework  of  2003-2004,  the  Government  is \nimplementing  public  financial  management  reforms  as  legislated.  These  efforts  are  part  of  a \nbroader agenda to improve governance and enhance service delivery, with the ultimate goal of \nsustained  economic  growth  and  poverty  alleviation.  Progress  has  been  achieved  in  the  way \npublic  finances  are  managed  and  in  increasing  transparency  and  independent  oversight.  In \nparticular,  progress  has  been  made  in  streamlining  the  budget  formulation  process  and \ndocumentation as articulated in new public financial management (PFM) laws. The Government \nis also beginning to address civil service reforms with a view to providing an enabling framework \nfor  more  effective  public  institutions.  These  achievements  provide  a  firm  foundation  for  further \nprogress,  but  significant  challenges  remain  across  the  public  financial  management  cycle \nincluding budget formulation, execution, and reporting and auditing. \n \n52. \nAlthough the budget preparation process is not yet compatible with a medium-term fiscal \nperspective,  progress  is  being  made  on  this  front.  There  has  been  some  progress  in  recent \nyears in terms of aligning policy priorities to allocations in the budget. The DPL-4/DPSP-3 also \nsupported the introduction of a medium-term macro fiscal framework in the 2008 budget, with a \nsystem  of  forward  estimates  for  two  out-years.  However,  budget  submissions  continue  to  be \nannual  and  there  is  no  framework  to  establish  credible  forward  estimates  that  are  reconciled \nwith the projected resource envelope and other projections. To address this issue, the current \nprogram  supports  reforms  to  the  budget  preparation  process  by  revising  budget  templates  to \ngive them a greater results orientation. Despite these efforts, the full development of a medium-\nterm  expenditure  framework  (MTEF)  can  realistically  only  be  achieved  in  the  medium  to  long \nterm.  \n \n53.  With regard to the budget execution process, a number of challenges remain pertaining \nto  cash  management,  processing,  accounting  and  reporting  of  both  revenue  and  expenditure \ntransactions,  and  the  execution  of  capital  expenditures.  Progress  has  been  made  in  the \ndevelopment of a treasury single account (TSA) to strengthen cash management, but a number \nof accounts (e.g., salary accounts, revenue accounts) continue to hold idle cash balances and \noperational cash planning is at a very early stage of development. A chart of accounts broadly \nconsistent  with  the  Government  Finance  Statistics  Manual  (GFSM) 2001  was  introduced  in \n2005,  enabling  codification  of  expenditures  across  multiple  dimensions  and  stages  of  the \nexpenditure  management  cycle,  but  some  segments  such  as  the  activity  and  program  codes \nneed  improvement.  The  Government  also  promulgated  Government  Accounting  Standards  in \n2005 that are being adhered to, and has made good progress in ensuring timely availability of \nannual  financial  statements  to  Parliament  and  to  the  public.  Additional  MOF  regulations  have \nput emphasis on ministers being responsible to record the budget allotment in their ministries; \nintroduced  new  accounting  subsystems  at  the  treasury  accounting  system;  and  placed  more \nemphasis  on  receivables,  payables,  and  investment  recording  at  the  line  ministries.  However, \nthere are problems in the application of the standards in the line ministries, and the systems and \ndata  environment  for  processing  and  recording  of  transactions  is  fragmented  and  not  yet  fully \nautomated\u2014undermining and the accuracy and reliability of financial reporting. This has led the \nexternal  audit  over  the  past  years  to  issue  a  disclaimer  audit  opinion  on  the  annual  financial \nstatements because of reliability and other issues. There are also problems in the execution of \nthe  capital  budget,  and  procedural  bottlenecks  have  caused  expenditure  patterns  to  remain \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nskewed toward the second half of the fiscal year. This has raised issues of quality of spending \nand project preparation and implementation. If not addressed expeditiously, these weaknesses \nin  budget  execution  could  potentially  threaten  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  maintain  good  fiscal \ndiscipline and expenditure management. \n \n54. \nIn  addition,  government-wide  civil  service  regulations  give  limited  flexibility  to  line \nagencies  to  attract,  recruit,  deploy,  and  retain  staff  with  professional  skills  that  match  their \nincreasingly  complex  operational  needs.  Centralized  controls  and  strict  guidelines \nfor \norganizational design applied government-wide create a rigid system that make adjustments of \norganizational  structures  difficult.  Taken  together,  these  regulations  impede  performance \nmanagement and professionalism in public institutions. \n \nThe  DPL-5/DPSP-4  is  bolstering  critical  reform  measures  aimed  at  addressing  the \n55. \nchallenges  identified.  Strategically  chosen,  the  DPSP-4/DPL-5  actions  support  the  broader \ngovernance  agenda  in  Indonesia  with  actions  focused  on  key  aspects  in  budget  preparation, \nexecution,  and  civil  service  reforms.  Specifically,  the  DPL-5  supports  reforms  to  the  budget \npreparation  process  with  a  view  to  instituting  more  results-oriented  budget  documents. \nCommensurate  with  the  significant  challenges  in  the  budget  execution  area,  the  program \nincludes  four  reform  actions  to  enhance  budget  execution,  including  further  implementation  of \nthe  TSA  and  automation  of  treasury  operations,  actions  aimed  at  smoothing  disbursement  of \ncapital  expenditures,  the  strengthening  of  accounting  capabilities  in  line  ministries,  and \nimproving the institutional framework for procurement reforms. In addition, through the focus on \ncivil  service  reforms,  the  DPL/DPSP  seeks  to  expand  this  reform  area  beyond  the  pilot \nspearheaded by MOF.  \n \n\na. \n\nTrigger 8: Make further progress toward the establishment of a comprehensive TSA \nregime, including revenue accounts. Establish a counterpart team to implement the \nnew automated treasury system, and begin mapping and reviewing of business \nprocesses to increase readiness for system rollout in 2009. Modernize 30 provincial \ntreasury offices (KPPNs) (status: achieved) \n\n \n56. \nConsiderable progress has been made in implementing a TSA, as foreseen by the State \nTreasury Law, 2004. The rollout to the revenue accounts has commenced on a pilot basis after \nlong delays brought on by protracted negotiations with Bank Indonesia and commercial banks \non  interest  payment  for  government  balances  held  at  Bank  Indonesia  and  remuneration  of \nbanking  services  by  the  Government.  The  Treasury  is  pilot  testing  the  daily  sweep  of \ngovernment revenue deposits from collecting branches of the five largest commercial banks and \npost offices into the TSA with Bank Indonesia. The daily sweep is expected to be extended to all \ncommercial  bank  branches  starting  January  2009.  The  daily  sweep  will  be  with  respect  to \ndeposits  made  the  previous  day  and  not  on  the  same  day.  This  is  because  the  commercial \nbanks have agreed not to charge for this service provided the sweep is done the following day. \nThis is a significant improvement over the current practice, established since 1989, of sweeping \nthe  revenue  accounts  twice  a  week.  Concerning  cash  concentration  of  accounts  held  by  line \nministries, MOF has completed a census of all government accounts pursuant to the regulation \non  management  of  government  bank  accounts  issued  in  2007.  This  census  identified  32,570 \nsuch accounts. At the end of December 2007, 2,086 of these accounts were closed. Efforts are \nongoing to determine further banks accounts of the remaining 30,484, which can be included in \nthe TSA regime either directly or through a mechanism of daily sweeps into the TSA. \n \n57.  MOF is preparing for the implementation of an integrated financial management system \nto replace the multitude of financial data processing applications currently used by government \n\n \n\n\f 22 \n\ninstitutions.  The  system,  known  by  the  acronym  SPAN,  will  integrate  and  replace  the  multiple \nsoftware applications within the treasury as well as those being implemented in the DG Budget \nto support the budget formulation process. Following a detailed internal review of the system, a \nnew management and implementation structure for the automated treasury system was agreed \nupon, and a counterpart team for implementing the system has been established. The mapping \nand review of business processes has commenced.  The modernization of treasury offices has \nbeen completed in 33 out of 176 KPPNs, exceeding the trigger requirement. \n \n\nb. \n\nTrigger 9: Enhance performance-based budgeting by initiating a review and revision \nof the existing program structure to increase accountability, revise the budget \nsubmission templates (for RKA-KL), draft accompanying budget preparation \nmanuals, and draft key performance indicators for the Ministry of Finance (current \nstatus: achieved) \n\n \n58. \nAs part of the move toward program and performance-based budgeting, DG  Budget in \nMOF has started to review and refine the Ministry/Institutional Budget and work plans (RKA-KL) \nand  accompanying  budget  preparation  manuals  for  six  pilot  ministries.  This  is  with  a  view  to \nsimplifying the budget submission and to link it more closely to programs. Beside performance \nindicators, the templates also add narrative information on program strategies and objectives in \norder  to  provide  a  clearer  link  between  program  objectives  and  funding  levels.  The  templates \nalso  contain  columns  for  forward  estimates  of  expenditures.  The  draft  MTEF-performance-\nbased  budgeting  (PBB)  budget  preparation  manuals  are  being  finalized  by  DG  Budget  and \nBappenas.  The  intention  is  to  use  the  MTEF-PBB  manual  to  guide  ministries  in  their  budget \nsubmissions pertaining to FY2010.13 \n \n59. \nIn  parallel,  Bappenas,  in  coordination  with  MOF,  is  reviewing  and  revising  the  existing \nprogram structure. The new program structure will be embedded in the next 5-year plan, which \nwill  cover  2010\u20132014.  The  intention  is  to  align  programs  to  organizational  structures  to  create \nan accountability framework. Key performance indicators for the Ministry of Finance have been \ndrafted and are under review. \n \n\nc. \n\nTrigger 10: All DIPAs are issued and teams assigned at the beginning of the \nfiscal year, by eliminating the annual surat keputusans requirement (for project \nmanagers) for multi-year projects and allowing for parallel processing of \nprocurement. (current status: achieved) \n\n \nDIPAs  (spending  warrants)  for  the  2008  budget  were  issued  on  2  January  2008  and \n60. \nother actions to smoothen disbursement patterns are ongoing. DG Treasury is preparing a new \nregulation for accepting the names of key officials of satkers (project management units) listed \nin the DIPA as the legally authorized budget users of the satkers. This will obviate the need for \nissuing  annual  surat  keputusans  (decree  letters)  reappointing  key  satker  officials.  However, \nsurat  keputusans  will  be  issued  whenever  there  is  a  change  in  the  incumbents.  It  is  expected \nthat the new regulation will become effective from FY2009. \n \nThe  parallel  initiation  of  procurement  has  been  implemented  in  some  line  ministries, \n61. \nincluding  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works.    While  procurements  can  legally  be  initiated  after  the \nadoption of the state budget in October of the preceding fiscal year, this practice is not widely \n                                                 \n \n13 The  2010  budget  will  be  the  first  in  the  next  5-year  planning  period,  which  will  outline  the  policy  priorities  of  the \n\nincoming government after the general elections in 2009. \n\n\f \n\n23\n\nadopted because of a number of reasons. These include a lack of knowledge of this fact as well \nas  a  lack  of  operating  expenses  to  cover  procurement-related  costs,  including  posting  of \nadvertisements and meetings of procurement committees. The main issue here appears to be \nanticipation of budget needs for starting the procurement process in the previous fiscal year by \nincluding a line item in the DIPA identifying pre-financing needs for the following year\u2019s budget. \nThe  National  Public  Procurement  Office  (LKPP)  has  issued  a  circular  to  publicize  this  to  line \nministries, with guidance on how to initiate procurement steps prior to the start of the fiscal year. \n \nThe  detrimental  impact  of  slow  and  skewed  disbursements  of  capital  and  material \n62. \nexpenditures has been widely recognized by policymakers and budget stakeholders at various \nlevels.  The  Treasury  has  conducted  a  survey  of  the  impediments  to  the  disbursement  of \nbudgetary  funds  through  questionnaires.  The  results  of  the  survey  have  been  reviewed,  and \nhave formed the basis of an action plan, which has been drafted, to smooth out disbursements \nduring the year.  \n \n\nd. \n\nTrigger 11: Complete a midterm review to assess the application of accounting \nstandards and accounting procedure manuals by line ministries (current status: \nexceeded) \n\n \n63. \nA midterm review was undertaken and revised accounting procedures for line ministries \nhave  been  issued.  MOF  Regulation  No.  171/PMK.05/2007  on  Accounting  System  for  Line \nMinistries  was  issued  on  27  December  2007,  replacing  PMK  59/PMK.05/2005  on  the  Central \nGovernment Accounting System.  \n \nThe  revision  was  necessitated  by  significant  problems  in  the  application  of  the  2005 \n64. \nstandards in the line ministries. The annual financial statements of a number of line ministries \nreceive a disclaimer audit opinion from the external auditor because of issues on completeness \nand reliability. The changes brought about by the new regulation include (i) an emphasis on line \nministries  being  responsible  for  recording  the  budget  allotment  for  their  ministries;  and  (ii)  an \nemphasis  on  recording  receivables,  payables,  and  investments  by  the  line  ministries  with  a \nrequirement  that  these  should  be  recorded  and  reported  in  the  line  ministries\u2019  financial \nstatements.    These  changes  also  represent  an  important  step  in  moving  towards  full  accrual \naccounting.    The  changes  should  be  reflected  in  the  line  ministries\u2019  financial  statements  for \n2008, which should be issued in March 2009 \n \n65. \nThe  capacity  constraints  in  the  line  ministries  are  being  addressed  through  training  of \nstaff  on  these  changes,  and  accounting  issues  generally,  through  an  ambitious  training \nprogram.  The  target  is  to  train  over  7,000  accounting  staff  in  line  ministries.  So  far, \n3,185 persons have been trained. The goal is to train at least one staff in a satker by the end of \nFY2009. \n \n\ne. \n\nTrigger 12: Make newly established LKPP operational by recruiting staff and \nallocating budget to cover operational costs and revise Presidential Decree No. \n80/2003 to, among others, accommodate a new set of standard bidding documents \n(current status: satisfactory) \n\n \n66. \nThe  last  year  has  seen  the  enactment  of  the  legal  framework  establishing  an \nindependent  Lembaga  Kebijakan  Pengadaan  Barang/Jasa  Pemerintah  (LKPP)  or  the  national \npublic  procurement  office  reporting  directly  to  the  President.  The  development  of  the \norganization  structure  and  staffing  for  the  new  LKPP  is  progressing  well.  In  addition  to  the \nchairperson  and  an  executive  secretary,  there  will  be  four  departments,  each  headed  by  an \n\n \n\n\f 24 \n\nechelon  I  deputy  with  respective  responsibility  for  (i) strategy  and  policy  development, \n(ii) monitoring  evaluation  and  information  systems,  (iii) human  resources  development,  and \n(iv) legal affairs and settlement of objections. These six major positions have been filled, and the \njob descriptions for echelon II and III staff have been finalized and recruitment is ongoing. The \nnecessary budget allocation for operational costs has been provided to LKPP. \n \n67. \nProgress on streamlining the regulatory framework for public procurement is under way \nthough  perhaps  not  at  the  pace  anticipated.  Presidential  Decree  No.  80/2003  promotes  the \nbasic  principles  of  procurement:  transparency,  open  and  fair  competition,  economy,  and \nefficiency. It covers all areas of procurement that use public funds and contracting entities at all \nlevels  of  government.  However,  the  pace  of  Indonesia\u2019s  decentralization  reforms  has  had  an \nimpact  on  public  sector  procurement  as  different  levels  of  government\u2014from  ministers, \ngovernors, and even mayors\u2014are able to issue their own decrees, regulations, and instructions. \nThe  plethora  of  regulations  is  often  inconsistent  with  one  another  and  many  do  not  meet \naccepted international practice. Work on drafting a procurement law is in progress but finalizing \nthe law and enacting it may require another 2\u20133 years as it has to go through Parliament plus \nthe  possible  resistance  by  special  interest  groups.  Meanwhile,  LKPP  is  revising  Presidential \nDecree  80/2003  to  make  it  more  user-friendly  and  update  clauses  where  necessary.  The  first \nstep  is  to  compile  and  consolidate  Presidential  Decree  80/2003  and  all  subsequent \namendments  into  one  document.  This  has  been  substantially  achieved.  The  next  step  is  to \nprepare  an  operational  manual  that  will  be  complemented  by  the  set  of  standard  bidding \ndocuments,  which  have  been  drafted  with  the  help  of  ADB  TA. 14 Harmonizing  Presidential \nDecree  80/2003  and  the  standard  bidding  documents  with  international  good  practice  would \nimprove procurement in Indonesia and could potentially increase the use of country systems in \nprocurement under government projects financed by donors. \n \n\nf. \n\nTrigger 13: Expand civil service reform pilot to five additional agencies in 2008. \nUpdate MOF organizational road map and implement next phase of the Ministry\u2019s \nhuman resource management strategy (current status: satisfactory) \n\n \n68.  MOF  is  continuing  to  implement  its  human  resource  management  strategy.  New  job \ndescriptions  and  a  grading  system  were  introduced,  and  the  allocation  of  all  positions  to \n27 grades was finalized by the end of 2007. In conjunction, an extra allowance was introduced, \ndetermined  by  the  new  grading  system.  This  represents  the  first  step  in  an  effort  to  improve \nperformance, measure performance, and reduce corruption. Echelon I officials in MOF are now \nexpected  to  resign  from  commissioner  assignments  in  SOEs  within  their  field  of  authority  to \nreduce  the potential  for  conflicts  of  interest.  However,  the  other  parts  of  this  reform  step  have \nnot yet been completed, and Key performance indicators have not yet been introduced, delaying \nperformance-based  management.  Currently, \nfor  recruitment  and \npromotion  is  being  transformed  into  a  process  based  on  announced  vacancies,  voluntary \napplications,  and  competitive  selection  based  on  merit;  and  an  assessment  center  is  being \nestablished to support the new policy. Simultaneously, the rotation policy (i.e., the policy under \nwhich  civil  servants  in  echelons  II\u2013IV  are  moved  between  offices,  functions,  and  locations  on \naverage  once  every  third  year)  is  being  reviewed  to  support  career  development  and \nsustainability better. Development of a new intranet-based human resource information system \nhas recently been initiated. The previously introduced road map development for MOF has been \n                                                 \n \n14  ADB.  2001.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  to  Strengthen  Procurement  Policies,  Legal \n\nthe  selection  process \n\nFrameworks, and Institutions.  Manila (TA 3720-INO, approved September, $500,000). \n\n\f \n\n25\n\nreplaced; the minister plans to introduce a law on MOF and a first draft academic paper for such \na law has been prepared.  \n \n69. \nThe five agencies involved in the civil service pilot are the Supreme Audit Agency (BPK), \nKPK, Ministry of State Apparatus Reform (MenPAN), MOF, and the Supreme Court. The rollout \nof civil service reform to agencies other than MOF is now done under the aegis of the National \nCommittee for Bureaucracy Reform, by MenPAN.  Three of the approved pilot agencies (MOF, \nBPK,  and  the  Supreme  Court)  have  all  received  extra  budget  allocation  to  cover  new \nallowances.  By  the  end  of  this  year,  BPK  and  the  Supreme  Court  should  have  made \nconsiderable progress in initiating reform.  KPK\u2019s role is to monitor reform progress in the other \ninstitutions, as KPK is exempt from the civil service scheme and not in need of similar reforms. \nHowever,  MenPAN  has  yet  to  implement  similar  reforms  in  addition  to  its  activities  to  expand \nreforms to other institutions and/or regional governments. \n\n3. \n\nCore Policy Area III: Improved Delivery of Public Services \n\nImproving  delivery  of  public  services  continues  to  be  critical  for  Indonesia.  Lagging \n70. \nhuman development indicators\u2014such as the high maternal mortality rate, malnutrition rate, and \nlow  transition  from  primary  school  to  secondary  school\u2014must  be  tackled  by  improving  the \nquality of services. This goes beyond levels of public spending. It is about knowing what works \nand what does not. It is about institutionalizing program assessment and linking the findings with \nplanning  and  budget  allocations.  It  is  about  having  a  good  system  to  target  the  marginalized \ngroups.  It  is  also  about  empowering  local  government,  community,  and  service  providers  to \ndeliver quality services. \n \n71. \nIndonesia has recognized the importance of institutionalizing evaluation and assessment \nin  the  policy  formulation  and  budgetary  allocation  processes.  The  intent  is  to  promote  a  more \nadequate generation and systematic use of public performance information in decision making \nwhile  strengthening  effective  accountability,  within  the  Government,  service  providers,  and \ncitizens.  This  is  a  complex  and  long-term  objective,  and  can  only  happen  by  strengthening \ncapacities to produce reliable and timely performance information, and through the introduction \nof  sound  institutional  arrangements  to  ensure  that  monitoring  and  evaluation  is  properly \nintegrated into the management cycle. \n \n72. \nOver the past few years, the Government has launched several large-scale programs to \nimprove  the  access  of  marginalized  groups  to  basic  services.  Improving  targeting  in  these \nprograms remains an ongoing challenge. Historically, household targeting systems in Indonesia \nhave not been particularly strong. Not only do all programs have sizeable under-coverage and \nleakage errors, programs also tend to have different targeting systems. \n \nAfter  decentralization,  about  one-third  of  total  public  expenditures  is  allocated  and \n73. \nimplemented  at  the  district  level.  Yet  local  governments  have  weak  capacity  to  plan,  budget, \nand execute spending of these funds, particularly in improving the delivery of public services. In \nrecent years, this has been reflected in increased surpluses run by local governments. For more \neffective spending to take place, there needs to be a substantial improvement in the capacity of \nthe  local  government  and  local  service  provider  to  plan,  budget,  and  implement  programs  for \nbetter service delivery. \n \nIndonesia has also had a long history of using communities to provide basic services to \n74. \npoor  people  through  community-driven  development  projects.  These  have  demonstrated  that \ncommunities  are  well  equipped  to  build  and  maintain  village  infrastructure,  most  often  roads, \n\n \n\n\f 26 \n\nbridges,  water  supply,  irrigation  systems,  and  markets.  Community-based  development  also \naddresses  in  an  integrated  fashion  the  binding  constraints  to  poverty  reduction  at  the  village \nlevel\u2014whether  these  are  village  roads,  water  and  sanitation  systems,  or  other  constraints  to \npoverty  and  well-being.  With  the  launch  in  August  2006  of  the  National  Community \nEmpowerment  Program  (PNPM),  the  various  community-driven  development  programs  are \nbeing consolidated and will be scaled up nationwide by the end of 2009. \n \n75. \nIndonesia has identified education as one of the critical sectors with regard to improving \nthe  quality  of  life  of  its  citizens  and  the  attainment  of  its  MDGs.  In  December  2005,  with  the \npassage of the Teacher Law, the Government launched a highly ambitious effort to upgrade the \nquality of its teachers. Under the new law, minimum service standards for education have been \nestablished  with  the  help  of  ADB,  and  all  teachers  will  have  their  basic  salary  doubled  upon \nbeing  certified  as  meeting  the  competency  standards  mandated  by  the  law.  Those  in  remote \nareas will be provided additional incentives, which will almost triple their basic salaries.  \n \n\na. \n\nTrigger 14: Institutionalize a government system for program evaluation by \nappointing a Deputy for Performance Evaluation within Bappenas, with three \ndirectors responsible, respectively, for sectoral evaluation, regional evaluation, and \nsystems and reporting of development performance (current status: achieved) \n\n \nThe  Government  has  institutionalized  systems  for  program  evaluation  by  appointing  a \n76. \nDeputy  for  Performance  Evaluation  (DPE)  within  Bappenas,  with  three  directors  focusing  on \nsectoral  evaluation,  regional  evaluation,  and  on  systems  and  reporting  of  development \nperformance. The DPE is currently developing a work plan and has been assisted in this task by \na  number  of  donors.  A  high  priority  is  working  together  with  MOF  and  other  departments  in \nBappenas to prepare a new program structure more conducive to performance-based budgeting \nunder the new medium-term development plan (2010\u20132015).  \n \n\nb. \n\nTrigger 15: Improve effectiveness in subnational spending by issuing guidelines for \npro-poor budgeting and planning for local governments. (current status: achieved) \n\n \n77. \nThe Government has committed to making public expenditures more pro-poor. With the \nrole  of  local  governments  in  poverty  reduction,  economic  development,  and  service  delivery \nrising  sharply  in  the  years  since the  2001  decentralization, public  expenditures  by  subnational \ngovernments  need  to  be  made  more  pro-poor.  To  increase  awareness  of  this  need  and  build \ncapacity at the local level, the Government with the assistance of ADB has issued guidelines for \npro-poor  budgeting  and  planning  for  local  governments  by  producing  a  pro-poor  planning  and \nbudgeting handbook.15 Bappenas launched the handbook in July 2008 and has disseminated it \nto 400 local governments, and uploaded it on its website. The plan is to follow up in 2009 with \nan extensive training program. \n \n\nc. \n\nTrigger 16: Increase community block grant of PNPM to maximize employment and \npoverty impacts. (current status: achieved) \n\n \nThe block grant amount has been adjusted from about Rp1.5 billion on average in 2007 \n78. \nto Rp1.8 billion in 2008. The Government is now planning for what increases will take place for \n2009. Studies have shown that the program is less effective in richer kecamatans (sub-districts), \n                                                 \n \n15 ADB.  2006.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  Pro-Poor  Planning  and  Budgeting.  Manila \n\n(TA 4762-INO, approved 1 September). \n\n\f \n\n27\n\nwhich already have more infrastructure, so the Government needs to think through the size of \nblock grants for poorer areas versus richer ones. The Government has indicated its commitment \nto do so in the 2009 budget. \n \n\nd. \n\nTrigger 17: Require teachers (other than head teachers) to be assigned a minimum \nof 24 teaching hours per week in order to receive either the professional allowance \n(for certified teachers) or the special area allowance (for teachers working in \nhardship areas), or a combination of both (current status: achieved) \n\n \n79. \nThe Ministry of National Education has issued a ministerial decree requiring all teachers \nto deliver 24 teaching hours per week in order to receive the professional allowance for certified \nteachers. In addition, teachers receiving the special area allowance are required to fulfill the 24 \nteaching-hour  requirement.  Initial  anecdotal  evidence  indicates  that  the  policy  is  having  its \nintended  effect  where  teachers  in  overstaffed  schools  are  requesting  to  be  moved  to \nunderstaffed schools. \n\nC. \n\nMonitoring the Impact of DPSP-4 \n\n80. \nAs part of the policy matrix for the DPL-1 (prior to ADB\u2019s direct cofinancing involvement), \noutcome  indicators  and  targets  were  introduced  to  highlight  the  expected  key  results  of  the \nsupport.  These  indicators  were  taken  mainly  from  government  planning  documents.  These \nindicators and targets have been adjusted as the program has evolved. They will form the basis \nfor  evaluating  the  program,  and  will  be  complemented  by  other  indicators  such  as  the \nstandardized  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  framework  used  to  assess  PFM. \nSuch an evaluation was undertaken jointly by the Government, ADB, and the World Bank earlier \nthis year for DPLs 1\u20134 and DPSP-1.16  \n\nD. \n\nTriggers for Future DPLs/DPSPs \n\n81. \nThe current DPL program is the fifth such operation in Indonesia, but is the first of a new \nthree DPL series as proposed under the World Bank\u2019s country partnership strategy for FY2009\u2013\nFY2012.  Indicative  triggers  for  the  remaining  two  DPL  series  have  been  developed  after \ndetailed  discussions  between  government  counterparts  and  the  three  donors  involved  in  the \nDPL/DPSP process, (Table 5). While triggers for DPL-6/DPSP-5 are fairly well defined, those for \nDPL-7/DPSP-6,  which  would  be  negotiated  with  the  government  that  is  in  power  following \nelections  in  2009  are,  of  necessity,  more  tentative.  The  new  program  represents,  in  most \nrespects, a continuation of the previous program in that it is structured around many of the same \nreform  aims.  Among  the  policy  actions  proposed  are  ones  that  are  intended  to  further  reduce \nuncertainty  for  investors,  continue  with  the  implementation  of  the  NSW,  further  improve  the \nresults orientation of the budget process, further reduce tax compliance costs and enhance tax \npayer  services,  continue  to  improve  budget  and  cash  management  within  the  central \ngovernment,  continue  the  efforts  to  improve  public  procurement,  and  enhance  the  pro-poor \nimpact of public service delivery.  At the request of the Government, facilitating trade integration \nand  promoting  export  competitiveness,  and  strengthening  management  of  state  assets  have \nbeen added as new reform aims of the program. \n \n                                                 \n \n16 Based on the joint evaluation, a project completion report (PCR) for the DPSP-1 has been completed. The PCR for \nthe DPSP 2\u20133 cluster program will be completed in 2009.

The  DPSP-4  provides  parallel  cofinancing  for  the  World  Bank-\nsupported DPL-5, for which the Government has requested $750 million. The loan will have a \n15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge \nof  0.15%  per  annum;17 conversion  options  that  may  be  exercised  in  accordance  with  the  draft \nLoan Agreement, the loan regulations, and ADB\u2019s conversion guidelines; and such other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the draft program Loan Agreement. The Government has made its \nown independent decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and it has given \nan undertaking that this choice was not made on the basis of any advice from ADB. Responding \nfavorably  to  the  Government\u2019s  request  will  signal  ADB\u2019s  relevance  in  an  emerging,  confident, \nand  well-performing  middle-income  country.  In  addition,  the  Government  intends  to  request \n$100 million from the Government of Japan for parallel cofinancing of the DPL-5. \n \nGross financing needs of the Government have increased from $11.5 billion in 2006 to \n83. \n$15.5 billion in 2007 and an estimated $17.5 billion in 2008. This reflects a higher fiscal deficit \nand high levels of domestic and foreign debt principal repayment. The Government has sought \nabout  $3.0  billion  in  program  loan  and  budget  support  operations  from  development  partners: \nADB ($850 million); Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement ($200 million); Japan ($500 million); \nand the World Bank ($1.6 billion). For the proposed DPL-5, the World Bank envisages providing \na $750 million program loan on International Bank for Reconstruction and Development terms. \nADB\u2019s  proposed  support  is  based  on  the  strengths  of  the  policy  package,  its  development \nimpact,  the  importance  of  the  sectors  covered,  and  the  investment  needs.  Besides,  the \nGovernment  will  incur  cash  outlays  in  excess  of  $200  million  to  implement  many  of  the \ninstitutional strengthening measures supported under the DPSP-4, such as fully operationalizing \nthe NSW for clearance of merchandise and the proposed national procurement office. \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\nThe  Coordinating  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs  will  be \n\n84. \nthe  Executing  Agency, \ncollaborating closely with MOF. Implementation of DPL-5/DPSP-4 actions is coordinated with a \nnumber  of  other  ministries  and  agencies,  including  Bappenas,  Ministry  of  Trade,  Ministry  of \nCooperatives and SME, and Bank Indonesia.  \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n85. \n\nThe program implementation period for the DPSP-4 is from January to December 2008.  \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement Arrangements  \n\n86. \nThe  program  loan  of  $200  million  will  be  released  in  a  single  tranche  upon  loan \neffectiveness.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs \n(excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries, \nexcluding  the  items  specified  in  the  negative  list  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  8)  and  imports \nfinanced  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  In  accordance  with  ADB  provisions  for \n\n                                                 \n \n17 ADB\u2019s Board of Directors has discounted the commitment charge to 0.15%, and waived the front-end fee of 1.00% \n\nfor loans approved from 1 July 2007 up to and including 30 June 2009.   \n\n \n\n\fsimplifying disbursement of program loans,18 the proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed \nto  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  as  the  Borrower.  No  supporting  import  documentation  will  be \nrequired  if  during  each  year  that  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed  the  value  of \nIndonesia\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and \nimports  financed  under  other  official  development  assistance  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the \namount of the loan expected to be disbursed during such year. The Government will certify its \ncompliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation \nunder existing procedures will be required.  \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption  \n\n87. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Program.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Program  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Program. In addition, the DPSP-4 \nhas a core focus on improving governance and anticorruption. It promotes transparency in PFM. \nNoteworthy progress has been achieved through the TSA system and in the implementation of \ntransparent  accountability  arrangements  for  central  government  investment  funding  (RDI)  and \nregional development accounts, which will help the Government in its anticorruption efforts. The \nprogram\u2019s  focus  on  tax  audit  procedures,  simplifying  and/or  eliminating  unnecessary  business \nlicenses,  and  implementing  good  corporate  governance  in  state-owned  banks  will  also  further \nthe Government\u2019s anticorruption agenda and improve the investment climate. \n \n88. \nThe Government places significant emphasis on strengthening internal control systems \nand  overall  PFM,  with  support  from  the  World  Bank  through  the  Government  Financial \nManagement  and  Revenue  Administration  Project  and  from  ADB  through  the  State  Audit \nReform  Sector  Development  Program. 19  Reforms  and  capacity  development  initiatives \nsupported under both these programs have led to initial progress in strengthening PFM. \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n89. \nADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for the withdrawal applications. Prior to withdrawal, the Government \nwill nominate a deposit account at Bank Indonesia to receive all loan proceeds. The account will \nbe managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n\n6. \n\nPerformance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n\nThe  Coordinating  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs,  MOF,  and  Bappenas  will  continuously \n90. \nmonitor  implementation  of  the  DPL-related  reforms  and  their  impacts,  in  line  with  the  overall \nprogram  framework  and  outcome/output  indicators  agreed  upon  with  the  Government.  The \nevaluation  of  the  triggers  is  also  done  by  the  participating  development  partners  based  on \nfrequent  discussions  with  key  government  counterparts,  and  the  collection  of  evidence  in  the \nform of key implementation decrees, circulars, etc.  \n                                                 \n \n18 ADB. 1998.

Significant benefits stem from the engagement of Indonesia\u2019s three main \n92. \ndevelopment  partners.  Participation  in  the  DPL  series  has  helped  in  overall  institutional \ncoordination  among  the  partners  as  well  as  between  the  Government  and  the  partners. \nProvision  of  advisory  support  through  TA  has  also  been  significantly  streamlined  and \ncoordinated to best meet the Government\u2019s needs. The measures supported under the DPSP \ncluster  will  result  in  sustained  institutional  capacity  in  such  key  areas  of  policy  formulation  as \nfiscal policy, debt and treasury management, and public expenditure and financial management. \n \nSocial.  The  main  contribution  of  support  being  leveraged  through  the  DPSPs  is  in  the \n93. \nform  of  improved  public  administration,  sustaining  effective  public  expenditure  reorientation \ntoward  productive  needs,  and  continuously  supporting  government  measures  to  align  its \nresources effectively with its medium-term objectives of economic growth and poverty reduction. \nBy  focusing  on  supporting  strategic  reforms  aimed  at  improving  public  service  delivery,  the \nProgram  will  have  direct  beneficial  social  impact.  Appendix  8  presents  a  summary  poverty \nreduction and social impact mitigation strategy. \n \nEconomic.  The  nature  of  the  DPSP  series  limits  the  scope  for  quantitative  economic \n94. \nanalysis.  However,  qualitative  assessment  of  the  Program\u2019s  outcomes  and  impacts  was \nassessed  in  terms  of  effect  channels,  stakeholder  groups,  and  the  expected  time  needed  for \neffects  to  occur.  In  terms  of  effect  channels,  the  Program  will  impact  largely  through  lower \nbusiness  transaction  costs,  improved  access  to  assets  (specifically  capital  for  SME),  and \nprogressive  improvements  to  both  the  quantity  and  quality  of  public  services  (including  better \ntargeting  of  such  services  to  the  poor).  In  terms  of  time,  the  net  effect  of  lower  business \ntransaction  costs  from  regulatory  reform,  and  reduced  times  for  business  licensing,  VAT \nrefunds,  and  import  and  export  applications  through  the  NSW  are  expected  to  be  realized \nprogressively  over  the  medium  term  in  the  form  of  improved  growth  and  poverty  outcomes  by \nindirectly encouraging competition and investment. The net effect of improved access to finance \n\n32 \n\n \n\n91. \n \n\n \n\n\fresults-oriented  budget  documents, \n\nfor  SME  is  to  reduce  poverty  indirectly  through  additional  growth,  to  the  extent  that  access  to \nfinance is a constraint to SME development. Initially, the main beneficiaries would be SME and \nlarger enterprises, with benefits filtering to the wider population through increased employment \ngeneration. Indicators and the evidence base of effects of lower transaction costs, and improved \naccess to financing of SME will be government agency surveys, competitiveness surveys, and \ncost-of-doing-business  surveys.  The  net  effect  of  reforms  to  the  budget  formulation  and \nexecution  process\u2014through  more \nimproved  cash \nmanagement,  smoother  disbursements  of  capital  expenditures,  and  strengthened  accounting \ncapabilities in line ministries\u2014is to improve budget allocations and operational efficiency with a \npossible  increase  in  local  service  outlays,  and  reduction  in  corruption.  This  is  likely  to  be \nenhanced  in  the  medium  to  longer  term,  with  the  progression  toward  medium-term  and \nperformance budgeting, especially after full adoption of the MTEF approach in the next 5-year \nplan.  Increases  in  the  2008  PNPM  are  expected  to  have  a  more  immediate  effect  through \nincreased  block  grant  transfers  for  subdistrict-led  community  development  projects,  while \ninstitutionalizing  poverty  program  evaluations  and  assessments  would  lead  to  increased  and \nbetter targeted programs in the near to medium term. Increasing the number of teaching hours \nby  qualified  teachers  could  have  potential  long-term  impacts,  to  the  extent  that  it  increases \neducational  outcomes\u2014indicators  and  the  evidence  base  are  public  expenditure  reviews,  civil \nservice performance reviews, and benefit incidence surveys.  From a distribution point of view, \nthe  programs\u2019  near-term  impact  on  the  poor  will  be  realized  mostly  through  the  2008  PNPM \nblock  grant  increases,  while  improved  service  access  and  delivery  for  poorer  groups  will  be \nrealized over the medium to longer term. \n \n95. \nResettlement,  Indigenous  People,  and  Environment. Implementation of the DPSP-4 \nmeasures will cause no direct or indirect involuntary resettlement, nor will it lead to any issues \naffecting  indigenous  peoples.  Based  on  desk  review,  the  measures  supported  under  the        \nDPSP-4 are unlikely to have any adverse environmental impacts. \n\nB. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nImplementation of the DPSP cluster is subject to the following risks: \n\n96. \n \n\n(i) \n\nExternal  vulnerabilities.  With  improvements  in  its  macroeconomic  indicators, \nIndonesia\u2019s  resilience  to  external  shocks  has  increased.  Factors  limiting  the \npotential impacts of external shocks include diversity of exports, limited external \ndebt  exposure,  and  an  adequate  level  of  reserves.  The  banking  sector  is  also \nnow sufficiently strong to weather a moderate external shock. The maintenance \nof a financial sector safety net supported by the DPL/DPSP will help to improve \nthe  resilience  of  the  banking  sector.  Nevertheless,  risks  remain  high,  especially \nduring  a  period  of  global  financial  turmoil.  Indonesia  is  a  financially  open \neconomy and there are significant foreign holdings, especially in the stock market \nand government bonds. Indonesia is thus vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor \nsentiment. If significant funds are pulled back because of liquidity demands in the \nUS  and  elsewhere  and/or  increased  emerging  market  risk  aversion,  this  could \nlead to increased pressure on domestic interest and exchange rates. In addition, \nthe  Government  has  large  gross  financing  needs  over  the  next  few  years,  and \ntighter  credit  markets  and  increased  risk  aversion  could  limit  the  Government\u2019s \nability to tap international financial markets. This could force the Government to \ncut budgetary outlays to maintain fiscal balance, with adverse consequences for \ninfrastructure  and  social  expenditure.  Mitigating  these  risks  will  require  solid \ncooperation  between  Bank  Indonesia  and  the  economic  ministries  to  reassure \n\n33 \n\n \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nbondholders  that  their  investments  are  safe  (from  inflation  and  exchange \nmovements) while crowding in private investment to the extent possible through \nthe kinds of structural reforms supported by the DPL/DPSP. \nSubsidies. As international oil prices decline, subsides also fall but they remain \na  key  risk  as  commodity  price  reversions  also  remain  possible.  There  remain \nsignificant  subsidies  on  fuel  and  electricity  in  Indonesia,  despite  the  increase  in \nadministered  fuel  prices  in  May  2008.  Fixed  fuel  prices  and  the  subsidies  they \ncreate represent a threat to fiscal sustainability in the longer term (not to mention \ntheir  opportunity  cost,  regressivity,  and  that  they  do  not  promote  efficiency). \nWhile a plan to move to market prices would be best, this is on hold until after the \nelection in 2009. In the meantime, there are ongoing efforts to reduce subsidies \nin other ways. \nFiduciary constraints. Notwithstanding the improvements under way, there are \ncontinuing  concerns  regarding  utilization  of  public  resources.  The  overall \nfiduciary  assessments  undertaken  since  2001  (with  the  country  financial \naccountability  assessment)  have  indicated  considerable  improvements  in  the \noverall  fiduciary  environment  in  Indonesia.  Ongoing  programs  supported  by \nseveral  development  partners  provide  significant  TA  support  to  strengthen \nfocus  on  strengthening  budget \nfiduciary  governance.  The  DPL/DPSP \npreparation,  execution,  and \nfinancial  management  will \nsignificantly enhance transparency. \nThe  2009  legislative  and  presidential  elections.  Although  the  Government \nremains committed to sustaining its economic reform agenda despite the global \neconomic slowdown and general elections next year, elections often reduce the \ntime horizons of politicians, leading them to avoid new policy initiatives in the pre-\nelection  period  and  shifting  their  focus  to  populist  short-term  measures.  This \ncould undermine the reform agenda contained in the DPSP-4. There is, however, \nalso  the  possibility  of  a  countervailing  tendency  where  the  prospect  of \napproaching elections spurs political entrepreneurs into more clearly establishing \nreform credentials and recording clear accomplishments. \nHeightened  security  risks.  Alerts  stemming  from  sectarian  and  regional \nconflicts  and  terrorism  could  slow  foreign  direct  investment  and  set  back  the \nrecovering  tourism  industry.  The  Government  and  law  enforcement  authorities \nhave  taken  a  range  of  measures  aimed  at  rebuilding  public  and  investor \nconfidence. \n\ntransparency \n\nin \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n97. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nCounterpart  funds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  development  needs  as  outlined \nunder DPSP-4 implementation arrangements.  \nThe policies and actions taken prior to the date of the DPSP-4 loan agreement, \nas  described  in  the  development  policy  letter  (including  the  policy  matrix),  will \ncontinue to be in effect for the duration of ADB\u2019s engagement in the DPL series, \nand subsequently. \n\n34 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n98. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$200,000,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for the Fourth Development Policy Support Program \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  term  of  15  years,  including  a \ngrace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n\n \n \n21 November 2008 \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n35 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f36   \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance Targets/Indicators \n\n \nReal GDP growth increased to 6.7% \nin 2012 from 5.0% in 2004 \n \nPoverty level decreased to 12.0% in \n2012 from 16.6% in 2004 \n \nCorruption reduced (to be monitored \nthrough corruption perception surveys \nand cases handled by KPK) \n \n\nImproved investment climate, better \npublic financial management, and \nimproved public service delivery \nachieved by 2010.

Economic  growth \naveraged a substantive 5.6% during 2004\u20132007, the debt\u2013gross domestic product (GDP) ratio \ndeclined nearly 25 percentage points, budget deficits have declined, and high reserves provide \nthe  country  with  a  comfortable  liquidity  cushion.  Increasing  non-oil  and  gas  revenues  as  a \npercentage of GDP were supported by a prior DPL/DPSP action to expand modernization of tax \noffices  and  the  tax  base,  including  to  medium  and  small  taxpayers.  These  taxpayers  are  now \nresponsible  for  the  largest  share  of  Indonesian  taxes.  Additional  reforms  to  improve  tax \nanalysis, including the creation of a Tax Policy Office, are expected to generate improvements \nin revenue collection.  \n \n3. \nOn  the  expenditure  side,  reductions  in  non-targeted  fuel  subsidies  in  2005  allowed \ngreater social spending but untargeted subsidies remain burdensome. In 2005, the Government \nraised fuel prices, resulting in the decline of fuel subsidies from 4% of GDP in 2004 to 2.7% in \n2007, freeing up $10 billion a year. This amount was rolled out into cash transfers targeted at \nthe poor and also higher health and education expenditures. However, as oil prices continued to \nbreak  record  highs  throughout  2008,  fuel  subsidies  rose  sharply,  causing  the  Government  to \nspend  an  additional  Rp50  trillion  (1.2%  of  GDP)  in  the  first  part  of  the  year.  In  May 2008,  the \nGovernment  again  increased  fuel  prices  by  almost  30%  and  accompanied  this  with  a  widely \npublicized and improved cash transfer program. This move, together with the recent reduction in \noil prices, has brought down the projected energy subsidy in 2008 to 4.7% of GDP, which still \nsurpasses both central government capital and social spending by 1.7% of GDP. \n\n \n4. \nRating  agencies  responded  favorably  to  Indonesia\u2019s  lower  debt  ratio  and  reform \npackages. In a reflection of the country\u2019s more sound economic footing, all three credit agencies \nhave raised their credit ratings at least three notches since 2003. Standard and Poor\u2019s upgraded \nIndonesia\u2019s  credit  rating  from  CCC+  in  2003  to  BB\u2013  by  2008;  likewise  in  this  period,  Moody\u2019s \nraised its ratings from B2 to Ba3; and Fitch raised its from B to BB. In supporting their ratings \nupgrades, the agencies cited debt reduction as the primary cause, as well as the Government\u2019s \ncommitment  to  broad-based  reform,  including  changes  to  investment  laws,  customs  and  tax \nreforms,  and  fiscal  reforms,  specifically  in  treasury  and  budget\u2014measures  supported  by  the \nDPL/DPSP series.  \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThe  DPL/DPSP  series  sought  to  improve  the  investment  climate  through  several  key \nentry areas, including regulatory reform, tax, custom and trade reform, financial sector stability, \nand improved access to finance by small and medium-sized enterprises. \n \n6. \nThough  initially  slow  to  pick  up  momentum,  the  Government  has  made  strides  in \nimproving the investment environment. Although full implementation of the investment packages \n\nCore Policy Area 2: Investment Climate \n\n \n\n\f46   \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nlicenses  and  multiple \n\nhas  yet  to  take  place,  initial  signs  are  encouraging\u2014investment  rates  have  risen  from  below \n20%  of  GDP  in  2003  to  25%  in  2007.  In  2006,  the  Government  issued  three  economic  policy \npackages  covering  investment  climate,  infrastructure,  and  financial  reform.  In  2007,  a \ncomprehensive  follow-up  package  was  issued  detailing  168  specific  reform  measures  to  be \ncarried out. As a result, business perceptions have improved. A study of manufacturing firms in \nmid-2007  indicated  improvements  in  value-added  tax  (VAT)  refunds,  tax  filing  processes, \ninformal  payments,  and  faster  import  and  custom  clearance.  Labor  issues  and  infrastructure \nhave now replaced consistency of regulation as the key constraint to doing business. Surveys of \nforeign  investors  also  show  that  perceptions  of  Indonesia  are  improving.  In  Japan\u2019s  annual \nJapan  Bank  of  International  Cooperation  survey  of  600  Japanese  multinational  companies, \nIndonesia was ranked the eighth most promising country for overseas business.  \n \nRegulatory  reforms  supported  by  the  DPL/DPSP  process,  particularly  those  relating  to \n7. \nsimplifying  and  eliminating  unnecessary  business \nregistration \nrequirements,  have  led  to  more  streamlined  procedures  supportive  of  the  investment  climate. \nAccording  to  Doing  Business  2009,  the  time  to  set  up  a  business  has  fallen  significantly  from \n168 days in 2003 to 105 days in 2007, and 76 days in 2008. Another key achievement was the \npassage  of  the  Investment  Law,  which  clarified  previously  arbitrary  investment  rules.  The  law \nfocuses on equal treatment of foreign and domestic investment, removes the forced divestment \nand limited duration of foreign investment in the old law, lengthens the time horizon to hold land, \nliberalizes some immigration procedures, and allows for international arbitration.  \n \n8. \nTax  reform  has  addressed  some  of  the  key  complaints  from  the  business  community. \nReforms  in  tax  administration  have  halved  the  time  for  VAT  refunds;  in  addition,  more  than \nRp10 trillion (roughly $1 billion) in outstanding VAT refunds have been settled. New procedures \nhave  been  set  in  place  to  issue  VAT  refunds  to  export  companies  within  set  time  frames. \nStandard  operation  procedures  for  a  complaint  management  system  have  been  issued.  The \nDPL/DPSP  has  also  supported  the  issuance  of  a  decree  on  tax  audit  procedures  that  allows \ntaxpayers to delay payment of tax assessments from disputed audits. However, this decree only \nbecomes effective for disputes over 2008 assessments and forward, leaving those with current \ndisputes under the old rule. \n \nSignificant  progress  on  trade  and  customs  reform  has  been  made  with  pilot  testing  of \n9. \nIndonesia\u2019s  national  single  window  (NSW)  and  paperless  import  clearance.  Implementation  of \nthe  NSW  is  one  of  the  country\u2019s  most  important  trade  facilitation  initiatives.  Under  a  single \nwindow,  exporters  and  importers  will  no  longer  be  required  to  apply  individually  to  multiple \nagencies\u2014significantly reducing the number of days it takes to export and import goods. A pilot \nproject is under way in Jakarta\u2019s main port and will be expanded to other ports in preparation for \nthe establishment of an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) single window. Other \ntrade  reforms  sought  by  the  DPL  aimed  to  improve  the  technical  capacity  of  the  tariff  team  in \nsetting and evaluating tariff changes and nontariff barriers imposed by line ministries. \n \n10. \nThe original objectives of the DPL/DPSP series were to strengthen the financial sector \nby  reducing  the  role  of  state-owned  banks  and  increasing  the  share  of  financial  assets  at \nnonbank financial institutions. The share of state-owned banks in the banking system (36% in \nJune 2008) was a significant 10 percentage point decrease since 2003, indicating the increasing \nrole  of  private  banks  in  the  sector.  Less  progress  was  made  on  the  nonbank  financial \ninstitutions\u2014their  share  of  19.9%  of  total  financial  sector  assets  in  March  2008  was  little \nimproved from the 17.4% share of 2005. However, other indicators point to a healthier financial \nsystem\u2014 profitability ratios such as net interest margin, return on assets, and return on equity \nremain strong. Nonperforming loans, particularly in state-owned banks have been substantially \n\n \n\n\fAppendix  3 \n\n47 \n\nCore Policy Area 3: Public Financial Management and Governance \n\nreduced after peaking in 2005. In terms of diversification, small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SME)  lending  has  been  rising  rapidly  and  now  accounts  for  a  majority  share  of  the  lending \nportfolio.  \n \nIn  strengthening  the  stability  of  the  financial  sector,  the  DPL/DPSP  supported  the \n11. \nimplementation  of  a  sounder  financial  safety  net.  At  the  start  of  the  DPL  series,  there  was  a \nneed to reduce the economic distortion and potential moral hazard caused by the then existing \nblanket guarantee, which had been introduced during the Asian crisis to stem bank runs. To this \neffect,  the  DPL/DPSP  series  supported  a  number  of  reforms,  including  a  deposit  insurance \nscheme,  institutionalizing  Bank  Indonesia\u2019s  role  as  lender  of  last  resort,  and  establishing \ninstitutional  processes  and  mechanisms  for  resolving  troubled  banks.  By  the  end  of  the        \nDPL-4/DPSP-3,  coverage  on  deposits  was  reduced  from  a  blanket  guarantee  in  2003  to \nRp100 million by 2007. Indonesia is one of the few countries in the world that has removed its \nblanket guarantee on schedule. \n \nC. \n \n12. \nTo  improve  the  efficiency,  transparency,  and  accountability  of  public  finances,  the \nDPL/DPSP  series  focused  on  three  key  areas  of  reform:  (i)  modernizing  public  financial \nmanagement  systems,  (ii)  strengthening  institutional  reform  within  the  Ministry  of  Finance \n(MOF), and more recently (iii) civil service reform.  \n \n13. \nChanges in the legal and regulatory architecture for public financial management (PFM) \nare now largely complete and the focus is on implementing a modern PFM system. Before the \nstart  of  the  DPL/DPSP  series,  the  Government\u2019s  financial  operations  were  based  on  outdated \nlaws (from 1925) that had been updated with a series of inadequate decrees. The previous PFM \nsystem  allowed  for  systematic  and  pervasive  corruption,  collusion,  and  nepotism  because \nassignments  were  unclear,  transparency  was  low,  and  enforcement  poor.  Budget  formulation \nwas opaque and inefficient, making it difficult to quantify basic concepts of the budget. Budget \nexecution was often delayed and monitoring arrangements were weak. Procurement processes \nwere  prone  to  corruption  and  collusion.  Accounting  and  reporting  were  fragmented  and  not \nalways  reliable,  and  mandates  of  government  audit  bodies  were  not  clearly  defined.  The  DPL \nsupported  various  regulatory  measures  needed  to  create the  regulatory  framework  for  a  more \nmodern PFM system, in the areas of budget preparation and execution.  \n \n14. \nA  key  achievement  under  the  DPL/DPSP  has  been  the  implementation  of  the  treasury \nsingle account (TSA) to improve cash management of public finances. At the start of the DPL \nseries,  more  than  18,000  commercial  bank  accounts\u2014and  other  accounts  not  even  known  to \nthe  Treasury\u2014handled  government  funds.  As  an  initial  step,  the  DPL-1  supported  addressing \nthe  regulatory  deficiencies  in  the  PFM  system,  including  the  passage  of  several  laws  defining \nthe regulatory framework. Reorganization of MOF was also carried out to begin the process of \nestablishing a TSA, and to clean up the cash management issues the Government faced. The \nDPL-2/DPSP-1  then  supported  the  implementing  regulations  underlining  these  laws  and \nadopted an implementation plan. The DPL-3/DPSP-2 pilot tested the TSA to have zero-balance \naccounts in over 50 provincial treasury offices (KPPNs). The DPL-4/DPSP-3 extended the TSA \ncoverage  to  nearly  full  implementation  on  government  expenditure  accounts.  Although  there \nwere some timing issues (e.g., training for local agencies to implement the TSA came after the \nrequirement to do so), the push to meet the deadline of the DPL accelerated implementation of \nthe  TSA.  Progress  on  covering  revenue  accounts  has  been  more  complicated,  but  has \ncommenced. \n \n\n \n\n\f48   \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nBudgeting  procedures  have \n\nimproved  but  execution  remains  problematic.  The \n15. \nDPL/DPSP  has  helped  move  forward  reforms  to  reengineer  business  processes  across  the \nbudget cycle. The national budget is now compatible with the international standard government \nfinancial  statistics  (GFS)  classification.  Fiscal  reporting  is  more  comprehensive  and  timely. \nElements  of  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework  have  been  introduced,  though  not  fully \noperational  in  the  budget  system.  Whereas  the  planning  and  reporting  side  of  the  budget \nprocess  has  improved,  executing  the  budget  has  remained  weak,  with  about  50%  of  capital \nexpenditure being spent in the last quarter.  \n \n16. \nProcurement  reform,  though  slow  to  take  off,  now  has  the  potential  to  exceed  original \nexpectations. The original trigger aimed only at strengthening the existing National Procurement \nOffice. Instead, the Government has made it into an independent office responsible directly to \nthe  President.  As  an  independent  agency  with  adequate  resources,  authority,  and  strong \npolitical  backing,  it  will  be  in  a  stronger  position  to  drive  public  procurement  reform.  However, \nbecause of the lag in strengthening the National Public Procurement Office (LKPP), there was a \nlack  of  progress  on  other  procurement  reforms,  especially  in  developing  a  comprehensive \nnational  public  sector  procurement  law.  This  law  is  needed  to  address  the  numerous \ninconsistencies resulting from decentralization reforms, which have enabled various government \nlevels to issue their own procurement procedures. Other deficiencies of the system include slow \nprogress  in  the  passage  of  regulations,  and  the  adoption  of  standard  tools  such  as  bidding \ndocuments and user manuals. \n \n17. \nInitial  steps to  address civil  service  reform  have  been  launched.  Lack of  administrative \ncapacity  and  distorted  incentives  in  government  bureaucracy  have  constrained  policy \nimplementation  as  well  as  delivery  of  public  services.  As  an  initial  step  to  reform  the  civil \nservice, the DPL/DPSP supported development of a comprehensive reform of the structure and \nremuneration framework for high-ranking state officials. A task force was set up to examine the \nentire  compensation  package  with  the  goal  of  creating  a  more  transparent,  systematic,  and \ncoherent framework for pay and allowances based on a comprehensive job evaluation and pay \ngrading.  Building  on  this,  MOF  has  developed  a  comprehensive  civil  service  reform  plan  and \naction plan for itself, which is now being pilot-tested to other agencies.  \n \nD. \n \n18. \nThe  groundwork  for  improving  poverty  targeting  of  basic  services  has  been  initiated. \nPrior  to  the  2005  fuel  prices  rise,  Indonesia\u2019s  social  protection  system  was  characterized  by \nemergency  short-term  safety  net  programs  and  price  subsidies.  The  country\u2019s  three  targeted \nprograms  accounted  for  less  than  0.5%  of  GDP,  compared  to  almost  4.0%  of  GDP  for  the \nuntargeted fuel subsides, of which less than 0.2% of GDP went to the poorest quintile. As the \nfuel  price  hike  made  available  more  funds  for  social  spending,  the  DPL  supported  building \ncapacity to create a more evaluative institutional framework that would improve the targeting of \nthese released funds. The 2005 fuel hike was accompanied by a new cash transfer program to \nhelp  alleviate  the  impact  on  the  poorest  households\u2014representing  a substantial shift  from  the \nineffective and inefficient general subsidy program. Evaluative assessments were conducted to \nimprove  targeting  and  performance  of  the  cash  transfer  program,  and  the  lessons  were \nincorporated  into  the  new  cash  transfer  program  that  accompanied  the  May  2008  fuel  price \nincrease.  The  Government  has  undertaken  significant  steps  to  set  up  an  effective  and \ncomprehensive  monitoring  and  evaluation  function,  including  the  establishment  of  a  unit  to \nundertake performance evaluations, with the intent of having the findings used as an input to the \nGovernment\u2019s planning and budgeting cycle. \n\nCore Policy Area 4: Improved Delivery of Public Services \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n49\n\n \n\nLETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n51\n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nPOLICY MATRIX FOR THE FOURTH DEVELOPMENT POLICY SUPPORT PROGRAM \n\nStatus as of the end of October 2008 \n\nDPSP-4 Policy Measures \n\nCore Policy Area I: Improved Investment Climate \n\nA. Regulatory Reform \n1. PEPI to coordinate the development of \nimplementing regulations and technical guidelines for \neffective implementation of the Investment Law by \nundertaking a review of the negative list (Presidential \nRegulation No. 77/2007), and overseeing compilation \nof a mapping of business licenses in key economic \nsectors with recommendations for specific licenses to \nbe streamlined or eliminated. \n\n2. Increase the ability to monitor the investment \nclimate by: (i) posting publicly, average processing \ntime for VAT refunds; (ii) making available data on \nthe time taken to establish a company from reserving \nthe name to issuing the legalization decree; and (iii) \ndesigning a system to monitor and report on import \nclearance time from unloading to gate-out combining \ndata from the Port Operator and Customs. \nB. Tax and Customs Reform \n\n3. Continue to implement the NSW, including \nincreasing the number of participating agencies and \ncompanies.  Extend the original pilot.  \n\n4. Issue implementing regulations for the Tax \nAdministration Law and instructions to tax offices. \nEstablish a system to monitor and report on response \ntime for tax audit objections and appeals.  \n\nSatisfactory. PEPI has completed a review of the Investment Negative List to clarify and enhance the \neffective implementation of the Investment Law and issued a revised Investment Negative List as \nPresidential Regulation 111/2007 in December 2007.  A tender has been issued for a study of sectoral \ninvestment regulations that will support a mapping of business licenses, and funds have been earmarked \nfor this purpose. \n\nAchieved. Directorate General of Taxes (DG Tax) has already published on its website the average \nprocessing time for a number of taxpayer services including VAT refunds (broken down by taxpayer risk \ncategories: low, medium, and high). Pursuant to DG Tax Circular Letter 19/PJ/2008, this data will be \nupdated quarterly as part of the tax office key performance indicators. The Ministry of Justice has made \navailable data from its SISMINBAKUN database on the time to establish a company from reserving the \nname to issuing the legalization decree, and customs department has designed a new data system known \nas TPS online that will combine customs data with data from terminal operators.   \n\nAchieved. Considerable progress has been made in developing the NSW, including increasing the number \nof participating agencies from 5 to 15, and increasing the number of participating companies using the NSW \nfrom 100 to 148.  The original pilot has now been extended from Jakarta\u2019s Tanjung Priok seaport to three \nother seaports plus the Jakarta airport.  The target date for determining the operational model for the NSW \nas  stipulated  in  Presidential  Instruction  5/2008  is  December  2008,  which  is  critical  for  the  next  stage  of \nimplementation. \n \nExceeded.  As  of  September  2008  all  implementing  regulations  (PMK  No.  181/PMK.03/2007  to  PMK  No. \n202/PMK.03/2007)  for  the  Tax  Administration  Law  had  been  posted  on  DG  Tax  website.  DG  Tax  has \npublished  on  its  website  the  average  processing  time  for  each  of  the  eight  major  taxpayer  services, \nincluding taxpayer registration, VAT refund (broken down by taxpayer risk levels: low, medium, and high), \ntax  objections,  exemption  of  withholding  tax  on  imports,  and  property  tax  relief.    Pursuant  to  DG  Tax \nCircular  Letter  19/PJ/2008,  this  information  will  be  updated  quarterly  as  part  of  the  tax  office  key \nperformance indicators. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n5\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5\n3\n \n\n \n\n\fDPSP-4 Policy Measures \n5. Continue the tariff harmonization program and \nimplement effective and transparent operating \nprocedures, including public disclosure. \n\nC. Strengthen Financial Sector \n6. Issue a government decree specifying a higher \ncapital requirement for insurance companies. \n\nD. Strengthen Small Business \n7. Rationalize SME financing/microfinance schemes \nacross line ministries and SOEs, including issuing a \npresidential decree on the legal establishment of \nprovincial credit guarantee and re-guarantee \ninstitutions. \n\nStatus as of the end of October 2008 \nAchieved. The 2008 tariff harmonization target for import duty and goods classification system have been \nmet.    The  Ministry  of  Finance  has  renewed  the  mandate  of  Tim  Tarif  and  has  introduced  a  ministerial \ndecree  (KMK  285/KMK.011/2007)  specifying  standard  operating  procedures  for  acting  on  requests  for \nanalyzing tariff proposals. \n \n\nAchieved. Government Regulation No.39/2008 was issued on May 19, 2008, requiring insurance \ncompanies to meet higher capital requirements progressively by December 31 2010 \n \n\nAchieved. In October 2007 the Government initiated the signing of an MOU with 6 banks, 6 line ministries \nand 2 credit guarantees companies that led to the rationalization of micro and small and medium enterprise \nfinancing schemes of line ministries into a unified partially guaranteed credit  scheme, Kredit Usaha Rakyat, \nwhich has grown substantially.  Presidential Regulation 2/2008 was also issued in January 2008 to provide \na legal basis for the establishment of provincial credit guarantee and re-guarantee companies. \n\n5\n4\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n5\n \n\ni\n\nCore Policy Area II: Improved Public Financial Management and Governance \n\nE. Strengthen budgeting, controls, transparency, in financial management \n8. Make further progress towards establishing a \ncomprehensive TSA regime, including revenue \naccounts. Establish a counterpart team to implement \nthe new automated treasury system, and begin \nmapping and reviewing of business processes to \nincrease readiness for system roll out in 2009.  \nModernize 30 provincial treasury offices (KPPNs). \n \n9. Enhance performance-based budgeting by \ninitiating a review and revision of the existing program \nstructure to increase accountability, revise the budget \nsubmission templates (for RKA-KL), draft \naccompanying budget preparation manuals, and draft \nkey performance indicators for the Ministry of \nFinance. \n10. All DIPAs are issued and teams assigned at the \nbeginning of the fiscal year, by eliminating annual SK \nrequirement (for project managers) for multi-year \nprojects and allowing for parallel processing of \nprocurement. \n\nAchieved.    TSA  roll  out  to  revenue  accounts  is  being  pilot-tested.    A  counterpart  team  to  implement  the \nnew  automated treasury system has been appointed.   The mapping and reviewing of business processes \nhas commenced. 33 provincial treasury offices have been modernized, exceeding the trigger requirement. \n \n\nAchieved.  The Government\u2019s program structure for budgeting purposes is being revised to enhance \naccountability, by aligning budgeted programs with Government\u2019s organizational structure.  The budget \nsubmission templates have been revised, accompanying MTEF/PBB manuals and key performance \nindicators for the Ministry of Finance have been drafted and are under review.   \n \n\nAchieved. DIPAs for the 2008 budget were issued on 2 January 2008.  DG Treasury has prepared a new \nregulation to accept the names of key official of Satkers listed in the DIPA as the legally authorized budget \nusers  of  the  Sakters,  obviating  the  need  for  issuing  annual  surat  keputusans  reappointing  key  Satker \nofficials.  While procurements can be legally initiated after the adoption of the state budget in October of the \npreceding  fiscal  year,  this  practice  is  not  widely  adopted  due  to  a  number  of  reasons  including,  a  lack  of \nknowledge of this fact, as well as a lack of operating expenses to cover procurement related costs. LKPP \nhas issued a circular clarifying that parallel processing of procurement is permitted and provided guidelines \non how to do so.  The Treasury has drafted an action plan to level out disbursements of capital and material \nexpenditures over the fiscal year. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDPSP-4 Policy Measures \n\n11. Complete a midterm review to assess the \napplication of accounting standards and accounting \nprocedure manuals by line ministries.  \n\nF. Improve procurement processes and outcomes \n\n12. Make the newly established LKPP operational by \nrecruiting staff and allocating budget for operational \ncosts, and revise Presidential Decree No. 80/2003 to, \namong others, accommodate a new set of standard \nbidding documents. \n\nG. Initiate civil service reform \n\n13. Expand civil service reform pilot to five additional \nagencies in 2008. Update MOF organizational road \nmap and implement next phase of the Ministry\u2019s \nhuman resource management strategy \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStatus as of the end of October 2008 \n\nExceeded. A midterm review has been completed and revised accounting procedures have been issued.  \nFinance Minister Regulation No 171/PMK.05/2007 on Accounting System for Line Ministries was issued in \nDecember 2007 replacing PMK 59/PMK.05/2005 on the Central Government Accounting System.  The new \nregulation includes an emphasis on line ministries being responsible for recording their budget allotment, \nand the recording of receivables, payables, and investments in line ministry financial statements.  These \nchanges represent a move towards full accrual accounting.  The capacity constraints in the line ministries \nare being addressed through training of staff on these changes and accounting issues generally.  The target \nis to train over 7,000 accounting staff in line ministries, with 3,185 persons trained to date. \n\nSatisfactory. The staffing of the LKPP, which was established by presidential decree in December 2007 is \nongoing. The six most critical positions have already been filled and recruitment is ongoing for lower level \npositions. Work on consolidating and simplifying Presidential Decree 80/2003 is ongoing.  First phase would \nbe to compile the presidential decree and all subsequent amendments under one document.  The next step \nis to prepare an operational manual that will be complemented by the set of standard bidding documents.  \nFirst phase has been completed while the 2nd phase is ongoing.   \n\nSatisfactory.  The  five  agencies  involved  in  the  pilot  are  BPK,  KPK,  MenPAN,  MOF  and  Supreme  Court. \nThe roll out is now led and coordinated by MenPAN within the National Committee for Bureaucracy Reform. \nThe  MOF,  Supreme  Court  and  BPK  have  received  additional  budgets  to  cover  new  allocations.    The \nMinistry  of  Finance  is  continuing  to  implement  its  HRM  strategy.  New  job  descriptions  and  a  new  grading \nsystem  have  been  developed  and  all  positions  have  been  allocated  to  one  of  27  new  grades.  A  new \nrecruitment  process  based  on  announced  vacancies,  competitive  selection,  and  merit  is  now  being \nimplemented,  and  will  be  supported  by  an  Assessment  Center.    MOF  has  also  initiated  development  of  a \nhuman  resource  information  system.    The  previously  introduced  road  map  development  of  MOF  is  to  be \nreplaced by a law on MOF.  KPK\u2019s role is mainly to monitor reform progress in the other institutions as KPK \nis exempt from the civil service scheme and not in need of similar reforms. MenPAN has yet to implement \nsimilar reforms. \n \n\nCore Policy Area III: Improved Public Service Delivery \nH. Strengthen effectiveness of pro-poor targeting of public programs  \n\n14. Institutionalized a government system for \nprogram evaluation by appointing a deputy for \nperformance evaluation within Bappenas with three \ndirectors responsible, respectively, for sector \nevaluation, regional evaluation, and systems and \nreporting of development performance.  \n\n15. Improve effectiveness in subnational spending by \nissuing guidelines for pro-poor budgeting and \nplanning for local governments.  \n\nAchieved.  The  Government  has  institutionalized  a  system  for  program  evaluation  and  assessment  by \ncreating  the  deputy  for  performance  evaluation  (DPE)  within  Bappenas,  with  three  directors  focusing  on \nsectoral evaluation, regional evaluation, and systems and reporting of development performance. The work \nprogram  and  staffing  plans  of  the  DPE  is  being  developed.  The  DPE  is  working  with  other  departments \nwithin Bappenas and the Ministry of Finance to prepare a new program structure more conducive towards \nevaluating performance under the new Medium-Term Development Plan (2010\u20142014). \n \n\nAchieved. A pro-poor planning and budgeting handbook has been prepared, and Bappenas held a national \nworkshop in late July to disseminate the findings of the handbook.  Bappenas has distributed the handbook \nto 400 local governments, and uploaded it on its website. \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n5\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5\n5\n \n\n \n\n\fDPSP-4 Policy Measures \nI.

Increase the community block grant of PNPM to \nmaximize employment and poverty impacts. \n\nAchieved. The block grant amount has been adjusted from about Rp. 1.5 billion on average to Rupiah 1.8 \nbillion  in  2008.    Government  is  now  planning  for  what  increases  will  take  place  for  2009.  Studies  have \nshown  that  the  program  is  less  effective  in  richer  villages,  which  already  have  more  infrastructure.    The \nGovernment  has  indicated  its  commitment  to  think  through  the  size  of  block  grants  for  poorer  areas  vs. \nricher ones in the 2009 budget. \n \nAchieved.    The  Ministry  of  National  Education  has  issued  Ministerial  Decree  No.  18/2007  requiring  all \nteachers to deliver 24 teaching-hours per  week in order to receive the  professional allowance for certified \nteachers.    In  addition,  teachers  receiving  the  special  area  allowance  are  required  to  fulfill  the  24  teaching \nhour  requirement.

This  appendix  summarizes  the  current \nstate  of  these  systems  and  the  ongoing  reforms,  with  a  view  to  assessing  the  fiduciary  risks \nrelating  to  the  proceeds  of  this  Development  Policy  Loan  (DPL)  and  Development  Policy \nSupport Program (DPSP). \n \n2. \nIndonesia  have  strengths  and \nweaknesses. Strengths include a sound regulatory framework across most parts of the budget \ncycle; an orderly, transparent, and predictable budget formulation process; fund predictability for \nbudget  execution;  sound  budget  classification;  comprehensive  and  transparent  budget \ndocumentation;  government  accounting  standards  aligned  with  comparable  international \nstandards; a chart of accounts that is broadly consistent with the Government Finance Statistics \nManual (GFSM 2001); and a strengthened external audit institution.  \n \n3. \nThese strong points are the result of a concerted reform effort among key stakeholders \nto the budget process since the political transition in 1998. These efforts were given momentum \nand direction in the 2001 white paper on PFM reform. \n \n4. \nDPLs  1\u20134  and  DPSP  1\u20133  have  had  public  financial  management  as  an  area  of  focus \nand  have  contributed  to  some  of  the  significant  improvements  made  in  the  last  few  years. \nDetails of results achieved in the DPL process are discussed in Appendix 3 under core policy \narea 3.  \n \nKey stakeholders to the budget process remain committed to further reform through an \n5. \nevolving  and  pragmatic  reform  agenda.  The  focus  of  government  reform  is  on  the \nimplementation of an integrated financial management information system, further unification of \nthe budget, further improvement of the chart of accounts, restructuring of budget programs, the \nintroduction  of  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework  (MTEF)  and  performance-based \nbudgeting,  a  full  rollout  of  the  treasury  single  account  (TSA),  improvement  of  the  institutional \nand  regulatory  framework  for  procurement,  improvements  to  cash  and  asset  management, \ninternal controls, and internal and external audit.  \n \n6. \nThe  assessment  draws  on  recent  economic  and  sector  work  undertaken  by  the  World \nBank,  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  and  other  development  partners.  A  public expenditure \nand  financial  accountability  assessment  was  concluded  in  June  2008.  In  addition,  this \nassessment  has  taken  into  account  the  findings  of  a  joint  World  Bank\u2013IMF  mission  on \nstrengthening  budget  management  undertaken  in  June  2008,  the  results  of  a  previous  joint \nWorld Bank\u2014IMF mission on budget reform priorities reported to the Government in June 2007, \nthe  September  2008  update  of  the  Report  on  Observance  of  Standards  and  Codes  on  Fiscal \nTransparency in Indonesia from 20061 and an ADB sector report on accountability and audit in \n\n                                                 \n \n1 IMF. 2006.

However, problems in budget execution persist with 50% of the capital \nexpenditure  still  being  spent  in  the  last  quarter.  The  Treasury  has  conducted  a  survey  of  the \nimpediments to the disbursement of budgetary funds through questionnaires. The results of the \nsurvey  are  being  reviewed  and  will  form  the  basis  of  an  action  plan  to  smooth  out \ndisbursements during the fiscal year.  \n \n8. \nImplementation  of  a  TSA,  as  foreseen  by  State  Treasury  Law  No.  1/2004,  is  ongoing. \nThe Treasury, in cooperation with Bank Indonesia, is pilot testing the daily sweep of government \nrevenue  deposits  from  collecting  branches  and  post  offices  into  the  TSA.  Depending  on  the \nsuccess of the pilot, the daily sweep will be extended to all commercial bank branches starting \nin  January  2009.  The  public  procurement  environment  has  improved  in  the  last  few  years  but \nthere  are  still  weaknesses  in  its  regulatory  and  implementation  aspects.  Presidential  Decree \nNo. 106/2007  was  signed  in  December  2007,  establishing  the  National  Public  Procurement \nOffice (LKPP) an independent agency responsible for planning and development of strategies, \npolicies,  and  regulations  associated  with  procurement  using  public  funds.  Making  the  newly \nestablished LKPP operational by recruiting staff and allocating budget is a priority.  \n \n9. \nThe  government  accounting  standards  are  well  aligned  with  comparable  international \nstandards (IPSAs). The chart of accounts is broadly consistent with GFSM 2001. The aggregate \ngovernment  annual  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  a  timely  manner  for  4  years. \nHowever,  there  are  reliability  questions.  The  Supreme  Audit  Agency  (BPK)  has  for  the  last \n4 years  issued  a  disclaimer  opinion  on  these  financial  statements,  citing  reasons  such  as \ninternal  control  weaknesses  in  the  preparation  of  the  financial  statements  and  instances  of \nnoncompliance with applicable regulations.  \n \n10. \nThe Government\u2019s internal audit framework is extensive but the institutional structure is \ncomplex.  Government  Regulation  No.  60/2008  on  government  internal  controls  defines  more \nclearly  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  different  players  in  internal  audit.  The  overall  internal \ncontrol framework continues to be weak, with paper-intensive processes and inefficient use of \nhuman  resources.  The  Government  is  preparing  for  the  implementation  of  an  integrated \nfinancial  management  system  (SPAN)  to  replace  the  multitude  of  financial  data  processing \napplications currently used by government institutions.  \n \n11. \nBPK has received a significant increase in its operating budget to fund an increase in the \nnumber  of  auditors  as  well  as  regional  offices.  The  audit  report  on  the  financial  statements  is \n                                                 \n \n2 ADB. 2007. Sector Report on Accountability and Audit in Indonesia.

A  peer  review  of  BPK  was \ncompleted in 2004 and revealed serious weaknesses in capacity. Since then, improvements are \ngradually being made to the organization, with new hires and training. BPK has a follow-up peer \nreview planned for FY2009.  \n \n12. \nPowerful  independent  oversight  and  prosecutorial  institutions  such  as  the  Corruption \nEradication  Commission  (KPK)  and  the  Anti-Corruption  Court  have  begun  to  deliver  tangible \nresults.  High-profile  corruption  investigations  have  been  launched,  leading  to  a  number  of \nsuccessful prosecutions.  \n \n13. \nParliamentary  oversight  of  budget  processes  has  been  strengthened.  Parliamentary \ncommissions  have  become  particularly  active  in  scrutinizing  and  amending  the  Government\u2019s \ndraft  annual  budget.  The  Government  published  an  IMF  fiscal  transparency  report  and \nundertook  its  socialization  throughout  Indonesia.  The  public  availability  of  fiscal  information  is \nimproving and the Government published a fiscal risk statement together with the 2008 budget.  \n \nThese reforms directly influence the environment in which public expenditure is planned, \n14. \nbudgeted,  executed,  and  accounted  for  across  all  levels  of  government.  A  more  detailed \ncommentary on progress in implementing these reforms is given in this Appendix below to help \nidentify the risks arising from the Government\u2019s capacity to manage this loan and determine the \nfiduciary arrangements for this operation.  \n \nC. \n \nFiscal  relationships  between  the  executive  and  legislature  are  defined  in  the  State \n15. \nFinance Law No.17/2003. The House of Representatives (DPR) is the main legislative body and \nplays  a  significant  role  in  shaping  the  budget  and  fiscal  policy.  The  budget  is  passed  in \nagreement  between  the  President  and  DPR.  The  process  involves  an  examination  by  DPR  of \nthe  macroeconomic  framework,  macro-fiscal  policies,  and  detailed  budget  allocations.  The \nbudget  has  been  the  centerpiece  of  strengthening  the  legislature  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  executive \nfollowing  political  transitions  after  1998;  the  roles  of  the  executive  and  legislative  branches  in \nthis area are evolving. \n \n16. \nimprovement is explanation of the expenditure implications of new policy initiatives.  \n \nLaws governing budget management clearly specify the responsibilities of the minister of \n17. \nfinance, and comprehensive regulations have been developed. While the President, as head of \nthe  Government,  has  overall  authority  to  exercise  national  fiscal  management,  the  State \nFinance  Law  No.  17/2003  clearly  delegates  the  responsibility  of  overall  fiscal  management  of \ncentral government finances to the minister of finance as chief financial officer. It also assigns \nresponsibilities  to  individual  ministers,  governors,  and  other  local  authorities  for  financial \nmanagement and accountability in their jurisdictions. \n \n18. \nProvisions  of  the  new  regulations  are  being  implemented.  Budget  classification  and \nexecution is based on administrative, economic, and functional classification consistent with the \nClassification of the Functions of Government and GFSM 2001. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) \nis developing plans for an MTEF to guide budget policy. \n \n19. \nForward estimates at the aggregate level were introduced with the 2008 budget and are \nbeing included in the 2009 budget as well. Efforts in the National Development Planning Agency \n\nis  comprehensive.  The  main  outstanding  area  of \n\nThe  budget  documentation \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n63 \n\nReforming Budget Execution \n\n(Bappenas)  and  MOF  are  ongoing  to  redefine  the  budget  program  structure  and  to  develop \ntemplates  and  manuals  for  an  MTEF  and  performance-based  budgeting.  The  efforts  are \nplanned  to  be  piloted  in  the  coming  years.  The  level  of  extra-budgetary  expenditures  is  not \nknown and the issue is not on the reform agenda.  \n \nD. \n \nIndonesia still spends 50% of its total capital expenditure in the final quarter of the year.4 \n20. \nFor the past 6 years, spending has always started slowly and then accelerated toward the end \nof each year. This spending pattern is of concern because project implementation is disrupted \nby an adverse cycle. Moreover, under-spending on capital expenditure constrains increases in \ninfrastructure investment. Slow and back-loaded disbursements are symptoms of more severe \nchallenges that are encountered at each stage of the public expenditure management cycle. \n \n21. \nThe  Government  maintains  a  comparatively  rigid  budget  execution  process.  Detailed \ninput controls aim to ensure that the composition of the budget complies with political priorities \nand  that  the  budget  is  not  altered  during  execution.  Spending  warrants  (DIPAs),  while  now \nissued at the start of the fiscal year, contain excessive amounts of detail leaving little flexibility \nfor adjustments in the composition of inputs needed to carry out a given activity. Reallocations \nacross DIPAs, from delayed programs to better-performing ones that could enhance satisfactory \nimplementation  of  the  overall  expenditure  program,  require  lengthy  revision,  sometimes \ninvolving Parliament. Such inflexibility creates practical difficulties and inefficiencies. \n \n22.  With expanding fiscal space, public investment is increasing, putting additional pressure \non PFM systems. Planning and executing public investment is more demanding than current or \nmandatory expenditure.  \n \nE. \n \n23. \nTransparency  is  still  weakened  by  a  multitude  of  bank  accounts.  Directorate  General \n(DG) Treasury maintains multiple bank accounts, both in rupiah and foreign currency, at Bank \nIndonesia.  External audit reports from 2004 to 2006 noted that about 4,600 bank accounts have \nnot been reported to DG Treasury. By the end of December 2007, MOF completed a census of \nall  government  accounts  and  identified  32,570  accounts.  Subsequently,  2,086  accounts  were \nclosed.  Efforts  are  ongoing  to  determine  which  of  the  remaining  30,484  accounts  can  be \nincluded  in  the  TSA  regime,  either  directly  or  through  a  mechanism  of  daily  sweeps  into  the \nTSA.  \n \n24. \nRegulations associated with Law No. 1/2004 will address this weakness and provide for \n(i) the installation of TSA at Bank Indonesia; (ii) the conversion of operational bank accounts at \ncommercial  banks  into  zero-balance  transit  accounts;  and  (iii)  a  mandatory  review  at  MOF  of \nbank  accounts  of  all  state  agencies  outside  DG  Treasury  oversight,  with  a  view  to  closing  all \nthose that do not serve the public interest. Pilot runs for testing zero-balance arrangements with \ncommercial banks for the expenditure accounts have been successful. The rollout of TSA to the \nrevenue  accounts,  which  was  initially  scheduled  for  the  first  quarter  of  2008,  has  been \npostponed  because  of  pending  negotiations  with  Bank  Indonesia  and  commercial  banks  on \ninterest payment for government balances held at Bank Indonesia and remuneration of banking \nservices  by  the  Government.  The  Treasury  is  pilot  testing  the  daily  sweep  of  government \n\nReforming Treasury, Cash, and Asset Management \n\n                                                 \n \n4 World Bank. 2007. Indonesia Public Expenditure Review 2007: Spending for Development. Washington DC.  \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nrevenue deposits from collecting branches and post offices into the TSA with Bank Indonesia. \nThe  pilot  is  currently  being  tested  in  six  branches  of  six  commercial  banks  and  a  few  post \noffices, and three government treasury offices (KPPNs). Depending on the result of the test, the \ndaily  sweep  is  planned  to  be  extended  to  all  commercial  bank  branches  starting  in  January \n2009. The daily sweep will be with respect to deposits made the previous day, not on the same \nday. This is because the commercial banks have agreed not to charge for this service, provided \nthe sweep is done the following day. This would be a significant improvement compared to the \ncurrent practice, established in 1989, of sweeping the revenue accounts twice a week. \n \n25. \nThe  implementing  regulation  for  Law  No.  1/2004,  Government  Regulation  No.  36/2007 \non  Cash  Management,  was  issued  in  July  2007  detailing  the  governance  and  set-up  of  cash \nmanagement. In addition, a number of MOF regulations (PMK) have been issued to further the \nestablishment of the TSA: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nPMK  57  is  the  generic  PMK  to  regulate  opening  of  bank  accounts  by  the  line \nministries.  \nPMK 58 mandates a census of the existing line ministry accounts.  \nPMK  59  mandates  echelon  I  officers  of  MOF  to  disclose  bank  accounts,  if  any \nare being operated.  \n\n \ntimely  records  of  revenue  and \n26.1  The  cash-based  accounting  system  generates \nexpenditure  transactions,  but  does  not  track  monthly  arrears.  Transaction  records  are \nelectronically  transmitted  to  the  directorate  of  accounts  at  DG  Treasury  headquarters  for \nconsolidation  and  generation  of  periodic  reports  on  budget  execution.  However,  DG  Treasury \nplans to move toward an accrual recording system, which would make this possible. \n \n27.  MOF is preparing the implementation of an integrated financial management system to \nreplace  the  multitude  of  financial  data  processing  applications  currently  used  by  government \ninstitutions.  The  system  is  known  by  the  acronym  SPAN.  It  will  integrate  and  replace  the \nmultiple  software  applications  within  the  Treasury  as  well  as  those  being  implemented  in  the \nDG Budget to support the budget formulation process.  \n \nFollowing  some  delay,  the  second  stage  bidding  process  for  SPAN  was  initiated  in \n28. \nAugust 2008 and the contract for the provision of turnkey services for SPAN is expected to be \nsigned by April 2009. A new management and implementation structure for the project is being \nestablished.  \n \n29. \nGovernment  assets  are  not  comprehensively  recorded,  properly  organized,  and  fairly \nvalued.  An  integrated  and  automated  asset  management  system,  which  will  enable  the \nGovernment to optimize the use of its assets across ministries and regions, will be established \nin 2009. \n \nF. \n \n30. \nthe  public  procurement \nenvironment.  Presidential  Decree  No.  80/2003  provided  a  national  public  procurement \nregulation  that  meets  most  of  what  is  generally  regarded  as  accepted  international  practice, \nincluding  basic  principles:  transparency,  open  and  fair  competition,  economy,  and  efficiency. \nThis decree also requires that a National Public Procurement Office  (LKPP) be established as a \nregulatory  body  for  public  procurement.  With  the  introduction  of  Presidential  Decree  No. \n80/2003, a previous certification (prequalification) process for suppliers and providers of goods \n\nfew  years  have  witnessed \n\nProcurement Reforms \n\nimprovements \n\nThe  past \n\nin \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n65 \n\nand  services  was,  in  most  instances,  abandoned  by  the  Government.  This  previously  led  to \nsegmentation of the market, especially at the provincial level. Presidential Decree No. 80/2003 \nalso established the basis for sanctions, complaint handling, and requirements for certification of \nusers.  \n \n31. \nHowever, the public procurement system still has significant deficiencies in its regulatory \nand, more importantly, implementation aspects. There has been delays in establishing a strong \nregulatory  body;  slow  progress  in  the  development  of  procurement  regulation  anchored  by  a \nlaw;  slow  progress  in  the  development  of  standard  tools  in  terms  of  bidding  documents  and \nusers manuals; weakness in procurement capacity in implementing agencies, especially at the \nprovincial and district levels; and collusion and corruption practices in the bidding process and \nconcerns over the efficiency of anticorruption and sanction measures.  \n \n32. \nThis is supported by the findings of some analytical tools and reports, such as the self-\ndiagnostic  assessment  conducted  by  the  LKPP  in  2007  using  the  baseline  indicators  tool \ndeveloped under the World Bank and OECD Development Assistance Committee procurement \nroundtable  initiative.  The  assessment  of  the  baseline  indicators  presents  a  snapshot \ncomparison  of  the  actual  system  against  the  international  standards  or  the  model  system  that \nthe baseline indicators represent. Baseline benchmarking of Indonesia\u2019s procurement system in \nJune  2007 showed  it  scoring  62.5%  for  legislative  and  regulatory  framework  (pillar  I),  55%  for \ninstitutional framework  and  management  capacity  (pillar  II),  59.3%  for  procurement  operations \nand  market  practices  (pillar  III),  and  69%  for  integrity  and  transparency  of  the  public \nprocurement  system  (pillar  IV)  in  comparison  with  recognized  international  standards.  Other \nstudies indicate that there is significant room for improvement. \n \n33. \nLKPP will be responsible for sustainable, integrated, focused, and coordinated planning \nand development of strategies, policies, regulations associated with the procurement of goods, \nworks,  services  using  public  funds.  It  will  report  directly  to  the  President.  The  organization \nstructure for the new LKPP is being developed. In addition to the chairperson (who heads the \nLKPP)  and  an  executive  secretary,  there  will  be  four  departments,  each  headed  by  a  deputy \nwith  respective  responsibility \nfor  (i)  strategy  and  policy  development,  (ii)  monitoring \nandevaluation and information systems, (iii) human resources development, and (iv) legal affairs \nand settlement of objections. LKPP is currently staffing echelon II positions and is expected to \nfill all the staffing needs by the end of 2008. \n \n34. \nA  number  of  laws  have  been  enacted  since  2000  that  impact,  or  make  reference  to, \npublic  procurement.  These  include  civil  works,  state  finance,  treasury,  audit,  and  small-scale \nbusiness.  The  pace  of  Indonesia\u2019s  decentralization  reforms  has  impacted  public  sector \nprocurement  at  all  levels  of  government\u2014with  ministers,  governors,  and  even  mayors  able  to \nissue  decrees,  regulations,  and  instructions.  The  plethora  of  regulations  is  often  inconsistent \nand  many  regulations  do  not  meet  accepted  international  practice.  Consequently,  national \nprocurement reform and the need for national procurement policies and standards are critical. \n \nIndonesia\u2019s legal framework for public sector procurement can best be strengthened by \n35. \nanchoring  it  with  an  overarching  consolidated  and  comprehensive  national  public  sector \nprocurement  law  at  the  highest  level  that  (i)  establishes  the  fundamental  principles  and \nprocedures applicable to all public sector procurement; (ii) allows for the imposition of sanctions \nwhere the principles and procedures, particularly those relating to good governance and ethics, \nare not met; (iii) amends other laws that refer to public sector procurement; and (iv) ensures that \nsuch  a  law  has  the  necessary  authority  in  a  decentralized  environment.  LKPP  is  drafting  a \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nfor \n\nprocurement law with an expected 2-year time horizon for enactment, as it needs to undergo a \nreview and consultation process followed by submission to the Parliament. \n \n36.  Meanwhile,  LKPP  has  consolidated  the  different  amendments  of  Presidential  Decree \nNo. 80/2003 into one document. It is also planning to revise this with the objective of improving \nit with possible simplification for users. \n \n37. \nStandard Bidding Documents. Currently, no national standard bidding documents are \nused regularly by all government agencies in Indonesia. Some implementing agencies (such as \nthe  Ministry  of  Public  Works)  have  developed  standard  bidding  documents  for  their  own  use. \nThe National Public Procurement Office, through the support of ADB, has drafted eight national \nmodel  (standard)  bidding  documents:  (i)  an  explanatory  guide,  (ii)  goods  with  prequalification, \n(iii)  goods  with  post-qualification,  (iv)  works  with  prequalification,  (v)  works  with  post-\nqualification, (vi) other services with prequalification, (vii) other services with post-qualification, \nand  (viii)  consulting  services.  These  are  now  available  in  draft  form  but  their  use  is  still  not \nmandatory  and  they  are  being  used  on  a  pilot  basis.  It  is  important  for  LKPP  to  collect \ncomments  from  users  on  these  documents,  to  improve  them,  and  to  mandate  their  use  on  a \nnational  basis.  One  improvement  would  be  to  harmonize  such  documents  with  those  of \ninternational  development  partners  such  as  ADB,  Australian  Agency \nInternational \nDevelopment (AusAID), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the World Bank. \n \n38. \nPublic  Procurement  Function.  There  has  been  growing  concern,  both  from  the \nGovernment  and  development  partners,  over  the  pace  of  project  implementation.  Significant \ndelays  and  slow  disbursement  seem  to  occur  across  the  entire  PFM  cycle.  Projects  reported \nin  budget  preparation  and  approval,  budget  execution,  and \ndelays  and  difficulties \nimplementation, and procurement. Specifically, there are concerns over the implementation and \nprocurement capacity of government staff and the absence of incentives for project managers \nand procurement committees. Added to this, fear of prosecution by auditors and anticorruption \nagencies has affected projects because of the reluctance of officials to take action amid growing \nworries of being prosecuted under anticorruption legislation, even over minor mistakes. LKPP is \nconsidering assessing the introduction of central procurement units at ministries and at the local \ngovernment level.  \n \nCapacity Development. Presidential No. 80/2003 required the Government to adopt an \n39. \nexamination  system  and  certification \nfor  procurement  practitioners  within  government \ncontracting  entities,  to  ensure  that  their  level  of  competence  is  consistent  with  their  level  of \nresponsibilities. So far, the rate of staff passing the basic procurement certification is very low \n(less  than  20%),  which  amplifies  the  need  for  a  strategic  approach  to  capacity  development. \nLKPP  is  developing  a  strategy  for  human  resources  and  training  and  certification  on  public \nprocurement,  which  will  entail  development  of  training  courses  and  criteria  for  tertiary \ninstitutions.  \n \n40. \nIndependent  Appeals  Mechanism.  Despite \nimprovements  in  the  public  procurement  system,  concerns  remain  over  corrupt  and  collusive \npractices.  While  addressing  this  requires  an  overall  governance  strategy,  several  important \nelements  in  the  procurement  system  can  support  such  a  strategy,  e.g.,  an  independent \ncomplaints  mechanism,  an  effective  sanctions  mechanism,  and  improving  transparency  in  the \nprocurement process through the use of e-procurement.  \n \n41. \nthe  establishment  of  a  complaints  handling \nmechanism.  However,  this  is  not  set  up  independently  but  within  each  implementing  agency. \n\nPresidential  No.  80/2003  requires \n\nCorruption,  Sanctions,  and \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n67 \n\nAccounting and Reporting on Budget Execution \n\nLKPP  is  developing  a  strategy  to  deal  with  complaints.  While  it  is  imperative  to  develop \nprocedures for an independent complaints handling mechanism, LKPP should avoid becoming \nthe agency to which these complaints are addressed but rather develop a system and monitor \nits efficiency and reliability.  \n \n42. \nE-Procurement.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works,  Ministry  of  Communications  and \nInformation,  and  the  City  of  Surabaya  have  been  at  the  forefront  in  the  development  of \nelectronic  government  procurement  technology.  LKPP  is  also  taking  the  lead  on  behalf  of  the \nGovernment  for  implementation  of  electronic  government  procurement  in  Indonesia  at  the \nnational and subnational level. It is now critical to develop a road map for the development of \nelectronic government procurement in Indonesia, setting the roles of the different stakeholders, \nand  the  responsibility  for  ensuring  minimum  interoperability  and  core  data  standards  for  the \nvarious electronic government procurement providers to comply with. \n \nG. \n \nThe aggregate government annual financial statements have been prepared in a timely \n43. \nmanner for 4 years (2004\u20132007). Although the timeliness is a significant achievement, concerns \nremain over their reliability. BPK has issued a disclaimer opinion on these financial statements \nfor the last 4 years. The aggregate annual financial statements present revenues, expenditures \nand transfers, surplus and deficit, and financing aggregates, compared with budget provisions. \nA  balance  sheet  and  a  cash  flow  statement  are  also  presented,  along  with  a  full  statement  of \ngovernment accounting policy.  \n \nThe  government  accounting  standards  are  well  aligned  with  comparable  international \n44. \nstandards  (IPSAs).  Technical  capacity  constraints  limit  the  pace  at  which  these  accounting \nstandards  can  be  implemented  at  all  levels  of  government,  including  line  ministries  and \nsubnational  governments.  Capacity  constraints  in  the  line  ministries  are  being  addressed \nthrough  training  of  staff  through  an  ambitious  training  program.  The  target  is  to  train  over \n7,000 accounting  staff  in  line  ministries  by  the  end  of  the  year\u2014at  least  one  staff  per  project \nmanagement unit (satker)  by the end of FY2009.  \n \n45.  Monthly and quarterly reports on budget realization are produced by each ministry and \nsent to MOF for consolidation. A midyear unaudited report on budget realization is presented to \nDPR in July and is available to civil society.  However, there are reconciliation issues between \nthe budget realization reports of the Treasury and those of the ministries. These differences are \nreported as a suspense item in the budget realization reports, which have been disclosed in the \nannual financial statements since 2004.  \n \n46. \nministries.  \n \n47. \n \n\nThe  Government  issued  MOF  No.  171/PMK.05/2007  on  accounting  system  for  line \n\nThe changes brought about by the new regulation include emphasis on  \n\nline  ministries  being  responsible  for  recording  the  budget  allotment  for  their \nministries; and  \n\nreceivables,  payables,  and  investment  recording  by  line  ministries\u2014to  be \nrecorded and reported in the line ministries\u2019 financial statements.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nExternal Audit \n\nBased on the new regulations, line ministries will assume responsibility for their budget \n48. \nmonitoring (they do not have to depend on MOF controls only) and the financial statements of \nline ministries will present a more accurate picture of their financial position. \n \nAlthough  commendable  action  has  been  taken  to  improve  government  financial \n49. \nreporting,  there  continue  to  be  serious  challenges  in  making  government  financial  statements \nreliable,  as  reported  by  BPK  in  its  annual  audit  report  for  2006.  This  reflects  the  immense \nchallenges that lie ahead in an environment where accounting capacity at the grassroots level is \nweak and accounting processes are not yet integrated or fully automated. \n \nH. \n \nIndonesia has made considerable progress in addressing deficiencies in the audit sector \n50. \nin recent years.5 BPK was established under the Constitution and its roles and responsibilities \nare  set  out  in  Law  No.  15/2004.  Its  organizational  structure  is  outlined  in  the  Decree  of  the \nSecretary General No. 34/2007 and No. 39/2007, and its governance arrangements are set out \nin Law 15/2006. BPK has a mandate to audit all government entities, including MDAs as well as \nstate-owned enterprises (SOEs). Its independence from the executive branch is reflected in its \nboard members being appointed by Parliament. It recently received a significant increase in its \noperating budget to fund an increase in the number of auditors and administrative staff as well \nas the number of regional offices.6 All expenditures, revenues, and assets and liabilities of the \nGovernment  are  subject  to  its  audit.  However,  since  2006,  BPK  has  not  been  able  to  audit \nincome  tax  revenues  because  access  to  individual  taxpayer  records  has  been  denied.  This \nsituation has arisen from the requirements enacted in taxation laws (No. 6/1983 and 16/2000) \nunder which only the Minister of Finance can authorize access to individual taxpayer records on \na  case-by-case  basis.  As  a  result,  BPK  has  been  unable  to  audit  taxation  revenues,  which \nrepresent about 70% of central government revenues. \n \nBPK  performs  financial,  performance,  and  special  purpose  audits.  The  audits  are \n51. \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  the  BPK  Auditing  Standards,  which  are  stipulated  in  BPK \nRegulation  No.  1/2007  on  state  finance  auditing  standards.  These  standards  are  generally  in \nline with international standards and have been applied since FY2006. \n \n52. \nThe  audit  report  on  the  financial  statements  is  submitted  to  the  legislature  within \n5 months after the end of the fiscal year. BPK also submits interim audit reports to Parliament \nevery 6 months on irregularities and inefficiencies it has identified at MDAs. \n \n53. \nAuditees  generally  submit  formal  responses  on  audit  recommendations  and  their \nimplementation to BPK. The extent of follow-up is regularly monitored by BPK and reported in \nits interim audit reports. Records maintained at BPK indicate that an average of 80% of audited \nentities submit formal responses on follow-up of audit findings. However, this may not reflect the \nrelative importance of recommendations.  \n \n\n                                                 \n \n5   ADB. 2007. Sector Report on Accountability and Audit in Indonesia. Manila (Produced under ADB. 2004. Technical \nAssistance  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  Support  for  the  Implementation  of  the  State  Audit  Reform  Program. \nManila [TA-4473 INO]). \n\n6   The total annual budget for BPK has increased from Rp234 billion in 2004 to Rp1.5 trillion in 2008. The number of \n\nregional offices has increased from 7 (2004) to 29 (2008). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n69 \n\nInternal Controls and Internal Audit \n\nA  peer  review  of  BPK  was  completed  in  2004,  which  revealed  serious  weaknesses  in \n54. \ncapacity.  Since  then,  improvements  have  been  gradually  made  to  the  organization,  with  new \nhires and training. BPK has a follow-up peer review planned for FY2009.  \n \nI. \n \n55. \nThe Government\u2019s internal audit framework is extensive, but the institutional structure is \ncomplex and the mandates and division of labor between the various internal audit institutions \nhave  not  been  clear.  Government  Regulation  No.  60/2008  on  government  internal  controls \nissued in August 2008 defines more clearly the roles and responsibilities of the different players.  \n \n56. \nThe  Financial  and  Development  Supervisory  Board  (government-wide  internal  auditor; \nBPKP)  is  now  entrusted  with  designing  the  guidelines  on  internal  control  implementation, \nproviding  training,  and  improving  the  competence  of  the  Government\u2019s  internal  auditors  on \ngovernment  internal  controls\u2014essentially  an  advisory  role.  BPKP  is  also  mandated  to  audit \ncross-sector  activities,  activities  on  request  by  the  President,  and  the  Government\u2019s  treasury \nactivities if assigned by MOF.  \n \n57. \nThe  inspector  general  is  still  the  main  internal  audit  apparatus  of  the  line  ministries.  In \nprinciple,  inspector  generals  have  a  mandate  to  audit  all  MDA  activities  and  determine  their \nannual  audit  plan  independently;  and  all  units  within  an  MDA  are  required  to  provide  data \nneeded by inspector generals. In practice, most audits by inspector generals check compliance \non  technical  and  operational  aspects  of  activities,  including  internal  control  procedures. \nEvaluations  to  determine  adequacies  of  internal  control  systems  are  rarely  carried  out.  A \nsystematic  risk-based  approach  to  internal  audits  is  still  in  its  infancy.  Starting  from  2006, \ninspector  generals  also  review  their  MDA\u2019s  annual  financial  statements,  to  ensure  their \naccuracy, reliability, and integrity, prior to their submission to DG Treasury in MOF. \n \nThere was no formal commitment control system at satker and MDA levels that records, \n58. \nreports, monitors, or controls spending commitments during the year against approved budgets \nand  cash  availability.  However,  MOF  Regulation  No.  171/PMK.05/2007  on  accounting  system \nfor  line  ministries  now  passes  on  the  responsibility  of  commitment  control  to  line  ministries. \nDIPA  documents  prepared  by  MOF,  which  are  detailed  down  to  the  spending  unit  or  satker \nlevel,  establish  annual  budgeted  ceilings  on  expenditure  commitments.  These  procedures \ngenerally  prevent  MDAs  from  placing  orders  above  the  approved  budgets  (DIPA  limits)  for \nparticular spending items. \n \n59.  MOF  Regulation  No.  134/PMK.06/2005  and  DG  Treasury  Regulation  No.  PER-\n66/PB/2005  prescribe  detailed  procedures  for  payment  of  salary  and  nonsalary  expenditures, \nwhich supplement other written procedures on accounting and recording transactions. However, \nthe  processes  are  paper-intensive  and  involve  inefficient  use  of  staff  resources.  For  example, \nthe  supporting  documentation  required  for  payment  of  goods  and  services  covers  multiple \ndocuments that duplicate information, with weak audit trails and accounting evidence.7 \n \n60. \nBPK\u2019s audit report for 2006 records numerous instances of noncompliance with rules for \nprocessing  and  recording  transactions,  such  as  noncompliance  with  procurement  procedures, \npayments  not  supported  by  adequate  documentation,  and  overpayments.  Weaknesses  in  the \n\n                                                 \n \n7   In the Government\u2019s view, the procedures may create some duplication of work. However, this approach is taken to \nmaintain a check and balance mechanism and clarify roles, as mandated by Law No. 1/2004 on State Treasury.  \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nis \n\nthe \n\ninternal  auditor  of \n\nThe  Regional  Supervision  Agency  (Bawasda) \n\nReforming Regional Public Financial Management \n\ncountry\u2019s  internal  audit  function  implies  that  the  degree  of  noncompliance  with  rules  is  higher \nthan it appears.  \n \n61. \nlocal \ngovernments.  Lack  of  trained  and  skilled  auditors,  and  methodology  result  in  Bawasda  the \nweakest component of the Government\u2019s internal control framework. The overall internal control \nenvironment  continues  to  be  weak.  However,  recent  regulations  on  the  accountability  of  line \nministries and internal control are positive developments.  \nJ. \n \n62. \nDecentralization  has  provided  local  governments  with  significant  resources  and \nauthority.  More  than  one-third  of  general  government  expenditures  are  now  executed  by \nsubnational government. This requires an adequate regulatory framework and PFM capacity at \nthe local level.  \n \n63. \nAfter  decentralization,  the  central  Government  passed  comprehensive  legislation  for \nPFM  reforms  at  the  regional  level  to  mirror  the  changes  being  made  at  the  center.  The \nregulatory  framework  for  regional  PFM  reforms  is  now  largely  in  place,  including  mechanisms \nfor fiscal transfers to local governments. Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) regulations 13/2006 \nand  59/2007  and  related  MOF  and  Bappenas  regulations  now  provide  a  clear  framework  for \nPFM reforms.  \n \n64. \nAs  such,  attention  is  increasingly  being  directed  at  ways  to  raise  systems  and  human \ncapacity.  Bappenas  is  taking  the  lead  in  trying  to  improve  planning  methods  and  skills  at  all \nlevels of government, and to link plans and policies more closely to budgets in within a medium-\nterm framework. Both MOF and MOHA are helping to disseminate the budgeting, reporting, and \nsupervision  requirements  of  the  new  regulatory  regime,  particularly  in  relation  to  government \nregulations 58/2005  and  39/2007  and  MOHA  regulations 13/2006  and 59/2007,  which  provide \nthe  framework  for  modern  and  consistent  decentralized  budget  and  financial  management.  In \n2007,  MOHA  conducted  specialized  PFM  courses  for  about  100  officials  of  the  central \nGovernment  and  400  from  regional  governments.  MOF  is  also  training  decentralized  financial \nofficials nationwide, mainly through regional universities. In 2007, it conducted training in eight \ndifferent locations for 1,528 regional officials. A considerable expansion of the scope of training \nand professional development of regional finance officials is planned under subprogram 2, with \nsignificantly higher funding commitments from both MOHA and MOF than in recent times. \n \nSubnational  governments  are  obliged  by  law  to  report  certain  fiscal  and  financial \n65. \ninformation to the central Government. Most local governments report the information required, \nbut  with  some  delay.  Accordingly,  it  is  now  possible  to  produce  consolidated  general \ngovernment  reports,  although  with  some  delay.  MOF  and  MOHA,  with  funding  from  the  Local \nGovernment  Finance  and  Governance  Reform  (LGFGR)  1  project  loan,  are  also  involved  in \ndeveloping  new  computerized  financial  management  information  systems  to  support  planning, \nbudgeting, budget execution, reporting, and auditing in 171 regional governments to begin with, \nand  possibly  other  regional  governments  later  on. 8  About  9,642  finance  and  management \nofficials from regional governments will be trained in this major capacity development project. It \n\n                                                 \n \n8   ADB.  2005.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Loans  and \nTechnical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Local  Government  Finance  and  Governance  Reform \nSector Development Program. Manila (Program Loan 2192-INO for $300 million, and Project Loan 2193-INO [SF] \nfor $30 million). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n71 \n\nState-Owned Enterprises \n\nis  expected that  the  timeliness  and consolidation  of  reports  will improve,  with  this system  fully \nfunctioning in 2009. \n \n66. \nAllocations  to  individual  subnational  government  units  are  formally  issued  with  the \npassing of the national budget in October before the financial year, but notional allocations are \nalso included in the budget presented to DPR in August. In practice, this leaves sufficient time \nfor  subnational  government  units  to  finalize  their  budgets  but  submissions  are  often  late \nbecause  of  local  government  constraints.  However,  budget  allocations  of  shared  revenues \n(nontax revenue) are not issued before March/April in the financial year. The notional allocations \nare significantly underestimated by the central Government, and disbursements from the center \nto the regions are back-loaded toward the end of the fiscal year. Both practices are deliberately \nchosen  by  the  central  Government  to  ensure  fiscal  discipline,  but  they  constrain  successful \nfinancial management at the local level. \n \n67. \nBecause  of  over-budgeting  of  expenditure  by  subnational  governments  and  under-\nbudgeting of transfers by the central Government, many subnational governments have built up \nreserves in recent years.  \n \nK. \n \nIndonesia  has  a  sound legal  framework  for  corporate  governance  and monitoring  SOE \n68. \noperations.  First,  the  SOE  Law  No.  19/2003  sets  a  clear  ownership  policy  as  the  state  is  not \nallowed  to  be  involved  in  the  day-to-day  management  of  SOEs  and  must  allow  them  full \noperational autonomy. Second, a 2002 ministerial decree clearly details corporate governance \nresponsibilities, including the need to (i) submit each quarter the SOEs\u2019 financial statements to \nthe State Ministry for State-Owned Enterprises and to the appropriate line ministry; (ii) prepare \nannual financial statements that must be audited internally and by an independent auditor; and \n(iii) publish SOE annual reports in a timely manner.  \n \n69. \nExisting  laws  and  regulations  governing  SOEs  are  not  implemented  effectively.  Long \ndelays still occur in auditing and publishing SOE financial statements. SOE annual reports are \nusually only regularly and systematically made public in cases where companies have accessed \nthe local capital markets with listed instruments. The Government included fiscal risk statements \nin the budgets for FY2008 and FY2009, and is working on further improving the quality hereof.  \n \n70. \nThe  planned  use  of  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs)  to  accelerate  investment  will \ncreate fiscal risks that merit disclosure. The Government has taken steps to mitigate fiscal risks \nfrom PPPs. Presidential Regulation No. 67/2005 emphasizes careful project preparation and the \nselection of bidders in an open, competitive tender; and gives the minister of finance the right to \napprove or reject requests for government support. \n \nL. \n \nDuring  the  previous  DPL  series,  two  major  initiatives  in  debt  management  were \n71. \nimplemented\u2014a clear debt management strategy, which was publicly announced; and a newly \ncreated  DG  for  Public  Debt  Management,  which  has  risk  management  oversight  for  both \ndomestic and external debts.  \n \n72. \nThe Government has also successfully reduced its debt\u2013GDP ratio to about 35% (2007), \nfrom  the  peak  of  over  90%  (1999).  Despite  the  positive  development  in  terms  of  debt \n\nDebt Management \n\n \n\n\f72 \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption \n\nAudit  reports  confirm  that  data  and  reports  on  domestic  debt  are  reliable,  but  indicate \n\nsustainability and institutional reforms, the Government\u2019s institutional capacity to manage public \ndebts remains weak.  \n \n73. \nthat data and reports on foreign debt differ from donor records and may not be accurate.  \n \nM. \n \nIndicators  of  corruption  in  Indonesia  are  improving,  albeit  slowly. 9  Sufficient  and \n74. \ndedicated resources have been made available to most of the agencies critical to anticorruption \nefforts. Powerful independent oversight and prosecutorial institutions such as KPK and the Anti-\nCorruption  Court  have  begun  to  deliver  tangible  results.  In  addition,  institutions  like  BPK,  the \nFinancial Transaction and Analysis Center, and the Attorney General\u2019s Office have all critically \nimproved their anticorruption track record. \n \n75. \nHigh-profile  corruption  investigations  have  been  launched,  leading  to  a  number  of \nsuccessful  prosecutions.  For  example,  in  September  2008,  seven  parliament  members  were \nunder  investigation  or  prosecution  as  suspects  in  several  corruption  cases,  most  of  them \ninvolving  bribery.  Some  members  of  parliament  were  arrested  red-handed  receiving  bribes.  A \nsenior prosecutor has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for receiving bribes. This case has \nled  to  the  removal  of  three  very  senior  prosecutors,  including  two  deputies  of  the  attorney \ngeneral.  \n \n76.  While  there  is  clearly  success  and  strong  momentum  related  to  investigating  and \nprosecuting  individual  corruption  cases,  there  has  been  less  progress  in  developing  and \nimplementing  a  coherent,  well-focused  strategy  for  corruption  prevention  within  the  state \nadministration.  Ministry  of  State  Apparatus  Reform  (MenPAN),  the  ministry  tasked  with \ncoordinating,  monitoring,  and  evaluating  implementation  of  such  a  strategy,  has  limited \ncapability  in  this  regard.  As  a  result,  implementation  of  the  existing  anticorruption  strategy  for \nstate administration has been weak.  \n \n77.  While  progress  in  developing  and  implementing  a  coherent,  well-focused  strategy  for \ncorruption  prevention  in  the  state  administration  is  limited,  recent  developments  have  been \npromising. Previously, KPK was in charge of pushing and monitoring bureaucracy reform as a \ncorruption  prevention  measure  within  several  institutions  such  as  MOF,  Supreme  Court,  and \nBPK.  However,  when  this  task  was  handed  over  to  MenPAN  in  2007,  progress  became  very \nslow.  Nevertheless,  individual  government  agencies  including  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs, \nMinistry  of  Trade,  and  most  recently  the  Attorney  General\u2019s  Office)  have  initiated  important \ninternal bureaucracy reforms, which are well under way. \n \nN. \n \n78. \nclosely monitored. \n \n\nIn the period ahead, progress on the following key ongoing PFM reforms will need to be \n\nKey Areas for Future Attention \n\n(i) \n\nEnsuring coherence and momentum in PFM reform.  \n\n                                                 \n \n9  For example, Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index for Indonesia was 2.2 in 2005, 2.4 in 2006, \n\nand 2.3 in 2007.   \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n73 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nDeepening  the  reforms  of  the  central  government  budgetary  sector,  along  the \nlines discussed above. \nEnsuring  greater  integrity  and  more  effective  management  of  public  funds \nthrough  continued  implementation  of  a  TSA,  automating  the  treasury  payments \nsystem, and the institution of measures to prevent the proliferation of off-budget \nbank accounts. \nStrengthening  internal  audit  institutions  by  establishing  synergistic  relationships \nbetween them and removing overlaps. \nimplementation  of \nImplementation  of  a  new \ngovernment  accounting  standards  and  reengineering  of  underlying  business \nprocesses at spending agencies to ensure reliable financial reporting. \n\ntreasury  system,  extending \n\n(vi)  Widening  reforms  throughout  the  Government\u2014.extending  modern  financial \naccountability  and  management  processes  to  subnational  governments  in  a \ncoordinated  manner  and  bringing  these  fully  in  line  with  emerging  national \nstandards.  \n\nManagement of Foreign Exchange \n\n \n79.  Many  of  these  are  being  actively  considered,  and  prioritized  implementation  plans  are \nbeing developed by the Government. Implementation is well under way concerning the TSA and \nthe institutional framework for procurement.  \n \nThe capacity to monitor these and other reforms centrally has recently been established \n80. \nat the secretary general\u2019s office of MOF. Indonesians would benefit from a coherent reform plan \nor strategy to ensure proper phasing and coordination of PFM reforms. This would also allow for \nenhanced  monitoring  and  accountability  within  the  Government,  and  thus  provide  additional \nmomentum and direction to reform efforts. \n \nO. \n \nThe foreign exchange control environment is assessed to be generally satisfactory. The \n81. \ncountry  is  no  longer  subject  to  the  extended  arrangement  from  the  IMF.  Bank  Indonesia  was \nlast  subject  to  the  transitional  procedures  under  IMF\u2019s  safeguards  assessment  policy  in  2002. \nThat  assessment  recommended  remedial  action  to  address  a  number  of  vulnerabilities  in  the \naudit  arrangements  of  Bank  Indonesia.  The  main  recommendations  have  been  implemented, \nincluding  the  establishment  of  an  independent  audit  committee  at  Bank  Indonesia  and  the \npublication  of  Bank  Indonesia\u2019s  audited  financial  statements.  Audited  financial  statements  of \nBank Indonesia for 2007 have been reviewed and the audit report issued by BPK contained an \nunqualified audit opinion. \n \nP. \n \nIndonesia has established a sound legal and administrative framework for modern PFM. \n82. \nChanges in the legal and regulatory architecture are now largely complete and the momentum \nhas shifted toward implementation of new PFM practices.  \n \n83. \nKnown  weaknesses  in  financial  management  and  accountability  continue  to  be \naddressed  gradually  through  the  PFM  reform  program  discussed  above.  The  development \npartners are actively engaged in this process. Key elements of the reforms are supported by the \nDPL  triggers,  as  well  as  the  Government  Financial  Management  and  Revenue  Administration \nProject and initiatives supported by development partners. However, much remains to be done, \nand it will take time to realize the full impact of these reforms. \n \n\nConclusions \n\n \n\n\f74 \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n84.  Meanwhile,  some  fiduciary  risks  will  arise  for  this  operation.  Although  the  pace  of \nimplementing the planned reforms has been somewhat slow over the past year, the trajectory of \nreform  is  in  the  right  direction  and  the  current  Government  continues  to  demonstrate  a \ncommitment  to  continue  completion  of  the  planned  PFM  reforms.  Taking  these  into \nconsideration, the donor partners to the DPL/DPSP series do not propose putting in place any \nadditional fiduciary arrangements for this operation. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n75 \n\n  \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title: Indonesia: Fourth Development Policy Support Program (DPSP-4) \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\nPolicy-Based \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\nSoutheast Asia Department (SERD) \nIndonesia Resident Mission (IRM) \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \n\nThe  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (NPRS)  has  five  basic  strategies  for  poverty  reduction:  (i)  broadening \nopportunities, (ii) empowering community institutions, (iii) increasing capacity, (iv) providing social protection, and \n(v) promoting global partnerships. The NPRS is to be implemented through macroeconomic strategy and policies \nfor  fulfilling  basic  rights,  promoting  gender  justice  and  equality,  and  regional  development.  It  considers \nmacroeconomic policies  as the foundation for reducing poverty through  a supportive  business environment and \nbroad  opportunities  for  increasing  the  capability  of  the  poor  through  four  related  objectives:  (i)  create \nmacroeconomic  stability,  (ii)  promote  economic  growth,  (iii) increase  opportunities  for  employment  and \nentrepreneurship,  and  (iv)  reduce  inequalities  between  regions.  The  Government\u2019s  medium-term  national \ndevelopment  plan  (RPJM)  includes  the  main  tenets  of  the  previous  draft  NPRS  and  incorporates  the  eight \nMillennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  This  provides  an  overarching  framework  that  places  human \ndevelopment and poverty reduction at the center of the development agenda. \n \nThe country poverty assessmenta and country poverty partnership agreementb consider macroeconomic stability \nas a fundamental underpinning to poverty reduction. Under the agreement, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nhas  agreed  to  support  the  Government  in  promoting  macroeconomic  stability  for  inclusive  growth  and  poverty \nreduction. The highest priority is given to institutional reforms to achieve transparent and accountable institutions. \nThe  poverty  agreement  also  calls  for  expanding  and  improving  such  key  basic  services  as  health,  education, \nwater supply, and sanitation through public\u2013private partnerships; and points out the need to expand the system of \nsocial protection. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                      Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1. Key Issues  \n \nThe  DPSP-4  supports  key  areas  of  the  RPJM  and  NPRS,  including  the  investment  climate,  public  financial \nmanagement  and  governance,  and  service  delivery  to  the  poor.  The  DPSP-4  triggers  or  policy  actions  under \nthese core areas are unlikely to harm the poor, while several triggers have the potential to reduce poverty in the \nmedium term.  \n \n2. Design Features. Not applicable \n\nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n1.  Discuss the impact channels of the policy reform(s) (direct and indirect, short and medium term) to the country\n\nand major groups affected. \n\n \nThe majority of triggers under these core policy areas concern policy areas that do not directly affect the household \nbudgets of the poor. The links between poverty reduction and areas such as tax and customs reforms, regulatory \nreforms to improve the investment climate, nonbank financial sector deepening, and strengthening budget planning \nand execution, and transparency in financial management are indirect\u2014through increased economic growth and a \nmore efficient allocation of resources.  \n \nTwo  triggers  in  the  DPSP-4  policy  matrix  on  tariff  harmonization  and  improved  access  of  finance  for  small  and \nmedium-sized  enterprises  (SME)  are  likely  to  affect  the  poor  in  a  more  direct  manner.  Firstly,  changes  in  tariff \nrates  can  alter  the  purchasing  power  of  poor  households.  Tariff  reductions  in  goods  that  make  up  a  significant \nshare of poor households\u2019 budgets will benefit the poor by increasing their purchasing power. To mitigate risks of \nadverse  affects  in  low-income  groups,  the  additional  research  capacity  mandated  by  the  trigger  should  enable \npolicymakers to use empirical estimates of the impact of tariff adjustments on poor households as an input into \nthe policy process. Secondly, improved SME access to finance is likely to have a direct multiplier impact on rural \nincomes, employment generation, and poverty reduction. A further set of triggers on strengthening effective and \npro-poor  targeting  of  public  programs,  and  community-driven  development  will  have  unambiguously  beneficial \n\n \n\n\f76 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\neffects on the poor. The first (pro-poor targeting) is about institutionalizing program assessments and linking the \nfindings with planning and budget allocation. It enables the development of good systems to target marginalized \ngroups, and empowers local governments and community and service providers to delivery quality services that \ngo  toward  addressing  lagging  human  development  indicators.  Community-driven  development  projects,  on  the \nother  hand,  address  in  an  integrated  fashion  the  binding  constraints  to  poverty  reduction  at  the  village  level, \nthrough empowering the poor by giving them a say on how community resources are spent.  \n\n2.  Discuss the impact of the policy reform(s) on vulnerable groups and ways to address it/them (refer to social \n\nanalysis). \n\n \nThe policy reforms of the DPSP-4 do not adversely affect vulnerable groups. \n \n3.  Discuss how the policy reform(s) contribute(s) to poverty reduction, pro-poor growth, and the MDGs. \n\nThe  trigger  on  tariff  harmonization  (trigger  5)  has  the  potential  to  increase  the  purchasing  power  of  poor \nhouseholds. The triggers relating to improving access to finance for SME (trigger 7) is likely to help generate rural \nemployment,  income  and  pro-poor  growth,  and  poverty  reduction.  Institutionalizing  government  systems  for \nprogram evaluation and assessment\u2014and using the results in budget allocation, program design, and targeting \n(trigger  14)\u2014are  likely  to  help  develop  better  targeted  anti-poverty  programs.  The  trigger  relating  to  issuing \nguidelines  for  pro-poor  budgeting  and  planning  for  local  government  (trigger  15)  is  likely  to  address  capacity \nconstraints  at  local  government  to  deliver  effective  services.  The  adjustment  of  community  block  grants  to \nmaximize employment and poverty impacts (trigger 16) will lead to more efficient and equitable utilization of scare \npublic resources and minimize wastage. Finally, the trigger on requiring teachers to teach for a minimum number \nof hours is likely to improve human capital, vital for future employment and income generation prospects. \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe policy actions or triggers under the DPSP-4 are not likely to harm the poor and, if they affect them at all, they \nwill do more good. The main impacts, as mentioned above, are indirect.  \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe DPL series has supported actions that have been taken by the Government as part of its own reform agenda. \nThe development of this reform agenda has been done in close  consultation  with civil  society. In particular, the \nGovernment  undertook  extensive  consultation  with  key  stakeholders  on  all  five  recently  issued  policy  packages \nfor 2006, 2007, and 2008\u2014in infrastructure, investment climate, SME, and the financial sector. The Government \nhas  engaged  extensively  with  civil  society  on  tax  and  investment  law  reforms.  The  entire  set  of  DPL-5/DPSP-4 \npolicy  actions,  as  in  2007,  will  likely  be  discussed  with  Parliament.  The  design  and  implementation  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  National  Community  Empowerment  Program  (PNPM)  program  involved  substantial  participation \nwith  development  partners  and  civil  society,  and  community-based  groups.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the \nPNPM  and  other  pro-poor  programs,  and  using  the  findings  to  help  design  and  target  future  anti-poverty \nprograms, is a first in Indonesia.  \n\n2.  What  level  of  consultation  and  participation  (C&P)  is  envisaged  during  the  project  implementation  and \nmonitoring?  \n \n\n \n\n Information sharing   \n\n Consultation   \n\n Collaborative decision making  \n \n\n Empowerment \n\n Yes  \n\n3. Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including \nbudget,  consultant  input,  etc.).  If  no,  explain  why.  The  DPL/DPSP  process  supports  the  Government\u2019s  C&P \nprocess. \n \n\n No  \n\nC. Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues. The DPL/DPSP series has indirect gender impacts through its emphasis on making services work \nfor the poor. The improved poverty orientation of public spending increases women\u2019s access to essential services \nfor  achieving  MDG  targets,  including  reducing  child  and  maternal  mortality.  Improvement  of  the  financial \nmanagement  systems  of  the  Government,  through  increased  transparency  and  accountability,  will  provide  civil \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix  9 \n\n77\n\n \n\nsociety  with  the  basic  information  necessary  to  monitor  government  actions  and  enable  it  to  provide  inputs  into \npolicy and budget decisions.  \n \n\nA  strengthened  civil  society  provides  women  with  a  more  effective  channel  for  voicing  their  priorities.  An \nimproved investment climate is expected to provide greater opportunities for women, who experience significantly \nhigher rates of unemployment, even when controlling for experience and level of education. \n \n2.
