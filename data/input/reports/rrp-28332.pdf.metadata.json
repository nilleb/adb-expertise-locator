It  will  improve\ngovernance,  transparency,  and  accountability  in  the  corporate  and\nfinancial  sector  by  (i)  upgrading  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework,\nstandards,  and  policies;  (ii)  strengthening  key  sector  institutions\ninvolved  in  corporate  and  financial  governance;  (iii)  strengthening\ninstitutions  for  improved  drafting  and  enforcement  of  laws  and\nregulations;  (iv)  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  upgrading\npayment  systems  and  information  and  communication  technology\n(ICT) infrastructure for financial service delivery; and (v) preparing for\nthe restructuring and development of selected financial intermediaries.\n\nCategory C\nThe environmental implications of the Project are minimal.\n\nTo  escape  the  poverty  trap,  Nepal  must  increase  its  average  per\ncapita  annual  growth  rate  in  a  sustainable  manner  to  at  least  5\npercent,  with  equitable  distribution.  This  requires,  among  others,  an\nreal  sector  growth  and\nto  support \nefficient \nemployment  generation.  Unfortunately,  Nepal\u2019s  financial  system  has\nnot  been  in  a  position  to  fulfill  its  supportive  role  because  of\ndeficiencies in the basic foundations in the system.\n\nfinancial  system \n\nThe  fundamental  requirements  of  an  efficient  financial  system  are  a\nsound  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  environment  with  adequate\ninstitutions  and  effective  enforcement.  An  efficient  financial  system\nalso calls for access to reliable information that is disclosed in a timely\nand  transparent  manner,  responsible  market  participants  with  proper\naccountability  structures,  and  a  technological  infrastructure  to  reduce\ntransaction costs. In short, an efficient financial system requires good\ncorporate and financial governance with adequate ICT support. It must\nbe  in  place  before  more  sophisticated  markets  and  services  can  be\nto  be  successfully\ndeveloped,  and \nrestructured.\n\ninstitutions  are \n\nfinancial \n\nif \n\nThe long-term goal of the Project is to contribute to a higher and more\nequitably  distributed  economic  growth  through  a  robust  and  efficient\nfinancial  sector  characterized  by  transparency,  accountability,  and\nbasic  infrastructure.  The  results  will  be  increased  competition  and\nbetter  services,  coupled  with  reduced  transaction  costs  in  financial\nintermediation.  The  Project  is  part  of  a  multidimensional  and  longer\nterm reform process to achieve that goal.\n\nObjectives and\nScope\n\n\fii\n\nMore  specifically,  the  Project\u2019s  objective  is  to  improve  transparency,\naccountability and basic financial sector infrastructure comprising (i) a\nlegal  and  regulatory  framework,  accounting  standards  and  sector\npolicies;  (ii)  key  sector  regulatory  and  supervisory  institutions;  (iii)  a\nlegal  and  judicial  system  with  capacity  for  proper  enforcement  and\ndispute  resolution;  and  (iv)  environment  for  ICT  infrastructure  for\npayments,  disclosing  information,  and  delivering  financial  services.  In\naddition,  the  Project  will  initiate  work  to  restructure  and  develop\nselected market participants to enable them to play a better role in the\nfinancial system. In covering these assistance areas, the Project takes\na  holistic  approach  by  seamlessly  blending  a  number  of  loan  and\ntechnical assistance (TA) grant-funded components. From a subsector\nperspective,  the  Project  will  focus  on  governance  in  the  corporate\nsector and in nonbank financial institutions, including rural finance and\ncapital markets.\n\nAt the end of the Project, key policy impediments should be removed\nand  Nepal  should  possess  a  basic  but  sound  regulatory  and\ninstitutional  framework  with  improved  enforcement  capacity,  and  be\nprepared  for  introduction  of  ICT  and  further  reforms  to  support\ncontinuous growth of the financial and real sectors.\n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $13.3  million  equivalent,\nincluding contingencies and taxes. The foreign exchange cost is $7.9\nmillion  (59  percent)  and  the  local  currency  cost  is  $5.4  million\nequivalent (41 percent).\n\nSource\n\n  Foreign\n\n        Exchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nADB Loan\nADB TA Grant\nGovernment \nTotal \n\n5.1\n2.8\n0.0\n 7.9\n\n2.2\n0.5\n2.7\n5.4\n\nTotal\nCost\n 7.3\n3.3\n2.7\n13.3\n\n( $ million)\nPercent\n\n54.9\n  24.8\n20.3\n100.0\n\nA  loan  of  SDR  5.706  million  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  $7.3\nmillion  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  a\nterm  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  with  an\ninterest  charge  of  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and\n1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nPeriod of Utilization\n\nUntil 30 June 2005\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nMinistry of Finance (MOF)\n\nImplementation\nArrangements\n\nthe  Project.

In  addition,  MOF  will  coordinate  with\nvarious line ministries and agencies in implementing of the TA grant-\nfunded  components.  To  oversee  effective  coordination,  MOF  has\nestablish a project coordination and monitoring unit which will report to\na  steering  committee  comprising  private  sector  representatives,  and\nwhich was established during the project formulation phase.\n\nGoods  and  services  will  be  procured  according  to  the  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  Supply  contracts  for  equipment  and\nmaterials will be awarded on an international competitive bidding basis\nfor  packages  with  over  $500,000  aggregate  value,  international\nshopping  for  packages  costing  over  $100,000,  and  local  competitive\nbidding  or  local  shopping,  in  accordance  with  procedures  acceptable\nto  ADB,  for  other  items,  except  minor  items  for  which  off-the-shelf\npurchases  will  be  permitted.  Any  civil  works  financed  under  the  loan\nwill be on a local competitive basis, as costs are less than $5 million.\n\nThe  loan  will  finance  the  provision  of  consulting  services  for  policy\nadvice,  institutional  development  and  training,  preparation  of  ICT\nsolutions,  and  project  management.  About  87  person-months  of\ninternational  and  152  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services\nwill  be  required.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.\n\nin  preparing \n\nloan-funded  components,  help \n\nThe  Government  has  requested  an  umbrella  TA  with  six  sub-TAs\nunder  ADB\u2019s  cluster  modality  for  a  total  amount  of  $3.3  million  on  a\ngrant  basis  from  the  ADB-funded  TA  Program.  This  will  complement\nfurther  sector\nthe \ninterventions,  assist  in  addressing  key  sector  issues  on  an  urgent\nbasis,  and  support  the  establishment  of  a  conducive  framework  in  a\nmore  strategic  and  comprehensive  way  than  would  a  single-TA\napproach. Specifically, the proposed TA cluster will comprise (i) TA 1:\nStreamlining  Financial,  Corporate,  and  Commercial  Legislation\n($250,000); (ii) TA 2: Improved Accounting and Auditing Standards in\nthe  Public  Sector  ($250,000);  (iii)  TA  3:  Institutional  Strengthening  of\nthe  Nepal  Rastra  Bank  for  Regulation  and  Supervision  of  Rural\nFinance  ($800,000);    (iv)  TA  4:  Developing  Nepal\u2019s  Payment  System\n($400,000); (v) TA 5: Financial and Operational Review of Agricultural\nDevelopment  Bank  of  Nepal  and  Nepal  Industrial  Development\nCorporation  ($850,000);  and  (vi)  TA  6:  Developing  of  Insurance,\nPensions, and Contractual Savings ($750,000).\n\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date\n\nProject Benefits\n\n31 December 2004\n\nThe  Project  will  reinforce  the  basic  fundamentals  for  a  robust  and\nefficient  financial  sector.  It  will  increase  transparency,  accountability,\nand  better  governance  standards  as  well  as  law  enforcement.  More\nreliable  financial  information  to  the  public  will  reduce  the  scope  for\nrent-seeking  opportunities  of  individuals  through  a  monopoly  of\n\n\fiv\n\ninformation at the expense of the larger society. Access to information\nand justice is often excessively priced for the poorest segment of the\npopulation.    Initial  work  for  upgrading  the  payments  systems  and\ncreating \nICT\ninfrastructure  will  promote  competition  and  further  growth  in  service\ndelivery.  It  will  also  include  measures  to  prevent  money  laundering\nthrough Nepal\u2019s payment system.\n\nthe  enabling  environment \n\nfor  development  of \n\nA  better  regulatory  and  institutional  framework  will  also  increase\nstability  of  the  financial  system  and  make  it  more  robust  against  any\nfinancial  crisis.  This  will  reduce  the  risk  of  a  negative  socioeconomic\nimpact associated with a financial crisis, which is most severe for the\npoorest segment of the population.\n\nThe  Project  is  part  of  a  longer  term  development  process  for  private\nand  financial  sector  development.  A  computable  general  equilibrium\nmodel as well as international comparison with other reform countries\nindicates that comprehensive financial sector reform will boost Nepal\u2019s\nannual  gross  domestic  product  growth  by  about  2  percent  \u2013  or  $100\nmillion \u2013 per annum. Importantly, growth will be even stronger in rural\nareas as any ensuing investment will raise the demand for rural labor,\nespecially in the most labor-intensive activities.\n \n \n\n\f1.\nI submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on (i) a proposed\nloan  to  the  Kingdom  of  Nepal  for  the  Corporate  and  Financial  Governance  Project;  and  (ii)\nproposed technical assistance (TA) cluster for Corporate and Financial Governance Institutional\nSupport.\n\nI.\n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDevelopment  of  the  financial  and  private  sector  is  high  on  the  policy  agenda  of  His\n2.\nMajesty\u2019s  Government  of  Nepal  (HMGN).  In  response  to  this,  the  Asian  Development  Bank\n(ADB) country assistance plan for Nepal in 2000 includes the Project to improve governance in\nthe  corporate  and  financial  sector.  This  represents  an  initial  phase  of  a  long-term  reform\nprocess for sustainable financial and private sector development in Nepal.\n\n3.\nFormulation of the Project and policy dialogue were based on extensive economic sector\nwork  by  ADB  and  extensive  stakeholder  consultation  from  an  early  stage.  A  Reconnaissance\nMission visited Nepal in November 1998 and identified weak financial infrastructure - including\nlegal and regulatory framework, enforcement capacity, institutions, and technological support -\nas a major impediment to sustained private sector development. Subsequently, ADB conducted\na number of studies and workshops to further analyze key policy and institutional issues related\nto  nonbank  financial  intermediation.1  The  findings  suggest  that  addressing  corporate  and\nfinancial governance issues is key to sustainable financial and private sector development, and\nthat improving accounting standards and corporate legislation were of immediate priority.\n\n4.\nIn  response,  ADB  approved  a  capacity  building  TA  for  the  accounting  and  auditing\nprofession and a TA for reform of company, insolvency and secured transactions legislation.2 To\naugment the analytical capacity of HMGN and assist in coordinating the complex reforms in the\nfinancial sector, ADB also approved a TA3 for a focal point for financial sector reform. Under this\nTA,  a  web  site  (www.neat.net.np)  was  established  for  information  on  the  reform  process  and\ndiscussion  among  stakeholders  and  aid  agencies.  In  January  2000,  HMGN  formed  a  steering\ncommittee,  with  private  sector  representation,  to  closely  interface  with  ADB  in  formulating\nfurther  assistance  and  the  proposed  Project.  Project  implementation  arrangements  were\nfinalized  during  a  Fact-Finding  Mission  in  April  2000  and  an  Appraisal  Mission  in  September\n2000.  Throughout  the  project  design  phase,  ADB\u2019s  project  team4  coordinated  closely  with  the\nWorld  Bank  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  as  well  as  with  the  bilateral  sources\nactively involved in the sector, such as Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) and\nDepartment for International Development (DFID).\n\n                  \n\n1  ADB\u2019s  findings  are  summarized  in  five  reports:  (i)  Capital  Market  Development  II,  1998;  (ii)  Private  Sector\nDevelopment Issues, 1999; (iii) Financial Sector Regulation and Governance in Nepal, 1999; (iv) Transparency and\nEnforcement in the Corporate Sector in Nepal, 1999; and (v) Information Technology Applications in the Financial\nService  Sector  in  Nepal,  2000.  Some  of  the  findings  were  presented  and  discussed  with  a  wide  range  of\nstakeholders  from  the  public  and  private  sector  at  two  workshops:  Corporate  Governance  and  Financial  Sector\nDevelopment,  in  September  1999;  and  Corporate  and  Financial  Governance,  in  November  1999.  The  latter  was\norganized at the initiative of the Nepalese legal profession through the Supreme Court Bar Association.\n\n2 TA  3356-NEP:  Capacity Building for the Accounting and Auditing Profession,  for  $665,000,  approved  on  22\nDecember 1999; TA 3461-NEP: Company and Insolvency Law Reform, for $250,000, approved on 27 July 2000.\n3  TA  3371-NEP: Establishing a Focal Point for Financial Sector Reform,  for  $150,000,  approved  on  27  December\n\n1999.\n\n4  The core project team comprised W.

Growth performance has been disappointing,\naveraging  less  than  5  percent  per  annum  over  the  last  decade.  In  FY2000,  agriculture,  which\naccounts for 41 percent of output and 76 percent of employment, grew at 5.0 percent. Industry\ngrew by 8.3 percent, while services expanded by 5.9 percent. Inflation has been brought under\ncontrol,  falling  from  12.7  percent  in  FY1999  to  about  4  percent.  Monetary  policy  has  been\npassive,  supporting  the  exchange  rate  peg  with  the  Indian  rupee,  and  is  largely  influenced  by\nIndia.  While  treasury  bill  and  deposit  rates  of  6  to  7  percent  mean  little  real  returns  to  these\ninstruments,  prime  lending  rates  remain  at  more  than  12  percent.  The  current  account  is\nshowing a slight deficit compared with the slight surplus of the previous year. Foreign exchange\nreserves  are  at  a  comfortable  level  covering  6.7  months  of  imports.  Even  though  the\nmacroeconomic  situation  is  currently  stable,  the  decline  in  new  business  activities  does  not\nbode  well  for  future  performance.  Company  registrations,  capital  investment,  and  employment\ngeneration  by  new  firms  have  been  declining  over  the  past  few  years  in  all  main  industrial\nsectors. The decline in new business activities in manufacturing in particular is worrisome, given\nthe  fact  that  manufacturing  has  traditionally  been  the  most  important  industry  subsector  in\ngenerating new employment, ahead of tourism and services. Foreign direct investment, which is\nnot particularly encouraged by public policies, was only 0.6 percent of gross domestic product\n(GDP) in FY1999.5\n\n6.\nPolicies promoting nonagricultural activities in rural areas have so far shown little impact\non  the  ground.  Industrial  activity  remains  heavily  concentrated  around  Kathmandu  and  the\nCentral  Region  where  52  percent  of  industrial  establishments  are  located,  as  well  the  Eastern\nRegion which accounts for another 30 percent. Industrial activity falls away dramatically once one\nmoves  west  of  Kathmandu,  with  the  Far  Western  Region  accounting  for  less  than  2  percent.\nIndustrial  activity  is  concentrated  in  a  small  number  of  powerful  Nepali  families  who  own  and\ncontrol  about  27  percent  of  total  private  sector  assets  in  the  country.  In  addition,  a  number  of\nenterprises  remain  in  public  sector  hands  and  operate  at  very  low  efficiency.  Nepal\u2019s\nincremental  capital  output  ratio  (ICOR)  stands  around  5,6  showing  lower  investment  efficiency\nthan  in  its  South  Asian  neighbors  which  have  an  average  ICOR  of  around  4.  For  widespread\nreduction of poverty, a key challenge facing Nepal is to address the long-standing constraints to\nhigher growth, particularly the efficiency and outreach of the financial sector.\n\nIn 1996, about 42 percent of Nepal\u2019s population lived below the national poverty line of\n7.\nNRs4,404  ($64)  per  capita  per  annum,  which  is  based  on  a  minimum  calorie  intake,  housing,\nand  other  nonfood  expenses.  This  figure  varies  widely  across  the  country.  While  only  23\npercent  of  the  urban  population  did  not  have  sufficient  incomes  to  meet  basic  consumption\nneeds, 44 percent of the rural population fell below the standard. Geographically, the incidence\nof  poverty  in  the  Mid-Western  and  Far  Western  development  regions  greatly  exceeded  the\nnational  average,  as  did  the  rate  in  the  mountain  districts.  Taking  a  broader  view  of  human\ndeprivation  than  the  simple  income  measure,  Nepal  ranked  144th  out  of  174  countries  in  the\nUnited  Nation  Development  Programme\u2019s  (UNDP\u2019s)  1999  Human  Development  Report.  The\n\n                  \n\n5  For a more comprehensive assessment of economic performance, see CER:NEP98023, January 1999.\n6 This means investment of 5 percent of GDP is required to generate 1 percent of additional GDP growth.\n\n\f3\n\npeople  in  the  poorest  regions  of  the  country  have  the  lowest  access  to  education  and  basic\nhealth services, highest rates of infant mortality, and highest rates of child malnutrition. Poverty\nis  also  associated  with  lower  access  to  productive  inputs,  which  inhibits  the  poor\u2019s  ability  to\nbreak  the  cycle  of  poverty.  Rural  households  in  the  lowest  income  quartile  own  a  smaller\npercentage  of  the  land  they  farm,  are  less  likely  to  benefit  from  year-round  irrigation  for  their\nland, and use less fertilizer than their better-off neighbors. Poor households tend to be located\nfurther from roads. Borrowing from formal financial institutions, including microcredit, makes up\na lower share of the poor\u2019s outstanding loans.\n\n2.\n\nKey Financial Sector Issues in Nepal\n\nframework  was  deliberately  designed \n\n8.\nOngoing  financial  sector  reforms  since  the  1980s  have  not  yielded  significant\nimprovements  in  resource  mobilization  and  allocating  efficiency.  Traditionally,  financial  sector\npolicies  and  institutions  in  Nepal  were  premised  on  these  assumptions:  (i)  access  to  cheap\ninstitutional credit could break the low equilibrium trap and induce investment, (ii) informal credit\nagencies  were  exploitative  and  credits  obtained  from  these  sources  were  seldom  used  for\nproductive  purposes,  (iii)  the  government  was  required  to  intervene  in  the  sector  to  ensure\nsufficient flow of rural credit, and (iv) commercial banks had a social responsibility to serve the\nrural  clientele  even  if  in  some  cases  it  meant  incurring  losses.  As  a  result,  the  policy  and\ninstitutional \nto  allow  considerable  government\nparticipation  and  control  with  limited  competition.  Reform  initiatives  undertaken  in  the  past\ninclude  easing  of  licensing  policies,  statutory  requirements,  foreign  exchange  exposure,  and\ncash reserve ratios; liberalization of the interest rates; and introduction of various prudential and\nregulatory reforms. However, the past piecemeal approach has not succeeded in substantially\nextending access to the formal financial sector to rural people, much less to the rural poor. The\nreform  measures  were  not  embedded  in  a  wider  policy  reform  framework  and  financial  sector\ndevelopment  strategy,  and  as  such  were  improperly  sequenced.  Importantly,  they  took  place\nwithin  a  fragmented  and  nontransparent  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  environment.  It  is\nwidely recognized that the financial sector, and the state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) in\nparticular, face many problems.\n\n9.\nAmbiguous Vision, Policies, and Strategies for Financial Sector Development. The\nGovernment  has  issued  a  number  of  statements  emphasizing  the  need  for  financial  sector\nreforms and development on market-based principles, most notably in the Ninth Five-Year Plan\n(para.  25);  however,  a  subset  of  policies  with  contradictory  objectives  exist,  which  aim  to\nachieve socially desirable activities in the financial sector. The sector continues to operate in a\npolicy  environment  where  (i)  Government  targeted  and  subsidized  interventions  override\ncompetitive  and  efficient  financial  intermediation,  (ii)  interest  rate  spread  does  not  reflect  the\nhigher transaction cost associated with rural credit, (iii) institutions have no effective control over\ntheir  corporate  strategy,  and  (iv)  the  opening  of  new  urban  branches  of  commercial  banks  is\nlinked  to  the  opening  of  additional  rural  branches.  The  absence  of  competition  and  of  a  profit\nmotive in Government-mandated credit programs does not encourage lenders to fund projects\nthat will produce high growth for the economy. Instead, they spawn adverse selection and moral\nhazard problems with negative economic and social consequences.\n\n10.\nDominant  Government  Role  and  Poor  Governance.  One  striking  feature  in  Nepal\u2019s\nfinancial  sector  is  the  extent  to  which  the  Government  plays  an  active  role.  The  Government\nowns key financial institutions - Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB), Agricultural Development Bank of\nfive  regional  rural\nNepal  (ADBN),  Nepal \ndevelopment  banks  (RRDBs),  a  large  share  of  the  insurance  industry,  and,  until  recently,  the\nNepal Bank Limited (NBL). The central bank (Nepal Rastra Bank, NRB) itself is involved directly\n\nIndustrial  Development  Corporation  (NIDC), \n\n\f4\n\nin  several  directed  lending  (development  fund)  schemes  to  the  microenterprise  sector  and  to\nsupport  rural  finance  activities.  NRB  is  also  a  shareholder  in  a  number  of  financial  institutions\nthat it is supposed to regulate and supervise, thus creating considerable conflict of interest and\nregulatory  arbitrage.  The  Government\u2019s  extensive \nthe  ownership  and\nmanagement of the financial sector has resulted in strong political influence and interference in\nall  aspects  of  banking  operations,  and  led  to  lax  enforcement  of  auditing,  provisioning,  and\nreporting requirements. Moreover, there is concern over the lack of banking knowledge of many\nGovernment  nominees \ninstitutions.  Government-owned\ninstitutions, especially those established under their own separate acts, further benefit unduly -\ncompared with their private sector competitors - from direct or indirect subsidies in the form of\nexplicit or assumed Government guarantees, and less stringent enforcement of tax collection.\n\nthe  boards  of \n\ninvolvement \n\nfinancial \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nin \n\n11.\nPoor Quality of Financial Information and Disincentives to Information Disclosure.\nOne of the most serious impediments to sustained growth of the private sector in Nepal is the\nweak accounting and financial reporting systems. Nepal lacks sound accounting and reporting\nstandards,  which  are  among  the  most  fundamental  prerequisites  for  commercial  activities.\nThere  are  no  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  in  the  country,  and  disclosure\nrequirements  for  both  listed  and  unlisted  companies  are  inadequate.  The  fact  that  foreign\naccountants  are  not  allowed  to  operate  in  Nepal  has  undermined  opportunities  for  technology\nand skills transfer in the sector. It is believed that many companies submit the required financial\ninformation  with  a  few  years  delay,  but  insufficient  supervision  has  allowed  them  to  continue\noperating  without  much  penalty.  As  information  available  to  lenders  is  often  incomplete  or\nexpensive to establish, lending is based primarily on collateral and personal guarantees instead\nof  a  credit  analysis  relying  on  financial  statements  and  business  plans.  The  information\ndeficiency  has  resulted  in  misallocation  of  capital.  Increased  nonperforming  assets  in  the\nbanking sector and lack of investor confidence in the stock market have, in turn, increased the\ncost  of  capital  for  industries.  The  information  gap  also  causes  prudent  lenders  to  restrict  the\nprovision of financial services to low-risk clients, or to demand excessive collateral. Enhancing\nthe  role  of  the  Credit  Information  Bureau  (CIB)  to  share  information  on  borrowers\u2019\ncreditworthiness  is  being  considered,  but  that  requires  broad-based  participation  of  market\nplayers.  In  addition,  poor  reporting  by  financial  institutions  complicates  adequate  supervision\nand assessment of the financial sector health. Lending records within the institutions are usually\nmaintained in manual files and often are missing or incomplete. To help address the information\nproblem,  ADB  approved  in  December  1999  a  TA  to  assist  the  Institute  of  Chartered\nAccountants of Nepal (ICAN) to raise accounting and audit standards (footnote 2).\n\nIssues  in  Tax  Administration.  It  is  generally  felt  that  Nepal\u2019s  tax  policies,  particularly\n12.\nincome  tax  and  customs  and  property-related  taxes,  have  many  deficiencies.  They  allow  tax\nofficers  to  exercise  discretionary  powers,  resulting  in  arbitrary  tax  assessment.  It  is  widely\nbelieved  that  many  companies  maintain  different  books  and  accounts  for  different  purposes,\nsuch  as  tax  assessment  and  credit  applications.  Such  practice  has  exacerbated  the  mistrust\nbetween  tax  collector  and  payers.  The  GTZ  has  initiated  a  comprehensive  program  to\nstrengthen  income  tax  administration  and  registration  of  taxpayers  in  the  main  cities.  The\nDanish International Development Assistance (Danida) has provided assistance for introducing\nthe  value-added  tax.  A  uniform  tax  identification  number  will  be  used  for  tax  purposes.\nImprovement  in  tax  administration  is  particularly  important  in  corporate  governance  as  it  is\nindispensable for accurate financial disclosure of business entities, and information needs to be\nreconciled in a systematic and transparent way.\n\n13.\nFragmented  and  Inconsistent  Legal  and  Regulatory  Framework.  Nepal\u2019s  legal  and\nregulatory  environment  is  highly  fragmented,  inconsistent,  and  institution  based  rather  than\n\n\f5\n\nfunction based. This is particularly true of lending activities, which are regulated by at least eight\nacts.7 The result is a segmented financial system with special privileges for government-owned\ninstitutions and regulatory arbitrage for unevenly supervised financial intermediaries, particularly\nin rural finance.8 The various acts governing the financial sector are not necessarily consistent\nand  often  conflict  with  commercial  and  corporate  legislation,  in  particular  the  Companies  Act.\nThis  causes  a  high  degree  of  nontransparency.  Laws,  rules,  and  regulations  allow  for\ndiscretionary  interpretation  and  lead  to  excessively  high  business  transaction  costs  and  lower\nprivate sector competitiveness. While there is a need to streamline legislation, some important\nareas \u2013 such as bankruptcy, debt recovery, and secured transactions \u2013 are not yet adequately\ncovered  and  require  legislation  that  meet  the  needs  of  the  market  economy.  To  assist  in\naddressing some of the most urgent needs, ADB approved a TA for law reform (footnote 2) and\nthe World Bank initiated assistance to streamline banking sector legislation.\n\nIneffective  Legal  Enforcement  Mechanism.  Notwithstanding  the  proliferation  of  laws\n14.\nand  its  associated  problems,  the  country\u2019s  judicial  system  has  not  been  fully  equipped  to\nimplement  legislation  in  a  consistent  manner.  In  the  absence  of  a  commercial  court  or\nspecialized bench to deal with commercial matters, dispute resolution through the existing court\nsystem is usually a lengthy process. Judgments often are not made public or are inconsistent.\nWith  assistance  from  the  United  States  of  America,  the  Government  recently  developed  and\npassed a new Arbitration Act 1998, which is expected to address this issue. Good progress in\nimplementing the Act, however, remains to be seen. Improving the quality of legal professionals\nis  another  crucial  issue  in  private  sector  development.  Law  application  and  enforcement  are\nconstrained  by  lack  of  competent  lawyers  and  judges,  especially  in  commercial  law.  Legal\neducation and training are poor. Courts lack modern court administration techniques, and case\nmanagement by the judiciary or the courts is largely unknown. A recent United States Agency\nfor  International  Development  (USAID)  project  with  the  Supreme  Court  is  examining  the\nproblem  of  delay  in  courts  and  will  recommend  adoption  of  modern  case  management\ntechniques. The judiciary also suffers from severe funding constraints. The budget allocation of\nless than 0.5 percent of total expenditures is low and insufficient for the judiciary to effectively\nfulfill its role.\n\n15. Weak Institutional Capacity for Regulation and Supervision. While the Government\nplays a key role as an owner and operator within the financial system, effective supervisory and\nregulatory oversight functions that one would expect from a government vis \u00e0 vis the financial\nsector are largely missing. The key agencies entrusted with regulation and supervision are the\nNRB  for  banking  and  selected  nonbank  lending  institutions,  and  the  Securities  Board  (SEBO)\nfor  capital  market  activities  and  institutions.  Both  lack  a  clear  mandate  and  adequate\nenforcement  powers  and  tools,  and  are  constrained  by  a  weak  human  resource  base  and\ninadequate  information  technology  (IT)  support.  Specifically,  the  capacity  of  the  NRB  for\nregulation and supervision is weakened because of (i) dependence on policy directives from the\nMinistry of Finance (MOF), (ii) inherent conflicts of interest through direct shareholding in state-\nowned  financial  institutions,  and  (iii)  inconsistent  legal  and  regulatory  framework.  Moreover,\nresponsibilities for regulating of rural finance activities are diffused as a result of the fragmented\nlegal  framework.  To  improve  governance  and  give  a  clearer  mandate  to  SEBO,  ADB  has\n\n                  \n\n7  Nepal Rastra Bank Act, 1955; ADBN Act, 1967; NIDC Act, 1990; Commercial Bank Act, 1974; Developing Banks\n\nAct, 1996; Financial Companies Act, 1985; Cooperatives Act, 1992; Financial Intermediation Act, 1998.\n\n8  For  example,  some  rural  cooperative  societies,  which  are  allowed  to  collect  savings  from  the  general  public,  fall\nunder the purview of the central bank (NRB) under the Cooperatives Act, while others which cater only to members\nare supervised by the Ministry of Agriculture. Rural financial intermediaries such as credit unions will fall under the\nnewly  legislated  Financial  Intermediation  Act,  and  therefore  are  regulated  and  supervised  indirectly  by  NRB\nthrough the Rural Finance Development Board.\n\n\f6\n\nassisted in reviewing and modernizing of a new Securities Act. IMF is providing assistance for a\nreview of the NRB Act.\n\n16.\nFinancial Difficulties of State-Owned Financial Institutions. All state-owned financial\nintermediaries face financial difficulties, although the extent of the problems is difficult to assess\nin  the  absence  of  reliable  financial  information.  The  poor  performance  can  be  attributed  to\ndeficiencies  in  governance,  lack  of  commercial  orientation  and  managerial  skills,  as  well  as\ninadequate  policies.  Financial  record  keeping  and  auditing  are  not  of  international  standards.\nInternal  monitoring,  evaluation,  and  supervision  are  weak,  as  is  the  system  of  appraisal  and\nfollow-up on loans. The problems are most acute for the two government-controlled commercial\nbanks, RBB and NBL, which dominate the banking system with about 70 percent of total assets.\nA recent international audit indicates that both banks suffer serious, critical shortfalls in all key\nareas, and that both are technically insolvent, with negative worth estimated at up to 7 percent\nof  GDP.  Although  deposits  are  presumed  to  be  implicitly  guaranteed  by  the  Government,  a\nsystemic  banking  or  fiscal  crisis  could  emerge  if  problems  remain  unaddressed.  World  Bank\nassistance in this area has been requested.\n\n17.\nThe specialized development finance institutions (DFIs) - ADBN and NIDC - account for\nabout 8 percent of financial sector assets, but are widely believed to be in bad shape as well.\nPrudential regulations such as for loss provisioning are more relaxed than those for commercial\nbanks,  and  their  financial  statements  may  give  an  incorrect  picture  of  their  true  financial\nperformance and condition. Loan recovery rates for some programs are estimated at below 60\npercent.  While  the  DFIs  had  traditionally  emphasized  lending  based  on  credit  lines  by\ninternational aid agencies, recently they started mobilizing deposits, as their traditional funding\nsources  have  dried  up.  A  major  problem  of  the  DFIs  has  been  their  diffused  focus.  ADBN\nincludes  promotion  of  biogas,  rural  electrification,  small  irrigation  development,  and  solar\nenergy. While these activities appear interesting from a development perspective, there exists\nlittle  credit  appraisal  expertise  to  properly  assess  the  corresponding  risks  and  returns  are\nbelieved  to  be  poor.  NIDC  has  diversified  its  services  and  established  leasing  and  banking\ndepartments, and operates a closed-end mutual fund.\n\n18.\nOveremphasis  on  Credit,  Neglect  of  Savings.  Nepal  has  overstressed  the  lending\nfunctions  of  the  banking  system  while  neglecting  the  development  of  saving  options.    This  is\none reason why the nation\u2019s rate of savings mobilization is among the lowest in Asia. From the\nindividual  household  perspective,  savings  are  an  asset  and  borrowings  are  a  liability,  but  the\ntwo can be used to finance investment and smooth consumption. As earned interest on savings\nadds  to  family  income  while  interest  paid  on  debt  reduces  it,  adding  to  the  household  debt  is\nmore likely to reduce people\u2019s welfare than raise it, in particular in a stagnant economy where\nfamilies have few good investment options. If the cost of capital, which is often high because of\nhigh  transaction cost, cannot  be  matched by investment returns, credit may be contributing  to\npoverty  rather  than  reducing  it.  In  such  an  environment,  family  savings  are  better  suited  to\nfinance small businesses or help offset a poor crop year, and make it unnecessary to visit the\nlocal moneylender who often charges rates as high as 5 percent per month. The main objective\nof reform in the rural finance sector should be to expand the range of both saving and borrowing\nopportunities for farmers on a competitive basis and to minimize transaction cost.\n\n19.\nLimited  Outreach  and  Poor  Quality  of  Rural  Financial  Services.  Both  formal  and\nsemiformal  rural  financial  services  in  Nepal  have  inadequate  outreach.  Spatially,  they  are\nconcentrated in the Terai; operationally, they are biased in favor of agriculture; and in depth of\noutreach,  the  poor  have  limited  access.  By  1997,  the  entire  system  of  formal  sector  credit\nprograms and institutions had reached a cumulative coverage of about 23 percent of the rural\n\n\f7\n\npopulation.9  The  diffused  institutional  and  policy  framework  for  micro  and  rural  finance\ninstitutions  is  partly  to  blame  for  this  low  figure.  The  combined  coverage  of  ADBN  and\ncommercial  banks,  whose  loans  were  essentially  collateral-based,  was  about  20  percent.  The\nactual  coverage  of  the  rural  poor,  judging  from  the  coverage  of  the  group-based  loans,  was\nmuch  lower  at  3  percent.  By  implication,  the  remainder  is  borrowing  from  noninstitutional\nsources. That is not bad in itself, except that the credit review reported that only 13 percent of\nthese borrowings were for productive purposes. The causes of low institutional and productive\nborrowings  may  be  many,  but  in  the  wake  of  an  intensive  agriculture  and  rural  development\nplan  in  the  country  under  the  Agricultural  Perspective  Plan,  it  is  important  to  ensure  that  all\nstrata of the rural population have easy access to a broad range of financial services.\n\n20.\nUnderdeveloped  Capital  Markets.  As  in  most  countries  in  its  income  group,  Nepal\u2019s\nfinancial  system  relies  heavily  on  banking  transactions.  The  origins  of  the  Nepalese  capital\nmarket  can  be  traced  back  more  than  20  years,  but  the  capital  market  was  given  a  proper\nstructure  only  in  1993.  Though  the  creation  of  the  capital  market  immediately  attracted  the\ninterests of the retail investors, in size and maturity it has not kept pace with the growth of the\nprivate sector. Up to now, about 110 companies are listed on the stock exchange with a market\ncapitalization  of  about  NRs46  billion  ($650  million  equivalent).  While  registering  some  initial\nsuccesses,  the  Nepal  Stock  Exchange  (NEPSE)  has  little  daily  trading  activity  taking  place,\nprimarily retail, in only a few select share issues (mainly financial institutions shares). The vast\nmajority of shares remain illiquid. Also, capital markets have so far not been playing a significant\nrole  for  long-term  financing,  e.g.,  of  infrastructure  or  capital  expansion.  Individuals  and\ninstitutions prefer to deposit savings in banks and fixed-interest government securities, even at\nvery  low  or  even  negative  interest  rates,  than  they  would  if  the  market  was  working  properly.\nLong-term  savings  that  should  be  invested  in  the  capital  market  are  going  into  short-term\ninstruments.  In  part,  this  stems  from  an  overall  weak  governance  structure  with  poor\naccountancy  standards  and  weak  disclosure  of  financial  information  -  which  offers  limited\ninvestor  protection  -  as  well  as  an  undeveloped  institutional  investor  base.  Institutional\nstrengthening of the regulator, SEBO, and the NEPSE will be required not only to avoid further\nconfidence  crisis  through  market  irregularities,  but  also  to  lay  the  foundation  for  a  more\ndiversified, resilient, and market-led financial sector. Although the current role of capital markets\nis small, their development is mutually reinforcing with improvements in corporate governance\nand information disclosure standards.\n\n21. Weak  Information  Technology  Base.  Nepal\u2019s  financial  system  operates  largely  on  a\nmanual  basis.  Therefore  procedures  are  costly  and  cumbersome  and  poor  service  delivery.\nPayment  and  settlement  systems  are  not  fully  computerized  and  no  electronic  funds  transfers\nare  possible.  It  may  take  up  to  30  days  to  have  a  cheque  cleared  if  it  was  issued  outside\nKathmandu, and as a result, the economy is largely cash based. Moreover, the absence of IT in\nall areas of the financial sector makes information collection costly and unreliable, and hinders\neffective monitoring and supervision. It also increases the cost of branch operations and hinders\ncompetition.\n\n                  \n\n9 Sharma, S. R. et. al. 1997. Strengthening of Credit Institutions/Programs for Rural Poverty Alleviation in Nepal. A\nreport prepared for the United Nations/Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN/ESCAP).\n\n\f8\n\n3.\n\nProspects and Priorities for Future Reforms and Development\n\n22.\nFinancial  reforms  have  been  ongoing,  on  a  piecemeal  basis,  for  more  than  a  decade,\nbut  have  not  yielded  significant  impacts  in  terms  of  improved  resource  mobilization  and\nintermediation  efficiency.  A  more  positive  scenario  in  the  future  requires  a  clear  vision  and\ncredible commitment by the Government to address some of the policy inadequacies. This must\nbe  anchored  in  demonstrated  actions  to  shift  the  role  of  the  Government  away  from  being  a\ndirect owner to being a prudential regulator and supervisor of financial sector activity. In doing\nso,  the  Government  will  need  to  ensure  that  it  does  not  evolve  into  an  overly  bureaucratic\nregulatory structure but that it maintains constant dialogue with major market participants.\n\n23.\nThe reform agenda is huge, and is more likely to be implemented over a 10-year horizon\nthan a short-term program period. However, urgent measures need to be adopted, particularly\nwith  respect  to  the  SOCBs  to  avert  a  larger  crisis  and  to  lay  the  foundation  for  sustainable\ndevelopment of the sector.  Policy reforms must be sequenced and coordinated properly and be\nin line with institutional development to effectively implement them. Thus, capacity building in a\nwider  range  of  areas  must  be  emphasized  during  the  early  program  period,  requiring\nconsiderable resources for TA. To gain and maintain momentum, some real and visible benefits\nwill need to be front-loaded to the extent possible. The planned use of IT is a very powerful tool\nin this respect. Significant benefits of policy and institutional reforms as well as better use of IT\nare  expected  in  certain  rural  areas  where  transaction  costs  are  highest  and  accessibility  is\nlowest. The development of rural markets must be an integral part of a comprehensive reform\nprogram.  Effective  coordination  with  and  feedback  from  stakeholders  throughout  the  reform\nprocess are imperative for successful reforms and broad-based ownership.\n\n24.\nIn  pursuing  further  financial  sector  reforms,  it  is  important  to  recognize  the  continuing\nrole  of  traditional  financial  conventions  and  informal  credit  sources  in  Nepal\u2019s  economy.\nCooperatives  have  not  supplanted  moneylenders,  and  branch  offices  of  ADBN  have  not\nreached a significant portion of the population.  In rural credit, at least one half of farm - family\nloans come from moneylenders, suppliers, or sales agents.  The formal and informal sectors are\nin  some  ways  competitive  and  in  other  ways  complementary.  Smoothing  rural  financial\nintermediation by providing improved access to information and greater choices for savings and\ninvestment will be crucial for growth, employment generation, and ultimately, poverty alleviation.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\nA key objective of the Ninth Five-Year Plan, FY1998-FY2002 (Ninth Plan) is to combat\n25.\npoverty  by  increasing  investment  and  reduce  dependence  on  foreign  borrowing  through\nimproved  domestic  resource  mobilization.  Policy  measures  for  the  financial  sector  that  were\nspecified  in  the  Ninth  Plan  include  (i)  lowering  barriers  to  entry,  (ii)  allowing  mergers  and\ntakeovers  to  promote  competition,  (iii)  privatization  of  Government-owned  banks  and  nonbank\nfinancial institutions (NBFIs), (iv) recapitalization of major banks, (v) making the debt recovery\nsystem  effective,  (vi)  expanding  microfinance  services  for  poverty  reduction,  and  (vii)\nstrengthening  NRB\u2019s  supervisory  and  regulatory  capacity.  The  finance  minister  reiterated  the\nimportance  of  financial  sector  development  during  the  FY2000  budget  speech,  stating\n\u201cDevelopment  of  the  financial  sector  and  capital  market  is  necessary  to  provide  sustainable\nsupport to the economic growth of the country\u201d.10 Prioritization of corporate and financial sector\nreforms  has  continued  in  the  Government\u2019s  FY2001  programs  and  budget.  Moreover,  the\nAgriculture Perspective Plan, the Government\u2019s 20-year plan for rural development, which was\n\n10 Ministry of Finance.  1999.  Budget Speech for Fiscal Year 1999-2000\n\n                  \n\n\f9\n\ninitiated in 1995, identifies credit as one of the key inputs for boosting agricultural production. A\nrecent  review  of  the  plan  concludes  that  weaknesses  in  the  financial  sector  constrain  its\nimplementation.  While  the  Ninth  Plan  highlights  the  critical  link  the  financial  sector  plays  in\nchanneling savings into productive investments, it also notes deficiencies in the current system\nthat  impede  this  process.  To  address  these  deficiencies,  the  Ninth  Plan  stresses  the  need  to\ncreate  an  environment  that  increases  the  efficiency  of  financial  institutions  so  as  to  generate\ninternal resources for the country\u2019s development.\n\n26.\nAmong  the  main  complaints  of  investors  is  the  high  interest  rates  on  loans.  The  Ninth\nPlan points to high operating costs of banks as the cause of large spreads between deposit and\nlending  rates.  These  high  operating  costs  in  turn  are  caused  by  weak  financial  management\nsystems,  high  compulsory  cash  reserve  ratio,  growing  proportion  of  bad  debts,  and\nunnecessary expansion of organizations. However, while the FY2000 budget speech does call\nfor  the  formulation  of  laws  on  the  repayment  of  loans  and  bankruptcy  to  address  those  costs,\nthe speech also calls for better enforcement of the mandated 5 percent interest spread to force\nlower  rates.  In  other  areas,  policy-related  operating  costs  may  actually  be  increased.  For\nexample,  while  the  Ninth  Plan  admits  that  directed  credit  programs  would  need  to  be  phased\nout in the future, the Government will in fact expand such programs during the current planning\nperiod.  The  expansion  of  directed  credit  programs  is  also  reflected  in  the  FY2000  budget\nspeech,  in  which  the  rural  credit  programs  are  nearly  all  aimed  at  a  list  of  specific  activities\nranging from milk processing to solar energy.\n\n27.\nOne  important  aspect  of  enhancing  the  efficiency  of  financial  institutions  is  raising  the\nlevel  of  corporate  governance  standards  in  the  country.  The  Ninth  Plan  proposes  to  increase\npublic  confidence  in  and  liquidity  of  the  securities  market  by  protecting  investor  rights  and\npromoting  corporate \ninternational  accounting\nstandards, establishing a secured transaction center and a central security depository system,\nand  upgrading  the  credit  rating  system  play  important  roles.  Improving  transparency  and\ndisclosure  standards  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  privatization  plans  by  helping  to  assess  a\nfair price and facilitating performance monitoring following privatization.\n\ntransparency.  Toward \n\nthis  end,  adopting \n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n28.\nADB  lending  to  develop  Nepal\u2019s  financial  institutions  has  traditionally  focused  on  rural\nfinance  -  mainly  through  ADBN  -  and  microfinance.    Although  ADBN  was  established  under\nsome  of  ADB\u2019s  first  assistance  to  Nepal,  experience  in  more  recent  projects  suggests  that\nestablishing  the  appropriate  regulatory  environment  must  take  precedence  over  continued\nfinancial  support  to  that  institution.    Recent  TA  work  in  financial  sector  development  and\ncorporate  governance  provides  the  groundwork  for  the  reform  agenda  outlined  in  this  Project\n(Appendix  1).    Ongoing  TA  in  the  sector  supports  the  reform  process  by  building  up  the\naccounting and auditing profession through the strengthening of ICAN, reform of the company\nlaw and development of legislation for insolvency and secured transactions, and creating a focal\npoint  within  MOF  to  sustain  the  momentum  and  augment  capacity  for  financial  sector  reform\n(footnotes 2 and 3).\n\n29.\nThe  IMF  has  been  a  strong  advocate  of  financial  sector  development  in  Nepal.    To\nsupport the reform efforts of HMGN after the establishment of multiparty democracy in 1990, the\nIMF  approved  a  three-year  Enhanced  Structural  Adjustment  Facility  (ESAF)  of  SDR33.57\nmillion  in  October  1992,  the  policy  framework  of  which  included  financial  sector  reforms.\nSpecific  reforms  covered  the  restructuring  of  RBB  and  NBL,  with  the  goal  of  eventually\nprivatizing  the  two  state-owned  banks,  strengthening  the  supervision  capacity  of  the  NRB  as\n\n\f10\n\nwell as its monetary control and management functions, and capital market development.  Due\nto the rise in political instability after the fall of the majority government, reform measures stalled\nand the ESAF arrangement expired in October 1995 after only SDR16.79 million was disbursed.\nHowever, IMF TA helped strengthen the monetary operations of NRB, including compilation and\nreporting  of  monetary  statistics,  and  establishing  a  secondary  window  for  the  government\nsecurities at the central bank. During the IMF's preliminary discussions with the Government on\na  possible  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility  (PRGF)  program,  financial  sector  reforms\nremain  a  high  priority,  with  emphasis  on  improved  banking  supervision  and  commercial  bank\nreforms.  ADB  staff  also  joined  the  IMF  Article  IV  Consultation  Mission  to  Nepal  in  1999  and\n2000, providing feedback on the proposed policy matrix for a PRGF program and discussing the\ndivision of labor between ADB and IMF in reforming Nepal\u2019s financial sector.\n\n30.\nThe  World  Bank  supported  the  financial  sector  reforms  under  its  Second  Structural\nAdjustment  Credit,  a  quick-disbursing  credit  amounting  to  $60  million,  approved  in  1989,  with\nthree  tranche  releases  contingent  on  a  number  of  policy  conditions.  The  financial  sector\nadjustment  program  under  this  credit  focused  on  the  SOCBs  and  the  central  bank.  While  the\nestablishment  of  CIB  was  a  condition  for  submitting  the  project  to  the  Board,  most  of  the  first\nand second tranche conditions for strengthening financial sector reforms consisted of preparing\nstudies and action plans. For release of the third tranche, the conditions included Government\nfunding for provisioning and recapitalization of the SOCBs, and payments for the unpaid debt of\nnonfinancial  public  enterprises.  While  the  conditions  were  not  fully  met,  the  tranche  was\nnevertheless released in 1992. However, while NBL has been partially privatized, RBB is again\nin need of recapitalization due to continued poor management at the operation level.  The World\nBank\u2019s  proposed  Financial  Sector  Technical  Assistance  Project  will  continue  to  focus  on  the\ncommercial banking subsector and the NRB\u2019s supervisory capacity. Preparatory TA is ongoing,\nbeginning  with  an  audit  of  RBB  by  international  auditors  and  a  resident  consultant  in  NRB  to\nstrengthen the central bank\u2019s supervision functions.\n\nUNDP  financed  the  Government\u2019s  Commercial  Bank  Problem  Analysis  and  Strategy\n31.\nStudy,  which  provided  background  information  for  much  of  the  financial  sector  reforms  under\nthe  World  Bank\u2019s  Second  Structural  Adjustment  Credit.    DFID  has  ongoing  TA  to  MOF  in  the\narea of corporate governance for state-owned enterprises under its Privatization Project as well\nas legal reforms under its Enabling State Project. Some initial work to assist ICAN in formulating\nits strategic plan has also been supported by DFID. In addition, Danida and GTZ are providing\nassistance  in  reforming  and  strengthening  tax  administration,  as  well  as  support  to  the\ncooperative and microfinance subsector, particularly small farmers development. The proposed\nProject aims at complementing and reinforcing some of these activities.\n\n32.\nIn  preparation  for  this  Project,  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  held  a  joint  financial  sector\nreform stakeholder consultation workshop in Kathmandu in September 1999.  Representatives\nfrom  the  Government,  private  sector,  academe,  and  aid  agencies  participated  in  the\ndiscussions.  Nepal  Resident  Mission  (NRM)  staff  participated  in  the  regular  aid  agency\ncoordination meetings on governance chaired by UNDP as well as on financial sector reforms\nchaired by the World Bank.  Progress has been made in establishing an appropriate division of\nlabor  in  the  financial  sector  between  ADB  and  World  Bank  during  regular  review  missions  in\nNepal,  as  well  as  World  Bank  consultation  missions  to  ADB  in  November  1999  and  again  in\nOctober 2000. Discussions with the World Bank and other aid agencies will continue during the\nProject to avoid duplication of efforts or conflicting advice to the Government.\n\n\fD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n11\n\n33.\nGeneral  lessons  learned  from  ADB  operations  in  Nepal,  as  outlined  in  the  Country\nOperational  Strategy,11  point  to  the  need  for  broad-based  support  for  policy  and  institutional\nreforms to achieve and sustain any meaningful change.  To this end, stakeholder participation is\ncritical  at  the  project  design  stage,  particularly  in  formulating  policy  reforms.    Institutional\nstrengthening  and  capacity  building  initiatives  should  be  consistent  with  a  plan  for  short-,\nmedium-, and long-term sector development. Project preparation should include an analysis of\nissues  and  strategies  for  improving  governance  and  combating  corruption.    A  recent  study  of\npostevaluation  findings  for  ADB  projects  in  Nepal12  emphasizes  the  need  for  rigorous\nassessment of the capabilities of the executing agencies.  Moreover, for projects with multiple\nimplementing agencies, it is necessary to clarify their roles and functions from the start.\n\nEvaluation  of  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  Nepal\u2019s  rural  financial  sector  through  ADBN13\n34.\nindicates  that  lending  by  ADBN  has  not  achieved  its  intended  impact,  mainly  as  a  result  of\ndistorted  incentive  structures  for  staff  and  management  and  poor  operational  policies  and\nsystems,  leading  to  decapitalization  of  the  institution.  While  ADBN  experienced  a  rapid\nexpansion  of  operational  scope  and  a  modest  degree  of  institutional  strengthening,  it  did  not\naddress endemic problems associated with information flow, contract monitoring, and enforcing\nrepayment  from  farmer  borrowers.  The  persistence  of  high  transaction  costs  also  precluded\neffective  competition  with  established  informal  lenders.  Overall  the  project  performance  audit\nreport  (PPAR)  concludes  that  ADBN's  operations  were  not  sustainable,  financially  and\neconomically.  The  PPAR  proposes  a  reframing  of  ADBN's  structure  and  mission  for  the  rural\nsectors. In the future, considerable practical attention needs to be devoted to anticipating and to\nreducing  transaction  costs,  information  deficiencies,  and  moral  hazard  in  rural  finance.  These\nthree  terms  are  central  to  the  rationale  and  design  of  this  Project  and  should  be  more  fully\ndiscussed with reference to actual problems faced.\n\nPPARs  for  two  recently  completed  financial  sector  reform  projects  in  Sri  Lanka  and\n35.\nIndia14  also  emphasize  the  importance  of  Government  ownership  of  the  reform  agenda,\nincluding  the  pace  and  sequence  of  reforms.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  experience  in  financial  sector\nreform  in  Nepal  under  its  Second  Structural  Adjustment  Credit  demonstrated  the  need  for\ninvolving  the  Government  at  the  design  stage.  Furthermore,  a  project  must  (i)  show  a  clear\nrelationship between its objectives and the policy measures; (ii) include consistent, monitorable\nperformance benchmarks; (iii) assess the sustainability and practicality of policy measures; and\n(iv)  address  the  financial  implications  of  the  policy  measures.  Project  design  must  address\ninstitutional  weaknesses  and  consider  the  extent  of  political  support  for  policy  measures,\nparticularly  those  that  affect  vested  interests.    Finally,  loan  conditions  should  include  well-\ndefined  actions  and  targets,  rather  than  studies  to  determine  future  measures  or  vaguely\nworded performance indicators.\n\nE. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n36.\nToward the goal of sustainable reductions in poverty in Nepal, the strategic approach of\nADB\u2019s  Country  Operational  Strategy  (footnote  11)  is  to  build  effective  institutions  needed  to\n\n                  \n\n11 STS: NEP 99006: Country Operational Strategy Study, Nepal, July 1999.\n12  Asian  Development  Bank  Postevaluation  Findings: Country Synthesis of Evaluation Findings in Nepal,  October\n\n1999.\n\n13 PEO 502, Loan 831 NEP: Fifth Agricultural Credit Project, December 1997.\n14 Loan SRI 1051: Financial Sector Program, for $80 million, approved on 20 November 1990; and Loan IND 1208:\n\nFinancial Sector Program, for $300 million, approved on 15 December 1992.\n\n\f12\n\nimplement socioeconomic development in a market economy.  In this context, financial sector\ndevelopment  aims  at  (i)  increasing  the  stability  and  resilience  of  the  sector  by  improving\nsupervisory  standards  and  supporting  the  development  of  alternative  second-tier  financial\ninstitutions  to  foster  competition;  (ii)  improving  the  efficiency  of  financial  intermediation  by\nincreasing transparency and access to information while depoliticizing the process of allocating\nresources; (iii) improving access to and quality of financial services, particularly in rural areas;\nand  (iv)  supporting  regional  integration  within  the  South  Asian  Association  for  Regional\nCooperation. To achieve these strategic objectives, the operational priorities have to respond to\nNepal\u2019s  generic  financial  sector  needs  for  policy  support,  institution  building,  and  transparent\nregulatory framework before direct assistance for specific market segments and intermediaries\ncan be contemplated.\n\n37.\nStarting from a very low base, a mixture of quite different activities is required, such as\ntraining  of  judges  and  linking  financial  service  providers  through  IT.  During  the  early  phases,\nthese  may  appear  somehow  scattered,  but  they  will  flow  together  toward  a  coherent  system\nover the medium to long term. Without addressing a range of areas simultaneously at an early\nstage, long-term sustainability cannot be achieved.\n\n38.\nGiven the complexities and interlinkages of the sector a wholistic approach with various\nphases  over  about  10  years  will  be  pursued  to  ensure  a  significant  and  sustainable  impact.\nPhase  I,  to  be  implemented  with  the  support  of  the  Project  over  3-4  years,  will  focus  on  the\ncreation of basic financial sector infrastructure and a sound enabling environment.  Specifically,\nphase I aims at (i) creating a policy and legal environment for effective competition, based on\nsound  economic  and  sector  work;  (ii)  capacity  building  for  key  institutions  for  financial  sector\nregulation, supervision, and legal enforcement; (iii) improving information disclosure standards\nand  corporate  governance,  including  accounting  and  auditing  standards  as  well  as  capital\nmarkets  development;  and  (iv)  introducing  basic  IT  for  improved  transparency  and  financial\nservice delivery. ADB\u2019s focus will be NBFIs, including DFIs, rural finance, and capital markets,\nand the World Bank will look after the commercial banking sector.\n\n39.\nPhase II will continue capacity building measures initiated under phase I, but expand the\ninstitutional  level  to  include  restructuring  of  selected  lending  institutions  such  as  ADBN  and\nNIDC. The use of information and communications technology (ICT), for electronic (e)-banking\nand  supporting  e-commerce,  will  be  pursued  more  vigorously.  Some  preparatory  work  toward\nthis effect will be undertaken in phase I. Some work on deposit insurance coverage will also be\nrequired  to  better  deal  with  the  political  economy  of  bank  restructuring.  In  addition,  deepened\ncapital markets will be through development of contractual savings and further outreach in rural\nfinancial markets will be pursued. Privatization of state-owned enterprises and reforms in trade\nand industry will be undertaken to complement financial sector reforms. Phase III will follow up\non  the  restructuring  of  selected  lending  institutions,  broaden  and  deepen  the  financial  market\nfurther, and pursue regional integration more rigorously.  The full benefits of the overall reform\nprocess  will  only  become  available  upon  completion  of  the  cycle,  but  phase  I  in  particular  is\nneeded to allow the growth of financial markets in a sustained manner.\n\nSpecial emphasis will be given to nonbank financial intermediation and the development\n40.\nof rural financial markets. Toward this end, ADB has developed a rural finance strategy, which\nwas  discussed  with  a  large  number  of  stakeholders  in  Kathmandu  in  February  2000.  The\nvarious  strategic  components  that  were  proposed  are  supported  by  the  Project  and  aim  at\nimproving the environment for rural financial services, allowing new entrants, and strengthening\nthe  existing  ones.  In  addition,  ADB  will  explore  complementary  activities  to  promote  private\nsector development, particularly for small and medium-scale enterprises.\n\n\fF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n13\n\n41.\nPolicy  dialogue  has  focused  essentially  on  (i)  sector  governance  and  role  of  the\ngovernment;  (ii)  prevailing  sector  policies  for  rural  finance  and  NBFIs;  (iii)  improving  the\nlegislative  and  regulatory  environment,  including  measures  to  enhance  transparency  and\ninstitutional  strengthening;  (iv)  legal  enforcement  mechanisms  and  measures  to  improve  the\njudicial  system;  and  (v)  introducing  selected  legislation.  At  this  stage,  ADB\u2019s  dialogue  largely\navoided  detailed  discussion  of  restructuring  the  state-owned  financial  institutions,  particularly\nthe  DFIs,  which  will  follow  once  progress  is  made  on  the  policy,  governance,  and  regulatory\nfront.\n\n42.\nTo  improve  overall  sector  governance  direct  participation,  ADB  together  with  IMF  and\nthe  World  Bank  has  stressed  the  need  for  HMGN  to  shift  its  role  from  one  of  regulation  and\nprudential  supervision.  Further  clarification  is  required  as  regards  the  institutional  setup  and\nmandate  of  the  key  regulators,  which  will  be  subject  to  ongoing  dialogue.  The  governing\nlegislation  of  NRB  will  be  revised  to  provide  a  high  degree  of  independence  within  a  well-\ndefined policy framework and clear accountability. Legislation governing the financial institutions\nis also being reviewed to ensure equal opportunities for state-owned and private sector market\nparticipants. To facilitate this process, HMGN has agreed to establish a Corporate and Financial\nLaw  Review  Committee  to  ensure  that  a  consistent  and  consultative  process  is  applied.  This\ncommittee  will  also  review  other  laws  related  to  the  sector  to  streamline  the  legislative\nframework. Also, official translation of key economic laws will be provided and a legal resource\ncenter for online access to all corporate and financial sector legislation will be established.\n\nTo remove policy impediments to extension of rural financial services, the Government\n43.\nhas  agreed  to  further  rationalize  interest  rates,  and  to  review  the  priority  and  directed  credit\nsector  lending  requirements  as  well  as  branch  licensing  policies.  In  this  regard,  the  urban\nbranch network of ADBN - and rural branch regulation for commercial banks - will be reviewed\nfurther.  Subsidized  credit  schemes  may  be  justifiable,  but  should  be  funded  in  a  transparent\nmanner through the budget, not through the banking system. The Government agreed to spinoff\nADBN small farmers subproject offices into cooperatives, with possible assistance by GTZ.\n\nIn  the  areas  of  corporate  governance  and  capital  market  development,  HMGN  with\n44.\nassistance from ADB, has formulated a new Securities Act that provides for an autonomous and\naccountable SEBO including significant private sector representation on its Board. In addition,\nthe  NEPSE  will  be  privatized.  To  promote  improved  accounting  standards  and  information\ndisclosure, HMGN has agreed to repeal the Auditors Act and give full effectivity to the ICAN Act,\nand  to  consider  the  controlled  opening  of  the  services  sector  to  qualified  foreign  legal  and\naccounting professionals to allow transfer of skills. Options to enhance the role of the SEBO or\nOffice  of  the  Companies  Registrar  in  information  disclosure  also  for  tax  purposes  will  be\ndiscussed  further  under  the  Project.  An  official  English  translation  of  key  corporate  legislation\nwill improve transparency for foreign investors. HMGN further agreed to the establishment of a\njudicial  academy  for  training  of  judges  and  government  and  private  sector  lawyers  under  the\nJudicial  Council  chaired  by  the  Chief  Justice,  with  sufficient  commercial  orientation,  and\nimprovement in funding allocations to the judiciary. For developing the legal profession, the Bar\nAssociation  of  Nepal  recently  set  up  an  examination  to  certify  qualified  lawyers.  To  improve\njudiciary  transparency  and  accountability,  there  will  be  disclosure  of  assets  by  all  judges  and\npublication of an annual report to the public. HMGN also agreed to support the introduction of e-\nbanking  and  e-commerce,  installed  and  operated  by  the  private  sector  or  on  a  public-private\npartnership  basis,  and  allow  electronic  funds  transfer  within  a  well-regulated  and  supervised\nframework. It further agreed to protect the required frequencies for this network.\n\n\f14\n\nThe  Government  incorporated  many  elements  from  the  ongoing  policy  dialogue  in  its\n45.\nbackground paper on financial sector development, which was presented to the aid community\nat the Nepal Development Forum in Paris in April 2000, as well as its financial sector strategy\nstatement  released  in  August  2000.  However,  given  the  complex  and  dynamic  nature  of  the\nsector, policy dialogue will be continued throughout project implementation.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nto  reduce  widespread  poverty  encountered \n\n46.\nTo escape poverty, Nepal must achieve a per capita annual growth rate of 5 percent or\nmore on a sustained basis. This rate is much higher than the current 2 to 3 percent per year.\nin  Nepal,  growth  and  employment\nThus, \nopportunities must be generated. This requires higher levels of investment - and saving to fund\ninvestment - as well as more efficient use of resources. Sustained private-sector-led growth and\nincreased productive activities by a greater portion of the population, in turn, must be supported\nby an effective financial system. Such a system comprises a complex set of laws, regulations,\npolicies, practices, institutions, and technology that link savers and investors in the economy to\nallow effective allocation of financial resources. An ADB study15 concludes that, with an effective\nfinancial system in place, Nepal\u2019s annual growth could be boosted by as much as 2 percent per\nannum, effectively bridging the gap to escape the trap of poverty.\n\n47.\nAn  effective  financial  system  offers  a  positive  incentive  structure  for  financial\nintermediation.  It  provides  positive  returns  to  a  wide  range  of  savers,  provides  timely  and\ncompetitively  priced  credit  to  a  wide  range  of  borrowers;  and,  through  a  wide  range  of\ninstruments  and  institutions,  allocates  society\u2019s  scarce  capital  to  its  most  efficient,  growth-\npromoting uses. As more effective financial intermediation reduces the cost of capital, the return\nof  investment  that  is  required  to  break  even  is  lowered,  which  in  turn  will  result  in  more\nsuccessful  investment  and  employment  generation.  In  addition,  a  sound  financial  system\nmitigates vulnerability to financial crisis and the economic and social costs that follow financial\ndisruption.  Broader  and  deeper  financial  markets  are  important  because  of  the  stability,\nefficiency, and access they confer, all of which are key determinants of prosperity and poverty\nreduction.\n\n48.\nUnfortunately,  Nepal\u2019s  financial  system  has  been  ineffective  in  fulfilling  its  role  and  is\ninherently vulnerable. The system is marred by many shortcomings (paras. 8-21), which lead to\ndistorted incentive structures, high transaction costs, and misallocation of capital. It is therefore\nimportant  to  adjust  Nepal\u2019s  financial  system  to  reduce  the  high  costs  and  increase  access  to\ninformation,  capital,  and  savings  opportunities,  particularly  in  rural  areas  where  90  percent  of\nNepal\u2019s  population  live.  A  very  basic  element  of  this  adjustment  is  improvement  in  corporate\nand financial governance structures.\n\n49.\nThe  importance  of  corporate  governance  is  one  of  the  important  lessons  of  the  Asian\ncrisis. Absence of basic governance provisions such as on the role of directors and managers,\ngenerally accepted accounting standards, and transparent information disclosure leads to moral\nhazard and adverse selection16 and puts at risk the sustainability of the corporate sector, which\n\n                  \n\n15 TA 3135-NEP: Financial Sector Regulation and Governance, for $150,000, approved on 22 December 1998.\n16  Moral  hazard  and  adverse  selection  describe  situations  in  which  incentive  structures  or  asymmetric  information\n\nleads to perverse economic outcomes.\n\n\f15\n\nis  closely  interlinked  with  the  health  of  the  financial  sector.  Good  corporate  and  financial\ngovernance standards are essential for a conducive investment framework.\n\n50.\nIn pursuing any reforms in the private and financial sector, it is important to keep in mind\nthat  Nepal\u2019s  economy  is  closely  linked  to  India\u2019s  economy,  which  underwent  significant\nstructural changes over the past years. If Nepal\u2019s investment environment cannot compete with\nits dominant immediate neighbor, resources and investment will dry up or even flow out of the\ncountry. As a small landlocked country, Nepal has to lead rather than follow the reform process\nto  offer  comparative  advantages  to  investors.  Thus,  the  challenge  for  Nepal  is  to  create  a\nfinancial system that is supportive of growth.\n\n51.\nThe  Project  initiates  a  much-needed  structured  approach  for  long-term  financial  and\nprivate  sector  development.  This  requires  the  establishment  of  an  effective  regulatory,\ninstitutional and technological framework. The project framework is in Appendix 2.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n52.\nThe long-term goal of the Project is to contribute to higher and more equitably distributed\nof economic growth through a robust and efficient financial sector. This will be achieved through\nimproved  transparency,  accountability,  and  basic  financial  sector  infrastructure,  leading  to\nincreased  competition  and  better  services,  coupled  with  reduced  transaction  costs  in  financial\nintermediation.  In  pursuing  this  goal,  the  Project  is  part  of  a  multidimensional  and  long-term\nreform process.\n\nThe  immediate  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  governance  and  efficiency  in\n\n53.\nNepal\u2019s corporate and financial sector. Specifically, this involves\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nimproving  selected  parts  of  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  standards,  and\npolicies, particularly those relating to accounting, auditing, companies, securities,\nand rural finance;\n\ncapacity  building  for  essential  regulatory,  supervisory,  or  service  institutions  for\nthe Project, including sections of NRB, Auditor General, ICAN, SEBO,  NEPSE,\nCentral  Depository  System  (CDS),  Company  Registrar\u2019s  Office  (CRO),  and\nestablishment of a secured transactions registry;\n\ncapacity  building  for  improved  legal  drafting  and  enforcement  of  laws  by\nestablishing  of  the  National  Judicial  Academy  (NJA)  to  enhance  the  skills  of\njudges,  court  officials,  officials  exercising  quasi-judicial  powers,  Government\nlawyers  and  private  practitioners,  particularly  in  keeping  abreast  with  new  and\nchanging legislation;\n\nimproving  financial  service  delivery  by  strengthening  the  payment  system  and\nsupporting  the  institutional  infrastructure  for  future  investment  in  ICT  through  a\npublic-private partnership, the electronic Financial Information & Technology (e-\nFIT) company; and\n\n(v) \n\npreparing  to  restructure  and  develop  selected  financial  intermediaries,  including\nADBN, NIDC, Employees Provident Fund, and the insurance industry.\n\n54.\nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  a  consistent  and  transparent  legal  and  regulatory\nframework  for  corporate  and  financial  governance,  with  effective  implementation  institutions.\nThe objective is to give the public more reliable financial information and reduce the scope for\nrent-seeking activities by few individuals at the expense of the larger society. The Project also\n\n\f16\n\nintends to foster competition and support expansion of financial services. As a result, economic\ntransaction  costs  should  go  down  (through  reduction  in  both  information  acquisition  cost  and\nbad lending/investment decisions). The improved environment will support the development of\nnew savings alternatives, and new avenues for funding of companies (including capital markets)\nhave a better chance of realization.\n\n55.\nThe  Project  contains  a  mix  of  loan  and  TA  grant-funded  components  for  advisory\nservices,  with  TA  proposed  under  an  associated  TA  cluster.  The  loan  and  TA-funded\ncomponents  blend  and  complement  each  other.  Using  a  process  approach,  at  a  conceptual\nlevel  ADB\u2019s  overall  assistance  package  for  the  Project  also  comprises  the  TAs  approved  in\n1999 and 2000 for strengthening accounting and auditing; review of company, insolvency, and\nsecured transaction law; and reform coordination (footnotes 2 and 3, and Table 1).\n\nTable 1: ADB Assistance (ongoing and proposed)a\n\nLoan Financed\n\nAssistance Area\n1.

Some components, such as adoption of international accounting standards, streamlining\nof legislation, or strengthening the capacity of NRB, will have wider sector implications and will\nbe appropriately coordinated with other aid agencies, particularly the IMF and World Bank.\n\n57.\n\nSpecifically, the proposed Project includes the following:\n\n1.\n\nImproving Legal and Regulatory Framework, Standards, and Policies\n\nImproving  the  basic  legislative,  and  regulatory  framework  as  well  as  policies  and\n58.\nstandards is the fundamental step in a longer term reform process. In terms of sequencing, this\narea must be addressed first before assistance is provided on the institutional level. ADB has\nalready initiated steps in this regard under the ongoing TAs. Further assistance will be provided\nunder the proposed TA cluster.\n\na.\n\nUpgrading of Selected Legislation\n\n59.\nPast  and  ongoing  assistance  to  strengthen  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for\ncorporate  governance  has  included  support  in  drafting  the  Securities  Act  (TA  2834:  Capital\nMarket Development), and support for reform of the company law, insolvency law, and secured\ntransactions law (footnote 2).\n\n60.\nThe  new  Securities  Act,  currently  in  draft  form,  will  establish  the  Nepal  SEBO  as  an\nindependent statutory body and provide for a legal and regulatory framework for registration and\nissuance  of  securities,  licensing,  and  regulation  of  stock  exchanges  and  those  engaged  in\nsecurities business, and curbing of malpractices including insider trading.\n\n61.\nReform of the company law, under TA 3461, will strengthen disclosure requirements for\ncompanies.  It  will  introduce  provisions  to  regulate  self-dealing  by  directors  and  controlling\nshareholders,  and  strengthen  minority  shareholders\u2019  rights,  allowing  representative  actions  by\nminority  shareholders  to  enforce  good  corporate  governance.  Presently  charges  over  a\ncompany\u2019s assets are not registered with the company registrar. Such registration will need to\nbe  compulsory  to  create  transparency  for  those  dealing  with  companies.  Reform  of  the\ncompany law will also include examining of the role of the various agencies and offices involved\nin implementing the company law, including the CRO, the Company Law Board (CLB), SEBO,\nand  the  courts,  so  as  to  rationalize  the  institutional  arrangements  for  administering  and\nenforcing of the company law.\n\n62.\nThe support for drafting of insolvency and secured transaction legislation, also under TA\n3461, will ensure an orderly process for exit or restructuring of companies in financial difficulties,\nand  strengthen  the  collateralization  process  for  movable  assets.  This  will  contribute  to  good\ncorporate  governance  as  the  potential  use  of  efficient  insolvency  and  debt  enforcement\nprocedures will discipline firms to contract only debts that they can service.\n\nHMGN, with support from other aid agencies, has initiated a number of other legislative\n63.\nreform  initiatives.  Most  important  is  the  review  of  the  NRB  Act and  development  of  an  unified\nFinancial Institutions Act covering all institutions involved in lending and deposit taking activities.\nADB  has  been  requested  to  provide  inputs  into  the  drafting  process  to  ensure  consistency\nparticularly with regard to the securities, companies, and insolvency laws.\n\n\f18\n\n64.\nEven  with  the  ongoing  activities,  numerous  inconsistencies  and  contradictions  in\ncommercial, corporate, and financial legislation remain. Under TA1 of the TA cluster, assistance\nwill be provided to further streamline commercial and financial laws as required, such as laws\nrelating  to  rural  and  microfinance,  IT  and  e-commerce-related  activities,  and  legislation  to\nmandate  the  boards  and  the  standards  they  set.  HMGN  is  considering  reconstituting  the  Law\nReform  Commission  to  institutionalize  the  reform  process.  Depending  on  the  pace  at  which\nHMGN moves, assistance may be provided to the Law Reform Commission.\n\nb. \n\nDevelopment of Information Disclosure, and Accounting and\nAuditing Standards\n\n65.\nAssistance is included for improvements in the accounting and auditing standards. The\ncompany law reform provides for an information disclosure system that can serve the needs of\na modern financial system. It will include (i) recognition of an Accounting Standards Board and\nan Auditing Standards Board (ASB/AuSB) - collectively the boards; (ii) recognition of mandatory\ncompliance  with  the  standards  issued  by  these  boards;  (iii)  appropriately  severe  penalties  for\nnoncompliance  with  these  standards;  and  (iv)  recognizing  of  an  office  of  the  chief  accountant\nwithin SEBO and empowering that Office to enforce proper information disclosure and reporting\nby investigating and penalizing any non-compliance.\n\nIn  developing  the  accounting  and  auditing  profession,  the  role  of  ICAN  will  be  crucial.\n66.\nFor ICAN to develop in a professional manner, repeal of the Auditors Act is imperative as the\nact currently provides official recognition to auditors of lower standards. ICAN has submitted to\nMOF  an  amendment  to  the  ICAN  Act  that  will  be  submitted  to  Parliament  during  the  winter\nsession  in  February  2001.  Importantly,  ICAN  agrees  to  accept  all  existing  registered  auditors\n(RAs)  as  ICAN  members  on  a  one-time  exemption  basis  within  six  months  of  repealing  the\nAuditors  Act.  This  is  to  ensure  a  professional  future  for  the  existing  RAs.  Through  TA  3356\n(footnote 2), ICAN is in the process of preparing training programs that will assist these RAs in\nupgrading their skills.\n\n67.\nThe independent accounting and auditing standards boards are being established under\nTA 3356. The boards will at first develop standards based on international accounting standards\n(IAS)  and  international  auditing  standards  (IAuS)  for  the  private  sector  through  a  participatory\nmethod.\n\n68.\nFor  Nepal\u2019s  Government  departments,  the  current  cash-based  accounting  standards\napplied  are  completely  unsuited  to  the  management  of  assets  and  liabilities,  while  auditing\npractices also need to be improved. Moreover, many unrealistic \u201cauditing\u201d duties are set down\nin  disparate  processes  and  legislation,  placing  inappropriate  and  unrealistic  demands  on\nauditors.\n\n69.\nInternationally,  convergence  of  public  and  private  sector  accounting  and  auditing\nstandards is occurring. For example, the International Public Sector Committee (IPSC) has just\nissued eight public sector accounting standards heavily based on IAS. The efforts made under\nTA  3356  will  establish  much  of  the  infrastructure  also  needed  for  the  public  sector.  Once  the\nboards  are  established,  in  addition  to  their  roles  in  relation  to  private  sector  corporate\naccounting  and  auditing  standards,  they  will  be  able  to  develop  accounting  and  auditing\nstandards  for  the  public  sector.  In  carrying  out  this  responsibility,  it  is  presumed  that  the\nfinancial  reporting  and  auditing  requirements  of  the  public  and  private  sectors  will  be  entirely\nconsistent with one another and identical in most instances.\n\n\f19\n\n70.\nIntegration of the public and private sector efforts in accounting and auditing standards\nin  the  medium  to  long  run  will  greatly  facilitate  introduction  of  a  consistent  accounting  and\nauditing  system  in  Nepal.  This  will  ultimately  require  public  sector  entities  to  exhibit  greater\ntransparency  and  accountability,  and  greatly  facilitate  state-owned  enterprise  reform  and\nprivatization,  including  flotation  on  the  stock  exchange.  The  public  sector  claim  that  their\nreporting  should  be  fundamentally  different  from  that  of  the  private  sector  is  difficult  to  justify,\nbut  transitional  strategies  can  move  the  public  sector  to  a  system  based  on  full  accrual\naccounting.\n\nUnder  TA2  of  the  cluster  TA,    the  Auditor  General  and  the  Comptroller  General  of\n71.\nFinance  will  be  assisted  in  moving  towards  uniform  standards.  TA2  will  assist  the  key  public\nsector  entities  in  adopting  internationally  accepted  accounting  standards  issued  by  the  Public\nSector  Committee  of  the  International  Federation  of  Accountants  (IFAC)  and  the  auditing\nstandards  issued  by  the  International  Auditing  Practices  Committee  (IAPC),  by  providing\nintensive  training  activities.  Similarly,  the  accounting  and  auditing  standards  boards  will  be\nacquainted with strategies for broadening the applicability of standards, and, where necessary,\ntheir content, to allow application of the standards to all forms of public sector bodies. TA2 will\ngive  an  initial  opportunity  to  public  sector  entities  and  auditors  to  commence  development  of\nexpertise  and  systems,  with  the  objective  of  upgrading  their  knowledge  and  skills  for  carrying\nout  audits  based  on  a  system  of  full  accrual  accounting,  in  accordance  with  accounting\nstandards similar to those applicable in the private sector. TA2 will identify how this can occur.\n\n2.\n\nCapacity Building for Key Institutions\n\nTo  increase  the  capacity  of  key  regulatory,  supervisory,  and  service  institutions  for\n72.\ncorporate  and  financial  governance,  the  Project  will  support  the  development  of  SEBO,\nstrengthening  and  privatization  of  NEPSE,  establishment  of  CDS \nfor  securities,  and\nimprovements in the operations of CRO. Assistance in this regard will be financed under a loan\ncomponent (component A). In addition, technical support will be provided under the TA cluster\nto  the  boards  and  the  Auditor  General  for  moving  toward  improved  accounting  and  auditing\nstandards  in  the  public  sector,  as  well  as  for  upgrading  the  capacity  of  NRB  to  regulate  and\nsupervise NBFIs and rural finance.17\n\na.\n\nStrengthening SEBO and CRO\n\n73.\nCapacity  building  for  SEBO  under  the  Project  is  required  not  only  for  the  orderly\ndevelopment  of  Nepal\u2019s  still  nascent  capital  market,  but  also  to  enforce  corporate  governance\nand  information  disclosure  provisions.  Disclosure  will  be  crucial  for  increased  transparency  in\nthe  financial  and  corporate  sector,  and  will  boost  business  confidence  and  predictability  in\nbusiness dealings.\n\n74.\nIn defining the scope of the assistance to SEBO, it is important to recognize that SEBO\u2019s\nactivities  at  present  are  confined  to  companies  that  have  listed  securities  and  companies  that\nare  eligible  to  list  them.  SEBO  does  not  deal  with  statutory  corporations.  The  existing\ninstitutional arrangements are inefficient and fraught with potential for regulatory arbitrage as a\nnumber of organizations are involved in regulation of companies\u2019 affairs, including the CRO and\nCLB.  For  SEBO  to  be  effective,  it  must  have  adequate  financial  resources  and  statutory\nautonomy  that  insulate  it  from  political  interference.  The  ongoing  TA  3461  will  formulate\nrecommendations for rationalization of the institutional environment and examine the possibility\n\n17 The World Bank will assist in strengthening NRB\u2019s capacity to regulate and supervise commercial banks.\n\n                  \n\n\f20\n\nof SEBO regulating all companies. Any form of rationalization may need to be phased and will\nrequire recognition of SEBO\u2019s role in developing the corporate sector as a whole.\n\n75.\nTo enable SEBO to effectively supervise capital market activities and enforce corporate\ngovernance and information disclosure provisions, proposed assistance under loan component\nA  will  review  and  strengthen  SEBO\u2019s  organizational  structure.  The  establishment  of  a  chief\naccountant\u2019s  office  for  SEBO  will  be  crucial  to  ensure  that  accounting  and  auditing  standards\nare  observed.  Detailed  outputs  of  the  assistance  will  include  a  corporate  and  financial  plan\nconsistent  with  the  operational  and  financial  independence  of  SEBO,  including  review  of\nresponsibilities, duties, and job descriptions; refinement of performance parameters; setting up\nof  a  management  information  system;  and  further  definition  of  SEBO\u2019s  regulatory  duties.\nAssistance  will  also  develop  various  securities  market  regulations,  allow  skills  transfer  to  key\nSEBO staff, and provide training programs and public awareness strategy. Operations of CRO\nwill be streamlined and automated, to link with the newly automated income tax office to ensure\nconsistency of records and data and to facilitate enforcement.\n\nb.\n\nStrengthening NEPSE and CDS\n\n76.\nNEPSE,  which  is  majority  owned  by  HMGN,  lacks  the  rules,  regulations,  discipline  by\nmarket participants, and systems to instill confidence in the capital market. Support is required\nfor establishing a proper system for registering shares to ensure transparency and efficiency in\nsettlement.\n\nUnder  loan  component  A,  ADB  will  support  the  privatization  of  NEPSE  and  assist  it  to\n77.\ntransparent  governance  and  professional\nbecome  a  self-regulatory  organization  with \nmanagement,  complemented  by  upgrading  of  its  operational  systems  and  procedures.  The\nrelationship between SEBO and NEPSE will be rationalized. To support improved transparency\nin shareholdings and ensure safe custody and settlement of company ownership titles, CDS will\nbe established to operate on a commercial basis.\n\nc.\n\nStrengthening NRB for Regulation of Nonbank Financial Institutions\n\nOver  the  past  decade,  financial  intermediation  activities  in  Nepal\u2019s  rural  areas  have\n78.\nevolved  but  with  distorted  policies  in  a  poorly  regulated  and  supervised  environment.  A  great\nnumber of nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and cooperatives mobilize and lend resources\noutside  the  regulatory  environment,  or  the  applicable  financial  rules  and  regulations  are  not\nenforced.  Poor  enforcement  by  NRB  is  due  to  (i)  insufficient  institutional  capacity;  (ii)  lack  of\nautonomy; (iii) conflicting roles of ownership and supervision of rural financial institutions (RFIs)\nby  NRB;  (iv)  lack  of  focus,  including  NRB\u2019s  involvement  in  developmental  programs;  and  (v)\nmultiplicity of financial laws and regulations. The ongoing comprehensive review of the NRB Act\nand Financial Institutions Act is expected to sharpen the focus of NRB and help clarify its role\nand responsibilities.\n\n79.\nFollowing  the  streamlining  of  the  regulatory  and  policy  environment  for  rural  finance,\nthere is a need to upgrade NRB\u2019s capacity for prudential supervision and enforcement to ensure\nthe sustainable and orderly expansion of the rural finance system.\n\n80.\nCluster  TA3  will  review  the  prevailing  policy  framework  pertaining  to  RFIs  and  rural\nfinance  operations  of  commercial  banks,  especially  as  it  relates  to  institutional  autonomy,\ngovernance, ownership, competition, directed credit, subsidies, and human resources. The TA\nwill  assist  in  further  rationalizing  the  legal  framework  governing  the  operations  of  the  array  of\n\n\f21\n\ninstitutions  involved  in  rural  finance  so  as  to  eliminate  gaps,  ambiguities,  and  overlaps.  It  will\nfurther  assess  the  regulation  and  supervision  needs  of  RFIs;  assess  NRB\u2019s  capacity  for\nregulation,  supervision,  and  enforcement  and  recommend  improvements;  develop  prudential\nnorms, information and disclosure systems, accounting, auditing, and licensing procedures for\nRFIs;  draft  rules  and  regulations  to  regulate  and  supervise  RFIs;  and  formulate  guidelines,\noperational  procedures,  and  standards  for  off-site  and  on-site  inspection,  supervision,  and\nreporting for the rural finance sector.\n\n3.\n\nImproving Legal Enforcement Capacity and Infrastructure\n\n81.\nEnforcing  Nepal\u2019s  legal  system  is  a  key  challenge.  In  a  dynamic  environment  with\nchanging laws and rules, judges, attorneys, and other members of the legal profession need to\nkeep  abreast  of  latest  developments.  There  is  also  need  for  an  institutional  environment  that\nsupports  transparency  as  well  as  rapid  and  fair  enforcement.  Under  loan  component  B,  the\nproposed  Project  will  support  the  (i)  establishment  of  NJA,  (ii)  improvement  of  the  legal\ninformation system, (iii) establishment of a secured transactions registry, and (iv) establishment\nof a special commercial bench.\n\na.\n\nNational Judicial Academy\n\nA  strong  consensus  has  emerged  from  three  major  stakeholders  (the  judiciary,\n82.\ngovernment  lawyers,  and  the  bar)  in  Nepal  for  establishing  a  single  training  academy  that  will\ncater  to  the  needs  of  the  whole  legal  community.  Given  the  small  size  of  each  group  of\nstakeholders,  and  the  lack  of  financial  and  human  resources,  this  was  considered  the  optimal\nsolution  for  Nepal.  The  stakeholders  agree  that  the  NJA  should  be  an  independent  and\nautonomous body established by statute and the governing council chaired by the Chief Justice,\nand that the existing Judicial Training Center be merged with the NJA.\n\nThe  mandate  of  the  NJA  will  be  to  conduct  programs  for  continuing  professional\n83.\neducation, training, and development for judges, court officers, officers exercising quasi-judicial\npowers, public sector legal officers, and members of the private legal profession. To consolidate\nthe independence and integrity of the judiciary, judges will be trained by judges. Lawyers will be\ntrained by lawyers, academics, or judges as required and practicable. The education program\nwill  be  designed  to  provide  practical,  rather  than  theoretical,  training  relevant  to  judicial  and\nlegal officers in their day-to-day duties. The NJA may also offer theoretical courses in new areas\nof  law,  particularly  in  the  commercial  area.  This  training  will  focus  on  substantive  law  and\nprocedure,  forensic  skills,  judicial  management  and  administration,  professional  responsibility,\nand relevant interdisciplinary subjects. Training will be provided at the pre-service (orientation)\nand  in-service  (continuing)  levels,  mainly  through  programs  of  conferences,  seminars,  and\nworkshops; and programs of publishing bench books, practice manuals, digests, and bulletins.\n\n84.\nThe  NJA  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  judiciary  to  develop  and  improve  judicial\npolicies and administration by giving it the role to review and propose developments to improve\ncase  management  and  judicial  administration  practices  and  procedures,  particularly  in\ncommercial law; and to provide training to support these improvements. Particular attention will\nbe  given  to  strengthening  judicial  capacity  to  resolve  commercial  disputes  expeditiously  by\nestablishing  a  commercial  bench  in  an  existing  court.  The  NJA  may  also  incorporate  and\ndevelop  the  collection  of  the  Central  Law  Library,  and  will  provide  research  and  development\nservices to the legal community. A draft Policy and Mandate of the Academy, together with an\norganization chart, is presented in Appendix 3.\n\n\f22\n\n85.\nA draft National Judicial Academy Bill has been formulated. The NJA will regularly report\nto and coordinate with the Judicial Council, a constitutional body charged with appointment and\ndiscipline of judges, to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of its training activities in raising\nthe  competence  and  professional  performance  of  judges.  It  will  similarly  coordinate  with  the\nJudicial  Services  Commission,  a  body  that  appoints  and  disciplines  government  lawyers;  and\nthe Bar Council, a statutory body for regulation of the legal profession, to link training to raising\ncompetence and performance of Government lawyers and private practitioners, respectively.\n\nUnder \n\nloan  component  B, \n\nthe  Project  will  support \n\n86.\nthe  establishment  and\noperationalization of the NJA by financing its building, equipment, development of its curriculum,\nteaching  materials,  and  faculty  development.  The  Project  will  also  support  development  of\nbench  books,  practice  manuals,  and  other  relevant  publications.  The  initial  project  phase  will\ninclude finalization of a detailed needs assessment for the NJA, strategy plan and curriculum,\nestablishment plan, and operational budgets, as well as construction of the building. The Project\nwill also assist in selecting a cadre of trainers, and will design/conduct the faculty development\ninduction  program  including  an  overseas  study  tour  and  train-the-trainer  workshops,  and\ncollaborate with the Judicial Council in setting bench work performance standards.\n\n87.\nOn  completion  of  construction  of  the  NJA  building,  the  Project  will  support  the\ncommencement  of  the  operational  phase,  including  an  18-month  placement  at  the  NJA  of  a\nconsultant  acting  as  counselor  to  senior  staff,  specifically  developing  and  launching  pilot\ncourses, and commissioning and producing new publications. On completion of this placement,\nthe  consultant  will  support  the  NJA  with  two  quarterly  visits  of  two  weeks  each  in  the  second\nyear of operations, and two half-yearly visits of two weeks each in the third year\n\nb.\n\nLegal Information\n\n88.\nUnder  loan  component  B,  the  capacity  of  the  Nepal  Law  Books  Management  Board\n(NLBMB)  within  the  Ministry  of  Law  &  Justice  will  be  expanded  to  improve  access  to  legal\ninformation and reduce information cost. In the initial Project phase, NLBMB\u2019s capacity to serve\nas a central repository of all laws will be enhanced. NLBMB will develop web-based publishing\nof  the  laws  of  Nepal,  giving  priority  to  the  statutes,  and  in  the  later  phases  to  important  new\ncases  of  the  Supreme  Court  and  pre-existing  cases.  ADB  will  also  finance  web-based\npublishing  of  the  statute  laws  and  case  laws  of  Nepal,  equipment,  and  training  to  enable\nNLBMB to publish all the laws of Nepal in a timely fashion on the web, as well as in hard copy.\n\nc.\n\nSecured Transactions Registry\n\n89.\nUnder  loan  component  B,  the  Project  will  support  the  establishment  of  a  secured\ntransactions  registry  (STR)  to  allow  collateralization  of  movable  assets  and  provide  relevant\ninformation  to  the  financial  community,  including  recommendation  on  legal  status  and\nownership;  development  of  information  systems  infrastructure  as  well  as  business  and\noperational  plans:  organization,  financing,  administration,  and  staffing.  The  drafting  of  the\nsecured transactions law under TA 3461 will be a condition for establishment of the STR. The\nproposed loan will finance establishment of the registry procurement of hardware for a modern\nautomated registry and staff training.\n\nd.\n\nSpecial Commercial Bench\n\n90.\nMost stakeholders have expressed the need for a special court to deal with commercial\ncases. The Supreme Court has also recognized this need for special treatment of such cases in\n\n\f23\n\na  recent  report.  Under  loan  component  B,  the  Supreme  Court  will  be  given  assistance  in\nestablishing a special bench for commercial cases, delineating its jurisdiction, and drafting of its\nprocedural rules.\n\n4.\n\nImproving Infrastructure for Payments and Financial Service Delivery\n\n91.\nThe  development  of  Nepal\u2019s  financial  sector  is  hampered  by  its  poor  and  unreliable\ncommunication infrastructure. The regulatory and technological infrastructure must be improved\nto  support  an  efficient  payment  system  as  the  backbone  of  financial  service  delivery.  This  is\nessential to increase competition in financial services, as the cost of information and transaction\ncosts,  including  those  for  operating  bank  branches,  can  be  cut  down  significantly  through\nadequate ICT. This is particularly important for a country such as Nepal, which has a generally\npoor transport system and mountain communities that have traditionally been cut off from each\nother. ICT will also support documentation of the economy.\n\na.\n\nUpgrading of Payments System\n\n92.\nTo  improve  financial  service  delivery  and  competition  under  TA4  of  the  TA  cluster,  the\nProject  will  assist  NRB  to  upgrade  Nepal\u2019s  payment  system.  The  assistance  will  assess  the\ncurrent financial service delivery system and identify gaps between the current capacity of the\npayment system and the requirements of the growing financial and real sectors. It will examine\nthe  current  legal  and  policy  framework,  operating  systems,  institutional  capacity,  information\ntechnology,  and  existing  and  required  staff  skills.  It  will  formulate  recommendations  for  an\nappropriate  institutional  environment,  including  the  necessity  of  establishing  a  Nepal  Payment\nAssociation, and draft regulations as required. It will further develop an implementation plan with\na practical timetable for a medium term upgrade of Nepal\u2019s payment system that will meet the\nneeds  of  businesses,  consumers,  and  financial  institutions  to  transfer  funds.  The  project  will\nalso  assist  in  putting  in  place  effective  safeguards  in  line  with  international  best  practices  in\npreventing money laundering.\n\nb.\n\nSupport of Institutional Infrastructure for ICT Investments in\nFinancial Service Delivery\n\n93.\nA low technological base and poor communication facilities make financial transactions\ncostly and nontransparent. In particular, the absence of a reliable and secure ICT backbone for\ntransmission  of  financial  information  makes  branch  operations  more  costly,  and  thus  hampers\ncompetition. The eventual investment in ICT technology and infrastructure will require extensive\npreparation and  will  be carried  out  under a separate stand-alone project preparatory technical\nassistance (PPTA).18 This will help define and improve the institutional and policy environment\nto support the investment, as well as in costing the investment requirements.\n\n94.\nTo ensure the reliability and data security of the financial services network and to attract\nprivate  sector  investment  to  this  area,  it  is  important  that  the  ICT  backbone  be  operated  and\nmanaged by a competent institution.  Under the Project, it is expected that future investment in\nICT  for  financial  sector  delivery  will  be  channeled  through  a  public-private  joint-venture\ncompany,  which  will  provide  a  high-quality  wireless  data  transmission  backbone  network  for\nfinancial information and transactions on a commercial basis. A joint-venture company will help\nbundling resources to exploit economies of scale in providing a large bandwidth, and the cost-\nefficiencies of a common transmission channel for diverse banking services.\n\n18 TA for ICT for Improved Financial Service Delivery, for $500,000, proposed for approval.\n\n                  \n\n\f24\n\nPrivate sector participation for this will be required as HMGN, with its limited resource, is\n95.\nunlikely  to  respond  to  the  market  needs  in  this  respect.  HGMN  participation  is  required  to\nensure policy consistency, as a number of government institutions are currently involved in ICT\naffairs.  In  this  regard,  HMGN  agreed  to  support  an  appropriate  institutional  coordination\nmechanism  and  to  protect  the  frequency  spectrum  band  for  the  electronic  transmission  of\ninformation.  HMGN  will  also  the  support  the  establishment  of  the  public-private  joint-venture\ncompany to manage this. The domestic banking industry has been consulted on this matter and\nexpressed  very  strong  support  for  such  initiative.  To  operationalize  such  a  joint-venture\ncompany, which is expected as an outcome of the PPTA, funding will be required for the initial\nstart-up activities.\n\n96.\nUnder  loan  component  C,  the  Project  will  provide  a  portion  of  the  loan  proceeds  ($1\nmillion)  to  assist  in  the  start-up  funding  of  a  public-private  ICT  company  (e-FIT),  to  be\nestablished  as  the  outcome  of  the  PPTA.  The  funds  will  cover  immediate  financing  needs  for\nsetting up the institution: key personnel, operational and organizational development, as well as\ntraining,  marketing,  and  human  resource  development.  The  loan  will  only  be  provided  if  the\nviability  of  the  project  is  confirmed,  and  sufficient  private  sector  interest  is  forthcoming  and  a\nshareholder  agreement  concluded.  Future  investment  in  hardware  and  software  for  the\nestablishment  of  the  ICT  backbone  will  only  be  considered  once  the  appropriate  institutional\ninfrastructure, including setting up of e-FIT, has been established. The preparedness to provide\na start-up loan to e-FIT also signals a strong commitment by HMGN to this initiative and will be\nessential if the private sector is to come forward.\n\n5.\n\nRestructuring and Development of Selected Financial Intermediaries\n\na.\n\nDiagnostic Study of ADBN and NIDC\n\nNepal\u2019s financial institutions such as ADBN and NIDC face a severe crisis that needs to\n97.\nbe  resolved.  Institutional  strengthening  measures  at  this  stage  will  have  little  impact  and  will\nrequire  further  improvement  in  the  operating  environment.  But  given  the  importance  of  these\ninstitutions in the financial sector, some basic analytical work for reforming them will need to be\ninitiated. This will complement the work initiated by the World Bank on the reform of the public\nsector commercial banks.\n\n98.\nUnder TA5 of the TA cluster, ADB will support a review of the role of these institutions\nwithin  the  economy  and  an  assessment  of  their  financial  health,  governance  structures,  and\nmanagement strengths and weaknesses. Specifically, assistance will be provided to conduct a\ndetailed audit of both institutions and present an option study for their future direction.\n\nb.\n\nDevelopment of Insurance and Contractual Savings\n\n99.\nDeepening and broadening the financial sector require orderly growth and expansion of\ninsurance, pension, and other forms of contractual savings. This growth necessitates a sound\nregulatory  environment  under  a  legal  framework,  and  strengthening  the  capacity  of  regulatory\norganizations  for  prudential  supervision  and  protection\u2019s  of  investors  and  policyholders  in\nrelation to sophisticated financial products.\n\n100. Under TA6 of the TA cluster, the Project will support the development of an appropriate\ninstitutional  and  policy  framework  for  regulating  insurance,  pension,  and  other  types  of\ncontractual  savings  including  investment  trust,  so  as  to  broaden  the  financial  sector  and\n\n\f25\n\nincrease the growth of insurance, pension, and provident funds. It will also assess the existing\ninstitutions operating in the subsector, e.g., the National Insurance Corporation and Employees\nProvident Fund, and formulate recommendations for their institutional development.\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n101.\n  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  about  $13.3  million  equivalent,  including\nphysical and price contingencies and taxes and duties. The total foreign exchange cost is about\n$7.9  million  (59  percent  of  the  project  cost),  primarily  for  services  of  international  consultants\nand ICT equipment. The local currency cost is about $5.4 million equivalent (41 percent of the\nproject  cost),  primarily  for  domestic  consultant  inputs,  minor  civil  works  as  well  as  taxes  and\nduties. The Project cost estimates are summarized in Table 2, and details are in Appendix 4.\n\nTable 2: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nItem\n\nForeign  \nExchange\n\nLocal  \nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nA.

A  loan  in  various  currencies  of  about  $7.3  million  equivalent  is  proposed  from  ADB\u2019s\nSpecial  Funds  resources  to  finance  the  consultant  and  procurement  packages  under  sub-\ncomponents 2(a) and 3, as well as onlending under subcomponent 4(b). The loan will carry a\nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1 percent per\nannum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter. The Borrower will be the\nKingdom  of  Nepal.  In  addition,  a  grant  of  $3.3  million  equivalent  from  the  ADB-funded  TA\nProgram  is  proposed  to  finance  a  cluster  of  various  TA  activities  under  assistance  areas  1,\n2(b), 4(a), and 5 (Table 1). ADB will finance the entire foreign exchange cost of the Project, as\nwell as a portion of the local currency cost. Total financing by ADB is about 79.2 percent of the\ntotal Project cost. It is 78.1 percent for the loan-financed component and 84.5 percent for the\ngrant-financed  component.  A  summary  of  the  financing  plan  is  in  Table  3,  with  details  in\nAppendix 5.\n\nSource\n\nTable 3: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal  \nCurrency\n\nAsian Development Bank Loan\nAsian Development Bank Grant\n(TA cluster)\nGovernment\nTotal\n\n5.1\n\n 2.8\n0.0\n7.9\n\n2.2\n\n0.5\n2.7\n5.4\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n7.3\n\n3.3\n2.7\n13.3\n\nPercent\n\n 54.9\n\n24.8\n20.3\n100.0\n\nThe Government has requested partial financing of local currency expenditures as well\n103.\nas grant financing which is considered necessary in view of the Government\u2019s limited capacity\nto  generate  internal  resources  to  meet  all  expenditure  requirements,  and  the  high  consultant\ninputs required for capacity building. Nepal has one of the lowest ratios of tax collection to GDP\n(about 8 percent of GDP) among ADB\u2019s member countries, but it recently introduced a number\nof  reforms  and  initiatives  to  improve  this  situation,  which  will  further  be  reinforced  by  the\nProject. Moreover, grant financing through the ADB-funded TA Program does allow for greater\nflexibility in project implementation. The Government will finance about $2.7 million equivalent\nof the local currency cost, including provision of land for the National Judicial Academy.\n\nE.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\nthe  ultimate  success  and\n104. Effective \ndevelopment impact of the Project. For maximum project impact, the implementation arrangements\nwill be structured along three guiding principles:\n\nimplementation  arrangements  are  crucial \n\nfor \n\n(i) \n\nminimize  administrative  burden  for  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  and  Implementing\nAgencies (IAs);\n\n(ii) \n\nmaximize sense of project ownership by skills transfer to IAs; and\n\n(iii)  maximize accountability and minimize scope for misuse of funds.\n\n\f1.\n\nProject Organization\n\n27\n\n105. MOF as EA will be responsible for overall coordination of the project activities. MOF will\nadminister  the  loan  proceeds  monitor  their  utilization,  and  interface  with  ADB  and  the  IAs  on\nproject  administration  matters.  MOF  will  also  follow  up  on  reporting  requirements  to  monitor\nimplementation  progress.  MOF  will  regularly  (and  at  least  on  a  quarterly  basis)  convene\nmeetings  of  the  project  steering  committee  which  includes  private  sector  representatives,  to\nreview  overall  progress  in  implementation  and  to  seek  shareholder  feedback.19  To  ensure\ndissemination of information on the reform process and discussion among stakeholders and aid\nsources, a project web site was established (www.neat.net.np) and will be updated regularly to\nensure proper integration in HMGN\u2019s overall reform program for the financial sector.\n\n106.\nTo  perform  its  functions  as  EA,  MOF  will  nominate  a  senior  official  as  project  director,\nwho  will  be  supported  by  administrative  staff  to  function  as  the  project  coordination  and\nmonitoring  unit  (PCMU).  Given  the  modular  structure  of  the  Project,  which  has  only  limited\nprocurement  and  other  administrative  requirements,  while  operational  interaction  with  the\nconsultants  will  be  performed  by  the  IAs,  it  is  expected  that  involvement  of  PCMU  will  be\nminimal,  and  more  of  a  periodic  nature.  The  role  of  EA  is  above  all  one  of  coordination,\noversight, and accountability. It is expected that staff resources for this can be allocated among\nexisting MOF staff, with operational support from the TA on financial sector reform (footnote 3).\n\n107.\nTo ensure a strong sense of project ownership and skills transfer to the IAs who are the\ndirect beneficiaries of the assistance, close interaction between the consultants and key staff in\nthe IAs is important. This requires close involvement of the IAs in consultant selection, effective\noperational interaction, and provision of an adequate working environment.\n\n108.\nTo  formalize  the  working  and  reporting  relationships  between  the  IAs  and  PCMU,  a\nproject  implementation  team  will  be  formed  for  each  project  component  related  to  corporate\ngovernance  and  capital  markets  (component  A)  and  NJA  and  legal  strengthening  (component\nB). Each team will be headed by a senior official as the team leader who should be a member of\nthe  steering  committee,  as  well  as  senior  officials  from  the  other  IAs  involved  in  project\nimplementation. For component A, these will be SEBO, NEPSE, and CRO. For component B,\nthese will be the Supreme Court and Ministry of Law and Justice.\n\n109. Specifically, the project implementation teams will:\n\n(i) \n\n(iv) \n\n(ii) \n(iii)  monitor \n\nlead  the  consultant  selection  process  for  the  respective  components,  including\npreparation of a long list, shortlist, and selection criteria;\ninteract with the consulting teams to produce outputs as agreed;\n\nresource \n\ninputs, \n\nincluding  verifying  consultant \n\ntimesheets  and\n\nwithdrawals from the imprest account for eligible project activities; and\nprepare  progress  implementation  reports  to  be  submitted  to  PCMU  for  wider\ndistribution.\n\n110. As is the case for the PCMU, required staff resources will come from the existing staff of\nthe  IAs.  For  handling  administrative  matters  related  to  the  activities  outlined  above  and  to\n\n                  \n\n19  The  steering  committee  was  established  in  January  2000  with  private  sector  participation.  Regular  consultation\nbetween the Government and the private sector initiated during the design and processing phase of this Project will\nbe  extended  to  the  implementation  phase  of  the  Project.  Subcommittees  have  been  formed  to  provide  guidance\nand stakeholder consultation on policy matters.\n\n\f28\n\nperform as secretary to the respective project implementation teams, SEBO and the Supreme\nCourt  will  each  assign  one  of  its  staff.  ADB  will  familiarize  this  staff  with  ADB\u2019s  procurement,\ndisbursement, and reporting requirements.\n\n111.\nFor  the  TA  components,  the  respective  line  ministries  will  be  the  IAs  and  will  report\nimplementation  progress  to  the  steering  committee.  An  organization  chart  outlining  project\nimplementation and coordination arrangements is in Appendix 6.\n\n2.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n112.\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  48  months  from  loan  effectiveness,  starting  in\nearly  2001  with  completion  by  December  2004.  Initial  activities  will  focus  on  selection  and\nrecruitment  of  loan  consultants  for  the  two  components  covered.  The  overall  project\nimplementation  schedule  is  summarized  in  Appendix  7.  The  implementation  schedule  and\narrangements will be reviewed and details provided after the consultants are fielded.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement of Goods and Services\n\n113. Procurement  of  goods  and  services  out  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  follow  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement.  Supply  contracts  for  equipment  and  materials  will  generally  be\nawarded on international competitive bidding for packages with over $500,000 aggregate value,\ninternational  shopping  for  packages  costing  over  $100,000,  and  local  competitive  bidding  or\nlocal shopping, in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB, for other items, except minor\nitems  for  which  off-the-shelf  purchases  will  be  permitted.  Computer  hardware  and  software,\nincluding  software  development,  will  be  procured  under  the  contract  with  the  consultants\nselected under loan components A and B, in accordance with ADB procedures. Any civil works\nfinanced under the loan for establishing NJA in loan component B will be for a turnkey contract\non  a  local  competitive  basis  as  the  cost  is  less  than  $5  million.  A  procurement  selection\ncommittee will choose the contractor.\n\n114. MOF  and  the  IAs  will  ensure  that  goods  and  services  procured  are  reasonably  priced\nand suitable for the project activities, and that fair canvassing is done and normal commercial\npractices  are  followed  in  selecting  suppliers  in  the  case  of  international  or  local  shopping.\nBefore procuring any goods and services, the EA will submit to ADB for its concurrence a list of\nequipment, quotations obtained from at least three suppliers (for international shopping from at\nleast two ADB member countries), and justification for selection.\n\n115.\nThe  loan  will  finance  of  consulting  services  for  policy  advice,  institutional  development\nand  training,  preparation  of  ICT  solutions,  and  project  management.  It  is  estimated  that  about\n87 person-months of international and 152 person-months of domestic consulting services will\nbe required. Consultants will be recruited in two bidding packages for loan components A and\nB, in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for engagement of domestic consultants. The required expertise and outline\nterms of reference are attached as Appendix 8.\n\n4.\n\nDisbursement Procedures\n\n116.\nImmediately  after  loan  effectiveness,  the  EA  will  establish  an  imprest  fund  account  for\ndisbursement of the loan proceeds. The IAs will use the account to pay suppliers of minor items\nas well as organizers of workshops and for attendance at training events under the Project. The\nimprest  account  will  be  operated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement Handbook.\n\n\f29\n\nAdvances  to  the  imprest  account  will  be  based  on  MOF\u2019s  projected  expenditures.  ADB\u2019s\nstatement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be  used  to  liquidate  advances  and  replenish  the\nimprest account. Payment for consulting services and computer equipment, including software\ndevelopment contracts, as well as civil works will follow ADB\u2019s direct payment procedures. This\nwill minimize the administrative burden on the EA and IAs. The Government contribution to the\nProject will be provided through the annual budget process and in a project account.\n\n5.\n\nRelending Arrangements\n\n117. Under a subsidiary loan agreement, the Borrower will relend up to $1 million of the loan\nrelating  to  the  public-private  sector  joint-venture  company  to  be  established  under  the  Project\nfor  operating  the  ICT  infrastructure  (component  C).  The  proceeds  will  finance  start-up  costs\nincluding  key  personnel,  operational  and  organizational  development,  as  well  as  training  and\nsocial mobilization needs. The subsidiary loan agreement with the joint-venture company will be\ndenominated in Nepalese rupees with a maturity of up to seven years including a grace period\nof  up  to  three  years.  The  foreign  exchange  risk  will  be  borne  by  HMGN  as  the  Project  is\nexpected to generate revenues in local currency only. The rate of interest for the re-lent portion\nwill not be less than that applicable to loans from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources.\n\n6.\n\nReports and Reviews\n\n118.\nTo ensure proper monitoring of fund utilization and effective progress in implementation,\nimplementation  teams  will  submit  regular  reports  to  PCMU  for  wider  distribution  among\nstakeholders. MOF will submit to ADB quarterly progress reports on overall progress in project\nimplementation in line with the project framework and in a form and level of detail satisfactory to\nADB. The quarterly progress report will be submitted to ADB within four weeks after the end of\nthe  relevant  quarter.  Within  three  months  of  substantial  project  completion,  MOF  will  prepare\nand  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report.  ADB  and  HMGN  will  jointly  conduct  review\nmissions  at  least  twice  a  year.  A  project  inception  mission  will  take  place  after  loan\neffectiveness  to  ensure  that  delays  during  the  start-up  phase  are  avoided.  A  comprehensive\nmidterm  review  18  months  after  project  inception  will  examine  all  aspects  of  project\nimplementation.  The  review  will  focus  on  (i)  the  performance  of  the  EA  and  IAs,  and\ncoordination  issues;  (ii)  the  performance  of  the  consultants;  (iii)  progress  in  disbursement  and\nadequacy of implementation arrangements; (iv) policy constraints in project implementation; and\n(v)  initial  project  impact.  In  addition,  feedback  from  beneficiaries  will  be  sought  through\noccasional workshops and regular meetings of the project steering committee.\n\n7.\n\nAccounts and Audit\n\n119. MOF and the IAs will establish and maintain separate accounts for expenditures under\nthe  Project  in  accordance  with  accounting  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  All  financial\ntransactions  will  be  recorded  in  the  project  account  in  a  manner  that  allows  identification  of\nexpenditures on the project facilities provided under the loan.\n\nThe  financial  statements  by  MOF  and  the  IAs  on  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  will  be\n120.\naudited  annually  by  an  accounting  firm  acceptable  to  ADB.  Certified  copies  of  the  audited\naccounts and financial statements will be submitted to ADB in the English language within six\nmonths after the end of each fiscal year.  Any delay in submission of such audited accounts and\nfinancial statements may result in suspension or cancellation of the loan.\n\n\f8.\n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n30\n\n121.\nTo ensure effective utilization of the funds and adequate development impact, including\nskills transfer, performance parameters will be established for the key agencies benefiting from\nthe  capacity  building  components.  They  will  be  monitored  annually.  A  set  of  detailed\nperformance criteria is in Appendix 9.\n\n122.  Throughout the life of the Project, civil society, as representatives of the consumers and\npotential consumers of judicial and legal services, will be consulted to assess public confidence\nin  the  quality  of  service  provision,  need  for  professional  development,  and  effectiveness  of\ntraining provided.\n\n123. Progress in implementing this program will be independently monitored and evaluated at\nthe completion of the first, second, and third years of operation, in addition to regular reporting\nto and liaising with the Judicial Council, the Judicial Services Commission, and the Nepal Bar\nCouncil,  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  education  services  in  improving  the  professional\ncompetence and performance of judges, government lawyers, and private practitioners.\n\n124. With specific reference to judges, a performance management system will be introduced\nin  liaison  with  the  Judicial  Council  to  implement  and  monitor  bench  work  performance\nstandards,  as  part  of  a  related  merit-based  approach  to  judicial  appointment  being  introduced\nby  the  Judicial  Council  under  powers  invested  by  the  Constitution.  Similar  performance\nmanagement systems will be introduced in the Judicial Services Commission and the Nepal Bar\nCouncil  to  monitor  improvements  in  the  performance  of  government  lawyers  and  private\npractitioners, respectively.\n\n125. Key performance parameters for other agencies benefiting from assistance under the TA\ncluster  will  be  established  at  the  beginning  of  each  TA,  depending  on  the  scope  of  NRB\u2019s\nmandate in this area after revision of the NRB Act. For example, for ICAN, performance may be\nmonitored annually against key criteria such as (i) progress in implementing its business plan,\n(ii)  increases  in  application  for  membership,  (iii)  number  of  accountants  trained  and  training\ncourses offered, (iv) output of the proposed accounting and auditing standards boards, and (v)\nthe activity level of its disciplinary committee.\n\n126. Continued  feedback  and  participation  by  the  private  sector  and  other  beneficiaries  will\nbe sought throughout implementation. For this purpose workshops and stakeholder forums will\nbe organized.\n\nF.\n\nThe Executing Agency\n\nThe EA will be MOF, through its Economic Affairs Division. MOF and NRB are the key\n127.\nagencies  involved  in  the  financial  sector  reform  program  in  Nepal.    MOF  has  considerable\nexperience with administering ADB and other externally funded projects. Currently, it is EA for\nTA  3356  for  strengthening  the  accounting  and  auditing  profession  (footnote  2).  MOF  will  be\nsupported  by  NRB,  SEBO,  Ministry  of  Industry  (MOI),  Ministry  of  Law  and  Justice,  Supreme\nCourt,  and  Ministry  of  Information  and  Communication  (MOIC)  as  IAs.  While  NRB,  MOI,  and\nMOIC have reasonable experience in implementing externally funded projects, the experience\nof SEBO and the Supreme Court is limited. However, SEBO has performed well as the EA for\nTA 2834 for capital markets development. Due to MOF\u2019s many ongoing commitments and the\ncomplex nature of the Project, institutional support has been provided under TA 3371 (footnote\n3) to assist MOF with the wider scope and responsibilities under the Project.\n\n\f31\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n128.\nThe Project will have no direct environmental impact; therefore no mitigating measures\nare required. Longer term environmental and social impacts will result from a general increase\nin living standards, and more open communication and access to information. Expected social\nimpacts are discussed in paras. 131-134.\n\nH.\n\nTechnical Assistance\n\n129.\nFor assistance in implementing, on an urgent basis, the key measures related to policy\nreforms and transparency of the legal framework; improving accounting and auditing standards\nin the public sector; strengthening NRB to regulate and supervise rural finance; upgrading the\npayment system; and developing selected market participants, including ADBN and NIDC, the\nGovernment  requested  an  umbrella  TA  for  Corporate  and  Financial  Governance  Institutional\nSupport,  with  sub-TAs,  under  ADB\u2019s  cluster  modality  for  a  total  amount  of  $3.3  million  on  a\ngrant basis from the ADB-funded TA Program. Specifically, the proposed TA will comprise the\nfollowing:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\nTA1:  Streamlining  of  Financial,  Corporate  and  Commercial  Legislation\n($250,000);\nTA2:  Improved  Accounting  and  Auditing  Standards  in  the  Public  Sector\n($250,000)\nTA3: Institutional Strengthening of NRB for Regulation and Supervision of Rural\nFinance ($800,000)\nTA4: Development of Nepal\u2019s Payment System ($400,000)\nTA5: Financial and Operational Review of ADBN and NIDC ($850,000); and\nTA6: Development of Insurance, Pensions, and Contractual Savings ($750,000).\n\n130. Detailed  scope  and  implementation  arrangements  will  be  finalized  before  the  start  of\neach subproject, based on the outlined scope and indicative budget, and will be subject to close\nscrutiny prior to approval by ADB\u2019s Management. Upon the start of implementation of each sub-\nproject,  ADB\u2019s  Board  will  be  informed  of  overall  progress  of  the  cluster  through  a  brief\ninformation  paper.  The  objectives,  scope,  and  terms  of  reference  for  the  six  sub-TAs  are\noutlined in Appendix 10.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nPoverty Reduction and Socioeconomic Impact\n\n131.\nThe  Project  will  reinforce  the  basic  fundamentals  for  a  robust  and  efficient  financial\nsector. It will increase transparency, accountability, and better governance standards as well as\nlaw enforcement. More reliable financial information to the public will reduce the scope for rent-\nseeking  opportunities  of  individuals  through  a  monopoly  of  information  at  the  expense  of  the\nlarger  society.  Access  to  information  and  justice  is  often  excessively  priced  for  the  poorest\nsegment  of  the  population.  Initial  work  for  upgrading  the  payments  systems  and  creating  the\nenabling environment for development of ICT infrastructure will promote competition and further\ngrowth in service delivery. It will also include measures to prevent money laundering.\n\n\f32\n\n132. A better regulatory and institutional framework will also increase stability of the financial\nsystem  and  make  it  more  robust  against  any  financial  crisis.  This  will  reduce  the  risk  of  a\nnegative socioeconomic impact associated with a financial crisis, which is most severe for the\npoorest segment of the population.\n\nThe Project is part of a longer term development process for private and financial sector\n133.\ndevelopment. A computable general equilibrium model as well as international comparison with\nother  reform  countries  indicates  that  comprehensive  financial  sector  reform  will  boost  Nepal\u2019s\nannual  gross  domestic  product  growth  by  about  2  percent  \u2013  or  $100  million  per  annum.\nImportantly, growth will be even stronger in rural areas as any ensuing investment will raise the\ndemand for rural labor, especially in the most labor-intensive activities.\n\n134.\nThe Project supports primarily regulatory and institutional development and has limited\ndirect impact on individual beneficiaries. In a wider sense, changes in Nepal\u2019s social fabric are\nexpected over the longer term as economic growth and more transparency in information result\nfrom the Project. The shift toward more formal economic patterns and industrialization following\nimproved  financial  intermediation  are  often  accompanied  by  increasing  urbanization  and\nassociated  social  implications,  including  social  protection  patterns.  The  Project  includes\npreparatory  work  for  future  investments  in  ICT,  which  will,  in  the  longer  term,  support\nintroduction  of  e-banking  and  e-commerce.  The  longer  term  social  impacts  of  internet\ntechnology in particularly for remote societies are not yet well known. Additional work is needed\nto  better  understand  how  the  benefits  of  new  IT  applications  can  best  be  put  to  use  in  SMEs\nand  other  low-income  customers,  and  its  social  implications.  Initial  research  findings  suggest\nthat, in some cases, this can lead to disruption of long-standing power structures and traditional\npatterns, particularly for hierarchical societies. 20\n\nB.\n\nRisks\n\n135. Policy reversal and loss of momentum. The principal risk associated with the Project\nis that of policy reversal. To bring about sustained improvement, a long-term vision and strong\ncommitment  to  reform  and  development  in  a  number  of  areas  are  required.  Although  the\nGovernment has expressed a clear commitment to comprehensive reform, the political situation\nis  fragile  and  any  measures  that  cut  the  existing  privileges  of  selected  groups  are  subject  to\npolitical  exploitation.  Moreover,  many  benefits  of  the  project  initiatives  may  only  occur  in  the\nmedium  to  longer  term  and  enthusiasm  for  the  reform  process  may  fade.  An  active\ncommunications strategy will be pursued, including a series of consultative workshops to muster\nwider  stakeholder  support.  In  addition,  the  inclusion  of  private  sector  representatives  in  the\nproject steering committee makes the Project less vulnerable to changes in Government.\n\n136.\nLimited  implementation  capacity.  The  Project  covers  a  wide  range  of  activities\ninvolving  a  number  of  IAs.  However,  given  the  multidimensional  aspect  of  financial  and\ncorporate governance, developing of a sustainable financial system needs a holistic approach\nwith proper sequencing and a realistic time frame over a longer term than in the project horizon.\nTo  ensure  proper  coordination  and  implementation,  TA  3371  (footnote  3)  is  assisting  MOF  in\neffectively  coordinating  and  monitoring  financial  sector  reforms,  as  well  as  organizing\nconsultative workshops for continued feedback. An internet web site has been created to keep\nall parties updated on progress and developments under the Project. Beneficiaries have been\ninvolved from an early stage in project design and a steering committee with adequately staffed\n\n                  \n\n20 \n\nSee New York Times, When Villages Go Global \u2013 How a Byte of Knowledge Can Be Dangerous, too; 23 April\n2000.\n\n\f33\n\nspecialized subcommittees has been created. In addition, ADB will conduct at least two annual\nreview missions.\n\n137. Effective skills transfer by consultants. The institutional capacity in Nepal\u2019s financial\nsector is extremely weak and expertise available domestically is limited. Capacity building, one\nof the key project outputs, requires significant consultant inputs. The consulting expertise will be\nprimarily  for  hands-on  work  in  establishing  systems,  rules  and  procedures,  as  well  as\ntransferring  knowledge  to  local  counterparts,  and  only  to  a  lesser  extent  for  additional  studies\nand  review.  Clear  performance  measurement  standards  have  been  established  to  ensure\nmeasurable progress.\n\n138. Delays  in  establishing  the  public/private  partnership  company  (eFIT).  The  Project\nenvisages  onlending  to  a  public-private  joint-venture  company  with  majority  private  sector\nparticipation that is still to be established. The Government has assured its full support to this\nventure and a PPTA has detailed the investment parameters (footnote 18). The loan component\nfor this will be disbursed only if sufficient investor interest is mustered and due diligence carried\nout on the financial sustainability of the proposed company.\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\n139.

Old legislation covering these areas will be repealed, as necessary.\n\nHMGN  will  issue  a  gazette  notification  to  bring  into  force  the  Judicial  Fund  Act\n1986  so  that  the  Fund  can,  among  other  things,  be  used  for  developing  the\njudiciary, including training requirements, to ensure sustainability of the NJA.\n\nInstitutional and organizational arrangements for regulation of companies will be\nrationalized,  including  possible  merger  or  reorganization  of  SEBO,  CRO,  and\nCompany Law Board, on the basis of the findings under TA 3461 (footnote 2).\n\nInterest  rates  and  branch  licensing  policies  will  be  rationalized,  and  priority  and\ndirected credit sector lending requirements reviewed by 30 June 2001.\n\nBy 31 December 2002, finalize fair tax treatment based on certified accounts that\ngives  minimal  discretionary  powers  to  income  tax  officials  for  companies  that\nsubmit  themselves  to  higher  disclosure  requirements,  including  an  audit  of\n\n\f(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n34\n\naccounts  through  chartered  accountants  who  are  members  of  ICAN,  and\nsupervision by SEBO.\n\n(vii)  Ownership of and control over NEPSE will be transferred to the private sector by\n\n31 December 2002.\n\n(viii)  The  NJA  will  be  established  under  the  auspices  of  the  Supreme  Court  and\n\nbudgetary allocation for the judiciary will gradually be increased.\n\nThe  Nepal  Payments  Association  will  be  created,  or  alternative  institutional\narrangements  as  recommended  under  the  TA  cluster  will  be  adopted,  to\ncoordinate  development  of  the  payments  system,  electronic  funds  transfer,  and\nclearing and settlement under supervision of NRB, in coordination with the Nepal\nBankers\u2019 Association.\n\nThe  radio  frequency  spectrum  band  for  electronic  transmission  of  information\nthrough the financial very small aperture terminal communication network will be\nprotected.\n\nThe  Government  will  support  the  establishment  of  a  public-private  joint-venture\ncompany  -  if  found  viable  -  to  establish,  operate,  and  maintain  the  ICT  network\nand services.\n\nB.\n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness\n\n140.\n\nThe Project will be declared effective when Cabinet:\n\napproves  tabling  of  the  Nepal  Chartered  Accountants  Bill,  acceptable  to  ADB,\nthat would, among others, lead to the repeal of the Auditors Act - thus allowing\nICAN  to  be  the  sole  licensing  body  for  accountants  -  and  establishment  of  the\naccounting and auditing standards boards, and\n\napproves  tabling  in  Parliament  a  Securities  Bill,  acceptable  to  ADB,  that\nestablishes an independent SEBO, thus granting security of tenure to members\nof SEBO and allows their removal only for just cause after due process. The draft\nwill  also  ensure  the  financial  autonomy  of  SEBO  by  allowing  registration  and\nother fees levied by SEBO to accrue to the SEBO fund. The bill will provide for\ninvestigation and enforcement of the Securities Law including the establishment\nof the office of the chief accountant in SEBO, headed by a chartered accountant.\n\nC.\n\nConditions for Disbursement\n\n141.\n\nThe following will be conditions for disbursement of the loan for the Project:\n\n(i) \n\nFunds  under  component  B  (National  Judicial  Academy)  will  be  disbursed  only\nwhen the Cabinet approves tabling in Parliament of a bill, acceptable to ADB, for\nestablishing the NJA, and after an adequate plot of land within Kathmandu valley\nhas been allocated for the NJA.\n\n\f35\n\n(ii) \n\nFunds under component C (onlending to a private-public sector joint-venture [e-\nFIT]  to  provide  ICT  for  financial  services)  will  be  disbursed  only  when  a\nshareholding  agreement  with  private  sector  participation  for  establishment  of  e-\nFIT has been concluded, based on a viable business plan developed under the\nPPTA for ICT for improved financial service delivery.\n\nVII.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  technical  assistance  would  comply  with  the\n\n142.\nArticles of Agreement of ADB and recommend that the Board approve:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii)\n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 5,706,000 to\nthe Kingdom of Nepal for the Corporate and Financial Governance Project, with a\nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest charge\nof  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nthereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in\naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the\nBoard; and\n\nthe provision of technical assistance in an amount not exceeding the equivalent\nof  $3.3  million  to  His  Majesty\u2019s  Government  of  the  Kingdom  of  Nepal  for\nStrengthening Corporate and Financial Governance.\n\n21 November 2000\n\nTADAO CHINO\nPresident\n\n\f36\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber\n\nTitle\n\nPage\n\n    Cited on\n(page, para.)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 \n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n \n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nA\n\nB\n\nExternal Assistance Supporting\nFinancial and Corporate Governance\n\nProject Framework\n\nDraft Policy, Mandate and Organization Chart\nof the proposed National Judicial Academy\n\nCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nOrganization Chart\n\nImplementation Chart\n\nOutline Terms of Reference for Consulting \nServices\n\nPerformance Parameters for Benefit Monitoring\n\nObjectives, Scope, and Terms of Reference\nfor TA Cluster\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available on request)\n\n37\n\n38\n\n47\n\n52\n\n53\n\n54\n\n55\n\n56\n\n62\n\n64\n\n  9, 28\n\n15,  51\n\n21 ,  84\n\n25,  101\n\n26,  102\n\n28,  111\n\n28,  112\n\n28,  115\n\n30,  121\n\n31,  130\n\nBackground Note on Nepal\u2019s Financial Sector and Institutions\n\nCGE Model on Welfare and Distribution Impacts of Financial Liberalization in\nNepal\n\n\f37\n\nAppendix 1\n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE SUPPORTING\nFINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nType\n\nYear\nApproved\n\nCommitment\nAmount ($ \u2018000)\n\nInstitution, Project\n\nADB\n\nCapital Market Development\nCapital Market Development II\nFinancial Sector Regulation and Governance\nImprovement of Disclosures and Corporate\n\nTA Grant\nTA Grant\nTA Grant\nTA Grant\n\nCapacity Building for Accounting and Auditing\n\nTA Grant\n\nEstablishing a Focal Point for Financial Sector\n\nCompany and Insolvency Law Reform\n\nTA Grant\nTA Grant\n\nGovernance\n\nProfession\n\nReform\n\nWorld Bank\n\nSecond Structural Adjustment Credit\nBanking Reform Project (RBB)\nReform of Banking Regulation and\n\nStrengthening Supervisory Function of NRB\nProject Preparation Facility for Financial Sector\n\nDevelopment Program\n\nUNDP\n\nStrengthening Accounting and Auditing\n\nCommercial Bank Problem Analysis and\n\nCapabilities\n\nStrategy Study\n\nCommercial Bank Problem Analysis and\n\nStrategy Study, Phase II\n\nLoan\nGrant\n\nGrant\n\nGrant\n\nGrant\n\nGrant\n\nGrant\n\n1992\n1997\n1998\n1998\n\n1999\n\n1999\n2000\n\n1989\n1999\n\n1999\n\n1999\n\n1987\n\n1989\n\n1992\n\nDFID\n\nPrivatization Project\n\nGrant\n\n1997\n\n187\n596\n150\n150\n\n665\n\n150\n250\n\n60,000\n425\n\n92\n\n550\n\n1,010\n\n950\n\n695\n\n3,550\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, DFID = Department for International Development, NRB = Nepal Rastra Bank,\nTA = technical assistance, UNDP = United Nations Development Programme.\n\n\f38\n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\n\nAppendix 2, page 1\n\nDesign Summary\n\nMonitoring Mechanisms\n\nAssumptions and Risks\n\nPerformance Indicators\nand Targets\n\nGoal\n\nDeepen and broaden\nfinancial sector and\nincrease efficiency of\nfinancial intermediation for\ngrowth and equity\n\nPurpose/Objectives\n\n1.

They inhibit effective regulation of the financial sector, and corporate affairs, and\nefficient  conduct  of  business,  resulting  in  increased  business  transaction  costs.  Financial  and\ncorporate  sector  legislation  must  be  streamlined  to  provide  the  much-needed  clarity  to\nregulators  and  businesses.  The  TA  aims  to  support  His  Majesty\u2019s  Government  of  Nepal  in\nreviewing and streamlining corporate, commercial, and financial sector legislation, with a view to\nincorporate international practices.\n\nB.\n\nScope\n\nThe TA will support updating of legislation in areas identified by the Review Committee\n\n2.\nfor Financial and Corporate Legislation. The activities will include the following:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nmake  a  diagnostic  study  of  existing  law  and  issues,  taking  into  account  the\ninstitutional framework for implementation and enforcement;\n\ndevelop  guiding  principles  and  policy  objectives  to  be  addressed  through\nlegislation,  and  conduct  workshops  to  foster  a  participatory  process  in  updating\nlegislation;\n\n(iii)\n\nprovide drafting support for new legislation based on the reform needs identified;\nand\n\n(iv)\n\nmake recommendations to improve the institutional framework for enforcement.\n\nC.\n\nImplementation Arrangements and Consulting Services\n\n3.\nThe  Executing  Agency  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Law  and  Justice,  in  coordination  with  the\nline  ministry  of  the  agency  in  charge  of  administering  the  law  being  reviewed.  The  consulting\nservices  under  the  TA  will  be  carried  out  over  12  months  by  individual  experts  engaged  to\nundertake TA implementation. The consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with\nthe  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  The  TA  will\nrequire  about  10  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  with  expertise  in  areas\nidentified  by  the  Review  Committee  for  Financial  and  Corporate  Legislation,  as  well  as\nexperience  in  developing  new  legislation.  An  additional  20  person-months  of  domestic\nconsulting services in the same disciplines will be required.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nSub-TA 2: Improved Accounting and Auditing Standards in the Public Sector ($250,000)\n\nA.\n\nRationale and Objectives\n\n4.\nThe  Auditor  General  (AG)  was  established  as  a  constitutional  body  under  the  1990\nConstitution of Nepal to audit the accounts of public sector institutions and corporate bodies fully\nowned  by  the  Government.  The  AG  also  issues  directives  to  audit  entities  to  make  proper\narrangements on matters of accounting. Currently, AG has approximately 350 professional staff\nand  a  training  division  with  a  core  group  of  only  three  or  four  trainers.  The  core  trainers  train\ntrainers working in the various divisions of the AG\u2019s office.\n\n5.\nAG received assistance from the World Bank on performance audit and this assistance\nwas completed in November last year. AG at the moment is receiving no further assistance from\nother aid agencies.\n\n6.\nIn  Nepal,  the  current  cash-based  accounting  standards  for  the  public  sector  are\ncompletely unsuited to the management, while the auditing practices are not clearly articulated.\nMoreover,  many  unrealistic  \u201cauditing\u201d  duties  are  set  down  in  separate  pieces  of  legislation,\nplacing  inappropriate  demands  on  auditors.  For  audit  of  Government  accounts,  AG  applies\nstandards approved by the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).\n\nUnder  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  TA  3356:  Capacity  Building  for  the  Accounting  and  Auditing\n7.\nProfession in Nepal, independent accounting and auditing standards boards will be established\nrespectively.  These  boards  will  in  the  first  instance  develop  standards  based  on  international\naccounting    (IAS)  and  auditing  standards  (IAuS)  for  the  private  sector  through  a  participatory\nmethod.\n\n8.\nIn  relation  to  international  experience,  convergence  of  public  and  private  sector\naccounting  and  auditing  standards  is  accepted  as  the  way  to  go.  The  efforts  made  under  TA\n3356  will  also  establish  most  of  the  infrastructure  needed  for  the  public  sector,  i.e.,  once  the\naccounting  and  auditing  standards  boards  are  established.  In  addition  to  their  roles  in  private\nsector corporate accounting and auditing standards, the boards will also develop and establish\naccounting  and  auditing  standards  for  the  public  sector.  In  carrying  out  this  responsibility,\npresumption  is  that  the  financial  reporting  and  auditing  requirements  of  the  public  and  private\nsectors will be consistent with one another.\n\n9.\nFor  Nepal,  integrated  public  and  private  sector  efforts  in  accounting  and  auditing\nstandards in the medium to long run will greatly facilitate introduction of a consistent accounting\nand auditing system. The public sector call that its reporting should be fundamentally different\nfrom that of the private sector is difficult to justify, but transitional strategies will be required to\nmove  the  public  sector  to  a  system  based  on  full  accrual  accounting.  The  Public  Sector\nCommittee  (PSC)  of  IFAC  (International  Federation  of  Accountants)  is  issuing  accounting\nstandards for the public sector based on International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC)\nstandards.1\n\n                  \n\n1  Under  TA  3356,  assistance  to  Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants  of  Nepal  for  accreditation  with  IFAC\nhas been given high priority.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\n10.\nThe  objective  of  the  TA  is  to  assist  Nepal  to  move  toward  improved  accounting  and\nauditing  standards  in  the  public  sector  based  on  the  internationally  accepted  convergence  of\npublic  and  private  sector  accounting  and  auditing  standards.    The  TA  aims  to  familiarize  the\nproposed  accounting  and  auditing  standards  boards,  AG,  and  key  public  sector  entities  with\ninternationally accepted standards issued by PSC of IFAC, the International Auditing Practices\nCommittee  (IAPC),  and  IASC  through  provision  of  intensive  training  activities.  The  TA  will  be\nused as an opportunity to allow public sector entities and auditors to commence development of\nexpertise and systems so as to upgrade their knowledge and skills for carrying out audits based\non a system of full accrual accounting, in accordance with accounting standards similar to those\napplicable in the private sector. The TA also aims to convince the public sector of the need to be\ninvolved in the standard-setting processes from the beginning.\n\nB.\n\nScope\n\n11.\nThe  TA  will  concentrate  on  designing  specific  training  programs  and  giving  intensive\ntraining  to  staff  from  AG  and  other  key  public  entities  in  acquiring  knowledge  of  international\nstandards  on  accounting  and  auditing.  To  be  cost-effective  and  to  ensure  consistency,  it  is\nrecommended  that  the  training  materials  designed  under  TA  3356  be  used  as  reference\nwhenever appropriate. The TA will assist in\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ndeveloping  a  transitional  plan  for  adopting  accounting  and  auditing  standards\nbased on international best practice;\n\ndeveloping  capacity  for  adopting  new  standards  at  various  stages  of  the\ntransitional plan;\n\ndesigning a training program and materials for training of trainers and delivery of\ncertain courses by trainers who have been trained and the Comptroller General\nof Finance;\n\n(iv) \n\ndeveloping and delivering training programs for key staff from AG and other key\npublic entities on core principles of the IASs and IAuSs;\n\n(v) \n\ntraining key AG staff to understand the standard-setting process;\n\n(vi) \n\nassisting  the  independent  accounting  and  auditing  standards  boards  to  be\nestablished,  to  develop  accounting  and  auditing  standards  for  any  significant\naspects of the public sector not covered by specific private sector standards; and\n\n(vii) \n\ndeveloping  a  manual  on  public \npractices/standards, etc.\n\nsector  accounting  and  auditing\n\nC.\n\nImplementation Arrangements and Consulting Services\n\n12.\nThe  Executing  Agency  will  be  the  AG,  in  coordination  with  other  agencies  involved  in\npublic sector accounting issues. The consulting services will be carried out over 10 months. A\nteam  of  one  international  and  one  domestic  professional  accountants  will  be  engaged  to\nundertake TA implementation. The consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 10, page 4\n\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  The  TA  will  require  about  6  person-months  of\ninternational  consulting  services  and  experience  in  international  accounting/auditing  standards\nand delivery of training programs; and 10 person-months of domestic consulting services in the\nsame disciplines.\n\nSub-TA 3: Institutional Strengthening of NRB for Regulation and Supervision of\n\nRural Finance ($800,000)\n\nA.\n\nRationale and Objectives\n\n13.\nOver  the  past  few  years,  financial  intermediation  activities  in  Nepal\u2019s  rural  areas  have\nevolved in a poorly regulated and supervised environment. A great number of nongovernment\noffices  and  cooperatives  mobilize  and  lend  resources  outside  the  regulatory  environment,  or\nfinancial  rules  and  regulations  are  not  being  enforced.  Limited  enforcement  by  Nepal  Rastra\nBank  (NRB),  which  is  entrusted  with  overall  responsibility,  is  due  to  (i)  insufficient  institutional\ncapacity; (ii) lack of autonomy; (iii) conflicting role between ownership of and supervision of rural\nfinancial  institutions  (RFIs)  by  NRB;  (iv)  lack  of  focus,  including  involvement  in  developmental\nprograms;  and  (v)  multiplicity  of  financial  laws  and  regulations.  To  ensure  the  sustainability  of\nthe sector, there is an urgent need to streamline the regulatory environment and upgrade NRB\u2019s\nenforcement capacity. The objective is to improve the regulatory framework for micro and rural\nfinance, and strengthen NRB\u2019s capacities for regulation and prudential supervision, to allow the\norderly expansion of the rural finance system.\n\nB.\n\nScope\n\n14.\n\nThe TA will assist NRB in\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\nreviewing the prevailing policy framework as it pertains to RFIs, and rural finance\noperations  of  other  central  banks,  especially  those  that  relate  to  institutional\nautonomy,  governance,  ownership,  competition,  directed  credit,  subsidies  and\nhuman  resources;  and  then  rationalize  the  legal  framework  governing  the\noperations  of  the  array  of  institutions  with  rural  finance  operations  so  as  to\neliminate gaps, ambiguities, and overlaps;\n\nassessing  the  regulation  and  supervision  needs  of  RFIs,  and  commonality  and\ndifferences in the needs of the commercial banks;\n\nassessing NRB\u2019s capacity for regulation, supervision, and enforcement; and then\nrecommend improvements in organization, as well as regulation and supervision\nsystems;\n\ndeveloping  prudential  norms,  information  and  disclosure  systems,  accounting,\nauditing, and licensing procedures for RFIs;  drafting of rules and regulations to\nregulate and supervise RFIs;\n\nconducting  seminars  for  wider  consultations  on  the  policy,  regulatory,  and\nsupervisory framework;\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 10, page 5\n\n(vi)\n\n(vii)\n\n(viii)\n\nformulating guidelines, operational procedures, and standards for off-site and on-\nsite inspection, supervision, and reporting for the rural finance sector;\n\nassessing  necessary  staff,  skills  and  information  technology  requirements  in\nNRB to implement the recommended regulatory and supervisory system; and\n\ninstalling  basic  information  technology  infrastructure  and  providing  training  and\nskills development to NRB staff to institutionalize the new regulatory framework.\nThis will comprise the holding of seminars for wider consultations on the policy,\nregulatory, and supervisory framework.\n\nC.\n\nImplementation Arrangements and Consulting Services\n\nNRB will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will form a project management unit to\n15.\ncoordinate  the  TA  and  provide  logistic  support.  NRB  will  constitute  a  corporate  and  financial\ngovernance  (CFG)  team  headed  by  a  deputy  governor,  and  including  heads  of  departments\ninvolved with components of the TA. The CFG team will include senior officers (joint secretary\nor  above)  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Ministry  of  Law  and  Justice,\nMinistry of Rural Development, and a member of the National Planning Commission. NRB will\nalso  constitute  small  counterpart  working  groups  to  assist  the  consultants  and  will  assign  two\nfull-time graduate-level computer programmers for data analysis.\n\n16.\nAn international consulting firm will implement the TA. The consultants will be selected\nand  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  The  TA  will\nrequire  about  20  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  in  rural  finance  policy;\nfinancial,  legal,  central  banking  operations;  rural  credit;  management  information  systems;  IT\nsystems; and institutional development; and 20 person-months of domestic consulting services\nin the same disciplines. The consulting services will be carried out over 18 months.\n\nSub-TA 4: Developing Nepal\u2019s Payment System ($400,000)\n\nA.\n\nRationale and Objectives\n\nNepal\u2019s weak payment system fails to provide timely financial resource and information\n17.\ntransfer, thus contributing to high transaction costs. To cut the transaction costs, a major factor\nin promoting real and financial sectors\u2019 growth, it is imperative to upgrade the payment system.\nADB\u2019s  TA  aims  at  examining  the  current  payment  system,  and  forming  a  future  development\ntimetable.\n\n18.\nTo improve financial service delivery, ADB intends to assist in NRB\u2019s efforts to upgrade\nNepal\u2019s  payment  system.  The  TA  will  (i)  assess  the  current  financial  service  delivery  system,\nand (ii) design an implementation plan in upgrading the system to meet the needs of businesses,\nconsumers,  and  financial  institutions  to  transfer  funds,  and  help  NRB  with  macroeconomic\nmanagement.\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 10, page 6\n\nB.\n\nScope\n\n19.\nThe  TA  will  examine  the  current  legal  and  policy  framework,  operating  systems,\ninstitutional  capacity,  IT,  and  staff  skills  in  key  institutions  (NRB  Clearing  House,  the  National\nPayments Association [NPAN], etc.) in Nepal\u2019s financial delivery system. In addition, the TA will\nidentify gaps between the current capacity of the payment system and the requirements of the\ngrowing  financial  and  real  sectors,  and  assess  the  necessity  and  feasibility  of  establishing  the\nNepal Payment Association (NPA). The TA will then propose a detailed and practical timetable\nfor  Nepal\u2019s  payment  system  upgrading.  The  timetable  should  cover  at  least  five  years,  and\nshould  consider  the  social  and  economic  cost  implications  for  all  concerned  parties  including\nNRB,  all  financial  institutions  involved,  and  consumers  (individuals  and  corporate  entities).\nSpecifically, the TA will\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nidentify  the  gaps  between  the  current  capacity  of  the  payment  system  and  the\nrequirements  of  the  growing  financial  and  real  sectors  and  propose  a  long-term\nvision and operational plans for improvement;\n\ninstitutional  arrangements,  human\npropose  policy,  operational  guidelines, \nresource,  and  technical  infrastructure  for  the  NRB  Clearing  House  and  other\npossible  new  institutions,  such  as  the  National  Payments  Council  or  related\nfinancial institutions (especially those which handle credit payments);\n\n(iii) \n\nassess  the  necessity  for  NPA,  and  develop  an  institutional  and  operational\nstructure if needed;\n\n(iv)  make  recommendations  for  upgrading  the  payment  system,  and  design  an\nimplementation  timetable  for  the  upgrading.  The  timetable  should  cover  at  least\nfive years, and should consider the cost implications. It should also be practical in\nNepal, given all constraints;\n\n(v) \n\ndetail  potential  cost  implications  for  all  concerned  parties  including  NRB,  all\nfinancial institutions involved, and consumers (individuals and corporate entities)\nat different payment system upgrading stages; and\n\n(vi) \n\ntrain NRB Clearing House other concerned staff to prepare for system upgrading.\n\n20.\nIn addition, a study tour to one developing and one developed country will be considered\nfor selected NRB Clearing House and other concerned staff to expose them to best practice in\nthe world\u2019s payment systems.\n\nC.\n\nImplementation Arrangements and Consulting Services\n\n21.\nNRB will be the Executing Agency, and will provide counterpart staff and office space to\nassist consultants in their duties. An international consulting firm will be engaged to implement\nthe  TA.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants. The TA will be implemented over four months. It will require nine person-months of\ninternational  experience  with  practical  knowledge  of  legal,  policy,  and  operational  aspects  of\npayment  systems in a developed  country, as well as design  of payment  systems in developing\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 10, page 7\n\ncountries;  and  11  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  with  similar  expertise  and\nknowledge of financial systems.\n\nSub-TA 5: Financial and Operational Review of ADBN and NIDC ($850,000)\n\nA.\n\nRationale and Objectives\n\n22.\nADBN  was  established  in  1968  under  a  special  act  to  finance  agriculture  and\nagroprocessing sectors. As the country's specialized rural and agricultural lending institution, it\noperates through an extensive rural branch and office network of 657 (230 regular branches, 3\ncommercial  banking  branches,  and  424  subproject  offices).2  In  addition,  it  has  23  urban\ncommercial branches, which are primarily for deposit collection. The total savings mobilized by\nthe  commercial  branches  as  of  mid-July  1997  was  NRs8.64  billion  (around  10  percent  of  the\ntotal deposits mobilized by the formal system). The rural branches do not mobilize savings; they\nonly deliver credit.\n\n23.\nADBN is owned and controlled by the Government. Its board has representatives from\nGovernment line ministries, NRB, cooperatives, and individuals nominated by the Government.\nThe  Government  also  appoints  the  chief  executive  (general  manager),  who  is  often  changed\nwith  the  change  in  Government.  ADBN  has  little  autonomy  and  NRB  has  little  control  over  its\nfinancial operation.\n\n24.\nA major problem of ADBN is its diffused focus. As a Government-controlled bank, it has\nimplemented  many  community  development  and  subsidy-laden  programs,  including  promotion\nof  biogas,  rural  electrification,  small  irrigation  development,  and  solar  energy.3  It  recruits  and\nmaintains technical staff for this purpose, but operating costs for these programs have not been\ncomputed.\n\n25.\nThere  have  been  serious  concerns  about  the  financial  structure  and  performance  of\nADBN. Return on total assets has averaged less than 0.27 percent against an acceptable level\nof 4 percent, and return on net worth has averaged 5.71 percent against the acceptable level of\n14  percent.3  Financial  record  keeping  and  auditing  are  not  of  international  standards.  Internal\nmonitoring, evaluation, and the supervision system are weak, as is the system of appraisal and\nfollow-up on loans. It has suffered from high overdues and low recovery rates. The Rural Credit\nReview Study identified inadequate follow-up on loans as one of the main reasons for poor loan\nrecovery  and  stated  that  ADBN  had  not  paid  any  visit  to  43  percent  of  its  borrowers.  Poor\nrecovery,  inefficient  management,  and  proliferation  of  unsound  loans  have  rendered  the\ninstitution nonviable.\n\n26.\nDuring 1996/97, the total rural credit disbursed by all central banks was NRs917 million,\nwhile that disbursed by ADBN was NRs4,023 million. About 78 percent of ADBN\u2019s credit went to\ncrop production (cereal and cash crops), livestock, agro-industry, and agrimarketing. In contrast,\nthe  commercial  banks\u2019  loans  to  agriculture  constitute  a  small  proportion  of  their  total  loan\nportfolio; this proportion declined from 2.5 percent in 1992 to 1.8 percent in 1997/98. In mid-July\n\n                  \n\n2 Including the subproject offices of its Small Farmer Development Program.\n3 About  37,000  biogas  plants,  75,000  small  irrigation  schemes  (both  ground  and  surface),  975  solar\n\nsystems, and 517 rural electrification projects have been installed and financed to date by ADBN.\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 10, page 8\n\n1997  ADBN  accounted  for  nearly  56  percent  of  the  total  rural  outstanding  loans  (NRs13.82\nbillion). Despite its dismal position, ADBN remains by far the single largest rural lending agency\nin  the  formal  banking  system.  There  is  a  need  for  a  detailed  assessment  of  ADBN\u2019s  financial\nsituation,  outlook,  and  options  to  transform  it  into  an  effective  institution  that  can  compete  on\nmarket terms.\n\nB.\n\nScope\n\nThe TA will provide a detailed audit of ADBN\u2019s financial position and operations, and an\n\n27.\noptions study for its future direction. It will\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\nmake a detailed assessment of ADBN\u2019s accounting practices and assessment of\nits  financial  position  and  performance,  including  loan  portfolio  and  reserves,  in\nline with international standards;\n\ndevelop a loan classification system to comply with NRB\u2019s emerging regulations;\n\nreview ADBN\u2019s existing and potential clientele and market environment;\n\nconduct  an  organizational  review  and  management  audit,  including  incentive\nstructures,  governance,  human  resources  and  skills, \nfunctions,\nbudgeting, information systems; establish requirements and recommendations to\nmeet those;\n\ntreasury \n\nreview credit policies and procedures, and develop a basic credit scoring system\nfor credit appraisal; establish credit review committees; and\n\ndevelop  a  strategic  plan  including  vision,  objectives,  target  markets,  products,\nand services in a competitive environment, and list steps required to implement\nthis plan.\n\nC.\n\nImplementation Arrangements and Consulting Services\n\nADBN will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will form a project management unit\n28.\nto coordinate the TA with the activities for financial sector reform, and the steering committee for\nthe  Corporate  and  Financial  Governance  Project.  ADBN  will  also  provide  logistic  support  and\ncounterpart staff to assist the consultants in their duties. An international consulting firm will be\nengaged to implement the TA. The consulting services will be carried out over 12 months. The\nconsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants. The TA will require about 26 person-months of international consulting services in\nrural finance policy, accounting and finance, banking, rural credit, auditing, law and institutional\ndevelopment;  and  30  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  in  the  same  disciplines,\nwith focus on accounting.\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 10, page 9\n\nSub-TA 6: Developing Insurance, Pensions, and Contractual Savings ($750,000)\n\nA.\n\nTA Rationale and Objectives\n\n29.\nDeepening and broadening the financial sector require expansion and orderly growth of\ninsurance,  pension,  and  other  forms  of  contractual  savings.  A  sound  regulatory  environment\nand  strong  regulatory  institutions  are  also  needed.  Development  of  insurance  and  contractual\nsavings can play an important role in enforcing corporate governance provisions and enforcing\nalternative savings instruments. The TA will lay the foundation for proper regulation and policy\ndirectives as well as institutional development.\n\nB.\n\nScope\n\nThe  TA  has  three  components:  (i)  development  of  the  regulatory  framework,  (ii)\n30.\ndevelopment  of  the  insurance  industry,  and  (iii)  development  of  pension  and  provident  funds\nand  other  forms  of  contractual  savings  including  investment  trusts.

This  includes\nreviewing  the  legal  and  institutional  bases,  as  well  as  operational  and  financial\nconditions  of  the  existing  collective  investment  funds  established  under  the\nSecurities Investment Trust Act.\n\nExplore  the  need  for  legislation  to  govern  the  provision  of  financial  advice,  and\nprovide appropriate draft legislation if necessary.\n\nDevelopment of the Insurance Industry\n\nExamine  the  performance  and  business  practices  of  the  insurance  companies;\nidentify  issues  prevailing  in  the  industry  and,  where  appropriate,  propose\namendments to the regulatory framework to address these issues.\n\nReview  the  1992  Nepal  Insurance  Act,  identifying  constraints  or  weaknesses  in\nthe act, which hinder the functioning and sustainability of an effective regulatory\nsystem  or  the  effective  operation  of  the  insurance  market,  propose  appropriate\namendments.\n\n\f73\n\nAppendix 10, page 10\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\n3.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\nOn the basis of (i) and (ii), and considering the findings of component 1, propose\na suitable governance structure and prepare the corporate plan for the insurance\nregulator.\n\nBuilding  the  capacity  of  the  insurance  regulator  by  defining  the  role  and\nresponsibility of its functional wings, preparing rules and regulations, operational\nmanual,  and  a  management  information  system;  and  developing  its  capacity  to\nenforce regulations, etc.\n\nDesign training programs and provide on-the-job training to staff of the insurance\nregulator.\n\nReview  the  operational  and  financial  performance  of  the  National  Insurance\nCompany  (NIC/Rastriya  Beema  Sansthan),  assessing  the  value  of  assets  and\nliabilities  including  its  policyholder  liabilities,  and  assessing  the  quality  of  risk\nmanagement  in  terms  of  pricing  risk,  asset  liability  management,  risk,  and\nexposure to major losses. In addition, identify impediments to equal opportunities\nbetween the private and public sector insurance companies. On the basis of the\nresults,  develop  restructuring  and  divestment  plans  for  NIC  and  actions,  as\nappropriate,  to  remove  any  market  distortions  between  the  public  and  private\nsectors.\n\nDevelopment of Pension and Provident Funds\n\nObtain  and  review  the  financial  and  operational  information  on  private  pension\nfunds  and  the  Employees  Provident  Fund  (EPF).    Examine  the  legal  and\nregulatory  framework  currently  applicable  to  pension  and  provident  funds,\nincluding  the  Employees\u2019  Provident  Fund  Act  of  1992,  and  identify  weaknesses\nrelating  to  solvency,  fund  administration,  investment  management,  fiduciary\nrequirements, and member protection.\n\nBased  on  the  results  of  item  i)  and  considering  the  findings  of  component  1,\nrecommend an appropriate regulatory structure and policies for pension schemes\nand  provident  funds  in  Nepal  that  cater  to  various  segments  of  the  population\nand industry.\n\nRecommend  and  draft  appropriate  amendments  to  existing  law,  including\namendments to the EPF Act and new legislation to govern private pension funds,\nas  well  as  supportive  rules  and  regulations  to  implement  the  recommendations\nmade.\n\n(iv)\n\nAnalyze  the  existing  and  potential  role  of  pension  and  provident  funds  in  the\nNepalese capital markets in reducing old-age poverty.\n\n(v)\n\nExplore the feasibility of establishing a national (pillar 1) pension scheme.\n\n\f74\n\nAppendix 10, page 11\n\n(vi)\n\nRecommend  approaches  and  modalities \nfor  encouraging  professional\nmanagement of pension and provident funds and gratuity schemes in the public\nand private sectors.\n\n(vii)\n\nReview  the  operations  of  the  EPF;  propose  revision  of  the  investment  policy  of\nEPF and prepare a plan for decentralized fund management activities.\n\n(viii) Conduct  workshops  with  public  and  private  sector  representatives  and\nprofessional  firms  to  discuss  the  proposed  options,  with  the  objective  of\ndeveloping a feasible reform proposal.\n\n(ix)\n\nPrepare training programs and conduct training to upgrade the knowledge of staff\nin charge of pension and provident funds.\n\n(x)\n\nRecommend incentive schemes to promote pension and provident funds.\n\nC.\n\nImplementation Arrangements and Consulting Services\n\n31.\nAn  international  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  to  implement  the  TA  over  12  months.\nThe consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants.
