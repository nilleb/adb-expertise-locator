Post-\nconflict  rehabilitation  will  address  basic  needs  in  the  conflict-affected \nareas  through  health,  education,  irrigation,  agriculture,  community \ndevelopment, \nincome-generation \nsubprojects.  \n \nIn  May  2009,  the  government  defeated  the  Liberation  Tigers  of  Tamil \nEelam  and  gained  full  control  of  the  Northern  province.  However,  the \nconflict  displaced  more  than  290,000  people  from  districts  in  the \nNorthern province. These internally displaced persons (IDPs), who were \nhoused in 32 special welfare centers, were in addition to the more than \n150,000  people  who  were  displaced  before  the  renewed  outbreak  of \nfighting  in  2006  and  who  are  living  with  friends  and  relatives  and  in \nwelfare centers in Jaffna, Mannar, and Vavuniya districts. About 65% of \nthe  recent  IDPs  living  in  welfare  centers  have  been  relocated  to  their \noriginal places of residence, or with host families (including friends and \nrelatives)  by  the  end  of  January  2010.  The  rest  are  expected  to  be \nresettled by about mid-2010 as demining progresses.  \n \nThe government initiated a needs assessment in the second quarter of \n2009  by  interdepartmental  teams  from  the  central  and  provincial \ngovernments.  The  needs  assessment  identified  two  programs  for \nimmediate  rehabilitation  and  medium-term  reconstruction:  (i)  the  180-\nday  program,  and  (ii)  the  medium-term  (3  years)  rehabilitation  and \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nSupplementary \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n\ndevelopment needs program. The 180-day program is concentrating on \nrepairing  the  most  urgently  needed  partially  damaged  community  and \nadministrative  infrastructure,  while  the  medium-term  program  will  focus \non  rebuilding  the  destroyed  larger  infrastructure  needed  to  support \nmedium- to longer-term development and livelihood needs. An estimated \n$800 million is required for the 180-day program. About $2,680 million is \nneeded  to  meet  the  medium-term  requirements.  Main  sectors  include \nhousing  (more  than  $317  million);  electricity  ($152  million);  roads \n($949 million); \nfisheries,  and \ntransport  ($238  million);  agriculture, \nlivestock  (more  than  $186  million);  and  education  (more  than  $90 \nmillion). \n \nThe  main  objective  of  NECORD  II  is  to  rapidly  improve  the  living \nconditions  and  well-being  of  a  significant  number  of  people  in  the \nconflict-affected  areas  of  the  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces  by \nrestoring basic social infrastructure, community and public services, and \nlivelihoods. NECORD II will also support and augment the government\u2019s \nrehabilitation and relief efforts under way in the conflict-affected areas.  \n \nfurther  community \nNECORD \nII \ndevelopment, \ninstitutional \ninfrastructure, and restore basic infrastructure. Given the recent increase \nin  construction  activity  in  the  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces,  an \nHIV/AIDS  awareness  campaign  will  be  carried  out  for  construction \nworkers and returnees.  \n \nThe  revised  estimated  total  cost  is  $78.9 million  equivalent,  including \ntaxes, duties, and interest during implementation.  \n\nrehabilitation  subprojects  will \nrehabilitate \n\ndevelop \n\naccess \n\nroads, \n\n \n($ million) \n\nSource \n\n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n \nTotal \n\n \n% \n\nAsian Development Bank \n   Asian Development Fund grant \n   Asian Development Fund loan \nGovernment of Sri Lanka \nGovernment of Australia  \nGovernment of Sweden \n\nTotal \n\n \n \n16.2 \n \n  \n \n \n\n \n \n22.7 \n12.9 \n \n \n  \n\n52.8\n14.0\n38.8\n12.9\n7.3\n5.9\n\n66.9\n17.7\n49.2\n16.4\n9.2\n7.5\n78.9 100.0\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nThe  government  has  requested  a  supplementary  loan  of  $12.8  million \nfrom the Asian Development Fund for the unmet basic and urgent needs \nof  the  conflict-affected  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces.  The  loan  will \nhave  a  40-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  10  years,  with \nrepayment  of  principal  at  2%  per  year  for  the  first  10  years  after  the \ngrace period and 4% a year thereafter. The terms and conditions of the \nloan will be as set forth in the loan agreement presented to the Board.  \n \nUntil 30 June 2012  \n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nfor \n\nthis \n\nresponsible \n\n \nNECORD  II  will  be  implemented  through  project  management  units \nalready established under the ongoing loan.  \n \nA  national  project  coordination  committee  chaired  by  the  Secretary  of \nthe  Ministry  of  Nation  Building  and  Estate  Infrastructure  will  provide \noversight  and  coordination.  Members  will  come  from  the  presidential \ntask  force  for  rebuilding  the  Northern  province;  other  ministries, \ndepartments,  and  agencies \nreconstruction  and \nrehabilitation; the Asian Development Bank (ADB); the chief secretaries \nof  the  Northern  and  Eastern  provincial  councils;  project  director;  and \nothers  as  appropriate.  The  committee  will  meet  at  least  quarterly  and \noversee project coordination and implementation at the national level.  \n \nTo  ensure  beneficiary  participation  during  project  preparation  and \nimplementation,  sector  subprojects  will  generally  be  prepared  for  and \napproved  by  a  provincial  project  coordination  committee.  The  Northern \nfunction \nand  Eastern  provincial  councils  currently  perform \neffectively.  \n \nProcurement  under  the  project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time), \nand  the  government\u2019s  tender  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  For  civil \nworks contracts with estimated values more than $3 million, procurement \nwill be in accordance with international competitive bidding procedures. \nFor  contracts  with  estimated  values  of  $3 million  or  less,  procurement \nwill  be \nlocal  competitive  bidding  procedures \nacceptable to ADB, using single-stage, two-envelope procedures where \nrelevant, and bidding periods of at least 21 days.  \n \nEquipment  and  materials  will  be  procured \ninternational \ncompetitive  bidding  when  the  estimated  cost  is  more  than  $500,000 \nequivalent and through national competitive bidding when the estimated \ncost  is  $500,000  equivalent  or  less.  Goods  and  works  valued  at \n$100,000  equivalent  or \nless  will  be  procured  under  shopping \nprocedures. Goods costing less than $10,000 equivalent may be directly \npurchased from a supplier.  \n \nThe  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time) \nsatisfactory to ADB.  \n \n31 December 2011  \n\nin  accordance  with \n\nthrough \n\n \nBecause  of  the  many  years  of  conflict,  poverty  levels  in  the  conflict-\naffected  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces  are  estimated  to  be  about \n37%\u2014much  higher  than  in  the  rest  of  the  country,  although  there  are \ngaps in government surveys for much of the area.  \n \n\n \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting \nServices \n\n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nAssumptions, \nRisks, and \nMitigation \nMeasures \n\nThe project will help to meet the urgent basic needs of about 1.5 million \npeople,  including  a  significant  number  of  physically  disabled  people, \nhouseholds  headed  by  women,  and  children.  By  restoring  sectors  that \nform the backbone of the economy in affected areas, the subprojects will \nhelp to rebuild communities and stabilize the economic base of the local \npopulations,  helping  them  to  move  from  dependence  on  government \nsupport toward sustainable livelihoods.  \n \nThe  design  of  NECORD  II  incorporates  safeguards  to  improve  and \nstrengthen  governance  and  the  institutional  capacity  of  the  executing \nagencies,  the  implementing  agencies,  and  the  project  management \nunits.  \n \nMines and unexploded ordinance are the main risks in the project areas. \nThe  government  is  coordinating  with  demining  agencies  to  ensure  that \nthe  areas  where  people  are  resettling,  including  subproject  sites,  are \nprioritized. District secretaries are responsible for coordinating demining \nat  the  ground  level,  and  the  executing  agency  is  responsible  at  the \nnational level. \n \nPrice  escalation  is  another  risk.  An  increase  in  the  demand  for \nconstruction materials, which are already in short supply, could drive up \nprices and affect the amount of reconstruction that can be carried out in \nthe  area.  Based  on  the  lessons  after  the  tsunami,  ADB  has  raised  the \nissue  with  the  government.  Studies  are  under  way  to  identify  adequate \nsites  for  supply  of  construction  materials  and  to  obtain  all  necessary \nstatutory permits to facilitate the construction industry. \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n I.  \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nsupplementary  loan  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  North  East \nCommunity Restoration and Development Project (NECORD) II.1 \n \n\nII.  \n\nTHE APPROVED PROJECT \n\nProject Rationale \n\n Objectives and Scope \n\n \nA.  \n \n2. \nApproved  on  14  April  2005,  NECORD  II  was  designed  to  assist  the  Government  of  Sri \nLanka  with  its  rehabilitation  program  for  the  conflict-affected  areas  of  the  Northern  and  Eastern \nprovinces.  The  project  was  processed  concurrently  with  the  Tsunami-Affected  Areas  Rebuilding \nProject2 to ensure that people affected by both the conflict and the December 2004 tsunami would \nbenefit  equally  since  they  are  in  the  same  districts.  Post-conflict  rehabilitation  seeks  to  address \nbasic  needs  in  the  conflict-affected  areas  through  health,  education,  irrigation,  agriculture, \ncommunity development, institutional infrastructure, and income-generation subprojects. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  main  objective  of  NECORD  II  is  to  help meet  basic  human  needs  and  improve  living \nconditions  rapidly  in  conflict-affected  areas  of  the  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces  by  restoring \nbasic  social  infrastructure,  community  and  public  services,  and  livelihoods.  NECORD  II  is  also \nsupporting  rehabilitation  and  relief  efforts  under  way  in  conflict-affected  areas.  Rehabilitation \nsubprojects  under  NECORD  II  will  further  community  development,  rehabilitate  access  roads, \ndevelop  institutional  infrastructure,  and  restore  basic  infrastructure.  Given  the  recent  increase  in \nconstruction activity in the Northern and Eastern provinces, an HIV/AIDS awareness campaign will \nbe carried out for construction workers and internally displaced persons (IDPs). The project design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nC.  \n \nAs shown in Appendix 2, NECORD II was financed by an Asian Development Fund (ADF) \n4. \nloan  of  SDR16.91  million  ($26.0  million  at  the  time  of  approval)  together  with  an  ADF  grant  of \n$14.0  million  and  a  cofinancing  grant  from  the  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation \nAgency (Sida) of SKr40 million ($5.9 million). The government's contribution for taxes and duties is \n$9.1  million.  The  loan  and  grants  became  effective  on  28  July  2005,  and  the  closing  date  for \nNECORD II is currently 30 March 2010. \n \nD.  \n \n5. \nNECORD II has performed satisfactorily in meeting its objectives. Between 2006 and May \n2009,  renewed  conflict  disrupted  the  project.  After  the  government  gained  full  control  of  the \nEastern province in mid-2007, the working environment in its districts improved. The government \nintroduced  a  180-day  program  to  rehabilitate  the  essential  basic  infrastructure  and  facilitate \nresettlement  of  IDPs  in  the  Eastern  province.  Most  IDPs  in  the  province\u2014about  150,000\u2014were \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2005.

The  project  management  unit  (PMU)  for  NECORD  II  has  accelerated  project \nimplementation in districts in the Eastern province, and all the current subprojects in those districts \nare scheduled to be completed by the first quarter of 2010.  \n \nFollowing  the  resurgence  of  the  conflict,  the  government  imposed  access  and  security \n6. \nrestrictions  in  districts  of  the  Northern  province,  mainly  in  Kilinochchi  and  Mullaitivu,  in  2006. \nSubprojects  have  and  are  being  implemented  in  parts  of  Jaffna,  Mannar,  and  Vavuniya  districts, \nwhere  there  is  access  and  no  security  restrictions.  Since  2008,  no  subprojects  involving \nreconstruction  activities  that  require  cement  and  steel  (being  bulk  items  and  difficult  to  transport) \nhave  been  approved  in  Kilinochchi  and  Mullaitivu  districts,  where  the  conflict  was  most  severe. \nHowever,  small  community-based  activities,  such  as  training  and  reconstruction  of  village  gravel \nroads, were undertaken under both NECORD II and other Asian Development Bank (ADB) projects \nto  remain  engaged  with  the  people  of  the  area.  The  project  performance  assessments  as  of \nNovember 2009 are in Appendix 3.  \n \n7. \nIn May 2009, the government defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and gained full \ncontrol of the Northern province.3 By the end of the war, about 290,000 IDPs from districts in the \nNorthern province were housed in 32 special welfare centers in Jaffna, Mannar, and Vavuniya. An \nadditional 150,000 IDPs who had been displaced before the outbreak of the 2006 conflict are still \nliving with friends and relatives and in welfare centers in Jaffna, Mannar, Puttalam, and Vavuniya \ndistricts.  \n \nOn 1 July 2009, the government launched a 180-day plan4 for emergency rehabilitation and \n8. \nreconstruction  of  public  administration  and  provision  of  basic  human  needs  related  infrastructure \nand  services  to  facilitate  resettlement  of  IDPs  and  restart  their  livelihoods. By  mid-January  2010, \nabout 190,000 of the IDPs who had been housed in the Vavuniya welfare camps since May 2009 \nhad returned to their original places of residence or temporary transit centers closer to their original \nplaces  of  residence,  or  were  staying  with  host  families  (including  friends  and  relatives).5 This  is \nbroadly  in  line  with  the  government  target  to  resettle  a  majority  of  these  people  in  their  original \nplaces of residence by the end of January 2010. Returnees are engaging in reconstruction of their \nhomes;  cleaning  the  village  access  roads  and  common  facilities  such  as  wells  and  irrigation \ncanals;  and  restarting  livelihoods  such  as  agriculture,  fishing,  small  business,  and  trading.  While \nabout 100,000 IDPs remain in the main welfare centers, they have been able to move in and out of \nthe centers for extended periods since 1 December 2009. These remaining IDPs are expected to \nbe resettled in the first half of 2010, after land mines have been cleared.  \n \n9. \nTo help meet basic human needs and the most urgent community and social infrastructure \nneeds of the returning IDPs, as identified by the 180-day program, the government requested ADB \nand other development partners to (i) assist with restarting stalled projects in the conflict-affected \nareas, (ii) provide additional assistance through surplus funds and loan savings from the existing \nportfolio, and (iii) provide additional emergency financing. In response, NECORD II has supported \nthe  180-day  program,  providing  $1  million  for  the  most  urgently  needed  repairs  to  some  of  the \ndamaged basic infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, and administrative facilities. In December \n2009,  the  Government  of  Australia  through  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development \n(AusAID) provided grant cofinancing of A$8 million ($7.3 million) to NECORD II.6 This cofinancing \n                                                 \n3  Northern province comprises Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Mullaittivu, and Vavuniya districts.  \n4  The resettlement plan is part of the Wadakkil Wasantham Development Program - Plan of Action for Implementation of \n\n180 Days Crash Program in the Northern Region. This program is also called the \"Northern Reawakening.\" \n\n5   As per United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees weekly bulletins.  \n6  The governments of Sri Lanka and Australia have agreed to use the grant to assist IDPs in resuming their livelihoods \nupon returning to their original places of residence. The A$20 million grant is divided between ADB (A$8 million) and \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\nwill help nearly 35,000 families resume their livelihoods under the government's unified assistance \nscheme  (UAS),  which  is  open  to  every  returning  IDP.  Under  the  UAS,  a  family  is  entitled  to \nSLRs25,000  as  a  livelihood  or  resettlement  grant  and  SLRs325,000  as  housing  grant  after  they \nsettle in their original place of residence. The method of selecting the beneficiaries is a transparent \nand  well  documented,  and  the  payment  is  only  through  a  bank  account  opened  on  behalf  of  the \nbeneficiary.  The  grant  is  to  buy  basic  kitchen  utensils,  agricultural  implements,  seeds,  school \nbooks or uniforms, livestock, roofing and building materials, or any other activity that will enable the \nIDPs to restart their lives. AusAID is also providing funding to the World Bank supported work-fare \nscheme  under  the  Emergency  Northern  Recovery  Project  (ENREP),7 which  is  similar  to  the  UAS \nscheme. On average, each family will receive SLRs25,000.  \n \n10. \nReview  missions in 2009 observed that some of the infrastructure built or rehabilitated by \nthe  government  and  its  development  partners  since  2001  has  been  partially  damaged.  In  most \ncases, the assets have not been destroyed and can be repaired quickly. Interdepartmental teams \nfrom  the  central  and  provincial  governments  conducted  needs  assessments  for  the  180-day \nprogram,  as  well  as  the  medium-term  (3  years)  rehabilitation  and  development  of  the  former \nconflict-affected  areas,  in  the  second  quarter  of  2009.  The  180-day  program  is  concentrating \nmainly  on  repairing  the  most  urgently  needed  and  partially  damaged  community  infrastructure, \nwhile the medium-term program will focus on rebuilding the destroyed larger infrastructure needed \nto support medium- to longer-term development and livelihood needs. Appendix 4 summarizes the \nmedium-term  requirement  based  on  the  needs  assessment.  An  estimated  $2,680  million  is \nrequired  to  meet  the  medium-term  requirements.  The  main  sectors  that  require  support  include \nhousing  (more  than  $317  million);  power  ($152  million);  roads  ($949 million);  transport  ($238 \nmillion);  agriculture,  fisheries,  and  livestock  (more  than  $186  million);  and  education  (more  than \n$90 million).  \n  \n11. \nAs of 31 December 2009, $25.88 million (99.95%) of the original ADF loan component had \nbeen committed. The ADF grant and the Sida grant had been fully committed. The disbursements \nwere  as  follows:  $22.47  million  (86.77%)  for  the  ADF  loan,  $13.06  million  (93.3%)  for  the  ADF \ngrant,  and  $4.77  million  (82.2%)  for  the  Sida  grant.  Of  the  593  subprojects  identified,  more  than \n500 subprojects were completed and handed over to the beneficiaries. The rest of the subprojects \nare progressing satisfactorily and will be completed by March 2010 (the current loan closing date).  \n \n12. \nNECORD  II  is  complying  with  key  project  covenants,  as  detailed  in  Appendix  5.  One  key \ncovenant includes filling vacancies, especially in the education and health sectors where NECORD \nII  had  the  most  subprojects.  Based  on  the  observations  during  recent  ADB  review  missions, \nteachers  and  medical  staff  vacancies  are  being  filled  in  all  the  rural  facilities  created  under \nNECORD  II.  Specific  subprojects  have  been  included  in  the  ongoing  loan  to  train  staff  in \nanticipation of the future requirements.  \n \n\nIII.  \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE \n\nProposed Changes \n\n \nA.  \n \nGiven the still urgent needs and substantial costs involved in helping resettled IDPs return \n13. \nto a normal life in an area badly affected by war, the government requested ADB to identify loan \n\n                                                                                                                                                               \nWorld Bank (A$12 million). The funding to ADB will be managed through NECORD II, while the World Bank's funding \nwill be managed through its Emergency Northern Recovery Project for $65 million approved on 17 December 2009.  \n7   World Bank. 2009. International Development Association Project Paper on a Proposed Emergency Recovery Credit in \nthe  Amount  of  SDR40.9  million  (US$65  million  equivalent)  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the \nEmergency Northern Recovery Project (ENREP). Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nImpact on the Project \n\nsavings that could be used as supplementary financing to NECORD II. Based on portfolio review \nmissions  in  2009,  ADB  identified  loan  savings  and  surpluses  totaling  SDR8.15  million  ($12.77 \nmillion) of ADF that could be allocated to NECORD II.8 Appendix 6 provides details of the proposed \nloans from which the funds will be reallocated to NECORD II. \n \nThrough  this  proposed  supplementary  loan  to  NECORD  II,  ADB  will  support  the \n14. \ngovernment's  efforts  to  meet  basic  human  needs,  particularly  of  the  returning  IDPs,  and  assist \nthem in restarting their livelihood activities through the reconstruction of essential community and \nsocial infrastructure damaged by the conflict. Areas where the conflict was heavy since 2006 will \nbe  prioritized.  These  areas  include  parts  of  Jaffna,  Mannar,  and  Vavuniya,  and  all  of  Kilinochchi \nand Mullaitivu districts. The emphasis will be on helping to reestablish the civil administration, basic \nhealth  care  and  education  services  as  well  as  support  for  rural  electrification  schemes,  minor \naccess  roads,  minor  irrigation,  community  water  supply,  and  vocational  and  skills  training  for \nlivelihood  development.  Using  existing  PMUs  and  institutional  resources  of  the  NECORD  II  will \nprovide  a  quick,  effective,  and  efficient  way  to  meet  essential  needs  and  deliver  services  to \nreturning IDPs using the proposed additional funds.  \n \nB.  \n \n15. \nThe  proposed  supplementary  financing  will  directly  benefit  the  returning  IDPs  and  host \ncommunities,  and  assist  in  rehabilitating,  reconstructing,  and  developing  areas  affected  by \ndecades  of  conflict.  The  project  design  incorporates  opportunities  to  enhance  participation  of  the \nlocal  community  and  local  staff  in  decision  making,  and  aims  to  build  local  capacity.  Equity  and \nconflict  sensitivity  will  be  pursued  through  (i)  the selection  of  subprojects  that  ensure  an  ethnic \nbalance,  reflecting  the  ethnic  composition  of  the  affected  areas;  (ii)  geographical  balance; \n(iii) consultation  with  affected  stakeholders  regarding  the  final  choice  of  subprojects;  and \n(iv) livelihood  recovery  activities  that  are  undertaken  close  to  the  affected  populations,  with  their \nactive  involvement  as  stakeholders  in  the  process.  Details  of  the  proposed  sector  scope  and \nselection  criteria,  including  the  estimated  costs,  are  in  Appendix  7.  The  expanded  scope  of  the \nNECORD  II  will  enhance  the  project\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  and  outputs.  The  revised  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 8. Appendix 9 provides details of the grievance and dispute \nprevention and settlement mechanisms designed to minimize tensions between communities.  \n \nC.  \n \n16. \nSince  the  conflict  ended  in  2009,  ADB  has  worked  with  the  government  to  find  ways  to \nsupport urgent rehabilitation through ongoing projects in the conflict-affected areas. These projects \ninclude  (i)  NECORD  II  (repairing  damaged  schools,  hospitals,  and  administrative  buildings;  and \nproviding  farm  tractors  to  farmers  societies  to  restart  agriculture);  (ii)  the  Conflict-Affected  Areas \nRebuilding  Project9 (expediting  the  ongoing  road  works  in  Northern  province  and  purchasing  a \nmotor  launch  to  connect  the  islands  of  Jaffna  district  with  Jaffna  peninsula;  and  restarting \ninstallation  of  medium-voltage  and  rural  electrification  schemes,  especially  in  Kilinochchi  and \n\nRationale \n\n                                                 \n8   Loan  savings  identified  totaled  SDR15.41  million  ($24.17  million)  from  ADF  and  $3.63  million  from  ordinary  capital \nresources. However, to maintain balanced support between Northern and Eastern provinces and to ensure that critical \nbasic needs in Eastern province are also met, the government also requested that a portion of the surplus funds, about \n$13  million,  be  allocated  as  supplementary  financing  to  the  Secondary  Towns  and  Rural  Community-Based  Water \nSupply  and  Sanitation  Project  to  complete  the  head  works  and  water  treatment  plant  in  the  Muttur  water  supply \nscheme  in  Eastern  province.  The  scheme  will  serve  an  area  resettled  by  IDPs  and  directly  benefit  about  55,000 \npeople.  The  supplementary  financing  for  the  Secondary  Towns  and  Rural  Community-Based  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation Project is being processed separately on a non-emergency basis.  \n\n9 ADB. 2003.

Manila (Loan 2043-SRI[SF]). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\nSafeguards \n\nMullaitivu districts); and (iii) the Secondary Education and Modernization Project II10 and Education \nfor Knowledge Society Project11 (using loan savings of nearly $5 million from within these loans to \nprovide funds to nearly 500 schools in the Northern province to undertake urgent repairs of school \nbuildings,  and  rehabilitation  of  computer  and  science  labs).  Further,  ADB  is  processing  an \nemergency  assistance  loan  for  $150  million  for  the  Northern  province  for  Board  consideration  in \nMarch 2010, which will complement these initiatives and the proposed supplementary financing of \nNECORD  II  by  focusing  on  the  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  priority  infrastructure  in  the \nconflict-affected districts. \n \nThe  proposed  reallocation  meets  the  policy  criteria  and  eligibility  requirements  for \n17. \nsupplementary financing, as modified to ensure expedited processing as specified under the ADB\u2019s \nDisaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  (2004).  Since  NECORD  II  was  processed  as  an \nemergency  loan,  emphasizing  least-cost,  high-impact,  and  rapid  solutions  for  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction,  financial  and  economic  analyses  were  not  performed.  The  proposed  reallocated \namount will be used for subprojects applying the same selection criteria as the original assistance, \nand  the  supplementary  financing  is  also  being  processed  under  ADB's  disaster  and  emergency \npolicy. As such, additional financial and economic analyses are not required.  \n  \nD.  \n \n18. \nNECORD  II  was  classified  as  environmental  category  B,  which  is  not  changed  with  this \nsupplementary financing. As indicated in the original agreement, category A subprojects will not be \nfinanced under this proposed supplementary financing. An environmental assessment and review \nframework  in  line  with  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  is  in  Appendix  10. 12  Most  of  the \nsubprojects  approved  under  NECORD  II  involved  the  rehabilitation  of  old  or  conflict-damaged \ninfrastructure.  All  subproject  proposals  have  been  reviewed  against  the  checklist  developed  for \nsocial  and  environment  assessments,  and  they  met  the  criteria.  As  given  in  the  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework,  the  PMU  verifies  the  information  before  recommending  the \nsubproject  for  approval  to  the  provincial  project  coordination  committee.  Where  necessary,  the \nPMU requests additional information before the subproject is approved for implementation. Since \nmost of the subprojects involved the rehabilitation or rebuilding of damaged infrastructure, they did \nnot  require  the  acquisition  of  land  or  relocation  of  people.  If  any  land  acquisition  (temporary  or \npermanent) is involved, a resettlement plan will be prepared for the subproject, as provided for in \nthe resettlement framework attached in Appendix 11. \n \nE.  \n \n19. \n The  revised  project  cost,  including  the  amount  originally  financed,  is  estimated  at \n$78.9 million.  Loan  financing  of  $38.8 million  equivalent  comprises  $16.2 million  in  foreign \nexchange  and  $22.7 million  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.

Therefore, the implementation arrangements and structure will \nnot  be  changed,  except  that  additional  engineers  will  be  included  to  ensure  quality  and  further \nexpedite  the  implementation  of  the  subprojects  (Appendix  13).The  approval  of  subprojects  will \nfollow  the  transparent  process  adopted  under  the  ongoing  loans  and  grants  implemented  in  the \nconflict-affected  areas,  and  subprojects  will  be  approved  by  the  provincial  project  coordinating \ncommittee as in the original loan. Ground-level coordination through the government agent and by \nthe ADB Sri Lanka Resident Mission with other multilateral and bilateral development partners will \nensure activities and approaches are complementary.  \n  \n22. \nThe  PMU  will  use  the  same  management  information  system  that  was  developed  for  the \nNorth  East  Community  Restoration  and  Development  Project  (NECORD)  to  track  progress  and \nperformance  of  subprojects  and  generate  progress  reports.13 The  information  is  also  uploaded  to \nthe project website.14  \n \n23. \nProcurement.  International  competitive  bidding  will  be  used  to  procure  equipment  and \nmaterials  with  an  estimated  cost  of  more  than  $500,000  equivalent.  National  competitive  bidding \nwill be used when the estimated cost is $500,000 equivalent or less. Goods and works valued at \n$100,000 equivalent or less will be procured under shopping procedures. Goods costing less than \n$10,000  equivalent  may  be  directly  purchased  from  a  supplier.  The  average  value  of  the  565 \nsubprojects implemented under NECORD II is less than $1 million, and mainly national contractors \n(including  contractors  from  the  provinces)  were  used.  This  has  helped  develop  the  local \nconstruction  industry,  especially  the  contractors  in  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces.  The  use  of \nprivate sector contractors is expected to continue with the new subprojects. If because of urgency \nthe  government  requests  the  use  of  state-owned  enterprises  to  repair  some  of  the  damaged \ncommunity  infrastructure  (as  done  under  government's  180-day  program  explained  in  para.  8), \nstaff  will  review  the  requests  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  Where  justified  in  accordance  with  ADB's \n\n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President: Proposed Loan to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri \n\nLanka for the North East Community Restoration and Development Project. Manila (Loan 1846-SRI). \n\n14  North East Community Restoration and Development Project. http://www.necord.org/  \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nrequirements  and  policies,  the  use  of  state-owned  enterprises  will  be  allowed  for  limited  force \naccount work. The revised procurement plan is in Appendix 14.  \n \n24. \nImplementation schedule. The current loan closing date of 30 March 2010 is proposed to \nbe  extended  to  31  December  2011,  resulting  in  a  cumulative  loan  period  of  6.5  years.  ADB\u2019s \nDisaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  states  a  maximum  time  frame  of  5  years  in  a  post-\nconflict  situation.  If  not  for  the  proposed  supplementary  financing,  NECORD  II  would  have  been \nclosed within the allowed time frame for post-conflict rehabilitation. However, a waiver is requested \nto  allow  an  additional  1.5  years  to  complete  the  proposed  activities  under  this  supplementary \nfinancing in view of the new emergency situation that has arisen and the resettlement process now \nunder way. Since NECORD II has established effective implementation mechanisms in all districts \nin  Northern  province,  speedy  implementation  is  possible  in  responding  to  a  new  post-conflict \nemergency situation.  \n \n25. \nRetroactive  financing.  To  continue  the  ongoing  urgent  small  rehabilitation  works,  the \ngovernment  has  asked  for  retroactive  financing  for  immediate  imports  and  rehabilitation  of  key \ncommunity  infrastructure  and  facilities.  ADB  has  agreed  to  provide  retroactive  financing  for \nexpenditures incurred during the 4 months before the signing of the loan, subject to a maximum of \n20%  of  the  loan  amount,  provided  that  the  expenditures  are  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The government has been advised \nthat provision of retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing any part of the proposed \nsupplementary financing to NECORD II. \n \n26. \nPotential  cofinancing.  Many  bilateral  development  partners  are  considering  providing \nadditional support in Northern provincial districts to address the still urgent need to help returning \nIDPs  meet  their  basic  needs  and  reestablish  their  livelihoods  in  the  post-conflict  situation.  To \nensure  quick,  efficient,  and  complementary  assistance  to  the  beneficiaries,  some  development \npartners  are  considering  linking  with  ongoing  successful  projects  in  the  area.  Cofinancing  allows \nfull  and  efficient  use  of  the  existing PMU  and  institutional  resources,  and  effective accountability. \nGrant cofinancing also provides an effective complement to loan funds. ADB has had discussions \nwith several development partners and additional grant cofinancing is possible.  \n \nUnder the original report and recommendation of the President for NECORD II, the Board \n27. \nauthorized  ADB  to  administer  loans  or  grants  to  be  provided  by  any  development  partner  or \ncofinancier, after the date of the project\u2019s Board approval. For the reasons set out in para. 26 it is \nproposed  that  the  Board  also  authorize  ADB  to  administer  loans  or  grants  provided  by  any \ndevelopment partner or cofinancier after the date of Board approval of this supplementary loan, on \nthe same basis. These bases are that approval of such additional cofinancing would be confirmed \nand approved by Management, and reported to the Board in accordance with the usual quarterly \nreporting. This procedure would only be adopted to the extent that the additional funds provided by \ncofinanciers would not materially alter or fundamentally affect the objectives, purposes, and scope \nof  the  existing  project.   Any  proposed  cofinancing  that  did  materially  alter  or  fundamentally  affect \nthe objectives, purposes, and scope of the project would be processed as a major change in scope \nand circulated to the Board.   \n \n28. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand discussed with the government and executing agency. Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or \nthrough  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the \nproject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in \nthe loan regulations and the bidding documents for the project. In particular, all contracts financed \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\nby ADB in connection with the project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  executing  agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the project. \n \n\nIV.  \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \n29. \nIn the conflict-affected Northern and Eastern provinces, poverty levels are estimated to be \nabout  37%\u2014much  higher  than  in  the  rest  of  the  country,  although  there  are  gaps  in  government \nsurveys  for  much  of  the  area.  Basic  socioeconomic  facilities  need  to  be  restored  if  affected \ncommunities  are  to  recover  and  return  to  normalcy.  An  updated  summary  poverty  reduction  and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 15.  \n \n30. \nNECORD II will address the urgent needs of about 1.5 million people, including a significant \nnumber  of  physically  disabled  people,  households  headed  by  women,  and  children.  Of  this \npopulation,  about  290,000  people  who  were  in  welfare  centers  for  much  of  2009  are  being \nresettled  in  their  original  places  of  residence.  By  restoring  essential  community  and  social \ninfrastructure and services, as well as agriculture and fisheries sectors that form the backbone of \nthe  economy  in  the  affected  areas,  NECORD  II  will  help  to  rebuild  affected  communities  and  to \nstabilize  the  economic  base  of  local  populations,  helping  people  to  move  from  dependence  on \ngovernment support to sustainable livelihoods.  \n \n31. \n NECORD II focuses on restoring preexisting facilities, allowing for technical improvements \nand future demand, based on a least-cost approach. Taking into consideration the many years of \nneglect, project interventions focus not only on the physical rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure \nbut also on the restoration of the physical and institutional arrangements for legal, administrative, \nand technical services.  \n \nCreating  an  environment  that  is  conducive  to  the  participation  of  vulnerable  and \n32. \nmarginalized  groups  in  the  conflict-affected  areas  in  reconstruction  activities  is  an  urgent  need. \nWar widows, households headed by women, single parent families and single women with elderly \ndependents have to deal with transformations in social roles that place new burdens on them. The \nproject  will  help  them  to  reestablish  local  community  organizations  and  provide  them  with \nlivelihood-related  skills \nto  credit  and  extension  services  and  necessary \nadministrative  and  legal  services.  This  will  enable  them  to  become  economically  independent, \nimprove  the  well-being  of  their  families  and  in  the  longer  term  will  reduce  existing  inequalities, \ndiscrimination and marginalization. An updated gender action plan is in Appendix 16. \n \nB. \n \n33. \nThe  project  incorporates  a  number  of  safeguards  to  improve  and  strengthen  the \ngovernance  and  institutional  capacity  of  the  executing  agency,  implementing  agencies,  and  the \nPMU.  The  assessment  of  ongoing  projects  indicates  that  the  risks  have  been  well  managed. \nCoordination  and  monitoring  by  the  ADB  Sri  Lanka  Resident  Mission  further  strengthened  the \nprocess.  \n \n34. \nRisks. Price escalation is one of the main risks. An increase in the demand for construction \nmaterials,  which  are  already  in  short  supply,  could  drive  up  prices  and  affect  the  amount  of \nreconstruction  that  can  be  carried  out  in  the  area.  Based  on  the  lessons  after  the  2004  tsunami, \nADB has highlighted the issue with the government. To minimize the risk, studies are under way to \n\nAssumptions, Risks, and Mitigation Measures \n\ntraining,  access \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nidentify  adequate  sites  for  supply  of  construction  materials,  and  to  obtain  all  necessary  statutory \npermits  to  facilitate  the  construction  industry.  Contracts  will  be  closely  monitored  for  price \nvariations.   \n \n35. \nDemining.  Complete  demining  of  the  area  will  still  take  some  time.  In  addition  to  the \nsecurity  forces,  eight  agencies  are  assisting  the  government  in  demining.  The  Ministry  of  Nation \nBuilding  is  coordinating  the  activities  of  these  agencies  at  the  national  level,  while  government \nagents  or  district  secretaries  are  facilitating  at  the  ground  level.  Some  development  partners \n(mainly the United Nations and bilateral agencies) are also supporting this effort. Clearing village \nareas and farmland to enable the prompt return of IDPs is the priority. \n \n\nV.  \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n\nThe government has given the following assurances, relevant to NECORD II, in addition to \n\n36. \nthe standard assurances. These will be incorporated into the legal documents.  \n \n\nContinuity  and  integration.  The  government  will  ensure  the  continuity  of  the \nimplementation  of  the  work  financed  under  the  original  NECORD  II  and  the  work \nfinanced under the supplementary finance. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nstructure \n\nthat  may \n\nGovernment  administration.  The  project  management  arrangements  reflect  the \nchange  during \npresent  government  administrative \nimplementation.  The  government  will  immediately  notify  ADB  of  any  proposed \nchange  in  the  administrative  structure  in  the  project  areas,  and  take  all  steps \nnecessary  to  ensure  that  the  project  management  arrangements  are  revised  in \nconsultation  with  ADB  to  reflect  the  new  administrative  structure  and  protect  the \nviability  of  the  project.  The  government  will  take  all  steps  necessary  and  within  its \npower  to  ensure  that  any  successor  project  management  entities  enter  into  such \nproject agreements, or other agreements with ADB, as ADB may request.  \n \nPeace  building  and  community  reconciliation. The government will ensure that \nall conflict-related project interventions contribute to peace building and community \nreconciliation. If any proposed subproject or intervention has an actual or threatened \nnegative  impact  on  peace  building  and  community  reconciliation,  the  government \nagrees that ADB shall be entitled to determine whether such intervention should be \ncontinued, redesigned, suspended, or canceled.  \n \nAccess.  The  government  will  ensure  that  staff,  consultants,  materials,  vehicles, \nequipment,  and  other  items  required  for  project  implementation  will  be  given \nreasonable access to project areas.  \n \nOperation  and  maintenance.  The  government  will  ensure,  and  will  cause  the \nexecuting  agency  and  implementing  agencies  to  ensure,  that  the  project  facilities \nare operated and maintained, and that adequate budgetary and other resources are \nprovided  for  this  purpose.  The  government  will  also  ensure  that  community-based \norganizations charged with operating and maintaining facilities provided under both \nprojects  are  provided  with  the  necessary  support  and  training  to  undertake  such \nactivities.  \n\n(vi) \n\nSubproject selection. The government and each implementing agency will ensure \nthat  all  subprojects  meet  to  ADB\u2019s  satisfaction,  the  agreed  selection  criteria  and \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\nother  implementation  arrangements,  and  that  subprojects  are  controlled  and \nmonitored to ADB\u2019s satisfaction. \n \n\n(vii)  Governance  and  anticorruption.  The  government  and  ADB  agree  to  adopt  a \npolicy  of  zero-tolerance  of  corruption  in  relation  to  assistance  provided  under  the \nproject(s),  and  by  development  partners.  The  government  will  take  measures  to \nquickly  sanction  private  individuals,  entities,  or  public  officials  who  actually  or \nattempt  to  take  advantage  of  donor  funds,  or  the  loss  of  documents,  such  as  the \nabsence of property title documents, court records, or bank accounts.  \n \n\n(x) \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Statement of expenditures audit. The government agrees to ensure that ADB staff \nmembers  are  granted  access  to  key  books  and  records  in  order  to  complete  a \nstatement of expenditures audit within 6 months of effectiveness.  \n \nPost-completion audit. The government will ensure that a special post-completion \nperformance audit is conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s disaster and emergency \npolicy to consider governance, transparency, and financial accountability.  \n \nADB  monitoring  and  compliance. The government will allow and facilitate ADB\u2019s \nrepresentatives to conduct spot and random checks on (a) flow of funds through the \nimprest  account,  each  second-generation  imprest  account,  and  each  third-\ngeneration  imprest  account,  and  their  use  for  the  project  in  accordance  with  the \nfinancing agreement; (b) work in progress; and (c) project implementation. \n \nParticipation. The government will ensure, or will cause each executing agency or \ncommunity-based  organizations, \nimplementing  agency \nnongovernment  organizations,  and  beneficiaries  are \nin  subproject \nselection, design, implementation, and monitoring.  \n\nto  ensure, \n\ninvolved \n\nthat \n\n(xi) \n\n \nThe  execution  of  a  project  agreement  in  a  form  satisfactory  to  ADB  is  a  condition  to  loan \n37. \neffectiveness.    ADB  will  require  a  project  agreement  in  a  form  substantially  the  same  as  that \nagreed under the original NECORD II project.  \n \n\nVI.  \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  supplementary  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n\n38. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR8.15  million  to  the  Democratic \nSocialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  North  East  Community  Restoration  and \nDevelopment Project II from

These areas include \nparts  of  Jaffna,  Mannar,  and  Vavuniya,  and  all  of  Kilinochchi  and  Mullaitivu  districts.  The \nsubprojects will cover the reconstruction of partly and fully damaged basic social infrastructure, \nexpansion  of  rural  electrification,  and  restarting  livelihoods.  Emphasis  will  be  given  to \nreestablishing the civil administration, basic health care, schools, rural electrification schemes, \nminor access roads, minor irrigation, community water supply, and vocational and skills training \nfor livelihood development. An indicative cost estimate for the sectors is in Table A7.1.  \n \n3. \nHealth.  Subprojects  will  restore  critical  referral  medical  facilities  through  hospital \nreconstruction  and  refurbishment,  provision  and  replacement  of  medical  equipment  and \nfurniture,  construction  of  doctors  quarters  at  hospital  compounds,  and  rehabilitation  of  village \nhealth  clinics.  Although  hospital  staffing  is  generally  satisfactory,  an  essential  subproject \nselection  criterion  will  stipulate  the  availability  of  sufficient  qualified  staff  to  operate  the \nrehabilitated  facilities,  as  well  as  other  existing  facilities.  Some  of  the  key  facilities  identified \ninclude  the  Kilinochchi,  Mullaitivu,  and  Trincomalee  hospitals.  Funds  earmarked  for  the \nTrincomalee  hospital  are  being  used  for  urgent  works  under  the  180-day  program  in  selected \nvillages in Northern province. 2 \n \nEducation. Subprojects will restore services and facilities through (i) reconstruction and \n4. \nrehabilitation  of  teaching  facilities  and  school  buildings  serving  a  large  population  area; \n(ii) construction  of  cluster  housing  units  for  teachers  in  areas  where  housing  is  limited  or \nunavailable;  and  (iii)  provision  of  training  to  teachers  in  special  subjects,  such  as  primary, \nenglish,  science,  and  math.  Schools  will  only  be  rehabilitated  where  teachers  are  or  can  be \nmade  available.  Cluster  housing  units  will  be  provided  where  housing  is  limited  or  has  been \ndestroyed. Specialist training will be provided to improve the quality of the teachers, especially \nnew recruits.  \n \n5. \nCommunity  development.  A  wide  range  of  village-level  subprojects  across  several \nsectors  will  help  restore  livelihoods.  These  subprojects  include  livelihood  development,  skills \ndevelopment,  small  community-based  and  medium-sized  town  water  supply  schemes  along \nwith sanitation facilities, and support for reconciliation and social cohesion. These activities will \nbe  undertaken,  particularly  where  internally  displaced  persons  (IDPs)  are  returning. Livelihood \nopportunities  will  be  provided  in  communities  through  subprojects  that  promote  livestock \ndevelopment and home gardening, microfinance and creating a revolving fund, provide facilities \nfor  seed  production,  and  support  fisheries  development.  Also  includes  the  unified  assistance \nscheme,  which  is  provided  to  every  returning  IDP.  Under  this  scheme,  a  family  is  entitled  to \nSLRs25,0003 as a livelihood or resettlement grant and SLRs325,000  as a housing grant after \nthey  settle  in  their  original  place  of  residence.  Beneficiaries  are  selected  using  a  strict \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2005.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the North East Community Restoration and Development Project II. \nManila (Loan 2168-SRI[SF], Grants 0007-SRI and 0013-SRI) \n\n2   The  government  introduced  a  180-day  program  to  rehabilitate  the  essential  basic  infrastructure  and  facilitate \nresettlement of IDPs in Eastern province. Most IDPs in the province\u2014about 150,000\u2014were resettled during 2008 \nand almost all by mid-2009. \n\n3   The Government may revise this scheme to reflect the current requirement.  \n\n \n\n\f \n30 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nmethodology, and the payment is made only through a bank account opened on behalf of the \nbeneficiary.  The  grant  is  to  buy  basic  kitchen  utensils,  agricultural  implements,  seeds, \nschoolbooks or uniforms, livestock, roofing and building materials, or any other activity that will \nmake  IDPs  confident  and  restart  their  lives.  Skills  development  and  service  training  will  be \nprovided  for  microenterprise  development  in  areas  such  as  horticulture,  post-harvest  food \nprocessing,  and  tourism  and  hotels.  To  enable  community-based  organizations  to  promote \nmicroenterprise development at the village level, skills training will be carried out, and revolving \nfunds will be established and managed by the community-based organization. Gender-oriented \nprograms  for  enterprise  development,  initiated  as  a  pilot  program  under  the  previous  projects \nrelated to northeast community restoration and development, will be expanded to a wider range \nof fishing and agricultural communities.  \n \nIrrigation. Activities will include rehabilitation of small, medium-sized, and large irrigation \n6. \nschemes. Works will include rehabilitation of tank bunds, channel systems, access roads, and \nother structures\u2014without changes to, or diversions of, natural watercourses. The activity will be \nlinked to village, agriculture, and livestock development.  \n \n7. \nAccess  roads.  Rural  access  road  construction  will  use  labor-intensive  methods  to \nprovide gravel-surfaced rural roads, connecting villages to the road network, irrigation schemes, \nor community facilities. A small number of class C or D provincial roads will be rehabilitated with \nall-weather  surfaces.  All  road  construction  will  be  on  existing  alignments  and  will  not  require \nland acquisition or resettlement.  \n \n8. \nInstitutional  infrastructure. Service delivery will be improved through subprojects that \nrestore damaged local government facilities, district administrative offices, corporative societies, \ncourts,  and  registrars  offices.  Based  on  needs,  damaged  transportation  facilities  (such  as \ndouble cabs and motorcycles) will be provided. 4 \n \nRural electrification. Northern province has the lowest electrification ratio in Sri Lanka. \n9. \nThe  electrification  ratio  is  particularly  low  in  Kilinochchi,  Mannar,  and  Mullaitivu.  Under  ADB\u2019s \nConflict-Affected  Areas  Rehabilitation  Project,5 cofinanced  by  the  Government  of  Norway,  102 \nrural schemes and 21 medium-voltage schemes were identified for rural electrification in these \ndistricts.  Before  the  closure  of  the  Conflict-Affected  Areas  Rehabilitation  Project,  only  76  rural \nschemes and 1 medium voltage scheme could be completed. However, under that  project, all \nmaterials  required  for  the  balance  schemes  will  be  procured  before  March  2010.  For  the \nremaining 26 rural and 20 medium-voltage schemes, it is proposed that the local input cost be \nfunded under this project. The list of the 46 schemes is in Table A7.2.  \n \nthe  North  East  Community  Restoration  and  Development  Project, 6 \n10. \nelectromechanical  facilities  such  as  hospital  bed  lifts,  piped  medical  gas  system,  mortuary \ncoolers,  air  conditioning  system,  package  waste  treatment  plant,  generators,  and  hospital \nfurniture  were  provided  to  Kilinochchi  General  Hospital.  Some  of  the  electromechanical  items \nand  furniture  were  provided  with  grant  cofinancing  from  the  governments  of  Norway  and \nFinland. However, because of the resurgence of conflict and resulting security restrictions, these \nitems were installed at other hospitals in Northern and Eastern provinces. The subprojects will \n\nUnder \n\n                                                 \n4   It is estimated that at least 15 double cabs and 50 motorcycles will be purchased. \n5   ADB.  2004.

grievance prevention and resolution analysis intends to contribute to \n1. \nenhancing  the  capability  of  the  North  East  Community  Restoration  and  Development  Project \n(NECORD) II to address potential project-related conflict and grievances arising during design \nand implementation. This appendix (i) examines the sources and consequences of conflict, (ii) \ndetermines  the  factors  that  can  be  addressed  or  prevented  through  NECORD  II,  and  (iii) \ndetermines how to strengthen resilience through development assistance.  \n \nB.  \n \n2. \nNorthern  province  has  an  area  of  8,884 square  kilometers,  covering  14%  of  the  total \nlandmass of Sri Lanka. This includes 6.6% (594 square kilometers) of inland waters and about \n54% of forest coverage (4,797 square kilometers). Based on the 1981 census, the province had \nan estimated population of more than 1.1 million, of which nearly 86% are Sri Lankan Tamils, \n3%  Sinhalese,  6%  Tamils  of  Indian  origin,  and  5%  Muslims.  Before  the  conflict,  the  province \naccounted  for  a  significant  share  of  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  through  agricultural \nproducts such as paddy, vegetables, livestock, and fruits. It also had small-scale industries such \nas light manufacturing and textiles. Further, the province had significant potential to increase the \nexport-oriented  industries  based  on  its  rich  natural  resources.  However,  Northern  province \ncontributed only 2.9% of GDP in 2007\u2014the lowest regional share. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nNECORD  II  responds  to  the  needs  of  the  IDPs  from  all  ethnic  groups  in  the  Northern \nprovince.  During  the  preparation  of  the  supplementary  financing,  discussions  were  held  with \nprovincial  and  district  officials  (where  possible),  as  well  as  central  government  officials,  to \nensure  ownership  of  the  project  and  its  outputs.  Given  that  the  resettlement  process  is \nunderway and many IDPs have recently started to return to their original home areas, it was not \npossible to undertake consultations with the returning IDPs themselves. However, consultations \nwill be done during subproject design and implementation once communities have begun to be \nreestablished.    The  supplementary  financing  is  designed  to  ensure  that  the  outcomes  are \nshared  equitably  among  ethnic  groups  and  across  the  entire  target  areas.  NECORD  II  is  not \nexpected to contribute to any intensification of social tensions. Based on lessons derived from \nimplementing ADB-funded projects in conflict-affected areas, the implementing agencies should \ncontinue  to  explain  the  objectives  to  local  political  and  other  community  leaders  to  gain  their \nendorsement and acceptance.  \n \nAs  noticed  in  the  ongoing  projects  in  the  conflict-affected  areas,  a  large  percentage  of \n4. \nthe  contracts  based  on  competitive  bidding  are  being  undertaken  by  contractors  from  the \ndistricts.  The  same  trend  is  expected  with  the  proposed  supplementary  loan.  Similarly,  local \nlabor  is  seen  to  benefit  from  the  subprojects  in  these  areas.  Local  labor  will  not  only  earn \nlivelihoods from jobs created by the subprojects, but also gain skills that will make the workers \nmore employable in the long term all around the country.  \n \n5. \nIn  the  current  post  conflict-situation,  some  security  restrictions  will  continue.  The \nimplementing agencies, as in the ongoing projects in these areas, will coordinate and facilitate \nimplementation  of  subprojects  without  undue  delay.  All  contractors  are  expected  to  adhere  to \nthe  security  procedures  in  place.  During  the  initial  phases  of  implementation,  subprojects  are \n\n \n\n\f \n42 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nexpected to be slow in areas where significant security restrictions remain (especially in some \ndivisions of the Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi districts) because mines need to be cleared and the \nsearch  for  arms  and  ammunition  that  may  still  be  stored  in  these  areas  must  be  completed. \nHowever,  these  restrictions  will  be  removed  and  free  access  will  be  given  once  a  secure  and \nsafe  environment  for  the  returning  internally  displaced  persons  is  ensured.  Further,  the \ngovernment  has  indicated  that  an  elected  provincial  council,  as  in  Eastern  province,  will  be \nestablished as soon as the situation permits. Project reviews would also include assessments of \nchanges  in  the  political  and  security  environment,  as  well  as  project  impacts  on  community \nharmony in the target areas. \n \n6. \nTable  A9  identifies  potential  problems  that  could  arise  during  the  design  and \nimplementation  of  the  supplementary  finance  project.  These  problems  are  common  to  all  the \ndistricts  under  NECORD  II.  Where  relevant  and  appropriate,  specific  requirements  have  also \nbeen  mentioned.  Table  A9  provides  key  indicators  for  each  set  of  potential  problems  and \nproposed solutions to them. \n \nProject  components,  as  presented,  will  contribute  to  rebuilding  confidence  in  conflict-\n7. \naffected areas and improving access to basic social services. Implementing the supplementary \nfinance  project  in  a  manner  that  reduces  social  tensions  between  districts  or  areas  will  be  a \nchallenge. This can be done by ensuring that (i) target areas and communities are selected in \nways  that  reflect  the  ethnic  composition  of  the  area;  and  (ii)  transparency  is  pursued  in  all \nphases of the project, allowing the relevant authorities, community leaders, and beneficiaries to \nunderstand the project parameters and how it is progressing. \n \n\nTable A9: Grievance Prevention and Resolution Analysis \n \n\nPotential Problem \nDesign Stage \nDistrict imbalance  Most of the \n\nIndicators \n\nPoverty and \neconomic \ninequality in \nproject areas \n\nsubprojects from one \ndistrict  \n\nExclusion of a \nparticular location, \narea, or ethnic group \n \nExclusion of host \nfamilies and internally \ndisplaced persons \n(IDPs) as project \nbeneficiaries \n\nSpecific Issues \nIdentified \n\nNeeds of some \ndistricts may be \ngreater than other \ndistricts  \n\nAverage poverty level \nin project area is high \ncompared to the rest \nof the country \n\nMeans of Solving \n\nThe project incorporates detailed \nselection criteria, and balance is \nmaintained through the \nsubproject selection and \napproval process.  \nThe design includes the needs of \nall ethnic groups in the project \narea. \n\nProject components focus on \nneeds of all IDPs. \n\nAll project districts are treated \nhomogeneously to ensure that \ninfrastructure development \nprograms are consistent with \nbasic needs and consistent with \nthe \"do no harm\" principle. \n\nImplementation Stage \nRestrictions in \nmovement \n\nSecurity restrictions \n\nPossible security \nrestrictions to certain \nareas because of land \nmines \n\nThe government agents or \ndistrict secretaries facilitate to  \npriority demining to the proposed \nsubproject areas.  \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9   43 \n \n\nMeans of Solving \nContract packages are small and \ndistrict-level local employment is \nforeseen. \n\nSkills training will be provided by \na number of development partner \nprograms.  \n\nTemporary migration of skilled \npersonnel during the initial period \nis foreseen.  \n\nThere will be close and \ncontinuous monitoring and \ndiscussion with the government \nto ensure necessary additional \nstaff are allocated to the \nimplementing agencies.  \nSmall contracts will be \nencouraged so that the local or \nprovincial contractors can bid. \n\nThe selection criteria will be \nrevised to achieve strong \ncompetition.  \n\nTraining will be provided to \nensure that local contractors are \nable to compete on par with \nthose from the rest of the \ncountry.   \n\nThe transparency and \naccountability requirements \noutlined in the project report will \nbe complied with. \n\nStakeholders will be consulted \nand their formal agreement \nobtained before endorsing any \nmajor changes. \n\nImplementation will be phased to \nenable subprojects to be \nundertaken in all areas as they \nare cleared of mines and opened \nup for resettlement.  \n\nPotential Problem \nEmployment and \naccess to \nproductive \nresources \n\nIndicators \n\nEmployment \nopportunities for the \nlocal population \n \nExcess movement of \nlabor forces from \noutside the districts \n\nLack of capacity in \nprovincial and \ndistrict institutions \n\nDelay in \nimplementation \n\n       \n\nSpecific Issues \nIdentified \n\nHigh unemployment \nrate \n\nSeasonal availability \nof labor \n\nLow number of \nqualified and skilled \nemployees available \nin the area  \n\nAdditional workload \nbecause of the \nnumber of \ndevelopment partners \nin the area. \n\nLack of local \n(district or \nprovincial) \ncontractors \n\nUnfair   competition. \n\nMonopoly conditions \n\nAll contracts to outside \nprovince contractors \n\nDispute between \ncontractors from the \nregion and outside \n\nPrice increases \n\n \n\nTime delay in \nimplementation \n\nTime loss \n\nIncrease in costs \n\nLong procurement \nprocess \n\nProject management will be \nimproved. \n\nChanges in scope  Major changes in \n\nscope \n\nLarge  price increases \nin the sector \n\nLimited or no access \nto certain areas \nbecause of security \nrestrictions or slow \ndeming \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n44 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nUPDATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND REVIEW FRAMEWORK \n \n\nA.  \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe  proposed  supplementary  loan  for  the  North  East  Community  Restoration  and \n1. \nDevelopment Project (NECORD) II will support the government\u2019s efforts to rehabilitate essential \ninfrastructure  and  services  damaged  or  destroyed  as  a  result  of  the  conflict  in  Northern  and \nEastern provinces. Subprojects to be supported under the supplementary finance components \ninclude (i) reconstruction of partly and fully damaged basic infrastructure (schools, basic health \ncare services, minor irrigation schemes); (ii) expansion of rural electrification; (iii) rehabilitation \nof minor access roads; and (iv) reconstruction and rehabilitation of vocational and skills training \ncenters to assist livelihood restoration and development. \n\nExact locations of subprojects have not yet been identified. The final location of some of \n2. \nthe  subprojects  may  include  areas  that  are  being  demined.  Therefore,  environmental \nassessments  cannot  be  prepared  before  approval  of  this  supplementary  finance.  Given  the \ntypes  of  subprojects  that  have  been  identified,  it  is  unlikely  that  any  of  the  components  will \ngenerate  significant,  adverse  environmental  impacts.  The  anticipated  impacts  will  largely  be \nreversible  and  manageable  through  the  adoption  of  suitable  mitigation  measures.  The \nsupplementary  loan  will  support  subprojects  that  are  similar  in  scope  to  those  subprojects \nsupported earlier under NECORD II. Therefore, the supplementary finance project is classified \nas category B for environmental impacts. The assessment and review procedures proposed in \nthe framework are based on the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Safeguard Policy Statement.1 \n\nB. \n\nAssessment of Legal Framework and Institutional Capacity \n\n3. \nEnvironmental assessment requirements stipulated by the Government of Sri Lanka for \nprojects  outside  the  coastal  zone  are  found  in  the  National  Environmental  Act  47  of  1980, \namended by Act 56 of 1988 and Act 53 of 2000.2 Environmental assessments of projects within \nthe coastal zone are governed by the Coast Conservation Act 57 of 1981, amended by Act 64 of \n1988.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  National  Environmental  Act,  environmental \nassessments  are  required  for  prescribed  projects. 3  Under  the  National  Environmental  Act, \nprescribed projects are stipulated in three parts listed in the schedule of the respective Gazette. \nPart  I  identifies  prescribed  projects based  on  type  and  magnitude;  Part  II  identifies  prescribed \nprojects as, all subprojects identified in Part I, irrespective of their magnitude and  selected high-\npolluting industries, if near culturally and/or environmentally sensitive areas defined in Part III of \nthe schedule (presented in Table A10). Since the subprojects focus on rehabilitating community \ninfrastructure  and  services,  none  fall  within  type  (i)  prescribed  projects.  Nevertheless,  all \nsubprojects will be screened for type (ii) prescribed projects, using the checklist provided (Table \nA10).  All  subproject  interventions  within  the  coastal  zone  require  the  approval  of  the  Coast \nConservation  Department.  The  department  director  may  request  the  developer  to  submit  an \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) before any development work starts. In addition, under \nthe Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance 2 of 1937, amended by Act 49 of 1993 and Act 22 of \n2009, any new development activity within 1 mile (1.61 kilometers) of the boundary of a national \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2009. Safeguard Policy Statement. Manila. \n2  Defined in the Coast Conservation Act as \u201cthe area lying within a 300m landwards of the mean high water line and \na limit of 2 km seawards of the mean low water line and in the case of rivers, streams, lagoons, or any other body \nof water connected to the sea either permanently or periodically, the landward boundary shall extend to a limit of 2 \nkm  measure  perpendicular  to  the  straight  base  line  drawn  between  the  natural  entrance  points  thereof  and  shall \ninclude waters of such rivers, streams and lagoons or any other body of water so connected to the sea.\u201d \n\n3   Listed in Gazette Extraordinary of 772/22 of 24 June 1993. \n\n \n\n\f     \n\n  Appendix 10  45 \n \n\nreserve  requires  prior  written  approval  of  the  director  of  the  Department  of  Wildlife \nConservation. \n\n4. \nDuring  project  implementation,  as  per  the  national  environmental  requirements, \nenvironmental  protection  licenses  and  other  permits  from  relevant  agencies,  such  as  the \nGeological  Survey  and  Mines  Bureau,  would  be  needed  to  operate  quarry  sites,  borrow  sites, \nasphalt plants, and crusher plants. \n\n5. \nThe  EIA  process  in  Sri  Lanka,  which  has  been  in  operation  since  1981,  is \ncomprehensive  and  well  developed. 4 One  of  the  notable  features  is  the  mandatory  30-day \npublic  review  and  comment  period  and,  if  thought  necessary,  the  requirement  of  a  public \nhearing. However, while the EIA process functions well, it is limited to prescribed projects, which \nare  based  on  predetermined  criteria  (that  specify  limits  and  types  of  activities).  As  a  result, \ndevelopment activities not listed among the prescribed projects, but which have the potential to \ncause  significant  environmental  impacts,  escape  the  formal  requirements  of  environmental \nassessment. This is a key difference between the government's environmental assessment and \nADB's  environmental  assessment \ninadequate \nmanpower  and  financial  resources,  monitoring  and  inspection  by  the  approval  authority  is \ngenerally  complaint-driven,  or  carried  out  during  processing  or  renewals  of  environmental \nprotection  licenses.  Recognizing  these  limitations,  this  framework  describes  measures  to  be \nadopted to improve environmental monitoring and compliance. \n\nrequirements.  Furthermore,  because  of \n\nC. \n\nAnticipated Environmental Impacts \n\n6. \nNegative project impacts are expected mainly during the construction stage. As most of \nphysical works will constitute rehabilitation of damaged or destroyed infrastructure, new impacts \nassociated  with  the  location  of  the  respective  subprojects  are  not  expected.  Typical  impacts \nexpected  in  reconstruction  activities  are  generation  of  dust,  erosion,  disruption  of  traffic, \ndisposal of waste, and temporary disruption to access of those living next to the works areas. \nDust will be generated during the haulage of construction material from exposed working areas, \nand  at  crusher  plants  and  borrow  pits.  This  can  be  mitigated  through  the  adoption  of  suitable \nmitigation  measures,  such  as  covering  material  during  transport  and  stockpiling,  proper \ncompaction of base (in road construction projects) and regular watering during construction, and \nadoption of sufficient numbers of sprinklers at plant sites. In addition, soil erosion from exposed \nsurfaces  will  create  adverse  impacts,  such  as  blocking  of  drainage  paths  and  silting  of  paddy \nlands.  These  will  have  to  be  managed  through  the  adoption  of  temporary  and  permanent \nerosion-control measures and the provision of suitable drainage.  \n\nOne  main  issue  with  respect  to  all  construction  activities  is  the  limited  availability  of \n7. \nsufficient  quantities  of  construction  material  (earth  and  gravel)  in  Northern  province.  Suitable \nborrow and quarry sites are often not found in Northern province, which means such materials \nmust  be  brought  in  from  faraway  places.  The  implementing  agency  and  project  management \nunit (PMU) will ensure that sites selected as borrow and quarry sites will have sufficient material \nto cater to the needs of Northern province, including the area it is located in, and that haulage \nwill be done along roads approved by the respective local authorities to ensure that the roads \nhave  sufficient  carrying  capacity  for  such  cargo.  Borrow  pits  and  quarry  sites  will  have  the \nrequired government permits, and will be managed during and after use, following government \nprescribed guidelines or good practices. \n\n8. \nOff-site  impacts  include  impacts  of  disposal  sites  (for  spoil  waste)  and  of  borrow  and \nquarry sites. Borrow and quarry sites should be rehabilitated after the extraction to ensure that \n                                                 \n4   First  introduced  through  the  Coast  Conservation  Act  in  1981  for  only  the  coastal  zone,  and  then  through  the \n\nNational Environmental Act in 1988 for the entire country. \n\n \n\n\f \n46 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nwater does not stagnate and erosion does not increase, nor pose risks of drowning. Spoil waste \nwill  be  disposed  of  only  at  sites  approved  by  local  authorities  and  that  meet  standards  and \nrequirements  stipulated  in  the  respective  environmental  protection  licenses  provided  by  the \nCentral Environmental Authority (CEA) or relevant local authority.  \n\nThe  reconstruction  and  renovation  of  irrigation  schemes  include  canal  desilting,  and \n9. \nrepairing  earthen  bunds,  channels,  anicuts,  and  sluice  gates.  Typical  impacts  associated  with \nthe reconstruction of such irrigation schemes are similar to those described in para. 6 - 8, and \ncan be mitigated with appropriate measures. Other impacts associated with irrigation schemes \nare  the  possibilities  of  water  logging,  and  increase  in  salinity.  One  key  concern  will  be  finding \nsuitable sites for disposal of dredged material. All dredged material will be disposed of at sites \napproved by local authorities. The sites should have arrangements to contain the disposal areas \nto avoid spillovers to adjoining land by having suitable protection bunds and drainage measures \nin place. Once the water has drained through the material, it is suitable to fertilize fields as such \nmaterials  are  often  rich  in  organic  matter.  Therefore,  wherever  possible,  reuse  of  disposed \nmaterials in agriculture will be considered. Rehabilitation of irrigation schemes will exclude tanks \nthat require raising of bunds, as this would increase the inundation area. \n\n10. \nThe  impacts  associated  with  the  rehabilitation  of  buildings  are  minimal  and  typical  of \nthose experienced during any construction activity. They can be managed. Impacts associated \nwith operations such as solid waste disposal, waste water management, and drainage are dealt \nwith  during  the  design  of  such  buildings.  In  particular,  rehabilitation  of  medical  centers  should \nensure  that  proper  systems  are  in  place  to  separate  clinical  waste  from  other  waste,  and  that \nappropriate  design  and  operational  measures  are  in  place  to  deal  with  the  disposal  of  such \nwaste.  Appropriate measures are required to address these impacts and should be included in \nthe designs submitted to local authorities, as per the requirements of the building code to obtain \nthe building permits.  \n\nD. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment for Components \n\n11. \nTo ensure that the supplementary finance project meets ADB's environmental safeguard \nrequirements  stipulated  in  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  subprojects  will  be  screened  to \ndetermine  the  level  of  environmental  assessment  required.  Based  on  preliminary  information \navailable on the type of project activities, the rehabilitation of roads, water supply, and irrigation, \nas well as hospital construction are expected to have limited environmental impacts. As such, \nthey  would  need \ntogether  with  environmental \nmanagement  plans  (EMPs).  The  rehabilitation  of  buildings  will  also  be  screened  to  determine \ntheir environmental impact category, and if required, environmental assessments will be carried \nout.  The  PMU  is  responsible  for  screening  the  subprojects,  conducting  the  necessary \nenvironmental assessments, and submitting them to ADB for concurrence.  \n\ninitial  environment  examinations  (IEEs) \n\nConsultants funded under the project will support the implementing agency in preparing \n12. \nthe necessary environmental assessments, if required. All IEEs including EMPs will be prepared \nreviewed and cleared by ADB, and approved by the government, as required, prior to issuance \nof  bid  documents  and  award  of  construction  contracts.  Bid  documents  will  include  the \nrequirement to incorporate adequate resources for implementing the EMP, which will form part \nof the contract document and, if required, will need to be updated during project implementation. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f     \n\n  Appendix 10  47 \n \n\nE. \n\n Consultation, Information Disclosure, and Grievance Redress Mechanism \n\n13. \nDuring  planning  and  implementation,  beneficiary  and  affected  communities  will  be \nconsulted to ensure that their concerns and needs are addressed. The consultation process will \nbe well documented in the environmental assessment reports. During the consultations, the IA \nwill  provide  relevant  environmental  information,  including  information  from  the  IEE  documents \nand in a form understandable to affected people and other stakeholders.  This information will \nbe  shared  with  all  beneficiaries  and  project-affected  persons.  Project  information  will  be \ndisseminated in local languages, and environmental assessment reports will be made available \nto  all  project-affected  persons  in  a  publicly  accessible  place.  While  there  is  no  mandatory \ndisclosure  of  IEE  reports  for  category  B  subprojects,  the  IEE  will  be  made  available  to  any \nmember of the public, if requested. \n\nDuring  the  preparation  of  the  environmental  assessment  reports,  the  PMU  and \n14. \nimplementing  agency  will  discuss  and  agree  on  a  suitable  grievance  redress  mechanism  in \nconsultation with other stakeholders. The grievance redress mechanism shall be in place during \nconstruction  and  operation,  until  project  closure.  The  grievance  mechanism  shall  tame  into \naccount  specific  cultural  attributes  as  well  as  traditional  mechanisms  for  raising  and  resolving \nissues.    The  grievance  redress  system  will  allow  parties  affected  by  project  activities  to  raise \ntheir  concerns  to  contractors,  government  officials,  and  officers  of  the  implementing  agency \nincluding  environmental  and  social  safeguard  specialists.  The  grievance  redress  committees \n(GRCs)  are  formed  in  districts  to  address  land  and  compensation  disputes  and  grievances. \nThey will also be the forum for addressing environmental grievances. The borrower/client should \nalso be aware of judicial and administrative mechanisms available in the country for resolution \nof disputes, and should not impede access to these mechanisms. The adoption of a grievance \nredress  mechanism  will  facilitate  timely  implementation  of  the  project.  The  GRC  will  meet  as \nnecessary and when grievances are referred to it for redress at locations and times convenient \nto displaced persons. Records of all GRC meetings and proceedings will be kept at the PMU. \n\nA  grievance  action  form  will  be  used  to  record  all  grievances  and  actions  taken.  The \n15. \ninformation to be recorded in this form will (at a minimum) contain (i) basic information about the \naffected  person  (name,  address,  contact  number);  (ii)  date  of  last  disclosure  meeting;  (iii) \ncategory  of  grievance  filed  (e.g.,  legal,  social,  environmental,  technical  and/or  engineering, \nfinancial);  (iv)  detailed  description  of  grievance;  and  (v)  type  of  action  taken  (resolved  at  the \nGRC) or referred to higher authorities. The grievance action form will be filled out by the GRC \nmember  receiving  a  grievance  and  signed  by  the  affected  party  and  the  receiver  of  the \ncomplaint. The affected party will receive a copy signed by both.  \n\nF. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements and Responsibilities  \n\nThe following review procedure will be adopted to facilitate identification and mitigation \n\n16. \nof potential environmental problems and risks related to each subproject. \n \n17. \n \n\nThe implementing agencies will have the following responsibilities: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nDetermine  the  environmental  category  of  each  subproject  where  the \nenvironmental category has already not been determined.  \nInform  and  consult  project  affected  persons  and  beneficiaries  during \npreparation of the IEE report  \nPrepare  an  IEE  report  with  EMP  for  each  subproject  categorized  as \ncategory B, and submit the documents to ADB for review and clearance. \n\n \n\n\f \n48 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nObtain  environmental  clearance  from  the  project  approving  agency  (if \nrequired)  and  ADB  for  environmental  compliance  before  awarding  any \ncivil works contracts for the subproject.  \nInclude  environmental  safeguards  to  be  adopted  during  construction  in \nthe contract documents of all subprojects. For a subproject that requires \nan  IEE,  its  contract  documents  will  also  include  clauses  for  the \nimplementation of environmental mitigation measures, as described in the \nIEE  report  and  EMP,  and  the  implementing  agency  will  obtain  the \napproval of the project approving agency, if required.  \n \n\nADB will have the following responsibilities: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nEnsure  that  the  executing  agency  informs  and  consults  all  stakeholders \nas prescribed in the SPS. \nReview IEE reports and approve qualifying subprojects.  \nMonitor the implementation of mitigation measures through project review \nmissions,  and  conduct  environmental  performance  monitoring,  as \nnecessary. \nUpload the monitoring reports upon receipt. \n \nMonitoring and Reporting \n\n(iv) \n\n19. \nThe  implementing  agency  will  ensure  that  ADB  is  given  access  to  undertake \nenvironmental monitoring of all subprojects. However, the implementing agency of a subproject \nis  responsible  for  monitoring  and  reporting  to  ADB  and  the  approving  agency  on  the \nimplementation of environmental mitigation measures, as described in the IEE report and EMP. \nIf  the  implementing  agency  does  not  have  the  requisite  staff  to  monitor  the  implementation  of \nthe EMP, the implementing agency could engage consultants through the project. \n \n20. \nQuarterly  progress  review  reports  submitted  by  the  implementing  agency  to  ADB  shall \ninclude the progress of environmental monitoring and highlight any other environmental issues \nthat  may  have  arisen  during  implementation, as  well  as  the  measures  taken  to  address  them. \nThe  implementing  agency  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  environmental  assessment \ndocuments,  including  the  environmental  monitoring  reports,  are  maintained  systematically  as \npart  of  the  subproject  record.  Environmental  monitoring  reports  will  be  forwarded  to  ADB \nsemiannually. \n \n\nTable A10: Environmental Checklist \n\nDoes the subproject wholly or partly fall within any of these \ncategories? \n1.

These  areas \ninclude parts of Jaffna, Mannar, Vavuniya, Kilinochchi, and Mullaitivu districts. The subprojects \nwill  cover  the  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  damaged  social  and  physical  infrastructure, \nsuch  as  rural  minor  access  roads,  minor  irrigation,  community  water  supply,  hospitals,  and \nschool buildings. The subprojects will also support the early recovery and restoration of income \nsources  and  livelihoods  of  conflict-affected  persons.  Most  of  physical  works  associated  with \nthese  subprojects  will  take  place  at  their  original  locations,  and  therefore  will  not  require  land \nacquisition  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and  other  resettlement  impacts  of  the  supplementary \nfinance project. 1 \n \n2. \nResettlement  impacts  of  specific  subprojects  of  the  supplementary  loan  will  only  be \nknown during project implementation. As a result, the preparation of resettlement plans cannot \nbe  done  before  approval  of  the  supplementary  loan.  The  resettlement  framework  sets  out  the \npolicy and procedures for screening project subprojects to identify resettlement impacts, if any, \nand to guide the executing agency and implementing agencies on how to prepare resettlement \nplans to address such impacts adequately and to implement them effectively. \n \n3. \nIf a subproject has involuntary resettlement impacts, a resettlement plan will be prepared \nto  address  such  impacts.  It  will  be  implemented  following  the  guidelines  given  in  the \nresettlement framework. The entitlement matrix of the resettlement framework will indicate the \napproved  safeguard  entitlement  for  each  resettlement  impact  of  the  project.  During  project \nimplementation,  if  any  other  resettlement  impact  is  identified,  the  executing  agency  of  the \nproject,  in  consultation  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  will  revise  the  entitlement \nmatrix to address such impacts. \n \nB. \n \nLivelihood  support.  A  wide  range  of  village-level  subprojects  across  several  sectors \n4. \nwill  help  restore  livelihoods.  These  subprojects  include  skills  development,  water  supply \nschemes,  and  community  mobilizations,  particularly  where  the  internally  displaced  people  are \nreturning to their original locations. The main activities of livelihood restoration include training, \nhome garden improvements, fisheries development, seeds production, and fishing.  \n \n5. \nSchool  buildings.  The damaged school buildings and teacher housing facilities will be \nrehabilitated, teachers will be provided training, and schools will be provided other facilities for \nthe students.   \n \n6. \nIrrigation.  The  project  will  rehabilitate  the  selected  medium  and  minor  irrigation \nschemes  to  augment  irrigation  water  supplies  to  agriculture.  Tank  bunds,  access  roads, \nchannels, and other structures will be rehabilitated. \n\nSubprojects with Resettlement Impacts  \n\n                                                 \n1  Resettlement impacts arise from physical displacement (relocation, loss of residential land, or loss of shelter and \neconomic  displacement  (loss  of  land,  assets,  access  to  assets,  income  sources,  or  means  of  livelihood).  They \ncould be permanent or temporary, and full or partial. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f     \n\n  Appendix 11  51 \n \n\nPublic  offices.  The  project  will  support  the  rehabilitation  of  office  buildings.  District \n7. \nadministrative offices, courthouses, and associated facilities will be provided in some districts to \nenable the restoration of civil administration. \n\n \nHealth.  Primary and secondary care health facilities will be rehabilitated, and hospitals \n8. \nwill  be  reconstructed  and  refurbished  with  provision  of  medical  equipment  and  furniture, \nincluding construction of doctors' quarters and dispensaries damaged during the conflict. \n\nScope, Policy Framework, and Entitlements \n\n \nThe  rehabilitation  of  access  roads,  irrigation  systems,  and  water  supply  schemes,  and \n9. \nthe expansion of physical facilities are likely to have involuntary resettlement impacts. However, \nsuch impacts will be minor as most of the physical infrastructure will be rebuilt or rehabilitated at \ntheir original locations. \n \nC. \n \n10. \nInvoluntary \nis  based  on \nResettlement  Policy  of  2001,  the  involuntary  resettlement  policy  component  of  the  ADB \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement,2 the  Land  Acquisition  Act  of  Sri  Lanka,  and  various  government \nregulations  pertaining \nto  compensation  and  resettlement  assistance.  The  resettlement \nframework  distilled  the  relevant  policy  principles  from  these  sources,  and  they  reflect  the \nsafeguard policy requirements of the government and ADB. \n \n\nthe  Sri  Lanka  National \n\nThe  resettlement \n\nframework \n\n1. \n\nThe Scope of Resettlement Framework  \n\nThe  resettlement  framework  covers  involuntary  physical  displacement  and  economic \n11. \ndisplacement arising from land acquisition and restrictions on land use. Special attention is paid \nto the ownership rights of the affected persons. Any physical or economic displacement arising \nfrom the proposed project will require resettlement plans, formulated by following the guidelines \nof the resettlement framework.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPolicy Principles \n\nSri Lanka National Involuntary Resettlement Policy of 2001 lists several policy principles \n\n12. \nthat are applicable to all development projects: \n\n(i) \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement  should  be  avoided  or  reduced  as  much  as  possible  by \nreviewing alternatives to the project as well as alternatives within the project. \n\n(ii)  Where  involuntary  resettlement  is  unavoidable,  affected  people  should  be \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nassisted to reestablish themselves and improve their quality of life. \nGender  equality  and  equity  should  be  ensured  and  adhered  to  throughout  the \npolicy application. \nDisplaced  persons  should  be  fully  involved  in  the  selection  of  relocation  sites, \nlivelihood compensation, and development options as early as possible. \nReplacement  land  should  be  an  option  for  compensation  in  the  case  of  loss  of \nland; in the absence of replacement land cash compensation should be an option \nfor all displaced persons. \nCompensation  for  loss  of  land,  structures,  other  assets  and  income  should  be \nbased on full replacement cost and should be paid promptly. This should include \ntransaction costs. \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB. 2009. Safeguard Policy Statement. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n52 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n(vii)  Resettlement  should  be  planned  and  implemented  with  full  participation  of  the \n\nprovincial and local authorities. \n\n(x) \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  To assist those affected to be economically and socially integrated into the host \ncommunities, participatory measures should designed and implemented. \nCommon  property  resources  and  community  and  public  services  should  be \nprovided to project-affected people. \nResettlement should be planned as a development activity for the benefit of the \nproject-affected people. \nDisplaced persons who do not have documented little to land should receive fair \nand just treatment. \nVulnerable  groups  should  identified  and  given  appropriate  assistance  to \nsubstantially improve their living standards. \n\n(xii) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xiii)  Project  executing  agencies  should  bear  the  full  costs  of  compensation  and \n\nresettlement. \n\nThe following ADB safeguard policy principles will also apply to the project: \n(i) \n\nDevelop  procedures  in  a  transparent,  consistent,  and  equitable  manner  if  land \nacquisition  is  through  negotiated  settlement  to  ensure  that  those  people  who \nenter  into  negotiated  settlements  will  maintain  the  same  or  better  income  and \nlivelihood status. \nPay compensation and provide other resettlement entitlements before physical or \neconomic displacement. \nPrepare a resettlement plan elaborating on displaced persons' entitlements, the \nincome and livelihood restoration strategy, institutional arrangements, monitoring \nand reporting framework, budget, and time-bound implementation schedule. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n3. \n\nLand Acquisition Procedures \n\nThe  land  acquisition  method  is  the  application  of  the  Land  Acquisition  Act.  It  is  a  long \n14. \nprocess  that  follows  prescribed  steps  and  procedures.  The  executing  agency  will  take \nnecessary  actions  to  not  to  acquire  land  or  any  other  asset  under  the  Land  Acquisition  Act. \nHowever, if private lands are acquired, the affected persons are compensated according to the \nentitlement  matrix,  which  reflects  Sri  Lankan  laws  and  its  involuntary  resettlement  policy,  and \nthe ADB Safeguard Policy Statement.  \n  \n\n4. \n\nEntitlement Matrix \n\n15. \nThe  entitlement  matrix  is  not  exhaustive.  More  entitlements  may  be  added  if  any \nresettlement impact not listed in the matrix is identified during project implementation. However, \nthe entitlements may not be reduced or lowered. The entitlement matrix outlines the categories \nof resettlement impacts, displaced persons' entitlements, and implementation issues that need \nspecial attention of the executing agency and implementing agencies.  \n\n \n\n16. \nIn  accordance  with  the  involuntary  resettlement  framework,  displaced  persons  are \nentitled to a combination of compensation packages and resettlement assistance based on the \nnature  of  their  ownership  rights,  their  socioeconomic  vulnerability,  and  the  severity  of  the \nresettlement impacts. Their entitlements would include all or several of the following categories: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\ncompensation for permanent land losses at replacement cost, \ncompensation for temporary land losses at agreed rates,  \ncompensation  for  structures  (residential  and  commercial)  and  other  immovable \nassets at their replacement cost,  \n\n \n13. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f     \n\n  Appendix 11  53 \n \n\nassistance to restore and improve income sources and livelihoods,  \n(iv) \n(v) \nassistance for shifting belongings and salvaged items,  \n(vi)  market value of lost crops and trees at approved rates, \n(vii) \n(viii) \n\nrelocation facilities including housing and basic infrastructure, and \nrebuilding and/or restoration of community resources and facilities.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n54 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nREVISED PROJECT FINANCING PLAN \n\nTable A12.1: Revised Detailed Cost Estimates and Financing Plan (ADF Grant) \n($ million) \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nProject \n\nCofinancing  \n\nGovernment and \n\nGrant Activity \n\nCost \n\nSida \n\nAusAID \n\nBeneficiaries  \n\nADB \n\nADF \n\n8.60 \n\n0.00 \n\n2.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.40 \n\n1.00 \n\n2.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n14.00 \n\n \n14.00 \n\n \n15.85 \n \n4.80 \n \n2.00 \n \n0.50 \n\n0.40 \n\n1.00 \n\n2.00 \n\n0.30 \n\n0.30 \n\n27.15 \n \n3.80 \n30.95 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4.80 \n\n0.50 \n\n0.30 \n\n0.30 \n\n5.90 \n\n \n5.90 \n\n7.30 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.03 \n\n7.33 \n\n \n7.33 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n3.80 \n\n3.80 \n\n3.80 \n\n12.28% \n\n \n\n \n\n14.00 \n\n45.23% \n\n13.18 \n\n42.58% \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nAusAID = Australian Agency for International Development, Sida = Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency.  \nNotes:  \n1.

Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nBased  on  the  country  poverty  assessment,  the  country  partnership  strategy,  and  the  sector  analysis,  describes  how  the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the \npartner country. \n \nSri  Lanka's  poverty  reduction  strategy  is  included  in  the  10-year  development  framework  (10YDF)  2006\u20132016,  Mahinda \nChintana. ADB's country partnership strategy (CPS) 2009\u20132011 for Sri Lanka, approved in 2008, is aligned to the framework \nand the program for the next 3 years is focused on the government's priority areas. ADB\u2019s strategy focuses on the two pillars \nidentified  in  the  framework.  These  are  (i)  strengthening  the  investment  climate,  and  (ii)  achieving  socially  inclusive \ndevelopment.  The  first  pillar  deals  with  infrastructure  development  and  human  resource  development  to  improve \ncompetitiveness.  The  second  pillar  focuses  on  regional  disparities  and  looks  at  development  of  infrastructure  and \nadministrative and absorptive capacity in the poorer regions to improve the delivery of public services.    \n \nComprehensive  poverty  data  is  not  available  for  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces.  However,  poverty  in  the  former  conflict \nareas  is  significant,  with  government  figures  indicating  the  poverty  incidence  at  around  37%,  well  over  twice  the  national \naverage  but  still  likely  to  be  an  underestimate.  Destruction  of  assets  and  infrastructure,  displacement,  loss  of  life  and \nlivelihood, and destruction of the social fabric characterize the poverty situation in these areas, setting it apart from rest of the \ncountry. The 10-year development framework has a separate chapter on the conflict-affected areas and states that the current \npolicies are designed to protect and resettle displaced communities and to reconstruct the economic and physical and social \ninfrastructure with the aim of assuring sustained long-term development of Northern and Eastern provinces. With the ending \nof military operations in May 2009, reconstruction and development of the former conflict areas has become a priority for the \ngovernment. In May 2009 the government formulated a development plan for Northern province, similar to the one developed \nfor Eastern provinces as the government gained full control of that province. This is a 3-year plan, which looks at the same \nissues discussed in the Mahinda Chintana. \n  \nThrough  this  proposed  supplementary  loan  to  NECORD  II,  ADB  will  support  the  government's  efforts  to  meet  basic  human \nneeds, particularly of the returning IDPs, and assist them in restarting their livelihood activities through the reconstruction of \nessential community and social infrastructure damaged by the conflict. The emphasis will be on helping to reestablish the civil \nadministration,  basic  health  care  and  education  services  as  well  as  support  for  rural  electrification  schemes,  minor  access \nroads, minor irrigation, community water supply, and vocational and skills training for livelihood development. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                                  Targeting Classification: Poverty Intervention \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka: \nThe civil conflict over 3 decades has severely affected the communities in these areas. Loss of life, livelihoods, incomes, and \nproperty  has  resulted  in  significant  socioeconomic  and  psychological  stress.  In  the  conflict-affected  areas,  essential \ninvestments have not been made for a long time. \n \nThe project will meet basic human needs by reestablishing vital services such as fisheries and irrigation infrastructure, health \nand  educational  facilities,  water  supply,  agricultural  support  services,  and  institutions  to  revive  economic  activities.  This  will \nlead to employment, income generation, rehabilitation of displaced persons, and restoration of social stability in these areas.  \n \nImprovement of services and infrastructure will also encourage people to return to their original villages and settlements. With \nthis  end  in  view,  the  project  will  strengthen  health  and  educational  facilities,  while  bolstering  local  institutions.  Community-\nbased  organizations  will  be  established  and  supported,  saving  will  be  encouraged,  women  will  be  made  more  self-reliant, \nmicrocredit will be introduced, and recreational facilities will be provided.  \n                               \nIn  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces,  the  people  affected  by  the  conflict  are  especially  vulnerable  because  of  gender,  age, \ndisability,  and  general  breakdown  in  their  traditional  livelihood  systems.  Internally  displaced  persons  who  wish  to  return  to \ntheir  areas  of  origin  need  support  in  reestablishing  their  homes  and  their  livelihoods.  Essential  services  such  as  schools, \nhospitals, clinics, water, and power supply are lacking in these areas. The neglect of minor irrigation schemes has constrained \nagricultural  production.  Onetime  surplus  food  production  areas  have  become  food-deficit  areas.  Livestock  numbers  have \n\n \n\n\f \n62 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\ndeclined.  In  general,  the  provinces  have  suffered  extensive  dislocation  and  economic  progress  has  been  hampered.  These \nproblems  were exacerbated by the 2004 tsunami through loss of lives and property. Livelihoods, especially of fishers, have \nbeen destroyed. The psychological trauma from the loss of lives has been tremendous. \n \nThe people in the project areas face major challenges in terms of basic human needs: shelter, employment and livelihoods, \naccess  to  services  (education,  health,  agricultural  support  services,  irrigation,  markets,  and  power  supply),  and  community-\nbased institutions.  \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nThe beneficiaries of the project are a war-affected population that had suffered loss of family members, displacement, loss of \nproperty, lack of access to essential social services, and long years of violence and insecurity. Income levels and human \ndevelopment indicators for these areas are among the gravest in Sri Lanka. The conflict and lack of security were the principal \ncause for poverty and the most binding constraint to poverty reduction and economic development. Poverty in these areas is \ndue to war-related destruction of property and life, which has set back these regions from where they were prior to the war, \nand lack of development over the last 30 years. Restrictions on movement of people and taking over of property by parties to \nthe war have interrupted traditional livelihoods including in agriculture and fisheries. The needs of these communities are \nmanifold. It consists of rebuilding and restoration of infrastructure and systems, establishing community life in certain areas, \nprovision of basic social services, and connecting these regions with the rest of the country.   \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nConsultations were done with relevant government stakeholders and other development partners to identify needs and outline \nthe  scope  of  the  project.  As  IDPs  (internally  displaced  persons)  are  in  the  process  of  returning,  consultations  with \nbeneficiaries is limited. Beneficiary consultation and participation will be facilitated in subproject selection and implementation, \nwhere possible. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n Information sharing     \n\n Consultation   \n\n Collaborative decision making   \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes   \n\n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.).  \nAs the project was processed as an emergency loan, a C&P plan was not prepared.   \n \nMuch  of  the  project  will  be  implemented  through  stakeholder  consultation,  using  a  bottom-up  approach.  Subproject \nformulation,  design,  and  selection  will  be  through  community  consultation.  Local  participation  in  the  implementation  of \nsubprojects  will  be  encouraged  as  appropriate.  This  process  has  proven  highly  successful  in  other  ongoing  rehabilitation \nprojects in Northern and Eastern provinces.  \n \n\nC.  Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues.  \nStrategy  to  maximize  impacts  on  women:  Decades  of  conflict  have  devastated  community  and  family  life  in  Northern  and \nEastern  provinces.  Vulnerable  groups,  including  war  widows,  households  headed  by  women,  single  women  with  elderly \ndependents,  elderly,  and  disabled  persons,  have  increased  disproportionately  in  these  provinces.  This  presents  significant \nchallenges  in  these  communities  where  women  traditionally  have  many  other  disadvantages\u2014women  have  had  to  be  the \nprovider as well as the caregiver for the family. The project provides opportunities for both women and men to have access to \nbasic  facilities,  and  to  restart  or  initiate  livelihoods  and  micro  or  small  enterprise  activities.  While  the  project  will  support \ninternally displaced persons who have returned to their original habitats, the project will identify and target vulnerable groups, \nsuch as war widows, households headed by women, single women, in the project area in the provision of shelter and training \nin livelihood-related skills, and access to credit and technical support. The aim is to enable them to improve their economic \nstrength  and  contribute  to  the  enhanced  well-being  of  their  families.  The  project  will  engage  with  and  also  strengthen  the \ncapacity  of  local  CBOs  and  local  nongovernment  organizations,  especially  women's  NGOs,  enabling  them  to  act  as  a \nresource on gender awareness and skills development, and assist in and monitor gender-related project activities. \n \n2.

The GAP \nis  based  on  the  analysis  that  women  are  disadvantaged  and  discriminated  against  in \nsociocultural,  economic,  and  political  spheres  of  life;  and  they  are  denied  equal  access  to \nresources,  services,  and  opportunities  that  would  enable  them  to  participate  in,  contribute  to, \nand  benefit  fully  from  development  processes  in  the  country. 1 The  project  will  encourage  and \nsupport the increased participation of women in needs assessment and consultation, as well as \nin planning and implementing activities in different sectors through the components of NECORD \nII supplementary loan. The GAP will give particular attention to \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe  equal  participation  of  and  benefit  to  women  and  men  in  urban  and  village \nreconstruction and development activities and processes;  \nthe recovery of livelihood and economic activities for both women and men, with \nspecial  attention  paid  to  the  introduction  of  and  support  for  livelihood  and \nenterprise  activities  for  war  widows,  households  headed  by  women,  and  single \nwomen with elderly dependents in the project areas; and \nthe  equal  access  of  women  and  men  to  infrastructure  activities  in  relation  to \nplanning and construction, as users and in maintenance. \n\n \n2. \nThe  GAP  will  be  implemented  through  the  existing  and  planned  implementation \nmechanisms  for  NECORD  II.  The  capacity  of  implementing  agencies  will  be  strengthened \nthrough  training.  Consultants  and  consulting  agency  services  will  be  engaged,  where \nnecessary, to enable the effective implementation of the GAP. \n \n\nTable A15: Gender Action Plan \n \n\nSector \nHealth \n\nOutputs \n \n\nTargets \n \n\nHealth facilities  \n\nHIV/AIDS campaign  \n\nAbout 45 medical facilities to cover more \nthan 120,000 families, restored \n\nAwareness on HIV/AIDS raised among \nmore than 5,000 families and \nconstruction workers  \n\nEnsure that health facilities cater to \nthe special physical and psychological \nneeds of conflict-affected men, \nwomen, children, the elderly and the \ndisabled. \n\nEnsure wage parity for male and \nfemale labor in reconstruction of \nhealth facilities. \n\nEnsure that the health facilities have \nseparate units for STI and HIV/AIDS \nand psychological care providing \ninformation, testing services, and \ntreatment. \n\nRecruit women and men (from state \nand NGO sectors) with appropriate \nskills to deliver awareness and \nprevention training on HIV/AIDS to \ncontractors, construction personnel \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2008.
