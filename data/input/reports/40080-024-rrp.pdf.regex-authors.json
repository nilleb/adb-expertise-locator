THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the ADB Clean Technology \nFund,1 both to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Strengthening Sustainable Urban \nTransport for Ha Noi Metro Line 3 Project.2 \n \n2.  The project will support the effective and sustainable use of the Ha Noi metro line 3, \nwhich is now being developed with Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance.3 It will improve \naccess to metro line 3 stations, enhance connectivity between the line and other modes of \npublic  and  private  transport,  and  strengthen  urban  transport  policies  and  regulations.  By \ncontributing to an efficient, integrated, and sustainable metro system, the project will support the \nHa Noi urban transport master plan objectives of increasing the use of public transport and \nreducing dependency on private vehicles. 4 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The Government of Viet Nam is investing in major public transport infrastructure to \ninduce a substantial switch by urban citizens from private to public modes of transport.5 A failure \nto invest in public transport infrastructure and to encourage this shift away from the use of \nprivate  vehicles  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  large  cities  will  hurt  economic  growth  and  accelerate  the \ndegradation of the urban environment. The government is supporting climate change mitigation \nefforts by adopting a low-carbon transport growth path that will be more energy efficient and \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions. ADB\u2019s 2012\u20132015 country partnership strategy for Viet Nam \nsupports the government's program to improve urban transport infrastructure and promote the \nuse of public transport.6 \n  \n4.  Ha Noi is at an early stage of urban transport development, having moved from heavy \nusage of bicycles to motorcycles and now increasingly to cars. Private vehicles dominate urban \ntransportation,  about  90%  of  which  consists  of  motorcycles.  Continued  increasing  car \nownership, together with a significant increase in the number of motorcycles, has resulted in \nsevere congestion during peak hours, resulting in degradation of the urban environment and a \nrise in traffic accidents. The situation is expected to worsen if the current traffic growth trend of \n9% per year continues and more motorbike users convert to cars. The existing public transport \nsystem consists of an inadequate bus network that is becoming less competitive with private \nmodes of transport.7 Traffic planning and parking management is weak and unable to effectively \nhandle  traffic  and  demand.  Importantly,  there  are  no  policy  and  regulatory  measures  to \n                                                \n1  Financed by the Clean Technology Fund.  \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3   The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Strengthening \nSustainable Urban Transport for Ha Noi Metro Line 3 Project. Manila. (TA-7894-VIE). \n4  ADB Clean Technology Fund financing is based upon the sustainable transport benefits of the metro line 3 \ninvestment. \n5  Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, 13th National Assembly. 2011. Socio-Economic Development Plan for the 2011\u2013\n2015 Period.  Ha Noi. \n6  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Viet Nam, 2012\u20132015. Manila. \n7  Improvements to the bus system are expected under an ongoing World Bank project that will implement a bus \nrapid transit line, establish a public transport authority, and improve bus operations and management systems by \n2016. ", "2 \ndiscourage private modes of transport, so the existing inadequate public transport system is not \nattractive to private vehicle users. \n \n5.  The  Ha  Noi  People\u2019s  Committee  (HPC)  plans  to  develop  a  city-wide  mass  transit \nsystem, and four metro lines and one bus rapid transit line are currently under development. \nConstruction of phase 1 for metro line 3 commenced in October 2010 and it is expected to be \noperating  in  2019.8 The  three  other metro  lines  are  expected  to  be completed by  2020.9 \nHowever,  complementary  measures  building  upon  other  sector  reforms  to  improve  public \ntransport will need to be designed to ensure the emergence of an integrated public transport \nsystem  that  is  attractive,  accessible,  and  affordable.  The  proposed  project  will  support  a \nmultimodal, integrated transport system to attract passengers from private vehicles to public \ntransport  services.  This  modal  shift  will  promote  inclusive  low-carbon  transport,  thereby \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution. \n \n6.  The project will directly support the integration of metro line 3 into the public transport \nnetwork by providing infrastructure to improve connectivity to metro line 3 stations through \nfeeder bus links. The project will develop integrated multimodal stations for metro line 3 with \nparking  plans  and  park-and-ride  facilities  to  improve  station  accessibility.  The  supporting \ninfrastructure,  public  transport  services,  and  other facilities  will  be  designed  to  incorporate \ngender-sensitive features that will complement similar measures under the metro line 3 project \n(footnote 8). In addition, policy and regulatory measures developed will be fully inclusive by \naddressing the needs of all potential public transport users. The proposed institutional capacity \nbuilding measures for metro agencies, together with expected policy and regulatory reforms, will \nalso help achieve an improved public transport system and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The  impact  of the  project  will  be  an  enhanced  public  transport system  serving  six \ndistricts of Ha Noi.10 The outcome will be the improved integration of metro line 3 stations with \nother modes of public transport. \n \nC.  Outputs \n8.  Metro line 3 station accessibility improved. These improvements, including public \ntransport facilities, will be constructed along the first stage of metro line 3 from Nhon to Ha Noi \nmain railway station, up to 500 meters from the four underground and eight elevated stations \nalong the 12.5 km line. Civil works will include pedestrian subways and footbridges, bus stops \nand feeder links, dedicated taxi stands, park-and-ride facilities for two-wheeled vehicles, and \nwaiting areas for other public transport service providers. All infrastructure and other facilities \nwill  have  gender-sensitive  and  universal  accessibility  features  and  safe  passageways  for \npedestrians. The project will also establish a station access management system to facilitate the \nefficient flow of people and traffic around metro line 3 stations. Enforcement measures will be \nimproved to ensure clear pedestrian access and smooth traffic flow and to manage parking of \nprivate vehicles around the metro stations. The project will finance consulting services for \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2011.

Public transport system improved. The project will provide 52 buses to service bus \nfeeder lines and an information system along metro line 3. The information system will be linked \nto the main bus control center in Ha Noi to provide real-time bus and train arrival information \nthat will make the public transport system more convenient and reliable. The project will include \nthe installation of equipment for the information system at the metro line 3 stations, including \nrequired equipment on buses and at bus stops.  \n \n10.   Public transport policy developed. To support the objectives of the Ha Noi urban \ntransport master plan and make public transport more financially sustainable, the project will \nprovide  consulting  services  to  develop  (i)  a  station  access  management  system  and \nenforcement measures to ensure clear pedestrian access and proper use of public space by \nvendors around the stations; (ii) a station parking policy to facilitate the efficient flow of vehicles \nto and from the metro line 3 stations; and (iii) a policy framework on public transport ticketing \nand pricing of public and private transport in Ha Noi to promote a modal shift from private \nvehicles to the public transport system. The project will include capacity development and \ntraining to enable the Ha Noi transport agencies to implement and enforce the new policies and \nregulations. It will also provide equipment and consulting services to establish comprehensive \nmultimodal transport and traffic management modeling systems that will be used to develop \ndetailed pilot schemes to improve the integration of the public transport system.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n11.   The project is estimated to cost $58.95 million, consisting of $44.10 million in base costs \n(including  local  taxes  and  duties),  $13.70  million  for  contingencies,  and  $1.15  million  for \nfinancing charges during construction (Table 1). The investment cost will include civil works \n(48.63% of the total cost), systems and equipment (30.26% of the total cost), and consulting \nservices  (16.71%  of  the  total  cost).  Detailed  cost  estimates  are  provided  in  the  project \nadministration manual.11 \n \n12.  The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR2,810,000 \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year \nterm, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements. The loan will be made available to the HPC as a grant in accordance with the loan \nand project agreements. \n \n13.  The  ADB  Clean  Technology  Fund  will  provide  loan  cofinancing  equivalent  to \n$48.95 million, to be administered by ADB. The loan will have a 40-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 10 years, a management fee of 0.18% per annum on the undisbursed balance of the \nloan, and an interest charge of 0.25%, in accordance with the loan agreement. The government \nwill onlend $15,945,000 to the HPC under a subsidiary loan agreement on terms and conditions \nsatisfactory to ADB and will make the remaining $33,005,000 available to the HPC as a grant in \naccordance with the loan and project agreements. \n \n \n                                                \n11 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n \nItem      Amounta \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The  executing  agency  will  be  the  HPC  and  the  implementing  agency  will  be  the \nDepartment of Transport (DOT). The Urban Transport Project Management Unit (UTPMU), \nunder the DOT, will be responsible for implementing the activities under the project outputs. A \nproject management steering committee will be established by the HPC to be responsible for \nproject  oversight  and  coordination.  Established  in  1985,  the  UTPMU  has  previously \nimplemented internationally financed projects and has strong leadership, a sound organizational \nstructure, and the potential to develop its institutional capacity as the public transport system \nexpands.  The UTPMU has the financial capacity and resource management to implement the \nproject. Training will be provided in specific areas to further build capabilities of the UTPMU for \nimplementing internationally financed projects. \n \n ", "5 \n16.  The UTPMU will establish a project implementation division (PID) under the director, \nwhich will be responsible for the day-to-day project management and implementation. The PID \nwill ensure compliance with ADB procurement and consulting and disbursement guidelines and \nADB safeguard policies. The PID staff will be assisted by experienced engineers, accountants, \nand other staff from the UTPMU, as required. The project administration requirements are \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual (footnote 11). Since the project is \nfinanced from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with ADB-administered cofinancing, universal \nprocurement will apply to all contract packages financed under the project.12  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  June 2015\u2013December 2018 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2018 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Director general, Foreign External Relations Department, Ministry of Planning \nand Investment \n(ii)   Executing agency  Ha Noi People\u2019s Committee \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  Department of Transport \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Project implementation division to be set up in the Urban Transport Project \nManagement Unit, 16 staff  \nProcurementa  International competitive bidding  1 contract  $13.7 million \nNational competitive bidding  6 contracts  $20.6 million \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection  942 person-months  $8.7 million \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank.  \na All civil works and equipment will be financed by the ADB Clean Technology Fund loan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n17.  The  project  implementation  schedule  will  be  aligned  with  progress made  by  ADB\u2019s \nongoing metro line 3 project (footnote 8). Most of the civil works will be carried out once the \nmetro line 3 station construction work is near completion, particularly for facilities above the \nunderground stations.13 This will require coordination between the Ha Noi Metropolitan Railway \nManagement  Board  and  the  DOT,  as  well  as  between  their  respective  contractors  and \nconsultants. The HPC vice-president will be responsible for both projects to ensure a high \ndegree of coordination and cooperation. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n18.  The  project\u2019s  public  transport  improvement  measures  and  the  metro  line  3  station \ninterchange and access facilities will be innovative and are designed to be replicated in other \nparts of the city to make public transport sustainable. Pedestrian access within 500 meters of \nmetro stations, particularly in local alleyways, will be enhanced by upgrading sidewalks. This will \ninclude  protection  measures  for  pedestrian  safety  and  support  for  bicycle  usage.  Physical \nmeasures will include park-and-ride facilities at three stations, bus feeder lines, and dedicated \nparking areas for public transport vehicles. The nonphysical measures, such as the station \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2013.

Manila. \n13 Works above the underground metro line 3 stations cannot commence until the stations reach the final stage of \nsurface-level works, including road pavement reinstatement. \n ", "6 \naccess management system, will include controls on parking and the use of public space in and \naround the stations. The public transport information system will enhance integration between \nthe metro and bus services (para. 5).   \n \n19.  Policies and regulations to support the public transport system will be developed to \nmanage pedestrians and vehicles around the metro line 3 stations. The new policies and \nregulations, combined with institutional capacity building measures, will bring the benefits of an \nintegrated, multimodal public transport system to the city and its residents. The combination of \nphysical infrastructure and policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms provided by the project is \nexpected to increase ridership on metro line 3 by more than 10% over current forecast ridership \nand reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 15% (equivalent to 540,000 tons of carbon \ndioxide over the project\u2019s 20-year lifetime) over emissions without these improvements. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n20.  The main economic benefits will be the reduction of travel time for public transport users \nthrough  improved  access  and  egress  at  metro  stations,  less  congestion  around  stations, \nenhanced comfort and convenience, and savings in vehicle operating costs due to an envisaged \nshift from private to public transport. A reduction in the congestion on city roads, improvements \nto  the  environment,  and  fewer  fatalities  from  accidents  involving  private  vehicles  will  be \nimportant indirect benefits, even though they are minor in economic terms. The  economic \nanalysis  estimates  the  project\u2019s  economic  internal  rate  of  return  to  be  14.0%  when  only \nconsidering direct user impacts, and 17.2% when integrating indirect benefits, for an economic \nnet present value discounted at 12.0% of $15.2 million.14 Sensitivity testing showed that the \neconomic internal rate of return would remain equal to or above 12% if (i) the capital costs rose \nby not more than 30% over the base-case projection, (ii) the projected benefits did not fall by \nmore than 20%, or (iii) the capital costs rose by 15% and the project benefits fell by 15% at the \nsame time. \n \n21.  The  HPC  will  be  the  project  owner  and  will  be  responsible  for  operation  and \nmaintenance after project completion. Ha Noi\u2019s municipal budget is financed directly through \nnational and city taxes, duties, and other revenue sources.15 The HPC will ensure assignment of \na share of the public transport funding that is within the city\u2019s budget resources for operation \nand maintenance of the project components. The future financial position of the HPC confirms \nits  financial  capacity  to  cover  the  recurrent  expenditures  of  the  project  to  ensure  the \nsustainability of facilities developed under the project. \n \nC.  Governance \n22.  Loan disbursement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements between the government, the \nHPC, and the DOT. The DOT will maintain separate financial records and accounts to identify \nfinancing resources received and project expenditures, including goods, works, and services \nfinanced out of the loan proceeds and local funds. The loan accounts and related financial \nstatements will be audited annually, in accordance with sound auditing standards by an auditor \nacceptable  to  ADB,  and  made  public.  Details  on  disbursement,  auditing,  and  financial \nmanagement are provided in the project administration manual (footnote 11). \n \n                                                \n14 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 The city retains 28% of all national revenue against future budgetary support transfers from the Ministry of Finance. \n ", "7 \n23.  A  financial  management  assessment  found  that  the  DOT  has  acceptable  financial \nmanagement capacity and experience in managing and implementing similar projects but has \nlimited experience and knowledge of ADB\u2019s financial management requirements. To improve its \nfinancial management capacity for implementing the project, the DOT will engage external \nfinancial  management  consultants  to  provide  support  and  assistance  to  the  UTPMU.  The \nfinancial  management  consultants  will  train  the  UTPMU\u2019s  accounting  staff  in  ADB  loan \ndisbursement  procedures  and  financial  management  practices.  If  needed,  the  UTPMU  will \nensure that sufficient accounting staff is available for effective financial management during \nimplementation by recruiting and/or mobilizing extra accountants. \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, the HPC, and the DOT. HPC will ensure contracts clearly include ADB \nright  to  examine  records  and  accounts,  and  complete  periodic  inspections  of  contractor \nactivities. HPC will publicly disclose on the project website information on the use of loan \nproceeds for procurement of each contract. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 11). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n25.  A  social  action  plan  has  been  prepared  for  the  project,  based  on  a  social  impact \nassessment. Smooth accessibility to the metro line 3 stations and the integration of the metro \nwith the bus system and other modes of transport will benefit women, students, children, and \nolder people, who are identified as the primary users of public transport. The project will improve \neconomies in the metro line 3 localities by creating business opportunities, reducing congestion, \nimproving quality of life in areas around stations, and developing a public transport pricing \nframework  to  make  fares  affordable.  The  six  project  districts  will  benefit  from  temporary \nconstruction jobs and local employment in operation and maintenance. \n \n26.  Greater safety risks constitute a potential adverse social impact for the larger numbers of \npedestrians expected to walk along roads near the stations. Pedestrian safety risks will be \nmitigated by providing footbridges and pedestrian subways and good traffic control around the \nstations. The detailed design will follow universal accessibility and pedestrian safety guidelines. \n \n27.  The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. The gender action plan \nensures that appropriate physical design related to the accessibility of rail, metro, and bus \nservices pays attention to affordability and meets the various travel patterns and needs of \nwomen. Proposed measures include (i) accessibility design features such as safe pedestrian \naccess,  adequate  lighting,  and  installation  of  closed-circuit  TV  around  stations;  (ii)  priority \nseating and allocated waiting spaces for women; (iii) 30% of unskilled civil works jobs provided \nto  women;  (iv)  ticketing  and  fare  pricing  structured  to  increase  affordability  and  access; \n(v) pedestrian-friendly traffic management and traffic calming measures; and (vi) gender issues \nincorporated into all intermodal public transport policy and regulations.16 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  Under the ADB and Clean Technology Fund framework agreement, the requirements of \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) will apply to all project components financed by the \nADB Clean Technology Fund. The project is assessed category B for environment. The initial \nenvironmental examination, which has been prepared in accordance with the Safeguard Policy \n                                                \n16  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nStatement, has been posted on ADB website on 10 November 2014.17 No natural ecosystems \nexist in the project area, which is heavily populated. Land use is predominantly commercial or \nresidential. The project will not involve major civil works and is not likely to result in significant \nadverse environmental impacts during construction and operation. Public consultations with \naffected people were conducted during preparation of the initial environmental examination, in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s information disclosure and consultation requirements. The DOT will \nensure that the environmental management plan is included in all bid documents.  \n \n29.  A grievance redress mechanism will be established prior to commencement of site \nworks. The construction supervision consultant will conduct environmental management training \nto help the DOT monitor and report on the environmental performance of contractors. \n \n30.  The project is assessed category C for involuntary resettlement. Land adjoining Ngoc \nKhanh station will be provided unencumbered to the project in 2018. This land will be acquired \nunder the ADB-financed metro line 3 project (footnote 8) in full compliance with the Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement,  to  be  used  as  a  construction  work  area  by  a  contractor  under  the \naforementioned project. Resettlement due diligence of the project sites has indicated that there \nwill be no other involuntary resettlement impacts.18 The project is assessed category C for \nindigenous peoples safeguards. \n  \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  The project faces risks related to its innovative character, demands on executing and \nimplementing agency capacity, dependence on timely execution by and coordination with other \nprojects, and need for effective transport reforms to fully achieve the project impact. These risks \nwill be mitigated through provision of international expert support to the DOT for development of \ndesigns, and project management. In view of the DOT\u2019s limited experience with ADB guidelines \nand  policies,  mitigation  measures  to  address  associated  public  financial  management  and \nprocurement risks, as detailed in the project administration manual (footnote 11), will require \nclose monitoring to ensure effective implementation of proposed support measures. \n \n32.  The project must be sequenced with implementation progress on the metro line 3. The \nimplementation delay risk this poses will be mitigated through the government\u2019s institutional \narrangements,  project  management  support,  and  coordination  with  development  partners \nsupporting public transport investments in Ha Noi. Because the viability of the project relies on \nachieving  the  passenger  levels  and  patronage  projected  for  the  metro  line  3,  insufficient \ngovernment commitment to implementing the policy and regulatory reforms in promoting a \nmodal shift from private to public transport is a key risk. This will be mitigated by providing \nadvisory services and training to public transport agencies on modernizing and integrating the \npublic transport system. The HPC is responsible for ensuring that its plans to modernize the \ncity\u2019s bus fleet and its operations and to provide efficient links and an effective interchange \nsystem with the new metro lines are developed on time. Corruption risk will be mitigated through \nan action plan to ensure identified accountable agencies comply with tasks, making project \ninformation more publicly available, strengthening financial management and internal audits will \nbe segregated from project management. Major risks and mitigating measures are described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.19 Overall, the benefits and positive \nimpacts of the project are expected to outweigh any mitigation costs. \n                                                \n17 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Resettlement Due Diligence Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n \nIV.
