The NCPs \nencompass 35,296 square kilometers, had a population of 5.8 million in 2015, and have high rates \nof  rural  poverty.  The  project  will  benefit  about  1  million  people  through  the  implementation  of \nlocally  prioritized  basic  infrastructure  subprojects,  including  (i)  upgrading  district  roads;  (ii) \nimproving  productive  and  business  infrastructure  such  as  (a)  rural  domestic  water  supply \nschemes (RDWS),  (b) coastal  defenses  and flood protection,  (c)  a  river port,  and  (d)  irrigation \nreservoirs; and (iii) establishing provincial public asset management systems.1 \n\n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nRobust economic growth has been the key driver of poverty reduction in Viet Nam. Growth \nof the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) has been among the world\u2019s fastest, averaging an \nannual 6% from 2010 to 2015. While starting from a lower base, the regional GDP of the NCPs \ngrew at 15% annually in the same period. In 2015, the national GDP per capita reached $2,215, \nwhile in the NCPs it ranged from $1,210 in Nghe An to $1,933 in Ha Tinh.2 GDP growth in Ha \nTinh  is  attributed  to  investments  in  the  construction  of  economic  zones,  seaport  development, \nand the steel industry, which is now generating industrial output and employment. In Nghe An, \nagriculture  modernization  has  increased  dairy  and  beef  output.  In Quang Binh  and Quang Tri, \nlarge-scale  wood  processing  for  chip  export  is  transitioning  to  value  added  production  of \nfiberboards. \n \n4. \nThe NCPs are located at the convergence of the north\u2013south and east-west land transport \nsystems, and are the shortest distance from the eastern seacoast to the western border with the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). NCPs benefit from access to the sea used by one-\nthird of global shipping lines, and processed with rich resources including lucrative fisheries with \nannual  stocks  estimated  at  600,000  tons,  and  significant  oil  and  gas  reserves.  The  seacoast \nprovides tourism potential and export logistic efficiency, linking to the Red River Delta in the north \nand the Mekong Delta in the south. The NCPs have five border gates with the Lao PDR, providing \naccess deep into the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) particularly through the GMS East\u2013West \nEconomic Corridor. \n \nThe  NCPs\u2019  location  provides  opportunities  for  investment  in  processing  and  industrial \n5. \nproduction. The seacoast enables the NCPs to develop (i) an offshore fisheries industry with an \nallowable annual catch valued at $0.2 billion, where 85% of fish processing is done by women; \n(ii) an aquaculture industry  covering 28,000 hectares with about 110,000 fish farms; and (iii) a \ndiversified  tourism  industry  employing  40,000  people  and  generating  $0.34  billion  in  returns. \nTrade logistics, industrial investment, increased urbanization, and human resource development \nwill underpin structural changes in the economies of the NCPs, with flow-on benefits including \n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided the project preparatory Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic \nof Viet Nam for the Basic Infrastructure for Inclusive Growth in the Northeast Provinces Sector  Project (TA 8957-\nVIE).  \n\n2  Government of Viet Nam. General Statistics Office. 2015. Statistical Yearbook of Vietnam. Hanoi. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fopportunities to modernize production through the adoption of technology and the movement of \nlabor into, and the use of land for, higher productivity functions. \n \n6. \nAlthough generally strong, economic growth in the NCPs has been uneven. In 2015, the \npoverty  rate  averaged  7%  nationwide  and 13%  in the  NCPs,  where  rates  averaged  5%  in the \nurban  areas  and  29%  in  the  rural  areas,  reflecting  limited  rural  integration  with  the  drivers  of \neconomic  growth.  The  population,  economy,  and  infrastructure  of  the  NCPs  face  increased \nvulnerability to climate risks, as their location is exposed to extreme weather events.3 By 2035, \nthe NCPs are predicted to have Viet Nam\u2019s highest increase in annual mean temperature at 1.7%, \nwith  annual  rainfall  increasing  by  20%,  along  with  drastic  seasonal  variation.  By  2040,  these \neffects, combined with sea levels rising by as much as 0.2 meters and storm surges increasing \nby about another 0.5 meters, will put the NCPs at high risk of seawater flooding and inundation. \n \n7. \nEconomic  development  in  the  NCPs  is  constrained  by  low  quality  and  fragmented \ninfrastructure  coverage.  The  NCPs  have  high  transport  costs  resulting  from  weak  interdistrict \nlinkages, with poor rural road conditions leading to high vehicle operating costs. Inadequate basic \ninfrastructure decreases competitiveness and business investment, and increases exposure to \nnatural disasters, resulting in livelihood vulnerabilities and high costs for repair, reconstruction, \nand adaptation. Groundwater contaminated with naturally occurring heavy metals leaves many \nNCP  communities  without  potable  water  causing  illness  and  reduced  incomes.  Inadequate \ncoastal defenses lead to dangerous flooding events and soil salinization, while insufficient docking \nfacilities increase costs for fishing and tourist enterprises. Aging and deteriorating reservoirs are \nunsafe, are vulnerable to climate change impacts, while reducing irrigation and RDWS coverage. \nWeak  asset  management  in  the  NCPs  has  led  to  uninformed  infrastructure  management \ndecisions, lessening returns on investments and reducing sustainability. \n \n8. \nThe project will help the NCPs counter development constraints through the reduction of \nphysical and economic fragmentation and manage the impact of climate change by investing in \nbasic infrastructure, including: \n \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii)  \n\n(iii)  \n\nroads  that  connect  (a)  rural  production  areas,  remote  communities,  and  tourist \nsites  to  higher  order  transport  nodes  and  economic  hubs;  and  (b)  the  eastern \nseacoast to the north\u2013south transport arterials and to the Lao PDR border gates;  \nproductive basic infrastructure that will (a) attract private business investment by \nreducing  costs  and  risks;  and  (b)  secure  inhabited,  agricultural,  industrial,  or \nenvironmentally  sensitive  areas  against  extreme  weather  events  and  climate \nchange trends; and  \neffective provincial infrastructure asset management to optimize returns and the \nsustainability of infrastructure investments. \n\n \nThe  project  aligns  with  the  government\u2019s  (i)  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  2016\u2013\n9. \n2020,  which  prioritizes  domestic  market  expansion,  promotes  exports,  and  lifts  Viet  Nam\u2019s \ncompetitiveness;4 (ii) Transport Development Strategy, which emphasizes corridor development \nand provincial and rural connectivity;5 (iii) National Target Program on new rural development with \n                                                \n3  Government of Viet Nam, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. 2016.

The project\u2019s strength reflects  ADB\u2019s value addition \nbeyond financing in helping the government to design and implement priority public investments. \nADB continues to engage in policy dialogue with the government and development partners, in \nkey sectors covered by the project, enhancing selectivity and coordination. ADB is supporting Viet \nNam\u2019s integration into the GMS and the project will develop areas linking to the GMS North\u2013South \nEconomic Corridor, creating integration among economic growth locations and impoverished rural \nareas. 9 It  will  deliver  synergies  with  current  ADB  capacity  building  initiatives  for  agricultural \ncompetitiveness, public sector management and road safety.10 ADB\u2019s Viet Nam Resident Mission \nhas considerable experience and capacity to assist the government to overcome implementation \nchallenges,  having  recently  administered  projects  in  the  NCPs  such  as  the  ADB-financed \nEmergency  Rehabilitation  of  Calamity  Damage  Project  and  the  Integrated  Rural  Development \nSector Project in the Central Provinces.11 \n \n12. \nLessons  from  ADB\u2019s  experience.  The  project  draws  on  lessons  learned  from  ADB \noperations, including the need to improve: (i) basic infrastructure and connectivity for economic \ngrowth, business competitiveness and integration of rapidly developing areas with disadvantaged \nregions; (ii) government ownership through early engagement in project design and management; \n(iii)  sustainability  by  including  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  and  climate  change \n                                                \n 6  Government  of  Viet  Nam.  2011.

The project will upgrade and construct \nabout  214  kilometers  of  district  roads,  which  will  improve  connectivity  and  transport  access  to \nmore than  900,000  beneficiaries. The  climate-resilient  roads  will  integrate  productive rural  and \nremote areas to locations driving economic growth. The road designs will include traffic-calming \nmeasures to  reduce  vehicular  velocity  at  critical sections,  such  as  near  schools  and  hospitals, \nand safety programs for vulnerable road users. \n \n15. \nOutput 2:  Productive infrastructure for business development improved. This output \nwill benefit about 340,000 people through the construction, upgrade, rehabilitation, or stabilization \nof (i) two RDWS to provide potable water to households currently dependent upon contaminated \ngroundwater;  (ii)  coastal  and  river  defenses\u2014including  dikes,  embankments,  and  canals\u2014to \nprotect lives, public and private property, and businesses from extreme weather, aggravated by \nclimate change; (iii) one river port to enhance fish processing and improve tourism logistics; and \n(iv)  a  reservoir  that  provides  irrigation  and  agricultural  support  infrastructure  to  enhance \nproduction such as the lining of canals and improving rural access and mobility.14 \n \n16. \nOutput  3:  Decentralized  public  asset  management  processes  established.  This \noutput  will  support  the  implementation  of  the  national  decentralized  public  asset  management \nprogram.15 The NCPs will procure and operate asset management systems for roads, RDWSs, \nand irrigation to minimize life cycle costs and transition to efficient O&M of provincial assets. The \nsystems will include indicators and tools to allow monitoring of annual O&M budgets and improve \nvalue-for-money decisions. \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $203.5  million  (Table  1).

The Quang Tri PMU will \nestablish a small unit to aggregate reports from all NCPs and coordinate with ADB.  \n \n26. \nProject  readiness  will  be  enhanced  by  the  (i)  preparation  of  eight  subproject  feasibility \nstudies and a screened and prioritized list of 24 potential additional subprojects;19 (ii) recruitment \nof detailed engineering design and loan implementation consultants who will sign the contracts \nupon  loan  effectiveness;20 and  (iii)  intensive  training  for  the  PMUs  for  key  operational  tasks, \nincluding establishing the project performance monitoring system. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n27. \nThe project preparation determined that the required engineering and construction skills \nis  within  the  capacity  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  private  sector  and  following  official  Viet  Nam  standards \nprepared:  (i)  feasibility  studies for  the  four  representative  subprojects  including:  (a)  three  road \nsubprojects using traffic forecasts and economic development trends for design choices; and (b) \none RDWS subproject comprising two subnetworks. The preliminary RDWS designs are based \non projected demands to 2030; and (ii) guidelines for integrating climate-resilient measures into \nthe subproject designs.21  \n \nB. \n \n28. \nThe economic internal rate of return of the three representative road subprojects ranges \nfrom 12% to 15%. The RDWS representative subproject is an extension of the Ha Tinh municipal \nwater supply network with northern and southern subnetworks. The estimated economic internal \nrate of return is 13% for the northern subnetwork and 11% for the southern subnetwork. Sensitivity \nanalysis indicates that all representative subprojects are relatively insensitive to adverse changes. \nThe  road  subprojects  will  remain  feasible  despite  reductions  in  benefit  streams  of  10%,  or \nincreases  in  capital  costs  of  10%.  The  RDWS  subproject  will  remain  feasible  when  benefit \nstreams decrease by 10%, or capital costs increase by 10%. Water costs are affordable and are \nestimated at about 1% of average household income. \n \n29. \nThe  RDWS  financial  analysis  indicates  that  the  tariff  rates  are  sufficient  to  recover \noperating costs. Over the project life, the operating expense ratios are about 88% for the northern \nand  97%  for  the  southern  networks.  However,  for  the  road  subproject,  there  is  a  risk  that  the \nNCPs may not provide adequate O&M resources as they depend heavily on transfers from the \ncentral government. To enhance the road subprojects\u2019 sustainability,  output 3 will assist in the \nmanagement of provincial infrastructure assets. Loan agreements include covenants committing \nthe government to provide adequate O&M resources for project investments. \n \n\n                                                \n19 Additional Subprojects Screening Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Loan proceeds will be used to recruit design consultants.

All \nprocurement of goods and civil works and recruitment of consultants to be financed by the ADB \nloans  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The government\u2019s \npublic  procurement  regulations,  which  are  acceptable  to  ADB,  will  be  applied  for  packages \nprocured using national competitive bidding and shopping procedures. \n \n31. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  PPCs  of  the  NPCs.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n32. \nThe NCPs have a population that is 82% rural. Poverty rates in the NCPs vary from 11% \nin Ha Tinh to 15% in Quang Tri, and can reach as high as 90% in remote ethnic communities who \nare 10% of the total population.23 Rural people in the NCPs often have limited access to markets \nand  employment.  Improving  basic  infrastructure  will  enhance  the  urban-rural  development \nlinkages, investment in industrial processing, and expansion of coastal- and nature-based tourism \nwhich are pulling labor out of rural households, diversifying income, and reducing poverty. The \ncommunication  and  participation  plan  and  the  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  provide  guidance  to \nengage  project  stakeholders  appropriately  in  project  activities  and  decisions.  The  PMUs  will \ncooperate with the communities in (i) organizing public consultations, (ii) monitoring design and \nimplementation, and (iii) creating a grievance redress mechanism. \n \n33. \nGender. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. Gender analysis reveals \nwomen have fewer opportunities to participate in public decision-making and have less access to \ninformation,  training,  and  employment.  Improved  basic  infrastructure  will  enable  women  to \nparticipate and benefit in the expanded economic opportunities and social services. The project\u2019s \nGAP promotes (i) equal project participation and benefits among women and men; (ii) reduction \nin gender inequalities and social risks; (iii) increased representation of women in decision-making \nbodies; (iv) enhanced voice and collective action for women; and (v) collection and use of sex-\ndisaggregated data.24 \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n \n34. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \ncategories  are  as  follows.25 The  NCP  PPCs  and ADB  have  agreed  on  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \ncategories  and  measures.  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  due  diligence,  GAP,  appropriate  community \nconsultations  and  implementation  resources,  are  included  in  all  representative  subproject \nfeasibility studies, which are models for all additional subproject feasibility studies.

For  all  of  the \nrepresentative  subprojects,  the  safeguard  measures  concerning  environment,  indigenous \npeoples and involuntary resettlement safeguards have been complied and publicly disclosed. \n \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  NCP  PPCs  and  ADB  have  agreed  upon  an \n35. \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework.26 The  road  works  are  limited  to  upgrades \nwithin the existing or newly established right-of-way and environmental impacts will be minor and \ntemporary. They will not infringe on protected or environmentally sensitive areas and will require \nonly simple mitigation measures such as proper management of construction camps or storage \nof  building  materials.  Each  initial  environmental  examination  for  the  four  representative \nsubprojects includes an environmental management plan with appropriate mitigation measures. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). The NCP PPCs and ADB have agreed upon a \n36. \ncombined resettlement and ethnic minority development framework, through which resettlement \nand  ethnic  minorities  development  plans  were  prepared  for  all  representative  subprojects  and \npublicly disclosed.27 The plans are supported by public consultation and information disclosure. \nThe only impacts will be minor land acquisition and compensation for roadside trees, crops, or \nsmall  structures  within  the  right-of-way  for  which  compensation,  allowances,  operation  and \nadministration,  surveys,  monitoring,  and  reporting  will  be  financed  from  the  government\u2019s \ncounterpart funds. The impacts will be monitored, evaluated, and reported semiannually to ADB \nby the PPCs. \n \n37. \nIndigenous peoples (category B). Impacts on indigenous peoples, referred to as ethnic \nminorities in Viet Nam, are overwhelmingly positive since the subprojects aim for the economic \nand social improvement of the total population. The project will not cause physical displacement \nfrom traditional or customary lands, nor will it negatively impact the identity, culture, or customary \nlivelihood  systems  of  the  ethnic  minorities.  The  resettlement  and  ethnic  minority  development \nframework  will  be  used  to  ensure  the  inclusion  of  ethnic  minorities  into  project  benefits.  The \nresettlement  and  ethnic  minorities  development  plans  include  mitigation  measures  to  address \nimpacts, institutional capacity development programs, and a grievance redress mechanism. \n \nF. \n \n38. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.28 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nRisks \nPremature asset \ndeterioration. \n\nClimate change intensifies \nfloods and droughts. \nWeak financial, \nmanagement and \nprocurement systems.  \n\nDEDs will be based upon robust estimates for traffic increases and other asset \nloading stresses.
