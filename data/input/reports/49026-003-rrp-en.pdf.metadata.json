THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed loans \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Basic Infrastructure for Inclusive Growth in the North \nCentral Provinces Sector Project. \n \n2.  The provincially managed, multisector project will promote inclusive economic growth in \nfour north central provinces (NCPs): Ha Tinh, Nghe An, Quang Binh, and Quang Tri. The NCPs \nencompass 35,296 square kilometers, had a population of 5.8 million in 2015, and have high rates \nof rural poverty. The project will benefit about 1 million people through the implementation of \nlocally  prioritized  basic  infrastructure  subprojects,  including  (i)  upgrading  district  roads;  (ii) \nimproving  productive  and  business  infrastructure  such  as  (a)  rural  domestic  water  supply \nschemes (RDWS), (b) coastal defenses and flood protection, (c) a river port, and (d) irrigation \nreservoirs; and (iii) establishing provincial public asset management systems.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Robust economic growth has been the key driver of poverty reduction in Viet Nam. Growth \nof the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) has been among the world\u2019s fastest, averaging an \nannual 6% from 2010 to 2015. While starting from a lower base, the regional GDP of the NCPs \ngrew at 15% annually in the same period. In 2015, the national GDP per capita reached $2,215, \nwhile in the NCPs it ranged from $1,210 in Nghe An to $1,933 in Ha Tinh.2 GDP growth in Ha \nTinh is attributed to investments in the construction of economic zones, seaport development, \nand the steel industry, which is now generating industrial output and employment. In Nghe An, \nagriculture modernization has increased dairy and beef output. In Quang Binh and Quang Tri, \nlarge-scale  wood  processing  for  chip  export  is  transitioning  to  value  added  production  of \nfiberboards. \n \n4.  The NCPs are located at the convergence of the north\u2013south and east-west land transport \nsystems, and are the shortest distance from the eastern seacoast to the western border with the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). NCPs benefit from access to the sea used by one-\nthird of global shipping lines, and processed with rich resources including lucrative fisheries with \nannual stocks estimated at 600,000 tons, and significant oil and gas reserves. The seacoast \nprovides tourism potential and export logistic efficiency, linking to the Red River Delta in the north \nand the Mekong Delta in the south. The NCPs have five border gates with the Lao PDR, providing \naccess deep into the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) particularly through the GMS East\u2013West \nEconomic Corridor. \n \n5.  The NCPs\u2019 location provides opportunities for investment in processing and industrial \nproduction. The seacoast enables the NCPs to develop (i) an offshore fisheries industry with an \nallowable annual catch valued at $0.2 billion, where 85% of fish processing is done by women; \n(ii) an aquaculture industry covering 28,000 hectares with about 110,000 fish farms; and (iii) a \ndiversified tourism industry employing 40,000 people and generating $0.34 billion in returns. \nTrade logistics, industrial investment, increased urbanization, and human resource development \nwill underpin structural changes in the economies of the NCPs, with flow-on benefits including \n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided the project preparatory Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic \nof Viet Nam for the Basic Infrastructure for Inclusive Growth in the Northeast Provinces Sector Project (TA 8957-\nVIE).  \n2  Government of Viet Nam. General Statistics Office. 2015. Statistical Yearbook of Vietnam. Hanoi. \n ", "2 \nopportunities to modernize production through the adoption of technology and the movement of \nlabor into, and the use of land for, higher productivity functions. \n \n6.  Although generally strong, economic growth in the NCPs has been uneven. In 2015, the \npoverty rate averaged 7% nationwide and 13% in the NCPs, where rates averaged 5% in the \nurban areas and 29% in the rural areas, reflecting limited rural integration with the drivers of \neconomic growth. The population, economy, and infrastructure of the NCPs face increased \nvulnerability to climate risks, as their location is exposed to extreme weather events.3 By 2035, \nthe NCPs are predicted to have Viet Nam\u2019s highest increase in annual mean temperature at 1.7%, \nwith annual rainfall increasing by 20%, along with drastic seasonal variation. By 2040, these \neffects, combined with sea levels rising by as much as 0.2 meters and storm surges increasing \nby about another 0.5 meters, will put the NCPs at high risk of seawater flooding and inundation. \n \n7.  Economic  development  in  the  NCPs  is  constrained  by  low  quality  and  fragmented \ninfrastructure coverage. The NCPs have high transport costs resulting from weak interdistrict \nlinkages, with poor rural road conditions leading to high vehicle operating costs. Inadequate basic \ninfrastructure decreases competitiveness and business investment, and increases exposure to \nnatural disasters, resulting in livelihood vulnerabilities and high costs for repair, reconstruction, \nand adaptation. Groundwater contaminated with naturally occurring heavy metals leaves many \nNCP communities without potable water causing illness and reduced incomes. Inadequate \ncoastal defenses lead to dangerous flooding events and soil salinization, while insufficient docking \nfacilities increase costs for fishing and tourist enterprises. Aging and deteriorating reservoirs are \nunsafe, are vulnerable to climate change impacts, while reducing irrigation and RDWS coverage. \nWeak  asset  management  in  the  NCPs  has  led  to  uninformed  infrastructure  management \ndecisions, lessening returns on investments and reducing sustainability. \n \n8.  The project will help the NCPs counter development constraints through the reduction of \nphysical and economic fragmentation and manage the impact of climate change by investing in \nbasic infrastructure, including: \n \n(i)   roads that connect (a) rural production areas, remote communities, and tourist \nsites to higher order transport nodes and economic hubs; and (b) the eastern \nseacoast to the north\u2013south transport arterials and to the Lao PDR border gates;  \n(ii)   productive basic infrastructure that will (a) attract private business investment by \nreducing costs and risks; and (b) secure inhabited, agricultural, industrial, or \nenvironmentally  sensitive  areas  against  extreme  weather  events  and climate \nchange trends; and  \n(iii)   effective provincial infrastructure asset management to optimize returns and the \nsustainability of infrastructure investments. \n \n9.  The project aligns with the government\u2019s (i) Socio-Economic Development Plan 2016\u2013\n2020, which prioritizes domestic market expansion, promotes exports, and lifts Viet Nam\u2019s \ncompetitiveness;4 (ii) Transport Development Strategy, which emphasizes corridor development \nand provincial and rural connectivity;5 (iii) National Target Program on new rural development with \n                                                \n3  Government of Viet Nam, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. 2016.

The project supports the three pillars of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) country \npartnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for Viet Nam:8 (i) promotion of job creation and competitiveness \nby improving physical connectivity, supporting commerce and employment creation, enhancing \nbusiness  environments,  and  increasing  productivity;  (ii)  inclusive  infrastructure  and  service \ndelivery  through  diversifying  economic  opportunities,  broadening  access  to  essential  social \nservices, and livelihood opportunities for rural people, with emphasis on working with provincial \ngovernments to upgrade  and maintain public assets including basic infrastructure; and (iii) \nimproving environmental sustainability and climate change response by integrating climate-\nproofing measures into infrastructure investments. \n \n11.  Value added by ADB assistance. The project\u2019s strength reflects ADB\u2019s value addition \nbeyond financing in helping the government to design and implement priority public investments. \nADB continues to engage in policy dialogue with the government and development partners, in \nkey sectors covered by the project, enhancing selectivity and coordination. ADB is supporting Viet \nNam\u2019s integration into the GMS and the project will develop areas linking to the GMS North\u2013South \nEconomic Corridor, creating integration among economic growth locations and impoverished rural \nareas.9 It will deliver synergies with current ADB capacity building initiatives for agricultural \ncompetitiveness, public sector management and road safety.10 ADB\u2019s Viet Nam Resident Mission \nhas considerable experience and capacity to assist the government to overcome implementation \nchallenges,  having  recently  administered  projects  in  the  NCPs  such  as  the  ADB-financed \nEmergency Rehabilitation of Calamity Damage Project and the Integrated Rural Development \nSector Project in the Central Provinces.11 \n \n12.  Lessons from ADB\u2019s experience. The project draws on lessons learned from ADB \noperations, including the need to improve: (i) basic infrastructure and connectivity for economic \ngrowth, business competitiveness and integration of rapidly developing areas with disadvantaged \nregions; (ii) government ownership through early engagement in project design and management; \n(iii)  sustainability  by  including  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  and  climate  change \n                                                \n 6 Government of Viet Nam. 2011.

Outputs \n \n14.  Output 1: Transport infrastructure improved. The project will upgrade and construct \nabout 214 kilometers of district roads, which will improve connectivity and transport access to \nmore than 900,000 beneficiaries. The climate-resilient roads will integrate productive rural and \nremote areas to locations driving economic growth. The road designs will include traffic-calming \nmeasures to reduce vehicular velocity at critical sections, such as near schools and hospitals, \nand safety programs for vulnerable road users. \n \n15.  Output 2:  Productive infrastructure for business development improved. This output \nwill benefit about 340,000 people through the construction, upgrade, rehabilitation, or stabilization \nof (i) two RDWS to provide potable water to households currently dependent upon contaminated \ngroundwater; (ii) coastal and river defenses\u2014including dikes, embankments, and canals\u2014to \nprotect lives, public and private property, and businesses from extreme weather, aggravated by \nclimate change; (iii) one river port to enhance fish processing and improve tourism logistics; and \n(iv)  a  reservoir  that  provides  irrigation  and  agricultural  support  infrastructure  to  enhance \nproduction such as the lining of canals and improving rural access and mobility.14 \n \n16.  Output 3: Decentralized public asset management processes established. This \noutput will support the implementation of the national decentralized public asset management \nprogram.15 The NCPs will procure and operate asset management systems for roads, RDWSs, \nand irrigation to minimize life cycle costs and transition to efficient O&M of provincial assets. The \nsystems will include indicators and tools to allow monitoring of annual O&M budgets and improve \nvalue-for-money decisions. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n17.

Each  PPC  will  chair  a  provincial  steering  committee  to  address  project-related \ncoordination, negotiations, and discussions.18 The Department of Planning and Investment in \n                                                \n17 Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Project Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \neach NCP will be the implementing agency and will establish a project management unit (PMU). \nThe PMU will be legally registered entities that can sign contracts with consultants, contractors, \nand suppliers, and will be assisted by loan implementation consultants. The Quang Tri PMU will \nestablish a small unit to aggregate reports from all NCPs and coordinate with ADB.  \n \n26.  Project readiness will be enhanced by the (i) preparation of eight subproject feasibility \nstudies and a screened and prioritized list of 24 potential additional subprojects;19 (ii) recruitment \nof detailed engineering design and loan implementation consultants who will sign the contracts \nupon loan effectiveness;20 and (iii) intensive training for the PMUs for key operational tasks, \nincluding establishing the project performance monitoring system. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n27.  The project preparation determined that the required engineering and construction skills \nis within the capacity of Viet Nam\u2019s private sector and following official Viet Nam standards \nprepared: (i) feasibility studies for the four representative subprojects including: (a) three road \nsubprojects using traffic forecasts and economic development trends for design choices; and (b) \none RDWS subproject comprising two subnetworks. The preliminary RDWS designs are based \non projected demands to 2030; and (ii) guidelines for integrating climate-resilient measures into \nthe subproject designs.21  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n28.  The economic internal rate of return of the three representative road subprojects ranges \nfrom 12% to 15%. The RDWS representative subproject is an extension of the Ha Tinh municipal \nwater supply network with northern and southern subnetworks. The estimated economic internal \nrate of return is 13% for the northern subnetwork and 11% for the southern subnetwork. Sensitivity \nanalysis indicates that all representative subprojects are relatively insensitive to adverse changes. \nThe road subprojects will remain feasible despite reductions in benefit streams of 10%, or \nincreases in capital costs of 10%. The RDWS subproject will remain feasible when benefit \nstreams decrease by 10%, or capital costs increase by 10%. Water costs are affordable and are \nestimated at about 1% of average household income. \n \n29.  The RDWS financial analysis indicates that the tariff rates are sufficient to recover \noperating costs. Over the project life, the operating expense ratios are about 88% for the northern \nand 97% for the southern networks. However, for the road subproject, there is a risk that the \nNCPs may not provide adequate O&M resources as they depend heavily on transfers from the \ncentral government. To enhance the road subprojects\u2019 sustainability, output 3 will assist in the \nmanagement of provincial infrastructure assets. Loan agreements include covenants committing \nthe government to provide adequate O&M resources for project investments. \n \n                                                \n19 Additional Subprojects Screening Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Loan proceeds will be used to recruit design consultants.

The financial management risk is high based on the detailed assessment of the executing \nand implementing agencies because of capacity and systems constraints in their accounting, \nstaffing, auditing, and control systems.22 Extensive mitigation measures have been captured in a \nfinancial management action plan, including providing training, staffing, accounting systems, and \nexternal audit arrangements; and are included as a loan covenant in the loan agreement. All \nprocurement of goods and civil works and recruitment of consultants to be financed by the ADB \nloans will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The government\u2019s \npublic procurement regulations, which are acceptable to ADB, will be applied for packages \nprocured using national competitive bidding and shopping procedures. \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  PPCs  of  the  NPCs.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n32.  The NCPs have a population that is 82% rural. Poverty rates in the NCPs vary from 11% \nin Ha Tinh to 15% in Quang Tri, and can reach as high as 90% in remote ethnic communities who \nare 10% of the total population.23 Rural people in the NCPs often have limited access to markets \nand  employment.  Improving  basic  infrastructure  will  enhance  the  urban-rural  development \nlinkages, investment in industrial processing, and expansion of coastal- and nature-based tourism \nwhich are pulling labor out of rural households, diversifying income, and reducing poverty. The \ncommunication and participation plan and the gender action plan (GAP) provide guidance to \nengage project stakeholders appropriately in project activities and decisions. The PMUs will \ncooperate with the communities in (i) organizing public consultations, (ii) monitoring design and \nimplementation, and (iii) creating a grievance redress mechanism. \n \n33.  Gender. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. Gender analysis reveals \nwomen have fewer opportunities to participate in public decision-making and have less access to \ninformation,  training,  and  employment.  Improved  basic  infrastructure  will  enable  women  to \nparticipate and benefit in the expanded economic opportunities and social services. The project\u2019s \nGAP promotes (i) equal project participation and benefits among women and men; (ii) reduction \nin gender inequalities and social risks; (iii) increased representation of women in decision-making \nbodies; (iv) enhanced voice and collective action for women; and (v) collection and use of sex-\ndisaggregated data.24 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n34.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.25 The NCP PPCs and ADB have agreed on the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories  and  measures.  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  due  diligence,  GAP,  appropriate  community \nconsultations  and  implementation  resources,  are  included  in  all  representative  subproject \nfeasibility studies, which are models for all additional subproject feasibility studies.

Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "9 \nfinance  subprojects  that  are  classified  category  B  or  C  for  all  safeguards.  For  all  of  the \nrepresentative  subprojects,  the  safeguard  measures  concerning  environment,  indigenous \npeoples and involuntary resettlement safeguards have been complied and publicly disclosed. \n \n35.  Environment  (category  B).  The  NCP  PPCs  and  ADB  have  agreed  upon  an \nenvironmental assessment and review framework.26 The road works are limited to upgrades \nwithin the existing or newly established right-of-way and environmental impacts will be minor and \ntemporary. They will not infringe on protected or environmentally sensitive areas and will require \nonly simple mitigation measures such as proper management of construction camps or storage \nof  building  materials.  Each  initial  environmental  examination  for  the  four  representative \nsubprojects includes an environmental management plan with appropriate mitigation measures. \n \n36.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The NCP PPCs and ADB have agreed upon a \ncombined resettlement and ethnic minority development framework, through which resettlement \nand ethnic minorities development plans were prepared for all representative subprojects and \npublicly disclosed.27 The plans are supported by public consultation and information disclosure. \nThe only impacts will be minor land acquisition and compensation for roadside trees, crops, or \nsmall structures within the right-of-way for which compensation, allowances, operation and \nadministration,  surveys,  monitoring,  and  reporting  will  be  financed  from  the  government\u2019s \ncounterpart funds. The impacts will be monitored, evaluated, and reported semiannually to ADB \nby the PPCs. \n \n37.  Indigenous peoples (category B). Impacts on indigenous peoples, referred to as ethnic \nminorities in Viet Nam, are overwhelmingly positive since the subprojects aim for the economic \nand social improvement of the total population. The project will not cause physical displacement \nfrom traditional or customary lands, nor will it negatively impact the identity, culture, or customary \nlivelihood systems of the ethnic minorities. The resettlement and ethnic minority development \nframework will be used to ensure the inclusion of ethnic minorities into project benefits. The \nresettlement and ethnic minorities development plans include mitigation measures to address \nimpacts, institutional capacity development programs, and a grievance redress mechanism. \n \nF.
