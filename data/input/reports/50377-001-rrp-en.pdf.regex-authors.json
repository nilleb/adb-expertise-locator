THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased grant to Tuvalu for the Improved Fiscal and Infrastructure Management Program.1 \n \n2.  The program aims to strengthen Tuvalu\u2019s fiscal sustainability by supporting priority policy \nactions under the government\u2019s rolling multiyear policy reform matrix (PRM).2 Since 2012, the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) has been closely engaged with the government and development \npartners in supporting the policy reforms under the multiyear matrix through technical assistance \n(TA) and two earlier ADB stand-alone operations.3 This single-tranche stand-alone grant supports \nreforms to improve the management of public finance and national infrastructure, building on past \nengagement by ADB and other development partners.4 In coordination with other development \npartners, ADB will continue to engage in the PRM process through policy dialogue, budget \nsupport, and TA. The program is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 priorities of strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity; improving the access, quality, and reliability of services; \nand building climate resilience.5 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Tuvalu is a fragile microstate comprising nine low-lying atolls covering a land area of 26 \nsquare kilometers. More than half the population of 11,100 (2017) resides in Funafuti\u2014an area \nof only 2.8 square kilometers. Tuvalu\u2019s remoteness from major markets, dependence on imports, \nand vulnerability to external shocks and climate change pose significant risks to socioeconomic \ndevelopment. Tuvalu has a narrow economic base, and domestic revenues are highly reliant on \nvolatile external revenue sources, including fishing license fees and \u201c.tv\u201d internet domain license \nfees. External grants from development partners are a critical source of budget financing. The \npublic sector accounts for two-thirds of gross domestic product (GDP) and provides most of the \nformal sector employment. The private sector is small and struggles to grow because of the lack \nof economies of scale and high transaction costs. Given the dominance of the public sector, sound \nfinancial management is critical to ensure the effective delivery of public services and investments \nthat underpin economic growth.  \n \n4.  Recent macroeconomic performance.6 Growth in Tuvalu accelerated to 4.9% per \nannum during 2015\u20132018 from 0.8% per annum during 2011\u20132014, driven by higher government \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The program is in ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business \nPlan: 11 Small Pacific Island Countries, 2019\u20132021. Manila. It aligns with ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020. \nManila. The concept paper for the program was circulated to the ADB Board of Directors on 3 September 2019. \n2  The Policy Matrix, containing a prioritized list of reforms implemented between July 2018 and June 2019, is in \nAppendix 4. \n3  ADB. 2012.

Fishing license revenues \nincreased by 84.8% in 2018 with the receipt of a one-off payment from a subregional pooling \nscheme. Tuvalu recorded fiscal surpluses of 13.5% of GDP in 2017 and 33.9% of GDP in 2018. \nHigher public sector wages and infrastructure projects are expected to accelerate inflation for both \n2019 and 2020. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated external public debt at 28.0% \nof GDP in 2018, and continues to classify Tuvalu as being at high risk of debt distress primarily \nbecause of its vulnerability to external shocks.7 \n \n5.  The Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) was created in 1987 to help smooth revenue volatility.8 \nDistributions are made from the TTF to its associated buffer fund\u2014the Consolidated Investment \nFund (CIF)\u2014when the TTF\u2019s balance exceeds its maintained value. Under the current fiscal \npolicy, a minimum balance of 16% from the TTF maintained value is required to be maintained in \nthe CIF to provide a buffer for budget expenditure. In 2015, the government established the Tuvalu \nSurvival Fund for disaster relief and rehabilitation. As of 30 March 2019, the market value of TTF \ninvestments was $122.3 million, while the maintained value was $123.7\u202fmillion. As of 30 March \n2019, the CIF balance was $22.8 million (18% of the TTF maintained value), and the Tuvalu \nSurvival Fund was $6.2 million. The government also holds contingent disaster financing from \nADB, approved in 2017 and valued at $3.0 million.9 These funds provide the government with \nflexible buffers to address short-term financing gaps and the scaling up of reserve assets\u2014\nincreasing the country\u2019s resilience to shocks. \n \n6.  Macroeconomic and fiscal management risks. Growth is projected to remain strong, \nabove 4.0% from 2019 to 2021, driven by higher government spending on large infrastructure \nprojects and housing for Tuvalu\u2019s hosting of major events such as the Pacific Islands Forum \nLeaders Meeting held in August 2019. Despite the positive medium-term outlook, Tuvalu is \nexposed  to  substantial  downside  risks  (particularly  the  link  between  the  global  economic \nenvironment  and  remittances,  TTF  returns,  and  volatile  fisheries  receipts)  that  challenge \ngovernment\u2019s fiscal management and macroeconomic sustainability. Fishing license revenues in \n2019 are projected to decrease to $23.5 million\u2014about the same level as in 2016 and about \n65.7% lower than revenue receipts in 2018. This, plus higher infrastructure spending for the \nregional summit meeting, is expected to result in a budget deficit for 2019.10 Excluding grants, the \ndomestic fiscal deficit in 2019 is estimated to be $22.5 million (47.9% of GDP) (Table 1).11 \n \n7.  The Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI) estimates \nthat, on average, Tuvalu should expect annualized disaster-related losses and damages of 2% of \nGDP.12 While the government is implementing activities to improve resilience to shocks, the costs \nassociated with physical adaptation, disaster risk reduction, and disaster response are large \n                                                \n7  IMF.

Ongoing  public  financial  management  weaknesses.  Tuvalu\u2019s  public  financial \nmanagement (PFM) has improved through the implementation of the PFM Roadmap, 2015\u20132018, \nwhich has helped improve functions of the Treasury Department to better account for funds and \nsupport public spending.14 However, there are still areas to improve in fiscal management, \nincluding  complying  with  public  procurement  regulations  and  accounting  procedures,  and \nmanaging infrastructure investments. Hence, the government updated the PFM Roadmap, 2018\u2013\n2021 to guide the efforts of the government and development partners to address the remaining \nweaknesses in fiscal management and enhance the coordination and implementation of PFM \nreforms. Further, the limitation of the fiscal management framework concerns the credibility of the \naccounting and reporting system partly because of discrepancies associated with using both cash \naccounting and partial accrual accounting. The government has also identified public procurement \nas a priority area of PFM following initial reforms introduced in 2012.15 \n \n9.  Challenges to infrastructure management. Infrastructure development is an important \ncatalyst for economic growth but the benefits depend on how well it is managed (i.e., whether it \nresults in quality and stable public service delivery). The government has carried out key reforms \nto improve public investment management. The reforms involve improving the predictability and \nplanning of public investment by adopting the Tuvalu Infrastructure Strategy and Investment \nStrategy, 2016\u20132025.16 This broader plan is supported by the Building Act and asset management \nframework  that  help  the  government  operationalize  the  Tuvalu  Infrastructure  Strategy  and \n                                                \n13 Tuvalu\u2019s Climate Change Policy 2012\u20132021 guides interventions for responding to climate change impacts and \nrelated disaster risks and is linked to Tuvalu\u2019s National Strategic Action Plan for Climate Change and Disaster Risk \nManagement. \n14 Government of Tuvalu. 2015.

Tuvalu Infrastructure Strategy and Investment Plan, 2016\u20132025. Funafuti. \n ", "4 \nInvestment Strategy and links to budgeting and implementation. The government, with support \nfrom ADB and IMF\u2019s Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre, is working on a multiyear \ninfrastructure budget for 2020, which will allow rollover funds for infrastructure development and \nincrease  the  efficiency  of  public  infrastructure  management.  This  will  prevent  having  to \nappropriate budget every year for major infrastructure projects and facilitate the planning and \nmanagement  of  infrastructure  projects  and  maintenance  works.  However,  infrastructure \ndevelopment and management in Tuvalu remains challenging because of a lack of economies of \nscale, high transport costs, a harsh climate, and limited skills and technical capacity. Physical \npublic investments are often not managed and maintained properly, eventually posing fiscal risks, \nimpacting the quality of public service delivery, and compromising public health and safety. The \nharsh climate also causes physical infrastructure assets to corrode and age quickly. An outdated \nbuilding code and lack of enabling legislation have also hindered the establishment of systems \nfor  regulatory  implementation  and  the  designation  of  public  and  private  responsibilities  for \nresilience in Tuvalu\u2019s built environment.17 As the scale, frequency, and severity of natural hazards \ncontinue to rise, Tuvalu will experience losses in the built environment that will disrupt public \nservices and financial and economic inefficiencies of the asset, and threaten human lives. \n \n10.  ADB engagement. ADB has a long history of providing budget support and TA in \npartnership  with  development  partners  to  help  implement  the  government\u2019s  public  sector \nmanagement reform priorities.18 In 2012, the government embarked on a comprehensive reform \nprogram, resulting in the adoption of the PRM containing time-bound reform actions, each one \nsupported by development partners according to their areas of comparative advantage (footnote \n4). ADB\u2019s policy-based grants in 2012 and 2015, totaling $4.3 million, supported critical reform \nactions, including (i) establishing fiscal ratios to enable the government to better monitor its fiscal \nperformance;19 (ii) establishing revenue and expenditure review committees in 2012 to identify \nnew sources of revenue and advise the cabinet on strategies to control costs; (iii) strengthening \npublic procurement through the development of the 2012 National Procurement Policy, the Public \nProcurement Act 2013, and the Public Procurement Regulations 2014 and establishing the \nCentral  Procurement  Unit  (CPU)  in  2015;20 (iv)  strengthening  the  accounting  and  auditing \npractices of public enterprises to improve their transparency and accountability and encouraging \ngreater private sector participation;21 and (v) changing the financial instructions under the Public \nFinance Act in 2015 to transform the CIF into a fiscal stabilization fund and to better insulate the \nbudget and the economy from external shocks.22 These reforms, together with those supported \nby other development partners, demonstrate long-term engagement based on  the PRM to \nimprove  public  sector  management  and  service  delivery.  The  sequenced  provision  of \n                                                \n17 A draft building code was first published in Tuvalu in 1990 as part of the Pacific Buildings Standards Project led by \nthe Government of Australia. \n18 ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to Tuvalu for \nthe Improved Public Financial Management Program. Manila; and two stand-alone operations approved in 2012 and \n2015 (footnote 3). \n19 The seven fiscal ratios are (i) tax revenue to GDP target of 20%, (ii) recurrent expenditure to GDP target of 60%, (iii) \nwages and salaries to domestic revenue target of 55%, (iv) Tuvalu overseas medical treatment scheme to domestic \nrevenue target of 6%, (v) Tuvalu overseas scholarship scheme to domestic revenue target of 5%, (vi) primary balance \nto GDP target of 11%, and (vii) net present value of public debt to GDP target of 30%. \n20 CPU oversees procurement and developed standard bidding documents. The publication of the CPU annual report \nand the development of a centralized procurement website have also helped strengthen public procurement \ngovernance. \n21 Examples include the concession sale of the government-owned hotel to the Tuvalu National Provident Fund. \n22 Changes to existing accumulation and withdrawal rules have helped regulate the use of the CIF and ensure its \nreplenishment, avoiding ad hoc fiscal tightening and the need to search for new, economically harmful revenue \nsources during economic downturns. The target CIF savings balance will be at least 16% of the maintained value of \nthe TTF and regulated through a CIF contributions and savings plan. \n \n ", "5 \ndevelopment partner grants also helps the government deliver their policy priorities, such as \neducation,  health,  basic  services  in  the  outer  islands,  and  climate  change  resilience. \nComplementary ADB and development partner TA has helped support the government\u2019s efforts \non these reforms.23 \n \n11.  Lessons learned. The design and modality of the program reflects several lessons from \nprevious budget support operations in Tuvalu and the Pacific and the 2015 evaluation of the PRM \nfinanced by the Government of Australia. Major lessons include (i) budget support can achieve \nresults if there is strong government ownership; (ii) close coordination with development partners \nis critical for advancing reforms in sectors where ADB has limited engagement; (iii) TA support, \ncoordinated across development partners and provided parallel to budget support programs, can \nhelp push the reform agenda; (iv) flexibility helps ensure that policy actions remain relevant and \nup-to-date on the latest evidence and conditions; (v) limiting reforms to a few substantive actions \nand sequencing implementation prevents overloading the national capacity; (vi) institutionalizing \njoint  government\u2013development  partner  coordination  mechanisms  reduces  the  demands  on \nlimited government capacity; and (vii) deep institutional and structural change requires time to \nbecome established.24 ADB\u2019s prior policy-based grants have been single-tranche, stand-alone \noperations, with continuity provided through TA and policy dialogue coordinated through the PRM \nprocess. Since the approach has led to good results (para. 4), ADB will continue to use it for the \nprogram. \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n12.  Government  development  strategy.  In  its  eighth  national  development  plan\u2013\u2013the \nNational Strategy for Sustainable Development, 2016\u20132020\u2013\u2013Tuvalu foresees a more protected, \nsecure, and prosperous country; healthier people who are more engaged in national, regional, \nand international forums; and a government that encourages input from the community to improve \nproject development so development efforts are sustained and adopted by the community. \nClimate change cuts across all 12 priority areas of the national development plan as sea level rise \nposes  the  most  significant  threat  to  Tuvalu\u2019s  survival.25 With  support  of  Tuvalu\u2019s  political \nleadership, the broad-based ownership of the policy reform program is strong and institutionalized \nthrough government-led coordination with development partners.26 \n \n13.  Partner coordination. Since 2012, ADB, the Governments of Australia and New Zealand, \nthe European Union, and the World Bank have been closely coordinating their budget support \nand TA operations through joint development and monitoring of the PRM. From 2012 to 2018, \nthis partnership has helped support government reforms focused on PFM, fiscal policy, public \nadministration, public enterprise performance and rationalization, health, and education (footnote \n4). Since there has been progress in these areas, ADB and other development partners have \nprovided $27.4 million in general budget support. An estimated $14.6 million in combined budget \n                                                \n23 ADB. 2008.

Tuvalu\u2019s PFM has improved \nthrough the government\u2019s strong commitment to implementing the PFM Roadmap, \n2015\u20132018, which has led to greater macroeconomic stability and improved the \nquality  of  public  expenditures. 30  The  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial \nAccountability (PEFA) self-assessment and the Assessment of National Systems \n(ANS) conducted by the Government of Australia in 2018 highlight procurement \nand treasury functions as remaining weaknesses in fiscal management posing \nfiduciary  risks  and  implementation  delays  of  PFM  reforms.  Based  on  these \nassessments, the cabinet approved a PFM Reform Strategy, 2019\u20132021 to target \nthese weaknesses as a prior action. The road map prioritizes four main areas for \nimprovement, and implementation will be tracked and reflected in future PEFA \nassessments. The priorities include (a) improve the medium-term fiscal framework \nand  credibility  of  the  budget,  (b)  review  financial  legislation  and  subsidiary \nguidelines,  (c)  improve  the  capability  and  use  of  the  government  financial \nmanagement and information system, and (d) build PFM capacity and service \ndelivery. \n(ii)  Public financial reporting strategy. The government\u2019s fiscal vulnerabilities are \nassociated with the credibility of the government financial accounting system, \npartly because of discrepancies associated with using both cash accounting and \npartial accrual accounting. Although the government adopted accrual accounting \nin 2012, the existing accounting practice is still on cash and partial accrual basis. \nThere is a mismatch in the reporting of accounts versus the auditing of financial \nstatements by the auditor general\u2019s office, creating inefficiencies in the use of staff \ntime and in reporting the government\u2019s finances. As a prior action, the cabinet \nendorsed  a  strategy  towards  a  full  accrual  accounting  system.  The  strategy \nidentifies weaknesses in existing accounting practices and provides guidelines for \neach implementation phase of the transition from cash and partial accrual to full \naccrual accounting by 2024. \n                                                \n27 International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 The six policy actions in the PRM (Appendix 4) supported by ADB are 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, and 2.2. Development \npartners are supporting a combination of reform actions under the jointly agreed PRM, according to their areas of \nexpertise, operational priorities, and alignment with their bilateral support programs in Tuvalu.  \n29  ADB. 2017. Technical Assistance to Tuvalu for Supporting Reforms to Strengthen Fiscal Resilience and Improve \nPublic Service Delivery. Manila. This TA helped government implement public procurement and building code \nreforms supported by the program.  \n30 Government of Tuvalu. 2015. Public Financial Management Roadmap, 2015\u20132018. Funafuti. The reforms draw from \nthe Government of Tuvalu\u2019s 2015 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability self-assessment. \n ", "7 \n(iii)  Public finance legislation. The Public Finance Act 2008 does not specify the \naccounting method to be used for public sector financial reporting. To ensure the \nconsistency of financial reporting, budget planning, and public finance in general, \nlegislation needs to be amended to ensure the government complies with Tuvalu\u2019s \nGenerally Accepted Accounting Practices (adopted in 2012), which are based on \nan accrual financial management system and align with the International Public \nSector Accounting Standards and the International Financial Reporting Standards. \nAs  a  prior  action,  the  Parliament  of  Tuvalu  approved  the  Public  Finance \n(Amendment) Act in April 2019 to ensure national accounts are prepared in a \nconsistent format and based on an accrual financial management system. This \nprior action is one of the requirements identified in the public financial reporting \nstrategy that will guide the government towards a full accrual accounting practice \nby 2024. \n(iv)  Public  procurement.  Public  procurement  is  still  recognized  as  an  area  of \nsignificant  weakness  in  PFM,  particularly  with  regard  to  compliance  and \nenforceability. The prior actions build on public procurement reforms implemented \nby the government since 2012. As prior actions, the cabinet endorsed the public \nprocurement  manual  and  associated  guidelines.  The  manual  will  guide \ngovernment  staff  through  the  public  procurement  process,  the  procurement \ncomplaints  and  appeals  procedure,  and  the  procurement  suspension  and \ndebarment procedure. The improved public procurement system will promote \npublic confidence in the integrity and fairness of procurement proceedings. It will \nalso help ensure better value for money and higher-quality goods and services \ndelivered by sound suppliers. These administrative processes do not substitute for \nthe legal process, which the Government of Tuvalu may pursue for suspension \nand debarment. \n \n16.  Reform area 2: institutional and legal frameworks for infrastructure management \nimproved. Policy actions under this reform area focus on strengthening Tuvalu\u2019s institutional and \nlegal framework to better construct, manage, and maintain public and private physical assets to \nbetter equip government to manage infrastructure investments that will improve service delivery. \nPrior  to  this  reform,  there  was  no  framework  to  manage  public  capital  investments.  The \ngovernment also had limited awareness about the quality of its assets to inform investment \ndecisions and to determine operational and maintenance costs. The strengthened framework will \nlimit associated fiscal risks because of poor capital budget planning and improve the quality of \npublic service delivery. These policy actions will also help mitigate the risks of direct damage to \ninfrastructure, including critical public facilities and residential buildings, and contain budgetary \nburdens for disaster recovery. \n(i)  Tuvalu Asset Management Framework. The construction and maintenance of \ninfrastructure assets is challenging and costly in Tuvalu because of a lack of \neconomies of scale, high transport costs, and a harsh climate.31 As a prior action, \nthe cabinet endorsed the Tuvalu Asset Management Framework (TAMF). The \nframework  applies  to  all  physical  infrastructure  (buildings,  roads,  water  and \nsanitation, coastal protection, and transport infrastructure) with an individual asset \nvalue  greater  than  $10,000,  owned  by  the  national  government,  local island \ncouncils, and major public sector enterprises. The framework helps identify the \n                                                \n31 The TAMF is linked to the Tuvalu Infrastructure Strategy and Investment Plan, 2016\u20132025. As the custodian of all \nmajor infrastructure assets, the Ministry of Public Utilities and Infrastructure Implementation will commence the \nimplementation  of  the  TAMF.  Incremental  implementation  supported  by  TA  from  development  partners  is \nrecommended for this framework because of the varying capacities of different ministries. \n ", "8 \nmaintenance requirements and replacement needs of public sector infrastructure \nassets  and  ensure  that  they  deliver  their  intended  functions  with  economic \nefficiency throughout their service life. The framework also aims to improve asset \nperformance and resilience and extend assets\u2019 service life by (a) building sufficient \nresilience in infrastructure design to reduce vulnerability to natural hazards and \nclimate change impacts; (b) monitoring asset condition through simple, practical, \nand low-cost techniques and taking prompt corrective action when needed; (c) \nreplacing the current reactive maintenance strategy with a planned preventative \nmaintenance  program;  and  (d)  maintaining  adequate  records  to  allow  the \nperformance of assets to be benchmarked, and creating institutional memory. \n(ii)  Building legislation and code. Although the building code was developed in 1990, \nthere was no enabling legal framework passed for its implementation. This lack of \nenabling legislation has hindered the establishment of systems for regulatory \nimplementation  and  the  designation  of  public  and  private  responsibilities  for \nresilience in Tuvalu\u2019s built environment. The building code of 1990 also did not \nconsider disaster risk reduction and climate change impacts. As a prior action, the \nParliament of Tuvalu approved the Building Act in July 2019, and the minister for \npublic utilities and infrastructure endorsed the draft building code, which will be \nfinalized  when  public  consultations  are  completed.  The  building  code  and \nassociated legislation will ensure construction adheres to acceptable standards of \nstructural sufficiency, safety, climate resilience, and amenities for the public. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n17.  The program will contribute to the objectives of the National Strategy for Sustainable \nDevelopment, 2016\u20132020 (footnote 25) of sound macroeconomic management and efficient, \nhigh-quality, and resilient infrastructure and support services. The reform aims to improve the \nmanagement of public finances and national infrastructure. The program will support efforts in two \nreform areas. Under reform area 1, Tuvalu\u2019s PFM will be improved through the PFM Reform \nStrategy 2019\u20132021, the transition towards full accrual accounting in compliance with Tuvalu\u2019s \nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles, and strengthened public procurement by putting in \nplace mechanisms for redress and noncompliance. Under reform area 2, improvements to \nbuilding standards and management of national infrastructure will help enhance resilience to \ndisasters and ensure service delivery with economic efficiency throughout the service life of the \ninfrastructure. These reforms help improve overall efficiency in public resource allocation and \nutilization. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n18.  The government estimates a domestic financing gap of $22.5 million in 2019, which will \nbe financed by savings, drawdown from the CIF, and development partner grants. In 2019, budget \nsupport grants to Tuvalu are estimated to total $21.9 million, of which $14.6 million (64.0% of the \n2019 projected domestic fiscal deficit) will be through the PRM budget support program. Of this, \nthe  government  has  requested  a  policy-based  grant  of  $4.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Asian \nDevelopment Fund allocation for Tuvalu. PRM budget support grants also include $1.5 million \nfrom the European Union, $1.0 million from the Government of Australia, $0.6 million from the \nGovernment of New Zealand, and $7.5 million from the World Bank.32 The grant proceeds will \nalso support the government to deliver their national policy priorities.33 \n                                                \n32 These are parallel collaborative partner financing not administered by ADB. \n33 The Development Policy Letter (Appendix 3) highlights the Government\u2019s vision, policy platform, and priorities. \n ", "9 \n \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MFED) will be the executing agency \nfor the program. Through the existing institutional structure for aid management in Tuvalu, it will \noversee  the  implementation  of  agreed  policy  actions  and  be  responsible  for  program \nadministration, disbursements, and the maintenance of all records. The MFED and the Ministry \nof Public Utilities and Infrastructure will be the implementing agencies for the program. The \nproceeds  of  the  policy-based  grant  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n20.  Governance. Promoting good governance is a key national priority. The government is \ncommitted to implementing the PFM Reform Roadmap 2019\u20132021 to close the gaps identified \nthrough the 2015 PEFA and the 2018 ANS. Despite capacity limitations, the assessments indicate \nthat, compared with international best practice, Tuvalu\u2019s PFM system operates mostly at average \nlevels. The government has the ability to implement its budget, but there are weaknesses in \nprocurement, accounting, financial reporting, and auditing. Reform area 1, complemented by \ndevelopment partner TA, addresses some of these weaknesses.34 The joint policy dialogue with \ndevelopment partners on reform priorities will continue to be key in maintaining the government\u2019s \nreform momentum. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with MFED and the government. \n \n21.  Poverty and social. The policy actions supported under reform area 1 are likely to have \npositive impacts on poverty reduction. Reforms in financial management practices lead to greater \nmacroeconomic stability and improved quality of public expenditure. Successful implementation \nof these reforms would provide a foundation for improved performance in government service \ndelivery, including in sectors (e.g., health and education) that are vital for improving the lives of \nthe poor and vulnerable. Reforms on procurement implementation would also increase efficiency \nand transparency of government expenditures. The policy actions supported under reform area 2 \nwill have a positive impact on the resilience of the poor and vulnerable to climate and disaster-\nrelated shocks. Improving the climate and disaster resilience of public assets (through the asset \nmanagement framework) and private assets (through the building code) can protect the poor from \ndirect losses and disruptions to public services. The policy actions would have a substantial \npositive impact on the well-being of all citizens but particularly on the poor and vulnerable, who \nare more reliant on public services and more exposed to disaster risks because of a lack of formal \nsafety nets. \n \n22.  Safeguards.  Following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  program  is \nclassified category C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \nProgram activities will be confined to policy and institutional reforms. The prior policy actions have \nbeen assessed and are not expected to result in or lead to involuntary resettlement or negatively \naffect indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \n23.  Gender.  The  program  is  classified  no  gender  elements.  Although  the  improved \nmanagement of public finances and national infrastructure will benefit all, the program contains \n                                                \n34 Long-term advisors, financed through the Government of Australia\u2019s Pacific Technical Assistance Mechanism, \nsupplement human resources in Tuvalu\u2019s Department of Budget and Planning, Treasury, and Tax and Audit Offices. \n ", "10 \nno proactive gender design features. Program preparation discussions with the government and \ndevelopment partners identified relevant gender issues, in particular the potential for gender-\nresponsive budgeting and procurement, and gender actions related to the implementation of the \nBuilding Act and draft building code.35 However, the government\u2019s readiness to address these \nareas will need further discussions with the government and development partners and TA will be \nneeded to build capacity.  ADB will explore including appropriate actions in its subsequent \nprograms. \n \n24.  Risks. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.36 Development partners assess that \nPFM systems can support mostly reliable services for budget support. Policy reforms and TA \nsupport address the remaining fiduciary risks. The program\u2019s integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nThe government cannot implement  Reforms are prioritized and sequenced to avoid overburdening the small \npolicy reform actions because it  public administration and decision makers.

The government and the MFED have assured ADB that the implementation of the program \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the grant agreement. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nprogram, which are set forth in the grant agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n26.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based grant would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \ngrant  not  exceeding  $4,000,000  to  Tuvalu,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian \nDevelopment Fund) for the Improved Fiscal and Infrastructure Management Program, on terms \nand  conditions  that  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  grant \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n7 October 2019 \n                                                \n35 These are aligned with Tuvalu\u2019s National Gender Policy (2016) and the National Disability Policy (2018). \n36 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objectives \nPrudent management of the macroeconomic status of the economy (Tuvalu National Strategy for Sustainable \nDevelopment, 2016\u20132020)a \nEfficient, high-quality infrastructure, and support services provided (Tuvalu National Strategy for Sustainable \nDevelopment, 2016\u20132020)a \n    Data Sources and   \n  Performance Indicators with  Reporting   \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nEffect of the Reform  By 2021:    Change in \n      government \nImproved management of  a.
