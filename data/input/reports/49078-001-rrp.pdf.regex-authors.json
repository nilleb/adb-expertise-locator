THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Armenia for the Seismic Safety Improvement Program.1 The report also describes proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  Seismic  Safety  Improvement  Program,  and  if  the  Board \napproves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under the  authority  delegated to me  by  the  Board, \napprove the TA. \n \n2.  The program will support the implementation of the National Strategy for Disaster Risk \nReduction2 during 2015\u20132020 by (i) improving school seismic safety to reduce casualties and \ndamage in schools during earthquakes, and (ii) enabling better use of school buildings as \nshelters for the general public and as focal points for emergency response after earthquakes.3 \nThe program reflects the key focus areas advocated by the National Strategy for Disaster Risk \nReduction, and is in line with the four priorities identified in the Sendai Framework for Disaster \nRisk Reduction, 2015\u20132030.4 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n3.  Armenia is located in one of the most seismically active regions in the world. It is ranked \nfirst in the world for vulnerability to earthquakes.5 The Spitak earthquake in 1988, measuring 6.9 \non the Richter scale, killed 25,000 people, including 6,000 school children, and left 517,000 \npeople homeless. More than 40% of the country\u2019s manufacturing capacity was destroyed. The \nestimated direct economic loss from the Spitak earthquake was $15 billion\u2013$20 billion. Since \nthe Spitak earthquake, the country has experienced five earthquakes registering 4.5\u20137.0 on the \nRichter scale.6 \n \n4.  Since  the  Spitak  earthquake,  the  government  has  reorganized  its  emergency \nmanagement system, including creating the Ministry of Emergency Situations and National \nSurvey  for  Seismic  Protection  and  appointing  a  cabinet  minister  responsible  for  disaster \nresponse. The government has passed significant legislation and decisions to improve seismic \nrisk reduction and emergency management.7 In addition, design and construction codes and \nstandards were revised and updated to reflect the real seismic hazard and to more correctly \ndetermine the seismic loads acting on buildings and structures. \n \n5.  The  National  Strategy  for  Disaster  Risk  Reduction,  approved  in  2012,  defines  the \ndevelopment of an efficient system for disaster risk reduction as one of the most important \nfactors for sustainable development of the country. The strategy aims to improve the country\u2019s \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Armenia. 2012.

It identifies seismic risk as a primary disaster risk for the country. \n \n6.  Most of the public buildings constructed during the Soviet time need strengthening or \nreconstruction to meet the seismic safety standard. The government has prioritized school \nbuildings  for  seismic  strengthening  or  reconstruction,  as  the  school  buildings  will  not  only \nprevent loss of life of school children but will also be used as emergency shelters for temporary \nhospitals and dormitories after a disaster. Armenia has about 1,400 schools, about 1,000 of \nwhich need strengthening and reconstruction at an estimated cost of $1.2 billion. There are \nvarious investment programs prepared by the government and development partners which \nfocus on different types of schools (primary, secondary, or high schools) or different locations \n(Yerevan or other regions) with different prioritization criteria. With Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) support, the government has consolidated these investment programs into one priority \nSchool Strengthening and Renovation Program, using the prioritization criteria developed with \nsupport of the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund.8 \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n \n7.  The program will support the implementation of the National Strategy for Disaster Risk \nReduction by (i) improving school seismic safety to reduce casualties and damage in schools \nduring earthquakes, and (ii) enabling better use of school buildings as shelters for the general \npublic and as focal points for emergency response after earthquakes. The program reflects the \nkey focus areas advocated by the National Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction and is in line \nwith the four priorities in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, 2015\u20132030: (i) \nunderstanding disaster risk; (ii) strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk; \n(iii) investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience; and (iv) enhancing disaster preparedness \nfor effective response, and rebuilding better in recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction. \n \n8.  The program supports equitable and sustainable urban development under the results \nframework of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Armenia, 2014\u20132018.9 It is aligned with the \nUrban Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020 in terms of planning and investing in infrastructure and \nservices for sustainable urban systems and promoting an improved environment and resilience. \nThe program is aligned with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Integrated Disaster Risk Management, \n2014\u20132020  and  Education  by  2020:  A  Sector  Operations  Plan. 10  ADB  has  significant \nexperience in disaster recovery including supporting recovery from major earthquakes in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, India, Pakistan, and the Philippines, and improving school seismic \nsafety in Bhutan and Nepal.11 ADB also has gained considerable experience in Armenia since \nthe country became an ADB member in 2005. \n \n9.  Results-based lending (RBL) is a suitable modality for the program because (i) the \ngovernment has formulated the School Strengthening and Renovation Program in which the \nRBL program can be anchored; (ii) the government has gained and demonstrated reasonable \ncapacity through implementing investments in school seismic strengthening and renovation \nusing its own systems and through implementing projects funded by development partners; (iii) \nusing the government\u2019s systems will provide incentives for the government to further improve its \n                                                \n8  Government of Armenia. 2015.

The program\u2019s design has incorporated the lessons learned from earlier operations in \nseismic disaster recovery and risk management, including 10 lessons summarized by ADB\u2019s \nIndependent Evaluation Department in response to Nepal\u2019s earthquake.12 In addition, lessons \nlearned from implementing RBL in other programs have also been incorporated in the program\u2019s \ndesign, including the need to have a small number of disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs), a \nstrong focal unit dedicated to RBL implementation, actions to strengthen government systems, \nand a disbursement protocol that is not overly complicated or ambitious. \n \nC.  Program Scope \n \n11.  The  program  will  support  a  portion  of  the  government\u2019s  School  Strengthening  and \nRenovation Program covering the activities from 2015 to 2020.

The outcome indicator and some output indicators, selected based on their significance \nto achieving the program impact and outcome, have been further developed and consolidated \ninto the program DLIs. \n(i)  Results  area  1:  Increasing  seismic  resilience  of  school  buildings.  The \nprogram will support the strengthening or reconstruction of school buildings of at \nleast 46 priority schools identified under the government\u2019s School Strengthening \nand  Renovation  Program  (DLI  2  and  program  action  plan  [PAP]  2\u20137),  in \naccordance with updated building codes and the guidelines for school building \nretrofitting (DLI 4 and PAPs 12 and 13). The strengthened or reconstructed \nschool buildings will meet the internationally accepted seismic safety standards \nfor an earthquake of Medvedev\u2013Sponheuer\u2013Karnik scale IX. The strengthened \nor  reconstructed  buildings  will  also  meet  the  government\u2019s  requirements  on \nenergy efficiency, with wheelchair accessible trails and sex-segregated toilets.13 \n(ii)  Results area 2: Strengthening seismic disaster preparedness and response \ncapacity. An emergency response action plan will be developed for each school \nstrengthened or reconstructed under the program. Awareness campaigns will be \nconducted for at least 46 communities in the same neighborhoods as these \nschools (DLI 3 and PAP 10). Vocational training will be provided to at least 100 \nconstruction  managers  and  workers  to  improve  their  seismic  strengthening \nconstruction  technology  knowledge,  techniques,  and  skills.  In  addition, \nequipment will be provided to modernize 15 seismic observation stations. At least \n45 staff in the seismic observation stations will be trained to improve their seismic \nmonitoring and projection capacity. \n(iii)  Results  area  3:  Improving  supportive  policies  and  systems  for  seismic \ndisaster risk management and reduction. The program will support (a) the \nreview and update of the country\u2019s building codes for school buildings so they are \nharmonized with international seismic safety standards (DLI 4 and PAP 12), (b) \ndevelopment of guidelines for school building strengthening and retrofitting in line \nwith  international  best  practices  (DLI  4  and  PAP  13),  (c)  update  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s School Strengthening and Renovation Program (DLI 4 and PAP \n14), and (d) update of the probabilistic seismic hazard map and seismic risk \nassessments (DLI 4 and PAP 15 and 16). A financing strategy will be developed \nto guide the financing of the investment needs for seismic risk management of \npublic infrastructure in the country. \n(iv)  Results area 4: Enhancing national capacity in executing and implementing \nthe  seismic  safety  investment  program.  The  program  will  strengthen  the \nArmenian Territorial Development Fund (ATDF) for effective implementation of \nthe  government\u2019s  School  Strengthening  and  Renovation  Program,  including \nproviding  additional  staff  to  the  ATDF (DLI  5, PAP  19),  updating the  ATDF \noperations manual, and developing or enhancing necessary systems and reports \nfor program implementation and management (DLI 5, PAPs 21\u201333). At least 30 \nstaff working on program implementation and management will be trained, and at \nleast 40% of them will be women (DLI 5, PAP 20). \n \n13.

The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSDR63,259,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the program. The loan \nterms and conditions are set out in para. 32. The interest during program implementation will be \ncapitalized in the loan. The financing plan is summarized in Table 4.  \n ", "6 \nTable 4: Program Financing Plan \nAmount   Share of Total  \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nGovernment  18.5  17.3 \nDevelopment partners   \n  Asian Development Bank   \n    Special Funds resources (loan)  88.5  82.7 \nTotal  107.0  100.0 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \n17.  The RBL will finance several prior results achieved before loan effectiveness but within \n12 months before loan signing. These include recruiting and deploying additional staff for the \nATDF  (DLI  5  and  PAP  19)  and  formulating  and  endorsing  the  government\u2019s  School \nStrengthening  and  Renovation  Program  (DLI  4  and  PAP  14).  Achieving  these  results  is \nessential for the successful implementation of the program. In addition, in response to the \ngovernment\u2019s request to start the program implementation earlier, the RBL will finance detailed \ndesigns of school buildings for priority schools, to be prepared under the guidance of the \ninternational and national seismic engineers hired under the program preparatory TA. \n \n18.  Disbursement arrangements. Financing under the ADB loan will be disbursed over 5 \nyears, subject to the achievement and verification of the agreed annual DLIs. The government \nwill ensure that the total program expenditures are equal to, or exceed, the total amount of the \nloan withdrawn.14 Prior to submitting the first application to ADB for withdrawal from the loan \naccount, the borrower will nominate a dedicated account for the program at the Central Bank of \nthe Republic of Armenia into which all loan account withdrawals will be deposited. Financing for \nprior results and advance financing is allowed to address related financing requirements. The \ngovernment will refund any advance financing amount outstanding within 6 months of program \ncompletion if DLIs are not achieved on or before program completion.15 Financing of prior \nresults will be allowed to support the government in initiating actions required to achieve year 1 \nDLIs.  Prior  to  the  disbursement  of  loan  proceeds,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  will  submit  a \nwithdrawal application, along with evidence verifying achievement of the DLIs in accordance \nwith the verification protocols. Partial disbursements are allowed for all DLIs as specified in the \nDLI matrix.16 Disbursements can be deferred or take place ahead of the planned schedule \ndepending on the achievements of the DLIs. \n \nF.  Capacity Development and Program Action Plan \n \n19.  Capacity development activities are included in the PAP, which has been developed to \ncomplement the program results framework and DLI matrix. The PAP includes key actions in \nspecific technical areas, fiduciary management, procurement, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), \nsafeguards, and gender and social equity. The capacity development activities will complement \nthe physical investments under the program and support program results through increasing \npublic awareness of seismic risk and emergency response; improving the country\u2019s seismic \nsafety planning and management competencies; and strengthening the program management, \nimplementation, and monitoring capacity. \n \n                                                \n14  Excluding local taxes and duties; expenditures for procurement of works, goods, and services from non-ADB \nmember countries; and expenditures for any prohibited investment activities provided in Appendix 5 of ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n15  Ceilings are 25% for advance financing and 20% for financing for prior results. The combined ceiling is 30%. \n16  Given  the  meaningful  impact  of  a  strengthened  or  reconstructed  school  in  protecting  students  during  an \nearthquake, the minimum threshold is set at one school strengthened or reconstructed. \n ", "7 \nG.  Technical Assistance \n \n20.  The attached capacity development TA will support the program implementation and \nguide the delivery of the program outputs.17 The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which \n$800,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-\nV). The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation and supplies, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nH.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  The program will be implemented from November 2015 to November 2020. The Ministry \nof Territorial Administration and Emergency Situations will be the executing agency and the \nATDF will serve as the implementing agency. The ATDF board will serve as the program \nsteering committee to oversee the program implementation.18 It will set the policy guidelines and \nstrategic direction for the program. \n \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n22.  The  assessment  concluded  that  (i)  the  national  building  codes  need  to  be  further \nimproved to meet international standards, (ii) guidelines for seismic strengthening of buildings \nneed to be developed to guide proper retrofitting of buildings in line with the seismic safety \nstandards,  (iii)  the  probabilistic  seismic  hazard  map  and  seismic  hazard  assessments  for \nschools need to be updated, and (iv) the national seismic observation network needs to be \nmodernized and the capacity of its staff strengthened. Overall, public awareness of the seismic \nrisks and the proper response during an earthquake remains inadequate. These conclusions \nunderpin  the  result  areas,  key  actions,  and  performance  indicators  of  the  program.  The \nprogram\u2019s design and implementation arrangements are sound and the results framework is \nwell designed. The program implementing agency, the ATDF, is an agency with experience in \nprojects focused on community development targeting vulnerability and physical infrastructure. \n \n23.  Given the vulnerable state of the school buildings, their importance to the general public, \nand their intended use as shelters after earthquakes, public spending on strengthening school \nbuildings is justified. Under the government\u2019s School Strengthening and Renovation Program, \nschool  buildings  are  assessed  and  prioritized  based  on  comprehensive  criteria  including \nconsiderations  of  the  climate  change  risks  to  ensure  the  economic  efficiency  of  the \ninvestment.19 The program will support the update of the building code for school buildings to \nensure  it  is  equivalent  to  international  standards.  Development  of  guidelines  for  building \nretrofitting will guide proper strengthening of school buildings in accordance with the targeted \nseismic  safety  standards.  The  costs  for  school  building  retrofitting  and  reconstruction  are \nestimated  based  on  the  most  effective  technical  solution.  Additional  support  for  improving \n                                                \n17    To be implemented from November 2015 to October 2017. \n18  The ATDF board consists of the prime minister (chair), vice-prime-minister; minister of territorial administration \nand emergency situations, minister of finance, minister of economy, minister of urban development, minister of \neducation and science, minister of labor and social affairs, representatives from four civil society organizations \n(Vardanants Knights, Hayastan All Armenia Fund, Armenian General Benevolent Union, and Aznavour for \nArmenia charitable organization), and the ATDF executive director. \n19  Prioritization criteria include seismic hazard levels of the school locations; vulnerability level of the building types; \nthe number of students; the age of the school buildings; technical and physical conditions; the existence of \nsecondary hazards, including climate change risks; and the existence of buildings, structures, and objects with \nhigh vulnerability adjacent to the school buildings. \n ", "8 \nseismic disaster preparedness and response capacity, strengthening supportive policies and \nsystems  for  seismic  disaster  risk  management,  and  enhancing  capacity  in  executing  and \nimplementing the seismic safety investment program will complement the physical investment to \nmaximize the program\u2019s development impact and improve its sustainability. \n \n24.  The  National  Strategy  for  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  provides  for,  among  others, \nconsideration of the different but equal needs of men and women in disaster risk management \nand  encouragement  of  women\u2019s  participation  in  decision-making  processes.  The  country\u2019s \nGender  Policy  Strategic  Action  Plan  also  calls  for  gender  assessment  and  monitoring  in \nemergency situations and the provision of mechanisms and resources to mainstream gender in \nthe management of emergency situations. The social and gender assessment identified the \nfollowing gaps and risks: (i) limited participation of women in disaster risk management; (ii) \nlimited awareness of students and community members, especially housewives often left at \nhome with young children and the elderly, on seismic and disaster risks; (iii) limited collection of \nsex-disaggregated  data  in  disaster  management;  and  (iv)  lack  of  systematic  emergency \nresponse plans in schools and local communities. The program is categorized as effective \ngender mainstreaming and has incorporated social and gender indicators and actions in the \ndesign and monitoring framework, DLIs, and PAP to address these issues. While the ATDF has \na social and gender focal person, more systematic gender training will be provided for ATDF \nstaff to further strengthen the gender perspective in the program implementation. \n \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n25.  Monitoring and evaluation system. Responsibility for M&E is dispersed among several \ninstitutions. Most of the systems have been developed in the context of donor-funded projects, \nmainly  projects  supported  by  the World  Bank.  Institutions  such  as  the  National  Centre  of \nEducation Technologies, the Centre for Education Project, the ATDF, and the Ministry of Urban \nDevelopment  have  reasonably  well-developed  systems  with  databases  and  management \ninformation systems (MISs) largely focused on inputs and outputs. The ATDF\u2019s MIS and M&E \nunit needs to be modestly restructured and expanded to cater to the new program\u2019s elements. \nThe following actions have been included in the PAP with results incorporated in the program \nresults  framework,  including  selected  DLIs:  (i)  increase  staff  strength  and  improve  their \ncapabilities  through  training,  capacity  development,  and  consultancy  support;  (ii)  provide \ntechnical support to strengthen the ATDF\u2019s MIS to incorporate program-specific indicators, \nincluding social and gender indicators; and (iii) develop capacity to assess quality, verify design \nand building standards, and validate technical and social assessments. \n \n26.  Fiduciary  systems.  Assessments  identified  strong  performance  in  policy-based \nbudgeting and budget execution but weakness in internal control, quality of annual financial \nstatements, and internal and external audit. The government\u2019s annual budget execution reports \nare prepared according to a consistent format guided by Soviet-era accounting instructions. \nHowever, this format is not consistent with International Public Sector Accounting Standards. \nAudit  is  not  fully  consistent  with  International  Organization  of  Supreme  Audit  Institutions \nstandards,  and  audit  opinion  does  not  fully  reveal  the  accounting  standards  used  by  the \ngovernment or the standards used by the auditors. There would be significant financial reporting \nand auditing risks in using the country\u2019s public financial management system in the short and \nmedium term. To mitigate the risks, a separate program account will be set up for the program \ncovering all sources of finances, and annual consolidated program financial statements will be \nprepared and audited, applying international standards on financial reporting and auditing. \n \n27.  Procurement  systems.  Armenia  is  a  member  of  the  Government  Procurement \nAgreement of the World Trade Organization. Its public procurement legislative and regulatory \n ", "9 \nframeworks, including the Public Procurement Law, are generally consistent with international \nstandards  including  European  Union  procurement  directives. 20  Electronic  government \nprocurement has been in place since 2014. Several development partners are supporting the \ngovernment in improving the quality of electronic government procurement. The ATDF has been \nimplementing  projects  funded  by  the  World  Bank  following  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures adjusted for World Bank guidelines. To implement the program, the ATDF needs to \nengage  additional  procurement  staff,  adopt  recommended  procedures,  develop  standard \nbidding documents, strengthen its capacity for technical bid evaluation including a pass or fail \nstandard  for  nonconforming  bids,  update  its  operations  manual,  and  submit  an  annual \nprocurement  monitoring  report  to  the  ATDF  board.  For  schools  to  be  covered  under  the \nprogram, the majority of the procurement will be done using national competitive bidding for civil \nworks. The average cost of each contract is estimated to be $1.5 million\u2013$2.0 million. \n \n28.  The Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities \nin  Results-Based  Lending  for  Programs  (Anticorruption  Guidelines)  were  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  government,  the  Ministry  of  Territorial  Administration  and  Emergency \nSituations, and the ATDF.21  \n \n29.  Safeguard systems. The program will trigger an environmental assessment to mitigate \nmoderate adverse environmental impacts which are typical for reconstruction and rehabilitation \nof small to medium-sized buildings.22 The following gaps are identified between the national \nenvironmental system and the principles under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009): (i) no \nenvironmental assessment is required by the national legislation for school buildings of less \nthan  1,500  square  meters,  (ii)  inadequate  enforcement  of  environmental  assessment  and \nmanagement  for  buildings  larger  than  1,500  square  meters,  and  (iii)  no  environmental \nassessment review framework with grievance redress mechanism. The actions and measures \nto  address  these  gaps  have  been  included  in  the  PAP  and  results  framework,  including \nstrengthening  the  ATDF  to  implement  environmental  safeguard  actions  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement principles for environment category B projects. No involuntary \nresettlement or indigenous peoples impact are envisaged under the program, as strengthening \nor  reconstruction  of  school  buildings  will  be  at  existing  locations  and  Armenia  is  fairly \nhomogeneous in ethnic composition. A screening checklist has been developed to ensure that \nany program activities which may fall under ADB category A for environment or involve any \ninvoluntary resettlement as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement are excluded. \n \nC.  Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n \n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5. The overall benefits \nand impacts are expected to outweigh the risks and costs. \n \nTable 5: Summary of Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Rating  Key Mitigating Measures \nResults.
