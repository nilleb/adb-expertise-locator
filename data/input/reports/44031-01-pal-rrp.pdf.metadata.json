Water  tariffs  in  Palau  are  low  by \ninternational standards. Average household expenditure for water by the residents of Koror and \nAirai is about 1% of average monthly household income, compared with the international norm \nof  5%.2  Sanitation  services  in  Palau  are  provided  free  of  charge.  The  low  water  tariffs  do  not \nencourage  prudent  water  consumption  of  treated  water. 3   Consumption  is  estimated  at \n169 gallons per person a day, or more than 5 times greater than in Asian countries. \n\n3. \nHigh  subsidies. The water and sanitation sector is the only utility service in Palau that \noperates  with  high  subsidies.  Power  and  telecommunications  services  have  already  been \ncorporatized  and  attract  no  government  subsidies.  Only  20%  of  the  total  operational  cost  of \nproviding  water  and  sanitation  services  is  recovered  through  water  charges,  with  the  balance \nsubsidized by the Government of Palau (government). The government\u2019s budget support for the \ndelivery of water and sanitation services for FY2010 of $2.4 million or 1.2% of gross domestic \nproduct  (GDP)  is  similar  to  the  government\u2019s  FY2010  projected  fiscal  deficit.  Water  subsidies \nare    not    targeted    to    the    poor    and    disproportionately    benefit    wealthier    Palauans.4  The \ngovernment\u2019s  objective  is  to  eliminate  subsidies  in  the  sector  by  increasing  charges  to  reflect \nthe full cost of supplying these services. This will help the government achieve its medium-term \nfiscal  target  of  a  5%  reduction  in  expenditure  over  the  next  5  years,  consistent  with  the \nInternational Monetary Fund\u2019s recommendations.5 \n\n4. \nWater  shortage  may  hinder  tourism  growth.  Current  demand  projections  show  that \nwithout intervention, demand will exceed supply by 1.4 million gallons per day by 2020. Demand \ngrowth will be primarily driven by increasing tourist arrivals. Tourism is the largest private sector \ncomponent  of  the  economy,  accounting  for  almost  half  of  the  country\u2019s  GDP.  Tourist  arrivals \nalready exceed 80,000 per year, or four times the national population and are projected to grow \nby an average of 4.4% per annum over the next 10 years. The resident population of Koror and \nAirai  is  projected  to  grow  by  0.5%  per  annum.  Yields  from  water  sources  for  the  Koror\u2013Airai \nwater  supply  are  insufficient  to  meet  current  demand  during  periods  of  prolonged  drought, \nexpected to intensify due to climate change. Improving the climate resilience of the water supply \nwould require the construction of a large reservoir at an estimated cost exceeding $25 million, \nwhich  is  not  financially  viable.  However,  efficiency  improvements\u2014including  demand-side \nmanagement and reduction of nonrevenue water\u2014are expected to remove the projected supply \ngap without adversely impacting tourism growth and associated private sector development. \n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   About  14%  of  water  provided  in  Koror  and  Airai  is  unmetered  and  incurs  a  flat  fee.  Metered  connections  are \n\ncharged at $0.85 per 1,000 gallons. Water tariffs in the Pacific range from $0.19 to $7.50 per 1,000 gallons.  \n\n3   Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n4   These subsidies disproportionately benefit Palau\u2019s wealthy, with 53% of all subsidized water delivered to those in \n\nthe top income quartile. Government of Palau. 2008. Household Income and Expenditure Report. Koror. \n\n5   IMF. 2010. Article IV Staff Report. Washington, DC. The report recommends the government reduce expenditures \n\nby 1.5% of GDP each year, in part through the elimination of subsidies. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n5. \nFragmented responsibilities  within  the  sector. The Koror\u2013Airai water supply system \nprovides  treated  water  to  approximately  77%  of  Palau\u2019s  population  living  in  Koror  and  Airai \nstates. The Koror\u2013Airai water supply system is operated and maintained by the Bureau of Public \nWorks  (BPW),  a  division  of  the  Ministry  of  Public  Infrastructure,  Industry  and  Commerce \n(MPIIC). BPW also operates and maintains separate systems in 14 states on behalf of the state \ngovernments. 6   Multiple  agencies  are  responsible  for  water  supply  and  sewerage  service \ndelivery,  with  no  agreed  plan  or  central  coordination.  The  capital  infrastructure  project  unit  of \nMPIIC is responsible for the design and development of infrastructure. The BPW is responsible \nfor  water  supply  and  sewerage  treatment.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  Division  of  Utility \nCollections, is responsible for billing and payment collection. Currently, no agency is responsible \nfor  tariff  setting,  infrastructure  investment,  and  planning.  No  budget  is  provided  for  capital \nexpenditure,  as  all  public  water  infrastructure  development  since  the  Palau\u2019s  independence  in \n1994 has been financed by grants. The water sector maintenance budget is approximately 1.7% \nof the value of the assets, which is below the international norm of 2%. Many of the assets have \nexceeded their design life, and thus have no book value. \n\n6. \nInefficient  operations  and  management.  Operations  are  inefficient  and  losses  are \nhigh, with nonrevenue water at 43% of production. Collection rates have historically been poor, \nat  60%\u201365%  of  billing.  Management  and  organizational  planning  is  limited.  Maintenance  is \nunder-funded,  and  not  all  needed  technical  skills  are  available.  There  is  scope  to  improve \nperformance  within  the  sector,  but  this  will  require  an  overhaul  of  current  operations  and \nmanagement  and  the  introduction  of  a  capacity  building  program.  Water  and  sewerage  flow \nmetering  to  improve  maintenance  and  leak  detection,  adjustment  of  the  pricing  of  water  and \nsewerage, and remedial programs will also improve efficiency.  \n\n7. \nInadequate  legal  and  regulatory  framework.  Current  legislation  is  outdated  and \nrequires  updating  and  consolidation  to  empower  a  new  water  and  sewerage  authority, \nparticularly  in  the  areas  of  water  abstraction  and  sewerage  disposal,  obligations  for  natural \nresource  management,  and  rights  of  a  utility  to  undertake  its  duties  and  functions  as  a  water \nand sewerage services provider.  \n\n8. \nLegislative changes need to reflect the government\u2019s commitment to reform in the water \nand sanitation sector, recognizing that tariff reform in the sector is critical to reduce demand and \nprovide a reliable, full cost-recovery service (footnote 6). This commitment is articulated in the \nMedium-Term  Development  Strategy  (MTDS)  2009\u20132014, 7  which  was  developed  to  support \nimplementation  of  the  National  Master  Development  Plan.8  The  program  supports  the  MTDS \ngoals  and  actions  by  (i) investing  in  the  water  and  sanitation  sector,  (ii)  moving  state-owned \nenterprises toward  full  cost  recovery,  and  (iii)  reducing  government  expenditure  by  eliminating \nsubsidies. The Palau country partnership strategy, 2009\u201320139 supports the goals and actions \nof  the  government\u2019s  MTDS  and  includes  technical  and  financial  support  for  sewerage  sector \nplanning, improving water resource management, and water and sanitation sector infrastructure \ndevelopment. \n\n9. \nThe  program  also  applies  lessons  from  earlier  ADB  policy  programs  in  the  Pacific,  as \nwell as ADB's approach to engaging with weakly performing countries, notably by (i) adopting a \ncountry-led  set  of  policy  actions  developed  in  an  open,  participatory  manner  and  at  a  pace  in \n\n                                                 \n6   Sector Assessment (Summary): Water and Sanitation (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7   Government of Palau. 2009.

The \n\n10. \nprogram outcome will be that the demand for water and sewerage services is met. \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nC. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n1.  \n\nLegal and Policy Framework for Water Sector Improvement is in Place \n\n11. \nThe  program  will  establish  the  policy  and  legal  framework  to  enable  the  provision  of \nsustainable and efficient water and sewerage services by an independent, government-owned \ncorporate entity. The government is expected to pass an act that would create the Palau Water \nand  Sewer  Corporation  (PWSC).  The  act  will  empower  the  PWSC,  through  an  independent \nboard,  to  provide  water  and  sewerage  services  throughout  Palau  and  set  tariffs  for  full  cost \nrecovery.  The  draft  act  covers  (i)  the  transfer  of  physical  water  sector  assets  from  the \ngovernment  to  PWSC,  (ii)  the  transfer  of  the  existing  staff  from  the  relevant  government \nministries,  and  (iii)  the  right  to  collect  and  retain  revenue  and  enter  into  debt.  Regulations  for \ndetailed operational issues have been prepared. The board will set its own bylaws. The draft act \nalso  allows  for  outsourcing  the  management  function  to  a  private  company  of  international \nstanding. The PWSC will meet external water and sanitation quality standards.  \n\n12. \nUnder the program, the government will increase the water tariffs in 2010 by regulation \nand establish a sewerage tariff for the first time. Further tariff increases will be required before \nthe PWSC is fully operational, and the government has committed to making these increases in \nFY2012 under the program. \n\nimplementation, \n\nDuring  program \n\nthe  government  will \n\nfor  public \n13. \nmanagement of water resources (including a National Water Resources Management Plan) that \nincorporate  the  rights  and  responsibilities  of  water  users  in  helping  to  manage  the  country\u2019s \nwater  resources.  The  government  will  also  seek  changes  to  legislation  to  implement  the  plan \nand  to  further  assist  the  sustainable  management  of  Palau\u2019s  terrestrial  and  marine  resources \nincluding:  (i)  permits  for  water  abstraction,  (ii)  issuing  abstraction  permits,  and  (iii)  sewage \ntreatment and disposal.  \n \n\nissue  policies \n\n2. \n\nAn  Independent  Palau  Water  and  Sewer  Corporation  Delivers  Improved \nServices \n\n14. \nTransition  to  Palau  Water  and  Sewer  Corporation.  To  improve  the  operational \nefficiency  and  reduce  the  fragmentation  of  responsibilities  in  the  sector,  the  PWSC  will  be \ncreated.  The  PWSC  will  be  legally  established  including  the  appointment  of  a  board  and  the \nboard\u2019s  appointment  of  key  staff.  Over  the  next  12-18  months,  the  necessary  regulations, \npolicies,  and  plans  for  the  PWSC  to  be  able  to  deliver  water  and  sewerage  services  will  be \nprepared.  These  will  include:  (i)  preparation  of  an  organizational  structure  to  deliver  the \nfunctions  of  the  PWSC,  (ii)  finalization  of  an  assets  register,  (iii)  development  of  an  asset \nmanagement plan, (iv) preparations to transfer current staff from the government to the PWSC, \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2009.

In  addition  to \nproviding  support  for  organizational  and  management-related  strengthening,  there  will  be \ncapacity building in technical management and planning, including through the development of \n(i) guidelines and technical standards, (ii) an infrastructure maintenance plan, (iii) an investment \nplan,  and  (iv)  an  institutional  development  plan.  The  program  will  provide  ongoing  technical \nsupport during this transition phase. \n\n15.  MPIIC will continue to deliver water and sewerage services while the PWSC is preparing \nto  take  full  responsibility.  When  all  preparations  are  complete,  the  President  will  declare  the \nPWSC \u2018operationally effective\u2019 and the staff and relevant assets will transfer to the PWSC.   \n\n16. \nCapacity  building.  A  capacity-building  program  to  help  improve  the  effectiveness  and \nefficiency  of  services  will  be  implemented  in  early  2011  through  the  program.  The  capacity \ndevelopment program will initially be implemented within MPIIC Water and Sewer Divisions, and \nwill  continue  within  PWSC  when  operations  commence.  Components  of  the  capacity-building \nprogram  cover  (i)  mentoring  of  management  personnel,  (ii)  strengthening  administrative \ncapacity,  and  (iii)  developing  the  technical  skills  of  the  water  and  sewerage  operation  teams. \nThe  government  will  ensure  PWSC  is  professionally  managed  and  operated,  and  the  draft \nPWSC act requires an experienced management team to be in place. \n\nThe program steering committee (PSC),11 MPIIC, and the program implementation unit \n17. \n(PIU)  will  manage  and  oversee  the  transitional  activities.  The  PIU  will  contract  external  TA  to \nhelp  with  the  transition  to,  and  capacity  building  of,  the  PWSC.  This  assistance  will  include \nexpertise  in  utility  management,  operational  management,  and  finance.  Once  operational, \nPWSC will be responsible for delivering water and sewage services in Palau. The government \nwill  continue  to  provide  budget  support  to  the  sector  until  the  PWSC  becomes  financially \nindependent  by  FY2015.  Tariffs  will  be  progressively  increased  to  achieve  full  cost  recovery \nduring this time.  \n\n18. \nADB technical assistance. To further support the capacity development of the PWSC, \nADB  will  utilize  resources  under  an  existing  TA  project  to  facilitate  its  transition  to  operational \neffectiveness. 12   TA  funds  will  help  develop  the  maintenance,  operations,  and  infrastructure \ninvestment plans.  \n\n19. \nImproving  Palau  Water  and  Sewer  Corporation  operational  efficiency.  Consistent \nwith  the  MTDS\u2019s  overarching  goal  of  reducing  costs  and  ensuring  water  conservation,  the \ngovernment will set benchmarks for operational efficiency improvements. During transition to full \ncost  recovery,  PWSC  will  be  expected  to  (i)  reduce  nonrevenue  water  from  43%  to  25%,  (ii) \nprogressively  increase  tariffs  to  achieve  full  cost  recovery  by  FY2015,  and  (iii)  improve \ncollections to at least 95% of billings by FY2015. The board will consider additional performance \nstandards for the PWSC. \n\n20. \nTo  achieve  these  benchmarks,  the  PWSC  will  have  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  water \nand  sewer  sector  operations,  including  by  (i)  implementing  100%  consumer  metering,  (ii) \ndisconnecting  all  illegal  connections,  (iii)  identifying  non-metered  connections  and  scheduling \ntheir  meter  connections,  (iv)  improving  water  management  through  better  monitoring  by \ninstalling  flow  meters  within  the  existing  network  and  at  all  storage  tanks,  and  (v)  reducing \n\n                                                 \n11  The PSC is established and consists of the vice-president and minister of finance (chair) and representatives from \nMPIIC, the Office of the President, the Office of the Vice-President, the Palau Public Utility Corporation, a member \nof the House of Delegates, and a member of the Senate. \n\n12  ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n\n\fsystem  losses  through  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  a  leak  detection  and  repair \nprogram.  Some  of  these  measures  will  take  until  FY2015  to  complete.  Meeting  these \nbenchmarks will help achieve reliable and affordable services.  \n\n \n\n3. \n\nFull Cost Recovery is Achieved in the Water and Sewerage Sector \n\n21. \nThe MTDS outlines the government\u2019s policy of requiring people to pay tariffs that allow \nservices and utilities to operate on a full cost-recovery basis. This will allow the government to \nremove  subsidies  and  enable  the  sector  to  self-invest  in  maintenance  and  infrastructure \ndevelopment.  Transition  to  full  cost  recovery  will  take  4 years.  The  program  supports  (i) \nprogressive tariff increases up to the point of full cost recovery; and (ii) budget support to cover \nthe  difference  between  tariff  revenue  and  actual  costs  during  this  transition.  The  first  and \nsecond tariff increases will be regulated by the Minister of Finance in (i) late 2010, to become \neffective in February 2011; and (ii) in late 2011, to become effective in February 2012. The third \nand  fourth  tariff  increases  being  recommended  to  achieve  full  cost  recovery  for  PWSC  will  be \nenacted by the PWSC board in subsequent years.  \n\nTo achieve full cost recovery in 4 years, tariffs for consumption of up to 5,000 gallons of \n22. \nwater per month will need to increase from $0.85 to $1.30 per 1,000 gallons consumed (a 53% \nincrease).  Sewerage  tariffs  will  also  need  to  be  charged,  and  will  start  at  $0.30/1,000  gallons. \nTariffs  for  high  residential  water  users  (over  5,000  gallons)  and  non-residential  users  will \nincrease more steeply to $3.36/1,000 gallons. These rates will encourage prudent consumption \nand facilitate maintaining a sustainable supply of treated water. Commercial sewerage tariffs will \nbe introduced at $1.70/1,000 gallons and increase steadily over the 4 years. \n\nDuring the transition to full cost recovery, PWSC will operate at a loss. The government, \n23. \nthrough the program, has committed to fund the shortfall through annual budget appropriations \ntotaling  $5.1  million.  This  budget  support  will  include  $2.5  million  in  FY2011,  $1.5  million  in \nFY2012, with the remaining $1.1 million depending on the tariffs set by the PWSC board in late \n2012  and  2013.  The  government  will  enter  into  a  financial  agreement  with  the  PWSC  to  (i) \nassist in implementing the sector reforms, (ii) make possible the improvements in technical and \nmanagerial capacity and operational efficiency, and (iii) promote water conservation and health \nawareness.  The  government  will  provide  financial  assistance  in  the  form  of  a  loan  of  up  to \n$6 million  to  the  PWSC  to  achieve  these  objectives.  Through  the  financial  agreement,  the \ngovernment  will  also  provide  grant  transition  financing  of  up  to  $2.6  million.13  The  grant  will \ncover the difference between revenue collected by the PWSC and the full cost of operations. \n\n24. \nAt the end of the transition to full cost recovery in October 2015, the government will no \nlonger provide financial support to the sector. The PWSC will have the ability to charge tariffs to \nmaintain infrastructure and make new investments. The government will have improved its fiscal \nposition by at least $2.2 million (1.1% of GDP) per year as recommended by the International \nMonetary Fund (footnote 5). \n\n4. \n\nEffective Public Consultation is in Place \n\nADB  lessons  from  implementing  reform  across  the  Pacific  stress  the  importance  of \n25. \npublic consultation before and during the reforms. Broad public support is important to achieving \nreform in the water and sanitation sector. Under the program, the government has undertaken a \npublic  advocacy  program  with  politicians,  civil  society,  and  community  groups  on  the \ngovernment\u2019s policy, its importance to Palau\u2019s future, and the impact on the people. In doing so, \n                                                 \n13 The value of the grant will be determined by the date on which the PWSC is declared operationally effective. Until \n\nthis time, budget support will be channeled through the MPIIC.  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fthey  have  sought  support  for  the  creation  of  PWSC  and  for  tariff  reform,  thereby  reducing  the \nrisk  that  support  will  wane  over  time.  The  PWSC  will  conduct  an  awareness  campaign  on  the \nimportance of water conservation and behavior change to help the community adapt to the new \npolicy  arrangements  and  minimize  their  impact.  The  awareness  campaign  will  include  support \nfor sanitation, hygiene, water use, and health awareness. \n\nimpact  on \n\nImpacts  of  government  reform.  The \n\n26. \nfinancial \nsustainability and operational performance will fundamentally improve under the reforms being \nintroduced by the government. The PWSC will return a profit by FY2015 and the government\u2019s \nfiscal  position  will  be  improved  by  at  least  $2.2  million  per  year  (Table  1).  The  creation  and \nstrengthening of the PWSC will enable significant efficiency improvements and set the sector on \na path to long-term sustainable management of the resources to facilitate growth and address \nthe impacts of climate change in Palau. \n \n\nthe  water  sector\u2019s \n\nTable 1: Water and Sanitation Sector Financial Impact \n\nItem \nAverage water tariff ($) \nAverage sewerage tariff ($) \nSystem losses (%) \nSector financial projections \nTotal revenue ($ million) \nTotal expenses ($ million) \nNet profit/loss ($ million) \n \nGovernment subsidy ($ million) \n\nFY2010\n0.85 \n0.00 \n43 \n\n0.52 \n2.60 \n(2.08)\n   \n2.08 \n\nFY2011\n0.96  \n0.69  \n43 \n \n\n0.76  \n2.99 \n(2.23)\n\nFY2012\n1.37  \n0.81  \n40 \n \n\n1.72  \n3.13 \n(1.41) \n\n2.23  \n\n1.41  \n\nFY2013 \n1.82  \n1.02  \n30 \n \n\n2.25  \n3.30 \n(1.05) \n  \n1.05  \n\n2.36  \n1.30  \n35 \n \n\nFY2014  FY2015\n2.62 \n1.44 \n25 \n \n3.21 \n3.17 \n0.03 \n \n0.00 \n\n2.90  \n3.29 \n(0.40) \n\n0.40  \n\n( ) = negative, FY = 1 October to 30 September. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nD. \n\nProgram Costs and Financing \n\n27. \nThe  government  has  requested  (i)  a  loan  of  $12.6  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  (OCR),  and  (ii)  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR2.23  million  ($3.4 \nmillion equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund [ADF] loan) \nto  help  finance  its  reform  program.  The  OCR  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  3  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. The government \nhas  provided  ADB  with  (i) the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere its own independent decision and not  made in reliance on any  communication or advice \nfrom  ADB.  The  ADF  loan  will  have  a  24-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an \ninterest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The borrower will be the \nRepublic  of  Palau.  Proceeds  of  the  program  loan  are  expected  to  be  used  within  24  months \nfrom the date of loan effectiveness. \n\n28. \nThe  size  of  the  Program  has  been  determined  after  due  consideration  of:  (i)  the \nprojected  financing  requirements  for  the  sector  over  the  implementation  period  at  about  $16 \nmillion;  (ii)  the  lack  of  available  cofinancing  resources;  (iii)  the  direct  costs  of  supporting  tariff \nreform, Output 3, of approximately $5.1 million; (iv) adjustment costs in restructuring the sector, \nincluding  reticulation  network  refurbishment,  improving  sector  commercial  capacity,  and \ncapacity development programs through Outputs 1, 2, and 4 of approximately $6 million; and (v) \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fthe significance and sensitivity of the policy actions. The government will contribute $1.2 million \nthrough in-kind and cash contributions to implement the program. \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nProgram  management. MOF will be the executing agency and will be responsible for \n29. \nthe overall implementation, financial management, and budget support required under the \nprogram. The implementing agency will initially be MPIIC, with PWSC serving as implementing \nagency once it becomes operationally effective (prior to the release of the second tranche). The \nimplementing  agency  will  be  responsible  for  implementation  of  outputs  2,  3,  and  4  under  the \ndirection  of  the  PSC.  A  financing  agreement  between  the  government  and  the  PWSC  will \nmanage the rights and obligations of the PWSC to implement the program. MOF will establish \nthe PIU and provide ongoing support to the executing agency and implementing agencies. The \nPIU  will  be  staffed  with  national  staff  supported  by  international  consultants.  The  PSC  will  be \nresponsible for overall direction, guidance, and monitoring of the program. The government and \nPSC  recognize  the  challenges  and  have  engaged  all  the  stakeholders  early  in  the  reform \nprocess. The government and members of the PSC were involved in establishing Palau\u2019s power \nutility and bring this experience and insight to the program.

All  disbursements  and  policy  actions  in  the  policy \nmatrix  will  be  implemented  on  delivery  of  the  second  tranche  conditions  by  April  2012. \nImplementation will finish after full cost recovery of the PWSC has been achieved by September \n2014.  The  PIU  and  PWSC  will  continue  to  implement  the  reforms  after  release  of  the  second \ntranche. ADB will continue to undertake joint reviews until December 2014.  \n\n32. \nCounterpart  funds.  The  government  will  ensure  counterpart  funding  will  be  used  to \nfinance costs  under  the  program,  including,  but  not  limited to  (i)  developing  a legal  and  policy \n\n                                                 \n14  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nframework for the water sector, (ii) establishing a PWSC, (iii) providing transitional finance until \nPWSC becomes financially autonomous, and (iv) promoting water conservation.  \n\n33. \nProcurement  and  disbursement.  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  to  the \ngovernment  as  the  borrower  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Simplified  Disbursement  Procedures  and \nRelated Requirements for Program Loans.15 The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements  agreed  upon  between  the  government  and  ADB.  The  proceeds  will  finance  the \nfull foreign exchange costs, excluding local taxes and duties, of items produced and procured in \nADB member countries and exclude items on the list of ineligible items and imports financed by \nother bilateral and multilateral sources.16 No supporting import documentation will be required if, \nduring  each  year  that  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  Palau\u2019s  total \nimports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and disbursements made \nunder other official development assistance is greater than the amount of the loan expected to \nbe disbursed during such year. The government will certify its compliance with this formula with \neach  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be \nrequired. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and verify the accuracy of \nthe government's certification. \n\n34. \nAccounting, auditing, and performance management. The government will maintain \nrecords  of  account  for  the  program.  Prior  to  withdrawal,  the  government  will  open  a  deposit \naccount  at  a  bank  acceptable  to  ADB  to  receive  the  loan  proceeds.  The  account  will  be \nmanaged,  operated,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  terms  satisfactory  to  ADB.  MOF,  PSC, \nand ADB will monitor the progress of the program and measure performance.   \n\nA.  \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nThe  government  has  made  progress  in  improving  public  financial  management, \n35. \nparticularly  in  government  financial  accounting  and  reporting.  The  public  finance  legislative \nframework  is  robust  and  financial  management  systems  are  good.  Expenditure  has  been \naligned  with  revenue  in  the  current  fiscal  year.  However,  systems  for  budget  preparation  and \nmanagement  still  require  improvement.  Budget  appropriations  are  not  aligned  with  revenue, \nleading  to  persistent  deficits.  Cash  management  planning  also  inhibits  the  ability  to  plan  and \nmanage  expenditure.  The  Office  of  the  Public  Auditor  and  Office  of  the  Special  Prosecutor \nperform  their  mandate  effectively. 17   Recognizing  these  financial  management  issues,  the \ngovernment  sought  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  strengthen  budget  preparation  and  management. 18 \nLinked with this work, the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre is working with MOF to \nstrengthen cash management. \n\n36. \nPalau\u2019s government debt is low at 9.6% of GDP. The impact of the program loan will be \nto  increase  government  debt  to  15.5%  of  GDP.  Government  debt  servicing,  currently  0.8%  of \nGDP will also remain low. \n\n                                                 \n15 ADB. 1998. Simplified Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n16  List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17  ADB  conducted  a  governance  assessment  of  Palau  using  the  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan  I \n\nmethodology in preparation for the Palau Country Partnership Strategy, 2009\u20132013.  \n\n18 ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Palau for Implementing a Medium-Term Budget Framework. \n\nManila (TA 7421-PAL). \n\n \n\n\fB. \n\nGovernance \n\n37. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  MOF.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the program. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan documents.19  \n\n38.  MPIIC  has  the  technical  skills  to  maintain  the  water  and  sanitation  systems,  but  lacks \nspecialist  managers,  planners,  and  engineers  needed  to  create  a  separate  entity  outside \ngovernment.  Despite  strong  champions  for  this  reform,  there  is  also  a  limited  cadre  of  people \ncapable  of  managing  the  organizational  change  required  by  the  program.  The  government \nrecognizes the need for technical support and managers of organizational change. They will use \nloan funds for this purpose.  \n\n39. \nThe National Government Procurement Law is applied to all expenditure of government \nfunds.  It  emphasizes  the  government's  policy  of  promoting  fair  and  competitive  public \nprocurement and prescribes most of the important procurement matters to be followed. The law \nis enforced strictly. Competition and efficiency is maintained in MPIIC\u2019s procurement. \n\nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n40. \nThe PWSC\u2019s transition to full cost recovery in 4 years is designed to minimize the impact \non  the  poor.  The  new  tariff  structure  will  better  target  the  needs  of  the  poor.  The  first  5,000 \ngallons  (double  the  World  Health  Organization\u2019s  recommendations)  is  below  the  cost  of \nproduction to ensure affordability to the poor. The average total household water and sewerage \nbill will increase from 1% to 1.9% of average household income progressively over the 4 years. \nThe  program  includes  the  promotion  of  water  conservation  and  health  awareness  at  the \nhousehold level. The reliability of water supply during drought will improve, benefiting the poor. \nThe  program  will  improve  the  climate  resilience  of  Palau\u2019s  water  resources.  Over  time,  the \nprogram will yield broadly distributed social benefits by providing a foundation for improving the \nfiscal position of Palau. This will enhance the sustainable delivery of essential services.20 \n\nD. \n\nSafeguards  \n\n41. \nThe  program  has  been  classified  under  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  Improved  national  water  resource  planning,  water \nconservation,  and  strengthening  of  environmental  quality  control  regulations  relating  to  water \nabstraction  and  sewerage  outflow  are  expected  to  yield  positive  environmental  outcomes  and \nameliorate the negative impacts of climate change in the future. \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\n42. \nRisk  will  be  monitored  and  managed  by  the  PIU  during  program  implementation. \nChanges in risk assessment and risk mitigation will be monitored by the government and ADB \nthrough its scheduled reviews. Major risks and mitigating measures are in Table 3.21 \n\n                                                 \n19  Loan Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nPolitical commitment to annual tariff \nincreases for water and sewer services \nis not maintained. \n\nBudget appropriation in FY2012\u2013\nFY2015 is insufficient to provide \nbudget support during the transition to \nfull cost recovery. \n\nState governments do not relinquish \ntheir control over the water resources. \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nA public awareness campaign will be conducted, including on \nfinancial sustainability. A water conservation program will be \nconducted to facilitate a reduction in household bills.  \n \nThe policy matrix provides an obligation for budget support in \nFY2012. A financial agreement between the government and \nthe PWSC establishes a commitment to future financial support \nduring transition. \n \nPublic consultations on the legislation enacting the PWSC have \nbeen held to develop public commitment. Negotiations between \nstate and national governments on access to resources are \nongoing. \n\nFY = fiscal year, PWSC = Palau water and sewer corporation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIV.  \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n43. \nThe government and MOF have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement, as described in detail \nin the program implementation arrangements and loan documents. \n\n44. \nThe loan will become effective after: (i) all conditions for the release of the first tranche of \nthe program, as specified in the policy matrix and set out in Attachment 2 to Schedule 3 to the \nloan  agreement,  have  been  complied  with  to  the  satisfaction  of  ADB;  and  (ii)  the  government \nhas established the PSC and the PIU for the program.  \n\nV.  \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n45. \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  of  $12,600,000  to  the  Republic  of  Palau  for  the  Water  Sector \nImprovement Program from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with \nthose set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board; and  \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR2,230,000  to  the  Republic  of \nPalau  for  the  Water  Sector  Improvement  Program  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 24 years, including a grace \nperiod  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft program loan agreement presented to \nthe Board. \n\n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n15 October 2010 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nSustainable water \nand sewerage \nservices \n\nOutcome \nDemand for water \nand sewerage \nservices is met. \n\nOutputs \n1.
