The project components \ninclude  (i)  the  construction  of  a  220-kilovolt  (kV)  single-circuit  overhead  transmission  line \napproximately 364 kilometers (km) in length; (ii) the expansion, rehabilitation, and construction \nof  three  substations,  and  (iii)  institutional  development,  capacity  building,  and  project \nmanagement.2 \n \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nUzbekistan  has  one  of  the  fastest-growing  economies  in  Central  Asia  (the  growth  rate \naveraged 8% for 2010\u20132014), and aspires to become an upper middle-income country by 2020. \nGenerally  stable  macroeconomic  conditions  and  robust  growth  are  expected  to  continue,  with \nUzbekistan seeking to build a highly developed and diversified industrial and export base. The \nKarakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  regions  are  located  in  the  western  part  of  Uzbekistan,  with  3.3 \nmillion  residents  (or  12%  of  the  total  population),  and  will  continue  to  attract  large-scale \nindustrial  investment  projects. 3  A  reliable  power  supply  is  critical  to  support  industrial \ndevelopment  in  this  area.  Power  demand  in  the  region  is  forecast  to  grow  at  3%,  double  the \nexpected national average rate of 1.5% over the medium term.  \n \nThe country has ample primary energy resources.4 The total installed capacity for power \n4. \ngeneration in the country is about 13,500 megawatts (MW) including thermal power (86%) and \nhydropower  (14%).  In  2014,  the  country  generated  about  54,400  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  of \nelectric  power  and  exported  1,400  GWh  (2.6%).  Uzbekistan\u2019s  power  transmission  system \nconsists of 1,850 km of 500 kV lines, 6,200 km of 220 kV lines, and 15,300 km of 110 kV lines. \nThe  government  owns  and  manages  the  energy  sector  in  Uzbekistan.  The  Joint-Stock \nCompany Uzbekenergo is a vertically integrated and a 100% state-owned monopoly in charge \nof  electricity  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution;  it  operates  under  the  supervision  and \nregulation of the Cabinet of Ministers. The sector is corporatized with separate business units, \nand further commercialization of Uzbekenergo is planned.     \n \n5. \nUzbekistan\u2019s development priorities stress structural change and increased productivity. \nEnergy  efficiency  is  a  key  part  of  the  energy  sector  strategy.  The  government  adopted  policy \nand legal frameworks with clear goals to reduce energy intensity and losses; and action plans \ncovering  investments  and  institutional  change.  In  March  2015,  the  government  approved  a  5-\nyear  rolling  Program  of  Measures  to  Promote  Structural  Reforms,  Modernization  and \nDiversification  of  Production  in  2015\u20132019.  The  program  aims  to  ensure  an  adequate  and \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided project preparatory  technical  assistance for  the  Northwest  Region \n\nPower Transmission Line Project (TA 8618) in February 2014. \n\n3   Karakalpakstan covers  about 37% of the land area of Uzbekistan and has a population of 1.7 million and rich in \n\nnatural resources, while Khorezm, an agro-industrial region, has a population of 1.6 million. \n\n4   Including  1.8  trillion  cubic  meters  of  proven  natural  gas  reserves,  590  million  barrels  of  proven  oil  reserves,  and \n\nabout 3 billion tons of recoverable coal reserves. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nreliable  power  system;  and  improved  management,  operations,  and  performance  of  utilities \nbased on commercial principles. To improve energy efficiency, one combined-cycle gas turbine \n(CCGT) unit was commissioned in Navoi thermal power plant (TPP) and four more CCGT units \nare  under  preparation  with  confirmed  funding  from  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for \nreplacement  of  old  and  inefficient  gas-fired  steam  turbine  generation  units.5 A  loss-reduction \nprogram  was  initiated  that  uses  advanced  meters  to  increase  collections  and  reduce  losses.6 \nElectricity  tariffs  have  been  raised  steadily  since  2004  to  ensure  financial  sustainability. \nFinancial  transparency  has  improved  since  Uzbekenergo  (with  ADB  assistance),  adopted \nexternal  audits  based  on  the  International  Standards  on  Auditing  starting  with  fiscal  year  (FY) \n2011.  \n \n6. \n Key  challenges  in  the  sector  are  deteriorating  infrastructure  and  unreliable  power \nsupply. The existing Takhiatash TPP is the only power station located in the northwest region. \nADB  has  approved  a  loan7 to  finance  construction  of  two  CCGT  units  (230\u2013280  MW  each)  in \nTakhiatash TPP for replacement of old and inefficient gas-fired steam turbine generation units. \nHowever,  because  of  inadequate  investment,  the  existing  power  transmission  network  has \nlimited  capacity  to  transmit  additional  power.  The  power  transmission  system  was  designed \nduring the Soviet era with the objective of leveraging the diversified energy and water resources \nin  the  region.  Substation  locations  and  line  routings  did  not  take  country  borders  into \nconsideration,  as  these  were  then  irrelevant  with  the  result  that  the  existing  transmission  line \nfrom  Takhiatash  to  Navoi  passes  through  Turkmenistan.  Although  the  transmission  assets \nbelong  to  Uzbekistan,  difficulties  in  maintaining  these  causes  frequent  and  prolonged  outages \nwhich  reduces  production  rate  and  hampers  socioeconomic  development, \nto \ndissatisfaction  among  the  population.  Transmission  capacity  limitations  mean  the  excess \nproduction from TPP is difficult to evacuate, and Takhiatash TPP must adjust its production to \nthe highly variable local demand, result in wear and aging of generation blocks, and rendering \nits operations economically inefficient.   \n\nleading \n\n \nIn  addition,  most  of  the  transmission  facilities  are  aging  and  require  rehabilitation  and \n7. \nmodernization (the  Khorezm  substation  was  commissioned  more  than 40  years  ago,  in  1969). \nThe  poor  condition  of  these  assets  results  in  a  higher  risk  of  system  outages,  poor  energy \nservices,8 higher maintenance costs, and increased transmission losses.9 A strong transmission \nsystem is an essential component of efficient, reliable, and flexible infrastructure that meets the \ngrowing demand for electricity. \n \n8. \nThe  project  supports  ADB\u2019s  current  intervention  in  the  power  sector  and  contributes  to \nthe improvement of energy efficiency. The project is an outcome of the least-cost power system \nexpansion plan and is included in the government investment plan for 2015\u20132019. This project \n\n                                                \n5   ADB.  2010.

Manila. \n\n8  The energy not served because of system outages in the region was estimated at 158.4 GWH in 2013, or 6.4% of \n\nannual demand.  \n\n9  Uzbekenergo estimates overall system losses at 20% (transmission losses of 5% and distribution losses of 15%).   \n\n \n\n\f \n\nwill  remove  bottlenecks  and  ensure  that  adequate  electricity  generated  by  Takhiatash  TPP  is \nevacuated to meet increased demand and enable economically efficient operation of the power \nplant.  The  improved  power  supply  will  stimulate  new  economic  activities,  alleviate  regional \ndisparities, and support inclusive and sustainable economic development. \n \n9. \nThe  project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Uzbekistan,  which \nincludes a focus on energy efficiency and the reliable supply of power.10 It is also consistent with \nADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 and ADB\u2019s Energy Policy.11 \n \n10. \nADB  is  actively  involved  in  a  dialogue  with  the  government  to  promote  energy  sector \nreform  and  development,  capacity  building,  and  good  governance.  In  2012,  the  power  sector \nregional  master  plan  was  prepared  under  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation \nprogram,  which  identifies  investment  priorities  and  a  development  plan.  Knowledge  solutions \nand  capacity  development  of  energy  enterprises  such  as  planning,  procurement,  asset \nmanagement,  financial  management,  and  project  management,  are  ongoing  with  satisfactory \nprogress. This project will be the sixth ADB project loan to Uzbekistan\u2019s power sector, and will \ncomplement ongoing ADB interventions.12 \n   \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe project\u2019s impact will be adequate and reliable power supply in Uzbekistan by 2023. \n11. \nThe  outcome  will  be  an  expanded  and  modernized  high-voltage  transmission  grid  in \nKarakalpakstan and Khorezm regions.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \n\nThe project outputs consist of the following components: \n(i)  Strengthening  of  the  northwest  region  power  transmission  network. \nline  between \nConstruction  of  220  kV  single-circuit  overhead \nTakhiatash  TPP  and  Khorezm  substation    (197.4  km),  and  between  Khorezm \nsubstation and Ellikkala substation (166.1 km) totaling 364 km. \n\ntransmission \n\n(ii)  Expansion, \n\nrehabilitation  and/or  construction  of \n\nthree  substations. \nComprising  (a)  rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  220/110  kV  open  switchyards  at \nTakhiatash  TPP,  (b)  rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  220/110  kV  Khorezm \nsubstation; and (c) construction of a 500/220 kV Ellikkala substation.  \n\n(iii)  Support for institutional development and capacity building.

The PMU  will be supported by  a project management and \nsupervision consultant financed through the ADB loan. \n \n18. \nThe  equipment  and  materials  for  the  project  will  be  financed  by  ADB  (excluding  taxes \nand  duties)  and  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding,  in  accordance  with  ADB's \n\n                                                \n13  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nProcurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  expedite  project \nimplementation,  advance  contracting  will  be  used  for  project  supervision  and  management \nconsultants. Construction activities will be entirely financed by Uzbekenergo and carried out by \ncontractors to be selected and engaged by Uzbekenergo under the applicable Uzbek laws and \nregulations  relating  to  procurement  and  contract  management.  Project  supervision  and \nmanagement will be contracted to a consulting firm, which will support Uzbekenergo in carrying \nout  procurement,  implementation,  management,  quality  control,  and  project  supervision  and \nmonitoring.  The  project  supervision  consulting  firm  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  advance \naction for  recruitment  of  consulting  firm  is  underway.  The  consultancy  service  for  the  external \nauditing  firm  will  be  selected  using  consultants\u2019  qualification  selection  method  because  (i)  the \nauditing is a small assignment, (ii) the auditing is a highly specialized service and the number of \nqualified auditors is limited, and (iii) the assignment is a short-term and on an intermittent basis. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n19. \nTechnical  design is  aligned  with  international  practices  and complies with  Uzbekistan\u2019s \ncurrently applicable standards and state technical design code. According to best international \npractice,  galvanized  tower  structures  will  be  used  as  this  treatment  significantly  prolongs  the \nuseful  life  of  the  structures;  galvanized  steel  structures  are  especially  desirable  in  areas  with \nmajor industrial pollution, salt or elevated moisture. Along the entire length of the transmission, \noptic  24-fiber  ground  wire  will  be  installed.  The  solutions  are  technically  sound  and  cost-\neffective  compared  to  the  alternatives.  Uzbekenergo  has  necessary  technical  capacity  and \nexperienced  staff  to  operate  and  maintain  the  transmission  network  with  the  support  from \nexternal consultants. Criteria and methodology are similar to the  international practice and are \nstrictly implemented under the established internal procedures and technical standards.  \n \n20. \nThe current analytical programs and tools for transmission system planning and analysis \nused  by  Uzbekenergo  are  obsolete  and  inefficient,  and  not  formally  supported  by  the  original \ndesigners.  Uzbekenergo  also  lacks  computerized  systems  for  managing  work,  maintenance, \nand assets. Substation and line maintenance has been organized in a fairly traditional and same \nmanner for decades. Information on transmission assets is kept in a variety of different formats \nand  is  in  very  poor  condition.  A  modern  transmission  planning  system (including  software  and \ntraining)  and  computerized  asset  management  system  (including  software,  database, \napplication servers, and training) will be established in Uzbekenergo. These systems represent \nmajor technological changes to improve the operational efficiency of the company.14   \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nThe project is financially and economically viable. The financial internal rate of return is \n5.5%, which compares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital of 0.4%. The project \nwill generate financial revenues to Uzbekenergo from the additional sale of electricity, reduced \ntechnical losses, and reduced maintenance costs.  \n  \n22. \nThe  economic  benefits  consist  of  a  reduction  in  energy  not  served  in  the  region,  a \nreduction in transmission losses, and a reduction in maintenance costs. In addition, some non-\n\n                                                \n14 Details  of  the  transmission  system  planning  system  and  computerized  asset  management  systems  are  in  the \n\nTechnical Due Diligence Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fincremental benefits arise from reduced reliance on back-up generation sources. The sensitivity \nanalysis  suggests  sufficient  robustness  of  the  project  under  all  tested  assumptions.  The \neconomic internal rate of return is 18.1%, which is greater than the economic opportunity cost of \ncapital of 12%.  \n \nUzbekenergo  has  operated  profitably  since  2008.15 The  gross  profit  margin  has  been \n23. \nabove 10% throughout the period, but decreased from 35.1% in 2007 to 16.9% in 2013, largely \ndue  to  the  increasing  cost  of  maintaining  aging  facilities.  However,  low  fuel  costs 16  and \nsemiannual  tariff  adjustments  to  reflect  inflation  have  contributed  to  the  profitability  of \nUzbekenergo. \n \n24. \nFinancial  projections  for  2014\u20132025  indicate  that  the  financial  base  remains  stable  if \ntariff  adjustments  continue  to  be  synchronized  with  inflation  and  gas  prices.  The  ongoing \ncapacity  development  program  under  previous  projects  and \nthis  project  will  support \nUzbekenergo to sustain its profitability. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n25. \nSector  governance. The power sector is under the direct supervision of the Cabinet of \nMinisters, which prepares the energy policy and long-term investment plan in coordination with \nother relevant ministries and government agencies. The power sector investment plan for 2015\u2013\n2019  was  adopted  on  4  March  2015.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  sets  the  tariff;  the  government \nadjusted the tariff semi-annually to reflect the cost of services. Licenses are issued by the State \nInspection of Control in Power Industry under the Cabinet of Ministers. Capacity development of \nUzbekenergo including strengthening safeguards assessment capacity, bringing in modern and \ntransparent  performance  assessment,  and  upgrading  the  management  information  system  is \nunderway with ADB support under ongoing projects.17 \n \nFinancial  management. Uzbekenergo\u2019s financial management risk is considered  high, \n26. \nand  it  needs  to  strengthen  its  financial  management  capacity.  Uzbekenergo\u2019s  accounting \npolicies, procedures, and financial reporting have followed the National Accounting Standards of \nUzbekistan  and  National  Standards  on  Auditing.  However,  Uzbekenergo  has  not  fully \nconsolidated  the  financial  statements  that  cover  revenues  and  costs  of  the  core  electricity \noperations.  To  enhance  its  financial  management,  since  FY2011  Uzbekenergo  has  adopted \nexternal audit of its financial statements based on International Standards on Auditing issued by \nthe  International  Assurance  Auditing  Standards  Board.  The  external  audit  found  areas  for \nfurther improvements (e.g., in the classification methods and impairment provisions on account \nreceivables, the scope of account consolidation and the accounting system).  \n \n27. \nUzbekenergo  has  started  converting  to  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  in \nFY2012  and  plans  to  complete  full  conversion  to  cover  all  subsidiaries  for  FY2015.  Capacity \ndevelopment activities planned under other ADB loan and World Bank projects will address the \ntraining  of  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  specialists  as  well  as  the \nstrengthening of Uzbekenergo\u2019s information systems with the objective of improving its financial \nmanagement capability.  \n                                                \n15 This  is  based  on  Uzbekenergo\u2019s  unconsolidated  financial  statements;  consolidation  of  the  financial  account  is \n\nexpected to be completed for FY 2015. \n\n16  Uzbekenergo\u2019s gas price is currently 30% below the export price.  \n17  ADB.  2010.

The  procurement  capacity  was  assessed  as  high  risk. \nUzbekenergo  has  experience  with  projects  financed  by  bilateral  and  multilateral  financiers, \nincluding ADB. Despite improvements, the PMU capacity is still weak. An international firm will \nbe  recruited  as  project  management  and  supervision  consultant  to  assist  with  the  bidding \nprocess  and  contract  management. 18  ADB  (from  both  headquarters  and  the  Uzbekistan \nResident  Mission)  will  provide  the  executing  agency  with  specific  procurement  advice  and \nrecommendations during project implementation.  \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n29. \nwith  the  government  and  Uzbekenergo.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 13). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n30. \nThe  increased  efficiency  and  reliability  of  power  supply  resulting  from  the  project  will \nhave  a  positive  impact  on  economic  growth,  poverty  reduction,  and  social  services  such  as \nschools,  health  care  facilities,  and  shops,  which  will  ultimately  improve  well-being  and \ncommunity  welfare.  The  improved  energy  supply  will  have  a  positive  effect  on  business \ndevelopment  and  support  new  job  creation.  No  gender  issues  are  envisaged  during  project \nconstruction  and  implementation\u2014electricity  delivery  will  equally  benefit  households  and \nbusinesses run by women and men. \n \nE. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nEnvironmental assessment. The project is classified as category B for the environment \n31. \nunder  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  An  initial  environmental  examination  report, \nincluding  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  has  been  developed  and  was  disclosed \non the ADB website on 19 June 2015. The environmental impacts of the project are expected to \nbe  insignificant,  site-specific,  and  manageable  through  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures. \nMost  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  project  take  place  during  the  construction  of  the \ntransmission  lines,  and  expansion  and  rehabilitation  of  related  substations  and  switchyards. \nPotential environmental impacts during the construction activities include limited impacts on  (i) \nland,  hydrology,  and  soil  erosion  at  river  crossing;  (ii)  forest  ecology  due  to  tree  cutting  in  a \nforested area; (iii) air quality; (iv) noise near the Low Amu Darya Biosphere Reserve; (v) waste \ngeneration  and  disposal;  (vi)  transformer  oil  and  battery  management;  (vii)  traffic;  and  (viii) \nhealth and safety of workers and local communities. Impacts during the operational phase are \nrelated to the  electromagnetic field and  the  health  and  safety  of  operators  at  substations. The \nEMP  specifies  adequate  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  plans  to  cover  these  impacts. \nThese  measures  include  detailed  planning  of  the  structures  and  routes,  timing  of  the \nconstruction  works,  careful  planning  and  execution  of  works,  selection  of    low-emission \nequipment,  controlled  tree  cutting,  health  and  safety  training  of  the  personnel  and  informing \nlocal  residents,  and  application  of  waste  and  oil  management  practices  in  compliance  with \nnational  regulations.  The  project  supervision  and  management  consultants  will  assist \nUzbekenergo  in  supervising  the  implementation  of  the  EMP  and  further  enhancing  the \nfor \nenvironmental  management  capacity  of  Uzbekenergo,  which  has  a  Department \nEnvironmental and Social Safeguards. \n \n32. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. A land acquisition and resettlement plan \n\n                                                \n18  The consulting firm will be engaged prior to the procurement of goods and works. \n\n \n\n\f(LARP)  was  prepared  and  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  on  4  May  2015.  Nine  consultations \nwere  carried  out  with  affected  households  during  project  preparation,  and  Uzberkenergo  will \ncontinue to  engage the affected  households  until  the  LARP  is finalized  and implemented. The \nLARP  includes  an  entitlements  matrix  summarizing  all  compensation  and  assistance  provided \nunder the project, a resettlement budget and financing plan, and an implementation schedule for \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities.  The  project  will  require  permanent  and  temporary \nland acquisition for  construction  of  transmission  lines  and substations. The impact  on  affected \nhouseholds  will  not  be  significant,  because  no  household  has  more  than  8.4%  of  their  land \naffected.  Compensation  and  other  assistances  will  be  scheduled  and  paid  to  affected \nhouseholds  prior  to  commencement  of  civil  works.  The  project  supervision  and  management \nconsultants  will  assist  Uzbekenergo  in  supervising  the  implementation  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement activities.   \n \n33. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples. \nThe  project  is  not  expected  to  affect  indigenous  peoples  as  defined  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n34. \nThe  overall  assessment  of  the  project  is  medium  risk  for  procurement,  project \nmanagement,  and  financial  management.  The  integrated  benefits  from  and  impacts  of  the \nproject are expected to outweigh the cost. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized \nin Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.19  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \n\nProcurement  \nDelayed procurement and \nimplementation of civil works \nand goods contracts due to \nweak procurement capacity of \nUzbekenergo PMU staff and \nprolonged contract approval \nand registration by the \ngovernment.    \n\nProject implementation \nLimited project management \ncapacity of Uzbekenergo \nPMU staff and lacking \nexperience with contract \nmanagement \n \n\n \nAdvance contracting is adopted to recruit the project implementation \nconsultant to assist procurement. \nAn international consulting firm will be recruited to assist Uzbekenergo in \nproject implementation and strengthen procurement transparency. \n \nUzbekenergo will recruit experienced procurement specialists for the \nPMU before the bidding process. \n \nADB\u2019s staff consultant and procurement specialist will provide \nprocurement and contract management training and advice throughout \nproject implementation. \n \nLessons from previous projects will be analyzed and will be incorporated \nwith the PMU and project implementation consultant.  \nThe institutions responsible for contract registration assessment will be \ninvolved in procurement and consultant recruitment to avoid delays in \nthe contract registration required for contract effectiveness. \n \nExperienced project supervision consultants will be engaged to assist \nthe PMU on project implementation and management.   \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nRisks \nAssociated generation project \nthat has direct effects on the \nProject is delayeda  \n\nFinancial management  \nLimited financial management \ncapacity and capacity to \nprevent corrupt practices  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe government has established an Interagency Council at the Cabinet \nof Ministers to oversee and coordinate all investment projects.
