Key drivers of \nthe economic growth include significant infrastructure investments and increased private sector \noutput, as well as higher private consumption as a result of increasing per capita income.  \n \n3. \nInfrastructure  development  is  critical  to  ensuring  inclusive  growth  and  supporting \nrecovery  in  the  post-conflict  areas.  The  World  Bank  estimates  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  annual  investment \nneeds  in  infrastructure  (excluding  telecommunications)  to  be  about  $4  billion,  or  4%\u20137%  of \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP),  to  support  high  GDP  growth  until  2024.1 With  respect  to  post-\nconflict  areas,  many  people  have  limited  access  to  basic  services  that  are  readily  available  to \npeople  living  in  other  areas.  The  Government  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  10-year  policy  framework  for \neconomic  development\u2014Mahinda  Chintana:  Vision  for  the  Future\u2014was  released  in  2010  and \ntargets an 8% annual growth rate.2 The central theme of the Mahinda Chintana is that, following \nthe conflict, infrastructure will be critical in attracting investment for sustained high growth in the \nfuture. Key sectors for development have been highlighted as energy, solid waste management, \ntelecommunications, transport, and water and sanitation. \n \n4. \nInvestments  in infrastructure  are significant,  and will  need  to  be met  by both  the  public \nand  private  sectors.  Although  decreasing,  the  country\u2019s  budget  deficit  remained  elevated  at \n5.8% in 2013, mainly because the government did not raise fiscal revenues, particularly through \nmuch-needed tax  reforms.  Government  revenues  continued to  contract from 17.3%  of GDP  in \n2006 to about 12.0% in 2013.3 This is among the lowest in the world, limiting the government\u2019s \nability  to  fund  social  and  economic  development.  The  government  now  relies  on  foreign \nborrowing,  which  funds  about  50%  of  its  fiscal  deficit.  Given  these  government  funding \nconstraints,  the  Mahinda  Chintana  notes  the  need  for  diversified  sources  of  funding  for \ninfrastructure projects. It also states that expanding private sector participation and introducing \npricing policies and efficiency gains are needed to generate more self-financing investments by \nstate  enterprises,  which  is  important  to  reducing  reliance  on  debt  financing.  It  notes  that  the \nfinance sector will be the catalyst for accelerated economic growth envisaged in the future. \n \nIn  line  with  the  government\u2019s  expectations  for  the  finance  sector\u2019s  pivotal  role  in \n5. \nsupporting  economic  development,  the  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  (CBSL)  on  2  January  2014 \npublished its Road Map 2014, which was formulated with the aim of building a strong, dynamic, \n\n                                                \n1  World Bank. 2013.

IMF Country Report No. 14.285: Sri Lanka. Washington, DC. \n\n\f2 \n \n\n \n\nforeign \n\ninvestors,  (iv) \n\nand  internationally  competitive  finance  sector  with  cross-border  linkages  and  a  significant \noverseas  presence.  Sri  Lanka  has  33  banks,  many  of  which  are  small,  and  this  number  is \ndisproportionate to its small population as well  as the bank\u2013population ratio of other emerging \ncountries  in  Asia.4 However,  the  country\u2019s  banking  sector  remains  concentrated  with  six  large \nsystemically  important  banks,  including  HNB.  These  six  banks  accounted  for  about  65%  of \nsector assets at the end of 2013. The structure of the banking sector makes it more vulnerable \nto  contagion  risks  while  making  it  difficult  for  small  banks  to  achieve  economies  of  scale  and \ndiversification. Just below half the assets of the banking sector are with the public sector.  The \nmain  objectives  of  CBSL\u2019s  consolidation  plan  are  (i)  a  larger  aggregate  capital  base  for  the \nremaining institutions,5 (ii) increased potential to finance large-scale transactions, (iii) increased \ninvestments  by \nlevels  of  efficiency  and  profitability, \nimproved \n(v) availability  of  a  full  range  of  financial  services  at  affordable  costs,  and  (vi)  more  effective \nsupervision.  The  consolidation  plan  is  viewed  as  credit  positive  because  it  raises  minimum \ncapital  requirements  and  introduces  a  timeline  for  the  introduction  of  Basel  III  standards  for \nbanks, commencing in January 2015.6 In addition, CBSL has a target of five commercial banks \nreaching  a  total  asset  size  of  at  least  SLRs1  trillion.  By  increasing  scale,  these  banks  will  be \nable to access international capital markets, which is challenging for the banks, and to provide \nlarge-scale funding needs for a high growth Sri Lankan economy. \n \n6. \nADB  has  been  active  in  the  finance  sector  since  the  conflict,  providing  much-needed \nlonger-term debt to banks to support housing finance and small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs) onlending, as well as supporting trade finance through ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program.7 \nIn light of finance sector consolidation, ADB can play a significant role in the reform process and \nto  support  widening  of  access  to  finance,  particularly  in  areas  such  as  infrastructure  finance. \nMany of the upcoming infrastructure projects are small, and some involve funding to provincial \nand  quasi-government  entities.  As  such,  international  financial  institutions  (IFIs)  cannot  fund \nthese  projects  on  a  direct  basis.  To  address  the  financing  gap  for  these  small  infrastructure \nprojects,  ADB  met  with  several  banks  to  identify  suitable  financial  institutions  to  support  long-\nterm  funding.  HNB  is  the  second  largest  private  commercial  bank  and  an  established  market \nleader in the microfinance, SMEs, and infrastructure financing segments with over two decades \nof experience in lending to infrastructure projects.8 HNB has an extensive network and promotes \ninclusive  finance.  It  has  been  providing  funding  for  infrastructure  projects  since  1975  and  it  is \none  of  the  largest  funders  of  renewable  energy  projects  in  Sri  Lanka.  HNB  has  maintained  a \nrelationship  with  ADB  since  1990  as  a  lending  conduit  for  sovereign  loans  for  ADB\u2019s \ndevelopment,  infrastructure,  SME,  and  agriculture  targeted  lending  programs  in  Sri  Lanka.  It \nalso  became  a  member  of  ADB\u2019s  Trade  Finance  Program  in  2008.  As  such,  HNB  is  a  strong \ncandidate  for  long-term  funding  for  infrastructure  projects.  This  is  ADB\u2019s  first  nonsovereign \n\n                                                \n4  The banking sector comprises 24 licensed commercial banks (LCBs) and nine licensed specialized banks. As of \nthe end of 2013, LCBs accounted for 48.7% of total financial system assets and 69.9% of banking sector assets. \nThe two largest LCBs and the largest licensed specialized bank are state-owned. \n\n5  The minimum capital requirement for commercial banks will increase from SLRs5 billion in 2014 to SLRs10 billion \nfrom 1 January 2016. A minimum total asset requirement of SLRs100 billion will also apply from 1 January 2016. \nFor nonbank financial institutions, the minimum capital requirement will increase from SLRs200 million or SLRs300 \nmillion in 2014 (depending on the classification) to SLRs1 billion from 1 January 2016, with a further increase to \nSLRs1.5 billion from 1 January 2018. \n\n6  Moody\u2019s.  2014.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Trade  Finance \n\n8  HNB was awarded Bank of the Year 2013 in Sri Lanka for the second consecutive year by  the  United Kingdom-\nbased The Banker magazine, Best Managed Bank in Sri Lanka at the Asian Banker Summit 2013, and was rated \nthe sixth most valuable brand in Sri Lanka by Brand Finance Lanka (affiliated with Brand Finance UK) for 2013. \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nfinancial  institution  initiative  targeting  the  infrastructure  sector  in  Sri  Lanka,  and  supports  the \ncentral  theme  of  the  government\u2019s  policy  framework  for  economic  development,  while \ncomplementing previous initiatives that have targeted other sectors critical for economic growth \nsuch as SMEs, trade, and housing finance. \n \nB. \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n7. \nHNB commenced operations in 1888 as a specialized bank to cater to the tea industry. It \nhas evolved from a small local bank to the second largest private bank in the country. HNB has \nachieved  this  growth  both  organically  and  through  acquisitions:  it  acquired  Mercantile  Bank  in \n1974,  the  Sri  Lanka  unit  of  Emirates  Bank  International  in  1989,  and  the  Colombo  branch  of \nBanque  Indosuez  in  1996.  HNB  was  incorporated  as  a  limited  liability  and  publically  traded \ncommercial  bank  in  1970.  Its  ordinary  shares  and  unsecured  subordinated  debt  are  listed  on \nColombo Stock Exchange.9 \n \n8. \nHNB provides services through its key business segments\u2014corporate, SMEs, personal \nbanking, development banking, and microfinance. It has the largest network of all private sector \nbanks (250 branches); and its wide outreach via ATMs, internet, and mobile banking channels \nhas  helped  build  its  strong  brand.  HNB  has  made  significant  investments  in  information \ntechnology  and  its  service  delivery  platform,  and  considers  this  a  core  differentiating  factor  in \nterms of market positioning. It believes this will allow it to offer a greater number of services to \nits target market segments, as well as provide HNB with substantially greater outreach than its \ncompetitors, thereby achieving greater market penetration in the retail and SME segments. On \n1 October 2014, HNB signed an agreement to buy 51% of Prime Grameen Micro Finance. This \nacquisition, which is subject to regulatory approvals, will strengthen HNB\u2019s pioneering role in the \ndevelopment of rural Sri Lanka by expanding its microfinance operations. \n \n9. \nInfrastructure finance. As noted, HNB has been active in infrastructure financing since \n1975. It established a project finance unit in 1982, and the team has built a strong track record \nand is financing a wide range of infrastructure opportunities in the public and private sectors. It \nhas  also  acted  as  a  participating  credit  institution  in  IFI  projects  targeting  infrastructure \ndevelopment. These  include  a World  Bank  Energy  Services Delivery  Project (1997\u20132002)  and \nthe  Renewable  Energy  for  Rural  Economic  Development  Scheme  (2003\u20132008),  and  the  Post \nTsunami  Credit  Line  of  the  European  Investment  Bank.  Despite  HNB\u2019s  long  record  in \ninfrastructure  financing,  it  has  never  reported  a  loss  in  this  segment.  HNB  maintains  sound \ncredit  quality  through  careful  selection  of  projects  at  the  business  development  stage.  The \nproject  finance  team  has  its  own  technical  experts  (including  civil  engineers)  and  HNB  hires \nindependent experts to assess the technical risks for infrastructure projects. Credit management \nfor corporate borrowers, including infrastructure financing, is centralized at the head office. HNB \nmaintains  a  dedicated  infrastructure  credit  administration  cell  of  six  people  in  the  risk \nincluding \nmanagement \ndisbursement, monitoring of work completed, stage releases, and reporting. \n \n \n \n \n\nfor  overseeing  progress  on  each  project, \n\nresponsible \n\nteam, \n\n                                                \n9  All commercial banks in Sri Lanka, aside from the  two large state-owned banks, are required to  partially list their \n\nstock on Colombo Stock Exchange. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nC. \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n1. \n\nOwnership \n\n \nHNB\u2019s  two  largest  single  shareholders  are  government  entities\u2014Sri  Lanka  Insurance \n10. \nCorporation and the Employees Provident Fund.

The  deputy  general  manager  (risk  and \ncredit quality) was then promoted to chief operating officer. Members of HNB\u2019s senior executive \nmanagement  team  have  strong  academic  and  professional  backgrounds,  most  with  extensive \nbanking experience in Sri Lanka and abroad. \n \n\n3. \n\nGovernance Structure \n\n \nHNB has a sound governance structure. Its board consists of 10 directors, six of whom \n12. \nare considered independent. The former deputy governor of CBSL chairs the board. The CEO \nsits  on  the  board  as  the  only  executive  member.  The  board  members  have  a  well-balanced \nknowledge base spanning public finance, monetary policy, manufacturing, banking, investment, \nengineering, and accounting. According to the statutes of HNB, the maximum tenure for a board \nmember is 9 years (i.e., 3-year terms, with the possibility of being reelected three times) and no \nterm limits exist for the CEO. New board members are vetted by the nomination committee and \napproved by the board, with the consent of CBSL.10 \n \n\n                                                \n10 Sri Lanka was identified as a strategically deficient jurisdiction by Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards in \nFebruary  2010.  However,  during  2013,  FATF  noted  Sri Lanka\u2019s  significant  progress  in  improving  its  regime  for \ncombatting money laundering and the financing of terrorism and Sri Lanka is therefore no longer subject to FATF\u2019s \nmonitoring  process  under  its  ongoing  global  compliance  process  for  combatting  money  laundering  and  the \nfinancing of terrorism. \n\n\f \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\n5 \n\nA. \n\nThe ADB Assistance  \n\nThe assistance consists of a loan of up to $100 million comprising an A-loan of up to $75 \n13. \nmillion  and a B-loan  of up  $25 million,  with  a tenor  of  up to  7  years. The  loan  will  be  used by \nHNB  to  onlend  for  infrastructure  projects,  including  renewable  energy  projects.  Pricing  will  be \nmarket-based. A portion of the risk on the A-loan may be transferred to counterparties that are \neligible under ADB\u2019s policies.  \n \nB. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nHNB  will  provide  ADB  with  financial  reports  at  predetermined  regular  intervals  and  as \n14. \nrequested, including (i) unaudited financial statements on a quarterly basis, (ii) audited financial \nstatements on an annual basis, (iii) compliance certificates for agreed-upon financial covenants, \n(iv)  reporting  on  characteristics  of  the  infrastructure  loan  portfolio,  and  (v)  annual  reporting  on \nselected development indicators agreed between ADB and HNB. Annual reports on safeguards \nand social protection compliance will also be required. \n \nC. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance   \n\n15. \nSupporting  banking  sector  reform.  The  Sri  Lankan  finance  sector  is  undergoing \nsignificant  reform  through  a  consolidation  process,  requiring  banks  to  hold  higher  levels  of \ncapital as it moves toward Basel III implementation in the coming years. CBSL has a target of \nfive  commercial  banks  each  reaching  a  total  asset  size  of  at  least  SLRs1  trillion  to  create \ninstitutions  with enough scale to  be able to  access  international  capital markets,  which  is  very \nchallenging and expensive for the banks. In addition to the two large state-owned banks, HNB is \nexpected to be one of the remaining three institutions in this bracket. By working with one of Sri \nLanka\u2019s  leading  private  commercial  banks  through  this  process  and  providing  long-term  debt \nfinancing  and  balance  sheet  support,  ADB  has  a  unique  opportunity  to  support  reform  and \npromote  private  sector  participation  in  the  Sri  Lankan  finance  sector.  CBSL  considers  that \ninstitutions such as ADB have an important role to play by working closely with the larger banks \nas they undertake reform. \n \n16. \nGreater  access  to  finance  for  infrastructure  development. Following the end of the \ncivil  war  in  2009,  HNB  is  seeking  to  play  an  active  role  in  supporting  national  development \nthrough  the  provision  of  financing  support  for  infrastructure  development,  which  is  a  key \ndevelopment focus for the Government of Sri Lanka. HNB is one of the largest commercial bank \nlenders  to  infrastructure  projects  in  Sri  Lanka,  particularly  in  the  lesser  developed  provinces, \nincluding the Northern Province. The proposed assistance is expected to fill a much-needed gap \nfor  long-term  financing  for  infrastructure  projects  in  the  most  underdeveloped  regions  of  the \ncountry.  The  project  is  also  expected  to  catalyze  additional  sources  of  long-term  financing \nthrough potential B loan participation. \n \nAdherence  to  market  leading  standards.  ADB\u2019s  engagement  with  HNB  will  play  an \n17. \nimportant  role  in  developing  and  supporting  HNB\u2019s  adherence  to  high  corporate  governance \nstandards,  as  well  as  the  adoption  of  market  leading  risk  management,  social,  and \nenvironmental  standards\u2014thereby  enhancing  risk  management,  environmental,  and  social \nresponsibility at one of Sri Lanka\u2019s largest financial institutions. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpacts \n\n \n18. \nADB\u2019s  financing  to  HNB  is  expected  to  contribute  to  two  impacts.  First,  it  will  help \nincrease access to finance for much-needed infrastructure development in Sri Lanka. Second, it \nwill contribute to increasing the level of private credit in the banking system. These impacts will \nbe reflected in (i) a rise in the ratio of private banking sector credit to GDP, and (ii) an increase \nin the share of infrastructure and construction loans to total banking sector loans. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n19. \nADB\u2019s  funding  will  support  HNB\u2019s  infrastructure  portfolio  to  grow  sustainably.  Key \nperformance indicators include (i) growth in HNB\u2019s infrastructure portfolio, and (ii) maintenance \nof sound asset quality. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  outputs  of  the  project  are  (i)  increased  infrastructure  finance,  and  (ii)  an \n20. \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguards  system.  The  debt  financing  will  result  in  HNB  having \nadditional financial resources for infrastructure project development. \n \nB. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n21. \nFinance  sector  development  and  infrastructure  development  are  two  of  the  five  core \nspecializations  under  Strategy  2020 11  and  its  midterm  review  where  ADB  will  focus  its \noperations  and  best  support  its  agenda.12 ADB  aims  to  strengthen  its  support  to  the  finance \nsector at the regional and national levels by helping develop financial infrastructure, institutions, \nand  delivery  of  products  and  services  to  promote  inclusive  growth.  Through  such  initiatives, \nADB will continue to assist in channeling funding into the most productive investments, as well \nas  continue  to  build  the  capacity  of  financial  institutions  by  introducing  international  best \npractices. The project supports institutional and finance sector development and the deepening \nof  the  finance  sector  by  increasing  the  capacity  of  a  sound  commercial  bank  in  Sri  Lanka  to \nexpand  lending  for  infrastructure  development  projects.  The  proposal  is,  therefore,  consistent \nwith Strategy 2020 and its midterm review. \n \n22. \nThe  proposed  project  is  directly  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  development  policy \nframework  for  2010\u20132016,  which  aims  to  accelerate  economic  growth,  improve  access  to \nfinance,  address  inadequate  and  poor  quality  of  infrastructure  as  a  major  constraint  to  rapid \neconomic  growth,  and  increase  the  low  level  of  private  sector  investment.  ADB\u2019s  2012\u20132016 \ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  Sri  Lanka  is  built  on  the  government\u2019s  development  policy \nframework  and  Strategy  2020,  and  calls  for  ADB  support  for  private  sector  development, \nincluding  projects  that  accelerate  the  pace  of  private  sector  participation  and  promote  finance \nsector development.13 \nThe project also supports inclusive and sustainable economic growth as \noutlined  in  the  country  partnership  strategy,  as  the  project  will  contribute  to  these  objectives \n\n                                                \n11 ADB.  2008.

It is also consistent with ADB\u2019s country operations business \nplan  to  catalyze  private  investment  and  promote  inclusive  growth  in  Sri  Lanka  and  to  support \nfinance  sector  development  through  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department.14 ADB  has \nsupported  the  private  finance  sector  since  the  conflict.  It  provided  a  $15  million  senior  loan  to \nDFCC  Vardhana  Bank  in  2012  to  support  housing  finance  and  a  $15 million  senior  loan  to \nNations  Trust  Bank  in  2013  to  support  SME  finance  in  Sri  Lanka.  Eight  Sri Lankan  banks  are \nactive  in  ADB\u2019s  Trade  Finance  Program.  The  proposed  project  will  build  on  ADB\u2019s  work  and \nsupport reform efforts in the finance sector. \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE  \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nA. \n \n23. \nThe  project  is  classified  category  FI  for  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  investment\u2019s  potential  environmental  and  social \nimpacts, its risks associated with HNB\u2019s existing and likely future portfolio, and its commitment \nand capacity for environmental and social management have been assessed. HNB will not use \nthe ADB funding for onlending to infrastructure projects that are category A for impacts on the \nenvironment,  involuntary  resettlement,  or  indigenous  peoples.  Enhancements  have  been \nidentified to HNB\u2019s environmental and social management system (ESMS) for compliance with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard Policy  Statement  (2009),  and the  borrower  commits  to  establish an  updated \nESMS satisfactory to ADB before disbursement for the financing of infrastructure projects. HNB \nwill apply ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list, ensure that investments abide by applicable \nnational  laws  and  regulations,  and  comply  with  ADB  requirements.  The  ESMS  will  include \narrangements  to  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and  ADB\u2019s  social  protection  strategy 15 to \nensure  adherence  to  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards,  including  provisions \nprohibiting  discrimination  against  women  in  hiring  and  providing  equal  pay  for  equal  work  for \nmen and women. \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n24. \nHNB was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nThe  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term  country,  industry,  group,  and  single \n\n25. \ninvestment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\n26. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter),16 the Government of Sri Lanka will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to \nthe  proposed  assistance  to  HNB.
