In  addition,  technical  assistance  (TA)  will \nalso  be  provided.  The  physical  investments  will  address  current \nunserved  energy  demand  and  provide  additional  capacity  to \nmeet forecast demand growth. \n \n \nThe  Government  of \nrecognizing \nelectricity  as  one  of  the  key  drivers  for  economic  growth  and \npoverty reduction, has confirmed its mission to provide electricity \nto all households at an affordable price by 2012.  \n \nIn 2006 the Government introduced the Integrated Energy Policy \nto ensure adequate and reliable energy supplies in a technically \nefficient,  economically  viable,  and  environmentally  sustainable \nmanner.  Specific  measures  of  the  policy  include  continuing \nrelated  power  reforms,  e.g.,  reducing  aggregated  technical  and \ncommercial  losses  of  the  state  transmission  and  distribution \n(T&D) utilities and other restructuring efforts.  \n \nThe  government  of  Assam  (GOA)  set  out  a  policy  for  power \nreforms in the Power Policy Statement 2003. Aims of the policy \ninclude  (i)  achievement  of  commercial  efficiency  and  financial \nviability  of  the  power  sector  so  that  it  will  not  require  Assam\u2019s \nfor  socioeconomic \nfinancial  resources,  which  are  needed \nservices  and \ndevelopment; \n(ii) \nand \ncost-effectiveness \nadministrative \nand \n(iii)  increased  operating  efficiency  of  all  power  utilities  through \n\nimproved  delivery  of \nthrough \nrestructuring \n\ntechnical,  managerial, \nutilities; \n\n(the  Government), \n\npower \n\nIndia \n\nof \n\n\fii \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthrough \n\ncompetition, managerial autonomy, and higher accountability.  \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  supported  Assam\u2019s  power \nreforms \nthe  Assam  Power  Sector  Development \nProgram.  The  program  comprised  a  $150  million  program  loan \n(2036-IND) and a $100 million project loan (2037-IND). In 2002, \nin  tandem  with  the  program,  Assam  State  Electricity  Board \n(ASEB),  under  the  Companies  Act  (1956),  incorporated  its \nsuccessor  entities:  Assam  Power  Generation  Corporation \nLimited  (APGCL);  Assam  Electricity  Grid  Corporation  Limited \n(AEGCL);  and  three  distribution  companies:  Central  Assam \nElectricity  Distribution  Company  Limited  (CAEDCL),  Lower \nAssam  Electricity  Distribution  Company  Limited  (LAEDCL)  and \nUpper  Assam  Electricity  Distribution  Company  Limited \n(UAEDCL).  ASEB  remains  active  as  a  coordinating  agency.  In \nApril 2009, CAEDCL and UAEDCL were merged into LAEDCL to \nenhance operating efficiency. \n \nAEGCL develops, operates, and maintains the transmission grid \nin the state; and LAEDCL develops, operates, and maintains the \ndistribution  grid.  Improvements  include  increased  T&D  circuit \nlength,  increased  T&D  capacity,  and  reduced  T&D  losses  (from \n42.5%  in  2003  to  35.0%  in  2009).  Assam's  future  peak  power \ndemand  is  forecasted  to  increase  to  1,883  megawatts  (MW)  by \n2014  with  an  annual  increase  of  14.2%.  To  meet  the  demand, \nnew  power  plants  will  be  constructed  with  sufficient  additional \ncapacity.  However,  limited  capacity  of  the  Assam  T&D  system \ncan  constrain  the  delivery  of  power  to  consumers.  Therefore, \nT&D  capacity  needs  to  be  expanded  and  system  access  and \nefficiency enhanced. \n \nPolicy  Environment.  The  Electricity  Act  (2003)  provides  a \nimplementing  reforms, \ncomprehensive \nincluding  (i)  unbundling  state  electricity  boards,  (ii)  establishing \nstate  regulators,  (iii)  licensing,  and  (iv)  developing  an  antitheft \nprovision. Certain provisions in the act have been initiated, e.g., \n(i)  open  access  to  the  T&D  network,  (ii)  recognition  of  power \ntrading  as  a  distinct  activity,  (iii)  creation  of  distribution \nfranchisees,  and  (iv)  a  minimum  procurement  requirement  by \nlicensees from renewable sources. \n \nRoad  Map.  GOA  developed  a  T&D  road  map  linked  to  the \nInvestment  Program.  The  objective  is  to  establish  the  route  to \nachieve  sustainable  T&D  growth  in  the  state.  It  aims  to  deliver \nthe  following  outcomes:  (i)  strengthened  power  transmission \ncapacity to deliver reliable and affordable electricity, (ii) improved \naccess  to  electricity,  (iii)  enhanced  efficiency  and  quality  of \npower  supply,  (iv)  ensured  financial  health  of  the  power  sector \nthrough  continued  reform,  and  (v)  mainstreamed  private  sector \nparticipation.  \n \n\nframework \n\nlegal \n\nfor \n\n\fiii \n\noffered \n\ninterbank \n\nto  ADB\u2019s \n\nThe  financing  will  be  provided  under  a  multitranche  financing \nfacility  (MFF),  in  accordance  with  ADB  policy.  The  MFF  will \nextend  multiple  loans  not  exceeding  $200  million,  in  aggregate, \nto  finance  part  of  the  costs  of  projects  under  the  Investment \nProgram. The MFF is expected to be provided in three tranches.  \n \nThe  provisions  of  the  ordinary  operations  loan  regulations \napplicable \nrate \nLondon \n(LIBOR)-based loans will apply to each loan. The specific terms \nof  each  loan  will  be  based  on  the  related  periodic  financing \nrequest (PFR) with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility.  The  Government  has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; and (ii) an undertaking that \nthese choices were made independently, and did not rely on any \ncommunication or advice from ADB.  \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  (i)  strengthen  power  transmission \ncapacity to deliver reliable and affordable electricity, (ii) improve \naccess  to  electricity  in  distribution  through  grid  electricity  and \noff-grid  renewable  and  conventional  energy-based  electricity, \n(iii)  enhance  efficiency  and  quality  of  power  supply,  (iv)  ensure \nfinancial  health  of  the  power  sector  through  continued  reform, \nand  (v)  promote  private  sector  participation.  The  Investment \nProgram  includes  a  capacity  development  program  component \nto meet the increasing management capacity requirements.  \n \nThe  MFF  is  particularly  well  suited  for  the  Investment  Program \nbecause (i) its aim is to support GOA\u2019s long-term objectives, as \nstated  in  the  T&D  road  map;  (ii)  the  performance  of  ongoing \nprojects  under  the  MFF  can  guide  the  provision  of  subsequent \nloans, thereby offering proper incentives for implementation; and \n(iii)  the  MFF  can  offer  the  flexibility  required  for  the  Investment \nProgram to support participation of the utilities at different stages \nof readiness.  \n  \nThe  Investment  Program  is  expected  to  promote  sustainable \nprovision of electricity in the state with increased T&D capacity to \nsupport inclusive economic growth.  \n \nThe outcome is enhanced quality and expanded service delivery \nof  electricity  in  Assam  through  improved  technical,  commercial, \nand financial performance and capability of ASEB and the power \nutilities.  \n \nDuring the Investment Program from 2009 to 2014, GOA intends \nto  carry  out  T&D  enhancements  valued  at  $764  million  with \nsupport from the Government, ADB, and other stakeholders.  \n \n \n \n\nMultitranche Financing \nFacility \n\n \nRationale \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nInvestment Plan  \n\n \n\n\fiv \n \n\n \nFinancing Plan  \n\n \nFramework Financing \nAgreement and Periodic \nFinancing Requests \n\n \nTranches  \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nComponent \nTransmission \nDistribution \nDistributed Decentralized \nGeneration \nCapacity Development a \nTotal \n \n\n \n\nInvestment Plan \n($ million) \n \nInvestment \nProgram \n561.6 \n150.0 \n50.0 \n\nMFF- \nRelated \nProjects \n237.0 \n75.2 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nTranche 1 \n92.6 \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4 \n95.0 \n\n \nMFF = multi-tranche financing facility \n\u00aa The Investment Program does not include the Technical Assistance.  \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n2.4 \n764.0 \n\n2.4 \n314.6 \n\n \n\n \n\n              Indicative Financing Plan  \n\n                             ($ million) \n\nSource  \n\nAsian Development Bank \nWorld Bank  a \nGovernment of Assam  \nPrivate Sector \nTotal \n \n\nInvestment \nProgram \n200.0 \n360.0 \n154.0 \n50.0 \n764.0 \n\nMFF- Related \nProjects \n200.0 \n \n114.6 \n \n314.6 \n\nTranche1 \n\n60.3 \n\n34.7 \n\n95.0 \n\n \n\n \n\nMFF = multi-tranche financing facility \n\u00aa  $764.0  million  includes  the  investment  for  the  Assam  portion  under  the \nGovernment's  composite  scheme  of  development  of \ntransmission  and \ndistribution  network  in  NER.  Part  of  this  has  been  proposed  for  World  Bank \nfunding amounting to $360 million for Assam. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nThe  Government  has  entered  into  a  framework  financing \nagreement (FFA) with ADB to access the MFF.  \n \nBefore ADB accepts a PFR under the Facility, the Government, \nGOA, ASEB and power sector utilities will ensure full compliance \nwith  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  FFA.  ADB  teams  will \nevaluate  the  PFRs  for  purposes  of  acceptance  and  processing. \nADB  teams  will  provide  ongoing  guidance  to  the  Government \nand GOA. ADB staff will inform the Government, and report to its \nManagement  and  the  Board  on  the  status  of  individual  loans. \nFailure  to  comply  with  any  of  these  could  hold  back  financing \nunder the MFF. \n \n \nThe MFF is expected to be utilized in three tranches. Tranche 1 \nwill  finance  a  set  of  projects  for  (i)  transmission  of  power  for \ncapacity addition in transmission lines of 220 kilovolts (kV) (180 \nkilometers  [km])  and  132  kV  (82  km),  and  capacity  addition  of \ntransformation  through  construction  of  1  new  220/132  kV \nsubstation  and  5  new  132/33  kV  substations;  and  (ii)  extension \nand  augmentation  of  2  existing  substations.  The  tranche  will \ninclude capacity development.   \n \nTranche  2 \n\nfinance  a  set  of  projects \n\nis  expected \n\nfor \n\nto \n\n\fv \n\ninterest \n\nrate  determined \n\n(i)  transmission  of  power  for  capacity  addition  in  transmission \nlines  of  220  kV  (185  km)  and  132  kV  (160  km),  and  capacity \naddition of transformation through construction of 2 new 220/132 \nkV  substations  and  6  new  132/33  kV  substations;  and  (ii) \nextension and augmentation of 11 substations.  \n \nTranche 3 is expected to finance a set of projects for (i) access \nto  power  in  distribution,  (ii)  energy  efficiency  enhancement: \ndistribution  loss  reduction,  and  (iii)  distribution  franchising.  This \ncomponent  includes  construction  of  new  distribution  substations \nand lines to enable the rollout of relevant franchising models. \n \nASEB  has  submitted  the  first  PFR  to  ADB  for  $60.3  million  for \ntranche 1. This will cover payments from 2009 to 2014 related to \nconstruction of new transmission substations and lines, and loss \nreduction;  as  well  as  capacity  development  with  consulting \nservices.  The  PFR  is  presented  to  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors \ntogether  with  this  document  and  the  FFA.  The  loan  will  have  a \nterm of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years. It will have \nan \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nyear, and such other terms and conditions as agreed in the loan \nand project agreements.  \n \nDisbursements under each loan will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime),  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  by \nthe \nGovernment and GOA.  \n \nFor  each  project,  advance  contracting \nfor \nprocurement  of  equipment  and  civil  works,  and  recruitment  of \nconsultants,  subject  to  these  being  eligible  according  to  agreed \nprocedures,  and  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time)  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \nRetroactive  financing  is  proposed  under  the  individual  loans  for \nexpenditures incurred up to 12 months prior to the signing of the \ncorresponding  loan  agreement,  with  a  ceiling  up  to  20%  of  the \nloan  amount.  The  Government  and  GOA  were  informed  that \napproval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  does \nnot commit ADB to financing any of the proposed projects. \n \nThe availability period will end on 30 June 2015, the date of the \nlast disbursement under the MFF for any tranche.  \n \nGOA  and  ASEB  will  be  the  executing  agencies  with  overall \nresponsibility for execution of projects under the MFF. \n \nAEGCL  will  be \nfor \nday-to-day  implementation  of  projects  for  transmission  systems, \n\nImplementing  Agency  responsible \n\nis  proposed \n\nthe \n\n \nFirst Periodic Financing \nRequest \n\n \nDisbursement \n\n \nAdvance Contracting and \nRetroactive Financing \n\n \nAvailability Period for the \nMFF \n \nExecuting Agencies \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n\fvi \n \n\n \n\nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nMFF Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n \n\nand  LAEDCL  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  distribution \nsystems. The project management unit (PMU) established under \nASEB  for  the  previous  ADB-supported  loan  (Loan  2037-IND: \nAssam Power Sector Development Program \u2013 Project Loan), will \nremain  in  place  for  the  proposed  projects  under  the  MFF.  The \nPMU  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  coordination  and \nadministration of the projects. \n \nGoods,  equipment,  and  civil  works  to  be  financed  under  each \nloan  of  the  MFF  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) in \naccordance with the related procurement plan. \n \nConsulting  services  will  be  required  to  provide  AEGCL  and \nLAEDCL  with  support  for  project  implementation,  including \ndesign, supervision of construction, and management of projects \nunder  each  loan  of  the  MFF.  Consultants  will  be  selected  and \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time) in accordance \nwith the related procurement plan. \n \nOverall  the  MFF  will  contribute  to  state  economic  development \non  several  fronts.  The  first  group  of  beneficiaries  will  be  local \nelectricity  consumers,  including  around  1  million  electrified \nhouseholds;  small-  and  medium-sized  businesses,  e.g.,  silk \nfactories;  hospitals;  and  schools.  The  second  group  of \nbeneficiaries includes all existing electricity consumers including \ndomestic users (51%), commercial users (10%), industrial users \n(27%),  agricultural  users  (2%),  and  others  (10%).  They  will \nbenefit  from  the  enhanced  power  operations.  Through  the \ndistribution \nfranchising  component,  720  entrepreneurs  are \nexpected  to  expand  their  operations  with  at  least  1,500  new \ninfrastructure  and \nemployees. \ninstallation  of  information  and  communication  technologies  are \nexpected  to  create  at  least  500  jobs.  The  renewable  energy \ndevelopment component will provide a benefit for 2,100 villages \nwith  off-grid  renewable  energy  in  the  long  term.  Assam  has  a \nvery  high  incidence  of  poverty.  About  89%  of  the  state\u2019s \npopulation  lives  in  rural  areas,  and  approximately  60%  of  rural \nhouseholds  are \nline.  The  rural \nelectrification  component  will  have  a  direct  benefit  for  the  poor. \nThe Investment Program will rationalize tariffs as well as improve \nthe financial viability of the state\u2019s power industry. \n \nthe  sector  assistance  program  evaluation \nConsistent  with \n(SAPE)  recommendations,  ASEB  will  continue \nto  receive \nconsulting support from a TA (the TA) attached to the investment \nprogram  for  capacity  development  of  APGCL,  AEGCL,  and \nLAEDCL to enhance general institutional capacity in the areas of \ncorporate management, human resource management, financial \nmanagement,  distribution  franchising,  and  renewable  energy \n\nIn  addition,  construction  of \n\nliving  below \n\nthe  poverty \n\n\f \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nvii \n\ndevelopment. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.3 million \nequivalent.  ADB  will  provide  technical  assistance  not  exceeding \nthe equivalent of $1.0 million. This will be financed by ADB, on a \ngrant  basis,  from  the  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  TASF-Others. \nThe Government will provide the remaining balance equivalent of \n$300,000. ASEB will be the Executing Agency for the TA.  \n \nThe  key  assumption  is  that  GOA  will  remain  committed  to  the \nInvestment Program and the power reforms with the objective of \nproviding  power  for  all.  Other  important  assumptions  include \n(i) an adequate number of competent staff is available for ASEB, \nAEGCL,  and  LAEDCL;  (ii)  load  growth  in  Assam  continues  as \nprojected;  (iii)  regulatory  mechanisms  and  interventions  are \nconsistent; and (iv) the TA is successfully implemented.   \n \nRisks  include  (i)  an  increase  in  the  price  of  materials,  and  (ii) \nfailure  to  meet  safeguard  requirements  in  a  timely  manner. \nThese  risks  all  appear  to  be  low.  The  MFF  is  properly  planned \nand  sequenced  with  regard  to  the  associated  generation  plan. \nSensitivity  analyses  of  the  MFF  indicate  that  it  is  resilient  to \nincreases in capital costs, and operation and maintenance costs. \nTechnical  capability  of  the  implementing  agencies  to  implement \nthe  MFF  in  a  timely  manner  and  in  full  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \nsafeguard policies is proven.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to  India  for  the  Assam  Power  Sector  Enhancement \nInvestment  Program.  The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (the  TA)  for \ncapacity  development  of  the  Assam  power  sector  utilities,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed MFF, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nIndia\u2019s economy has grown by 8% per annum in recent years, and faces rapidly growing \nenergy needs. Addressing the energy challenge is essential for fostering sustainable economic \ngrowth and reducing poverty. Taking into account India\u2019s energy security concerns, in 2006 the \nGovernment  of  India  (the  Government)  developed  the  Integrated  Energy  Policy 1 to  ensure \nadequate  and  reliable  energy  supplies  in  a  technically  efficient,  economically  viable,  and \nenvironmentally sustainable manner. Specific measures include continuing related power sector \nreforms,  e.g.,  reducing  technical  and  commercial  losses  of  the  state  transmission  and \ndistribution (T&D) utilities and other restructuring efforts.   \n \n3. \nGiven the sub-optimal performance of state electricity boards and their negative impact \non efficient and effective delivery of power services to consumers, the Government adopted a \nprogram  of  unbundling  and  financial  restructuring  of  the  boards  in  the  late  1990s.  An \nindependent  central  regulatory  body  was  established,  and  the  formation  of  state  regulatory \nbodies was made mandatory. The Electricity Act (2003) was intended to improve sector through \ncontinued  institutional  restructuring  and  improved  management  of  sector  entities  to  ensure  \nlong-term sustainability. Compulsory metering, open access to transmission systems, facilitation \nof  power  trading,  and  tariff  rationalization  were  initiated.  Separation  of  transmission  from  the \ntrading  function  was  made  obligatory.  Most  states  have  now  segregated  generation, \ntransmission,  and  distribution  functions.  The  Central  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  and \nstate electricity regulatory commissions have prescribed detailed tariff methodologies.  \n \n4. \nAt  state  level,  the  government  of  Assam  (GOA)  introduced  the  power  sector  reform \npolicy, Power Policy Statement 2003, aiming to  (i) achieve commercial efficiency and financial \nviability of the power sector so that it does not require Assam\u2019s financial resources, which are \nneeded for socioeconomic development; (ii) improve delivery of services and cost-effectiveness \nthrough  technical,  managerial,  and  administrative  restructuring  of  power  utilities;  (iii)  increase \nthe operating efficiency of all the power utilities through competition, managerial autonomy, and \nhigher accountability; and (iv) create an environment that attracts private capital, both domestic \nand foreign, to supplement public sector investment.

Unbundling  of  ASEB  resulted  in \nformation  of  Assam  Power  Generation  Corporation  Limited  (APGCL);  Assam  Electricity  Grid \nCorporation  Limited  (AEGCL);  and  three  distribution  companies:  Central  Assam  Electricity \nDistribution  Company  Limited  (CAEDCL),  Lower  Assam  Electricity  Distribution  Company \nLimited  (LAEDCL),  and  Upper  Assam  Electricity  Distribution  Company  Limited  (UAEDCL). 3 \nASEB remains active as a coordinating agency. GOA also implemented a financial restructuring \nplan (FRP) for debt restructuring. The APSDP provided transitional support to enable the newly \nformed utilities to commence operations with a clean balance sheet, and contributed to capacity \ndevelopment  of  the  Assam  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  (AERC)  to  enhance  sector \ngovernance.  Through  physical  capacity  expansion,  the  APSDP  project  loan  contributed  to  the \nsignificant  reduction  of  T&D  losses  from  42.5%  in  2003  to  35.0%  in  2008;  the  installation  of \ntamper-proof  boxes,  and \n370,000  units  of \nimprovement of village electrification. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nintelligent  and  downloadable  meters  with \n\n1. \n\nPower Transmission \n\n6. \nOver the last decade, peak unrestricted electricity demand in Assam increased by 44% \nfrom  587  megawatts  (MW)  in  1999  to  848  MW  in  2008.  The  APSDP  contributed  to  reducing \nserious peak power shortages from 18% to 10% during this period (Table 1).     \n\n \n\n \n \n\n    \n\n2000 \n636 \n505 \n30 \n\n2008 \n848 \n766 \n10 \n\n2009 \n969  \n912 \n6 \n\n2013 \n1,649 \n1,616 \n2 \n\n2014 \n1,883 \n1,883 \n0 \n\n  1999 \n587 \n482 \n18 \n\nTable 1: Demand Growth and Shortfall, 1999\u20132014 \n2011 \n2004 \n1,264 \n738 \n1,213 \n635 \n4 \n14 \n\nItem \nUnrestricted demand (MW) \nRestricted demand (MW) \n% Shortfall \nMW = megawatt. \nSources: Data from 2001\u20132008: Central Electricity Authority Assam power sector reports and Electric Power Survey \nprojections from 2009 are Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n7. \nAssam's peak power demand is forecasted to grow to 1,883 MW by 2014 with an annual \nincrease  of  14.2%.  To  meet  the  rapid  growth,  new  power  plants  will  be  constructed  and \ncommissioned by 2014 with sufficient additional capacity.  \n \n8. \nWhile generation capacity is expected to soon catch up with expected demand, limited \ncapacity  of  the  Assam  state  T&D  system  can  continue  to  constrain  delivery  of  power  to \nconsumers.  For  example,  a  serious  bottleneck  of  38  MW  from  Lakwa  natural  gas  and  heat \nrecovery power plant to Guwahati (capital of Assam) prevents full operation of the clean power \nplant  at  peak  hours.  The  current  physical  constraints  in  the  transmission  system  mean  that \nAssam  residents  are  unable  to  fully  access  clean  power,  missing  the  opportunity  to  reduce \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  system  master-plan  study  indicates  an  imminent  need  for \nsignificant  investment  in  transmission  to  ensure  that  capacity  addition  in  generation  results  in \npower that is available for input into the distribution system. \n  \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nRecommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  India  for  the  Assam  Power \nSector Project. Manila (Loan 2037-IND). \n\n3   The UAEDCL and LAEDCL were merged into LAEDCL as of 1 April 2009 to enhance operating efficiency. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n \n\n2. \n\nAccess to Power and Poverty Reduction  \n\n9. \nInaccessibility to power due to distribution network constraints is a major impediment to \nAssam's  economic  growth.  The  lack  of  sufficient  and  reliable  power  is  eroding  the \ncompetitiveness of the state\u2019s manufacturing and agriculture industries, impacting food security, \nand  preventing  the  state  from  accessing  industrial  and  commercial  investments.  Improved \npower supply at a reasonable cost is, therefore, essential to boost the state economy and lead \nto  overall  poverty  reduction.  More  importantly,  access  to  power  directly  addresses  poverty \nreduction  for  households.  Per  capita  annual  electricity  consumption  for  Assam  is  170  \nkilowatt-hours,  only  27%  of  the  national  average.  Per  capita  income  in  the  state  is  $355,  less \nthan two thirds of the national average. A very high proportion of the population is in rural (89%) \nand  approximately  30%  of  households  are  living  below  the  poverty  line,  compared  to  the \nnational average of 26%. Access to electricity in rural areas is crucial for human development. \nGOA, therefore, is highly committed to promoting rural electrification.  \n \n10.  GOA has a target of 100% village electrification by 2010, and 100% electricity access to \nhouseholds  by  2012.  Under  the  APSDP,  village  electrification  improved  from  58%  in  2003  to \n77% in 2008, and household electrification from 17% in 2003 to 22% in 2008. Therefore, new \ninvestments in distribution must be targeted to expand the rural distribution system. In addition, \n2,145  remote  villages  in  Assam  cannot  be  electrified  through  the  grid. GOA  has  a  strategy  to \nelectrify  these  villages  by  installing  off-grid  generation  including  renewable  and  conventional \nenergy.   \n\n3. \n\nTransmission and Distribution Loss Reduction   \n\n11. \nOne  of  the  major  outcomes  of  the  APSDP  was  significant  aggregate  technical  and \ncommercial (ATC) loss reduction from 42.5% in 2003 to 35.0% in 2008. Transmission loss was \nreduced  from  9.0%  to  6.0%,  and  distribution  technical  loss  from  18.0%  to  12.5%;  both \ncontributed  to  reducing  annual  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  0.48  million  tons  carbon  dioxide  \n(t-CO2) equivalent. However, current ATC loss is still higher than the national average of 28%. \nEnergy efficiency must be enhanced if the Government's target of 15% ATC loss is to be met.  \n \nThe distribution network in Assam is characterized by overloaded transformers and long \n12. \ndistribution  feeders,  thereby  increasing  distribution  losses  to  55%\u201360%  in  some  areas.  The \nchallenge  for  the  T&D  systems  is  the  inadequate  infrastructure  and  capabilities  to  accurately \nmeasure  and  monitor  losses  at  each  point.  Furthermore,  while  many  distribution  transformers \nare metered, micro energy accounting is not possible because of the lack of consumer indexing \nand  linkage  with  the  distribution  transformers.  Under  the  APSDP,  370,000  units  of  intelligent \nand  downloadable  meters  with  tamper-proof  boxes  were  installed  across  the  state.  However, \nthe magnitude of the impact of such meter replacement has been limited as meter reading is still \nundertaken  manually.  Also,  certain  special  features  of  these  meters  that  can  reduce  human \ninterference  in  meter  reading  have  not  been  fully  activated  because  of  the  absence  of \ninformation  technology  systems  in  distribution  utilities.  Addressing  such  capacity  and  training \nrequirements in distribution utilities will have a significant impact on commercial loss reduction. \n \n\n4. \n\nSector and Corporate Governance    \n\n13. \nCognizant of weak sector and corporate governance, GOA initiated power sector reform \nin 2001 in tandem with the APSDP. This resulted in tangible outcomes, i.e., (i) enhanced legal, \npolicy, and regulatory framework; and (ii) unbundling of ASEB.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n4 \n \n \n \nLegal, Policy, and Regulatory Framework. Throughout the reform process, AERC, an \n14. \nindependent  state  regulatory  agency  formed  in  2001,  has  adopted  a  realistic  and  supportive \nposition through its regulatory initiatives, e.g., (i) notification of the terms and conditions of the \ntariff in 2005, (ii) issuance of regularly updated tariff orders for the utilities attempting to focus on \ncost-recovery  aspects,  and  (iii)  notification  of  standards  of  performance  for  T&D  licensees  in \n2004. In 2009, AERC initiated multiyear tariff proceedings to enhance efficiency improvements \nand predictability in cost and tariff setting.  \n \nUnbundling of Assam State Electricity Board. In 2002, ASEB, under the Companies \n15. \nAct (1956), incorporated the successor entities: APGCL, AEGCL, and three distribution utilities. \nThrough  the  transfer  scheme,  the  existing  assets  of  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution \nwere transferred to these utilities. ASEB remains active as a coordinating agency. Despite the \nphysical  unbundling,  institutional,  managerial,  and  financial  sustainability  is  undermined  by \nlimited corporate governance of the successor entities (Figure 1). Due to this constraint, ASEB \nis  responsible \nfinancial  and  human  resource \nmanagement.  Capacity  development  is  required  for  the  unbundled  structure  to  be  fully \noperationalized.  \n \n \n\nfor  centralized  corporate  strategy,  and \n\nFigure 1: Unbundling of Assam State Electricity Board \n\nStage 1 (Pre 2003)\n\nStage 2 (2009)\n\nStage 3 \n\n \n\nASEB (Coordinating Agency)\nGeneration \nTransmission\nDistribution\n\n \n\n \n\nGeneration \nTransmission\nDistribution\n\nCompany separation completed\nSeveral functions supported by ASEB\n\nCompany separation exists\nUtilities responsible for own functions\n\nObservations\nLong, medium, and short term power procurement and trading undertaken by ASEB\nInvestment planning, studies for access, and efficiency improvement needs ASEB support \nUtilities are responsible for this function\nCash management, budgeting, and investment management undertaken by ASEB\nOfficer recruitment, training, promotions, and appraisals undertaken by ASEB\nDecisions on regulatory directives, compliance taken with ASEB support\nDecision on SPSS rollout, SPSS management, PPP models with ASEB support\nUtilities are responsible for this function\n\n \n\n   \n \n  Utilities largely supported by ASEB\n  Largely managed by successor utilities\n \n\n \n\nASEB = Assam State Electricity Board; HR = Human Resources; PPP = public private partnership; SPSS = single \npoint power supply \n\nSource(s):  Annual reports of Assam State Electricity Board. \n\n16. \nFinancial  Restructuring  Plan.  Achieving  financial  sustainability  of  the  sector  is  a  key \nobjective of GOA's power sector reforms. Prior to unbundling, ASEB\u2019s high-cost structure, e.g., \nsub-optimal billing and collection, significantly undermined its financial health. Chronic defaults \non  payments  to  most  of  its  creditors  and  suppliers  resulted  in  a  large  burden  of  accumulated \ndebts.  To  restore  the  financial  viability  of  the  power  sector,  GOA  initiated  a  financial \nrestructuring  plan  (FRP)  in  2003,  focusing  on  debt  restructuring  and  transitional  financial \n\n \n\n \nASEB\n\nGeneration\nTransmission\nDistribution\n\nUnbundled Entity \nAll functions carried out by ASEB\n \n\nKey Transmission and\n Distribution Functions \nPower Procurement\n Investment Planning\nOperation and Maintenance\n Financial Management\n HR Management\nRegulatory Interfacing\nFranchisee Management\nCustomer Service\n\n \nLegend:\n     Function completely managed by ASEB\n     Partially managed by successor utilities\n     Managed completely by successor utilities\n\n   \n\n\f5 \n \n\nsupport to enable the new companies to start with a clean slate. The FRP indicated that ASEB \nwould  require  transitional  support  to  meet  a  projected  shortfall  of  Rs2.71  billion.  The  FRP \ninvolved a total restructuring adjustment of Rs45.6 billion, comprising a noncash settlement of \nRs34.0  billion  and  Rs11.6  billion  for  liabilities  involving  cash  settlement.  Supported  by  the \nAPSDP, GOA successfully completed the FRP in 2008.  \n\n17.  With  successful  completion  of  the  FRP,  the  financial  position  of  ASEB  improved \nsignificantly. Tariffs and costs gradually converged from 2003 to 2007 resulting in cost coverage \nof 85% in 2007 (Table 2). \n \n\nTable 2: Financial Performance of Assam State Electricity Board \n\nFinancials \nTotal Revenue (Rs billion)  \nTotal Expenditure (Rs billion)  \nAverage Cost (Rs/unit) (A) \nAverage Tariff (Rs/unit) (B) \nCost Coverage (B)/(A) \nBilling Efficiency  \nCollection Efficiency  \n\n2003 \n8.35 \n12.30 \n6.27 \n3.85 \n       61% \n       64% \n       96% \n\n2004 \n8.88 \n13.20 \n6.72 \n4.23 \n       63% \n       63% \n       94% \n\n2005 \n10.13 \n11.17 \n5.63 \n4.17 \n        74% \n        65% \n        98% \n\n2006 \n10.95 \n11.85 \n5.18 \n4.46 \n\n2007 \n11.59 \n11.91 \n5.29 \n4.51 \n        86%           85% \n        67%           69% \n        97%         100% \n\n        Sources: Annual reports of Assam State Electricity Board. \n \n\n5. \n\nAssam Transmission and Distribution Sector Road Map \n\nThe  Assam  Transmission  and  Distribution  Sector  Road  Map, \n\n18. \nthe \nTransmission  and  Distribution  Sector  Investment  Program  (the  Investment  Program)  aims  to  \n(i)  strengthen  power  transmission  capacity  to  deliver  reliable,  and  affordable  electricity;  \n(ii)  improve  access  to  electricity,  e.g.,  off-grid  rural  electrification  with  appropriate  sources;  \n(iii)  enhance  efficiency  and  quality  of  power  supply;  (iv)  fully  operationalize  the  unbundled \nutilities;  and  (v)  promote  private  sector  participation  through  innovative  distribution  franchising \nmodels.  \n \n\nlinked  with \n\n6. \n\nLessons \n\nIn  2002/03,  ADB  conducted  project  performance  audits  of  energy  projects  in  India.4 \n19. \nLessons identified include (i) sector restructuring should be implemented gradually rather than \nattempting  quick  reform  through  project  covenants,  (ii)  land  acquisition  should  be  carried  out \nexpeditiously  to  minimize  implementation  delays,  and  (iii)  construction  contracts  should  be \nproperly packaged to simplify procurement and facilitate project implementation.

In particular, in Assam \nthe  SAPE  identified  specific  lessons,  for  example,  (i)  ASEB  will  continue  to  need  consulting \nsupport;  (ii)  capacities  of  the  new  companies  need  to  be  developed  in  many  areas,  including \nfinance,  information  technology,  human  resources,  and  core  engineering;  (iii)  for  utilities  with \nlimited internal capacity, such as ASEB, consultant support to help the utility utilize ADB funds \nneeds  to  be  brought  into  place  more  quickly;  (iv)  work  on  performance  improvement, \norganization  restructuring,  and  human  resource  issues  could  beneficially  be  brought  forward \nearlier  in  the  program;  and  (v)  the  Assam  experience  makes  a  clear  case  for  the  use  of \ndemonstration  projects  where  management  and  technological  changes  can  deliver  a  better \ncustomer-focused service. \n \n21. \nThese experiences are reflected in the design and preparation of the proposed MFF and \nlessons  were  incorporated  into  project  selection  and  preparation  of  procurement  packages, \nwhich  are  consistent  with  the  project  readiness  criteria  agreed  between  the  Government  and \nADB.6 Details on project readiness for the first tranche of the MFF are in Appendix 4. \n \n\n7. \n\nAsian Development Bank Strategy  \n\n22. \nADB assistance to support energy initiatives in India has six main priorities: (i) promote \nhigher  efficiency,  low-carbon  energy  sources,  cleaner  fuel,  and  renewable  energy;  (ii) expand \nand optimize T&D systems; (iii) support sector reforms; (iv) provide institutional strengthening to \nimplement reforms required by the Electricity Act, including development of more flexible power \ndelivery  and  trading  systems;  (v)  promote  private  sector  participation;  (vi)  encourage  energy \nefficiency,  energy  conservation,  and  rural  electrification;  and  (vii)  ensure  environmental  and \nsocial sustainability. ADB will continue to expand its promotion of and support for power reforms \nand intensify its efforts in states where it is already active, such as Assam, Gujarat, Himachal \nPradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttarakhand. The interventions will promote knowledge transfer \nin relation to best practices in the international power sector, improve corporate governance in \nstate-owned  utilities,  and  ensure  that  appropriate  environmental  and  social  safeguards  are \nincorporated  into  new  power  investments.  The  proposed  intervention  in  Assam  is  consistent \nwith the strategy of supporting state sector reforms, in this case with the emphasis on T&D. \n  \n\n8. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\nin \n\nfrom  various \n\nThe  power  sector \n\nIndia  has  received  assistance \n\n23. \ninternational \ndevelopment partners.

ADB  will  continue  consultation  and  coordination  with  development \npartners during project implementation.         \n \n\n                                                 \n6   The  Government  and  ADB  jointly  agree  to  follow  a  set  of  prerequisites  to  assure  smooth  implementation  of \nprojects.  Under  these  project-readiness  criteria,  ASEB  must  be  ready  to  award  at  least  30%  of  contracts \nimmediately after loan effectiveness. \n\n \n\n\f7 \n \n\n9. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n24. \nFull  Operationalization  of  the  Unbundled  Power  Utilities.  GOA  is  committed  to  full \noperationalization  of  the  unbundled  utilities:  APGCL,  AEGCL,  and  LAEDCL.  ASEB\u2019s  role  is \nexpected to cease once the utilities have a cash surplus and are sufficiently empowered to carry \nout their own corporate strategy, and financial and human resource management functions.  \n\n25. \nEnergy  Efficiency  Enhancement.  GOA  is  aware  that  energy  efficiency  potential  to \nbridge  supply  gaps,  specifically  in  distributed  and  decentralized  generation  application,  is \nsubstantially unrealized. The main sources of this potential are conservation and demand-side \nmanagement, and supply-side energy efficiency enhancement measures.  \n\nComprehensive  Governance  Measures.  ADB's  intervention  will  support  sector \n26. \nenhancement  and  corporate  governance  through  creation  of  an  efficient  and  commercially \noriented culture. In particular, ADB\u2019s capacity development component will support organization \nand  governance  efforts;  enhance  capacity  to  manage  physical  and  financial  construction \nactivities; and provide management and financial reporting to meet GOA and ADB accounting, \nasset management, and reporting requirements.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM  \n\n \n27. \nThe Investment Program will directly address sector issues based on the achievement of \nthe  APSDP,  which  has  successfully  created  the  enabling  environment  leading  to  inclusive \neconomic  growth  through  power  sector  reforms  and  physical  capacity  expansion.  The \nInvestment Program is a logical extension of the APSDP with further strengthening of the T&D \nsystem and enhancement of institutional capacity. It will require 5 years for full implementation, \nand will require flexibility in project selection to achieve overall objectives and mitigate risk. An \nMFF  is  particularly  well  suited  for  the  Investment  Program  because  (i)  its  aim  is  to  support \nGOA\u2019s  long-term  objectives,  as  stated  in  the  T&D  road  map;  (ii)  the  performance  of  ongoing \nprojects  under  the  MFF  can  guide  the  provision  of  subsequent  loans,  thereby  offering  proper \nincentives  for  implementation;  and  (iii)  an  MFF  can  offer  the  flexibility  required  for  the \nInvestment Program to support the participation of utilities at different stages of readiness.   \n \nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n28. \nThe  impact  of  the  Investment  Program  will  be  a  sustainable  state  power  sector  with \nincreased T&D capacity to support inclusive economic growth. The outcome will be enhanced \nquality and expanded service delivery of electricity through improved technical, commercial, and \nfinancial performance and capability of power utilities. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n29. \n\nThe MFF supports following outputs of the Investment Program (Appendix 5):  \n\n(i) \n\nAccess  to  power.  The  transmission  component  includes  capacity  addition  in \ntransmission  lines,  transformation  capacities,  and  a  communication  system. \nTransmission  lines  will  be  expanded  by  365  kilometers  (km)  at  220  kV  and  \n242  km  at  132  kV.  Construction  of  3  new  220/132  kV  substations  and  11  new \nincludes \n132/33  kV  substations \nconstruction  of  new  substations,  augmentation  of  existing  substations,  and \naddition  of  new  distribution  lines.  About  20  new  distribution  substations  will  be \nconstructed and 10 existing substations will be augmented.  \n\nincluded.  The  distribution  component \n\nis \n\n \n\n\f \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nEnergy  efficiency  enhancement:  T&D  loss  reduction. The transmission loss \nreduction  component  includes  replacement  of  inefficient  transformers,  circuit \nbreakers,  relays,  and \nisolators;  extension  and  augmentation  of  existing \ntransmission  substations;  and  investment  in  reactive  power  compensation.  The \ndistribution  loss  reduction  component  includes  expansion  of  the  high-voltage \ndistribution system and installation of aerial bunched cables.  \n\nthe  commercial,  minor \n\nDistribution  franchising.  Under  the  APSDP,  the  single  point  power  supply \n(SPPS)  program  for  distribution  franchising  was  developed.  Partnerships  with \ncommunity-based  private  sector  groups  and  nongovernment  organizations, \nselected  through  competitive  bidding  process,  buy  electricity  from  LAEDCL  at \nbulk import points and supply it to consumers in the franchisee areas. Under the \ninvestment,  and  operation  and \nSPPS  program, \nmaintenances  activities  are  outsourced.  The  SPPS  program  has  enhanced \npower  sector  governance  by \nincreasing  participation,  competition,  and \ntransparency; and improved sector financial viability. ADB witnessed a case that \nSPPS  had  a  positive  impact  on  poverty  reduction  through  creation  of  a  better \nworking  environment,  education,  and  health  care.  The  proposed  distribution \ncomponent  will  expand  the  franchisee  program  to  double  consumer  coverage \nwith support for (i) physical investments, e.g., last-mile distribution lines and bulk \nmetering, and (ii) nonphysical investment, e.g., training programs for franchisees \nand LAEDCL through the TA.   \n\nRenewable  energy  development.  The  distributed  decentralized  generation \n(DDG)  component  includes  consultancy  services  through  the  TA  to  identify  and \ndevelop  pilot  projects  for  off-grid  rural  electrification  with  renewable  and \nconventional  energy,  e.g.,  mini-hydropower,  biomass,  and  solar  power \ngeneration.   \n\nCapacity development. The component along with the TA includes consultancy \nservices and training programs for ASEB, APGCL, AEGCL, and LAEDCL, among \nfor  project  planning  and \nothers, \ninstitutional  capacity \nmanagement,  corporate  strategy,  and  human  and \nresource \nmanagement.  \n\nto  develop \n\nfinancial \n\ntheir \n\nC. \n\nTechnical Justification and Eligibility Criteria \n\n30. \nTransmission components form part of AEGCL\u2019s least-cost expansion plan. Its planning \nprocess  uses  investment  signals  provided  through  the  national  demand  forecast  produced  by \nthe Central Electricity Authority (CEA), and state energy and demand forecasts produced with \nthe  assistance  of  LAEDCL.  Distribution  components  were  modeled  and  analyzed using  power \nsystems analysis software. Best practice design standards and construction techniques will be \napplied to all investments.   \n \n31. \n \n\nThe following criteria will be used to select projects: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nAll projects should be economically and financially viable. \nProject  designs  will  be  consistent  with  overall  least-cost  expansion  plans; \ndesigned  on  a  least-cost  basis;  and  reflect  \u201cbest  practice\u201d  design,  construction, \nand  operation  and  maintenance  features.  Subprojects  will  display  performance-\nbased design consistent with international benchmarks for system efficiency and \noperating risk. \n\n \n\n8 \n \n \n\n \n\n\f9 \n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nProject  designs  will  be  consistent  with  the  environmental  management  plan \n(EMP), resettlement framework, and indigenous people development framework \n(IPDF).  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  and \nindigenous  people \ndevelopment plans (based on the agreed IPDF and the resettlement framework) \nwill  be  prepared  as  necessary  for  additional  projects  before  ADB  approves \nfunding. \nAll  projects  require  environmental  assessments  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002).  Category  A  projects  will  require  an  environmental \nimpact  assessment  (EIA)  and  category  B  projects  an  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE). Summaries of the EIA and IEE for category A and B-sensitive \nprojects  must  be  prepared  and  made  available  to  the  public  120  days  before  a \nperiodic  financing  request  (PFR)  is  submitted  to  ADB.  An  EMP,  with  a  budget, \nwill be prepared for each project. \n\n \nD. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n32.   Poverty  Reduction  through  Public\u2013Private  Partnership.  The  SPPS  program  in \nAssam is based on an input-based franchisee model concept where the distribution licensee is \nresponsible  for  providing  power  at  a  bulk  supply  point  and  the  franchisee  is  responsible  for \nbilling and collection from consumers (Appendix 6). The franchisee retains a pre-set margin and \npasses  on  the  remaining  collection  to  LAEDCL.  Based  on  the  success  demonstrated,  the \nfranchisee  program  would  be  expanded  to  double  consumer  coverage  through  (i)  physical \ninvestment, i.e., provision of better last-mile infrastructure by LAEDCL that could reduce losses \nand improve efficiency; and (ii) nonphysical investment, i.e., capacity development programs to \nfranchisees and LAEDCL to enhance management practices. In addition, further empowerment \nto  franchises  will  be  explored  by  feasibility  studies  and  development  of  a  second  generation \ndistribution  franchisee  model  with  (i)  more  responsibilities  for  downstream  distribution-related \nactivities,  e.g.,  capital  investment,  and  expanded  operation  and  maintenance  activities;  \n(ii) expansion of service in urban and larger areas; and (iii) development of risk-sharing models.  \n   \n33. \nOff-Grid  Rural  Electrification  mainly  with  Renewable  Energy.  Similar  to  the  SPPS \nprogram  for  grid-connected  villages,  the  model  for  off-grid  rural  electrification  mainly  with \nrenewable  energy  will  be  developed  under  the  TA.  The  Assam  Energy  Development  Agency, \nthe nodal agency for renewable energy development, identified 2,000 villages suitable for solar \nphotovoltaic  power  generation \nidentified  90  potential  \nmini-hydropower sites with total capacity of 148.5 MW and ratified the Small Hydro Power Policy \nin  2007  defining  the  project  formulation  structure  where  private  sector  groups  will  be  selected \nthrough competitive bidding processes. The TA will develop pilot-testing projects of renewable \nenergy, e.g., mini-hydropower, solar, and biomass; and structure the relevant operating model.   \n \nStrategic  System  Loss  Reduction  Program. Cognizant that the ad-hoc measures for \n34. \ntechnical  and  commercial  loss  reduction  have  been  not  effective,  a  strategic  approach  with \nadvanced information technology and communication systems will be undertaken by combining \nphysical  and  nonphysical  investment  in  tandem  with  the  national  Government\u2019s  planed \nRestructured  Accelerated  Power  Development  and  Reforms  Programme  initiative.  To  pinpoint \nthe  causes  of  system  loss  at  each  location,  an  information  technology-based  integrated \napproach  will  be  used  to  establish  baseline  data  and  information  technology  applications  for \nenergy  accounting  and  auditing.  Then,  an  optimal  solution,  e.g.,  system  improvement, \nstrengthening,  and  augmentation  of  the  distribution  infrastructure,  will  be  conducted  at  each \npoint.  \n \n\nremote  villages.  GOA  has \n\nin \n\n \n\n\f \n\n10 \n \n \n \nGreenhouse Gas Emission Intensity Reduction. The Investment Program is expected \n35. \nto  reduce  the  intensity  of  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  and  other  emissions  due  to  avoided \ngeneration via improved system efficiency.  \n \nE. \n\nProgram Investment Plan \n\n36. \nThe largest component of the Investment Program amounting to $764 million is access \nto  power  (transmission)  and  energy  efficiency  enhancement  (transmission  loss  reduction), \naccounting for $561.6 million of planned investment (73.5%). This is followed by $150.0 million \nfor  access  to  power  (distribution),  energy  efficiency  enhancement  (distribution  loss  reduction) \nand  distribution  franchising  (19.6%)  and  $50.0  million  for  distributed  decentralized  generation \nmainly  with  renewable  energy  (6.5%)  (Table  3).  The  Investment  Program  also  includes  \n$3.4  million  for  a  capacity  building  program  (including  $1.0  million  TA)  to  meet  the  sector\u2019s \nincreasing management capacity requirements.  \n \n\nTable 3: Investment Program, 2009\u20132014 \n\n($ million) \nTransmission \nDistribution \nCapacity Development a \nDistributed Decentralized Generation \nTotal \na The Investment Program does not include TA \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nInvestment \nProgram \n\nFacility \nRelated \nProjects   Tranche 1 \n92.6\n0.0\n2.4\n0.0\n95.0\n\n237.0\n75.2\n2.4\n0.0\n314.6\n\n561.6\n150.0\n2.4\n50.0\n764.0\n\n         \n\n \n\n \nF. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n37. \nThe  financing  plan  for  2009\u20132014  is  shown  in  Table  4  below.  The  Government  has \nrequested  financing  of  up  to  $200,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help \nfinance  part  of  the  Investment  Program  covering  (i)  access  to  power  and  energy  efficiency \nenhancement  in  transmission,  (ii)  access  to  power  and  energy  efficiency  enhancement  in \ndistribution  and  distribution  franchising,  (iii)  capacity  development,  and  (iv)  distributed \ndecentralized  generation.  ADB\u2019s  participation  as  a  partner  (i)  reduces  the  cost  of  funds,  (ii) \nestablishes standards in various thematic areas, and (iii) helps attract other long-term financiers \nto the sector. In addition, the TA will support, among others, renewable energy development.  \n \n\nTable 4: Financing Program, 2009\u20132014 \n\nInvestment \nProgram \n\nFacility \nRelated \nProjects   Tranche 1 \n\n($ million) \nADB \nWorld Bank a \nGovernment of Assam \nPrivate Sector \nTotal \na $764.0 million includes the investment for the Assam portion under the Government's Composite \nScheme of development of transmission and distribution in NER.

The  MFF  will  extend  loans  to  finance  a  range  of  projects  under  the \nInvestment  Program,  subject  to  the  Government  submitting  a  related  PFR  and  executing  the \nrelated loan and project agreements. Each PFR will be accompanied by a detailed cost estimate \nand an implementation schedule. The loans under the MFF will finance equipment supply and \nerection,  consulting  services,  and  other  capacity-building  activities.  The  minimum  amount  of  a \nPFR will be $50 million.  \n \n39. \nAll provisions of the ordinary operations loan regulations applicable to London interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  loans8 will  apply  to  each  loan,  subject  to  any  modifications  that \nmight be included under any loan and project agreement. The specific terms of each loan will be \nbased  on  the  related  PFR,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to \nborrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions, \nand (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in \nreliance  on  any  communication  or  advice  from  ADB.  If  the  Government  requests  any \ncofinancing  arrangements  or  related  assistance  for  projects  financed  by  the  MFF,  ADB  may \nassist  with  these,  subject  to  related  ADB  policy  and  procedures.  The  Government  will  provide \nthe proceeds of the loans under the MFF in local currency to GOA and through GOA to ASEB. \nThe Government will bear the foreign exchange risk on the loans. \n \n40. \nTranche  1  of  the  MFF  amounting  to  $60.3  million  will  finance  a  set  of  projects  that \nincludes (i) access to power (transmission) for capacity addition in transmission lines of 220 kV \n(180 km) and 132 kV (82 km), and capacity addition of transformation through construction of 1 \nnew  220/132  kV  substation  and  5  new  132/33  kV  substations;  and  (ii)  energy  efficiency \nenhancement  (loss  reduction)  for  extension  and  augmentation  of  2  existing  substations. \nTranche  1  will  also  include  a  capacity  development  component  (Appendix  7  provides  cost \nestimates and Appendix 8 the implementation schedule).   \n\n   \n\n41. \nTranche 2 of the MFF, indicative amount of $89.7 million, is expected to finance a set of \nprojects  that  includes  (i)  access  to  power  (transmission)  for  capacity  addition  in  transmission \nlines of 220 kV (185 km) and 132 kV (160 km), and capacity addition of transformation through \nconstruction of 2 new 220/132 kV substations and 6 new 132/33 kV substations; and (ii) energy \nefficiency  enhancement  (loss  reduction)  for  extension  and  augmentation  of  11  existing \nsubstations  through  14  subprojects.  Tranche  2  will  also  finance  refurbishment  of  existing \nsubstations and installation of reactive power compensation equipment of 130 MVAR (megavolt \nampere reactive).  \n \nTranche 3 of the MFF, indicative amount of 50.0 million, is expected to finance a set of \n42. \nprojects  comprising  distribution  components  for  (i)  access  to  power  (distribution),  (ii)  energy \nefficiency  enhancement  (loss  reduction),  and  (iii)  distribution  franchising.  This  component \nincludes construction of new distribution substations and lines.

GOA  and  ASEB  will  be  the  executing \nagencies  with  overall  responsibility  for  execution  of  the  MFF  and  projects  under  the  MFF. \nAEGCL  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  of \ntransmission projects, and LAEDCL will be the Implementing Agency responsible for distribution \nsystem  projects.  AEGCL  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  tranche  1  (The  AEGCL \norganization structure is presented in Appendix 9). A project management unit (PMU), headed \nby a full-time project director, established under ASEB for the APSDP project (footnote 2), will \nremain  in  place  for  the  MFF  with  responsibility  for  day-to-day  project  coordination  and \nadministration. Since the PMU staff of ASEB has substantial experience with implementing the \nprevious ADB-financed project, they are fully conversant with ADB guidelines and procedures. \nThe MFF implementation organization chart is in Appendix 10. \n \n44. \nImplementation  Period.  The  MFF  will  be  implemented  over  5  years,  including \nprocurement  and  construction  activities.  Each  specific  loan  will  have  its  own  closing  date  to \nmatch the implementation period of the project(s) funded under that loan.  \n \nProjects Management. ASEB will appraise additional projects following approval of the \n45. \nMFF. \nIt  will  also  undertake  detailed  design,  procurement,  construction  supervision, \ncommissioning,  maintenance,  and  operation  of  the  projects.  ASEB  will  liaise  with  ADB  on  a \nregular basis. The PMU will be responsible for tracking, identification, appraisal, detailed design \nand  procurement  for  additional  projects  (particularly  for  tranche  3);  and  providing  timely \nfeedback to ASEB and ADB on consequences of project delays. It will be assisted by technical \nexperts  who  will  evaluate  the  technical  reports,  feasibility  studies,  preliminary  design  reports, \nenvironmental  assessment  reports,  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  development  plans, \nand  detailed  design  reports  to  ensure  compliance  with  ADB  and  Government  requirements. \nSummary appraisal reports will be submitted to ADB, subsequent to GOA approval and required \nGovernment clearances.  \n \n46. \nPerformance  Monitoring,  Evaluation,  and  Progress  Reporting.  The  PMU,  in \ncoordination with AEGCL and LAEDCL, will establish a performance monitoring system for the \nMFF  and  for  each  project.  The  performance  reports  for  each  project  will  be  compiled  for \npreparation  of  the  MFF  performance  reporting.  Project  completion  reports  will  be  prepared  for \neach  project  within  6  months  of  project  completion,  and  an  MFF  completion  report  will  be \nprepared within 6 months of MFF completion. The PMU will prepare quarterly progress reports \nand submit these to ADB within 30 days of the end of each quarter. These reports will include  \n(i) a narrative description of progress made during the period; (ii) changes in the implementation \nschedule;  (iii)  problems  or  difficulties  encountered;  (iv)  work  to  be  carried  out  during  the  next \nperiod; (v) progress on environmental and social compliance; (vi) a report on implementation of \nthe EMPs for all environment category A projects and all environmentally sensitive category B \nprojects; and (vii) compliance with conditions of the individual loan and project agreements. The \nprogress  reports  will  include  project  expenditures  during  the  period  and  total  expenditures  to \ndate.  Performance  will  be  evaluated  on  the  basis  of  indicators  and  targets  stipulated  in  the \ndesign  and  monitoring  framework.  The  ADB  project  team  will  prepare  periodic  and  annual \nreports  to  inform  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  of  overall  progress,  and  supplemental  progress \nreports prior to management approval of individual loan agreements. \n \n47. \nReview.  ADB  will  field  an  inception  mission  within  3  months  of  the  first  loan  approval. \nADB  will  review  implementation  and  operations  based  on  the  quarterly  progress  reports  and \nmeet with ASEB and GOA semiannually to discuss implementation progress. A midterm review, \n\n \n\n\f13 \n \n\nto  be  carried  out  2  years  after  loan  effectiveness  for  each  project,  will  focus  on  engineering, \nresettlement,  and  environmental  aspects  of  the  ADB-supported  investments;  and  review  the \nfinancial status of ASEB, AEGCL, and LAEDCL. Representatives of ADB, GOA, ASEB, AEGCL, \nand  LAEDCL,  will  take  part  in  the  review.  The  review  will  allow  for  any  necessary  midcourse \ncorrections  to  ensure  successful  implementation  and  achievement  of  objectives.  For  all \nenvironment  category  A  projects  and  all  environmentally  sensitive  category  B  projects,  review \nmissions  from  the  ADB  regional  department  will  conduct  an  annual  review  of  environmental \naspects. A project completion report will be submitted within 6 months following completion of \nthe  individual  loans.  A  facility  completion  report  will  be  prepared  within  6  months  after  the \ncompletion of all ADB-supported activities and projects under the MFF. \n \n48. \nStakeholder  Participation  and  Consultation.  ASEB  and  the  implementing  agencies \nconsulted  with  stakeholders,  including  affected  communities,  during  the  design  stage.  During \nthe  preparatory  stages  of  the  tranche  1  project,  consultations  were  carried  out  with  various \nstakeholders and government officials concerned. Local communities were consulted as part of \nthe social and resettlement study to gather their views on the proposed projects under tranche \n1.  All  affected  people  were  consulted  on  a  one-to-one  basis  through  questionnaire  surveys. \nAdditionally,  focus  group  discussions  were  conducted  within  the  project  influence  areas. \nConsultations  will  continue  during  the  entire  project  cycle  according  to  a  stakeholder \nparticipation  plan.  Stakeholder  participation  and  public  consultation  will  continue  during \npreparatory work for second and/or third tranche projects. \n \n49. \nProcurement. Goods, equipment, and civil works to be financed under the MFF will be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime)  and  the  related  procurement  plan.  A  procurement  plan  for  the  projects  to  be  financed \nunder tranche 1, indicating the detailed thresholds of each procurement method, is in Appendix \n11. The procurement plan will be updated annually as required to cover the next 18 months. \n \nConsulting  Services.  Consulting  services  will  be  required  to  provide  ASEB  and  the \n50. \nimplementing  agencies  with  assistance \nincluding  design, \nfor  project \nconstruction supervision, and management of the projects under each loan of the MFF; as well \nas  ASEB's  processing  work  and  PFR  preparation  for  future  loans.  Consulting  services  will  be \nprovided  for  evaluation,  monitoring,  and  reporting  purposes.  Consultants  will  be  selected  and \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time) in accordance with the procurement plan.  \n \nDisbursement  Arrangements. Disbursements of loan proceeds under the MFF will be \n51. \nmade in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  Each  PFR  will  result  in  a  separate  loan  agreement,  which  will  describe  the  detailed \ndisbursement arrangements agreed on by the Government, GOA, ASEB, and ADB. As may be \nrequired  under  the  MFF  for  any  loan,  the  Government  may  create  an  imprest  account  in  the \nReserve  Bank  of  India,  and  may  allow  the  state  and/or  ASEB  to  create  a  second  generation \nimprest  account  to  ensure  the  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds  and  implementation.  In  such \ncases,  the  amount  in  the  imprest  account  or  the  second  generation  imprest  account  at  any \ngiven time should not exceed the amount equivalent to 6 months of estimated expenditures or \n10% of the related loan amount, whichever is less. The imprest account and second generation \nimprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. Individual payments under the statement of expenditures procedure, if \nany, for the loan will not exceed the equivalent of $100,000. \n \n\nimplementation, \n\n \n\n\f \n\n14 \n \n \n \nAdvance  Contracting  and  Retroactive  Financing.  To  expedite  implementation,  the \n52. \nGovernment,  GOA,  and  ASEB  requested  ADB  approval  to  carry  out  advance  actions  for \nprocurement  of  works  and  goods,  and  recruitment  of  consultants.  This  advance  procurement \naction  is  intended  to  be  used  for  all  tranches  of  the  MFF.  The  Government,  GOA,  and  ASEB \nalso requested retroactive financing of up to 20% of the loan amount for each tranche under the \nMFF. Accordingly advance contracting for procurement and consulting services is proposed for \nprojects  under  the  MFF.  Similarly  retroactive  financing  of  expenditures  for  the  first  and \nsubsequent  tranches  up  to  20%  of  the  proceeds  from  the  individual  loans  under  the  MFF  is \nproposed,  provided  that  those  expenditures  are  eligible  in  accordance  with  applicable  ADB \npolicies and procedures, and were incurred before effectiveness of the corresponding individual \nloan agreement, but not earlier than 12 months preceding the signing of each loan agreement. \nThe  Government,  GOA,  and  ASEB  were  informed  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  or \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance any of the proposed projects. Each PFR \nwill specify the nature of expenditure, if retroactive financing is required. The Government was \nalso informed that ADB will not finance expenditures paid by the borrower prior to effectiveness \nof  the  individual  loan  agreement,  even  if  advance  contracting  was  approved,  unless  ADB  has \napproved retroactive financing. \n \n53. \nAccounting,  Auditing,  and  Financial  Reporting.  ASEB  and  the  implementing \nagencies will maintain separate accounts for each project and for its overall operations. ASEB \nwill have such accounts (including imprest accounts) and related financial statements (balance \nsheet,  statement  of  income  and  expenses,  and  related  statements)  audited  annually,  in \naccordance  with  appropriate  auditing  standards  consistently  applied,  by  independent  auditors \nwhose qualifications, experience, and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB. ASEB and the \nimplementing  agencies  will  provide  ADB  with  certified  copies  of  such  audited  accounts  and \nfinancial  statements,  and  the  relating  report  of  the  auditors  no  later  than  6  months  after  the \nclose of the fiscal year. This will include the auditors' opinion on the use of loan proceeds, on \ncompliance with the covenants of the legal agreement(s), on the use of the imprest accounts, \nand  on  the  use  of  the  procedures  for  statement  of  expenditures.  ASEB  and  the  implementing \nagencies  will  provide  ADB  with  such  further  information  concerning  such  accounts,  financial \nstatements, and the audit as ADB will from time to time reasonably request. \n \nto  good  governance, \n54. \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  review  and  examine,  directly  or \nthrough  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to \nprojects and components under the MFF. In this regard, investigation of government officials, if \nany, would be requested by ADB to be undertaken by the Government. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended  to date) are included in \nthe loan regulations and the bidding documents for the projects under the MFF. In particular, all \ncontracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  MFF  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the \nright  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  ASEB  and  the  implementing \nagencies; and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate \nto the projects and components under the MFF. \n \n55. \nGovernance Measures. ADB\u2019s intervention will support full corporatization of the utilities \ninto  efficient,  commercially  oriented  companies.  ADB\u2019s  capacity  development  component  will \nsupport  organizational  and  governance  efforts;  and  will  enhance  capacity  of  ASEB  and  the \nutilities  to  manage  both  the  physical  and  financial  construction  activities,  and  provide \nmanagement  and  financial  reporting  to  meet  GOA  and  ADB  accounting,  asset  management, \nand  reporting  requirements.  On  managing  physical  construction  activities,  use  of  ADB \nguidelines on procurement and consulting services and standard bidding documents will provide \n\nAnticorruption  Policy.  Consistent  with \n\nits  commitment \n\n \n\n\f15 \n \n\nan  opportunity  for  better  monitoring.  Bid  specifications  and  packaging  will  ensure  maximum \ncompetition.  For  managing  financial  activities,  recruitment  of  additional  financial  management \nexperts and enhancement of internal control systems, supported with advanced information and \ncommunication  technology-based  financial  management  systems,  will  ensure  efficiency  and \naccountability.  Independent  auditors  will  audit  the  financial  statements.  Measurable  financial \nperformance  indicators  are  being  set;  AERC  will  evaluate  these.  ADB  review  missions  will \nreview accounting and control systems to monitor expenditures and other financial transactions \nof  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  and  ensure  safe  custody  of  project-financed \nassets.

Major  findings  include  (i)  executing  and  implementing  agencies  are  familiar  with \nprevious  ADB  standard  bidding  procedures  based  on  procurement  experiences  with  the \nprevious project, (ii) experience and knowledge or local procurement process for Government of \nIndia  projects  is  sufficient,  and  (iii)  only  a  limited  number  of  staff  have  the  capacity  to  handle \ninternational  procurement  for  projects  funded  by  multilateral  development  banks.  The  sector \nassistance  program  evaluation  recommends  that  (i)  ASEB  continue  to  receive  consulting \nsupport for project implementation; and (ii) the capacity of the new companies be developed in \nmany  areas,  e.g.,  finance,  information  technology,  and  human  resources.  To  address  the \nissues,  a  comprehensive  capacity  development  program  was  developed  comprising  an \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n16 \n \n \ninvestment  loan  component  of  $2,400,000  for  project-specific  support,  and  a  capacity \ndevelopment  TA,  the  Capacity  Development  for  Assam  Power  Sector  Utilities,  for  general \ninstitutional  capacity  development.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $1,300,000 \nequivalent.  ADB  will  provide  the  amount  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000.  This  will \nbe financed by ADB, on a grant basis, from the ADB\u2019s TA funding program TASF-Others. The \nGovernment  will  provide  the  remaining  balance  equivalent  of  $300,000.  The  TA  will  promote \nvarious  measures  to  strengthen  corporate  governance  and  improve  operating  efficiencies. \nASEB will be the Executing Agency for the TA.

The  assessment  was  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines9 using  the  financial \nmanagement assessment questionnaire and field interviews. Capacity development in a form of \nTA is programmed to address weaknesses identified by the financial management assessment, \nand  will  enhance  the  capacity  of  AEGCL  and  LAEDCL  to  gain  autonomy  of  cash-flow \nmanagement,  treasury,  and  corporate  strategy  functions.  To  further  empower  AEGCL  and \nLAEDCL, various initiatives are under consideration, e.g., adoption of new accounting software, \nasset registration systems, and an update of the Chart of Accounts with Companies Act.

ASEB  had  a  high  debt-equity  ratio \nimpairing  its  ability  to  obtain  competitive  financing.  Realizing  the  urgency  of  the  situation  and \ntaking inspiration from the Electricity Act (2003), GOA formulated the sector reform policy and \nset  in  place  institutional  changes,  governance  improvements,  and  a  robust  FRP  to  enable  the \nutilities  to  achieve  a  financial  turnaround.  As  the  result  of  the  FRP,  ASEB  reduced  financial \nlosses  by  82.5%  from  Rs10.9  billion  in  2005  to  Rs0.9  billion  in  2008.  The  financial \nimprovements are demonstrated by better actual results compared with those forecast in 2003 \nfor the APSDP. The debt to debt-plus-equity ratio declined from 77% in 2005 to 44% in 2008. \nDetailed analysis of sector performance is presented in Appendix 13. \n\nGuided  by  the  initiatives,  AEGCL  profitability  is  expected  to  grow,  moving  toward  the \n59. \nreturn  on  equity  ceiling  of  14%  allowed  under  the  current  regulations.  The  project  funding  will \nenable AEGCL to undertake the planned investment. Projected financial performance indicators \nimprove  over  the  forecast  period  and  show  adequate  debt  service  coverage  throughout  the \nMFF.  Self-financing  capacity  improves  toward  the  end  of  the  forecast  period.  From  2010,  the \ndebt service coverage ratio is expected to exceed 1.2 in all years, while the debt to debt-plus-\nequity ratio declines from 31% in 2009 to 17% by 2014 (Table 7).  \n\nTable 7: Assam Electricity Grid Corporation Limited Financial Projections \n\n3.0  \n\n0.3  \n\n0.2  \n\n2009 \n\n8,857 \n\n9,815 \n\n9,729 \n\n8,845 \n\n2010 \n3.9  \n\n2014 \n6.8  \n\n2013 \n6.2  \n\n2011 \n4.1  \n\n2012 \n5.3  \n\nItem \nTotal Revenue (Rs billion) \nAverage Tariff (Rs/MW/day) \nNet Profit after Tax (Rs billion) \nReturn on Average NFA (%) \nReturn on Average Equity (%) \nDSCR \nTotal Assets (Rs billion) \n2.34  \nCurrent Ratio, CA/CL \nDebt/(Debt plus Equity)  \n0.40 \nCA = current assets, CL = current liabilities, DSCR = debt service coverage ratio, MW = megawatt., NFA = Net Fixed \nAssets; Rs = rupees. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n0.60 \n9.6  \n0.79 \n0.65 \n\n1.3  \n7 \n14 \n\n1.4  \n6 \n14 \n\n1.5  \n5 \n14 \n\n2015 \n7.3  \n\n1.57  \n0.56 \n\n1.26  \n0.67 \n\n1.01  \n0.73 \n\n1.94  \n0.48 \n\n0.88  \n0.68 \n\n10,020 \n\n17 \n14 \n\n12 \n14 \n\n11 \n14 \n\n10 \n14 \n\n9,813 \n\n9,425 \n\n2.61  \n\n46.0  \n\n33.8  \n\n22.9  \n\n37.9  \n\n13.2  \n\n1.42  \n\n2.21  \n\n2.50  \n\n2.76  \n\n2.92  \n\n43.0 \n\n0.5  \n\n1.0  \n\nTable 8: Lower Assam Electricity Distribution Company Limited Financial Projections \n2015 \n61.4 \n\n2011 \n28.7 \n\n2009 \n22.4  \n5.11 \n7.35 \n0.2  \n4 \n4 \n1.12  \n\n36.3 \n\n2010 \n26.1  \n5.10 \n7.46 \n0.2  \n2 \n2 \n1.23  \n\n48.3  \n\n2012 \n34.4  \n5.73 \n7.58 \n4.0  \n\n20 \n14 \n\n4.21  \n\n64.2  \n\n2013 \n43.8  \n6.17 \n7.72 \n5.5  \n\n22 \n14 \n 5.44  \n74.4 \n\n2014 \n50.5  \n6.42 \n7.78 \n7.0 \n\n24 \n14 \n\n6.78  \n\n85.2  \n\n5.52 \n7.52 \n2.6  \n\n17 \n14 \n\n3.03  \n\n55.5  \n\n6.22 \n7.76 \n8.7 \n\n27 \n14 \n 8.40  \n97.8  \n\nItem \nTotal Revenue (Rs billion) \nAvg.

LAEDCL\u2019s  return  on  equity  will  be  positive  from 2009  onward,  with  return  on  equity \nreaching  14%  by  2011,  after  which  the  return  is  expected  to  increase  as  large  investments \nmade  during  the  MFF  are  capitalized  and  put  into  operation.  The  tariff  increase  for  full  cost \nrecovery is expected to peak after 2014 due to cost reduction efforts, while a lifeline tariff for the \nfirst 1 kilowatt-hour of consumption per household per day is kept fixed (Table 8).  \n\n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n61. \nA  financial  evaluation  of  the  transmission  projects  under  tranche  1  was  carried  out  in \n2009 prices. The project cost estimates and financial projections were converted into real terms \nby  adjusting  for  the  projected  effects  of  domestic  inflation.  Project  revenues  are  based  on  the \nmethodology applied by AERC, which is expected to be in line with the recently published 2009 \nCentral Electricity Regulatory Commission tariff regulations.  \n \n62. \nThe  base  case  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  transmission  projects  is  7.41%, \ncompared with the weighted average cost of capital of 2.10%, thus indicating financial viability. \nSensitivity analyses showed that the results are robust to a range of project-related sensitivities \ncovering increases in capital cost, operation and maintenance costs, and project implementation \ndelays. A summary of the financial analysis is in Appendix 14.  \n \n\n4. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nSocial Aspects \n\n63. \nEconomic  analysis  was  undertaken  for  the  transmission  projects  to  be  financed  under \ntranche  1  of  the  MFF.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  was  calculated  by  comparing  the \nwith-  and  without-project  scenarios.  Economic  benefits  accrue  to  consumers  in  Assam,  the \nelectricity utilities in Assam, and the overall economy.  \n \nThe  benefits  from  incremental  consumption  of  power  are  valued  using  consumers\u2019 \n64. \nwillingness to pay, while the benefits from the nonincremental consumption of power are valued \nbased on the resource cost saving from displaced generation sources. Initial estimates indicate \nthat the transmission projects under the first tranche have an economic internal rate of return of \n16.80%.  This  shows  the  economic  viability  of  the  transmission  projects.  Robust  economic \nperformance is demonstrated under a range of downside sensitivity analysis. A summary of the \neconomic analysis is in Appendix 15. \n \nB. \n \n65.        For  tranche  1,  a  short  resettlement  plan  was  prepared,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and the resettlement framework, in full consultation with \nstakeholders and affected people. Additionally, compensation for indigenous people is provided \nin the resettlement plan since its impacts under tranche 1 are not significant. The resettlement \nframework and IPDF were disclosed to the affected people in their local language. Appraisal of \nsuccessive  tranches  will  require  a  review  of  the  resettlement  framework  and  IPDF,  as  well  as \npreparation  of  resettlement  and  indigenous  people  development  plans,  if  needed,  or  the \nappropriate indigenous people plan and/or actions for all projects with indigenous people issues. \nA summary of the poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 16. \n \n66. \nTranche  1  will  have  minimal  impact  on  indigenous  people  as  four  scheduled  tribe \nhouseholds  will  lose  a  small  strip  of  land.  Minimal  land  acquisition  is  required  for  the \ntransmission  network  expansion  under  tranche  1.  The  projects  under  the  MFF  will  minimize \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n20 \n \n \nresettlement  by  adopting  adequate  engineering  solutions  in  the  design  through  proper \ninvolvement  of  all  stakeholders,  and  no  relocation  is  anticipated.  The  substations  under  the \nprojects  will  be  constructed  both  on  government  and  private  land.  The  construction  of \ntransmission lines will not require any permanent land acquisition. However, a temporary effect \non crops during construction is likely. Civil works will be carried out off-season when possible to \nminimize impact. The augmentation of the substations will not require any land acquisition. Of \nthe six proposed substations, three will be constructed on government land, which is free from \nany use. Two substations are proposed to be constructed on the barren land of the tea garden \nand the remaining one substation will require private land acquisition. However, the amount of \nland required is quite small. Approximately 24.09 ha will be required for the substations, of this \n12.04 ha will be private land and the remaining 12.04 ha will be government land.  \n \nThe  construction  of  transmission  lines  will  not  require  any  permanent  land  acquisition, \n67. \nand  will  only  have  a  temporary  effect  on  crops  during  construction.  Nine  households  will  lose \nland permanently; of these four scheduled tribe households will lose a strip of land, which will \nnot  be  more  than  10%  of  their  productive  assets.  Adequate  measures  and  entitlement  are \naddressed  in  the  resettlement  plan  to  provide  for  their  vulnerability.  None  of  the  affected \nhouseholds  are  severely  affected  as  they  are  not  losing  more  than  10%  of  their  productive \nassets. ASEB has ensured sufficient budgetary resources to cover the compensation packages \nprovided  in  the  resettlement  plan.  It  also  has  ensured  that  scheduling  tower  construction  and \nstringing  minimizes  crop  disruption  and  is  common  practice.  Impacts  of  tranche  1  and  future \ntranches, if any, are expected to be minimal. Compensation packages and a short resettlement \nplan were prepared for the project components of tranche 1 (Appendix 17).  \n \nThe  Investment  Program  is  expected  to  have  positive  impacts  in  terms  of  health  and \n68. \neducation conditions, and facilities are expected to improve in Assam. The average family size \nis 5.91. Electrical devices were found to be gender-related as women are generally considered \nto be more involved in household-related activities. In fact, the average number of electric lamps \nper  households  is  4.14  followed  by  3.18  fans,  1.06  televisions,  and  0.18  each  of  washing \nmachines and water pumps. Among the households, those reporting having electricity said they \nused kerosene and/or diesel, wood, and gas as alternate energy along with electricity.  \n \nThe  Investment  Program  is  designed  to  benefit  all  grid-connected  consumers  with \n69. \nadequate and reliable supply of electricity, to support the Government\u2019s projections for growth in \nenergy  demand  and  its  intent  to  make  affordable  grid-based  electricity  supply  available  to  the \nentire population by 2012. Government policy includes support to poor households via a lifeline \ntariff  for  the  first  1  kilowatt-hour  of  consumption  per  household  per  day.  A  secure  and \npredictable electricity supply will enable social and economic benefits to materialize, as well as \nensure  improved  conditions  for  schools,  hospitals,  and  other  social  services.  Improvements  in \nquality  and  reliability  of  supply  that  will  accrue  from  targeted  investments  are  expected  to \nimprove living conditions in rural areas through the creation of job and income opportunities.  \n \nC. \n \n70. \nAn  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  was  prepared  for  the \nInvestment  Program,  outlining  the  policy,  procedures,  and  institutional  requirements  for  the \noverall  and  for  each  tranche.  ASEB  is  responsible  for  preparing  the  required  environmental \nimplementation.  Environmental \nassessments  and  obtaining  ADB  concurrence  before \nassessment of the proposed investments has been and will continue to be conducted following \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy,  the  EARF,  and  applicable  Government  laws  and  regulations.  The \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\n \n\n\f21 \n \n\nfirst tranche investments are classified as category B10 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy. ASEB has prepared the IEE for tranche 1. Environmental assessments will be prepared \nin  due  course  for  the  remaining  projects  as  applicable,  in  accordance  with  the  EARF.  The \nsummary  IEE  for  tranche  1  outlines  environmental  benefits  and  negative  impacts,  proposed \nmitigation  measures,  and  the  EMP.  Public  consultations  indicate  strong  local  support  for  the \nproposed investments. \n \n71. \nFor  tranche  1,  based  on  the  environmental  assessments  and  reconnaissance  surveys, \nmost  of  the  impacts  will  occur  during  construction.  The  principal  impacts  are  related  to \nacquisition of rights-of-way for transmission lines, earthmoving and initial clearing of vegetation \nfor  construction,  and  periodic  clearing  of  vegetation  during  operations.  These  impacts  will  be \nmitigated  by  selective  routing  of  transmission  lines,  appropriate  erosion-control  measures, \nproper  management  of  construction-related  wastes,  and  provision  of  compensation  for \nreforestation, as necessary. No endangered, rare, or threatened species of flora or fauna have \nbeen  reported  at  any  project  sites.  Adequate  provisions  are  made  for  the  environmental \nmitigation and monitoring requirements and their associated costs. The project sites are mostly \non  government-owned  land.  The  land  acquired  for  new  substations  is  mostly  uninhabited, \nunused,  and  outside  towns  and  villages.  Mitigation  measures  related  to  construction  and \nspecified in the EMP will be incorporated into civil works contracts. Although the contractors will \nhave  primary  responsibility  for  implementation  of  mitigation  measures  during  construction,  the \nrelevant  implementing  agency  will  be  responsible  for  overall  implementation  of  site-specific \nEMPs. \n \nD. \n\nBenefits and Beneficiaries \n\n72. \nOverall the Investment Program will contribute to economic development of the state of \nAssam  on  several  fronts.  The  first  group  of  beneficiaries  will  be  local  electricity  consumers, \nincluding about 1 million electrified households; small- and medium-sized businesses, e.g., silk \nfactories; hospitals; and schools. As the second group of beneficiaries, all the existing electric \nconsumers  including  domestic  users  (51%),  commercial  users  (10%),  industrial  users  (27%),  \nagricultural users (2%), and others (10% will benefit from enhanced power operations. Through \nthe  distribution  franchisee  component,  720  entrepreneurs  are  expected  to  expand  their \noperations with at least 1,500 employees.  \n\ninfrastructure  and \n\nIn  addition,  construction  of \n\n73. \ninformation  and \ncommunication  technologies  are  expected  to  create  at  least  500  jobs.  The  renewable  energy \ndevelopment component will provide benefits for 2,100 villages with off-grid renewable energy in \nthe long term. With 89% of Assam\u2019s population living in rural areas, and approximately 60% of \nhouseholds  living  below  the  poverty  line,  the  rural  electrification  component  will  have  a  direct \nbenefit for the poor.11 The Investment Program will rationalize tariffs as well as improve the state \npower sector\u2019s financial viability.  \n\ninstallation  of \n\n                                                 \n10 Each  tranche  will  be  subject  to  environmental  categorization.  All  tranches  are  expected  to  be  category  B  or  C. \n\nTranches will be categorized as necessary if category A- or B-sensitive projects and/or projects are identified. \n\n11  Assam ranks 26th in the human resource development index and 21st in the poverty index in India according to the \nHuman  Development  Report  2001.  According  to  the  Census  2001,  52.65%  of  the  total  workforce  in  the  state  is \nengaged in agriculture and related activities. Assam has levels and rates of growth of income below the average \nfor  the  country.  The  incidence  of  unemployment,  measured  as  a  percentage  of  the  labor  force  is  increasing  in \nAssam. The unemployment rate in Assam in 1983 was 2.2%; it rose to 4.6% by 1999/00. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \nPotential Risks \n\n22 \n \n \nE. \n \n74. \nThe  key  broad  assumptions  are  (i)  macroeconomic  growth  will  remain  stable;  (ii)  GOA \nwill  remain  committed  to  further  power  sector  reforms  and  institutional  improvement;  and  \n(iii)  GOA  will  execute  its  investment  plan,  successfully  combining  physical  infrastructure \ninvestments  with  nonphysical  investments  in  capacity  development  to  maintain  a  sustainable \npower  sector.  Broad  risks  include  a  slowdown  in  the  depth  and  pace  of  policy  and  sector \nreforms. \n \n75. \nThese risks can be mitigated through political commitment, concerted action, and sound \nsupervision.  GOA  is  fully  committed  to  expanding  its  power  supply  and  continuing  with  sector \nreforms, including further tariff reform, improved corporate governance, institutional change, and \nincreased  private  sector  participation.  The  state  is  closely  following  the  execution  of  the  long- \nand medium-term plans for the sector, and recognizes that capacity development is a major part \nof  the  process.  The  proposed  interventions  will  help  address  these  issues  at  two  separate \nlevels\u2014state and project. The themes covered are broad (planning and policy formulation) and \nspecific  (due  diligence,  project  preparation,  implementation,  evaluation,  monitoring,  and \nreporting  for  results).  Good  governance  and  fiduciary  controls  are  recognized  as  important, \nalong with measures to ensure transparency and efficiency.  \n \nSpecific  project-related  assumptions  are  (i)  proper  operation  and  maintenance  of  the \n76. \ninstallations will be carried out according to standard requirements, (ii) adequate competent staff \nare available in the companies, (iii) load growth is as projected, (iv) regulatory mechanisms and \ninterventions  are  consistent,  and  (v)  the  capacity  development  program  is  successfully \nimplemented. Specific project-related risks include, (i) limited capacity and coordination of ASEB \nand implementing agencies to implement projects, and (ii) limited capacity of power generation \nplants not financed by ADB, that are not commissioned in a timely manner. These risks can be \nmitigated  through  the  capacity  development  TA  and  close-coordination  with  developers  of \nassociated  facilities.  Overall,  the  integrated  benefits  and  impact  are  expected  to  outweigh  the \ncosts, given the likelihood of the risks occurring. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n77. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government,  GOA,  and  ASEB  have  given \nthe following assurances, which are largely incorporated in the FFA, and will be incorporated in \nthe  individual  loan  agreement(s)  and  project  agreement(s)  as  applicable  and  mutually  agreed \nbetween the Government and ADB for each project under the MFF. \n \n78. \nthis regard, ASEB will ensure full participation of APGCL, AEGCL, and LAEDCL.  \n\nInstitutional and Financial Matters. ASEB will carry out the TA in a timely manner. In \n\n79. \nASEB, in consultation with APGCL, AEGCL, and LAEDCL, will develop a new business \nprocess  to  support  APGCL,  AEGCL,  and  LAEDCL  to  strengthen  the  functions  of  corporate, \nhuman resources, and financial management in consultation with relevant stakeholders so that \nthe  functions  will  be  fully  delegated  to  APGCL,  AEGCL,  and  LAEDCL  within  5  years  of  the \ninception of the TA.  \n\n80. \nASEB will, through LAEDCL, ensure implementation of the plan to be developed under \nthe  TA  for  expanding  the  SPPS  program  in  the  state,  so  as  to  at  least  double  the  number  of \nconsumers under the franchisees from the current level (of May 2009) by December 2014.    \n \n\n \n\n\f23 \n \n\nASEB  will  ensure  that  information  pertinent  to  the  projects  under  the  MFF  would  be \n\nASEB will ensure that the implementing agencies maintain a debt service coverage ratio \n\n81. \nmade available to the public and relevant stakeholders.  \n \n82. \nASEB will ensure that the projects under the MFF are implemented by the implementing \nagencies  in  accordance  with  governance  measures  referred  under  the  section  on  Corporate \nGovernance Measures in the FFA.  \n \n83. \nASEB  shall  ensure  that  during  preparatory  work  for  subsequent  PFRs  under  the  MFF, \nstakeholder  participation  and  public  consultation  shall  be  continued  by  relevant  implementing \nagencies as initiated in the processing of tranche 1. \n \n84. \nASEB will ensure that the implementing agencies will, by no later than December 2011, \nfile  for  a  multiyear  tariff  with  AERC  with  all  relevant  information  to  enable  the  issuance  of  a \nmultiyear tariff order by AERC in a timely manner.  \n \n85. \nof 1.2 on and after 31 March 2011. \n \n86. \nCounterpart  Funding.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  GOA  and  ASEB  make \navailable,  in  a  timely  manner,  the  counterpart  funding  for  the  efficient  implementation  of  each \nproject.  \n \n87. \nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  GOA  will  cause  ASEB,  and  through  ASEB  the \nimplementing  agencies,  to  undertake  the  projects  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  (1995),  the  resettlement  framework,  and  applicable  laws  and \nregulations of the Government and GOA.  \n \n88. \nSubject  to  compliance  with  the  relevant  provision  of  the  resettlement  plans  and  in \naccordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Government  and  GOA,  ASEB  will \ncause the implementing agencies to acquire or make available the land and rights to land free \nfrom any encumbrances, and clear the utilities, trees, and any other obstruction from such land, \nrequired  for  commencement  of  construction  activities  in  accordance  with  the  schedule  agreed \nunder the related civil works contract.  \n \n89. \nASEB  will  cause  the  implementing  agencies  to  ensure  that  all  land  and  rights-of-way \nrequired by the projects will be made available in a timely manner and that the provisions of the \nresettlement  plans,  including  compensation  and  entitlements  for  affected  households  and \npersons,  will  be  implemented  in  conformity  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the \nGovernment, GOA, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy, and the agreed resettlement plan.  \n \nASEB will cause the implementing agencies to ensure that affected people, if any, under \n90. \neach  project  are  provided  compensation  in  a  timely  manner  in  accordance  with  the  related \nresettlement  plans,  and  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Government  and  GOA.  GOA \nthrough  ASEB  will  provide  adequate  budgetary  support  to  cover  the  costs  of  land  acquisition \nand resettlement. ASEB with assistance of the implementing agencies will submit progress and \ncompletion reports on land acquisition and resettlement under the quarterly progress reports for \neach  project.  In  addition,  the  external  monitoring  report  shall  be  submitted  to  ADB  on  a \nsemiannual basis for review with regard to land acquisition and resettlement. \n \n91. \nASEB will cause the implementing agencies to ensure that prior to land acquisition and \nany resettlement under each project, the related resettlement plan including its update based on \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n24 \n \n \nconsensus  of  affected  people,  is  disclosed  with  all  necessary  information  made  available  to \npeople  affected  by  the  project  and  confirm  that  it  is  uploaded  onto  ADB\u2019s  web  site.  ASEB  will \nensure  that  essential  communal  property  that  may  be  affected  under  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  is  replaced  as  appropriate  in  an  expeditious  manner  in  accordance  with  the \nresettlement plans.  \n \n92. \nCompensation  should  be  awarded  in  case  construction  activities  block  pathways  and \ndeprive  some  people  of  their  livelihood  temporarily.  Further,  ASEB  would  ensure  that  all \ncompensation  programs  are  completed  as  outlined  in  resettlement  plans  prior  to  the \ncommencement of civil works.  \n \n93. \nASEB  will  cause  the  implementing  agencies  to  implement  construction  contracts \ncontaining  binding  requirements  for  construction  contractors  to  fully  reinstate  pathways,  other \nlocal infrastructures, and agricultural land to at least their preproject condition upon construction \ncompletion.  Provision  should  be  made  for  adequate  recording  of  the  condition  of  roads, \nagricultural  land,  and  other  infrastructure  prior  to  transport  of  material  and  construction \ncommencement.  ASEB  will  cause  the  implementing  agencies  to  ensure  that  the  requirements \nset out in the IPDF will be implemented as required. In case any indigenous people are affected \nby  the  project,  an  appropriate  indigenous  people  development  plan  will  be  formulated  and \nimplemented in accordance with the IPDF.  \n \n94. \nEnvironment.  GOA,  through  ASEB,  will  ensure  that  the  projects  under  the  MFF  are \nundertaken and that all project facilities are designed, implemented, operated, and maintained \nin  accordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Government  and  GOA,  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy, and the EARF. For each project, ASEB will cause the implementing agency \nto prepare and implement the necessary IEE or EIA, and EMP (with budget) in accordance with \nthe EARF. For projects, the environmental categorization and assessment procedures defined \nin the EARF will be followed.  \n \n95. \nFor  any  environment  category  A  or  B  sensitive  projects,  an  SEIA  or  SIEE  will  be \nprepared  and  made  available  to  the  public  120  days  before  a  PFR  is  submitted  to  ADB  for \napproval.  Through  the  implementing  agencies,  ASEB  will  monitor,  audit,  and  report  to  ADB \ntwice  a  year  on  implementation  of  the  EMPs  for  each  project.  GOA  will  ensure  that  all \nassociated  projects  will  be  constructed  and  commissioned  in  compliance  with  the  laws  and \nregulations of the Government.  \n \nSocial.  ASEB  will  cause  the  IA  to  ensure  that  civil  works  contracts  under  the  Project \n96. \nfollow  all  applicable  labor  laws  of  the  Borrower  and  the  State  and  that  these  further  include \nprovisions  to  the  effect  that  contractors  (i)  carry  out  HIV/AIDS  awareness  programs  for  labor \nand  disseminate  information  at  worksites  on  risks  of  sexually  transmitted  diseases  and \nHIV/AIDS as part of health and safety measures for those employed during construction; and (ii) \nfollow and implement all statutory provisions on labor (including not employing or using children \nas labor, equal pay for equal work), health, safety, welfare, sanitation, and working conditions. \nSuch  contracts  shall  also  include  clauses  for  termination  in  case  of  any  breach  of  the  stated \nprovisions by the contractors.  \n \n97. \nSubproject  Selection  and  Implementation.  ASEB  will  cause  the  implementing \nagencies  under  each  project  to  ensure  that  all  subprojects  are  evaluated,  selected,  and \nprepared in accordance with the selection criteria and approval process included as schedule 4 \nto the FFA and implemented in accordance with the procedures set out therein. \n \n\n \n\n\f25 \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n98. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  multitranche  financing  facility  would  comply  with  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount  not  exceeding  $200,000,000  equivalent  to  India  for  the  Assam  Power  Sector \nEnhancement  Investment  Program  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the Framework Financing Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n\n26 October 2009 \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nTable A1.1: Design and Monitoring Framework for Components of the Investment Program \nFinanced by the Multitranche Financing Facility \n\n26 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n \n \nDesign Summary \nImpact \nA sustainable state \npower sector with \nincreased \ntransmission and \ndistribution capacity \nto support inclusive \neconomic growth  \n\nOutcome \nEnhanced quality and \nexpanded service \ndelivery of electricity \nin Assam through \nimproved technical, \ncommercial, and \nfinancial performance \nand capability of the \npower sector utilities \n\nOutputs \nPhysical Investments \n1.

\n \n1. \nUnbundling  of  Assam  State  Electricity  Board.  To  encourage  efficiency,  improve \nservice  quality,  and  increase  management  accountability,  the  state  government  of  Assam \n(GOA) unbundled the Assam State Electricity Board (ASEB) into five companies: Assam Power \nGeneration Corporation Limited (APGCL); Assam Electricity Grid Corporation Limited (AEGCL); \nand  three  distribution  companies:  Central  Assam  Electricity  Distribution  Company  Limited \n(CAEDCL),  Lower  Assam  Electricity  Distribution  Company  Limited  (LAEDCL),  and  Upper \nAssam  Electricity  Distribution  Company  Limited  (UAEDCL).  ASEB  remains  active  as  the \ncoordinating agency. The statutory transfer scheme was approved on 10 December 2004.  \n \nTransfer  of  Assets,  Liabilities,  and  Personnel.  Within  a  6-month  provisional  period \n2. \nending  on  31  May  2005,  GOA  completed  the  transfer  of  assets,  liabilities,  and  personnel \n(provisionally  assigned  on  as-is  where-is  basis  with  subsequent  representation  mediated  by  a \nGOA  committee),  and  business  arrangements  to  the  successor  companies  so  they  could  be \nindependent and operating fully.  \n\n \n3. \nGovernance  and  Industry  Structure.  ASEB  and  its  successor  companies  filed \nintercompany contracts with Assam Electricity Regulatory Commission (AERC), including power \npurchase  agreements,  transmission  service  agreements,  and  bulk  supply  agreements  with \nASEB retaining the bulk purchaser function during the transition period. Independent managing \ndirectors and a board of directors are responsible for the operation of each company. \n\n \n2. \n\nRegulatory Framework and Tariff Reforms \n\n \n \n4. \nCapacity  Building  and  Staffing  of  AERC. In February 2005, GOA decided to expand \nAERC  from  a  one-member  commission  to  a  multimember  commission  with  a  chairperson  and \ntwo  members.  The  commission  structure  has  been  retained  along  with  secretarial  and \nadministrative staff. \n \n5. \nRegulatory Rules and Standards. In accordance with the Electricity Act (2003), AERC \nand  GOA  have  progressively  framed  a  number  of  codes,  rules,  and  standards  governing  \ntariff-setting, licensing, long-term sector planning, a nondiscretionary business environment, and \nadjudication  of  disputes.  Principal  Regulations  were  notified  by  May  2005,  with  progressive \namendments  issued  consistent  with  national  policies  and  guidelines  and  Appellate  Tribunal \nOrder. \n\n \n6. \nTariff Rationalization. AERC has been rationalizing the tariffs since the first tariff order \nin April 2003. For the three subsequent tariff orders for the utilities since FY2006 onward, AERC \nadopted  a  performance-based  regulation  with  return  on  equity  linked  to  utility  performance  \n(7% for LAEDCL, 14% for AEGCL in 2008). The cost coverage (ratio of tariff to cost) at LAEDCL \nlevel as per AERC tariff order 2007/08 is expected to reach 88% from own consumers. On the \nissue of multiyear tariffs and a 3-year control period starting 2007, AERC after considering the \nunavailability  of  reliable  utility  data,  restructuring  impacts,  and  utility  preparedness  for  a \nmultiyear tariff adopted a cautious approach of examining and approving costs on a single-year \nbasis. \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nB. \n\nPhysical Power Sector Overview \n\n7. \nGeneration.  Assam  experienced  increased  peak  power  shortages  over  the  entire 10th \nfive  year  Plan  period  (1%  at  end  of  the  9th  Plan  to  8.4%  in  2007/08).  This  has  had  a  severe \nimpact since demand in Assam has increased at a consistent pace from 688 megawatts (MW) \nin FY2002 to 848 MW in FY2008, Generation from APGCL accounted for 45% of Assam\u2019s total \npower availability of 1,960 gigawatt-hours in the first half of 2008. Only 766 MW were available \nto  respond  to  the  peak  power  demand  of  848  MW  in  2008.  This  is  expected  to  be  addressed \nwith adequate generation capacity being developed for Assam.  \n\n8. \nTransmission. Since 2002, AEGCL has been expanding capacity and currently has 38 \nsubstations  and  4,189  circuit-kilometers  of  transmission  lines  (voltage  ranging  from  66  kV  to  \n220 kV). In FY2008, the transmission network was able to meet a maximum demand of 766 MW \n(90% of the maximum demand) of Assam and transmitted 4,079 gigawatt hours (92% of energy \nrequirement).  The  transmission  capacity  is  inadequate  to  serve  peak  demand,  which  is \nexpected to grow at an annual rate of 14.8% to reach 1,883 MW in 2014 as per the 17th Electric \nPower Survey of the CEA.  \n\n9. \nDistribution.  The  Assam  distribution  sector  intends  to  meet  the  national  target  of \nelectrification for all by 2012 as well as 100% household electrification by 2012. Despite some \nimprovement during the Assam Power Sector Development Program, significant improvements \nare needed for (i) reducing losses in excess of 30% (preferably to 15%, as envisaged in the the \nGovernment  policy  directive),  (ii)  increasing  inadequate  transformation  capacity  at  11  kV,  (iii) \nimproving consumer metering, and (iv) enhancing billing efficiencies. Village electrification was \nonly  77%  in  2008.  New  investments  need  to  be  targeted  to  improve  the  quality  of  supply  and \nthrough  (i) \nreduce \ntransformation capacity;  (ii) sub transmission network capacity (33 kV and 11 kV) addition; (iii) \nintroduction  of  high  voltage  distribution  system  and  advanced  technology-based  transformers, \ne.g., amorphous core transformers in the distribution network; (iv) introduction of smaller-rating \ntransformers at intermittent places in long-lines; and (v) introduction of aerial bunched cables in \nareas.\ntheft-prone \n\nlow  voltage  circuits  and  distribution \n\ntransformer  overloading \n\nlong \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n    Appendix 3      \n\n37\n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE POWER SECTOR \n\n \nIndia\u2019s  power  sector  has  received  a  major  portion  of  its  external  assistance  from  the \nAsian  Development  Bank,  Canadian  International  Development  Agency,  Department  for \nInternational  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency, \nInternational \nKreditanstalt \nDevelopment,  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement,  and  World  Bank.

The community-based private sector \nand nongovernment organizations selected through competitive bidding process buy electricity \nfrom LAEDCL. The franchisee retains a pre-set margin and passes on the remaining collection \nto LAEDCL. With 720 franchisees, the SPPS program has enhanced power sector governance \nwith  more  participation,  competition,  and  transparency;  and  improved  sector  financial  viability. \nUnder  the  2003  Assam  Power  Sector  Development  Program,  power  supply  in  Sualkuchi  was \nexpanded  in  a  reliable  manner  by  the  SPPS  program,  enabling  more  electrification  of  village \nhouseholds  and  increased  consumption.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  studied  the \nimpact  on  small  silk  factories,  a  hospital,  and  a  school  through  a  series  of  field  visits  and \ninterviews with village residents. This appendix summarizes the outcome of a field case study \nby  ADB  conducted  from  January  to  March  2009  to  assess  the  example  of  direct  linkage \nbetween reliable electricity supply and poverty reduction.  \n \n2. \nPower for Silk Factories. ADB visited one of the oldest small silk Sualkuchi factories\u2014\nBraza  Silk  Factory\u2014in  Sualkuchi  village,  where  approximately  40  women  employees  work. \nWhile  talking  to  the  female  workers  and  management,  the  SPPS  scheme  was  noted  to  be  a \ncrucial role element in for the overall development and progress of the factory. People are of the \nopinion  that,  prior  to  the  SPPS  scheme,  the  supply  of  electricity  was  not  adequate.  Female \nworkers were limited to 6 hours of work because of the limited electricity supply. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMs. Haritri Boro and Ms. Champa Boro, employees of the factory, told the ADB mission \n3. \nthat the improved electricity supply since the takeover of the franchisee in managing distribution \nhas  created  a  significant  change  in  their  working  conditions  because  of  adequate  lighting  to \nensure  sufficient  working  hours.  They  also  note  that  increased  working  hours  due  to  stable \nelectricity  supply  enables  them  to  make  more  sophisticated  sarees  with  advanced  modern \ndesign and greater market value. They said that in earlier days, they used to prepare only one \nsaree with a simple design in a week. With the improved electricity supply they are able to make \n\nAn electrified machine replaced the old manual machine (on the left) causing better supply of threads, while \nwomen enjoy better working hours and working conditions after introduction of the single point power supply \nscheme in Sualkochi Village \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 6 \n \n\n \none  saree  in  less  than  a  week  with  more  design  and  handicrafts,  resulting  in  greater  market \nvalue. They said that they are now able to make one saree per week and earn Rs500 per saree \nresulting in a monthly income of Rs2,000.  \n \nMr. Pulin Bharali, the factory owner, notes that the village SPPS scheme has been quite \n4. \nhelpful in increasing employment: the number of female workers increased from 20 in 2003 to \n40 in 2009. Power cuts are now very limited\u2014about 1 hour per day, compared with 5 hours per \nday in the past. Thus production has increased with better designed clothes. This has opened \nbetter  markets  for  their  products.  In  general,  everyone  in  the  factory  is  very  satisfied  with  the \nSPPS power supply. \n \n5. \nPower for Education. In Sualkuchi, improvements in electricity supply have encouraged \ninvestment  in  educational  facilities.  With  a  reliable  and  stable  power  supply,  the  elementary \nschool for girls and boys now uses computers and internet access in the classroom. At home, \nas a consequence of better voltage profiles, hours available for educational activities for adults \nand  children  have  increased.  The  ADB  mission  visited  Sualkuchi  CBSE  public  school  in \nFebruary 2009. The school was established when the SPPS started in 2003.  \n \n6. \nMr.  Krishna  Kumar,  the  school  principal,  notes  that  although  the  school  was  electrified \nfrom  the  beginning,  the  power  supply  was  irregular.  According  to  him,  the  SPPS  program \nhelped them access a more reliable electricity supply, which has a direct positive bearing on the \nschool and its daily activities. Sualkuchi\u2019s humid summer climate creates difficulties for students \nwhen  the  electricity  supply  is  irregular.  With  a  better  electricity  supply,  the  school  uses  more \ncomputers, which ultimately encourages students to know more and concentrate on studies with \naccess  to  modern  electronic  equipment.  This  ultimately  reduces  the  number  of  dropouts.  The \nworking  environment  is  better  now  with  adequate  lighting  and  fans  due  to  reliable  electricity \nsupply\u2014a result of the SPPS scheme. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPower for Health Care. The case study verified that the enhanced electricity supply has \n7. \nimproved  quality  and  availability  of  public  health  and  other  social  services.  One  hospital  in \nSualkuchi village, Mahatma Gandhi rural hospital, illustrates how better electricity supply plays a \nvital  role  in  the  overall  development  of  treatment  and  patient  conditions.  The  ADB  mission \nvisited the hospital and conducted interviews with the hospital official, Dr. Kartik Chandra Medhi, \nand  with  patients.  The  mission  learned  that  the  current  franchisee-run  SPPS  program  helped \nthe  hospital  introduce  more  modern  equipment  such  as,  an  x-ray  machine,  vaccine  storage, \n\nBetter electricity supply by the single point power supply scheme helps the school introduce more computers \nand students enjoy the better school facilities. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6  \n\n43\n\nlaparoscopic  machine,  and  ultrasound  machine;  and  place  more  fans  and  lights  in  the  patient \nareas, among other advances.  \n \n8. \nThe hospital authority notes that the hospital had only 5 beds before 2005 and now has \napproximately 30. The number of doctors increased from 3 in 2005 to 10 in 2009. The unreliable \npower supply caused various problems for patients, and complaints of electricity failure had to \nbe  acknowledged  and  rectified  on  a  regular  basis.  The  current  stable  electricity  supply  allows \nstaff to safely maintain vaccines in the freezer. If not directly, the SPPS scheme has a positive \nimpact on patients. In 2009, 400 patients visit the hospital per day compared with 100 patients \nin 2005 . Patients note that the hospital has better facilities, lighting, and sanitation facilities with \nthe regular power supply. The franchisee staff gives utmost attention to any complaints by the \nhospital, and the hospital as a result provides better services to patients. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \nThe hospital has modern medical equipment that operates smoothly with better electricity supply. Patients \n \nhave better conditions. \n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n          Appendix 7 \n\n  \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES FOR TRANCHE 1 PROJECTS \n \n\nTable A7.1: Detailed Cost Estimate by Expenditure Category \n\nItem\nA.

Appendix 12 \n\n \n\nFINANCIAL MANAGEMENT \n\n \n\n \n\n1. \nA  financial  management  assessment  of  the  Executing  Agency,  the  Assam  State \nElectricity  Board  (ASEB)  and  implementing  agencies:  Assam  Electricity  Grid  Corporation \nLimited (AEGCL) and Lower Assam Electricity Distribution Company Limited was undertaken to \nassess their ability to undertake and fulfill fiduciary requirements for the project components of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB). The assessment was in accordance with ADB guidelines \nusing  the  financial  management  assessment  questionnaire  and  field  interviews,  and  was    in \naccordance with the guidelines of ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.  \n \n2. \nPrior  to  2003,  ASEB  was  responsible  for  carrying  out  all  the  financial  management-\nrelated functions for the unbundled entity. ASEB prepared its accounts as per the old Electricity \n(Supply) Annual Accounts Rules (1985). Specific financial management-related gaps in training, \nprocesses,  and  systems  resulted  in  deficiencies  in  the  cash  management  function  at  ASEB. \nThis,  in  some  part,  resulted  in  repeated  defaults  on  payment  to  suppliers  and  over  time \ncontributed  to  a  worsening  of  the  financial  situation  in  ASEB  as  cross-subsidizing  consumers, \ne.g.,  tea  gardens  and  industries,  moved  out  of  the  distribution  network  because  of  unreliable \npower  supply.  This  eventually  resulted  in  reduced  cost  coverage  for  ASEB,  coupled  with \nunsustainable debt and negative net worth. \n \n3. \nUnder  the  ADB-supported  Assam  Power  Sector  Development  Program  (APSDP), \ncommencing  in  2003,  structural  reforms  were  initiated  to  improve  the  operating  and  financial \nperformance  of  ASEB.  The  state  government  of  Assam  (GOA)  unbundled  ASEB  into  Assam \nPower  Generation  Corporation  Limited  (APGCL);  AEGCL;  and  three  distribution  companies  in \nthe lower, central, and upper areas of Assam. ASEB remains active as the coordinating agency.  \n \n4. \nGOA  also  implemented  a  financial  restructuring  plan  (FRP)  for  debt  restructuring  and \nprovided transitional support to enable the newly formed utilities to commence operations with a \nclean  balance  sheet  without  the  burden  of  past  ASEB  liabilities.  Each  of  the  newly  formed \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution companies is required to comply with the accounting \nand  reporting  standards  prescribed  by  the  Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants  of  India  and  the \nCompanies Act (1956).  \n \n5. \nThe APSDP resulted in several accomplishments in the area of financial management. \nThe  newly  formed  companies  have  introduced  accounting  policies  as  per  statutory  reporting \nrequirements  and  conducted  statutory  audits  of  their  financial  statements  as  per  Institute  of \nChartered Accountants of India guidelines, using independent auditors. No major accountability \nissues  were  identified  in  the  independent  audit  report  for  2005\u20132007.  Audited  financial \nstatements for 2007/08 are expected to be released shortly. As required under the APSDP loan \ncovenant,  audited  project  accounts  and  audited  financial  statements  of  ASEB  have  been \nregularly submitted, though with some delays.  \n \nDespite  noticeable  improvements,  certain  constraints  have  been  identified  with  respect \n6. \nto  carrying  out  the  financial  management  function.  These  constraints  need  to  be  addressed \nunder the sector road map and policy dialogue for the proposed multitranche financing facility. \nThe newly formed generation, transmission, and distribution companies continue to be partially \nautonomous  with  regard  to  financial  management  and  operate  under  a  centralized  cash  flow \nmechanism where all revenue collections from distribution utilities are routed to ASEB and cash \nrequirements to meet expenses in each company are drawn from ASEB on a need basis.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12     53 \n\n \n\nFinancial  management  functions  such  as  investment,  funding,  and  budgeting  decision \n7. \nmaking are being carried out in consultation with ASEB. Also, a paucity of well-trained staff in \nthe  area  of  financial  management  has  resulted  in  existing  staff  having  to  take  on  additional \nresponsibilities  for  the  financial  management  function  in  multiple  companies.  This  has \ncontributed  to  delays  in  finalizing  accounts  at  regional  offices.  Further,  constraints  with  the \nlegacy  information  technology  systems  have  resulted  in  data  verification  problems  and  timely \nconsolidation  of  accounts  at  the  head  office  of  the  implementing  agencies.  A  study  of  the \nfinancial statements and discussions with the financial management staff indicate the need for \nprocess  improvement  in  the  budgetary  control  function,  for  cost  center  accounting,  and  for \nupdating existing accounting policy manuals.  \n  \n8. \nThe sector road map discussions indicate that GOA would support the development of \nthe  financial  management  function  in  AEGCL  and  the  Lower  Assam  Electricity  Distribution \nCompany  Limited  through  the  introduction  of  information  technology  systems  for  the  financial \nmanagement function that could be implemented rapidly in a cost-effective manner. To support \nthis,  ADB  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  be  provided  for  (i)  staff  capacity  development,  \n(ii)  consulting  services  to  assess  and  identify  areas  for  process  improvement  in  the  financial \nmanagement  function,  and  (iii)  assistance  in  carrying  out  updates  on  accounting  policy  and \nmanuals  for  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies.  The  proposed  changes  in  the  sector \nstructure coupled with capacity development in the sector entities is expected to empower the \ndistribution companies and result in complete unbundling of ASEB by 2014.  \n \n9. \nthe  executing  and \nfinancial  management \nimplementing  agencies  indicate  ability  to  undertake  the  fiduciary  requirements  for  the  loan. \nASEB  has  a  well-staffed  project  management  unit  (one  director  and  8  full-time  officers)  with \nprior  experience  executing  an  ADB  loan 1 ,  and  is  conversant  with  ADB  guidelines  and \nprocedures. AEGCL, the Implementing Agency for tranche 1 has established a separate project \ncell to monitor implementation of the ADB loan-related transmission investments in an effective \nmanner.  \n\nThe  assessment  of \n\nfunction \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\n10. \nThe  financial  management  TA  requirements  identified  during  loan  fact  finding  are \nconsidered  appropriate  to  provide  support  for  adequate  financial  management,  reporting,  and \nimplementation of the multitranche financing facility. As a consequence of the TA support, the \nproposed project financial management arrangements are considered satisfactory.  \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

Sub-\noptimal billing and collection, and unsustainable technical and commercial losses (44% in 2002) \nled  to  repeated  defaults  on  payments,  large  burden  of  accumulated  debts,  and  inadequate \nfunds for operation and maintenance, reflected in heavy load-shedding and migration of cross-\nsubsidizing customers to captive generation.  \n\n2. \nThe financial restructuring plan approved by the state government of  Assam under the \nAssam  Power  Sector  Development  Program  supported  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank \ninvolved  a  total  restructuring  adjustment  of  Rs45.6  billion  comprising  a  noncash  settlement  of \nRs34.0  billion  and  Rs11.58  billion  as  liabilities  involving  cash  settlement.  The  debt  to  equity \nposition  of  the  utility  improved  from  being  overlevered  at  227%  in  2004  to  37%  in  2006.  The \nAssam  government  also  provided  support  in  terms  of  contribution  to  meeting  ASEB  pension \nliability to the extent of Rs0.89 billion in 2006.  \n\n3. \nASEB improved its cost recovery from 49% in 2002 to 85% in 2007. The 2007 target in \nthe  Assam  Power  Sector  Development  Program  was  exceeded  through  the  reduction  of  debt \nburden through the financial restructuring plan (debt to debt-plus-equity ratio declined from 77% \nin 2005 to 44% in 2008) and several other factors such as improvements in generation, a 42.5% \n(2003)  to  35%  (2009)  transmission  and  distribution  (T&D)  loss  reduction,  and  trading  income \ngeneration  The  tariff  rationalization  process  by  the  Assam  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission \nfrom 2003 to 2008 contributed to an improvement in the cost coverage.  \n\n4. \nTable  A13.1  summarizes  ASEB  financial  performance  (2005\u20132008)  and  indicates  the \nuncontrollable  nature  of  elements  such  as  increase  in  gas  prices,  central  power  sector \nundertakings,  plant  tariffs,  and  employee  expenses  due  to  a  central  pay  commission  increase \nleading to a cost increase in 2008. \n\nFY 2006 \nActual \n\nFY 2007 \nActual \n\nTable A13.1: Past Performance of Assam State Electricity Board \nFY 2005 \nActual \n\nItem  \nASEB Performance  \nGeneration and Purchases (GWh) \nLosses (%) \nSales MU \nAverage Revenue (Rs/kWh) \nIncome (Rs billion) \nExpenditure (Rs billion) \nActual Profit after Tax (Rs billion) \nReturn on Average NFA (%) \n( ) = negative number, GWh = gigawatt-hour, kWh = kilowatt-hour, MU =  Million Units  , NFA = net fixed assets. \nSources: Annual accounts, Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nFY 2008 \nUnaudited \n3,641 \n31 \n2,512 \n4.66 \n16 \n17 \n(1) \n(13) \n\n3,302 \n39 \n2,016 \n3.78 \n10 \n21 \n(11) \n(207) \n\n3,360 \n35 \n2,184 \n4.24 \n11 \n13 \n(2) \n(33) \n\n3,396 \n33 \n2,275 \n4.48 \n12 \n13 \n(1) \n(14) \n\n \nThough Assam has improved since 2003, the financial position of the sector is still not \n5. \nvery  strong.

The profitability of the Assam Electricity \nGrid  Corporation  Limited  (AEGCL)  is  expected  to  grow  in  line  with  improvements  in  the \nefficiency and effectiveness of its operating performance, moving toward the allowed return on \nequity  ceiling  of  14%.  The  project  funding  will  enable  AEGCL  to  undertake  the  planned \ninvestment. Projected financial performance indicators improve over the forecast period. From \n2010 on, the debt service coverage ratio is expected to exceed 1.2 in all years, while the debt to \ndebt-plus-equity ratio is expected to decline to 40 % by 2015. The summary of AEGCL financial \nprojections is in Table 6 of the main text. \n \n9. \nLower Assam Electricity Distribution Company Limited. The financial projections of \nthe  Lower  Assam  Electricity  Distribution  Company  Limited  (LAEDCL)  indicate  that  with  the \nprogressive  tariff  increases  approved  by  the  Assam  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission, \nprofitability will be sustained and improved on a consistent basis. LAEDCL\u2019s return on equity will \nbe positive from 2009 onward, achieving 14% from 2011 onward. The returns will improve over \nthe subsequent period driven by the focused T&D loss reduction program and trading revenues. \nWith the proposed tariffs, expected cash flow is strong and the debt service ratio is expected to \nexceed  1.2  in  all  years.  The  summary  of  LAEDCL\u2019s  financial  projections  is  in  Table  7  of  the \nmain text. \n\n \n\n\f56     Appendix 14 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS FOR TRANSMISSION PROJECTS \n\nMethodology and Major Assumptions \n\n \n1. \nThe  financial  analysis  of  the  proposed  transmission  projects  was  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  of  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB). 1 All  financial  costs  and  benefits  are  expressed  in  constant  2009  prices.  Cost \nstreams  used  for  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  determination,  i.e.,  capital  investment \nand  operation  and  maintenance,  reflect  the  costs  of  delivering  the  estimated  benefits.  The \ncurrent methodology to calculate tariffs for transmission wheeling charge was used to estimate \nthe financial benefits.  \n \nA. \n \nThe  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  Assam  Electricity  Grid  Corporation \n2. \nLimited (AEGCL) was calculated for the proposed transmission projects was compared with the \nproject  FIRRs  to  ascertain  the  financial  viability  of  the  projects.  The  sensitivity  of  the  FIRR  to \nadverse movements in the underlying assumptions was also assessed. Based on this analysis, \nthe transmission projects are assessed to be financially viable.  \n \n3. \nFinancial viability was examined by comparing the incremental costs and benefits of the \nwith- and without-investment scenarios. Incremental costs include the investment and operation \ncosts  associated  with  transmission  projects.  The  investment  costs  include  all  civil  works, \nelectrical and mechanical works, and resettlement costs associated with all the substations and \ntransmissions  project.  The  incremental  benefits  to  the  project  company  would  arise  from  the \nrevenue  that  would  be  approved  by  the  Assam  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  (AERC) \nbased  on  its  tariff  determination  principles.  The  projects  are  assumed  to  have  a  25-year \neconomic  life  and  residual  value  of  10%  of  the  original  investment  at  the  end  of  the  25-year \nevaluation period. \n \nThe tariff principles set by AERC in March 2006 allow AEGCL to pass through full cost \n4. \nrecovery  of  depreciation,  return  on  equity,  operation  and  maintenance  expenses,  and  interest \non  loans  and  working  capital.  AERC  tariff  methodology  for  transmission  follows  the  Central \nElectricity Regulatory Commission tariff methodology for interstate transmission licensees such \nas  Power  Grid  Corporation  of  India  Limited.  Recent  revisions  in  Central  Electricity  Rural \nCommission tariff methodology for 2009\u20132014 that would need to be considered for adoption by \nAERC for transmission tariffs such as depreciation norms and interest on working capital norms \nhave been factored into the FIRR calculations.2 The above tariff revenue streams are converted \nto  real  terms  by  adjusting  for  domestic  inflation.  Transmission  projects  considered  are  also \nexpected  to  produce  positive  environmental  benefits  mainly  on  account  of  delivery  of \npredominantly clean energy to Assam.  \n \nB. \n \n5. \nTo  compute  the  WACC,  the  financing  sources  are  assumed  to  comprise  state \ngovernment  of  Assam  (GOA)  equity  contributions  and  foreign  loans.  The  cost  of  equity  is \ncalculated based on GOA\u2019s long-term bond rate and a margin. The analysis assumes that the \nADB loan is passed through to GOA, ASEB, and AEGCL in Indian rupees with the interest rate \n\nCalculation of Weighted Average Cost of Capital  \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2005.

An increase in approved return on equity by \nAERC  to  reflect  the  new  Central  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  norms  of  15.5%  for  central  transmission \ncompanies would provide an upside to the FIRR calculations. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14     57 \n\n \n\nincluding allowance for the Government\u2019s foreign exchange premium. The foreign inflation rate \nis  taken  as  2.4%,  with  the  domestic  inflation  rate  at  3.0%.

The rates for the individual projects compare favorably \nwith  the  estimated  WACC  at  2.10%,  substantiating  the  financial  viability  of  the  transmission \nprojects.  \n \nD.  \n \nExternal  Risks.  Tariff-related  risk  for  the  transmission  projects  may  be  considered \n7. \nminimal  since  AERC  is  to  be  guided  by  the  tariff  determination  methodology  proposed  by  the \nCentral  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  for  regulation  and  tariff  setting  for  interstate \ntransmission licensees. In general compared to the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, \ncertain relaxation in tariff norms is permitted by the state regulator given that state transmission \nutilities  are  still  some  way  from  achieving  the  performance  of  the  interstate  transmission \nlicensee.  The  tariff  is  based  on  full-cost  recovery  with  an  allowed  rate  of  return  on  equity.  If \nnecessary, regulated entities could submit revised asset capitalization and financing plans, and \nAERC would in normal course adjust tariffs accordingly. Unilateral tariff revisions are unlikely as \nAEGCL  would  have  recourse  to  a  public  hearing  process  before  AERC  and  the  Appellate \nTribunal, if required, to establish its case. Volume risk is also minimal since the current system \nis  peak-constrained,  and  demand  is  expected  to  constantly  grow  as  consumers  revert  to  grid \npower.  The  typical  geopolitical  and  political  risks  that  are  present  for  projects  in  India  would \napply in this case. The overall risk perception of the project is deemed to be minimal. \n \n8. \nProject-Specific Risks. Financial risks for projects include the following: (i) an increase \nin the price of civil works and equipment, (ii) delays in project implementation, and (iii) failure to \nhave access to necessary counterpart funds. These risks are considered low since (i) the cost \nestimates are based on recent tenders received, and advance procurement will reduce the time \nbetween loan effectiveness and disbursement; (ii) AEGCL\u2019s implementation capacity has been \nproven in recent project implementation, with further support to be provided under the capacity \ndevelopment component; and (iii) AEGCL\u2019s financial projections demonstrate satisfactory cash \nflows  throughout  the  forecast  period  to  meet  the  repayment  of  debt  associated  with  the \ninvestments, once projects are commissioned.  \n \n9. \nSensitivity  Analysis.  Analysis  was  carried  out  to  examine  the  sensitivity  of  the  FIRR \nand financial net present value to adverse changes in key variables. The variables considered \n\n \n\n\f58     Appendix 14 \n\n \nfor the sensitivity analyses are a 20% increase in capital costs, 20% increase in operation and \nmaintenance costs, and a 1-year implementation delay.  \n \n10. \nTable  A14.2  demonstrates  that  the  results  are  robust  for  the  transmission  projects \nconsidered, with sensitivities exceeding the WACC. The project is most sensitive to capital cost \noverruns and delays. If a capital cost overrun occurred, AERC is expected to consider the cost \noverrun for inclusion in the tariff determination if the costs were prudently incurred or occurring \non account of factors outside AEGCL\u2019s control. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A14.2: FIRR Sensitivity Analyses \n\n \nItem \n\nFIRR \n(%) \n\nFNPV      \n(Rs million) \n\nBase case \n20% increase in capital cost  \n20% increase in O&M cost \nOne-year implementation delay  \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return; FNPV = financial net present \nvalue, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n6,233 \n6,142 \n5,707 \n5,314 \n\n7.41 \n6.10 \n6.99 \n6.31 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15     59 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS FOR TRANSMISSION PROJECTS  \n\n1. \nThe Assam transmission system has several constraints that prevent the flow through of \nadequate power to meet the distribution system requirements. The proposed investment to be \nfunded by the multitranche financing facility in Assam would be part of a larger investment plan \nin  Assam\u2019s  transmission  and  distribution  network.  This  investment  proposal  for  transmission \nprojects  (in  tranche  1  and  tranche  2)  would  result  in  removing  constraints  in  the  state \ntransmission  system  thereby  allowing  utilization  of  power  available  from  the  interstate \ntransmission  network  to  meet  existing  and  incremental  demand  within  Assam,  improve  the \ntransmission network reliability, and decrease the transmission losses.  \n \n2. \nThe  power  generation  sources  are  owned  by  various  central  public  sector  utilities  and \nconstitute  an  integral  component  of  the  National  Electricity  Plan  prepared  by  the  Central \nElectricity  Authority  (CEA).  Power  Grid  Corporation  of  India  Limited  undertook  the  interstate \ntransmission network planning on a least-cost basis. The economic analysis of the investment \nproposal for transmission projects was carried out in accordance with Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. A time-slice approach was adopted for \nthe  entire  transmission  investment  as  allocating  costs  and  benefits  to  individual  transmission \nsubprojects would be difficult. The economic analysis confirms that the investment proposal is \neconomically viable. \n\nA. \n\nDemand and Supply Situation \n\n3. \nIndia\u2019s economy has grown by nearly 8% per annum in recent years, and faces rapidly \ngrowing  energy  needs.  Addressing  the  energy  challenge  is  essential  for  fostering  sustainable \neconomic  growth.  Taking  into  account  India\u2019s  energy  security  concerns,  the  Government  of \nIndia  (the  Government)  developed  the  Integrated  Energy  Policy  (2006)  to  facilitate  adequate \nand reliable energy supplies in a technically efficient, economically viable, and environmentally \nsustainable  manner.  Specific  measures  include  reducing  technical  and  commercial  losses  of \nstate transmission and distribution utilities, and increasing the focus on renewable sources. CEA \ndeveloped national electricity demand forecasts under the 17th Electric Power Survey (EPS) in \n2007.  Peak  load  and  energy  requirements  are  based  on  actual  figures  for  the  2  most  recent \nyears and estimates of peak demand and energy until 2012, available in the EPS report (Table \nA15.1). \n\nTable A15.1: National and State Demand Forecasting \n\nYear \n\n2007/08 \n\n2008/09 \n\n2009/10 \n\n2010/11 \n\n2011/12 \n\nAll India \n(GW) \n\nAssam \n(GW) \n\nAll India (MU) \n\nAssam \n(MU) \n\n113,059 \n\n121,891 \n\n131,413 \n\n141,678 \n\n152,746 \n\n0,925 \n\n1,034 \n\n1,155 \n\n1,291 \n\n1,443 \n\n699,299 \n\n757,287 \n\n820,920 \n\n891,203 \n\n968,659 \n\n4,395 \n\n4,922 \n\n5,653 \n\n6,529 \n\n7,585 \n\n      GW = giga-watt, MU = million units \n\n Source: Central Electricity Authority. 2008{Year}. 17th Electric Power Survey.(India). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60     Appendix 15 \n\n \n\n \nTable A15.2: Revised Energy Scenario in Assam \n\n \nYear \n2007\u20132008a \n2011\u20132012 \n\nPeak Demand (MW) \n\nEnergy (MU) \n\nRequirement \n848 \n1,443 \n\nMet \n766 \n- \n\nRequirement \n4,097 \n7,585 \n\nMet \n4,079 \n- \n\nMU = million units, MW = mega watt          \n a  Figures for the year 2007\u20132008 are for April\u2013February. \nSource(s): Central Electricity Authority and Assam State Electricity Board. \n\n5. \nIn 2008, Assam\u2019s projections of peak demand requirement was 848 megawatts (MW), a \nreduction of about 8% against the 925 MW projected under the EPS. However, two independent \nprojections indicate the peak demand requirement in 2012 would be 1,443 MW, in line with 17th \nEPS  estimates.  Importantly,  the  peak  demand  met  by  the  Assam  power  system  in  2008  was \nonly 766 MW. Seasonal unavailability of generation coupled with constraints in the transmission \nand  distribution  network  are  considered  responsible  for  not  meeting  the  peak  requirement  of \npower.  CEA  estimates  indicate  that  generation  capacity  would  be  adequate  to  meet  Assam\u2019s \ndemand and create surpluses commencing from 2012. However, load flow studies indicate that \nunless  the  transmission  and  distribution  infrastructure  in  Assam  is  substantially  enhanced  and \naccess to consumers extended, the available power would not likely be able to flow through the \nexisting network to meet Assam\u2019s end consumer power requirements.  \n\nThe  least-cost  planning  proposal  required  for  strengthening  and  improving  the \n6. \ntransmission system to meet the projected peak demand and energy requirement was identified \nbased  on  load-flow  studies  carried  out  on  the  Assam  Electricity  Grid  Corporation  Limited \n(AEGCL) transmission system. The projects considered under tranches 1 and 2 do not factor in \nany distribution network expansion investments (which are to be undertaken under tranche 3). \nPower  available  to  the  Assam  network  is  expected  to  cater  to  meeting  some  proportion  of \nincremental  demand  as  well  as  replacement  of  costlier  captive  generation  by  supply  from \ncheaper and predominantly cleaner sources of electricity. The impact of incremental load growth \non account of enhanced village and household electrification as well as the proposed reduction \nin distribution losses would be factored in the economic analysis for tranche 3. \n\nB. \n\nProject Costs \nThe  total  economic  cost  of  the  transmission  projects15 was  taken  at  Rs9,246.3  million \n7. \nover  3  years  from  2010  to  2012  as  indicated  in  Table  A15.3.  The  costs  are  expressed  in \nconstant 2009 prices. The domestic price numeraire was used; tradable inputs were valued at \ntheir  border  price  equivalent  value  and  were  converted  to  domestic  equivalents  using  an \nestimated standard exchange rate factor for material. A conversion factor for labor cost is based \non  inputs  from  labor  cost  details  available  with  AEGCL.  Capital  costs  include  physical \ncontingencies,  but  exclude \nfinancial  charges  during \nconstruction.  The  incremental  costs  and  benefits  of  the  tranche  1  project  proposals  were \nestimated by comparing with- and without-project scenarios.  \n\ntaxes,  price  contingencies,  and \n\n8. \nUnder the without-project scenario, load flow studies indicate that contracted generation \ncapacity  from  outside  the  state  would  be  considered  sold  by  Assam  to  external  purchasers \nbecause the constraints in the transmission system would prevent power flows into Assam. The \noperating generation costs are based on the opportunity cost of power and for economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) calculation purposes reflect border price equivalent value of Rs3.5/unit of \npower.  \n\n                                                 \n15  The transmission projects considered for economic analysis include both tranche 1 and tranche 2 projects. \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                  Appendix 15       \n\n61\n\nUnder  the  with-project  scenario,  electricity  that  is  required  within  Assam  to  meet \n9. \ndistribution  company  requirements  is  considered  delivered  to  the  AEGCL  network  because  of \nimprovements  in  the  transmission  system.  The  rest  of  the  power  is  available  for  sale  to \npurchasers  outside  the  state.  The  associated  annual  operation  and  maintenance  costs  of  \nRs765 million annually are derived from the financial operation and maintenance cost of AEGCL \nusing appropriate conversion factors for labor and material costs. The economic cost of Power \nGrid  Corporation  of  India  Limited  transmission  charges  that  would  be  applicable  for  wheeling \npower  from  project  sites  through  interstate  lines  to  input  points  for  the  AEGCL  network  is \ncalculated at Rs0.30/unit using appropriate conversion factors for labor cost and material cost. \n\nC. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n10. \nThe economic benefits of the without-project scenario would be sale of the power by the \nAssam  distribution  companies  to  purchasers  outside  the  state  in  absence  of  adequate \ntransmission capacity to deliver the power to consumers within the state. The quantum of power \navailable for external sale ranges from 1,226 MU in 2012 to 5,260 MU for 2015 and onward for \nthe purpose of EIRR computation. In the with-project scenario, the following economic benefits \nare identified: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nReplacement  of  diesel-based  captive  generation  (tea  gardens  and  major \nindustries currently depend on captive generation options due to unavailability of \npower  supply  from  distribution  companies).  The  quantum  of  power  is  based  on \nprevious load flow studies in Assam and ranges from 107 MU in 2012 to 810 MU \nin  2020.  This  is  considered  as  nonincremental  consumption  in  the  system  and \nthe  economic  value  is  based  on  the  resource  cost  savings  that  would  accrue. \nis  computed  at  \nThe  economic  cost  of  captive  diesel-based  generation \nRs7.5 /unit. \n\nThe  second  component  of  the  power  is  used  to  meet  the  existing  shortfall  of \npower  in  Assam  (the  quantum  of  power  is  based  on  CEA  reports  and  ranges \nfrom  141  MU  in  2012  to  497  MU  in  2020)\u2014largely  for  smaller  domestic  and \ncommercial  customers  and  is  valued  at  the  willingness  to  pay  for  power16 for \nthose consumer categories. \n\nIn  addition,  the  impact  of  reduction  of  transmission  losses  because  of  the \nphysical investment that ADB would make in the system through refurbishment of \nexisting  subtransmission  stations  and  reactive  power  compensation  schemes \nwas also considered for evaluation of benefits. This is valued at the marginal cost \nof power procured by LAEDCL.17 \n\n11. \nThe  economic  cost  of  generation  considered  for  the  EIRR  computation  in  the  with-\nproject scenario is computed based on the opportunity cost for the power that would otherwise \nhave  been  sold  to  customers  outside  Assam  in  the  without-project  scenario.  The  residual \nquantum  of  power  (ranging  from  978  MU  in  2012  to  3953  MU  in  2020)  in  the  with-project \nscenario is expected to be sold to consumers outside the state.  \n\n                                                 \n16  \n\nWillingness  to  pay  estimates  are  assumed  at  Rs5.1/kilowatt-hour  for  domestic  consumers,  Rs2.5/kilowatt-\nhour for commercial consumers in the region.

A loss reduction of 2% \n\nas considered in performance targets would increase the EIRR of the transmission project. \n\n \n\n\f62     Appendix 15 \n\n \n\n \n\nD. \n\n \n\nEstimation of Economic Internal Rate of Return \n\n12. \nThe basis for transmission project economic evaluation is a comparison of benefits and \ncosts  between  the  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  A  period  of  25  years  is  used  for \neconomic  evaluation,  including  3  years  of  capital  investment  and  construction.  Investment  is \nassumed to take place between 2010 and 2012, and benefits are expected to be realized from \nthe first year of operation. Residual values are estimated for transmission investment based on \na 40-year economic life for state transmission. The detailed cost\u2013benefit calculations show that \nthe overall transmission project is economically viable, with an estimated EIRR of 16.80%. This \nis considered to be a good return.  \n\nTable A15.3: Economic Internal Rate of Return Calculation  \n\nQuantity of Power (GWh)\n\nBenefits (Rs million)\n\nCosts (Rs million)\n\nNet Benefit (Rs million)\n\nNon-Incremental\nOutput\n\nOutput\n\nIncremental Loss Savings Non-Incremental\n\nOutput\n\nOutput\n\nCapital\nIncremental Loss Savings AEGCL \n\nOperating\nGeneration AEGCL \n\n0\n0\n107\n320\n390\n460\n530\n600\n670\n740\n810\n810\n810\n810\n810\n810\n810\n810\n810\n810\n810\n810\n810\n810\n810\n810\n810\n810\n\n0\n0\n141\n433\n442\n450\n459\n469\n478\n488\n497\n497\n497\n497\n497\n497\n497\n497\n497\n497\n497\n497\n497\n497\n497\n497\n497\n497\n\n0\n0\n39\n43\n44\n45\n46\n46\n47\n48\n48\n48\n48\n48\n48\n48\n48\n48\n48\n48\n48\n48\n48\n48\n48\n48\n48\n48\n\n0\n0\n800\n2400\n2925\n3450\n3976\n4501\n5026\n5551\n6076\n6076\n6076\n6076\n6076\n6076\n6076\n6076\n6076\n6076\n6076\n6076\n6076\n6076\n6076\n6076\n6076\n6076\n\n0\n0\n614\n1878\n1915\n1954\n1993\n2033\n2073\n2115\n2157\n2157\n2157\n2157\n2157\n2157\n2157\n2157\n2157\n2157\n2157\n2157\n2157\n2157\n2157\n2157\n2157\n2157\n\nTransmission\n1,849\n6,472\n925\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n(3,467)\n\n0\n0\n156\n174\n177\n180\n182\n185\n188\n191\n194\n194\n194\n194\n194\n194\n194\n194\n194\n194\n194\n194\n194\n194\n194\n194\n194\n194\n\nInter-State\n\nNet Benefit\n\nNet Benefit\n\n0\n0\n869\n2635\n2911\n3187\n3463\n3740\n4018\n4297\n4576\n4576\n4576\n4576\n4576\n4576\n4576\n4576\n4576\n4576\n4576\n4576\n4576\n4576\n4576\n4576\n4576\n4576\n\nTransmission Transmission w/o loss savings with loss savings\n(1849)\n(6472)\n(554)\n824\n1090\n1357\n1623\n1890\n2157\n2423\n2690\n2690\n2690\n2690\n2690\n2690\n2690\n2690\n2690\n2690\n2690\n2690\n2690\n2690\n2690\n2690\n2690\n6158\n\n(1849)\n(6472)\n(709)\n650\n913\n1177\n1441\n1705\n1969\n2233\n2497\n2497\n2497\n2497\n2497\n2497\n2497\n2497\n2497\n2497\n2497\n2497\n2497\n2497\n2497\n2497\n2497\n5964\n15.32%\n\n0\n0\n75\n228\n251\n275\n299\n323\n347\n371\n395\n395\n395\n395\n395\n395\n395\n395\n395\n395\n395\n395\n395\n395\n395\n395\n395\n395\n\n0\n0\n255\n765\n765\n765\n765\n765\n765\n765\n765\n765\n765\n765\n765\n765\n765\n765\n765\n765\n765\n765\n765\n765\n765\n765\n765\n765\n\nEIRR\n\n16.80% \n\n() = negative, AEGCL = Assam Electricity Grid Corporation Limited, EIRR = economic internal rate of return. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nE. \n\nSensitivity and Risk Analysis \n\n13. \nThe risks for the transmission projects to achieve an EIRR of 16.80% are identified from \nthe perspective of both costs and benefits. Cost risks include delay in program implementation, \nand increases in capital and operating costs. Benefit risks include consumers\u2019 willingness to pay \nas derived from an ADB study. If the state experiences significantly lower economic growth that \nresults in a dampening of demand for electricity and consumers\u2019 willingness to pay, the program \nbenefits would be lower. For each of the risks identified, the sensitivity of the EIRR was tested. \nBased on these results, the overall transmission project appears to be economically robust and \ndelivers acceptable economic returns over a range of input assumptions (Table A15.4). \n\nTable A15.4: Sensitivity Analysis (%) \n\nParameter \n\nSensitivity  \n  \n\nBase Case \nGeneration Cost Increase \nTransmission Capital Cost Increase \nWillingness to Pay Reduction \nOperation and Maintenance of Transmission Increase\nDelay \nSource(s): Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n\nVariation \n \n10 \n25 \n(10) \n10 \n1 year \n\nEIRR \n16.80 \n14.01 \n13.97 \n15.29 \n16.24 \n16.62 \n\nYear\n\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n2035\n2036\n2037\n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                  Appendix 15       \n\n63\n\nThe economic analysis confirms that the transmission projects under tranche 1 are least-\n14. \ncost  and  economically  viable.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe power sector in India has great potential to contribute to economic development and social well-being, but infrastructure \nfacilities  need  to  be  expanded  and  managed  more  effectively  to  ensure  consistent  economic  growth.  Development  of  the \npower sector is connected to poverty reduction. Clean power development ensures that the poor will benefit, as they bear a \nlarger share of the adverse impacts of pollution and environmental degradation. Also, stable power supplies promote business \nexpansion and increase employment opportunities, which can have a positive impact on poverty reduction. \n \nThe multitranche financing facility (MFF)-has intrinsic scope for poverty reduction. It will bring direct and indirect positive social \nimpacts. This will specifically benefit people living in remote areas through improved frequency and voltage for various uses. \nThis  will  ultimately  result  in  socioeconomic  growth.  Electricity  is  a  key  input  for  socioeconomic  development.  Efficient  and \nreliable  provision  of  electricity  contributes  to  poverty  reduction  through  economic  growth,  and  is  central  to  the  basic  human \nneeds of health and education. Poor and vulnerable consumers, as well as social utilities such as hospitals, and schools, are \noften particularly disadvantaged by inadequate power supply, load shedding, and inadequate power quality; and will therefore \nbenefit  directly  from  the  Investment  Program.  Direct  positive  economic  and  social  benefits  will  result.  In  addition,  a  better \nsupply  of  electricity  will  enable  farmers  to  set  up  high-powered  pump  sets  that  will  contribute  to  better  crop  yields.  The \nInvestment  Program  is  expected  to  generate  considerable  employment  in  terms  of  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  during \nconstruction. Finally, social services in Assam will improve as poor and vulnerable consumers (including hospitals, schools, \nand other social utilities) that are often hardest hit by inadequate power supply, load shedding, and inadequate power quality, \nwill benefit directly. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  General intervention \n\n1.   Key Issues  \n \nThe economy  of Assam is overwhelmingly agricultural. According  to the  Census 2001,  52.65% of the  total  workforce in the \nstate  (58.40%  in  India)  is  engaged  in  agricultural  and  allied  activities.  The  total  cropped  area  (1999/2000)  is  4.087  million \nhectares and the total net area sown 2.734 million hectares. The urban population comprises 12.90% of the total population. \nAbout 36.09% of the state's population continues to live below the poverty line, considerably above the national average of \n26.10% (1999/2000). The rural\u2013urban divide is illustrated by 40% of rural residents being likely to live below the poverty line, \ncompared  with  less  than  10%  in  urban  areas.  Assam  has  levels  and  rates  of  growth  of  income  below  the  average  for  the \ncountry and the gap is widening. In 1950/51, Assam's per capita income was 4.1% higher than the average for the country; by \n1980/81  it  was  27%  lower  than  the  national  average,  and  by  1998/99  it  was  45.5%  lower.  Inequity  also  exists  between \nregions;  the  per  capita  income  of  the  district  with  the  highest  income  is  more  than  three  times  that  of  the  district  with  the \nlowest.  According  to  1994/95  estimates,  the  district  of  N.C.  Hills  recorded  the  highest  per  capita  income  of  Rs3,464  and \nDarrang recorded the lowest at Rs1,100. Assam's per capita income in constant prices (1993/94) stands at Rs6,157 and at \ncurrent  prices  (2000/01)  Rs10,198.  The  incidence  of  unemployment,  measured  as  a  percentage  of  the  labor  force  is \nincreasing  in  Assam.  Unemployment  rates  in  Assam  in  1983  were  2.2%,  as  compared  with  2.0%  for  the  country.  By \n1999/2000,  the  country's  unemployment  rate  had  risen  marginally  to  2.3%,  while  Assam's  unemployment  rate  had  risen \nsubstantially to 4.6%.  \n \nThe Investment Program will create employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled labor during implementation. The local \npopulation will benefit as it will be provided with a more secure and reliable source of electricity. Contractors are expected to \nhire skilled and unskilled workers for 5 years of civil works. Jobs will be available beyond the construction phase throughout \nthe  projects'  life  cycles.  Approximately  172,200  person-days  of  employment  will  be  generated  due  to  construction  of  the \nprojects under tranche 1, which will employ 40% skilled workers and 60% unskilled laborers. \n \n2.  Design  Features.  No  direct  impact  on  poverty  is  envisaged  to  occur  as  result  of  Investment  Program  implementation. \nNonetheless, it will have indirect impacts on both Assam and India. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nAppendix 16     65 \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe Investment Program will have positive impacts in terms of health and education conditions, and facilities are expected to \nimprove in Assam as well as the rest of the country due to the access to more reliable electricity. A social analysis was carried \nout in the program area for the tranche 1 component, using a sample socioeconomic household survey. The average family \nsize is 5.91, and the sex ratio of the project-affected population is 871:1000. Literacy is reported to be 79%. About 95% of the \nhouseholds report practicing agriculture as the main economic activity. In the project areas, about 60% of households report \nhaving  land.  The  average  possession  of  land  is  0.5  ha  and  about  57%  land  is  reported  to  be  cultivable.  Rice  is  mostly \ncultivated  by  households  living  in  the  project  area  and  a  few  households  report  cultivating  vegetables.  The  total  average \nannual  income  of  households  in  the  project  area  is  Rs106,255.  The  annual  household  expenditure  reported  is  Rs86,496; \nabout 52% of the expenditure is incurred for food, 7.7% for education and 5.33% for health. Indebtedness among households \nin the  project-affected area  is not common. Nearly  one fifth (19%) of the surveyed households report  that a family member \nsuffered from major illness during the last year. Malaria and appendicitis are common. Migration is not common; only 7.41% \nreport that a member migrated during the last year. In addition to household activities, the women of the sampled households \nare engaged in productive activities like cultivation, labor both agricultural and nonagricultural, household industries, and silk \nweaving.  Women\u2019s  participation  in  decision  making  is  reported  from  38%  of  the  households  The  major  sources  of  drinking \nwater  are  springs,  which  are  usually  distributed  through  pipes  (55.56%).  One  fourth  of  the  households  report  not  having  a \nlatrine.  Liqufied  Petroleum  Gas  is  the  major  source  of  fuel  used  by  households  (55.56%)  for  cooking  followed  by  wood \n20.99%.  The  average  age  of  structures  is  18.34  years.  Most  of  the  houses,  i.e.,  about  54%  are  of  brick.  Similarly  59%  of \nhouseholds  are  permanent,  followed  by  30.86%  semipermanent.  The  average  number  of  rooms  per  structure,  according  to \nthe survey, is 4.33, of which 3.74 on average have electric lights. About 60% of households are electrified. The main source of \nelectrification  is  the  government  grid.  The  average  hours  of  consumption  of  electricity  and  supply  is  13.14  hours.  Of  the \nsurveyed households, 90% report having meters that are regulated on a regular basis. Those without meters report paying a \nminimum charge to the electricity department. The average number of electric lamps per households is 4.14, followed by fans \n3.18,  televisions  1.06,  washing  machines  0.18,  and  water  pumps  0.18.  The  average  consumption  among  the  44  metered \nhouseholds  is  55  units;  the  average  expenditure  per  household  for  electricity  is  only  Rs191.  About  one  fourth  (24.49%) \nreported an incidence of power theft in their area. The majority (about 68%) report that they would provide support to control \npower  theft  in  their  area.  The  households  with  electricity  report  using  kerosene  and/or  diesel,  wood,  and  gas  as  alternate \nenergy along with electricity. Of households without electricity, 59.38% use batteries for lighting their house, and 92.5% stated \nthat they would pay an electricity bill regularly if electricity was provided and admitted that they can afford an average increase \nin electricity up to 8.94% of the current bill. About one fourth (24.69%) of the households opined that the usage of electricity \nwill increase in future. About 69.14% report that the Investment Program will help increase the living standard of the people in \ntheir area.  \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nConsultations  were  carried  out  with  all  the  stakeholders  including  civil  society  and  nongovernment  organizations  during \nprogram preparation. As an integral part of safeguards planning, affected communities and affected people were directly and \nfully  involved  in  project  preparation  and  design.  All  stakeholders  were  informed  and  the  stream  of  information  will  continue \nduring the implementation.  \n \n2.

Was a C&P plan prepared? \nC&P was considered as a part of the more extensive resettlement planning exercise. Local communities and affected people \nwere consulted throughout the preparation process to minimize impacts, ensure social acceptance, and increase equitability. \nThe  process  will  continue  during  project  implementation.  Views  and  concerns  of  all  stakeholders  will  be  taken  into \nconsideration  and  addressed  whenever  feasible.  Finally,  local  customs,  religious  practices,  and  traditional  activities  were \nconsidered  as  a  fully  integrated  part  of  the  preparation  process  to  avoid  discrimination  and/or  disruption  of  activities,  as \nminimization measures.  \n\n No  \n\nC.

The  Government  of  Assam  and  the  Assam  State  Electricity  Board  (ASEB)  will  be \nthe  executing  agencies.  This  is  a  short  resettlement  plan  prepared  for  the  tranche  1 \ncomponents,  which  include  construction  of  substations,  transmission  lines,  and  augmentation \nand/or expansion of existing substations. \n \nImpact on Land Acquisition and Resettlement \nA. \n2. \nAn  assessment  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  was  carried  out  for  the  tranche  1 \nprojects. They have minimized resettlement by adopting adequate engineering solutions in their \ndesign  through  proper  involvement  of  all  stakeholders.  No  relocation  is  anticipated  as  the \nprojects  include  transmission  components  that  entail  minimal  land  acquisition.  Of  the  \n6  substations,  3  will  be  constructed  on  government  land,  which  is  free  from  any  use.  Two \nsubstations  are  proposed  to  be  constructed  on  barren  land  of  the  tea  garden  owner  and \ncompany,  and  the  remaining  1  substation  will  require  private  land  acquisition.  Approximately \n24.09 hectares (ha) will be required for the substations: 12.04 ha of private land and 12.04 ha of \ngovernment  land.  The  construction  of  transmission  lines  (262  kilometers)  will  not  require  any \npermanent land acquisition, but will have a temporary effect on crops during construction. Of the \n9 households affected, 4 are scheduled tribe households that will lose a strip of land of not more \nthan 10% of their productive assets. Adequate measures and entitlement are addressed in the \nresettlement  plan.  Of  the  22  affected  people,  12  are  male  and  10  are  female;  6  households \naffected are vulnerable. None of the affected households are severely affected as they are not \nlosing  more  than  10%  of  their  productive  assets.  The  summary  of  impacts  are  given  in  Table \nA16.1. \n \n\nTable A16.1: Summary Impact on Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n\nSl. \nNo. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n\nImpacts \n\nTotal area of private land (hectare) \nTotal area of tea estate land (hectare) \nTotal area of agricultural land (hectare) \nTotal number of structures  \nTotal number of community property resources  \nTotal number of trees \nTotal number of affected households \nTotal number of vulnerable households \nTotal number of titleholders \nTotal number of nontitleholders \nTotal number of affected people \n\nNumber/Amount \n12.04 \n6.69 \n5.35 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n9 \n6 \n9 \n0 \n22 \n\nSource: Census and Inventory Survey. \n \n\nPolicy, Legal Framework, and Entitlement Matrix \nB. \n3. \nThe  policy  framework  and  entitlements  for  the  MFF-supported  projects  are  based  on \nnational laws: the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (amended in 1984) and the National Rehabilitation \nand  Resettlement  Policy,  2007;  and  the  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).

Assam  Power  Generation  Corporation  Limited  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency \nresponsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  of  projects  for  transmission  systems,  and  Lower \nAssam Electricity Distribution Company Limited the Implementing Agency for distribution system \nprojects. ASEB, already has a functioning project management unit (PMU), which implemented \nthe  ADB-financed  Assam  Power  Sector  Development  Program.  It  is  responsible  for  the \npreparatory work for the MFF. An environment and social management unit (ESMU) will be set \nup  within  the  PMU  along  with  other  engineering  units  to  address  environmental  and  social \nissues  that  arise.  The  ESMU  will  be  headed  by  an  environment  specialist  and  resettlement \nspecialist,  assisted  by  one  environment  and  one  social  development\u2013resettlement  specialist \nwho will be responsible for field activities. The PMU will be responsible for overall coordination, \npreparation, planning, implementation, and financing. The ASEB will ensure that key institutions \nincluding  local  governments  are  involved  in  resettlement  plan  preparation,  updating,  and \nimplementation.  \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\n Appendix 17   \n\n \n\nConsultation, Disclosure, and Grievance \n\nD. \n \n5. \nConsultations were carried out with various government officials and local communities \nconcerned as part of the social and resettlement study to gather their views on the Tranche 1 \nprojects.  All  affected  people  were  consulted  on  a  one-to-one  basis  through  questionnaire \nsurveys for the project activities. Additionally, focus group discussions were carried out at all the \nproposed substation sites and along the transmission corridors. Local residents expressed their \ncooperation  for  smooth  project  implementation.  The  consultation  process  will  be  continued \nduring the entire project cycle. The resettlement plan for tranche 1 was translated to Assamese \nlocal  language,  and  was  made  available  at  relevant  government  offices,  ASEB  project  site \noffices, and the PMU. The resettlement plan for the tranche 1 projects was disclosed before the \nfirst ADB management review meeting and placed on the ADB website. An efficient grievance \nredress  mechanism  will  be  developed  to  assist  affected  people  resolve  their  queries  and \ncomplaints.  Each  resettlement  plan  will  detail  specific  grievance  redress  mechanisms. \nGrievances  of  affected  people  will  first  be  brought  to  the  attention  to  the  site  office  of  the \nconcerned  implementing  agency.  Grievances  not  redressed  by  the  implementing  agency  field \nstaff  will  be  brought \nthe  grievance  redress  committee.
