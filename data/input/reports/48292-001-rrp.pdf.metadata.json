AEP II, a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership, is a closed-ended \nprivate equity fund [This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure \nspecified  in  paragraph  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2011)] that  will  invest  in \nmiddle-market environmental services and clean energy companies in Asia. The general partner \nwill be Olympus Green Capital Partners II, L.P. (general partner), a Cayman Islands exempted \nlimited  partnership.  The  general  partner  will  have  an  investment  advisory  services  agreement \nwith Olympus Green Investment Management Limited (investment manager), a Cayman Islands \ncompany  whose  sole  shareholder  is  Olympus  Capital  Holdings  Asia  (Olympus  Capital),  a \nCayman Islands company and a registered investment advisor with the United States Securities \nand Exchange Commission.2 \n \n3. \nInvestment  identification.  As  part  of  its  ongoing  market  mapping  of  attractive  private \nequity  fund  investment  opportunities  within  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries  (DMCs),  the \nPrivate  Sector  Operations  Department  has  had  an  ongoing  dialogue  with  Olympus  Capital,  a \nleading  pan-Asian  middle-market  private  equity  firm,  and  has  followed  with  interest  the \nsuccessful  track  record  of  Asia  Environmental  Partners,  L.P.  (AEP),  the  $252  million \npredecessor fund to AEP II launched by Olympus Capital in 2008. \n \nIn the screening exercise for funds operating in this sector, Olympus Capital ranked very \n4. \nhigh  with  clear  advantages  over  its  direct  competitors  in  terms  of  track  record,  regional \nexperience,  access  to  proprietary  deal  flow,  and  investor  base.  [This  information  has  been \nremoved as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public \nCommunications Policy (2011)].  \n \nB. \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\nStrong  growth  rates  in  energy  demand,  combined  with  a  push  toward  cleaner  energy \n5. \ngeneration, energy efficiency, and resource conservation, are creating a substantial investment \nneed  in  countries  such  as  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  India.  Because  public \nsector funding to meet this need is often insufficient, the private sector will have a crucial role to \nplay in mobilizing additional resources. In 2013, new investments in clean energy within the Asia \nand  Pacific  region  made  up  $121  billion  of  the  $255  billion  invested  globally,  representing  a \nmore than  sixfold  increase  in  the  investment  level for  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region  since  2004.3 \nThis  continued  strong  growth  is  in  part  a  result  of  ambitious  policy  measures  and  targets  in \nplace across key DMCs, covering renewable energy, as well as energy, water, and other types \nof resource efficiency. As public awareness and government attention increasingly shift to Asia\u2019s \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  [This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph 97(v) of ADB\u2019s \n\nPublic Communications Policy (2011)]. \n\n3   Bloomberg New Energy Finance. 2014.

[This  information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  within  exceptions  to  disclosure \nspecified  in  paragraph  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2011)].

AEP  II  will  focus  on  established  and  profitable  operations  in  these  subsectors, \ninvesting  in  a  combination  of  asset-based  (primarily  brownfield)  companies  and  providers  of \nservices or equipment. Building on an emerging trend to consolidate Asian private investment in \nenvironmental services, AEP II will, where appropriate and akin to the strategy pursued in AEP, \nbuild regional platform clusters around a specific growth opportunity. \n \nC. \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n1. \n\nOwnership \n\n7. \nAEP  II  will  comprise  strategic  investors,  foundations,  family  offices,  and  other \ninstitutional  investors.

The team will be \nled  by  Frederick  Long  [This  information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  within  exceptions  to \ndisclosure  specified  in  paragraph  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2011)].  The \nAEP  team  has  an  extensive  private  equity  investment  track  record,  combined  with  deep \nexperience,  knowledge,  and  strong  relationships  in  the  clean  energy  and  environmental \nservices  sectors,  including  through  eight  investments  made  under  AEP.  AEP  II  will  also \nleverage  the  experience  of  the  broader  Olympus  Capital  team,  drawing  on  a  wide  range  of \ncommercial  experience  gained  from  investment,  financial,  and  operational  roles,  ensuring  a \nbroad  perspective  on  investments.  Olympus  Capital\u2019s  nine  managing  directors  have  worked \ntogether  at the firm for an  average of  14  years (five  of  them  have  worked  at  Olympus  Capital \nsince 1998) and bring over 200 years of collective commercial experience, primarily in investing \nand managing companies in Asia. \n \n11. \nOlympus  Capital  takes  a  highly  proactive  and  hands-on  approach  to  adding  strategic \nand  operational  value  to  its  investee  companies.  Through  its  representation  on  investee \ncompany boards, as well as commitment of substantial team resources\u2014typically including two \nmanaging  directors  per  investment\u2014Olympus  Capital  works  closely  with  the  respective \nmanagement  on  achieving  organic  and  inorganic  growth,  developing  strategies,  recruiting \nmanagement  staff  (80  senior  hires  into  portfolio  companies  to  date),  deepening  financial \ncontrols  and  strengthening  internal  systems,  accessing  financing  and  capital  markets,  and \nimproving environmental standards. \n \n\n3. \n\nGovernance Structure \n\nOlympus  Capital  will  follow  a  typical  three-stage  investment  process  developed  and \n12. \nrefined  in  its  17-year  history:  (i)  investment  screening  of  each  potential  portfolio  company\u2019s \noperations, products, market opportunity, and valuation against AEP II\u2019s mandate and strategy; \n(ii)  deal  structuring  and  due  diligence;  and  (iii)  preparation  of  investment  proposals  for \npresentation to AEP II\u2019s investment committee. \n \n13. \nOlympus  Capital\u2019s  distinct  competitive  advantages  in  adding  value  to  its  portfolio \ncompanies  are  its  ability to  draw  on  the  experience  of  its more than  20  senior  advisors  (six  of \nwhom will be dedicated to AEP II). The senior advisors bring extensive operational and sector-\nspecific experience and are instrumental in providing potential deal flow opportunities, as well as \nstrategic support and insight pre- and post-investment. \n \nIn addition to its investment committee, AEP II will also establish an advisory committee \n14. \nconsisting of at least five (and potentially up to 10) individuals selected by the general partner as \nrepresentatives  of  the  limited  partners.  ADB  will  expect  to  be  represented  on  the  advisory \ncommittee.6 \n \n15. \nBeing registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Olympus \nCapital  is  required  to  fully  comply  with  its  provisions  on  combating  corruption,  money \n                                                \n6  The  role  of  the  advisory  committee  is  to  represent  the  interests  of  AEP  II\u2019s investors,  addressing  issues such as \nconflicts of interest, valuations, and AEP II\u2019s progress in achieving its investment objectives. It will not participate in \nAEP II\u2019s investment process or make investment decisions.

After  reviewing  Olympus  Capital's  policies  on \nscreening for integrity, money laundering, and financing of terrorism risks, ADB is satisfied that \nsufficient checks and measures are in place (footnote 2). ADB will require appropriate auditing \nof the implementation of such policies. \n \nD. \n\nFinancial Performance \n\nin \n\nits \n\nthrough \n\nfunds  under \n\nOlympus  Capital, \n\nits  management,  makes  private  equity \n16. \nthree  core  sectors:  (i)  environmental  services  and  clean  energy, \ninvestments \n(ii) agribusiness,  and  (iii)  financial  and  business  services.  It  has  developed  a  track  record  of \neffectively exiting investments at attractive returns, investing more than $1.8 billion of capital on \nbehalf  of  its  funds  and  co-investors  in  more  than  40  portfolio  companies  across  Asia  within  a \nrange  of  subsectors.  [This  information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  within  exceptions  to \ndisclosure  specified  in  paragraph  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2011)]. \nOlympus  Capital\u2019s  first  fund  with  a  focus  on  the  clean  energy  and  environmental  services \nsectors,  AEP,  recently  completed  its  investment  period,  having  made  eight  investments  [This \ninformation has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph \n97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2011)]  into  companies  involved  in  subsectors \nsuch  as  renewable  energy,  water  and  wastewater  treatment,  and  waste-to-energy. 7  [This \ninformation has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph \n97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2011)].  Benchmarked  against  current  trading \nmultiples for comparable companies, a number of the AEP investments hold significant upside \nvalue  potential,  based  on  their  projected  exit  multiples.  This  is  particularly  the  case  for  AEP \nplatform  investments  that  have  secured  market-leading  competitive  positions,  such  as  [This \ninformation has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph \n97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2011)]  in  the  Chinese  small-  to  mid-tier \nhydropower generation market. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nADB  will  provide  an  equity  investment  of  up  to  $30,000,000  in  AEP  II,  not  exceeding \n17. \n25%  of  AEP  II\u2019s  total  capital  commitments  and  not  resulting  in  ADB  being  the  single  largest \ninvestor in AEP II. \n \nB. \n\nFinancial Analysis of Expected Returns and Assumptions \n\n18. \nAEP  II  is  expected  to  achieve  similar  performance  results  as  targeted  by  AEP.  Overall \nreturn expectations for AEP II are anticipated to align with the performance of Olympus Capital\u2019s \nthree legacy regional funds. \n \nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nAEP II has a 10-year term from the final close, with two options to extend for a maximum \n19. \nof  1  year  each.  Olympus  Capital  anticipates  that  the  principal  exit  strategies  for  AEP  II\u2019s \ninvestments  will  include  both  trade  sales  to  strategic  buyers,  which  have  accounted  for  some \n70% of Olympus Capital\u2019s previous exits, and initial public offerings on Asian stock exchanges. \n\n                                                \n7  As  at  30  June  2013.  [This  information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  within  exceptions  to  disclosure  specified  in \n\nparagraph 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. \n\n\f \n20. \nADB will require AEP II to provide it with (i) quarterly unaudited reports and (ii) audited \nannual reports, including financial statements, a fund overview, and an overview of the portfolio \nwith brief information on each portfolio company\u2019s performance and valuation. ADB will review \nthis information and will follow up with the investment manager to clarify when more information \nis  needed.  If  information  received  from  the  investment  manager  points  to  issues  that  could \nimpair the value of ADB\u2019s investment, ADB will decide whether to put AEP II on a watch list for \nmore frequent review and closer attention. \n \n21. \nThe general partner will be required to adopt an environmental and social management \nsystem  (ESMS)  satisfactory  to  ADB,  and  to  report  annually  on  ESMS  implementation, \nparticularly relating to safeguards and other social requirements, and development effectiveness \nindicators. ADB will monitor the receipt and quality of the ESMS reports and offer guidance if the \ngeneral partner requires clarification on ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. \n \nD. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n22. \nCapital  mobilization.  ADB\u2019s  presence  and  reputation  as  an  investor  in  Asian \ndeveloping  countries  will  add  value  in  relation  to  AEP  II\u2019s  capital  mobilization  by  providing  a \nsignaling  effect  and  comfort  to  other  prospective  investors,  validating  the  environmental  and \nsocial  governance  framework  and  development  impact  against  a  backdrop  of  strong  financial \nreturns.  As  such,  it  is  a  prime  example  of  ADB\u2019s  \u201cFinance++\u201d  concept  of  leveraging  the \ninstitution\u2019s  reputation  and  capital  to  mobilize  third-party  investment  activity  in  DMCs.  ADB\u2019s \ninvestment is expected to help mobilize at least $90 million in additional commitments from final-\nclose investors, and, based on the track record of AEP, a similar amount from co-investors into \nAEP  II\u2019s  portfolio  companies.  Additionally  this  investment  will  allow  ADB  to  secure  co-\ninvestment  rights for  commercially  attractive  opportunities  sourced  by  AEP  II,  and  so  enhance \nits own equity deal pipeline. \n \n23. \nPolicy  and  regulatory  insight. The environmental services and clean energy markets \nare frequently underpinned by distinct policy and regulatory frameworks, which act as key value \ndrivers  for  companies  and  investments  within  these  sectors.  Through  its  presence  as  an \ninvestor in AEP II, ADB can draw on its extensive regional network and deep understanding of \nlocal regulatory frameworks to provide guidance to AEP II on policy issues. \n \n24. \nRaising  standards.  ADB\u2019s  presence  as  a  substantial  investor  in  AEP  II  obligates  the \ngeneral  partner  to  ensure  that  its  investee  companies  comply  with  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard  standards,  and  to  report  on  development  indicators.  Along  with  other  members  of \nAEP  II\u2019s  advisory  committee,  ADB\u2019s  role  will  be  to  assist  in  providing  oversight  on  raising \ngovernance  and  management  standards  that  are  essential  for  companies  to  demonstrate  as \nthey seek additional sources of growth capital from institutional and/or individual investors. \n \nE. \n\nRisks \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in \n\n25. \nparagraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)].  \n \n26. \nparagraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. \n \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in \n\n27. \nparagraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. \n \n28. \nparagraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. \n \n29. \nparagraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. \n \n30. \nparagraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. \n \n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\n31. \nThe development impact of the investment will be increased availability of private equity \nfinancing  for  environmental  projects  across  targeted  DMCs.  Specifically,  an  additional \n$200 million is expected to be invested in environment-related companies through private equity \nfunds  by  2029. The  promotion  of  private  equity participation  in  environmental funding  will  help \nfacilitate balanced and sustainable economic development in the targeted DMCs.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n32. \nThe  outcome  of  the  investment  will  be  sustainable  growth  and  profitability  of  AEP  II\u2019s \ninvestee  companies.  AEP  II  will  achieve  positive  financial  returns  with  meaningful  associated \nenvironmental  and  social  benefits.  The  private  equity  modality  is  expected  to  benefit \nenvironmental  services  and  clean  energy  companies  in  the  PRC,  India,  and  ASEAN  by  (i) \ncreating sustainable long-term value; (ii) driving technological innovation and deployment of low-\ncarbon  and  resource-efficient  solutions,  products,  and  services;  and  (iii) \ntransferring \ninternational  best  practice  governance,  environmental,  and  social  standards  to  portfolio \ncompanies. At the conclusion of this investment,8 AEP II is envisaged to fully exit its investment \nportfolio at a minimum net IRR of 8%, with 100% of AEP II\u2019s investee companies establishing at \nleast  one  baseline  metric  to  gauge  delivery  of  low-carbon  or  sustainability  services,  as \napplicable (e.g., volume of waste or water treated, megawatt-hours of clean energy generated, \nmegawatt-hours saved through energy-efficiency measures). AEP II is also expected to improve \nthe  corporate governance  and transparency  of  its  investee  companies, wherever  needed,  and \ncontribute to overall (net) job creation and tax contributions in the countries in which it invests. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\n33. \nThe  output  is  that  AEP  II  is  established  as  planned  and  its  capital  invested.  ADB\u2019s \nparticipation  will  send  positive  signals  to  the  market,  catalyzing  investments  from  additional \ninvestors,  particularly  first-time  investors  in  the  target  sectors  and  markets.  This  will  enable \nAEP II  to  reach  the  critical  mass  needed  to  create  a  diversified  portfolio  of  environmental \nservices and clean energy investments. AEP II will be considered successful if it achieves final \n\n                                                \n8  End of AEP II\u2019s life (2025), occurring 10 years from the final close (2015), but with two potential 1-year extensions. \n\n\fclose by the third quarter of 2015 and deploys its capital within the proposed 5-year investment \nperiod.9 \n \nB. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\n34. \nAEP II\u2019s investments will cover several subsectors that seek to improve living conditions \nand quality of life in part by scaling up private sector development, promote technology transfer, \nand  support  sustainable  growth  models.  The  investments  selected  through  AEP  II  will  have \nenvironmental  impact  and  sustainability  as  a  key  value  driver.  As  such,  they  are  aligned  with \nADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020,  which  seeks  to  reduce  poverty  and  improve  living \nconditions  and  quality  of  life  in  part  by  scaling  up  private  sector  development  and  supporting \nenvironmentally  sustainable  models  through  projects  that  aim  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas \nemissions and manage climate change impacts.10 \n \nInterventions  in  all  ADB\u2019s  DMCs  would  be  aligned  with  the  respective  country \n35. \npartnership  strategies,  (i.e.,  of  the  PRC,  India,  Indonesia,  the  Philippines,  Thailand,  and  Viet \nNam),  which  frequently  emphasize  climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation,  private  sector \ndevelopment, clean energy, and sustainable growth as core themes. \n  \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\n36. \nADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy  seeks  to  facilitate  the  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy  and \nuniversal access to energy as an important step toward achieving ADB\u2019s vision of a region free \nof poverty.11 The objective of the Energy Policy is to help DMCs provide reliable, adequate, and \naffordable  energy  for  inclusive  growth  in  a  socially,  economically,  and  environmentally \nsustainable  way.  To  achieve  these  objectives,  policy  implementation  will  be  based  in  part  on \nprivate  sector  participation  to  improve  energy  sector  efficiency  through  competition  and  an \nincrease \nin  DMCs.  ADB  and  other  multilateral  development \norganizations have deployed capital into the energy sector through public sector loans and other \nfinancing  mechanisms  for  clean  energy  projects.  However,  it  is  widely  recognized  that  the \nprivate sector must also join these efforts to build and sustain a low-carbon infrastructure. \n \n\ninvestable  resources \n\nin \n\n3. \n\nLessons from Previous Operations \n\nFrom a portfolio management perspective, AEP II will help ADB increase its exposure to \n37. \n(i) more established fund managers with demonstrable track record and solid base of investors \n(thereby reducing first-time-fund-manager or boutique risk), (ii) larger and more diversified funds \nwith regional exposure (thereby diluting single-country fund exposure), (iii) more recent vintages \n(thereby  diluting  the  current  concentration  of  2010\u20132012  vintages),  and  (iv)  participations  with \nco-investment rights that will enhance ADB\u2019s ability to source quality equity transactions. \n \n\n                                                \n9  AEP  II  operation  outputs  will  include  the  establishment  of  an  advisory  committee  of  investors  (para.  14)  and  an \n\nADB-approved ESMS (para. 39). \n\n10 ADB. 2014.

Under  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  an \nESMS has to be established and implemented commensurate with the impacts and risks of its \noperations and those of its portfolio companies. AEP II and its investee companies will comply \nwith the applicable laws and regulations on environment and health and safety, and AEP II will \nnot invest in any portfolio company that conducts or is involved in any activity named in ADB's \nprohibited  investment  activities  list.12 Subprojects  will  be  screened  for  risks  and  verified  during \ndue diligence. AEP II\u2019s ESMS will include provisions requiring AEP II and its portfolio companies \nto comply with national labor laws and to take measures in relation to internationally recognized \ncore  labor  standards,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy.13 The  project  is \ncategorized as having no gender elements. \n \n[This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in \n39. \nparagraph  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2011)].  Each  of  these  investment \nopportunities has its own potential environmental impacts that may arise from construction and \noperations, including the generation of domestic and hazardous solid waste, air emissions, and \nwastewater discharges and wastes. Other potential issues include threats to biodiversity, as well \nas occupational health and safety hazards. While varied, most of these impacts are site-specific \nand  can  be  avoided  or  mitigated  by  adhering  to  recognized  international  guidelines,  best \npractices, and design criteria. It is likely that a majority of AEP II\u2019s portfolio investments will be \nclassified  as  category  B  or  C.  However,  during  the  course  of  due  diligence  of  individual \ninvestment opportunities, some of these may be classified as category A. Category A projects \nwill  be  referred  to  ADB, and Safeguard  Policy  Statement requirements for  category  A  projects \nwill be followed. Additional requirements may be set for category B portfolio investments if there \nare  significant  gaps  between  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements  and  host  country \nregulations  (such  as  wind  energy  projects  in  India,  which  are  not  subject  to  environmental \nimpact assessment legislation). On social safeguards, the investment in AEP II is classified as \nFI. While the majority of AEP II\u2019s investments are unlikely to involve involuntary resettlement or \nindigenous people impacts, such impacts are possible in some cases. These will be subject to \nthe  screening,  due  diligence,  and  remedial  action  processes  set  out  in  the  ESMS  and  AEP  II \ndocumentation,  which  include  compulsory  referral  of  all  investments  categorized  as  A  for  any \nimpact  to  an  ESMS  subcommittee,  on  which  ADB  will  seek  to  participate  alongside  other \ninvestors and which will be subject to meeting ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. \nIn addition, ADB will seek to negotiate with the general partner the right to opt out of, on a case-\nby-case basis, proposed AEP II investments categorized A or B for involuntary resettlement or \nindigenous peoples. \n \n40. \nAEP  II  has  an  ESMS  in  place  that complies with IFC guidelines  and details  the  policy, \nprocedures,  and  workflow  that  are followed  for  investments  made  by  AEP  II. The  ESMS  is  an \nintegral  part  of  AEP  II\u2019s  investment  process  and  provides  guidelines  for  both  the  portfolio \ncompany  and  the  fund,  while  also  requiring  AEP  II  to  submit  to  IFC  an  annual  environmental \nand social performance report documenting the continued compliance of its investee companies \nwith  IFC\u2019s  environmental  and  social  performance  standards.  The  ESMS  will  be  amended  to \nreflect ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements and, as part of an overhaul of AEP II\u2019s \n\n                                                \n12 ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list is in Appendix 5 of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n13 ADB. 2001.
