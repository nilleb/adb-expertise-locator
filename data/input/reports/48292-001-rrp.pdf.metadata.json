I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment of up to $30,000,000 in Asia Environmental Partners II, L.P. (AEP II), not \nexceeding  25%  of  AEP  II\u2019s  total  capital  commitments  and  not  resulting  in  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) being the single largest investor in AEP II.1 \n \nII.  THE FUND \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n2.  Description. AEP II, a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership, is a closed-ended \nprivate equity fund [This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure \nspecified in paragraph 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)] that will invest in \nmiddle-market environmental services and clean energy companies in Asia. The general partner \nwill be Olympus Green Capital Partners II, L.P. (general partner), a Cayman Islands exempted \nlimited partnership. The general partner will have an investment advisory services agreement \nwith Olympus Green Investment Management Limited (investment manager), a Cayman Islands \ncompany  whose  sole  shareholder  is  Olympus  Capital  Holdings  Asia  (Olympus  Capital),  a \nCayman Islands company and a registered investment advisor with the United States Securities \nand Exchange Commission.2 \n \n3.  Investment identification. As part of its ongoing market mapping of attractive private \nequity fund investment opportunities within ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs), the \nPrivate Sector Operations Department has had an ongoing dialogue with Olympus Capital, a \nleading  pan-Asian  middle-market  private  equity  firm,  and  has  followed  with  interest  the \nsuccessful  track  record  of  Asia  Environmental  Partners,  L.P.  (AEP),  the  $252  million \npredecessor fund to AEP II launched by Olympus Capital in 2008. \n \n4.  In the screening exercise for funds operating in this sector, Olympus Capital ranked very \nhigh  with  clear  advantages  over  its  direct  competitors  in  terms  of  track  record,  regional \nexperience, access to proprietary deal flow, and investor base. [This information has been \nremoved as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public \nCommunications Policy (2011)].  \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n5.  Strong growth rates in energy demand, combined with a push toward cleaner energy \ngeneration, energy efficiency, and resource conservation, are creating a substantial investment \nneed in countries such as the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and India. Because public \nsector funding to meet this need is often insufficient, the private sector will have a crucial role to \nplay in mobilizing additional resources. In 2013, new investments in clean energy within the Asia \nand Pacific region made up $121 billion of the $255 billion invested globally, representing a \nmore than sixfold increase in the investment level for the Asia and Pacific region since 2004.3 \nThis continued strong growth is in part a result of ambitious policy measures and targets in \nplace across key DMCs, covering renewable energy, as well as energy, water, and other types \nof resource efficiency. As public awareness and government attention increasingly shift to Asia\u2019s \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  [This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph 97(v) of ADB\u2019s \nPublic Communications Policy (2011)]. \n3  Bloomberg New Energy Finance. 2014.

London. \n \n \n ", "2 \nsignificant environmental and natural resource challenges, the sectors targeted by AEP II\u2014\nclean energy and environmental services\u2014can therefore be expected to grow at a multiple of 2\u2013\n3  times  of gross  domestic  product growth rates,  in  part  also  as  a  result  of  low  historical \ninvestment levels.4 \n \n6.  AEP  II  intends  to  invest  in  a  balanced  portfolio  of  7\u201310  middle-market  growth \ncompanies, with a focus on the PRC, India, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN).  [This  information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  within  exceptions  to  disclosure \nspecified  in  paragraph  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2011)].  Targeted \nsubsectors will include (i) renewable energy projects, services, distribution, and associated \nequipment;  (ii)  solid  and  hazardous  waste  management;  (iii)  recycling  services;  (iv) water \nmanagement,  services,  and  equipment;  (v)  energy-efficiency  products  and  services;  (vi) \npollution control and prevention devices and services; and (vii) consumer products with low-\ncarbon impact. AEP II will focus on established and profitable operations in these subsectors, \ninvesting in a combination of asset-based (primarily brownfield) companies and providers of \nservices or equipment. Building on an emerging trend to consolidate Asian private investment in \nenvironmental services, AEP II will, where appropriate and akin to the strategy pursued in AEP, \nbuild regional platform clusters around a specific growth opportunity. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n1.  Ownership \n7.  AEP  II  will  comprise  strategic  investors,  foundations,  family  offices,  and  other \ninstitutional  investors.  [This  information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  within  exceptions  to \ndisclosure specified in paragraph 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)].  \n \n8.  The Cayman Islands has been categorized as  largely compliant with internationally \nagreed tax standards in the latest progress report prepared by the Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development\u2019s Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information \nfor Tax Purposes.5 ADB\u2019s review of AEP II does not give ADB cause to believe that it has been \nestablished, or is being used, for cross-border tax evasion, money laundering, or terrorism \nfinancing in the jurisdictions involved in the investment (footnote 2). \n \n2.  Management \n9.  AEP II is sponsored by Olympus Capital, a leading independent private equity investor in \nmiddle-market  companies  across  Asia.  Since  its  founding  in  1997,  Olympus  Capital  has \ninvested more than $1.8 billion of equity capital on behalf of its funds and co-investors in over \n40 portfolio companies throughout Asia, including the PRC, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, \nand Southeast Asia. It is one of the few regional private equity fund managers to have delivered \nconsistent profits across the key markets in which it invests, through multiple economic cycles. \n[This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in \nparagraph 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. Olympus Capital has one of \nthe longest-standing teams in Asian private equity, comprising 33 investment professionals and \n                                                \n4  [This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph 97(viii) of \nADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. \n5  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 2013.

", "3 \nover 20 senior advisors across offices in Hong Kong, New Delhi, New York, Seoul, Shanghai, \nSingapore, and Tokyo. \n \n10.  The proposed core team for AEP II consists of eight investments professionals across \nOlympus Capital\u2019s offices in Hong Kong, New Delhi, Shanghai, and Singapore. The team will be \nled by Frederick Long [This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to \ndisclosure specified in paragraph 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. The \nAEP  team  has  an  extensive  private  equity  investment  track  record,  combined  with  deep \nexperience,  knowledge,  and  strong  relationships  in  the  clean  energy  and  environmental \nservices  sectors,  including  through  eight  investments  made  under  AEP.  AEP  II  will  also \nleverage the experience of the broader Olympus Capital team, drawing on a wide range of \ncommercial experience gained from investment, financial, and operational roles, ensuring a \nbroad perspective on investments. Olympus Capital\u2019s nine managing directors have worked \ntogether at the firm for an average of 14 years (five of them have worked at Olympus Capital \nsince 1998) and bring over 200 years of collective commercial experience, primarily in investing \nand managing companies in Asia. \n \n11.  Olympus Capital takes a highly proactive and hands-on approach to adding strategic \nand  operational  value  to  its  investee  companies.  Through  its  representation  on  investee \ncompany boards, as well as commitment of substantial team resources\u2014typically including two \nmanaging  directors  per  investment\u2014Olympus  Capital  works  closely  with  the  respective \nmanagement  on  achieving  organic  and  inorganic  growth,  developing  strategies,  recruiting \nmanagement  staff  (80  senior  hires  into  portfolio  companies  to  date),  deepening  financial \ncontrols  and  strengthening  internal  systems,  accessing  financing  and  capital  markets,  and \nimproving environmental standards. \n \n3.  Governance Structure \n12.  Olympus Capital will follow a typical three-stage investment process developed and \nrefined in its 17-year history: (i) investment screening of each potential portfolio company\u2019s \noperations, products, market opportunity, and valuation against AEP II\u2019s mandate and strategy; \n(ii)  deal  structuring  and  due  diligence;  and  (iii)  preparation  of  investment  proposals  for \npresentation to AEP II\u2019s investment committee. \n \n13.  Olympus  Capital\u2019s  distinct  competitive  advantages  in  adding  value  to  its  portfolio \ncompanies are its ability to draw on the experience of its more than 20 senior advisors (six of \nwhom will be dedicated to AEP II). The senior advisors bring extensive operational and sector-\nspecific experience and are instrumental in providing potential deal flow opportunities, as well as \nstrategic support and insight pre- and post-investment. \n \n14.  In addition to its investment committee, AEP II will also establish an advisory committee \nconsisting of at least five (and potentially up to 10) individuals selected by the general partner as \nrepresentatives of the limited partners. ADB will expect to be represented on the advisory \ncommittee.6 \n \n15.  Being registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Olympus \nCapital  is  required  to  fully  comply  with  its  provisions  on  combating  corruption,  money \n                                                \n6  The role of the advisory committee is to represent the interests of AEP II\u2019s investors, addressing issues such as \nconflicts of interest, valuations, and AEP II\u2019s progress in achieving its investment objectives. It will not participate in \nAEP II\u2019s investment process or make investment decisions.

After  reviewing  Olympus  Capital's  policies  on \nscreening for integrity, money laundering, and financing of terrorism risks, ADB is satisfied that \nsufficient checks and measures are in place (footnote 2). ADB will require appropriate auditing \nof the implementation of such policies. \n \nD.  Financial Performance \n16.  Olympus  Capital,  through  funds  under  its  management,  makes  private  equity \ninvestments  in  its  three  core  sectors:  (i)  environmental  services  and  clean  energy, \n(ii) agribusiness, and (iii) financial and business services. It has developed a track record of \neffectively exiting investments at attractive returns, investing more than $1.8 billion of capital on \nbehalf of its funds and co-investors in more than 40 portfolio companies across Asia within a \nrange  of  subsectors.  [This  information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  within  exceptions  to \ndisclosure  specified  in  paragraph  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2011)]. \nOlympus Capital\u2019s first fund with a focus on the clean energy and environmental services \nsectors, AEP, recently completed its investment period, having made eight investments [This \ninformation has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph \n97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)] into companies involved in subsectors \nsuch  as  renewable  energy,  water  and  wastewater  treatment,  and  waste-to-energy.7 [This \ninformation has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph \n97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. Benchmarked against current trading \nmultiples for comparable companies, a number of the AEP investments hold significant upside \nvalue potential, based on their projected exit multiples. This is particularly the case for AEP \nplatform investments that have secured market-leading competitive positions, such as [This \ninformation has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph \n97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2011)]  in  the  Chinese  small-  to  mid-tier \nhydropower generation market. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n17.  ADB will provide an equity investment of up to $30,000,000 in AEP II, not exceeding \n25% of AEP II\u2019s total capital commitments and not resulting in ADB being the single largest \ninvestor in AEP II. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis of Expected Returns and Assumptions \n18.  AEP II is expected to achieve similar performance results as targeted by AEP. Overall \nreturn expectations for AEP II are anticipated to align with the performance of Olympus Capital\u2019s \nthree legacy regional funds. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  AEP II has a 10-year term from the final close, with two options to extend for a maximum \nof  1  year  each.  Olympus  Capital  anticipates  that  the  principal  exit  strategies  for  AEP  II\u2019s \ninvestments will include both trade sales to strategic buyers, which have accounted for some \n70% of Olympus Capital\u2019s previous exits, and initial public offerings on Asian stock exchanges. \n                                                \n7  As at 30 June 2013. [This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in \nparagraph 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. ", "5 \n \n20.  ADB will require AEP II to provide it with (i) quarterly unaudited reports and (ii) audited \nannual reports, including financial statements, a fund overview, and an overview of the portfolio \nwith brief information on each portfolio company\u2019s performance and valuation. ADB will review \nthis information and will follow up with the investment manager to clarify when more information \nis needed. If information received from the investment manager points to issues that could \nimpair the value of ADB\u2019s investment, ADB will decide whether to put AEP II on a watch list for \nmore frequent review and closer attention. \n \n21.  The general partner will be required to adopt an environmental and social management \nsystem  (ESMS)  satisfactory  to  ADB,  and  to  report  annually  on  ESMS  implementation, \nparticularly relating to safeguards and other social requirements, and development effectiveness \nindicators. ADB will monitor the receipt and quality of the ESMS reports and offer guidance if the \ngeneral partner requires clarification on ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. \n \nD.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n22.  Capital  mobilization.  ADB\u2019s  presence  and  reputation  as  an  investor  in  Asian \ndeveloping countries will add value in relation to AEP II\u2019s capital mobilization by providing a \nsignaling effect and comfort to other prospective investors, validating the environmental and \nsocial governance framework and development impact against a backdrop of strong financial \nreturns.  As  such,  it  is  a  prime  example  of  ADB\u2019s  \u201cFinance++\u201d  concept  of  leveraging  the \ninstitution\u2019s reputation and capital to mobilize third-party investment activity in DMCs. ADB\u2019s \ninvestment is expected to help mobilize at least $90 million in additional commitments from final-\nclose investors, and, based on the track record of AEP, a similar amount from co-investors into \nAEP  II\u2019s  portfolio  companies.  Additionally  this  investment  will  allow  ADB  to  secure  co-\ninvestment rights for commercially attractive opportunities sourced by AEP II, and so enhance \nits own equity deal pipeline. \n \n23.  Policy and regulatory insight. The environmental services and clean energy markets \nare frequently underpinned by distinct policy and regulatory frameworks, which act as key value \ndrivers  for  companies  and  investments  within  these  sectors.  Through  its  presence  as  an \ninvestor in AEP II, ADB can draw on its extensive regional network and deep understanding of \nlocal regulatory frameworks to provide guidance to AEP II on policy issues. \n \n24.  Raising standards. ADB\u2019s presence as a substantial investor in AEP II obligates the \ngeneral partner to ensure that its investee companies comply with environmental and social \nsafeguard standards, and to report on development indicators. Along with other members of \nAEP II\u2019s advisory committee, ADB\u2019s role will be to assist in providing oversight on raising \ngovernance and management standards that are essential for companies to demonstrate as \nthey seek additional sources of growth capital from institutional and/or individual investors. \n \nE.

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n31.  The development impact of the investment will be increased availability of private equity \nfinancing  for  environmental  projects  across  targeted  DMCs.  Specifically,  an  additional \n$200 million is expected to be invested in environment-related companies through private equity \nfunds by 2029. The promotion of private equity participation in environmental funding will help \nfacilitate balanced and sustainable economic development in the targeted DMCs.  \n \n2.  Outcome \n32.  The outcome of the investment will be sustainable growth and profitability of AEP II\u2019s \ninvestee companies. AEP II will achieve positive financial returns with meaningful associated \nenvironmental  and  social  benefits.  The  private  equity  modality  is  expected  to  benefit \nenvironmental services and clean energy companies in the PRC, India, and ASEAN by (i) \ncreating sustainable long-term value; (ii) driving technological innovation and deployment of low-\ncarbon  and  resource-efficient  solutions,  products,  and  services;  and  (iii)  transferring \ninternational  best  practice  governance,  environmental,  and  social  standards  to  portfolio \ncompanies. At the conclusion of this investment,8 AEP II is envisaged to fully exit its investment \nportfolio at a minimum net IRR of 8%, with 100% of AEP II\u2019s investee companies establishing at \nleast  one  baseline  metric  to  gauge  delivery  of  low-carbon  or  sustainability  services,  as \napplicable (e.g., volume of waste or water treated, megawatt-hours of clean energy generated, \nmegawatt-hours saved through energy-efficiency measures). AEP II is also expected to improve \nthe corporate governance and transparency of its investee companies, wherever needed, and \ncontribute to overall (net) job creation and tax contributions in the countries in which it invests. \n \n3.  Outputs \n33.  The output is that AEP II is established as planned and its capital invested. ADB\u2019s \nparticipation will send positive signals to the market, catalyzing investments from additional \ninvestors, particularly first-time investors in the target sectors and markets. This will enable \nAEP II to reach the critical mass needed to  create a diversified portfolio of  environmental \nservices and clean energy investments. AEP II will be considered successful if it achieves final \n                                                \n8  End of AEP II\u2019s life (2025), occurring 10 years from the final close (2015), but with two potential 1-year extensions.

Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n34.  AEP II\u2019s investments will cover several subsectors that seek to improve living conditions \nand quality of life in part by scaling up private sector development, promote technology transfer, \nand support sustainable growth models. The investments selected through AEP II will have \nenvironmental impact and sustainability as a key value driver. As such, they are aligned with \nADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which seeks to reduce poverty and improve living \nconditions and quality of life in part by scaling up private sector development and supporting \nenvironmentally  sustainable  models  through  projects  that  aim  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas \nemissions and manage climate change impacts.10 \n \n35.  Interventions  in  all  ADB\u2019s  DMCs  would  be  aligned  with  the  respective  country \npartnership strategies, (i.e., of the PRC, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet \nNam), which frequently emphasize climate change mitigation and adaptation, private sector \ndevelopment, clean energy, and sustainable growth as core themes. \n  \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n36.  ADB\u2019s Energy Policy seeks to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy and \nuniversal access to energy as an important step toward achieving ADB\u2019s vision of a region free \nof poverty.11 The objective of the Energy Policy is to help DMCs provide reliable, adequate, and \naffordable  energy  for  inclusive  growth  in  a  socially,  economically,  and  environmentally \nsustainable way. To achieve these objectives, policy implementation will be based in part on \nprivate sector participation to improve energy sector efficiency through competition and an \nincrease  in  investable  resources  in  DMCs.  ADB  and  other  multilateral  development \norganizations have deployed capital into the energy sector through public sector loans and other \nfinancing mechanisms for clean energy projects. However, it is widely recognized that the \nprivate sector must also join these efforts to build and sustain a low-carbon infrastructure. \n \n3.  Lessons from Previous Operations \n37.  From a portfolio management perspective, AEP II will help ADB increase its exposure to \n(i) more established fund managers with demonstrable track record and solid base of investors \n(thereby reducing first-time-fund-manager or boutique risk), (ii) larger and more diversified funds \nwith regional exposure (thereby diluting single-country fund exposure), (iii) more recent vintages \n(thereby diluting the current concentration of 2010\u20132012 vintages), and (iv) participations with \nco-investment rights that will enhance ADB\u2019s ability to source quality equity transactions. \n \n                                                \n9  AEP II operation outputs will include the establishment of an advisory committee of investors (para. 14) and an \nADB-approved ESMS (para. 39). \n10 ADB. 2014.

Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n38.  AEP II will be required to comply with the applicable national laws and regulations, as \nwell as ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Under the Safeguard Policy Statement, an \nESMS has to be established and implemented commensurate with the impacts and risks of its \noperations and those of its portfolio companies. AEP II and its investee companies will comply \nwith the applicable laws and regulations on environment and health and safety, and AEP II will \nnot invest in any portfolio company that conducts or is involved in any activity named in ADB's \nprohibited investment activities list.12 Subprojects will be screened for risks and verified during \ndue diligence. AEP II\u2019s ESMS will include provisions requiring AEP II and its portfolio companies \nto comply with national labor laws and to take measures in relation to internationally recognized \ncore labor standards, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.13 The project is \ncategorized as having no gender elements. \n \n39.

Each of these investment \nopportunities has its own potential environmental impacts that may arise from construction and \noperations, including the generation of domestic and hazardous solid waste, air emissions, and \nwastewater discharges and wastes. Other potential issues include threats to biodiversity, as well \nas occupational health and safety hazards. While varied, most of these impacts are site-specific \nand  can  be  avoided  or  mitigated  by  adhering  to  recognized  international  guidelines,  best \npractices, and design criteria. It is likely that a majority of AEP II\u2019s portfolio investments will be \nclassified  as  category  B  or  C.  However,  during  the  course  of  due  diligence  of  individual \ninvestment opportunities, some of these may be classified as category A. Category A projects \nwill be referred to ADB, and Safeguard Policy Statement requirements for category A projects \nwill be followed. Additional requirements may be set for category B portfolio investments if there \nare  significant  gaps  between  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements  and  host  country \nregulations (such as wind energy projects in India, which are not subject to environmental \nimpact assessment legislation). On social safeguards, the investment in AEP II is classified as \nFI. While the majority of AEP II\u2019s investments are unlikely to involve involuntary resettlement or \nindigenous people impacts, such impacts are possible in some cases. These will be subject to \nthe screening, due diligence, and remedial action processes set out in the ESMS and AEP II \ndocumentation, which include compulsory referral of all investments categorized as A for any \nimpact to an ESMS subcommittee, on which ADB  will  seek to participate alongside  other \ninvestors and which will be subject to meeting ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. \nIn addition, ADB will seek to negotiate with the general partner the right to opt out of, on a case-\nby-case basis, proposed AEP II investments categorized A or B for involuntary resettlement or \nindigenous peoples. \n \n40.  AEP II has an ESMS in place that complies with IFC guidelines and details the policy, \nprocedures, and workflow that are followed for investments made by AEP II. The ESMS is an \nintegral part of AEP II\u2019s investment process and provides guidelines  for both the portfolio \ncompany and the fund, while also requiring AEP II to submit to IFC an annual environmental \nand social performance report documenting the continued compliance of its investee companies \nwith IFC\u2019s environmental and social performance standards. The ESMS will be amended to \nreflect ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements and, as part of an overhaul of AEP II\u2019s \n                                                \n12 ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list is in Appendix 5 of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n13 ADB. 2001.
