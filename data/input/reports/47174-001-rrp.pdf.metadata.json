THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Mongolia for the Regional Improvement of Border Services Project.1 \n \n2.  Enhancing efficiency and transparency of trade processes and procedures is essential to \nfacilitate cross-border trade along the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) \ncorridors and reduce trade transaction costs in Mongolia. The proposed project will tackle the \ncore problem of inefficient trade processes by rehabilitating facilities and providing modern \nequipment to three major border-crossing points (BCPs), upgrading the Customs Automated \nInformation System, and conducting preparatory work for the establishment of a single-window \nsystem for trade-related regulatory requirements. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Development challenges. Located between the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and \nthe Russian Federation, Mongolia is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world. \nBecause Mongolia is vast (1.5 million square kilometers) and landlocked, regional economic \ncooperation and trade are critical in promoting inclusive economic growth. Geography adds \ndramatically to the development challenges since it drives up trade transaction costs.  \n \n4.  International trade has always been important for the Mongolian economy given its \nabundance of natural resources and its agriculture sector.2 In recent years, much progress has \nbeen made to liberalize trade regimes and conclude free trade agreements with trading partners \nsuch as Japan, which would help Mongolia boost exports.3 However, market access alone is not \na sufficient condition for harnessing the benefits of trade for development. Poor trade facilitation \nsignificantly reduces Mongolia\u2019s competitiveness in global markets. Improving connectivity and \ncross-border cooperation will therefore help lower these high costs. \n   \n5.   Mongolia is a member of the CAREC program. Under the framework of CAREC, the \nTransport and Trade Facilitation Strategy 20204 focuses on the development of six CAREC \ncorridors  through  infrastructure  investments  and  trade facilitation  initiatives,  to  improve  the \nmovement of goods and people through and across these corridors. In addition, the National \nRoad Action Plan aims to improve transport services, reduce vehicle operationing costs, and \nprovide regional links to connect Mongolia with the neighboring foreign seaports. \n \n6.  CAREC Corridor 4, designated for Mongolia, has 2,400 kilometers (km) of roads and \n1,100 km of railways.5 At present, Mongolia relies on the road and rail corridor from Ulaanbaatar \nto Zamiin-Uud to carry most of its trade with the PRC, and from Ulaanbaatar to Altanbulag for \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Between 2009 and 2015, imports and exports more than doubled, with exports increasing from about $1.9 billion to \n$4.7 billion and imports from $1.1 billion to $3.8 billion. Total trade over gross national product since 2000 was \nabout 115% on average, although it declined from 130% in 2004 to 100% in 2014. \n3  Mongolia acceded to the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement in 2013. It signed a free trade agreement with Japan in \n2015. \n4  CAREC and ADB. 2014. CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy 2020. Manila. \n5  Corridor 4: Russian Federation\u2013East Asia (Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous \nRegion in the People\u2019s Republic of China, and Mongolia). ", "2 \ntrade  with  the  Russian  Federation  (CAREC  Corridor  4B).  The  ongoing  Regional  Logistics \nDevelopment Project6 supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will develop a modern \nlogistics facility at Zamiin-Uud, which will lead to more efficient transport and logistics services.  \n \n7.  In addition, once completed, the Eastern Regional Road Corridor, designated as CAREC \nCorridor 4C, will link Ulaanbaatar with the PRC at Bichigt (Sukhbaatar Aimag), where there are \nroad  and  nearby  rail  connections  with  the  PRC\u2019s  northeast.  The  government  has  already \ncompleted the 555 km section from Ulaanbaatar to Baruun-Urt, and the remaining 276 km \nsection from Baruun-Urt to Bichigt will be developed with ADB\u2019s support. Bichigt BCP is already \nfunctioning and has become increasingly important for trade with the PRC. \n \n8.  Despite the significant improvements made on transport connectivity, the cost of trade is \nstill high in Mongolia. In the 2016 World Bank Doing Business Report, Mongolia ranked 74th out \nof 189 countries on the ease of trading across borders.7 The Logistics Performance Index 2014 \nranks Mongolia 135th out of 160 countries, and Mongolia has one of the poorest scores for \ncustoms  clearance  and  border  crossing,  resulting  in  major  delays.8 Excessive  physical \ninspections represent a major source of delay and impose heavy costs on traders.  \n \n9.  Border-crossing points. The data from CAREC\u2019s corridor performance measurement \nand monitoring (CPMM) 9 identify the major barriers that prevent the smooth flow of goods along \nthese corridors. CPMM data show marked improvements in the cost and speed of trucks \nmoving  along  CAREC  Corridor  4B  from  2013  to  2014,  mainly  thanks  to  improvements  in \ntransport infrastructure. But the data also show that other bottlenecks remain. BCPs were found \nto be the major barrier to transport and trade. For instance, average border-crossing time at \nMongolian borders in 2014 stood at 4.8 hours in Altanbulag, at 3.7 hours in Bichigt, and at \n8.7 hours in Zamiin-Uud. At other BCPs bordering the PRC, border-crossing time stood at \n6.8 hours in Khorgos (Kazakhstan), at 6.1 hours in Irkeshtan (Kyrgyz Republic), and at 1.4 \nhours in Torugart (Kyrgyz Republic). Border-crossing time at Bichigt is currently shorter than at \nother  countries\u2019  BCPs  with  PRC  given  the  lower  trade  volume  with  PRC  through  Bichigt. \nHowever, once the road section is completed, trade with PRC\u2019s northeast is expected to rise \nsubstantially, hence the need to address border related inefficiencies in advance. \n \n10.  According to CPMM data, a significant portion of delays is attributable to poor physical \ninfrastructure at the BCPs and old and inefficient equipment preventing customs officials to \nconduct their functions effectively. Another reason for delays at the borders is the low levels of \nutilization of information and communication technology (ICT). Delays at BCPs impose heavy \ncosts on traders relating largely to spoilage, storage, securing of goods while in transit, and the \npayment of accompanying fees. Efficient international trade procedures and customs operations \ncan significantly reduce trade transaction costs, which in turn could result in increased volumes \nof trade and welfare gains. \n \n                                                \n6   ADB. 2010.

Customs  automation.  The  Mongolian  Customs  General  Administration,  with  ADB \nsupport, embarked on the largest ICT project to date.10 The Customs Automated Information \nSystem  (CAIS)  was  officially  launched  in  2010,  and  the  data  center  hardware  was  since \nupgraded, particularly the servers and storage devices. The software, however, was upgraded \nin 2013 and funded with internal resources and some upgrades were made in 2016.11 Several \nuser enhancements were rolled out, including functional features such as the expansion of the \nCustoms  External  Portal  interfaces,  and  the  implementation  of  the  e-manifest.  The \ncommunication infrastructure of the CAIS should be improved to boost application performance \nresponse by improving the design of applications and programming code, and applying system-\nlevel upgrades, and by preparing the application and external interfaces necessary as new \nbusiness rules and complimentary systems such as the single window are introduced. \n \n12.  In addition, the Mongolian Customs General Administration was merged with the Tax \nAuthority in January 2016 to create the General Authority of Customs and Taxation (GACT). As \nboth institutions were using separate ICT platforms, both systems need to be interoperable to \nbe able to share relevant information. The interconnection and interoperability of both systems \nis challenging and requires support.   \n \n13.  National single window. According to the World Bank Doing Business Indicators, it \ntakes 37 hours to prepare and process export documents, and 22 hours for import documents. \nThe government is interested in implementing a national single-window system as an effective \nmeans of minimizing time and cost involved in international trade. A single window12 helps \ncoordinate the processing of data and information needed to meet trade-related regulatory \nrequirements with a single entry point for traders. The implementation of a single window would \nlead to greater simplification of trade processes and procedures, and greater transparency and \npredictability in international trade transactions. This means fewer complexities, fewer delays, \nand lower costs, which in turn will lead to greater export competitiveness, increased trade, more \njobs, and ultimately economic growth.  \n \n14.  However, the interagency nature of the single window requires extensive engagement \nand  coordination  of  stakeholders  from  both  public  and  private  sectors,  which  can  pose  a \nchallenge. International experience suggests to adopt a pragmatic and incremental approach to \nthe development of a single window. Therefore, preparatory work is highly relevant to build trust \nand understanding between agencies and establish an appropriate legal framework before \nlaunching a single window system. \n \n15.  National effort in regional and international perspective. To tackle similar challenges \nin CAREC member countries, ADB formulated the CAREC Regional Improvement of Border \nServices (RIBS) Project in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, which is intended to streamline, \nin a coordinated manner, transport, customs, and other border control operations along CAREC \ncorridors and thereby increase trade in Central Asia.13 Separately, ADB has approved a RIBS \n                                                \n10  ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n11 These upgrades were supported by the Korea International Cooperation Agency. \n12  As specified in the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business Recommendation Number \n33, the single window is a facility that allows parties involved in trade and transport to lodge standardized \ninformation and documents with a single entry point to fulfill all import, export, and transit-related regulatory \nrequirements. If information is electronic, then individual data elements should only be submitted once. \n13 ADB. 2013.

Manila. \n ", "4 \nproject to improve selected Pakistan BCPs that support trade with Afghanistan and India.14 ADB \nis also supporting a project to modernize sanitary and phytosanitary inspections of import and \nexports of agri-food products in Mongolia, aiming at rehabilitating inspection and quarantine \nfacilities at Altanbulag and Zamiin-Uud and laboratories in the aimags (provinces) serving these \nBCPs.15 Based on these experiences, the Government of Mongolia requested ADB to support \nthe proposed RIBS project. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s interim country partnership \nstrategy for Mongolia, 2014\u20132016;16 its country operations business plan, 2015;17 and with \nCAREC\u2019s Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy 2020 (footnote 4). \n \n16.  Lessons. Many lessons can be learned from past and ongoing technical assistance \nrelated to customs reforms and modernization supported by ADB and development partners. \nRegarding the development of a single-window system, three lessons are key. First, achieving \nmeaningful results depends principally on building genuine collaboration between stakeholders. \nSecond,  for  the  single  window  to  become  operative,  establishing  a  legal  framework  is \nimperative. Third, donor coordination is decisive since different business models are needed \nand consensus must be achieved. From a customs reform perspective, three lessons are key. \nFirst, encouraging and enabling public\u2013private dialogue, which leads to mutually beneficial \nalliances,  is  vital.  Second,  ICT  departments  should  have  enough  capacity  to  operate  the \nautomation systems and ensure sustainability. Finally, business process reengineering must be \nconducted in line with international standards to maximize harmonization of customs procedures \nacross borders. \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n17.  The impact will be increased trade and competitiveness as a result of faster and cost-\nefficient  cross-border  services. The  intended project  outcome  is reduced  cost  and time  of \ncompliance with trade procedures.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n18.  The project will have three outputs. \n \n19.  Output 1: Facilities and equipment at Altanbulag, Bichigt, and Zamiin-Uud BCPs \nare upgraded and improved. Infrastructure and equipment at the three BCPs are relatively old \nand considered inefficient. Cooperation between border agencies is also limited. Investments \nwill  focus  on  (i)  rehabilitation  and  reorganization  of  BCP  facilities  to  strengthen  customs \nprocessing capacity and facilitate trade in line with modern customs practices,18 as well as \ncreate a gender-sensitive environment;19 and (ii) provision of modern equipment to enable \ncustoms officials to undertake their control function effectively and reduce reliance on manual \nchecks. Training of customs officers on the use of newly acquired equipment and modern \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2015.

Separation systems between passengers and vehicles during entry and exit will be provided as well \nas independent electricity supply units. Checking and examination zones for cargo are to be covered with a canopy \nto serve as sheltered passageways. \n19 Separate lanes and inspection for women traders, and adequate washroom facilities for women. \n ", "5 \ncustoms practices (i.e., risk management techniques, coordinated border management, and \nawareness raising on human trafficking) will also be conducted.  \n20.  Output 2: Communication infrastructure for CAIS is improved and GACT systems \nare  interoperable. The core CAIS application modules will be upgraded to provide added \nfunctionalities for more operational efficiency. The CAIS system will be made single-window-\nready, and capacity will be boosted to prepare for anticipated higher volume. In this regard, \noperating and processing capacity will be increased through system software installations and \nhardware upgrades alongside network upgrades. Improvements in the customer support center \nwill be undertaken through call center analysis and design, as well as help desk and customer \nsupport software. The customs external portal system will be upgraded to allow public viewing \nof trade information and reports. Technical training will be provided to boost the capacity of ICT \nstaff at GACT. Advisory support will help develop the interconnectivity and interoperability of \ninformation systems at the customs and taxation authorities. A business process integration \nstrategy will be formulated, which will inform the ICT systems' interconnection process. \n \n21.  Output  3: Preparatory work  for  single window is  undertaken. A revised single-\nwindow model will be prepared to involve, in principle, the key trade-related agencies20 and \nprivate sector entities involved in the supply chain. Analysis will be undertaken to redesign \nprocesses  and  procedures  to  incorporate  a  coordinated  border  management  approach  to \noperations, including cargo examinations and information sharing. The current documentary \nrequirements for all agencies will also be examined to streamline them into an agreed set of \ndocuments needed to clear cargo.21 Preparation for the single window will also include an \nagreement from most agencies involved in trade to work together, share information, and link \ncurrent information technology systems. An agreement should be reached on the lead agency \nto manage the single window, and on the financial implications of maintaining and upgrading the \nsystem.  The  development  of  a  single  window  in  Mongolia  will  be  based  on  functional \nrequirements established in these preparations. Preparatory work will lay the ground for the \nimplementation of a single-window platform (hardware, operating systems, and infrastructure) \nas well as single-window applications such as e-licensing, e-signature, e-logistics, 22 e-payment, \nand single-window reporting. \n \n22.  Project management activities. The project will support the establishment of a project \nimplementation unit (PIU) to effectively manage, implement, monitor, and evaluate the project. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n23.  The project is estimated to cost $29.07 million (Table 1). \n \n                                                \n20  Such as GACT, General Agency for Specialized Inspection, Veterinary and Animal Breeding Agency, Chamber of \nCommerce, and Office of Immigration.   \n21 The World Customs Organization Data Model provides guidance in this area. \n22 e-logistics involves developing logistics information exchange platforms, develop transportation registration, point-\nto-point monitoring and tracking. \n \n ", "6 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n28.  The  Mongolian  Customs  General  Administration  has  embarked  on  reforms  and \nmodernization to ease the flow of goods across borders. By using information technology in \nparticular, it managed to improve operational efficiency and effectiveness. \n \n29.   The  operations  of  customs  and  other  border  agencies  at  the  three  BCPs  were \nassessed, particularly in relation to how the flow of goods and people through the border might \nbe improved and contribute to trade facilitation objectives. Based on customs performance and \nindividual needs for improvement, and an evaluation of current capacity, equipment will be \n                                                \n23 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nprocured to enable each BCP to carry out inspections faster and more efficiently.24 Staff will be \ntrained to use the equipment in the prescribed manner. \n \n30.  The preparatory work for a single window is an opportunity to review processes and \ntrade procedures and align them with international standards and facilitate trade. The processes \nrelated to customs clearance at the borders need alignment with international best practices, \nparticularly in terms of risk management.25 Training and capacity building in risk management \nand profiling techniques was provided to staff at most customs levels. The introduction of a \nsingle window is timely and helps incorporate a functional risk management approach into \noperational policies and procedures at the BCPs, which will reduce the cargo-examination time.  \n \n31.  A single window transcends ICT and involves change management across different \nstakeholders. This requires adequate policies and a legal framework. An information exchange \nplatform to share data across different agencies needs to be developed as well.  \n \n32.  At the center of establishing a national single window is CAIS. It is fundamental given its \ncentral  role  in  transacting  and  receiving  regulatory  documents  for  international  trade.  As \nbusiness requirements evolve, CAIS needs to be improved to ensure a workable single window \nfor trade. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n33.  The anticipated economic benefits of the project include a reduction in trade costs by \nlowering the working capital needs of exporters and importers, a reduction in operating costs for \nroad  and  railway  transport  companies  involved  in  international  shipments,  and  increased \nproductivity of GACT staff. By lowering trade costs and time, the project will indirectly help \nMongolia boost production and export of manufactured products, diversify exports away from \nmineral products, reinvigorate the economy, and insulate it from swings in world mineral prices. \n \n34.  The economic analysis resulted in an economic internal rate of return of 14.3% and a net \npresent value of $1.7 million. The investments are considered economically justifiable. \n \n35.  The financial sustainability of the project was assessed at both a fiscal and project level. \nThe government has committed to provide the necessary recurrent funds following project \ncompletion to ensure that the benefits of the investment are sustained. \n  \nC.  Governance \n36.  A  financial  management  assessment  conducted  for  GACT  confirms  that  it  has \nadequately functioning financial accounting and reporting systems and procedures, which are \ncomputerized and managed by accounting professionals. The entity- and project-specific risks \nare rated moderate (pre-mitigation) because the post-merger reorganization process of setting \nup joint administrative and managerial arrangements is ongoing, while weaknesses were found \nin annual planning and budgeting processes, accounting policy documentation, internal audit, \nreporting,  and  accounting  information  systems.  These  weaknesses  will  be  dealt  with  by \nestablishing the PIU, which will assume regular financial management responsibilities. Along \n                                                \n24 Including but not limited to x-ray machines, testing equipment for narcotics and explosives, closed-circuit television, \nand base station monitors and surveillance. \n25 The  World  Customs  Organization  defines  risk  management  as  the  systematic  application  of  management \nprocedures and practices that provide customs with the necessary information to deal with movements or \nconsignments that present a risk. \n ", "9 \nwith additionally proposed risk management measures, this will provide safeguards against \nfiduciary risks.  \n \n37.  The PIU will be equipped with an integrated financial management system and staffed \nby qualified professionals\u2014including a project manager, finance specialist, and performance \nmonitoring specialist\u2014to ensure that the project is implemented in compliance with ADB\u2019s \noperational and procedural requirements. Given the PIU and proposed risk mitigation measures, \nthe project financial management risk is considered to be low, and the planned arrangements \nsatisfactory. \n \n38.  All procurement to be financed by ADB will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). All consulting services to be \nfinanced under the project will be engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Project implementation, procurement, and \nfinancial management will be aligned with the government\u2019s standard operating procedures. \nAuditors acceptable to ADB will audit the project accounts annually. The project will strengthen \nstaff capacity in financial management procedures, and will use existing government websites to \n(i) disclose implementation progress, and bid notifications and results; and (ii) provide channels \nto report corrupt practices. \n \n39.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 23). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n40.  The project will enable increased trade along the CAREC corridors and will reduce the \ncost and time of compliance with trade procedures at major BCPs. More efficient importing and \nexporting through trade facilitation will decrease trade transaction costs and benefit the traders, \nand will generate employment. Moreover, by eliminating physical and administrative obstacles \nto trade at BCPs, the project will help lower import prices, in particular those of essential goods. \nSocial and gender development measures are included in a social development action plan, \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 23). \n \nE.  Safeguards  \n41.  The project is classified as category C for the environment since there will be minimal or \nno adverse environmental impacts. The climate risk screening has indicated a medium risk for \nclimate change impacts for Bichigt and Zamiin-Uud, and a high risk for Altanbulag. Climate \nchange risks include increased snow loading, melting permafrost, and flooding. Results and \nrecommendations of the climate risk and vulnerability assessment will be taken into account in \nthe detailed design. The project is located on government-owned land and requires no land \nacquisition, so it is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement. The project is classified \nas category C for indigenous peoples because it will not affect ethnic minority communities. The \ngovernment has the institutional capacity required to manage environmental and social risks. \n \n ", "10 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n42.  The overall project benefits are expected to outweigh the costs and risks. The overall \nrisk rating of the project is low. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4, \nand described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.26  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLimited coordination of various  A project steering committee will be established to coordinate and \npublic agencies dealing with  exchange information between stakeholders.

ASSURANCES  \n43.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan documents. \n \n44.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are \nset forth in the loan agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n45.
