The  proposed  project  will  tackle  the \ncore  problem  of  inefficient  trade  processes  by  rehabilitating  facilities  and  providing  modern \nequipment  to  three  major  border-crossing  points  (BCPs),  upgrading  the  Customs  Automated \nInformation System, and conducting preparatory work for the establishment of a single-window \nsystem for trade-related regulatory requirements. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nDevelopment challenges. Located between the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and \nthe Russian Federation, Mongolia is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world. \nBecause  Mongolia  is  vast  (1.5  million  square  kilometers)  and  landlocked,  regional  economic \ncooperation  and  trade  are  critical  in  promoting  inclusive  economic  growth.  Geography  adds \ndramatically to the development challenges since it drives up trade transaction costs.  \n \nInternational  trade  has  always  been  important  for  the  Mongolian  economy  given  its \n4. \nabundance of natural resources and its agriculture sector.2 In recent years, much progress has \nbeen made to liberalize trade regimes and conclude free trade agreements with trading partners \nsuch as Japan, which would help Mongolia boost exports.3 However, market access alone is not \na sufficient condition for harnessing the benefits of trade for development. Poor trade facilitation \nsignificantly reduces Mongolia\u2019s competitiveness in global markets. Improving connectivity and \ncross-border cooperation will therefore help lower these high costs. \n \n \n Mongolia  is  a  member  of  the  CAREC  program.  Under  the  framework  of  CAREC,  the \n5. \nTransport  and  Trade  Facilitation  Strategy  20204 focuses  on  the  development  of  six  CAREC \ncorridors  through  infrastructure  investments  and  trade  facilitation  initiatives,  to  improve  the \nmovement  of  goods  and  people  through  and  across  these  corridors.  In  addition,  the  National \nRoad  Action  Plan  aims  to  improve  transport  services,  reduce  vehicle  operationing  costs,  and \nprovide regional links to connect Mongolia with the neighboring foreign seaports. \n \n6. \nCAREC  Corridor  4,  designated  for  Mongolia,  has  2,400  kilometers  (km)  of  roads  and \n1,100 km of railways.5 At present, Mongolia relies on the road and rail corridor from Ulaanbaatar \nto Zamiin-Uud to carry most of its trade with the PRC, and from Ulaanbaatar to Altanbulag for \n\n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Between 2009 and 2015, imports and exports more than doubled, with exports increasing from about $1.9 billion to \n$4.7  billion  and  imports  from  $1.1  billion  to  $3.8  billion.  Total  trade  over  gross  national  product  since  2000  was \nabout 115% on average, although it declined from 130% in 2004 to 100% in 2014. \n\n3   Mongolia  acceded  to  the  Asia-Pacific  Trade  Agreement  in  2013.  It  signed  a  free  trade  agreement  with  Japan  in \n\n2015. \n\n4   CAREC and ADB. 2014. CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy 2020. Manila. \n5   Corridor  4:  Russian  Federation\u2013East  Asia  (Inner  Mongolia Autonomous  Region  and  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous \n\nRegion in the People\u2019s Republic of China, and Mongolia). \n\n\f2 \n\ntrade  with  the  Russian  Federation  (CAREC  Corridor  4B).  The  ongoing  Regional  Logistics \nDevelopment Project6 supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will develop a modern \nlogistics facility at Zamiin-Uud, which will lead to more efficient transport and logistics services.  \n \nIn addition, once completed, the Eastern Regional Road Corridor, designated as CAREC \n7. \nCorridor 4C, will link Ulaanbaatar with the PRC at Bichigt (Sukhbaatar Aimag), where there are \nroad  and  nearby  rail  connections  with  the  PRC\u2019s  northeast.  The  government  has  already \ncompleted  the  555  km  section  from  Ulaanbaatar  to  Baruun-Urt,  and  the  remaining  276  km \nsection from Baruun-Urt to Bichigt will be developed with ADB\u2019s support. Bichigt BCP is already \nfunctioning and has become increasingly important for trade with the PRC. \n \n8. \nDespite the significant improvements made on transport connectivity, the cost of trade is \nstill high in Mongolia. In the 2016 World Bank Doing Business Report, Mongolia ranked 74th out \nof 189 countries on the ease of trading across borders.7 The Logistics Performance Index 2014 \nranks  Mongolia  135th  out  of  160  countries,  and  Mongolia  has  one  of  the  poorest  scores  for \ncustoms  clearance  and  border  crossing,  resulting  in  major  delays. 8  Excessive  physical \ninspections represent a major source of delay and impose heavy costs on traders.  \n \n9. \nBorder-crossing  points.  The  data  from  CAREC\u2019s  corridor  performance  measurement \nand monitoring (CPMM) 9 identify the major barriers that prevent the smooth flow of goods along \nthese  corridors.  CPMM  data  show  marked  improvements  in  the  cost  and  speed  of  trucks \nmoving  along  CAREC  Corridor  4B  from  2013  to  2014,  mainly  thanks  to  improvements  in \ntransport infrastructure. But the data also show that other bottlenecks remain. BCPs were found \nto  be  the  major  barrier  to  transport  and  trade.  For  instance,  average  border-crossing  time  at \nMongolian  borders  in  2014  stood  at  4.8  hours  in  Altanbulag,  at  3.7  hours  in  Bichigt,  and  at \n8.7 hours  in  Zamiin-Uud.  At  other  BCPs  bordering  the  PRC,  border-crossing  time  stood  at \n6.8 hours  in  Khorgos  (Kazakhstan),  at  6.1  hours  in  Irkeshtan  (Kyrgyz  Republic),  and  at  1.4 \nhours in Torugart (Kyrgyz Republic). Border-crossing time at Bichigt is currently shorter than at \nother  countries\u2019  BCPs  with  PRC  given  the  lower  trade  volume  with  PRC  through  Bichigt. \nHowever,  once  the  road  section  is  completed,  trade  with  PRC\u2019s  northeast  is  expected  to  rise \nsubstantially, hence the need to address border related inefficiencies in advance. \n \nAccording to CPMM data, a significant portion of delays is attributable to poor physical \n10. \ninfrastructure  at  the  BCPs  and  old  and  inefficient  equipment  preventing  customs  officials  to \nconduct their functions effectively. Another reason for delays at the borders is the low levels of \nutilization  of  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT).  Delays  at  BCPs  impose  heavy \ncosts on traders relating largely to spoilage, storage, securing of goods while in transit, and the \npayment of accompanying fees. Efficient international trade procedures and customs operations \ncan significantly reduce trade transaction costs, which in turn could result in increased volumes \nof trade and welfare gains. \n \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2010.

The  Mongolian  Customs  General  Administration,  with  ADB \n11. \nsupport,  embarked  on  the  largest  ICT  project  to  date.10 The  Customs  Automated  Information \nSystem  (CAIS)  was  officially  launched  in  2010,  and  the  data  center  hardware  was  since \nupgraded, particularly the servers and storage devices. The software, however, was upgraded \nin 2013 and funded with internal resources and some upgrades were made in 2016.11 Several \nuser enhancements were rolled out, including functional features such as the expansion of the \nCustoms  External  Portal \nthe  e-manifest.  The \nthe \ncommunication infrastructure of the CAIS should be improved to boost application performance \nresponse by improving the design of applications and programming code, and applying system-\nlevel  upgrades,  and  by  preparing  the  application  and  external  interfaces  necessary  as  new \nbusiness rules and complimentary systems such as the single window are introduced. \n \nIn  addition,  the  Mongolian  Customs  General  Administration  was  merged  with  the  Tax \n12. \nAuthority in January 2016 to create the General Authority of Customs and Taxation (GACT). As \nboth  institutions  were  using  separate  ICT  platforms,  both  systems  need  to  be  interoperable  to \nbe able to share relevant information. The interconnection and interoperability of both systems \nis challenging and requires support.   \n \n13. \nNational  single  window.  According  to  the  World  Bank  Doing  Business  Indicators,  it \ntakes 37 hours to prepare and process export documents, and 22 hours for import documents. \nThe government is interested in implementing a national single-window system as an effective \nmeans  of  minimizing  time  and  cost  involved  in  international  trade.  A  single  window12 helps \ncoordinate  the  processing  of  data  and  information  needed  to  meet  trade-related  regulatory \nrequirements with a single entry point for traders. The implementation of a single window would \nlead to greater simplification of trade processes and procedures, and greater transparency and \npredictability  in  international  trade  transactions.  This  means  fewer  complexities,  fewer  delays, \nand lower costs, which in turn will lead to greater export competitiveness, increased trade, more \njobs, and ultimately economic growth.  \n \n14. \nHowever,  the  interagency  nature  of  the  single  window  requires  extensive  engagement \nand  coordination  of  stakeholders  from  both  public  and  private  sectors,  which  can  pose  a \nchallenge. International experience suggests to adopt a pragmatic and incremental approach to \nthe development of a single window. Therefore, preparatory work is highly relevant to build trust \nand  understanding  between  agencies  and  establish  an  appropriate  legal  framework  before \nlaunching a single window system. \n \nNational effort in regional and international perspective. To tackle similar challenges \n15. \nin  CAREC  member  countries,  ADB  formulated  the  CAREC  Regional  Improvement  of  Border \nServices (RIBS) Project in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, which is intended to streamline, \nin a coordinated manner, transport, customs, and other border control operations along CAREC \ncorridors  and  thereby  increase  trade  in  Central  Asia.13 Separately,  ADB  has  approved  a  RIBS \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB.  2006.

The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  interim  country  partnership \nstrategy  for  Mongolia,  2014\u20132016; 16 its  country  operations  business  plan,  2015; 17 and  with \nCAREC\u2019s Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy 2020 (footnote 4). \n \n16. \nLessons.  Many  lessons  can  be  learned  from  past  and  ongoing  technical  assistance \nrelated  to  customs  reforms  and  modernization  supported  by  ADB  and  development  partners. \nRegarding the development of a single-window system, three lessons are key. First, achieving \nmeaningful results depends principally on building genuine collaboration between stakeholders. \nSecond,  for  the  single  window  to  become  operative,  establishing  a  legal  framework  is \nimperative.  Third,  donor  coordination  is  decisive  since  different  business  models  are  needed \nand consensus must be achieved. From a customs reform perspective, three lessons are key. \nFirst,  encouraging  and  enabling  public\u2013private  dialogue,  which  leads  to  mutually  beneficial \nalliances,  is  vital.  Second,  ICT  departments  should  have  enough  capacity  to  operate  the \nautomation systems and ensure sustainability. Finally, business process reengineering must be \nconducted in line with international standards to maximize harmonization of customs procedures \nacross borders. \n \nB. \n\nImpacts and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  will  be  increased  trade  and  competitiveness  as  a  result  of  faster  and  cost-\n17. \nefficient  cross-border  services.  The  intended  project  outcome  is  reduced  cost  and  time  of \ncompliance with trade procedures.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe project will have three outputs. \n\n18. \n \nOutput  1:  Facilities  and  equipment  at  Altanbulag,  Bichigt,  and  Zamiin-Uud  BCPs \n19. \nare upgraded and improved. Infrastructure and equipment at the three BCPs are relatively old \nand  considered  inefficient.  Cooperation  between  border  agencies  is  also  limited.  Investments \nwill  focus  on  (i)  rehabilitation  and  reorganization  of  BCP  facilities  to  strengthen  customs \nprocessing  capacity  and  facilitate  trade  in  line  with  modern  customs  practices,18 as  well  as \ncreate  a  gender-sensitive  environment; 19 and  (ii)  provision  of  modern  equipment  to  enable \ncustoms  officials  to  undertake  their  control  function  effectively  and  reduce  reliance  on  manual \nchecks.

Separation systems between passengers and vehicles during entry and exit will be provided as well \nas independent electricity supply units. Checking and examination zones for cargo are to be covered with a canopy \nto serve as sheltered passageways. \n\n19 Separate lanes and inspection for women traders, and adequate washroom facilities for women. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fcustoms  practices  (i.e.,  risk  management  techniques,  coordinated  border  management,  and \nawareness raising on human trafficking) will also be conducted.  \n\n20. \nOutput 2: Communication infrastructure for CAIS is improved and GACT systems \nare  interoperable.  The  core  CAIS  application  modules  will  be  upgraded  to  provide  added \nfunctionalities  for  more  operational  efficiency.  The  CAIS  system  will  be  made  single-window-\nready,  and  capacity  will  be  boosted  to  prepare  for  anticipated  higher  volume.  In  this  regard, \noperating  and  processing  capacity  will  be  increased  through system  software  installations  and \nhardware upgrades alongside network upgrades. Improvements in the customer support center \nwill be undertaken through call center analysis and design, as well as help desk and customer \nsupport software. The customs external portal system will be upgraded to allow public viewing \nof trade information and reports. Technical training will be provided to boost the capacity of ICT \nstaff  at  GACT.  Advisory  support  will  help  develop  the  interconnectivity  and  interoperability  of \ninformation  systems  at  the  customs  and  taxation  authorities.  A  business  process  integration \nstrategy will be formulated, which will inform the ICT systems' interconnection process. \n \nOutput  3:  Preparatory  work  for  single  window  is  undertaken.  A  revised  single-\n21. \nwindow  model  will  be  prepared  to  involve,  in  principle,  the  key  trade-related  agencies20 and \nprivate  sector  entities  involved  in  the  supply  chain.  Analysis  will  be  undertaken  to  redesign \nprocesses  and  procedures  to  incorporate  a  coordinated  border  management  approach  to \noperations,  including  cargo  examinations  and  information  sharing.  The  current  documentary \nrequirements  for  all  agencies  will  also  be  examined  to  streamline  them  into  an  agreed  set  of \ndocuments  needed  to  clear  cargo. 21 Preparation  for  the  single  window  will  also  include  an \nagreement  from  most  agencies  involved  in  trade  to  work  together,  share  information,  and  link \ncurrent information technology systems. An agreement should be reached on the lead agency \nto manage the single window, and on the financial implications of maintaining and upgrading the \nsystem.  The  development  of  a  single  window  in  Mongolia  will  be  based  on  functional \nrequirements  established  in  these  preparations.

By  using  information  technology  in \nparticular, it managed to improve operational efficiency and effectiveness. \n \n The  operations  of  customs  and  other  border  agencies  at  the  three  BCPs  were \n29. \nassessed, particularly in relation to how the flow of goods and people through the border might \nbe improved and contribute to trade facilitation objectives. Based on customs performance and \nindividual  needs  for  improvement,  and  an  evaluation  of  current  capacity,  equipment  will  be \n\n                                                 \n23 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nDisbursement  \n\n \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fprocured to enable each BCP to carry out inspections faster and more efficiently.24 Staff will be \ntrained to use the equipment in the prescribed manner. \n \n30. \nThe  preparatory  work  for  a  single  window  is  an  opportunity  to  review  processes  and \ntrade procedures and align them with international standards and facilitate trade. The processes \nrelated  to  customs  clearance  at  the  borders  need  alignment  with  international  best  practices, \nparticularly  in  terms  of  risk  management.25 Training  and  capacity  building  in  risk  management \nand  profiling  techniques  was  provided  to  staff  at  most  customs  levels.  The  introduction  of  a \nsingle  window  is  timely  and  helps  incorporate  a  functional  risk  management  approach  into \noperational policies and procedures at the BCPs, which will reduce the cargo-examination time.  \n \n31. \nA  single  window  transcends  ICT  and  involves  change  management  across  different \nstakeholders. This requires adequate policies and a legal framework. An information exchange \nplatform to share data across different agencies needs to be developed as well.  \n \n32. \nAt the center of establishing a national single window is CAIS. It is fundamental given its \ncentral  role  in  transacting  and  receiving  regulatory  documents  for  international  trade.  As \nbusiness requirements evolve, CAIS needs to be improved to ensure a workable single window \nfor trade. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n33. \nThe  anticipated  economic  benefits  of  the  project  include  a  reduction  in  trade  costs  by \nlowering the working capital needs of exporters and importers, a reduction in operating costs for \nroad  and  railway  transport  companies  involved  in  international  shipments,  and  increased \nproductivity  of  GACT  staff.  By  lowering  trade  costs  and  time,  the  project  will  indirectly  help \nMongolia  boost  production  and  export  of  manufactured  products,  diversify  exports  away  from \nmineral products, reinvigorate the economy, and insulate it from swings in world mineral prices. \n \n34. \npresent value of $1.7 million. The investments are considered economically justifiable. \n \nThe financial sustainability of the project was assessed at both a fiscal and project level. \n35. \nThe  government  has  committed  to  provide  the  necessary  recurrent  funds  following  project \ncompletion to ensure that the benefits of the investment are sustained. \n  \nC. \n\nThe economic analysis resulted in an economic internal rate of return of 14.3% and a net \n\nGovernance \n\n36. \nA  financial  management  assessment  conducted  for  GACT  confirms  that  it  has \nadequately  functioning  financial  accounting  and  reporting  systems  and  procedures,  which  are \ncomputerized  and  managed  by  accounting  professionals.  The  entity-  and  project-specific  risks \nare rated moderate (pre-mitigation) because the post-merger reorganization process of setting \nup joint administrative and managerial arrangements is ongoing, while weaknesses were found \nin  annual  planning  and  budgeting  processes,  accounting  policy  documentation,  internal  audit, \nreporting,  and  accounting  information  systems.  These  weaknesses  will  be  dealt  with  by \nestablishing  the  PIU,  which  will  assume  regular  financial  management  responsibilities.  Along \n                                                 \n24 Including but not limited to x-ray machines, testing equipment for narcotics and explosives, closed-circuit television, \n\nand base station monitors and surveillance. \n\n25  The  World  Customs  Organization  defines  risk  management  as  the  systematic  application  of  management \nprocedures  and  practices  that  provide  customs  with  the  necessary  information  to  deal  with  movements  or \nconsignments that present a risk. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fwith  additionally  proposed  risk  management  measures,  this  will  provide  safeguards  against \nfiduciary risks.  \n \n37. \nThe  PIU  will  be  equipped  with  an  integrated  financial  management  system  and  staffed \nby  qualified  professionals\u2014including  a  project  manager,  finance  specialist,  and  performance \nmonitoring  specialist\u2014to  ensure  that  the  project  is  implemented  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \noperational and procedural requirements. Given the PIU and proposed risk mitigation measures, \nthe  project  financial  management  risk  is  considered  to  be  low,  and  the  planned  arrangements \nsatisfactory. \n \n38. \nAll  procurement  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  consulting  services  to  be \nfinanced under the project will be engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Project  implementation,  procurement,  and \nfinancial  management  will  be  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  standard  operating  procedures. \nAuditors acceptable to ADB will audit the project accounts annually. The project will strengthen \nstaff capacity in financial management procedures, and will use existing government websites to \n(i) disclose implementation progress, and bid notifications and results; and (ii) provide channels \nto report corrupt practices. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n39. \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 23). \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n40. \nThe project will enable  increased trade along the CAREC corridors and will reduce the \ncost and time of compliance with trade procedures at major BCPs. More efficient importing and \nexporting through trade facilitation will decrease trade transaction costs and benefit the traders, \nand  will  generate  employment.  Moreover,  by  eliminating  physical  and  administrative  obstacles \nto trade at BCPs, the project will help lower import prices, in particular those of essential goods. \nSocial  and  gender  development  measures  are  included  in  a  social  development  action  plan, \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 23). \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards  \n\nThe project is classified as category C for the environment since there will be minimal or \n41. \nno adverse environmental impacts. The climate risk screening has indicated a medium risk for \nclimate  change  impacts  for  Bichigt  and  Zamiin-Uud,  and  a  high  risk  for  Altanbulag.  Climate \nchange  risks  include  increased  snow  loading,  melting  permafrost,  and  flooding.  Results  and \nrecommendations of the climate risk and vulnerability assessment will be taken into account in \nthe  detailed  design.  The  project  is  located  on  government-owned  land  and  requires  no  land \nacquisition, so it is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement. The project is classified \nas category C for indigenous peoples because it will not affect ethnic minority communities. The \ngovernment has the institutional capacity required to manage environmental and social risks. \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n42. \nThe  overall  project  benefits  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs  and  risks.  The  overall \nrisk rating of the project is low. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4, \nand described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.26  \n\n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nLimited coordination of various \npublic agencies dealing with \ninternational trade \nIT department of GACT is \nunderstaffed when it comes to \nhandling complex systems and \nsystem upgrades. \nLack of operational and financial \nsustainability after project \ncompletion \n\nMitigating Measures \nA project steering committee will be established to coordinate and \nexchange information between stakeholders.
