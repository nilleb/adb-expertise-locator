THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach and (ii) a proposed policy-based loan (PBL) to the Republic of the \nPhilippines for subprogram 1 of the Support to Capital Market-Generated Infrastructure Financing \nProgram. \n \n2.  The program aims to deepen the domestic capital market to increase the supply of long-\nterm finance to support investments. It will do so by addressing key constraints that have limited \ngrowth in the government and corporate bond markets. In addition, the program launches a \nfocused effort to broaden the contractual saving subsector (e.g. pensions, insurance, and mutual \nfunds). A vibrant and deep contractual saving sector provides a sustainable source of long-tenor \ninfrastructure finance and increases the country\u2019s resilience against external shocks. The program \nis consistent with the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2017\u20132022 and intersects with the first \ntwo pillars of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy, 2018\u20132023:  \n(i) accelerating infrastructure and long-term investments; and (ii) promoting local economic \ndevelopment.1, 2 The program is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (para. 17 and Table 1).3 \nThe Design and Monitoring framework (DMF) is in Appendix 1 and the policy matrix is in Appendix \n4. While the program had been planned since 2018, well before the coronavirus disease (COVID-\n19) pandemic, the budgetary financing under the program will help the government\u2019s overall \nincreased financing requirements due to the pandemic response.  \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  The Philippines\u2019 economy has outperformed regional peers such as Indonesia, Malaysia, \nand Thailand, with economic growth exceeding 6% per year since 2012. Under the PDP, the \ngovernment has set a strategic target to reach upper middle-income status by 2022, with an \naccompanying decline in the national poverty rate from 23.3% in 2015 to 14.0% in 2022 (footnote \n1). However, the Philippines\u2019 infrastructure deficit is large and acts as a constraint on achieving \nthese goals. In response, the government increased public spending on infrastructure to more \nthan 6% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2017 and 2018 under its signature Build, Build, Build \n(BBB) program. Yet, the government still faces a large infrastructure deficit. Based on earlier work \nby ADB, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimated that the \nPhilippines will require \u20b124 trillion\u2013\u20b127 trillion, or roughly \u20b12 trillion per year, through 2030 to \nbridge the infrastructure gap and sustain the country\u2019s growth rate.4  \n \n4.  Due largely to ongoing reforms to the government debt market, a diversified infrastructure \nfunding mix has been utilized under the BBB program.5 Issuance of government debt increased \nto \u20b11.1 trillion in 2018 from \u20b1810 billion in 2016, matching the increase in government spending \n \n1  Government of the Philippines, National Economic and Development Authority. 2017.

When compared against these needs, the carrying capacity of the domestic capital \nmarket is quite limited. The domestic fixed-income market represented only 35.7% of GDP as of \n31 December 2019, well below the Emerging East Asia peer average of 83.3% (Figure 1). \nGovernment debt outstanding is only half the size of the peer average, while the corporate debt \nmarket is only one-third the size of the peer average. Banks and private companies have been \nsupplying private capital for infrastructure but have reached their limits. Bank credit\u2013GDP ratio \nhas increased, corporate leverage for listed firms now exceeds regional comparators, and the \ncredit\u2013GDP gap (capturing the build-up of excessive credit) is approaching early warning levels.7 \n \nFigure 1: Finance Sector Composition \n \n800\n700\n600\nP500\nD\nG\n fo400\n %300\n200\n100\n0\nPhilippines Thailand Malaysia Indonesia Viet Nam Singapore\nFixed Income Equity Banking Pension, Insurance and Mutual Funds  \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and World Bank. \n \n5.  The  contractual  savings  subsector  represents  a  natural  repository  for  long-tenor \ninvestments, such as government debt and infrastructure finance. However, this subsector is \nunderdeveloped and has only played a limited role (Figure 1).8 Within the subsector, the insurance \nindustry is quite small and nascent. Premiums represented only 1.61% of GDP in 2016, a level \nwhich lags that of Thailand (5.20%) and Malaysia (4.10%). Similarly, pension funds are also small \nrelative to GDP. The limited scope of intermediation through contractual savings has constrained \nnot only the provision of long-term finance but also economic development. Research indicates \nthat finance sector development drives economic growth. However, in more developed markets, \nit is growth in contractual savings\u2014and insurance in particular\u2014that provides the largest boost to \ngrowth in real GDP per capita relative to other finance subsectors.9 A strong contractual savings \nsubsector provides not only critically needed long-term financing, but also a savings pool that can \nenable savers to build wealth and weather external shocks.  \n \n6.  Impact of COVID-19. These development challenges have been recently compounded \nby the COVID-19 pandemic, which has serious economic and social consequences. GDP growth \nis projected to contract in 2020 as compared to the original estimate of 6.2% growth and the \npoverty level is likely to worsen to 20.7% in 2020 from 16.6% in 2018. The infrastructure funding \ngap (para. 4) is likely to be exacerbated by the government\u2019s stimulus response to the COVID-19 \npandemic. Measures to control the spread of the pandemic, both globally and domestically, \n \n6  As of August 2019, debt issuances aggregated to \u20b11.2 trillion, but infrastructure expenditures lagged at \u20b1446 billion \nbecause of one-off delays in adopting the 2019 national budget. \n7  International Monetary Fund. 2018.

Development constraints. In previous programs (footnote 5), the government identified \nand addressed fundamental foundational constraints on the government debt market (para. 12). \nThe government will now begin addressing the next set of higher-order constraints. Grouped into \nthree categories, these constraints are elaborated below in paras. 8\u201310: (i) lack of strategic \noversight and a weak enabling environment; (ii) low liquidity and transparency, and nascent price \ndiscovery in the government bond market; and (iii) limited institutional participation in the capital \nmarket. \n \n8.  Capital market development efforts in the Philippines have not been guided by any \noverarching framework as they have been in Malaysia and Thailand, where markets are now far \nmore advanced. The existing Capital Market Development Council, which is driven largely by the \nprivate sector, does not provide a wider market development objective. More consensus-driven \ncoordinated  action  is  required  amongst  various  institutions.  A  recently  constituted  informal \nworking group comprising the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the Bureau of the Treasury \n(BTr), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) must be formalized and its activities\u2014\nfocused on developing the government bond market\u2014successfully implemented. Looking forward, \na more comprehensive planning effort will be needed to progressively introduce complex products, \nincluding in the contractual savings subsector. Further, the enabling environment needs to be \nstrengthened. The charter of the BSP does not provide a mandate to ensure financial stability, a \nprerequisite for finance sector development. The payment system (a key foundation of the finance \nsector) has not been adequately regulated. The SEC\u2019s funding has long been inadequate, and \nthe Corporation Code has not been updated since 1980 and the Securities Regulation Code has \nnot  been  updated  since  2000.  These  constraints  increase  friction  costs,  inhibit  product \ndevelopment, and limit competition. \n \n9.  Additional improvements to the government debt market are necessary to ensure that \ngreater amounts of government debt can be issued to finance the nation\u2019s long-term investment \nrequirements including the much-needed infrastructure. A reliable yield curve must be developed \nto serve as a pricing benchmark for the private sector to raise financing including infrastructure-\ndedicated bonds. The government must (i) encourage more trading of government debt to \ngenerate market-based pricing data, and (ii) upgrade systems to use that data to build a reliable \nyield curve. The government must also intensify efforts to issue bonds in only those tenors that \nactively trade and are used by the private sector as benchmarks. System upgrades are needed \nto increase efficiency, reliability, and interoperability, and to support a wider variety of participants, \nincluding tax-exempt contractual savings entities. A new yield curve calculation methodology is \nneeded as the current methodology is based on infrequently traded \u201cbellwether\u201d bonds. Reference \nto such bonds introduces volatility\u2014price changes by as much as 50 basis points in a single day\u2014\nwhich deters international investors and constrains the book-making process for corporate debt. \n \n10.  While institutional investors need to play a larger role in capital market development, the \ncontractual savings subsector will take some time to mature. The insurance subsector faces \nlimitations in what it can buy and sell, and a tedious approval process remains despite the \nrelaxation of restrictive investment guidelines. The legal framework does not require private \n \n10 Sector Assessment (Summary): Finance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \npensions to be fully funded. Public pensions have limited authority to raise contribution rates and \nface  widespread  noncompliance  by  employers  who  fail  to  fund  the  required  contributions. \nInvestment regimes are restrictive. Corporate bonds and notes represent just under 10% of total \nfinancial assets at each of the largest public pension funds. In contrast, the California State \nTeachers\u2019 Retirement System in the United States (US) holds 30% of its financial assets in \ncorporate bonds and private equity investments and only 8% in government bonds. Foreign-\ndomiciled contractual savings institutions could provide an alternative source of demand for long-\ntenor infrastructure-linked investments. However, tax costs, including the final withholding tax \napplied to interest (which is typically not refunded), are high relative to comparator countries, \nwhich deters investors. In addition, the government has not taken the initiative to tap offshore \nclimate or other specialty funds. \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n11.  The government\u2019s reform program. The PDP underscores the government\u2019s emphasis \non inclusive growth and reducing poverty. With the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts will need to be \nsignificantly scaled up to achieve these goals. Accordingly, primary emphasis has again been \nplaced on investment. Prior to the current health emergency, the government announced plans \nto increase public spending on infrastructure to as high as 7.4% of GDP by 2022 and to encourage \ngreater  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure.11 With  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the \ngovernment has launched a substantial response package while maintaining critical infrastructure \nspending. As such, it is imperative that the government (i) modernize and strengthen its debt \nissuance processes to fund its increasing expenditure and infrastructure needs, and (ii) provide  \nmore reliable price discovery to anchor the private sector\u2019s efforts to raise complementary long-\nterm  infrastructure  financing.  Complementary  reforms  will  also  need  to  be  undertaken  to \nconsolidate outstanding issues, boost liquidity, and reduce costs so as to establish a reliable term \nstructure of interest rates (yield curve). In addition, the government will deploy integrated financial \nmarket infrastructure to promote efficiency in the trading, settlement, and delivery of securities. \n \n12.  The programmatic approach. The Encouraging Investment through Capital Market \nReforms Program (footnote 5) set the stage for the proposed program by adopting a more \nstructured and sequenced approach to developing the domestic capital market. Long-standing \nfoundational reforms were addressed. The cash and investment management functions, as well \nas the technical capacity of the BTr, were strengthened. The BTr upgraded and modernized its \noperations, and initiatives were launched to improve the reliability of market-generated bond \npricing data. The government also began improving the legal framework and engaging with the \ncontractual  savings  subsector.  The  proposed  programmatic  approach now  advances these \nfoundational reforms, triggering a significant increase in government bond trading volumes and \ncorporate issuance, and launches a more focused effort to include the contractual savings sector \nin the government\u2019s development objectives. A programmatic approach provides for a long-term \nbut flexible engagement, a modality well-suited to capital market development. \n \n13.  Proposed policy reforms. The program\u2019s impact is aligned with the PDP and will help \nthe government achieve its targeted public spending covering both the COVID-19 response and \nmedium-term infrastructure development. The program will (i) help the government fund its \nexpenditures at lower relative costs, and (ii) enable the private sector to fund infrastructure \nthrough the capital markets. The program will also help increase financial resilience by growing \nthe contractual savings sector. The program consists of two subprograms and has three reform \nareas: (i) strategic oversight and the enabling environment; (ii) liquidity, transparency, and price \n \n11 On 11 December 2019, the Development Budget Coordination Committee adopted a 6.5%\u20137.5% growth target for \n2020\u20132022 with infrastructure appropriations expected to represent 5.9% of GDP. \n ", "5 \ndiscovery in the government bond market; and (iii) institutional participation in the capital markets. \nA third subprogram may be added during processing of subprogram 2 (para. 24). \n \n14.  Strategic oversight and the enabling environment. Under this reform area, stronger \nstrategic guidance has been provided by the government to market development, and the \nenabling environment has been improved. Under subprogram 1, the BSP, the BTr, and the SEC \nformalized their working group and implemented the Philippines\u2019 first coordinated capital market \ndevelopment plan with an immediate focus on liquidity, price discovery, efficiency, and oversight \nof the government bond market. The charter of the BSP was amended in February 2019 to provide \na mandate for financial stability, expand the BSP\u2019s policy toolkit by restoring the central bank\u2019s \nauthority to issue its own debt papers as part of its regular monetary operations, and provide \nfinancial supervision staff with qualified immunity. Congress adopted a law to provide the BSP \nwith the authority to supervise all payment systems. The corporation code was revised to simplify \ncorporate actions and reduce  associated costs. The revised code also  provides for quasi-\nindependent funding, and includes provisions allowing the SEC to revoke a corporation\u2019s charter \nfor corrupt practices. Under subprogram 2, the government plans to implement a broader, longer-\nterm  capital  market  development  plan  which  includes  the  private  and  contractual  savings \nsubsectors. The BSP and the SEC plan to adopt implementing regulations to make operational \nthe legal reforms completed under subprogram 1. \n \n15.  Liquidity, transparency, and price discovery in the government bond market. Under \nthis  reform  area,  increased  priority  spending\u2014including  infrastructure\u2014was  facilitated  by \nenabling increased issuance of government debt at lower relative cost, and by providing a reliable \nyield curve for pricing private sector debt. Under subprogram 1, the BTr has reversed a 3-year \ndecline in trading volumes and provided more reliable market-generated data. It concentrated \n100% of the government\u2019s domestic issuance into five key tenor buckets, encouraged competition \nthrough 10 \u201cmarket makers\u201d as part of its enhanced primary dealer system, and introduced \nhedging mechanisms to facilitate eventual two-way price quotes. To better utilize the data and to \nreduce transaction costs, the government replaced its outdated domestic trading platform with a \nvendor-supplied system (Bloomberg E-bond) and replaced the current yield curve calculation \nmethodology (R2) with a globally accepted system which employs machine learning (Bloomberg \nBval). Supplementing these reforms, the BTr launched the new National Registry of Scripless \nSecurities (nRoSS) and associated primary auction system. The system is efficient and can \nimplement the pending changes in tax law by facilitating the entry of new tax-exempt participants \n(international  contractual  savings  institutions)  in  the  government  securities  market.  Under \nsubprogram 2, the government plans to complete its transition to an over-the-counter self-\nregulated market by issuing the necessary market conduct guidelines. The BTr plans to require \nthe primary dealers to publish and execute on firm two-way price quotes, and will expand nRoSS \nto accommodate new products, including repos and floating rate notes. \n \n16.  Institutional participation in the capital market. This reform area encourages greater \nparticipation by international institutional investors while concurrently launching the development \nof a domestic institutional investor base. Under subprogram 1, the government submitted a bill to \nCongress to reduce taxes to encourage more international investors and to remove tax arbitrage \nbetween finance subsectors. The SEC targeted pools of international investment funds by issuing \nregulations to support the issuance of \u201cgreen bonds\u201d. To encourage demand from domestic \ninstitutional investors, Congress amended the Social Security Act to increase the contribution rate, \nbroaden membership, and provide more flexibility in investment decisions by the Social Security \nSystem. The Insurance Commission issued detailed guidance allowing insurance companies to \ninvest in infrastructure projects included in the PDP. The BSP launched an initiative to streamline \nand  modernize  the  Personal  Equity  and  Retirement  Account  (PERA)  by  incorporating  the \n ", "6 \nseamless issue of tax exemptions by the Bureau of Internal Revenue and enabling mobile \ninterfaces. On the supply side, the government eased regulatory restrictions, resulting in the \nissuance of \u20b1294 billion in notes under approved shelf registrations aggregating to \u20b1507 billion. \nThis included the first issue of \u20b115 billion in green bonds by a banking conglomerate (1 February \n2019). Moreover, the SEC approved a \u20b11 billion issuance by Aeon Credit Services Philippines, \nthe first debentures issued in the Philippines under the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \nplus three (ASEAN+3) Multi-Currency Bond Issuance Framework. Under subprogram 2, the \ngovernment will adopt and implement the revised tax code. The BSP plans to complete upgrades \nto  the  PERA  and  implement  its  growth  plan.  The  Social  Security  System  plans  to  issue \nimplementing rules and regulations and the Insurance Commission plans to further encourage \nthe insurance subsector to support infrastructure. The BSP and SEC will encourage additional \ncorporate issuances and listings by foreign entities domiciled in the Philippines. \n \nFigure 2: ADB\u2019s Engagement in Capital Market Development in the Philippines \n2017\u20132021:  \n2005\u20132011:  \nSupport to Capital Market-\nFinancial Market Regulation and \nGenerated Infrastructure \n1998\u20132001:  Integration Program \nFinancing Program \nFirst Nonbank Financial  TA: Capacity Development of \nGovernance Program Financial Regulators \nTA: Strengthening Regulation \nand Market Governance\n2013\u20132017: \n2001\u20132003:  Encouraging Investment through \nCapital Market Reforms Program\nSecond Nonbank \nFinancial Governance  TA: Strengthening Treasury\u2019s \n1992\u20131998: Program  Liquidity Management \nFirst Capital Market  TA: Support for Nonbank  TA: Strengthening Treasury \nDevelopment Program Financial Governance II Operations and Capital Market \nReform\nTA: Stock Market Development\n \n TA = technical assistance. \n Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nStrategy 2030 Priorities  Program \nStrengthening governance  The program will improve the capacity of the government to run and administer its \nand institutional capacity  government debt market.

ADB\u2019s experience. ADB has supported finance sector reforms with five programmatic \nPBLs and substantial technical assistance (TA) (Figure 2). ADB initially focused on building the \nequity market. Responding to the 1997 financial crisis, ADB supported the government\u2019s efforts \nto strengthen governance, improve the SEC, implement investor protection measures, and \ndevelop an anti-money-laundering function. Beginning in 2005, ADB supported the development \nof the fixed-income market but revised its focus to financial stability in response to the 2008 global \nfinancial crisis. Given the lessons learned and the government\u2019s emerging focus on infrastructure, \nADB instituted a coordinated and sequenced approach in 2013 (footnote 5) to further develop the \ndomestic  capital  market.  These  reforms  also  sought  to  begin  building  a  more  diversified \n ", "7 \ninstitutional investor base to encourage the provision of long-term finance for infrastructure. This \nprogrammatic approach continues these reforms and introduces transition to a more focused \neffort to develop the contractual savings subsector as a natural buyer of the newly developing \nlong-term financing instruments. The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (Table 1) and \nis fully consistent with ADB\u2019s broader support to the government\u2019s infrastructure agenda. For \nexample, ADB has supported infrastructure development by supporting reforms to the public\u2013\nprivate partnership framework, including policy-based financing,12 and TA.13 In addition, ADB has \napproved a TA loan to support the preparation of large, complex infrastructure projects, and \nADB\u2019s country operations business plan lists direct lending support to infrastructure of $2.6 billion \nin 2019 and $2.0 billion in 2020 (footnote 2). 14 \n \n18.  Lessons learned. ADB\u2019s long-term engagement helped inform the program through \nseveral key lessons learned. First, success in developing a local currency finance sector depends \non (i) sound macroeconomic policies and debt management strategies, (ii) a diversified investor \nbase, (iii) a sound legal framework, and (iv) modern, reliable, and efficient infrastructure. Given \nthe wide variety of stakeholders involved in these areas, the use of coordinated planning and \nexecution is likely to produce better results. Second, finance sector reforms are complex, have a \nmedium- to long-term gestation period, and require proper sequencing. Programs should exhibit \nsufficient  flexibility  to  accommodate  a  medium-  to  long-term  development  horizon  and  the \ninevitable  changes  which  occur  when  dealing  with  complex  reform  areas.  Third,  the  full \ndevelopment of a domestic capital market requires a large and vibrant contractual savings \nsubsector to provide demand for longer-tenor financing instruments to match their longer-tenor \nliabilities. Given the unique characteristics of this subsector, dedicated programs will eventually \nbe needed to address its unique development needs.  \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s value addition to the program. The engagement highlights the benefits of a One \nADB approach with extensive development partner coordination. This coordination covers the \ndrafting and implementation of the government\u2019s first capital market development plan, the launch \nof  the  nRoSS,  the  PERA  upgrade,  enhancements  to  the  payment  system,  green  bond \nguidelines,15 and the repo market, all of which were supported by ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Regional \nDepartment and development partners (para. 20).16 ADB\u2019s Economic Research and Regional \nCooperation Department provided support through the ASEAN+3 Multi-Currency Bond Issuance \nProgram,  while  ADB\u2019s  Philippines  Country  Office  has  been  instrumental  in  supporting  the \ncompletion of a comprehensive overhaul of the tax code. Finally, ADB\u2019s Treasury Department, \nalong with the Southeast Asia Regional Department, activated ADB\u2019s existing tax exemption and \ncollaborated to obtain approvals for an offshore issue of US dollar\u2013peso-linked notes by ADB. \nThis issuance allowed ADB to invest in and support the domestic currency bond market and to \nmake local currency lending available to the government. \n \n \n12 ADB. 2015.

Active  development  partners  include  the  US \nTreasury and the International Monetary Fund. The anchor for the program is the medium-term \ncapital market development plan. The development of this document represents a collaboration \nbetween the above development partners and the BSP, the BTr, and the SEC. The reform \nprogram, which has essentially been completed, is largely reflected in the reform areas (paras. \n14\u201316). In supporting the implementation of the plan, a clear but cooperative delineation of \nresponsibility has been maintained. The US Treasury Office of Technical Assistance provides \nsupport to the development of the primary and secondary government bond market and its \nsupporting infrastructure. ADB complements this support with TA designed to complete the \nsupplementary reforms necessary to develop the market. The International Monetary Fund is \nproviding assistance on monetary management and liberalizing the foreign exchange regime. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n21.  The impact of the program is aligned with the country\u2019s target for spending on public \ninfrastructure of 7.4% of GDP and private sector participation in infrastructure increased. It will \nenlarge the government debt market, allowing the government to fund its priority programs while \npaving way to facilitate long-term financing in general. The effect of the reforms will be increased \navailability  of  long-term  finance  for  infrastructure  which  will  be  demonstrated  through  the \nperformance indicators in the DMF. Corporate bonds outstanding will increase to at least 12% of \nGDP, government bonds held by the contractual savings sector to 35% of the total outstanding, \nand corporate debt held by public pension funds to 15% of total financial assets held by the funds. \nCurrently, corporate entities raise funding for infrastructure primarily through generic bond issues \nunder the corporate name and do not disclose fund raising by use. This is expected to change \nover time which will provide better tracking mechanisms for use in the DMF. In the interim, the \ncurrent performance indicators represent the best available proxies. \n \n22.  Empirical  research  produces  a  remarkably  consistent  narrative.  Finance  sector \ndevelopment exerts a first-order impact on long-run economic growth (footnote 9). The reform \npackage of subprogram 1 increased the borrowing capacity of the government and the private \nsector, thereby allowing for a faster rate of investment and higher GDP growth. This will help the \ngovernment  achieve  its  targeted  public  spending  and  encourage  greater  private  sector \nparticipation in infrastructure. Assuming a gradual increase in the size of the debt market, total \ncapital  investment  is  expected  to  grow  at  11%  per  annum  in  real  terms  and  deliver  over  \n\u20b128 trillion in infrastructure expenditure over the next 10 years. The reforms will be instrumental \nin meeting the infrastructure deficit and help sustain higher GDP growth in the medium to long \nrun.  The  larger  base  of  infrastructure  and  private  capital  generated  over  this  period  will \npermanently raise productivity and potential output per capita, lifting potential income.17 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n23.  The government has requested a regular loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance subprogram 1. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the annuity repayment \nmethod, the average maturity is 12.1 years, and no maturity premium is payable to ADB. The \nindicative loan amount for subprogram 2 is $300 million. The Philippines\u2019 total financing needs for \n2018\u20132021 were expected to be substantial with annual budget deficits of 3.0% of GDP or larger. \nHowever, due to the adverse impact of COVID-19, the government\u2019s 2020 financing requirement \n \n17 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nis expected to increase to \u20b11.9 trillion ($37.6 billion) from \u20b11.4 trillion. Domestic borrowing will \nincrease by \u20b174.7 billion and foreign borrowing will increase by \u20b1129.2 billion ($2.6 billion) to \nfinance its COVID-19 response program. The size of subprogram 1 reflects the government\u2019s total \nfinancing needs, the strength of the program, and its economic benefits (para. 22).18  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  The Department of Finance (DOF) is the executing agency. The BSP, the BTr, and the \nSEC are the implementing agencies. The implementation period is July 2017\u2013September 2019 \nfor subprogram 1, and October 2019\u2013December 2021 for subprogram 2. A steering committee \nchaired by the DOF, with the implementing agencies as members, will oversee the program. \nBased on the progress made, the quality of the next phase of capital development planning, and \nconsultations with the government, a third subprogram may be added during the processing of \nsubprogram 2. If added, this third subprogram will cover January 2022\u2013March 2024 and will reflect \nand ensure a continuity of reforms within the contractual savings sector which provide for an \nimmediate expansion of the sector or an increased uptake of long-term finance to support \ninfrastructure. The proceeds of the PBL will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n25.  Safeguards. The program does not trigger ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS) \npolicy principles and requirements for environment, involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples. It is classified as category C for environment, involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples following ADB\u2019s SPS 2009. \n \n26.  Poverty and social. The program contributes to poverty reduction by increasing fiscal \nresources available for both infrastructure and social expenditures. Increased investment in \ninfrastructure will lead to increased connectivity, in turn boosting employment and reducing \ninequality. Increased intermediation through the contractual savings subsector has been shown \nto boost real GDP per capita, especially in more developed countries such as the Philippines \n(footnote 9). The program complements an ADB\u2019s ongoing efforts to increase financial inclusion \nand literacy and provides an entry point for coordinated reforms to encourage retirement savings \nthrough future engagements. The program is categorized as having no gender elements because \nof  its  focus  on  foundational  capital  market  development,  including  infrastructure  and  debt \nissuance, which is widely beneficial to all stakeholders. However, the program clearly holds the \npotential  to  generate  direct  benefits  for  women.  The  revised  Social  Security  Act  provides \nadditional benefits to overseas Filipino workers, 56% of whom are women.19 \n \n27.  Governance. A public expenditure and financial accountability assessment conducted in \n2017 found three of seven core public financial management areas (policy-based budgeting, \ntransparency, and asset\u2013liability management) have improved and are considered strong. Efforts \nto improve budget credibility, predictability, execution, and external scrutiny and audit are ongoing. \nThe government is implementing a results-based anticorruption plan to strengthen the judicial \nbranch of the government and the Office of the Ombudsman. Reforms under the program will \ncontinue to strengthen public financial management by improving cash and debt management \nwithin the BTr. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and the DOF. \n \n \n18 The loan may be disbursed in one or more installments. \n19 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n28.  Risks and mitigating measures. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized \nin Table 2 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.20 The overall \ninherent risk was assessed to be moderate. Substantial risks include the COVID-19 pandemic, \nglobal trade and macroeconomic conditions, increased budget deficits, and changes in key \npersonnel. Key but potentially costly reforms, such as pre-funding pensions, may be resisted by \nvested interests and be difficult to achieve.
