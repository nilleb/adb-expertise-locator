On 5 August 2015, the government \nrequested  all  development  partners  to  contribute  to  and  support  its  program\u2014emphasizing \ncapacity development for stronger Ni-Vanuatu (nationals of Vanuatu) disaster resilience, including \nmaximizing the use of local resources where possible. Twenty damaged sites were expected to \nbe rehabilitated and reconstructed using financing under the original project. On 29 December \n2016, the government requested to (i) scale up the project to include four additional damaged \nsites,  and  (ii) change  the  project  scope  to  account  for  the  extent  of  damage  and  unforeseen \nground conditions at two sites included in the original project. The updated project supports post-\ncyclone recovery and reconstruction efforts in the transport sector, specifically for rehabilitating \nroads and bridges and addressing landslides on the Efate ring road. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale  \n\n \nA. \n \nTCP  struck  Vanuatu  on  12\u201314  March  2015  as  an  extremely  destructive  Category  5 \n3. \ncyclone,  with  a  wind  speed  estimated  at  250  kilometers  per  hour  and  wind  gusts  peaking  at \n320 kilometers per hour.3 The center of the cyclone passed east of Efate Island, which is home \nto  the  capital  Port  Vila,  and  continued  southward  passing  just  west  of  Erromango  and  Tanna \nislands in Tafea Province. Heavy rainfall and destructive storm surges caused severe flooding \nand  widespread  damage,  particularly  in  Tafea  and  Shefa  provinces.  Eleven  fatalities  were \nconfirmed;  an  estimated  65,000  people  were  displaced;  and  about  17,000  buildings  were \ndamaged or destroyed, including houses, schools, clinics, and other medical facilities. \n \n4. \nThe project supports government efforts to reconstruct and improve climate and disaster \nresilience of the transport infrastructure on the Efate ring road, which suffered flood and storm \ndamage from TCP. The project includes the rehabilitation and reconstruction of 20 sites along the \nEfate ring road. All civil works were expected to be designed and implemented using the \u201cbuild \nback better\u201d (BBB) concept to strengthen resilience against future disasters and climate change \nrisks.  Works  will  also  incorporate  gender-proactive  and  universal  access  features  in  designs, \nincluding the construction of walkways and provision of access to laundry facilities in the streams \nalongside the road.4 \n  \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2015.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors: \nProposed  Loans,  Grants,  and  Administration  of  Grant  to  the  Republic  of  Vanuatu  for  the  Cyclone  Pam  Road \nReconstruction Project. Manila. \n\n3  Government  of  Vanuatu.  2015.  Vanuatu  Post-Disaster  Needs  Assessment:  Tropical  Cyclone  Pam,  March  2015. \n\nPort Vila. \n\n4  Build back better (BBB) concept (i) promotes a decentralized and participatory approach to reconstruction, (ii) uses \nlocal skills, institutions and resources, (iii) adopts climate and disaster risk reduction measures into reconstruction \nprocesses to lessen vulnerability to future risks, (iv) promotes the recovery of local livelihoods, and (vi) enables a \nmore cost-effective and sustainable recovery. \n\n\fDelivery of expected output. The project is on track to meet its output and outcome, and \n5. \nrehabilitation and reconstruction of all damaged sites included in the original project are expected \nto be completed by June 2018. This 6-month delay from the original project implementation period \nof January 2016\u2013December 2017 was caused by a delay in (i) the effectiveness of the loan and \ngrant agreements until 3 March 2016, from its signing on 1 March 2016, because Parliament was \ndissolved;  and  (ii)  the  mobilization  of  design  and  supervision  consultants  (DSCs)  because  the \ngovernment signed the DSC contract late, on 27 June 2016. \n \nSatisfactory implementation progress. The project is progressing well and is estimated \n6. \nto  be  29%  complete  against  38%  planned.  Funds  disbursed  as  of  15  May  2017  reached \n$1,596,165  (9%  of  the  total  available  funds),  exceeding  projected  targets.  The  government \ncompleted the DSC selection on 27 June 2016 and mobilized consultants on 6 July 2016. The \nDSCs include international and national consultants, 30% of whom are women, and have been \nintegrated  within  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  established  under  the  Public  Works \nDepartment of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Utilities (MIPU). The PMU, led by the DSC \nteam leader, manages project activities and coordinates with other development partners to avoid \nduplication of activities. The DSCs  assist the MIPU in project design and implementation; and \nhave  completed  a  feasibility  study  that  includes  an  engineering  option  analysis;  financial, \neconomic,  social,  gender,  environment,  land  acquisition,  and  indigenous  people  assessments; \nclimate  change  adaptation  and  disaster  risk  management  analyses;  and  detailed  engineering \ndesigns. \n \n7. \nThe DSCs also assist the MIPU in procuring a civil works contract for all 20 sites. MIPU \npublished an invitation for bids in national newspapers and on the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nwebsite on 22 January 2017, with bid submissions closing on 16 March 2017, and held a pre-bid \nmeeting on 8 February 2017. The MIPU received six bids, which they are evaluating. The civil \nworks contract is scheduled to be awarded in early July 2017. \n \nOn 6 February 2017, ADB recommended a contract variation for the DSCs to undertake \n8. \na feasibility study on and detailed designs of the expanded scope under this additional financing \nas an advance readiness action to expedite implementation of the damaged infrastructure. The \nfeasibility study includes all due diligence of the expanded scope; and the detailed designs will \ncover  engineering  designs,  geotechnical  investigations,  topography,  and  bathymetry  surveys. \nThe feasibility study and detailed designs was completed in June 2017. \n \n9. \nSatisfactory  compliance  with  environmental  safeguards.  The  project  is  classified \ncategory B for the environment. Following the environmental assessment and review framework \n(EARF) prepared for the project, the DSC prepared two environmental assessments on behalf of \nMIPU:  an  assessment  covering  eastern  Efate  (12  sites)  and  an  assessment  covering  western \nEfate (8 sites). Following review and clearance by ADB, MIPU included these assessments in the \napplication for an environmental permit and a foreshore development consent. ADB has disclosed \nthe  assessments  on  ADB\u2019s  project  website.  The  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  and \nConservation  has  issued  environmental  permits  for  all  the  sites.  MIPU  is  implementing \nenvironmental  safeguards  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and \nnational laws and regulations. \n \n10. \nSatisfactory compliance with social safeguards. The project was originally classified \ncategory B for involuntary resettlement, but was reclassified to category C. Its classification as \ncategory  C  for  indigenous  peoples  remains  the  same.  The  project  has  not  triggered  the \ninvoluntary  resettlement  safeguard  as  all  works  will  be  within  the  existing  road  corridor,  and \naccess to additional land has been negotiated with the landowners. Following the resettlement \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fframework,  MIPU  prepared  a  due  diligence  report  confirming  land  arrangements  based  on \ndetailed designs. The finalized due diligence report (including all memorandums of understanding \nand third-party validation) has been submitted by the PMU, cleared by MIPU, and disclosed by \nADB  on  ADB  project  website.  MIPU  is  implementing  social  safeguards  in  compliance  with  the \nSafeguard Policy Statement and national laws and regulations. \n \n11. \nSuccessful  management  of  risks.  MIPU  is  managing  the  risks  identified  under  the \noriginal project, and these risks do not threaten the successful implementation of the project. The \nenvisaged project risks and the actions taken to mitigate those risks are described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.5 \n \n12. \nOn-track project performance rating. As of 31 March 2017, the project is rated on track, \nwith 88.35% of contracts awarded and over 90% of funds disbursed against baseline projections. \n \nConsequent  to  paras.  5\u201312,  the  original  project  is  performing  well. 6  The  proposed \n13. \nadditional financing is required to scale up the original project to include four additional sites on \nthe Efate ring road damaged by TCP, and change the scope to cover additional work at two sites. \nThe  updated  project  complies  with  the  subproject  selection  and  eligibility  criteria  for  additional \nfinancing: (i) that it remains technically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound (paras. \n23\u201325); (ii) that it is accorded a high priority by the government; (iii) that it is consistent with the \nproject\u2019s development objectives; and (iv) that it is consistent with the current country partnership \nstrategy.7 \n  \n14. \nAdditional financing is the most suitable financing modality because (i) the additional sites \nare on the same road as the original project; (ii) as in the original project, the DSCs will undertake \nthe  feasibility  study  and  detailed  engineering  designs  (through  a  contract  variation  [para.  8]); \n(iii) the  procurement  of  civil  works  will  be  conducted  following  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2015, as amended from time to time); and (iv) the DSCs will carry out construction supervision \nthrough single source selection. Works under the additional financing will follow the continuation \nof work carried out by the DSCs. The continuity for downstream work that the DSCs will perform \nat  the  same  time  along  with  the  works  under  the  original  project  will  facilitate  continuity  in  the \ntechnical approach, experience acquired, and continued professional liability of the DSCs.  \n \n15. \nThe  additional  financing  meets  the  eligibility  criteria  and  requirements  of  emergency \nassistance loans: (i) that the government has made an official request for additional financing on \n29  December  2016;  and  (ii)  that  the  impact  on  economic,  social,  and  governance  needs  and \npriorities has been identified in the damage and needs assessment conducted in May 2015 and \nin the feasibility study of the original project conducted in December 2016. \n  \nB. \n \n16. \nThe impact will be accelerated economic and social recovery in Vanuatu\u2019s TCP-affected \nprovinces. The outcome will be socioeconomic activities restored to at least pre-TCP levels. The \nimpact and outcome statements and project outcome indicators did not change because of the \nadditional financing. \n \n                                                 \n5  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  ADB. 2010.

The  project  output  indicators  have \nbeen expanded to include the following expected outputs from the scale-up and change of scope \nunder the additional financing: \n\n(i) \n\n(b) \n\nWork conducted on additional locations on the Efate ring road damaged by TCP: \n6.2 kilometers of the Tassikiri road section upgraded, including drainage \n(a) \nimprovement; \nmanagement of Prima floodplain developed to manage floodwaters in the \nPrima (La Colle) River catchment near Prima Bridge; \nTanoliu and Ulei bridges reconstructed; and \ndrainage at Saama improved. \n\n(c) \n(d) \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nScope of work for two of the damaged sites in the original project changed because \nof the extent of the damage and unforeseen ground conditions: \n(a) \n\nEpule Bridge. The bridge was to be repaired in the original project, but it \nnow requires reconstruction with an improved road alignment. \nMarona  Bridge. Boreholes under geotechnical investigations terminated \nat a depth of 20 meters. However, data interpretation and analysis showed \nthat  the  soils  underneath  were  undergoing  liquefaction.  The  boreholes \nneed  to  be  driven  down  to  at  least  30  meters  to  confirm  the  founding \nmaterial for the bridge piles. \n\n(b) \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe updated project is estimated to cost $27.9 million (Table 1). \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA.

MIPU proposes to use the DSCs under the original project (which is financed by \nthe Asian Development Fund and ADB-administered cofinancing) to perform services under the \nadditional financing project (which is not cofinanced). As the blanket waiver of ADB\u2019s member \ncountry procurement eligibility restrictions that applied to the original project will not apply to the \nadditional financing, approval by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors is required for a waiver of Article 14(ix) \nof  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  and \nEconomic  Management  (MFEM)  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  the  MIPU  will  be  the \nimplementing agency. MIPU has established a PMU comprising the DSC team (international and \nnational consultants) and Public Works Department engineers within the MIPU for project design \nand implementation supervision services; and has established an infrastructure working group, to \nprovide  oversight  on  project  implementation  under  the  guidance  of  a  program  recovery \ncommittee. The DSCs are undertaking the required due diligence and engineering designs of the \nworks under additional financing, and will also carry out construction supervision along with the \nworks under the original project, selected through single source selection.  \n \n22. \nthe project administration manual.9 \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\n                                                 \n9  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \n\nManagement \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements\nJanuary 2016\u2013December 2018 \nPhysical completion date: 31 December 2018 \nLoan and grant closing date: 30 June 2019 \n\nProgram recovery committee \nDirector General of Ministry of Finance and Economic Management \nDirector General of Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Utilities \nDirector General of Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade \nMinistry of Finance and Economic Management \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Utilities \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting servicesa \n\nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \n\n1 contract \n\n1 contract \n\n$7.4 million \n\n$12.1 million \n\nNot applicable \nNot applicable \n$3,599,178 \n(latest revised) \n\nInfrastructure working group, project management unit, MIPU in Port Vila, \nVanuatu; 3 MIPU staff \nInternational competitive \nbidding: original project \nInternational competitive \nbidding: additional financing \nNational competitive bidding  None \nNone \nShopping \n175.75 person-months \nQuality- and cost-cased \n(design and \nselection (90:10): Original \nsupervision) \nproject \n25.00 person-months \nSingle source selection: \n(supervision only) \nAdditional financing \nRetroactive financing for the reimbursement of eligible expenditures incurred \nunder the project before the effective date of the loan and grant agreements, up to \na maximum amount equivalent to 30% of each loan and grant amount subject to \nexpenditures incurred after the emergency occurred but not earlier than 12 \nmonths before the date of signing of the loan and grant agreements \n \nAdvance contracting for consulting services  recruited by ADB and contract to be \nsigned by the government \n \nAdvance contracting for civil works procured by the government \nThe  loan  and  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \n\n$475,000 \n\nDisbursement \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank. \na  Universal procurement of services applies.

The  detailed  engineering  designs  include  measures  to  support  the  socially \nvulnerable, including women, children, and the disabled; and adopt a sustainable maintenance \nstrategy while considering future traffic growth as well as climate and disaster risks. The detailed \nengineering designs and technical specifications for construction will be determined and derived \nusing BBB principles. \n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\nB. \n \n24. \nThe Efate ring road provides transportation services to about 29,150 people in rural areas \nand 55,525 people in urban areas. It also provides increased access to and improves the quality \nof  the  transportation  network,  thereby  reducing  vehicle  operating  costs  and  travel  time  and \nimproving the reliability of access to social services. The improved road will help reduce poverty \nand increase incomes in rural areas by stimulating economic activity in tourism, local business \ndevelopment,  and  agricultural  economic  activities. ADB  will  implement  the  overall  project  as  a \nsector project under emergency procedures.10 The economic analysis of the damaged sites of the \noriginal project and the additional financing has been completed following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nthe Economic Analysis of Projects.11 The economic due diligence included demand, cost\u2013benefit, \nsensitivity, sustainability, distribution, and risk analyses. The economic internal rate of return of \nthe damaged sites is 13.20% in the original project and 20.16% in the additional financing. The \ndamaged infrastructure will not be relocated as it is within the existing right-of-way, but it will be \nreconstructed  to  higher  standards  under  BBB  principles.  The  civil  works  will  be  selected  and \nprioritized  following  the  selection  criteria,  including  financial  and  economic  considerations  that \nrequire a minimum economic internal rate of return of 9%. \n \n25. \nOutputs under the additional financing are public service goods with no cost recovery, and \nrequire no financial viability assessment and financial internal rate of return analysis. Roads and \nbridges to be constructed following BBB principles will be maintained using the MIPU\u2019s recurrent \nbudget. The financial analysis of the project finds that the country has been at a budgetary deficit \nat the gross level for 4 reported years, from 2010 to 2013. It is uncertain how the government, in \na  deficit  environment,  will  source  incremental  funds  for  the  maintenance  of  the  new  assets \nrehabilitated under the project. Given that the estimated average annual total maintenance cost \nof  the  new  assets  is  $209,600  per  year,  which  is  within  the  MIPU\u2019s  annual  maintenance  and \nreplacement capital expenditure budget of Vt500 million, the government is expected to use this \nfinancing for the maintenance of the new assets. As the outputs will have BBB features to enhance \nresilience, less strain will be placed on the operation and maintenance budget in the first 3 years. \n \nC. \n \nFinancial  management.  The  MFEM  and  the  MIPU  have  implemented  ADB-financed \n26. \nprojects, through various PMUs, including the ongoing original project.12 The PMUs carry out the \naccounting and bookkeeping for these projects while the Vanuatu PMU and the Department of \nFinance and Treasury of the MFEM monitor them centrally. Both the MFEM and the MIPU have \nbeen involved in the financial management of projects, accounting, financial reporting, and audit; \nand have gradually built their capacity. ADB has previously carried out a financial management \nassessment  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies.  The  overall  fiduciary  risk  was  rated \nmoderate; it remains manageable and will be mitigated by the qualified accountant assigned to \nthe PMU. The financial analysis of the executing and implementing agencies undertaken during \nthe approval of the ongoing original project remains valid for the additional financing.

The procurement capacity assessment of the MIPU that \nwas conducted for the overall project (footnote 12) identified a lack of procurement capacity within \nthe  MIPU.  The  DSCs  have  a  procurement  specialist  available  to  undertake  any  procurement \nrequirements,  including  providing  capacity  development  during  project  implementation  to \nstrengthen the MIPU\u2019s procurement capacity. \n \n27. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government during the inception mission for the original project and the \nfact-finding  mission  for  the  additional  financing.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 9). \n \nD. \n \n28. \nPoverty  and  social  dimensions.  The  destruction  of  critical  infrastructure  has  affected \nmany people, especially vulnerable groups. Such disaster events also create new vulnerabilities \nas they affect employment and livelihood-generating abilities, personal safety, public health and \nsanitation, household efficiency, and food production. While TCP\u2019s destruction of physical assets \noccurred in March 2015, production losses and associated higher costs of production will linger \nfor some time. The disaster\u2019s negative impact on the country\u2019s overall socioeconomic conditions \nwill be felt for many years to come. The project\u2019s expected poverty and social benefits and impacts \non local communities will be analyzed through a review of previous social and poverty analyses \nand  consultations  with  stakeholders  of  ADB-financed  projects.  PMU  has  prepared  a  summary \npoverty  reduction  and  social  strategy.  Repairs  to  roads  and  bridges  are  being  prioritized  to \nminimize secondary impacts on the economy; and to restore connectivity to essential services \nsuch as hospitals, schools, markets, and main commercial centers in Port Vila. The project will \ncontribute to the reconstruction and repair of affected critical transport infrastructure, and rebuild \ntransport networks to higher standards of disaster and climate resilience. \n \n29. \nGender.  As  in  the  original  project,  the  additional  financing  is  classified  some  gender \nelements.  While  a  gender  action  plan  is  not  required,  the  project  will  include  and  incorporate \nspecific gender features for the additional sites to ensure women\u2019s involvement. Specific targets \ninclude  30%  women  participation  in  community  meetings  and  training  sessions,  such  as \neducation  awareness  on  HIV  transmission  and  prevention  (in  coordination  with  the  HIV \ncoordinator from the Ministry of Health) and on gender-sensitive transport and road safety issues. \nAt least 20% of the grievance redress and community liaison committee members will be women. \nEmployment of women will also be encouraged during implementation. \n \n30. \nConsultation and communication. In line with ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy, the \nDSC will make all relevant project information, including safeguards implementation, available in \na timely manner and in a form and language that is understandable to the affected people and \nother stakeholders. The DSC has prepared a consultation and communication plan for the original \nproject,  which  will  be  expanded  as  required  to  cover  the  additional  sites,  communities,  and \nstakeholders. \n \nE. \n \n31. \nEnvironment. The additional financing is classified category B for the environment. It will \nprovide funds to rehabilitate a further six sites and will follow the EARF requirements prepared for \nthe  original  project,  which  follows  the  Environmental  Protection  and  Conservation  Act  (as \namended),  2010,  with  any  additional  elements  required  to  comply  with  the  Safeguard  Policy \n\nSafeguards \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fStatement. The screening undertaken during fact-finding concludes that, as in the original project, \nmost of the impacts (i) will be site-specific; (ii) are not particularly significant as the road segments \nand  bridges  to  be  repaired  will  be  reconstructed  within  their  existing  location,  i.e.,  within  the \nexisting  road  corridor;  and  (iii)  can  be  readily  mitigated  through  the  implementation  of  the \nenvironmental management plan (EMP). As established under the original project, during road \nreconstruction,  environmental  safeguards  will  follow  the  system  being  implemented  by  the \ngovernment  for  other  ADB-  or  externally  funded  projects,  where  (i)  minor  repair  works  are \nimplemented following environmental management and safety guidelines or a simple EMP; and \n(ii) major works associated with the rehabilitation or reconstruction of roads and bridges will be \nsubject  to  an  environmental  assessment  and  require  an  EMP,  which  will  be  updated  during \ndetailed  engineering  design,  incorporated  in  bid  and  contract  documents,  implemented  by \ncontractors, and monitored by the implementing agency. Monitoring will follow the monitoring plan \nin the EARF. ADB and the government will post the monitoring reports on their websites. \n \n32. \nInvoluntary resettlement. The additional financing is classified category C for involuntary \nresettlement.  The  screening  undertaken  during  fact-finding  concludes  that,  as  in  the  original \nproject, the project will be confined to the existing ring road corridor and additional access to land \nwill be obtained through negotiated settlement or land-use agreements following the approved \nresettlement framework. Due diligence for additional sites will follow the processes outlined in the \nresettlement framework; and will be reviewed, cleared, and publicly disclosed by MIPU. \n \n33. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  additional  financing  is  classified  category  C  for  indigenous \npeoples.  The  project  is not  expected  to  affect  any  distinct  and  vulnerable  group  of  indigenous \npeoples. Melanesians are the native people of Vanuatu and comprise the clear majority of the \npopulation as well as the project beneficiaries. MIPU will implement all project components in a \nculturally appropriate and participatory manner. \n \n34. \nCapacity building. The safeguards capacity of the MIPU and the Vanuatu PMU is being \nstrengthened through the mentoring and training provided by the DSCs and the parallel support \nprovided by ADB. ADB is also providing technical assistance to the Department of Environmental \nProtection and Conservation for strengthening the country safeguards system.13 \n \nF. \n \n35. \nThe overall risk is moderate, and the integrated benefits and impacts outweigh the costs. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan (footnote 5). \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nLack of procurement \ncapacity in the MIPU \nWeak financial \nmanagement \ncapacity \n\nMitigating Measures\nA procurement specialist in the PMU is carrying out all project procurement activities and is \nbuilding capacity in the MIPU\u2019s engineering staff. \nADB has previously conducted a financial management assessment and has prepared a \nfinancial management action plan, which is being implemented. MIPU maintains separate \naccounts for the project, and undertakes monthly reconciliation and verification of the \nproject account with the Department of Finance and Treasury. \n\n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2016.
