It  is  located  on  the  Nikachhu  River  in  Trongsa  district  in  the  central  region  of \nBhutan. The  project  aims  to  export  power  to  India  through  a  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP) \nand the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).2 Its design follows the successful model of the \nDagachhu  hydropower  plant  (126  MW),  which  was  financed  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) in 2008 under the Green Power Development Project.3  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nOverview.  Bhutan is currently the only South Asian country with a surplus of power for \nexport.  The  country's  installed  generation  capacity  (1,614  MW)  is  significantly  greater  than  its \ndomestic  demand  (around  300  MW);  hence  Bhutan  is  a  net  power  exporter.  Of  total  power \ngenerated, about 75% is exported to India. Hydropower generation contributes to one-fifth of the \ncountry\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  Power  exports  account  for  one-third  of  government \nrevenue, and are the primary source for government spending on socioeconomic development \nfor social services such as health, education, and rural development.4 Hydropower development \nthus forms the foundation of the economy and social system in Bhutan.  \n \n4. \nAlong with hydropower development, quality of life and overall socioeconomic status has \nsignificantly improved. Poverty decreased from 32% in 2003 to 12% in 2012. However, in spite \nof  increasing  public  spending  for  social  and  rural  development  and  an  increase  in  per  capita \nincome  (more  than  $2,500  in  2012),  Bhutan  remains  below  the  graduation  threshold  of  least \ndeveloped countries in terms of the human asset index and the economic vulnerability index as \ndefined by the United Nations.5  \n \n5. \nThe  national  electrification  ratio  has  increased  from  38%  in  2003  to  98%  in  2014; \nelectricity  for  all  is  being  achieved.  In  Bhutan,  domestic  power  supplies  are  subsidized  by \nhydropower  exports.  The  government  uses  the  energy  royalty  from  hydropower  generation  to \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Preparing the Green Power Development Project II. \n\nManila.  \n\n3   ADB.  2008.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loans,  Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grant, Technical Assistance Grant, and Administration of Grant to the Kingdom of Bhutan for \nthe Green Power Development Project. Manila.  \n\n4  Hydropower  revenues  have  enabled  high  spending  on  social  services  (health  and  education)  and  renewable \nnatural resources (agriculture, livestock, and forestry). Government spending in those areas has increased steadily, \naccounting for more than one-third of total government consumption and demonstrating the government\u2019s priority \naccorded to human development. This spending is among the highest level in South Asia. \n\n5   The  human  asset  indicators  are  based  on  nutrition,  health,  and  education  including  literacy.  The  economic \nvulnerability  indicators  include  population  size;  remoteness;  merchandise  export  concentration;  and  share  of \nagriculture, forestry, and fisheries in gross domestic product.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nreduce the domestic retail tariffs of the Bhutan Power Corporation (BPC), national transmission \nand  distribution  utility. 6 The  benefits  from  power  exports  are  thus  redistributed  to  domestic \nelectricity  users  through  the  regulatory  tariff  systems.  However,  electricity  demand  has  been \ngrowing  at  around  10%  per  year  since  2004,  and  is  expected  to  double  from  2013  to  2020. \nContinued hydropower development will be critical to contribute to export earnings and sustain \nthe  major  government  revenue,  while  keeping  affordable  electricity  prices  for  households, \nbusinesses, and industries. \n \nGovernment  initiatives.  In the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2013\u20132018), the government \n6. \ndefines \u201cinclusive green socioeconomic development.\u201d7 It states that the green economy can be \ndriven by public and private investments that enhance economic growth while reducing carbon \nemissions,  promoting  efficient  resource  use,  and  increasing  environmental  quality  and  social \ninclusiveness.  In  developing  hydropower  projects,  the  plan  requires  optimizing  approaches  to \nenhance  local  development,  private  sector  participation,  employment  opportunities,  and \nalignment  of  the  project\u2019s  corporate  social  responsibilities  with  local  community  needs.  The \ngovernment  intends  to  use  hydropower  to  promote  inclusive  development  rather  than  simply \ngenerate electricity and revenue.   \n \n7. \nADB  interventions.  The  Green  Power  Development  Project  supported  the  Dagachhu \nhydropower  plant  and  the  rural  electrification  program.  The  Dagachhu  plant,  completed  in \nAugust  2014,  was  developed  through  the  first  PPP  for  infrastructure  in  the  country.  To  export \npower  to  India,  a  project  special  purpose  company  was  established  between  the  state-owned \ngeneration  company,  Druk  Green  Power  Corporation  (DGPC)  and  an  Indian  private  partner, \nTata  Power  Company.8 Its  subsidiary,  Tata  Power  Trading  Company,  is  an  offtaker  for  the \nplant\u2019s  electricity.  The  project  was  registered  as  the  world\u2019s  first  cross-border  CDM  project. \nBhutan\u2019s clean power exports will foster regionwide climate change and economic cooperation.9 \nThe rural electrification programs have been supported by a series of ADB projects since 1995. \nThe assistance has been sequenced to maintain continuity and take into account lessons from \nprevious operations. ADB is a major contributor to the government\u2019s 100% electrification target \nby enabling electricity access of more than 40% of rural households.  \n \n8. \nADB  also  helped  the  government  formulate  the  Sustainable  Hydropower  Development \nPolicy  (2008),  which  enables  private  participation  and  foreign  direct  investment  in  hydropower \ndevelopment. While  the  government  has  focused  on  bilateral  projects  with  the  Government  of \nIndia for additional 10,000 MW capacity,10 it intends to diversify through PPP and independent \npower  producers. 11  Hydropower  development  and  energy  trade  are  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 for Bhutan.12  \n     \n\n                                                \n6   Based on the concept of an energy royalty, 15% of the power generated in Bhutan is given free to the government \nand sold from the government to BPC at regulated discount prices. As a result, electricity is supplied to domestic \nconsumers at affordable tariffs, which are substantially cross-subsidized by power exports with higher prices. \n\n7   Government of Bhutan, Gross National Happiness Commission. 2013. Eleventh Five Year Plan. Thimphu. \n8   The  project\u2019s  shares  are  held  by  DGPC  (59%),  the  National  Pension  and  Provident  Fund  of  Bhutan  (15%),  and \n\nTata Power Company (26%).  \n\n9   Bhutan\u2019s power supply is not merely a domestic issue but also a regional matter of using untapped clean energy \n\nresources; Bhutan will require a larger power supply market rather than its small domestic market. \n\n10  Based on the two governments\u2019 agreement, three projects are under construction: Punatsangchhu I (1,200 MW), \nPunatsangchhu II (1,020 MW), and Mangdechhu (720 MW), which are expected to be commissioned during 2017\u2013\n2018. Other projects are at various stages of preparation with the Indian government and its own enterprises.  \n\n11  ADB. 2014.

The prefeasibility and subsequent bid process is being supported to develop hydropower projects with PPP \nand/or independent power producers. \n\n12  ADB. 2014. Country Partnership Strategy: Bhutan, 2014\u20132018. Manila. \n\n\fLessons.  In  2013,  ADB  provided  additional  financing  to  complete  the  Dagachhu \n9. \nhydropower  development,  which  resulted  in  a  cost  overrun  of  about  17%.13 This  was  mainly \nbecause  underground  tunneling  excavations  required  extra  reinforcement  due  to  unexpected \npoor geological  conditions,  which  raised  the  cost  of civil  works  over  time. The  civil  work  costs \nwere also increased by large escalations in labor and material prices. Considering Dagachhu\u2019s \nexperience,  appropriate  contingency  and  implementation  schedules  are  considered  for  the \nNikachhu hydropower plant. \n \nSpecific features. Since 2010, in preparing the project, DGPC has conducted extensive \n10. \ngeological  investigations  that  found  80%  of  rock  conditions  tested  to  be  in  good  order.  The \nproject site and design were determined among the alternatives based on social, environmental, \ngeological,  topographical,  and  hydrological  assessments.14 DGPC  incorporated  THyE  as  the \nproject special purpose company. DGPC intends to dilute 26% of THyE to a private joint venture \npartner  through  an  international  competitive  bidding  process.15 The  offtaker  has  already  been \nselected  through  a  bidding  process  (para  18).16 The  project  is  proposed to  be  cofinanced  with \nIndian  commercial  banks  with  Indian  rupee  terms  as  the  first  foreign  commercial  borrowing \nwithout  government  credit  support  for  Bhutan\u2019s  power  sector.  This  arrangement  will  help \nmitigate  the  currency  risk  exposure.17 It  will  also  open  a  gateway  to  mix  public  sector  finance \nwith commercial project finance, which can be applied to subsequent hydropower projects with \nhigh capital investments.18 To ensure inclusive social benefits and environmental conservation, \nthe  project  will  provide  skills  training  for  employment  and  income-generating  activities, \ncommunity development support, and environmental management plans. \n \nB. \n \n11. \nbe increased clean hydropower generation in Bhutan.  \n \nC. \n \n12. \nThe  outputs  will  be  (i)  a  118  MW  hydropower  generation  plant  constructed,  (ii)  DGPC \nand  THyE  project  management  and  implementation  capacity  enhanced,  and  (iii)  hydropower \ndevelopment and trading framework improved.  \n \nD. \n \n13. \nfinancing plan is summarized in Table 2. \n                                                \n13  ADB. 2013.

The  TA  included  study  of  water  use  and  minimum \nenvironmental flow requirements for hydropower development using this project as a pilot case. Under the project \npreparatory TA, subbasin alternatives were further evaluated and the installed capacity was reduced from 210 MW \nto 118 MW for smaller safeguard impacts.  \n\n15  The  bid  criteria  will  be  the  up-front  premium,  the  value  of  which  can  be  increased  after  the  project\u2019s  financial \n\nclosure. DGPC is involved in the bid process to select the joint venture partner.  \n\n16  The project\u2019s levelized tariff over 25 years was more than 50% higher than the Dagachhu\u2019s original tariff.  \n17  The Bhutanese currency, the ngultrum is pegged with the Indian rupee in the exchange rate.  \n18  This will be the first foreign commercial term loan to DGPC without credit support from the government; it will help \nDGPC  gain  experience  with  more  commercial  funding.

The loan will have a \nmaturity of 15 years including grace and moratorium periods of 5 years, and an interest rate and \nfees  to  be  determined  by  the  credit  committee  of  each  bank  syndicated.21 SBI  has  already \nprovided its in-principle approval for its loan portion. ADB and SBI (representing the commercial \nbanks)  will  enter  into  a  separate  collaborative  cofinancing  arrangement  in  the  form  of  a \nmemorandum  of  understanding  to  ensure  the  application  of  ADB  policies  and  guidelines  on \nsafeguards,  procurement,  and  anticorruption,  and  their  related  requirements.

The project will be implemented over 5 years. After \nthe preparatory works for access roads and bridges, two procurement packages will be provided \nfor the main construction works: (i) civil works and hydromechanical equipment (part A) and (ii) \nelectromechanical  equipment  (part  B).  ADB  will  finance  both  packages,  following  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Since  the  cofinanciers\u2019 \nresources are commingled with ADF resources for part A, universal procurement applies to this \npackage.  Since  the  OCR  loan  also  finances  the  same  package,  a  separate  waiver  of  ADB\u2019s \nmember  country  procurement  eligibility  restrictions  is  requested  for  the  OCR  loan.  The \ngovernment,  DGPC,  and  THyE  have  requested  ADB  for  advance  procurement  action  and \nretroactive financing for the project.  \n \nOther  arrangements.  THyE  has  agreed  to  a  power  purchase  agreement  with  Power \n18. \nTrading  Corporation  of  India.  The  25-year  agreement  follows  a  take-or-pay  arrangement, \nappropriate penalty clauses, and an offtake payment security mechanism.

It will strategically assess sector reforms for a functional segregation of \ndistribution  and  transmission,  an  independent  system  operator,  and  a  separate  power  trading \nentity to aggregate power trading from Bhutan. It will also help improve the current hydropower \ndevelopment  policy  and  finalize  a  draft  tariff  policy  to  address  long-term  sustainable  tariff  and \nsubsidy mechanisms. The TA will support project implementation by DGPC and THyE through \nequity  financing  from  a  joint  venture\u2019s  private  partner,  and  safeguard  strengthening  and \nmonitoring to assure project compliance. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical  \n\n \nA. \n \nDGPC conducted project prefeasibility studies including geological investigations. These \n20. \nwere upgraded to feasibility studies and a qualified and experienced engineering firm prepared \na detailed project report. The project preparatory TA consultant conducted comprehensive due \ndiligence  studies,  including  extensive  field  and  laboratory  investigations  such  as  hydrological, \ngeotechnical,  sedimentation,  mechanical,  and  electrical  requirements.  Most  of  the  project \nfacilities except the dam, access roads, and transmission lines will require underground works.25 \nThe  project  is  designed  to  generate  491.5  gigawatt-hours  at  a  very  conservative  level  of  90% \ndependability.26 The plant is run-of-river, with a relatively small reservoir.27 The transmission line \nto  evacuate  power  from  the  plant  will  be  connected  to  a  substation  being  constructed  by  the \nMangdechhu  Hydroelectric  Project  Authority. 28  The  project  will  help  improve  power  supply \nreliability and efficiency in central and eastern Bhutan. \n \nB. \n \nThe economic internal rate of return is estimated at 17.31%.29 Assuming the project will \n21. \nsupply power to address India\u2019s energy deficit, the overall economic benefit to the Bhutan\u2013India \nsubregion is expected to be 21.70%. The project is financially viable with an expected financial \ninternal rate of return of 5.94% in real terms, higher than the weighted average cost of capital \n(1.84%).  The  project  will  be  self-sustaining  to  meet  operating  expenses  and  debt  service, \nmaintaining the minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.2.30 \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n24 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 The  project\u2019s  accessibility  to  the  highway  and  a  substation  is  good;  access  roads  will  be  increased  by  \n\n16.5 kilometers (km) to help excavate a 12.2 km tunnel. The 132-kilovolt transmission line will be 18.6 km. \n\n26 More  water  is  likely  to  be  available  for  90%  of  the  operating  time  than  designed  with  the  hydrological  data.  An \nadditional 323.8 gigawatt-hours of energy will be generated in a cascaded manner at the run-of-river Mangdechhu \nhydroelectric project (720 MW) in the downstream main river, since water discharged from the Nikachhu plant will \nbe released into Mangdechhu reservoir. This additional output is not captured by THyE.  \n\n27 The gross reservoir capacity is relatively small at 0.537 million cubic meters of the 0.046 square kilometers (km2) of \n\nthe reservoir surface area. \n\n28 The authority was formed in 2010. Completion of the construction works is expected in 2017.  \n29 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Financial  Analysis;  Currency  Risk  Assessment  (accessible from  the list  of  linked  documents in  Appendix  2).  The \nproject  will  fully service  foreign  debt  of  the  OCR  loan,  which  will  cover  35%  of the project  cost, under  the  stress \n\n\fThe  analysis  of  the  government\u2019s  debt  sustainability  used  methodology  defined  by  the \n22. \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Development Association.31 The public \ndebt to GDP ratio is high at 99.6%; a significant portion of the debt is related to the construction \nof  several  hydropower  projects.  In  2014,  however,  the  IMF  Article  IV  consultations  concluded \nthat  Bhutan\u2019s  risk  of  debt  distress  was  moderate  because  of  mitigation  factors,  including \nBhutan\u2019s strong track record of project implementation, committed donor support, high amount \nof international reserves, strong energy demand from India, and the favorable financing terms of \nthe  Indian  government-funded  hydropower  projects.32 The  IMF  projects  that  the  debt  situation \nwould be turned around when ongoing large hydropower projects financed by the government of \nIndia are commissioned, and that debt ratios would improve as foreign exchange revenues from \nthe  projects  start flowing  in  2017\u20132018  and  onward  with  a  beneficial  impact  on GDP,  exports, \nand fiscal  revenues. The  debt  ratios  improve  significantly  when  the  Indian  government-funded \nhydropower  projects  are  excluded  from  the  analysis  by  treating  these  loans  as  foreign  direct \ninvestment,  as  suggested  by  the  IMF.  As  a  result,  the  ADB-financed  projects  would  make  no \nbreach of debt thresholds in the baseline.  \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n \n23. \nDGPC and its subsidiaries have adopted comprehensive corporate policies and manuals \non  accounting  and  financial  management,  inventory  and  procurement  management,  internal \naudit, human resources, and safeguards. These improvements are supported by management \ninformation systems provided through an enterprise resource planning system package. DGPC \nalso  follows  the  corporate  governance  code  developed  on  globally  accepted  corporate \ngovernance  standards.33 The  external  independent  auditor  reported  that  these  entities  have \nadequate  internal  control  systems,  suitable  budgetary  control  systems,  adequate  bidding,  and \nsufficient  organizational  system  control  to  carry  out  their  operations  in  an  orderly  and  efficient \nmanner. 34  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  government,  DGPC,  and  THyE.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 23). \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n \nBased  on  social  surveys  and  broad  consultations  with  local  community  members, \n24. \nincluding farmers and women groups, THyE devised a community development plan designed \nto  share  project  benefits  with  communities.  They  include  (i)  skill  development  training  and \nlivelihood  support,  including  a  program  for  women\u2019s  groups  to  learn  commercial  weaving  in \ncollaboration  with  a  nongovernment  organization,  project-related  training  for  work,  and \ndevelopment of a sales outlet for the community to sell farming and woven products for income-\ngenerating  activities;  (ii)  the  creation  of  2,250  jobs  for  construction  works;  (iii)  infrastructure, \nincluding access roads and blacktopped farm roads to improve accessibility to education, social, \nand economic activities; and improved grid connection in communities to provide a more stable \nsupply  of  electricity;  and  (iv)  school  and  health  improvement  by  helping the  community  school \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \ntests assuming annual currency depreciation of (i) 3.5% from the past 10-year average currency depreciation and \n(ii)  7.0%  from  the  purchasing  power  parity.  THyE  will  adopt  the  foreign  exchange  fluctuation  reserve,  and  the \npower  purchase  agreement  has  provision  to  sell  partial  power  in  foreign  currency  terms  in  case  both  parties \nmutually agree with its mechanism. THyE will be covenanted to have currency hedging or alternative arrangements \nto mitigate this risk, acceptable to ADB.  \n\n31 Debt Sustainability Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 India supported full project costs with a proportion of 30% grant and 70% loan. The first loan repayment is allowed \nonly when the project is commissioned, regardless of delays, to mitigate construction risks. The power export tariff \nwill be set on a cost plus basis to cover debt service and equity return to mitigate Bhutan\u2019s debt service risks.  \n33 Based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s corporate governance principles.  \n34 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nconstruct  an  additional  facility,  making  the  construction  camp  health  clinics  accessible  to \ncommunities, and improving community sanitation by supporting a garbage compactor truck and \nwaste disposal site.  \n \nFor  the  country,  the  project  will  help  the  promotion  of  inclusive  growth.  The  energy \n25. \nroyalty will help sustain affordable electricity prices particularly for rural households, and power \nexports will generate additional government resources to promote socioeconomic development.  \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n \n26. \nThe  project  is  classified  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  category  C  for \nindigenous  peoples,  and  category  A  for  environment.  The  safeguard  documents  are  prepared \nas per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) to guide land acquisition, compensation, and \nenvironmental mitigation measures.35 \n \n27. \nResettlement.  No  affected  households  will  be  physically  displaced  or  relocated.  The \nproject will not affect any physical structure (e.g., homesteads, shops, cattle sheds, outhouses, \nwater resources and irrigation channels, and religious and cultural structures). The construction \nof  access  roads  will  require  the  acquisition  of  1.45  hectares  of  private  land  (dry  land) from  12 \naffected households including a community primary school. An additional six households will be \naffected  by  the  transmission  tower  footprint  on  0.24  hectares  of  private  land.  In  total,  18 \nhouseholds comprising 84 persons will be affected; private land acquisition will be 1.69 hectares \nof 119.38 hectares for the total project area (including government land). No indigenous peoples \nare in the project-affected areas.  \n \n28. \nEnvironment.  More  than  half  of  Bhutan\u2019s  territory  is  environmentally  protected.  The \nproject area lies in a narrow V-shaped valley. The dam site is almost vertical on the right bank \nand  inaccessible  to  people  and  most  wildlife.  This  bank  will  be  inundated  partly  in  the  buffer \nzone  of  the  Jigme  Singye  Wangchuck  National  Park, 36  while  the  other  park  area  will  be \nundisturbed. A muck disposal site will be used temporarily along the national highway in part of \na  biological  corridor,  most  of  which  is  still  available  for  wildlife  movement  between  national \nparks. 37  While  these  legally  protected  spots  are  treated  as  critical  habitat  as  per  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement,  the  project  area  itself  is  not  considered  a  critical  habitat  for  any \nthreatened species supported by the park area. Based on the critical habitat assessments and \nsome  biodiversity  experts\u2019  advice,  it  is  considered  that  there  are  no  measurable  adverse \nimpacts on high biodiversity value and functionality, and the project is not anticipated to lead to \nany  reduction  in  their  population.  The  main  project  facilities  (e.g.,  tunnels,  underground \npowerhouse, camps, and transmission line) will be on the opposite bank of the park area, which \nhas already been degraded due to a national highway, cattle grazing, human settlements, and \ndeforested  dry  land.  In  aquatic  habitats,  no  endangered  or  migratory  fish  have  been  recorded \ndue  to  a  series  of  waterfalls  in  the  downstream  of  the  Nikachhu  river.  The  minimum \nenvironmental flows will maintain at least 10% of the average lean seasonal flow, increasing to \n\n                                                \n35 Environment Impact Assessment; Resettlement Plan  (accessible from the list of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2). \nThe environment impact assessment was disclosed on 4 August 2014 and the resettlement plan on 5 August 2014. \n36 The park covers an area of 1,723 km2. It currently has about 6,000 residents in 31 villages within park boundaries, \nand another 15,000 within the buffer zone, which is 1\u20135 km wide on the periphery of the park. The buffer zone is \nconsidered as a legally protected cushion from the core zone, which is strictly protected. A small part of the park\u2019s \nbuffer zone (0.024 km2) will be inundated behind a dam. It is a very small fraction of steep slope on the edge of the \nzone (20\u201330 meters wide x 800 meters long along the river) with 0.0014% of the park area. \n\n37 This  biological  corridor  is  already  crossed  by  the  national  highway.  Of  the  5  km  width  area,  0.073  km2  will \ntemporarily be used for 1.5\u20132 years and revegetated rapidly afterward. Any construction activities in this area will \nbe disallowed at night time to avoid disrupting wildlife movements, most of which occur in the dark. Wildlife in the \narea will still have access to wide swaths of their habitat for refuge and movement. \n\n\fmore than 20% in the downstream at the confluence of the main river of the Mangdechhu.38 The \nenvironmental  flows  will  continue  to  be  monitored  and  reassessed  during  implementation  to \nensure the habitat requirements and integrated water resources management (IWRM) including \nrelevant  controls  for  plant  operations  in  the  river  basin.39 The  project  includes  environmental \nmitigation  plans,  including  continued  surveys  with  internal  and  external  monitoring  and \nreporting.40  \n \n29. \nClimate  change.  Climate  change  modeling  analyses  used  eight  climate  models  from \nvarious organizations. They project long-term water flow increases in the Nikachhu watershed, \nwhich should increase generation.41 The analyses show the project is hydrologically sound and \nits adaptation design (e.g., early warning systems) is effective. The project will have a positive \nclimate  change  impact  under  the  CDM,  eliminating  459,734  tons  of  potential  carbon  dioxide \nemissions that would otherwise be produced each year in India by use of fossil fuels to generate \nthe electricity equivalent to power export from Bhutan.  \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n \n30. \nThe  overall  project  risk  mitigations  are  adequately  measured  and  incorporated.  The \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk \nmanagement plan.42  \n \n\nRisks \nConstruction  \n\nOperations \n \n\nOfftake \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \nTime  and  cost  overruns  are  related  to  geological  surprises  and/or  unexpected  price  escalation. \nDGPC\u2019s geological investigations over more than 3.5 years found 80% of rock tested to be in good \norder. To mitigate the overrun risks, the project includes adequate contingencies (22% of the base \ncost). Contractual mitigations are also in engineering, procurement, and construction arrangements. \nThe Dagachhu\u2019s experienced staff will support the project.    \nThe plant\u2019s run-of-river hydropower operations are straightforward. THyE is staffed with experienced \nmanagement  and  individuals  from  DGPC,  which  operates  five  plants  in  Bhutan.  A  reputed  joint \nventure partner will provide additional support. \nA  long-term  power  purchase  agreement  (PPA)  was  agreed  with  the  largest  power  trader  in  India. \nThe offtaker\u2019s credit risk is further mitigated in the PPA by adequate payment security mechanism.  \n\nClimate \nchange  \nSafeguard  \n\nTransmission   The  nearest  substation  under  construction  is  expected  to  be  available  in  2017  for  an  ongoing \nproject. Once an 18.6 km transmission line is connected to this substation, the project\u2019s power can \nbe evacuated at least to the existing grid connections to India.  \nClimate  change  modeling  analyses  assess  the  Nikachhu  watershed  as  hydrologically  sound. \nAdaptation measures against disasters are reflected in the design.  \nExtensive consultations and mitigation plans have been provided. The grievance redress committee \nwas formed and an independent panel of experts is to be established to ensure safeguard activities.  \nCofinancing in Indian rupees will reduce the currency mismatch risk between the revenue and debt \n\nCurrency \n                                                \n38 Twenty-nine major and minor perennial tributaries contribute to a significant increase of the downstream flows in \naround 10 km until the confluence with the Mangdechhu river; another 6\u20137 km downstream until the Mangdechhu \nplant\u2019s tailrace, the water flows will be increased to about 30% in the lean season as well. \n\n39 IWRM is provisioned in the Sustainable Hydropower Development Policy (2008) and the Water Act (2011). DGPC \nwill establish its funding mechanisms and/or internal resources to implement sustainable IWRM for the Nikachhu \nand Mangdechhu hydropower plant operations, along with the attached TA. Countrywide IWRM is being supported \nby ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Adapting to Climate Change through Integrated \nWater Resources Management.
