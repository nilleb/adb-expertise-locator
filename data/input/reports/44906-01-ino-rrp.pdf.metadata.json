It\ns economy grew \n2. \nby  4.5%  in  2009,  in  sharp  contrast  to  the  2.8%  contraction  in  the  global  e\nconomy.  On  the \ndemand side, growth was supported by government spending, driven up 17% y\near-on-year by a \nfiscal stimulus package that allowe\nd domestic consumption, which accounted for 70% of gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  in  2009,  to  remain  strong  and  help  offset  the  negative  impact  of  the \nled by the retail \nglobal crisis on the export sector. On the supply side, economic recovery was \nment's stimulus \nsector. Construction and other services also expanded as a result of the govern\nhe highest figure \npackage. In 2010, GDP grew by 6.0%. Exports in 2010 reached $150 billion, t\never achieved in the country\n  \n3. \nThe rebound was broad based and supported by improved current and \nNoting  the  improved  government  debt-GDP  ratio  and  growing  foreign  cu\nStandard & Poor\u2019s upgraded Indonesia's foreign- and local-currency sovereign \npositive outlook, and, more recently, Moody\u2019s upgraded its local- and foreign-cur\nratings to Ba1 with stable outlook.1  \n \n4. \nnks posted a steady performance in \n2\n8 and 2009, as core profitability above average helped offset the impact of\n higher provision \ncharges.  The  10  Indonesian  banks rated  by  Fitch  posted  higher  pre-provision\n  operating  profit, \nhaving benefited from superior net interest margins as high lending yields were\n maintained and \ndeposit  rates  (with  shorter  maturities)  were  repriced  in  an  environment  of \nfalling  domestic \ninterest  rates.  Banks\u2019  aggregate  rate  of  nonperforming  loans  at  the  end  of  2\n009  was  3.8%, \nlargely unchanged from 2008. Indonesian banks are expected to further improve their financial \nperformance with the more favorable domestic macroeconomic outlook.  \n \n5. \nWith  the  sharp  downturn  in  external  trade,  loan  growth  in  2009  came  entirely  from \nrupiah-denominated loans, as foreign currency loans contracted by 20% to account for 15% of \ntotal  loans.  This  largely  reflected  commercial  banks  deliberately  reducing  foreign  currency \nexposure,  following  volatility  in  the  rupiah  and  much  tighter  US  dollar  funding  conditions  from \nthe  fourth  quarter  of  2008  to  the  first  quarter  of  2009.

With  30%  participation  in \nenergy  efficiency,  Indonesian  industry  has  the  potential  to  save  $738  million  per  year  ($362  million  in  electricity, \n$205 million in coal, and $171 million in kerosene and diesel). \n\n3   Financing $4 Billion Energy Efficiency Solutions in Indonesia, November 2009, Jakarta.  \n\nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/Events/2009/Energy-Efficiency-Solutions-INO/presentation.asp  \n\n4  The increased international oil prices drove the state energy company's costs from $0.06 per kilowatt-hour in 2004 \n\nto $0.12 per kilowatt-hour in 2008, prompting the government to provide it with a subsidy of $6.5 billion.  \n\n5  The  state  power  company  no  longer  has  access  to  subsidized  fuel,  thus  encouraging  the  development  of  other \nenergy  sources,  and  subsidies  on  high-grade  gasoline  for  vehicles  have  been  eliminated.

Across middle-\nincome and transitional economies, energy efficiency finance has most often b\neen initiated by \nECAs, whose pioneering roles in responding to market demand and facilitatin\ng access to new \ninternational  technologies  not  yet  commercialized  in  the  domestic  market,  thr\nough  term  trade \nfinance  and  leveraging  significant  opportunities  for  financing  energy  effic\niency,  are  well \ndocumented. International development partners with established policies on m\nitigating climate \nchange  and  conserving  energy  have  worked  with  ECAs  in  transitional  and\n  middle-income \neconomies  to  implement  programs  for  energy  efficiency  finance.  The  manda\nte  of  ECAs  is  to \nprovide  financial  products  that  fill  a  market  gap  and  spread  them  across  the\n  financial  sector \nusing  risk-sharing  agreements  with  participating  commercial  banks,  as  per  OE\nCD  risk-sharing \nguidelines.  ECAs  are  thus  ideally  positioned  to  be  the  first  providers  of  e\nnergy  efficiency \nfinance\u2014i.e.,  financial  products  in  response  to exporter  demand  for  energy  ef\nficiency  retrofits. \nExamples  of  market-based  finance  programs  for  energy  efficiency  develope\nd  for  ECAs  by \ninternational  financial  institutions  include  the  (i)  Thai  Eximbank\u2019s  Revolving  Fund  for  Energy \nEfficiency, initiated in 2000 and currently the recipient of up to $3.1 billion from the World Bank \nClean Technology Fund; (ii) Eximbank of Ukraine\u2019s $50 million loan from the European Bank for \nReconstruction  and  Development  (with  a  2-year  grace  period  and  7-year  term  financing)  to \nfinance  medium-  and  long-term  energy  efficiency  projects  by  which  Ukrainian  enterprises \nreduce their energy intensity; (iii) the China Eximbank Energy Efficiency Finance Project funded \nby the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in 2007, the World Bank in 2008, and the Japan \nBank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  in  2009  to  facilitate  large  energy  efficiency  loan \nprograms  for  China  Eximbank;  and  (iv)  India  Eximbank\u2019s  2009  climate  change  mitigation \n\n\f \n\n               \n\n \n\n5\n\nprogram,  funded  through  a  European  Investment  Bank  loan  of  \u20ac150  million,  to  facilitate  the \nimport of equipment for energy efficiency and \n \nC.\n\nInvestment Identification and Selection \n\nrenewable energy projects in India.  \n\n \n\nTr\n(i)  \n\n(ii)  \n\nADB  undertook  initial  due  diligence  on  the  major  state-owned  com\n17. \nincluding the largest of the 26 regional banks, over May\u2013October 2009.

In addition, each \nding loans in an \n\nPortfolio  Structure.  Indonesia  Eximbank\u2019s  asset  quality  has \nbeen  adversely \nimpacted by the global financial crisis.  However, NPLs are con\ncentrated in two \nmajor  accounts,  which  are  now  being  managed  through  r\nestructuring  and \nlitigation.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  investment  in  Indonesia  Eximbank  supports  government  policy  regarding \ninclusive growth and employment generation through private sector development.  \n \nIndonesian  President  Bambang  Yudhoyono  revealed,  while  preparing  for  the  2010  United  Nations  summit  on  the \nMillennium  Development  Goals,  his  government\u2019s  new  development  plan,  which  emphasizes  poverty  reduction  as \none  of  the  administration\u2019s  four  key  economic  policies  (the  other  three  being  supporting  economic  growth,  job \ncreation, and protecting the environment). The report forecasts gross domestic product growth of 6.0% by the end of \n201\ns  221  million  people  live  on  less  than \n$2/day. Of  those, 35 million (16%) live on less than $0.65/day, the Indonesian poverty line. The number of near poor, \nor those at risk of becoming poor if they lose a single month\u2019s income, is estimated to be 115 million. The investment \nis  consistent  with  the  country  program  and  strategy,  which  indicates  ADB\u2019s  support  to  the  government  for  quicker \nachievement of the MDGs as a major area of engagement.  \n\n0,  up  from  4.5%  in  2009.  The  report  estimates  that  52%  of  Indonesia\u2019\n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                 Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1. Key Issues  \n \nIndonesia\u2019s  strategy  to  reduce  poverty  emphasizes  absorbing  low-skilled  labor  into  productive  sectors.  This  project \ncontributes  to  this  strategy  by  raising  awareness  of  a  new  international  standard,  International  Organization  for \nStandardization  (ISO)  50001,  and  developing  energy  efficiency  finance  products  to  make  labor-intensive  exporters \nmore competitive. An additional 5,000\u20138,000 jobs can be created during the project, with 20% of them estimated to \ngo to people below the $2 poverty line.  \n \nThe  project  is  classified  as  a  general  intervention.  While  it  has  some  poverty  reduction  impact  by  generating \nemployment in labor-intensive exporters in industries included in Indonesia Eximbank\u2019s portfolio, it does not directly \naddress poverty reduction. As 50% of Indonesia Eximbank\u2019s portfolio is in manufacturing\u2014with garments and textiles, \nfood  processing,  and  furnishings  being  labor  intensive\u2014and  the  other  50%  is  in  high-capital  and  labor-intensive \nsectors such as commodities, the project has employment benefits estimated at 5,000\u20138,000 additional jobs if ADB\u2019s \n$100 million nonsovereign loan is allocated evenly between labor-intensive and other export production. The project \nbases  these  projections  on  the  methodology  outlined  in  Appendix  4,  Table  A5.2.  Capacity  development  technical \nassistance will monitor the employment impact of the ADB intervention. \n \n2.  Design  Features.  The  project  will  target  labor-intensive  exporters  in  Indonesia  Eximbank\u2019s  portfolio,  including \nthose in palm oil, garments and textiles, food processing, and furniture manufacturing. The supporting TA will closely \nent  on  ADB\u2019s  Energy  for  All  Initiative  in \ncoordinate  with  the  Reg\ny.

Indonesia Eximbank has shown interest in \nreviewing the outcome of the study, offering scope for increasing collaboration with ADB's Energy for All Initiative to \ndevelop and provide innovative financing for energy access. Maximizing access to energy for the region's poor is a \npillar  in  ADB's  2009  Energy  Policy  and  the  aim  of  the  regional  technical  assistance  Empowering  the  Poor  through \nIncreasing Access to Energy.  \n\nional  and  Sustainable  Development  Departm\nor  households\u2019  access  to  energ\n\nncluded that improved  waste management in palm oil mills offer potentia\n\neneration from Waste, co\n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nKey  Issues. The key  issues  are to ensure that the  enterprises financed  under this  project are in sectors that have \npotential to generate additional employment. As indicated in the report and recommendation of the President, 50% of \nIndonesia  Eximbank\u2019s  existing  loan  portfolio  is  in  manufacturing,  which  includes  the  labor-intensive  production  of \ngarments and textiles, processed food, and furnishings. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n               \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n17\n\nB.

The  authors  indicated  on  page  36  that  \"regaining  the  0.5%  market  share  that  Indon\nesia  once  had  would \nincrease  Indonesia's  textiles  and  garment  exports  by  $3  billion  a  year,  adding  roughly  750,000  workers  as  the  world  market  grows.  T\nhe  same  factors  that \nwould  enable  Indonesia  to  regain  its  share  of  the  textiles  and  garment  market  would  also  apply  to  its  share  of  the  furniture  and  sh\noe  markets.  In  2008, \nIndonesia  exported  some  $36  billion  of  miscellaneous  manufactured  products,  up  from  $9  billion  in  1996.  While  some  required  fe\nw  workers  (fertilizers, \nchemicals,  [and]  iron  and  steel),  others  employed  a  substantial  number  of  unskilled  workers  (for  production  of  toys,  kitchenware,  and  plastic  products). \nExpanding agricultural products, aside from established palm oil exports, also represent a big potential: fresh fruit, flowers, and some vegetables as well as \ntraditional products such as rubber, spices, and beverages can also be grown and provide jobs. These products have grown from $5.5 billion to $14.5 billion \nover the period 1996\u20132008.\" \n\n2\n4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n\f                                                                 Appendix 5 \n\n 25 \n\nADB \n\nDEMAND ESTIMATES FOR ENERGY EFFICIENC\n\nY IN SUPPORT OF THE                                  \n\nINDONESIA EXIMBANK NONSOVEREIGN INVESTMENT  \n \n\n1. \nThe  review  of  other  programs  to  finance  energy  efficiency  impleme\nsupport  by  commercial  banks  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  as  well  as  in  transit\nindicates  that  a  case-by-case  analysis  of  the  commercial  bank\u2019s  existing  po\nniche,  as  well  as  the  domestic  and  international  regulatory  environment  gu\nenterprises, are major determinants for successfully implementing energy efficie\nstudy undertaken by\nwith  support  from  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department, \nllowing  factors  as  ensuring  the  sustainable  development  of  Indonesia  E\nfo\nefficiency finance portfolio: \n\nnted  with  donor \nional  economies, \nrtfolio  and  market \niding  commercial \nncy finance.
