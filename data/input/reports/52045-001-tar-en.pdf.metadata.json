The project will support the Government of Uzbekistan to expand access to improved \nwater supply and sanitation (WSS) services for 2.9 million people in all seven cities and 15 districts \nof  Tashkent  Province.  It  will  improve  WSS  service  delivery  and  operational  efficiency  by \n(i) rehabilitating and expanding wastewater systems in seven cities; (ii) enhancing decentralized \nwastewater disposal systems in rural areas; (iii) increasing bulk and consumption water metering; \nand (iv) strengthening the institutional capacity of Tashkent Suvtaminot (TST), the provincial water \nsupply and wastewater utility. The project will complement and draw on experience from two \nongoing water supply projects funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Tashkent \nProvince.1  \n \n2.  The total project cost is estimated at $185.8 million. ADB will finance $161.0 million using \nits ordinary capital resources, and the government will contribute $24.8 million in the form of taxes \nand duties. The project supports ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2019\u20132023 for Uzbekistan, \nwhich aims to develop municipal infrastructure and services, linked to regulatory and institutional \nreform, to ensure long-term sustainability.2 This technical assistance (TA) is not listed in the \nbusiness plan. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  Tashkent Province, in the northeast of Uzbekistan, was established in 1938 and spans \nmore than 15,600 square kilometers of land with a population of about 2.95 million\u20141.45 million \nurban (49%) and 1.50 million rural (51%). Accounting for almost 30% of the nation\u2019s gross \ndomestic product, the province is recognized as one of the largest and most developed industrial \nregions in the nation. Tashkent Province has 6 major cities that are seen as key economic drivers, \n15 districts, 97 semi-urbanized rural settlements, and 885 rural villages. Three major rivers are \nregarded as vital for water supply, irrigation, and recreational water use in the province. \n \n4.  Tashkent Province suffers from persistent urban service limitations and lack of access to \nquality WSS services. Of the province\u2019s 2.95 million population, only 1.60 million (54%) have \naccess to water supply while only 0.50 million (17%) are connected to municipal wastewater \nsystems. The province\u2019s Soviet-era WSS infrastructure is decrepit, has exhausted its useful life, \nand is in need of immediate rehabilitation and renewal. \n \n5.  Ongoing  ADB-financed  projects  in  Tashkent  Province  cover  six  cities  (Akhangaran, \nAlmalyk, Angren, Bekabod, Chirchik, and Yangiyul); one urban center in Chinaz district; and \nthree districts (Chinaz, Yangiyul, and Zangiota) serving a population of 1.2 million. \n \n6.  TST, a state-owned utility company, is responsible for the management of WSS services \nin Tashkent Province. TST\u2019s institutional weaknesses include insufficient institutional structure; \ndysfunctional  and  fragmented  regulatory  and  institutional  frameworks;  poor  interagency \ncoordination; limited sector planning; unclear regulatory compliance and ineffective enforcement; \nand  lack  of  capacity  in  corporate  development,  finance  and  accounting,  human  resources \n \n1  ADB. 2016.

Strategy 20303 acknowledges that the promotion of effective, timely delivery of public \nservices to support through strengthened institutional capacity and improved quality of public \nservice delivery will help developing member countries improve governance and create an \nenabling  environment  for  sustainable  growth.  Better  management  and  maintenance  of \ninfrastructure assets and improved business operations, with greater use of information and \ncommunication technology and the adoption of international best practices, are essential\u2014setting \nthe course for ADB to help strengthen the capacity of developing member countries to improve \npublic service delivery. \n \n8.  The TA consultants will support TST to implement institutional reforms and capacity \nbuilding efforts following the institutional development road map developed for TST. The overall \npurpose of the TA is to ensure the achievement of institutional development goals and milestones \nset forth in TST\u2019s institutional development road map. \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: TST\u2019s institutional capacity strengthened and \nits operational efficiency and effectiveness improved. The TA will have the following outcome: the \nimprovement of TST\u2019s capacity in the areas of (i) institutional structure and business process, \n(ii) human resources management, (iii) financial and operational sustainability, and (iv) private \nsector participation and public\u2013private partnership contracting.4 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n10.  The expected outputs are:  \n \n11.  Output  1:  Annual institutional  development  assessment reports  prepared.  The \nreports include (i) the progress and results of TST\u2019s institutional development, reflecting key \nindicators as indicated in the road map; and (ii) evaluation of results and recommendations for \nimprovement. \n  \n12.  Output 2: Technical presentations and workshops on the subjects of WSS services \nconducted. This output comprises a series of technical presentation and training workshops on \nimprovement of operational efficiency and service performance. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, of which (i) $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by Spanish Cooperation Fund for Technical Assistance; and (ii) $400,000 will be financed \nby Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, both to be administered by ADB. \nThe key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. \n \n14.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff and some \noffice spaces for project meeting purposes. The government was informed that approval of the \nTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \n \n \n3  ADB. 2018.
