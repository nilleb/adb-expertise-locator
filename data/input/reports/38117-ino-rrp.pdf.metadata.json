It  will  finance  community-based  interventions  and  basic \nhealth services, which have few by-products. \n \nThe  Project  will  support  Government  efforts  to  reduce  and \nprevent malnutrition in about 1.48 million children under 5 years \nand 500,000 pregnant and lactating women in about 4,000 poor \nvillages,  including  poor  urban  areas  in  24  districts  and  cities  in \nthe  provinces  of  East  Nusa  Tenggara,  West  Nusa  Tenggara, \nNorth  Sumatra,  South  Sumatra,  South  Sulawesi,  and  West \nKalimantan.  The  centerpiece  of  the  Project  is  strengthening \ncommunity-based  services,  community  empowerment,  and \nsocial  mobilization \nimproved  nutrition,  hygiene,  and \nsanitation. \n \nMalnutrition  undermines  economic  growth  and  perpetuates \npoverty.  It  is  one  of  the  most  important  constraints  to  achieving \nmany  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  While  the \nnutrition status of young children in Indonesia improved from the \nlate  1970s  to  1997  because  of  a  highly  centralized  family \nnutrition  program,  it  declined  following  decentralization  in  2000. \nThe  responsibilities  of  the  highly  centralized  food  and  nutrition \nprograms were devolved to about 400 districts, which resulted in \nsignificant challenges for the planning, financing and supervising \nof these programs. Because of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 \nand  the  onset  of  decentralization,  many  nutritional  gains  were \nlost:  (i)  a  nationwide \nfood  supplementation  program  was \nintroduced  during  the  crisis,  this  has  become  the  main  nutrition \nintervention,  leaving  fewer  funds  available  for  other  nutrition \nprograms;  (ii) the  number  of  women  and  children  attending \nintegrated  community  services  posts  (posyandu)  has  declined \nbecause of lower quality services, such as growth monitoring and \npromotion;  and  (iii) behavior  change  strategies  have  been \nformative  research  and \ninadequate \nineffective  because  of \nevaluation. \n \n\nfor \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\f \n\nThe prevalence of underweight children under 5 years increased \nfrom  24.6%  in  2000  to  27.3%  in  2003,  which  implies  that  about \n5 million  children  under  5  years  have  compromised  growth, \nmotor and psycho-social development. Moreover, it is now widely \nrecognized that childhood malnutrition will lead to persistent poor \nschool enrollment and achievements and pose a long-term threat \nto  adult  productivity  and  girls\u2019  reproductive  health.  Rising \nmalnutrition  has  been  observed  in  all  regions  of  Indonesia  but \nhas  been  most  pronounced  in  the  eastern  parts  of  the  country, \nthe provinces of East Nusa Tenggara and West Nusa Tenggara, \nwhich have low human development index rankings.  \n \nThe Ministry of Health (MOH) developed a National Action Plan \n(NAP)  for  the  Prevention  of  Malnutrition  (2005\u20132009),  which \naims  to  reduce  the  prevalence  of  underweight  children  under  5 \nfrom 28% in 2005 to below 20% in 2009.  The proposed Project \nwill address issues that have led to the decline in overall nutrition \nstatus and the weakening of nutrition programs and their service \ndelivery  through:  (i)  capacity  building  so  nutrition  policies, \nprograms  and  surveillance  can  be  developed  at  central, \nprovincial  and  district  levels;  (ii)  local  government  capacity \nbuilding  so  integrated  nutrition  services  based  on  local  needs \ncan  be  planned  and  delivered;  (iii)  a  revival  of  mobilization  for \ncommunity-based  nutrition  programs;  (iv)  expansion  of  more \nfortification;  and \ncost-effective \n(v) communication  for  nutrition  behavior  change,  reinforcing  the \nimpact  of  investments  and  strengthening  the  planning  and \nmanagement of nutrition programs.  \n \nIn  line  with  the  NAP,  the  Project  will  reduce  and  prevent \nunderweight in 1.48 million children under the age of 5 years and \n500,000 pregnant and lactating women. This will provide positive \nsocial  and  economic  benefits,  including  the  avoidance  of  costs \nassociated with cognitive losses and lower productivity, and with \nhigher morbidity and mortality. \n \nOutput  1.  Capacity  building  for  the  development  of  nutrition \npolicies,  programs,  and  surveillance  will  be  carried  out  by \n(i) improving  nutrition \nreinforcing \nnutrition surveillance systems, and (iii) operations research. The \noutcome will be a more effective institutional environment and a \ngreater  capacity  for  the  development  of  nutrition  policies, \nprograms, and surveillance. \n \n \n\ninterventions,  such  as \n\ninstitutional  capacity, \n\nfood \n\n(ii) \n\nii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n\f \n\n \n\niii\n\nOutput  2.  The  quality  of,  and  access  to,  integrated  nutrition \nservices  for  at  risk  groups  will  be  improved  by  (i)  strengthening \nlocal  nutrition  services,  and  (ii)  supporting  community-based \nnutrition services. The outcome in the project areas will be more \nequitable, accessible and higher-quality nutrition services for at-\nrisk groups such as poor mothers and children. \n \nOutput  3.  Community  capacity  to  carry  out  nutrition  hygiene \ninterventions  will  be  strengthened  through  community  nutrition \npackages  and  mobilizing  community  facilitators.  The  outcome \nwill  be  greater  community  capacity  to  implement  nutrition, \nhygiene,  and  sanitation  interventions  to  prevent  malnutrition  in \nyoung children. \n \nOutput  4.  Food \nfortification  and  advocacy  and  nutrition \ncommunication  will  be  carried  out.  The  outcome  will  be \nexpanded food fortification programs and more effective nutrition \ncommunication  to  improve  mothers'  knowledge  of  child  health, \nnutrition, and child care. \n \nOutput 5. Enhanced capacity for  project management including \nplanning,  monitoring  and  evaluation \nto  support  nutrition \nprograms. \n \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $71.40  million,  including  duties \nand taxes. Of this, $9.07 million equivalent (12.70%) is in foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $62.33  million  equivalent  (87.30%)  is  local \ncurrency cost. \n \n\n \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nTotal \n \n\nTotal Cost \n50.00 \n21.40 \n71.40 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n% \n70.00 \n30.00 \n100.00 \n\n \nA  loan  of  $50.0  million  from  Special  Funds  resources  of  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  provided.

The  Government  will  provide \n$21.4 million equivalent, amounting to 30% of the project cost.  \n \nThe Government confirmed that this is a centrally funded project, \ntaking  into  account  the  fact  that  the  Project  will  directly  benefit \npoor  children  and  women  and  will  focus  on  essential  nutrition \nservices  and  community-based \nimprove \nnutrition,  hygiene,  and  sanitation  which  do  not  generate \nrevenues.  District  governments  will  provide  (i)  community \nnutrition activities in line with project objectives by the third year \nof  project  implementation,  and  (ii)  confirm  their  willingness  to \nreplicate  selected  project  activities  in  an  additional  10%  of \nvillages  or  poor  urban  areas  not  receiving  community  nutrition \npackages  in  the  project  areas  (commencing  in  the  third  year  of \nimplementation).  Beneficiaries  will  contribute \nto \ncommunity-based nutrition activities. \n \nUntil 30 September 2012 \n \n31 March 2012 \n\nin  kind \n\nthat \n\nfinancing,  and \n\nliaison  between \n\n \nThe  Directorate  General  of  Community  Health  of  the  Ministry  of \nHealth.   \n \nA  central  project  management  unit  at  the  national  level  will  be \nresponsible for coordinating national and provincial activities and \nthe  provinces.

Consultants \nwill be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nThe main benefits of the Project will be (i) reduced underweight \nand  health  and  education  benefits  in  project  areas;  (ii) more \ncommunity  empowerment  and  knowledge  of  mothers  and \ncaretakers  on  better  nutrition,  hygiene,  and  sanitation;  and \n(iii) strengthened local government capacity to plan and manage \nnutrition programs and the delivery of nutrition services. Women \nand children will be the principal beneficiaries of the Project. The \nProject  will  reach  about  1.48  million  children  under  5  years, \nabout  500,000  pregnant  women  and  lactating  mothers,  and \nschool children in 1,800 primary schools and madrasah. \n \nImproved  nutritional  status  of  women  and  children  will  directly \naffect  the  achievement  of  the  MDGs  related  to  poverty  and \nhunger  (MDG  1),  primary  education  (MDG  2),  gender  equity \n(MDG  3),  child  mortality  (MDG4),  maternal  health  (MDG  5)  and \ncombating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases (MDG 6). The \nProject  aims \nreduce  underweight  and  micronutrient \ndeficiencies  such  as  iron  deficiency  and  vitamin  A  deficiency \namong pregnant women and children under the age of 5 years. \nNutrition  will  be  improved  through  greater  maternal  knowledge, \nfeeding,  and  care  during  pregnancy  and  lactation  and  improved \ninfant  feeding  through  breastfeeding  and  timely  supplementary \nfeeding. \n \nThe  Project  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  communities\u2019 \nownership  of  their  development,  as  they  will  actively  participate \nin  selecting,  planning  and  implementing  interventions.  The \nProject\u2019s cost-effectiveness based on the cost per death averted \nranges  from  $713  to  $1,409.  Based  on  the  sensitivity  of  the \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  to  changes  in  project \ncoverage  and  participation  rates,  the  EIRR  is  expected  to  be \n15.3%.   \n \nThe Project will require the timely provision of counterpart funds \nat  national  level.  Government  needs  to  ensure  sustained \ninvestment \nin  cost-effective  nutrition-related  programs  and \nprojects  targeted  at  women  and  children.  In  the  medium  term, \nthe  sustainability  and  ongoing  impact  of  project investments  will \nrequire  growing  government  spending  and  a  commitment  to \nsustaining interventions that have been proven effective. The risk \nof sustained investment has been mitigated by ensuring selected \nproject  activities  in  at  least  10%  of  the  villages  or  poor  urban \nareas  in  participating  districts  which  did  not  receive  community \nnutrition  packages.  The possible  diversion  of  community nutrition\n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\npackages  to  uses  other  than  those  intended  will  be  mitigated \nthrough  transparency  and  broad  community  participation.  There \nwill be public disclosure of information for the use of community \nnutrition packages in each participating district  \n \nThe  wide  geographic  disbursement  of  the  project  area  is  a \nchallenge  for  project  implementation.  To  address  this,  technical \nassistance  (TA)  on  monitoring  and evaluation  and  the  fund  flow \nmechanism  is  proposed  to  help  to  ensure  efficient  project \nimplementation.  Sound  implementation  will  rely  on  the  capacity \nof  the  project  implementation  units,  so  resources  will  be \ncommitted  to  project  management  and  capacity  building  for  all \nimplementation  units  and  community  facilitators.  There  will  be \nadvanced  preparation  for  project  implementation  such  as  the \nrecruitment of consultants. \n \nThere is a risk that poor and uneducated parents may not value \nthe  interventions  and  may  not  change  their  behavior  and \nattitudes.    To  address  this,  extensive  awareness  campaigns  on \nthe  benefits  of  food  nutrition  for  children  and  women  will  be \ncarried out at the community level. Project implementation plans \nand assurances have been designed to reduce and mitigate this \nrisk. \n \nThe  TA  will  develop  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems  to \nincrease the results orientation of the Project, thus strengthening \nnutrition and evidence-based planning and budgeting for nutrition \nprograms  at  national  and  local  levels.  The  TA  will  strengthen \ninternal  and  external  accountability  to  help  prevent  fraud, \ncorruption,  misuse  of  project  funds,  and  delays  in  project \nimplementation.

In response, the Government of Indonesia, represented by the Directorate of Community \nNutrition of the Ministry of Health (MOH), requested ADB to prepare a central nutrition project1 \nin six provinces2 suffering from poor nutrition status in children under 5 years. \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nMalnutrition3 continues to undermine Indonesia\u2019s human development and is one of the \n3. \nmost  important  constraints  to  achieving  many  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs) \nrelated  to  poverty  and  hunger  (MDG  1),  primary  education  (MDG  2),  gender  equity  (MDG  3), \nchild mortality (MDG 4), maternal health (MDG 5) and combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other \ndiseases  (MDG  6).  The  Government  of  Indonesia  is  firmly  committed  to  achieving  the  MDGs, \nincluding the target of reducing the proportion of people who suffer from hunger as measured by \nthe percentage of children under 5 years who are underweight (MDG 1, Target 2). \n\n \n4. \nMalnutrition in Indonesia remains a significant public health problem for both urban and \nrural populations and since decentralization in 2000 the problem has worsened. The prevalence \nof underweight4 children increased from 24.6% in 2000 to 28% in 2005, which implies that about \n5  million  children  under  5  years  have  compromised  growth  and  cognitive  and  behavioral \ndevelopment.5 It  is  now  widely  recognized  that  childhood  malnutrition  will  lead  to  poor  school \nenrollment and achievements and pose a long-term threat to girls\u2019 reproductive health and adult \nproductivity.  \n \n5. \nIn Indonesia, the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is 40% in pregnant women. \nIDA is responsible for 25% of maternal deaths and also associated with low birth weight. About \n48% of pre-school children suffer from IDA because of the poor quality of complementary food \nand  feeding  practices  in  young  children  and  the  resulting  high  prevalence  of  underweight \nchildren.  There  are  wide  disparities  in  health  and  nutrition  outcomes  across  Indonesia,  with \n\n                                                 \n1  Responsibility  for  health  and  nutrition  has  been  devolved  to  local  governments.  However,  given  that  combating \nmalnutrition and achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is a Government priority, the Government \ndecided to use a national approach to strengthen local government capacities. \n\n2   East  Nusa  Tenggara,  West  Nusa  Tenggara,  North  Sumatra,  South  Sumatra,  South  Sulawesi,  and  West \n\nKalimantan.  \n\ninability to absorb food. \n\n3   Malnutrition  is  a  state  of  poor  nutrition,  which  can  result  from  insufficient,  excessive,  or  unbalanced  diet,  or  an \n\n4   Defined as children under 5  years  with  weight for age less than -2 standard deviations from the normal midpoint \n\ndefined by the standardized international growth curves. \n\n5   Nutrition  status  deteriorated  between  2000  and  2005  because  of  (i)  a  preference  for  supplementary  feeding \nprograms instead of community empowerment; (ii) an inadequate surveillance system because of decentralization; \nand (iii) increasing poverty. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nrural\u2013urban, geographical, and socioeconomic differentials. The disparity between provinces in \nthe  proportion  of  underweight  children  under  5  years  is  striking;  the  percentage  ranges  from \n17.9% in Bali to 41.7% in East Nusa Tenggara (Table 1).  \n \n\nTable 1:  Prevalence of Underweight in Young Children in the  \nProject Provincesa \n\n \n\n% Children Underweightb \n\n2003c \nProvince \nEast Nusa Tenggara \n40.8 \nWest Nusa Tenggara \n34.2 \nNorth Sumatra \n33.4 \nSouth Sumatra \n30.4 \nSouth Sulawesi \n31.4 \n39.1 \nWest Kalimantan \na The reduction in the prevalence of underweight between 2003 and 2005 is not significant  \n   and related to the overall expansion of complementary feeding. \nb Underweight defined as <-2 standard deviations from normal in children under 5 years. \nc National average for 2003 was 26.5. \nd National average for 2005 was 28.9. \nSource: National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS), Nutritional Status Component, 2003 and 2005. \n\n2005d \n41.7 \n33.7 \n29.9 \n26.6 \n30.7 \n33.8 \n\n \n6. \nThe  Response  to  Malnutrition. In the Government\u2019s Medium Term Development Plan \n(2004\u20132009),  reducing  malnutrition  is  identified  as  a  pillar  of  socioeconomic  development.  In \nresponse  to  the  nutrition  crisis  in  early  2005,  MOH  developed  a  National  Action  Plan  on  the \nPrevention  of  Severe  Malnutrition  (2005\u20132009). 6  This  identified  reducing  prevalence  of \nmalnutrition  to  below  20%  and  severe  malnutrition  to  below  5%  by  2009  as  priorities  for \nreducing poverty and vulnerability. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nChallenges \n\n \n7. \nDecentralization.  Decentralization  resulted  in  an  overall  decline  in  the  quality  of  basic \nhealth  services,  including  nutrition  programs,  at  hospitals;  district  health  centers  (puskesmas), \nthe  first  level  of  clinical  care;  and  integrated  community  services  posts  (posyandu),  where \ngrowth monitoring and nutrition counseling, immunization, and vitamin A distribution traditionally \noccurred.  While  decentralization  aimed  to  empower  local  institutions  and  local  governments, \nthey  were  institutionally  and  financially  unprepared  to  take  over  planning  and  management \nfunctions. The quality of the nutrition services offered by the puskesmas was adversely affected \nbecause  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  nutrition  staff  at  provincial  and  district  levels  had  not \nbeen  defined  and  staff  had  not  been  trained.  In  addition,  the  nutrition  surveillance  system \n(NSS), which provided essential information not covered by the health information system has \nnot been fully operational. The decline in posyandu services over recent years may explain the \nincrease in child malnutrition because child weighing and nutritional advice is no longer provided \nand must be obtained from other sources. \n \n8. \nThe  Asian  Financial  Crisis  and  Nutrition  Program  Responses. The economic crisis \nof 1997 had a number of consequences for the nutritional status of children. Rapid inflation led \nto  an  increase  in  food  prices  while  real  incomes  declined,  reducing  access  to  food  and  basic \nsocial services by the poor. To alleviate the social and economic distress caused by the crisis, \nthe Government established an emergency intervention, the Social Safety Net (SSN) Program, \n                                                 \n6   Ministry of Health. 2005. National Action Plan on the Prevention of Severe Malnutrition. Jakarta. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\nwhich included interventions to prevent malnutrition, such as distribution of supplementary food \nto  disadvantaged  children. 7  This  food  supplementation  program  had  some  success  in \npreventing  rapid  increases  in  malnutrition  among  young  children.  However,  following  the \ntermination  of  external  funding  for  the  program,  almost  70%  of  the  nutrition  budget  is  now \nallocated  to  supplementary  foods  instead  of  to  more  cost-effective  interventions  such  as  iron \nsupplementation  or  food  fortification.  This  means  that  essential  interventions  of  the  national \nnutrition program (particularly breast-feeding promotion and nutrition education) are neglected. \nBreast-feeding promotion is essential, since substituting breast feeding by the use of infant food \nsupplements has a strong negative effect on the nutritional status of young children. \n \n9. \nIncrease  in  Malnutrition. The national malnutrition rate increased from 24.6% in 2003 \nto  28.9%  in  2005,  defined  in  terms  of  weight-for-age  for  children  under  5  (Table  2).  Evidence \nsuggests that cohorts of children born after the Asian financial crisis in 1999 and 2000 are more \nlikely  to  be  underweight  than  those  born  between  2001  and  2003,  because  of  poor  maternal \nnutrition  during  the  crisis. 8  Increases  in  malnutrition  have  been  observed  in  all  regions  of \nIndonesia  but  have  been  most  pronounced  in  eastern  parts,  in  particular  in  Western  and \nEastern Nusa Tenggara.   \n \nSimilar  patterns  for  stunting,  as  indicated  by  height-for-age,9 and  wasting,  as  indicated \n10. \nby weight-for-height,10 are evident from national health and household survey data. In 2001, the \nnational  figure  for  prevalence  of  stunting  was  46%  and  the  prevalence  of  wasting11 was  about \n15.8%,12 with  only  moderate  rural\u2013urban  differences.    Data  show  that,  among  the  urban  poor, \nwasting  rates  have  increased  in  recent  years.13 Stunting,  on  the  other  hand,  usually  reflects \nlong-term poverty or social conditions underlying persistent and chronic malnutrition. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n7   The SSN was largely funded by the Government\u2019s Fuel Compensation Fund, which channeled targeted assistance \nto the poor through line ministries to districts for basic social service delivery. ADB assisted the SSN through two \nsocial  protection  sector  development  programs  (ADB.  1998.

Indonesia\u2019s \nmicronutrient intervention programs were generally successful until the Asian financial crisis and \ndecentralization, which reduced procurement and distribution of micronutrients such as vitamin \nA capsules and iron tablets, and overall household food consumption (because of higher food \nprices). The current prevalence of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) \nremains a concern, given the adverse impact of micronutrient deficiencies on the health status \nand  educability  of  children.  About  50%  of  children  under  5  years  suffer  from  VAD  and  this  is \nassociated  with  weaknesses  in  the  biannual  vitamin  A  supplementary  distribution  program.  In \n2001, it was estimated that about 40% of pregnant and lactating women suffered from IDA.14 A \ndescription of nutrition trends related to malnutrition and obesity is in Appendix 1. \n \n12. \nInadequate Feeding Practices. Malnutrition\u2019s most serious and lasting damage occurs \neither during pregnancy or in children under 2 years. Child weight at birth in Indonesia is slightly \nbelow international standards, but deteriorates with age, especially from about 6 months, which \nis when breast feeding becomes inadequate for an infant\u2019s nutritional intake and regular intakes \nof  nutrient-dense  complementary  foods  are  needed.  There  is  a  significant  correlation  between \nlow  birth  weight  and  underweight  of  young  children,  reflecting  conditions  of  poverty  and  poor \nfood  access  that  affect  pregnant  women  as  well  as  their  infants.15 Exclusive  breast  feeding \nlevels are declining in many places, so infants are given fewer opportunities to receive valuable \nnutrients and the protection against infection that can be derived from breast milk.16  \n \n13. \nUrbanization and Nutrition Transition. Urbanization exacerbates the transition toward \nmore  sedentary  lifestyles,  and  high-fat  diets.  This  may  lead  to  obesity  or  over-nutrition,  a \npotential risk factor for diet-related chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart diseases. The \ncauses of the nutrition transition\u2014a term used to describe shifts in diet, health and nutrition that \noccur with modernization\u2014are partly related to the increased consumption of processed foods \nrather than traditional home-made foods among the urban poor.17 The economic costs of over- \nnutrition  and  diet-related  diseases  are  increasingly  equal  to  that  of  malnutrition. 18 More \nknowledge  and  information  about  dietary  quality  is  required  and  nutritious  food  needs  to  be \nmade more affordable.  \n \n\n                                                 \n14  Helen Keller International. 2003. Nutrition and Health Trends in Indonesia (1999\u20132003). Jakarta. \n15  ADB. 2001. Improving Child Nutrition in Asia. ADB Nutrition and Development Series No. 3. Manila. \n16 There  is  anecdotal  evidence  that  increased  marketing  by  infant  formula  companies  in  recent  years  has  led  to  a \ndecline in exclusive breast feeding and an increase in the number of children who received breast-milk substitutes \nduring their first year of life.   \n\n17  The  urban  poor  live  in  a  cash  economy  and  purchase  rather  than  grow  their  own  food.  More  than  half  of \nIndonesia\u2019s poor will live in urban areas by 2010 and will depend on daily wage labor to meet their food needs.  \n18 While in low-income countries such as India, malnutrition results in 2% of GDP lost due to iron-deficiency anemia \nand  iodine  deficiency,  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  2%  of  GDP  is  related  to  diet-related  noncommunicable \ndiseases. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\nPoor Hygiene and Sanitation. Access to clean water and sanitation continues to be low \n14. \nin  Indonesia.  The  lack  of  access  to  safe  water  and  sanitation  contributes  to  the  incidence  of \ndiarrheal disease, which has a detrimental impact on children\u2019s nutritional status. About 11% of \nIndonesian children have diarrhea in any 2-week period. According to National Socoeconomic \nSurvey (SUSENAS) data, the percentage of households with access to water has declined from \n51% in 2000 to 48% in 2003, while access to household sanitation facilities increased from 53% \nin 2000 to 57% in 2003.  \n \n15.  Weakened  Nutrition  Programs.  The  integrated  community  services  post  (posyandu), \nwhich  offers  nutrition  services  related  to  infant  and  maternal  child  nutrition,  including  child \nweight  monitoring  and  nutrition  counseling,  was introduced  in  the  1980s.  Generally, posyandu \nplayed a significant role in the long period of declining malnutrition prevalence in Indonesia. The \nposyandu  are  operated  by  community-based  volunteers  who  receive  training  and  basic \nequipment  (e.g.,  weighing  scales  and  growth  charts).  The  posts  are  supported  by  trained \nnutrition  staff  from  the  sub-district  health  center  (puskesmas).  However,  since  the  late  1990s, \nnumerous studies and surveys have indicated that coverage and utilization rates have declined \nbecause of inadequate service delivery and lack of volunteer support at the community level.19 It \nis  believed  that  less  than  60%  of  puskesmas  currently  employ  any  trained  nutrition  staff, \nseverely  reducing  the  level  of  service  support  to  posyandu  and  the  quantity  and  quality  of \nservices available at the puskesmas.  \n\n \n16. \nComplementing  the  posyandu,  Indonesia  also  implemented  successful  community-\nbased nutrition programs such as the Family  Nutrition Improvement  Program (FNIP),20 with its \nfocus  on  nutrition  education  and  home  gardening,  throughout  the  1980s  and  1990s.  In  a \ndecentralized  environment,  continued  financial  and  leadership  support  for  nutrition  programs \nsuch as these requires intensive advocacy and communication to local governments and other \ncommunity structures as well as revised approaches that address local constraints (e.g., costs \nand  lack  of  volunteers).  Public  expenditure  on  nutrition  programs 21  has  declined  as  a \npercentage  of  total  health  expenditures  since  the  financial  crisis  and  decentralization.  A \nsignificant  share  of  the  available  nutrition  budget  is  allocated  to  supplementary  feeding \nprograms that are often poorly targeted and subject to leakage and other inefficiencies. These \nfinancial  commitments  are  made  at  the  expense  of  more  cost-effective  nutrition  interventions, \nsuch  as  micronutrient  supplementation,  nutrition  education  and  growth  monitoring  and \ncounseling,  especially  through  the  posyandu  system,  which  could  lead  to  more  widespread, \nsustained improvements in the nutritional status of young children and women. \n \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities \n\n17. \nRevitalizing  Community-Based  Nutrition  Services.  The  proposed  Project  is  timely \ngiven the overall decline in nutrition programs and the consequent deterioration in the nutritional \nstatus of young children and pregnant women. New approaches to nutrition service delivery and \nthe revitalization of the FNIP, which focus on the local epidemiological situation and on building \nthe technical capacity of local governments, are required.  \n \n\n                                                 \n19 The decline in the efficiency of nutrition services was the result of the change from a highly centralized approach, \nwhich  was  based  on  volunteerism  and  community  mobilization,  to  a  decentralized  approach,  which  left \nimplementation largely to the health structure in the absence of incentives for volunteers. \n\n20  The  Family  Nutrition  Improvement  Program  was  established  in  1974  as  a  community-based  approach  to \n\nstrengthen growth monitoring, nutrition education and home gardening. \n\n21  In  2005,  public  expenditure  for  health  was  0.7%  of  GDP.  The  nutrition  expenditures  from  the  health  sector \n\ndevelopment budget are 3.3%.  \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n18.  Window of Opportunity to Address Malnutrition. International experience shows that \nnutrition  programs  are  among  the  most  cost-effective  health  interventions  available.22 Nutrition \nresearch  and  programs  are  increasingly  focusing  on  efforts  to  address  malnutrition  during \npregnancy  and  the  first  2  years  of  life.  Evidence  suggests  that  losses  in  growth  and \ndevelopment  during  this  period  are  irreversible  and  have  long-term,  inter-generational \nimplications for health and productivity. Conversely, the failure to address malnutrition leads to \nmeasurable long-term economic losses and, when combined with poor education opportunities, \ncan ultimately constrain economic development. \n \n19. \nFood  Fortification.  One  opportunity  that  arises  as  populations  shift  from  consuming \nself-produced foods to processed foods is that processed foods can be fortified to improve the \nintake of vitamins and minerals. Food fortification programs such as salt iodization; fortification \nof wheat flour with iron, zinc, folic acid, other B vitamins; and fortification of palm oil with vitamin \nA  are  important,  highly  cost-effective  ways  of  addressing  micronutrient  deficiencies  for  the \nwhole population. In Indonesia further strengthening of such programs is needed.23 In addition \nto the focus on community-based nutrition programs, the Project will provide an opportunity to \nstrengthen Indonesia\u2019s national food fortification programs.  \n \n20. \nExternal  Assistance  for  Health  and  Nutrition.  Indonesia  has  received  extensive \nassistance for health and nutrition programs in the last three decades, including major projects \ntargeted  specifically  at  nutrition-related  outcomes.    The  World  Bank  has  funded  seven  health \nprojects  in  Indonesia  since  1992,  including  the  Iodine  Deficiency  Control  Project  (1997),  Safe \nMotherhood  (1998),  and  Early  Childhood  Development  (1999).  The  governments  of  Australia, \nJapan,  Netherlands,  and  United  States;  the  United  Nations  Children  Fund  (UNICEF);  and  the \nWorld  Food  Program  (WFP)  have  also  had  important  projects  covering  health  services, \nnutrition,  community  health,  child  survival,  maternal  health,  and  family  planning.  Further \ninformation on external support for nutrition can be found in Appendix 2. \n \nADB\u2019s  Opportunity.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) 2006\u20132009 highlights \n21. \nthe  importance  of  investments  to  accelerate  the  attainment  of  MDGs.24 The  proposed  Project \nwill  help  to  improve  the  quality  of  nutrition  services  and  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  the \nMDG targets. It will complement (i) maternal and child health interventions of the Decentralized \nHealth  Project  through capacity  building  for  preventive  and  curative  nutrition  interventions  and  \n(ii) community-based nutrition interventions linked to the Community Water Services and Health \nProject.  It  will  implement  the  recommendations  of  the  pilot  for  micronutrient  fortification  of  a \nJapanese  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  Project. 25  The  Project  will  build  on  lessons \nlearned from the Family Health and Nutrition Project with regard to community involvement for \nthe prevention of malnutrition and from the Health and Nutrition Sector Program on social safety \nnet program assistance during the economic crisis. The Project is timely and strategic because \nit  will  address  major  weaknesses  such  as  the  structural,  institutional,  and  organizational \nsystems  for  the  delivery  of  nutrition  programs,  a  key  area  of  concern  for  the  Government  and \n                                                 \n22 For an example of the literature that summarizes the evidence of the economic costs of malnutrition and the cost \neffectiveness  of  interventions  targeted  to  pregnancy  and  the  first  2  years  of  life  see  World  Bank.  2006. \nRepositioning Nutrition as Central to Development. Washington, DC. \n\n23 While food fortification programs are effective at addressing micronutrient malnutrition, they will not be sufficient on \ntheir own. Combined with programs such as nutrition education, they will strengthen the nutrition gains. Moreover, \ninvestment  in  fortification  now  will  deliver  long-term  gains  in  addressing  problems  such  as  iron-deficiency  that \npersist in a developing country long after the problems of acute malnutrition have subsided.  \n\n24  ADB  will  support  necessary  policy  and  institutional  reforms,  and  investments  through  the  Poverty  Reduction  and \n\nMDG Acceleration Program, a cluster program operation commencing in 2007. \n\n25  ADB. 2005.

The  Project  will  be  the  Government\u2019s  first  major  nutrition  project  since \ndecentralization  in  January  2001,  and  the  first  to  support  the  implementation  of  the  National \nAction Plan on Severe Malnutrition. \n \nLessons.  Evaluations  of  nutrition  projects 26  have  identified  a  number  of  common \n22. \nproblems,  including  (i)  low  expenditures  on  and  prioritization  of  nutrition  interventions  by  local \ngovernments; (ii) late release of funds, leading to interruptions in programs such those covering \nsupplementary  feeding  and  vitamin  A  capsule  distribution,  (iii)  limited  capacity  of  nutritional \nsurveillance  activities  at  the  local  level,  and  (iv)  inadequate  briefing  of  intended  beneficiaries \nduring  project  inception.  Specific  issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  include:  (i)  more  focus  on \nthe  sustainability  of  outputs  rather  than  the  delivery  of  inputs,  (ii)  promotion  of  local  food \nsupplementation  and  food  fortification,  and  (iii)  stronger  community  involvement  in  the  design \nphases  of  nutrition  programs.  Experience  with  integrated  nutrition  programs  in  Indonesia \nidentified specific approaches for program design and implementation that are likely to lead to \nmeasurable and sustainable improvements in nutritional status. These include the following.   \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nCommunity-based  approaches  are  effective.  Indonesia\u2019s  significant  gains  in \nnutrition  status  in  the  1980s  and  1990s  are  partly  attributed  to  the  multisectoral \nvillage-based  Family  Nutrition  Improvement  Program. 27  Changing  social  and \neconomic conditions through the late 1990s reduced the program\u2019s support and \neffectiveness  but  some  key  principles  of  implementation  remain  valid.  Others \nneed  revision  and  tailoring  in  the  context  of  decentralization  and  increasing \nurbanization. \n\nLocal  government  commitment  and  technical  capacity  are  essential. \nCommitment  from  all  levels  of  government  is  needed  to  ensure  leadership  and \nsustainability.  With  the  onset  of  decentralization,  fiscal  and  policy  responsibility \nhas been delegated to district governments, which have played a significant role \nin  determining  program  priorities.  There  is  a  need  to  translate  national  policies \ninto actions by local governments and to determine the  most efficient and cost-\neffective  program  interventions.  Continual  capacity  building  and  advocacy \nsupport is required. \n\nPartnerships for improved nutrition. The success of food fortification and other \nnutrition programs are dependent on the engagement and support of the public \nand  the  private  sector.  Policy  and  programs  that  are  limited  to  the  health  or \nnutrition  sector  will  not  ultimately  be  successful  or  sustainable  without  the  full \nengagement of such partners.   \n\n                                                 \n26  ADB.  2005.

To achieve this, \nthe  Project  aims  to  reduce  the  prevalence  of  underweight  in  children  under  5  years,  and  in \npregnant and lactating women. It will strengthen the capacity of central and local governments \nin improving the management of nutrition services. Strengthening community-based services for \nchildren  and  women,  and  social  mobilization  for  improved  nutrition  and  hygiene  is  the \ncenterpiece of the Project. The role of nutrition in the attainment of MDGs is in Appendix 3. \n \nThe Project is expected to cover about 4,000 villages in 24 districts (which includes poor \n24. \nurban  areas  in  six  cities)  in  six  provinces.28 The  participating  provinces  were  agreed  by  the \nGovernment,  ADB  and  major  stakeholders  based  on  the  following  criteria:  (i)  prevalence  of \nmalnutrition,  (ii) poverty  incidence,  and  (iii)  local  government  commitment  to  contribute \nparticipate  and  replicate  selected  project  interventions. 29 The  Project  is  expected  to  have  a \ndemonstration  effect,  which  may  lead  to  an  expansion  of  nutrition  interventions  to  other \nprovinces.  \n \nB. \n \n25. \nThe Project is designed to deliver five specific outputs: (i) strengthened capacity for the \ndevelopment of nutrition policies, programs and surveillance; (ii) improved quality and integrated \nnutrition  services  for  women  and  children  in  the  project  areas;  (iii)  enhanced  community \ncapability  for  and  implementation  of    nutrition,  hygiene,  and  sanitation  interventions;  (iv) \nexpanded  food  fortification  programs  and  strengthened  nutrition  communication;  and  (v) \nenhanced  capacity  for  project  management  including  planning,  monitoring  and  evaluation  of \nnutrition  programs.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  in  Appendix  4  contains  quantitative \nindicators for each of these outputs. The scope of the Project is divided into five outputs. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Development for Nutrition Policy, Programs, and Surveillance  \n\n \n26. \nThe  Project  will  help  to  identify  policy  choices  and  interventions  to  address  the \nunderlying  causes  of  malnutrition.  It  will  also  promote  the  reallocation  of  expenditures  from \nineffective programs to better designed, targeted, and cost-effective programs.  \n \n27. \nImproved  Institutional  Capacity.  At  the  central  level,  the  Project  will  support  the \ndevelopment  of  policies,  protocols  and  guidelines  for  food  security,  food  safety,  nutrition \nemergencies, breast feeding promotion and support, and dietary guidelines. Local action plans \nwill be developed for under- and over-nutrition. Protocols for the treatment of severe malnutrition \nwill  be  reviewed  and  hospital  and  puskesmas  staff  will  be  trained  in  their  application.  The \nProject  will  aim  to  increase  knowledge  of  nutrition  issues  among  teachers,  community-based \norganizations, and nongovernment organizations. It will finance capacity building and equipment \nfor  nutrition  surveillance.  It  will  support  a  technical  assessment  of  the  establishment  of  a \nNational Institute of Nutrition. \n\n                                                 \n28  East  Nusa  Tenggara,  West  Nusa  Tenggara,  North  Sumatra,  South  Sumatra,  South  Sulawesi,  and  West \n\n29 Classified  as  a  national  project,  participating  district  governments  have  to  confirm  willingness  to  replicate  10%  of \n\nselected project activities in the third year of project implementation.    \n\nKalimantan.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n28. \nNutrition  Surveillance  System.  The  Project  will  upgrade  the  NSS  of  the  food  and \nnutrition  surveillance  system  (FNSS)  in  order  to  strengthen  the  impact  of  nutrition  programs \nthrough  better  targeting  and  timeliness.  Stronger  data  collection  and  analysis  systems  are \nneeded,  including  systems  that  integrate  data  from  several  sectors  (e.g.,  from  health  and \nagriculture).  The  Project  will  support  long-term  training  of  staff  in  such  systems.  It  will  finance \ninformation  technology  (IT)  equipment  and  software  so  evidence-based  nutrition  planning  and \nbudgeting can be established. \n \n\n2. \n\nIntegrated Nutrition Services   \n\n \n29. \nIf  service  delivery  to  children  and  mothers  is  to  be  improved,  key  functions  of  public \nhealth  services  need  to  be  strengthened,  competencies  for  each  level  identified,  and \ncoordination with other ministries improved. The Project will explore alternative approaches for \nnutrition service delivery in poor urban and rural communities. It will focus on two demand-side \napproaches (i) increased access and quality of facility- and community-based nutrition services, \n(ii)  improved  case  management  and  its  referral  of  severely  malnourished  children,  and  (iii) \nupgrading nutrition service infrastructure and nutrition related equipment. \n \n30. \nStrengthen  Local  Nutrition  Services  (Hospitals  and  Puskesmas)  and  Referral. \nRegular  monitoring  of  children\u2019s  weight  and  growth,  breast-feeding  promotion  and  appropriate \ncomplementary feeding for children are essential to growth promotion in children under 2 years. \nBetter  referral  of  severely  malnourished  children,  expanded  outreach,  and  high-quality \ncounseling  will  strengthen  nutrition  service  delivery  by  provincial  and  district  hospitals  and  health \ncenters.30   The  Project  will  finance  supervision  of  medical  and  nursing  personnel,  training  in \ngrowth  monitoring,  and  promotion  of  breast  feeding.  The  Project  will  introduce  multi \nmicronutrient fortificants (also called \u201csprinkles\u201d) to combat anemia in children under five years \nof  age  in  the  project  areas.  Training  of  medical  doctors,  nurses,  and  nutritionists will  focus  on \ndiscouraging the use of infant formula and educating staff and caretakers about breast feeding.  \nBetter equipment and the provision of micronutrient supplements at the hospital and puskesmas \nwill improve the response to severe malnourished children.  \n \n(Posyandu).  This  subcomponent  will \n31. \nstrengthen  community  institutions  to  ensure  a  sustainable  improvement  in  nutrition  status, \nhygiene,  and  sanitation  and  related  behaviors.  Through  community  groups,  mothers  and \ncaretakers  will  be  actively  involved  in  growth  monitoring  and  nutrition  education  to  change \nbehavior  with  regard  to  child  feeding  and  caring  practices  and  will  be  trained  to  prepare \nnutritious  food.    Alternative  mechanisms  for  the  delivery  of  growth  monitoring,  promotion  of \nbreast  feeding  and  complementary  feeding  practices  will  be  identified  in  areas  where  existing \ninstitutions are no longer adequate.31  \n \n\nCommunity-Based  Nutrition  Services \n\n3. \n\nCommunity Empowerment for Nutrition \n\n \n32.  Mobilizing Community Facilitators. The intervention will finance about 900 community \nfacilitators to help build community awareness of nutrition, hygiene, and sanitation, and to train \n\n                                                 \n30 During the first 6 months of project implementation, the central project management unit will prepare a knowledge \nmanagement plan, analyzing lessons on improving access and service delivery. Funded services will include those \ndirected to families with young children under 2 years, pregnant and lactating women. \n\n31 For  example,  a  pilot  project  on  performance-based  incentives  will  be  launched,  which  will  provide  non-cash \nincentives to staff such as weighing scales and nutritious food, to encourage more family-based interventions such \nas breast-feeding promotion and child care practices. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nmembers  of  the  community  to  identify  locally  appropriate  interventions  with  regard  to  nutrition \nand  hygiene,  preparation  of  community  plans,  and  monitoring  of  activities.  The  community \nfacilitators  will  be  trained  by  an  institution  in  accordance  with  agreed  modules  to  be  prepared \nduring the first 3 months of project implementation. Details of community facilitators\u2019 roles and \nresponsibilities are in Appendix 5.  \n \n33. \nCommunity nutrition package (CNP) which is defined as assistance to improve nutrition \nand hygiene of nutritionally at-risk women and children at the community level, will be provided \nto  approximately  1,800  villages32 in  about  24  districts  for  a  period  of  3  years.  The  ceiling  for \neach CNP will be $15,000, with the exact amount based on population size, geographical area, \nand  transport  costs.  The  local  government  will  select  villages  and  poor  urban  areas  based  on \nthe  following  criteria  (i)  at  least  one  active  group  of  workers  (cadre)  per  posyandu,  (ii)  lack  of \nwater and sanitation supplies in primary schools and madrasah, and (iii) commitment of villages, \nwith the priority given to villages or poor urban areas having health care personnel. Participating \ncommunities will establish a community nutrition committee (CNC), an elected committee, which \ncan  include  representatives  of  the  posyandu  cadre.  The  core  of  the  project  design  is  that \ncommunities  will  be  empowered  to  assess  their  own  requirements  for  improved  nutrition  and \nhygiene. With the assistance of community facilitators, communities will identify CNP activities.  \nA proposal for a CNP will be prepared by the CNC within 6 months. The proposal will contain \nactivities that (i) reach families with children 0\u20132 years and pregnant and lactating women; (ii) \nenhance  and  expand  the  services  of  the  posyandu;  and/or  (iii)  provide  small-scale  water  and \nsanitation  for  primary  schools.  A  bank  account  will  be  held  by  the  CNC.  The  first  tranche \n(representing 40% of the approved CNP) will be released upon approval of the application and \nthe opening of the requisite bank account.  A second tranche of 30% of the approved CNP will \nbe released upon successful completion of at least 75% of first tranche funds. A third and final \ntranche  of  30%  will  be  released  upon  at  least  75%  of  first  and  second  tranche  funds  having \nbeen expended.  Details of the CNP are described in Appendix 5. \n \n\n4. \n\nFood Fortification and Communication \n\n34. \nFood  Fortification.  Fortifying foods and providing vitamins and other supplements are \ninexpensive ways of addressing micronutrient malnutrition and improving mental development in \nchildren.  Community-based  trials  in  Asia  on  \u201csprinkles\u201d  have  demonstrated  that  such \ninnovations  are  effective  in  reducing  the  prevalence  of  anemia.  Indonesia  already  has  a  long- \nestablished  program  of  salt  fortification  (with  iodine)  and  a  more  recent  program  of  flour \nfortification (with iron). The activity will support (i) expansion and institutionalization of national \nfood  fortification  programs;  (ii)  public  and  political  support  for  food  fortification;  (iii)  regulatory \nenforcement  of  fortification  laws;  (iv)  consumer  education;  and  (v)  upscaling  of  new  food \nfortification  methods33 such  as  vitamin  A  fortification  of  palm  oil  and  in-home  fortification  with \nsprinkles,  to  fortify  food  for  children  6-59  months.  The  Project  will  finance  (i)  staff  skills  and \nsystems  and  protocols  for  standards  and  quality  control,  and  (ii) small-scale  food  laboratory \nequipment for the detection of chemical substances in fortified food to the National Agency for \nFood and Drug (BPOM) and the Center for Research and Development on Nutrition and Food \n(CRDNF).  \n \n35. \nAdvocacy  and  Nutrition  Communication.  Recognizing  that  nutrition  education  and \ncommunication are essential to mobilize leadership and communities, the Project will support a \n\n                                                 \n32  A village is composed of several communities. \n33 These  new  fortification  methods  are  piloted  under  JFPR  9065-  Enriching  Lives  through  Food  Fortification  of  the \n\nUrban Poor.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\nrange  of  interventions  to  improve  awareness,  knowledge  and  behavior  change.  These  will \ninclude advocacy for policy makers through national round table meetings on nutrition and food \nfortification  to  enhance  public\u2013private  partnerships,  contracting  academic  and  advocacy \norganizations,  and  mobilizing  the  press  to  stimulate  public  debate  on  nutrition.  Intensive \ncommunication  campaigns  will  be  supported  to  positively  affect  key  behaviors  such  as  breast \nfeeding.  The  Project  will  support  the  design  of  advocacy,  communication,  and  social  marketing \nstrategies which most effectively lead to positive behavior change.34 \n \n\n5. \n\nStrengthening Nutrition Program, Planning, and Management \n\n \n36. \nThis  component  will  provide  project  management  support.  It  will  finance  (i)  technical \nsupport  to  implementing  agencies  for  institution  building,  nutrition  surveillance,  fortification, \ncommunication,  and  community  mobilization;  (ii)  implementation  oversight,  including  financial \nand  technical  monitoring  and  reporting  of  project  outputs;  (iii)  monitoring  and  evaluation; \n(iv) operations  research;  and  (v)  dissemination  of  project  findings  through  workshops, \npublications and websites.35  \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n37. \nCommunity  Nutrition  Packages.  Community-based  needs  assessments,  community \naction  plans,  and  direct  use  of  funds  by  the  beneficiaries  are  the  basis  of  the  project  design. \nThis is in contrast to projects that regard communities simply as recipients of health services or \nas participants in health education interventions.   \n \n\n38. \nTransparency and Accountability. Funds to improve nutrition, hygiene, and sanitation \nwill  be  channeled  directly  to  CNCs,  based  on  approved  community  action  plans.  This  will  not \nonly  strengthen  communities\u2019  capacities  to  promote  their  own  development  but  also  the \ntransparency of fund channeling, thereby reducing the possibility of possible fund misuse when \ndifferent levels of bureaucracy are involved.  \n\nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n39. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  to  be  $71.40  million  equivalent,  comprising \n$9.07  million  equivalent  (12.70%)  in  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $62.33  million  equivalent \n(87.30%) in local currency cost. The cost estimates include $0.50 million in taxes and duties and \n6.41%  of  total  costs  for  contingencies.

The steering committee will be chaired by the Deputy for Human Resources and Culture, BAPPENAS, \nand  members  will  include  senior  officials  from  participating  ministries  and  organizations,  including  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture,  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  the  Ministry  of  Industry,  the  Ministry  of  National \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\nfood \n\nfortification,  communication, \n\ninstitutional  capacity  building, \n\nproject  management  unit  (CPMU)  will  be  responsible  for  planning,  administration,  financing, \nprocurement,  training  activities  and  accounting,  and  for  liaising  between  the  provinces,  MOH, \nand ADB. The Project Director will be the Director General of Community Health and the Project \nManager will be the Director of Community Nutrition. The CPMU will be headed by the Project \nManager  and  assisted  by  a  full-time  Executive  Secretary  and  at  least  five  additional  full-time \nstaff  with  expertise  in  technical  coordination,  planning,  finance,  procurement,  monitoring  and \nevaluation. The CPMU will be supported by national and international consultants with expertise \nin \ntraining,  and  social \nmobilization.  A  central  technical  team  (CTT)  will  be  established  by  BAPPENAS,  composed  of \nministerial staff to provide technical advice to the Project and support cross-sector coordination.  \n \n43. \nThe provincial project coordination units (PPCUs) will coordinate participating agencies \nin order to synchronize activities. In each participating district, a district project implementation \nunit (DPIU) will provide technical guidance to participating villages and support the development \nand  implementation  of  CNPs,  including  selection  of  beneficiary  villages.  Each  participating \ndistrict will establish a district technical team (DTT) to assist in the evaluation of community work \nproposals37 and  oversee  the  use  of  CNPs.  Project  organization  at  the  sub-district  level  differs \nsignificantly  from  the  formal  structure  of  the  central,  provincial  and  district  governments.  The \ncommunity  nutrition  committee  (CNC)  is  an  elected  body  of  the  village.  Community  facilitators \n(CFs),  in  coordination  with  the  relevant  health  center,  will  be  responsible  for  facilitating  all \naspects  of  community  empowerment,  including  preparation  of  CNP  proposals,  growth \nmonitoring,  hygiene,  sanitation  promotion,  nutrition  education,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation. \nAppendix 7 shows the project management and implementation structure. The fund flow for the \ncommunity nutrition packages is in Appendix 8. \n \n \n \n44. \nThe Project will be implemented over 5 years, from 1 October 2007 to 31 March 2012. \nThe  first  half-year  activities  will  comprise  recruitment  of  staff;  fielding  of  consultants;  review  of \nbaseline data for monitoring and evaluation; detailed project planning; and training of community \nfacilitators  and  workshops  for  key  implementing  agents.  The  implementation  schedule  is  in \nAppendix 9. \n \n \n\nImplementation Period \n\nProcurement \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n45. \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  financed  under  the  Project  and  community \nparticipation in procurement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Goods  procured  under  the  Project  will  include:  nutrition-related \nequipment, food laboratory equipment, computers and related equipment, office equipment, and \nmotorcycles. International competitive bidding (ICB) will be used for supply contracts for goods \nestimated  at  $500,000  or  more,  and  works  estimated  at  $1.5  million  and  more.  National \ncompetitive  bidding  (NCB)  will  be  used  for  contract  goods  packages  costing  more  than \n$100,000. Limited international bidding (LIB) will be used for goods costing more than $200,000.  \nShopping  will  be  used  for  goods  and  works  costing  less  $100,000. 38  ADB  Management \napproved  the  proposed  advance  contracting  action  and  recruitment  of  consultants  during  the \nmanagement  review  meeting.  The  EA  has  been  advised  that  the  advance  action  must  follow \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nEducation,  the  Ministry  of  Social  Affairs,  the  Ministry  of  Religious  Affairs,  the  BPOM,  and  the  National  Family \nPlanning Board. \n\n37 Based on a menu of services and criteria for the use of community nutrition packages (Appendix 5), communities \n\nwill be able to choose their interventions. \n\n38 The CPMU will handle procurement using ICB, NCB, or LIB. Shopping procedures may be used by the PPCUs. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s procedures. The Government also anticipates that it will incur Project-related costs prior \nto loan effectiveness. These may form a portion of the Government\u2019s counterpart contribution. \nThe  incurring  of  such  costs  does  not  commit  ADB  to  approve  the  loan  project  and  the \nGovernment has been so notified. The procurement plan is in Appendix 10. \n \n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n46. \nAll  consultants  to  be  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  selected  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Consulting services will comprise 43 person-months international and 163 person-months \nnational  of  long-term  and  intermittent  consultants,  to  provide  specific  technical  expertise  to \nbenefit  project  implementation.  Project  implementation  consultants  will be  hired  through  a  firm \nusing  international  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  (QCBS)  for  contracts  that  cost  the \nequivalent of $200,000 or more. Terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 11. \n \n \n \n47. \nADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  the \nGovernment.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  training  of \nconsultants on financial management systems, bidding documents for the Project, and the loan \nagreement.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall \ninclude  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  records  and  accounts  of \nMOH  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to \nthe Project. The Project will incorporate certain measures to enhance governance and prevent \ncorruption,  including  (i)  complaint  mechanisms  to  ensure  that  complaints  made  by  intended \nbeneficiaries  are  addressed;  (ii)  a  requirement  to  use  information  technology  to  increase \ntransparency, accountability and efficiency in procurement; (iii) a requirement to clearly explain \nthe  Project\u2019s  objectives,  programs,  and  funding  arrangements  to  the  beneficiaries  to  create  a \nhigh level of awareness and understanding; and (iv) a transparent process of applying for and \napproving  CNPs,  including  publicizing  in  health  centers  and  community  institutions  the \nproposals received and approved or declined, and the reason for such decline. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n48. \nAn imprest account will be established at the Bank of Indonesia, with an initial advance \nceiling  of  $5  million.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and \nliquidated  in  accordance  with  ADBs  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime  to  time).  The  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedures  may  be  used  to  liquidate  or \nreplenish the imprest account. Such procedures shall apply to contracts not exceeding $100,000. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n49. \nQualified  accounting  staff,  including  financial  managers  in  the  CPMU,  PPMUs,  and \nDPIUs,  need  to  be  recruited  to  establish  sound  accounting  systems,  maintain  record-keeping \nand prepare project financial statements including the financial statement on the special account \n(FISSA) by the CPMU. The CPMU will be responsible for establishing a record-keeping system \nto ensure that all supporting documents relevant to the Project will be available for audit either \nby ADB or by an independent auditor. In line with the ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy, disbursement \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\nof  loan  proceeds  to  a  participating  province,  district  and/or  village  may  be  suspended  if \n(i) misuse  or  misprocurement  of  funds  for  community-based  activities  has  been  declared  by \nADB, and/or (ii) procurement actions have been identified as irregular. The suspension will last \nuntil  the  irregularity  has  been  corrected  by  the  district  and/or  village  concerned  to  the \nsatisfaction  of  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  annual  financial  statements  will  be  audited \nannually  in  accordance  with  generally  acceptable  auditing  standards  and  by  an  independent \nauditor acceptable to ADB. A separate audit opinion on the operation of the special account will \nbe included in the consolidated audited financial statements. The consolidated audited financial \nstatements must be in English, and must be submitted to ADB not more than 6 months after the \nclose of the financial year. Further details are in Appendix 5.   \n \n50.  MOH  has  implemented  a  number  of  similar  projects 39 financed  by  ADB  and  others \nduring the last 6 years, and its financial capacity is considered adequate. MOH will provide ADB \nwith  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project  implementation  within  15  days  of  each  calendar \nquarter period. Progress reports will be in English and include information on disbursement and \nthe status of all implementation on all aspects of the Project. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n51. \nProject  performance  will  be  monitored  and  evaluated  quarterly  through  the  Project\u2019s \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  system.  M&E  will  be  both  internal  (to  be  done  by  those \ninvolved in project implementation), and external (to be done by a contracted independent firm \nand/or  individual  not  involved  in  project  implementation). 40  The  internal  M&E  will  monitor \nimplementation  progress  of  the  interventions  against  the  indicators  and  targets  in  the  project \nframework.  After  the  Project  becomes  effective,  MOH  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports \nsummarizing  (i)  progress  made  against  indicators  and  targets;  (ii)  delays  and  problems \nencountered, and action taken to resolve problems; (iii) compliance with loan covenants; (iv) a \nproposed  program  of  activities  for  the  next  6  months;  (v)  expected  progress  during  the \nsucceeding  period;  and  (vi)  the  status  of  activities.  Quarterly  village  progress  reports  will  be \nsynthesized at the DPIU level, and summarized in one report for submission to MOH within 30 \ndays of the end of the quarter. Failure to submit adequate and timely reports by the village may \nresult in discontinuation of funding.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n52. \nThe Government and ADB will review the Project\u2019s progress jointly at least twice a year. \nA  comprehensive  midterm  review  will  be  carried  out  by  the  Government,  ADB,  and  suitable \nexternal auditors after about 400 village proposals have been approved for implementation, and \nabout  200  have  been  completed.  Within  3  months  of  project  completion,  the  Government  will \nsubmit a project completion report to ADB.  \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n39  ADB.  2000.

The  total  TA  amount  will  be  $625,000 \nequivalent.  ADB  will  finance  $500,000  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  funding  program.  The \nGovernment will contribute the balance of $125,000 in kind contribution. A detailed description \nof the TA and consultants\u2019 terms of reference is attached in Appendix 12. \n \nImpact  and  Output.  The  TA  aims  to  develop  M&E  systems  to  increase  the  results \n54. \norientation  of  the  Project  by  monitoring  progress  against  project  targets.  This  will  strengthen \nlocal  planning  and  budgeting  for  nutrition  programs.  The  output  of  the  TA  will  be  improved \nmonitoring of community-based interventions, strengthened internal and external accountability \nto help prevent fraud, corruption, misuse of project funds, and delays in project implementation. \n \n55.  Methodology and Activities.  Activities will focus on (i) the efficiency and effectiveness \nof project implementation, based on performance targets and indicators; (ii) the quality of project \noutputs,  goods  and  services  provided  under  the  Project,  especially  equipment,  training, \ncommunity  empowerment;  (iii)  the  transparency  of  the  process  and  actions  taken  by  relevant \ninstitutions and individuals; (iv) responsibilities and accountability of institutions and individuals \nfor  implementing  project  activities;  and  (v)  initial  project  benefits  and  impact  against  expected \nproject outputs and outcomes. The consultants will design and implement the M&E system for \nCPMU, PPCUs, and DPIUs. \n \n56. \nImplementation Arrangements. The Executing Agency of the TA will be MOH through \nthe  Directorate  of  Community  Nutrition,  which  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  TA \nimplementation.  MOH  will  ensure  the  appointment  of  at  least  one  qualified  senior  member  of \nstaff as coordinator for all matters pertaining to the TA and two additional members of staff to \nwork with the consultants. ADB will engage a qualified consulting firm or equivalent institution to \nimplement  the  TA.  The  firm  will  be  selected  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \n57. \nImproving  nutrition  contributes  to  productivity,  economic  development,  and  poverty \nreduction. It improves physical work capacity, cognitive development, school performance, and \nhealth by reducing disease and mortality. The primary beneficiaries of the Project will be poor \nchildren under  5  years and  pregnant  women.  It  is  estimated  that  the  Project  will  benefit  about \n1.48  million  children  under  5,  about  500,000  pregnant  and  lactating  women,  and  children  in \n1,800 elementary schools and madrasah in districts with high levels of malnutrition. Key project \nbenefits will include reductions in malnutrition among young children and women, better access \nto micronutrients, and lower levels of nutrition-linked infectious diseases. The Project will reduce \nanemia  and  chronic  energy  deficiency  among  women  of  reproductive  age,  which  will  lead  to \nmore  productive  and  healthy  lives.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in \nAppendix 13.   \n \n58. \nSocial  Benefits.  The  Project  will  result  in  (i)  reduced  prevalence  of  underweight  and \nincreased  community \nincreased  health  and  education  benefits \nempowerment  and  better  awareness  of  nutrition  and  hygiene;  and  (iii)  strengthened  local \ngovernment  capacity  to  plan  and  manage  nutrition  programs,  and  to  deliver  nutrition  services. \n\nin  project  areas;  (ii) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\nin \n\nlower  maternal  morbidity  and  mortality, \n\nfewer \nBetter  nutritional  status  will  result \nintergenerational  effects  on  children\u2019s  cognitive  and  physical  development,  maternal  stunting, \nand iron and iodine deficiencies. Improving maternal and child care will reduce the incidence of \nlow birth weight and related malnutrition and chronic diseases. Better nutrition in young children \nwill also reduce the likelihood that they will become obese later in life and decrease associated \ndiet-related  noncommunicable  diseases.  Better  accessibility  to  fortified  food  will  enhance  child \nand maternal survival and improve the mental development and intelligence of children. Women \nand adolescent girls will benefit from increased awareness of general nutrition, breast feeding, \nchild  care,  and  child  feeding  practices.  The  Project  will  actively  involve  women  in  decision-\nmaking for community-based interventions through their involvement in CNCs and their work as \ncommunity  facilitators  and  health  professionals.  During  project  implementation  measures  to \ninclude  communities  with  indigenous  peoples  will  be  carried  out  throughout  the  community \ntranslation  of \ngrants  process  (including \ncommunication material in appropriate languages). \n \n59. \nEconomic Benefits. The Project will generate significant economic benefits by reducing \n(i) direct losses through physical productivity, (ii) indirect losses from poor cognitive losses and \nloss in schooling, and (iii) losses in resources from increased health care costs.  There will be \neconomic  benefits  to  the  communities  through  (i)  reductions  in  premature  morbidity  and \nmortality, (ii) better productivity in adults, (iii) enhanced cognitive development and educational \nattainment  in  children,  and  (iv)  reductions  in  low  birth  weights.  Community-based  programs \ntargeted at children under 2 years are cost-effective at preventing malnutrition.  The economic \nanalysis is in Appendix 14. \n \nB. \n\ntraining,  participatory  planning,  and \n\nProject Risks and Assumptions \n\nfacilitator \n\n60. \nFinancial, Technical, and Social Risks. Project implementation plans and assurances \nhave been designed to reduce and mitigate risks. The Project will require the timely provision of \ngovernment  counterpart  funds  at  central,  provincial  and  district  levels.  In  the  long  term,  the \nsustainability  and  ongoing  impact  of  project  investments  will  require  increasing  budgets  for \nnutrition  and  a  commitment  to  make  budget  allocations  for  cost-effective  interventions  that \nprevent  and  reduce  malnutrition.  The  risk  of  counterpart  funding  not  being  provided  has  been \naddressed  by  requiring  written  commitments  from  provincial  and  district  governments  to \nreplicate  project  activities  upon  project  completion.  Another  financial  risk  is  the  possible \ndiversion  of  CNPs  to  uses  other  than  those  intended.  This  risk  will  be  mitigated  through \ntransparency  and  broad  community  participation.  Public  accountability  meetings  on  the  use  of \nCNPs will be held in each participating district.41  \n \n61. \nThe  wide  coverage  of  the  project  area  is  a  challenge  to  project  implementation.  To \naddress  this,  the  project  management  and  organization  structure  and  fund  flow  arrangements \nhave been designed to mitigate challenges to project implementation. Community facilitators will \noversee  the  implementation  and  monitoring  of  activities  financed  under  CNP.  Funds  will  be \ndirectly  channeled  to  the  village  bank  accounts.  The  complementary  TA  project  aims  to \nstrengthen performance monitoring and evaluation of community-based activities. Sound project \nimplementation will rely on the capacity of CPMU, PPCUs, DPIUs, and CNCs. The risk of weak \nproject  implementation  will  also  be  mitigated  by  the  resources  committed  to  project \nmanagement and capacity building for all implementation units, by facilitator support for CNCs, \n                                                 \n41  The  Project  will  disseminate  information  through  posters,  signboards,  and  meetings  in  health  centers  and \ncommunity facilities. Conditions will be monitored through trained community facilitators working at the village level \nand direct channeling of funds to the beneficiaries has been shown to reduce the misuse of funds in community-\ndriven development programs in Indonesia. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\nThere  should  be  no  adverse  physical  impact.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  not \n\nand  by  advanced  preparation  for  project  implementation  and  consultant  selection.  Inadequate \ncapacity  of  community  groups  may  lead  to  poor  performance,  so  the  Project  will  strongly \nsupport  and  monitor  community-based  activities.  The  Project  will  emphasize  technical \nassistance  support  through  consultants  and  facilitators  to  ensure  informed  choices  are  made \nfrom a range of technically feasible options.  \n \n62. \nThere is also a risk that poor and uneducated parents and caretakers may not value the \ninterventions and may not change their behavior and attitudes. To address this, the Project will \ncarry out an extensive awareness campaign at the community level to promote the benefits of \ngood nutrition for children and women, and to address specific needs and priorities of the poor. \nThe likelihood of success will be improved through operations research, training of community \nfacilitators and careful monitoring. \n \n63. \nenvisaged as the Project supports the upgrading of existing health and nutrition facilities. \n \nSustainability. The Project is designed to facilitate the sustainability of interventions at \n64. \nboth institutional and financial levels. The Project includes five design features that will increase \nthe probability of the nutrition interventions being sustainable. First, the Project aims to replace \ncurrent  expensive  nutrition  interventions  by  more  cost-effective  programs  such  as  food \nfortification  and  micronutrient  programs.  Second,  district  governments  will  provide  formal \ncommitments  to  replicate  interventions  in  an  additional  10%  of  villages  beginning  in  the  third \nyear of implementation. Third, the Project will revitalize the  posyandu,  which have traditionally \nprovided maternal and child health services in villages.  Fourth, the Project will actively involve \ncommunities  and  invest  in  capacity  building  for  community-based  services  for  improved \nnutrition,  hygiene,  and  sanitation.  Improved  knowledge  and  resulting  behavior  change  will \nbenefit  future  generations.  Fifth,  investments  in  advocacy  and  communication  for  decision-\nmakers responsible for identifying priorities and allocating resources are essential for ensuring \nsustainability. In South Sulawesi, local governments are already financing nutrition workers. The \nretention  of  community  facilitators  will  be  based  on  performance  and  discussed  with  local \ngovernments during project implementation. \n \nAssumptions.  A  key  assumption  is  that  economic  growth  and  increased  public \n65. \nexpenditure  on  health  and  nutrition  will  be  sustained  at  national  and  local  levels.  A  related \nassumption is that MOH and related stakeholders will plan and spend funds effectively. A wide-\nranging advocacy and information campaign for decision-makers and the public will reduce the \nrisk of funds being wasted.   \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n66. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n(i) \n\nCommunity Nutrition Packages. Villages nominated to apply for CNP will have \nat  least  1  active  cadre  per  integrated  services  post,  and  lack  of  water  and \nsanitation  supplies  in  primary  schools  and  madrasah,  and  commitment  of  the \nparticipating  villages  and  cities  with  the  priority  given  to  areas  with  health \npersonnel. \n\n \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n \n\n \n\n19\n\nVillages eligible to apply for a CNP will elect a 10-member CNC with at least 60% \nof the CNC members being women.  \n\nFunds will be released to participating villages and cities in three tranches. The \nfirst tranche 40% of the approved CNP amount will be released upon approval of \nthe proposal and opening of the CNC bank account.

Despite advances made in reducing the burden \nof  malnutrition  from  the  late  1970s  to  1997,  recent  national  data  indicate  that  27.5%  of \npreschool  children  are  moderately  or  severely  underweight  (weight-for-age  <  \u20132  standard \ndeviations  [SD]  from  the  National  Health  Care  Survey  [NHCS]  reference).1   Over  the  last  14 \nyears, the prevalence of underweight among pre-school children decreased from 37.5% (1989) \nto 27.5%, a relative decline of almost one-third. This decrease has not been as pronounced as \nthe  reductions  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  Thailand  over  the  same  period.  The \nprevalence of severe underweight (weight-for-age < \u20133 SD from the NHCS reference) actually \nincreased  during  the  period  immediately  following  the  Asian  financial  crisis  of  1997.  The \nobservation  of  an  increase  in  severely  underweight  prevalence  is  further  substantiated  by  the \nfact that the number of severe cases of underweight children who visited the nutrition clinic at \nCenter  for  Research  and  Development  of  Food  and  Nutrition  (CRDFN)  also  increased  during \nthe same period, despite significant efforts to improve food intake through various interventions. \n \n2. \nThe increase in the number of cases of severely underweight children began as early as \n1995, the point at which economic growth was at its height. This implies that factors other than \nthe  economy  are  implicated  in  undernutrition,  such  as  the  status  of  women,  child  care, \nhousehold hygiene, access to medical care, and household purchasing power. \n \nFrom  1997  until  2003,  the  prevalence  of  severely  underweight  children  was  10%, \n3. \ncompared with 6.3% in 1989. During the crisis, severe clinical forms of underweight, including \nmarasmus2 and kwashiorkor,3 became headlines news in Indonesia and abroad. Such incidents \nhave  not  completely  disappeared,  and  recent  \"outbreaks\"  of  clinical  undernutrition  in  Nusa \nTenggara Barat (NTB) have caused concern.   \n \n4. \nAs seen in Table A1, the prevalence of underweight show similar trends over time, with \nsome  initial  decline  through  the  1990s  which  halted  following  the  economic  crisis  of  the  late \n1990s.  \n  \n\nTable A1: Trend in Prevalence of Underweight in Indonesia, 1989\u20132003 \n(Weight for age < -2 SD, and < -3SD) \n\n1989 \n37.5 \n\n1992 \n35.5 \n\n1995 \n31.6 \n\n1998 \n29.5 \n\n1999 \n26.4 \n\n1999 \n26.4 \n\n2001 \n2000 \n24.6%  26.1 \n\n2002 \n27.3 \n\n2003 \n27.5 \n\n6.3 \n\n7.2 \n\n11.6 \n\n10.5 \n\n8.1% \n\n8.1% \n\n7.5 \n\n6.3 \n\n8.0 \n\n8.3 \n\nItem \n\n< \u20132 SD \n(Underweight) \n< \u20133 SD \n\n(Severe \nUnderweight) \n\nSD = standard deviations. \nSource: National Socioeconomic Survey (Susenas) data sets, Nutritional Status Component, 1989\u20132003. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   2003. Central Bureau of Statistics. SUSENAS.  \n2   Marasmus  is  one  component  of  protein-energy  malnutrition  occurring  among  very  young  children,  particularly \n\nunder famine conditions, in which a mother\u2019s milk supply is greatly reduced. \n\n3   Kwashiorkor is caused by severe protein deficiency and common in young children weaned to a diet consisting of \n\nstarchy food. \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nData  from  the  national  maternal  and  child  survey  in  2001  noted  that  the \n5. \nprevalence  of  wasting  (weight-for-height  <  \u20132  SD)  throughout  the  country  was  15.8%  and  the \nprevalence of stunting was 46%.  These levels actually reflect a slight deterioration in nutritional \nstatus  over  the  past  5  years.  A  graphical  representation  of  trends  in  the  prevalence  of \nunderweight, stratified by location is presented in Figure A1. \n \n\nFigure A1: Trends in the Prevalence of Underweight by Location,  \n1989\u20132003 \n\n \n\nCurrent Epidemiological Evidence of Overweight  \n\n6. \nThere are two major sources of data that facilitate the analysis of nutritional status data \nfrom  cross-sectional  surveys  (including  SUSENAS  and  the  maternal\u2013child  health  survey)  and \nlongitudinal  data  from  the  nutritional  surveillance  system  implemented  by  Helen  Keller \nInternational  (HKI).    The  sample  frames  for  these  two  data  sources  are  very  different  and \nconsequentially they lead to different estimates of the magnitude of the problem and differences \nbetween locations.  \n \nB. \n \nWhile  malnutrition  remains  a  major  public  health  problem  in  Indonesia,  the  national \n7. \nnutrition program must recognize that obesity is on the rise and there will need to be appropriate \nmeasures  in  place  to  address  it.    The  nutritional  surveillance  data  of  the  HKI  survey  in  2003 \nindicated  that  the  prevalence  of  overweight  body  mass  index  (BMI  >  25)  among  adult  women \nmay already be from 20% to 25% and, as has been seen in other countries in the region, many \nof these women may have children who are underweight.   \n \n8. \nThe  particular  challenge  of  obesity  is  that  it  affects  the  urban  poor  as  a  result  of  poor \ndiets and a sedentary lifestyle. SUSENAS data from 1989 and 1998 suggest certain shifts in the \nprevalence  of  obesity  among  school-aged  children.  Specifically,  the  prevalence  of  obesity \namong  school  children  in  rural  areas  increased  more  than  six  times  from  1989  to  1999,  while \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n23 \n\nthe  prevalence  of  obesity  in  urban  areas  among  school  children  increased  by  more  than  four \ntimes.  The  extent  to  which  poor  quality  food  consumption  (caused  by  the  lack  of  affordable \nnutritious  foods  and  poor  food  choices)  has  on  both  under-nutrition  and  obesity  needs  to  be \nfurther  examined.    More  information  is  needed  on  the  caloric  density  of  foods  and  the \nassociated  costs  of  these  foods  consumed  among  children,  adolescents,  and  adults  in  the \nurban population, including among the urban poor.   \n \n9. \nData suggest that the prevalence of overweight is increasing in almost all age groups. In \nthe  period  1999\u20132001,  the  prevalence  of  overweight  (BMI  25\u201327)  in  rural  areas  ranged  from \n10%  in  younger  adults  (20\u201324  years  of  age)  to  over  25%  in  adults  aged  35\u201344  years  of  age, \nand  increased  each  year  of  data  collection.  The  pattern  was  similar  in  urban  and  rural  areas, \nalthough the absolute levels were higher among the urban population.4 \n \n10. \nDuring  a  health  transition,  the  incidence  of  acute  infectious  disease  and  acute \nmalnutrition decline, while rates of chronic diseases and malnutrition rise. Both sets of problems \ncontinue to co-exist, leading to a \u201cdouble burden\u201d of nutritional problems, often within the same \nhousehold.5   \n \n11. \nThe  double  burden  is  more  prevalent  in  urban  than  in  poor  areas,  where  demographic \nchanges and disparities are most pronounced.  Malnutrition and obesity are both linked to poor \ndietary  intake  and  limited  diversity.    Low  caloric  and  nutrient  intake  in  children  can  lead  to \nhormonal imbalances that predispose them to obesity and chronic diseases when they age.6 \n \n12. \nEarly prevention of obesity is a cost-effective public health approach and avoids the high \nsocial and economic costs of nutrition-related chronic diseases. The emphasis can no longer be \nsolely on increasing the quantity of food available to the urban poor; there needs to be a shift \ntoward  promoting  good  quality  foods,  as  well  as  to  healthy  activity  patterns  and  feeding \nbehaviors.   \n \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n4   Helen Keller International.

The  project  aims  to  (i) \nimprove the capacity of local  governments to facilitate, \nregulate,  and  deliver  quality  services  in  water  and \nsanitation to the target communities; (ii) strengthen the \ncapacity  of the community to  design, co-finance, build, \noperate,  and  manage  community\u2013based  water  supply \nand  sanitation  facilities;  (iii)  improve  access  to  water \nand  sanitation  services \nthrough  construction  of \nadequate  facilities  based  on  community  demand;  and \n(iv)  increase  hygiene  awareness  through  information, \neducation, and communication campaigns. \n \n\nimprove \n\nindicators  of \n\nthe  health  of \n\nThe  project  will  help \nthe \npopulations in the project area, as measured by health\u2013\nrelated \nthe  Millennium  Development \nGoals,  through  better  primary  health  care  services \nfocusing  on  the  needs  of  women,  infants,  children  and \nthe  poor.  The  purpose  of  the  project  is  to  improve \nhealth  services  in  8  provinces  and  90  districts  and \ncities.  \nDuring  2005,  the  Government  of  Indonesia  and  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  agreed  to  refocus  project \nactivity  on  maternal,  neonatal,  and  child  health \n(MNCH). \n \n\nThe  objective  of  the  project  was  to  improve  the  health \nof the population in all districts of the project provinces \nby improving access, delivery and quality of health and \nfamily  planning  services,  with  special  attention  paid  to \nthe  poor  and  vulnerable  groups.  In  the  context  of \ndecentralization,  the  project  aimed  to  strengthen  local \ncapacity  in  health  services  delivery,  including  planning \nand  management.  The  project  also  aimed  to  improve \ncost\u2013efficiency  and  sustainability  of  health  and  family \nplanning  services  in  the  project  districts,  through \nappropriate investments and sector reforms. \nDuring  2005,  the  Government  of  Indonesia  and  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  agreed  to  refocus  project \nactivity  and  to  concentrate  on  maternal,  neonatal  and \nchild health.   \n \n\nThe  project  was  designed  to  improve  the  health  and \nnutritional status of the population and ensure that this \nimproved health status was sustained. \nThe project had three objectives: \n(i) \n\nto  increase  the  capacity  of  the  families  and  their \nvillage communities to make informed decisions  \n\nSecond Decentralized \nHealth Services Project \n\n$100,000,000 \n\n2005\u20132009 \n\nDecentralized Health \nService Project \n\n \n\n$50,531,000 \n\n2001\u20132006 \n\nFamily Health And \nNutrition Project  \n\n$54,707,000 \n\n1996\u20132001 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nProject \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal Value of \nProjects \n\nPeriod of \nImplementation \n\n \n\nObjectives \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\n(ii) \n\nand  take  actions  to  directly  improve  health  and \nnutrition of their members; \nto  improve  the  capacity  of  the  health  service \nproviders  to  provide  quality  services,  with  the \nsupport and participation,  when necessary of local \nleaders and local government; and  \n\n(iii)  to reduce the total fertility rate in the project area. \n\nThe project was designed to maintain and improve the \nhealth of the poor by: \n(i)  providing  health  protection  with  health  support \n\n(subsidy) for the poor;  \n\n(ii)  guaranteeing  health  services  access  for  the  poor \n\nwho have health card; and \n\n(iii)  preventing  deaths  of  mothers  and  babies  in  poor \n\nfamilies. \n\nThe principal objectives of the project were to: \n(i)  protect the health and nutritional status of the poor, \nparticularly pregnant women, mothers, infants and \nchildren; \n\n(ii)  maintain the quality of health services; and \n(iii)  facilitate continued availability of family planning \n\nservices for the poor. \n\nprograms:  malaria, \n\nThe  objective  of  the  project  was  to  improve  MOH \ncapacity,  especially  at  district  and  peripheral  levels,  to \nmanage  the  more  important  communicable  disease \ncontrol \nacute \nrespiratory infections in children under 5 years of age.

Malnutrition erodes human capital, \n1. \nreduces resilience to shocks, and reduces productivity (impaired physical and mental capacity). \n \n2. \nGoal  2:  Achieve  Universal  Primary  Education.  Malnutrition reduces mental capacity. \nMalnourished children are less likely to enroll in school, or more likely to enroll later. Hunger and \nmalnutrition reduce school performance. \n \n3. \nmore likely to stay in school and to have more control over future choices.  \n \n4. \nGoal  4:  Reduce  Child  Mortality.  Malnutrition  is  directly  or  indirectly  associated  with \nmore than 50% of all child mortality. Malnutrition is the main contributor to the burden of disease \nin the developing world. \n \n5. \nGoal  5:  Improve  Maternal  Health.   Maternal health is compromised by an anti-female \nbias  in  allocations  of  food,  health  and  care.  Malnutrition  is  associated  with  most  major  risk \nfactors for maternal mortality. \n \n6. \nGoal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Other Diseases. Malnutrition hastens onset of \nAIDS  among  people  who  are  HIV-positive.  Malnutrition  weakens  resistance  to  infections  and \nreduces malarial survival rates. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nImproved nutrition status \nof children

To \nensure  sustainability  of  interventions,  the  Project  will  replicate  some  activities  in  an  additional \n10% of village, which did not receive community nutrition packages (CNPs). \n \n2. \nSelection  of  Villages. The ceiling of each CNP will be $15,000, with the exact amount \nbased  upon  such  factors  as  population  size,  geographical  area,  and  transport  costs.  About \n1,800  villages  in  24  districts  including  poor  urban  areas  will  receive  CNP.  Local  governments \nwill  select  villages  after  expressions  of  interest  have  been  received  from  community  nutrition \ncommittees (CNCs).1 Each village will elect and establish a 10-member CNC and at least 60% \nof  the  members  will  be  women.  The  members  of  the  CNC  will  select  a  chair,  treasurer  and \nsecretary. The head of the district of health office (DHO) will nominate villages and poor urban \nareas  eligible  to  apply  for  a  CNP  based  on  the  following  criteria:  (i)  at  least  1  cadre 2 per \nposyandu,  and \nin  primary \nschools/madrasah,  and  (iii)  commitment  of  villages  or  poor  urban  areas  having  health  care \npersonnel. The district technical team (DTT) will review CNP proposals and submit them to the \ndistrict project implementation unit (DPIU) for final review and approval or denial. The DPIU will \nnot have the right to reject the proposed activities if they meet the eligibility criteria. For those \nproposals  that  are  approved,  a  letter  of  agreement  will  be  signed  by  the  CNC  and  the  DPIU. \nAfter signing, the CNC will establish a bank account which will require the joint signatures of the \nCNC chair and the treasurer to make a withdrawal. \n \nCommunity  Facilitators.  Community  facilitators  (CFs)  with  expertise  in  nutrition, \n3. \nhygiene,  sanitation  and  community  mobilization  will  be  selected  through  a  process  of \ncompetitive  recruitment  based  on  their  qualifications  and  competence.  They  will  be  trained  by \nthe central project management unit through private institutions. About 900 CFs will be hired for \na period of up to four years. One CF will provide support to up to two villages. At least 50% of \nCFs will be women. CFs, in coordination with the relevant health center, will be responsible for \nall aspects of community empowerment, including implementation, Pursuant to DPIU approval \nof proposals, the Project will provide CNPs to approximately 1,800 villages. The CNC will have \nup  to  6  months  to  prepare  and  submit  the  proposal  to  the  DPIU.  If  the  CNC  is  not  be  able  to \nsubmit  the  proposal  within  6  months,  an  alternative  village  will  be  selected  from  a  long  list \nselected by local government. \n \nDisbursement  Arrangements.  For  community-level  activities  and  investments,  the \n4. \nGovernment will make payments directly to bank accounts held by the CNCs. Disbursement will \nbe subject to the establishment of a CNC, an approved village or community action plan, and a \nsigned contract between the CNC and the DPIU.  DPIUs will monitor community bank accounts \nand provide the central project management unit with bank account statements and supporting \ndocuments for consolidation 10 days after the end of every month. For the flow of funds to the \nCNC,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  has  recommended  to  channel  CNP  funds  to  the  provincial  level \n(deconcentration fund). \n \n5. \nThe  proposal  outlines  a  detailed  program  of  activities.  The  first  tranche  (representing \n40% of the approved CNP) will be released upon approval of the application and the opening of \nthe  requisite  bank  account.    A  second  tranche  of  30%  of  the  approved  CNP  will  be  released \n\n                                                 \n1   The CNC will be an elected committee and can be composed of members of the posyandu cadre. \n2   Volunteer staff responsible for posyandu services. \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nupon successful completion of at least 75% of first tranche funds, and a third tranche of 30% will \nbe  released  upon  at  least  75%  of  first  and  second  tranche  funds  have  been  expended.    The \nCNC will provide quarterly progress reports, including progress on financial management, to the \nDPIUs. \n \n6. \nPreparation  of  Community  Nutrition  Empowerment  Proposals.  Districts  will  assign \nDTT  (composed  of  dinas  staff  and  community-based  organizations  such  as  women\u2019s \norganizations)  to  conduct  the  \u201cintroduction  phase\u201d  for  CNPs  and  ensure  that  eligible  villages \n(i) understand the importance of nutrition and hygiene improvement, (ii) are informed about the \nopportunity  to  receive  CNP  to  improve  nutrition  and  hygiene  in  the  community  as  well  as  to \nstrengthen posyandu activities, and (iii) understand the mechanism of proposal preparation and \napplication as  well  as  the  selection  process  and  complaint  mechanism.  Community  facilitators \nwill help villages to prepare the community action plan. The proposals will be prepared by the \nCNC, supported by the community facilitators who will undertake a local needs assessment and \nactivities for nutrition improvement.  \n \nThe  proposals  will  be  prepared  by  the  CNC  and  assisted  by  the  CFs  based  on  local \n7. \nneeds  to  improve  the  nutrition  status.  The  proposals  shall  meet  the  following  criteria:  (i) \ndemonstrate that activities reach key target beneficiaries, especially children under 2 years and \npregnant  or  lactating  women;  (ii) enhance  and  expand  the  services  of  the  posyandu,  and  (iii) \nprovide small-scale water and sanitation for primary schools and madrasah. The CNC will have \nup  to  six  months  to  prepare  and  submit  the  proposal  to  the  DPIU.  Proposals  will  be  reviewed \nthrough  a  transparent  process  that  involves  the  DPIU,  which  will  review  them  for  technical \nfeasibility.  The  DPIU  will  conduct  an  initial  ranking  of  proposals  based  on  objective  criteria, \nwhich will be agreed upon during the first 3 months of the Project. The DPIU will have no veto \nrights  on  proposed  community  activities.  The  Food  and  Nutrition  Council  (or  an  equivalent \nmultisectoral  body  at  the  district  level)  will  review  the  proposals  and  recommendations  of  the \nDPIU  and  will  provide  final  comments.  In  order  to  prevent  local  elites  from  dominating  the \ndecision-making  process,  the  groups  of  community  representatives  will  require  at  least  50% \nrepresentation by women in different age groups and different socioeconomic status.  \n \n8. \nMenu  of  Services.  Communities  will  be  able  to  use  project  funds  to  strengthen \ncommunity-based activities to improved nutrition and hygiene. Communities will to assess their \nown requirements and, with the assistance of community facilitators, will identify the activities to \nbe funded by the grants, including activities directed at (i) families with children (0\u20132 years) and \npregnant and lactating women, (ii) families with children between 2 and 5 years, (iii) posyandu, \nand (iv) primary schools. \n \n\n(i) \n\nfrom \n\nCommunity-based  services  for  children  0\u20132  years,  pregnant  and  lactating \nmothers.

The  objective  is  to  reinforce  growth \nmonitoring  and  nutrition  counseling,  especially  on  exclusive  breast  feeding, \nappropriate complementary and feeding practices, and balanced diets.  \n\n(iv) \n\nBetter  hygiene  in  primary  schools  and  madrasah.  The  objective  is  to \nstrengthen the provision of water and sanitation and reinforce hygiene promotion.  \n\n \n9. \nProposed  Use  of  CNP.  Communities  should  use  CNPs  to  enhance  their  existing \nservices and institutions, including posyandu and selected primary schools. No labor costs will \nbe  financed  by  CNP.  The  community  nutrition  packages  may  be  used  in  the  participating \nvillages  for  the  following  activities:  (i)  upgrading  the  facilities  of  the  posyandu;  (ii)  child  growth \nand  development  monitoring  (such  as  weighing,  nutrition  counseling,  etc.);  (iii)  nutrition \npromotion  and  education,  i.e.,  feeding  of  infants  and  young  children;  (iv)  mother\u2019s  classes \nengaged  in  child  care,  breast  feeding,  toys  and/or  books,  cooking  demonstrations;  (v)  small \nscale  water,  hygiene  and  sanitation  in  primary  schools  and  madrasah;  (vi)  training  school \ncanteen  staff  and/or  food  vendors  on  food  hygiene  and  safety;  (vii)  purchase  of  impregnated \nbed nets; and (viii) a maximum of 5% of the value of the community nutrition package may be \nused  to  support  CNC  operational  costs,  e.g.,  transport  costs  to  bank,  office  supplies  and \nstationery.  \n \nIneligible  Expenditures. The CNP will not finance the following items and/or activities: \n10. \n(i)  labor;  (ii)  transport  costs;  (iii)  salaries  for  CNC  and  health  workers;  (iv)  complementary \nfeeding,  vitamins  and/or  micronutrients  financed  under  the  national  complementary  feeding \nprogram (MPASI); (v) operational costs of posyandu; and (vi) posyandu scales.  \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n \nTable A6.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Component \n($ million) \n\n  \n\nADB \n\nItem \nA.

Undernutrition 1  and  micronutrient  malnutrition  are \nthemselves direct indicators of poverty and may be linked to income poverty. Evidence suggests that the prevalence \nof malnutrition is often two or three times higher among the poorest income quintile than among the highest quintile.2 \nImproving nutrition is pro-poor and increases the income-earning potential of the poor. Poverty is associated with poor \ndiets,  physically  demanding  labor,  unhealthy  environments  and  high  fertility.  Malnutrition  reduces  health,  education \nand income, thus perpetuating poverty. Nutrition programs are very cost-effective. The 2004 Copenhagen Consensus \nof  eminent  economists  concluded  that  the  returns  from  investing  in  micronutrient  programs  are  second  only  to  the \nreturns from fighting HIV/AIDS.  \n \nMalnutrition  is  endemic  in  Indonesia,  despite  improved  socioeconomic  indicators,  including  the  incidence  of  poverty. \nWhile poverty contributes to malnutrition, particularly severe malnutrition, knowledge and customs of child caring and \nchild  feeding  are  important  determinants  of  malnutrition.  In  Indonesia,  significant  levels  of  malnutrition  are  not  only \nrelated to the poor but also to the non-poor (suggesting that not only  low incomes but also education, behavior and \nattitudes,  child  care,  and  child  feeding  are  important  determinants  of  malnutrition).  Community-based  programs \ntargeted at children under 2 years are cost-effective in preventing undernutrition. \n \n\n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                            Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (MDG) \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?   \nBy  reducing  the  prevalence  of  malnutrition,  strengthening  the  delivery  of  nutrition  services,  and  empowering \ncommunities  to  improve  nutrition,  the  Project  will  make  a  positive  contribution  to  reducing  poverty.  The  benefits  will \nextend not only to young children and  women but to families  who bear the burden of health care costs. The returns \nfrom investing in nutrition are very high. \n\nAnalysis  of  the  nutritional  status  of  children  under  5  years  and  household  income  in  Indonesia  indicates  that  child \nmalnutrition is not only found among the poor and vulnerable, but is concentrated on low-income households. There is \nno evidence that boys are favored over girls as the prevalence of malnutrition among females under 5 years of age is \nslightly  lower  than  for  males.  Urban-rural  differences  for  poverty  are  much  greater  than  urban-rural  differences  for \nnutrition. Absolute poverty is a poor proxy for nutritional status, as the income distribution in Indonesia is very flat with \n60%  of  the  population  clustered  around  the  poverty  line.  While  markets  are  failing  to  address  malnutrition  (because \nmany households cannot afford adequate food or health care), malnutrition occurs also among the non-poor because \nof ignorance of the breast feeding practices for young children and pregnant women and because growth faltering and \nmicronutrient deficiencies cannot be easily detected by caretakers.  \n\nOther factors have a significant impact on  malnutrition, including customary feeding  and child rearing practices, and \nhygiene  and  diarrheal  diseases. To  some  extent,  Prevalence  of  diarrheal  diseases  is  correlated  with  access  to  safe \nwater.  Consumption  of  prepared  foods  increases  with  income,  including  food  with  little  nutritional  value.  In  crowded \nurban  areas,  lack  of  adequate  kitchen  facilities  and  the  high  cost  of  cooking  fuel  make  purchase  of  prepared  or \nprocessed  foods,  even  for  the  very  young  children,  a  cheap  option.  Snack  foods  are  cheap  and  represent  a  large \nproportion of household expenditure at all expenditure levels but particularly at lower income levels.   \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  poverty  strategy  is  founded  on  targeting  districts  with  chronically  high  malnutrition  rates,  taking  into \naccount population size and relative levels of income poverty and channeling services through the institutions used by \nthe  poor,  such  as  health  centers  (puskesmas)  and  revitalization  of  community-based  services  (posyandu).    The \nProject brings nutrition services closer to the community and will make them more accessible to the income poor. The \ncommunity empowerment component is intended to enable communities how to take responsibility for the nutritional \nstatus of their children and mothers.  This component is also expected to demonstrate that community empowerment \nis both affordable and effective. Strengthening nutrition services helps to ensure that improved nutritional services and \nadvocacy will continue beyond the project. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Poor nutrition may occur in association with infection. Three most commonly used indexes for child undernutrition \n\nare height-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-height. \n\n2   Gwatkin, R. et al. 2003.

Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nParticipation  is  integrated  in  the  overall  project  design.  Strengthening  community-based  interventions  such  as  the \nposyandu  is  a  central  part  of  the  Project.  The  success  of  the  community  empowerment  component,  which  is  a  key \npillar  for  all  other  project  activities,  will  be  closely  related  to  the  engagement  of  community  members  in  operations \nresearch  and  development  of  communication  materials.  The  Project  will  actively  seek  the  participation  of  agencies \nsuch as the Ministry of Home Affairs, the National Food and Drug Agency, the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of \nNational Education. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe  Project  is  self-targeted  since  it  aims  to  improve  the  nutritional  status  of  pregnant  and  lactating  women  and \nchildren.  It  addresses  the  specific  needs  of  women  in  their  reproductive  and  primary  caretaker  roles.  Men  are  not \nexcluded from the project, as they are sometimes caretakers and decide on household priorities. Specific targets have \nbeen set for component 2 to ensure gender balance in the training of nutritionists and other health staff as well as the \nengagement of community facilitators. Women will probably be the carers of malnourished and sick children and will \nthus bear the financial burden of health care costs. The achievement of the Project\u2019s purpose and objectives will have \nbenefits for both women and men. Changing attitudes and behavior towards nutrition, child feeding and child care in \nboth  women  and  men  will  directly  benefit  women  and  their  children.  The  communication  component,  peer-to-peer \neducation, and other interpersonal communication such as nutrition counseling will directly address these perceptions \nand  behaviors  as  they  affect  women  and  children.    The  project  design  is  based  on  careful  consideration  of  gender \nissues  and  ensures  women\u2019s  participation  in  all  activities.  Gender-specific  features  will  be  supported  by  loan \ncovenants.  \n\nWomen  are  primary  focus  of  the  Project  since  their  nutrition  during  pregnancy  and  breast  feeding  is  key  as  is  their \nresponsibility for their households' dietary choices and food preparation.  \n\nProject  investments  accrue  first  to  women  and  then  to  the  family  and  the  community  as  a  whole.  Integrating  and \nprioritizing  policies  that  deliver  the  greatest  nutritional  benefits  will  ensure  that  women  in  their  roles  as  mothers  and \nchildren will get optimal benefits from government nutrition programs.  \n\nAs  nutrition  services  are  mainly  delivered  through  the  health  system  a  comprehensive  review  of  programs  and \nprotocols,  improvement  of  training  materials,  and  training  medical  and  nursing  staff  in  nutritional  services  including \nbreast-feeding  promotion  and  in  outreach  programs  is  required.  Targets  will  be  set  for  ensuring  gender  balance  in \ntraining of medical and nursing professionals who are primarily female, taking into account their areas of specialization \nand  responsibilities.  Community  facilitators  experienced  in  nutrition  (mainly  female)  and  in  sanitation  (mainly  male) \nbridge  the  formal  health  system  and  outreach  programs  and  the  community.  Proposed  loan  covenants  ensure  that \n50% of community facilitators will be female.  \n\nThe outreach programs are interventions related to child feeding and child care, hygiene and sanitation, breast feeding \nand  links  to  essential  health  services,  including  home  visits  by  midwives  and  posyandu  cadre  and  referrals.  The \nprograms  are  delivered  by  women  as  nurses,  midwives,  and  volunteer  members  of  the  posyandu  who  are  largely \nfemale.  In  addition,  the  community  facilitators  will  work  with  the  community  to  engage  the  community  nutrition \nawareness  and  promote  community  level  nutrition  enhancing  activities  such  as  improving  environmental  cleanliness \nand  access  to  water  or  providing  space  for  nutrition  related  activities.  The  community  facilitators  will  work  with  key \nstakeholders, mothers, fathers, teachers, community leaders, and the community at large. \n \nGrants  will  be  provided  to  communities  to  engage  them  in  improving  the  nutritional  status  of  pregnant  and  lactating \nmothers  and  children  in  the  community.  Through  awareness  promotion  and  grants,  communities  will  be  able  to \naddress  key  nutrition  such  as  enhancing  the  services  of  the  posyandu,  school  feeding,  child-care,  or  improving \nenvironmental cleanliness and access to water.  \n\nThe table below shows that each component and related project costs will benefit women and children.  \n \nComponent \nA.

Land \nacquisition and resettlement are not expected. \n \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  free  or  low-cost  services  that  are \ncurrently not fully functioning in all project areas. It will therefore \nincrease access to quality nutritional services. It will improve the \nreferral  system  to  health  centers  and  hospitals  for  severely \nmalnourished children. \n \n \nThe  Project  will  not  provide  any  employment  but  rather \ncommunity-based  activities  for  improving  nutrition  status  such \nsmall-scale  water  and  sanitation  for  primary  schools,  peer-to-\npeer education. In the medium term, reducing the prevalence of \nmalnutrition will contribute to increased productivity. \n \nThe  Project  will  target  24  districts,  some  of  them  are  ethnically \nand  linguistically  diverse,  with  communities  that  maintain  strong \nties  to  traditional  custom.  Not  all  of  these  communities  are \nindigenous  in  the  sense  of  being  outside  the  mainstream  or  a \nminority.  The  Project  aims  to  change  nutrition  attitudes  and \nperceptions,  child  feeding  and  rearing  practices.  It  therefore \nseeks  to  positively  influence  traditional  customs  that  lead  to \nnegative nutritional outcomes.    \n\nThe  Project  seeks  to  enhance  the  participation  of  indigenous \npeople  through  its  communications  strategy  and  community \nfacilitators.  Communication  and  advocacy  materials  will  use  the \nlocal languages. Operational  research  will  ensure that materials \nare adapted to reach ethnic minorities. Community facilitators will \nbe  recruited  from  these  communities  so  they  can  identify  and \nanalyze  child  feeding  and  rearing  customs  and  beliefs,  diet  and \ncare of pregnant and lactating women.  \nThe  Project  will  not  have  any  environmental  effects.

Some  of  the  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  are  quantifiable  in \neconomic  terms  and  these  may  be  broadly  divided  into  two  categories:  productivity  gains  and \nresource cost savings.  Productivity gains are the result of the future lives lost that would have \notherwise been utilized in some economic activity.  Future productivity losses occur because of \nthe  death  of  a  potential  worker.  The  analysis  was  carried  out  in  constant  2005  prices,  with  a \ndomestic  price  numeraire.    The  economic  value  of  project  costs  was  based  on  the  estimated \nproject  costs.    Incremental  recurrent  costs  were  estimated  at  about  0.5%  of  civil  works  costs \nand 3% of component costs. Tradable capital goods were adjusted by a shadow exchange rate \nfactor of 1.11, with a proportion of tradable goods at about 35% of project costs. Based on these \nassumptions, the total economic value of project costs was estimated at about $71.8 million. \n \nA. \n \n5. \nCost-effectiveness analysis can be used to evaluate health and nutrition services. This \nanalysis  used  a  measure  of  cost-effectiveness  based  on  cost  per  death  averted.  The  total \npresent values of both costs and benefits have been calculated and discounted to the future at \n3%, which is the usual rate for investments in the social sector.  \n\nCost-Effectiveness Analysis \n\n6. \nAs shown in Table A14.2, the project cost effectiveness based on cost per death averted \nis estimated to range from $713 to $1,409 per death averted at individual project provinces and \nto be about $1.010 per death averted at all project provinces combined.  Based on these data, \nthe  activities  in  West  Nusa  Tenggara  Province  was  estimated  to  provide  for  the  most  cost \neffective intervention in term of cost per death averted with a cost of $713.  \n\nNutrition  interventions  are  program  strategies  and  actions  that  are  required  to  change \n7. \nbehaviors  in  households  and  communities.  Interventions  that  target  the  six  primary  nutrition \nbehaviors  have  been  called  the  minimum  package  of  nutrition  interventions  and  should  be \nimplemented  by  all  primary  health  care  programs.  Other  nutrition  behaviors  and  interventions, \nsuch  as  iron  supplementation  for  young  children,  improved  maternal  diets  during  pregnancy, \nzinc  supplementation,  wheat  fortification,  and  deworming,  were  reviewed  for  inclusion  in  the \nminimum  package.

Washington, DC: National Academy Press. \n\nCost\u2013Benefit Analysis \n\n \nB. \n \nThe general framework for calculating the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the \n8. \nProject  is  as  follows:  (i)  determination  of  the  appropriate  price  numeraire,  where  the  domestic \nprice  is  used  as  numeraire  as  most  benefits  and  costs  are  non-tradable;  (ii)  identification  and \nvaluation of the economic benefits of the Project in terms of productivity gains and health care \ncosts  savings  that  are  expected  to  be  realized,  as  well  as  economic  costs  to  be  invested  and \nspent  over  the  life  of  the  project  benefits;  (iii) calculation  of  net  annual  economic  benefits  and \nthe  cost\u2013benefit  ratio;  and  (iv)  calculation  of  the  EIRR  from  the  net  economic  benefit  stream.2 \nBased on the analyses, the Project is deemed economically viable. \n \n9. \nThe economic benefits of the Project have been estimated, based on productivity gains \nand  resource  cost  savings.  In  calculating  the  EIRR  for  the  Project,  the  present  values  of  both \nthe costs and the benefits have been calculated using a discount rate of 12%.  As presented in \nTable  A14.4,  the  net  benefit  cost  ratio  (BCR)  of  the  project ranges  from  2.6  to  4.2 among  the \nproject  provinces,  and  averages  about  3.0  for  the  entire  Project.    The  resulting  EIRR  for  the \nproject areas ranges from 22% to 38.8%, with an average of 26.0% for the entire Project.  The \ndata presented in the Table A14.4 provide the estimated economic value of project costs. \n \n\n                                                 \n2   Economic analysis of the project was carried out in constant 2005 prices, with domestic prices used as numeraire. \nThe  economic  value  of  the  project  benefits  and  costs  was  calculated  based  on  the  annual  project  cost \ndisbursement.  Incremental recurrent cost was estimated at about 0.8% of civil work costs and 3% of component \ncosts.  Tradable  goods  of  capital  were  adjusted  by  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.11  with  tradable  goods \nassumed at about 27% of project costs. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nIndicator \n\nBenefit \n($\u2018000) \nCost  \n($\u2018000) \nNPV \n\nBCR \n\nTable A14.4: Project Cost-Benefit Ratio and Economic Internal of Return \n\nProvince \n\nNorth \nSumatra \n\nEast \nSumatra \n\nWest   \n\nKalimantan \n\nSouth \nSulawesi \n\nEast Nusa \nTenggara \n\nTotal \n\nWest \nNusa \nTenggara \n\n14,954 \n\n15,185 \n\n9,505 \n\n8,968 \n\n21,877 \n\n9,056 \n\n79,545 \n\n5,777 \n\n9,176 \n\n2.6 \n\n5,273 \n\n9,911 \n\n2.9 \n\n3,389 \n\n6,116 \n\n2.8 \n\n3,666 \n\n5,706 \n\n3,024 \n\n26,835 \n\n5,302 \n\n16,171 \n\n6,032 \n\n52,708 \n\n2.4 \n\n3.8 \n\n3.0 \n\n29.0 \n\n2.8 \n\n26.6 \n\nEIRR \nBCR = benefit cost ratio, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value.  \nSource: ADB consultant team. \n\n24.5 \n\n26.4 \n\n27.3 \n\n22.2 \n\n39.3 \n\n10. \nThe average EIRR for the Project is 26.6%. The economic benefits that health projects \nare expected to generate will be realized only if the Project is sustainable over its lifetime. The \nkey issues regarding sustainability are the institutional and financial capacity of the government \nto ensure that staff have the skills and training to operate, maintain, and administer the Project, \nand that financial resources are available to fund future recurrent costs.  \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 26 July 2007) \n", "Currency Unit \n", "rupiah (Rp) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "Rp1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "$0.0001112 \nRp8,995 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "ADB \nBPOM \nCBO \nCNC \nCNP \nCPMU \nCRDFN \nDPIU \nIDA \nMDG \nMOH \nM&E \nNAP \nNHCS \nNSS \nPPCU \nSD \nSUSENAS \nTA \n", "BAPPEDA \n", "BAPPEDA I \n", "MPASI \n", "dinas \nposyandu \npuskesmas \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS  \n", "Asian Development Bank \nNational Agency for Food and Drugs \ncommunity-based organization \ncommunity nutrition committee \ncommunity nutrition package \ncentral project management unit \nCenter for Research and Development of Food and Nutrition \ndistrict project implementation unit \niron deficiency anemia \nMillennium Development Goal \nMinistry of Health \nmonitoring and evaluation \nNational Action Plan \nNational Health Care Survey \nnutrition surveillance system \nprovincial project coordination unit \nstandard deviation \nNational Socioeconomic Survey \ntechnical assistance \n", "GLOSSARY \n \n", "Badan Perencaanan Pembangunan Daerah Propinsi \n(Provincial Planning Office) \nBadan Perencanan Pembangunan Daerah  \n(District Planning Office) \nMakanan  Pendamping  ASI  (national  complementary  feeding \nprogram) \noffice \nintegrated services post \nhealth center at subdistrict level \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December.   \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "C.
