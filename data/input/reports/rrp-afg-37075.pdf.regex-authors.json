The \nsummary is attached as an appendix. \n   \nProject Description  The Project is to (i) reconstruct and improve the Andkhoy-Qaisar \nsection  (210  kilometers)  of  the  national  primary  ring  road,  (ii) \ninstall toll facilities including toll plazas and weighing machines for \nnewly improved primary roads in Afghanistan, and (iii) provide \nproject  management  support  to  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works \n(MPW).  \n   \nRationale  Much of Afghanistan\u2019s road infrastructure has been destroyed or \ndamaged in more than two decades of conflict. Damaged roads \nbecame  bottlenecks  to  the  movement  of  people  and  goods. \nRestricted  movement  has  aggravated  the  division  and \ndisintegration of the country, as travel time and vehicle operating \ncost on roads significantly increased. The result is a virtual loss of \nefficient means of transport connecting Kabul to regional centers, \nand regional centers to remote villages. \n \nThe Andkhoy-Qaisar road forms part of the Herat-Andkhoy road, \nwhich is the last unpaved section of the national primary ring road. \nThe project area is one of the least developed areas that the ring \nroad  touches.  Due  to  its  remoteness  and  extreme  weather  in \nwinter and summer, the project area is still in need of continued \nhumanitarian  aid  and  assistance  in  basic  social  services. \nImprovement to the road will facilitate provision of such services.  \n \nThe  Project  is  part  of  coordinated  international  assistance  to \nimprove the road connecting Herat to Andkhoy, which will become \na  major  north-south  link  across  the  central  mountains,  and \nsignificantly improve the stability and reliability of the transport \nsystem  in  Afghanistan.  The  improved  road  will  also  change \ntransport in the subregion. Together with the international links \ncurrently being improved to the Central Asian republics, Iran, and \nPakistan, the road will form a major road transport corridor from \nCentral Asia to the warm water ports in the south. This will reduce \ntransport costs, and contribute to economic growth and poverty \nreduction in the subregion.  \n   ", "iii \nObjectives  The Project\u2019s main objective is to reduce poverty and promote \neconomic and social development through continued support to \nthe Government in reestablishing the primary road network.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $80  million,  inclusive  of \ncontingencies and the interest during the 10-year grace period.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  ADB will finance 100% of the total project cost.  \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights \n53,087,000  ($80  million  equivalent)  from  the  Special  Funds \nresources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided. \nThe loan  will have a 40-year term including a grace period of 10 \nyears, and an interest rate of 1% per annum. In addition, the total \namount  of  the  interest  charge  during  the  grace  period  will  be \ncapitalized and charged to the loan account. \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2007 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  MPW  \n   \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented by a project management unit \nArrangements  established within MPW.  \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of goods, services, and civil works to be financed \nunder the Project will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement, with flexible interpretation, wherever \nessential. Civil works will be carried out in two phases: (i) use, on \na  force  account  basis,  of  MPW\u2019s  existing  construction  plant, \nequipment, and labor force for the preliminary works, such as site \nclearance, leveling, grading, and compacting of the existing road; \nand (ii) the remaining works to rehabilitate damaged embankment \nand  provide  asphalt-surfaced  pavement,  bridges,  and  other \nstructures, packaged under civil works contracts to be procured \nthrough international competitive bidding procedures.  \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting services will be required to help MPW implement the \nProject.  They  will  involve  (i)  certification  of  the  force  account \nworks, (ii) supervision of the design-build civil works contracts, (iii) \nsupervision of supply and installation of weighing machines and \ntoll equipment, and (iv) project performance monitoring.  \n \nThe consultants to be financed under the Project will be selected \nand engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements for recruitment of domestic \nconsultants  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection method will be used in selecting consultants. \n   ", "iv \nProject Benefits and  The Project will dramatically decrease the vehicle operating costs \nBeneficiaries  and passenger time on the project road. The primary beneficiaries \nwill be the approximately 800,000 residents of the project area, \nwho are mostly engaged in agriculture; 50% live below the poverty \nline. They will benefit from improved access to health, education, \nand  other  social  services;  and  increased  prices  of  agricultural \nproducts.  \n \nThe Project, with other funding agencies\u2019 support to improve road \nsections  adjacent  to  the  project  road,  will  improve  access  of \nresidents in the project area to the two major regional centers, \nHerat and Mazar-e-Sharif, where higher levels of social services \nand a wider range of economic opportunities are available. The \neconomic internal rate of return is estimated to be 19.1%. The \npoverty impact ratio is estimated to be 0.69. \n \nIncreased  trade  and  transit  through  the  improved  transport \ncorridor  from  Central  Asia  through  Afghanistan  to  Iran  and \nPakistan, which includes the project road, will benefit a broad \nrange of the population, including consumers, manufacturers, and \ntransport operators who will directly or indirectly use goods and \nservices  transported  on  the  project  road.  Increased  trade  and \ntransit will improve the central Government\u2019s financial position by \nincreasing  customs  revenue,  which  accounts  for  40%  of  the \nnational domestic revenue. \n \nThe Project will also contribute to increased social stability as the \nimproved road will provide the project area with a vital physical \nconnectivity to the rest of the country, and extend the reach of the \ncentral government to the project area.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The risks to the Project are related to (i) the overall political and \nsecurity  situation  and  possible  interference  by  the  regional \nwarlords/militia leaders, (ii) trafficking of opium along the improved \nroads, (iii) the Government\u2019s weak implementation capacity, and \n(iv) timely provision of counterpart resources. \n \nThe risks will be mitigated through (i) continued close monitoring \nand  coordination  with  local  and  central  authorities  and  United \nNations agencies to ensure adequate protection, (ii) improvement \nof border procedures to contain movement of opium, (iii) allocation \nof resources under the Project for consulting services to help with \nproject management and implementation, and continued technical \nassistance  to  MPW  through  the  ongoing  technical  assistance \ncluster, and (iv) use of the existing MPW project management \narrangement  for  the  ongoing  Emergency  Infrastructure \nRehabilitation and Reconstruction Project.  \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  for  the  Andkhoy-Qaisar  Road  Project.  The  project \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Afghanistan is a landlocked country. With a large area (about 652,000 square kilometers \n[km2]) and an estimated population of 22.8 million widely spread across the largely mountainous \nterrain, roads are the principal means of transport.1 Its road network comprises about 6,100 km \nof national roads and 15,000 km of provincial roads. Of the national roads, 3,300 km are \nnational primary roads including 2,400 km that were originally paved. The national primary road \nnetwork consists largely of the 2,300 km ring road that connects Afghanistan\u2019s major regional \ncenters (Herat, Kandahar, Mazar-e-Sharif, Maimana, and Sheberghan) with Kabul, and the \nroads linking to neighboring countries.2 The remaining 2,800 km of national roads are secondary \nroads with gravel or earthen surface. The 15,000 km of provincial roads are gravel or earthen \nand comprise 5,400 km of provincial primary roads and 9,600 km of provincial secondary roads. \nA tertiary road network consists of rural roads3 and substantial lengths of urban roads.4  \n \n3.  Much of Afghanistan\u2019s road infrastructure was destroyed or damaged during the more \nthan two decades of conflict. Lack of resources and capacity prevented maintenance, and has \nled to major deterioration and loss of infrastructure. The effects of military actions are more \npronounced\u2014damaged bridges and tunnels have become bottlenecks to the movement of \npeople and goods. Restricted movement has aggravated the division and disintegration of the \ncountry, as travel time and vehicle operating cost on roads significantly increased.5 \n \n4.  A comprehensive needs assessment of the Afghanistan transport sector, during March-\nMay 2002 by major external funding agencies including the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nrevealed that 54% of national roads are in poor condition, 26% in fair condition, and only 20% in \ngood condition. It urged the entire primary road network be rehabilitated on a priority basis.6 \n  \n5.  Afghanistan\u2019s road network is characterized by very low road density. The road density \nof 0.03 km per km2 is far lower than that of the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, which also have \nlargely  mountainous  terrain  and  similar  population  density,  and  even  lower  than  that  of \nBalochistan in Pakistan, where population density is about half that of Afghanistan.7 Even \nwithout  the  damage  inflicted  during  the  conflict  period,  Afghanistan\u2019s  road  network  needs \nsubstantial improvement to provide basic connectivity available elsewhere in the subregion.  \n                                                 \n1  With only short lengths near the border with Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, railways play a marginal role in \nAfghanistan\u2019s transport sector. \n2  The international links are to Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.  \n3  Roughly estimated to be 15,000\u201320,000 km. \n4  Roughly estimated to be 3,000 km, including 1,060 km in Kabul. \n5  Before the conflict, travel from Kabul to Kandahar (1,066 km) took less than 12 hours. Soon after the conflict, it \ntook about 30 hours with a four-wheel drive vehicle. \n6  A preliminary needs assessment conducted in December 2001 by ADB, United Nations Development Programme, \nand World Bank was presented at the ministerial meeting in Tokyo in January 2002, where external funding \nagencies pledged about $4.5 billion assistance. \n7  Road densities are 0.18 km/km2 in Tajikistan, 0.17 km/km2 in Kyrgyz Republic, and 0.07 km/km2 in Balochistan \nProvince of Pakistan.  ", "2  \n6.  The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) has been responsible for development, operation, \nand maintenance of the primary and secondary road network in the country. Its mandate also \ncovers collection of road tolls.8 It had an institutional setup of a large engineering organization9 \nwith  staff  stationed  in  every  major  provincial  capital  and  carrying  out  work  through  force \naccount. Over the course of the conflict, MPW lost a majority of its trained staff. The current staff \nof 2,900 require substantial skills enhancement to perform their duties. \n \n7.  Appendix 2 presents an analysis of the road subsector in Afghanistan. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Overview of Reconstruction and Economic Situation \n8.  The result of the more than two decades of conflict and civil strife is utter devastation of \nthe economy and infrastructure, coupled with ravaged social, political, and ethnic fabric. The \nreconstruction of Afghanistan was a daunting task for the transitional Government installed in \n2002. The Government has made significant progress on many fronts. The adoption of a new \nconstitution in January 2004 designating Afghanistan as an Islamic republic and including a \nstrong centralized presidency, a bicameral legislature, and gender equality in principle; the \napproval of an electoral law in May 2004; the presidential elections under universal suffrage in \nOctober 2004; and the prospect of parliamentary elections in April 2005 constitute a strong \nframework for recovery and development. The Government has demonstrated its commitment \nto political, economic, and social reform, and to developing a free and competitive economic \nsystem and private sector-driven growth. It has shown strong ownership of the reconstruction \neffort, working closely with development agencies to rebuild critical physical infrastructure and to \nreorient Soviet-style public sector institutions to promote market-led development.  \n \n9.  The private sector responded favorably to the Government\u2019s efforts. The International \nMonetary Fund estimates that real gross domestic product, excluding opium production, grew \nby about 30% in 2002/03 and 23% in 2003/04. The growth resulted from recovered agricultural \nproduction  after  years  of  drought,  an  urban  construction  boom,  and  increased  service \nestablishments driven by the international community\u2019s spending and emergency assistance \nefforts. Continued strong growth in agriculture, services, and construction is expected in 2004. \n \n2.  Government Strategy and External Assistance \n10.  The transitional Government declared that reconstruction and rehabilitation of the road \nsystem, especially of national primary roads, is the country\u2019s top priority in reconstruction. Since \n2002, with external assistance, the Government has been making massive efforts to reestablish \nthe road network, in order to facilitate provision of basic social services to remote provinces, to \nprovide security, and to involve all the population in undertaking nation-building activities.  \n \n11.  The national primary roads are being rehabilitated with financial and technical assistance \n(TA) from bilateral and multilateral funding agencies. ADB is financing rehabilitation of the road \nfrom Pul-e Khumri via Mazar-e Sharif to Andkhoy under the $150 million loan for the Emergency  \n                                                 \n8  Toll collection has been suspended since September 2002 to prevent abuse of the toll collection system.   \n9  Before 1992, a single department within MPW, the Road Construction and Development Department, had a staff of \nmore than 5,000. ", "    3\nInfrastructure Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project (EIRRP).10 The road linking the ring \nroad to Uzbekistan (Naibabad-Hairatan road) is also under the EIRRP. The Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction-financed road rehabilitation from Kandahar to Spin Boldak11 (103.5 km) has \nbeen substantially completed. By early 2005, rehabilitation of 670 km12 of the national roads is \nexpected to be completed. This would double the length of national roads that are in good \ncondition. A list of TA and externally-financed national primary road projects is in Appendix 3. \n \n12.  Although the primary road network touches most of the major population centers, a \nsingle road often connects one population center to another and to the nearest regional center, \nand a regional center to Kabul. Failure of a single road link will have severe impacts not only on \nthe population that it directly serves but also on the population in other parts of the country. A \npronounced  example  is  the  Salang  tunnel\u2014the  only  reliable  transport  connection  between \nKabul and the northern provinces. Closure of the Salang tunnel virtually cuts the connection \nbetween the north and the south of the country. This vulnerability and lack of redundancy in the \ntransport system often exacerbated the division of the country during the conflict period. To \nbecome an effective state with central Government authority across the country, connectivity \nmust be improved to places and people and thereby integrate all parts of the country. Improving \nthe road network, and in particular strengthening the primary road network, will continue to be \nthe Government\u2019s top priority. Given the country\u2019s resource constraints, continued assistance by \nthe international community will be needed to establish a reliable and robust transport system. \n \n13.  The Government\u2019s weak capability to mobilize its own financial resources has been a \nmajor constraint for reconstruction of Afghanistan. For the fiscal year 2003/04, the central \nGovernment relied on customs duties for 40% of its domestic revenue. This share could have \nbeen much higher if the central Government had full access to the duties and charges being \ncollected at border provinces. Provincial governments still exert influence over  border and \ncustoms  procedures.  Inadequate  infrastructure  and  outdated  cumbersome  procedures  are \ncausing enormous delays in moving things across the border. Lack of proper control and \noversight has resulted in corruption, smuggling, and other illegal activities. To counter these \nproblems and broaden the revenue base, the Government prepared a 5-year plan to reform and \nmodernize customs, and is vigorously implementing the plan with assistance from the World \nBank and other funding agencies. The Government expects customs revenue, and hence its \nfinancial  position  to  improve  as  primary  roads  forming  part  of  major  subregional  transport \ncorridors  are  upgraded.  Thus  improvement  of  primary  roads  is  a  strategic  focus  of  the \nGovernment.  \n \n14.  During the 2004 Country Programming Mission, the Government reconfirmed its request \nfor assistance to quickly improve the Herat-Andkhoy road, which is the last unpaved section of \nthe national primary ring road. ADB provided TA for a feasibility study for the improvement.13 In \nthe course of the study, the $80 million programmed in 2004 for the Herat-Andkhoy road was \nidentified as covering at best only the cost to improve about one third of the entire length. During \nthe Fact-Finding Mission in May 2004, the Government asked ADB to reallocate the $55 million \nloan in 2005, which had originally been programmed for other national roads, to cover part of \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2003.

This was incorporated in the country strategy and program update \nfor 2004-2006.14 In addition to ADB funds, the Government has secured financial assistance \nfrom Iran and Saudi Arabia, which will be used to cover the cost of the improvement on a \nparallel basis. Iran will finance the improvement of the first 60 km section from Herat. Saudi \nArabia has committed $100 million for improving the rest of the road. The Government is \nseeking additional external assistance to narrow the financing gap.       \n  \n3.  Capacity Building and Sector Reform \n15.  To counter the lack of capacity in line ministries to plan and prepare projects, the \nGovernment  established  a  dedicated  agency,  the  Afghanistan  Assistance  Coordination \nAuthority,  to  handle  planning,  coordination,  preparation,  and  procurement  of  major \nreconstruction projects. The authority was later reorganized into the Afghanistan Reconstruction \nand Development Services (ARDS). ARDS\u2019s Procurement Unit handles procurement for most \nexternally financed projects. For project implementation, the comprehensive needs assessment \nrecommended provision of assistance to MPW through a team of international and capable \ndomestic experts to compensate for the lack of capacity to implement large-scale projects. \nUnder the ongoing TA cluster for Capacity Building for Reconstruction and Development,15 ADB \nis providing assistance to MPW for project planning and management. Under the EIRRP, the \nproject implementation unit established within MPW is coordinating with ARDS and gradually \nbuilding capacity to handle day-to-day project implementation. Several MPW staff have been \nattached to the contractor and the supervision consultants under the EIRRP to receive on-the-\njob training in project administration and implementation.  \n \n16.  Policy and institutional reforms in the transport sector have been addressed by the \nPostconflict Multisector Program loan.16 The policy objectives included (i) creating an enabling \nframework  for  market-based  competition  and  efficiency,  (ii)  establishing  safe  and  reliable \ntransport services, (iii) improving institutional efficiency, (iv) establishing a regulatory framework, \n(v) improving transparency and accountability, (vi) instituting a mechanism for cost recovery, \n(vii) encouraging private sector participation, and (viii) establishing a system for national road \nimprovement and maintenance.  \n \n17.  The Transport Sector Review17 studied these aspects and recommended major policy \nand institutional reforms. The Policy Statement for the Transport Sector, prepared as part of the \nreview exercise, sets out the guiding principles of the recommended reforms and provides the \nframework  for  reform  implementation  (Appendix  4).18  Implementation  of  the  review\u2019s  key \nrecommendations is under way. The restructuring and capacity building of MPW is in progress, \nin  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  priority  reforms  and  restructuring.19  MPW\u2019s  restructuring  will \n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2004.

The intent of the \nscheme is to promote the reform and restructuring of ministries and Government agencies. Ministries and ", "    5\nchange the ministry into a lean organization that focuses on road network planning and design, \nroad asset management, and regulatory/supervisory functions. Construction work will be mostly \ncontracted out to the private sector and MPW will supervise the work of contractors. For road \nmaintenance,  MPW  may  have  its  own  construction  units  for  routine  maintenance  and \nemergency repair, but periodic maintenance will be contracted out. For recovering the road \nmaintenance  cost,  the  Government  is  currently  considering  reinstating  toll  collection  on \nimproved road sections. With ADB support, the Government has conducted a preliminary study \non toll rates and is preparing a tolling scheme for the Kabul-Kandahar-Spin Boldak road. ADB \nwill continuously support these reform initiatives in the road subsector through the ongoing TA \ncluster and TA programmed in the assistance pipeline.20  \n \n4.  Subregional Cooperation for Transport Corridor Development \n18.  The efforts by Afghanistan to rehabilitate and reconstruct its shattered road network \nhave  drawn  much  attention  of  the  neighboring  countries.  An  improved  road  network  in \nAfghanistan will result in an improved transport network in the subregion. Landlocked Central \nAsian  republics  have  shown  a  great  interest  in  establishing  transport  corridors  through \nAfghanistan to warm-water ports on the Arabian Sea and the Gulf. Iran and Pakistan are rapidly \ndeveloping their ports and improving roads connecting to the ports in expectation of increased \nimport/export and transit shipment of goods through their ports.  \n \n19.  ADB  has  been  actively  involved  in  this  subregional  initiative  to  develop  effective \ntransport corridors. Under the TA cluster, ADB provided assistance to develop a framework and \nlegislation to facilitate cross-border trade. This has evolved into the initiative to establish the \nCentral and South Asia Transport and Trade Forum.21 Under this initiative, meetings have been \nheld to discuss customs harmonization; coordinated border infrastructure development; and law \nenforcement on drug and human trafficking, and money laundering.22   \n \n20.  On  the  infrastructure  side,  ADB  has  been  financing  two  key  international  links  in \nAfghanistan: the road from Kandahar to Spin Boldak on the border of Pakistan, and the road \nfrom  Naibabad  to  Hairatan  on  the  Uzbekistan  border.  In  Pakistan,  ADB  is  financing  the \nBalochistan Road Development Sector Project to rehabilitate and widen the Kalat-Quetta (130 \nkm) and Quetta to Chamman (117 km) sections of N25 linking Karachi through Chamman to \nAfghanistan, and improve the cross-border facility and procedures at Chamman. In Pakistan, \nADB will also finance improvement to the road network in the North-West Frontier Province, \nincluding the Peshawar-Torkham (46 km) and N55-Ghulam Khan (118 km) sections, and the \ncross-border facilities at Torkham and Ghulam Khan.

Security Situation \n21.  Although the recent developments in reconstruction, notably the successful presidential \nelection, are encouraging, the country still faces several problems that could undermine the \nprogress and hamper development. In a recent report of the United Nations (UN) secretary \ngeneral to the UN Security Council, extremist violence, factionalism, and the narcotics industry \nare highlighted as threats to the consolidation of peace and stability in Afghanistan.23 On these \nfronts, the Government has made significant achievements in the past 2 years. They include \ninauguration of the Afghan National Army and national police force; commencement of major \nreform in the Ministry of Defense; initial implementation of a disarmament, demobilization, and \nreintegration program; formulation of a national drug control strategy; and steady progress in \nremoving land mines. The internationally sponsored security arrangements for Kabul, based on \nthe International Security Assistance Forces in cooperation with Afghan security forces, have \nworked  reasonably  well.  Security  on  the  main  intercity  roads  has  improved  significantly \ncompared with the situation 2 years ago.  \n \n22.  However, the security situation outside Kabul still largely depends on a delicate power \nbalance between local warlords and the central Government in Kabul. In the country\u2019s southern, \nsoutheastern,  and  eastern  provinces,  activity  of  international  development  agencies  and \nnongovernment  organizations  has  been  disrupted  by  the  revival  of  Taliban  elements.  The \nGovernment has been making every effort to curtail the influence of the warlords and factional \nleaders  in  the  reconstruction  activity.  The  disarmament,  demobilization,  and  reintegration \nprogram is the key instrument to reduce the number and size of private militias and undercut the \nmilitary strength of the regional governors. Progress has been slow. By the end of July 2004, \nonly a little over 12% of the militia forces are estimated to have turned in their weapons. In the \npolitical arena, the Government has made some gain in decreasing the influence of warlords \nand factional leaders by both inclusive and confrontational measures. The central Government \nbanned local warlords from assuming political and military posts in a provincial government, and \noffered them posts in the central Government. Some warlords accepted the offer. Vacated posts \nin the provincial governments were filled with officials from Kabul. Still in many parts of the \ncountry, quasi-autonomy continues to exist under the rule of local leaders with different scales. \nThey  collect  taxes  and  customs  duties  in  the  case  of  border  provinces  and  support  their \noperations. This significantly reduces the central Government\u2019s ability to collect revenues to \nprovide for basic central government functions. This situation enables regional warlords to \nmaintain their military strength and keep their influence over regional politics far off from the \ncentral Government. This leads to fragile security over the country. The security situation will \ncontinue to constrain the progress of reconstruction, and security concerns may continue to \ndiscourage foreign and large-scale domestic investment.  \n \n23.  This  fragile  security  situation,  exacerbated  by  the  influence  of  local  warlords  and \nfactional leaders, will adversely affect the implementation of ADB-financed projects because (i) \nthe security hazard around project locations may disrupt and delay construction work; (ii) the \nsupply of raw materials, which will have to be transported through areas under the influence of \nregional  warlords,  may  be  hampered;  and  (iii)  the  supervision  of  construction  work  by \n                                                 \n23  United Nations Security Council. 2004.

Implementation of the Japan Fund For Poverty \nReduction-financed  project  to  rehabilitate  the  Kandahar-Spin  Boldak  road\u2014the  first  ADB \nintervention  in  the  road  subsector\u2014has  been  seriously  hampered  by  the  interference  of \nfactional leaders and the deteriorating security situation. Mobilization of machinery and plants \nexperienced inordinate delays due to longer time required for transportation across warlord-\ncontrolled provinces. Repeated threats to the construction workers and security incidents in and \naround Kandahar demoralized the employees of the contractor and consultants. To overcome \nthese  problems,  efforts  have  been  made  to  win  the  support  of  communities  near  the \nconstruction site through grassroots outreach. The collaboration of local government officials \nand village leaders was also sought. ADB is devising security arrangements under TA24 to help \nprovide  a  safe  work  environment  for  on-site  personnel  assigned  by  the  contractors  and \nconsulting firms through close cooperation with provincial authorities. \n \n6.  Opium-Related Problems \n24.  Afghanistan is the world\u2019s largest producer of illicit opium. The current ban on cultivation \nhas had an extremely limited effect. Opium is a major source of cash income for farmers \nbecause of its ready profitability, and their lack of other livelihood alternatives. According to the \nUN Office on Drugs and Crime, opium was cultivated on 80,000 hectares in 2003, an increase \nof 8% over 2002, and production increased by 6% to 3,600 tons, 20 times more than in 2001, \nthe last year of Taliban rule. Farmers grew poppies in 28 of the country\u2019s 32 provinces in 2003, \nup from 18 in 1999. About 264,000 families, or about 7% of Afghanistan\u2019s population, are \nestimated to be producing poppies, each cultivating an average of 0.3 hectares. The UN Office \non Drugs and Crime estimates average yearly earnings at $3,900 per opium-growing family, or \n$594 per capita, in a country where per capita gross domestic product is only $207.25 The share \nof  poppy  production  in  the  economy  is  large.  If  opium  exports  were  included,  total  gross \ndomestic product would be 40% greater.  \n \n25.  Poppy  cultivation,  and  narcotics  production  and  trade  constitute  a  major  threat  to \nAfghanistan\u2019s security and political normalization, and tie the poor rural population to regional \nwarlords and international crime syndicates. To combat this problem, the Government has \ndeveloped a national counternarcotics strategy, and is working with aid agencies involved in the \nsecurity sector to contain and eradicate poppy cultivation and provide support for alternative \nlivelihoods. ADB support focuses on helping farm households develop livelihood alternatives to \npoppy cultivation. ADB activities include creating an enabling environment for commercializing \nand diversifying agricultural production, and rehabilitating irrigation systems. ADB is using a \ndemand-driven,  participatory,  and  community-based  approach.  ADB,  through  some  of  its \nsubregional activities, is supporting measures to contain the flow of narcotics across borders. \nThese include building capacity and strengthening customs and immigration departments in the \nregion. Under the Central And South Asia Transport And Trade Forum, Afghanistan and its \nneighboring countries are discussing ways to contain drug trafficking across borders. \n \n7.  Lessons Learned \n26.  A number of lessons can be drawn from past emergency assistance projects, best \npractices, and initial lending and nonlending operations of ADB in Afghanistan since 2002. First, \ncontinued emphasis has to be given to capacity building to improve planning, project design and \n                                                 \n24  ADB. 2004.

Vienna. ", "8  \nimplementation, administration, and financial management. Second, aid coordination by means \nof consultative groups26 is important to avoid duplication and delays. Third, aid groups must \nwork closely with a country\u2019s ministry of finance and central bank to develop a viable and \nworking payment system, without which maintaining a flow of funds is difficult. Fourth, capacity \nbuilding  in  executing  agencies  is  vital,  and  consulting  services  for  project  design  and \nimplementation  should  provide  for  the  training  of  executing  agency  staff  in  operation  and \nmaintenance of rehabilitated facilities. Fifth, the number of procurement packages should be \nminimized,  given  the  limited  implementation  capacity  of  executing  agencies.  Sixth,  ADB\u2019s \nprocurement guidelines should be applied flexibly for emergency assistance projects to allow \nreduced procurement periods for the urgent delivery of project components. Seventh, extensive \nsecurity plans should be in place to address possible security hazards in project locations that \ncould hamper smooth project implementation. All these lessons are incorporated in the design \nof the Project. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n27.  The main objective of the Project is to reduce poverty and promote economic and social \ndevelopment through continued support to the Government to (i) reestablish the primary road \nnetwork damaged during two decades of conflict and neglect, and (ii) help implement cost-\nrecovery measures. The Project is in line with ADB\u2019s assistance strategy outlined in the country \nstrategy and program update (footnote 14), which includes focusing on rehabilitation of key \ninfrastructure.  While  the  Project  involves  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  an  important \nsection of the primary road network, the related policy and institutional reforms in the transport \nsector have been addressed by the Postconflict Multisector Program (footnote 16) and the \nTransport Sector Review. The cost-recovery measures for road maintenance will be studied \nunder a separate TA to prepare a road subsector master plan.27 The Project will finance the \npurchase and installation of the facilities required for road tolling. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n1.  Improvement to Key Primary Road Section \n28.  The Project will finance rehabilitation and reconstruction of the Andkhoy-Qaisar road \n(210 km). The Project will improve the project road to an asphalt-paved standard that will allow \nsmooth passage of heavy vehicles. The current condition of the project road and proposed \ndesign standards are in Appendix 5. \n \n2.  Provision of Road Tolling Facility  \n29.  The Project will also finance installation of road tolling facilities including toll plazas, \ncomputers and communications equipment, and weighing machines for the project road and \nother primary roads being improved with external financial assistance. The installation will be in \nthree phases: (i) the first phase will be the Kabul-Kandahar-Spin Boldak corridor; (ii) the second \nphase will cover the northern roads currently being rehabilitated under the EIRRP, and (iii) the \n                                                 \n26 ADB is a co-focal point of the Afghanistan\u2019s Transport Consultative Group, which has been a forum for  \ncoordination and information sharing among funding agencies, and providing support to the Government including \npreparation of development budgets. \n27 ADB. 2004.

The  Government  is  now  preparing  road  tolling \nimplementation plans for the first phase installation. These will be finalized by the end of the \ncurrent fiscal year. For the remaining roads to be tolled, tolling strategy and implementation \nplans will be developed under the road subsector master plan TA.      \n \nC.  Special Features \n30.  In view of the exceptionally difficult postconflict circumstances that continue to prevail in \nAfghanistan, the Government has requested the softer Asian Development Fund (ADF) terms \nprovided under the previous four loans from ADB to Afghanistan. The request is supported by \nrecent analysis on Afghanistan\u2019s debt sustainability by ADB and the International Monetary \nFund, which concludes that funding for development projects in Afghanistan should be on a \ngrant basis, or under highly concessional terms for key projects and reforms for which no grant \nfunding can be mobilized. Afghanistan is eligible for grant funding under the recently concluded \nADF IX replenishment. This will result in softer lending terms for Afghanistan. Until ADF IX \nbecomes effective in 2005, special lending terms are proposed as follows: (i) grandfathering the \npre-1999 ADF lending terms so that the loan has 40-year maturity including a 10-year grace \nperiod, with 1% interest charge throughout its term, and (ii) capitalizing and charging the total \namount of the interest charge during the grace period to the loan account. These special lending \nterms were applied for other projects approved for Afghanistan since ADB lending operations \nresumed in late 2002. Further, the waiver of cost-sharing limit that has been approved for loans \nand TA operations for Afghanistan28 is applied to the Project.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n31.  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $80  million  equivalent,  inclusive  of \ncontingencies  and  interest  during  the  10-year  grace  period.  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is \nestimated at $60.7 million, representing about 76% of the total cost. The local currency cost is \nestimated at $19.3 million equivalent, or about 24% of the total cost. Detailed cost estimates are \nin Appendix 6. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n32.  The Government has requested a loan of $80 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources denominated in special drawing rights to help finance the Project. The ADB \nloan will finance 100% of the total project cost. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n33.  MPW will be the Executing Agency. The Project will be implemented by the existing \nProject  Management  Unit  (PMU),  which  handles  the  ongoing  Kandahar-Spin  Boldak  Road \nProject and the EIRRP road component (Appendix 7). The PMU will (i) monitor the progress of \nday-to-day  project  implementation,  (ii)  prepare  withdrawal  applications,  (iii)  prepare  project \nprogress reports, and (iv) maintain project accounts and complete loan financial records for \nauditing. The deputy minister of MPW will have overall responsibility for project management as \nproject director of the PMU. The Project will augment the capacity of the PMU by funding a \n                                                 \n28 ADB. 2002.

Manila.  \n ", "10  \nproject  accountant,  two  engineers,  and  other  administrative  staff,  acceptable  to  ADB,  with \nexpertise and experience in respective fields of project implementation. The engineers will be \nstationed in the field to handle day-to-day project implementation. The PMU will be assisted by \nconsultants engaged under the TA cluster (footnote 15). The project management and TA \ncoordination specialist will continue to assist the PMU with overall project management. The \nfinancial management and auditing specialist will assist the PMU with financial management.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n34.  The Project is of an emergency nature and will be implemented over 36 months starting \nfrom the date of loan effectiveness. By employing design-build contract modality, the lead-time \nrequired for project preparation has been reduced. The consulting services contract is expected \nto be awarded at the beginning of the first quarter of 2005, and the civil works by the end of the \nfirst quarter of 2005. Civil works will be completed in the third quarter of 2007 (Appendix 8).  \n \n3.  Procurement \n35.  Procurement of goods, services, and civil works to be financed under the ADB loan will \nbe carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Due to the emergency \nnature  of  project  implementation,  the  Government  requested  flexible  application  of  such \nguidelines.  This  includes  shorter  bidding  period  for  international  procurement.  Civil  works \ncontracts will be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB). A single-stage two-\nenvelope  procedure  with  no  separate  prequalification,  which  has  been  used  in  the  two \npreceding ADB-financed road projects in Afghanistan and has proven to be effective in reducing \ntime required for procurement, will be used. Equipment will be procured by ICB for contracts \nwith an estimated value of more than $500,000, international shopping for contracts estimated \nat  $100,000\u2013500,000,  and  direct  purchase  arrangement  for  contracts  valued  at  less  than \n$100,000. Indicative contract packages are in Appendix 9. All international procurements will be \nundertaken by the Government Procurement Unit operating under ARDS.  \n \n36.  Taking account of the urgent need expressed by the Government to commence the road \nimprovement works, a two-pronged approach will be used: (i) use on a force account basis, of \nMPW\u2019s existing construction plant, equipment, and labor force for the preliminary works, such \nas site clearing, leveling, grading, and compacting of the existing road; and (ii) packaging the \nremaining works to rehabilitate damaged embankment and provide asphalt-surfaced pavement \nunder civil works contracts, to be undertaken by international contractors selected through ICB \nprocedures.  \n \n37.  The project area is located in the western part of the country, where ADB nonmember \ncountries,  particularly  those  in  the  Gulf  region,  provide  competitive  sources  of  materials, \nespecially bitumen required for road pavement. Explicit procurement restrictions may preclude \ncivil works contractors under the Project from seeking the best business terms, and ultimately \nerode  economic  efficiency.  To  maximize  the  Project\u2019s  development  impact  and  economic \nefficiency, it is proposed that civil works contractors under the Project be allowed to procure the \nbitumen required for road pavement from all countries, including from countries that are not \nADB members.29 \n \n                                                 \n29  This is pursuant to Article 14(ix) of the ADB Charter, which provides that the Board may, by a vote of the directors \nrepresenting not less than two thirds of the total voting power of the members, agree to permit in special \ncircumstances procurement from non-ADB member countries ", "    11\n4.  Consulting Services \n38.  Consulting services will be required to help MPW implement the Project. The consulting \nservices will involve (i) certification of the force account works, (ii) supervision of the design-\nbuild civil works contracts, (iii) supervision of supply and installation of tolling equipment, and \n(iv)  project  performance  monitoring.  An  international  firm  in  association  with  domestic \nconsultants will provide the consulting services and on-the-job training to counterpart staff. \n \n39.  All consultants financed from the ADB loan will be selected and engaged in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements for recruitment of \ndomestic consultants acceptable to ADB. The consulting firm for construction supervision and \nmonitoring  will  be  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures  for \nrecruiting firms under full technical proposals. The consulting services will require about 100 \nperson-months of international consulting and about 500 person-months of domestic consulting. \nThe outline terms of reference for consulting services are provided in Appendix 10. \n \n5.  Advance Action \n40.  In view of the high priority accorded to the Project by the Government, and to minimize \nimplementation delays and ensure timely completion of the Project, the Government requested \nADB  approval  for  advance  procurement  action  for  civil  works  packages  and  advance \nrecruitment action for consultants. ADB approved advance action for commencing recruitment \nof consultants and procurement of ICB civil works contracts. The Government was informed that \nthe approval of advance actions does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n   \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n41.  Loan funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \nAn  imprest  account,  primarily  for  incremental  expenditures  related  to  project  management \nsupport for MPW, will be established under the Ministry of Finance at the Da Afghanistan Bank \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The initial amount to be deposited to \nthe imprest account will be the lesser of the estimated 6-month expenditure or 10% of the loan \namount. Statement of expenditure procedures will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures \nand liquidate the imprest advance for any individual payment not exceeding $50,000 equivalent. \n  \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n42.  The overall institutional setup and procedure for accounting, auditing, and reporting will \nfollow what is currently being established for the ongoing EIRRP. MPW will maintain separate \naccounts and records for the Project in accordance with sound accounting principles, adequate \nto  identify  the  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  financing  resources, \nexpenditures incurred for the Project, and the use of local funds. These project accounts and \nrelated  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing \nstandards by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited reports and related financial \nstatements will be submitted to ADB no later than 9 months after the end of the fiscal year. The \nannual audits will include an audit of the imprest account and statement of expenditure records, \nand a separate opinion on the audit. The unaudited project accounts and related financial \nstatements will be submitted to ADB no later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year. The \nGovernment will facilitate ADB representatives\u2019 conduct of spot and random checks on the flow \nof funds and their use for the Project and work in progress.  \n ", "12  \n43.  MPW  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  for  performance  monitoring,  issues \nresolution, and periodic action plans. The quarterly reports will serve as feedback to update and \nimprove procedures and project implementation. Within 3 months of physical completion of the \nProject, MPW will submit a project completion report on the overall impact of the Project. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n44.  MPW will undertake quantitative and qualitative performance monitoring to evaluate the \ndelivery of the planned facilities and the project benefits accrued. Within 6 months of the \neffective date of the Loan Agreement, MPW, with the assistance of loan-financed consultants, \nwill develop a comprehensive project performance monitoring system in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProject Performance Management System Handbook. ADB will review and approve the system. \nWithin 3 months of the effective date of the Loan Agreement, ADB and the Government will \nagree on the performance parameters to be monitored during implementation of the Project.  \n   \n9.  Project Review \n45.  ADB staff will review project implementation through regular or special review missions. \nBased on the project schedule, a midterm review will be carried out about 18 months after \nproject  commencement,  around  September  2006.  The  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  a \ndetailed progress report on the Project\u2019s implementation and achievements prior to the midterm \nreview. Terms of reference for the midterm review will be included in the project administration \nmemorandum to be prepared by ADB\u2019s Inception Mission for the Project.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n46.  The Andkhoy-Qaisar road is one of the last unpaved sections of the national primary \nroad network. The Project will dramatically decrease the vehicle operating costs and passenger \ntime on the project road. The primary beneficiaries will be the residents in the project area, \nestimated at about 800,000 and mostly engaged in agriculture; 50% live under the poverty line. \nThe residents will benefit from improved access to health, education, and other social services. \nBenefits will also arise from the increased prices of agricultural products, for which the project \narea is endowed with a significant resource base. The project road will form part of the second \npaved road corridor linking the north and south of the country across the central mountains, will \nadd to the country\u2019s road network, and significantly improve the reliability of road transport. \nIncreased trade and transit through the improved transport corridor from Central Asia through \nAfghanistan to Iran and Pakistan, including the project road, will benefit a broad range of \npopulation including consumers, manufacturers, and transport operators who will directly or \nindirectly use goods and services transported on the project road \n \nA.  Social Impacts \n47.  The prolonged war in the country exacerbated by drought has severely affected the \nlivelihoods of the local population. About 53% of the population are classified as poor and live \non  less  than  $1  a  day  (footnote  14).  Decline  in  farm  productivity  and  loss  of  seasonal \nopportunities for agriculture labor are the main determinants of poverty. An estimate of poverty \nincidence through proxy measures in the project influence area indicates that about 35\u201350% \nhouseholds are poor, and among the poor households 50\u201380% live in absolute poverty. The \naverage monthly income of the poor households was as low as AF3,700. Most villages in the \nproject influence area lack primary health care facilities or are located at least 10 km away from \nthe nearest basic health care clinic. Due to the absence of primary health care facilities coupled ", "    13\nwith poor condition of roads and lack of transportation facilities, the mortality rate was observed \nto be high among women and children from simple complications of childbirth, lack of proper \nimmunization, and preventable childhood illnesses.  \n \n48.  The direct poverty impact would be from income generation and demand for unskilled \nlabor  resulting  directly  from  road  construction.  The  improved  road  will  significantly  reduce \ntransport cost and travel time. This will translate into improved access to schools, medical \nclinics, and employment centers. The improved road will decrease the chances of accident \ndeaths and disabilities that have resulted from extremely poor road conditions. The poverty \nimpact ratio (0.69) indicates that the poor will receive a high proportion of these benefits. The \nindirect, but important impact will be the growth of local trade and production activities, and \nreduced  prices  of  commodities  facilitated  by  improved  access  to  local,  national,  and \ninternational markets. The road improvement is also expected to mainstream local economies \nwith the overall national economy, and facilitate exploitation of available natural resources, such \nas minerals, gas, and other resources. These benefits are expected to significantly increase \nhousehold incomes and quality of life, and reduce the overall poverty incidence. The economic \nassessment and distributional analysis are provided in Supplementary Appendix A. \n  \n49.  Incidence of poverty among women is higher than among men and is characterized by \nlow  endowment  of  land  and  productive  assets,  unemployment,  discrimination  in  the  labor \nmarket, and limited access to economic options and political processes. Women in Afghanistan \nare generally denied inheritance rights, adequate food and nutrition, choice of education, and \nparticipation in the decision-making process of household economic activities. In the project \narea, the level of attainment in elementary education ranges between 12\u201336% for women and is \nmuch  lower  than  that  for  men,  which  ranges  between  62\u201377%.  However,  with  the  recent \nappreciation for education for women and changing socioeconomic realities, especially due to \nthe increased number of households headed by women, consequent to loss of male members, \nthe involvement of women in economic activities is slowly beginning to be acceptable. Although \nwomen will not benefit from direct employment opportunities to be provided under the Project, \nthey  will  benefit  from  reduced  travel  times  and  transport  costs.  With  the  improved  road, \ncombined with increased availability of transport services, women will find it easier to reach \nschools, clinics, hospitals, other market centers, and district and provincial capitals.  \n \n50.  While  the  project  area  is  ethnically  heterogeneous,  different  ethnic  groups  are \nsegregated by functions, and sometimes by district. The social assessment did not identify the \npresence of any indigenous population.  \n \n51.  Afghanistan  is  considered  to  have  a  low  prevalence  of  human  immunodeficiency \nvirus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) prevalence but to be at high risk for \nspread of HIV infection. The reasons behind this include (i) over two decades of protracted \narmed conflicts, (ii) low sociopolitical and economic status of women, (iii) huge numbers of \npeople displaced internally and externally, (iv) the extremely poor social and public health \ninfrastructure, (v) drug trafficking, (vi) use of injecting drugs, and (vii) lack of blood safety \npractices. Only 11 cases of HIV have been reported to the World Health Organization for \nAfghanistan, although many more cases may be undetected and unreported.  \n \n52.  Nongovernment organizations and UN agencies, such as the United Nations Children\u2019s \nFund  and  the  World  Health  Organization,  are  already  active  in  the  area  of  HIV/AIDS  in \nAfghanistan. The Government is working on the National Plan of Action against HIV/AIDS and \nSexually Transmitted Diseases. The national program (2004\u20132010) focuses on surveillance and \nresearch;  prevention  of  HIV/AIDS  through  information,  education  and  communication  and ", "14  \nbehavioral  change  communication;  prevention  and  effective  management  of  sexually \ntransmitted infections; blood safety and voluntary counselling and testing; and care, treatment, \nand support. The national program targets to achieve coverage of 100% district hospitals with \nblood screening services and safe blood supply; establishment of voluntary counselling centers \nin  Kabul  and  several  major  cities;  and  80%  of  provinces  with  sexually  transmitted \ndisease/HIV/AIDS control, care, and support service systems by the end of 2010. In order to link \nwith the national program, a suitable clause requiring the contractors to conduct education and \ncommunication  activities  for  their  employees  with  support  of  qualified  nongovernment \norganizations will be included in the civil works contracts.  \n \n53.  The road improvement will be carried out along the existing alignment and on the \nexisting  embankment.  In  places  were  the  existing  embankment  is  not  wide  enough  to \naccommodate the design width, the shoulder width has been reduced to avoid resettlement \nimpacts. However, after finalization of detailed design during implementation, if resettlement \nimpacts are identified, resettlement plans will be prepared as per ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement. This is addressed in the loan assurances. A summary of the poverty reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 11. \n \nB.  Economic Assessment \n54.  The economic assessment (Appendix 12) was conducted for the entire stretch of the \nHerat-Andkhoy  road  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of \nProjects. The highway design and maintenance model (HDM4) was used to calculate vehicle \noperating costs and time costs with modification for conditions in Afghanistan. The major inputs \ninclude vehicle characteristics and related costs, and construction and maintenance costs. The \nmajor benefits are derived from savings of vehicle operating costs and travel time due to \nrehabilitation of the project road, which will provide a stimulus for economic growth in the project \narea. The time required for traveling from Andkhoy to Qaisar is currently more than 8 hours. The \nProject will reduce this to 2.5 hours. The travel time on the entire Herat-Andkhoy road is \ncurrently more than 24 hours with an average travel speed of slightly more than 20 km/hour. \nTogether with the planned improvement to other road sections of the Herat-Andkhoy road, the \nProject will contribute to significant reduction in travel time and cost, turning the painful road trip \nalong the Herat-Andkhoy road into a safe single-day daylight trip. \n \n55.  The current traffic level is low due to the very poor condition of the road and the overall \nreduced economic activity due to many years of war and the recent severe draught. Considering \nthat a strong economic recovery is anticipated in the short term, a high level of generated and \ninduced traffic is expected. Based on this development prospect, the generated and induced \ntraffic was estimated in absolute numbers assuming expected growth of outputs and activities \nand trip rates, considered to be realized 3 years after the project road becomes operational. \n \n56.  An economic evaluation resulted in an economic internal rate of return of 19.1% for the \noverall project road. The project road was evaluated up to and including 2027, providing a \nbenefit period of 20 years; a residual value of 10% was applied in 2027. The traffic estimate is \nstill conservative, as it does not include international transit traffic from the three neighboring \ncountries (Iran, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) adjacent to the northwest region.  \n \nC.  Environmental Impact  \n57.  The Project is categorized as a \u201cB\u201d project in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003). The initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared and ", "    15\nthe  summary  is  attached  as  Appendix  13.  The  IEE  found  that  the  environmental  impacts \nassociated with the Project would mostly occur during construction. The potential adverse \nimpacts  are  temporary  and  manageable.  Mitigation  measures  will  be  incorporated  in  the \ncontract document. The IEE recommends that no environmental assessment study is required. \n  \nD.  Risks \n58.  Implementation of the Project entails a number of risks: \n \n(i)  The overall political and security situation remains volatile. ADB will need to \nclosely monitor the situation and coordinate with local and central authorities and \nthe UN to ensure adequate protection.30 ADB\u2019s TA for the Security of ADB-\nFinanced Projects in Afghanistan will provide advice on how to ensure a safe \nwork  environment  for  on-site  personnel  assigned  by  the  contractors, \nsubcontractors, and consulting firms. Under the prevailing conditions, however, \nthis  security  risk  cannot  be  mitigated  completely,  and  delays  in  project \nimplementation, if security hazards occur in project locations, will be inevitable \ndespite measures put in place to control the risk. \n \n(ii)  The regional warlords and militia leaders maintain their military strength and their \ninfluence in regional politics. This political instability could hamper smooth supply \nof  raw  materials  and  equipment,  which  would  be  transported  through  areas \ncontrolled by regional warlords and militia leaders, and constrain supervision of \nconstruction works by the consultants and ADB staff.   \n \n(iii)  Improved roads can be used as a route to transport opium. The Government will \nimprove, as part of the national counternarcotics strategy, border procedures to \ncontain the movement of opium. However, the trafficking of opium cannot be \ncompletely contained unless cultivation of opium is eradicated.  \n \n(iv)  Because Government implementation capacity is very weak, implementation of \nkey activities may be delayed. Also the lack of accounting and auditing capacity \nimplies a risk of corruption. Resources will be allocated for consulting services to \nhelp with project management and implementation. Additional capacity-building \ninitiatives focused on financial management have been provided under the TA \ncluster.  The  Government  will  establish  a  strong  coordination  and  monitoring \nmechanism. ADB will also field review missions as frequent as necessary. \n \n(v)  The Government may have difficulty providing required counterpart resources, in \na timely manner. ADB will work closely with MPW to address this issue. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n59.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Security. The Government will make its best effort to provide adequate security \narrangements for smooth and uninterrupted implementation of the Project. \n                                                 \n30  Coordination with the provincial reconstruction teams providing security for development activities in the project \narea may also be explored.  ", "16  \n(ii)  Drug trafficking. The Government will undertake concrete measures to detect \nand prevent opium smuggling by land transport, including by improving border \nprocedures. \n \n(iii)  Road  maintenance  financing.  The  Government  will  allocate  and  make \navailable, in a timely manner, sufficient funds from its budget for each fiscal year \nfor the operation and maintenance of the project facilities, and will ensure that \nsuch facilities are operated and maintained in accordance with sound practices in \nthe transport sector. For the maintenance of the project road, the Government \nwill ensure implementation of a toll collection system on improved roads. In doing \nthis, the Government will adopt adequate procedures to promote transparency \nand accountability in the collection of the proceeds from the toll collection system \nand other means of revenue generation, and install proper procedures including \nspot audits to track any abuse in the collection and utilization of these proceeds. \n \n(iv)  Road  safety.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  road  safety  measures  are \nincorporated in the design of the Project and public awareness campaign of such \nmeasures will be conducted on a periodic basis.  \n \n(v)  Duties and levies. The Government will ensure that no duties or other similar \nlevies will be imposed on any equipment, material, or services required for the \nProject, and if such duties and levies are imposed, they will be paid by the \nGovernment promptly to ensure timely project implementation. \n \n(vi)  Spot audits. The Government will allow and facilitate ADB's representatives to \ncarry out spot and random checks on (i) flow of funds and their use for the \nProject; and (ii) work in progress.  \n \n(vii)  Anticorruption. The Government acknowledges that ADB reserves the right to \nundertake, directly or through its agents, investigation of any possible financial or \nmanagerial impropriety in the conduct of the Project. The Government and each \nof  its  relevant  agencies  will  fully  cooperate  with  any  such  investigation  and \nextend  all  necessary  assistance,  including  access  to  all  relevant  books  and \nrecords that may be needed for satisfactory completion of such investigations.  \n \n(viii)  Land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  indigenous  people.  To  the  extent \nfeasible, the Government will ensure that the reconstruction and rehabilitation of \nthe project road will be carried out on land already acquired and/or owned by the \nGovernment. If adjustments to the rights-of-way necessitate land acquisition, a \nresettlement plan will be prepared by the Government and submitted to ADB for \nreview and approval to ensure that the social and economic base of the affected \npersons, regardless of the land title, will be restored and/or enhanced through \nmitigating measures. The Government will ensure that any land acquisition and \nresettlement activities will be carried out in accordance with the relevant laws and \npolicies of the Government, ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) \nand  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998),  which  will  be  set  out  in  the \nresettlement plan. The Government will also ensure that all land and rights-of-\nway  required  for  project  implementation  will  be  made  available  in  a  timely \nmanner. If  any adverse impacts  on indigenous peoples are identified during \nproject  implementation,  the  Government  will  prepare  an  indigenous  peoples ", "    17\ndevelopment  plan  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples \n(1998). \n \n(ix)  Environmental  protection.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  adequate \nenvironmental  protection  and  safety  measures  as  described  in  the  IEE  and \nsummary IEE are included in the design of the project facilities; and that the \nProject  is  implemented,  operated,  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  the \nrelevant laws and policies of the Government, ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), \nthe IEE, and summary IEE including the environment monitoring plan. \n \n(x)  Local consultation and gender. The Government will ensure that a specific \nplan for local consultation to address safety, social, and cultural issues, during \nproject  implementation,  will  be  included  in  the  bidding  documents.  The \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  men  and  women  are  given  equal  employment \nopportunities, without any differentiation of wages for equal work by the civil \nworks contractors. The mechanisms for maximizing local employment benefits \nwill be included in the project design and the bidding documents.  \n \n(xi)  Labor. The Government will ensure that the civil works contracts include legally \nmandated  provisions  on  health  and  sanitation  and  on  appropriate  working \nconditions, including as appropriate, accommodation for construction workers at \ncampsites during the construction period. The Government will also ensure that \ncivil work contractors do not employ children for construction and maintenance \nworks. A specific clause to this effect will be included in the bidding documents \nand compliance will be strictly monitored during project implementation. \n \n(xii)  Health risks and provisions. MPW will ensure that the civil works contracts \ninclude a requirement to conduct an information and education campaign on \nsexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS for construction workers as part of \nthe health and safety program at camp sites during the construction period. MPW \nwill also develop linkages with national HIV/AIDS prevention or control programs \nin a timely manner so that the HIV/AIDS prevention activities required under the \nProject are properly carried out. \n \n(xiii)  The PMU. Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will ensure \nthat the additionally required PMU staff, comprising a project accountant, two \nengineers, and other administrative staff, will have been appointed. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATIONS \n60.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n  \n(i)   the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights \n53,087,000 to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Andkhoy-Qaisar \nRoad Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at \nthe rate of 1% per annum; a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 \nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board; in \naddition, the total amount of interest charge during the grace period will be \ncapitalized and charged to the loan account; and  ", "18  \n(ii)   in respect of such loan, a variation from the existing loan terms under ADF \nresources on an exceptional basis. \n \n61.  I recommend that the Board approve the proposal set out in para. 37 of this report that \nbitumen procured from nonmember countries of ADB for civil works be eligible for financing \nunder the Project. If the requisite affirmative votes of directors representing not less than two \nthirds of the total voting power of ADB member countries, pursuant to Article 14(ix) of the \nAgreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank, is not obtained for this recommendation \nand the Board only approves the recommendation in para. 60, then bitumen for civil works \nprocured only from member countries of ADB will be eligible for financing under the Project.  \n \n \n \n \n              Tadao Chino \n                   President \n \n22 November 2004 ", "   Appendix 1  19\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance  Monitoring  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  Risks \nGoal       \nPromote economic  A 15% increase in per  National, provincial,   \nand social  capita income in the  and district \ndevelopment and  project area over 3  socioeconomic \nreduce poverty in the  years  statistics from the \nproject area.

Road Network \n \n1.  Afghanistan\u2019s road network comprises about 6,100 kilometers (km) of national roads and \n15,000 km of provincial roads. Of the national roads, 3,300 km are national primary roads \nincluding 2,400 km that were originally paved. The national primary road network consists \nlargely of the 2,300 km ring road that connects Afghanistan\u2019s major regional centers (Herat, \nKandahar, Mazar-e-Sharif, Maimana, and Sheberghan) with Kabul, and the roads linking to \nneighboring countries including Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The \nremaining 2,800 km of national roads are secondary roads with either gravel or earthen surface. \nThe 15,000 km of provincial roads are gravel or earthen, and categorized into 5,400 km of \nprovincial primary roads and 9,600 km of provincial secondary roads. The tertiary road network \nconsists of rural roads that are roughly estimated to be 15,000\u201320,000 km, and substantial \nlengths of urban roads roughly estimated to be 3,000 km including 1,060 km in Kabul. \n \n2.  Most of the national primary road network was improved to the paved standard before \nthe  conflict,  mainly  with  external  assistance.  The  ring-road  section  from  Jawzjan-Faryab \nprovince border to Herat (575 km) was left unpaved due to the outbreak of civil conflict.  \n \n3.  Much of Afghanistan\u2019s road infrastructure was destroyed or damaged in more than two \ndecades of conflict. Lack of resources and capacity prevented maintenance, and has led to \nmajor  deterioration  and  loss  of  infrastructure.  The  effects  of  military  actions  are  more \npronounced in the form of damaged bridges and tunnels, which have become bottlenecks to the \nmovement of people and goods. Restricted movement aggravates the country\u2019s division and \ndisintegration, as travel time and vehicle operating cost on roads have significantly increased.1 \n  \n4.  According to the comprehensive needs assessment on the Afghanistan transport sector, \ncarried out during March-May 2002 by major external funding agencies including the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), 54% of the national roads are in poor condition, 26% in fair condition, \nand only 20% in good condition. It urged the entire primary road network be rehabilitated on a \npriority basis.2 \n \n5.  5.  Afghanistan\u2019s road network is characterized by very low road density. The road \ndensity of 0.03 km per square km (km2) is far lower than that of Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, \nwhich also have largely mountainous terrain and similar population densities, and even lower \nthan 0.07 km/km2 road density of Balochistan in Pakistan, whose population density is about \nhalf of Afghanistan\u2019s. Even without the damage inflicted during the conflict period, Afghanistan\u2019s \nroad network is in need of substantial improvement to provide basic connectivity that is available \nelsewhere in the subregion.   \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Travel from Kabul to Kandahar (1,066 km) used to take less than 12 hours before the conflict. Soon after the \nconflict, it took about 30 hours with a four-wheel drive vehicle. \n2 A preliminary needs assessment  was conducted in December 2001 by ADB, United Nations Development \nProgramme, and World Bank, and was presented at the Ministerial Meeting in Tokyo in January 2002, where \nexternal funding agencies pledged about $4.5 billion assistance.

The number of vehicles has increased significantly over the past 2 years. According to \nstatistics provided in a recent International Monetary Fund country report on Afghanistan,3 \ntransport of goods by road increased from 1.9 million tons in 2000 to 3.7 million tons in 2001 \nand 5 million tons in 2002, representing an almost fourfold increase. Number of taxicabs nearly \ndoubled from 17,000 in 2000 to 33,500 in 2002. More than 147,000 vehicles were estimated to \nbe registered in Kabul, which under certain assumptions would translate into about 304,000 \nvehicles countrywide. Most vehicles are owned and operated by the private sector.  \n \n7.  The Ministry of Transport (MOT)-operated fleet has been severely depleted. According \nto the Central Statistical Office, in 2002 the Government owned and operated 22,459 vehicles \nconsisting of 10,913 trucks (MOT: 210), 2,741 buses (MOT Millie buses: 230), and 8,162 cars, \nbut nearly all these vehicles no longer exist. According to the Transport Sector Review, the \ncentrally owned bus and lorry companies and also the trolley bus service have practically \ncollapsed. MOT now has some of the Kamaz freight agencies and the Millie bus agency. MOT \nretains a trolley bus department, but no vehicles, workshops, or power supply network, which \nhave all been destroyed. \n \n8.  The Afghan private sector has historically played a dominant role in trucking and has \nmaintained its presence, including individuals and firms that relocated in Pakistan during the war \nyears.  As  expected,  long  distance  public  transport,  linking  major  cities  and  neighboring \ncountries, has deteriorated due to road and vehicle conditions as well as suppressed demand \nfor road travel. Security remains a key concern. Urban transport is available, on a limited scale, \nin Kabul and provincial capitals. \n  \n9.  Urban  transport,  once  dominated  by  the  public  sector,  is  now  mostly  provided  by \nprivately owned buses, taxis, and minivans. Forms of regional transport depend on the state of \nthe roads and the availability of vehicles. People and goods move together, blurring distinction \nbetween passenger and commercial freight traffic. Private agencies operate provincial and \ndistrict routes. Some 165 registered long-distance private bus companies are estimated to be \noperating\u2014101 based in Kabul, 64 in provinces\u2014with a total of 14,007 buses, mostly old \nminibuses and vans. \n \n10.  The taxi system in Afghanistan is widespread and well organized. According to MOT, 24 \ntaxi  unions  registered  in  Kabul  and  27  in  the  provinces  have  a  total  of  29,131  vehicles. \n                                                 \n3  International Monetary Fund. 2003.

", "Appendix 2  25\nAccording to the Transport Sector Review, the real number of taxis in Kabul is perhaps 30,000. \nTaxis seem to operate freely, with little adherence to zonal or any other rules. In addition, \nintermediate size vehicles of all sizes and shapes also transport passengers and goods. \n \nC.   Road Administration \n \n11.  Road administration is highly centralized. Before the protracted hostilities, the Ministry of \nPublic Works (MPW), through its 15 departments, was virtually responsible for all government \nconstruction and maintenance, including roads and bridges, airports, public housing, and water \nsupply. All aspects of planning, design, construction, and maintenance were carried out in-\nhouse  through  a  number  of  MPW  construction  units.  Before  1992,  just  one  of  MPW\u2019s \ndepartments,  Road  Construction  and  Development,  had  more  than  5,000  employees.  In \naddition, MPW had a multitude of other responsibilities such as city planning, and collection of \nroad tolls. Theoretically, MPW retains all of these responsibilities. The Ministry of Rehabilitation \nand Rural Development is responsible for development of rural infrastructure, including rural \nroads. Construction and maintenance of urban roads are the responsibility of municipalities. \n \n12.  Over the course of the conflict, the Government ministries lost a majority of their trained \nstaff. In provinces where staff and equipment were retained, they were often under the influence \nof provincial governments and not fully under the control of the ministry headquarters in Kabul. \nThis situation is gradually being realigned as the central Government successfully extends its \ncontrol outside Kabul to provinces. The current staffing level of MPW is about 2,900, of which \n900 are employed on a permanent basis, 1,900 are paid daily wages, and 140 are military \nofficers. Most of the current staff require substantial skills enhancement to perform their duties. \n \n13.  To fill the capacity gap, most of the externally funded projects are being implemented \nwith assistance of international consultants in project management. Civil works are packaged \ninto large contracts and bid out through competitive procedures to private sector contractors. \nConsultants engaged by MPW supervise the works of contractors. MPW is being transformed \ninto  a  lean  and  thin  organization  with  its  primary  task  being  nationwide  policy  formation, \nplanning of the countrywide road network, setting of standards (including technical, safety, \nsocial, and environmental safeguards), regulation and enforcement functions, and management \nof roads under its jurisdiction. \n \n \n \nFigure A2: Current Organizational Structure of Ministry of Public Works \n \n \n  Minister \n \n \n \nDeputy Minister \n \n \n \n  Directorate  Directorate  Directorate of  Directorate of  Directorate of \n  of Railways  of Planning  Administration Road  Road Construction \n  Maintenance and Airports\n \nDirectorate of  Directorate of  Directorate of  Directorate of \n \nSurvey and  Financial  Audit and  Technical/ \n \nProject Design  Administration Controller Mechanical\n ", "26 Appendix 2 \nD.   Road Subsector Revenues and Expenditures \n \n14.  Currently, capital investment to rehabilitate and reconstruct roads in Afghanistan is \nmainly financed by external assistance. The current commitments to Afghanistan\u2019s road \nsubsector by the external bilateral/multilateral funding agencies amount to approximately $1 \nbillion, including $800 million for national primary roads, $130 million for national secondary \nroads, and $30 million for provincial roads. These commitments are mainly to rehabilitate \ndamaged roads.  \n \n15.  For the improvement of the road network, the Government has set a target to double \nthe share of total paved roads from the present 16% to 32% by 2010, or from the present \n0.15 km of paved roads per 1,000 people to 0.23 km per 1,000 in 2010. To reach this target, \nthe new investment needs from 2004 to 2010 will be for $4.3 billion outside the existing \ncommitment: $1.7 billion for national primary roads, $1.1 billion for national secondary \nroads, and $1.5 billion for provincial roads.4 Considering the limited prospect for private \nsector financing of these large investments in the foreseeable future, the public sector will \ncontinue to be responsible for filling the financing gap.  \n \n16.  Afghanistan has a history of toll collection for road maintenance. The first toll system \nwas implemented in 1974. Tolls were collected by way of a system of toll stations scattered \nthroughout the country, and the revenue was accrued to the central revenue fund with no \nearmarking for the road subsector. The allocations to the road subsector were by way of \nappropriations from the central revenue fund. A new system implemented in 1999 introduced \nearmarking  the  funds  for  construction  and  maintenance  of  highways.  MPW  organized  toll \ncollection and the tolls were viewed as a source of MPW revenue. Through a decision by the \nHigh Council of Ministers on 23 September 2002, this road toll system was abolished. Private \nparties had established unauthorized toll collection stations in a number of locations, which \ncreated hardships for travelers without contributing to the maintenance program.  \n \n17.  At present, fuel, spares, or vehicles area not taxed, except for customs duties. Some \nfees/levies are charged by the Ministry of Interior and Provincial Finance Department for vehicle \nregistration and renewal.  \n \n18.  The Government is in the process of establishing a tax regime. A few more years may \nbe required to fully implement the new tax regime. In the meantime, imposing tolls, in particular \non roads that have recently been rehabilitated, is viewed as an effective way to generate much-\nneeded revenue for road-related expenditure. Approximately $80 million is estimated to be \nrequired annually to maintain the entire road network. For a country with domestic revenues of \n$300 million, this will be a challenge. The Government is currently considering reinstating toll \ncollection on improved road sections5 to cover the maintenance cost as well as to recover part \nof the capital investment cost.  \n \nE.   Road Maintenance \n \n19.  As the rehabilitation and reconstruction work progresses, new assets are being created, \nadding to the already high demands for road maintenance activities.

MPW plans to replicate its experience gained in Kabul to reforming the operation and \nmaintenance departments in its eight provincial departments. \n \n20.  As an asset manager of the national road network, MPW will have limited options: (i) it \ncan  contract  out  large  corridors  to  private  sector  contractors  on  an  annual  or  multiyear \nspecification-based maintenance contract; or (ii) for some strategic locations and to take care of \nemergency situations, it can use its own fleet of maintenance equipment and personnel.

Background and Purpose \n \n1.  The transport sector is one of the keys to the future development and well being of \nAfghanistan. The country\u2019s mountainous features give rise to high transport costs, leave many \ncommunities profoundly isolated, and pose a challenge to nation building. Being land-locked \nadds to Afghanistan\u2019s vulnerability. An efficient transport sector will not only reduce costs in \ncomparison with the current situation; it is a pre-condition for strengthening the unity of the \ncountry, and promoting cohesion and the Afghan identity.  \n \n2.  With this Policy Statement, the Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan (TISA) wishes \nto chart a course for the development of the Afghan transport sector based on explicit policy \nformulations. The Statement represents the first policy document for the transport sector since \nthe  Bonn  Agreement  in  December  2001,  and  supplements  the  National  Development \nFramework. It is viewed as an interim policy as the current administration is transitional; it is \nexpected to be restated once the new administration in terms of the new constitution has come \ninto power. Relevant provisions of the new constitution will be reflected in the restated Policy \nStatement  for  the  Transport  Sector.  The  restated  Statement  will  also  incorporate  relevant \nrecommendations  from  the  Civil  Service  and  Privatization  Commissions,  accepted  by \nGovernment. These Commissions were still working on their recommendations at the time of \npreparing this Statement. \n \n3.  The need for a Policy Statement emanates from the condition that current legislation and \ninstitutional arrangements in the public sector have to a large extent been shaped during the \nperiod  of  occupation  when  foreign  powers  exerted  heavy  influence  on  policy  matters  in \nAfghanistan. The transport sector is hence characterized by heavy reliance on public ownership, \ncentralization  and  archaic  organizational  arrangements  in  the  public  sector.  Production  of \ntransport services is often in the hands of the public sector, and ministries are therefore not only \nengaged in determining policy but also, and more so, in operations and regulation. \n \n4.  The current arrangements do not promote efficiency and often also make it difficult to \neffectively address matters of public interest. The evidence may be seen all over the country: \nroads are not being maintained, transport services are of poor quality, the aviation safety \nsystem does not meet international standards, and road traffic safety is poor by any standards. \nThis position is not only a result of the past conflicts and lack of funds; they also derive from \ninadequate policies and institutional arrangements. \n \n5.  The purposes of this Statement are: \n \n(i)  To formulate a long-term vision (10\u201315 years) for the overall development of the \ntransport  sector;  the  realization  of  this  vision  assumes  peaceful  conditions \nprevailing in the country; and \n(ii)  To provide a framework for the identification of key actions required in the first \nphase for transforming the transport sector, encompassing the period up to the \nend of year 2008 (1387). \n \n                                                 \n1  Prepared as part of the Transport Sector Review, and was endorsed by the Ministry of Public Works (MPW), \nMinistry of Transport (MOT), and Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism (MCAT) in January 2004. ", "30 Appendix 4 \n6.  This Statement will serve as a guideline for the work of TISA and its successor; it is also \nexpected that donors active in the transport sector will take it as a guide, to ensure that their \nsupport achieves maximum development impact, and ultimately the successful reconstruction of \nAfghanistan. \n \n7.  The focus of this Statement is on the role and structure of government, the role of the \nprivate sector, and the approach for how to address public interest issues in the transport \nsector. \n \n8.  All modes of transport are covered. \n \nB.  The Basic Policy Objectives \n \n9.  The basic policy objectives of the Government are to: \n \n(i)  promote economic growth; \n(ii)  eradicate acute poverty; and \n(iii)  strengthen national unity. \n \n10.  To attain these objectives, resource utilization in the transport sector must be radically \nimproved. This will have to be achieved whilst adequately addressing public interest issues such \nas: \n \n(i)  the provision of safe and secure transport services; \n(ii)  the protection of the environment; \n(iii)  the promotion of gender equality, attention to women needs in transport and \nparticipation of women in the sector; \n(iv)  the improvement in accessibility to rural and urban areas; and \n(v)  the promotion of competition. \n \nC.  The Means to Attain the Objectives \n \n11.  The main functions in the transport sector can be identified as follows: \n \n(i)  The supply of transport services, including intermediate services such as freight \nforwarding, clearing, and other agency services. \n(ii)  The provision and preservation of infrastructure. \n(iii)  The performance of regulatory activities to address public interest issues. \n(iv)  The performance of policy making and overall monitoring of sector development. \n \n12.  The Government\u2019s view is that efficiency in the provision of transport services will best \nbe attained by allowing competition and private sector participation. Transport services are, in \ngeneral, best produced subject to the minimum of economic regulation with regard to entry, \ncapacity and pricing. \n \n13.  The public sector has a much more central role in the provision of infrastructure on \naccount of characteristics that cannot easily be handled by private interests, including high risks, \nnetwork  effects  and  other  external  effects.  However,  the  Government  is  cognizant  of \ninternational experience in relation to arrangements for the planning, provision and operation of \ninfrastructure that may significantly contribute to efficiency. These include: \n ", "Appendix 4  31\n(i)  The need for delegation of management to autonomous organizations within a \ngovernance framework providing for effective enforcement of accountability. \n(ii)  The importance of ensuring involvement by the users of infrastructure in the \ngovernance of the organizations charged with management. This may also entail \ndecentralization of the management of infrastructure. \n(iii)  The importance of establishing self-financing mechanisms for the preservation, \nand also provision, of infrastructure facilities. \n(iv)  The need to engage contractors by competitive tendering procedures for the \nprovision and preservation of infrastructure facilities \n \n14.  This notwithstanding, the Government recognizes that a market-based approach in the \ntransport sector combined with autonomous management and self-financing of infrastructure \nfacilities, whilst necessary, is not sufficient means to ensure a well-functioning transport sector. \nThere are a number of public interest issues to be addressed as well, and these require \nregulation, which is a domain of the public sector. \n \n15.  The nature of the regulation required varies. Thus, some issues are not simply a concern \nof the transport sector, but cut across all sectors of the economy. For example certain aspects \nof environmental control relate to activities in other sectors as well. And the promotion of \ncompetition is a regulatory activity, which applies throughout the economy; it is therefore not \nconsidered further here. \n \n16.  Other issues are exclusive concerns of the transport sector, such as safety, security and \nthe dimensions and environmental features of vehicles and aircraft. Regulatory activities in \nthese areas essentially comprise the setting and enforcement of\u2014or the provision of incentives \nto abide by\u2014standards. Regulation is primarily directed towards individuals or companies. \n \n17.  With regard to accessibility and gender, regulation may include standard setting and \nenforcement, but the issues at hand may require a more pro-active role by the public sector. \nAccessibility is related to the provision of transport and infrastructure services at affordable \nprices to certain communities, which would be inadequately served by way of a purely market-\nbased approach. These communities, in addition, often tend to be poor and to live in very \nremote areas of the country or in inaccessible parts of urban areas. \n \n18.  The Government\u2019s role with regard to accessibility is threefold: \n \n(i)  To formulate policies and establish standards with regard to accessibility. \n(ii)  To identify and establish an institutional framework which can effectively identify \nand put in place the means to implement policies and improve and achieve \nstandards of accessibility. \n(iii)  To provide finance to ensure improved accessibility. \n \n19.  Regulatory  activities  with  regard  to  gender  normally  cut  across  all  sectors  in  the \neconomy, for example measures to promote women careers in the public service. But there are \nalso some transport sector dimensions to be noted: \n \n(i)  There are specific enforcement issues with regard to the use by women of taxis, \nbuses and other means of transport, to ensure an equal treatment of both sexes. \n(ii)  There is a need to identify and develop transport solutions, which are responsive \nto the needs of women. An implication of this is that the organizations charged \nwith the management of infrastructure and the provision of solutions for meeting ", "32 Appendix 4 \naccessibility standards must also review needs from a gender perspective. This \nmay  be  achieved  by  ensuring  women  representation  on  boards  in  agencies \nand/or incorporating appropriate instructions in planning and design manuals. \n \n20.  Since much regulation is of an operational nature, efficiency in performing regulatory \nfunctions can often be achieved by delegation to autonomous organizations, agencies, which \nperform their business within a transparent governance framework. This applies e.g. to the \nperformance  of  regulatory  functions  to  promote  safety  and  security  in  transport  and \ninfrastructure  operations,  as  well  as  to  improve  the  environment.  It  is  desirable  that  such \norganizations are largely self-financing. It is the Government\u2019s wish to promote the development \nof agencies of this nature. \n \n21.  Policy formulation, international relations, the drafting of legislation and sector monitoring \nare obvious functions for the public sector, and indeed the main functions to be performed by a \nministry in the transport sector. \n \nD.  The Long-Term Vision for the Transport Sector \n \n22.  In terms of the overall objectives and the means identified to attain these objectives, and \nbased on international experience, the Government has formulated the following vision for the \ntransport sector. \n \n(i)  Transport  services:  Transport  operations  will  be  performed  by  private \noperators, subject to competition. This will apply to the provision of taxi, road \nhaulage and bus transport, all intermediate services and air transport services. \nSubject to international agreements, competition is also expected to rule on \ninternational routes, including with respect to air transport, bus transport and road \nhaulage. Transport operations will normally be provided without public subsidy. \nHowever,  certain  domestic  services  may  be  provided  under  public  service \nobligations, in order to ensure that minimum standards of accessibility in the \ncountry or urban areas are met. Such public service obligations will be procured \nby competitive tendering. \n(ii)  Roads:  The  national  road  network  will  have  been  rehabilitated,  and  where \nrequired, upgraded. It will be managed by an autonomous road agency, and its \npreservation and further development financed by road user charges, which are \nnot part of the consolidated budget. Provincial and local roads will be managed \nby provincial and/or local road authorities, and a substantial part of their costs will \nalso be financed by way of road user charges. A road fund will have been \nestablished to collect the road user charges and to serve as the procurer of road \nservices from the road agency and local roads authorities, and hence to serve as \nthe regulator of the road sector. Donor assistance will be directed towards the \ndevelopment of rural roads required to improve accessibility. Road works will \nmainly  be  done  by  contractors,  including  under  long-term  contracts  for \nmaintenance.  A  substantial  amount  of  work  will  be  contracted  out  to  small \ncontractors using labor-based techniques. \n(iii)  Airports and the air navigation system: The airports of the country will be \nmanaged by a number of airport companies. It is expected that these, with the \nexception of the airport in Kabul, will essentially have provincial ownership. The \nairports will be self-financing for their operations (but not necessarily for their \ndevelopment). The air navigation system (ANS) will be operated by a separate \ncorporate  self-financing  entity;  it  will  also  operate  the  ANS  at  the  airports. ", "Appendix 4  33\nLegislation  establishing  the  airports  and  ANS  corporations  will  enable  the \nfacilities  and  services  to  be  privately  financed  and  operated  in  terms  of  a \nconcession. A system for economic regulation, comprising mainly self-regulatory \narrangements, with regard to the airports and ANS will have been established. \n(iv)  Safety: A new agency for the regulation of safety, security and environmental \nprotection in aviation will have been established. Similarly, the regulation of road \ntraffic with regard to safety and environmental aspects specific to the road sector \nwill have been entrusted to another agency, also expected to handle registration \nof licenses and vehicles. Both as concerns aviation and road traffic, Afghanistan \nwill regulate safety and security adequately in terms of internationally accepted \nstandards. \n(v)  Railways and rivers: Investments in river transport facilities and railways will be \nencouraged.  River  and  railway  transport  developments  will  essentially  be  a \nresponsibility  of  the  private  sector.  The  government  may  participate  in  such \ndevelopments provided that demonstrated economic benefits may be derived \ntherefrom, which cannot be captured by private investors, or in order to improve \naccessibility to remote regions in a cost-effective manner. \n(vi)  Organization  of  government  in  transport:  A  new  ministry  will  have  been \nestablished, to replace the current three ministries in the transport sector, i.e. \nMinistry of Transport, Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism and the Ministry of \nPublic Works (MPW), and will be charged with policy work for the road sector, \nroad transport, multi-modal transport, air transport, and new modes, such as rail \nand river transport. This new ministry will ultimately also be responsible for road \ntraffic (except enforcement), an area which today partly falls under the Ministry of \nInterior, as well as policy matters related to rural roads, which are today handled \nby the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development. The new ministry will \nadditionally have become responsible for international relations and for preparing \nthe public budget in the sector. The ministry will have a staff of a couple of \nhundred  persons.  To  ensure  accountability  of  the  new  agencies  and \ncorporations, an explicit governance regime will have been put in place. The \ngovernance regime will encompass objectives for these organizations that may \nbe measured, the publication of periodic and annual reports to shed light on the \nattainment of the objectives, and arrangements to allow for the involvement of \nusers and other stakeholders. The day-to-day monitoring of these organizations \nwill normally be performed by the new ministry in the transport sector. \n \nE.  Short-Term Conditions \n \n23.  The  vision  formulated  above  is  ambitious;  it  will  be  a  challenge  to  Afghanistan  to \nrestructure the transport sector accordingly, but to ensure the well being of its citizen\u2019s attempts \nmust be made. In the short run perspective it is important to embark on a process of change \nthat will eventually lead towards the realization of the vision. \n \n24.  In the short-term, the Government has decided to also take the following considerations \ninto account: \n \n(i)  Privatization is not possible in the near future of the national carrier, Ariana, as it \nis loss making. Similarly, in the near future it will not be possible to privatize the \nMinistry of Transport road haulage and bus transport operations, as the country \nhas received and is receiving a substantial number of donated vehicles. These \noperations should, however, be commercialized, as a first step towards later \nprivatization. ", "34 Appendix 4 \n(ii)  In international air transport operation there will be a need to offer protection to \nAriana for a period of time. There are two reasons, viz. the need to ensure \ninternational connectivity given that the aviation safety and security system in \nAfghanistan  has  not  been  ICAO  certified,  and  the  modalities  with  regard  to \ninternational aviation in the region. Ariana is, however, expected to be profitable \nand only to serve routes not expected to be loss making in a medium term \nperspective.  Also,  the  small  domestic  market,  in  part  on  account  of  the \ninadequate facilities at present, does not lend itself to open competition for the \ntime being, but may provide scope for a regulated system designed to encourage \nthe participation of the private sector. However, air cargo may be liberalized. \n(iii)  The country at present does not have an established corps of contractors. Whilst \nconstruction works, and large maintenance contracts may be handled by way of \ninternational contractors, local contractors can for some time only be expected to \nhandle part of the maintenance works. There will therefore be a need for the \nMPW to maintain limited force account capacity for the time being to perform \n(routine)  road  maintenance  and  also  to  undertake  emergency  repairs  to \nsupplement the capacity of the private sector. \n(iv)  The current administrative weakness of the provinces implies that decentralized \nsolutions as concerns e.g. airports and road sector management will have to be \ndelayed for some time. \n(v)  For the time being, the financing arrangements in the road sector are subject to \nagreement  reached  by  the  TISA  with  the  World  Bank  concerning  the \nimplementation of the Emergency Transport Rehabilitation Project. \n(vi)  Fundamental restructuring of the ministries is not possible at present. However, \npartial restructuring in terms of the Decree on Priority Reform and Restructuring \nwithin  Ministries  may  be  effected.  This  Decree  allows  for  departments  of \nministries to be given priority reform and restructuring (PRR) status, so that \nindividuals appointed to key posts in these departments may be offered better \nconditions on a time-limited basis and subject to performance. In addition, in the \nnear future the functions related to (i) vehicle registration and drivers\u2019 licensing \nshould be transferred from the Ministry of Interior to the Ministry of Transport, (ii) \nairport airside infrastructure should be transferred from the Ministry of Public \nWorks to the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism, and (iii) rural roads from the \nMinistry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development to the Ministry of Public Works. \n \nF.  Short-Term Actions \n \n25.  Based on the above considerations, a number of short term actions\u2014in order to initiate \nreform  of  the  transport  sector\u2014will  be  proposed  by  the  Transport  Sector  Review  for \nimplementation during the period up to the end of 2008; see the Action Plan of the Transport \nSector Review. \n \nG.  Capacity Building \n \n26.  The  Policy  Statement  places  emphasis  on  the  private  sector  in  rebuilding  and \ndeveloping  the  transport  sector.  The  Government\u2019s  view  is  that  a  key  to  trigger  this \ndevelopment, but also to ensure a balanced approach with adequate attention paid to the public \ninterest issues, is building the capacity of the public sector. The challenge is formidable in view \nof the shortage of skills and the fact that the ministries until recently were steeped in a culture \ninappropriate to the future needs. To be able to move forward, the existing ministries will have to \nbe used as a platform to implement change and reform. ", "Appendix 4  35\n27.  The  following  steps  are  envisaged  by  Government  as  part  of  capacity\u2014including \ninstitution\u2014building: \n \n(i)  Each ministry will set up a new department to be charged with capacity building. \nThis capacity building department 2(CBD) is envisaged to be given priority reform \nand restructuring (PRR) status in terms of the decree on Priority Reform and \nRestructuring within Ministries. The head of the CBD will report to the deputy \nminister or the minister. \n(ii)  Each CBD will be provided with a technical assistance (TA) team comprising \nthree types of experts: (i) development of the management and administration of \na ministry; (ii) experts in the specific functions of the ministry concerned; (iii) \nexperts in training in the skills to be possessed by the ministry concerned. The \nTA team leader will report to the head of the CBD, and on an interim basis to the \nminister/deputy minister. \n(iii)  The CBD will design new departments corresponding to the future needs of the \nMinistry. Once such a department has been designed, and key staff members \nidentified, an application for PRR status will be made, and the department will \nthen be launched. \n(iv)  New  structures,  including  the  envisaged  future  airports  corporations,  ANS \ncorporation, and agencies in aviation, roads and road traffic, will initially also be \nestablished as a new department, which will be given PRR status. Once this \ndepartment has been set up, and basic recruitment completed, the next step will \nbe  prepared  by  the  CBD,  leading  up  to  the  launching  of  the  agency  or \ncorporation, and subsequent closure of the department in question. \n(v)  The CBD will serve as the gender focal point to the Gender Advisory Group, and \nwill be expected to implement a gender operational policy.  \n \n28.  It  is  expected  that  the  capacity  building  units  can  be  established  in  the  form  of  a \ndepartment by the three transport ministries by early 2004 (1383). \n \nH.  The Role of Donors \n \n29.  The Government expects donors to play a key role in supporting the reform of the \ntransport sector both in the short and long run as set out in this Policy Statement. Donors are \nencouraged to make reference to this Policy Statement when designing and proposing support \nactivities to the Government. Donors are furthermore encouraged to co-ordinate their efforts \nwithin the framework of the Consultative Group of Transport. It is anticipated that this Group will \nprovide a forum for debate on support to the sector, but also serve as a platform for streamlining \ndonors\u2019 approach to the planning of support, as well as procedures for procurement. \n \n30.  Donors are particularly encouraged to in the shorter term lend their support to the \nenvisaged capacity building units in the three ministries in the transport sector, as proposed in \nthis Statement. In the medium term donors can fruitfully assist with the establishment of new \ncorporations and agencies, including the required governance framework, and the building of \ncapacity to handle procurement and contract supervision, including labor-based works. In the \nlonger term, a main concern of donors could be to assist with improving accessibility. \n                                                 \n2  The CBD is referred to as the Reform and Restructuring Office (RRO) in other documents of the Transport Sector \nReview. \n ", "36  Appendix 5   \n \nPROJECT ROAD AND SUMMARY OF DESIGN STANDARDS \n \n1.

This ring road adjoins links to border crossings into Afghanistan\u2019 neighboring countries, in turn forming \npart of a subregional road transport corridor.   \n \nThe rehabilitation and reconstruction of the road will contribute to employment creation, income generation at the \nhousehold level, rehabilitation of  displaced persons and ex-combatants, improvement of security  and stability, \ninterethnic reconciliation, and political unification of the country. The Project will utilize, to the extent possible, labor-\nintensive construction methods to provide much-needed employment and income-generation opportunities. Thus, this \ninvestment will significantly improve the socioeconomic situations, and mitigate the pervasive poverty and plight widely \nspread among the resident population and returning migrants. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                 Targeting Classification: General intervention           \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nAbout 53% of the population in Afghanistan are classified as poor and live on less than $1 a day.1 The prolonged war \nin the country exacerbated by drought has severely affected the livelihoods of the local population. Decreased farm \nproductivity and loss of seasonal opportunities for agricultural labor is one of the main determinants of poverty. The \npresent state of infrastructure, especially roads, is a severe constraint in the revival of food security, livelihood \nopportunities, provision of and accessibility to social and economic services, and overall economic growth. An \nestimate of poverty incidence through proxy measures in the project influence area indicates that about 35\u201350% \nhouseholds are poor, and among the poor households 50\u201380% are living in absolute poverty. The average monthly \nincome of the poor households is as low as AF3,700 with the very poor households being more concentrated in \nFaryab province. Most villages in the project influence area lack primary health care facilities or they are located at \nleast 10 kilometers (km) away from basic health care clinics. Due to absence of primary health care facilities coupled \nwith poor condition of roads and lack of transportation facilities, the mortality rate was observed to be high among \nwomen and children from simple complications of childbirth, lack of proper immunization, and preventable childhood \nillness. Afghanistan ranks 4th highest for the under-5 mortality rate at 257 deaths /1,000 and the infant mortality rate is \nat a high 165/1000.2  \n \nThe direct poverty impact would be from income generation and demand for unskilled labor resulting directly from road \nconstruction. The estimated cost of unskilled labor for constructing the project road is 6% of the total civil works, and \nthe wages accruing to unskilled labor is calculated as AF10 million. The improved road will significantly reduce \ntransport cost and travel time. This will translate into improved access to schools, medical clinics, and employment \ncenters. Further, the improved road would decrease the chances of accident deaths and disabilities that have resulted \nfrom extremely poor road conditions. The poverty impact ratio (0.69) indicates that the poor will receive a high \nproportion of these benefits. The indirect, but important impact will be the growth of local trade, production activities, \nand reduced prices of commodities facilitated by improved access to local, national, and international markets. The \nroad improvement is also expected to mainstream local economies with the overall national economy, and facilitate \nexploitation of available natural resources, such as minerals, gas, and other resources. These benefits are expected to \nsignificantly increase household incomes and quality of life, and reduce the overall poverty incidence.  \n \n                                                                  \n1  Asian Development Bank. 2003.

Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nIncidence of poverty among women is higher compared with men and is characterized by low endowment of land and \nproductive assets, unemployment, discrimination in the labor market, and limited access to economic options and \npolitical processes. Women in Afghanistan are generally denied inheritance rights, adequate food and nutrition, choice \nof education, and participation in the decision-making process of household economic activities. The level of education \nattainment in elementary schools in the project area ranges between 12\u201336% for females compared with 62\u201377% for \nmales. However,  with the recent appreciation for education for  women and changing socioeconomic realities, \nespecially due to the increased number of households headed by women, consequent to loss of male members, the \nrole of women in economic activities is slowly beginning to be acceptable. Although, women will not benefit from direct \nemployment opportunities working on the construction of the highway, but will benefit from reduced travel times and \ntransport costs. With the improved road, combined with increased availability of transport services, women will find it \neasier to reach schools, clinics, and hospitals, other market centers, and, if needed, to district and provincial capitals.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Introduction \n \n1.  The benefit and cost analysis over the overall road section between Andkhoy and Herat \nwas conducted. Although the Asian Development Bank (ADB) finances a portion of the section \nof about 210 kilometers (km), the remainder of the section will be constructed in parallel using \nother financing sources. This is considered reasonable as the benefits are mainly expected to \nbe accrued to the generated and induced traffic with the completion of the overall section. The \nanalysis  used  the  highway  design  and  maintenance  model  (HDM4)  with  modification  for \nconditions  in  Afghanistan.  Data  under  the  same  conditions  in  neighboring  countries  were \nadopted for unavailable input data. Economic evaluation was made by comparing two cases of \nwith and without the Project. The case without the Project reflects the current practice of doing-\nnothing but keeping passability at the existing level. \n \n2.  The project road was evaluated up to and including 2027, providing a benefit period of \n20 years. A residual value of 10% was applied in 2027. The improved road will reduce operating \ncosts and travel time, which will lead to a stimulus in economic growth in the project area. All \nbenefits and costs are expressed in 2004 constant prices. \n \nB.  Road Conditions \n \n3.  Homogeneous sections are defined based on traffic volumes derived from the traffic \nanalysis, road geometry, and roughness observed during the surveys, and altitude and gradient \nof the road.

Economic Assessment \n \n1.  Costs \n \n7.  The Project\u2019s economic costs are derived from the financial costs and include the cost \nfor construction and maintenance costs. Economic costs exclude price contingencies, taxes, \nand  duties.  Taxes  and  duties  in  Afghanistan  are  virtually  zero  at  present.  Following  the \nEmergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project, a factor of 0.9 was used to \nconvert financial rehabilitation and maintenance costs to economic costs. \n \n8.

Benefits \n \n9.  The main quantifiable benefits of the investment are (i) the savings in vehicle operating \ncosts and (ii) savings in travel time. Vehicle operating cost savings were calculated using HDM4 \nfor each vehicle type. Following the Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Reconstruction \nProject, value of time per vehicle is estimated at $0.38 plus $0.13 per passengers, and $0.50 \nper truck plus $0.25 per passenger. The benefits for generated traffic are considered to be 50% \nof those for the normal traffic. \n \n3.   Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n10.  An  economic  evaluation  was  undertaken  by  section  for  the  three  alternatives.  The \nmaintenance standard for the do-nothing case is spot-gravelling every year to keep the surface \ncondition at the minimum level of SPELL (IRI) = 15. For the with project case, overlay is \nconduced when the surface roughness of the road reaches IRI 5 m/km for alternatives 2 and 3. \nFor alternative 1, overlay is conducted when the roughness reaches IRI 9 m/km. \n \n11.

Distribution Analysis \n \n13.  A  study  on  transport  industry  was  conducted  for  the  Kabul-Kandahar  section.  The \nfollowing is the assessment based on this study. A follow-up study is currently being undertaken \nand the assessment will be updated with use of the follow-up study. \n \n14.  Regarding competition among individual firms in the freight sector, a significant degree \nof competition is available for the hauling business. Research indicates that a significant drop in \nfreight rates was realized for World Food Program freight over 6 months. The freight forwarding \ncompany takes a percentage (5\u201310%) of the contract price, passing the rest on to the driver.  \n \n15.  In the passenger transport sector, competition is relatively less. Bus drivers pay a fee to \nthe cooperative for one passenger fare for the larger buses and 60% of one fare for taxi and \nsmaller buses. It was not clear whether this requirement was enforced by the Ministry of \nTransport or by the leadership of the cooperative and whether the collectives have records of \nthe accounts. A fixed rotation system is used; the driver is given a number and must wait for all \nof the drivers holding prior numbers to get a load of passengers before he becomes eligible for \na trip. This fixed rotation prevents individual operators from competing with one another on \neither price or service. Because of this limit to competition, price of passenger transport could \nbe held above the open competition price. The Ministry of Transport also intervenes in this \nmarket by setting an official passenger tariff. Normally passenger transporters must pay 0.2% of \ntheir combined passenger fares at their first Ministry of Transport fee collection. However, tariff \ncollection is not very standardized, which is an important weakness in the system. \n \n16.  Based on the assessment of the project area, the poverty impact ratio for the overall \nProject is estimated to be 0.69. This high level indicates that the poor will receive a high \nproportion of benefits. Detailed analysis is in Supplementary Appendix A.

The Project is categorized as a \u201cB\u201d Project in accordance with the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) Guidelines on Environmental Assessment. An initial environmental examination \n(IEE) was prepared. This appendix is based on the information in the IEE and summary IEE \nreports undertaken under the project preparatory technical assistance1 on behalf of the Ministry \nof Public Works.  \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n2.  The Andkhoy-Qaisar road is a segment of the ring road, which connects the major cities \nof Afghanistan. The Project will involve (i) reconstruction and improvement of a 210 kilometer \n(km) road section; (ii) improvement of about 10 river crossings on the 210 km stretch; and (iii) \nprovision of markings, signs, and other safety features. The improvement and reconstruction of \nthe road aims to achieve a design standard with the following typical cross section: (i) in flat and \nrolling terrain:, two traffic lanes each 3.5 meters (m) wide, with two hard shoulders each 1.5 m \nwide each, and two verges 0.5 m wide, with a total width of 11.0 m; and (ii) in mountainous \nterrain: the same traffic lanes with hard shoulders reduced to 0.5 m, with a total width of 8.0 m. \n  \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n3.  The Project is administratively located within Faryab. The environmental condition of the \nproject area along the road is briefly summarized here. \n \n1.  Physical Environment \n \n4.  The road passes through different topography from north to southwest. From Andkhoy to \nDaulatabad (61 km), the terrain is an open plain with gentle slope. The elevation of this area \nranges from 320 to 400 m above sea level. The open plain continues along the Shirin Tagab \nRiver up to a point 113 km away from Andkhoy, at an elevation of 750 m. Thereafter a short \nsection of hilly terrain continues to Maimana (129 km from Andkhoy at an elevation of 866 m). \nAfter Maimana, the terrain becomes gentle and elevations stay between 840 and 940 m except \nthe last 23 km to Qaisar. After Qaisar (187 km from Andkhoy at an elevation of 1,340 m), the \nproject road runs along the Qaisar River and ends at a point before a small settlement called \nKhazara Qala (210 km from Andkhoy) in Qaisar District.  \n \n2.  Ecological Environment \n \n5.  Only 4% of Afghanistan is forested, mostly in the east and southeast. The deciduous \nforests have almost completely disappeared, as have almost 95% of the juniper forests. The \nvegetation along the corridor of the project road is primarily semidesert, which mainly consists of \nresistant grasses, various shrubs such as tamarisk, and sand acacia. The irrigated areas are \nmostly planted with grains, wheat, and other crops. Orchards and vineyards are common in the \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Preparing the Herat-Andkhoy Road Project. Manila. The IEE report was prepared for 553 km road, but \nADB\u2019s project will cover road improvement of the first 210 km from Andkhoy . Therefore, this summary focuses only \non the area covered by the proposed ADB\u2019s project.   \n \n ", "      Appendix 13  55\nvillages.  Wheat;  barley;  corn;  potatoes;  vegetables;  and  fruits  such  as  grape,  melon,  and \nwatermelon, dominate the vegetation in the villages along the existing road. In the valley, acacia \nand  pistachio  plantations  are  commonly  found.  However,  the  project  area  has  no  special \nspecies to be considered for preservation.  \n \n6.  With regard to the fauna in the project area, several domestic animals such as camels, \nhorses, donkey, cows, buffalo, sheep, and goats, as well as dogs used as shepherds were \nidentified. Several types of birds are found in the project area.   \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n7.  The environmental impacts associated with the construction stage include (i) disruption \nof traffic in the construction area, (ii) increased air pollution due to increasing dust and other \nvolatile chemical substances from the asphalt plant, (iii) noise and vibration, (iv) disruption of the \nwater system due to construction of bridges and other earth work particularly in the valley areas, \nand (v) potential landslides associated with elevating some part of the road. These impacts will \nall occur only during the construction period. Mitigation measures to minimize these impacts \ninclude (i) rerouting traffic with clear signs; (ii) maintaining optimum moisture content during soil \nhandling, spraying water to minimize dust, and maintaining a safe distance between the asphalt \nplant and public facilities including education facilities; (iii) strictly controlling construction works \nthat create noise and vibration by prohibiting night work in residential areas; (iv) locating the hot-\nmix and crusher plants at least 1 km from residential areas; (v) pumping stagnant water, and \nproviding adequate drainage system; and (vi) stabilizing road embankment side slopes. These \nmeasures will be included in the contract document for the civil works. These impacts are all \ntemporary and manageable. \n \n8.  Camps for construction works will be established in areas that are not prone to social \nconflicts. The camps will need to be complete with adequate sanitation facilities and waste \nmanagement  to  avoid  disturbance  to  the  communities.  Construction  materials  that  contain \nhazardous and toxic substances such as petroleum, and asphalt should be stored in proper \nplaces and managed in accordance with the relevant international standards.   \n \n9.  The environmental impact associated with the operation of the Project is mainly on traffic \nsafety, therefore, adequate traffic signs and physical barriers to reduce motorist speed must be \nprovided . This measure needs to be strictly enforced particularly in villages and towns along the \nroad corridor, where markets usually take place.  \n  \nE.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n \n10.  Institutional Framework and Responsibility. Implementation of mitigation measures \nduring construction will be the responsibility of the contractor. An environmental engineer, who \nwill be hired as part of the consultant team to implement the Project, will help the Ministry of \nPublic Work (MPW) prepare contractual documentation so that the bidding documents, bills of \nquantity,  and  other  contractual  obligations  of  the  contractor  clearly  identify  environmental \nresponsibilities  and  describe  penalties  for  noncompliance.  MPW  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing overall environmental monitoring and management as part of the IEE. \n \n11.  Environmental  Monitoring  and  Management  Plan.  The IEE identified the generic \nmonitoring and management program, which will be part of mitigating adverse impacts. Annual \nreports in implementing the monitoring and management plan will be submitted to ADB and \nother relevant Government agencies. ", "56 Appendix 13 \nF.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n12.  The  IEE  study  shows  that  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  Project  are \nmanageable and can be mitigated. Therefore, a full environmental impact assessment to assess \nfurther impacts of roads involved in this Project is not required.  \n \nG.   Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n \n13.  Public consultation during the preparation of the IEE was done in a very informal manner \nwith the population living along the road project. In general, consulted communities did not show \nany objection to the proposed improvement, and did not have any particular concerns about the \npotential  impacts  associated  with  the  Project.  Therefore,  MPW  should  carry  out  a  public \nconsultation during project implementation, particularly prior to the start of the construction. \n \nH.   Conclusion \n \n14.  The Project will improve existing roads. The overall IEE finding is that the Project will not \ncause  significant  environmental  problems  and  potential  adverse  impacts  are  manageable. \nHowever, continued monitoring should be carried out. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20041222141252+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20041129163426+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R267-04", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}, "author_page": "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 31 October 2004) \n \nCurrency Unit \u2013  afghani/s (AF) \n \nAF1.00 =  $0.0219 \n$1.00 =  AF45.70 \n \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \nADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \nADF  \u2013  Asian Development Fund \nAIDS  \u2013  acquired immunodeficiency syndrome  \nARDS  \u2013  Afghanistan Reconstruction and Development Services \nEIRRP  \u2013  Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and \nReconstruction Project \nHIV  \u2013  human immunodeficiency virus  \nICB  \u2013  international competitive bidding \nIEE  \u2013  initial environmental examination  \nMOT  \u2013  Ministry of Transport \nMPW  \u2013  Ministry of Public Works \nPMU  \u2013  project management unit \nPRR    priority reform and restructuring \nTA  \u2013  technical assistance  \nUN  \u2013  United Nations \n \n \nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES \nkm  \u2013  kilometer \nkm2  \u2013  square kilometer \nm  \u2013  meter \n \n \n \nNOTE \n \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis report was prepared by a team consisting of H.
