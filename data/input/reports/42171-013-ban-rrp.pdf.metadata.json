The  report  also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Supporting the Khulna Water Supply Project, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, will approve the TA.1\n \n \nThe  project  will  develop  a  sustainable  water  supply  system  in  Khulna  city,  which  relies \n2. \nentirely on groundwater.2\n It will introduce surface water as the main water source for sustainable \nwater resource management in Khulna city. The project adopts a climate-proof design, adapting \nto  an  expected  increase  in  the  salinity  of  the  river  water  as  a  result  of  sea  level  rise.  The \nproject\u2019s capacity building component will also strengthen the corporate management system of \nKhulna  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Authority  (KWASA),  which  has  been  established  in \nFebruary 2008.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale   \n\n3. \nWater  supply  in  Khulna  city.  Citizens in Khulna city have been suffering from limited \naccess  to  water  supply  services.  Only  23%  of  the  population  of  about  1  million  has  access  to \npiped water supply, and the rest resorts to alternative sources, such as shared public taps and \ntube  wells  built  privately.  The  existing  system  is  old  and  poorly  maintained,  resulting  in \nsubstantial leakage and low quality of water.3 A survey shows that even households connected \nto  the  piped  network  enjoy  only  intermittent  water  supply  (5.3  hours  per  day),  and  74%  of \nhouseholds  find  the  supplied  quantity  insufficient.4 As  for  water  quality,  59%  of  the  surveyed \nhouseholds perceived the supplied water to be dirty and 55% rated the service standards very \npoor  or  poor.5\n Many  unconnected  households  rely  on  shared  public  taps  and  spend  a  daily \naverage  of  90  minutes  fetching  water,  imposing  a  particular  burden  on  women  who  tend  to \nmanage water for the whole family. The project will expand the access to water supply services \nby building a surface water treatment plant and extending the distribution network to cover the \nwhole city.  \n \n4. \nWater  resource  management.  Khulna  city  relies  entirely  on  groundwater  for  its  water \nsource.6 KWASA\u2019s deep tube wells yield 30,100 cubic meters (m3) per day, supplying water to \nthe  piped  network.  In  addition,  there  are  many  privately  built  tube  wells  and  KWASA\u2019s  hand-\npumped  tube  wells;  the  total  abstraction  of  groundwater  is  estimated  at  113,000  m3/day.  An \nassessment  of  the  groundwater  showed  that  abstraction  should  be  limited  to  ensure  the \nsustainability  of  the  groundwater  resource.  The  project  will  develop  a  surface  water  treatment \nplant  with  110,000  m3/day  capacity  to  meet  the  growing  demand  without  increasing  the \ngroundwater abstraction and undermining its sustainability.7\n The groundwater will be monitored \nand  managed  in  a  sustainable  manner.  In  addition  to  KWASA\u2019s  wells,  private  wells  will  be \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  TA:  ADB.  2009.

Manila. \n\n3  Physical loss is estimated at 36% of the produced water. \n4  The  survey  was  conducted  under  ADB.  2008.  Small  Scale  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People's  Republic  of \nBangladesh for Supporting the Establishment of Khulna Water and Sewerage Authority. Manila. The survey covers \n3,000 households randomly selected in Khulna city.  \n\n5  Service standards were rated fair by 33% of the surveyed households and good by 11%.  \n6  Arsenic contamination is not found in Khulna city. \n7  The groundwater table is declining by 2\u20133 meters annually in some areas in Dhaka because of overextraction.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nregistered to monitor and regulate the abstraction of groundwater. Groundwater and surface water \nwill be used conjunctively to ensure environmentally sustainable and economically efficient water \nresource management. \n \nClimate change impacts. Khulna city is located in the coastal belt of Bangladesh\u2014one \n5. \nof  the  most  vulnerable  areas  to  climate  change  impacts.  Rivers  near  Khulna  city  are  already \naffected  by  salinity  intrusion,  and  the  sea  level  rise  caused  by  climate  change  is  expected  to \nexacerbate  the  problem  of  salinity  intrusion.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  conducted  a \nstudy to simulate climate change impacts in Khulna city and develop adaptation strategies.8\n The \nresults of the study are incorporated in the project design to make the project climate-proof. In \nparticular, the intake facilities will be located upriver to avoid salinity, and an impounding reservoir \nwill  be  built  to  store  fresh  water  so  that  water  quality  will  be  ensured  even  with  the  expected \nincrease of salinity in the river water.  \n \n6. \nEstablishing and strengthening the Khulna Water Supply and Sewerage Authority. \nThe  Government  of  Bangladesh  established  KWASA  in  February  2008.9\n KWASA  is  the  third \nwater  supply  and  sewerage  authority  established  in  the  country,  following  the  Dhaka  and \nChittagong  water  supply  and  sewerage  authorities.  Khulna  City  Corporation  was  directly \nresponsible  for  water  supply  service  in  Khulna  city  before  the  establishment  of  KWASA. \nAlthough  KWASA  has  been  legally  established, further  efforts  are  required to  develop  it  into  a \ncapable  water  utility  with  a  proper  management  system,  competent  human  resources,  and  a \nsound  financial  management  system.  As  KWASA  is  a  recently  established  organization  with \nnew  personnel  and  systems,  it  is  opportune  to  provide  adequate  support  to  develop  it  into  a \nfinancially viable water utility that can serve as a model in Bangladesh.  \n \n7. \nDevelopment  coordination.  The  project  was  developed  through  dialogue  among \ndevelopment  partners  at  the  local  consultative  group  for  the  water  and  sanitation  sector,  and \nunder  the  partnership  framework  for  urban  water  supply  and  sanitation.10\n The  project  will  be \ncofinanced by ADB and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) under a harmonized \nand  unified  framework.  One  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing  the  entire  project,  regardless  of  the  funding  source.  ADB  and  JICA  will  jointly \nreview the project implementation as well as KWASA\u2019s corporate management against common \nperformance indicators.  \n \n8. \nfrom  previous \ninterventions.  For  example,  a  recent  sector  program  assistance  evaluation  concluded  that \ncofinancing  is  a  good  option  to  scale  up  investment  in  urban  water  supply  projects  in \nBangladesh; this is proposed in the project.11 Other lessons from past water supply projects in \nBangladesh  identified  careful  tariff  setting  and  financial  management  as  vital  for  project \nsustainability.12\n KWASA\u2019s financial condition was thoroughly assessed and a financial plan was \nprepared to ensure long-term sustainability. \n \n9. \nand  program for  Bangladesh,  2006\u20132010.13\n                                                \n8  ADB.  2010.

The  project  will  directly  contribute  to  the  sector \noutcome  by  expanding  access  to  clean  drinking  water  in  Khulna  city.  The  project  will  also \ncontribute  to  Millennium  Development  Goal  7  through  the  expansion  of  access  to  safe  water. \nThe  project  will  complement  the  planned  improvement  of  drainage  under  the  City  Region \nDevelopment  Project 14  and  of  solid  waste  management  under  the  Urban  Public  and \nEnvironmental  Health  Sector  Development  Program 15\n for  a  better  urban  environment.  The \nproject is also in line with the government\u2019s draft Sector Development Plan, 2011\u20132025, which \nhas identified significant financing gap in the water supply sector, and has identified this sector \nas a priority for investments.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  of the  project  will  be  improved  urban  services  in  Khulna  city.  The  outcome \n\n10. \nwill be expanded and reliable access to potable water in Khulna city.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs    \n\n11. \nThe outputs of the project will be (i) augmented and sustainably managed water sources \nin Khulna city, (ii) an extended and efficiently managed distribution network in Khulna city, and  \n(iii) professional and sustainable corporate management of KWASA. The activities under (i) will \nbe mostly financed by JICA, and those under (ii) and (iii) will be financed by ADB.  \n \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Augmented and Sustainably Managed Water Sources  \n\n12. \nThe water sources in Khulna city will be augmented and managed sustainably under the \nproject.  The  project  will  develop  a  surface  water  treatment  plant  to  meet  the  growing  demand \nand  avoid  excessive  abstraction  of  groundwater.  Groundwater  and  surface  water  will  be  used \nconjunctively  to  ensure  environmentally  sustainable  and  economically  efficient  water  resource \nmanagement.  Groundwater  will  be  monitored  and  assessed  regularly,  and  abstraction  will  be \nlimited to a sustainable level.  \n \nRivers  near  Khulna  city  are  already  affected  by  salinity  intrusion,  which  is  expected  to \n13. \nworsen as a result of climate change. Locating the intake upriver will reduce the salinity level of \nraw water, though it will increase the cost of water transmission to Khulna city. The intake point \nhas been identified by considering the future salinity level and the costs of water transmission. \nAt the selected intake point, it is expected that the chloride concentration level  will exceed the \ngovernment  standard  in  the  dry  season  only  for  a  limited  period.  16 Water  with  low  chloride \nconcentration  will  be  collected during the  rainy  season  and  stored  in  an  impounding reservoir. \nWater with high chloride concentration collected during the dry season will be diluted, with the \nwater stored in the impounding reservoir to meet the government standard.17\n  \n\n                                                \n14 ADB.  2010.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the City Region Development Project. Manila. \n\n15 ADB.  2009.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Urban  Public  and  Environmental  Health  Sector  Development  Program. \nManila. \n\n16 The  government  standard  is  1,000  milligrams/liter  (mg/l)  based  on  the  government\u2019s  Environment  Conservation \nRules, 1997. Khulna is classified a coastal area, where 1,000 mg/l is the threshold. The threshold for other areas is \n600 mg/l.  \n\n17 The  size  of  the  impounding  reservoir  depends  on  the  period  of  dry  season  when  the  raw  water  exceeds  the \ngovernment\u2019s standard on chloride concentration. Uncertainties exist about future water quality because of climate \nchange impacts and a dredging project in upriver from the intake. KWASA will keep monitoring water quality and \n\n\f4 \n\n \n14. \nThe groundwater will be used as a supplementary source of water. It will be monitored \nand  assessed  regularly,  and  abstraction  from  KWASA\u2019s  tube  wells  will  be  limited  to  a  certain \nlevel. Private wells will be registered to monitor and regulate the abstraction.18\n The total amount \nof groundwater abstraction will be contained to a sustainable level, taking into consideration the \nlimited increase of abstraction from KWASA\u2019s tube wells and switching of private well users to \nKWASA\u2019s  piped  network.  Treated  water  from  the  surface  treatment  plant  will  be  mixed  with \ngroundwater  at  distribution  reservoirs  in  the  city.  Since  the  groundwater  is  not  affected  by \nsalinity, it will provide a further buffer during unexpectedly long dry seasons and a high salinity \nlevel  in  raw  water.  Activities  under  output  1  will  include  the  construction  of  intake  facilities,  a \nsurface  water  treatment  plant,  an  impounding  reservoir,  and  a  raw  water  transmission  main, \nwhich  will  be  financed  by  JICA;  and  rehabilitation  of  deep  tube  wells  and  monitoring  of \ngroundwater, which will be financed by ADB.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput 2: Extended and Efficiently Managed Distribution Network \n\nThe  water  distribution  system  will  be  extended  and  water  will  be  delivered  efficiently  in \n15. \nKhulna city. The project will improve the access to the piped network from 23% in 2010 to 62% \nby  2018,  benefiting  about  710,000  persons  in  Khulna  city.  An  additional  490,000  persons  will \nhave  a  new  connection  to  the  piped  network,  and  220,000  persons  who  already  have  a \nconnection  will  benefit  from  the  improved  services.  Those  using  hand  pumps  consume  on \naverage  45  liters  per  capita  per  day,  which  will  increase  to  120  liters  per  capita  per  day.  The \npoor,  in  particular,  will  benefit  since  their  residences  tend  to  be  outside  the  current  coverage \nareas and they spend a substantial amount of time each day fetching water. \n \n16. \nThe distribution network will be divided into five zones, and KWASA\u2019s zonal offices will \nbe  established  to  manage  the  network  and  all  customer-related  services.  The  distribution \nnetwork in each zone will be divided into district metering areas. KWASA will rigorously monitor \nthe  amount  of  inflow,  outflow,  and  consumption  in  each  area  and  control  the  pressure  and \nminimize  leaks.  Revenue  collection  will  be  assessed  in  each  zonal  office  to  benchmark  the \nperformance. Water  quality  will  be  regularly  monitored  at  sources  and  through  the  distribution \nnetwork to ensure the delivery of potable water.   \n \n17. \nTo promote quick expansion, house connections will be provided under the project. The \nconnection charges during the project implementation period will be set low to encourage house \nconnections. The low connection charge will help expand the coverage of piped network\u2014even \nfor  poor  households\u2014bringing  down  one  of  the  most  significant  barriers  to  obtain  a  piped \nconnection.  For  In  low-income  communities  where  individual  connection  is  not  a  practical \nsolution,  water  user  groups  will  be  formulated  to  manage  the  communal  tap.  Activities  under \noutput 2 will be financed by ADB and include expansion of the distribution network, construction \nof a clear water transmission main, and establishment of zonal offices.  \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: Professional and Sustainable Corporate Management \n\nThe  project  will  provide  a  range  of  assistance  to  help  develop  a  professional  and \n18. \nsustainable  corporate  management  system  at  KWASA,  which  has  been  recently  established \nwith  limited  financial  and  human  resources.  KWASA  has  developed  its  first  5-year  business \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \nadjust the size of the impounding reservoir in the future as and when required. The government will acquire lands \nlarger than required for the proposed facilities, if necessary.  \n\n18 An annual charge will be introduced for the use of private wells, as in Dhaka city. \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nplan,  including  a  capital  investment  plan,  financial  plan,  and  human  resource  development \nplan.19\n  \n \n19. \nThe  capital  investments  under  the  project  will  be  the  core  components  of  the  capital \nworks  plan  to  augment water  production  and  extend  service  coverage.  The  capital  works  plan \nalso  includes  smaller  projects  funded  by  the  government,  such  as  rehabilitation  of  deep  tube \nwells  and  extension  of  the  distribution  network,  which  can  be  implemented  quickly  and \ncomplement the project.  \n \nCurrent  KWASA  financial  conditions  are  weak  because  of  the  small  customer  base20 \n20. \nand low tariff levels.21 The financial plan covers a series of revenue enhancement measures, in \naddition to the natural revenue increase caused by the expansion of service coverage. KWASA \ncurrently  charges flat  monthly  rates for  each  connection,  which  will  be  converted  to  a  monthly \ncharge  to  each  household.  KWASA  has  identified  the  existing  illegal  connections  and  started \nregistering  them  as  legal  connections.  Domestic  meters  will  be  gradually  installed  and  a \nvolumetric tariff will be introduced for each category of customers.22\n  \n \n21. \nSince KWASA\u2019s operation will be far larger than the current one, the project will provide \ncomprehensive  support  for  human  resource  development,  including  gradual  expansion  and \nadjustment of the organizational structure, and training of recruited staff and management. The \ntraining  program  will  include  financial  management,  customer  services,  procurement,  and \nsafeguard  compliance.  KWASA\u2019s  human  resources  will  expand  in  accordance  with  the \nexpansion of operation, and will be decentralized through the establishment of zonal offices to \nfocus  on  customer  service.  Activities  under  output  3  will  be  financed  by  ADB  and  will  include \ncapacity  development  programs  and  consulting  services  for  KWASA\u2019s  corporate  management \nsystem. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n \n22. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $363.5  million,  including  land  acquisition,  incremental \nrecurrent  costs,  and  taxes  and  duties.  Land  acquisition  and  taxes  and  duties  will  be  financed \nentirely  by  the  government.  Resettlement  costs,  other  than  land  acquisition  and  asset \ncompensation  cost,  are  eligible  for  ADB  financing.  The  investment  plan  is  summarized  in \nTable 1 and described in detail in the project administration manual.23\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n                                                \n19 Summary of KWASA Business Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20  Currently only 23% of the city population is connected to KWASA\u2019s piped network. \n21  Most customers pay Tk45\u2013Tk70 per connection per month, depending on the connection pipe diameter. \n22  Meter  coverage  will  increase  from  0%  (FY2010)  to  20%  (FY2013)  and  40%  (FY2016).  The  coverage  will  reach \n100%  in  FY2017,  and  then  the  volumetric  tariff  will  be  introduced.  The  volumetric  tariff  will  be  differentiated  for \ncommercial  and  industrial  customers.  Increasing  block  tariff  is  not  planned since  it  may  not  bring  the  anticipated \npro-poor  effects  in  Khulna.  Multiple  households  under  one  connection,  which  are  common  in  low-income  areas, \nmay end up in a high-consumption block with a higher rate. \n\n23  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f6 \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nItem \nA. \n\nCivil works and equipment \nConsultants \nLand acquisition and resettlement \nAdministration costs \n\n \nBase Costa \n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \nContingenciesb \nB. \nInterest Charges During Implementationc \nC. \nTaxes and Duties \nD. \n        Totald  \n  \n \na  In mid-2010 prices. \nb  Physical contingencies computed at 4.9%.

The TA is estimated to cost $800,000 equivalent, of which $700,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV) and $100,000 will be \nprovided by the government through in-kind contribution. The TA will focus on priority areas of \nplanning and technical support, such as metering of house connections, public communication, \ninformation technology, and procurement capacity. The outline terms of reference are included \nin the project administration manual (footnote 23). KWASA will be the executing agency for the \nTA and will provide counterpart staff and office space. Individual consultants will be engaged to \nimplement the TA.   \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n29. \nEconomic analysis. The estimated economic internal rate of return is 13.6%, indicating \na sufficiently high economic return. The result is robust against downside risks, including higher \ncosts  and  decreased  benefits.  Quantified  project  benefits  include  incremental  consumption  of \nwater  (valued  at  the  willingness  to  pay)  and  non-incremental  consumption  of  water  (valued  at \nresource  cost  savings).  The  result  most  likely  underestimates  the  project  benefits,  since  the \n\n\f8 \n\nFinancial  analysis.  The  estimated  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  \u20132.7%  (below  the \n\nproject has other benefits (such as improvement of health) that are not easily quantifiable and \nare not accounted for in the analysis. Details are provided in the economic analysis.24\n  \n \n30. \nweighted average cost of capital estimated at 0.4%). The results reflect the low level of planned   \ntariff, which is determined based on the assessment of willingness to pay and affordability. The \nprojected  cash  flow  of  KWASA  shows  that  adequate  funds  will  be  available  for  operation  and \nmaintenance  expenditures  and  debt  service,  even  with  the  low  tariff  level,  because  of \nconcessional terms of relending by the government to KWASA.25 KWASA will fully recover the \noperation  and  maintenance  costs  and  partly  recover  the  capital  costs  in  line  with  government \npolicy.26 Details are provided in the financial analysis.27\n \n\n \nGovernance \n\nB. \n\n31. \nKWASA  does  not  have  extensive  experience  in  managing  large  externally  funded \nprojects. Based on assessments of KWASA\u2019s current capacity, the project will provide adequate \ntraining  and  support  through  consulting  services  for  financial  management,  procurement,  and \nsafeguard measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand  discussed  with  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 23) and are included in \nthe loan agreement of ADB. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nServices  for  the  poor. Low-income  households  are mostly  excluded from  the  existing \n32. \npiped  water  supply.  The  major  impediment  to  improved  water  services  for  the  poor  will  be \naffordability  of  the  connection  costs.  The  project  will  provide  household  connections  with  low \nconnection  charges  to  promote  individual  connections  even  for  the  poor. 28\n In  low-income \ncommunities  where  individual  connection  is  not  a  practical  solution,  water  user  groups  will  be \nformulated to manage the communal tap. The taps will be metered and KWASA will collect the \nbill through a caretaker of the tap chosen by the respective user groups. To enhance awareness \non  public  hygiene  and  acceptability  of  the  tariff  adjustment,  a  series  of  public  awareness \ncampaign activities will be implemented with the support of consultants. \n \n33. \nGender.  Expanding  coverage  of  piped  water  supply  will  benefit  women,  since  the \nburden  to  fetch  water  for  the  family  usually  falls  on  women.  A  gender  action  plan  has  been \ndeveloped.  Awareness-raising  campaigns  will  particularly  target  women,  since  they  are  the \nprimary caretakers of household health. Women will be encouraged to play a major role in water \nuser  groups  in  low-income  communities.  Women  will  have  equal  opportunity  to  participate  in \n\n                                                \n24 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25  Except  during  the  initial  years  of  establishment,  KWASA  will  not  obtain  explicit  subsidies.  The  concessional \n\nrelending will help KWASA to maintain a positive cash flow. \n\n26 The government policy emphasizes operation and maintenance cost recovery, and full recovery of capital was set \nas  the  eventual  goal.  Government  of  Bangladesh.1988.  National  Policy  for  Safe  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation \n(8.3.2)  states:  \u201cIn  the  near  future  water  tariff  shall  be  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  cost  of  water  production, \noperation  and  maintenance,  administration  and  depreciation.\u201d  Government  of  Bangladesh.  2006.  Sector \nDevelopment Programme: Water and Sanitation Sector (page 34) states \u201c\u2026 stresses the need for increasing water \ntariff  in  urban  areas  to  at  least  cover  the  operation  and  maintenance  costs\u201d  and  \u201cHowever,  water  being  a  social \ngood, the transition to full cost-recovery should be gradual\u201d \n\n27 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28  The  connections  will  be  provided  as  part  of  the  project  with  a  charge  lower  than  the  actual  cost  during  project \nimplementation.  KWASA  plans  to  charge  the  actual  cost  after  project completion,  which  will  be  further assessed \nbased on the progress of coverage expansion and financial conditions.  \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nproject-supported training programs and recruitment. Efforts to reduce wage inequality between \nmen and women and to ensure core labor standards will be in place.  \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nD. \n\nEnvironmental  safeguards.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  in  accordance  with \n34. \ninitial  environmental \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  KWASA  prepared  an \nexamination  (IEE) 29\n as  part  of  the  feasibility  study,  including  an  environmental  management \nplan  (EMP).  The  IEE  concluded  that  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  are \nanticipated  and  that  the project  will  have  only  small,  localized  impacts  to  be mitigated through \nmeasures  outlined  in  the  EMP.  The  IEE  and  EMP  will  be  updated  during  detailed  design  as \nnecessary. The EMP will be incorporated into bidding and contract documents and implemented \nby contractors and consultants; the PMU will monitor the EMP. The PMU will be provided with \nconsultancy  and  capacity  building  in  managing  the  environmental  impacts.  KWASA  will  be \nresponsible for implementing the EMP and will report the progress to ADB. The IEE represents \na  single,  unified  document  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  rules  and  guidelines  of  ADB,  JICA, \nand  the  government;  and  will  be  implemented  as  a  single  process  regardless  of  the  funding \nsource.  KWASA  plans  to  develop  wastewater  treatment  facilities  in  the  medium  term  to  meet \nexpected increase in water usage. \n \nSocial safeguards. The project is classified category A for involuntary resettlement and \n35. \ncategory C for indigenous people in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \nA  total  of  29.6  hectares  of  private  land  will  be  acquired  under  the  project.  Properties  to  be \nacquired are primarily agricultural lands or lowland fishing ponds without residential structures. \nThe  resettlement  impacts  are  therefore  limited  to  economic  displacement  and  no  physical \ndisplacement  from  housing  will  occur.  Involuntary  resettlement  impacts  are  considered \nsignificant  as  more  than  200  persons  are  expected  to  experience  major  impacts. 30 KWASA \nprepared  a  resettlement  plan 31\n that  specifies  entitlements  for  affected  persons  including \ncompensation  at  replacement  cost,  livelihood  restoration  measures,  and  special  assistance \nmeasures for vulnerable groups. The resettlement plan represents a single, unified document to \nensure compliance with the rules and guidelines of ADB, JICA, and the government; and will be \nimplemented as a single process regardless of the funding sources. The government is strongly \ncommitted  to  implementing  the  resettlement  plan.  At  present,  the  capacity  on  safeguards \nplanning  and  implementation  at  KWASA  is  not  strong.  Consultants  recruited  under  the \nassociated capacity development TA will provide capacity building and other support to ensure \neffective implementation of safeguard measures.   \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n36.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  below.  Risks  are  mitigated  to  a \nmanageable level. The benefits and impacts of the project are expected to outweigh the costs \nand risks. \n \n\n                                                \n29 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Major  impacts  are  defined  as  losing  10%  or  more  of  their  productive  assets  (income  generating).  It  is  estimated \nthat  the  economically  displaced  persons  include  110  legal  title  holders  (490  persons)  and  15  non-titled  holders \n(69 economically displaced persons), among which 309 persons are expected to have major impacts. \n\n31 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f10 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nInadequate capacity of \nKWASA to manage the \nproject  \n\nMitigating Measures \nKWASA  recently  recruited  a  group  of  managers  and  engineers.  KWASA  prepared  the \nhuman resource development plan and the project will support KWASA in recruitment and \ntraining.  \n\nFinancial sustainability \nof KWASA \n\nKWASA  prepared  a  financial  plan,  confirming  positive  cash  flow  after  operation  and \nmaintenance  cost  and  debt  service.  Measures  to  enhance  revenues  will  be  introduced, \nincluding volumetric tariff and charge on private wells.  \n\nLand acquisition and \nresettlement   \n\nThe  resettlement  plan  has  been  carefully  prepared  and  adequate  resources  are \nprovisioned,  including  consultants  and  compensation.  Consultation  started  with  local \nleaders  and  communities,  which  will  continue  with  consultants\u2019  support  during \nimplementation.  \n\nIncreased salinity level \nof the river water  \n\nThe impounding reservoir will store the water during rainy season when the salinity level is \nlow, and dilute the saline raw water in dry season. Groundwater, which contains much less \nsalinity even in the dry season, will remain as a secondary water source and will be used to \ndilute the saline water.  \n\nKWASA = Khulna Water Supply and Sewerage Authority. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe government and KWASA have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \n37. \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  the \nproject administration manual (footnote 23) and loan documents.
