An  environmental  impact  assessment  was completed  and \nthe summary was circulated to the Board on 29 April 2005. \n \nThe  Project  is  located  in  the  western  part  of  Henan  province  and \nsoutheastern  part  of  Shaanxi  province,  a  relatively  poor  area.  The \nProject  is  designed  to  promote  sustainable  economic  growth  by \nconstructing  459  kilometers  (km)  of  railway  line  from  Zhengzhou  in \nHenan  to  Xi\u2019an  in  Shaanxi.  The  Project  will  develop  an  efficient,  safe, \nand environmentally sustainable railway transport system in the region; \nand  facilitate  creation  of  additional  employment  and  income-generating \nopportunities, thus benefiting poor residents.  \n \nThe Project reflects the ADB railway sector operational strategy for the \nPRC,  which \nrailway  network  constraints  and \npromoting  sustainable  economic  growth  in  poor  areas  not  served  by \nrailways.  The  Project  is  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  western \ndevelopment  strategy  to  provide  less-developed  regions  with  better \ninfrastructure  to  facilitate  economic  growth,  thereby  increasing  the \nopportunity for people to improve their living standards.  \n \nThe  interior  regions  of  the  PRC  have  not  benefited  as  much  from \neconomic  growth  and  reforms  as  the  east  coast;  in  fact,  the  gap  in \neconomic and social development has increased. Transport constraints \nand high logistics costs are two factors contributing to regional economic \ndisparities,  and  two  of  the  constraints  preventing  the  western  region \nfrom capitalizing on its comparative advantages. \n \nThe  Project  is  one  of  the  eight  passenger-dedicated  corridors  to  be \ndeveloped  by  2020.  The  proposed  alignment  for  the  Zhengzhou\u2013Xi\u2019an \nrailway  (ZXR)  is  50  km  shorter  than  the  existing  Longhai  railway  line. \nTraversing  Henan  and  Shaanxi,  the  proposed  railway  line  will  connect \nwith  Beijing\u2013Guangzhou,  Shanghai\u2013Xuzhou,  and  Beijing\u2013Wuhan  main \nlines  on  the  east  and  Xi\u2019an\u2013Baoji\u2013Lanzhou,  Xi\u2019an\u2013Baoji\u2013Chengdu, \nXi\u2019an\u2013Ankang,  and  Xi\u2019an\u2013Yan\u2019an  main  lines  on  the  west.  This  is  the \nmain  east-west  corridor  linking  Beijing,  Shanghai,  Lianyungang,  and \nother major cities and ports in the east, to Xi\u2019an, Baoji, Lanzhou, Urumqi, \nChengdu,  Chongqing,  in  the  west.  The  Project  will  also  help  promote \nregional  cooperation  as  this  is  the  main  east-west  corridor  linking  the \nPRC to Central Asia and Europe. \n \nThe  Project,  a  joint-venture  railway  between  the  Ministry  of  Railways \n\nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject \nDescription \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n \n \n \nFinancing Plan \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nLoan Amount \nand Terms \n\n(MOR)  and  Henan  and  Shaanxi  provincial  governments  (HPG  and \nSPG),  will  have  substantial  managerial  and  financial  autonomy.  The \nProject will contribute to changing railway enterprises from cost centers \nin  a  planned  economy  to  profit  centers  in  an  increasingly  competitive \ntransport  market.  The  components  are  formulated  in  line  with  MOR\u2019s \n2004 Railway Development Plan. \n \nThe  Project  will  remove  a  transport  constraint  to  sustainable  economic \ngrowth. Providing economic railway transportation in the unserved, less-\ndeveloped,  and  poor  areas  will  help  create  conditions  necessary  for \ndeveloping  local  resources  and  generating  employment  and  income-\nenhancing opportunities to raise living standards in the project area.  \n \nProject  preparation \ninvolved  participatory  processes.  Extensive \nconsultations were held with all the main stakeholders, including various \naffected people, potential beneficiaries, village leaders, women\u2019s groups, \nlocal  ethnic  bureaus,  and  local  governments  in  the  project  area. \nHousehold surveys were carried out, and participatory workshops were \norganized  in  the  project  area  to  understand  public  opinion  about  the \nProject,  and  to  provide  inputs  for  the  social  and  environmental \nassessments. \n \nThe Project comprises the following components: (i) construction of 459 \nkm  of  double-track  electrified  standard  gauge  class  I  passenger \ndedicated  railway  between  Zhengzhou  and  Xi\u2019an;  (ii)  construction  of  9 \nnew  railway  stations  complete  with  facilities;  (iii)  safety  initiatives, \nincluding provision of modern technology and equipment for enhancing \nsafety; (iv) e-governance and operating dispatch information system; (v) \nprovision of training on the use and maintenance of modern equipment; \n(vi) land acquisition and resettlement; (vii) environmental protection and \nmitigation of adverse environmental effects; (viii) consulting services for \nconstruction supervision, monitoring and evaluation, and marketing and \nbusiness development; and (ix) strengthening of institutional capabilities. \nThe  key  inputs  needed  for  project  implementation  include  civil  works, \nequipment, consultants, and staff of MOR and the Project Company.  \n \nThe  total  project  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $4,131.93 million \nequivalent,  comprising  $1,364.61 million \nforeign  exchange  and \nin \n$2,767.32 million equivalent in local currency. \n \n\n \nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nChina Development Bank \nMOR, HPG, SPG  \nTotal \n\n                                                  ($ million)\nTotal\nCost\n400.00\n1,667.27\n2,064.66\n4,131.93\nPercent \n100.00\nHPG  =  Henan  provincial  government,  MOR  =  Ministry  of  Railways,  SPG  =  Shaanxi \nprovincial government,. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nA  loan  of  $400 million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will  be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \n\nForeign \nExchange\n400.00 \n0.00 \n964.61 \n1,364.61 \n33.00 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n0.00 \n1,667.27 \n1,110.05 \n2,767.32 \n67.00 \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nlending  facility.

Other items will be procured in accordance \nwith government procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \nThe ADB loan will finance 20 person-months of international consulting \nservices  for  (i) strengthening  institutional,  marketing,  and  business \ndevelopment functions of the Project Company; and (ii) researching and \nstrengthening \nthe  development,  operation,  and  management  of \npassenger-dedicated  railway  systems  in  the  PRC.  The  consultants  will \nbe  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.  MOR  will  engage  and  finance  28,000  person-months  of \ninternational  and  domestic  consulting  services  for  project  design, \nconstruction  supervision,  construction  quality  control,  environmental \nsupervision,  procurement,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  of \nthe \nsafeguard  aspects  of  the  Project  in  accordance  with  government \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. \n \nThe  Project  will  (i) provide  the  shortest  land  route  between  Zhengzhou \nand  Xi\u2019an,  key  centers  of  Henan  and  Shaanxi  provinces,  enabling \nrailway  users  to  benefit  from  lower  transport  costs  and  shorter  travel \ndistances  and  times;  (ii) increase  the  corridor\u2019s  capacity,  benefiting \nconsumers  and  producers  of  goods  and  services  through  the  provision \nof  timely  and  efficient  transport  services  and  lower  logistics  costs; \n(iii) generate  direct  and  indirect  employment  in  the  project-influenced \n(the \narea,  and  create \nconstruction  and  operation  of  the  railway  will  employ  much  local \nunskilled labor);  (iv) provide  an  area  that lacked  adequate cost-efficient \ntransportation services with access to broader markets; and (v) stimulate \nlocal  development  through  tourism,  railway  station  area  development, \n\nincome-earning  opportunities \n\njobs  and \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nEstimated \nProject \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting \nAgency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting \nServices \n\nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n \n \n\n \n\nand other infrastructure elements to maximize benefits to local areas.  \n \nThe  increased  tax  revenues  generated  by  the  economic  development \ninduced by the Project will help finance improved social service facilities \nand basic infrastructure. \n \nThe major project beneficiaries will be (i) passengers, including tourists, \nwho will benefit from affordable, faster, and safer trips; (ii) freight users \nwho will switch from the existing road and benefit from more affordable, \nfaster, and safer trips; (iii) local residents who will benefit from the lower \nprices  of  commodities  and  services  transported  by  the  project  railway; \n(iv) local  labor  involved  in  construction  work  and  supply  of  materials \nduring implementation, and in loading/unloading during the operation of \nthe  railway;  (v) local  farmers  who  will  be  able  to  sell  their  products  at \nmarket prices without paying a high margin to a transport intermediary; \n(vi) local  manufacturers  and  traders  who  can  increase  production \ncapacity  or  establish  businesses,  and  will  transport  their  goods  and \nservices  by  the  railway;  and  (vii) local  governments,  which  will  benefit \nfrom the increased opportunity for local area development and increased \nrevenues. \n \nThe Project will benefit about 9.3 million people living in the project area. \nThe poverty and social assessment looked at the 19 counties, of which \n17  are  rural  and  2  urban.  Six  counties  are  designated  national  or \nprovincial poverty counties. The 725 designated poverty villages have a \npopulation  of  about  1.3  million  poor.  About  90.2%  of  the  beneficiaries \nlive  in  rural  areas,  and  15%  are  poor  with  an  annual  net  income  per \ncapita  of  less  than  CNY900.  The  links  between  poverty,  difficult \ntopography, and poor transport systems are apparent in the project area \nfor \nis  often  caused  by  geographic \nremoteness and isolation, limited transport access, high transport costs, \nand  poor  access  to  market  information,  as  well  as  limited  access  to \nhealth, education, and other social services. \n \nThe  Project  will  facilitate  the  creation  of  additional  employment  and \nincome-generating  opportunities.  About  353,000  person-years  of  work \nwill  be created  during  construction. This  will  provide  direct employment \nopportunities  to  over  70,000  poor  people,  including  women  and  ethnic \nminorities.  Railway  station  area  development  will  increase  incomes  in \nlocal  communities  and  help  generate  local  revenues.  The  Project  will \nfacilitate  the  development  of  local  industry  and  tourism,  which  will  help \ngenerate  additional  opportunities \nlocal  people. \nConsultations  with  the  local  people  in  the  project  area  indicated  their \nstrong support for the Project. \n \nThe  Project  is  financially  and  economically  sustainable.  The  7.0% \nfinancial internal rate of return exceeds the 3.0% weighted average cost \nof capital. The economic internal rate of return is estimated at 17.4%.  \n \nThe railway will be constructed in hilly and mountainous terrain, which is \na  significant  technical  challenge.  The  associated  physical  risks  during \nimplementation include delays, cost overruns, worker health and safety, \nand  environmental  impacts.  These  potential  risks  have  been  assessed \n\nthe  proposed  ZXR.  Poverty \n\nfuture \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nin \n\n\f \n\nvii\n\n \n\nand appropriate mitigating measures provided. \n \nResettlement will affect about 37,000 people. The railway alignment was \nselected  to  minimize  resettlement,  where  possible.  The  resettlement \nplan includes preferential treatment for employment during construction, \nsupply  of  local  materials,  allocation  of  commercial  space  near  railway \nstations,  and  job  training.  Resettlement  will  be  implemented  by  local \ngovernments  and  closely  monitored  and  supervised.  These  measures \nwill mitigate the potential social risks associated with resettlement. \n \nIntermodal  competition  between  railways  and  roads  will  create  market \nrisks  for  the  project  railway.  However,  the  existing  railway  and  road  is \nalready  congested  and  the  capacity  constraint  is  expected  to  worsen. \nSurveys  of  passengers  found  that  the  railway  would  have  several \nadvantages  over  other  transport  modes:  lower  fares,  shorter  travel \ntimes, safety, and punctuality. The increasing commercial orientation of \nthe joint-venture railway will help to lessen the risks posed by intermodal \ncompetition. \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Zhengzhou\u2013Xi\u2019an Railway (ZXR) Project. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis  \n\n2. \nFrom  1978,  when  economic  reforms  were  introduced,  through  to  2003,  the  PRC \nexperienced  sustained  rapid  economic  growth.  This  exceptional  economic  performance \ncontinued in 2004 with economic growth rates of 9.5%. With this impressive growth, demand for \ntransportation grew quickly. During 1978\u20132004, passenger transport increased by 9% annually \nand  freight  transport  7.6%.  In  2004,  road  traffic  accounted  for  53.7%  of  total  passenger-\nkilometers  (km)  followed  by  railways  (35%),  civil  aviation  (10.9%),  and  coastal  and  inland \nwaterways  (0.4%).  The  modal  split  for  freight  ton-km  was  58.4%  for  coastal  and  inland \nwaterways, 28.9% for railways, 11.4% for roads, 1.2% for pipelines, and 0.1% for civil aviation.  \n \n3. \nThe railway is the primary mode of transport for long distance and bulk transport. At the \nend  of  2004,  the  PRC\u2019s  railway  system  of  74,400  route-kms  comprised  61,000  km  of  national \nrailways  and  13,400  km  of  joint  venture  and  local  railways.  The  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR) \noperates the state-owned national railway as an integrated system. The joint venture and local \nrailways,  comprising  regional  lines  within  provincial  boundaries,  are  constructed  under  the \nsponsorship  of  provincial  governments  and/or  MOR  to  serve  local  needs  and  provide \ninterconnection to the national railway network. Despite its large size, the railway network does \nnot provide adequate coverage for the country\u2019s population and land area.1  \n \nPRC railways have the highest freight transport density in the world and second highest \n4. \npassenger  transport  density  after  Japan.  Locomotive  turnover  is  the  highest  in  the  world. \nBetween 1978 and 2004, railway freight increased from 535 billion ton-km to 1,929 billion ton-\nkm,  equivalent  to  an  annual  growth  rate  of  5.1%.  Passenger  traffic  grew  at  6.6%  annually, \nincreasing from 109 billion to 511 billion passenger-km. The average railway journey increased \nfrom 134 km in 1978 to 484 km in 2004, compared with the average journey per passenger on \nroads, which grew from 35 to 54 km over the same period. Despite such growth rates, railway \ncapacity  has  lagged  demand  due  to  system  constraints.  Given  the  railway\u2019s  important  role  for \nproviding economic transportation, these constraints, if not removed, will continue to be among \nthe  major  constraints  to  efficient  economic  growth.  The  Government\u2019s  aggressive  plan  to \nimprove railways includes network expansion and construction in underserved areas. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n \n\n1. \n\nGovernment Strategy  \n\nThe  Government's  policy  on  railway  development  focuses  on  (i)  removing  constraints \n5. \nand  expanding  the  system,  (ii)  encouraging  the  construction  of  joint  venture  local  railways  to \npromote  the  development  of  local  economies,  (iii)  improving  the  efficiency  and  safety  of  the \nexisting  system  by  using  new  technology  and  modern  management  tools  in  planning  and \noperation,  (iv)  reducing  operating  subsidies  through  appropriate  pricing  and  commercialization \nof  services,  (v)  initiating  institutional  and  structural  reforms  to  increase  autonomy  and \n\n                                                 \n1 The network density per 1,000 square km of land is one third that of India and one tenth that of Japan. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\naccountability,  and  (vi)  encouraging  nongovernment  investment  in  infrastructure  and  related \nservices (Appendix 2).  \n \n6. \nThe  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  identifies  transportation,  including  railway \ndevelopment, as a priority. The plan envisages (i) constructing 6,000 km of new lines to provide \naccess  to  unserved  areas  with  the  network  length  reaching  a  total  of  75,000  route-km;  (ii) \nproviding 3,000 km of double lines and electrifying 5,000 km of key lines to increase capacity; \nand  (iii)  increasing  operating  speeds  on  5,000  km,  with  the  total  length  of  such  lines  reaching \n15,000  km.  A  total  investment  of  CNY350  billion,  including  CNY270  billion  for  capital \nconstruction and CNY80 billion for rolling stock is planned. During 2003\u20132007, the investments \nfor capital construction are expected to reach CNY450 billion (Appendix 3). \n \nIn  2004,  the  State  Council  approved  the  Railway  Development  Plan,  which  seeks  to \n7. \nexpand the railway network from the present 74,400 km to 85,000 km by 2010, and 100,000 km \nby  2020;  and  identifies  the  need  for  separate  passenger-  and  freight-dedicated  lines  on  busy \ntrunk routes. The route network length of the passenger-dedicated network will reach 5,000 km \nby 2010 and 12,000 km by 2020. Increasing train speed to enhance mobility is a major goal: by \n2020  train  speed  will  be  increased  to  over  200  km  per  hour  on  the  trunk  network  from  the \npresent  120  km  per  hour.  Priority  will  be  given  to  developing  railways  in  unserved  areas,  and \nregions that lack transport and remain less developed. The route network length will increase by \n16,000 km in the western region of the PRC to reach network length of 40,000 km by 2020. \n \n\n2. \n\nAsian Development Bank Strategy and Sector Experience \n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) strategy for the railway sector focuses on helping \n8. \n(i) expand the railway system by constructing new lines in unserved, less-developed areas; (ii) \nmodernize  and  increase  capacity  to  improve  efficiency  on  key  routes  of  the  national  railway \nsystem;  (iii)  commercialize  railway  operations  to  sustain  efficient  operations;  and  (iv)  increase \nrailway competitiveness in transport sector through restructuring and reform. ADB has focused \non the development of railways in poor, less-developed inland provinces to promote sustainable \neconomic growth and reduce poverty.2 ADB has provided 12 loans totaling about $2.2 billion to \nfinance  the  construction  of  about  1,921  km  of  eight  provincial  railways  operated  by  joint \nventures with MOR, and 4,138 km of new railway lines under the four national railway projects \n(Appendix  4).  The  Project,  designed  to  promote  economic  growth  by  providing  railway \ntransportation in unserved, less-developed, and poor areas of Henan and Shaanxi provinces, is \nconsistent with the PRC\u2019s development priorities and the proposed ADB strategy. \n \n\n3. \n\nPolicy Dialogue  \n\n9. \nPolicy  dialogue  has  been  a  feature  of  ADB  assistance  to  the  railway  sector  and  has \neffectively  complemented  the  lending  operations.  Since  1989,  10  technical  assistance  (TA) \ninitiatives totaling $4.6 million have been provided for institutional development of local railways, \ntariff  and  organizational  studies  for  the  Jing\u2013Jiu  railway,  enhancement  of  commercial  and \nbusiness operations, marketing and business development, human resource development, and \nimprovement  of  financial  management  and  accounting  systems  (Appendix  4).  ADB  policy \ndialogue  with  MOR  focuses  on  (i)  poverty  reduction  as  the  overarching  objective  of  ADB \noperations,  (ii)  full  compliance  with  ADB  safeguard  policies,  (iii)  sector  reforms,  (iv)  marketing \nand business development, (v) private sector participation and nongovernmental financing, and \n(vi) regional cooperation. The Railway Development Plan defines the major goals for the PRC \n                                                 \n2  ADB.  2000.  Technical  Assistance  for  Assessing  the  Impact  of  Transport  and  Energy  Infrastructure  on  Poverty \nReduction.  Manila.  The  findings  conclude  that  completed  railway  projects  supported  general  economic  growth  in \nthe region, as well as led to small areas of high economic growth in towns served by railway stations. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nrailways to 2020, and is in broad agreement with the ADB strategic agenda. MOR\u2019s proposed \nreform  agenda  for  this  plan  seeks  to  (i)  study  and  learn  from  the  best  international  practices \ngained  worldwide,  (ii)  separate  core  operations  from  noncore  transportation  businesses,  (iii) \nrationalize  and  reduce  staff,  (iv)  reform  the  railway  investment  and  financing  system,  and  (v) \nestablish specialized transportation companies.  \n\n \n\n10.  MOR  has  adopted  a  structured  approach  to  railway  reform.  In  1999,  using  a  new \nmanagement  concept\u2014the  asset  operating  liability  system,  MOR  entered  into  management \ncontracts with railway administrations to improve profitability (as a pilot project). The contracts \nhelped  improve  operational  and  financial  performance;  subsequently  this  approach  was \nextended to all 15 railway administrations. Separation of core and noncore businesses is a key \nelement  of  MOR\u2019s  restructuring  program.  The  total  number  of  employees  in  the  core \ntransportation  business  was  reduced  from  1.89  million  in  1997  to  1.55  million  in  2004.  In  the \nnoncore  transportation  business,  five  large  companies  employing  616,500  staff  have  been \ndivested.  To  provide  jobs  for  redundant  staff,  by  the  end  of  2004  MOR  had  set  up  5,800 \ndiversified businesses (independent of the core transportation business), employing more than \n416,000 staff to supply equipment, goods, and services to the railway industry. In 1998, MOR \ninitiated  a  cost-sharing  scheme  for  health  insurance  and  pensions  for  railway  employees.  In \n2004,  MOR  completed  the  transfer  of  826  educational  institutes  and  208  hospitals  to  local \ngovernments.  One  hundred  branch  lines  comprising  7,800  km  were  separated  to  improve \nproductivity  and  reduce  operating  losses  (The  reform  agenda  matrix  is  in  Appendix  5, \nSupplementary Appendix A includes a chronology of railway reforms). \n \n\na. \n\nPoverty Reduction \n\n11. \nThe strategic purpose of ADB involvement in the railway sector is to create conditions for \nsustainable  economic  growth  to  help  improve  living  standards.  The  Project,  located  in  an \nunserved  area,  has  the  potential  for  economic  growth  once  improved,  cost-effective  transport \naccess  is  provided.  Identifying  ways  to  enhance  the  poverty  reduction  impact  has  been  an \nintegral part of project planning and design. Specific features include (i) providing employment \nduring construction and operation of the ZXR on a preferential basis to poor workers including \nwomen; 3  (ii)  utilizing  locally  produced  materials  that  meet  the  requirements  of  quality  and \neconomy  (e.g.,  sand,  stone,  cement);  (iii)  adding  provisions  for  railway  station  area \ndevelopment;  (iv)  providing  station  access  roads  and  construction  access  roads;  and  (v) \nsupporting  poverty  reduction  programs  of  local  governments. 4  The  Project  will  finance \nconstruction  access  roads  to  be  handed  over  to  the  local  government  at  the  end  of  the \nconstruction. The local governments also have a 5-year plan to improve the road network and \ntransport services in the project area concurrently with the Project. These roads will reach all of \nthe  province-designated  poverty  villages.  The  Project  and  the  local  road  development  will \nincrease the welfare gains for the poor including women and help spread project benefits to the \npoverty villages. \n \n\n                                                 \n3  In the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway Project, the proportion of the poor in unskilled labor was 41% on average and 64% \nduring peak construction.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nb. \n\nSector Reforms \n\n12. \nADB is supporting institutional reform of the railway sector to separate the Government \nand enterprise functions, giving full play to market forces and increasing the competitiveness of \nthe railways. ADB has actively pursued separation of core transport business from the noncore \ntransport  business,  segmentation  of  passenger  and  freight  services,  and  strengthening  of  the \nrecently corporatized  specialized transportation companies. Setting up of passenger-dedicated \ncorridors with a separate institutional structure is a key ADB intervention. As part of ADB policy \ndialogue  with  MOR,  three  large  companies  handling  containers,  special  goods,  and  express \nparcel  have  been  set  up. 5  Rationalization  of  staff  and  reduction  of  transportation  and \nnontransportation  staff  is  also  being  pursued.  On  18  March  2005,  MOR  undertook  a  major \nrestructuring  exercise  and  abolished  41  subrailway  administration  bureaus,  thereby  reducing \none tier of railway management. The number of railway administrations has increased from 15 \nto 18. This will reduce staff, rationalize operations, improve productivity, and enhance efficiency. \nADB will continue supporting operational reforms, including emphasizing railway safety and the \nintroduction  of  safe  and  reliable  technology,  upgrading  speeds,  and  introducing  dedicated \npassenger  and  freight  lines,  modern  dispatch  control  system,  and  high  quality  information \nsystems  on  the  PRC  railway  network.  The  PRC\u2019s  accession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization \nhas  intensified  competition  among  different  modes  of  transport  and  the  structure  of  transport \ndemand is likely to change.6 ADB is providing an advisory TA for policy reform support.7 During \nproject processing, coordination was maintained with the World Bank and a common approach \nto reforms and assistance developed. This will be continued during project implementation. \n \n\nc. \n\nMarketing and Business Development  \n\n13. \nAs the PRC progresses to a market-driven economy, railways will need to compete on \nthe basis of price and service quality for demand-based transportation services. New marketing \nand  business  development  initiatives  are  needed  for  freight  and  passenger  services  to  be \ncompetitive.  In  past  projects,  ADB  has  supported  project-specific  studies  to  create  marketing \nand  business  development  opportunities,  including  skills  and  knowledge  for  market\u2013oriented \noperation  and  awareness  of  profitable  operations.  The  Project  will  continue  these  initiatives \nthrough a capacity development program for the Project Company. \n \n\nd. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation  \n\n14. \nADB policy dialogue encourages private sector participation in the railway sector for the \nprovision  of  services,  construction,  tourism,  container,  and  luggage-related  businesses.  The \nsetting  up  of  a  corporate  entity  to  construct,  operate,  and  manage  the  Project  is  a  significant \nstep. Discussion is under way to explore the possibility of future listing of the proposed company \non the stock market.8 A leading group has been established and is looking at the possibility of \ndiversified  financing  sources,  including  from  the  private  sector.  Establishing  large  container \nterminals  at  Zhengzhou  and  Xi\u2019an  will  facilitate  participation  of  shipping  lines  and  freight \n\n                                                 \n5  These companies are China Railway Container Transport Company, China Railway Express Parcel Company, and \nChina  Railway  Special  Goods  Company.  The  startup  process  is  ongoing.  ADB  and  MOR  have  agreed  on  the \nseparation  of  container  businesses  as  part  of  the  ADB-financed  Yichang\u2013Wanzhou  Railway  Project.

The  speed  of  implementation  has  generally  exceeded \nexpectations  at  appraisal,  and  agencies  have  generally  complied  with  loan  covenants. \nResettlement  and  environmental  management  were  carried  out  satisfactorily.  Audit  covenants \nwere  complied  with  in  a  timely  manner,  and  the  audited  financial  statements  were  generally \nacceptable.  Of  the  12  ADB-supported  railway  projects,  5  are  complete, 9  3  have  started \ncommercial operations,10 and 4 are under implementation.11  \n \n16. \nThe key lessons from the completed railway projects highlight the need to (i) ensure that \nthe  executing  agency  established  for  project  processing,  implementation  and  operation  has \nadequate  capacity;  (ii)  prepare  realistic  traffic  forecasts;  (iii)  review  constraints  to  traffic  on  a \nnetwork basis, and the impact on project viability of the existing and/or planned railway lines and \nother transportation modes that may compete with the project facilities; and (iv) finance railway \nprojects with appropriately determined debt-equity ratios.  \n \nPrevious  railway  projects  have  contributed  to  socioeconomic  development  in  the \n17. \nprojects' influence areas. The main impacts are (i) new railway lines in less-developed regions \nstimulated  economic  development  resulting  in  higher  growth  rates  of  gross  domestic  product \n                                                 \n9  ADB.  1989.

The \nlessons learned and experience gained are incorporated in the current project design.  \n \n\n5. \n\nRationale \n\n18. \nThe  project  rationale  reflects  (i)  network  development;  (ii)  capacity  enhancement;  (iii) \nsupport for the PRC Railway Development Plan and the western region development strategy; \nand  (iv)  promotion  of  pro-poor  economic  growth  along  the  rail  line  and  in  the  region,  thereby \nreducing  poverty.  The  project  area  is  largely  mountainous  with  abundant  natural  reserves  of \ncoal, zinc, and other nonferrous materials; and a large manufacturing industry and tourist sites. \nIn spite of abundant natural resources, many are poor and the economic growth necessary to \nreduce  rural  poverty  has  failed  to  develop  because  of  inadequate  transport  services  and  high \ncosts.  Local  governments  and  people  living  in  the  project  area  see  the  railway  as  a  key \ninvestment for addressing this problem. \n \n19. \nThe Project is the first of eight passenger-dedicated corridors to be developed by 2020. \nThe  proposed  alignment  for  the  ZXR  is  50  km  shorter  than  the  existing  Longhai  railway  line, \n                                                 \n12  In  the  project  area  of  the  Jing\u2013Jiu  Railway  (footnote  9),  the  gross  domestic  product  of  10  counties  in  Jiangxi \nprovince increased from CNY4.9 billion in 1993 to CNY15.4 billion in 1998, an annual increase of 25.5% compared \nwith 10.2% for the province as a whole. Rural income per capita in Xinfeng county increased from CNY802 in 1993 \nto CNY2,222 in 1998, an annual increase of 18.5% compared with 10.3% during 1985\u20131992 (before the Project). \n13  During the first 2 years of construction of the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway (footnote 10), a total of about 7.5 million \nperson-days of employment was generated, of which 4.1 million person-days or about 55% were provided to local \npoor people thereby raising them above the poverty line. \n\n14  The  financial  revenue  of  10  poverty  counties  in  Jiangxi  province  that  are  traversed  by  the  Jing\u2013Jiu  Railway \n(footnote  9)  increased  from  CNY0.5  billion  in  1993  to  CNY1.4  billion  in  1998,  an  annual  increase  of  22.7% \ncompared with 12.3% during 1985\u20131992, before construction of the Jing\u2013Jiu Railway. \n\n15  The  Jing\u2013Jiu  Railway  facilitated  the  setting  up  of  many  resource-  and  agriculture-based  industries  in  Xingfeng \ncounty of Jiangxi province\u2014from 3 in 1992 to 39 in 1998, after project completion. The number of businesses grew \nfrom  8,005  in  1992  to  19,287  in  1998,  and  the  number  of  persons  employed  in  these  increased  from  18,484  in \n1992  to  52,153  in  1998;  an  annual  increase  of  23%.  In  the  same  county,  the  number  of  people  living  below  the \npoverty line was reduced from 30,400 in 1993 to 11,580 in 1998, a decline of 62%. \n\n16 Beneficial  income  and  social  impacts,  particularly  on  women,  were  noted  in  the  influence  areas  of  the  Yaogu\u2013\n\nMaoming Railway (footnote 9) and Guang\u2013Mei-Shan Railway (footnote 9). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nwhich  has  the  highest  transport  density  in  PRC  railways  and  is  fully  saturated.  Traversing \nHenan  and  Shaanxi,  the  proposed  railway  line  will  connect  with  the  Beijing\u2013Guangzhou, \nShanghai\u2013Xuzhou, and Beijing\u2013Wuhan main lines on the east and Xi\u2019an\u2013Baoji\u2013Lanzhou, Xi\u2019an\u2013\nBaoji\u2013Chengdu,  Xi\u2019an\u2013Ankang,  and  Xi\u2019an\u2013Yan\u2019an17 main  lines  on  the  west.  The  proposed  line \nextends eastward to Shangqiu and Xuzhou, connecting with Jing\u2013Jiu18 and Jing\u2013Hu routes; and \nwestward to Baoji and Lanzhou, connecting with the Jing\u2013Lan routes and Lan\u2013Xin line. This is \nthe main east-west corridor linking Beijing, Shanghai, Lianyungang, and other major cities and \nports in the east, to Xi\u2019an, Baoji, Lanzhou, Urumqi, Chengdu, and Chongqing, in the west; the \ncurrent capacity on the existing Longhai line is fully used. Presently both freight and passenger \nare  transported  on  the  same  line.  This  practice  limits  speeds  and  restricts  traffic  flow.  When \ncompleted, the Project will release capacity on the existing Longhai line, and support growth of \nfreight and container traffic. The Project will also help promote regional cooperation, as this is \nthe main east-west corridor linking the PRC to Central Asia and Europe. \n \n20. \nThe Project and associated developments are expected to stimulate tourism and related \nindustries,  and  industrial  and  natural  resources  development;  increase  mobility  and  flow  of \ninformation  exchanges;  generate  employment;  increase  living  standards;  and  help  reduce \npoverty.  The  Project  is  a  part  of  the  Government's  program  to  integrate  development  of \ntransportation  facilities,  upgrade  highways,  and  construct  links  and  access  roads  to  the \nhinterland. Other infrastructure, such as water supply and investment to improve education and \nhealth care facilities are also planned. The railway will play an important role in facilitating and \nintegrating this poor and underdeveloped region.  \n \n21. \nThe Project will be a joint venture railway owned and operated by MOR and the Henan \nand Shaanxi provincial governments (HPG and SPG). Joint venture railways, which account for \n8,500  km  (2004)  of  the  PRC  system,  have  substantial  managerial  and  financial  autonomy, \nincluding  the  freedom  to  set  tariffs,  which  are  several  times  higher  than  those  of  the  national \nnetwork.  Freight  and  passenger  traffic  on  joint  venture  railways  has  grown  faster  than  on  the \nnational railways. Between 1996 and 2004, passenger traffic grew from 2.2 billon passenger-km \nto 19.6 billion (32%), and freight from 12.3 billion ton-kilometers to 91.4 billion (28.5%) annually \nas  compared  with  an  annual  growth  rate  of  6.8%  for  passengers  and  4.9%  for  freight  on  the \nnational  railway  network.  Joint  venture  railways  are  more  efficient,  employing  only  5\u20138  people \nper km compared with about 25 people per km for the national railways. The Project Company \nwill employ 7.24 people per km. \n \n22. \nThe  Project  is  a  key  intervention  in  the  railway  sector.  It  introduces  the  concept  of \nseparate  corridors  for  passenger  and  freight  for  high-density  routes,  with  many  technical, \noperational,  safety,  economic,  and  financial  benefits.  Because  it  is  a  pilot  project,  ADB  is \nassisting  in  developing  the  institutional,  marketing,  business  development,  and  technical \nstandards for such initiatives. MOR has agreed that a corporate entity will be set up to construct, \noperate,  and  manage  the  Project,  and  that  it  will  help  enhance  financial  viability  and  private \nsector  participation.  The  tariffs  agreed  are  affordable  and  financially  viable.  The  Project  will \nbring in new technology and pursue operational reforms, including the introduction of safe and \nreliable  technology,  increase  of  speeds,  and  introduction  of  modern  dispatch  control  systems \nand  high  quality  information  systems  on  the  railway  network.  When  complete,  the  Project  will \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB.  1997.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Jing\u2013Jiu Railway Technical Enhancement Project. Manila (Loan 1305-PRC for \n$200 million, approved on 14 July 1994). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nrelease  capacity  on  the  existing  Longhai  line,  and  provide  for  an  efficient,  high-quality,  safe, \nreliable, and environment friendly mode of transport in the region.  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n23. \nBy removing a transport constraint to sustainable economic growth, the Project will help \nincrease  standards  of  living  and  reduce  poverty  in  the  project  area.  This  will  be  achieved  by \nproviding efficient, affordable railway transportation in unserved, less-developed areas to create \nconditions  necessary  for  developing  local  resources  and  generating  employment  and  income-\nenhancing opportunities. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n24. \nThe  Project  comprises  nine  components:  (i)  construction  of  459  km  of  double-track, \nelectrified,  standard  gauge  class  I  passenger-dedicated  railway  between  Zhengzhou  and \nXi\u2019an;19 (ii)  construction  of  9  new  railway  stations  complete  with  facilities;  (iii)  safety  initiatives, \nincluding  provision  of  modern  technology  and  equipment  for  enhancing  safety;  (iv)  e-\ngovernance and operating dispatch information system; (v) provision of training on the use and \nmaintenance  of  modern  equipment;  (vi)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement;  (vii)  environmental \nprotection  and  mitigation  of  adverse  environmental  effects;  (viii)  consulting  services  for \nconstruction supervision, monitoring and evaluation, and marketing and business development; \nand  (ix)  strengthening  of  institutional  capabilities.  The  key  inputs  needed  for  project \nimplementation include civil works, equipment, consultants, and MOR and the Project Company \nstaff.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nincluding  enhancing  safety  by \n\nSubregional  Context.  The  proposed  railway  link  is  the  main  east-west  railway  link \n25. \nproviding  land  access  to  Europe  through  Kazakhstan.  The  Project  will  promote  railway  and \nmultimodal transport of goods and people in the region and thus support regional cooperation. \nMOR will construct two extra-large container terminals to promote regional traffic. \n \nSafety.  ADB  policy  dialogue  has  emphasized  the  need  for  operational  reforms  for  the \n26. \nrail  network, \nintroducing  safe  and  reliable  technology; \nmodernizing  maintenance  systems;  and  monitoring  safety  performance.  A  project  component \n($49.58 million equivalent, of which $20.5 million will be financed by the ADB loan) will promote \nand  enhance  railway  safety.  It  will  finance  the  procurement  of  operation  and  maintenance \nequipment to enhance safety and build capacity, including staff training. \n \nE-Governance  and  the  Operating  Dispatch  Information  System. Part of ADB policy \n27. \ndialogue  emphasized  introducing  modern  management  systems  and  high-quality  information \nsystems  for  the  PRC  railway  network.  A  project  component  ($79  million  equivalent,  of  which \n$32.61  million  will  be  financed  by  the  ADB  loan)  will  introduce  a  modern  operating  dispatch \ninformation  system,  linking  the  project  train  and  national  train  reservation  systems,  and \nintroducing a simulation system to monitor and analyze train performance.  \n \n28. \nLogistic  Center.  MOR  has  agreed  to  construct  two  extra-large  container  terminals  at \nZhengzhou and Xi-an to attract high-value traffic on the railways; promote intermodal traffic; and \nencourage private sector shippers and freight forwarders to use the facility for export and import \n\n                                                 \n19 Supplementary Appendix B describes characteristics of the ZXR. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nof cargo to other parts of the PRC, ports in the east, and Central Asia and Europe in the west. \nThese will be financed by MOR and completed by 2009. \n \n29. \nTourism. Both Henan and Shaanxi are important tourist destinations and the Project will \nsupport tourism development. In 5 key tourist station areas along the project railway, Luoyang, \nHubin, Tongguan, and Lintong districts, 13.7 million people visited as tourists in 2003 providing \nrevenue  of  CNY  381  million.  The  local  government  support  to  the  communities  including  the \npoor  to  promote  tourism  business  has  been  successful,  including  village  home  stays  and \nhandicrafts. The provincial and the local governments agreed to further increase such support \nby re-allocating some of the increased tax revenue from the Project.    \n \n30. \nPrivate  Sector.  Activities  like  consulting  services  for  construction  supervision,  testing, \nconstruction  contracts,  and  track  maintenance  is  expected  to  be  outsourced.  The  Project  will \nencourage private sector initiatives like onboard train services, including catering, cleaning, and \nloading  and  unloading  at  railway  stations.  Station  space  will  be  developed  and  rented  out  by \nopen  competition;  and  private  sidings,  hotels,  restaurants,  and  other  logistic  facilities  will  be \nencouraged in the vicinity of stations. \n \n31. \nReforms. ADB has engaged MOR in dialogue aimed at enhancing policy reform during \nproject processing; this will be continued. The separation of passenger and freight businesses is \na major step, and this is the first project to develop the institutional and technical standards for \nsuch initiatives.  Setting up  a corporate  entity  to  construct, operate,  and  manage  the  Project  is \nalso a significant step. Discussion is under way to explore the possibility of future listing of the \nproposed  company  on  the  stock  market.  A  project  leading  group  has  been  established  and  is \nexploring  the  possibility  of  diversified  financing sources,  including  from  the  private  sector.  The \nProject  proposes  specific  measures  to  outsource  some  activities  handled  by  railways  and \ninvolve  the  private  sector.  MOR  will  continue  the  process  of  separating  the  national  core  and \nnoncore activities and rationalizing staff. The Project will introduce new technology, emphasize \nsafety, and build capacity for MOR and the joint venture railways. \n \n32. \nSocial  Development  Plan. The Project will facilitate economic development, which will \nbenefit  the  largely  poor  population,  particularly  women  and  the  vulnerable.  The  social \ndevelopment action plan (SDAP) will enhance project benefits; and ensure adverse impacts are \navoided  or  mitigated;  and  economic  development  benefits  the  poor,  women,  ethnic  minorities, \nand the vulnerable in an equitable and sustainable manner. \n \n33. \nincluding \nsurveys  involved  about  10,000  people,  such  as  local  villagers,  tourists,  business  persons, \ntransport  users,  and  local  governments  (Appendix  7).  This  helped  to  (i) understand  public \nopinion  about  the  proposed  railway;  (ii) conduct  the  environmental,  economic,  and  social \nassessments;  (iii) plan  resettlement;  and  (iv)  identify  the  role  of  various  stakeholders.  Leading \ngroups  have  been  formed  in  the  prefectures  with  participation  from  the  relevant  government \nagencies,  including  poverty  reduction  offices;  All-China  Women\u2019s  Federation;  and  health,  civil \naffairs, and ethnic affairs bureaus. The local governments assured that the consultation process \nwill be continued to finalize the design and formulate appropriate land compensation, relocation, \nand rehabilitation measures. \n \n34. \nRailway  Station  Area  Development.  The  Project  includes  11  railway  stations,  which \nwill  be  connected  to  villages,  townships,  and  counties  by  roads  and  other  transport  networks. \nThe local government assured that the railway stations and surrounding areas will be developed \nwith  local  communities  to  promote  local  businesses,  income-generating  activities,  and  other \nopportunities that can benefit all communities, especially the remote poor and women. \n \n\nStakeholder  Consultation  and  Participation.  Extensive  consultations \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nLocal  Employment  for  Railway  Construction  and  Maintenance.  About  353,000 \n35. \nperson-years of work will be created per year during construction. Of this, about 60% will be for \nunskilled laborers, of which 50% or more will be targeted to poor, resettlement-affected people; \nwomen; ethnic minorities; and other vulnerable people. The use of locally produced materials for \nrailway  construction  will  generate  additional  employment.  The  poverty  reduction  offices  and \nwomen\u2019s federations will tailor their programs to ensure sustained gains from employment and \nincome-generating activities resulting from the railway project, by providing training and capacity \nbuilding. People who have gained short-term income during construction will be consulted and \ntrained to utilize the short-term income for a sustainable livelihood. This will include sending the \npoor  to  advanced  vocational  schools.  The  increased  tax  revenue  including  that  from  the  civil \nworks contractors will help augment these programs. \n \nComplementary  Development  Initiatives.  To  enhance  development  impacts  in  the \n36. \nproject area, the Henan and Shaanxi provincial and local governments will provide road access, \nelectricity,  and  telephone  to  all  the  poverty  villages  along  the  alignment.  Road  access  will  be \nprovided  to  187  villages,  electricity  supply  to  24  villages,  and  telephone  connections  to  163 \nvillages  by  2009.  The  local  governments  will  also  reallocate  part  of  the  tax  revenue  obtained \nfrom the civil works contractors to the relevant agencies to undertake development programs in \nthe project area. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n37. \nThe  total  project  cost,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  is  estimated  at \n$4,131.93 million equivalent, comprising foreign exchange costs of $1,364.61 million (33%) and \nlocal currency costs of $2,767.32 million equivalent (67%) (Table 1), details are in Appendix 8. \nThe  cost  estimates  are  based  on  quantities  derived  from  preliminary  engineering  designs  and \nunit  rates  reflecting  market  prices  for  goods  and  materials,  and  include  the  costs  of  land \nacquisition and resettlement, and environmental mitigation and monitoring. \n \n \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA. \n\n Base Cost \n1.

The  loan  will  have  a  26-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  6  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum, \nconversion  options  that  may  be  exercised  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  loan  regulations  and \nconversion  guidelines,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  Loan  Agreement. \nThe  front-end  fee  will  be  waived.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  reasons  for  its \ndecision  to borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n39.  MOR  will  finance  the  remaining  foreign  exchange  cost.  The  local  currency  cost  will  be \nfinanced  by  MOR,  HPG,  SPG,  and  cofinancing  through  a  loan  from  the  China  Development \nBank,  which  has  appraised  the  Project  and  provided  a  commitment  letter  to  MOR.  The  China \nDevelopment Bank loan is repayable over 20 years, including a grace period of 6 years, and at \na lending rate currently at 5.5% per annum. HPG and SPG will finance the land acquisition and \nresettlement  costs;  this  will  be  their  equity  contribution.  MOR,  HPG,  and  SPG  have  made \nbudgetary  provisions  for  the  counterpart  funds.  A  summary  of  the  financing  plan  is  in  Table  2 \nand the details are in Appendix 8. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\n($ million) \n \nForeign \nExchange \n400.00 \n0.00 \n964.61 \n1,364.61 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n0.00 \n1,667.27 \n1,110.05 \n2,767.32 \n\nTotal  \nCost \n\n400.00 \n1,667.27 \n2,064.66 \n4,131.93 \n\nPercent \n9.68 \n40.35 \n49.97 \n100.00 \n\nHPG = Henan provincial government, MOR = Ministry of Railways, SPG = Shaanxi provincial government. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \nChina Development Bank  \nMOR, HPG, SPG \n    \n\nTotal \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n40.  MOR  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  overall  project  implementation.  The \nForeign  Capital  and  Technical  Import  Center,  under  MOR,  will  coordinate  the  project \nmanagement office's tasks and be responsible for procurement, withdrawals, and reporting vis-\n\u00e0-vis  ADB.  MOR  is  in  the  process  of  setting  up  a  project  company  (the  Project  Company),  a \nlimited liability company under the PRC Company Law, which will be the project Implementing \nAgency. The Project Company will manage and operate the project railway after completion of \nthe construction; and develop and implement adequate and transparent business development \nmechanisms,  and  accounting  and  reporting  systems.  A  project  leading  group  headed  by  a \ndirector general and assisted by an adequate number of suitably qualified professional staff has \nbeen established. It is undertaking the preparatory work of setting up the Project Company and \nis setting up the on-site construction management offices along the project route. The staff are \nexperienced  in  railway  engineering,  financial,  and  administrative  matters,  and  in  implementing \nprojects  financed  by  international  financial  institutions.  This  leading  group  will  be  merged  with \nthe  Project  Company  once  it  is  established.  To  develop  the  Project  Company\u2019s  project \n\n \nF. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nmanagement,  business  development,  and  marketing  capacity,  further  assistance  will  be \nprovided by the project-financed consulting services. The setting up of the Project Company is a \ncondition  for  disbursement.  The  financial  assessment  questionnaire  indicates  that  the  Project \nwill  have  an  adequate  financial  management  system  in  place  (details  in  Supplementary \nAppendix C).  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  about  6  years  from  August  2005  to  December \n41. \n2011.  Land  acquisition  will  start  in  September  2005,  and  the  civil  works  in  October  2005  with \ncompletion  in  about  5  years.  The  trial  operations  will  start  in  October  2010  for  1  year  before \ncommercial operations begin (Appendix 9).  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n42. \nAll  ADB  financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  ADB  will \nfinance  procurement  of  materials  and  equipment.  The  civil  works  will  be  procured  under  local \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures.  Equipment  will  be  procured  under  international  competitive \nbidding or international shopping or direct purchase (Appendix 10). Contracts valued in excess \nof  $1,000,000  for  materials  and  equipments  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive \nbidding. Any supply contracts not exceeding $1,000,000 will be procured through international \nshopping and contracts not exceeding $100,000 will be procured through direct purchase. MOR \nwill select tendering companies on a competitive basis to handle the international bidding. The \nrelevant sections of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy will be included in all documents and contracts \nduring bidding for, and implementation, of the Project. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n(iii)  construction  supervision; \n\n(iv)  construction  quality  assurance; \n\nThe  Government  will  engage  and  finance  about  28,000  person-months  of  qualified \n43. \ninternational and domestic consultants for (i) detailed project design; (ii) preparation of technical \nspecifications; \n(v) \nenvironmental supervision and management; (vi) monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement \nplan;  and  (vii)  socioeconomic  impact  assessment,  evaluation  of  poverty  reduction,  and  project \nperformance monitoring. \n \n44. \nThe  ADB  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  20  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices  to  (i)  strengthen  institutional,  marketing,  and  business  development  functions  of  the \nProject  Company;  and  (ii)  research  and  strengthen \nthe  development,  operation,  and \nmanagement  of  the  passenger-dedicated  railway  systems  in  the  PRC.  Terms  of  reference  for \nthe  international  consultants,  to  be  recruited  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  method  and \nsimplified technical proposal, in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, are \ngiven  in  Appendix  11.  The  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  will  be  included  in  all \ninvitation documents and contracts for international consultants.  \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n45. \nAll  disbursements  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  ADB \nLoan Disbursement Handbook. Since most of the payments will be made for large contracts well \nabove $200,000, direct payment and commitment procedures will be used to withdraw the loan \nfunds.  The  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  will  be  used  for  reimbursement  of  eligible \nexpenditures for any individual payment not exceeding $200,000. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n46. \nThe  Project  Company  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project  and  have  such \naccounts and related financial statements audited annually by an external auditor in accordance \nwith auditing standards acceptable to ADB. The Project Company, through MOR, will submit to \nADB, within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year, certified copies of such audited project \naccounts  and  financial  statements  and  auditor's  reports,  all  in  English.  The  audit  of  such \nfinancial statements will include (i) an assessment of the adequacy of  accounting and internal \ncontrol  systems  with  respect  to  project  expenditures  and  other  financial  transactions;  (ii)  an \nassessment of compliance with loan covenants and ADB requirements for project management; \nand (iii) an opinion on the use of the statement of expenditure procedure. The Project Company \nwill  also  submit  its  audited  financial  statements  covering  income  statements,  balance  sheets, \nand  cash-flow  statements  during  construction  and  in  the  first  three  years  of  commercial \noperations  of  the  project  railway  within  6  months  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year.  To  ensure \nthat the effective internal control system and checks and balances mechanism are put in place, \nThe  Project  Company  will  establish  an  internal  control  unit  within  the  company.  The  unit  will \nindependently  test  financial  transactions  to  ensure  the  safe  custody  of  the  project-financed \nassets and report directly to the Project Company's board of directors. \n\n \n\n47. \nThe Project Company will make satisfactory arrangements for reporting the progress of \nproject implementation by submitting quarterly progress reports through MOR. Within 3 months \nof completion, MOR will submit a project completion report to ADB.  \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n48.  MOR  agreed  to  a  set  of  indicators  for  evaluating  project  performance  in  relation  to  its \nimpacts, outcomes, outputs, and conditions. The indicators, to be reviewed at the start of project \nimplementation,  include  (i)  economic  development  and  socioeconomic  indicators,  (ii)  transport \ncosts  and  time  for  passenger  services,  (iii)  transport  services  and  transport  charges,  (iv) \naccident  rates,  (v)  financial  sustainability,  (vi)  county/village  incomes,  (vii)  access  to  social \nservices,  and  (viii)  jobs  created  in  construction  and  maintenance.  At  the  beginning  of  project \nimplementation, MOR and the Project Company will establish baseline and target values for the \nindicators. The indicators will be measured at project inception, completion, and 3 years later; \nand  compared  with  the  baseline.  Where  relevant,  indicators  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender \n(Appendix  12).  MOR  will  recruit  qualified  consultants  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  to  help \nestablish the monitoring and evaluation system, and train the Project Company staff in its use. \nThe  main  sources  of  data  include (i)  secondary  data  from  government  sources,  (ii)  household \nsocioeconomic  sample  survey,  and  (iii)  participatory  rapid  appraisal.  MOR  will  submit  a  report \nsummarizing the key findings of monitoring at inception, completion, and 3 years later to ADB. \n  \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n49. \nIn  2008,  ADB,  MOR,  and  the  Project  Company  will  carry  out  a  midterm  review  of  the \nProject, covering all institutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, \npoverty reduction, resettlement, economic, financial, and other relevant aspects that may have \nan impact on the performance of the Project and its continuing viability. The review will examine \nprogress in sector reforms, policy development, resettlement, environment, poverty impact, and \ncompliance with assurances in the loan agreement. \n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\n9. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n50. \nDuring project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local \ngovernment officials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was added \nto ADB Guidelines on Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, particularly the \nneed  for  bidders,  suppliers,  contractors,  and  consultants  to  observe  the  highest  standards  of \nethics in the procurement and execution of ADB-financed contracts, and the sanctions if fraud \nand corruption are discovered.  \n \n51. \nBased on MOR\u2019s experience in fighting corruption, the following actions will be taken to \nprevent corruption: (i) a supervisory body is established for prevention of undue interference in \nbusiness practices and adequate resources are made available for its effective operation, and \n(ii) a leading group of officials from the Discipline Unit and Supervision Department of the MOR \nis located in offices involved in the  bidding, construction and other operational activities under \nthe  Project.  The  Borrower  shall  also  cause  MOR  and  the  Project  Company  to  initiate  liaison \nmeetings with the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, on a needed basis, where warnings about or information \non corrupt practices can be discussed. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nThe  project  benefits  and  impacts  were  assessed  along  with  potential  risks  associated \n52. \nwith  the  Project.  The  combined  benefits  and  impacts  will  outweigh  the  costs,  and net  benefits \nwill accrue to the project area. \n \nA. \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\n53. \nThe traffic forecast was based on forecasts prepared by the Fourth Survey and Design \nInstitute  (FSDI),  by  considering  expected  economic  growth,  population  increase,  tourism \ndevelopment  potential,  local  government  development  plans,  market  surveys,  and  the \nassessment  of  TA  consultants  and  the  ADB  Mission.  The  passenger  volume  on  the  ZXR  is \nforecast to grow from 15,652 million passenger-km in 2011 to 50,372 million passenger-km in \n2031, with an average growth rate of 6%. As a result of the released capacity on the Longhai \nline  with project  completion,  the  freight  traffic  on  the  ZXR  corridor  is  forecast  to  increase  from \nabout  16,140  million  ton-km  in  2011  to  49,024  million  ton-km  in  2031,  with  an  annual  growth \nrate  of  5.7%  based  on  similar  factors.  The  projected  volumes  can  be  accommodated  by  the \nZXR and justify project construction (Appendix 13). \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n54. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated by comparing the with- and \nwithout-project situations. The ZXR will reduce the cost of transport to and from the poor north \nand  northwestern  part  of  Henan  and  Shaanxi.  Economic  costs  include  costs  for  construction, \noperation,  and  maintenance,  and  value  of  agricultural  production  from  land  lost  permanently. \nEconomic  benefits  include  (i) operating  cost  savings  for  freight  and  passenger  traffic,  (ii) time \nsaving  in  diverted  passenger  traffic  from  buses,  (iii) net  economic  value  added  of  generated \ncommodity production, (v) generated passenger benefits, and (vi) tourism benefits. The project \nEIRR is 17.4%, indicating the Project is economically viable (Appendix 13). Sensitivity analysis \nconfirms the robustness of the Project's economic viability. Changes in the key variables, such \nas  a  20%  reduction  in benefits,  do  not  significantly  impact  economic  viability.  The  capital  cost \nwould have to increase by 33% over those estimated for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of \n12%.  The  freight  and  passenger  benefits  would  have  to  decrease  by  30%  and  323% \nrespectively.  Given  experience  in  the  PRC  railway  sector,  variations  of  such  magnitude  are \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\nunlikely. Project risks were quantified using the statistical method, i.e., considering the possible \nvalue for key variables and the probability with which they may occur. The result shows that the \nEIRR will exceed 12% with 97% probability. Distribution analysis, undertaken by determining the \nproject effects for various beneficiaries, indicates that a large portion of net benefits will accrue \nto project users. \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Benefits  \n\nFinancial  projections  prepared  for  the  Project  Company,  in  accordance  with  ADB \n55. \nGuidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects, assessed the \nfinancial  viability  and  sustainability  of  the  railway  (Appendix 14).  The  projected  financial \nstatements indicate that financial revenues will be sufficient to cover operation and maintenance \ncosts,  income  taxes,  and  debt  service;  and  provide  a  reasonable  rate  of  return.  The  financial \nevaluation was undertaken in real terms using constant 2005 prices. The project cost estimates \nand  financial  projections  in  nominal  terms  were  converted  to  real  terms  by  adjusting  for  the \nprojected  effects  of  foreign  and  domestic  inflation  and  currency  fluctuation.  Incremental  costs \nand benefits were derived under with- and without-project scenarios. The financial internal rate \nof  return,  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  is  7%.  This  compares  favorably  with  the  weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital,  also  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  of  3%.  The  Project  is  both \nfinancially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity and risk analyses indicate that the financial internal \nrate of return for the Project is robust under most conditions (Appendix 14). \n \n56. \nConsolidated financial statements for MOR have been prepared based on past audited \nfinancial  statements;  Based  on  the  consultant\u2019s  estimates,  MOR\u2019s  financial  performance  is \nprojected to be sound and sustainable over the operating period (Supplementary Appendix D). \nFinancial ratios were discussed and covenanted. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impact and Assessment \n\n57. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  A.  The  FSDI,  Environmental \nEngineering  Division  prepared  an  EIA,  which  was  approved  by  the  State  Environmental \nProtection Agency on 21 June 2005. MOR endorsed the summary EIA, which was circulated to \nADB\u2019s Board of Directors and uploaded on the ADB website on 29 April 2005 (Supplementary \nAppendix E).  \n \n58. \nPotential  adverse  environmental  impacts  include  (i)  noise  and  vibration  impacts  on \nadjacent  residents;  (ii)  soil  erosion  from  cut  and  fill  activities;  (iii)  disturbance  of  historical, \ncultural,  and  archaeological  sites;  (iv)  impact  on  surface  water  quality  of  adjacent  waterways; \nand (v) public health and safety. \n  \nThe  EIA  concluded  that  the  adverse  environmental  impacts  can  be  successfully \n59. \nmitigated through the use of best practices and appropriate technologies. Implementation of the \nenvironmental management, mitigation, and monitoring programs included in the EIA will ensure \ncompliance with ADB and Government environmental guidelines and procedures. Internal and \nexternal monitoring and audits will be conducted to ensure that standards and regulations are \nfollowed. An independent monitoring agency will be hired to carry out  external monitoring and \nevaluation work during implementation. \n \nE. \n\nImpact on Poverty  \n\n60. \nThe  railway  passes  through  two  provinces  (Henan  and  Shaanxi);  five  prefectures \n(Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Sanmenxia, Weinan, and Xi\u2019an) 19 counties, 6 of which are designated \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nnational  or  provincial  poverty  counties;  and  725  designated  poverty  villages  with  about  1.3 \nmillion  poor  residents.  The  Project  will  benefit  about  9.3  million  people  in  the  project  area\u2014\nabout  90.2%  are  rural  (17  counties)  and  15.0%  are  poor  with  a  net  income  per  capita  of  less \nthan CNY900 in 2004. In the urban area (2 counties), 5.8% are poor with per capita income less \nthan  that  of  minimum  living  standards.  Of  the  total  population,  14.0%  are  poor.  The  summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 16. \n \n61. \nPoverty in the area is caused by (i) geographical remoteness and isolation, limited road \naccess, high transport costs, and limited access to market and information; (ii) adverse weather \nconditions  and  limited  natural  resources  (e.g.,  cold  weather,  water  scarcity,  and  limited  arable \nland); (iii) lack of knowledge and technical skills in cropping and animal husbandry; (iv) limited \naccess to credit and training for off-farm activities; (v) limited off-farm employment opportunities; \n(vi) poor social infrastructure, and lack of access to good health care facilities; and (vii) high cost \nof middle and higher education. \n \n62. \nAbout 353,000 person-years of work will be created during railway construction, 60% will \nbe  unskilled  work.  Half  of  the  unskilled  work  will  be  targeted  for  the  poor,  totaling  105,920 \nperson-years at total wages of CNY1,037 million or CNY9,790 per person-year. Priority will be \ngiven to women, people affected by resettlement, ethnic minorities, and other vulnerable people. \nIn addition, during construction, 6,249 person-years of local jobs will be created in the provision \nof construction material with total wages of CNY61.4 million, of which 1,875 person-years will be \nfor  the  poor,  with  total  wages  of  CNY18.4  million  or  annual  average  wage  of  CNY9,828  per \ncapita. When the operation of the new railway starts, approximately 2,988 additional jobs will be \ncreated with total wages of CNY53.7 million annually or CNY1,344.5 million during the 25-year \noperation  period.  The  estimated  construction  tax  revenue  from  the  Project  to  counties  in  the \nproject  area  is  CNY714  million.  Local  governments  are  responsible  for  provision  of  social \nservices  and  poverty  reduction  funds  for  county  poverty  reduction  planning.  The  local \ngovernments agreed to allocate part of this added revenue for a range of poverty reduction and \nsocial activities, including mitigation of negative impacts of HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency \nvirus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and STIs (sexually transmitted infections), human \ntrafficking,  and  environment,  with  special  attention  to  resettlement-affected  groups,  women, \nethnic groups, and other vulnerable people. This includes a program of income sustainability for \nthe poor after project implementation, especially those hired for project construction.  \n \n63. \nThe  11  railway  stations,  connected  to  all  villages  including  poverty  villages,  will  create \njobs, and help distribute project benefits. The stations will have sufficient space inside and out \nfor local area development; local governments will support the poor and other vulnerable people \nto sell local produce, handicrafts, and goods. Expecting more efficient freight transport from the \nexisting  railway,  and  business  travel  on  the  project  railway,  many  enterprises  are  planning  to \nexpand  their  outputs  and  increase  labor.  As  the  project  area  includes  internationally  and \nnationally  well-known  tourist  areas,  additional  revenue  and  employment  are  expected  from \ntourism. In 2003, 4 million domestic tourists used the train to visit tourist sites along the project \nrailway alignment. Annually, over 3.55 million additional tourists are expected to use the project \nrailway,  which  over  25  years  means  88.75  million  tourists,  with  total  revenue  of  CNY2,304 \nmillion.  These  direct  and  indirect  impacts  will  provide  conditions  for  poor  families  to  (i)  move \naway  from  unsustainable,  mountainous  farmlands;  (ii)  have  better  access  to  markets,  and \nadvanced  educational  and  health  facilities,  especially  for  women;  and  (iii)  build  a  sustainable \nfuture in new centers of economic activity. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\nF. \n\nResettlement Impact  \n\n64. \nThe project railway alignment will cross 170 rural villages and 13 urban neighborhoods \nin 19 counties and urban districts from Zhengzhou to Xi\u2019an. An estimated 1,782 hectares (ha) of \nland  will  be  permanently  acquired,  of  which  about  63%  is  currently  under  cultivation,  8% \norchards,  11%  housing  plots,  2%  forest,  4%  grassland,  and  12%  wasteland.  Approximately \n16,147  people  will  be  affected  in  terms  of  loss  of  land,  assuming  total  loss  of  cultivated  land \nbased  on  average  per  capita  landholdings.  The  Project  will  also  temporarily  require  an \nestimated 596 ha. About 1,682,392 square meters (m2) of structures will be affected, of which \n79%  are  residential  structures.  Relocation  of  29,774  people  will  be  required.  The  Project  will \nalso  require  relocation  of  46,426  m2  of  schools  and  302,087  m2  of  factories  and  other \nenterprises. A total of 36,736 people will be directly affected. Land acquisition and resettlement \nimpacts are minimized by aligning the railway away from urban areas, village centers, and other \nfacilities, where possible, based on consultations with communities.  \n \n65.  MOR, in consultation with provincial and local governments, has prepared a resettlement \nplan  (Appendix  15,  the  full  plan  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F)  based  on  the  preliminary \ndesign  study;  village  surveys  of  all  170  rural  villages,  and  all  13  village-level  urban \nneighborhoods;  2,354  household  surveys;  provincial,  prefecture,  and  local  government \nstatistics;  and  consultations  with  local  officials,  village  leaders,  and  affected  households. \nAlthough the total amount of land and people affected is large, these impacts are spread thinly \nover  a  long  narrow  corridor.  Income  loss  from  land  acquisition  is  less  severe  because  this \ncorridor  is  developing  rapidly  and  at  least  70%  of  net  income  for  more  than  half  of  rural \nhouseholds comes from nonagricultural employment and small businesses. Special assistance \nwill  be  provided  to  vulnerable  households  that  include  the  poor,  widows,  disabled,  and  ethnic \nminorities.  \n \n66. \nLocal  government  land  administration  bureaus,  in  conjunction  with  railway  construction \nsupport offices, will be responsible for implementing resettlement; many activities will be carried \nout  by  township  officials  and  village  committees.  The  estimated  resettlement  cost  is  $181.4 \nmillion,  excluding  the  costs  for  enterprise  relocation  and  infrastructure.  In  December  2004, \nMOR, HPG, and SPG signed agreements whereby local governments will fund 100% of the cost \nof land acquisition and resettlement; this in turn will be an equity contribution to the Project. The \nresettlement budget will be adjusted based on the actual measurement of physical losses and \nmarket  prices.  Affected  people  have  been  informed  and  consulted  about  the  likely  impacts  at \nvarious stages. During the preliminary design stage, stakeholders consulted included heads of \naffected  households;  village  leaders  and  representatives;  local  government  agencies  and \ndepartments;  and  vulnerable  groups,  including  women  and  ethnic  minorities.  Resettlement \ninformation  booklets  were  distributed  to  affected  villages  in  April  2005,  and  MOR,  HPG,  and \nSPG endorsed the resettlement plan.  \n \n67.  MOR  and  municipal  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  offices,  in  collaboration  with  the \ncounty resettlement offices, will be responsible for internal supervision and monitoring. MOR will \nprepare  progress  reports  and  submit  them  to  ADB  on  a  quarterly  basis,  until  resettlement  is \ncompleted. MOR will then prepare a resettlement completion report for submission to ADB. In \naddition,  an  independent  monitor  will  carry  out  the  external  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and \nprepare monitoring reports for submission to MOR and ADB every 6 months until completion of \nresettlement activities; thereafter, annual evaluation investigations will be conducted for at least \n2 years and reported to MOR and ADB. \n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nG. \n\nEthnic Minorities \n\n68. \n The project area has 52,527 residents from 11 ethnic minority nationalities, representing \n0.65% of the total population of the project area (9.5 million). The main ethnic group (83.7%) is \nHui,  who  are  descendants  of  Muslim  traders  that  settled  in  Xi\u2019an  and  Zhengzhou.  About  500 \nmay  be  affected  by  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Investigations  reveal  the  Hui  villagers \nwere  integrated  with  the  Han  and  shared  the  same  socioeconomic  conditions.  Other  ethnic \nminorities (such as Man, Mongol, Uygur) are not affected by land acquisition and resettlement, \nas  they  are  either  located  in  urban  areas  or  remote  villages  far  from  the  alignment.  Specific \nprovisions  such  as  livelihood  training,  employment  on  construction,  access  to  rural  credit, \nassistance  with  house  construction,  and  social  security  are  included  in  the  resettlement  plan. \nEthnic  minorities  are  also  included  as  a  target  group  in  the  social  development  action  plan \n(SDAP) to enhance benefits for poor or vulnerable people in the project area (Appendix 17). \n  \nH. \n\nSocial and Gender Aspects  \n\nThe  Project  will  generate  job  opportunities  for  the  poor,  ethnic  minorities,  women,  and \n69. \nother  vulnerable  groups,  and  will  help  develop  their  job  skills.  Sufficient  areas  for  income-\ngenerating  activities  will  be  designated  in  and  around  the  station.  Construction  and  operation-\nrelated  job  opportunities  and  those  generated  from  the  Project  will  provide  potential  new \nsources  of  income  for  local  residents.  An  increase  in  female  participation  in  the  labor  and \ntourism market has the potential to increase women\u2019s net income and savings, improve overall \nfamily  welfare,  and  improve  the  status  of  women;  older  women  in  particular  tend  to  have  less \nemployment  opportunities  than  men.  Through  several  programs  along  the  alignment  the  All-\nChina  Women\u2019s  Federation  will  specifically  address  the  needs  of  women  and  children.  The \nfederation will operate even more actively in the project area so that women are able to take full \nadvantage  of  additional  work  and  income  opportunities  facilitated  by  the  Project  to  build \nbusinesses  that  help  sustain  their  families.  The  federation  also  reported  that  children  from \nhouseholds led by poor single woman will be helped to go to school. \n \n70.  Women and other vulnerable groups will benefit from the Project, and have equal access \nto project-generated employment and wages. The railway will generate demand for local labor \nand increase worker productivity and wages. Under PRC law, women are given equal rights in \nemployment.  Expansion  of  secondary  and  tertiary  industries  will  help  generate  additional \nemployment  opportunities  for  both  men  and  women.  Afforestation  activities  will  provide \nadditional  employment  opportunities  for  women  relatively  close  to  their  homes.  An  increase  in \nfemale  participation  in  the  labor  and  tourism  market  will  increase  women\u2019s  net  income  and \nsavings potential, improving overall family welfare and the status of women.  \n \n71. \nThe  construction  and  operation  of  the  railway  could  have  an  impact  on  HIV/AIDS  and \nSTIs due to the large number of workers during construction, expansion of the tourism industry, \nand  insufficient  knowledge  on  these  issues.  However,  the  project  area  has  fewer  cases  of \nHIV/AIDS  infection  than  southeast  Henan.20 Both  Henan  and  Shaanxi  have  an  active  public \ninformation program for HIV/AIDS awareness, including distribution of leaflets and posters, and \nradio  and  television  education  programs.  In  Henan,  an  HIV/AIDS  survey  and  testing  for  the \nentire  population  were  conducted  in  2003,  and  Shaanxi  will  conduct  a  survey  and  testing  this \nyear. Even the poor in remote areas have knowledge on prevention methods on HIV/AIDS and \n\n                                                 \n20 A  government  survey  of  blood  sellers,  carried  out  in  Henan  in  the  summer  of  2004,  reported  25,036  cases  of \nHIV/AIDS  (China  Daily,  16  November  2004).  Most  were  infected  through  illegal  or  inappropriate  blood  collection \nduring  the  mid-1990s  (China  Daily,  29  May  2004).  Most  of  the  HIV/AIDS  victims  in  Henan  province  have  been \nreceiving free medical treatment (China Daily, 3 March 2004). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\nSTIs.  The  health  departments  in  these  provinces  have  ongoing  awareness  and  prevention \nprograms, and voluntary counseling and testing for HIV/AIDS and STIs. \n \n72. \nDuring  the  construction,  the  county  governments  along  the  alignment  will  increase \nawareness of workers and communities. MOR has experience implementing various awareness \nand prevention programs during railway construction. Medical clinics are established in the area \nof  construction  camps,  and  HIV/AIDS  awareness  campaigns  and  preventive  measures  for \nworkers and communities are organized during railway construction.  \n \n73.  MOR  has  agreed  with  the  SDAP,  which  will  (i)  enhance  job  opportunities  for  local \nresidents; (ii) provide training and vocational programs for poor, women, ethnic minorities, and \nthe vulnerable; (iii) support HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention programs; (iv) support income \nrecovery  programs  for  people  affected  by  resettlement;  (v)  provide  awareness  and  prevention \nprograms  for  safety  during  construction  and  operation;  and  (vi)  promote  local  tourism \ndevelopment.  This  will  be  implemented  with  participation  from  relevant  local  government \nagencies,  including  poverty  reduction  offices;  All-China  Women\u2019s  Federation;  and  health,  civil \naffairs, and ethnic affairs bureaus. Leading groups have been formed  to continue consultation \nand coordination among various agencies during implementation.  \n \nI. \n\nRisks \n\n74. \nThe Project is formulated to minimize potential risks. Based on experience with previous \nrailway  projects,  traffic  demand  is  conservatively  estimated  as  is  passenger  traffic.  Sensitivity \ntests indicate that economic circumstances would have to become substantially adverse for the \nProject to lose economic viability. A potential risk is delay in implementation, which would delay \nthe realization of benefits. MOR has successfully built railway lines, such as the Hefei\u2013Xi\u2019an and \nJing\u2013Jiu railways. Government, MOR, HPG, and SPG support for the Project and its preparation \ncontributes to reducing the potential risk of implementation delays. Environmental risks will be \nmitigated  by  the  measures  in  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  and  will  be  closely \nmonitored during project implementation. \n \n75. \nResettlement will affect about 37,000 people as the railway alignment is routed to cause \nminimal  resettlement.  The  resettlement  plan  includes  preferential  treatment  for  employment \nduring  construction,  supply  of  local  materials,  allocation  of  commercial  space  near  railway \nstations, and job training. The resettlement plan and SDAP will be closely monitored to ensure \ncompliance with ADB social safeguard policies. \n \nIntermodal competition among railways and roads will create market risks for the project \n76. \nrailway.  However,  the  existing  railway  and  road  is  already  congested  and  capacity  constraints \nare  expected  to  worsen.  Passenger  surveys  indicate  that  the  railway  has  several  advantages: \nlower fares, shorter travel times, safety, and punctuality. The increasing commercial orientation \nof the joint-venture railway will help lower risks posed by intermodal competition. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n77. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n(i) \n\nReform  measures.  The  Government  will  take  necessary  measures  to  continue \nimplementation of the Railway Development Plan (2004) including (a) separation \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nof  the  core railway  operations  from  noncore  transportation business  operations, \n(b)  rationalization  of  staff,  and  (c)  encouragement  of  the  Project  Company  to \noutsource some activities currently handled by railways. \n\nConstruction  quality.  The  Government  will  cause  MOR  and  the  Project \nCompany to ensure that the project railway is constructed in accordance with the \nGovernment\u2019s  national  technical  standards,  and  that  construction  supervision, \nquality control, and contract management are carried out satisfactorily. \n\nConnecting  railway  lines.  The  Government  will  cause  MOR  and  the  Project \nCompany  to  ensure  that  (a)  capacity  enhancement  operations  for  connecting \nrailway lines are completed by commencement of commercial operations of the \nproject railway; and (b) necessary measures are promptly taken to mitigate any \ncapacity constraint on connecting railway lines, identified during operation of the \nproject railway, to ensure smooth flow of traffic generated by the project railway. \n\nContainer traffic. The Government will cause MOR to construct two extra-large \ncontainer  terminals  at  Zhengzhou  and  Xi\u2019an  by  commencement  of  commercial \noperations of the project railway.   \n\nSupply of rolling stock. The Government will ensure that MOR and the Project \nCompany provide sufficient rolling stock, at all times, for effective operation of the \nproject railway. \n\nPassenger  safety. The Government will cause MOR and the Project Company  \nto  ensure  the  safety  of  passengers  on  the  project  railway  in  accordance  with \nrelevant Government laws and regulations. \n\nSafety dissemination. The Government will ensure that the Project Company, in \ncooperation  with  the  local  prefecture,  city,  and  county  governments,  formulates \nand  implements  appropriate  public  safety  campaigns  through  media,  public \nannouncements,  households,  and  schools  to  familiarize  people  living  along  the \nproject railway route with safety issues related to railways. \n\n(viii)  Station access and link roads. The Government will cause the local prefecture, \ncity  and  county  governments  to  (a)  construct  station  access  roads  in  a  timely \nmanner prior to commencement of commercial operations of the project railway, \nand (b) apply ADB safeguard policies in construction of such roads. \n\nFinancial  ratios  and  reporting.  The  Government  will  cause  the  Project \nCompany  to  maintain,  starting  after  the  second  year  of  commencement  of  the \ncommercial  operations  of  the  project  railway,  (a)  an  operating  ratio  of  not  more \nthan  70%,  (b)  a  debt-service  coverage  ratio  of  at  least  1.2,  and  (c)  a  debt  to \nequity  ratio  of  not  more  than  65:35  to  ensure  operating  efficiency  and  financial \nsustainability. \n\nAudited  accounts  and  financial  statements.

Despite  Government  efforts  to  increase  the  country's  transport  capacity, \n1. \nserious constraints and bottlenecks remain, especially in the road and railway sectors. By the end \nof  2004,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  transport  system  comprised  about  74,400 \nkilometers  (km)  of  railways,  1.86 million km  of  highways,  123,300 km  of  inland  waterways,  and \n2.05 million km of civil aviation routes. However, the density of the transport network ranks among \nthe  lowest  in  the  world  relative  to  either  population  or  geographic  area.  From  1978,  when \neconomic reforms were first introduced, through to 2004, the PRC experienced sustained rapid \neconomic  growth.  This  resulted  in  an  accordingly  rapid  increase  in  demand  for  transportation. \nThe  annual  growth  of  passenger  transport  was  9%  and  freight  transport  7.6%  during  1978\u2013\n2004. In 2004, road traffic accounted for 53.7% of total passenger-km, followed by railways with \n35%, civil aviation with 10.9%, and coastal and inland waterways with 0.4%. The modal split for \nfreight  ton-km  was  58.4%  for  coastal  and  inland  waterways,  28.9%  for  railways,  11.4%  for \nroads, 1.2% for pipelines, and 0.1% for civil aviation.  \n \nRecent  Developments.  To  improve  transport  inefficiencies  and  eliminate  transport \n2. \nbottlenecks \nincreased \ninvestment  in  transport  infrastructure  in  the  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan  (1996\u20132000)  and  the  Tenth \nFive-Year Plan (2001\u20132005). Investment in transport infrastructure as a share of gross domestic \nproduct more than doubled in the last decade. A World Bank study1 indicates that total transport \ninvestment  should  be  increased  to  at  least  3.8%  of  gross  domestic  product  to  avoid  economic \ncosts  associated  with  transport  constraints.  To  meet  the  increase  in  transport  demand,  more \ninfrastructure  investments  are  needed.  The  Government  continues  to  accord  high  priority  to \ntransport  and  substantial  investments  in  the  road  and  railway  sectors  from  both  domestic  and \ninternational financing sources, including the private sector, are envisaged in the 11th Five-Year \nPlan (2006\u20132010), which is currently under preparation. \n \n3. \nFuture  Development  Priorities  and  Outlook.  The  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005) \nidentifies  transportation,  including  railway  development,  as  a  priority.  The  plan  envisages \n(i) constructing  6,000 km  of  new  lines  to  provide  access  to  unserved  areas  with  the  network \nlength  reaching  a  total  of  75,000  route-km,  (ii) providing  3,000 km  of  double  lines  and \nelectrifying 5,000 km of key lines to increase capacity, and (iii) increasing operating speeds on \n5,000 km  with  the  total  length  of  such  lines  reaching  15,000 km.  A  total  investment  of \nCNY350 billion,  including  CNY270 billion  on  capital  construction  and  CNY80 billion  for  rolling \nstock,  is  planned  for  the  railway  sector.  During  2003\u20132007,  the  investments  for  capital \nconstruction are expected to reach CNY450 billion.  \n \nIn  2004,  the  State  Council  approved  the  new  Railway  Development  Plan  (up  to  2020). \n4. \nThe  plan  seeks  to  expand  the  railway  network  from  74,000 km  to  85,000 km  by  2010,  and  to \n100,000 km by 2020. Increasing train speed is a major goal. Train speed will be raised to over \n200 km per hour on the trunk network by 2020. Priority will be given to developing railways in \nunserved areas and regions that lack transport and have remained less developed. The route \nnetwork length will be increased by 16,000 km to reach 40,000 km in the western region of the \nPRC  by  2020.  The  plan  also  calls  for  separating  passenger  and  freight  traffic  in  heavily \ntrafficked corridors and 12,000 km of passenger dedicated corridor will be developed by 2020. \n\n                                                 \n1  World  Bank.  1998.  China:  Forward  with  One  Spirit:  A  Strategy  for  the  Transport  Sector.  Report  No.  1595-CHA \n\nTransport Sector Unit, East Asia and Pacific Regional Office, World Bank. Washington, DC.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nAsian Development Bank Experience \n\nOther  Development  Partner  Operations. In the railway subsector, the Japan Bank for \n5. \nInternational Cooperation and the World Bank, in addition to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nhave been mainly involved in expanding the capacity of national railways. In the past 20 years, the \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  has  provided  \u00a5578 billion  for  15  railway  projects  to \nexpand  rail  transport  capacity,  particularly  in  major  coal  transport  corridors.  It  has  also  financed \ndevelopment of new sections of the national railway network in inland provinces. Since 1984, the \nWorld Bank has provided 10 loans totaling $2.4 billion for nine national railway projects and one \nlocal railway project. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nAssistance  in  the  Sector.  ADB  has  focused  on  improving  infrastructure  in  less-\ndeveloped and poor regions to promote sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty. Since \n1989, ADB has provided 12 loans totaling about $2.2 billion to help finance the construction of \n1,921 km  of  new  railway  lines  under  eight  local  railway  projects,  and  4,138 km  of  new  railway \nlines  under  four  national  railway  projects.  These  projects  have  introduced  modern  technology \nand  improved  the  efficiency  of  railway  operation  through  institutional  and  structural  reforms. \nADB  also  provided  10  technical  assistance  initiatives  totaling  $4.6 million  to  promote  the \ncommercial  operation  of  railways,  establish  corporate  governance,  achieve  cost  recovery,  and \nimprove railway management.  \n \n7. \nEvaluation  of  Assistance.  Experience  from  completed  and  ongoing  ADB-financed \nrailway projects in the PRC shows strong commitment and generally satisfactory capabilities of \nthe  executing  agencies  for  project  implementation.  The  speed  of  implementation  has  often \nexceeded the expectations at the time of appraisal. The executing agencies generally complied \nwith  the  loan  covenants.  Resettlement  and  environmental  management  were  carried  out \nsatisfactorily. Audited financial statements were submitted in a timely manner, and the audited \nfinancial  statements  were  found  generally  acceptable.  Of  ADB\u2019s  12  railway  projects,  5  are \ncomplete,  3  recently  started  commercial  operation,  and  4  are  under  implementation.  The  key \nlessons  highlight  the  need  to  (i) ensure  that  the  executing  agency  established  for  project \nprocessing  and  implementation  has  adequate  capacity;  (ii) prepare  realistic  traffic  forecasts; \n(iii) review  constraints  to  traffic  on  a  network  basis,  and  the  impact  on  project  viability  of  the \nexisting and/or planned railway lines and other transportation modes that may compete with the \nproject  facilities;  and  (iv) finance  railway  projects  with  appropriately  determined  debt-equity \nratios.  The  railway  projects  have  contributed  to  a  dramatic  transformation  of  local  economies. \nThe  per  capita  rural  incomes  in  project  areas  increased  substantially.  Living  standards  were \nraised and poverty reduced. The project performance audit report2 for the ADB-financed Jing-Jiu \nrailway  project  in  the  PRC  concluded  that  the  project  was  successful  and  exceeded  its  original \npassenger traffic forecasts. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nStrategy and Priorities. ADB strategy for the railway sector has three broad objectives: \n(i) improve economic efficiency, (ii) promote growth in poor inland provinces to reduce poverty, \nand  (iii) protect  the  environment  and  manage  natural  resources.  In  pursuit  of  these  three \nobjectives, the strategy supports developing efficient and integrated transport networks to meet \nthe  needs  of  a  growing  market  economy  and  to  contribute  to  reducing  poverty  through \ninvestment targeting poorer areas coupled with policy and institutional reforms. Because of the \n\nADB Strategy \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB.  2002.  Project  Performance  Audit  Report  on  the  Jing\u2013Jiu  Railway  Technical  Enhancement  Project  in  the \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nimportance  of  railway  transport  for  development  of  the  national  economy,  ADB  strategy  for  the \nrailway sector focuses on (i) expanding the railway system by constructing new lines in unserved \nareas that are less developed and poor, (ii) modernizing and increasing the capacity to improve \ntransport  efficiency  on  key  routes  of  the  national  railway  system,  (iii) commercializing  railway \noperations  to  sustain  efficient  operations,  and  (iv) increasing  railway  competitiveness  in  the \ntransport system through restructuring and reform.  \n \n9. \nPoverty  Reduction.  ADB  focuses  on  four  issues  to  enhance  the  poverty  reduction \nimpacts of transport investments: (i) locating ADB-financed projects in less-developed and poor \nregions where new lines will stimulate economic development, (ii) encouraging maximization of \nemployment  of  poor  people  during  project  construction  and  operation,  (iii) supplying  local \nmaterials  that  meet  the  requirements  of  quality  and  economy  from  poor  villages,  and \n(iv) providing station access roads and link roads to widen project benefits to poor interior areas. \n \n10. \nGovernance and Policy Reform Agenda. The ADB policy reform agenda in the railway \nsector  is  contributing  to  restructuring  the  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR),  commercializing \noperations,  supporting  management  autonomy  of  railway  operations,  developing  human \nresources, and improving financial management and accounting systems. \n \n11. \nPromoting Private Sector Development. The PRC\u2019s large infrastructure needs require \nlocal governments to shift from traditional financing modes to the capital markets. In the railway \nsector,  a  wider  role  for  the  private  sector  is  envisaged.  MOR  has  taken  steps  to  create  the \nconditions  necessary  to  attract  investments  in  the  project  facilities  and  services  from \nnongovernment  and  private  sector  sources.  Possible  areas  include  construction  of  industrial \nsidings, commercial services, tourism, containerization, and parcel-related businesses. \n \n12. \nRegional  Cooperation.  The  PRC  is  an  active  participant  in  three  regional  cooperation \ninitiatives:  (i) through  Yunnan  province  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion,  (ii) through  the \nXinjiang  Autonomous  Region  for  the  Central  Asian  republics  initiative,  and  (iii) through  Inner \nMongolia with Mongolia. Improving the cross-border trade regimes is a common feature of these \ninitiatives.  Since  these  programs  involve  the  poorer  areas  of  the  PRC,  expanding  regional \nmarkets  and  options  could  help  reduce  poverty.  An  agreement  for  facilitating  the cross-border \nmovement  of  goods  and  people  has  been  developed  under  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion \ninitiative.  Steps  are  being  taken  to  develop  an  institutional  framework  to  facilitate  the \nimplementation  of  regional  transport  projects,  e.g.,  Uzbekistan\u2013Kyrgyz  Republic\u2013PRC  railway \ndevelopment and the Pan-Asian railway project (Singapore\u2013Kunming railway link project). \n \nD. \n \n13.  Monitoring  Targets,  Indicators,  Modality,  and  Processes.  The Government monitors \nand  evaluates  sector  performance  annually;  these  are  reviewed  through  the  process  of  the \ncountry strategy and program. Indicators for evaluating sector performance include (i) economic \ndevelopment  and  poverty  indicators  for  the  western  region,  (ii) transport  density  in  relation  to \nland  area  and  population,  (iii) public  and  private  investment  in  railways,  (iv) transport  demand \nfor freight and passengers with modal split data, (v) level of user charges (railway construction \nsurcharges, etc.), and (vi) cross-border traffic volumes with the Central Asian republics, Greater \nMekong Subregion, and Mongolia. \n \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n\n\fTable A3: Railway Sector Road Map \n \n\nIndicators \n\n \nItem \n\n1.

Part 2 helped address the areas of concern \nfor improving operation. However, this assistance was not \nsufficient to overcome problems associated with this project. \n\nLoan: The project completion report (PCR) concluded that \nthe project was successful.b Traffic exceeded forecasts, and \ncommercial operations were successful. There was rapid \neconomic growth and substantial social changes resulted in \nthe project area after project completion. Jobs created in \ntertiary industry helped women improve their social status. \nThe EA was restructured into a joint-stock company. An \nimportant lesson was to ensure appropriate capital adequacy \nfor such projects, as 100% debt financing is not financially \nsustainable. \nTA 1523: The TA supported the establishment of a market-\noriented and profit-conscious management. The \norganizational structure was rationalized, corporate \nprofitability objectives established, and associated \nmanagement policies implemented. Computerization aided \nmanagement and financial decision making. \nTA 1524: The TA helped identify railway projects for \ndevelopment of unserved areas. Some have been built. \n\nLoan: The PCR rated the project successful.c Commercial \noperation started 1 year ahead of schedule. Traffic and \nrevenues exceeded forecasts. The railway had a substantial \nsocioeconomic impact.d Incomes and living standards in the \nproject area were raised and poverty reduced after project \ncompletion. Employment creation in the service industry \nincreased opportunities for women. Debt-servicing problems \nresulting from 100% debt financing were addressed by \nfinancial restructuring. Based on the successful financial \nperformance, the Guang-Mei-Shan Railway Company raised \n$510 million through an initial public offering on the New \nYork Stock Exchange in 1996.  \nTA 1720: Finance and marketing functions were \nstrengthened, and computer applications developed to \nimprove management information systems.

The lessons learned were: \n(i) undercapitalization led to high, short-term debt financing; \n(ii) traffic forecasts need to be prepared considering \nalternative routes; and (iii) tariffs should consider those on \nalternative railways. Since 2003, the traffic has increased \nsubstantially.  \nTA 1861: The TA helped the railway company improve \ncommercial orientation and knowledge of market-oriented \nbusinesses. The railway company was assisted in \nforecasting financial performance during 1999\u20132003.

The project helped stimulate economic growth in \nthe project area, particularly in the poverty counties in \nJiangxi province. Per capita income increased substantially \nand poverty incidence fell. This project also highlighted the \nneed to forecast freight traffic more accurately than it did. \n\nTA: The TA study concluded that (i) a separate entity for \ncommercial operation of the JJR is not desirable as it would \nplace the JJR at a competitive disadvantage; and (ii) the \noperation should be integrated with the national network. \nThe proposal for a higher tariff for the north-south corridor, \nincluding the JJR, was put into effect.  \n\nLoan: Located in a poor area, the project had a delayed start \ndue to the administrative separation of Sichuan province and \nChongqing municipality.

The  national \nnetwork  will  encompass  5,000  route-kilometers  (km)  by  2010  and  12,000  route-km  by  2020 \nalong four east-west and four north-south directions, incorporating cutting-edge technologies in \nsignaling,  telecommunications,  automatic  train  control  systems,  and  safety  equipment.  ZXR  is \nalso  an  integral  part  of  the  key  railway  corridor  connecting  western  and  central  PRC  with \neastern  and  coastal  regions  of  the  country.  The  configuration  and  operational  strategy  of  the \nZXR Project shows that appropriately this is a corridor development project. The activities under \nthe  Project  will  enhance  the  capacity  for  railway  transportation  for  both  passenger  trains  and \nfreight  trains  along  the ZXR  corridor,  which  comprises  the  existing  mixed  service  Zhengzhou\u2013\nXi\u2019an section (Zhengxi) of the Longhai railway and the new passenger-dedicated ZXR line. \n\n2. \nFreight  traffic  for  the  Longhai  railway  line  was  forecast  by  commodity  (i.e.,  coal, \npetroleum products, iron and steel, fertilizers, intermodal containers, and other commodities) in \ntwo  categories  differentiated  by  their  economic  impact:  (i)  traffic  diverted  from  other  modes, \nmainly  from  other  national  railway  routes  and  roads,  based  on  an  assessment  of  the  relative \nservice and cost competitiveness of the Zhengxi; and (ii) generated traffic that would only move \nbecause  of  the  additional  freight-carrying  capacity  created  on  Zhengxi  by  shifting  existing \npassenger  trains  to  ZXR.  The  traffic  forecast  was  based  on  a  three-tier  analysis:  (i)  national \ntransport  demand  based  on  historical  trends;  (iii)  national  railway  traffic  demand  based  on \ncommodity-specific  analysis  for  major  commodities  currently  using  and  expected  to  use  the \nexisting  Zhengxi  section  of  the  Longhai  railway;  and  (iv)  Zhengxi  section  traffic  projections \nbased  on  the  railway  investment  strategy  (RIS-III)  model  of  the  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR).1 \nTraffic  projections  considered  expected  economic  growth,  population  increase,  tourism \ndevelopment potential, local government development plans, market surveys, and assessments \nof technical assistance (TA) consultants and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) mission. The \nfreight volume on the Zhengxi section is forecast to increase from about 16.14 billion ton-km in \n2011 to 49.02 billion ton-km in 2031, with average annual growth rate of 5.7%. Passenger traffic \nwas forecast based on similar factors, with a particular focus on tourism development potential.2 \nPassenger  traffic  is  forecast  to  grow  from  15.65  billion  passenger-km  in  2011  to  50.37  billion \npassenger-km in 2031, with an average annual growth rate of 6.0% (Table A13.1). \n\n3. \nTransportation  improvements  will  facilitate  the  development  of  natural  resources  and \nassociated industries. Local governments are seeking private sector companies to invest in their \nareas,  particularly  in  manufacturing  and  tourism.  Freight  and  passenger  traffic  forecasts  are \nconsidered  reasonable  given  that  (i)  the  Zhengxi  section  of  the  Longhai  railway  is  currently \nhighly congested with a traffic density of 120.27 million traffic units (ton-km+passenger-km) per \nkm, four times the average national railway\u2019s density of 30.18 million traffic units per km, which \nin itself is the highest traffic density in the PRC; (ii) railways in the PRC have experienced high \nannual  traffic  growth  with  recent  rates  higher  than  the  assumed  growth  rates  for  freight  and \npassenger traffic; (iii) the Project is a critical link connecting western PRC with the east, as well \nas  serving  as  a  gateway  to  the  PRC-Eurasian  rail  network  for  intermodal  transport;3 and  (iv) \n\n                                                 \n1  This  model,  developed  with  assistance  of  the  World  Bank,  is  a  sophisticated  tool  to  analyze  forecast  modal  split \nand  network  flows  in  the  PRC  based  on  a  variety  of  factors,  including  capacity,  socioeconomic  variables,  and \ncosts. \n\n2  The ZXR passes through areas recognized as the \u201cCradle of Ancient China,\u201d and includes temples, grottos, tombs, \n\nand other relics from the ancient dynasties dating back 3,000 years.  \n\n3   An International Union of Railways (UIC)-sponsored protocol was executed by 26 nations in Washington on 8 April \n2005 to establish seamless rail transport service between the PRC and Europe with onward trans-Atlantic marine \nservice to the eastern United States. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n45 \n\nfreeing  up  transport  capacity  on  the  Zhengxi  section  will  result  in  substantially  more  traffic  for \nboth passenger and freight transport.  \n\nEconomic Evaluation \n\nB. \n \n4. \nCost.  The  economic  evaluation  is  based  on  a  comparison  of  with-  and  without-project \nscenarios, using constant 2005 economic prices. The project benefits and cost were revalued in \neconomic  prices  by  separating  the  cost  items  into  tradable  materials  and  equipment, \nnontradable materials, labor, and land. The prices were expressed in CNY using the domestic \nprice  numeraire  with  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.01  for  foreign  exchange  effects.  A \nshadow price was used to put an economic value on the wages paid to unskilled labor, but not \non wages for skilled labor since no clear surplus of skilled workers exists. A shadow wage rate \nfactor  of  0.67  was  used  to  convert  the  financial  wage  rate  to  an  economic  opportunity  cost  of \nlabor. \n \n5. \nBenefits.  The  economic  benefits  consist  of  (i)  passenger  and  freight  transport  cost \nsavings  to  passengers  and  freight  shippers,  respectively,  for  diverted  freight  and  passenger \ntraffic; (ii) generated passenger transport benefits estimated by the difference in economic cost \nof railway and bus transport; (iii) time savings in diverted passenger and freight traffic based on \nthe value of time estimated from the net income of local residents and average value of freight; \n(iv) net economic value calculated on the basis of the economic value per additional ton of each \ncommodity of generated traffic as a result of the construction of the ZXR; (v) net economic value \nof  generated  tourist  days  by  estimating  the  number  of  tourists  and  average  expenditure,  and \nconsidering  the  cost  of  providing  the  tourist  services;  and  (vi)  avoided  road  construction  and \nmaintenance  costs,  accident  costs, and  shipper  savings  due  to  increased  railway  competition. \nThe salvage value was calculated based on the economic life of each project component. \n \n6. \nAlternative Analysis. Alternative transport modes and designs, particularly roads, were \nassessed  to  determine  the  least-cost  option  to  provide  sufficient  capacity  to  cater  to  the \nexpected  demand.  Building  an  electrified  double-track  railway  in  this  corridor  was  considered \nviable  to  meet  the  anticipated  traffic  demand  at  this  stage,  given  the  railway  network \ndevelopment,  type  of  cargo  and  passengers,  and  energy  efficiency.  Seven  alternative \nalignments  were  subsequently  evaluated  during  the  feasibility  study  for  the  following  stations \nand sections: Zhengzhou terminal approach, Luoyang south station, line around Youguguan in \nSanmenxia,  Sanmenxia  station  location,  Caijiapo  landslide  alternatives,  Fushui\u2013Weinan  south \nroute,  and  Xi\u2019an  terminal  approach.  Criteria  adopted  included  railway  length,  cost  estimates, \nlength  and  difficulty  of  the  construction  of  bridges  and  tunnels,  construction  period,  local \ngovernment development plans, and environmental and social impacts, including resettlement. \n \n7. \nConclusion. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is 17.4% (Table \nA13.3).  Benefits  from  the  freight  traffic,  including  generated  commodity  production,  are  the \nmajor  economic  benefit  (84%),  followed  by  equal  weights  of  8%  each  for  passenger  benefits \nand  other  benefits.  Sensitivity  analysis  tested  10  scenarios  to  assess  the  robustness  of  the \nresults  of  the  economic  analysis  (Table  A13.4).  The  capital  cost  would  have  to  be  more  than \n33%  higher  than  estimated  for  the  EIRR  to  fall  below  the  cutoff  rate  of  12%.  Considering  the \nexperience  of  ADB-financed  projects  in  the  railway  sector,  this  switching  value  is  unlikely  to \noccur.  ADB-financed  railway  projects  in  the  PRC  have  not  encountered  major  cost  overruns, \nand  the  contract  prices  tend  to  be  lower  than  estimated  because  the  contracting  process  is \nbecoming increasingly competitive. The freight and passenger benefits would have to decrease \nmore than 30% and 323%, respectively to make the Project economically nonviable. A reduction \nin the generated production by 415% and a 1-year delay in completion do not affect economic \nviability.  Combinations  of  adverse  effects  of  benefits  and  costs  were  also  tested.  The  result \nshowed  that  the  Project  would  maintain  its  economic  viability  under  plausible  scenarios  of \nvariability. \n\n \n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n8. \nThe  economic  analysis  was  extended  to  quantify  project  risk  and  distribute  project  net \nbenefits among stakeholders. The risk analysis, based on the statistical method, considers the \npossible  value  for  key  variables,  including  capital  costs,  operation  and  maintenance  costs, \npassenger  traffic,  freight  traffic,  and  net  economic  value  of  generated  production;  and  the \nprobability with which they may occur. The result shows that the EIRR would exceed 12% with \n97% probability. Distribution analysis distributed project net benefits by determining the project \neffects for project beneficiaries, such as project users, labor, and government (Table A13.2). A \nlarge proportion (CNY34 billion) of net benefits will accrue to the project users. \n\n \nTable A13.1: Traffic Forecast \n2011\n\n2016\n\n2021\n\n50.19\n16.14\n\n74.92\n24.09\n\n97.62\n31.40\n\n

\n\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND ANALYSIS \n \n\nFinancial Projections \n\nThe  projected  financial  statements  of  the  proposed  Zhengzhou\u2013Xian  Railway  (ZXR) \n1. \nProject were prepared in current terms for 2006\u20132031. Construction will be completed in August \n2011;  the  trial  operation  will  follow;  and  the  first  full  year  of  full  operation  will  be  2012.  The \nforeign  and  local  inflation  rates  are  assumed  at  2%  and  3%  during  the  projection  period.  The \ncost  estimates  are  presented  in  current  terms  taking  into  account  the  potential  impacts  of \ndomestic and international inflation. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nOperating  revenues  from  tariffs  are  projected  based  on  forecast  of  future  traffic  and  a \nbase average tariff rate of CNY0.27 per passenger per kilometer.1 A set of tariffs was devised, \nbased  on  full  cost  recovery  plus  an  adequate  return  on  equity,  to  achieve  close  to  optimum \nfinancial  and  economic  performance  of  A  and  B  classes  of  trains  operating  for  the  transit, \ninterline, and local traffic with due consideration of affordability2 (Table A14.1). The tariff charges \nare assumed to increase in current terms once every 5 years to keep up with about two thirds of \ninflation  (10%  increase  in  5  years).  No  real  increase  in  tariffs  will  occur  over  the  Project\u2019s  life \nspan.  Other  revenues,  including  loading  and  unloading,  warehouse  storage,  parcel  service  in \nthe train stations, amounts to 4.5% of passenger revenue.  \n \n\nTrain Type \n\nTable A14.1 Proposed Tariff for ZXR (Unit: CNY/pkm) \nLocal \nTraffic \n0.20 \n0.15 \n\nInterline \nTraffic \n0.33 \n0.25 \n\nTransit \nTraffic \n0.38 \n0.30 \n\nClass A \nClass B \n\n \n \n\n  CNY = yuan, pkm = passenger-kilometer, ZXR = Zhengzhou-Xi\u2019an Railway. \n  Sources: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n \n \n3. \nAnnual  incremental  operating  costs  are  estimated  based  on  2005  prices  as  follows:  (i) \nfixed cost CNY4.1 million per train-kilometer (km); fixed cost is assumed to rise at a growth rate \nof 3% in real terms; (ii) passenger variable cost of CNY0.06 per passenger-km, and increase in \nline with passenger traffic flows; (iii) estimated cost of dry lease of rolling stock is CNY8.6 per \ntrain-km3; and (iv) other nonoperating expenses are assumed at CNY0.025 per passenger-km. \nAll incremental operating costs are projected to increase annually in line with domestic inflation \nrates. In addition, periodic track-laying maintenance will be required after 10 years of operation \nat  a  cost  of  CNY4.6  million  per  track-km  in  2005  prices,  electric  power  and  traction  will  be \nreplaced after 15 years of operation at a cost of CNY1,553 million in 2005 prices, and signal and \ncommunication  will  be  purchased  after  20  years  of  operation  at  a  cost  of  CNY2,727  million  in \n2005 prices.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Comparable with the existing bus fare of CNY0.28/pkm.  \n2   The low fare structure for local service will also substantially benefit the people living in the project area. \n3   Rolling stock costs are estimated by the Ministry of Railways at CNY8 billion for equipment intended for use in the \nnational dedicated passenger network. This equipment consists of a fleet of electrical multiple units (EMUs), which \nwill not be specifically assigned to the ZXR. MOR will separately finance the procurement of EMUs and charge a \nfee based on train-kilometer (km) to ZXR and other passenger railways. The per-km rate will be based on dry-lease \nterms and will include depreciation charges (5% per year) and 6% return on investment \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n49 \n\nFinancial Analysis  \n\nThe accounts receivable turnover period is assumed at 0.5 month of the annual revenue \n4. \nand  2  months  of  the  total  working  expenses  for  accounts  payable.  The  Project  Company  will \nemploy 3,509 employees (7.24 per km) compared with 25 per km for the Ministry of Railways \n(MOR). The average annual average wages and other costs are CNY 30,000.  \n \n5. \nDepreciation is calculated on a straight line depreciation method with an average life of \nabout 65 years for the main railway structure, 10 years for the track-laying component, 15 years \nfor  electric  power  and  traction,  and  20  years  for  signal  and  communications.  The  weighted \naverage depreciation value is 2.2% per year. Applicable business taxes at a grossed up rate of \n3.24% are charged on revenue. Corporate income tax at 33% is paid on income after deducting \nbusiness  taxes,  depreciation  and  interest  charges,  operating  expenses,  and  any  prior  year \nlosses carried forward.  \n \n6. \nThe  Project  will  be  funded  50%  by  equity  or  grants  and  50%  by  long-term  loans.  The \nChina Development Bank (CDB) loan will be repayable over 20 years, including a 6-year grace \nperiod. The ADB loan will have a 26-year maturity, including a 6-year grace period, and be a US \ndollar LIBOR-based loan with a 0.75% commitment fee.  \n \n7. \nProjected  financial  statements  are  presented  in  Table  A14.2.  The  projected  financial \nstatements  indicate  that  the  forecast  revenue  under  the  base  assumptions  are  sufficient  to \ncover annual recurrent costs, depreciation, debt repayments on the ADB and CDB  loans, and \ngenerate reasonable profits from the railway operation upon the first full year of operation. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nThe major assumptions used for calculation of a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \nare (i) all calculations are based on 2005 prices, covering 2006\u20132031; (ii) capital costs include \nall  incremental  capital  expenditures  related  to  construction  and  equipment  for  the  railway,  but \nexclude  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction;  (iii)  operation  costs  include  all \nannual incremental expenses incurred in operating the project railway, but exclude depreciation \nand debt repayment provisions; (iv) operating revenues from tariff used in financial projections \nare  adjusted  to  2005  prices;  (v)  the  residual  value  equal  to  undepreciated  value  of  capital \ninvestment is included as a benefit of the FIRR calculation.  \n \n9. \nThe  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC),  after-tax,  in  real  terms  was \ncalculated  using  estimated  capital  mix  and  cost  of  funds.  Costs  have  been  considered  as \nfollows: (i) the applicable 10-year LIBOR (London interbank offered rate) fixed swap rate plus a \nprovision  for  ADB\u2019s  spread  of  0.6%  is  used  for  ADB  debt,  (ii)  the  estimated  interest  costs  of \n5.51% per annum is used for the domestic loan funds; and (iii) the cost of equity was assumed \nto  be  8%.  The  cost  of  debt  is  also  adjusted  to  reflect  the  impact  of  income  tax  of  33%.  The \nnominal cost of debt is converted to the real cost of debt by applying domestic and international \naverage inflation rate for local currency and foreign exchange denominated debt respectively.  \n \n10 \nThe  FIRR  for  the  Project,  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  is  7%,  which  compares \nfavorably  with  the  WACC,  computed  at  an  after-tax  basis  of  3%  (Table  A14.3).  The  Project  is \nconsidered both financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity tests indicate conditions causing \nthe Project's viability to fall below the WACC are unlikely to occur. The sensitivity of the Project's \nfinancial indicators to cost and revenue variations is shown in Table A14.4. \n \n\n \n \n\n\f    Less: Business and other

RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n\n \n1. \nThe  project  railway  alignment  is  459  kilometers  (km)  long  and  will  cross  170  rural \nvillages and 13 urban village neighborhoods in 19 counties and urban districts from Zhengzhou \nin  Henan  province  to  Xi\u2019an  in  Shaanxi  province.  The  resettlement  plan  (RP)  addresses \npermanent  and  temporary  impacts  caused  by  the  Project,  including  the  railway  alignment, \nstation  sites,  station  access  roads,  and  related  construction  activities.  An  estimated  1,782 \nhectares  (ha)  of  land  will  be  permanently  acquired,  of  which  about  63%  is  currently  under \ncultivation, 8% orchard, 11% housing plots, 2% forest, 4% grassland, and 12% wasteland. The \nnumber of affected people in terms of loss of land is equivalent to 16,147, assuming total loss of \ncultivated  land  based  on  average  per  capita  landholdings.  The  Project  will  also  temporarily \nrequire an estimated 596 ha. About 1,682,392 square meters (m2) of structures will be affected, \nof which 79% are residential. Relocation of 29,774 people will be required. The Project will also \nrequire 46,426 m2 of schools and 302,087 m2 of factories and other enterprises to be relocated. \nThe  total  number  of  people  directly  affected  is  estimated  at  36,736.  A  summary  of  the \nresettlement impacts are shown in Table A15.1. Land acquisition and resettlement impacts were \nminimized  by  aligning  the  railway  away  from  urban  areas,  village  centers,  and  other  facilities, \nwhere possible, based on consultations with communities. \n \n2. \nThe  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR)  in  consultation  with  provincial  and  local  governments \nprepared the RP based on the preliminary design study, village surveys of all 170 rural villages \nand 13 village urban neighborhoods; 2,354 household surveys; provincial, prefecture, and local \ngovernment  statistics;  and  consultations  with  local  officials,  village  leaders,  and  affected \nhouseholds.  The  resettlement  objective  is  to  ensure  that  compensation  and  entitlements \nprovided  to  affected  people  are  adequate  to  at  least  maintain  their  without-project  standard  of \nliving, with prospects of improvement, in line with the Land Administration Law (1998) and Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  (1995).  People  losing  land, \nhousing,  other  assets,  or  other  means  of  production  will  be  compensated  at  replacement  cost \nand assisted in restoring their incomes and living standards. In 2004, the PRC Constitution was \namended  to  ensure  that  people  are  compensated  according  to  law  for  land  expropriated  for \npublic  projects,  and  the  State  Council  issued  Decree  No.  28  on  Further  Reform  to  Strictly \nImplement Land Administration, which requires public consultation with affected people prior to \napproval  of  projects,  maintenance  of  the  living  standard  of  affected  people,  strengthened \nmonitoring  procedures,  public  accounting  of  the  receipt  and  distribution  of  resettlement  funds, \nand distribution of compensation for land loss principally to affected people.  \n \nThe  RP  stipulates  eligibility/entitlement  provisions  for  affected  people.1 Permanent  land \n3. \nlosses  will  be  compensated  by  land  reallocation  or  by  cash  payments.  Each  rural  village  will \nutilize  the  land  compensation  and  resettlement  subsidy  for  income  restoration.  The  main \nstrategies for income restoration include land readjustment, improvement of irrigation systems, \ndevelopment of animal husbandry and cash crops, small business development, and migration \nto urban centers for employment. Compensation for temporary land loss will be paid directly to \npeople affected to offset any income loss; also, the land will be restored to its original state after \nuse. Compensation for rural housing losses will be paid directly to those affected at replacement \ncost,  free  of  demolition  expenses  and  salvaged  materials.  The  affected  rural  houses  will  be \nrebuilt in scattered locations within the existing village, so minimal site development is required. \nBetter road access and provision of site leveling, water supply, electricity, telephone, and cable \nwill  be  provided.  Crop  and  tree  losses  will  be  directly  paid  to  those  affected  and  used  at  their \ndiscretion.  Urban  households,  factories,  schools  and  other  institutions,  and  enterprises  will  be \npaid  compensation  at  market  rates  for  relocation  and  reconstruction.  Urban  households  can \n                                                 \n1   A detailed entitlement matrix is included in Table 5-5 of the Resettlement Plan (RP).  \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nselect new housing, which is widely available. Most factories will only suffer partial impacts and \ncontinue operations at the same site. For factories required to relocate, each owner will prepare \na relocation plan, which includes restoration of livelihoods and incomes for all workers. Schools \nand  other  institutions  will  be  rebuilt  based  on  the  plans  of  local  government,  to  ensure  that \nservice levels are maintained or improved. \n \n4. \nThe  resettlement  impacts  for  the  railway  project  are  spread  thinly  over  a  long,  narrow \ncorridor.  Investigations  showed  that  income  loss  from  land  acquisition  is  less  severe  because \nthis  corridor  is  developing  rapidly  and  at  least  70%  of  net  income  for  more  than  half  of  rural \nhouseholds comes from nonagricultural employment and small businesses. Special assistance \nwill be provided to any seriously affected villages and groups, especially vulnerable households \nthat  include  the  poor,  widows,  and  disabled.  Special  measures  will  also  be  provided  for  any \naffected  ethnic  minority  households.  Ethnic  minorities  account  for  0.65%  of  the  population  of \naffected villages and village-level urban units on the alignment, most are Hui. \n \n5. \nLocal  government  land  administration  bureaus  will  be  responsible  for  implementing \nresettlement;  many  activities  will  be  carried  out  by  township  officials  and  village  committees. \nMOR  and  the  local  governments  have  extensive  experience  with  resettlement.  As  a  standard \nprocedure,  local  government  will  provide  training  to  local  officials  who  will  be  involved  in \nimplementation. The training will focus on ADB requirements, as specified in the RP, and new \nprocedures  related  to  State  Council  Decree  No.  28.  Affected  people  have  been  informed  and \nconsulted about  project  impacts,  and  resettlement  policies  and  entitlements  at  various  stages. \nDuring  the  preliminary  design  stage,  stakeholders  consulted  included  heads  of  affected \nhouseholds;  village  heads  and  representatives;  local  government  agencies  and  departments; \nand  vulnerable  groups,  including  women  and  ethnic  minorities.  Resettlement  information \nbooklets  were  distributed  to  affected  villages  in  April  2005.  Affected  households  will  also  be \nconsulted  and  can  participate  in  resettlement  activities,  including  the  detailed  measurement \nsurvey, location of underpasses, new housing sites, and grievance redress. \n \n6. \nThe  estimated  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  cost  is  $181.4  million,  excluding  the \ncosts for enterprise relocation and infrastructure to be relocated.2 In December 2004, MOR and \nHenan and Shaanxi provincial governments signed agreements whereby the local governments \nwill fund 100% of the cost of land acquisition and resettlement, which in turn will be an equity \ncontribution  to  the  Project.  The  resettlement  budget  will  be  adjusted  based  on  the  actual \nmeasurement  of  physical  losses  and  market  prices.  The  RP  will  be  updated  by  local \ngovernments to include (i) final compensation standards and rates that conform to Decree No. \n28, (ii) refined impact figures based on detailed design, (iii) rehabilitation plans for any seriously \naffected  villages,  and  for  enterprises  to  be  relocated,  (iv)  detailed  budgets  for  each \nprovince/municipality;  and  (v)  an  updated  implementation  schedule.  This  updated  RP  will  be \ndisclosed to affected people, and submitted to ADB for approval prior to the commencement of \nland acquisition and demolition, which is anticipated in September 2005. \n \n7. \nMOR  and  municipal  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  offices,  in  collaboration  with  the \ncounty  resettlement  offices,  will  be  responsible  for  internal  supervision  and  monitoring  of \ncompensation  payments,  house  rebuilding/relocation  for  affected  people,  land  redistribution, \nand  grievance  redress.  MOR  will  prepare  progress  reports  and  submit  them  to  ADB  on  a \nquarterly  basis,  until  resettlement  is  completed.  MOR  will  then  prepare  a  resettlement \ncompletion report for submission to ADB. In addition, MOR will contract an independent monitor \n\n                                                 \n2   The  latest  resettlement  cost  is  estimated  at  $240  million  including  the  costs  for  enterprise  and  infrastructure \nrelocation  and  the  contingences;  this  increase  is  well  within  the  contingency  amount  included  in  the  project  cost \nestimates. The resettlement cost will be finalized in the updated RP. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n55 \n\nto  carry  out  the  external  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  tasks  include  (i)  conduct  baseline \nsurvey;  (ii)  review  and  verify  the  compensation  payments,  status  of  land  acquisition  and \ncompensation  payments;  (iii)  assessment  of  grievance  redress  procedures,  affected  people's \nreaction/satisfaction,  and  restoration  of  livelihoods;  and  (iv)  compile  lessons  learned  for  future \nresettlement  planning.  The  external  monitor  will  prepare  monitoring  reports  for  submission  to \nMOR  and  ADB  every  6  months  until  completion  of  resettlement  activities;  thereafter,  annual \nevaluation investigations will be conducted for at least 2 years and reported to MOR and ADB. \n \n\nTable A15.1: Summary of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n\n \nImpact \n No. of counties/districts crossed  \n No. of townships crossed \n No. of urban street units crossed \n No. of rural villages crossed \nA.

 \n\n Yes \n  No \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?  \n\n Yes \n No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \nImproved railway transport will provide an enabling condition for poverty reduction through improved access to markets, \nemployment, advanced education and medical facilities, new knowledge and information, families working or studying \nin  other  regions,  and  other  social  and  economic  services;  and  will  facilitate  economic  development  and  job  creation. \nImproved access to markets opens up opportunities for expansion of locally produced goods and services. Construction \nand  operation  of  the  railway  generates  additional  employment  opportunities  in  local  communities,  providing  an \nadditional source of income for people, including poor households in the project area. Incoming passengers and tourists \ngenerate  additional  demand  for  locally  produced  goods  and  services.  In  addition,  local  government  construction  of \naccess and connector roads for railway construction and development of local roads from the stations to all levels of the \nroad network and poor villages will help to extend the project benefits and opportunities to rural poor communities by \nimproving local infrastructure; reducing transport costs; increasing access to markets, employment, and other economic \nand social services; and improving conditions for economic growth shared by the poor. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                      Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe  alignment  is  more  developed  than  many  similarly  mountainous  parts  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC). \nHowever, many villages located in the mountains have been isolated from these developments, and remain very poor \nwith intransient poverty. The links between poverty, topography, and transport systems are apparent in the project area. \nThe main causes of poverty in the project areas are (i) natural calamity, (ii) lack of infrastructure, (iii) very limited and \nunsustainable  source  of  livelihood,  (vi)  uneven  economic  development,  and  (v)  poor  health.  The  Project  will  benefit \nabout 9.3 million people. About 90.2% are rural (17 counties) and 15% are poor  with a net income per capita of less \nthan CNY900 in 2004. In urban areas (2 counties), 5.8% are poor with a less than per capita income of minimum living \nstandards.1 This means about 14% of the total population are poor in the project area. The railway passes through19 \ncounties,  6  are  designated  as  national  and  provincial  poverty  counties,  and  725  designated  poverty  villages. \nApproximately 1.3 million poor individuals are resident in the area, about 0.65% are ethnic minorities.  \n \nAbout 353,000 person-years of work will be created during railway construction, 60% will be unskilled work. Half of the \nunskilled  work  will  be  targeted  for  the  poor,  totaling  105,920  person-years  at  total  wages  of  CNY1,037  million  or \nCNY9,790 per person-year. Priority will be given to women, resettlement-affected people, and other vulnerable people. \nIn  addition,  during  construction,  6,249  person-years  of  local  jobs  will  be  created  in  the  provision  of  construction \nmaterials  with  total  wages  of  CNY61.4  million,  of  which  1,875  person-years  will  be  for  the  poor,  with  total  wages  of \nCNY18.4  million  or  annual  average  wage  of  CNY9,828  per  capita.  When  the  operation  of  the  new  railway  starts, \napproximately 2,988 additional jobs will be created with total wages of CNY53.7 million annually for CNY1344.5 million \nduring  the  25-year  operation  period.  An  estimated  tax  revenue  from  the  Project  to  counties  in  the  project  areas  is \nCNY714  million.  This  added  revenue  will  be  used  for  a  range  of  poverty  reduction  and  social  activities  including \nmitigation of negative impacts on HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome and \nSTIs  (sexually  transmitted  infections),  human  trafficking,  and  the  environment,  with  special  attention  to  resettlement-\naffected  groups,  women,  ethnic  groups  and  other  vulnerable  people  in  the  project  area.  The  Project\u2019s  10  railway \nstations,  which will be connected to all levels of road network accessible by all villages including the poor,  will create \nvarious  jobs,  and  help  distribute  the  benefits  in  the  project  area.  Sufficient  space  will  be  provided  in  and  around  the \nstations for local area development; the poor, women, ethnic groups and other vulnerable people will be supported by \nlocal governments to sell local specialties and other goods and services. All of these direct and indirect impacts of the \nProject  will  provide  conditions  for  the  country\u2019s  goal  of  micro-urbanization  for  poor  families  to  (i)  move  away  from \nunsustainable,  mountainous  farmlands;  (ii)  have  better  access  to  markets,  and  advanced  educational  and  health \nfacilities  especially  for  pregnant  women;  and  (iii)  build  a  sustainable  future  in  new  centers  of  economic  activity,  and \ncomplement the poverty reduction activities of local governments to achieve the goal, such as assisting the poor with \nurban migration, relocation, employment, local economic development, farmer-based rural tourism, agricultural product \ndevelopment,  and  health  and  physical  infrastructure  and  natural  resources  improvement. These  concerted  efforts  will \npromote progress in attaining the Millennium Development Goals, especially goals 1 and 3\u20137.  \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nVarious  public  consultation  and  participation  activities  for  the  Project  have  been  conducted  and  the  role  of  each \nstakeholder is identified. MOR, Fourth Survey Design Institute, the project preparation technical assistance consultants \nand ADB mission have had formal and informal consultations with local communities and government agencies through \nmeetings,  surveys,  household  interviews,  written  communications,  workshops,  and  such,  involving  about  10,000 \npeople. The local county and township governments and communities will assist MOR in acquiring land, implementing \nthe resettlement plan (RP), and organizing local labor for construction and local development including the station area \nto ensure the participation and benefit of the poor, women, and other vulnerable people. \n                                                 \n1   2003 data were used: annual per capita income in Henan, CNY1,145, and in Shaanxi, CNY1,566. \n \n\n  No  \n\n Yes\n\n\f58       Appendix 16 \n\n  No \n\n  Yes        \n\nIs there a participation strategy? \nThe participation of local people will be central for improving their opportunities to benefit from the Project. Local groups \nand relevant government agencies will continue to be involved in the consultation and participation process, especially \nduring  the  implementation  of  the  environmental  impact  assessment  and  RP.  Railway  construction  support  offices  are \nbeing set up in each project county, and will have copies of all relevant documents. During construction and operation, \nthey  will  serve  as  a  key  coordinating  point  to  enhance  stakeholder  participation,  including  the  poor,  women,  ethnic \ngroups, and other vulnerable people. A leading group will be formed in each prefecture in the project area among the \nrelevant government agencies at different levels including village groups; poverty reduction offices; All-China Women\u2019s \nFederation; and health, civil affairs, and ethnic affairs bureaus to continue the process of consultation and participation \nand to coordinate activities by various agencies to ensure local benefits. A social development action plan (SDAP) was \nprepared and will increase participation of local people in project activities and benefits. \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nAnalyses  of  gender-disaggregated  data  and  discussions  with  representatives  of  the  All-China  Women\u2019s  Federation \nindicate that women will need some assistance to fully benefit from the Project. Data collected indicate the following: (i) \nwomen primarily engage in agricultural activities; and (ii) male members from poor households tend to travel further for \nmigrant  labor  opportunities  than  nonpoor  males,  leaving  behind  a  high  percentage  of  households  headed  by  women. \nThe construction of the railway will create opportunities for local area development by (i) facilitating flow of materials and \ninformation into the area, and (ii) accelerating development of local industry and tourism. Many of the service sector jobs \nwill  favor  women  employees.  The  All-China  Women\u2019s  Federation  will  provide  business  management  and  financial \nassistance to women interested in setting up small businesses to serve construction crews and growing tourist sector  \n \nPoverty and social enhancement measures have been built into the project design, and special mitigation (or protection) \nactions have been included in the RP. For example, members of the community  will collectively decide where schools \nwill  be  relocated.  Women,  especially  female  heads  of  household,  will  be  consulted  as  schools  provide  an  informal \nsource  of  day  care  for  their  children.  Poor  women  will  receive  assistance  so  that  their  children  can  remain  in  school, \nfreeing women\u2019s time during the day to work. Widows will be eligible for special assistance during land acquisition and \nresettlement.  Women  will  be  given  priority  for  project-generated  employment  during  construction  and  operation  of  the \nrailway.  The  rise  in  female  participation  in  the  labor  force  and  tourism  market  will  increase  women\u2019s  net  income,  thus \nimproving overall family welfare, and increasing the status of women. \nHas an output been prepared? \nE.

The existing line will continue to offer low fare transportation \nfor passengers and goods. Congestion will be reduced on existing \nlines, making it more efficient and useful for low income users.  \nRailway construction and measures to include tourist-related \nconcessions stalls at stations will generate considerable \nemployment for the poor in the project area. During operation, \ndevelopment of the industry and tourism sectors will generate \nadditional employment opportunities for the poor.  \nEthnic minorities make up 0.65% of the population in the project \narea; 83% are Hui. Some will be affected by land acquisition. Other \nethnic groups include Uygur, Mongol, and Man, but they are not \nadversely affected. Impacts and special measures for the Hui are \nincluded in the RP, and enhancement measures are in the SDAP. \nHIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking Awareness and Prevention: The \nrailway will increase the mobility of goods and people along the \nroute, and could increase risks of HIV/AIDS, STI, and human \ntrafficking among local communities, especially women. The local \ndepartments of health, civil affairs bureau and other relevant \nagencies will coordinate with the construction contractors in \ndelivering HIV/AIDS, STI and human trafficking prevention \ninformation, voluntary counseling and testing, condoms, HIV testing \nkits, and STI treatment packages; and strictly follow the relevant \nPRC laws and regulations on prevention of these issues. The \nprovincial governments have an active HIV/AIDS awareness and \nprevention program and MOR has experience in this area.  \n\nPlan \nRequired \n Full \n Short \n None  \n\n Yes \n No \n\n Yes \n No  \n\n Yes \n No  \n\n Yes \n No  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nProposed Actions \n\nTargets \n\nSOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ACTION PLAN \n\nTiming \n\n2006\u2013\n2009 \n\nFunding \nSource \n\nLocal \ngovernments \n\nA.
