The  Project  will  build  on  the  outputs  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)-assisted  Skills  Development  Project \n(SDP),  particularly  the  national  vocational  qualifications  (NVQ) \nframework. \n \nThe Project will develop new technician diploma programs within \nthe NVQ framework and upgrade six technical colleges (TCs) to \nCoTs  in  six  out  of  nine  provinces  to  conduct  the  programs. \nThe Project will strengthen MSDVTE and relevant institutions so \nthey  can  facilitate,  support,  and  ensure  quality,  efficient,  and \nsustainable TEVT, focusing on NVQ levels 5\u20137. The Project will \nhelp the Government establish Univotec, which will address the \nshortage of technologists and qualified instructors for TEVT, and \nprovide an alternative education and career pathway for students \nand TEVT sector personnel, leading to a degree. The Project will, \namong others, develop degree programs leading to a bachelor of \ntechnical education (B.Tech.Ed.) and a bachelor of technology \n(B.Tech.), and upgrade the facilities and equipment of institutions \ncomprising Univotec so it can offer these programs. \n \nThe Project complements the assistance of development partners \nin upgrading TCs in other provinces to offer technician diploma \nprograms, and in establishing Univotec. \n   \n ", "iv   \nRationale  The Government is reducing unemployment and responding to \nthe changing labor market by combining short- and medium-term \nstrategies.  In  the  short  term,  the  Government  is  exploring  the \npossibility of expanding local and foreign skilled and semiskilled \nemployment while, over the medium term, according high priority \nto manufacturing-based growth with increased foreign investment. \nThis strategy requires highly trained labor, including technicians \nand technologists, who are in short supply. \n \nLocally, the supply of technicians and mid-level professionals is \nfalling short of demand, while Sri Lanka has been unable to fill a \nsignificant portion of job orders abroad for mid-level and skilled \n(and higher-wage) worker categories, whose proportion among \noverseas Sri Lankans is increasing.  \n \nDespite the large supply\u2013demand gap, unemployment, especially \namong  educated  youth,  is  high.  The  large  number  of  school \nleavers lack the skills for jobs or self-employment. These youths \ncould be employed in industry if they were trained in relevant \ntechnical and vocational skills.  \n \nTEVT at the technician and technologist levels is underdeveloped \nand cannot produce enough qualified skilled workers for either the \ndomestic or foreign market. TEVT needs to expand access to \ntraining  programs  throughout  the  country  while  increasing  the \nquality  and  market  relevance  of  its  programs;  improving  the \nqualifications and numbers of TEVT teaching-training personnel, \nparticularly for technician and technologist programs; allocating \nfinancial resources to run training programs after the Project; and \nupgrading TEVT\u2019s social image. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project will develop more mid-level and highly skilled human \nresources  to  contribute  to  economic  growth  and  social \ndevelopment.  \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  envisioned  outcome  is  improved  access  and \nstrengthened capacity of TEVT to meet labor market needs.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost is estimated at $26.7 million equivalent, \nincluding taxes, duties, interest charges on the ADB loan, and \nphysical and price contingencies. The foreign exchange cost is \nestimated at $9.9 million (37%), and the local currency cost at \n$16.8 million (63%) equivalent. The loan will cover 75% of the \ntotal project cost. ADB will fund 100% ($9.9 million) of the foreign \ncurrency  cost  and  60%  ($10.1  million  equivalent)  of  the  local \ncurrency  cost.  Interest  during  project  implementation  will  be \ncapitalized.  The  remaining  $6.7  million  equivalent  of  the  local \ncurrency cost will be provided by the Government.  \n   ", "    v\nFinancing Plan                 ($ million) \nForeign  Local  Total  Percent \nSource \nExchange  Currency  Cost \n       \nADB   9.9    10.1    20.0   75 \nGovernment   0.0    6.7    6.7   25 \nTotal   9.9    16.8    26.7   100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  SDR13,605,000  ($20 million)  equivalent  from  the \nSpecial Funds resources of ADB will be provided. The loan will \nhave a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, \nan interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan agreement. \n   \nEstimated Project  28 February 2011 \nCompletion Date \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  31 August 2011 \n   \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Skills Development, Vocational and Technical \nEducation (MSDVTE) \n   \nImplementation  A project steering committee (PSC) will direct the Project, monitor \nArrangements  its activities and outputs, guide the project implementation unit \n(PIU), and coordinate and liaise with other government agencies \nand departments. \n \nThe MSDVTE secretary will chair the PSC, whose members will \ncomprise  representatives  from  the  Ceylon\u2013German  Technical \nTraining  Institute;  Department  of  Technical  Education  and \nTraining;  National  Apprentice  and  Industrial  Training  Authority; \nNational Institute of Technical Education of Sri Lanka; Tertiary and \nVocational Education Commission; Vocational Training Authority; \nUnivotec;  Ministry  of  Education  with  responsibility  for  higher \neducation; and External Resources Department, Department of \nNational  Planning,  and  Department  of  National  Budget  of  the \nMinistry of Finance and Planning. The PSC will have at least four \nrepresentatives  from  industry  and  employers,  as  well  as  two \nrotating  representatives  of  project  CoTs.  The  SDP  PIU  will \ncontinue to exist and will be responsible to the PSC for day-to-day \nproject implementation. The PIU will be led by a project director. \n   \n   \nProcurement  ADB-financed  goods,  related  services,  and  civil  works  will  be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, \nreflecting ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and mandatory use of ADB\u2019s \nstandard bidding documents. \n   \n ", "vi   \nConsulting Services  The selection and engagement of all project-financed consulting \nservices  will  be  in  accordance  with  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection using ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic consultants. A team of consultants will provide services \nin a range of specializations, with estimated international inputs of \n99 person-months and domestic inputs of 270 person-months. \nThese services will be provided by a consulting firm and will be \nselected according to ADB guidelines. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will strengthen and expand the capacity for technician \nBeneficiaries  and technological education. The Project will raise the quality, \nrelevance, and sustainability of the programs for technicians and \ntechnologists  by  developing  training  and  program  standards; \nupgrading selected TCs to CoTs; and strengthening the capacity \nof TEVT teachers, trainers, personnel, and administrators.  \n \nThe development of the NVQ for technicians and technologists \nwill help institutionalize an alternative education and career path, \nparticularly  for  school  leavers,  in  technical  and  technology \neducation leading to a degree. Establishing a voluntary national \nassociation of TEVT providers and industry sector councils will \nincrease the market orientation of training programs.  \n \nThe  Project  will  help  reduce  high  unemployment  and \nunderemployment  among  the  educated  youth,  and  increase \naccess to postsecondary education and training by establishing \nUnivotec  and  CoTs,  and  by  upgrading  TCs  to  CoTs  outside \nColombo.  \n \nSocial marketing and career guidance will focus on promoting \ntechnology-based  employment,  increasing  public  awareness  of \ntechnological career paths, and marketing training programs to \nwomen. The introduction of new training programs, including fields \nthat  are  not  traditionally  male-oriented,  will  attract  women  to \ntechnician programs. The new degree and diploma programs will \nbe  alternative  career  options  to  fulfill  personal  aspirations  for \nhigher  education,  particularly  for  those  who  do  not  qualify  for \nuniversity admission.  \n \nCoupled  with  MSDVTE\u2019s  strengthened  capacity  to  ensure \nrelevance,  quality,  and  efficiency  of  TEVT,  technician  and \ntechnological education will create skilled workers for domestic \nindustries  and  the  foreign  labor  market.  The  direct  economic \nbenefits  are  (i)  increased  domestic  production  because  of  the \ngreater use of human  capital, which will be reflected in wage \nincreases of the graduates employed in domestic industries; and \n(ii)  increased  remittances  in  foreign  exchange  from  graduates \nemployed abroad. \n \n ", "    vii\n  Annual enrollment intake capacity of technician diploma programs \nis expected to increase by about 2,400 full-time and part-time \nstudents.  Similarly,  Univotec  is  expected  to  have  an  annual \nenrollment intake capacity of about 600 full-time and 600 part-time \nstudents in the technologist program, and about 300 full-time and \n300  part-time  students  in  the  technical  teacher  education \nprogram. Over the 15-year evaluation, about 15,300 more youths \nare expected to graduate with a B.Tech. (9,900) and a B.Tech.Ed. \n(5,400) from Univotec, and about 22,500 with CoT diplomas. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  The  political  conflict  is  a  major  risk  to  achieving  the  Project\u2019s \ngoals. Without peace and stability, the local economy may not \nadvance  and  could  cause  local  demand  for  technicians  and \ntechnologists  to  stagnate.  However,  demand  for  mid-level  and \nskilled workers overseas would remain strong. \n \nThe  turnover  of  personnel  in  MSDVTE  and  its  institutions \ncontributes to unstable, sometimes weak, TEVT leadership and \nadministration.  The    project  design  includes  strengthening  the \ncapacity  of  officials  to  ensure  continuity  in  leadership.  Private \nsector  participation  in  various  councils  will  help  them  sustain \nTEVT programs while making training programs more relevant. \n \nAs the Government provides free training programs and small \nstipends to trainees, the sustainability of the project investment \nafter implementation depends on the Government\u2019s provision of \nan adequate operation and maintenance budget. The Project will \nthus support a policy dialogue on financially sustaining project \nactivities  after  implementation.  The  capacity  of  CoT  heads  for \nstrategic  planning  to  generate  TEVT  revenues  will  be \nstrengthened.  \n \nThe implementation of TEVT loan projects suffered from, among \nothers,  delays  and  complex  problems  brought  about  by  the \ntransfer of project responsibility from one ministry to another, lack \nof counterpart funds, and slow appointment of qualified project \nstaff. The Government has reassured ADB that it is committed to \nthe  Project  and  will  allocate  the  necessary  counterpart  funds. \nThe SDP PIU staff may continue with the Project, minimizing the \nrisk of slow implementation. Qualified instructors and trainers are \nassumed to be available. The Project includes flexible upgrading \nof staff skills and knowledge. Government can hire temporary staff \nas  needed.  The  implementation  of  Univotec  activities  risks \ndelayed approval, if not non-approval, of the University Act by \nParliament. The Government has reassured ADB that it is deeply \ncommitted to support the Univotec charter. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  environmental  impacts  were  reviewed  and  no \nadverse impacts are anticipated. The Project is unlikely to trigger \nADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement  policy.  No  adverse  impacts  on \nindigenous peoples are anticipated. \n \n ", "ix \n ", "   \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Technical Education Development \nProject (the Project). \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.   Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  Sri Lanka\u2019s human development indicators are the highest in South Asia. The adult \nliteracy rate is 91%, and the net enrollment rates are 95% in the primary and 85% in the \nsecondary  grades.  Half  of  all  students  are  female.  However,  despite  these  significant \nachievements and having an educated and highly trainable population, the unemployment rate \namong those educated to general certificate of education (GCE) ordinary level (O/L) is 13% and \nto GCE advanced level (A/L) 17%, which are greater than the national average of 8.5%. Most \nSri Lankans (85%) live in rural areas. As of 2002, poverty was more prevalent in rural areas \n(25%) and in the estates (30%) than in urban areas (8%).  \n \n3.  Over 300,000 GCE O/L and GCE A/L students annually are not able to continue their \neducation because of limited places in colleges and universities.1 Grade-11 and -13 school \nleavers lack the skills to get jobs or be self-employed. Students who are unable to continue to \ngrade 12 (A/L) can directly apply for admission into technical education and vocational training \n(TEVT) programs, such as craft courses, where the entry requirement is GCE O/L pass. With \nGCE A/L examination passes in the required subjects, students can apply to programs leading \nto national diplomas and a degree in technological education. However, GCE A/L graduates are \nless likely to acquire technical skills as their goal is to acquire traditional university education \nqualifications. GCE O/L graduates are more likely to go into trades and technical training. \n \n4.  Armed  hostilities  ceased  in  2002,  increasing  political  stability  and  accelerating \nrehabilitation, reconstruction, and recovery. From negative growth in 2001, Sri Lanka posted an \nannual average of 5.1% real economic growth rate in 2002\u20132004. The four largest economic \nsectors,  by  contribution  to  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  are  trade  and  hotels, \nmanufacturing, agriculture, and transport and communications. Over the past 6 years, the share \nof agriculture has decreased while that of transport and communications has trended up. Trade \nand services has remained steady at 25.7% and manufacturing at 17.4%, and grew faster than \nthe  general  economy  in  2003\u20132004.  Sri  Lanka  receives  significant  income  in  the  form  of \nremittances from Sri Lankans working as expatriate workers\u20147.5% of GDP in 2004.  \n \n5.  As the share of agriculture shrinks, available jobs are declining and pressure is mounting \nto create jobs in other domestic sectors, which require higher skills. However, labor market data \nand projections point to short supply of technicians and associate professionals. Projections for \n2006\u20132007 indicate a total shortfall of over 14,000 positions in manufacturing, construction, \ntransport and communications, and other sectors. Abroad, competition between Sri Lankan and \ndomestic workers seems to be fierce. At the same time, Sri Lanka is unable to fill job orders for \nmid-level and highly skilled (and higher-wage) worker categories, whose share of the job orders \nis increasing. In 2003 alone, of the job orders for 20,980 skilled positions, only 8,987 were filled. \n                                                 \n1  In 2001, of the 456,829 who sat for O/L examinations, about 273,000 (60%) did not qualify to continue on to A/L \neducation. Of the 198,509 candidates who sat for the A/L examinations, 98,329 (50%) qualified for university, but \nonly 11,962 were admitted; thus, 186,547 of the A/L candidates could not proceed to university. \n ", "2   \nAbout 1 million Sri Lankans, or 15% of the employed, are abroad, most of whom are working as \nunskilled and semiskilled workers, particularly as housemaids. \n \n6.  The Government is responding to unemployment and the changing labor market by \ncombining short- and medium-term strategies. In the short term, the Government is exploring \nthe possibility of expanding skilled and semi-skilled foreign employment while, over the medium \nterm, according high priority to manufacturing-based growth with increased foreign investment. \nThis strategy requires highly trained labor, including technicians and technologists, who are in \nshort supply.  \n \nB.   Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  To meet the need for technicians and technologists and for higher education, TEVT, \nparticularly technician and technological education programs, needs to be more accessible. \nPrograms need to be of better quality, more relevant, and more sustainable, and their social \nimage must be enhanced. The TEVT sector analysis is in Appendix 1.  \n \n8.  Provision of Technical and Technological Education. Postsecondary technical and \ntechnological education is relatively underdeveloped. The large investments needed to put up \nsuch facilities hinder the establishment of more institutions, both public and private. Diploma \nprograms cater to those who have GCE A/L qualifications, with good marks in mathematics, \nphysics, and chemistry. These programs are 3\u20134 years long, including on-the-job training. \nDiploma programs in technical and technological education are conducted by at least four \nrecognized institutions, all clustered in Colombo and not accessible to many potential student-\ntrainees. These programs are funded by the Government and include nominal daily allowances \nto  students.  Although  training  institutions  outside  Colombo  do  not  offer  technician-  and \ntechnology-related diploma programs, some technical colleges (TCs) can be upgraded to do so. \nThere are 37 TCs throughout the country\u2019s nine provinces. \n \n9.  Excluding the Open University of Sri Lanka, institutions offering technician programs in \n2003 took in about 700 students-trainees and graduated 563 technicians. The technologist \nprogram is offered by the university and, in 2002 and 2003, took in a total of 522 students and \ngraduated  29.  The  numbers  of  graduates  are  much  lower  than  the  local  labor  market \nrequirements  for  technicians  and  higher-level  skills,  not  to  mention  overseas  demand  for \ntechnicians.  The  training  output  for  higher-level  technical  skills  is  disproportionately  low \ncompared to the enrollment in craft and operator courses, or a ratio of about 1:50 to craft skills, \nwhich is far from the normal proportion (1:5 to 1:10). Capacity to develop higher-level technical \nskills  is  low  and  cannot  respond  to  private  sector  requirements  and  global  competition.  \nThe development and promotion of the technical education system must be accelerated. \n \n10.  Technician  Standards  and  Quality  Assurance  Mechanisms.  There  are  no \noperational program standards for technicians that can be used as curriculum bases in TEVT \ninstitutions; there are also no institutional standards for TEVT institutions, private or public. \nLevels 5\u20137 of the national vocational qualifications (NVQ) framework are yet to be developed. \nQuality assurance mechanisms for the technician and technologist programs need to be put in \nplace. Although there is a registration system for training providers, it requires refinement and \nwider implementation. The Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC), which is \nmandated to provide quality assurance to the TEVT system, needs to be strengthened in audit \nof programs and institutions to ensure that they comply with TEVT accreditation standards.  \n \n11.  When  they  complete  their  training,  trainees  should  be  able  to  find  jobs.  Training \nprograms should be relevant, responding to the needs of the industry and employers. However, ", "  3\nduring project preparation, employers and their associations were dissatisfied with TEVT at \nmost levels. Industry and employers must be closely involved in identifying training program \nofferings, setting program standards, validating curricula, and making other decisions relating to \nTEVT. This would raise their interest in recruiting graduates from government TEVT institutions. \nHeads  of  training  institutions  should  undertake  strategic  planning  and  management  and \ncollaborate more with industry and employers to make programs more responsive to the market. \nGovernment regulations affecting the decision making of upgraded training institutions should \nbe reviewed, to identify responsibilities that can be decentralized.  \n \n12.  Number and Qualifications of Teaching Personnel. Overall, teaching personnel are \nneither  sufficient  in  number  nor  sufficiently  qualified,  particularly  for  technician  programs.  \nIn 2002, only 62% of the allocated posts in the four major TEVT providers were filled, mainly \nbecause of the hiring freeze in the Government. Visiting or part-time staff are hired to augment \nacademic staff. The student\u2013teacher ratio based on enrollment is about 32:1, which needs to \ndecrease to improve quality.2 A recent study conducted by TVEC3 on the training staff in major \npublic providers, including TCs, revealed that about 79% of staff members have a diploma or \nlower and possess mainly a 6-months technical certificate or a 2-year technical diploma. Half \nhad teacher training of less than 3 weeks and about 36% had no pedagogical training. Only \n13% had industrial training after joining the public service. Most teachers lack trade skills and \nindustrial experience, methods and psychology of learning, student assessment and evaluation \nmethodologies, and teaching practicum. The facilities for technical teacher training are limited \nand are only in Colombo. No institution addresses preservice education of TEVT teachers.  \nNo degree programs raise the qualifications of technical teachers to the professional level to \naddress the lack of teaching skills, the need to upgrade technical knowledge, and the need to \nimprove  qualifications  for  higher  pay.  In  mid-2005,  as  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  mass \nrecruitment, MSDVTE recruited degree holders, some of whom will be instructors in training \nprograms, helping fill posts, but many require pedagogical training. Recruitment and retention of \nteachers  and  instructors  is  hampered  by  low  pay,  which  is  aggravated  by  the  lack  of \nopportunities to improve qualifications. \n  \n13.  Financial Sustainability. As the Government provides free training, expanding TEVT \nthrough new technician and technologist programs will require more money. A strategy should \nensure that training programs receive adequate resources, run efficiently, and are conducted in \na sustainable manner. Resources should be linked to outputs to ensure that the quality of \ntraining programs and trainees is not compromised and that TEVT investments in facilities and \nequipment  are  not  wasted.  More  resources  are  needed  to  purchase  consumable  training \nmaterials; run, maintain, and repair training equipment; and procure learning materials.  \n \n14.  No  Alternative  Paths  to  Higher  Education.  The  problem  of  upgrading  teachers\u2019 \nknowledge and qualifications is aggravated by the absence of options for upward mobility within \nthe TEVT system, hampering its potential to create jobs, build skill-based competitiveness and \nhuman capital, and attract and develop students with vocational aptitude and the appropriate \nattitude. The capacities of conventional universities are limited and mostly oriented toward \nacademic pursuits leading to white-collar jobs. In general, there is no systematic link between \nTEVT  and  the  higher  education  system  for  vertical  mobility  toward  life-long  learning  and \n                                                 \n2   ADB. 1999.

The study had 1,774 respondents. \n ", "4   \nalternative career paths. The adoption by the Government of the NVQ framework4 in TEVT \nallows O/L and A/L students to pursue technical-oriented careers and receive higher education \nwhile employed. The NVQ classifies TEVT courses according to skills standards; the NVQ\u2019s \napex is the achievement of a degree by an O/L student. Appendix 2 summarizes the NVQ \nframework.  \n \n15.  Social Image. TEVT has a poor social image. As potential applicants into the current \ntechnician training system have completed GCE A/L, most are qualified for university admission. \nTechnician training in whatever form under the current system does not lead to a degree.  \nThe demand for degrees is high, which is unlikely to be filled by the current university system. \nDuring  project  preparation,  discussions  with  students  focused  on  degrees  and  not  on \ntechnology or work. GCE O/L students, however, are not eligible for diploma studies and are not \ninformed  of  their  alternatives.  Families  need  to  know  the  economic  opportunities  awaiting \ntechnicians. To attract more women to training programs that will allow them to earn higher \nincomes, the attitude toward female participation in the technician profession needs to be \nimproved.  \n \n16.  Government Strategy. The Government recognizes the need to develop skills and \nadopt international best practices to increase Sri Lanka\u2019s competitiveness and improve the \nemployability of its workforce locally and abroad. The Government has planned to strengthen \nthe  intake  and  output  of  education  and  TEVT  institutions.  To  upgrade  TEVT  personnel\u2019s \nknowledge and skills, and to provide alternative higher education, the Government is planning to \n(i) upgrade one TC in each of the nine provinces to a college of technology (CoT), which will \noffer technician diploma programs; and (ii) develop an alternative higher education pathway, \nfocusing on technical education and technology, by establishing the University of Vocational \nTechnology (Univotec), which will be the apex TEVT institution in the country. \n \n17.  ADB Strategy. ADB\u2019s education and training strategy in Sri Lanka5 is consistent with the \nGovernment\u2019s priorities. ADB\u2019s country strategy supports the development of TEVT to reduce \nhigh  youth  unemployment  and  develop  high-level  human  resources  to  achieve  skill-based \ncompetitiveness. ADB supports the improvement of relevance, effectiveness, and efficiency of \nthe technical and skilled workforce. \n \n18.  External Assistance. ADB is one of the largest providers of external assistance to \neducation and training, with investments of about $233 million in eight projects over the past 23 \nyears. Three of the projects were for technical education and skill development (Appendix 3). \nThey  were  designed  to  address  problems  confronting  TEVT  and  have  helped  build  and \nstrengthen TEVT capacity to serve expanding training requirements. Past projects developed \nstandards and training programs, built capacity of training-teaching staff and administrators, \nestablished technical teacher training facilities, and updated training facilities and equipment.  \n \n19.  Development partners have committed to upgrade four CoTs and develop Univotec.  \nTC-Jaffna will be upgraded by the Korean International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), and three \ntechnologies will be upgraded in TC-Maradana by the Japan International Cooperation Agency \n(JICA),  while  one  CoT  each  in  the  Eastern  and  Southern  provinces  will  be  confirmed  for \nassistance by other development partners. Univotec will receive assistance from the German \nTechnical Cooperation (GTZ) in applied advanced technologies. \n                                                 \n4  NVQ framework development was one of the activities of the ongoing Skills Development Project; ADB. 1999. \nReport and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Democratic \nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Skills Development Project.

Lessons Learned. ADB\u2019s assistance to TEVT started in 1982. Two projects6 have been \ncompleted while the Skills Development Project (SDP) is ongoing; the proposed Project is the \nfourth TEVT project. Appendix 4 summarizes lessons learned from TEVT projects in other \ncountries and in Sri Lanka, which have been incorporated in the proposed project design.7 While \nthe SDP supports programs in vocational training, the lower half of the qualifications framework, \nthe Project will assist the upper half. The Project builds on the NVQ framework developed with \nthe SDP\u2019s support. To ensure the relevance of training programs, project preparation included \nconsultations with industries in different regions to identify their current and emerging needs. \nThe Project proposes to develop the technician programs with industry and employer input to \nensure that relevant skills and knowledge are imparted. As the Government provides free \neducation and training until the first degree, and fee-levying is a sensitive issue, charging fees \nfrom students and trainees will not necessarily be the first recourse for financial sustainability. \nThe Project will review the regulations of the Government; of the Ministry of Skills Development, \nVocational and Technical Education (MSDVTE); and of the Department of Technical Education \nand Training (DTET) to identify which responsibilities can be decentralized to help make training \nprograms more efficient and sustainable. The Project will train senior personnel of CoTs in \nstrategic planning, industry partnerships, and training needs assessments, and develop and \nimplement output-based budgeting (OBB) for CoTs.  \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n21.  The Project\u2019s impact will be the development of more mid-level and highly skilled human \nresources who will contribute to economic growth and social development. The Project supports \nthe Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy and economic goals by improving the country\u2019s \nskill-based competitiveness. \n \n22.  The Project\u2019s envisioned outcome is improved access and strengthened capacity of the \nTEVT system in technical and technological education to meet labor market needs. The Project \nwill help the Government close the gap between the supply of and demand for technicians and \ntechnologists by helping (i) upgrade TCs to CoTs to offer new technician diploma programs, and \n(ii) establish Univotec to offer new technical education and technology degree programs.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n23.  The Project will have three outputs: (i) CoTs strengthened to offer technician education, \n(ii) MSDVTE and relevant institutions strengthened to support market-responsive TEVT, and  \n(iii) Univotec established and made operational. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 5.  \n \n24.  The Project complements and builds on the SDP outputs. The Project will develop the \nNVQ  framework  by  adding  the  program  standards  of  NVQ  levels  5\u20137  (technician  to \ntechnologist) to the SDP-initiated skills standards of levels 1\u20134. The Project will involve industry \n                                                 \n6   ADB. 1982.

Component 1: Strengthening Colleges of Technology  \nin Technician Education  \n \n25.  This component will support the Government\u2019s strategy of upgrading one TC in each \nprovince to a CoT, which will offer technician diploma programs and make technical education \nmore geographically accessible. The proposed education and training pathway to technician \ndiplomas is illustrated in Appendix 6. CoTs will have delegated authorities and, as the flagship \nTEVT center in its province, provide technical support to the smaller TCs with less resources. \nTraining programs will primarily meet domestic labor market needs and, secondarily, foreign \ndemand. The Project will help upgrade six CoTs (project CoTs), namely, Anuradhapura CoT, \nBadulla CoT, Kandy CoT, Kurunegala CoT, Maradana CoT, and Rathnapura CoT. Development \npartners will help upgrade three CoTs in the three other provinces. The annual enrollment intake \ncapacity of technician diploma programs is expected to increase from the current 600 students \nto about 1,500 full-time and 1,500 part-time students; the additional students will not be required \nto have GCE A/L qualifications for admission.  \n \na.  Strengthening Administration and Operations Systems \n \n26.  To improve the operational efficiency of CoTs, the Project will help develop and install \nsystems  and  procedures,  including  related  manuals  and  handbooks,  on  governance  and \nadministration, planning, monitoring, and management and information systems according to \nthe institutions\u2019 vision and goals. The systems and procedures will cover budgeting, student \nregistration,  and  alumni  registration.  The  Project  will  train  about  24  nonacademic  and \nadministrative staff in these systems and procedures and in budgeting, planning, and financial \nmanagement.  CoTs  are  expected  to  develop,  among  others,  their  own  annual  budgets, \ncalculate their unit costs, and eventually implement OBB. The Project will provide the project \nCoTs with consultancies; training and workshops; and procurement of equipment, software, and \nmaterials. \n \n    b.  Strengthening Strategic Management  \n \n27.  The objective of this subcomponent is to strengthen the capacity of each CoT to develop \nand implement strategic plans in response to the needs of employers, the manufacturing and \nservices sectors, industry, and the region it is serving. Advisory councils will be established for \neach CoT and will have at least 60% representation from employers, the manufacturing and \nservice sectors, and industry. The Project will orient members of advisory councils in strategic \nplanning  for  TEVT.  The  Project  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  about  18  CoTs  officials  to \nundertake strategic planning, business development, and entrepreneurial management, to serve \neconomic and investment needs and priorities, in close consultation with regional development \nbodies and businesses. The training will include (i) management and planning for a market-\nresponsive institution, (ii) development and promotion of demand-driven part-time education and \ntraining programs, (iii) training needs assessment in industries and communities, (iv) building \npartnerships  with  employers  for  training,  exploring  subcontracted  production  to  enhance \ntraining, and (v) writing project proposals and bidding documents. The Project will provide for \nconsultancy and study tours to model institutions abroad for international benchmarking and \nnetworking. \n \n \n ", "  7\n  c.  Developing Student Selection Procedures and New Curricula \n \n28.  CoTs will be offering new technician diploma programs within the NVQ framework. \nThese programs will not require GCE A/L passes for admission; thus, students may come from \ndiverse academic and training backgrounds. The Project will help develop a student selection \nsystem that will consider the varied backgrounds of applicants. This will include identifying \nknowledge gaps and recommending bridging programs to be offered by CoTs and other training \nproviders. The system will include a technician aptitude test, which the Project will develop and \nvalidate.  The  Project  will  provide  consultancies,  training  and  workshops,  equipment,  and \nmaterials.  \n \n29.  The Project will help develop 12 new technician program curricula according to TVEC-\napproved  standards  and  the  NVQ  framework.  The  indicative  list  of  technologies  in  which \ntechnician programs may be offered includes biomedicine, ceramics and clay, civil technology, \nelectricity and power, electronics and communication, electronic imaging and printing, farm \nmachinery, food technology, information and communication, jewelry design and manufacturing, \nmarine technology, refrigeration and air-conditioning, and welding and fabrication. Appropriate \nbenchmarked curricula from the international technician training market will be identified and \nacquired; where necessary, curricula will be developed according to program standards. Three \nbridging programs will be developed. The Project will establish sectoral councils to validate \ntechnician  curricula.  A  system  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  performance  of  programs  and \nstudents will be developed. The Project will provide for consultancies, the development and \nacquisition of curricula, learning and multimedia materials, software, and office equipment. \n \n30.  Training  partnerships  with  industries  may  involve  the  development  of  part-time  and \nmodular  training  programs  for  employees  and  managers  to  upgrade  their  skills  and \nqualifications.  Part-time  courses  will  be  an  important  source  of  revenue  for  TEVT.  \nIn collaboration with industries, the Project will help develop training modules of varying duration \nto be offered as fee-charging part-time courses.  \n \n  d.  Upgrading Facilities and Equipment \n \n31.  The Project will provide for the procurement and installation of equipment in project \nCoTs  that will  match  the  curricular  requirements  of  technician  programs  and  meet  TVEC-\nendorsed skill and program standards. The programs\u2019 equipment needs will be reviewed vis-\u00e0-\nvis the equipment stock of these institutions, after which a list of necessary curricular training \nequipment will be prepared. Equipment will be of the generic type approved by industry sector \ncouncils (ISCs). A facilities and equipment operation and maintenance (O&M) plan will be \ndeveloped. Teaching and technical staff will be trained in O&M of equipment and facilities in \nproject CoTs.  \n \n32.  The  Project  will  support  the  renovation  of  physical  facilities  of  each  project  CoT.  \nA  physical  facilities  development  plan  will  be  developed.  It  will  identify  minor  facilities \nrenovations,  if  any,  needed  to  provide  technician  training  as  per  the  endorsed  standards, \ncurricula developed to meet those standards, and equipment purchased to support the curricula. \nThe Project will support these renovations, which will be minor and may cover workshops, \nlaboratories, offices, electrical power, water supply, and lighting.  \n \n  e.  Upgrading the Skills of Teaching Personnel  \n \n33.  The qualifications, knowledge, and skills of CoTs teaching personnel will be upgraded to \nteach new curricula in the context of any new equipment acquired or new training program \n ", "8   \nareas offered. The Project will provide consultancies and financial resources to prepare and \nimplement  a  staff  development  plan.  The  Project  will  support  upgrading  of  (i)  educational \nqualifications of teaching and training staff and (ii) technical and industrial skills of technical \nteachers  in  existing  and  new  technologies.  Activity  (i)  will  include  upgrading  educational \nqualifications  to  a  bachelor  of  technical  education  (B.Tech.Ed.)  or  its  equivalent,  including \nthrough in-service training at Univotec. If the establishment of Univotec is delayed, students will \nenroll in flexibly-delivered programs in other institutions.  \n \n2.   Component 2: Strengthening MSDVTE and Relevant Institutions \n \n34.  The Project will strengthen MSDVTE and relevant institutions to facilitate, support, and \nensure  a  relevant,  quality,  and  sustainable  TEVT  system,  with  focus  on  NVQ  levels  5\u20137.  \nThe Project will consolidate the progress made under the SDP and build on its completed \nactivities.  This  component  will  include  (i)  the  development  and  implementation  of  OBB,  \n(ii) a refined education management information system (EMIS), (iii) training standards for \nhigher-level technical skills, an operational NVQ system, (iv) a quality assurance system, and \n(v) a TEVT social marketing strategy. \n \na.  Developing Output-Based Budgeting \n \n35.  OBB will link institutions\u2019 resources and outputs, which will help improve the use of \nfacilities and equipment, and thus increase the cost-effectiveness of programs. The Project will \nhelp develop OBB for MSDVTE training institutions. Training workshops on OBB will be offered \nto MSDVTE planning, budgeting, and accounting personnel, and to related staff of the Ministry \nof  Finance  and  Planning.  The  Project  will  support  consultancies,  training  and  workshops, \nsoftware, materials, and office equipment in relevant offices. \n \nb.  Strengthening TEVT Sector Policy Analysis and Planning  \n \n36.  The Project will refine MSDVTE\u2019s EMIS to include information on the CoTs and Univotec \nand on the OBB requirements. The refined EMIS will be installed at MSDVTE, TVEC, Univotec, \nand  CoTs.  The  Project  will  help  MSDVTE  comprehensively  map  government  and \nnongovernment TEVT institutions using a geographic information system (GIS). The Project will \ntrain about 12 staff members of MSDVTE, TVEC, Univotec, and CoTs in the use of EMIS and \nGIS data for policy analysis, planning, and decision making.  \n \n37.  The Project will help TVEC conduct and disseminate information and studies on TEVT \nissues  and  policies.  The  studies\u2019  topics  include  (i)  mechanisms  to  ensure  the  financial \nsustainability of relevant quality training programs, (ii) the efficiency of the present system of \nGovernment  and  nongovernment  TEVT  provision,  (iii)  the  administrative  and  regulatory \nenvironment of private TEVT provision, (iv) quantification of economic benefits contributed by \nthe  TEVT  sector,  and  (v)  employment  of  trainees  and  tracer  studies.  Under  (i),  specific \nrecommendations will be made, some of which will be piloted in project CoTs. \n \n38.  The Project will provide for consultancies, training, consultation workshops, research \nassistance,  software,  computers,  reproduction  of  study  papers  and  reports,  web  page \ndevelopment and maintenance, and workshops to inform policy makers and the public of TEVT \nissues.  \n \n \n ", "  9\nc.  Developing the NVQ and Program Standards  \nfor Technologists and Technicians  \n \n39.  The Project will support the continued articulation of the NVQ, with focus on the higher-\nlevel  qualifications  for  technicians  and  technologists.  The  related  program  standards  and \nsample curricula for NVQ levels 5\u20137 will be developed. TVEC will be assisted to establish ISCs, \nwhich will adapt and validate international and locally developed training standards in selected \ntechnology and crafts programs. ISCs will provide guidance on the estimated human resource \nrequirements of sectors. The Project will develop at least 12 technician and technology program \nstandards in new and emerging technologies. These standards will provide for horizontal and \nvertical mobility in TEVT. The related skills standards of these technologies at NVQ levels 1\u20134 \nwill be reviewed, and refined as needed, for seamless progression to levels 5\u20137. About 30 skills \nstandards will be developed and validated at levels 1\u20134. The Project will help disseminate these \nstandards  to  stakeholders,  including  Government  and  nongovernment  training  providers.  \nThe Project will support consultancies, workshops, materials, reproduction, and dissemination.  \n \n  d.  Strengthening the TEVT Quality Assurance System \n \n40.  The  Project  will  develop  and  implement  a  TEVT  quality  assurance  mechanism  for \ntechnician  and  technological  education  programs  to  ensure  that  ISC-validated  program \nstandards endorsed by TVEC are achieved and maintained by all training providers. TVEC \nregistration procedures and standards for nongovernment training providers will be reviewed \nand refined as needed by the Project. Accreditation standards and transparent accreditation \nprocedures  will  be  developed  and  implemented.  Database  systems  for  registration  and \naccreditation will be developed and installed. To assist the accreditation process, and also \nfacilitate government\u2013private training provider interactions, TEVT providers will be organized \ninto a national association. About 15 TVEC staff members and 40 prospective accreditation \nauditors,  including  members  of  the  association  of  training  providers  and  professional \norganizations, will be trained in the accreditation process. The Project will help TVEC undertake \nsample compliance audits. The Project will provide for 10 institutional audits in the first year of \nthe  program,  15  in  the  second  year,  and  25  in  the  third  year.  The  Project  will  support \nconsultancies,  workshops,  materials,  software,  office  equipment,  reproduction,  and \ndissemination.  \n \ne.  Enhancing the Social Image of TEVT \n \n41.  Diploma programs will require social marketing to attract workers, students, and school \nleavers, particularly women, with the aptitude and attitude for technical and vocational education \nand a career in technology. The Project will raise the public\u2019s awareness of the NVQ framework \nand  technical  education.  In  collaboration  with  national  industry  sector  associations,  career \nguidance and counseling units, and JobsNet,8 the Project will develop and implement a social \nmarketing strategy. The strategy will include information to be disseminated through mass \nmedia,  in  the  JobsNet  system,  and  in  the  career  centers  established  through  the  SDP.  \nThe Project will support consultancies; material development, procurement, and dissemination; \nand mass media campaigns.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n8  JobsNet is an initiative of the Ministry of Labour Relations and Foreign Employment that is being managed by the \nCeylon Chamber of Commerce. JobsNet does not only provide information on available employment opportunities, \nbut also an interface for employers and job-seekers. \n ", "10   \n3.  Component 3: Establishing the University of Vocational Technology  \n \n42.  Upon  the  passage  of  the  University  of  Vocational  Technology  Act  (Univotec  Act),  \nthe Project will help the Government establish Univotec, which will address the shortage of \ntechnologists and qualified instructors for technical education, and provide an alternative higher \neducation pathway leading to a degree for students and TEVT personnel. By providing access \nto tertiary education, this component will help improve the sector\u2019s social image. Univotec will \noffer new degree programs, starting with a B.Tech.Ed. and a bachelor of technology (B.Tech.). \nIt  will  have  various  campuses  using  the  physical  facilities  of  various  TEVT  institutions.  \nThe premises of the National Institute of Technical Education of Sri Lanka (NITESL) will be \nupgraded to be the main campus, and NITESL will be strengthened to become a faculty of \ntraining  technology.  Other  technical  institutions  of  MSDVTE,  including  TC-Ratmalana,  will \nbecome part of the faculty of vocational technology. Univotec is expected to have an annual \nenrollment intake capacity of about 600 full-time and 600 part-time students in the technologist \nprogram, and about 300 full-time and 300 part-time students in the technical teacher education \nprogram. \n \na.  Developing University Administration and Technical Capacity \n \n43.  The Project will support the development and implementation of university systems and \nprocedures, including manuals and handbooks, on university governance and administration, \nplanning,  monitoring,  and  management  and  information  systems.  The  latter  will  include  \n(i) student administration, (ii) human resource management, (iii) budgeting and finance, and  \n(iv) alumni tracing. This will be achieved by consultancies; procurement of equipment, software, \nand  materials;  and  training  and  workshops.  The  Project  will  train  about  15  Univotec  staff \nmembers to use these systems.  \n \n44.  To develop the capacity of Univotec officials in university leadership and administration, \nthe Project will support up to 22 officials for executive leadership training and regional and \noverseas study tours of similar institutions for international benchmarking and development of \nuniversity linkages. About 60 academic and technical staff members will train in emerging or \nnew technologies to be offered at the diploma and degree levels, teacher education, curriculum \nand multimedia material development, appropriate nontraditional content delivery modes, and \napplied research and extension. The Project will provide consultancies, international and local \ntraining, workshops, and materials.  \n \nb.  Developing Student Selection Procedures and New Curricula  \n \n45.  The Project will help develop curricula in degree programs leading to a B.Tech.Ed. and  \na  B.Tech.,  and  develop  and  acquire  related  curriculum  materials,  including  multimedia.  \nThe Project will help develop and validate student admission and selection standards and \nrequirements, which consider the varied academic and training backgrounds of applicants.  \nThis  will  include  assessment  of  various  diploma  programs,  identification  of  academic  and \ntraining gaps, and recommendations for bridging programs to be offered by diploma institutions \nand Univotec. The Project will help develop bridging programs for Univotec. To achieve all \nthese, the Project will provide consultancies, workshops, and curricular and learning materials. \n \n    c.  Upgrading Facilities and Equipment \n \n46.  With new programs to be conducted and more students and trainees to be served, \nadditional facilities and equipment will be required. The Project will support a consultant who will \ndevelop a rational phased infrastructure development plan for the university, considering the ", "  11\navailable infrastructure and facilities of MSDVTE institutions that could be used as campuses. \nThe plan will identify facility gaps and develop the master plan and architectural drawings of \nessential infrastructure based on approved resources for this purpose. The Project will support \nthe  upgrade  and  construction,  if  necessary,  of  classrooms,  light  and  heavy  laboratories, \nworkshops, and communal and administrative accommodations. New equipment and furniture \nwill be provided based on the set minimum standards of the new curricular programs and \ntechnology  specializations.  Office,  communication,  and  reprographic  equipment  will  be \nprocured. A facilities and equipment O&M manual will be developed. About 24 academic and \ntechnical staff members will be trained in O&M of these equipment and facilities.  \n \nC.  Special Features  \n \n47.  Admission  Eligibility  of  GCE  O/L-Educated  Youth  and  Employed  Workers.  \nThe  Project  provides  an  opportunity  to  GCE  O/L-educated  youth  and  employed  workers,  \nwho have satisfactorily completed and been awarded a national certificate or its equivalent, to \nbe admitted to a diploma program upon meeting some equivalency requirements. \n \n48.  Laddered Training System with an Alternative Pathway to Diploma and Degree \nPrograms.  The  Project  supports  a  laddered  training  system  for  vertical  progression  and \ncontinuing education of technical and technician graduates. This opens options to link and \narticulate the TEVT programs with technology and technical education to the degree level.  \nThis will be made possible by using established standards to develop bridging modules to \ncompensate for content deficiencies. Univotec will provide an alternative pathway to a degree, \nimprove access to tertiary education, and provide vertical mobility within TEVT. \n \nD.   Cost Estimates  \n \n49.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $26.7 million equivalent, including taxes, \nduties, interest charges on the ADB loan, and physical and price contingencies. The foreign \nexchange cost is estimated at $9.9 million (37%), and the local currency cost at $16.8 million \n(63%) equivalent of the total cost. A summary of the cost estimates is in Table 1.

The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The loan will cover 75% of the total project cost. ADB \nwill fund 100% ($9.9 million) of the foreign currency cost and 60% ($10.1 million equivalent) of \nthe local currency cost. Interest during project implementation will be capitalized. The remaining \n$6.7  million  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost  will  be  provided  by  the  Government.  \nThe financing plan is summarized in Table 2.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total Cost  Percent \nSource  Exchange  Currency \nAsian Development Bank  9.9  10.1  20.0  75.0 \nGovernment  0.0   6.7   6.7  25.0 \nTotal  9.9          16.8  26.7       100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n51.  MSDVTE will be the Executing Agency. A project steering committee (PSC) will be \norganized  to  direct  the  Project,  monitor  its  activities  and  outputs,  guide  the  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU),  and  coordinate  and  liaise  with  other  government  agencies  and \ndepartments. The secretary of MSDVTE will chair the PSC, whose members will comprise \nrepresentatives  from  TVEC;  Ceylon-German  Technical  Training  Institute;  DTET;  National \nApprentice and Industrial Training Authority; NITESL; Vocational Training Authority; Univotec; \nMinistry  of  Education  with  responsibility  for  higher  education;  and  External  Resources \nDepartment,  Department  of  National  Planning,  and  Department  of  National  Budget  of  the \nMinistry of Finance and Planning. The PSC will include at least four representatives from \nindustry and employers, as well as two rotating representatives of project CoTs. The PSC will \nmeet as needed but not less than quarterly to review project progress and to make decisions. \nThe MSDVTE policy working group will provide TEVT policy guidance and technical advice to \nthe PIU, and ensure the continuity and consistency of reforms and changes to TEVT policy and \nMSDVTE institutions. The project director will be a member and the PSC secretary. \n \n52.  The SDP PIU will be retained to ensure continuity between the SDP and the Project. \nIt will be responsible to the PSC for day-to-day project implementation and will be headed by a \nproject director. Specialists in administration and finance, procurement, civil works, and project \nperformance monitoring and reporting will assist the project director. Focal persons will be \nappointed in each project CoT and institution receiving project support and implementing project \nactivities. The PIU will coordinate with DTET in implementing component 1, and with TVEC and \nthe MSDVTE planning division for component 2. While the Univotec Act is awaiting passage by \nParliament, the MSDVTE planning division will coordinate component 3; after passage of the \nact, Univotec will take over. To ensure the smooth implementation of project activities in each \nproject CoT, the CoT head will be appointed as the focal person and will be responsible to the \nPSC and PIU for project implementation in that CoT.  ", "  13\n \n2.  Implementation Period  \n \n53.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years, from March 2006 to February 2011.  \nThe indicative implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n3.  Procurement   \n \n54.  All  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. Each contract for goods and services of more than $500,000 will \nbe  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding  procedures,  while  contract \npackages of $500,000 equivalent or less will follow international shopping procedures. All civil \nworks  contracts  will  be  awarded  through  local  competitive  bidding  among  prequalified \ncontractors  in  accordance  with  Government  standard  procedures  and  other  requirements \nsatisfactory to ADB. Minor items valued at less than $50,000 equivalent will be procured directly \nfollowing Government procedures. Appendix 9 includes the indicative procurement packages \nand modes of procurement. \n \n4.  Consulting Services  \n \n55.  The  selection  and  engagement  of  all  consulting  services  to  be  financed  under  the \nProject will be in accordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. A team of consultants to \nprovide services in a range of specializations, with estimated international inputs of 99 person-\nmonths and domestic inputs of 270 person-months, will be engaged through a firm using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method. Appendix 10 summarizes the required consulting \nservices, and Appendix 11 provides the outline terms of reference. \n \n56.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the Government \nand  MSDVTE.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n5.  Staff Development and Training \n \n57.  International fellowships and local training will be provided under the Project to about \n1,022  people,  equivalent  to  4,475  person-months  of  training:  226  person-months  for \ninternational fellowships and 4,249 person-months for local training and industrial attachments. \nSelection of candidates will follow the Government\u2019s policy and implementing guidelines under \nforeign and local training. ADB approval will be required before the award of international \nfellowships.  ADB  will  be  provided  with  a  list  of  (i)  the  nominated  candidates,  (ii)  their \nqualifications, and (iii) detailed cost of proposed courses. For training recipients, a bonding \narrangement, in accordance with Government procedures and requiring recipients to remain in \ntheir institutions for a minimum period, will be required. A summary of indicative areas for \ninternational staff development and local staff training is in Appendix 12. \n \n \n ", "14   \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements  \n \n58.  MSDVTE will be responsible for preparing disbursement projections and for requesting \nbudgetary allocations for counterpart funds. To ensure the timely release of loan funds, an \nimprest account will be established in the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in Colombo. The initial \namount will be no more than a 6-months projected disbursement or 10% of the total loan \namount, whichever is less. The imprest account will be established, managed, and liquidated in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements agreed to by \nthe Government and ADB. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures may be used to \nreimburse eligible expenditures and to liquidate advances made into the imprest account in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s loan disbursement guidelines. Any individual payment to be reimbursed \nor liquidated under the SOE procedure will not exceed the equivalent of $50,000. MSDVTE will \ncoordinate the timely release of funds. Auditors acceptable to ADB will audit the use of the \nimprest account and SOE procedures. A separate audit opinion should be included in the \nannual audit report. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n \n59.  The Government, acting through MSDVTE, will maintain records and accounts adequate \nto identify goods and services financed from the loan proceeds. MSDVTE will maintain separate \nrecords and accounts for the Project, and ensure that accounts and financial statements are \naudited annually by independent external auditors acceptable to ADB. The auditor\u2019s report and \ncopies of the certified accounts and related financial statements, including the auditor\u2019s opinion \non the use of loan proceeds, compliance with loan covenants, and use of the imprest account \nunder ADB\u2019s SOE procedure, will be submitted to ADB in English not later than 6 months after \nthe close of the Government\u2019s fiscal year. The independent external auditing services will be \nfinanced from the loan proceeds.  \n \n60.  The  PIU  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  the  status  and  progress  of  project \nimplementation and submit them to ADB within 30 days after each quarter. The reports will have \na  format  acceptable  to  ADB  and  indicate  (i)  progress  made  against  established  targets,  \n(ii) status of performance indicators, (iii) problems encountered and actions taken to address \nthem,  (iv)  compliance with  loan  covenants,  and  (v)  program  of  activities  proposed  for  the \nfollowing quarter. Within 3 months after project completion, the PIU will prepare and submit to \nADB a project completion report describing project implementation, accomplishments, benefits, \nand impact. \n \n 8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n \n61.  Annual Operational Plans. To ensure efficient project implementation, the Government \nwill prepare and provide ADB with the next fiscal year\u2019s project operational plan at least 30 days \nbefore the start of the next fiscal year. The operational plan will mainly include  (i) project \nactivities with cost estimates proposed for each component/subcomponent with performance \ntargets; (ii) a plan for complying with outstanding loan covenants; (iii) a breakdown of financial \nrequirements, including loan proceeds withdrawal and counterpart funds from the Government; \nand (iv) details of how project activities are to be integrated into other ongoing programs. \n \n62.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  Project  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  will  be  the \nresponsibility of MSDVTE through the PIU and will build on the SDP M&E system. In the first \nyear of implementation, a baseline indicator study will be conducted to refine and expand \nverifiable indicators of project inputs, outputs, and impact, including internal efficiency of project \ninstitutions, external efficiency of technician and technology programs, cost-effectiveness of ", "  15\ntraining programs, and gender disaggregation. MSDVTE, primarily TVEC and the planning \nsection, will be responsible for output and impact M&E. The Project will refine EMIS to regularly \ncollect information and monitor the implementation of project activities in CoTs and Univotec, \nand to provide information for OBB. Project M&E data, including from EMIS, will be regularly \nreported and analyzed in quarterly and annual reports submitted to ADB. The Project will \ninclude strengthening MSDVTE capacity for policy analysis. MSDVTE will conduct studies on \nTEVT issues and policies, including tracing trainee-graduates. \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n63.  Besides regular reviews, the Government and ADB will jointly undertake a midterm \nreview during the Project\u2019s third year. Among other things, they will (i) review the project scope, \ndesign,  implementation  arrangements,  institutional  development,  and  capacity-building \nprocesses;  (ii)  review  changes  in  Government  policies  and  institutional  framework  since \nappraisal and evaluate their impact on the Project; (iii) assess project implementation against \nperformance indicators; (iv) review compliance with loan covenants; (v) identify critical issues \nand constraints; and (vi) recommend changes in project design or implementation as needed. \nSpecific attention will be given to a review of (i) the number of staff members who have received \noverseas training and have been retained, (ii) access of minority groups and women to CoTs \nand Univotec, and (iii) the impact of OBB on the overall efficiency of CoTs. One month at most \nbefore the review, the PIU will submit to ADB a comprehensive report on each of the above-\nmentioned issues. The review will recommend changes in project design and implementation as \nneeded. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.   Project Benefits and Impacts  \n \n64.  Institutional  and  Sectoral  Benefits.  The  Project  will  strengthen  and  expand  the \ncapacity for technician and technological education. The quality, relevance, and sustainability of \nthese education programs will be improved by (i) developing training and program standards for \ntechnicians and technologists; (ii) upgrading selected TCs to CoTs; and (iii) strengthening the \ncapacity of TEVT teachers, trainers, personnel, and administrators. Developing the NVQ for \ntechnicians and technologists will help institutionalize an alternative education and training \npathway, particularly for school leavers, in technical and technology education leading to a \ndegree. The establishment of a voluntary national association of TEVT providers and ISCs will \nincrease the market orientation of training programs.  \n \n65.  Social  Benefits.  The  Project  will  help  the  Government  reduce  the  high  rate  of \nunemployment  and  underemployment  among  the  educated  youth,  and  increase  access  to \npostsecondary education and training. Univotec and the CoTs will provide more education and \ntraining opportunities and options to the youth and unemployed. By upgrading TCs to CoTs \noutside Colombo in all provinces, postsecondary education and training will be made accessible \nto more potential student-trainees, including those who cannot afford to travel to Colombo. With \nthe  medium  of  instruction  proposed  to  be  English,  ethnicity  and  local  language-related \nprejudices  will  be  minimized  and  cross-cultural  communication  strengthened  among  the \nstudents  and  staff.  Bridging  programs  will  help  minimize  knowledge  gaps  arising  from \ndifferences in education quality across schools.  \n \n66.  Social marketing and career guidance services will focus on promoting technology-\nbased employment; increasing public awareness of technological career paths; and promoting \n ", "16   \ntrade,  technician,  and  technology  programs  to  women.  The  introduction  of  new  training \nprograms, including in fields that are not traditionally male-oriented, will help attract women to \ntechnician programs. The degree and diploma programs will not only increase the employability \nof the youth and other groups but will also serve as an alternative education and training \npathway for fulfilling their personal aspirations. The programs will allow youth to develop their \ngeneric and technical skills, which are useful for employment as well as for social participation.  \n \n67.  Economic  Benefits.  Coupled  with  MSDVTE\u2019s  strengthened  capacity  to  ensure \nrelevance, quality, and efficiency of TEVT, the B.Tech., B.Tech.Ed., and technician diploma \nprograms will increase the number of skilled workers who can fill the supply\u2013demand gap in \nvarious domestic industries as well as in the foreign labor market. The direct economic benefits \nof the Project are (i) increased domestic production because of the greater use of human capital \nthat will be reflected in wage increases of the graduates employed in domestic industries, and \n(ii) increased remittances in foreign exchange from graduates employed abroad. See Appendix \n13 for the economic and financial analysis.  \n \n68.  The Project is envisioned to increase annual enrollment intake capacity of technician \ndiploma  programs  by  about  2,400  full-time  and  part-time  students.  Similarly,  Univotec  is \nexpected to have an annual enrollment intake capacity of about 600 full-time and 600 part-time \nstudents in the technologist program, and about 300 full-time and 300 part-time students in the \ntechnical teacher education program. Over the 15-year evaluation, about 15,300 more youths \nare expected to graduate\u20149,900 with a B.Tech. and 5,400 with a B.Tech.Ed from Univotec, and \nabout 22,500 with technician diplomas from CoTs. With higher skill qualifications in the TEVT \nsector, graduates from the project institutions will be rewarded with higher wages and faster \npromotion.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  at  20.4%  in  the  base-case \nscenario. \n \nB.  Project Risks and Assumptions \n \n69.  The  political  conflict  in  Sri  Lanka  presents  a  major  risk  to  achieving  the  Project\u2019s \ndevelopment goal. Without peace and stability, the local economy may not develop and/or \nadvance, and local demand for technicians and technologists may stagnate. However, even if \nlocal demand were stagnant, overseas demand for skilled and highly skilled Sri Lankans would \nremain strong. \n \n70.  Institutional Risk. MSDVTE requires capacity strengthening to build a private\u2013public \npartnership-based TEVT system. The high turnover of personnel has contributed to unstable, \nsometimes  weak,  leadership  and  administration.  The  project  design  includes  capacity \nstrengthening of TVEC, CoTs, and Univotec officials to ensure continuity when the leadership \nchanges. Private sector participation in CoT advisory councils, national association of training \nproviders,  and  ISCs  will  encourage  the  private  sector  to  play  a  key  role  in  promoting, \npatronizing, and sustaining TEVT, while contributing to greater market relevance of training \nprograms.  \n \n71.  Sustainability of Project Investment. Because the Government fully finances the cost \nof  training  programs  and  provides  small  stipends  to  trainees,  the  sustainability  of  project \ninvestment after implementation depends on the Government\u2019s commitment to funding TEVT as \nevidenced by adequate provision of an O&M budget, including updates of curricula, learning \nmaterials, and software. The Project will develop and implement OBB for CoTs and assess the \npowers that may be decentralized to CoTs to encourage them to be more efficient. The capacity \nof heads of CoTs for strategic planning to generate TEVT revenues will be strengthened.  \n ", "  17\n72.  Implementation Risk. The implementation of the first and second loan projects suffered \nfrom, among others, delays and complex problems brought about by the transfer of project \nresponsibility from one ministry to another, lack of counterpart funds, and slow appointment of \nqualified project staff. The Government has reassured ADB that it is committed to the Project \nthat it will allocate the necessary counterpart funds, and that SDP PIU staff will continue under \nthe Project, subject to satisfactory performance. Qualified instructors and trainers are assumed \nto  be  available.  The  Project  includes  upgrading  staff  skills  and  knowledge,  which  will  be \ndelivered flexibly. The Government can hire temporary staff as needed. Parliament could delay \nthe approval of or not approve the Univotec Act. The Government has given its reassurance that \nit is deeply committed to supporting the Univotec charter.  \n \n73.  Safeguard  Measures.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in \nAppendix 14. The Project\u2019s environmental aspects were reviewed; no adverse impacts are \nanticipated.  The  amount  of  waste  generated  under  the  Project  is  expected  to  be  small, \nparticularly hazardous substances, which should be negligible. Nevertheless, environmental \nconsiderations will be incorporated into the project activities to avoid any minor environmental \nimpacts  during  refurbishment  of  training  institutions  and  in  the  disposal  of  training  waste \nmaterials. Where substances designated as hazardous or toxic under national law are to be \nused as part of training activities in laboratories, waste management plans will be formulated to \nprotect  human  health  and  the  environment,  and  to  ensure  the  safe  collection,  transport, \ntreatment, storage, and disposal of such substances. The plans will highlight segregation of \ntoxic substances at source, recovery and use of recovered materials, and safe disposal in \ndesignated hazardous waste landfill sites. The Project will have positive impacts on all ethnic \ngroups without favoring any. However, in the event of any negative project impact on an ethnic \nminority or any positive impact not accruing to an ethnic group, safeguard measures will be \nincluded either in an ethnic minority development plan as per the approved ethnic minority \ndevelopment framework, or as specific action in resettlement plans. With no planned land \nacquisition, the Project is unlikely to trigger ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy. \n \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n74.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \nassurances, which will be incorporated into the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that heads of the CoTs will be selected through a \nprocess of open application and selection will be based on merit.  \n(ii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  advisory  councils  are  established  within  \n3 months of loan effectiveness, are composed of at least 60% representation \nfrom employers, manufacturing and service sectors, and industry, and will have \nheld its first meeting. \n(iii)  Within 2 years of loan effectiveness, MSDVTE will have developed, approved, \nand introduced new technician curricula with various technology specializations, \nincluding  bridging  programs.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  technician \nprograms in the nine CoTs will conform to the same program standards and will \nnot vary in structure.  \n(iv)  Within  1  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  MSDVTE  will  have  developed  and \ninstitutionalized  a  procedure  for  the  selection  of  applicants  to  the  technician \neducation program, including an admissions test. GCE A/L will not be made an \nentry criterion and NVQ will receive equal consideration.  \n ", "18   \n(v)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Ministry  of  Public  Administration  will \nrecognize the diplomas issued by CoTs for entry into the public service within  \n3 years of loan effectiveness.  \n(vi)  MSDVTE will ensure that CoT staff who participate in staff development activities \nwill be replaced on an interim basis.  \n(vii)  If the B.Tech. Ed. program does not start within 2 years of loan effectiveness,  \nthe  Government  will  ensure  that  an  equivalent  program  arrangement  for \nupgrading the qualifications of staff is developed and entered into. The equivalent \nprogram will start within 3 years of loan effectiveness.  \n(viii)  Within 1 year of loan effectiveness, the Management Services Department of the \nMinistry of Finance and Planning and MSDVTE will have approved the cadre of \ntrainers, instructors, as well as technical and administrative staff needed for the \neffective and efficient operation of the nine CoTs and Univotec. Within 2 years of \nloan effectiveness, at least 90% of such cadre will have taken up their position. \nFemales will comprise at least 20% of the academic staff by the end of the third \nyear of implementation.  \n(ix)  Within  2  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  MSDVTE  will  have  approved  and  fully \ninstitutionalized OBB for the CoTs, including its related management information \nsystem. MSDVTE will ensure that all budgetary allocations for the CoTs as of \nyear 3 of project implementation will be in accordance with OBB.  \n(x)  Studies of cost recovery mechanisms in the TEVT sector will be completed by \nthe second year of project implementation and piloting of some will have been \ninitiated by midterm in at least 3 project CoTs.  \n(xi)  By  the  end  of  the  third  year  of  project  implementation,  MSDVTE  will  have \ndeveloped a 5-year budget and sustainability plan for the CoTs and Univotec and \nrelevant  authorities  will  have  approved  such  a  plan.  The  approved  plan  will \ninclude clear budgetary allocations for consumables on an expanding basis, as \nwell as a decision to move the O&M costs for the CoTs and Univotec from the \ndevelopment budget to the recurrent budget by the end of the Project.  \n(xii)  Within  3  months  of  the  passage  of  the  Univotec  Act,  the  members  of  its \ngoverning body will have been notified by MSDVTE and will have held their first \nmeeting. \n(xiii)  Within 1 year of the effectiveness of the Act creating Univotec, a transparent \nprocedure for the selection of applicants to the degree programs will have been \ndeveloped and institutionalized. The requirements will include NVQ levels 5 and \n6 and similar qualifications.  \n(xiv)  Within 2 years of loan effectiveness, MSDVTE will have developed, approved, \nand introduced new curricula leading to B.Tech. and B.Tech.Ed. at Univotec.  \n(xv)  Within 4 months of loan effectiveness, the baseline M&E study will have been \ncompleted.  \n(xvi)  Throughout  project  implementation,  the  Government  will  allocate  sufficient \nbudget in its recurrent budget to maintain the 2005\u20132006 level of operation and \nmaintenance of the technical and vocational schools funded by the ADB under \nthe SDP.  \n(xvii)  Within 1 year of loan effectiveness, MSDVTE will develop and approve a policy \nand action plan to ensure equal access for different population groups to CoTs \nand Univotec. The Government will ensure that the governing bodies of Univotec \nand of each CoT will adopt such policy and implement them by year 2.  \n(xviii)  The Government will ensure that the Project will be implemented in accordance \nwith the ethnic minority development framework, resettlement framework, and \nthe gender action plan.  ", "  19\n(xix)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all \napplicable  labor  laws,  do  not  employ  child  labor  for  construction  and \nmaintenance activities, and do not differentiate wages between men and women \nfor work of equal value.  \n(xx)  The Government will ensure compliance with existing environmental laws and \nregulations of Sri Lanka, the environmental policy of ADB,9 and the actions listed \nin para. 75.  \n(xxi)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness and in accordance with relevant labor \nlegislation, each institution involved in delivering training courses will prepare and \napprove an occupational health and safety plan (OHSP) covering work-related \nsafety and health issues of personnel and public. The OHSP will include an \nemergency plan for accidents and calamities. \n \n \nB.   Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n75.  The  following  conditions  will  be  met  by  the  Government  before  the  loan  becomes \neffective: (i) the PSC shall have been established, its members notified, and shall have met \nonce;  (ii)  the  Government  will  have  approved  the  establishment  of  the  Project  CoTs;  \n(iii) MSDVTE will have confirmed the technical areas for support; and (iv) DTET will have issued \na circular delegating authority to CoTs in the areas of revenue generation, spending, and \nselection of course offerings. \n \nC.   Conditions for Disbursement  \n \n76.  Until the Univotec Act has been passed by Parliament and made effective, no withdrawal \nwill be made from the loan for any project activity under subcomponents 3.A(i), 3.A(ii), 3.A(iii), \nand 3.C.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n77.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  13,605,000  to  the  Democratic  Socialist \nRepublic of Sri Lanka for the Technical Education Development Project from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n26 October 2005 \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2002.

Overview of the Technical Education and Vocational Training System \n \n1.  The postsecondary courses of the technical education and vocational training (TEVT) \nsystem encompass various forms and levels of training, which generally start after completion of \nthe senior secondary level of schooling (grade 11, age 16 years) and go up to the diploma level \n(see Figure A1 below). The first tier of training programs consists of certificate courses, which \nare designed to produce semi-skilled to crafts-level workers, and usually require a pass in the \nGeneral  Certificate  of  Education  (GCE)  ordinary  level  (O/L)  examination  in  the  required \nsubjects. These courses range in duration from 6 months to 4 years. The next tier of courses \nconsists  of  diploma  programs,  which  currently  cater  to  students  who  passed  their  GCE \nadvanced level (A/L) examination with relatively good marks in mathematics, physics, and \nchemistry. The objective of these programs is to prepare the students to become versatile \ntechnicians capable of performing a broad spectrum of work between that of an engineer and a \nskilled worker. These programs vary in duration from 3 to 4 years.  \n \n2.  Certificate programs are offered by major public providers under the purview of the \nMinistry of Skills Development, Vocational and Technical Education (MSDVTE). These major \npublic  providers  are  the  National  Apprentice  and  Industrial  Training  Authority  (NAITA),  \nthe Vocational Training Authority (VTA), the Department of Technical Education and Training \n(DTET), and the Ceylon-German Technical Training Institute. The National Youth Services \nCouncil (NYSC) and other ministries also offer craft-level and certificate courses. DTET is the \nlead agency for technical education programs. About 320 public TEVT institutions throughout \nthe country are operated by these major public TEVT providers. A number of ministries are \ninvolved in TEVT, either as part of their mandated functions or as part of serving their respective \nsectors.  The  distribution  of  other  public  TEVT  providers  and  operators  is  as  follows:  \n379 statutory bodies, 209 government institutions, and 21 special institutions. The National \nCertificate in Engineering (Craft Courses) is the main technical education program. The full-time \nprogram is 2 years long. The curriculum has 60\u201370% practical content and 30\u201340% theoretical \ncontent, with credits given for every subject every semester.  \n \n3.  Diploma programs are offered by at least four recognized institutions in Sri Lanka:  \nthe  Technician  Training  Institute  (TTI)  under  NAITA,  the  Mattakuliya  Advanced  Technical \nInstitute with the Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technical Education (SLIATE), the Institute of \nTechnology-Moratuwa University (ITUM), and the Open University of Sri Lanka (OUSL). Each of \nthese institutions has its own curriculum. Generally, the curriculum is about 60% practical \ncontent and 40% theoretical. After completing the program, students are awarded a diploma \nsuch as a Higher National Diploma in Engineering (HNDE), a National Diploma of Technology \n(NDT), a National Diploma in Engineering Sciences (NDES), or a Diploma of Technology (DT).  \n \n4.  Postsecondary higher technical education is relatively underdeveloped. Only a limited \nnumber of mandated public providers and a few enterprising private technical institutions with \nforeign affiliations are engaged in higher technical skills development. This is one of the major \nreasons for the bottleneck in responding to labor market demands. In addition, there is a need \nto  provide  vertical  mobility  to  the  holders  of  Higher  National  Diplomas  in  Science  and \nTechnology in order for them to aspire to higher education and enhance their productivity, and \nto ensure their life-long employability and self-fulfillment. So far, only one institution of higher \nlearning in the country has addressed this need, the OUSL, which offers distance-learning \nprograms. \n \n5.  The Government is the main financier and provider of TEVT in Sri Lanka. As the TEVT \nsystem has expanded, activities are being duplicated and the system is facing operational and ", "    Appendix 1          21\nfinancial constraints. These affect the efficiency, relevance, and quality of TEVT. There is a \nshortage of qualified teachers and conditions of facilities are poor. Most of the TEVT institutions \nare not motivated to improve or to broaden their financial base because of the lack of a \nfacilitating policy environment. Public\u2013private partnership in TEVT is yet to be fully realized and \nthe private sector could play a greater role.  \n \n6.  There are a growing number of private providers of TEVT courses, but these mostly \nfocus on information technology. They award an assortment of certificates and diplomas with no \nassurance  of  quality  or  national  recognition.  From  consultations,  there  appears  to  be \ntremendous variation in their training quality, from outstanding to very poor. This may compound \nthe unemployment situation and discourage youth from pursuing TEVT programs. By law, the \nprovision  of  TEVT  by  the  private  sector  and  by  nongovernment  organizations  requires \nregistration, accreditation and approval by the government through the Tertiary and Vocational \nEducation Commission (TVEC). About 350 private TEVT institutions are registered with the \nTVEC. There are wide gaps in the enforcement of the present system, which need to be filled \nbefore consistent training quality becomes a reality. There are no professional associations \nsuch as private accrediting bodies and no peer or professional evaluation of institutions and \nprograms. It is very difficult to determine the supply capacity of the private sector.  \n \n7.  In  addition,  there  are  a  considerable  number  of  international  nongovernment \norganizations (INGOs) and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) operating in the country, only \n128 of which are registered with TVEC. Training by these organizations is undertaken mainly to \nsupport  farming,  micro-enterprise  development,  or  basic  craft  skills.  On  occasion,  these \norganizations ask public providers to recognize their training programs.  \n \nB.  Planning and Development of Technical Education and Vocational Training \n \n1.  Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission  \n \n8.  TVEC serves as the main arm of MSDVTE in planning, coordinating, and monitoring \ntertiary education and training. TVEC was established as a statutory body with the following \ngeneral objectives: (i) the planning, coordination and development of tertiary education and \nvocational education at all levels in keeping with the human resource needs of the economy; \n(ii) the development of  nationally recognized systems for the granting of tertiary education \nawards, including certificates and other academic distinctions; and (iii) the maintenance of \nacademic and training standards in institutes, agencies and all other establishments that provide \ntertiary  education  and  vocational  education.  However,  the  TVEC  is  failing  to  carry  out  its \nfunctions because of lack of resources and consequent weak capacity. The ongoing Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Skills Development Project (SDP)1 provides support to TVEC in skills \nstandards  development,  establishment  of  the  National  Vocational  Qualification  (NVQ) \nFramework,  and  the  development  accreditation  system,  which  will  partly  address  these \nconstraints. The NVQ Framework has been finalized. It has seven levels, of which only levels  \n1 to 4 have been developed. About 45 skills standards for selected trades have been developed \nand are now being implemented in a number of TEVT institutions. The full operation of an \naccreditation system, however, may not be realized within the implementation period of SDP.  \n \n2.  National Institute of Technical Education Sri Lanka  \n \n9.  The National Institute of Technical Education Sri Lanka (NITESL) is another important \narm of the MSDVTE, particularly for technical teacher education and staff development. It was \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1999. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \n  Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Skills Development Project. Manila. ", "22   Appendix 1     \nestablished in 1998 as a statutory body to assist the ministry and TVEC to formulate TEVT \npolicy and to promote teacher education, research and development. Among its mandated  \nfunctions are to (i) provide training programs and services in technical and vocational education; \n(ii) implement and maintain a system for examination and accreditation; (iii) initiate and promote \npractices connected with training teachers in technical and vocational education, including the \nadaptation of appropriate technology for training purposes; (iv) provide professional services in \nthe various functional areas of technical and vocational education and training, human resource \ndevelopment,  curriculum  development,  teaching  methodology,  educational  technology, \nvocational guidance and counseling; (v) provide and promote graduate and postgraduate level \ntechnical and vocational education and training; (vi) undertake and promote research and other \nstudies on all aspects of technical and vocational education and training; and (vii) sponsor and \nhold conferences, seminars and workshops, and publish books, journals and magazines in \nconnection with all aspects of TEVT. NITESL needs to do much more to address the acute \nshortage of TEVT teachers, including updating their knowledge, improving their teaching skills, \nand raising their qualifications. There is a need to update its resources and strengthen its \ncapacity for technical teacher training, curriculum development, flexible training delivery, and \nmultimedia learning. \n \nC.  Operation and Constraints of Major Technical Education Providers \n \n10.  DTET and NAITA are under MSDVTE. SLIATE was formerly with MSDVTE but is now \nunder the Ministry of Education; ITUM and OUSL are autonomous bodies that offer technical \neducation.  Most  of  these  are  corporate  bodies  with  specific  mandates,  separate  and \nindependent governing bodies, and diverse organizational structures. Close scrutiny of public \nTEVT organizations reveals functional and resource duplication. The organizations are supply-\noriented and their programs overlap. Moreover, major TEVT providers under MSDVTE need to \nbe  reoriented  toward  a  unified,  sustainable,  and  market-driven  TEVT  system.  All  of  the \ninstitutions offering technician-level and diploma programs require GCE A/L qualifications for \nadmission, which hampers their response to the demand for technicians and technologists. \nTechnician programs in the current system have diverse admission requirements, duration, \ncurriculum design and content mix, training arrangements and delivery, and award and program \naccreditation.   \n \n11.  Department of Technical Education and Training. DTET has the mandate to develop \nskilled workers and craftsmen. Under its direct supervision and control are 37 technical colleges \nthroughout the country that offer courses up to the certificate level. The total enrollment in 2003 \nwas 18,265 and the dropout rate averaged about 25% over the last 5 years. More than any of \nthe other line agencies, DTET has, over time, gone through various institutional arrangements. \nIn 2004, it came under the authority of MSDVTE. As a government agency, DTET faces the \nmajor constraint of lacking autonomy or corporate powers that are vested in statutory bodies \nsuch as NITESL, TVEC, SLIATE, and VTA. Students with GCE O/L qualifications are eligible for \nadmission into its certificate programs. Currently, the DTET capacity to fulfill its mandate is \nconstrained by a lack of funds for operation and maintenance, lack of qualified teaching staff, \nand outdated programs and equipment. \n \n12.  Sri Lanka Institute for Advanced Technical Education. SLIATE is mandated to offer \ndiploma  programs  in  technical  education.  It  has  18  advanced  technical  institutes  (ATIs), \n11 independent and 7 attached, located throughout the country. Of these, only the Mattakuliya \nATI is engaged in technical/technician training. It offers the HNDE and has an annual intake of \nabout 150 students. The administration, management, and control of the affairs of the SLIATE \nare vested in its governing council, which is composed of 15 members representing mostly \ngovernment line agencies, professional bodies, the federation of chambers of commerce and \nindustry, and persons of recognized competence and eminence in the relevant areas of studies. ", "    Appendix 1          23\nThe Director-General serves as the principal executive and academic officer, under the general \ndirection of its Governing Council, and is appointed by the minister with 5-years tenure of office. \nThe institute is poorly equipped, lacks sufficient qualified full-time and motivated teaching staff, \nand lacks resources for operation and maintenance.   \n \n13.  National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority. NAITA conducts training in \napprenticeable trades and operates highly specialized institutes such as the Technician Training \nInstitute and the Automotive Training Institute. NAITA places its trainees in industry. It operates \n49 training centers (4 national and 45 small centers), with a total enrollment of 16,448 and a \ndropout  rate  of  about  29%  in  2003.  NAITA  is  a  corporate  body  established  under  TVEC \nprovisions (Part II, Act No. 20 of 1990, as amended by Act No. 50 of 1999) and is the successor \nto  the  National  Apprenticeship  Board,  which  was  incorporated  under  the  National \nApprenticeship Act No. 49 of 1971. The Authority has the following objectives: (i) planning, \norganizing and providing training; (ii) specifying standards in relation to vocational training; \n(iii) conducting national trade tests; (iv) conducting research and development in vocational \ntraining; (v) holding competitions to promote the development of various skills; (vi) developing \nthe training capacities of establishments and other institutions providing vocational training; \n(vii) advising the TVEC on vocational training; and (viii) linking up with institutions in Sri Lanka \nand abroad that have similar objectives and equating and/or validating certificates, diplomas \nand degrees in allied subjects and courses. NAITA is governed by a board of management, \nwhich  consists  of  not  more  than  15  members  representing  government  institutions,  trade \nunions, commerce, and industry. NAITA has established strong links with industry through its \nenterprise-based  apprenticeship  programs,  despite  shortages  of  funding  and  staffing,  and \noutdated facilities. \n \n14.  Institute of Technology\u2013University of Moratuwa. ITUM offers technician education \nprograms leading to an NDT. The program consists of 2 years of full-time studies and 1 year of \nindustrial training under the supervision of NAITA. The program operates on an annual system. \nThe  available  fields  of  NDT  specialization  are  civil,  chemical,  electrical,  electronics  and \ntelecommunications, marine, mechanical, nautical, polymer, and textile and clothing. The entry \nqualification for these courses is a GCE A/L pass in mathematics and age between 18-24 years. \nIn addition, an aptitude test is given. A special feature of the curriculum is that all students are \nrequired to pass basic courses held 4 hours a week for 1 year. Currently, the facilities and \nequipment used for instruction and laboratory work of students are shared with the Faculty of \nEngineering. Only a few courses have separate buildings for workshops and laboratories. \n \n15.  Open University of Sri Lanka. OUSL is the only institution in Sri Lanka which offers \ntechnician  and  technological  education  programs  leading  to  a  diploma  and  a  degree  in \nengineering technology. The Faculty of Engineering Technology is responsible for carrying out \nthese programs. OUSL differs from conventional universities, technical colleges, and institutes \nin that it makes use of flexible delivery and distance learning modes. This provides greater \nopportunities for employed persons without age or educational restrictions. The OUSL has a \nstudent population of about 20,000, spread across 21 regional and study centers throughout the \ncountry. The OUSL, unlike most government universities and technical colleges, charges fees, \nincluding a registration fee, a facilities fee, an exemption fee, and a tuition fee.  \n \n16.  The  areas  of  specialization  are  agriculture,  automobile,  civil,  computers,  electrical, \nelectronics  and  communications,  manufacturing,  and  textile  engineering.  Each  course  is \nassessed  through  continuous  assessment  and  final  examinations.  Continuous  assessment \nincludes laboratory work, field classes, assignments, presentations, and tests. The DT of OUSL \nis comparable to the NDT, NDES and HNDE programs of the other institutions above. It is one \nof  the  avenues  for  entry  to  mid-level  technical  grades  within  the  engineering  profession.  \nThe minimum program duration is 4 years. The minimum completion time for the Bachelor of ", "24   Appendix 1     \nTechnology (B.Tech.) degree is 7 years, although in practice it takes longer. Holders of the \nB.Tech.  degree  are  expected  to  develop  their  creative,  analytical  and  innovative  thinking \ncapabilities and to increase their ability to access knowledge. Normally, entry into this program \nis through the DT, although other paths are also possible. \n \n \nFigure A1: Education and Training Systems in Sri Lanka \nProfe-\nYear of  Level of \nVocational Certificate Craft-level / Higher Certificate Technician Diploma ssional  Age\nSchooling Education\nDegree\n20 25\n19 24\n18 23\n111111765432 Etc.   1\u20132 yrs.

", "26  Appendix 3 \nSUMMARY OF ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK AND DONOR ASSISTANCE TO THE  \nTECHNICAL EDUCATION AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING SECTOR OF SRI LANKA  \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has extended loan assistance to three projects in \nthe technical education and vocational training (TEVT) sector.1  \n \n2.  First  Technical  Education  Project.  The  First  Technical  Education  Project  (FTEP) \naimed to improve the quality and efficiency of craft and technician education and training \nprovided  at  the  technical  colleges  (TCs)  under  the  Ministry  of  Higher  Education  (MOHE).  \nThe FTEP assisted in (i) establishing the National Technical Teacher Training College (now the \nNational Institute of Technical Education Sri Lanka [NITESL]); (ii) updating equipment and \nfacilities of 20 selected TCs; and (iii) upgrading management of the technical education system \nthrough the establishment of the Technical Education Division, which was upgraded into the \nDepartment of Technical Education and Training (DTET) and later transferred to the Ministry of \nLabor and Vocational Training in 1994. The Project closed in 1988. \n \n3.  Second  Technical  Education  Project.  The  Second  Technical  Education  Project \n(STEP)  was  intended  to  enhance  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  technical  education  by \ncomplementing  the  achievements  and  addressing  the  shortcomings  of  the  FTEP.  STEP \nconsisted  of  two  main  components,  (i)  an  educational  development  program,  and  (ii)  the \nrehabilitation and augmentation of facilities in institutions under the former Technical Education \nDivision  of  MOHE.  The  educational  development  program  component  was  focused  on \nimproving the administration of the Technical Education Division and TCs, the functions of the \nNational Technical Teachers\u2019 Training College, the further development and implementation of \nTC courses, and staff training and career development. The other component dealt mainly with \nupgrading facilities in 12 TCs that were not included under the FTEP; the provision of new \nequipment;  and  the  provision  of  limited  staff  accommodation  and  a  hostel  for  women.  \nThe project was executed initially by MOHE and was later transferred to the Ministry of Labor \nand Vocational Training (MOLVT) in 1994. STEP was completed in 1995. \n \n4.  Skills  Development  Project.  The  ongoing  Skills  Development  Project  (SDP)  was \ndesigned to improve the quality and relevance of skills training by reorienting the vocational \ntraining  system  through  the  introduction  of  competency-based  training  to  ensure  a  closer \npartnership between vocational institutions and the private sector. SDP is increasing both the \nefficiency  and  the  competence  of Government  in  the  provision  of  skills training programs. \nAlthough it specifically addresses the operations of DTET technical colleges and the vocational \ntraining centers (VTCs) of the Vocational Training Authority (VTA), it addresses all of TEVT by \ninitiating a national vocational qualification (NVQ) system. \n \n5.  SDP has: (i) developed a policy framework for the institutionalization of competency-\nbased training (CBT); (ii) established a national CBT learning resources development centre at \nthe Ministry of Skills Development, Vocational and Technical Education (MSDVTE), learning \nsource  utilization  centers  and  career  guidance  and  counselling  centers  at  TCs  and  other \ncentres;  (iii)  upgraded  VTC  facilities;  (iv)  developed  20  new  courses  and  converted  \n25 existing courses into CBT format; (v) introduced entrepreneurship and basic management \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1982.

SDP has provided support for the upgrade of facilities and capacity building of \nselected vocational training institutions, including six national vocational training institutions,  \n37  TCs,  239  selected  vocational  training  centers  and  private  sector  and  nongovernment \norganization (NGO)-managed vocational training in eight provinces and 25 districts. \n \n6.  SDP has finalized basic policy documents for the unified TEVT system. These include \noperations manuals for the National Vocational Qualifications Framework of Sri Lanka, national \nskills standards, assessment and certification, and a guide for CBT in Sri Lanka. The NVQ \nframework is now established and the relevant policy documents and operation manuals on \nCBT, course accreditation procedures, quality management checklist for the training providers, \nand policy guidelines for institutionalization of career guidance and counseling services have \nbeen provided to, and are being used at, all project institutions. MSDVTE has endorsed the \npolicy  establishing  the  NVQ  Framework.  TVEC  has  prepared  an  action  plan  for  effective \nimplementation of the NVQ, quality management system (QMS), and accreditation procedures, \nand a national committee has been established to review the progress of the NVQ system. \n \n7.  Through  SDP,  45  skills  standards  have  been  developed  and  recommended  by  the \nNational  Industrial  Training  Advisory  Committee  (NITAC).  Forty-five  curricula  are  ready  for \nimplementation,  and  assessment  materials  and  other  supporting  documents  have  been \nprepared. However, skills standards have to be reviewed; 45 have already been reviewed.  \nSDP is supporting the implementation of 21 CBT courses in 75 centers and will implement more \nduring the implementation period.  \n \n8.  SDP  has  developed  a  quality  management  system  consisting  of  a  framework, \nhandbooks, formats, and procedures. The quality management self-assessment system has \nbeen  pilot-tested  and  quality  audits  have  been  initiated  in  several  vocational  training  (VT) \ncenters. SDP has established career guidance and counseling centers and trained staff to \nprovide support services. Learning resource utilization centers have been established in 50 \ntraining centers. A training management information system has been developed and installed \nin 91 centers.   \n  \n9.  Building on Past Assistance. The proposed Project will build on the work of the \nongoing SDP. The Project will build on the National Vocational Qualifications framework by  \nadding NVQ levels 5, 6 and 7 (technician to technologist) to the SDP-initiated NVQ 1 to 4 \nprogram standards. The proposed Project will further involve industry and employers in the \ninstitutional transformation for identified growth areas and global competition through advisory \ncouncils and industry sector councils, among others. \n \n10.  World Bank-Financed TEVT Projects. The World Bank supported two TEVT projects \nin the 1980s: (i) the Vocational Training Project, which was aimed at increasing the supply of \ntrained  manpower  and  improving  management  expertise;  and  (ii) the  Second  Vocational \nTraining Project, which established the Institute for Construction Training and Development and \nsupported an intensive management training program. \n \n11.  Sri  Lanka-Germany  Development  Cooperation.  Sri  Lanka  and  Germany  have \ncooperated with each other for 40 years. At present, there are 44 Sri Lanka\u2013Germany projects, \nin implementation or planning stages. Two prominent projects relate to vocational training: \n(i) Strengthening of Vocational Training Project (SVTP); and (ii) Vocational Training for Rural \nWomen and Youth Project (VTW). The SVTP was started in early 1997 with the National \nApprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) and VTA, in support of technical training,  \nat the Ceylon-German Technical Training Institute (CGTTI), the Apprenticeship Training Institute ", "28  Appendix 3 \n(ATI)  and  the  Sri  Lanka  German  Railway  Technical  Training  Centre  (SLGRTTC).  \nThe VTW  Project was started in 1998 in collaboration with NAITA and VTA.  It sought to \nenhance the capacities of local training providers by helping them to identify their training \nneeds;  develop  curricula;  implement  training  programs;  impart  entrepreneurship,  gender \nsensitivity, and environmental awareness; provide on-the-job training; and monitor employment \nafter  training.  The  project  focused  on  upgrading  the  skills  of  women  and  men  for  self-\nemployment ,while encouraging women to take on nontraditional vocations. \n \n12.  Donor  Assistance  Complementing  Technical  Education  Development  Project \n(TEDP). The Government will be helped to develop TCs into Colleges of Technology (CoTs) by \nthe Korean International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), which will support the strengthening of \nthe Jaffna Technical College; and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which will \nhelp  Maradana  Technical  College.  Negotiations  are  underway  to  provide  assistance  for  a \nproposed CoT in the Eastern province and in the Southern province.  \n \n \nTable A3.1: External Assistance to the Education Sector and the \nTechnical Education and Vocational Training Subsector \n \n   Amount           Loan/        Year of \nSource  ($ millon)          Grant       Approval   \n \nA.

One-shot projects do not work  \u2022 The Project is the fourth ADB TEVT project assistance in Sri \nLanka in 25 years. The Project builds on the ongoing SDP. SDP \nfocused mainly on setting up the NVQ framework and supporting \nVT. The Project continues the development of the NVQ at the \ntechnician and technologist levels and the capacity-building \nneeded to deliver these programs. \n2. Need industry linkage  \u2022 Industrial sector councils will be established and will validate \nstandards and equipment. CoTs will have advisory councils that \nwill be mostly from industry. A sectoral council will be established \nin CoTs to validate technician curricula. Heads of CoTs will be \nstrengthened in strategic planning and partnerships. \n3. Leadership spells difference in  \u2022 The Project provides for strengthening of heads and senior \nperformance  officials of CoTs.

Economic Analysis \n \n1.  Economic  Rationale.  To  keep  up  with  rapid  technological  changes  and  to  stay \ncompetitive in increasingly globalized markets, Sri Lankan industries are demanding workers \nwith greater skills and upgrading the skills of their workers. However, the technical education \nand vocational training (TEVT) sector in Sri Lanka currently does not have enough capacity to \nmeet  the  demand  for  technicians  and  technologists.  Technological  education  is  still \nunderdeveloped, and programs for higher-level technical training are limited: At the technologist \nlevel, only the Open University of Sri Lanka (OUSL) offers a Bachelor in Technology. There \nwere  only  17  graduates  from  this  course  in  2003.  At  the  technician  level,  four  public \npostsecondary  institutions  offer  diploma  level  technician  programs  with  total  output  of  612 \ngraduates in 12 technological subjects in 2003. The output from these institutions is extremely \nlow when compared with industries\u2019 needs. The ratio of technicians to craftsmen or skilled \nworkers is low: the normal ratio for a developing economy is about 1:5, while in Sri Lanka the \ncurrent ratio is 1:50. In order to address the shortage of technologists and technicians, the \nProject will assist the proposed University of Vocational Technology (Univotec) and six Colleges \nof Technology (CoTs) to develop the capacity to train technologists in Bachelor of Technology \n(B.Tech.) programs and technicians in Department of Technical Education and Training (DTET) \nprograms. The Project will also strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Skills Development, \nVocational and Technical Education (MSDVTE) in supporting and facilitating these programs. \n \n2.  Number of Qualified TEVT Instructors. Only 62% of teaching positions at the four \nmajor TEVT institutions were filled in 2002. The majority of the instructors at technical colleges \n(TCs) are diploma and/or certificate holders, lack adequate industrial experience, and teaching \nskills. There are no degree programs leading to a Bachelor in Technical Education in Sri Lanka. \nThe National Institute of Technical Education Sri Lanka (NITESL) currently offers in-service staff \ndevelopment  programs  for  trainers/teachers  and  conducts  diploma  level  programs  for \ninstructors.1 Under the Project, the NITESL will be upgraded to a faculty of training technology \nwithin Univotec and will offer a degree program leading to a Bachelor of Technical Education \n(B.Tech.Ed.) in order to raise the qualifications of instructors at CoTs.    \n \n3.  Despite  the  supply\u2013demand  gap  for  technicians  and  technologists,  the  number  of \neducated  young  people  without  jobs  is  growing  and  is  a  cause  of  serious  concern.  \nThe  unemployment  rate  for  people  with  at  least  General  Certificate  of  Education  (GCE) \nadvanced level (A/L) qualifications is 17.3%, which is above the average unemployment rate of \n8.5% in 2004.2 This implies a significant waste of human resources. This mismatch between \nlabor demand and supply can be mainly attributed to three factors: (i) the limited capacity of the \nTEVT  sector,  (ii) the  unwillingness  of  eligible  youth  to  pursue  careers  as  technicians  or \ntechnologists because of TEVT\u2019s poor image, and (iii) the fact that TEVT courses tend to be \nsupply-driven and unresponsive to industries\u2019 needs. \n \n 4.  Alternatives Considered. Private sector provision of TEVT services was considered as \nan  alternative  to  the  Project.  Private  sector  participation  in  the  TEVT  sector  is  currently \nconcentrated in information technology (IT). The private sector is not expected to participate in \n                                                 \n1 The National Diploma in Vocational Training is offered at National Institute of Technical Education Sri Lanka \n    (NITESL). \n2  Department of Census and Statistics. Quarterly Report of the Sri Lanka Labour Force Survey, Third Quarter 2004. \n    Colombo. \n ", "50  Appendix 13 \nother fields supported by the Project because of the considerable infrastructure and capital \nrequirements  and  the  prevailing  uncertainty.  At  present,  the  cost  of  private  sector  TEVT \nprograms is relatively high and beyond the reach of the poor. The public sector has provided \nmost TEVT services and has a wide provider network. It was therefore decided to support \nexisting public sector providers and promote private\u2013public partnerships. To create an attractive \ncareer path in the TEVT sector as a serious alternative to conventional university education, \nstate intervention will be needed. By establishing Univotec as an apex body and positioning \nCoTs as provincial resource centers, the Project will help the Government to move towards \nestablishing a coherent TEVT system with vertical mobility. As part of the registration and \naccreditation processes, the Project will also examine the framework within which private TEVT \nprovision is takes place with a view to providing a more facilitating environment.  \n \n5.  There  are  several  public  TEVT  providers  which  already  offer  technological  and \ntechnician courses at postsecondary levels. Instead of supporting them, six TCs under DTET \nwere selected to be upgraded to CoTs under the Project. This approach was chosen because: \n(i) existing courses at postsecondary levels accept only GCE A/L qualified students, and are not \nopen to GCE ordinary level (O/L) qualified students who are more likely to consider a technician \ncareer. Programs at TCs have GCE O/L requirements or less, and hence are better positioned \nto offer technician programs for students with the aptitude for training; and (ii) TCs have a \ncountrywide network with 37 colleges distributed across provinces, while other public TEVT \nproviders, in addition to admitting only GCE A/L qualified students, conduct technological and \ntechnician courses mainly in the Colombo region and two other large urban areas. \n \n6.  Labor Demand Analysis. Currently, the supply of TEVT services is very low in relation \nto demand. In 2003, only 15.5% of the total labor force of 7.6 million had some form of \nvocational training.3 According to a labor market survey in 2004,4 TEVT graduates constitute \nonly  around  7.1%  of  skilled  and  technical  labor  force  employed  in  the  204  surveyed \nestablishments. Faced with a limited supply of graduates from the TEVT sector, private sector \nindustries train employees in-house to upgrade their skills. Many have said that they would \nprefer to hire technically qualified persons with a recognized diploma in technical education.  \n \n7.  Based  on  industry  growth  projections,  labor  demand  for  different  occupations  and \nindustry categories was estimated for 2004\u20132007. Only 15% of the estimated demand for \ntechnicians and 24% for skilled workers would be filled during 2004-2007, assuming that the \nsupply levels remain constant.5 Hence, there is an immense need to expand and diversify the \ncurrent TEVT system in order to fill the huge supply\u2013demand gap for technicians and skilled \nworkers.  \n \n8.  The Project will support CoTs and Univotec to produce more skilled technologists and \ntechnicians  in  selected  technologies.  Sufficient  industry  demand  for  these  graduates  is  a \nprerequisite for the economic viability of the Project. Technology fields to be offered at Univotec \nand the CoTs will primarily address domestic labor market needs. Addressing foreign demand \nwill be a secondary consideration. Up to four technology fields to be offered by each CoT were \nproposed during consultation workshops involving the public and private sectors.6 According to \nworkshop participants, the greatest demand is for skilled workers in (1) information technology, \n(2) civil engineering, and (3) construction. Thus, information and communication technology is \n                                                 \n3 Table 6.1 in p.33, TVEC. 2004. Labor Market Information Bulletin, June 2004. \n4  The Survey was conducted in five districts and 11 industries under PPTA 4090-SRI: Human Resource Investment  \n    Project in 2004. \n5  The supply\u2013demand gaps are 71,000 for technicians and other associates; and 346,000 for skilled workers. \n6  Workshops were conducted on 25 February, 11, 18\u201320, and 31 March 2005. \n ", "                                                                                                                                           Appendix 13  51\nproposed  to  be  offered  in  seven  out  of  the  nine  CoTs,  and  civil  technology,  including \nconstruction, in four. \n \n9.  There is also foreign demand for graduates of the project institutions. There are about \n1 million Sri Lankan workers in foreign countries, who remitted $1.6 billion in foreign currency in \n2004.7 Foreign labor demand has continuously exceeded supply, especially for skilled workers \nand  technicians.  In  2004,  there  were  366,226  job  orders  from  foreign  countries,  of  which \n156,013 (42.6%) were filled. For technicians and associated professional categories in 2004, \nout of 11,180 job orders, only 2,273 (20%) were filled, implying a large number of missed \nearning opportunities during the period. Since the foreign jobs for technician and associated \nprofessionals offer much higher salaries than those for similar domestic jobs,8 if these positions \nare filled by graduates from the project institutions this would increase Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign \nexchange earnings.   \n \n10.  Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR). To quantify the economic viability of the \nProject, the EIRR over 15 years was estimated. The Project will start three streams of new \nprograms at technician and technologist levels: (i) B.Tech.Ed., (ii) B.Tech. and (iii) Diploma in \nTechnician Education. The first two will be offered by Univotec, and the diploma program by \nnine CoTs, six of which will be assisted by the Project.  \n \n11.  The  B.Tech.Ed.  program  will  train  instructors  and  lecturers,  who  will  in  turn  teach \ndiploma courses as well as some of the existing certificate level courses at CoTs. The benefits \nfrom the B.Tech.Ed. program will be reflected in: (i) increased labor productivity (and thus higher \nwages) of CoT graduates who are taught by better qualified instructors and lecturers; (ii) shorter \njob  search  times  as  a  result  of  better  learning  outcomes;  and  (iii) an  increase  in  internal \nefficiency  of  the  existing  certificate  level  courses  taught  by  instructors  and  lecturers  with \nB.Tech.Ed qualifications.  \n \n12.  The B.Tech. program will train students as technologists in various technologies, starting \nfrom the third year of project implementation, when there will be 200 full-time and 200 part-time \nstudents. By the fifth year of implementation, the program intake will increase to 600 full-time \nand  600  part-time  students.  Based  on  the  projected  number  and  the  employment  rate  of \ngraduates, the program will lead to better labor productivity and higher wages. Representative \nwage structures for technologists and unskilled workers  were developed from  the industry \nsurvey and used as the bases for the benefits computation.9  \n \n13.  The Diploma in Technician Education programs will begin in the second year of project \nimplementation  with  an  intake  of  375  full-time  and  375  part-time  students  in  various \ntechnologies. By the fifth year of implementation, the intake will expand to a maximum of 1,500 \nfull-time and 1,500 part time students. The benefit from the DTET programs is calculated as \nincremental wage income for those diploma holders employed in their respective technology \nfields.  \n \n14.  The economic cost of the Project includes: (i) the capital investment incurred during the \nproject  implementation  period,  (ii)  incremental  recurrent  costs  beyond  the  project \n                                                 \n7 Central Bank of Sri Lanka. 2004.

The Project is estimated to yield a net present value of $14.7 million and an EIRR of \n20.4%, assuming the discount rate of 12% in the base case scenario.  \n \n16.  An analysis was undertaken to determine the extent to which the EIRR computation is \nsensitive  to  the  assumed  parameter  values,  namely  (i)  the  employment  rate  of  graduates \n(external efficiency of the programs), (ii) the promotion and completion rate of students (internal \nefficiency of the programs), (iii) the number of students enrolled, and (iv) a 1-year delay in \nstarting diploma programs at CoTs. In the low scenario, the employment rate, the promotion and \ncompletion rates, and the intake rate are all assumed to be lower than the base scenario by \n20%. In the high scenario, the employment rate is assumed to be higher than the base by 5%,11 \nthe promotion and completion rates higher by 5%, and the intake higher by 20% (Table A13.1). \nThe internal efficiency of the programs is the most sensitive parameter for the EIRR.

Poverty Impact Analysis \n \n17.  Poverty in Sri Lanka is a rural phenomenon. In 2002, 21% of the rural population was \nclassified as poor, compared with 6% of urban population. The Project will ensure equity in \naccess  to  TEVT  by  upgrading  one  TC  each  in  six  of  the  nine  provinces.12  Table  A13.2 \nsummarizes  income,  education,  and  employment  indicators  in  seven  provinces.  Across \nprovinces, there is a positive correlation between the average income and tertiary education \nenrollment rate and a negative correlation between the average income and the unemployment \nrate  for  the  population  with  A/L  qualifications.  Since  many  of  the  nonpoor  can  obtain \npostsecondary  education  at  fee-paying  private  institutions13  and  secure  white-collar  jobs \nafterwards, a large percentage of the unemployed population with A/L qualifications and those \nwho cannot pursue further education at the postsecondary level are likely to belong to poorer \nhouseholds. The project programs are expected to enroll students from the poorer households, \nwho would not otherwise be able to pursue postsecondary level education, and to equip them \nwith  income-earning  skills  upon  program  completion.  By  offering  programs  in  technologies \n                                                 \n10 SLRs12,000  per  annum  for  a  full-time  student  and  SLRs7,500  for  a  part-time  student  were  assumed  for  \n    out-of-pocket expenses. \n11 The employment rate cannot exceed 100%. \n12 Up to six colleges of technology (CoTs) will be supported by ADB and the rest will be supported by other donors, \n    including Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit [German Agency for  Technical  Cooperation]  \n    (GTZ), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and Korean   International Cooperation Agency (KOICA).  \n13 Approximately 70% of tertiary education enrollment is in the private sector. Since these private tertiary are \n    expensive, there is a sharp disparity in tertiary education enrollment between the poor and non-poor. \n ", "                                                                                                                                           Appendix 13  53\nneeded locally, the Project will encourage regional growth and contribute to regional poverty \nreduction.  \n \nTable A13.2: Income, Education, and Employment by Province \n \nWestern\u2013 Southern\u2013  Sabaragamuwa\u2013  Central\u2013  Uva\u2013 North Western\u2013  North Central\u2013 \nItem Maradana Galle Rathnapura Kandy Badulla Kurunegala Anarudhapura Total\nPercentage below poverty linea 9.2% 23.6% 28.9% 20.8% 31.8% 22.3% 18.1% 19.2%\nAverage income per personb 4,187 2,598 2,036 2,623 2,528 2,717 2,437 3,056\nUnemployment for GCE AL qualifiedc 11.3% 19.7% 21.0% 19.2% 20.7% 17.0% 24.0% 16.5%\nTertiary education enrollment rated 16.0% 10.0% 9.0% 8.0% 7.0% 7.0% 6.0% 11.0%\n \n \nA/L = advanced level, GCE = general certificate of education. \na The official poverty line is SLRs1,423 per month in 2002. \nb Monthly income in SLRs. \nSources: (a and b)\u2013Department of Census and Statistics. 2004.

Public expenditure on education is low in Sri Lanka\u2014about 2.1% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) in 2004.14 This is lower than the 4% rate recommended by the United Nations \nEducational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the average rate of 3.5% in \nAsian  countries.  Educational  institutions  find  it  difficult  to  expand  high-quality  programs, \nparticularly at the postsecondary level and in the TEVT sector, where the unit cost of training \none technician or technologist is significantly higher than in the general education sector.  \n \n19.  The Government\u2019s share in the project costs is estimated at $6.7 million during the \nimplementation period. Public TEVT provision is the responsibility of the MSDVTE, which was \nformed in 2003. In Table A13.3, the annual shares of the Government in the Project costs are \ncompared with the projected MSDVTE budgetary allocations for the years 2006\u20132011. The \nGovernment\u2019s annual shares in the total MSDVTE budget will range from 1% to 7.5%; and the \nGovernment\u2019s shares against the MSDVTE recurrent budget will be 3.4\u201322.1% over the 5 years \nof Project implementation. From the end of the project implementation period, the Government \nwill have to assume $1.4 million annually as an incremental recurrent cost to continue new \nprograms at Univotec and CoTs.

Even though the budgetary allocation to the MSDVTE is expected to increase from 0.3% \nof the total budget in 2003 to 0.4% in 2007, the costs of the Project are substantial, considering \nthe fiscal constraints on the Government. To ensure the financial sustainability of the Project \nbeyond the implementation period, several options are being considered. These may include \n(i) offering fee-levying short or part-time courses for employees in industries and (ii) expanding \nfee-levying weekend courses. In addition, the Project will review the rules and regulations of the \nGovernment and MSDVTE to identify responsibilities that could be decentralized to facilitate the \nefficiency and sustainability of training programs; train senior personnel of CoTs in strategic \nplanning, industry partnerships, and training needs assessments; and develop and implement a \nperformance-based budgeting system for the CoTs. \n \n ", "                                                                                                                                           Appendix 14  55\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka: \n \nThe technical education and vocational training (TEVT) sector in Sri Lanka comprises a diverse mix of study programs \noffered by the Government, private sector, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) catering to a variety of target \ngroups, including the poor. There are about 1,421 TEVT institutions, with a total enrollment of about 64,000 trainees in \n2003. Of this number, a significant percentage of the unemployed urban and rural poor (60%) had acquired skills and \nfound employment opportunities in the country and abroad. The rural and urban poor are a large and important \nsegment  of  the  population,  with  great  potential  to  contribute  to  the  future  economic  growth  of  the  country. \nThe TEVT sector has helped to reduce poverty in several ways. It provides free education to the poor in technical \ncolleges (TCs). In some vocational training institutions, such as the National Apprentice and Industrial Training \nAuthority, monthly allowances are given to trainees undergoing practical training in industry. It is estimated that the \nhigh proportion of students who failed the General Certificate of Education (GCE) ordinary level (O/L) examination and \nare school dropouts are from poor households. Since they have a limited opportunity to continue their higher \neducation in private secondary education institutions, they tend to obtain alternate qualifications in the TEVT sector. \nSome recent studies show that 60% of the households of students in the TEVT sector received less than SLRs 6,000 \nper month. Students coming from poor households are mostly enrolled in basic skills development courses. The TEVT \nsector also helps to improve the skills of the poor, make them more competitive, and enable them to earn a \nreasonable salary or wage. For example, semi-skilled and skilled workers, who also belong to poor households, have \nthe opportunity to continue to develop their skills and to earn higher salaries. The TEVT sector is expected to continue \nto train about 25,000 rural and urban youths from low-income families each year. This will sustain the positive impacts \nof the TEVT sector on the economy and on the lives of poor youths and their families by providing skills training and \nincreased access to job opportunities. \n \nThe Government of Sri Lanka has given high priority to human development through TEVT in order to produce a \ncompetent and flexible workforce that will promote social and economic development and encourage the youth to \ndevelop the best of their potential for economic and social development of the country. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) document, Poverty Reduction in Sri Lanka (2001), noted the lack of access to high-quality education among the \npoor. The Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement between ADB and the Government of Sri Lanka, signed in March \n2002,  defines  the  nature  of  ADB\u2019s  support  to  the  Government  for  economic  growth  and  human  resources \ndevelopment. The education system, including TEVT, must play a vital role in ensuring that the nation has a \nproductive workforce, with the knowledge and the skills needed by the economy. ADB\u2019s education and training \nstrategy in Sri Lanka is part of its overall strategy of poverty reduction, human development, and economic growth. \nADB has provided support to the TEVT sector in Sri Lanka through three projects.   \n \nTEVT in Sri Lanka is relatively new and underdeveloped. There are about 379 statutory bodies, 209 government \ninstitutions, 350 private institutions and 128 NGO institutions. In 2003, 63,454 students were enrolled in vocational \ncourses at certificate and diploma levels. Although annual admissions show a gradual increase in the student \npopulation, the dropout rate has increased from 21% to 26% over the last 6 years. This can be attributed to the low \nsocial image of technical education, lack of proper career guidance in the choice of courses, the poor quality of \ninstruction and of the training environment, and domestic instability. Despite the expansion of TEVT facilities in both \npublic and private sectors, the intervention of the government is required to promote TEVT as an alternative career \npath toward more rational human resource development. Each year, 140,000 people enter the job market, 70% of \nwhom  remain  unemployed.  Youth  unemployment  has  increased  because  of  a  lack  of  appropriate  skills  and \ncompetencies. The conventional secondary education system, with its traditional courses, does not cater to the \nemerging needs of the labor markets, especially in new technological areas. \nTEVT in Sri Lanka does not receive high recognition among students and, as a result, enrollment of trainees in VT \ninstitutes is comparatively low. The development of technical education at diploma and degree levels creates an \nopportunity  for  students  enrolled  in  basic  skills  development  courses  and  the  unemployed  to  obtain  TEVT \nqualifications.  Vocational students have a higher tendency to get into higher earning jobs in industry. The social \nprofile of such students  indicates  that most prefer to continue their education and training while they are employed as \nthey have to  continue supporting themselves and their families. New forms of tertiary education would enable more \npoor students to become qualified, including higher diplomas and degrees. \n ", "56        Appendix 14 \nFor the last two decades there has been high international demand for Sri Lankan labor, but the country has not been \nable to cater to some labor market requirements. Hence, the Project will focus on strengthening the Ministry of Skills \nDevelopment, Vocational and Technical Education (MSDVTE) and the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission \n(TVEC) as the sector\u2019s apex bodies, and establish provincial colleges of technology (CoTs) and the University of \nVocational Technology (Univotec) to reduce the skills mismatch. Alternative forms of tertiary education and vertical \nmobility  will  offer  better  education  and  training  opportunities  to  students  from  economically  disadvantaged \ncommunities. \n  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nUsing the 2003 human development index, Sri Lanka was ranked 93rd of 175 countries. Sri Lanka has had a history of \nwelfare interventions, which have contributed much to social development. According to the 2003 household income \nand expenditure survey, 24.7% in the rural sector, 7.9% in the urban sector, and 22.1% in the estate sector live below \nthe poverty line. The regions with high levels of poverty are those with low access to public services and low \nachievements as measured by human development indicators. Of the nine provinces where the proposed CoTs are to \nbe established, poverty is high in Uva, Sabaragamuwa, North Central, North and Eastern Provinces. In these \nprovinces most people live in rural areas. Sabaragamuwa has the highest level of poverty (28.9%) and Western \nprovince  the  lowest  (9.2%).  In  the  other  districts  where  the  proposed  CoTs  will  be  established,  Badulla  and \nRathnapura have most poor households. The proportion of persons engaged in small industries is lower in Badulla \nthan in Rathnapura. Consumption poverty is lower in urban areas than in rural areas. Urban residents tend to receive \nregular incomes from several household members and to have access to welfare services. In rural areas, many \npeople live on estates (mostly tea estates), which are isolated and have poor housing and education facilities.  \n \nAn inverse relationship exists between the poverty level and the extent of urbanization--the more urbanized the \nprovince is, the lower is its poverty level. For example, the most urbanized Western and Southern Provinces have the \nlowest poverty levels, and the least urbanized Uva and North-Western Provinces have the highest. This points to a \npositive relationship between sources of income and the level of poverty. People who earn a higher proportion of their \nincome from nonfarm employment are wealthier than people who earn most of their income from agriculture. This also \nimplies more urbanized and industrialized areas are more affluent than those that have remained predominantly \nagricultural. An inverse a relationship exists between the level of poverty and the level of education. The incidence of \npoverty is highest among individuals in households where the principal income earner has no schooling (58%) and \nlowest  among  households  where  the  principal  income-earner  is  a  graduate  (5%).  Substantial  variations  in \nconsumption poverty can be seen across districts, with the same relationships between the extent of poverty and the \ndegree of urbanization and the level of education of household members. Overall, poverty is high in districts where \nagricultural development has been low and the expansion of industrial and commercial activities has been sluggish.      \n \nIn most rural areas, access to vocational training is limited. Most of the vocational training centers conduct traditional \ncourses despite the ADB Skill Development Project (Loan 1707-SRI) having initiated the introduction of competency-\nbased training (CBT) system. The shortage of trained instructors and lecturers is a major problem at the local level. \nCraft level students do not have much scope to upgrade their knowledge and competencies through higher TEVT to \naccess technical and managerial level jobs within the country or abroad.  Trainees in the TEVT sector tend to have \nlow salaries as a result they do not pursue higher education in the vocational training sector. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nDuring the project preparation phase, participatory consultations were held with different stakeholders at the policy-\nmaking level, representatives of organizations providing vocational training, local communities, private sector, staff of \nthe ongoing Skills development Project, MSDVTE officials, and students. Discussions were held with stakeholders at \nthe regional level to identify courses that take into consideration labor market demands. Industrial specialists were \nconsulted for information on training needs and employment opportunities. At a national workshop the draft project \nfeasibility study was presented to key stakeholders and their comments and concerns were addressed. In addition, the \nsteering committee, chaired by the Secretary of MSDVTE, met at least three times to discuss the design of the project \nin the context of the current government\u2019s national policies.  \n ", "                                                                                                                                           Appendix 14  57\n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nThe Project includes the participation of industry and employers, key stakeholders of the TEVT sector, to ensure the \nquality and relevance of training programs. TVEC will be strengthened to work with industry and employers. Industry \nsector  councils  will  be  established  to  help  develop  and  validate  program  and  training  standards  in  selected \ntechnologies and craft-level programs. Advisory councils in CoTs will assist senior CoT administrators to determine \nthe direction of its training programs. In CoTs, sectoral councils will validate curricula. Senior CoT personnel will \nengage stakeholders in the planning, administration, and implementation of training programs that are responsive to \nindustry\u2019s needs.  \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nSri Lanka provides free primary, secondary, and tertiary education in an extensive public school system and a network \nof vocational and technical education institutions throughout the country. Incentives, such as scholarships, are also \nprovided. Women have a high educational attainment and there is gender equality in access to general education. \nTheir high educational attainment has partly contributed to the increase in women\u2019s participation in the labor force. \nBetween 1981 and 2001, the share of women in the labor force increased from 18% to 34%.  \n \nHowever, despite these achievements, social biases in career choices are still apparent and are reflected in \nenrollments in TEVT programs. Although women comprised 37% of the total enrollment in TCs in 2003, they were \nmainly enrolled on commerce and secretarial courses. The number of female students in trades courses, such as \nelectronics, automobile repairs, carpentry, masonry, welding and motor mechanics, is low. Women comprise less than \n25% of the enrollment in technical courses.  \n \nThere is a need to encourage more women into technical education. A social marketing program would be useful and \nnew technology courses may also present new opportunities. Attracting more women to less \u201cfeminine\u201d courses would \nalso improve their access to higher paying jobs locally and abroad. Although women comprised 72% of people who \nmigrated for foreign employment in 2002, most were employed as housemaids, where they received low incomes, \nexperienced job insecurity, and worked in poor conditions.  \n \nThe Project includes the following strategies to address gender issues: \n \n(i)  In the overall social marketing strategy, the gender dimensions of TEVT will be emphasized. Career \nguidance components will raise awareness of a technical and technological career path, with a \nspecial focus in promoting female enrollment in the TEVT sector.  \n(ii)  Within the first year of project implementation, MSDVTE will develop and approve a policy and an \naction  plan  emphasizing  the  need  for  a  gender-sensitive  environment  and  for  women  to  be \nencouraged to enroll in trades, technician, and technologist programs. The policy and action plan \nwill address issues such as student selection and allocation criteria, subsidy, and scholarship \nprograms, and awareness-raising activities within the first year of project implementation.  \n(iii)  Each  CoT  and  the  university  will  appoint  a  gender  coordinator  to  oversee  and  monitor  the \nimplementation of the gender policy. \n(iv)  The project implementation unit (PIU), MSDVTE, TVEC, each CoT, and Univotec will collect project \nbaseline  gender-disaggregated  data,  and,  thereafter,  regularly  collect  and  maintain  gender-\ndisaggregated data in its database.  \n(v)  The PIU, in cooperation with TVEC, the CoTs and Univotec will regularly analyze project output and \nimpact indicators, including by gender.  \n(vi)  As new technician programs are introduced, the CoTs will, at minimum, maintain the gender ratio of \nits 2004 enrollment as a TC (about 37%). \n(vii)  Each  CoT  and  the  university  will  maintain  gender-sensitive  infrastructure  facilities,  which  will \nenhance the learning environment of female students.   \n(viii)  Instructors and lecturers will undertake gender-sensitization training.  \n.  \nHas an output been prepared?
