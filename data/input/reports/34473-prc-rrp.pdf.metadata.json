An environmental impact assessment was undertaken \nand the summary was circulated to the Board on 29 March 2005. \n \nThe  development  objective  of  the  Henan  provincial  government \n(HPG)  for  the  sector  is  to  enhance  (i)  quality  of  life  of  the  rapidly \nincreasing urban population in the Hai River Basin (HRB), and (ii) \neconomic  competitiveness  to  sustain  economic  growth  in  key \nmunicipalities,  by  alleviating  degradation  of  water  resources  and \nimproving the quality of the urban environment.  \n \nTo  meet  this  objective,  the  Project  is  designed  to  increase  the \ncollection and treatment of wastewater, and to reduce reliance on \nabstraction  of  groundwater  from  shallow  wells  (most  of  which  are \npolluted  by  wastewater)  in  the  project  cities  through  physical \ninvestment, and institutional and financial reforms. The Project will \nsupport  water  quality  improvement  in  several  canal  and  river \nsystems  in  the  project  cities  through  physical  investment  and \nimproved  water  management.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  help \nstrengthen water resource protection in the HRB through improved \nand \nintegrated  planning,  water  quality  monitoring,  and \nenvironmental management.  \n \nThe  Project  has  identified  19  physical  investment  subprojects  (8 \nrepresentative and 11 candidate subprojects) to provide improved \nwastewater collection and treatment, and water supplies in the 15 \nproject  cities.  The  Project  also  identified  the  need  for  capacity \nbuilding  and  training  for  the  project  institutions,  including  county \nwater utility companies. The Project adopts a sector loan approach \nand will support an area and time slice of the Government\u2019s Henan \nHai River Basin Plan, which serves as a sector development plan \nfor the HRB.  \n \nRapid  economic  growth  and  continuing  urbanization  over  the  last \n25 years in the PRC has resulted in increasingly severe problems \nrelated  to  water  shortage  and  pollution,  especially  in  the  north. \nWater  shortages  for  domestic  consumption  and  urban  industry \nhave  increased  in  magnitude  and  frequency,  resulting  in  severe \neconomic   losses.    Surface   and   groundwater   pollution    now  \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n(i) \n\nincluding \n\nimpacts  public  health,  and  contributes \n\nrepresent a major problem not only for the environment but also for \npublic  health.  Given  the  degree  of  water  scarcity,  pollution  also \ndiminishes  the  resources  available  for  essential  beneficial  uses. \nPollution  represents  a  growing  constraint  on  national  and  local \ndevelopment objectives.  \n \nThe  northern  part  of  Henan  province,  which  is  within  the  HRB, \ncomprises  five  municipalities  and  17  counties.  The  main  rivers  in \nthis  part  of  the  basin  are  heavily  polluted  by  domestic  and \nindustrial  wastewater.  This  pollution  adversely  affects  the  local \nenvironment, \nto \ntransboundary pollution disputes with the downstream provinces of \nHebei and Shandong. \n \nThe  Project  will  address  the  major  issues  involved  in  the  rapid \ndeterioration  of  surface  and  groundwater  quality  and  urban \nlack  of  environmental \nenvironmental  quality, \ninfrastructure, (ii) inadequate water resource management, and (iii) \nfinancial and institutional weakness of municipal service providers.  \n \nThe  Project  will  assist  the  participating  cities  in  formulating  a \npractical  approach  to  provide  urban  environmental  infrastructure \nand  to  introduce  the  principles  of  integrated  water  resource \nmanagement  and  pollution  control.  The  Project  will  help  improve \nthe  urban  environment  and  public  health  through  improved \nwastewater  management  and  more  secure  water  supply,  and \nimprove the quality of surface and groundwater in and downstream \nof  the  project  cities.  It  will  also  help  water  and  wastewater  utility \ncompanies  provide  financially  and  operationally  sustainable  water \nsupply and wastewater services. \n \nThe  overall  impact  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  urban \nenvironment  and  public  health  through  improved  wastewater \nmanagement  and  water  supply.  The  outcome  will  be  that  water \nand  wastewater  utility  companies  in  the  project  cities  will  provide \nsustainable  water  supply  and  wastewater  services  managed  on \ncommercial  principles  and  environmentally  sound  practices  by  (i) \nincreasing  collection  and  treatment  of  domestic  and  industrial \nwastewater, (ii) providing adequate public water supplies, and (iii) \nimproving \nin  and \nthe  quality  of  surface  and  groundwater \ndownstream of the project cities.  \n \nThe Project comprises physical components covering construction \nof  wastewater  management  and  water  supply  facilities,  and  an \nto  support  project \nassociated  capacity-building  component \nmanagement and implementation through capacity building for the \nproject  management  offices  (PMOs)  and \nimplementing \nagencies.  Policy  dialogue  under  the  Project  supports  these \ncomponents  and  contributes  to  ongoing  dialogue  with  the  central \nand local governments.  \n \n\nthe \n\n\fCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nThe  total  project  cost  is  $200.0  million  equivalent,  including  a \nforeign exchange cost of $100.0 million (50%) and a local currency \ncost of $100.0 million equivalent (50%). \n \n\n($ million equivalent) \n\n \nSource \nA.

The \nloan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, \nan  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum,  \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements. \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  relent  by  the  central  Government  to \nHPG.  HPG  will  onlend  the  loan  proceeds  to  the  municipal \ngovernments.  The  municipal  governments  will  onlend  the  loan \nproceeds  to  the  county  and  city  governments.  These  local \ngovernments  will  onlend  the  loan  proceeds  to  the  wastewater  or \nwater utility companies serving the project cities. All onlending will \nbe on the same terms and conditions as the ADB loan. The utility \ncompanies  will  assume  the  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate \nvariation risks for the ADB loan.  \n \nUntil 30 June 2011 \n \n31 December 2010 \n\n \nThe  Henan  PMO  (HPMO),  under  the  overall  direction  and \nguidance  of  the  HPG  leading  group  headed  by  the  deputy \ngovernor of Henan province, will coordinate project implementation \nwork  through  the  various  design  institutes,  and  implementing \nagencies  responsible  for  day-to-day  project  management.

Civil  works \ncontracts  will  be  procured  through  local  competitive  bidding.  In \naccordance  with  ADB  guidelines, \nforeign  contractors  may \nparticipate in the bidding for local competitive bidding contracts. \n \nTwenty-eight  person-months  of  international  and  300  person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  will  be  required,  with  expertise  in \ninternational  competitive  bidding  and \ninternational  shopping \nprocedures,  including  international  specifications,  bid  evaluation, \ncontracts,  quality  control,  and  project  performance  management \nsystems.  The  consultants  will  provide  guidance  and  training  for \ncapacity  building  to  ensure  that  (i)  the  implementing  agencies  in \nfunction  as  effective  project \nto \nthe  project  cities  are  able \nmanagement  units; \ninstitutional,  managerial, \nfinancial,  and  operational  arrangements  are  in  place  to  enhance \noperational  effectiveness,  management  efficiency,  and  financial \nsustainability;  (iii)  the  water  supply  and  wastewater  companies \nbecome  effective  operating  companies  upon  completion  of \nimplementation;  and  (iv)  social,  resettlement,  and  environmental \nimpacts are monitored and mitigated. Consultants will be recruited \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of \ndomestic \nconsultants.  Detailed  design  engineering  and \nconstruction supervision will be carried out by qualified local design \ninstitutes  recruited  by  the  project  cities;  these  services  will  not  be \nfinanced by ADB. \n \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  1.5  million  urban  residents  in  the \nproject  cities  whose  living  conditions  and  public  health  standards \nwill  be  improved  through  (i)  the  collection  and  treatment  of  about \n590,000  cubic  meters  per  day  of  untreated  sewage,  of  which  half \nwill  be  heavily  polluting  industrial  wastewater,  and  (ii)  improved \nwater  supply  of  150,000  cubic  meters  per  day.  The  savings  to \nindustry,  through  avoidance  of  advanced  wastewater  treatment \nrequired  for  discharge  to  surface  waters,  will  support  sustainable \neconomic  growth,  promote  clean \ntechnologies  and  water \nconservation,  and  ameliorate  the  poverty  impacts  of  enterprise \nclosures imposed on environmental grounds.  \n \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  downstream \nbenefits  of  improved  water  quality  through  the  collection  and \nin  each  project  city. \ntreatment  of  wastewater  generated \nDownstream  beneficiaries \nresidents  of  Hebei  and \ninclude \nShandong provinces and coastal areas of Bohai Bay. These water \nquality  improvements  will  contribute  to  integrated  water  resource \nmanagement    and   pollution   control;    the   basin   management \nprogram; and transboundary pollution prevention and control.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nvii\n\nto \n\nloss  of \n\ntemporary  and  permanent \n\nThe  Project  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  environment;  the \nbenefits  greatly  outweigh  the  negative  impacts.  The  Project  is \ndesigned \nto  mitigate  all  construction-related  environmental \nimpacts.  Adequate  provision  is  made  to  fully  compensate  the \nestimated 7,500 people adversely affected by the Project, primarily \ndue \nland.  Extensive \nconsultation with those affected was undertaken as outlined in the \nresettlement  plans  for  the  representative  subprojects,  which  were \nmade public after approval of domestic feasibility studies.  \n \nThe  Project  will  support  poverty  reduction  by  (i)  reducing  the \nincidence  of  waterborne  disease,  cost  of  medical  care,  and  sick \ndays  taken,  thus  reducing  household  health  expenditures;  (ii) \nproviding  safer  and  more  reliable  urban  water  supplies;  (iii) \nimproving  the  quality  of  life  of  the  urban  poor  by  eliminating \nuncollected  sewage  in  poor  neighborhoods  and  improving  water \nquality in urban drainage channels; and (iv) providing employment \nopportunities to the poor. \n \nThe  Project  has  potential  institutional,  financial,  and  policy  risks \nrelated to (i) implementation of institutional reforms in project cities; \n(ii) generation of public support for higher water tariffs to meet cost \nrecovery  targets;  (iii)  project  cities\u2019  ability  to  meet  the  cash/equity \ntransfer required to construct the Project; (iv) weak operational and \nmanagerial capacity of water utility companies; and (v) capacity of \nmunicipal  environmental  protection  bureaus \nto  prepare  and \nenforce  industrial  pollution  control  plans,  affecting  the  ability  of \nwastewater companies to meet treatment standards.  \n \nThe  Project  includes  the  following  measures  to  mitigate  these \nrisks:  (i)  project  cities\u2019  assurances  on  water  utility  companies\u2019 \nfinancial and managerial autonomy and institutional strengthening; \n(ii)  regular  tariff  reviews  and  adjustments  by  the  Government \nfollowing  national  guidelines  as  well  as  public  awareness \nprograms;  (iii)  provision  of  counterpart  funding;  and  (iv)  various \ntraining,  staff  exchanges,  and  secondment  programs.  Moreover, \nHPG  has  extensive  experience  in  preparing  citywide  pollution \ncontrol  plans  with  other  cities.  ADB  review  missions  will  monitor \ncompliance with the financial and operational covenants to ensure \nthe \nthe  water  utility  companies. \nExperienced  domestic  and  international  consultants  will  give \nimplementation advice and support to mitigate specific construction \nand  other  implementation  risks.  HPG\u2019s  project  leading  group, \nheaded  by  a  provincial  vice  governor,  and  HPMO,  which  has \nexperience in oversight of large internationally funded projects, will \nmitigate project

\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Henan Wastewater Management and Water Supply \nSector Project. \n \n2. \nIn  December  2003,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  technical  assistance \n(TA)  to  help  the  Henan  provincial  government  (HPG)  formulate  the  Project.1  The  Fact-Finding \nMission  visited  the  PRC  in  January\u2013February  2005  to  discuss  the  Project  with  the  central, \nprovincial,  municipal,  and  county  governments.  The  Appraisal  Mission  fielded  from  21\u201330  April \n2005  finalized  various  aspects  of  the  project  design.  A  summary  environmental  impact \nassessment (SEIA) was circulated to the Board on 29 March 2005. This report is based on the \ndraft  final  report  of  the  TA;  government  feasibility  studies;  findings  of  ADB  missions;  the \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (EIA);  and  discussions  with  government  officials,  other  aid \nagencies, and stakeholders. Appendix 1 gives the design and monitoring framework.   \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nHenan province includes 18 municipalities and 117 counties and county-level cities with a \ntotal population of 96.7 million in 2003, growing at around 0.7% annually. The current proportion \nof urban dwellers is 27%, but the urban population has been growing at over 6% annually over \nthe past decade. This urban growth results from a steady rural\u2013urban migration; more than half \nthe population will live in cities by 2030. Provincial gross domestic product (GDP) has increased \nby  over  10%  per  year  on  average,  and  presently  stands  at  CNY700  billion\u25006%  of  the  national \nGDP. Industry and the service sectors have been the main engines of growth.  \n \nHenan covers the upper part of the Hai River Basin (HRB), one of the three most polluted \n4. \nriver  systems2  in  the  PRC.  The  northern  part  of  Henan  within  the  HRB  includes  five \nmunicipalities: Anyang, Hebi, Jiazhou, Puyang, and Xingxiang. The main rivers in this part of the \nbasin flow into Wei River and Zhangweinan Canal, and then eventually into Bohai Bay. Like other \nparts  of  the  HRB,  this  subbasin  is  heavily  polluted  by  domestic  and  industrial  wastewater.  The \npolluted  surface  water  contaminates  shallow  groundwater  sources,  on  which  a  significant \nproportion of urban and rural residents depend for drinking water. \n \nDespite  the  region\u2019s  dependence  on  the  basin\u2019s  water  resources  for  water  supply,  the \n5. \nprovision  of  environmental  infrastructure  and  services,  including  the  collection  and  treatment  of \nwastewater, has failed to keep up with the region\u2019s rapidly growing economy. Increasing flows of \nuntreated domestic and industrial wastewater into the basin have put the basin\u2019s water resources \nunder severe pressure. Despite water shortages, the rate of wastewater treatment and reuse is \nvery  low  and  only  34%  of  urban  wastewater  is  being  treated.  More  investment  is  needed  to \nsupply clean drinking water and treat wastewater.  \n \n(water  supply,  water \n6. \nconservancy  management,  environmental  management,  and  sanitation)  in  Henan  province \nfluctuated  from  $540  million  to  $780  million  per  year  over  the  last  4  years.  This  accounts  for \napproximately  1%  of  provincial  GDP  or  $6\u2013$8.5  per  capita.  Wastewater  charges  are  below  the \ncost of treatment, providing little commercial incentive to invest in wastewater treatment facilities. \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2003.

Manila. The title of the Project was adjusted to reflect project content. \n\n2   The others are the Huai and Liao river systems. \n\n \n\n\f 2 \n\nIncreasing water tariffs would encourage water conservation and help finance the construction of \nnew water supply projects. \n \n7. \nPollution control for the upper HRB is of particular importance due to the relevance of the \nZhangweinan  Canal  watercourse  to  boundary  disputes  between  Henan,  Hebei,  and  Shandong \nprovinces, mainly caused by upstream pollution and the planned use of the watercourse as part \nof the South-North Water Transfer Project (SNWTP).3 Approximately 225 kilometers (18%) of the \ncanals under the SNWTP will pass through Henan, including four project counties. Pollution in the \nproject  area  has  the  potential  to  adversely  affect  SNWTP.  Thus  protecting  the  conveyor  from \nlocal  sources  of  pollution  along  the entire  route,  including the  route  passing  through  the  project \narea, is vital. \n \n8. \nThe  Government  recognizes  that  adequate  environmental  protection  and  pollution \ncontrols  are  preconditions  for  sustainable  economic  growth.  The  Green  Plan4  emphasizes \nwastewater management and pollution control, including in the HRB. The Hai River Plan (HRP), \nan  action  program  under  the  Green  Plan,  sets  pollution  control  targets  for  2000  and  2010, \nrequiring that urban environmental pollution and ecological damage be controlled by 2010. \n \nADB has provided significant assistance in the HRB, including a TA5 to the Government to \n9. \ndevelop  an  implementation  strategy  for  the  HRP.  The  TA  built  on  the  Government's  plans  by \ndeveloping  prioritized  and  suitably  phased  investment  packages;  and  formulating  financial \nfor  pollution  control. \nmanagement,  regulatory  enforcement,  and \nSubsequently  ADB  approved  two  wastewater  treatment  projects  in  the  HRB  in  Tianjin6  and \nHebei7 province, and a TA8 to strengthen water resource management, focusing on the HRB. The \nGovernment  has  requested  ADB  assistance  to  control  pollution  in  Henan  and  Shandong \nprovinces, which are upstream areas of the HRB.  \n \n10. \nTo  address  the  major  HRB  pollution  issues,  the  State  Environmental  Protection \nAdministration prepared the 10th Five-Year Plan for water pollution prevention and control in the \nHRB  (2001\u20132005).  The  plan  highlights  several  key  actions:  (i)  reduce  the  gross  amount  of \npollutants, (ii) protect drinking water source areas, and (iii) address transboundary water pollution \nissues.  The  strategy  focuses  on  integrating  municipal  and  industrial  wastewater  treatment \nfacilities  supported  by  establishing  effective  wastewater  companies  with  sound  cost  recovery  to \nensure sustainable facility operations. The central and provincial governments are committed to \nproviding supporting investment resources. \n \n11. \nAs a subsidiary plan to the HRP, HPG formulated the Henan Hai River Plan (HHRP). The \nplan principles include an integrated approach for pollution control, pollution control by river reach \nto  ensure  that  water  quality  targets  are  achieved,  and  local  administrative  initiatives  to  improve \nresponsibility  for  pollution  control.  The  HHRP  proposes  25  municipal  wastewater  treatment \nprojects  and  49  industrial  pollution  control  projects,  and  requires  that  all  municipalities  have  at \n\nframeworks \n\ninstitutional \n\n                                                 \n3   The SNWTP proposes to move 44 billion cubic meters of water per year through three canals from the Yangtze River \n\nBasin to parched areas of northern PRC. \n\n4   An umbrella program across the country with the long-term target for 2010. \n5   ADB.  1998.

Manila. \n\n\fleast one municipal wastewater treatment plant by 2005 and that all counties have at least one \nmunicipal wastewater treatment plant by 2007.  \n \n12. \nOf the 25 planned municipal wastewater treatment projects, 6 are being implemented with \nnational funds, 9 are proposed for ADB financing under the Project, and the remaining 10 will be \nimplemented by other means. Most of the industrial pollution control projects are in progress with \ndomestic  financing  sources.  On  2003,  the  HHRP  was  expanded  to  include  an  additional  24 \nmunicipal wastewater treatment plants in the counties\u20144 of these are included for ADB financing \nunder the Project. \n \n13. \nIn the PRC domestic water sector, responsibility for urban water and wastewater services \nrests with municipal and county governments. Responding to national priority plans and provincial \nstrategies,  locally  funded  county  programs  are  under  way  to  rehabilitate  and  expand  urban \nwastewater  systems.  The  key  limitations  of  the  counties\u2019  response  to  the  national  planning \ninitiatives  have  been  financial  constraints  and  weak  technical  capacity  for  planning  and \nmanagement of environmental infrastructure.  \n \nThe Government recognizes the need to strengthen the technical and financial capabilities \n14. \nof agencies responsible for wastewater management to improve the efficiency and sustainability \nof  the  substantial  investment  required.  In  particular,  government  policies  aim  to  strengthen  the \ncommercial  orientation  of  wastewater  and  water  services  by  promoting  the  establishment  of \nautonomous  and  financially  viable  wastewater  and  water  enterprises  with  limited  private  sector \nparticipation, including through partnerships with private sector operators. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n15. \nThe major issues involved in the rapidly deteriorating quality of surface and groundwater \nand the urban environment are (i) lack of environmental infrastructure, particularly in counties in \nthe  HRB;  (ii)  inadequate  water  resource  management;  and  (iii)  weak  financial  and  institutional \ncapacity of the municipal service providers.  \n \n16. \nThe Project will support physical investments to reduce the present high level of untreated \nwastewater.  Demands  for  water  for  domestic  and  industrial  use  have  been  steadily  increasing, \nimposing  increasing  pressure  on  water  resources.  The  Project\u2019s  physical  components  for \nwastewater management will increase collection and treatment of urban wastewater in the project \ncities to more than 70%; the water supply component will provide adequate water supply in terms \nof quantity and quality to 98% of urban residents in the project cities. \n \n17. \nImproving  water  quality  across  an  area  as  large  as  the  HRB  presents  many  technical \nchallenges in water resource management. Actions or investments to reduce pollution may have \nwidely dispersed effects, well beyond the immediate area, and may show their effects slowly over \ntime. Improving water quality therefore requires a basin perspective, considering and coordinating \nthe  interests  of  all  stakeholders.  It  also  requires  a  long-term  focus  on  environmental  indicators, \nrecognizing  that  investments  in  wastewater  management  are  vital.  The  Project  will  help  the \nproject  municipalities  and  counties  prepare  integrated  water  resource  management  plans  to \nachieve comprehensive watershed management. \n \n18. \nAlthough  HPG\u2019s  strong  capacity  is  expected  to  reduce  risks  posed  by  weak  capacity  in \ncounty, municipal, and city governments, the Project faces two different challenges in institutional \ncapacity.  First,  most  of  the  project  treatment  plants  will  be  built  in  counties  and  cities  without \nexisting plants. New capacity to effectively manage and operate the plants must be acquired and \nmaintained. Second, the Project will mainly involve county implementing and operating agencies, \na lower level of government than usually involved in ADB projects. Capacity of these agencies is \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nlower  than  in  other  ADB  projects  in  the  PRC,  and  ADB  lacks  experience  in  anticipating  and \nmanaging the problems counties may face in implementing subprojects.  \n \n19. \nThe Project\u2019s institutional capacity-building component addresses the issue of capacity of \nimplementing and operating agencies. Supplementary Appendix A presents an assessment of the \ntechnical  and  managerial  capacities  of  the  sector  institutions.  The  limited  operations  capacity \npresents an opportunity for private sector participation, through contracts to operate the treatment \nplants. The Project will help create the environment necessary for private sector participation by \npursuing  tariff  reform,  full  cost  recovery,  and  corporatization,  which  are  the  necessary \nprerequisites for such private sector involvement.  \n \n20. \nPolicy  Dialogue.  In  support  of  the  Project,  policy  dialogue  involved  (i)  promotion  of \nintegrated  water  resource  management;  (ii)  municipal  wastewater  management;  (iii)  industrial \npollution control; (iv) cost recovery and tariff reform; and (v) enterprise reform, governance, and \npromotion  of  investment  diversification  in  the  sector.  Appendix  2  provides  the  policy  framework \naddressing issues and actions required. \n \nThe HRP provides a policy and strategic framework for pollution control and prevention in \n21. \nthe HRB. The Project will help HPG implement its HRP water quality improvement strategies. An \nintegrated  and  coordinated  basin  approach  to  water  resource  planning  and  environmental \nmanagement  is  vital  for  optimum  results.  Treated  wastewater  is  a  potentially  valuable  water \nresource  to  be  considered  in  water  resource  planning,  and  demand  management  can  play  an \nimportant role in water conservation and alleviating water stress.  \n \n22. \nThe  success  of  municipal  wastewater  management  policy  will  impact  on  the  sector \nobjective  of  pollution  reduction  and  on  the  cost-effectiveness  of  wastewater  management  and \noperations. Allowing  industries  to  discharge  their  wastewater  to  urban sewer  systems  (provided \ntheir  wastewater  has  been  properly  pretreated  to  required  standards)  can  greatly  improve  the \ncost-effectiveness  of  industrial  wastewater  treatment.  The  centralized  municipal  wastewater \ntreatment  plant  (WWTP)  normally  results  in  overall  economies  of  scale.  Local  regulations  are \nneeded  to  ensure  that  (i)  household  connections  and  local  tertiary  sewers  are  provided,  (ii) \neffluent  strength  is  maintained,  and  (iii)  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  facilities  are \nprotected from hazardous pollution discharges.  \n \n23. \nCentralized  treatment  of  pretreated  industrial  wastewater  is  only  viable  where  effective \nmonitoring and enforcement arrangements are implemented. Currently in the project cities, only \nlimited  pretreatment  of  industrial  wastewater  exists;  thus  local  governments  must  take  actions \nbefore allowing these enterprises to discharge their wastewater to the WWTPs constructed under \nthe Project. \n \n24. \nAdequate  funds  for  the  repayment  of  loans,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and \nultimate  replacement  of  project  facilities  by  the  project  wastewater/water  companies  must  be \nassured.  Tariff  structures  and  levels  should  promote  the  economic  use  of  resources  as  well  as \nmeet financial objectives. Tariffs, therefore, need to meet the principle of full cost recovery and be \ndesigned  to  meet  local  circumstances.  To  protect  the  poor  from  water  tariff  increases,  some \ncounties introduced water tariff waivers and the government implemented social assistance or a \nminimum living standard scheme for households with income below the poverty line. \n \n25. \nSustainability  requires  establishing  wastewater/water  companies  that  are  managerially \nand financially autonomous. High governance standards are required to retain public confidence. \nThe  public  sector  cannot  finance  the  large  investments  needed  in  the  PRC  water  sector. \nDiversified investment channels must be promoted to achieve sector goals. Private investors can \nalso add value by improving efficiency and service standards. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n \nExternal  Assistance.  To  help  the  Government  develop  and  implement  its  strategies  in \n26. \nthe  wastewater  management  and  water  supply  sector,  external  assistance  has  been  provided \nmainly by ADB, World Bank, and Japan Bank for International Cooperation. ADB has provided 11 \nloans  including  2  within  the  HRB  in  Tianjin  and  Hebei,  totaling  more  than  $1  billion,  for  urban \nwastewater  management  and  water  supply  projects.  To  maximize  development  impact,  ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement has been targeted in densely populated urban areas.    \n \n27. \nADB has financed 32 TAs in the PRC for more than $20 million to address issues relating \nto  water  resource  management,  urban  wastewater,  and  water  supply.  ADB  assistance  has \nresulted  in  more  rational  pricing  of  water,  introduction  of  wastewater  tariffs,  major  increases  in \nwater  tariffs,  implementation  of  commercial  principles,  and  introduction  of  private  sector \nparticipation. These improvements are fundamental for making the wastewater management and \nwater supply sector financially and operationally sustainable.  \n \n28. \nThe World Bank has participated in 21 urban environment projects, including wastewater \nmanagement-water supply. It is currently preparing a similar project that will assist county cities in \nthe  Huai  River  Basin  of  Henan.  The  ADB  Project  is  designed  to  complement  the  World  Bank \nproject, and be consistent in terms of sector policy and institutional development issues. Japan, \nthrough Japan Bank for International Cooperation, is the largest bilateral source of aid to the PRC \nand is mainly involved in physical infrastructure, water resource development, and environmental \nimprovement  projects.  Bilateral  aid  agencies,  from  Australia,  Canada,  Finland,  Germany,  Italy, \nNorway,  Sweden,  United  Kingdom,  and  United  States,  are  also  involved  in  the  wastewater \nmanagement and water supply sector, although on a smaller scale. \n \nLessons Learned. Experience in the wastewater management and water supply sector in \n29. \nthe  PRC,  although  limited,  indicates  that  projects  are  well  planned  and  implemented,  and \nwastewater and water tariffs are increased as required. Willingness-to-pay analysis indicates that \nconsumers  are  willing  to  pay  substantially  higher  prices  for  water,  and  to  a  certain  extent,  are \nwilling  to  pay  for  wastewater  treatment.  Issues  related  to  tariff  levels,  cost  recovery,  and \ncommercial  orientation  of  water  utilities  were  carefully  addressed  during  project  preparation. \nLessons  learned  from  previous  projects,  particularly  from  the  two  ongoing  HRB  projects,  are \nreflected  in  the  project  design.  These  lessons  include  (i)  greater  focus  on  institutional \nstrengthening  measures  to  improve  corporate  governance,  (ii)  improved  provincial  coordination, \nand (iii) financial and institutional arrangements for proper O&M.  \n \n30. \nADB\u2019s  three  strategic  objectives  for  the  PRC  are  to  (i)  improve  economic  efficiency,  (ii) \npromote  growth  to  reduce  poverty  in  poor  interior  provinces,  and  (iii)  enhance  environmental \nprotection and natural resource management. Proper management of wastewater and adequate \nwater  supply  is  essential  to  enhance  the  living  standards and  productivity  of  urban  populations, \nprotect water resources, and sustain levels of economic growth. In the wastewater management \nand water supply sector, ADB is focusing on (i) improving wastewater and water supply services \nthrough investment on physical infrastructure; (ii) promoting improved corporate governance and \ncommercial  management  to  enhance  the  potential  for  future  private  sector  involvement;  (iii) \nimproving  cost  recovery  by  strengthening  tariff  systems  and  structures;  and  (iv)  ensuring  water \nresource conservation and environmental protection through continuing support for legislative and \nregulatory provisions. The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country operational strategy. \n \n31. \nSector  Loan  Approach.  The  Project  was  formulated  in  line  with  the  HHRP,  which \nrequires that each municipal city have at least one municipal WWTP by 2005, and each county \ncity have at least one municipal WWTP by 2007. In view of the many small similar subprojects9 \n\n                                                 \n9   The physical investment size ranges from $6 million to $13 million, except for the Anyang subproject. \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nand the tight schedule for construction, the Project could not be processed as a standard project \nloan. The Project has followed procedures described here for a sector loan.  \n \n32. \nThe  Project  will  support  an  area  and  time  slice  of  the  Government  HHRP.  The  physical \ninvestments  will  be  limited  to  the  priority  cities  and  counties  in  the  HRB  with  serious \nenvironmental infrastructure deficiencies, and interest and commitment of the local government. \nThe sector loan approach is based on the following:  \n \n\nThe Government\u2019s sector policies, development objectives, and approach to urban \nin \nenvironmental \nimplementing  policies  has  been  satisfactory  and  the  Government  is  continually \nupdating its sector policies with ADB support. \n\ninfrastructure  development  are  well \n\nformulated.  Progress \n\nThe  sector  institutions  are  well  developed,  and  with  additional  strengthening  and \nsupport  provided  under  the  Project,  they  will  have  the  capacity  to  implement  the \nsector  investment  plan,  particularly  municipal  and  county  governments.  The \nExecuting Agency, HPG has substantial experience implementing similar projects.  \n\nThe  sector  investment  plan  and  the  planned  subprojects  are  well  conceived  and \nappropriately formulated to meet the priority needs of the HHRP. \n\nThe  Government  has  submitted  the  three  documents  required  for  sector  lending: \n(a) sector development plan, (b) description of sector policies, and (c) assessment \nof capacity to implement the plan. \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n33. \nThe  overall  impact  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  urban  environment  and  public  health \nthrough  improved  wastewater  management  and  water  supply.  The  outcome  is  that  water  and \nwastewater  utility  companies  in  the  project  cities  provide  sustainable  water  supply  and \nwastewater services managed on commercial principles and environmentally sound practices by \n(i)  increasing  collection  and  treatment  of  domestic  and  industrial  wastewater,  (ii)  providing \nadequate public water supplies, and (iii) improving the quality of surface and groundwater in and \ndownstream  of  the  project  cities.  To  achieve  this  outcome,  the  Project  will  support  (i)  creating \nmunicipal  wastewater  companies  and  making  them  efficient  and  commercially  managed,  (ii) \nimproving  cost  recovery  from  users  through  improved  tariffs  with  gradual  increases  to  full  cost \nrecovery, and (iii) using a comprehensive approach to river basin pollution prevention and control.  \n \nThe  Government  has  proposed  19  subprojects10  (15  for  wastewater  management  and  4 \n34. \nfor water supply) in four municipalities and 15 counties in the HRB. Appendix 3 lists the candidate \nsubprojects. The Fact-Finding Mission reviewed 8 of the 19 candidate subprojects, representing \nthe  four  municipalities  in  the  HRB.  The  review  was  to  demonstrate  the  approaches  and \nprocedures  of  subproject  selection  and  appraisal.  The  appraisal  indicates  that  all  8  subprojects \nare  ready  for  implementation  and  viable  in  terms  of  technical,  institutional,  social,  financial, \neconomic,  and  environmental  aspects.  Supplementary  Appendix  B  presents  the  summary \nappraisal  of  the  8  representative  subprojects.  Supplementary  Appendix  C  presents  individual \nappraisal reports for the 8 subprojects, with their feasibility study reports. \n \n\n                                                 \n10  A subproject is defined as a package of infrastructure investment for wastewater management or water supply in one \n\nmunicipal city or county city.   \n\n\f35. \nThe  remaining  possible  11  subprojects  are  being  formulated  in  accordance  with  the \nagreed selection criteria and appraisal procedures. The formulation procedures mainly include (i) \npreparation  of  a  feasibility  study  based  on  the  draft  final  TA  report,  and  (ii)  appraisal  including \npreparation of a subproject appraisal report (SAR). For the selection of subprojects, priority was \ngiven to subprojects that conform to key actions identified in the HHRP, including (i) reduction of \nthe gross amount of pollutants, (ii) protection of drinking water source areas, and (iii) resolution of \ntransboundary  water  pollution  disputes.  Appendix  4  provides  details  on  additional  subproject \nidentification, selection, preparation, and appraisal.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n2. \n\n1. \n\nWastewater Management Component \n\n36. \nThe  Project  comprises  physical  components  covering  construction  of  wastewater \nmanagement  and  water  supply  facilities,  and  an  associated  capacity-building  component  to \nsupport project management and implementation by building capacity of the project management \noffices  (PMOs)  and  implementing  agencies  (IAs).  Policy  dialogue  under  the  Project  supports \nthese  components  and  contributes  to  ongoing  dialogue  with  the  Government.  Supplementary \nAppendix D describes the 8 representative subprojects. \n \n \n \n37. \nThe  wastewater  management  component  addresses  the  infrastructure  deficiencies  for \ndomestic  and  industrial  wastewater  collection  and  treatment.  The  wastewater  subprojects  will \nserve urban areas of a municipal city or a city proper of a county. Facilities include sewers, pump \nstations,  WWTPs,  and  treatment  facilities  for  effluent  reuse.  Most  existing  collection  systems \nwere  developed  piecemeal  and  have  many  deficiencies  related  to  inadequate  ground  cover, \nadverse slope, and inappropriate routing of sewers. Most are combined and collect storm-water \nrun-off during wet weather, as well as wastewater. Major portions of the collection systems will be \nrebuilt  under  the  individual  subprojects.  Wastewater  treatment  will  improve  surface  and \ngroundwater  quality  in  and  downstream  of  the  project  cities  and  contribute  to  reduced \ntransboundary pollution between Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces. \n \n \n \nThe  water  supply  component  addresses  the  immediate  need  to  resolve  the  pollution \n38. \nproblem  with  drinking  water  sources  by  reducing  reliance  on  abstraction  of  groundwater  from \nshallow  wells.  Raw  water  sources  for  urban  water  supplies  are  becoming  severely  affected  by \nwastewater pollution of both surface and shallow groundwater. In addition, shallow groundwater \nsources  are  being  severely  drawn  down,  causing  consolidation  of  soils  and  consequent \nsubsidence of urban areas. Typical facilities under the water supply subproject include distribution \npipelines  and  water  treatment  plants.  The  improved  quality  and  availability  of  treated  water  will \nbring health, environmental, and social benefits to the communities. \n \n \n \n39. \nthe  weak  capacity  of \nimplementing  and  operating  agencies  and  will  help  ensure  the  financial  and  institutional \nsustainability of the Project. The component comprises a combination of consulting services and \nvarious  training  programs,  and  will  predominantly  target  local  IAs  and  PMOs.  Specifically,  this \ncomponent  will  help  the  project  companies  (i)  establish  themselves  as  autonomous  and \nfinancially  sustainable  utility  companies  that  can  effectively  and  efficiently  meet  the  service \nobligations set out; and (ii) prepare a common operating manual and financial reporting manual, \nas well as improve public awareness of key project-related issues such as benefits accruing from \nsanitation  investments.  In  addition  it  will  help  the  project  companies  and  their  parent  municipal \n\ninstitutional  capacity-building  component  addresses \n\nInstitutional Capacity-Building Component \n\nWater Supply Component \n\nThe \n\n3. \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nSpecial Features \n\nand  county  governments  (i)  comply  with  relevant  national  policies  for  cost  recovery,  tariff,  and \nenterprise  reform  of  the  water  and  wastewater  management  sector;  and  (ii)  develop  plans  and \nprograms  for  private  sector  participation  in  the  water  and  wastewater  management  sector  that \nsupport government policies for improving efficiency and service standards. Appendix 5 provides \ndetails of the capacity-building measures/activities. \n \nC. \n \n40. \nFocus of Capacity Building on Counties. The Project is one of the first ADB projects in \nthe  PRC  wastewater  and  water  supply  sectors  to  involve  mostly  fourth-tier  governments.  This \ncharacteristic  has  several  implications.  First,  the  physical  size  and  cost  of  the  possible \nsubprojects  are  much  smaller  than  previously  ADB-financed  wastewater  or  water  projects. \nSecond,  the  majority  of  participating  cities  and  counties  will  have  limited  or  no  previous \ninvolvement with foreign-financed infrastructure projects, and certainly no substantive experience \nwith ADB requirements. \n \n41. \nAt  this  level,  project  management  and  professional  skills  capacity  are  significantly  less \nthan that found in municipal and provincial cities. A partial counterbalance is that the subprojects \nare generally smaller and use well-proven approaches and technologies. However, the need for \nsignificant  capacity  building  during  project  implementation  is  evident.  The  Project  will  provide \nconsulting services and training with a focus on human resource development.  \n \n42. \nThe project implementation consultants to be recruited under the Project will work with the \nprovincial  PMO,  local  IAs,  and  relevant  officials  from  municipal  and  county  governments.  They \nwill  provide  assistance  and  advice  in  the  following  areas:  (i)  project  management  and \nfinancial \ninstitutional  and  managerial \nimplementation  support; \nmanagement;  (iv)  utility  tariff  setting,  billing,  and  income  collection;  and  (v)  operational \nmanagement.  Other  capacity-building  activities  include  training  in  project  implementation  and \nutility operations, staff exchanges and secondments, and exposure to best practices in the PRC \nand internationally.  \n \n43. \nIntegrated  Water  Resource  Management.  ADB  has  assisted  the  Government  in \nformulating policy and designing investment programs based on an integrated approach to water \nand environmental management. The ADB assistance has drawn upon its growing experience in \naddressing  basin  environmental  issues  through  ongoing  projects  in  the  HRB  and  in  other \nenvironmental  improvement  projects  in  the  PRC.  The  Project  will  complement  these  efforts  by \nassisting  the  project  municipal  and  county  governments  in  formulating  a  practical  approach  to \nprovide  urban  environmental  services  and  introduce  the  principles  of  integrated  water  resource \nmanagement and pollution control. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nimprovements; \n\n(iii) \n\n(ii) \n\n44. \nThe total project cost is estimated at $200.0 million equivalent, comprising $100.0 million \nin  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $100.0  million  equivalent  in local  currency  costs,  including  taxes \nand duties of approximately $16.3 million. Table 1 provides a summary of the cost estimates, and \nAppendix 6 gives detailed cost estimates and the assumptions behind them. The cost estimates \nare based on the 8 representative subprojects and the remaining candidate subprojects at mid-\n2005 prices.  \n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n45. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nof 5 years, an interest rate to determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The Government has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on \nthe basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n46. \nThe ADB loan will cover the foreign exchange cost of the Project, including interest during \nconstruction.  The  PRC  Government  will  relend  to  HPG.  HPG  will  onlend  to  municipal \ngovernments,  which  will  onlend  to  city  and  county  governments,  which  will  onlend  to  the  IAs. \nHPG will retain $1,595,000 of the loan proceeds for implementation of the capacity building and \ntraining programs under the Project. All relending and onlending will be on the same terms and \nconditions as the ADB loan. The IAs will assume the foreign exchange and interest rate variation \nrisks  for  the  ADB  loan.  Appendix  7  illustrates  the  flow  of  funds  and  relending  and  onlending \narrangements.  \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal  \n\nSubtotal (1) \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\nLocal Currency  \n\n2.

A \nproject leading provincial group has been established to oversee preparation and implementation \nof the Project. This group\u2500comprising staff from the Financial Bureau, Development and Reform \nCommission,  Construction  Bureau,  Water  Resources  Bureau,  and  Environmental  Protection \nBureau\u2500is led by the executive vice governor of Henan province.  \n \n49. \nHPG  has  set  up  the  Henan  PMO  (HPMO)  to  coordinate  implementation  of  externally \nfunded  projects.  HPMO  will  play  a  vital  coordination  role  during  both  project  preparation  and \nproject implementation, and ensure smooth communications with the local PMOs and IAs. HPMO \nwill  recruit  the  consultants  to  be  engaged  under  the  Project.  It  has  considerable  capacity  for \nproject  implementation,  and  is  experienced  and  has  performed  well  in  implementing  major \nforeign-funded projects, including the ongoing ADB-funded agriculture project.11  \n \nEach  municipality  involved  in  the  Project  has  or  will  set  up  a  local  project  leading group \n50. \nand  a  municipal  PMO  to  coordinate  aspects  of  project  preparation  and  implementation  falling \nwithin  their  respective  jurisdictions.  Each  county  city  planning  to  participate  has  set  up  a  local \nproject  leading  group  and  a  county  PMO  to  coordinate  aspects  of  project  preparation  and \nimplementation falling within their respective jurisdictions. These municipalities and county cities \nhave  experience  managing  domestic  projects  but  not  foreign-funded  wastewater  management \nand  water  supply  projects.  As  the  capacity  of  the  institutions  is  considered  weak,  appropriate \ncapacity-building measures were identified and institutional capacity will be strengthened through \nthe Project. Supplementary Appendix E presents a detailed assessment of the project institutions \nand  the  capacity-building  measures  included  under  the  Project.  Appendix  8  shows  the  project \nmanagement arrangements.  \n \n51. \nFor each subproject, a wastewater or water supply utility company will be the IA. The IA \neither  is  or  will  be  established  and  will  (i)  be  a  properly  constituted  enterprise  company \nestablished  under  the  provisions  of  PRC  law,  and  become  largely  managerially  and  financially \nautonomous;  (ii)  act  as  IA  for  the  relevant  subproject,  working  and  liaising  closely  with  the \nrelevant  local  PMO,  and  various  departments  and  agencies  of  local  government;  (iii)  carry  out \nprocurement  of  civil  works  and  equipment  under  its  subproject;  (iv)  carry  out  O&M  of  project \nfacilities; and (v) will be responsible for debt servicing. The Project\u2019s capacity-building component \nis designed to take into account weaknesses identified by the financial management assessment \nof  the  8  representative  subprojects.  With  this  provision,  the  Project\u2019s  financial  management \narrangements are considered satisfactory.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Preparation and Appraisal \n\n52. \nIn  addition  to  the  8  feasibility  studies  reviewed  by  ADB,  the  identification,  selection, \npreparation and appraisal of the remaining 11 subprojects for inclusion in the Project will follow \nthe three stage approach below. \n \n53. \nSubproject Identification and Selection. The subprojects have been or will be selected \nin  accordance  with  the  following  basic  criteria:  (i)  inclusion  of  the  subproject  in  the  HHRP;  (ii) \nconfirmation  by  the  participating  local  government  on  its  ability  and  willingness  to  arrange \ncounterpart financing; (iii) confirmation by the participating local government on its willingness to \n                                                 \n11  ADB.  2000.

The  participating  city  government  and  IA  will,  with  the \nassistance  of  HPMO,  prepare  a  feasibility  study  for  each  of  the  remaining  11  subprojects.  The \nfeasibility study report will include EIA; resettlement plan (RP) (if required); rationale; scope and \ncomponents; \nfinancing  plan; \nimplementation  arrangements;  and  financial,  economic,  and  institutional  analysis,  including \nfinancial management assessment and social dimensions. The consultants to be engaged under \nthe  Project  and  responsible  staff  of  the  county/municipal  PMO  will  review  the  report,  before \nsubmitting it to HPMO for appraisal.  \n \n55. \nSubproject Appraisal and Approval. HPMO will be responsible for the appraisal of the \nsubprojects  and  has  commissioned  the  Henan  Engineering  Consulting  Company,  a  subsidiary \norganization  of  Henan  Development  Reform  Commission  (HDRC),  to  undertake  detailed \nappraisals on its behalf. HDRC will prepare a subproject appraisal report (SAR) for consideration \nby HPG. The SAR will follow the format of the SARs for the 8 representative subprojects. HPG \nwill appraise the subprojects in accordance with the criteria agreed upon by the Government and \nADB. The SARs for the first subproject and for any subproject exceeding $10 million equivalent \nwill  be  sent  to  ADB  for  approval.  The  remaining  SARs  will  be  sent  to  ADB  for  information. \nSupplementary Appendix F provides details on the subproject appraisal criteria. \n \n56. \nFor  the  environmental  safeguard  requirements,  an  SEIA  covering  the  8  representative \nsubprojects  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  PRC\u2019s  EIA  Technical  Guidelines  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (May  2003).  The  EIA  reports  for  individual  subprojects \nused  methodologies  and  standards  consistent  with  relevant  guidelines  established  by  the  State \nEnvironmental Protection Administration, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The \nindividual EIA reports were approved by municipal or provincial environmental protection bureaus \nfollowing  domestic  procedures.  ADB  reviewed  the  SEIA  and  posted  it  on  the  ADB  website  in \nMarch 2005 to meet the 120-day disclosure requirement. \n \n57. \nThe remaining 11 subprojects have received the same extent of environmental safeguard \nscrutiny, modeled on the EIAs for the 8 representative subprojects and the SEIA. The EIAs for the \nremaining  subprojects  were  approved  by  the  municipal  or  provincial  environmental  protection \nbureaus. HPMO completed the SEIA for the remaining subprojects following the format of the first \nSEIA,  reviewed  by  the  Appraisal  Mission,  and  submitted  for  confirmation  to  the  provincial \nenvironmental protection bureau. Upon confirmation by the bureau, the SEIA has been posted on \nthe ADB website to meet the 120-day disclosure requirement.  \n \n58. \nRPs for the 8 representative subprojects were prepared in accordance with the PRC Land \nLaw  and  the  ADB  involuntary  resettlement  policy.12  In  April  2005,  ADB  reviewed  and  approved \nthe draft RPs. The RPs were subsequently finalized based on ADB comments, approved by local \ngovernment,  and  disclosed  to  relevant  offices,  villages,  and  people  affected.  (Supplementary \nAppendix  G).  For  the  remaining  subprojects,  a  resettlement  framework  was  prepared  and \napproved  by  ADB  (Supplementary  Appendix  H).  Draft  RPs  have  been  prepared  for  other \ncandidate subprojects and will be upgraded using the representative subproject RPs as models. \nA poverty and social assessment conducted for the 19 subprojects indicates no ethnic minorities \nwill be affected by the Project. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. In Handbook on Resettlement. Appendix 1. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n59. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  from  2005  to  2010  (Appendix  9).  This \nschedule is considered realistic because the project implementation structure is already in place, \nand  preparatory  works  are  under  way.  ADB\u2019s  successful  experience  with  similar  projects  in  the \nPRC  and  the  basic  level  of  technology  and  modest  scale  of  the  individual  subprojects  indicate \nthat this schedule is realistic and achievable. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n60. \nADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor  Procurement,  and  the  PRC\u2019s  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  and  procurement  regulations. \nAppendix 10 provides indicative procurement packages. All civil works contracts are estimated at \nbelow  $10  million,  and  will  be  procured  through  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  as  local \ncontractors have the expertise and capacity to undertake these works. Since these works involve \nmainly labor costs, international contractors are not likely to be interested in the work. However, \nin  accordance  with  ADB  requirements,  foreign  contractors  may  participate  in  bidding  for  local \ncompetitive bidding contracts.  \n \n61.  Major  contracts  for  equipment  and  materials  estimated  at  more  than  $1  million  will  be \nundertaken  through  ADB  international  competitive  bidding  procedures,  while  lower  value \ncontracts  will  be  procured  by  international  shopping  or  direct  purchase  if  below  $100,000.  The \ninternationally  tendered  equipment  packages  for  the  main  process  equipment  will  include  the \ntechnical support necessary for ensuring proper system coordination and integration, as well as \ninstallation,  testing,  commissioning,  and  training.  This  approach  will  ensure  quality  control  in \nequipment installation and operator training, utilizing the manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 specialist \ntechnical experts for successful execution of the total process system. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n\n62. \nThe  Government  requested,  and  ADB  approved,  advance  procurement  action  for  civil \nworks, and recruitment of project implementation consultants up to contract signing. To meet the \ntarget of construction of wastewater collection and water supply systems by 2007, the six project \ncounties  for  the  nine  subprojects  have  to  initiate  early  rehabilitation  of  pumping  stations,  sewer \nnetworks,  and  water  distribution  systems;  and  construction  of  wastewater  treatment  plants  and \nwater treatment plants (Appendix 10). Advance procurement action is necessary to support these \nworks.  ADB  has  also  in  principle  approved  retroactive  financing  up  to  $8  million  equivalent  for \nexpenditures  incurred  on  the  nine  subprojects  from  30  April  2005  to  the  date  of  loan \neffectiveness.13 The Government was advised that ADB approval of advance procurement action \nand retroactive financing will not in any way commit ADB to approve the proposed loan, and ADB \nfinancing  will  be  dependent  upon  compliance  with  all  aspects  of  ADB  procedural  requirements, \nincluding compliance of the Government and HPG with relevant provisions of the loan and project \nagreements and ADB guidelines.  \n \n\n6. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n63. \nProvision  is  made  for  28  person-months  of  international  and  300  person-months  of \ndomestic  consulting  services  to  support  HPMO,  local  PMOs,  and  IAs  in  project  implementation \nand  capacity  building  to  be  funded  under  the  Project.  The  staff  of  IAs  need  to  strengthen  their \nexpertise  in  (i)  project  management  and  implementation  support,  (ii)  efficient  operating \n\n                                                 \n13  These actions were reported in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) in May 2005.  \n\n\fprocedures,  (iii)  preventive  maintenance,  (iv)  financial  management,  (v)  social  impact  and \ninformation  system \nenvironmental  monitoring,  (vi)  business  planning  and  management \ndevelopment,  (vii)  human  resource  development,  and  (viii)  corporate  governance.  Capacity \nbuilding for IAs will be achieved through consultant inputs, hands-on training on project facilities, \ntraining in the PRC, and international training financed by the loan. The majority of the consulting \nservices  will  be  provided  by  domestic,  not  international,  consultants.  Because  this  type  of \ncapacity building is generally not new to the PRC, domestic experts have this knowledge and can \nprovide more cost-effective support. However, the overall capacity-building program is large and \ndiverse,  and  international  consultants  will  provide  general  direction  to  capacity-building  content. \nAn international consulting firm will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  with  simplified  technical \nproposals  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants.  Domestic  consultants  will  also  be  recruited  for  social  impact  and  environmental \nmonitoring in accordance with arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. Appendix 11 presents outline terms of reference for consulting services. \n \n\n7. \n\nAnticorruption \n\nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained \n\nthe \n64. \nGovernment/Borrower  and  Executing  Agency.  Consistent  with \nto  good \ngovernance,  accountability  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\nto  and  discussed  with \nits  commitment \n\n8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n65. \nHPMO will establish an imprest account after loan effectiveness in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook  (January  2001).  Disbursements  from  the  imprest  account  will  be \nsupported  by  an  appropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related  documentation.  Such \ndocumentation will demonstrate, among other things, that the goods/services (i) were produced in \nand procured from ADB members, and (ii) are eligible for ADB financing. The initial amount to be \ndeposited into the imprest account will not exceed the estimated capital expenditure for the next 6 \nmonths, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The statement of expenditures procedure \nmay be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures; any individual payment to be reimbursed \nor liquidated under the procedure will not exceed $200,000. \n \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n66. \nHPMO  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports  indicating  progress  made,  problems \nencountered  during  the  review  period,  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the  problems, \nproposed  program  of  activities,  and  progress  expected  for  the  following  quarter.  HPMO  will \nensure that reports are consolidated and submitted to ADB in a timely manner. Within 6 months \nof physical completion of the Project, HPMO, with support from the municipal and county PMOs \nand  IAs,  will  submit  to  ADB  a  completion  report  that  describes  institutional  strengthening  and \nwater  sector  policy  reform;  implementation  of  the  wastewater  management  and  water  supply \nsystems; other project implementation matters; actual costs incurred in relation to cost estimates, \nbenefits, and beneficiary consultations; and other information requested by ADB.   \n \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\n67. \nHPG and each IA will maintain records and accounts that identify the goods and services \nfinanced  from  the  loan  proceeds,  financing  resources  received,  expenditures  incurred  for  the \nProject, and use of local funds. The accounts will be established and maintained in accordance \nwith  sound  accounting  principles  and  appropriate  accounting  standards.  The  annual  project \naccounts of HPG and the IAs, and each set of financial statements for the IAs, will be audited by \nauditors acceptable to ADB. A separate audit report on the use of imprest account and statement \nof  expenditure  procedure  will  be  provided  to  ADB.  The  audit  reports,  management  letter,  and \nrelated financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the \nfiscal  year  to  which  they  relate,  or  the  project  closing  date  if  earlier.  ADB  informed  the \nGovernment  of  its  policy  on  submission  of  audited  accounts,  which  covers  failure  of  submitting \naudited  accounts  and  financial  statements  by  the  due  date.  A  formal  warning  will  be  issued  for \naccounts more than 6 months overdue, and disbursements will be suspended for accounts that \nare 12 months overdue. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n68. \nProject performance monitoring system (PPMS) indicators include service levels, treated \nwastewater  quality  and  other  measures  of  operational  performance,  percentage  of  wastewater \ncollected  and  treated,  user  satisfaction  with  the  urban  environment,  and  relevant  economic  and \nhealth data to monitor project impacts. The relevance and practicability of data collection for the \nindicators  were  confirmed  with  HPMO.  Appendix  12  outlines  the  contents  of  the  PPMS. \nSupplementary  Appendix  I  presents  methodologies  for  health  benefit  estimation  and  monitoring \nhealth benefits to be achieved.  \n \nAt  the  beginning  of  project  implementation,  HPMO  and  the  municipal  PMOs,  with  the \n69. \nassistance  of  consultants,  will  develop  comprehensive  PPMS  procedures  to  systematically \ngenerate data on inputs and outputs of the project components; and the socioeconomic, health, \nand  environmental  indicators  to  measure  project  impacts.  HPMO  and  the  municipal  PMOs  will \nrefine  the  PPMS  framework,  confirm  achievable  targets,  firm  up  monitoring  and  recording \narrangements,  and  establish  systems  and  procedures  no  later  than  6  months  after  project \ninception. \n \nUnder the PPMS framework, baseline and progress data will be reported at the requisite \n70. \ntime intervals by the local PMOs to HPMO, including semiannual reporting on the environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP).  HPMO  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  and  consolidating  the  data \nthrough  its  management  information  system.  The  PPMS  will  be  designed  to  permit  adequate \nto  adopt  remedial  action  regarding  project  design,  schedules,  activities,  and \nflexibility \ndevelopment  impacts.  HPMO,  with  assistance  from  the  consultants,  will  monitor  and  assess \nactivities, and report to ADB quarterly on the physical implementation and financial aspects of the \nProject to ensure that impacts are monitored and reported in line with ADB requirements. \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Review \n\n71. \nReview  missions  will  be  undertaken  twice  a  yea,  for  the  first  2  years  and  once  a  year \nthereafter;  ADB  and  the  Government  will  undertake  a  midterm  review  2  years  after  project \nimplementation  begins.  This  review  will \nthe  scope, \nimplementation  arrangements,  resettlement,  achievement  of  scheduled  targets,  and  progress \nwith  the  policy  reform  agenda  and  capacity-building  measures.  Feedback  from  the  PPMS \nactivities will be analyzed. \n \n\ninclude  a  detailed  evaluation  of \n\n\fIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Benefits \n\n72. \nThe  Project  provides  the  most  sustainable  prospect  for  reducing  waterborne  pollution, \nimproving  the  quality  of  surface  water  and  groundwater,  reducing  transboundary  pollution \ndisputes, and protecting drinking water sources. The wastewater collection systems will improve \nthe urban environment by reducing exposure of the community to untreated wastewater with its \nassociated  impacts  on  public  health  and  nuisance.  The  provision  of  centralized  wastewater \ntreatment  facilities  allows  cost-effective  treatment  of  industrial  wastewater  through  pretreatment \nat  individual  enterprises  prior  to  discharge  to  a  wastewater  collection  system  for  subsequent \ntreatment at a municipal WWTP. This provides greater assurance of protecting receiving waters \nthrough  the  efficient  operation  of  centralized  wastewater  treatment  facilities  that  can  be  more \neasily monitored than treatment facilities at individual enterprises. Treated effluent can potentially \nbe  reused  beneficially  either  for  industry  or  for  irrigation:  this  forms  a  component  of  some \nsubprojects. \n \nThe  proposed  use  of  new  sources  of  water  of  improved  quality  and  reliable  yield  for \n73. \nmunicipal  water  supply  from  either  deep  groundwater  or  from  protected  upland  reservoirs  will \nensure improvements in the availability of water of an acceptable quality to the urban population \nserved  by  each  water  supply  subproject.  The  proposed  extension,  replacement,  and \nrefurbishment of water distribution systems will increase the size of the population provided with \naccess to piped water supplies. These improvements in the distribution system will reduce water \nlosses and the risk of contamination of treated water within the distribution system.  \n \n74. \nThe SEIA for the 8 representative subprojects and the SEIA for the remaining subprojects, \nincluding  the  EMP,  cover  all  phases  from  project  design  to  construction  and  operation.  They \nconclude  that  the  adverse  impacts  generated  by  the  Project  could  be  successfully  mitigated  to \nacceptable  levels  through  the  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures  specified  in  the  EMP.  The \nEMP  proposes  institutional  strengthening  and  training  to  address  the  weak  capacity  of  county \ngovernments  and  IAs.  Supplementary  Appendix  J  summarizes  the  environmental  impacts, \nmitigation measures, and monitoring plans. \n  \nB. \n \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Benefits \n\n75. \nThe  poverty  and  social  assessment  for  the  8  representative  subprojects  and  the  11 \ncandidate subprojects indicates that the Project will benefit a total urban population of about 1.5 \nmillion people through the provision of clean water and improvement of wastewater services. Of \nthe total beneficiary population, about 170,000 or 11% are categorized as living below the poverty \nline of CNY1,348 per capita per year. The Project will support poverty reduction by (i) reducing \nthe  incidence  of  waterborne  disease,  cost  of  medical  care,  and  sick  days  taken,  thus  reducing \nhousehold  health  expenditures;  (ii)  providing  safer  and  more  reliable  urban  water  supplies;  (iii) \nimproving  the  quality  of  life  of  the  urban  poor  by  eliminating  uncollected  sewage  in  poor \nneighborhoods  and  improving  water  quality  in  urban  drainage  channels;  and  (iv)  providing \nemployment opportunities for the poor. \n \nThe Project will improve public health by reducing waterborne disease through improved \n76. \nwater supply and wastewater management services. Annual economic losses due to waterborne \ndisease, which currently stand at CNY30 million are expected to be reduced by 40%. The Project \nwill also create job opportunities for both skilled and unskilled labor during implementation. The \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\nProject  will  utilize  about  6,000  person-years  of  labor  during  construction;  about  30%  of  the  job \nopportunities  can  be  filled  by  the  poor  and  women.  The  Project  will  stimulate  local  economic \ndevelopment, particularly in construction and tourism, and consequently will continue to provide a \nsource of employment for local communities. \n \nIn the project area, three major social measures are designed to protect urban residents \n77. \nfrom  falling  into  poverty.  These  include  (i)  a  living  allowance  for  laid-off  employees,  (ii) \nunemployment insurance, and (iii) a social support program under the minimum living guarantee \nscheme.  All  project  cities  have,  through  various  social  support  programs,  implemented  a  water \ntariff waiver or reduction for households with incomes below the poverty line. \n \n78. \nThe Project will promote public awareness and education programs about project benefits, \nsocial  acceptance  of  user  fees  and  tariffs  for  wastewater,  public  hygiene,  and  behavior  of \nconsumers  on  water  saving  and  managing  wastewater  disposal.  The  Project  will  also  provide \ngender-awareness training to project management staff to promote women\u2019s participation in key \nareas  such  as  employment  opportunities,  and  set  up  gender-specific  indicators  to  monitor  and \nevaluate project impacts on men and women. Appendix 13 provides a summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy for the Project.   \n \n\n2. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n79.   Resettlement  impacts  were  identified  for  the  8  representative  subprojects  and  11 \ncandidate subprojects. ADB reviewed and approved RPs for the 8 representative subprojects and \nthe  resettlement  framework  for  subsequent  subprojects;  these  were  uploaded  on  the  ADB \nwebsite  on  9  July  and  6  June  2005,  respectively.  Resettlement  under  the  Project  includes \npermanent and temporary land acquisition, and building demolition; but the resettlement impacts \nare relatively small. Considering the good experiences with other urban projects and the strong \ncommitment of local authorities to the safeguard policies, significant problems are unlikely to be \nencountered.  The  IAs  will  fund  the  resettlement  costs  according  to  the  standards  set  out  in  the \nRPs.  Entitlements  will  be  provided  to  those  affected  before  demolition  and  ground-leveling \ncommence,  and  before  any  loss  of  land.  A  resettlement  information  booklet  was  distributed  to \nthose affected through village offices, and the full RPs for the 8 representative subprojects were \nmade available at the village offices. Appendix 14 provides a summary RP.  \n \n80.  \nFor  subsequent  candidate  subprojects,  the  RP  will  be  finalized  based  on  the  detailed \nengineering  designs.  HPMO,  assisted  by  the  IAs,  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  RP \nimplementation  and  submitting  reports  to  ADB.  A  regular  reporting  system  was  established  to \nensure  that  key  resettlement  activities  are  implemented  on  schedule.  HPMO  has  engaged  a \ndomestic  institute  to  carry  out  independent  monitoring  of  resettlement  implementation.  Surveys \nwill  be  conducted  for  annual  evaluations  for  2  years  upon  completion  of  resettlement,  and  the \nfindings reported to HPMO and ADB.    \n \nC. \n\nInstitutional Benefits \n\nThe capacity-building component under the Project and continued policy dialogue with the \n81. \nmunicipal  governments  will  support  institutional  and  financial  reforms  that  will  provide  a  more \nviable, commercially oriented basis for managing and operating water and wastewater systems, \nparticularly  by  counties.  The  maturity  of  county  institutional  arrangements  vary  considerably \nbetween  cities.  Of  the  15  project  cites,  8  have  established  water  utility  companies  and  the \nremaining 7 will establish water utility companies no later than when their onlending agreements \nare signed. Of the 8 cities, 5 have established or will establish water group companies that have \nresponsibility  for  both  water  supply  and  wastewater.  HPG  considers  this  water  group  company \n\n\fDuring \n\nthe  Fact-Finding  Mission,  broad \n\narrangement  to  be  the  preferred  institutional  arrangement  for  subproject  implementation.  The \nintegrated approach supported by the Project may also serve as a model in similar cities in the \nPRC.  \n \n82. \nfinancial  management  assessment  was \nconducted, covering the areas of implementation arrangements, sustainability, and fiduciary risks \nand mitigation strategy. A detailed financial management assessment will be conducted at project \ninception.  Based  on  the  detailed  financial  management  assessment,  each  wastewater  or  water \nutility  will  be  assisted  to  establish  a  sound  and  solid  financial  management  system  at  the \nbeginning of project implementation. The financial management system will be in line with ADB's \nGuidelines for Governance and Financial Management of an ADB Investment Project (November \n2003).  Each  utility  will  keep  accounts  in  accordance  with  commercial  accounting  principles  and \nbe  subject  to  independent  external  audit  by  a  suitably  qualified  firm  of  commercial  auditors. \nAccounting  will  be  in  accordance  with  relevant  PRC  accounting  standards,  which  are  largely  in \naccordance with international norms.  \n \nD. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n83. \nThe economic analysis covers both the Project as a whole, and the individual subprojects. \nAppendix  15  provides  details.  For  the  Project  as  a  whole,  the  analysis  covers  the  economic \nrationale  for  public  intervention,  and  goals  and  general  design  of  the  investment  plan.  The \neconomic  rationale  is  sound,  based  on  control  of  externalities  (water  pollution)  and  managing \nnatural  monopolies  (water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment).  The  goals  of  the  investment  plan \nare to meet targets for surface water quality. The water quality targets are clearly defined, legally \nestablished, and consistent with international practice. The plan to meet the water quality targets \nis  based  on  centralized  WWTPs.  Centralized  WWTPs  are  a  valid  part  of  a  least-cost  plan  to \nachieve  water  quality  targets  under  three  basic  conditions:  (i)  sewer  connections  are \ncomprehensive,  (ii)  wastewater  tariffs  provide  appropriate  economic  incentives  for  water \nconservation  and  wastewater  management,  and  (iii)  WWTPs  are  designed  as  least  cost.  The \nProject  addresses  the  first  two  conditions  through  its  assurances  as  well  as  through  policy \ndialogue. The third condition is part of the appraisal criteria for individual subprojects. \n \nE. \n\nFinancial Evaluation \n\n84. \nThe financial evaluation of the 8 representative subprojects was undertaken in real terms \nusing constant 2005 prices (Appendix 16). The project cost estimates and financial projections in \nnominal  terms  after  tax  were  converted  to  real  terms  by  adjusting  for  foreign  and  domestic \ninflation and currency fluctuation. The financial internal rate of return for each subproject is more \nthan  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  also  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis.  These \nsubprojects are considered both financially viable and sustainable. The average financial internal \nrate of return for the 8 subprojects is 6.3%, which compares favorably with the weighted average \ncost  of  capital  of  2.4%.  Sensitivity  and  risk  analysis  indicates  that  the  financial  internal  rate  of \nreturn is robust under adverse conditions.  \n \nFinancial projections were prepared for each of the subproject entities in accordance with \n85. \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects \nFinanced  by  the  ADB  to  assess  the  financial  viability  and  sustainability  of  each  subproject \n(Supplementary Appendix K). The projected financial statements indicate that financial revenues \nwill be sufficient to cover O&M costs, income taxes, and debt service; and provide a reasonable \nrate  of  return.  Based  on  the  financial  projections,  each  project  company  will  be  in  a  position  to \nmaintain a minimum debt-service coverage ratio of 1.2:1, a maximum debt-equity ratio of 70:30, \nand a minimum current ratio of 2.1:1. \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\n\f 18 \n\n \nF. \n\nRisks \n\n86. \nDuring project preparation, a comprehensive analysis of project risk was undertaken and \nsensitivity  analysis  was  performed  accordingly  on  both  the  benefit  and  cost  streams.  This \nanalysis  gives  satisfactory  results.  The  Project  has  potential  institutional,  financial,  and  policy \nrisks related to (i) implementation of institutional reforms in project cities; (ii) generation of public \nsupport for  higher water tariffs to meet cost recovery targets; (iii) project cities\u2019 ability to meet the \ncash/equity  transfer  required  to  construct  the  Project;  (iv)  weak  operational  and  managerial \ncapacity  of  water  utility  companies;  and  (v)  capacity  of  municipal  environmental  protection \nbureaus  to  prepare  and  enforce  industrial  pollution  control  plans,  affecting  the  ability  of \nwastewater companies to meet treatment standards. Other risks include unforeseen construction \ndifficulties and inadequate project management.  \n \n87. \nThe  Project  includes  the  following  measures  to  mitigate  these  risks:  (i)  project  cities\u2019 \nassurances  on  water  utility  companies\u2019  financial  and  managerial  autonomy  and  institutional \nstrengthening,  (ii)  regular  tariff  reviews  and  adjustments  by  the  Government  following  national \nguidelines  as  well  as  public  awareness  programs,  (iii)  provision  of  counterpart  funding,  and  (iv) \nvarious  training  and  staff  exchange/secondment  programs.  Moreover,  HPG  has  previous \nexperience  in  preparing  citywide  pollution  control  plans.  ADB  review  missions  will  monitor \ncompliance  with  the  financial  and  operational  covenants  to  ensure  financial  sustainability  of  the \nwater utility companies. The Project does not have any unusual technical risks; this minimizes the \nrisk  of  unforeseen  construction  conditions.  Experienced  domestic  and  international  consultants \nwill  give  implementation  advice  and  support  to  mitigate  specific  construction  and  other \nimplementation  risks.  The  project  leading  group  in  HPG,  headed  by  a  provincial  vice  governor, \nand  HPMO,  which  has  experience  in  oversight  of  a  large  internationally  funded  project,  will \nmitigate project management risk.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  HPG  have  given  the \n\n88. \nfollowing assurances, which are to be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nHPG  will  ensure  that  each  wastewater  company  develops  and  implements  a \nconnection  program  that  will  include  the  following  provisions  (a)  any  new \ndevelopment provides connections to the trunk sewer connections, (b) household \nconnection  provisions  are  available,  (c)  all  major  industries  are  connected  to  the \nsewer system, and (d) poor households are connected to the sewer system. \n\nHPG  and  the  local  governments  will  undertake  a  review  and  revision  of  local \nregulations for management of the local wastewater/drainage systems by the end \nof  December  2006.

Promotion of Integrated Water Resource \n\nManagement \n\n\u2022  An integrated and coordinated basin \n\napproach to water resource planning and \nenvironmental management has been shown \nto give optimum results. \n\n\u2022  Treated wastewater is a potentially valuable \nwater resource to be considered in water \nresource planning. \n\n\u2022  Demand management can play an important \nrole in water conservation and alleviating \nwater stress.   \n\n \n \n(i)  Prepare integrated water resource plans to \n\nachieve comprehensive watershed \nmanagement.  \n\n(ii)  Improve coordination of water resource \nplanning with water quality planning. \n(iii)  Promote the beneficial reuse of treated \nwastewater wherever this is economic.  \n(iv)  Undertake demand management initiatives \n(leakage control, and promoting water \nsaving). \n\n2.  Municipal Wastewater Management \n\nEffective policies, guidance, and procedures \nare required to ensure \n\u2022  comprehensive collection of wastewater, \n\u2022 sewerage separation policies that fit local \n\ncircumstances and can be effectively \nimplemented and policed, \n\n\u2022 maintenance of effluent strength, and  \n\u2022 protection of wastewater facilities from \n\npollution discharges.  \n\n3.  Industrial Pollution Control \n\n\u2022  People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) laws and \n\nregulations define permitted discharge \nstandards for different industrial effluents, but \nthese are frequently not adhered to in \npractice. \n\n\u2022 Centralized treatment of pretreated industrial \n\neffluents is normally the most economic \nmeans of treatment, but is only viable where \neffective monitoring and enforcement \narrangements are implemented.  \n\n4.  Cost Recovery and Tariff Reform \n\n\u2022 Tariff levels based on the principles of full cost \n\nrecovery will allow water and wastewater \ncompanies to be financially autonomous. \n\u2022 Government subsidies must be eliminated or \nsignificantly reduced. Tariffs structures and \nlevels should promote the economic use of \nresources.  \n\n\u2022  Adequate funds for loan repayment, \noperation, maintenance, and ultimate \nreplacement of project facilities must be \nassured.   \n\n \n\n \n\n(i)  Build capacity of local implementing \n\nagencies in the management and operation \nof sewerage networks. \n\n(ii)  Issue guidance on standardized application \n\nof a discharge permit system, with a \ndeadline for practical implementation. \n\n(iii)  Review and consider strengthening \n\npenalties for noncompliance with discharge \nstandards. \n\n \n(i)  Promote centralized wastewater treatment \nwith pretreatment of industrial effluents.  \n(ii)  Implement wastewater discharge permitting \n\nsystems for discharges to the urban \nsewerage system.  \n\n(iii)  Implement comprehensive monitoring and \nenforcement for compliance with industrial \ndischarge standards.  \n\n(iv) Clarify respective responsibilities of \n\nimplementing agencies and the local \nenvironmental protection bureaus once \nwastewater treatment plants are \ncommissioned.  \n\n \n(i)  Implement Circular (1999) 1192, which \nencapsulates full cost recovery as an \nobjective in tariff setting. \n\n(ii)  Develop more specific guidance to support \n\npolicy implementation.  \n\n(iii)  Refine social policies to protect financially \n\ndisadvantaged customers. \n\n(iv)  Improve arrangements for enforceability of \n\nwastewater charges. \n\n\fAppendix  2 \n\n25 \n\n5. Enterprise Reform, Governance. and \n  Diversification of Investment \n\n\u2022  Sustainability of wastewater facilities requires \n\n \n \n(i) \n\nestablishing implementing agencies as \nfinancially and managerially autonomous \nenterprises.    \n\n\u2022  High standards of corporate governance are \n\nrequired to ensure public confidence.   \n\n\u2022 Large investments needed in the PRC water \n\nsector cannot be financed by the public sector \nalone.

In issuing this invitation, HPG refers to basic selection criteria.  \n \n\nThe subproject must be either involve wastewater management or water supply \nand be included in relevant sector or development plans (Henan Hai River Plan). \n\nThe  local  government  must  confirm  its  ability  and  willingness  to  arrange \ncounterpart finance. \n\nThe  local  government  must  confirm  a  willingness  to  subject  the  subproject  to \nADB safeguard policies and other requirements. \n\n(iv) \n\nThe preferred implementation period is during 2005\u20132010.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nFor  subprojects  meeting  these  selection  criteria,  HPG  then  asked  the  relevant  local \n\n \n5. \ngovernment to undertake detailed preparations.  \n \nC. \n\nStage 2: Subproject Preparations \n\nLocal governments are supported by local design and other specialist institutes (locally \n\n6. \nPreparations  by  local  governments  involves  designating  an  implementing  agency  (or \ninitially  an  office  of  the  government)  to  prepare  a  detailed  project  proposal,  feasibility  study, \nenvironmental impact assessment, and (if required) a resettlement plan to standards necessary \nto  meet  both  domestic  and  ADB  requirements.  Governments  must  also  determine  suitable \ninstitutional arrangements for project implementation and prepare a detailed financing plan.  \n \n7. \nappointed) for their work and compliance with ADB requirements.   \n \n8. \nTo  facilitate  an  orderly  and  consistent  appraisal  of  the  subprojects,  HPMO  requires  an \nintegrated  feasibility  study  in  a  common  format  to  be  prepared  (to  ADB  standards)  for  each \nproposed subproject, including technical, social, financial, economic, and institutional analysis.    \n \n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nD. \n\nStage 3: Subproject Appraisal and Approval \n\n9. \nThe  ADB  project  team  developed  a  detailed  set  of  evaluation  criteria,  which  was \ndiscussed  and  agreed  with  HPG.  This  was  to  ensure  that  individual  subproject  appraisal  is \nconducted in accordance with ADB standards.  \n \n10. \nHPG  is  responsible  for  subproject  appraisal  and  has  commissioned  the  Henan \nEngineering  Consulting  Company,  a  subsidiary  organization  of  HDRC,  to  undertake  detailed \nappraisals  on  its  behalf.  The  company  is  qualified  under  domestic  accreditations  to  conduct \nproject  reviews  of  provincial  urban  infrastructure  projects.  The  project  team  reviewed  the \ncompany\u2019s qualifications and experience and considers it suitable for this task.  \n \n11. \nand prepare a subproject appraisal report (SAR) for consideration by HDRC and HPMO.  \n \n12. \nRejected subprojects are to be referred to the relevant local government with indications \nof  where  the  preparations  and  proposals  are  deficient;  and  for  additional  preparation  work \n(assuming the subproject has a realistic chance of meeting the agreed evaluation criteria).     \n \n13. \ninformation purposes as appropriate:  \n \n\nHenan  Engineering  Consulting  Company  will  review  the  subproject  feasibility  studies \n\nSubprojects that are approved by HPMO will be forwarded to ABD for approval or for \n\nABD will approve the first feasibility study and its SAR. \n\nADB will approve all SARs for subprojects with a total cost estimate in excess of \n$10 million equivalent.  \n\n(iii) \n\nADB will receive other SARs for its record purposes only.  \n\nAll subproject approvals by ADB or HPG will only be made if  \n\nthe subproject is included in an summary environmental impact assessment that \nhas  been  endorsed  by  Henan  Environmental  Protection  Bureau  and  ADB,  and \nbeen subject to relevant public consultation and disclosure; and   \n\na resettlement plan meeting ADB requirements has been prepared and approved \nby  the  relevant  local  government,  and  endorsed  as  satisfactory  by  ADB.\n\n \n14. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n\f \n\nPROCESS FOR SUBPROJECT IDENTIFICATION, SELECTION, PREPARATION, AND APPRAISAL \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nStage 2  \nPreparation \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nStage 3 \nAppraisal \n\n \n \n \n\nLocal government \ncommissions the project \npreparation process and \nestablishes a project \nmanagement office \n\nHPMO commissions HECC to \nreview the integrated feasibility \nstudy report against the appraisal \ncriteria. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHPMO invites local \ngovernments to submit \nproposals based on agreed \nselection criteria \n\nStage 1  \nIdentification and Selection \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nLocal governments submit \nproject proposals \n\nPreparation of \ndomestic feasibility \nstudy \n\nPreparation of safeguard \ndocuments \n(environmental impact \nassessment and \nresettlement plan) \n\nHECC prepares summary appraisal \nreports with subproject \nrecommendation \n\nHPMO and HDRC review summary \nappraisal report and make appraisal \ndecision \n\nHPMO reviews project \nproposals and confirms \ncompliance with selection \ncriteria \n\nFinancial and \ninstitutional plans \n\nPublic participation \nand consultation \n\nIntegrated feasibility study report prepared in format \nissued by HPMO with financial and economic analysis \nin accordance with ADB procedures. \n\nSubproject rejected \n\nSubproject \napproved \n\nRequired documents sent to ADB for information \nor approval. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank;  HDRC  =  Henan  Development  and  Reform  Commission;  HECC  =  Henan  Engineering  Consulting  Company;  HPMO  = \nHenan project management office. \nSource: Henan provincial government. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ni\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2\n9\n\n\fReference \nNumber \n\nCapacity Building \nRequirement \n\nConsulting Services \n\nDomestic Training \n\nINSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING \n \n\nTypes of Capacity Building to be Applied \n\nFamiliarization \nVisits \n\nStaff Exchanges \nand Secondments \n \n\n \n\nRemarks \n\n3\n0\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n5\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWorkshop to be held to \nexplain PPMS  \n\nTraining workshop by loan \nconsultants  \nSelective extended training \nfor key staff. \n\nTraining workshop by loan \nconsultants \nSelective extended training \nfor key staff  \nTraining in MS Project or \nequivalent \n\nTraining in ADB \nrequirements and People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) \nbidding law  \n\nWorkshop(s) to be held by \nconsultants on ADB \nrequirements \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nVisits to ongoing \nADB projects \nunder \nimplementation \n(e.g., Hebei \nprovince) \n\nGive advice and guidance \non setting up monitoring \nprocedures, with follow up \nvisits to each \nimplementing agency (IA).  \n\nWorkshop(s) to be held by \nconsultants on Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) \nrequirements \n\nPhysical \nImplementation  \n\n \n\nSet up internal land \nacquisition and \nresettlement \nmonitoring and \nreporting \nprocedures \n\nDesign and \noperation of project \nperformance \nmonitoring system \n(PPMS) \n\nProject planning \n\nDesign the PPMS, and \nprovide guidance to \nensure consistency in its \nuse.

HPMO  will  act  in  a  coordinating  and \nsupervisory role, ensuring the consulting services are provided in a timely and effective manner. \n \n2. \nThe majority of the consulting services are expected to be provided by domestic experts \nas  the  type  of  capacity  building  is  generally  not  new  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC). \nDomestic  consultants  can  provide  more  cost-effective  support.  However,  the  overall  capacity-\nbuilding  program  required  is  large  and  diverse,  and  international  consultants  will  be  required  to \nprovide  direction  (capacity  building,  content,  etc.),  to  establish  the  monitoring  systems  to  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) standards, and for some special advisory inputs. \n \n3. \nAlmost  all  direct  consulting  support  to  the  individual  IAs  will  be  provided  by  domestic \nconsultants operating in the PRC to minimize difficulties in communication and interpretation. This \nwill  ensure  advice  provided  takes  account  of  the  specific  conditions  found  in  the  PRC,  such  as \nlocal laws, regulations, and standards.  \n\n \nScope of Work \n\nB. \n \n4. \nThe  consultant  will  work  with  HPMO,  the  general  manager,  other  senior  management  of \nthe IAs, and relevant local government officials to provide assistance and advice on the following: \n \n5. \nfollowing: \n(i) \n\nProject  Management  and  Implementation  Support.

Recommend  a  practical \nand effective design supervision system. \n\nincluding \n\nthese, \n\nDevelop  detailed  reporting \npreparation of the initial progress report.  \n\nformats \n\nfor  submission \n\nto  ADB, \n\nincluding \n\nthe \n\nHelp prepare detailed commissioning plans and provide support as required during \nthe wastewater treatment project (WWTP) commissioning process.  \n\nProvide training and on-the-job guidance on items (i) to (iv). \n\nEstablish  a  framework  for  the  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS), \nincluding its design, data collection, and analysis procedures, and provide training \nin its use. \n\n(vii)  Undertake  a  review  of  both  the  internal  and  independent  external  resettlement \nmonitoring  and  reporting  arrangements,  and  the  reports  produced.  Recommend \nactions necessary to ensure compliance with approved resettlement plans. Provide \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n41 \n\ntraining  in  resettlement  monitoring  in  accordance  with  ADB  requirements  and \nfollow up advice and support to local IAs.  \n\n(viii)  Develop  and  help  implement  public  awareness  and  education  programs  to  help \nincrease  public  awareness  of  project-related  issues  such  as  public  health \nimprovement,  benefits  of  wastewater  treatment,  personal  responsibilities  for \nenvironmental protection, and water conservation.  \n\nDevelop  and  help  implement  a  gender  awareness  program,  provide  training  on \nmainstreaming gender into project design and implementation, and develop gender \nsensitive indicators as part of the PPMS.   \n\nDevelop  and  implement  an  environmental  monitoring  program  and  reporting \nprocedures to ensure that appropriate mitigation measures are undertaken during \nconstruction and operation of the project facilities. Provide training in environmental \nmonitoring in accordance with ADB requirements and follow up advice and support \nto local IAs.  \n\nProvide  support  to  IAs  in  preparing,  refining,  and  processing  supplementary \nfeasibility studies, environmental impact assessments, and resettlement plans that \nmight become necessary if new subprojects are included within the sector loan. \n\n  \nInstitutional and Managerial Improvements. The consultant will undertake the following: \n\n \n\n6. \n \n\nReview  the  overall  management  organization  of  the  utility  companies  to  identify \nwhere changes in organizational structure (the management model) might lead to \nimprovements in the business performance of the organization. \n\nReview  human  resource  planning  procedures  and  assessment  of  staffing \nrequirements. Make recommendations for improving human resource planning and \nassist  in  preparing  a  revised  human  resource  plan  in  accordance  with  these \nrecommendations.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n \n\n    No \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China: \n \nIn 2003, the total population in Henan province was about 96.7 million (7.7% of the national total), of whom \n27% are classified as urban and 73% as rural. Since 1990, the urban growth rate has risen from about 3% \nper year to more than 6%, while the rural rate has been consistently negative since the mid-1990s. These \nfigures indicate a strong trend in rural\u2013urban migration. It also implies increasing pressure on urban public \nservices  and  increasing  environmental  pollution.  Provision  of  clean  drinking  water  and  wastewater \nmanagement  will  improve  living  conditions  and  quality  of  life,  and  reduce  waterborne  disease  of  local \nresidents.  Due  to  higher  vulnerability  to  unfavorable  environmental  conditions,  the  poor  will  particularly \nbenefit from the clean water supply and cleaner waterways, and improved ambient environment and public \nhealth. The Project will support the Government in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nfor environmental sustainability (MDG Goal 7) to halve the population without sustainable access to safe \ndrinking  water  and  basic  sanitation  by  2015  (MDG  targets  10  and  11).  Although  the  Project  does  not \ninclude direct poverty intervention, it supports poverty reduction directly and indirectly through job creation \nand promotion of sustainable economic development in areas where the poor are particularly likely to gain, \nsuch as the construction and tourism industries.  \n \nThe Project will benefit a total urban population of about 1.5 million in 15 city/counties in Henan province \nthrough  the  provision  of  clean  water  and  improvement  of  wastewater  services.  Of  the  total  beneficiary \npopulation, about 170,000 or 11% of the total beneficiaries are poor as measured by weighted-average of \n15 urban counties poverty lines of CNY1, 348 per capita per year. One of the important project benefits will \nbe  improvement  in  public  health,  especially  related  to  the  reduction  of  waterborne  disease  such  as \ntyphoid,  cholera,  hepatitis,  skin  disease,  and  diarrhea,  particularly  to  the  poor,  women,  children,  and \nelderly.  Annual  economic  losses  due  to  reported  waterborne  disease  among  the  direct  beneficiary \npopulation are estimated currently at CNY30 million per annum; these can likely be reduced by 40% with \nthe  Project.  To  realize  the  full  health  benefits,  parallel  improvements  are  required  in  public  health \neducation, higher standards of personal hygiene, and improved housing and living conditions especially for \nthe poor  who  are  likely  to  suffer most from  water-borne  disease. Women,  with  more chances  of contact \nwith water from household chores, will also benefit disproportionately from the improvement in sanitation, \nwater  quality,  and  urban  environment.  Awareness  and  education  programs  will  be  provided  to  promote \npublic hygiene, and health indicators related to waterborne disease will be monitored annually as part of \nthe project performance monitoring system. \n \nThe  Project  will  create  employment  opportunities  in  construction  and  management  of  water  and \nwastewater services for both skilled and unskilled workers. Construction of project facilities will require a \ntotal  of  6,000  person-years  of  labor.  Of  these,  1,200  person-years  will  be  managerial  and  technical \npersonnel,  3,300  person-years  skilled,  and  1,600  person-years  unskilled  workers.  About  1,800  person-\nyears of the construction-related employment are expected to be available for the poor and women. When \nthe Project is fully operational, the staffing requirement is estimated at 2,000, including 1,200 technical and \nmanagerial, and 800 skilled and unskilled workers. About 400 jobs or 20% of the operational jobs will be \navailable for women and the poor. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n47 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProposed Classification: General intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nPoverty  and  social  analysis  were  treated  as  an  integral  part  of  project  preparation  and  are  based  on \nquantitative  and  qualitative methodologies.  Project selection  and design  included the  analysis  of poverty \ndata based on data at the country, province, and project area; and involved field assessment, household \nincome,  and  expenditure  survey  of  1,400  respondents  in  15  counties  of  the  project  area;  stakeholder \nconsultations through focus group discussion; key informant interviews; and workshops to understand the \nissues of multidimensionality of poverty, willingness to pay, affordability, stakeholder participation, gender \nand  development,  and  any  social  safeguard  issues.  Poverty  and  social  development  criteria  were \ndeveloped for the selection of additional subprojects. \n \nIn  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  no  standard  national  poverty  lines  have  been  developed  for \nurban areas. The official poverty line for urban residents in each city/county varies. The data from Henan \nCivil Affairs Bureau showed 1.325 million out of 19.5 million or 6.8% if the urban population living under \nthe minimum living guarantee (MLG).a In the project area, about 170,000 people or 70,000 households are \nclassified as urban poor and are entitled to receive the MLG from the respective city/county Civil Affairs \nBureau.  They  accounted  for  about  11%  of  the  total  urban  population  in  2004,  which  is  higher  than  the \npoverty  rate  of  Henan  province  at  6.8%.  Data  from  Henan  Civil  Affairs  Bureau  indicates  that  more  poor \npeople live in these counties than in larger municipal cities. This trend is similar to other parts of the PRC, \nwhich is mostly attributed to less employment opportunities in the nonagriculture sector, recent migration \nof  unskilled  and  poor  workers  from  rural  to  county  areas,  and  geographic  expansion  of  county \nadministration to include some of the rural areas.  \n \nThe  Project  will  help  improve  the  urban  environment  and  public  health  through  improved  wastewater \nmanagement  and  water  supply.  However,  increases  in  the  fees  for  water  and  wastewater  services  may \nhave a negative impact on the poor. This impact is considered to be minimal, given that the total amount \npaid by each household for water supply and wastewater treatment services is a small percent (3.2% of \ntheir total  income).  To  protect the  poor,  the  local municipal/county  Civil  Affairs Bureau  operates  a  social \nsupport  program  for  the  lowest  income  bracket  households  under  the  MLG  scheme,  which  provides \nassistance in paying utility charges including water and wastewater. \n \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n Yes \n\n   No \n\n  No  \n\n  Yes             \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nStakeholder analysis  was conducted during project preparation to identify their needs, interest, capacity, \nand  level  of  influence  in  the  project  design,  implementation,  and  monitoring. Based  on this  analysis,  the \nprimary  and  secondary  stakeholders  were  identified.  The  primary  stakeholders  include  ADB;  the  PRC \nGovernment;  Henan  provincial,  municipal,  and  county  governments;  implementing  agencies,  and \ncommunities  in  the  project  beneficiary  areas.  The  secondary  stakeholders  are  the  major  beneficiary \ngroups  in  a  broad  sense,  including  finance  bureaus,  development  reform  commissions,  labor  and  social \nsecurity  bureaus,  civil  affairs  bureaus,  poverty  reduction  offices,  health  bureaus,  women\u2019s  federations, \nenvironmental sanitation bureaus, environmental protection bureaus, water resources bureaus, agriculture \ncommissions, real estate bureaus, tourism bureaus, and investment offices. \n \nStakeholder  participation  is  the  core  element  of  project  design  and  planning,  particularly  in  the  area  of \npoverty,  social,  environmental,  and  involuntary  resettlement.  Based  on  the  public  consultations,  focus \ngroup discussion, and rapid participatory appraisal, a participation strategy was developed to (i) promote \nactive  participation  of  the  beneficiary  and  affected  population  in  project  planning,  implementation,  and \nmonitoring and evaluation; (ii) promote active participation of the primary and secondary stakeholders in \nthe  implementation  of  awareness  and  education  program  on  public  health  and  improvement  of  personal \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nhygiene;  (iii)  enhance  the  project  benefits  to  the  beneficiary  populations,  obtain  their  support  for  the \nProject, and raise their social acceptance of the user fees; and (iv) promote gender awareness of water \nand wastewater to management staff and other key stakeholders. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe  full  participation  of  women  in the water  and  wastewater  sectors  implies that,  to  a very  great  extent, \nproject  benefits  will  accrue  to  women  as  well  as  to  men.  This  is  true  of  economic  and  noneconomic \nbenefits arising from improved environment, in particular most household work is water related,  which is \nmainly  performed  by  women.  Benefits  resulting  from  access  to  clean  and  stable  water  supply  and \nimproved water quality, employment opportunities from the project activities, increased health status, and \ntime saving from performing water-related household activities will all benefit women to a certain degree. \nTo improve gender awareness in the water and wastewater sectors, the Henan provincial government, the \nExecuting  Agency,  with  the  assistance  of  a  gender  specialist  will  (i)  encourage  women  to  participate  in \nproject  implementation  activities,  in  particular  on  awareness  of  public  health  and  hygiene;  (ii)  conduct \ngender  awareness  training  for  management  staff  and  other  key  stakeholders  to  promote  women\u2019s \nparticipation in the Project, and (iii) monitor project impact on health and hygiene. The public awareness \nwill target women\u2019s engagement as promoters in the public awareness and educational program on public \nhealth, hygiene improvement, and project benefits.  \n \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n \n \nE.

This \ntariff  increase  will  be  implemented  progressively  by  6% \nevery 2 years. This will increase the average cost of water \nservices from around 2% of average household income to \nbetween  3%  and  3.5%,  based  on  current  earning  levels. \nFor  poor  households,  the  local  municipal/county  civil \naffairs  bureau  operates  a  social  support  program  for  the \nlowest \nthe  MLG \nscheme,  which  provides  assistance  in  paying  utility \ncharges including water and wastewater. \nThe  Project  will  not  have  any  negative  impact  on  the \nexisting  water  and  wastewater  companies.

Eight  core  subprojects  were  selected  under  a  sector  approach;  the \nremaining  subprojects  will  be  processed  during  loan  implementation.  All  of  the  subprojects \ninvolve some land acquisition and population resettlement, but the impacts are relatively small. \nThe land acquisition and resettlement program is designed to ensure that those affected will be \nbetter-off as a result of the Project. \n \n2. \nThe  Project\u2019s  resettlement  impacts  are  summarized  in  Table  A14.  Based  on  the  19 \nsubproject surveys, the Project will permanently acquire 155 hectares (ha) of land, including 115 \nha  of  farmland  affecting  846  rural  households  (2,987  people).  The  Project  will  temporarily \noccupy 173 ha of state and collective land, affecting 1,183 urban and rural households (4,663 \npeople). Only 8 residential houses with 33 people need to be relocated.  \n \nFor  the  eight  representative  subprojects,  the  Project  will  permanently  acquire  35  ha  of \n3. \nland,  of  which  91%  is  farmland.  The  Project  will  also  require  90  ha  of  temporary  land \noccupation,  of  which  37%  is  farmland.  When  construction  is  completed,  the  land  temporarily \noccupied  will  be  restored  and  returned  to  the  owner.  In  addition,  180  square  meters  (m2)  of \nmud-wood houses and simple structures will be demolished. One enterprise and one cultivation \nfarm,  which  are  not  in  operation,  will  be  affected  by  demolition;  the  affected  structure  area  is \n1,960  m2.  One  enterprise  and  one  cultivation  farm,  which  are  not  in  operation,  will  be \ndemolished;  the  affected  structure  area  is  1,960  m2.  Some  auxiliaries,  such  as  trees,  tombs, \nfences, and vegetable sheds will also be affected. A total of 464 households (1,388 people) will \nbe affected by permanent land acquisition, 1,061 households (4,104 people) by temporary land \nacquisition,  and  2  households  (8  people)  by  house  demolition.  All  of  those  affected  are  rural \nresidents. \n \n\nTable A14: Summary of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n\nPermanent Land Acquisition \n\nTemporary Land  \nOccupation \n\nBuilding \nDemolition \n\n \n \n \n \nComponents \n\nPeople Affected  \n(number) \n\nTotal Area \nAffected \n (ha) \n\nOf which \nFarmland \n(ha) \n\nLand \nArea \n(ha) \n\nPeople \nAffected  \n(number) \n\n \n\nA.

To  avoid  or  minimize  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement,  local  officials  and  village  committees/street  committees  were \nclosely consulted during the preliminary and final feasibility study stages. \n \n5. \nCompensation for permanent land loss is based on the Land Administration Law of the \nPRC  (1998)  and  associated  provincial  and  municipal  laws  and  regulations.  Seven  separate \nresettlement  plans  (RPs)  were  prepared  for  the  eight  core  subprojects,  which  conform  to  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement.1  Of  the  seven  RPs,  one \ncovers both water supply and wastewater subprojects for Boai. For the remaining subprojects, a \nresettlement  framework  was  prepared  and  approved  by  ADB  (Supplementary  Appendix  H). \nOnce a subproject is selected for inclusion in the Project, the RP will be submitted to ADB for \napproval prior to commencement of land acquisition. Draft RPs have already been prepared for \nother  candidate  subprojects  and  will  be  upgraded  using  the  representative  subproject  RPs  as \nmodels. \n \nBased on consultations with local governments and those affected, and general practice \n6. \nin  the  project  city/counties,  the  city  project  management  offices  (PMOs)  and  implementing \nagencies  (IAs)  adopted  a  set  of  compensation  standards.  The  resettlement  principles \nestablished  for  the  Project  are  (i)  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  should  be \navoided  or  minimized  where  feasible  by  developing  and  comparing  a  series  of  design \nalternatives;  (ii)  compensation  and  entitlements  provided  must  be  adequate  to  allow  those \naffected  to  at  least  maintain  their  preproject  standard  of  living,  with  the  prospect  of \nimprovement;  (iii)  land  temporarily  occupied  and  the  period  for  disruption  are  to  be  kept  to  a \nminimum;  (iv)  all  the  people  affected,  legal  and  illegal,  are  to  be  taken  into  consideration  and \naccounted for; (v) the per capita landholding after land acquisition will be sufficient to maintain \nthe previous livelihood standard; (vi) where land allocation per capita is not sufficient to maintain \nthe  previous  livelihood  standards,  other  income-generating  activities  will  be  provided;  (vii)  a \npreferential policy will be provided to vulnerable groups, including housing assignment, training, \nand  employment;  (viii)  all  those  affected  will  be  adequately  informed  about  eligibility, \ncompensation rates and standards, livelihood and income-restoration plans, and project timing; \nand  (ix)  close  monitoring  and  timely  actions  will  be  carried  out  to  identify  and  resolve  any \nproblems. \n \n7. \nFor the eight representative subprojects, those affected have been notified about the key \nelements of the RP. On various occasions during meetings, interviews, focus group discussions, \npublic  consultation  workshops,  and  community  consultation  meetings,  local  representatives \nhave  participated  in  the  planning;  concerns  were  integrated  into  the  RP.  The  resettlement \ninformation booklets were distributed to affected villages and households in February 2005. The \nRPs  were  provided  to  village  offices  and  resident  committees  and  will  be  posted  on  the  ADB \nwebsite.  The  respective  project  IAs  will  establish  project  resettlement  units  for  supervising \nimplementation,  continuing  public  consultation,  monitoring  progress,  and  responding  to \ngrievances.  The  grievance  address  procedures  are  well  established  and  explanations  are \nincluded in the resettlement information booklets. \n \n8. \nFor land acquisition, the compensation of land and resettlement subsidy will be paid to \nthe  affected  village.  If  land  is  adjusted,  the  village  will  retain  the  resettlement  subsidy. \nOtherwise,  the  subsidy  will  be  paid  to  the  affected  household.  For  the  structure  of  residential \nhouses, the closed enterprise and farm to be demolished, compensation will be paid to owners. \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1998.

Households \nthat have to relocate will also receive a transfer and transportation allowance. Compensation for \nstanding crops, auxiliaries, and other assets will be paid directly to affected farmers. \n \nThe  measures  for  economic  rehabilitation  include  (i)  provision  of  employment \n9. \nopportunities during the project construction and operational phases; (ii) arrangement for those \naffected  to  be  employed  in  local  enterprises  and  businesses;  (iii)  land  redistribution  where \npossible; (iv) intensify and diversify farm operations to raise the value of production and income \nper unit of land; and (v) training on scientific and diversified agricultural business to assist those \naffected  increase  their  income.  New  livelihoods  may  include  courtyard  economic  activities, \nanimal  husbandry  and  economic  crop  planting,  greenhouses,  and  tertiary  business  (e.g., \ntransportation and catering services). The compensation paid to village committees will be used \nto improve village production and infrastructure. \n \n10. \nDuring investigations, 46 vulnerable affected people were identified for the eight core \nsubprojects,  including  poor,  disabled,  and  elder  households  and  those  headed  by  women. \nSpecial  measures  will  be  taken  to  ensure  these  vulnerable  people  receive  adequate \ncompensation and assistance to restore their living conditions and incomes. \n \n11. \nThe  staff  from  each  subproject  resettlement  unit  will  take  the  lead  responsibility  for \ncoordinating  the  planning,  implementation,  financing,  and  monitoring  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement. Each PMO will have at least two full-time staff responsible for land acquisition and \nresettlement.  They  will  work  closely  with  relevant  village/street  officials,  land  administration \nbureaus,  and  house  demolishment  offices,  and  will  be  responsible  for  supervising  and \nmonitoring  resettlement  (e.g.,  delivery  of  entitlements,  selection  of  new  housing  sites, \nrestoration  of  incomes,  provision  of  replacement  land,  and  other  economic  measures).  A \ntraining program will be organized for the PMO resettlement units.  \n \nFor  the  eight  representative  subprojects,  the  cost  estimate  for  land  acquisition  and \n12. \nresettlement  program  is  CNY65  million  ($7.9  million)  in  2004  prices,  excluding  contingencies. \nResettlement  implementation  will  be  scheduled  to  precede  the  overall  project  construction \nschedule.  However,  before  those  affected  are  moved  and  land  is  acquired,  a  detailed \nmeasurement  survey  will  be  conducted  in  each  village,  which  will  be  the  basis  for  village  and \nhousehold agreements to be negotiated. \n \n13. \nfollowing \nmethodologies  specified  in  the  RPs.  Internal  supervision  and  monitoring  will  be  done  by  the \nproject  resettlement  office  of  each  IA  to  ensure  compliance  with  RP  provisions.  The  project \nresettlement  office  has  agreed  to  a  set  of  supervision  milestones  with  ADB,  which  should  be \nfollowed  to  ensure  timely  and  effective  implementation  of  resettlement  activities.  HPMO  will \nprepare  quarterly  monitoring  reports  on  resettlement  and  submit  them  to  ADB.  HPMO  will \ncontract  an  independent  agency  to  conduct  external  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  report  to \nADB and the HPMO every 6 months. \n\nInternal  and  external  monitoring \n\nimplementation \n\nis  planned \n\nfor  RP \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n53 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  economic  analysis  covers  both  the  Project  as  a  whole,  and  the  individual \n1. \nsubprojects. For the Project as a whole, the analysis covers the rationale for public intervention; \nthe goals of the investment plan; and the general design of the plan, including selection criteria \nfor subprojects. The economic analysis then evaluates the individual subprojects relative to the \nselection criteria, focusing on the least-cost analysis. \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of the Project \n\nRationale for Public Intervention \n\n1. \n \n2. \nThe primary motivation for the Project results from increasing concern over the effects of \neconomic growth on environmental quality. Rapid economic growth and continuing urbanization \nhas  resulted  in  increasing  water  shortages  and  pollution,  especially  in  northern  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC). The Hai River Basin (HRB) is one of the PRC's most polluted basins, \nwith  more  than  80%  of  river  reaches  failing  to  meet  their  targeted  water  quality.  Surface  and \ngroundwater  pollution  pose  risks  for  public  health  and  the  environment  in  general.  Pollution  is \nalso  starting  to  constrain  national  and  local  development  objectives,  including  the  incipient \nsouth\u2013north water transfer. \n \n3. \nThe  existence  of  serious  and  growing  problems  with  water  pollution  demonstrate  that \nprivate  sector  responses  alone  are  inadequate.  Generators  of  wastewater  have  the  incentive \nonly to convey their wastewater sufficiently downstream so that they do not pollute themselves, \nand have no incentive to treat the wastewater at the point of discharge.  \n \nThe  Project  involves  government  intervention  at  several  different  levels.  The  central \n4. \nGovernment  is  coordinating  the  management  of  surface  water  quality  in  the  HRB  (as  well  as \nother basins in the PRC). The Henan provincial government contributed to the basin plan, and is \ncoordinating  and  implementing  the  elements  of  the  basin  plan  that  are  in  Henan  province. \nMunicipal  and  county  governments  are  making  individual  investments  in  the  water  supply  and \nwastewater treatment works, and will be involved in managing the completed facilities. \n \n5. \nGovernment  involvement  is  sound  at  each  level.  Government  has  a  role  in  controlling \nthe externalities from discharges of untreated wastewater, and coordinating the management of \nsurface  water  quality.  Government  management  of  surface  water  has  effectively  allocated  to \nwater users the right to surface water of a given quality, thereby denying the right of generators \nto pollute, and requiring generators to pay the cost of wastewater treatment. Involvement of the \ncentral Government is justified since the HRB spans several provinces. \n \n6. \nGovernment involvement in individual projects is justified since both urban water supply \nand wastewater management are natural monopolies. Local governments are adopting a variety \nof strategies to manage the water supply and wastewater utilities. All utilities will be owned by \nlocal governments, and managed as independent public enterprises. Contracting operation and \nmaintenance  of  the  wastewater  treatment  plants  with  the  private  sector  is  encouraged, \nespecially for local governments without prior experience in wastewater management.  \n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n2. \n\nGoals of the Project \n\n7. \nThe Project has both general and specific goals. The general plans for economic growth \nand  development,  for  Henan  province  as  well  as  the  PRC  as  a  whole,  provide  the  basis  or \ncontext  for  the  goals  specific  to  the  Project.  For  example,  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  for  Henan \nprovince aims to (among other things) double per capita gross domestic product in real terms by \n2010, and double it again by 2020. The plan recognizes that achieving these goals will require \nprotecting, improving, and maintaining environmental quality, including surface water quality in \nparticular. \n \n8. \nThe goals most directly relevant to the investment plan come out of the Hai River Plan \n(HRP), which aims to improve and maintain surface water quality throughout the HRB. The HRP \nwas  formulated  by  the  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration,  and  approved  by  the \nState  Council  in  1999.  The  Henan  provincial  government  developed  a  subsidiary  plan  for \nmanaging water quality in the part of the province contained in the HRB. \n \nGoals  for  surface  water  quality  are  a  key  feature  of  the  HRP.  They  are  based  on  five \n9. \nmain  classifications  of  surface  water  quality,  set  according  to  the  intended  use  of  the  water. \nClass  I  applies  to  pristine  waters;  classes  II  and  III  apply  to  surface  water  that  is  used  as  a \nsource of raw water for urban water supply; and classes IV and V are for surface water that is \nintended  only  for  irrigation  and  industrial  use.  Each  class  is  defined  by  30  criteria,  prescribing \nnumeric  ranges  for  the  physical,  chemical,  and  biological  properties  of  water  (such  as \ntemperature, pH, and coliform counts). The State Environmental Protection Administration sets \nwater quality goals for some key, strategic, river reaches. Generally, the relevant environmental \nprotection department\u2014county, municipal, or provincial\u2014sets the water quality goal. \n \n\nDesign of the Plan \n\n3. \n \nThere is no unique, least-cost plan to achieve the water quality goals, and any plan that \n10. \nminimizes  cost  is  acceptable,  in  principle.  Standard  economic  theory  provides  one  least-cost \nplan, based on economic incentives. Although implementing that (or any other) least-cost plan \nperfectly  is  not  feasible  in  the  HRB,  a  plan  based  on  economic  incentives  provides  a  simple \nstandard for evaluating the actual plan.  \n \n11. \nThe water quality goals may be achieved at least cost through a centralized wastewater \nmanagement  system,  under  the  following  conditions.  All  point-sources  discharging  to  a  given \nreach  should  be  connected  to  a  sewer  system,  with  the  sewer  system  discharging  to  a \ncentralized  treatment  plant.  The  Henan  Hai  River  Plan  (HHRP)  aims  to  meet  that  condition, \nalthough  it  has  known  limitations  to  achieving  comprehensive  house  connections.  Those \nlimitations will be addressed in implementing the Project.  \n \n12. \nAll discharges to the sewer must be similar, or else be classified according to the nature \nof the  waste load.  Commercial  and  domestic discharges  are similar,  by their  nature. Industrial \ndischarges  to  the  sewer  must  meet  given  standards,  and  when  those  standards  are  met \nindustrial  discharges  can  be  considered  as  uniform.  Enforcing  the  standards  for  industrial \ndischarges is therefore an important element in implementing the HHRP and will be addressed \nduring Project implementation. \n \nAll  wastewater  generators  within  a  given  type  should  face  the  same  charge  per  unit \n13. \ndischarge.  This  condition  applies  to  industrial  generators,  but  under  the  proposed  tariffs, \ndischarges from commercial sources will face a higher usage charge than domestic discharges. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n55 \n\nThis  feature  of  the  tariff  increases  the  total  economic  cost  of  wastewater  management  across \nthe system, with either commercial discharge too low, or domestic discharge too high, or both. \n  \n14. \nThe  charge  per  type  of  discharge  should  equal  the  marginal  cost  of  conveyance  and \ntreatment. Usage charges are expected to be set at an average cost, and average cost equals \nmarginal cost when the plant is operating at the minimum efficient scale. Economies of scale in \nbuilding  and  operating  a  treatment  plant  mean  that  plants  are  designed  with  excess  capacity \nrelative to current wastewater generation, so the treatment plants will not operate initially at their \nminimum  efficient  scale.  Installing  excess  capacity  is  economically  justified,  but  the  proposed \nusage charge is not economically efficient, at least for the initial operation of plants. This feature \nof  the  tariff  increases  the  total  economic  cost  of  wastewater  management,  with  the  spare \ncapacity perhaps unnecessarily idle; the extent of the inefficiency depends on the price elasticity \nof wastewater discharges. Wastewater tariffs will be reviewed after construction of the treatment \nplants, and will be set according to the PRC's latest standards or guidelines. \n \n15. \nEach  treatment  plant  should  be  designed  at  least  cost,  in  terms  of  location,  scale  (or \nplanning horizon), and treatment technology. The investments must be prioritized, since the size \nand scope of the plan prevents all investments from being made simultaneously. Construction of \nthe  treatment  plants  is  prioritized  informally,  through  various  targets.  For  example,  each \nmunicipality must have a treatment plant by 2005, and each county by 2007. Conditions relating \nto  plant  design  and  priorities  are  stipulated  in  the  selection  criteria,  and  are  discussed  in  the \ncontext of the analysis of individual subprojects. \n \n16. \nIn  addition  to  the  wastewater  treatment  plants,  the  HHRP  also  includes  several  urban \nwater  supply  investments.  The  HHRP  cannot  expect  to  immediately  improve  surface  water \nquality. Although the water supply investments are not directly relevant to meeting the surface \nwater  quality  goals,  the  water  supply  plants  are  relevant  to  mitigating  the  effects  of  water \npollution  during  HHRP  implementation.  The  water  supply  plants  will  be  designed  at  least \neconomic cost, and will replace polluted sources of raw water. \n \n17. \nThe  HHRP  has  the  potential  to  achieve  the  water  quality  goals  at  least  cost,  but  the \npotential is not fully realized through inefficiencies in the wastewater tariff. Aside from limitations \nin  the  tariff,  the  HHRP  is  economically  sound  provided  the  individual  investments  meet  the \neconomic  selection  criteria,  and  policies  regarding  connections  and  industrial  discharges  are \nadequately implemented. \n \nC. \n \n\nAnalysis of Individual Subprojects \n\nLeast-Cost Analysis of Individual Subprojects \n\n1. \n \n \nThe least-cost analysis ensures that each subproject is optimally designed both to meet \n18. \nthe goals of the HHRP, and does not involve unnecessary extra costs. The least-cost analysis \nshould cover all feasible alternatives for a given subproject, including variations in location and \ntreatment technology. Ideally, least-cost analysis will also cover the planning horizon or capacity \nof the plant, but capacity is constrained by other factors. \n \n19. \nFor  each  subproject,  a  minimum  of  two  and  a  maximum  of  four  alternatives  were \nassessed based on the options presented in the feasibility study reports, with various additions \nand variations by the project preparatory technical assistance study team. The alternatives are \ngenerally characterized as follows: \n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\noption proposed in the feasibility study reports, \nsame as (i), with alternative treatment process, \nsame as (i), with alternative treatment site location, and \nsame as (i), with alternative pipeline layouts. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n \nThe  results  of  the  analysis  confirm  that  the  preferred  options  stated  in  the  feasibility \n\n20. \nstudy reports for the representative subprojects are the least-cost alternatives. \n \n\n2. \n\nGeneral Assessment of Individual Subprojects \n\n \n21. \nIn addition to being least-cost, each individual subproject must be economically justified. \nThe first standard by which to judge a subproject's justification is with respect to the HHRP. Any \nsubproject that is least-cost and identified as an integral component of the HHRP is, therefore, \nfully  justified.  All  subprojects  are  indeed  integral  to  the  HHRP,  as  shown  during  the  project \npreparatory technical assistance. \n \nApplying  standard  benefit-cost  analysis  can  strengthen  the  economic  justification  of \n22. \nindividual  subprojects.  Such  analysis  is  ultimately  unnecessary  for  subprojects  confirmed  as \nintegral  to  the  HHRP,  but  is  a  useful  confirmation,  considering  that  benefit-cost  analysis  is \nstandard under ADB guidelines.  \n \n23. \nThe main benefits were quantified under the following categories:  \n\nEconomic internal rates of return were, therefore, derived for the individual subprojects. \n\nwastewater  management  component:  (a)  willingness  to  pay  by  nonindustrial \nbeneficiaries, (b) industrial wastewater treatment savings, (c) health benefits, and \n(d) recycled effluent (Anyang City only\u2500for cooling at local power plant); and \n\nwater supply component: willingness-to-pay for improved and expanded water \ndelivery services. \n\n \n24. \nThe  rates  of  return  for  the  representative  subprojects  range  from  14%  to  18%  for  the \nwastewater  management  projects  and  from  17%  to  20%  for  the  water  supply  projects. \nSensitivity tests  on the  main  parameters indicate that the results are robust  and the  proposed \ninvestments are economically justified. \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n57 \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nIntroduction \n\nFinancial Forecasts \n\nA.  \n \n1. \nFinancial  analysis  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  for  the  Financial \nGovernance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) and the Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector \nProjects of ADB. An assessment of financial performance was completed for operations once the \nProject is implemented. The evaluation determines the level of cost recovery from users required to \nservice the ADB loan and achieve financial health. The assessment was done for each of the eight \nrepresentative  water  supply  and  wastewater  subprojects  and  each  sector.  Details  of  the  financial \nanalysis and financial projections are given in Supplementary Appendix K, which contains income \nstatements,  balance  sheets,  sources  and  application  of  funds,  financial  internal  rates  of  return \n(FIRRs), and domestic affordability. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nProjections  are  based  on  information  in  the  draft  final  reports  prepared  by  the  project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA) consultants funded by ADB, and information gathered from \ndiscussion  with  each  of  the  project  management  offices.  System  investments  include  water \nvolumes sufficient to satisfy demand in 2020. Treatment plant investments were estimated for 2010 \ndemand,  and  so  operations  are  forecast  at  those  levels.  Growth  in  wastewater  tariff  revenues  is \nbased  on  forecast  growth  in  total  water  consumption,  with  the  balance  beyond  sales  of  water \nsupply  companies  met  by  self-supply.  Forecasts  for  water  and  wastewater  volumes  agree  with \nthose in the economic analysis.  \n \n3. \nThe  projections  for  the  water  supply  companies  in  Boai  and  Weihui  incorporate  historical \naudited accounts for fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003, as they operate as full utility companies. \nThe  remaining  projections  are  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  operators  will  be  full  utility \ncompanies  at  least  by  the  completion  of  the  project  investments.  Uncertainty  remains  as  to \nwhether  the  wastewater  and  water  supply  companies  in  a  town  will  be  combined  into  a  single \nagency; thus separate accounting results are shown for each. \n \n4. \nAccounting results are shown through to 2020, but all flows were extended for a further 5 \nyears  for  the  FIRR  calculation,  which  also  includes  a  residual  value,  equal  to  net  asset  value. \nAnnual  domestic  inflation  is  assumed  at  3.0%  through  the  projection  period.  Depreciation  is \nassumed  as  2.5%  for  civil  works  and  7.5%  for  mechanical  and  electrical  equipment.  Deferred \nexpenses are amortized at 10%. Terms for ADB onlending are assumed at 4.71% interest, and a \n5-year  grace  period  followed  by  a  20-year  repayment  period.  Terms  for  domestic  borrowing  are \nassumed  at  7%,  grace  with  interest  accumulated  until  start  operations,  and  then  10  years \nrepayment.  \n \nC. \n \n5. \nTariffs either directly or indirectly relevant to the project are (i) water resource charges, (ii) \nurban water supply tariffs, and (iii) the recently introduced wastewater charges. Such tariffs do not \njust raise revenues to finance utility services, but are also policy instruments that might be used for \nseveral purposes. At this point, the main purpose is to ensure that water and wastewater tariffs will \ncover  long-term  costs.  A  policy  dialogue  with  local  and  national  governments  regarding  other \npossible goals and aims of tariffs continues. \n \n\nTariffs \n\n1.  Water Resource Charges \n\n \n6. \nExisting  private  sources  of  urban  supply  are  boreholes  tapping  the  shallow  aquifer.  The \nshallow  aquifers  are  already  polluted  and  abstracting  from  them  is  causing  subsidence.  Water \nresource  charges  levied  on  nonagricultural  users  are  based  on  either  measured  or  assessed \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nconsumption. Charges are set on a municipality-by-municipality basis and range from CNY0.05 per \ncubic  meter  (m3)  in  Jiaozuo  cities  to  CNY0.45  per  m3  in  Puyang  cities.  Industrial  and  domestic \nusers  are  levied  the  same  unit  charge.  For  most  small  users,  the  charge  is  based  on  assessed \nvolumes with only larger industries being metered. Industries that exceed water usage quotas are \nliable to a surcharge levied by the local water conservancy bureau. The higher charge in Puyang \nmunicipality  appears  to  reflect  a  combination  of  the  more  acute  water  situation  in  that  area  and \ngreater  municipal  government  awareness  that  price  will  affect  demand;  consumption  there  is \nalways measured and charged. \n \n\n2. \n\nUrban Water Supply Tariffs \n\n3. \n\nWastewater Tariff \n\n \n7. \nUrban  water  supply  tariffs  in  all  the  project  cities  are  levied  on  volume  taken.  The  tariff \nstructure  differentiates  between  domestic,  institutional,  industrial,  and  commercial  users,  with  a \nhigher rate applying to special users such as public baths and other high consumption users. The \nwater tariff rates cross-subsidize between the different user categories, with domestic users paying \nless than industrial, commercial, and special users.   \n \n \n \n8. \nIn all of the project areas, wastewater charges are a user fee based on water use. Henan \nprovincial government has taken the lead in introducing wastewater charges and urged county and \nmunicipal governments to take appropriate action on this. Henan provincial government has issued \na guidance document recommending a provincial standard, with charges of CNY0.6, CNY0.7, and \nCNY0.8 per m3 to be levied on domestic, industrial, and commercial customers, respectively. The \nguidance also asks that wastewater charges be jointly billed with the water supply charge and that \nthe same charge be levied on estimated self-use water. \n \n9. \nAs a charge on  water consumed rather than  wastewater treated, the charge can  be seen \nmore as a general pollution charge than a treatment charge. As such, it will (i) not deter customers \nfrom using the wastewater system when it is available, (ii) have a cross-subsidization element as it \nis  based  on  the  water  bill,  and  (iii)  raise  revenue  to  allow  the  introduction  of  new  systems. \nConsideration  may  have  to  be  given  to  introducing  more  sophisticated  charges  for  industry,  with \nthe heavier polluters paying a higher charge. The tariff will be considered during project execution. \n \nAnyang city has  had a  wastewater  tariff in force for several years,  which  was  higher than \n10. \nthe provincial guidance. Some county cities introduced charges during 2004, while others plan to \ndo so from the start of 2005. All the project cities, including Anyang, have either adopted or plan to \nadopt  the  provincial  standard  tariff.  None  have  any  plan  to  vary  the  tariff  to  reflect  local \ncircumstances, preferring to deflect criticism to higher levels of government. Public awareness and \nwillingness to pay the new wastewater charges are low and action may be needed to improve this \nsituation.  \n \nSince the  wastewater charge is (or  will be)  added to the  water supply bill using the same \n11. \nmetered consumption, consumers can be expected to adjust their demand for water based on the \ntotal  charge.  Studies  in  the  country  have  shown  that  demand  is  sensitive  to  tariffs,  but  that  this \nsensitivity is less when the existing tariff is low. Demand is also sensitive to incomes. The local and \nTA  consultants  did  not  study  demand  as  related  to  tariffs.  This  gap  will  be  filled  during  project \nimplementation. \n \n12. \nIn  very  broad  terms,  implementation  of  full  cost-recovery  tariffs  is  likely  to  result  in  a  real \nincrease of some 65% in the combined tariff (the situation will vary from city to city) and increase \nthe average costs of water services from around 2% of average household income to up to 3.5% of \nhousehold  income.  These  are  not  high  according  to  international  norms,  but  they  are  significant. \nThe  socioeconomic  survey  suggests  that  a  poor  household  currently  consumes  about  20%  less \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n59 \n\nWater and Wastewater Revenue Projections \n\nwater  than  a  non-poor  household.  Their  30%  lower  earnings  imply  a  fairly  standard  income \nelasticity of around 0.60; demand will increase significantly as incomes grow.   \n \nD. \n \n13.  Wastewater companies will have two revenue streams. The first comprises revenues billed \nand  collected  by  the  water  supply  companies,  in  addition  to  the  water  supply  charges.  Since  the \nwastewater  charge  is  now  classified  as  an  administrative  fee,  it  is  currently  transferred  from  the \nwater supply company to the local government finance bureau and distributed according to need. \nProposals  to  change  the  fee  to  a  user  charge  would  result  in  it  being  distributed  directly  to  the \nwastewater company, since the finance bureau is allowed by law to deal only in taxes. This should \nbe kept under review, however. \n \n14. \nThe second revenue stream is from charges levied on self-supply. These are now collected \neither  by  the  water  resource  bureau  or  sometimes  the  wastewater  company.  Currently,  they  are \ntransferred to the finance bureau but that should change. Self-supply volumes are now substantial \nin  each  of  the  eight  subproject  areas.  Reducing  this  when  new  water  supply  company  capacity \ncomes  online  will  require  local  government  enforcement.  Institutional  changes  will  be  required  to \nlevy the charge efficiently. Collection is assumed to reach 75% by 2010, and ultimately 90% over \nthe projection period. The sensitivity to this is modeled in the financial projections. \n \n15. \nRevenues  will  depend  on  the  tariff.  In  the  case  of  wastewater  this  is  assumed  to  be  the \ncharges  recommended  by  the  province  and  approved  by  the  cities.  Per  m3,  they  are  domestic, \nCNY0.6;  institutional,  CNY0.7;  commercial,  industrial,  and  other,  CNY0.8.  The  province  has \nrecently  increased  its  recommended  guideline  by  about  15%,  but  as  this  has  not  yet  been \napproved by local governments cannot be used as a base. The presently approved charges have \nbeen increased biannually at the maximum of (i) inflation, and (ii) the rate necessary to ensure that \npossible financial covenants are satisfied. For the FIRR, a 4% minimum rate is assumed since it is \nADB\u2019s  minimum  rate  test  for  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC).  The  WACC  will  vary \nslightly by project since it, like the FIRR, is after tax. Calculations for individual projects show that it \nis less than 3%. \n \n16. \ninflation, and (ii) the rate necessary to ensure that possible financial covenants are satisfied.  \n \nE. \n \n17. \nTable  A16.1  shows  the  results  for  six  key  project  indicators  for  each  representative \nwastewater  subproject:  base  FIRR,  the  sensitivity  FIRR,  the  earned  FIRR,  financial  ratios,  and \naffordability. The table also shows the real biannual tariff increase assumed and the resulting level \nof  the  tariff  in  2015.  In  practice,  these  increases  are  necessary  to  give  a  debt-service  coverage \nratio  of  1.2;  they  are  not  required  to  provide  an  FIRR  above  the  WACC.  Discussions  imply  that \ntariffs up to around CNY1 could be introduced without difficulty.  \n \n18. \nThe  sensitivity  FIRR  (Table  A16.1)  shows  the  effect  of  change  in  the  variable  considered \nmost uncertain. This is revenues from self-supplied water since billings for these revenues will be \nbased on assumed consumption and the requirement to pay will not be backed by the possibility of \na supply cut-off. The indicator shows the effect of a 50% decrease in these revenues as well as an \nincrease of 20% in operating expenses.  \n \nBoth  the  base  and  sensitivity  FIRR  are  based  on  the  total  revenues  from  the  wastewater \n19. \ncharge,  not  on  revenues  related  to  the  volume  of  water  treated.  Since,  it  was  agreed  that  the \nwastewater  companies  will  keep  those  revenues  once  they  are  established,  these  FIRRs  are \ncorrect; the wastewater company will make the investments, pay the operating costs, and receive \nthe revenues. If the company does not have the capacity, however, it will not be able to treat all the \n\nFor water supply, existing tariffs are forecast to increase biannually at the maximum of: (i) \n\nFinancial Results\u2500Wastewater \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nwastewater  produced  and  so  cannot  be  said  to  have  fully  earned  the  revenues.  About  30%  of \nwastewater  will  not  reach  the  sewers  in  any  case,  through  no  fault  of  the  company.  Since  the \nplanning horizon assumed was only 2010, investment included in the cash flow will sometimes not \nprovide  the  required  capacity  over  the  forecast  period.  Adjusting  for  this  factor  provides  the \nestimates for the earned FIRR (Table A16.1). \n \n20. \nThe financial ratios (Table A16.1) are those for which specific assurances are being asked \nor covenanted. These are for the maintenance of (i) minimum debt-service coverage ratio of 1.2, \n(ii) maximum debt over debt plus equity ratio of 70/30, and (iii) minimum current ratio of 2. Some \nleeway is allowed in the current ratio, which measures current assets over current liabilities, if the \nratio is below 2 only for a few years at the start of project operations.  \n \n21. \nThe affordability indicators are the percentages of urban poor household incomes taken by \nthe  combined  water  and  wastewater  charges.  A  standard  international  assumption  is  that  5%  is \naffordable. \n \n\nTable A16.1: Representative Wastewater Project Financial Results \n\nBoai \n\nWeihui \n\nPuyang \n\nAnyang \n\n4.1% to 2010\n\n14.7% to 2010 \n\nLinzhou \n0% \n\n11.2% to 2010  9.3% to 2010\n\nCNY1.2 \n5.0 \n1.5 \n5.0 \n1.2 \n40/60 \n1.8 \n1.7 \n\nCNY1.0 \n5.2 \n2.6 \n3.5 \n1.2 \n64/36 \n2.2 \n2.4 \n\nItem \nReal Tariff Increase, per \nannum \nReal Tariff, 2015 \nBase FIRR (%) \nSensitivity FIRR (%) \nEarned FIRR (%) \nMinimum DSCR \nMaximum Debt/Equity \nMinimum Current Ratio \nAffordability (%) \n( ) = negative value, DSCR = debt-service coverage ratio, FIRR= financial internal rate of return.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \nF. \n \n22. \nTable  A16.2  provides  similar  results  for  the  representative  water  supply  projects.
