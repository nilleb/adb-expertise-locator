An initial environmental examination was undertaken. (A \nAssessment  summary is in Appendix 10.) \n   \nProject Description  With the Project, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will continue its \nsupport  of  and  commitment  to  regional  cooperation,  particularly  in \ninformation  and  communication  technology  (ICT),  under  the \nSubregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) Program, which covers \nBangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  and  Nepal.  The  SASEC  ICT  Working \nGroup (ICTWG) established in 2003, has identified three most urgent \nareas  for  improvements  in  ICT  in  the  subregion:  (i)  cross-border \nconnectivity, (ii) rural access to information, and (iii) human resource \ncapacity. To meet these needs, the SASEC countries have developed \nthe concept of the SASEC information highway, to deliver and facilitate \nmodern  broadband  information,  communication,  and  knowledge \nservices  within  and  across  borders  to  governments,  businesses, \nresearch institutes, and rural and remote communities. \n \nTo support the SASEC information highway initiative, the Project has \nthree components: (i) a SASEC regional network with fiber-optic and \ndata  interchange  capacity,  directly  connecting  the  four  SASEC \ncountries;  (ii)  a  SASEC  village  network  expanding  broadband  ICT \naccess to 110 rural communities in the SASEC countries and directly \nconnecting  the  communities  for  local  networking  and  information \nsourcing; and (iii) a SASEC research and training network building \ntechnical and business skills in ICT, particularly in developing local \ncontent  and  e-applications  (such  as  e-government,  e-learning, \ntele-medicine, e-remittance, e-commerce) for the needs of the poor. \n   \nRationale  There is great diversity among the SASEC countries, with each country \nat  a  quite  different  stage  of  ICT  development  and  with  different \nobjectives and circumstances. Bhutan has less than one million people \nand little ICT experience, while India has more than one billion people \nand substantial ICT achievements. This diversity presents considerable \nopportunities for cooperation.  \n \nCross-border connectivity is recognized as a critical area in need of \nregional cooperation, as ICT infrastructure across borders has been \n ", "ii   \nfragmentally developed and is often outdated. For example, Internet \ntraffic in the subregion often goes via third parties, and overly relies on \nsatellite  transmission.  For  this  reason,  Internet  connections  in \nlandlocked countries like Bhutan and Nepal are much more costly and \nlower in quality. On the other hand, Bangladesh and India, despite \nbeing connected to major submarine cables, do not yet fully capitalize \non  the  business  potential  to  provide  high-quality,  affordable,  and \nreliable  broadband  capacity  to  neighboring  countries.  Regionally \nintegrated and high-quality broadband capacity would not only keep \nlocal traffic local and optimize the cost of interconnection within the \nregion but also contribute to reducing the prices of ICT services to end \nusers and boosting ICT use across borders. \n \nBridging  the  rural-urban  divide  in  ICT  is  another  area  for  regional \ncooperation.  Commercially  driven  ICT  development  has  left  rural \npeople  behind  and  widened  the  disparity  between  rural  and  urban \nareas. Rural community e-centers (CECs) have been tested and have \nproved effective in addressing this issue. India\u2019s rural CEC models and \nBangladesh\u2019s Grameen village phone are pioneering and innovative \nexamples of the use of ICT in reducing poverty in the countryside. The \nCEC movement in India has evolved into a national initiative, with the \nprospect of Internet connectivity in every village. Grameen Telecom in \nBangladesh is now a major mobile operator and has extended the \napplication of its microfinance model to Internet village kiosks in rural \nareas. CECs have been tried out for some years in Nepal and more \nrecently in Bhutan, but these experiments have yet to reach nationwide \nscale, under government or private leadership. A regional approach \nwould enhance the efforts of the SASEC countries to bridge the digital \ndivide by sharing their experiences and connecting rural communities \nwith one another and with the rest of the world, and ultimately with the \nvast source of information, content, and services that is the Internet. \n \nThe  need  for  more  and  higher-quality  training  in  ICT  and  for \nheightened ICT literacy and awareness has been expressed by all the \nSASEC countries including India, where ICT development has created \nmillions  of  jobs  over  the  past  few  decades.  All  these  countries \nrecognize the relationship between good-quality tertiary training and \nresearch, on the one hand, and staff retention and ultimate industry \ndevelopment, on the other. At present, except in certain public and \nprivate institutions of excellence, many ICT training initiatives do not \nmeet international quality standards. India may have trained a large \npool of skilled human resources in the ICT sector, but it still needs to \nmaintain and upgrade the quality of its human resources to sustain its \ncompetitive  edge  in  ICT  in  the  global  market.  The  other  SASEC \ncountries are more seriously constrained when it comes to mobilizing \nqualified human resources for ICT. A regional approach to building \nhuman capacity through shared resources would enable the SASEC \ncountries to capitalize on the digital opportunities as a group. \n   \n ", "  iii\nImpact and Outcome  The Project will enhance the benefits of ICT and regional cooperation \nfor inclusive growth and poverty reduction by increasing the supply of \naffordable broadband, skilled ICT manpower, and local content and \ne-applications particularly for the needs of the poor. It is also expected \nto help the SASEC countries improve their productivity and efficiency \nand participate fully in the global information economy.  \n   \nProject Investment  The project investment cost is estimated at $24.0 million, including \nPlan   taxes and duties of $2.7 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  ADB grants of $4.7 million to Bhutan and $9.0 million to Nepal, and a \nloan of $3.1 million to Bangladesh from Special Funds resources will \nfinance  70%  of  the  project  cost.  The  governments  of  the  SASEC \ncountries will finance $7.2 million, or 30%. The Asian Development \nFund (ADF) loan to Bangladesh will be denominated in special drawing \nrights, and will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of \n8 years, and an interest rate of 1% per year during the grace period \nand 1.5% after that.  \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2009 \nCompletion Date   \n   \nPeriod of Grant and  1 April 2008\u250030 June 2010 \nLoan Utilization \n   \nExecuting Agencies  Ministry of Science and Information and Communication Technology of \nBangladesh; Ministry of Information and Communication of Bhutan; \nDepartment of Information Technology, Ministry of  Communications \nand Information Technology, of India; and Ministry of Information and \nCommunications of Nepal. \n   \nImplementation  The three networks under the Project\u2014a regional network, a village \nArrangements  network, and a research and training network\u2014will be built and run by \nprivate sector service agencies to be selected from eligible providers, \nthrough public-private partnerships (PPPs) developed and modified on \nthe basis of PPP practices in India and elsewhere.  \n \nFor the regional network, each country will select a service agency with \na  national  fiber-optic  network  and  an  international  long-distance \nlicense,  to  build,  keep,  manage,  and  operate  the  network  and \nequipment  as  designed,  built,  and  installed.  The  operation  of  the \nvillage  network  (including  CECs)  and  the  provision  of  minimum \nservices to the poor will be franchised through auction, lease, or other \nappropriate  means  to  private  entrepreneurs  among  rural  Internet \nservice  providers  (ISPs)  or  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs), \nwhich will be provided with financial support to ensure the sustainability \nof the village network. For the research and training network, service \nagencies in each country will be selected from capable ICT research\n \n ", "iv   \n  institutes including universities, to design and conduct research and \ntraining for ICT professional development. Several agreements will be \ndrawn up and signed: (i) a multilateral cooperation agreement, to be \nsigned by the executing agencies (EAs) for all the SASEC countries; \n(ii) six bilateral interconnection agreements, each one to be signed by \nthe regional network service agencies of the two countries concerned; \nand  (iii) 12  in-country  service  agency  agreements,  each  one  to  be \nsigned by the EA and the service agency for each of the three project \nnetworks. \n \nA steering committee, consisting of the secretaries of the EAs for the \nfour countries, will be formed to jointly supervise and monitor overall \nproject implementation. It will also guide the project management units \n(PMUs)  in  coordinating  joint  activities,  and  will  clear  the  draft \nagreements for signing. Each PMU, to be established under each EA, \nwill be headed by a project director (joint secretary) and will have as \nmembers a technical expert (project manager), an administrative staff, \nand a representative of the service agency. It will be responsible for the \nday-to-day implementation of the Project in coordination with project \nmanagement consultants. The PMU will (i) recruit the country project \nmanagement consultants in consultation with ADB; (ii) supervise and \nmonitor the work of these consultants; (iii) maintain project accounts \n(including the imprest account), endorse the invoices presented by the \nproject management consultants, and prepare withdrawal requests for \npayments to contractors; (iv) prepare the statement of expenditure in \nsupport of requests for imprest account replenishment, and prepare the \nyearly financial statement for the Project and have it audited by an \nexternal auditor; and (v) report each month on the progress of the \nimplementation to the steering committee and ADB. \n   \nProcurement  The goods, services, and civil works to be financed under the ADB \ngrants  and  loan  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Civil works and \nsystem  development  and  installation  contracts  will  be  procured \naccording to the procurement plan (see Appendix 6).  \n \nAny necessary modifications or clarifications of recipient procurement \nprocedures will be documented in the procurement plan. \n \nProject management equipment for the PMU will be procured by the \nproject management consultants according to the procurement plan \n(see Appendix 6).  \n \n ", "  v\nConsulting Services  Project  management  consultants  will  be  hired  to  assist  the  EA  in \nimplementing the Project. There will be an international team (team \nleader, design engineer, and procurement specialist) and four country \nteams. Each country team will have three subteams: a SASEC regional \nnetwork team, a village network/research and training network team, \nand a joint team. The first two subteams will each comprise a team \nleader, a design engineer, a procurement specialist, and a network \nengineer. The joint team will consist of a social development specialist, \nan  environment  specialist,  and  a  quality  assurance  specialist.  An \ninternational consulting firm will be hired for 36 person-months, and \nnational consulting firms, for 100 person-months each in Bangladesh, \nBhutan,  and  Nepal,  and  63  person-months  in  India.  The  project \nmanagement consultants will (i) design all networks to be procured \nunder the Project; (ii) prepare bid documents; (iii) assist the PMU in \ntendering  (prequalification,  evaluation  of  proposals,  etc.);  and \n(iv) supervise contractors. \n \nThe  project  management  consultants  will  be  selected  and  hired \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time)  and  through  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection (80:20) and simplified technical proposal. ADB will consider \napproving  the  advance  recruitment  of  consultants  on  the \nunderstanding that such action will not necessarily commit ADB to \nfinancing the Project.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project is expected to have an overall economic internal rate of \nBeneficiaries  return of 34.3%. The direct tangible benefits will come from (i) savings \naccruing to Nepal and Bhutan on the cost of connecting to Internet \nservice as a result of the shift from expensive satellite links to cable \nlanding  stations  (CLSs)  made  possible  by  the  SASEC  regional \nnetwork,  and  (ii) incremental  revenues  to  be  earned  by  India  and \nBangladesh  from  payments  by  Nepal  and  Bhutan  for  the  CLS \nconnection. Improved and more affordable broadband access to the \nInternet resulting from the Project will also boost the development and \nconsumption of ICT and thereby increase economic productivity and \nefficiency.  \n \nPoverty is often found to be significantly related to a lack of knowledge \nand information; ICT can make such knowledge and information more \naccessible. Rural poverty rates in the SASEC countries range from \n20% (India) to 42% (Bhutan), and amount to 40% in Bangladesh and \n35% in Nepal. More than two thirds of the rural population in these \ncountries  subsists  on  agriculture  (including  livestock)  and  forestry. \nRural  farming  relies  on  rudimentary  and  outdated  information  and \noffers  limited  opportunities  to  market  agricultural  products.  Rural \nchildren  attend  school  with  greater  difficulty  than  their  urban \ncounterparts, stay for shorter periods, leave with fewer qualifications, \nand are less likely to proceed to further education, whether technical or \nhigher education. Public services, including health care and finance, \nare usually centered in urban areas. \n ", "vi   \n  Underserved  and  isolated  by  physical  distance  and  poor \ntransportation, rural people are even more marginalized. The Project \nwill help address such challenges by improving rural ICT connectivity \nand  human  capacity  to  use  the  vast  information  and  knowledge \nresources and e-services in agriculture, marketing, employment, health \ncare, education, and government that are available on the Internet. \nThe Project will also enable the integration of rural communities for \nlocal  networking  and  local  information  sourcing,  giving  them  better \nopportunities to create and use knowledge for greater empowerment \nand improved livelihood. \n   \nRisks and  The successful implementation and operation of the project facilities \nAssumptions  will depend largely on multilateral and bilateral agreements among the \nSASEC  countries.  Any  difficulty  or  procrastination  in  signing  those \nagreements will delay or otherwise hamper the implementation and \noperation of the facilities. ADB\u2019s continued support for the SASEC \nICTWG will facilitate the signing of the agreements. \n \nTaking on the social responsibility of serving the rural communities \ncould render the operation of the SASEC village network and research \nand training network financially unviable, at least in part. To mitigate \nthis financial risk, franchises will be granted to private entrepreneurs \nsuch as rural ISPs and ICT research institutes to run the networks as \ncommercial  and  social  operations.  A  financial  resource  pool  with \ncontributions from the service agencies in the SASEC regional network \nwill  provide  needed  financial  support  for  the  social  responsibility \nfunctions of these agencies. ADB will ensure effective franchising of \nthe operations of the village and research and training networks, to \nmaximize the benefits of public-private partnership.  \n \nThe price for connecting to CLSs in India is competitively determined in \nthe market. But a market price for the service is yet to be established \nfor  Bangladesh.  ADB  will  collaborate  closely  with  the  EA  and  the \ntelecommunications regulator in Bangladesh in setting an optimal rate \nfor the operation of the SASEC regional network.  \n   \nTechnical  The Project will be complemented by an attached TA, which will build \nAssistance  up technical and business skills in developing local ICT content and \ne-applications  (such  as  e-government,  e-learning,  tele-medicine, \ne-remittance, e-commerce) particularly for the poor. The research and \ntraining  network  will  therefore  serve  as  a  SASEC  regional  ICT \nknowledge  network,  providing  teaching,  research,  professional \ndevelopment,  and  related  support  for  local  innovation  and \nentrepreneurship  in  the  creation  of  local  content  for  the  regional \ne-businesses and e-services to be delivered over the SASEC regional \nnetwork and the SASEC village network. To this end, the Project will \nset up a research and training center in the four selected ICT research \ninstitutes in the SASEC countries by providing (i) connectivity to the \nSASEC regional network, (ii) support for faculty mobilization and space \nrental, and (iii) ICT development support. The research and training\n \n ", "  vii\n  centers will (i) design and conduct research and training in e-business \ndevelopment and ICT professional development, for the delivery of \nservices to rural communities through the SASEC village network and \nCECs; and (ii) develop open content and training programs in ICT \nprofessional development.  \n \nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $4.4 million, which will be \nfinanced with a grant from ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation and Integration \nFund. ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and the EAs \nchosen to implement the Project will be the Implementing Agencies \n(IAs). The IAs and the project steering committee will be responsible \nfor  implementing  the  TA  in  coordination  with  ADB.  The  project \nmanagement consultants to be hired for the Project will design the \nresearch and training network for connectivity to the SASEC regional \nnetwork and the selected ICT research institute in each country. These \ninstitutes will be selected and hired according to the procurement plan. \nThe  TA  will  be  implemented  for  45  months,  from  April  2008  to \nDecember 2011. \n \n \n ", "o\n90  00'E\nBANGLADESH, BHUTAN, INDIA, NEPAL\nSOUTH ASIA SUBREGIONAL ECONOMIC COOPERATION\nINFORMATION HIGHWAY PROJECT\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\nPokhara\nNEPAL BHUTAN\nButwal\nGangtok Itanagar\nKathmandu\nHetauda Thimphu\nJorhat\nBhairawa Gelephu\nNautanwa Dhalkebar Banglabandha Phuentsholing\nBirganj Kakarbhitta\nRaxaul Itahari Jaigaon\nBiratnagar Siliguri Phulbari\nGorakhpur Guwahati\nJogbani Panitanki Panchagarh\nDispur\nBurimari Kohima\nShillong\n25 o 00'N Patna Hili Karimganj Silchar 25 o 00'N\nVaranasi Radhikapur Singhabad Sylhet\nBirol\nRohanpur MYANMAR\nBANGLADESH\nBarhi Rajshahi\nAizawi\nI N D I A\nDhaka\nNarayaganj Akhaura Agartala National Capital\nCity/Town\nGedes Darsana Comilla\nRanchi Petrapol Jessore In-country gateway to be \nestablished by the Project\nBangaon Benapol\nBorder township to be\nestablished by the Project\nKhulna\nExisting fiber optic network\nHaldiaKolkata Mongla Chittagong connected to in-country gateway\nN New fiber optic network\nSundarbans by the Project\nRoad\n0 50 100 150 200 Railway\n0 River\n7\n-37 Kilometers B a y    o f    B e n g a l International Boundary\n2\n1 (Asia) H Bhubaneswar Paradip 90o  00'E Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\nR", " \nI.

The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  ICT and the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Program \n2.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  had  a  major  role  in  supporting  regional \ncooperation among Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal through the SASEC Program since \n2001.1 With its growing importance in development, information and communication technology \n(ICT) was made a priority sector of phase II of the SASEC Program, which started in 2003. In \n2005,  the  SASEC  ICT  Working  Group  (ICTWG)  established  under  the  SASEC  Program \ndeveloped with ADB\u2019s assistance2 a SASEC ICT development master plan laying down the \n(cid:31)F\nstrategy, framework, and priorities for regional cooperation in ICT. The SASEC regional ICT \nstrategy  was  intended  to  coordinate  and  consolidate  the  national  leadership,  vision,  and \nstrategies of the four countries for ICT. It proposed three most urgent areas for improvement in \nICT: (i) cross-border connectivity, (ii) rural access to information, and (iii) human resource \ncapacity. To address these needs, the SASEC countries agreed, at the third ICTWG meeting in \nDhaka in September 2006, to develop the concept of the SASEC information highway, which \nwould deliver and facilitate modern broadband information, communication, and knowledge \nservices within and across borders to governments, businesses, research institutes, and rural \nand remote communities. ADB approved project preparatory technical assistance in November \n2006 to give definite form to the project components.3 As designed, the Project will continue \n(cid:31)F\nADB\u2019s support for and commitment to regional cooperation in ICT. \n2.  Cross-Border ICT Connectivity in the Subregion \n3.  The cross-border ICT network in the subregion is fragmented and outdated. In many \ncommunities, affordable modern broadband services are not available although latent demand \nis  high.  All  four  SASEC  countries  are  technically  interconnected  through  fiber  optics  or \nmicrowave, but data communications are not direct and often go via third parties. This is \nbecause direct fiber-optic connections have insufficient capacity and regional exchange points \nand \u201cpeering\u201d arrangements4 are nonexistent. The result is massive deployment of expensive \n(cid:31)F\n                                                 \n1  The Program has been supported through ADB. 2000.

Before \ncountry  exchange  points  were  established,  even  traffic  within  a  country  was  exchanged \noverseas,  generally  through  Hong  Kong,  China,  and  sometimes  also  through  the  United \nStates.5 This network fragmentation has led to heavy overhead transit costs and ultimately to \n(cid:31)F\nhigh user cost, and limited the full use and expansion of ICT-enabled services in the SASEC \nsubregion. Because Internet traffic often goes via third parties, and overly relies on satellite \ntransmission, connections in landlocked countries like Bhutan and Nepal cost much higher and \nare of lower quality. On the other hand, Bangladesh, recently connected to major submarine \ncables, cannot yet use the full capacity available to it and can therefore provide extra capacity to \nits neighbors. India, experiencing rapid growth in ICT penetration driven by private operators, is \nalso increasingly supplying bandwidths to neighboring countries, but still does not fully meet the \nsubregion\u2019s needs for high-quality, affordable, and reliable broadband. Regionally integrated \nand high-quality broadband capacity would keep local traffic local and optimize the cost of \ninterconnection within the region, besides helping reduce the prices of ICT services to end users \nand boosting the growth in the use of ICT across borders.  \n3.  Rural ICT Development  \n4.  Commercially driven ICT development has left rural people behind and widened the \ndisparity  between  the  rural  and  urban  areas.  Rural  community  e-centers  (CECs)\u2014known \nvariously as information kiosks, e-kiosks, village knowledge centers, or tele-centers\u2014have been \ntested and have proved effective in addressing this issue. India\u2019s various rural CEC models and \nBangladesh\u2019s Grameen village phone are pioneering and innovative examples of the use of ICT \nfor rural poverty reduction. The CEC movement in India is now a national initiative, with the \nprospect of Internet connectivity in every village. Grameen Telecom in Bangladesh has become \na major mobile operator and has extended the application of its microfinance model to Internet \nvillage kiosks in rural areas. CECs have been tried out for some years in Nepal and more \nrecently  in  Bhutan,  but  these  experiments  have  yet  to  achieve  nationwide  scale,  under \ngovernment or private leadership. Several hundred CECs are operated in Bangladesh and \nNepal mostly by nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and the private sector, and a much \nsmaller number in Bhutan, mainly by government and development agencies. In India, CECs \nexist in the tens of thousands, driven by a mix of large enterprises, entrepreneurs, universities, \ngovernment, and NGOs.  \n5.  Since computers and Internet connectivity are still too expensive for private ownership \namong the poor unlike mobile phones, which are becoming more affordable, CECs\u2014shared \nfacilities\u2014are most useful in expanding rural ICT development. However, before CECs can \nbecome a mainstream means of communication, some challenges must first be dealt with: rural \nbroadband  connectivity,  local  content,  and  community  capacity,  as  well  as  consolidated \nassistance for all three. Efforts to engage rural communities at the core of CEC programs have \nalso  been  limited;  the  communities  are  considered  unilateral  beneficiaries  of  information \nservices, instead of interactive local knowledge producers. To overcome these challenges and \nachieve the proven potential of CECs, rural CEC programs should evolve into village networks, \nwherein connected groups of villages generate, accumulate, and exchange information through \nvillage hubs. The regional approach will enable the SASEC countries to enhance their efforts to \nbridge the digital divide by sharing their experiences and connecting rural communities with one \n                                                 \n5  Global exchange points and bandwidth markets are located in the East Coast of the United States (New York and \nWashington, DC); the West Coast of the United States (San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles); Europe \n(London and Amsterdam); and Asia (Hong Kong, China and Singapore). \n ", "  3\nanother and with the rest of the world, and ultimately accessing the vast source of information, \ncontent, and services. \n4.  Human Resources Development in ICT \n6.  The need for more and higher-quality training in ICT has been expressed by all the \nSASEC countries including India, where ICT industry development has created millions of jobs \nover the past decades. They recognize the relationship between good-quality tertiary teaching \nand research, on the one hand, and staff retention, the brain drain, and ultimate industry \ndevelopment, on the other. The ICT education provided at present at most institutions in the \nsubregion is mediocre. Except in certain public and private institutions of excellence, many ICT \ntraining initiatives do not meet international quality standards. While India has trained a large \npool of skilled human resources in the ICT sector in the past few decades, it must upgrade their \nquality.  Other  SASEC  countries  are  seriously  constrained  in  mobilizing  qualified  human \nresources  for  ICT.  Bhutan,  for  example,  has  only  two  higher  institutions  for  ICT \nteaching/learning, Nepal has more than 30, and Bangladesh has more than 100, compared with \nIndia\u2019s thousands. The number of ICT professionals including the unqualified ranges from less \nthan 400 (0.05% of the population) in Bhutan to more than 1 million in India (0.09%); Nepal has \n6,000  (0.02%)  and  Bangladesh,  20,000  (0.01%).  A  regional  approach  to  building  human \ncapacity through shared resources and improved national training and development support \nwould enable the SASEC countries to capitalize on the opportunities in ICT. \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  ICT and Economic Growth \n7.  Global communities and their economic activities, including regional and international \ntrade, are increasingly being integrated through electronic means and technologies. ICT is \nfundamentally transforming the way we live, learn, and work, and it is crucial for inclusive growth \nthat the benefits of ICT be shared by all. International experience reveals that ICT can be a key \nenabler  for  improving  efficiency  and  productivity,  creating  new  business  opportunities,  and \nenhancing competitiveness. ICT is thus as essential for economic growth as road and rail \nnetworks, and telephone and power systems.6 The quality and usefulness of ICT infrastructure \n(cid:31)F\ntherefore determines the efficiency of the economy and the potential for economic growth of the \nSASEC countries individually and as a group. \n8.  The SASEC countries acknowledge ICT to be a significant means for economic growth \nand have developed significant strategic policies consistent with established planning for ICT \nespecially in relation to infrastructure, e-government, e-education, e-commerce, training and \nskills development, and ICT industry development. However, according to the ICT index (2004) \nof the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD),7 measured by levels \n(cid:31)F\nof ICT access, connectivity, and uptake, the overall ICT performance of the SASEC countries is \nlow, although the dynamics of ICT development in each country are different. India led the \nSASEC countries, ranking 142nd, Bangladesh ranked 171st; Bhutan, 156th; and Nepal, 167th. \nThese standings are partially attributable to the limited connectivity nationwide, although the \neffect of privatization and competition in mobile telephony in all SASEC countries has recently \ngrown rapidly in tele-density. A detailed sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n                                                 \n6  ADB\u2019s independent Eminent Persons Group report (2007) urges ADB to add ICT-related infrastructure (such as \nfiber-optic cable networks and data banks) to its current definition of infrastructure. \n7 United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. 2005. Information Economy Report 2005. New York. \n ", "4   \n  2.  ICT and Poverty Reduction  \n9.  The  ICT  significantly  contributes  to  poverty  reduction.  Chronic  impoverishment \nparticularly  in  rural  areas,  is  often  related  to  limited  access  to  markets,  employment \nopportunities, information, and access to public services as well as learning opportunities. Not \nonly do farmers lack information but the limited information that\u2019s available is often rudimentary \nand outdated. For example, most farmers in South Asia still rely on information reflecting \nfarming practices which are decades-old. More recent advances in farming, livestock, fisheries, \nand forestry technologies are not readily available to them even if they are available at the \nnational  level  for  lack  of  efficient  information  technology-based  delivery  systems.  Rural \ncommunities remain substantially outside the reach of the enormous potential of ICT to improve \nthe rural economy and well-being. Information is a powerful tool for strengthening social capital, \nmost importantly, empowerment and participation, which are well recognized as a critical \u201csoft\u201d \ndriver of socio-economic development and cultural change. Rural children have greater difficulty \nattending  school,  and  when  they  do,  they  stay  for  shorter  periods  and  leave  with  fewer \nqualifications, thus restricting their ability to further their skills, productivity, and income. The \nreach of public services, both health and education, is severely restricted due to limited ICT \ninfrastructure, innovative program designs, and delivery systems. \n10.  The absence of services, remote physical conditions, and poor transport system leave \nrural  people  more  marginalized.  ICT  holds  great  potential  to  address  these  challenges \neffectively  and  improve  the  wellbeing  of  poor  people  by  enabling  them  to  access  \n(i) information about markets; prices and business opportunities, (ii) employment; information on \nemployment and enterprise development, (iii) skills and education; delivery of both formal and \ninformal  e-learning,  (iv)  health  care;  innovative  mechanisms  for  delivering  health  care  and \ninformation, (v) government services; e-government for increased efficiency and transparency of \npublic services, and (vi) empowerment; improved communications and channels for grievances. \nA number of new and innovative projects applying ICT to meet the needs of the poor have \nshown significant impacts on poverty reduction as shown in the box, which can be both direct \nand indirect.  \n11.  Since 1990, the SASEC subregion has experienced rapid GDP growth, averaging 5.3 \npercent a year, contributing to significant poverty reduction. Most SASEC countries are on track \nto achieve the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target for poverty reduction. However, they \nare off-track on the MDG targets for social development. Overall social development in SASEC \ncountries is still marked by social inequalities and income disparities mapped on caste, religion, \ntribal and ethnicity dimensions. Therefore, providing equal and better opportunities to achieve \nmore inclusive growth is essential to achieve progress in all the MDGs in the SASEC countries. \nICT is recognized as a strategic means by all SASEC countries to promote not only faster but \nmore extensive inclusive growth in a region which remains one of the least developed in the \nworld. \nExamples of ICT for Poverty Reduction \nGrameen Village Phones, Bangladesh. The village phone program was initiated in 1997 by Grameen \nTelecom in cooperation with Grameen Bank. It works as an owner-operated pay phone supported by \nloans from Grameen Bank. The revenue growth has been very rapid \u2013from Tk 0.53 million in 1997 to \nTk2,070 million in 2003. The village phones now provide access to more than 60 million rural people. \nThis has not only provided the rural poor with new exciting income-generating opportunities, but also \ngiven them unprecedented access to critical economic and other information and helped enhance the \nsocial status and empowerment of women from poor rural households. \n ", "  5\nWireless Networking Project, Nepal. The project connected 14 villages in remote mountainous areas \nwith Pokhara through wireless network since 2003 and expanded services including telemedicine, \ndistance education, and telephone service, which enabled the rural communities to access public \nservices at large cost savings and in a timely manner. Mahabir Pun, the team leader of the project has \nbeen  awarded  the  Ramon  Magsaysay  Award  2007  for  Community  Leadership  by  the  Ramon \nMagsaysay Foundation in Manila for this innovative \u201chome-grown\u201d project based on the needs of the \nrural communities. \nAkshaya and Mallappuram Districts (Kerala), India. It is a joint project between local bodies (gram \npanchayats) in rural areas and municipalities in urban areas and private entrepreneurs in Mallappuram \ndistrict of Kerala initiated in 2001. The objective is to \u201cbridge the digital divide\u201d by providing community \naccess to computers and the Internet. About 565 community technology centers have been established \nin the district. Akshaya operates public-private partnerships in establishing the community technology \ncenter in remote villages. \nBhoomi  Project,  Bangalore  (Karnataka),  India. The Department of Revenue of Karnataka has \ncomputerized 20 million land ownership records of 6.7 million farmers in the state. Each record is \navailable online from 177 taluka kiosks at a cost of Rs15 per record. The project has been widely \nacclaimed as possibly the most successful ICT project for land records in the country. \nE-Choupal, Ujjain (Madhya Pradesh), India. This web-based initiative of Indian Tobacco Company\u2019s \ninternational Business Division in Central India provides soya growers with information, products, and \nservices they need in soya farming. The kiosks facilitate the supply of high-quality farm inputs and \npurchases of soya at the doorsteps of the villagers. This project started in 42 villages of Ujjain district, \nwith around 1,800 kiosks in Madhya Pradesh, and now has around 3,300 kiosks in Central India. The \nkiosks also handle dealerships for various commodities such as cycles and tractors. This feature has \nalso minimized the travel expenses of the villagers. \nTarahaat.com, Jhansi (Uttar Pradesh), India. Development Alternatives (with the help of 12 project \npartners) started the project in four districts of North India as a business model to cater to the unserved \nrural markets. The project provides services like Tarabazaar (e-bazaar), Taravan (mobile kiosks), \nTaraguru (e-education), Taradhaba (cyber caf\u00e9), Tarareporter (news), Taradak (e-mail), Taravendor \n(e-commerce), and Taracard (e-greetings). Franchisee kiosks are provided with connectivity through \nC-band satellite, VSAT, or dial-up modem, according to the infrastructure available.  \nMobile Remittance Service, Philippines. The mobile remittance services introduced by Philippine \noperators in recent years have proven highly successful for all parties concerned: the operators are \ntaking commissions on cash transfers upwards of $100 million per day, while expatriate Filipino \nworkers are sending money home to their families faster, more cheaply, and more securely than \npreviously possible. This is known as a good business development case for other mobile operators \nand development agencies to benchmark.  \nICT = information communication technology, Rs = rupees, Tk = taka, VSAT = very small aperture terminal. \nSources: United Nations Development Programme. 2006.

ICT and Regional Cooperation \n12.  In  the  SASEC  context,  a  cross-border  terrestrial  ICT  network,  aided  by  regional \nexchange  points,  peering  arrangements,  and  a  competitive  access  regime,  is  essential  to \nregional ICT cooperation. The idea behind building such a regional network is to keep local \ntraffic local, and thus optimize the cost of interconnection within the region. It is economically \ncritical that the region have sufficient and efficient connectivity to allow for growth in the use of \nICT. In this regard, the SASEC regional network would contribute to reducing user costs across \n ", "6   \nborders, facilitate ICT-enabled business development, and increase the quality of service by \neffectively  managing  real-time  traffic  data,  congestion,  interoperability,  peering,  and \nredundancy, while facilitating data traffic trades across borders. The plan of action developed by \nthe World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) recommends that efforts be made to \nreduce the international Internet costs charged by backbone providers by developing regional \nICT  backbones  and  Internet  exchange  points,  thereby  reducing  interconnection  cost  and \nextending network access. \n13.  Such a SASEC regional network would enable SASEC countries to take a SASEC \nregional approach to the communities and establish regional connections between the village \nnetworks of the individual countries, thereby delivering local solutions not only within connected \ncommunities  in  one  country  but  also  in  communities  in  other  SASEC  countries  that  are \nconnected to the regional network. Local networking and local information sourcing from within \nrural communities would be a powerful driver for ICT use in the rural context. For example, \ninformation sought by one village contact would be provided to every relevant village in the \nblock, district, state, country, or region. Through this network, every village would be a \u201cpeer\u201d to \nother villages and could learn what all other rural communities are learning and experiencing \ndaily. The principal sources of information, news, opinion, and discussion within the network \nshould be the villages themselves, through the experiences of their own peers.  \n4.  ADB Regional Cooperation Strategy  \n14.  ADB\u2019s South Asia Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program (RCSP) for 2006\u20132008 \nsets  out  five  key  operational  objectives:  to  improve  connectivity,  to  facilitate  trade  and \ninvestment, to develop regional tourism, to facilitate cooperation in energy, and to promote \nprivate sector cooperation. Improving transport and communications connectivity is expected to \nreduce transportation and communication costs, increase South Asia\u2019s competitiveness, and \nfacilitate  the  movement  of  goods  and  people,  thereby  promoting  economic  and  social \ndevelopment. To this end, the RCSP strongly supports the connectivity enhancement of key \nmodes of transport and communications. Also according to the RCSP, ADB experience shows \nthat improvements in connectivity are critical to progress in other areas, such as trade and \ninvestment, and tourism. ICT being basic infrastructure for electronic services and transactions, \nthe Project can be expected to contribute to promoting synergies with other regional cooperation \nactivities in trade and tourism development. \n5.  Lessons Learned  \n15.  A  key  challenge  for  the  Project  is  scaling  up  and  replicating  successful  ICT \nmethodologies  and  mechanisms  developed  locally,  to  foster  local  innovative  and \nentrepreneurship.  The  following  essentials  of  creating  an  enabling  environment  for \ncommunity-driven networks have been identified and incorporated into the project design:  \n(i)  a  national  policy  that  acknowledges  community  ownership  and  supports  the \ncreation of an environment toward that end;  \n(ii)  a regulatory environment that allows the deployment of the most appropriate and \ncost-effective  technologies  with  minimum  hindrance,  and  that  governs \ninteractions with others (e.g., for interconnection) in a manner that promotes \nnetwork growth in poor rural communities and recognizes their value;  \n ", "  7\n(iii)  innovative measures to support financing and investment, both local and external, \nin  cooperatives  and  community-driven  networks,  recognizing  the  social  and \ndevelopment value of these ventures to the communities, as well as their lack of \nappeal to private investors; and  \n(iv)  positive actions to build the capacity of communities to initiate their own network \nand service enterprises and to maintain and expand them, and to encourage and \nenable  strong  pro-poor  community-driven  governance  of  other  networks  and \nservices provided in their areas. \n6.  Policy Dialogue \n16.  Policy  dialogue  will  be  continued  under  the  SASEC  ICTWG  platform,  focused  on \nensuring the sustainability of the Project and keeping a primary focus on ICT in the context of \nthe MDG achievements in the following areas:  \n(i)  Technology neutrality in service provision and regulation framework. The \ndistinction between voice and data, while disappearing in technology, retains a \nstrong policy influence in the region and separates what is technically possible \nfrom what is accepted in practice. Therefore, policy dialogue will be continued, to \nincrease technology neutrality for the maximum use of the regional network and \navailable technologies. \n(ii)  ICT-enabled  regional  applications  and  services.  Enhanced  connectivity \nbetween  the  SASEC  countries  should  strengthen  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration  through  public  and  economic  service  applications,  village \ndevelopment, and ICT commerce and industry. Policy dialogue will be carried out \non the use of the regional network to serve the needs of rural communities, \nbusiness, and research and training institutes across borders. \n(iii)  Human resource development in ICT. Various levels of human resource are \nrequired to engage in ICT research and development, to manage regulatory \nregimes that maximize the community and economic benefits of ICT, and to \ndesign  new  service  applications  to  engage  with  rural  communities.  Policy \ndialogue will pursue regional cooperation in human resource development and \nexpanded local innovations throughout the region. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n17.  The Project is aimed at enhancing the benefits of ICT and regional cooperation for \ninclusive growth and poverty reduction by increasing the supply of affordable broadband, skilled \nICT manpower, and local content and e-applications, with a special focus on the needs of the \npoor. It is also expected to help SASEC countries improve their productivity and efficiency and \nparticipate more fully in the global information economy. To this end, the Project will establish \n(i) a SASEC regional network with fiber-optic and data interchange capacity, directly connecting \nthe four SASEC countries; (ii) a SASEC village network expanding broadband ICT access to \n110 rural communities in the SASEC countries and providing direct connections among the \ncommunities for local networking and local information sourcing; and (iii) a SASEC research and \ntraining network to build technical and business skills in developing local ICT content and \n ", "8   \ne-applications (e-government, e-learning, tele-medicine, e-remittance, e-commerce, etc.) that \nserve the needs of the poor in particular. \nB.  Outputs \n1.  SASEC Regional Network  \n18.  The SASEC regional network will consist of (i) the extensive existing broadband network \nowned by telecom service providers in each country, to be interconnected under the Project; \n(ii) a new fiber-optic network to be built in Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal; and (iii) four access \ngateways at specific sites in each country, linked to the border township within each country for \nconnectivity to the other countries. The SASAEC regional network will be designed to (i) provide \na scalable data-peering network among SASEC member countries, (ii) provide SASEC member \ncountries  with  access  to  good-quality  landed-port  Internet  access  from  both  India  and \nBangladesh, (iii) provide cross-border data-peering access to reduce expensive international \ntransit peering, (iv) help generate traffic flows and applications throughout the region as well as \nin-country, (v) make broadband services more accessible to rural and remote communities via \nwireless connectivity to CECs, and (vi) maximize the use of existing infrastructure in each \ncountry to minimize investment costs.  \na.  Fiber-Optic Network \n19.  In Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board and the Power Grid \nCompany of Bangladesh Ltd.\u2014both has fiber-optic cables to the northern town of Panchagarh. \nBut no fiber-optic cables are available from Panchagarh to the border point of Banglabandha, \nthrough which the SASAEC regional network will be connected to the identified Indian location \nof Fulbari. A new fiber-optic cable of about 55 kilometers (km) will therefore be laid from \nPanchagarh to Banglabandha in Bangladesh. In Bhutan, Bhutan Telecom Ltd. has a fiber-optic \nlink  from  Thimpu  to  Phuentsholing  via  the  transmission  network  grid  of  Bhutan  Power \nCorporation Ltd. A 140 km alternative fiber-optic route from Thimpu to Phuentsholing via a \nsecond power transmission route of the Bhutan Power Corporation Ltd. will provide a redundant \n(self-healing ring) national network from Thimphu to Phuentsholing.  \n20.  In India, two carriers\u2014Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and Reliance Communications\u2014\nhave international long-distance licenses to permit cross-border access. Bharat Sanchar Nigam \nLimited is the incumbent carrier and has most of the required links to the SASEC neighbors. No \nnew investment in a fiber-optic network is required in India. In Nepal, Nepal Telecom has a \nfiber-optic link from Hetauda to Biratnagar via underground ducts (pipes) and manholes. A 433 \nkm alternative fiber-optic route from Hetauda to Biratnagar via the Nepal Electrical Authority \ntransmission  power  grid  network  will  be  laid  under  the  Project  to  provide  a  redundant \n(self-healing ring) national network from Hetauda to the town of Biratnagar. \nb.  Access Gateways and Border-Connectivity Townships \n21.  Dhaka in Bangladesh, Thimpu in Bhutan, Shiliguri in India, and Kathmandu in Nepal \nhave been selected as country access gateways under criteria specifically drawn up to optimize \nthe functionality, cost, security, and marketability of the SASEC regional network. The criteria \nare (i) existing co-locations; (ii) potential for building access to other operators; (iii) security of \naccess; (iv) availability of power and backup, air conditioning, rack space, and sufficient space \nfor future expansion; and (iv) resilience to flooding and earthquake. A gateway core router and \nmanagement devices and software will be installed in each access gateway. \n ", "  9\n22.  The border-connectivity townships are effective strategic cable landing points in each \nSASEC  country.  The  border  town  or  junction  location  becomes  a  focus  for  improving \nconnectivity and developing further capacity that can (i) be carried to the in-country access \ngateway, (ii) provide further benefits to the cross-border town, and (iii) provide strategic national \ncable routes and valuable rural connection drop-off points along the link between the border \ntown  and  the  access  gateway.  These  seven  border-connectivity  townships  were  selected: \n(i) Pancharghar in Bangladesh; (ii) Phuentsholing in Bhutan; (iii) Shiliguri, Jogbani, Fulbari, and \nJaigaon in India; and (iv) Biratnagar in Nepal. Border core routers and equipment will be \ninstalled in the three landing stations of Pancharghar, Phuentsholing, and Biratnagar. \n2.  SASEC Village Network  \n23.  The village network requires a central hub supported by an information exchange that \nconstantly  collects, standardizes,  and  redistributes  traffic generating  community  information \nfrom all participating villages across the country through a village intranet. A SASEC village \nnetwork will be established under the Project. Five to six hub CECs will be built in each SASEC \ncountry, and five spoke CECs branching from each hub will be connected to the SASEC \nregional network. This will enable local networking and local information sourcing from within \nrural communities across borders and thereby drive rapid ICT uptake by the rural communities. \nAlso, the exact local needs and opportunities for ICT use in various information services can be \nidentified and fed to the management of the SASEC regional network. The component will \nsupport (i) the establishment of a rural wireless broadband network; (ii) the development of a \nportal  service  (voice,  chatting,  video  conferencing,  e-mail,  community  bulletin,  etc.)  and  a \nknowledge database management system; and (iii) the establishment of 110 CECs in the four \nSASEC countries, linked to the SASEC regional network. \n24.  The SASEC village network will enable CECs in the villages to become access points for \ninteraction with the SASEC regional network, and thereby enable the CECs themselves to \noperate as hubs for other CECs in the local area. Villages, once connected to the SASEC \nvillage  network,  will  be  able  to  generate  and  maintain  information  that  SASEC  rural \ncommunities, via CECs, can interact with and add to, using the SASEC regional network as the \ndelivery mechanism. The SASEC portal will improve access to local content and information \nthrough the use of multimedia, and facilitate indigenous knowledge management within and \namong the communities.  \n3.  SASEC Research and Training Network \n25.  The SASEC research and training network will promote regional knowledge sharing and \ninnovation  by  building  human  resource  capacity  and  supporting  local  ICT  start-ups.  The \nresearch and training network will therefore serve as a SASEC regional ICT knowledge network \nproviding teaching, research, and professional development support for local innovation and \nentrepreneurship. Local entrepreneurs, aided by the research training network, will create local \ncontent  for  regional  e-business  and  e-services  (for  example,  tele-medicine,  e-learning, \ne-remittance, e-commerce) to be delivered over the SASEC regional network and the SASEC \nvillage network. To this end, the Project will establish a research and training center in a \nselected ICT research institute in each of the SASEC countries by providing (i) connectivity to \nthe SASEC regional network, (ii) support for faculty mobilization and space rental, and (iii) ICT \ndevelopment support. The research and training centers will (i) develop and conduct research \nand training in e-business development and ICT professional development, for service delivery \nto the rural communities through the SASEC village network and CECs; and (ii) develop open \n ", "10  \ncontent and training programs in ICT professional development. This research and training \nnetwork will be financed separately by the TA attached to the Project (see paras. 49\u201352). \nC.  ADF IX Grant Component \n26.  Bhutan and Nepal were among the poorest countries identified as eligible for Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) grants in the ADF IX resolution.8 In view of the considerable social \n(cid:31)F\ndevelopment impact of the Project and the tight fiscal situation of the governments of the two \ncountries, the project components for Bhutan and Nepal should be eligible for 100% grant \nfinancing as prescribed in the draft Board policy paper titled \u201cRevising the Framework for Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grants.\u201d  \nD.  Special Features \n27.  The Project is designed to encourage the maximum participation of the private sector \nand to promote public-private partnership in the operation of the SASEC networks (regional \nnetwork, village network, and research and training network) to achieve social, economic, and \nfinancial sustainability. For this purpose, various agreements setting the terms and conditions of \nthe network operations will be designed to ensure (i) the use of the existing cross-border \ninfrastructure,  and  (ii)  the  establishment  of  a  framework  and  cash  flows  between  network \noperations and social programs. \n28.  The Project is also designed to maximize synergy and complementarities among the \nthree components\u2014regional network, village network, and research and training network\u2014by \ninterconnecting  the  functions  and  requirements  of  these  network  operations.  The  SASEC \nregional network will provide direct connectivity within SASEC rural communities and between \nthese  communities  and  SASEC  research  and  training  centers.  The  SASEC  research  and \ntraining network will provide training programs and development support on the basis of the \nneeds of rural communities and entrepreneurs identified through the SASEC village network. \nThis arrangement enables direct communications between end users and service providers and \nthereby  encourages  community-based  or  community-driven  innovations,  leading  to  the \ndevelopment of local content and e-applications that are more relevant to the needs of the poor \nin rural areas.  \nE.

Financing Plan \n30.  It is proposed that ADB provide grants of $4.7 million for Bhutan and $9.0 million for \nNepal, and a loan of $3.1 million for Bangladesh from its Special Funds resources, to finance \n70% of the project cost. The governments of the SASEC countries will finance $7.2 million, or \n30%.  The  governments  of  Bhutan  and  Nepal  will  finance  only  the  taxes  and  duties  and \ncontingencies, while the Government of Bangladesh will finance some part of the base cost as \nwell. All the SASEC governments have expressed their capacity and willingness to provide the \nrequired counterpart financing. The ADF loan to Bangladesh will be denominated in special \ndrawing rights, and will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an \ninterest rate of 1% per year during the grace period, and 1.5% after that.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Establishment and Operation of Networks \na.  SASEC Regional Network \n31.  The SASEC regional network will be built by connecting existing broadband networks \nowned by current telecom service providers in each country. All SASEC countries will select a \nservice agency from eligible telecom service providers in each country to provide the necessary \nfiber-optic network and be responsible for operating the SASEC regional network jointly with the \nservice agencies in the other SASEC countries. India will select its service agency on the basis \nof the availability of (i) an international long-distance license to carry traffic to and from other \ncountries (carriers with national long-distance licenses and adequate infrastructure for cross-\nborder traffic could form a consortium with the international long-distance license holder to \nqualify), (ii) a fiber-optic network that satisfies SASEC regional network design specifications \nand that can be upgraded with the least amount of capital expenditure, (iii) reliable access and \nexpandable capacity to the SASEC border locations from Shiliguri, (iv) reliable access and \nhaulage to Internet capacity at landing stations from Mumbai and Chennai, (v) right-of-way, and \n(vi) support for next-generation network technology.  \n32.  The three other SASEC countries will select their own service agencies on the basis of \nthe  availability  of  (i)  a  national  fiber-optic  network  with  reliable  and  expandable  capacity, \n(ii) right-of-way, (iii) a fiber-optic route that favors the location of wireless sites to link rural CEC \nnetworks, and (iv) support for next-generation network technology. Service agencies will be \nselected through open tender (for countries with more than two eligible candidates) or closed \ntender (for countries with no more than two eligible candidates). Each tender will be based on \ntechnical and financial capability to deliver the desired solution within a country\u2019s borders and \nacross the borders of other countries.  \n33.  The  organizational  operational  structure  of  the  SASEC  regional  network  will  be \nestablished by three layers of multilateral and bilateral agreements among and between SASEC \ncountries.  The  multilateral  cooperation  network  agreement,  which  will  be  signed  by  the \nexecuting agencies (EAs) in all SASEC countries, will set the overall framework and guidelines \nfor the operation of the SASEC regional network. The service agency agreement will be made \nbetween the EA and the service agency in each country, and will set out the details of the \npublic-private partnership arrangements by setting the terms and conditions for the service \nagency to build, keep, manage, and operate the network and equipment as designed, built, and \ninstalled under the Project and serve the requirements of the SASEC regional network.9  The \n(cid:31)F\nrole of the EA, i.e., the public sector, will be limited to supervising the service agencies, which \nwill have a key role in jointly operating and maintaining the regional network through bilateral \ninterconnection  agreements.  The  bilateral  interconnection  agreement,  which  will  be  made \nbetween  service  agencies  of  two  countries,  will  set  the  terms  and  conditions  for  the \ninterconnection  of,  and  the  exchange  of  digital  traffic  between,  the  countries\u2019  in-country \nnetworks including technical specifications of networks and maintenance, and spell out the \nmechanism for revenue and cost sharing. Six bilateral network agreements will be signed \namong the four SASEC countries. \n                                                 \n9  The agreement will include a clause that requires the selected service agencies to contribute a certain portion of \ntheir revenue accrued from the SASEC regional network to support the financial sustainability of the SASEC village \nnetwork and the SASEC research and training network. \n ", "  13\nb.  SASEC Village Network \n34.  The operation of the SASEC village network and CECs will be franchised to private \nentrepreneurs such as rural Internet service providers (ISPs) or NGOs that were involved in \nsimilar CEC operations. The village network and operation might be franchised through auction, \nlease, or other appropriate means; auction is the widely adopted means, to ensure both the \nfinancial sustainability of the village network and the CECs and the social responsibility of the \nfranchisees. The potential service agencies, in the course of bidding, might indicate the need for \nfinancial support in case the CECs they bid for are assessed to be financially unviable. The EA \nwill select a service agency that has offered the highest price or the lowest financial support for \nthe operation of a package of CECs and the village network. If the EA should pay for financial \nsupport as a result of a bid, it would be financed by the resource pool that would be established \nfrom the contributions of the service agencies of the SASEC regional network. The agreement \nfor village network operation between the EA and a selected service agency will prescribe the \nsocial responsibility of the franchisees by specifying the minimum services to be provided to the \ncommunities, particularly the poor and the women, and the need for financial assistance from \nthe EA to ensure the financial sustainability of the CEC operation. This social responsibility \nmodel is based on best practices tested and now being used more widely in India. \nc.  SASEC Research and Training Network \n35.  The service agencies in the four countries will be selected from capable potential ICT \nresearch institutes including universities and will act as focal implementing agencies of the \nnetwork. The selected service agencies will be provided with connectivity to the SASEC regional \nnetwork and the necessary equipment, and will be required to provide regional research and \ntraining services as prescribed in the service agency agreement, making use of their own \nexpertise  and  human  resources,  and  assistance  provided  to  them  for  additional  faculty \ncompensation, space rental, content development training courses, and ICT development. The \nservice agencies will operate the research and training network by developing and conducting \nresearch and training programs in e-business development and ICT professional development, \nand by providing development support to small and medium ICT start-ups, through which the \nservice agencies will accrue financial revenues to ensure the financial sustainability of their \nnetwork operation.  \n2.  Project Management \n36.  The Ministry of Science and Information and Communication Technology of Bangladesh, \nthe  Ministry  of  Information  and  Communication  of  Bhutan,  the  Department  of  Information \nTechnology of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology of India, and the \nMinistry of Information and Communication of Nepal will be responsible for implementation of \nthe Project as its EAs. A steering committee, consisting of the secretaries of the EAs, will jointly \nsupervise and monitor overall project implementation. It will also provide overall guidance to the \nproject management units to be established under the EAs in coordinating joint activities, and \nclear the draft multilateral cooperation agreement, bilateral interconnection agreements, and \nservice agency agreement for the transfer of network and equipment and their operation, for \nsigning.  \n37.  A project management unit (PMU), headed by a project director (joint secretary) and with \na technical expert (project manager), an administrative staff, and a representative of each \nservice agency as members will be established under each EA. It will be responsible for the \nday-to-day  implementation  of  the  Project  in  coordination  with  the  project  management \n ", "14  \nconsultants. The PMU will (i) recruit the country project management consultants in consultation \nwith ADB; (ii) supervise and monitor the work of the country project management consultants; \n(iii) maintain the project accounts, endorse the invoices of the project management consultants, \nand prepare withdrawal requests for payment to contractors; (iv) prepare the statement of \nexpenditure for the replenishment of the imprest account, and prepare the yearly financial \nstatement for the project account and have it audited by an external auditor; and (v) report \nmonthly  on  the  progress  of  the  implementation  to  the  steering  committee  and  ADB.  The \nimplementation arrangement is in Appendix 4.  \n3.  Implementation Period \n38.  The Project will be implemented for 21 months, from April 2008 to December 2009. The \nproject implementation schedule is in Appendix 5.  \n4.  Procurement \n39.  Goods, services, and civil works to be financed under the ADB grant or loan will be \nprocured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nNetwork design and installation contracts will be procured according to the procurement plan \n(see Appendix 6).  \n5.  Consulting Services \n40.  Project management consultants will be hired to assist the EA in implementing the \nProject.  The  project  management  consultant  team  will  consist  of  (i)  an  international  team \ncomprising a team leader, a design engineer, and a procurement specialist; and (ii) four country \nteams. Each country team will have three subteams: a SASEC regional network team, a village \nnetwork/research and training network team, and a joint team. Each of the first two subteams \nwill  comprise  a  team  leader,  a  design  engineer,  a  procurement  specialist,  and  a  network \nengineer.  The  joint  team  will  consist  of  a  social  development  specialist,  an  environment \nspecialist, and a quality assurance specialist. A firm of international consultants will be hired for \n36 person-months, and a firm of national consultants, for 100 person-months in Bangladesh, \nBhutan, and Nepal, and for 63 person-months in India. The project management consultants will \n(i) design all networks to be procured under the Project; (ii) prepare bid documents; (iii) assist \nthe  PMU  in  tendering  (prequalification,  evaluation  of  proposals,  etc);  and  (iv)  supervise \ncontractors.  The outline terms of reference for the project management consultants are in \nAppendix 7.  \n41.  The project management consultants will be selected and hired according to ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  through \nquality- and cost-based selection (80:20) and simplified technical proposal. ADB will consider \napproving advance recruitment of consultants on the understanding that such action will not \nnecessarily commit ADB to financing the Project.  \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n42.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) has been explained to and \ndiscussed with the governments of the SASEC countries. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, \ndirectly  or  through  its  agents,  any  allegations  of  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \n ", "  15\nAnticorruption Policy will be included in the grant regulations and the bidding documents for the \nProject.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  for  the  Project  will  include  provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EAs and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. The \nGovernment will also allow ADB\u2019s representatives to carry out random spot checks on the work \nin progress and the use of funds for the Project, and assist them in doing so. \n43.  The SASEC ICTWG, a continuous ICT coordinating body composed of the secretaries of \nthe  ICT  ministries  in  the  SASEC  countries,  will  oversee  and  monitor  the  procurement  of \ncontractors and the selection of service agencies to ensure transparency and good governance. \nThe country representatives will be required to present at a SASEC ICTWG meeting their \ntendering processes for the procurement of contractors and the selection of service agencies \nincluding the criteria for prequalification and tender evaluation. While examining the tender \nprocesses  of  each  country,  the  SASEC  ICTWG  may  propose  supplementary  and \ncomplementary measures to enhance transparency and good governance.  \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n44.  Grant  and  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007). Statement-of-expenditure procedures will be used in reimbursing eligible \nexpenditures.   \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n45.  Each EA will maintain separate accounts and records for the Project according to sound \naccounting principles, adequate to identify the goods and services financed from the grant \nproceeds, the financing resources, the expenditures incurred for the Project, and the use of \nlocal funds. These project accounts and related financial statements will be audited annually \naccording to sound auditing standards by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. The EAs will \nsubmit to ADB the audited project accounts no later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal \nyear. The annual audits will include an audit of the statement-of-expenditure records, and a \nseparate opinion on the audit. The Government has been advised of ADB\u2019s requirement of \ntimely submission of audited project accounts and financial statements, and the suspension of \ndisbursements of the proposed ADB grant or loan if the requirement is not complied with. \n46.  Each EA will submit quarterly progress reports to allow performance to be monitored, \nissues to be resolved, and periodic action plans to be prepared. The quarterly reports will serve \nas  feedback  for  updating  and  improving  procedures  and  project  implementation.  Within \n3 months of the physical completion of the Project, each EA will submit a project completion \nreport on the overall impact of the Project. \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n47.  The EAs will be responsible for overall project monitoring. The PMUs will establish a \nsystem for preparing monthly progress reports for performance monitoring and issue resolution, \nplus periodic action planning. The EAs will monitor the quantitative and qualitative performance \nof each project component and evaluate the delivery of the planned facilities and the project \nbenefits accrued. With the help of the project management consultants, each EA will develop, \nno  later  than  3  months  after  the  loan  or  grant  takes  effect,  a  comprehensive  system  for \nmonitoring the Project\u2019s performance. ADB will review and approve this system. ADB and the \n ", "16  \nEAs will agree on the performance parameters to be monitored during the implementation of the \nProject and for 3 months after project completion. \n10.  Project Review \n48.  ADB staff will review project implementation through regular or special review missions. \nAccording to the project schedule, a midterm review will be carried out about 12 months after \nthe  start  of  the  Project,  around  April  2009.  Before  the  midterm  review  each  of  the  four \ngovernments will submit to ADB a detailed progress report on the Project\u2019s implementation and \nachievements. The terms of reference for the midterm review will be included in the project \nadministration memorandum to be prepared by ADB\u2019s Inception Mission for the Project.  \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n49.  Infrastructure  provision  alone  will  not  serve  the  purpose  of  the  Project.  Without \nfacilitation  of  content,  services,  and  capacity,  such  infrastructure  will  quickly  become \nunsustainable. Therefore, the piggybacked TA is aimed at strengthening the functioning of the \ninfrastructure by building the related human capacity, not only in hard engineering technologies \nbut also in soft business management and development technologies required to operate, \nmanage, and use the SASEC regional network and the SASEC village network. The TA will also \ncontribute to reshaping the role of the ICT research institutes in knowledge development and \nICT-related capacity building for community and business development. It will generate regional \nand national e-businesses and services (public and private), in the course of the sustainable \nprovision  of  the  SASEC  information  highway  infrastructure.  It  will  also  support  local \nentrepreneurs  and  ICT  start-ups  in  facilitating  better  public  and  private  services  to  rural \ncommunities. In the long term, the TA, together with the improved connectivity through the \nmother  project,  will  contribute  to  inclusive  growth  by  empowering  those  who  have  been \nexcluded from the economic and social development activities of the countries. The design and \nmonitoring framework of the TA is in Appendix 8. \n50.  The  proposed  TA  will  develop  these  four  dimensions  of  the  SASEC  research  and \ntraining network: (i) incorporating regional and community priorities on, and need for, ICT skill \nand  business  development  into  the  core  activities  of  the  ICT  institutes;  (ii)  establishing \npartnerships, linkages, and interactions with the regional communities and businesses through \nthe  research  and  training  network;  (iii)  enhancing  the  subregional  knowledge  pool  and \nresources for the capacity development of ICT professionals and entrepreneurs for long-term \nsustainable  operation;  and  (iv)  promoting  research  and  development  on  e-business, \ne-applications, and e-services to be delivered through the SASEC regional network and the \nSASEC village network, for the greater benefit of the community and business creation.  \n51.  The  TA  will  assist  four  SASEC  research  and  training   centers  in  carrying  out  the \nfollowing activities for ICT skill and business development: (i) providing research and training \nprograms for in-country and regional needs, wherever possible; (ii) allocating an appropriate \nproportion  of  the  institutes\u2019  research  to  ICT-related  subjects  that  are  relevant  to  regional \npriorities and address contemporary issues with a direct impact on the communities they serve; \n(iii)  taking  leadership  in  a  range  of  interactions  with  the  communities  through  ICT-related \nconsulting and professional services; (iv) maintaining connections with other bodies throughout \nthe  SASEC  region  that  are  relevant  to  the  centers\u2019  vision  and  mission  in  regional  and \ncommunity ICT research and training interaction; (v) promoting the use of institute facilities \namong the general community and businesses; (vi) using a distinctly capable ICT infrastructure \nand  associated  environment  for  promoting  knowledge-based  development  via  the \n ", "  17\ninterconnection with the SASEC regional network and back-to-back interconnection with CECs; \n(vii) collaborating with other ICT research institutes and training providers in the region that are \ninterested  in  ICT-related  services,  to  accrue  mutual  benefits;  (viii)  creating  a  centralized \ninformation  and  database  that  integrates  all  CECs  under  the  Project  as  a  focal  point  for \ninformation dissemination throughout the region; and (ix) using the SASEC regional network as \na primary connectivity gateway for delivering services to the wider community and industry. \n52.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $4.4 million, to be financed on a grant basis from \nADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund. The cost estimates and financing plan for \nthe TA are in Appendix 9. The project management consultants to be hired for the Project will \ndesign the research and training network for connectivity to the SASEC regional network and \nselected  ICT  research  institute  in  each  country;  procurement  will  be  according  to  the \nprocurement  plan  (see  Appendix  6).  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  45  months,  from \nApril 2008 to December 2011. \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Poverty and Social Development Impact \n53.  Poverty is often found significantly related to a lack of knowledge and information; ICT \ncan improve effective access to such knowledge and information. Rural poverty rates in the \nSASEC countries range from 20% to 42%: 20% in India; 35%, Nepal; 40%, Bangladesh; 42%, \nBhutan. More than two thirds of the rural population in the countries subsists on agriculture \n(including livestock) and forestry. Rural farmers rely on rudimentary and outdated information \nabout farming practices and have limited opportunities to market their agricultural products. The \nProject will contribute to addressing such challenges by improving rural ICT connectivity and \nhuman capacity to use the vast information and knowledge resources and e-services related to \nagriculture, market, employment, health care, education, and government services that are \navailable on the Internet. The Project will also enable the integration of rural communities for \nlocal networking and local information sourcing. Rural people will thus have better opportunities \nto create and use local knowledge for improved empowerment and livelihood. A summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \nB.  Environment and Social Safeguards \n54.  The  Project  involves  the  identification  of  co-location  facilities,  in-country  and  cross-\nborder links, and village network locations. Its design is based on the use of the existing \ntelecommunication  infrastructure  in  each  country.  The  co-location  sites  (network  access \ngateways), one in each country, will be identified on the basis of the availability of requisite \nspace, facilities, and connectivity to in-country links. The in-country and cross-border links \nidentified  will  have  requisite  connectivity  between  the  access  gateway  and  the \nborder-connectivity townships, right-of-way, and access to the links. The border-connectivity \ntownships  will  also  have  connectivity  to  India\u2019s  border  township,  either  through  existing \ninfrastructure or a new facility established without causing significant environmental impact. The \nidentification of the CECs will consider the availability of space and the requisite facilities. \nPhysical interventions for the project components will therefore be limited. As such, the Project \nis classified as category C according to ADB\u2019s environmental impact assessment requirements \n(2003).  Environmental  impact  was  nonetheless  assessed  through  the  environmental \nassessment approach to ensure that the Project will have no significant environmental impact \n(the summary report on this assessment is in Appendix 11).  \n ", "18  \n55.  The development of CECs and cross-border links between India and Bangladesh is the \nonly project activity that is likely to generate (very minor) disturbance. However, some impact \nduring  operation,  especially  associated  with  the  disposal  of  office  and  e-waste,  which  is \nrecyclable,  and  domestic  sewage,  which  can  be  fully  treated,  is  also  foreseen.  The \nimplementation of the mitigation measures provided in the environment management plan will \nminimize  the  predicted  disturbance  during  design  and  development  and  during  operation. \nDeveloping the CECs, setting up wireless connectivity poles, and developing cross-border links \nbetween Bangladesh and India may require cutting a few trees, obtaining access, or acquiring \nas well as clearing additional land along the road. Although the development of CECs and \nwireless connectivity was not found to involve any forest areas or protected forest, any required \nfelling of trees or diversion of forestland will be carried out only with and in line with the \nenvironmental protection laws of the country concerned. \n56.  By using the existing infrastructure the Project will avoid any private land acquisition and \nresettlement. CECs will be established in existing village administration buildings. Similarly, the \nstructure for the data center will be built on government land within the premises of the ISPs; \nand the fiber-optic cables will be laid along existing power transmission lines or telecom lines or \non government land. No adverse impact on private properties or communities in the region, \nincluding indigenous peoples, is envisaged.  \nC.  Economic Analysis \n57.  The economic analysis of the Project conformed to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic \nAnalysis of Projects. To estimate the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project, the \nproject  case  was  compared  with  a  base  case  involving  the  continued  use  of  satellite \ntransmission.  The  regional  network  will  connect  the  cable  landing  stations  (CLSs) 10 in \n(cid:31)F\nBangladesh and India to an access gateway, and then distribute Internet capacity to Nepal and \nBhutan via terrestrial links. The economic benefits include: (i) savings accruing to Nepal and \nBhutan on the cost of connecting to Internet service as a result of the installation of the SASEC \nregional network, and (ii) incremental revenues to be earned by India and Bangladesh from \npayments by Nepal and Bhutan for the CLS connection. Other economic indirect benefits over \ntime include increased incomes and economic activities resulting from improved access to \ninformation and markets. For example, improved and more affordable broadband access to the \nInternet resulting from the Project will also boost the development and consumption of ICT and \nthereby increase economic productivity and efficiency. But these benefits are hardly quantifiable \nand were not included in the analysis. \n58.  Without the Project, Nepal and Bhutan, which are currently not connected to any CLS, \nhave to depend on satellite transmission, in particular very small aperture terminals (VSATs), to \ngain access to the Internet. VSAT access is generally twice as expensive as access through \nCLS terrestrial links. At present, VSAT access costs about $1,500 per megabyte (MB) per \nmonth. Nepal is allocated a maximum of 200 MB of VSAT access capacity and Bhutan, 40 MB. \nWith the Project, Nepal and Bhutan will have a better option: instead of relying on expensive \nsatellite access to the Internet, they will attain bigger Internet access capacity through CLSs, \nwith negotiated payment of operation fees to India and Bangladesh of about $850 per megabyte \nper month. The Internet access capacity that Nepal and Bhutan can purchase will be at least \nabout three times as large, amounting to a total of 775 MB per month\u2014620 MB for Nepal and \n155 MB for Bhutan.  \n                                                 \n10 The location where a submarine or other underwater cable makes landfall. \n ", "  19\n59.  The economic life of the SASEC regional network and the SASEC village network was \nassumed to be 15 years, and the residual value to be 10% of the acquisition cost. The operation \nand maintenance costs for the fiber-optic cables were assessed at 2% of the installation cost \nper year, and for computer equipment at 3% for the first 3 years, increasing by 100 basis points \nevery 3 years as the equipment ages. All cost elements were valued at border prices, using a \nworld price numeraire, with all taxes and duties excluded. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 \nwas applied to non-tradable items and labor. \n60.  The overall EIRR of the Project is estimated at 34.3%. The sensitivity of the EIRR was \ntested for cases when (i) no indirect benefits are included; (ii) the project benefits are reduced \nby 20%; (iii) the project cost increases by 20%; and (iv) cases ii and iii combined. In each case, \nthe EIRR remains robust at the level of 31.9%, 27.6%, 28.7%, and 22.7%, respectively. Details \nof the economic analysis are in Appendix 12. \nD.  Risks \n61.  The successful implementation and operation of the project facilities will depend largely \non  multilateral  and  bilateral  agreements  among  the  SASEC  countries.  Any  difficulty  or \nprocrastination in signing those agreements will delay or otherwise hamper the implementation \nand  operation  of  the  facilities.  ADB  will  facilitate  the  signing  of  the  agreements  through \ncontinued monitoring and support for the SASEC ICTWG. \n62.  As the SASEC village network and the research and training network will be required to \ntake on the social responsibility of serving the rural societies, their operation could be financially \nunviable, at least in part. To mitigate this financial risk, the operation of the networks will be \nfranchised to private entrepreneurs such as rural ISPs and ICT research institutes, which will \nrun the networks as commercial and social operations. A financial resource pool will be created \nfrom the contributions of the service agencies in the SASEC regional network to provide needed \nfinancial support to the agencies in fulfilling their social responsibility. ADB will ensure that the \noperations  of  the  village  and  research  and  training  networks  are  effectively  franchised,  to \nmaximize the benefits of public-private partnership.  \n63.  The price for connecting to the CLSs in India is competitively determined in the market. \nHowever, no market price for interconnection has been determined as yet in Bangladesh. As a \nresult, Bangladesh may set a price that is not at the optimum level for the operation of the \nSASEC regional network. ADB will collaborate closely with the EA and the telecommunications \nregulator to reduce such an operational risk in Bangladesh. \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n64.  In addition to the standard assurances, the four governments have given the following \nspecific assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i)  Signing of multilateral cooperation agreement. The governments of the SASEC \ncountries will sign the multilateral cooperation network agreement before the grant or \nloan for the Project takes effect. \n(ii)  Signing of bilateral interconnection agreement. The governments of the SASEC \ncountries will select the service agencies in their respective countries and sign the \nbilateral interconnection agreement with other SASEC countries before the contract \nfor network design and installation is awarded. \n ", "20  \n(iii)  Land acquisition and resettlement. The governments will ensure that the network \nand equipment will be colocated with existing facilities whenever required. In the \nevent of (a) any unanticipated or unforeseen involuntary resettlement, (b) private land \nacquisition,  or  (c)  resettlement  activities  during  project  implementation,  the \ngovernments of the SASEC countries will ensure that the Project is implemented in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and all applicable \nlaws and regulations in the SASEC countries. \n(iv)  Environmental  protection.  The  governments  will  ensure  that  any  unexpected \nenvironmental impact will be addressed by consulting ADB. The construction of the \ndata  centers  will  take  into  account  the  recommendations  from  the  initial \nenvironmental  examination  and  will  strictly  follow  the  conditions  attached  in  the \nbuilding  permit.  Project  implementation  will  take  into  consideration  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002), and the Government Protection Act, 1997.  \n(v)  Labor laws. The governments will ensure that all civil works, system development, \nand installation contractors (a) comply with all applicable labor laws; (b) do not \nemploy child labor for construction and maintenance activities; (c) do not differentiate \nwages between men and women, particularly for work of equal value; (d) encourage \nthe employment of the local poor who meet the job and efficiency requirements, \nparticularly women; and (e) provide timely payment of wages at least monthly and \nsafe working conditions to all workers. All civil works contracts will include specific \nclauses on these undertakings, and compliance will be strictly monitored by the PMU \nunder the EA during project implementation. \n(vi)  Good governance and anticorruption. Consistent with ADB\u2019s and the governments\u2019 \ncommitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, the governments \nwill ensure that the project funds are used effectively and efficiently to implement the \nProject and to achieve the project objectives. The governments will (a) undertake the \nnecessary measures to create and sustain a corruption-free environment; (b) ensure \nthat the governments\u2019 anticorruption laws, if there are any, and ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy, are strictly enforced and are complied with during project implementation, and \nthat relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in all bidding \ndocuments for the Project; (c) facilitate ADB\u2019s exercise of its right to investigate, \ndirectly or through its agents, any allegations of corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or \ncoercive practices relating to the Project; (d) conduct periodic inspections of the \nproject  contractors\u2019  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  and \n(e) ensure that all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts \nof the EAs and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey  relate  to  the  Project.  The  governments  will  cooperate  with  any  audit  and \ninvestigation and extend the necessary assistance, including access to all relevant \nbooks and records, as well as the engagement of independent auditors and experts \nthat may be needed for the satisfactory completion of such audits and investigations.  \n(vii)  Project performance monitoring system.

ICT  and  the  SASEC  Subregion.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been \nsupporting regional cooperation among Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal through the South \nAsia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC)  Program  since  2001. 1 Information  and \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\ncommunication technology (ICT) was added as one of the priority sectors to the program in \nphase II and the first ICT Working Group (ICTWG) meeting was held in India in March 2004. All \nSASEC  countries  have  acknowledged  the  significance  of  ICT  in  poverty  alleviation  and \neconomic advancement in their ICT strategic plans. They have undertaken significant strategic \npolicy development consistent with established planning process for ICT, especially in relation \nto infrastructure, e-government, e-education, e-commerce, training and skills development, and \nICT industry development.  \n2.  At present, the overall ICT performance of the SASEC countries is low, although the \ndynamics of ICT development in each country are different. This poor performance is partially \ncaused by the limited nationwide connectivity despite the effects of rapid growth in privatization \nand  competition  in  mobile  telephony.  In  2005,  fixed  tele-density  ranged  from  0.75  for \nBangladesh to 4.55 for India; mobile tele-density, from 0.83 for Nepal to 8.17 for India; and \nInternet user penetration, from 0.26 for Bangladesh to 5.44 for India. PC penetration in 2004 \nranged from 0.47 for Nepal to 1.41 for Bhutan. As shown in Figure A2.1, in recent years, there \nhas  been  remarkable  growth  in  Internet  user  penetration  in  India and  Bhutan,  and  in  PC \npenetration in most of the SASEC countries. Individual country statistics are summarized in \nFigure A2.1. \nFigure A2.1: Growth in Internet User Penetration \nInternet Users per 100 Inhabitants PC per 100 Inhabitants \n \n6 1.6\n \n5 1.4\n  1.2\n4 Bangladesh Bangladesh\n1\n  Bhutan Bhutan\n3 0.8\n  India 0.6 India\n2  Nepal 0.4 Nepal\n1 0.2\n \n0           0\n1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 1995199619971998199920002001200220032004\n   \n3.  Various international organizations have developed indices for measuring readiness to \nparticipate in the information society, using a series of standardized indicators representing the \nlevel of ICT connectivity, use, and uptake, as well as school enrolment and literacy. Among the \nmajor  indices,  the  Digital  Opportunity  Index  (DOI),  published  by  the  International \nTelecommunications Union (ITU),2 was endorsed by the World Summit on the Information \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nSociety (WSIS) as part of the evaluation methodology and benchmarking system for statistical \nindicators in ICT. The index was designed to assess progress in creating digital opportunity and \nbridging the digital divide. There are four areas of evaluation: coverage and affordability of ICT \nservices,  access  (including  number  of  landlines,  mobile  phones,  and  computers  per  100 \n                                                 \n1  The Program has been supported through ADB. 2000.

Despite  the  wide  diversity  among  the  SASEC  countries  and  the  relatively  short \nimplementation  period,  the  ICTWG  has  made  notable  progress.  With  ADB  assistance, 3 it \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\ndrafted a SASEC ICT development master plan laying down the strategy, framework, and \npriorities for SASEC regional cooperation in ICT to harness the full potential of ICT for poverty \nreduction and inclusive growth. The second SASEC ICTWG meeting in Bhutan held in February, \n2006, accepted the master plan, which, among other things, identified three most urgent areas \nfor improvement in ICT: fragmented cross-border connectivity, poor access to information in the \nrural areas, and insufficient human resource capacity. At the third ICTWG meeting in Dhaka in \nSeptember 2006, the SASEC countries developed the concept of SASEC information highway \nto address such needs by delivering modern affordable and reliable broadband information, \ncommunication, and knowledge services within and across borders to universities, businesses, \nand rural and remote communities.  \n5.  SASEC  ICT  Strategy.  The  SASEC  regional  ICT  strategy  in  the  master  plan  was \nformulated to coordinate and consolidate the national leadership, vision, and strategies of the \nindividual countries. It identified the following common areas: (i) the central role of low-cost \ninterconnected infrastructure; (ii) the priority need for ICT skills development; (iii) ICT industry \ndevelopment; (iv) e-applications development (e-community, e-commerce, e-government); and \n(v) regulation, legislation, and governance. It also identified the following common objectives: \n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2005.

In all SASEC countries, there is considerable recognition of the benefits of broadband \ncapacity and a growing awareness of the issues and opportunities emerging from convergence. \nThe  regulatory  environment  varies  substantially  among  the  SASEC  countries  but  all  the \ncountries recognize the necessity of having independent regulatory authorities oversee the \nopening up of telecommunications infrastructure to competition. Also, the need to open up the \ninfrastructure to investors, to achieve national objectives within a defined period, is explicitly \nacknowledged.  Local  ICT  industry  development  is  a  common  agenda.  There  are  other \nconsiderations as well, including, for example, the structure and governance of the Internet and \nthe global positioning of the region. There is also common recognition of skills development as a \nrequirement at all levels, including community e-literacy and accredited graduate qualifications. \nFurther, all SASEC members have identified extensive requirements for service applications, \nincluding government services such as e-education, e-health, and e-culture, as well as the \npotential for new governance structures to improve community participation. All members have \nalso recognized the need for new institutions or for the enhancement of the capacity and course \nofferings of existing training institutions. These common interests and policies define a broad \nscope for priority areas of collaboration and regional ICT development strategy in the master \nplan. The results of the review of individual country policies are summarized in Table A2.3. \n ", "Appendix 2  29\n7.  SASEC Cross-Border Connectivity. Despite the proximity of the SASEC countries to \none another, the existing cross-border network in the subregion is fragmented and outdated.  \nReasonable broadband or even more basic ICT data applications cannot be supported in many \ncommunities, although voice communications, often of low quality, are available. All four SASEC \ncountries  are  technically  interconnected  through  fiber  optics  or  microwave,  but  data \ncommunications among the countries are not direct and often go via third parties. Bhutan and \nNepal are landlocked, with the Himalayas and the People\u2019s Republic of China to the north, and \nthe border with India surrounding the rest of the territory. Both countries aspire to competitive \naccess with redundancy to international networks, particularly to submarine cables. India and \nBangladesh, on the other hand, have access to international fiber-optic cables via submarine \ncable landings, including the link to Sea-Me-We 4.4 Unlike Bhutan and Nepal, therefore, India \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nand Bangladesh have high-capacity international bandwidth as well as alternative gateways and \nredundancy.  \n8.  In the cross-border region, as shown in Figure A2.3 below, the fiber-optic links are \ncarried by incumbent telecom operators and power companies: in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh \nTelegraph and Telephone Board (BTTB) and Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB); in \nBhutan, Bhutan Telecom and Tala Hydro Power Authority; in India, Bharat Sanchar Nigam \nLimited  (BSNL),  Reliance  Communications,  RailTel,  and  Power  Grid;  and  in  Nepal,  Nepal \nTelecom (NT) and Nepal Electrical Authority (NEA). However, the terrestrial cross-border links \nin the region either lack capacity or redundancy, or are sometimes missing.  \n(i)  In India, BSNL and Reliance have international long-distance licenses to allow \ncross-border access. BSNL is the incumbent carrier and has most of the required \nlinks to the SASEC neighbors. \n(ii)  Bangladesh-India border link: No fiber-optic cable is available from the northern \ntown  of  Panchagarh  in  Bangladesh  to  the  border  point  of  Banglabandha, \nBangladesh, and its links to the nearest Indian location of Fulbari. From Dhaka to \nPanchagarh, BTTB has a minimum of 12 core fiber, and PGCB, 16 core fiber. \n(iii)  Bhutan-India border link: There is a cross-border fiber-optic cable, 12 core-fiber \nsynchronous  transport  module  1  (STM  1)  (155  megabytes  [MB]),  carried  by \nBSNL and Bhutan Telecom (with 4 MB of Internet access capacity), connecting \nPhuensholing in Bhutan to Jaigaon in India. Bhutan Telecom has a fiber-optic link \nfrom  Thimpu  to  Phuentsholing  via  Bhutan  Power  Corporation\u2019s  transmission \nnetwork grid.  \n(iv)  Nepal-India border link: There is a cross-border fiber-optic cable, 12 core-fiber \nSTM 1 (155 MB), carried by BSNL and Nepal Telecom (with 16 MB of Internet \naccess capacity), connecting Biratnagar in Nepal to Jogbani in India. Reliance \nalso has a fiber-optic cable connecting Biratnagar and Jogbani. Within Nepal, the \nNEA has a fiber-optic link between Kathmandu and Hetauda, and Nepal Telecom \nhas fiber-optic capacity between Hetauda and Biratnagar.  \n                                                 \n4  The submarine telecommunications cable linking Southeast Asia to Europe via the Indian subcontinent and the \nMiddle East. \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \n  Figure A2.3: SASEC Cross-Border Connectivity \n \n \n9.  Even though fiber-optic links have been established, they cannot be used for data traffic \nwithout Internet exchange points and a peering arrangement.5 The largest domestic market in \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nIndia is Mumbai, which is a fair distance from the other three countries. The nearest domestic \nmarket is in Calcutta, which has yet to be fully developed to attract Internet service providers \n(ISPs) from the neighboring countries. As a result, there has been massive deployment of \nexpensive satellite connections for Internet access in the last decade in the landlocked countries \nof Bhutan and Nepal. Before the establishment of local exchange points, even traffic within the \ncountries was exchanged overseas, generally in Hong Kong, China but sometimes also in the \nUnited States.6 There is a vast difference in cost between Internet traffic routed internationally \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nand locally routed traffic. The fragmentation in the regional network has led to heavy overhead \ntransit costs and ultimately high user cost, and limited the full use and uptake of ICT-enabled \nservices in the subregion. \n10.  Internet. Internet access in the South Asia region was first introduced in the early 1990s \nby ERNET in India. ERNET also extended dial-up e-mail service to its partner in Nepal soon \nafterward.  But  the  real  impetus  came  with  the  commercial  launching  of  Internet  services \nthroughout the region. Commercial Internet service was launched in India in 1995, by the \nstate-owned VSNL. Other countries in the region were quick to follow, with Bhutan being the \nonly exception until 2000. While the state-owned VSNL and Bhutan Telecom took the lead in \nIndia and Bhutan, respectively, private players took the lead in Bangladesh and Nepal. Except \nfor one single ISP in Nepal connecting through VSNL in those early days, there was no regional \nInternet connectivity. Until recently, even providers within countries were not connected to each \nother. Except for India, the primary mode of connection to the upstream providers is still through \n                                                 \n5  Peering is the arrangement of traffic exchange between Internet service providers (ISPs). Larger ISPs with their \nown backbone networks agree to allow traffic from other large ISPs in exchange for traffic on their backbones. \nThey also exchange traffic with smaller ISPs to reach regional end points. \n6  The global exchange points and bandwidth markets are located on the East Coast of the United States (New York \nand Washington, DC), the West Coast of the United States (San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles), Europe \n(London and Amsterdam), and Asia (Hong Kong, China and Singapore). \n ", "Appendix 2  31\nsatellite connections, given the lack of subsea cable landing in the other countries. Recent \ninvestments in infrastructure inside India, coupled with the liberalization of the telecom sector, \ncan have a positive effect in providing faster connectivity to the other countries in the region.  \n11.  Rural ICT Program. Other than in India, there is as yet little prospect and practicality for \nthe use of ICT for poverty reduction and rural development in the SASEC countries. Rural \ncommunity e-centers (CECs) have been continuing for some years in Bangladesh and Nepal, \nand more recently in Bhutan. However, these experiments have not yet reached national scale. \nIn India, the CEC movement is now a national initiative, with the prospect of connectivity in \nevery village within the next few years. Several hundreds of CECs operate in Bangladesh and \nNepal, mostly driven by NGOs and private sector, and tens of CECs operate in Bhutan, mainly \ndriven by the government and development agencies. In India, CECs exist in the tens of \nthousands, driven by a mix of large enterprises, entrepreneurs, universities, government, and \nNGOs. However, owing to the huge size of the poor population, there are tremendous problems \nof scale in India. Such problems are less severe in the other SASEC countries.  \n \n ", " \n3\n2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable A2.2: Economic and ICT Statistics on the SASEC Countries   A\np\nLow- South  p\ne\nIncome  Asia  n\nd\nBangladesh  Bhutan  India  Nepal  Group  Region  ix\n 2\nCategory  2000  2005  2000  2005  2000  2005  2000  2005  2005  2005   \nEconomic and Social Context                     \nPopulation, total (million)  129.0 142.0 0.6 0.64 1,016.0  1,095.0 24.0 27.0 2,352.0 1,470.0\nUrban population (% of total population)  23.0 25.0 10.0 11.00 28.0  29.0 13.0 16.0 30.0 28.0\nPoverty (% of population below $1 per day) 41.3 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014  34.3 34.4 24.1 \u2014 30.8\nGNI per capita, Atlas method (current $)  390.0 470.0 720.0 1,250.00 450.0  730.0 220.0 270.0 585.0 692.0\nGDP growth, 1995\u20132000 and 2000\u20132005  5.2 5.4 6.1 7.50 5.8  7.0 4.6 2.8 6.1 6.5\n(%) \nAdult literacy rate (% ages 15 and over)  \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 60.00 \u2014  61.0 \u2014 49.0 61.0 58.0\nPrimary, secondary, tertiary school  58.0 52.0 \u2014 \u2014 55.0  62.0 56.0 58.0 56.0 58.0\nenrollment (% gross) \nICT Sector Structure                     \nSeparate telecommunications regulator  No  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes     \nStatus of main fixed-line operator  Public  Public  Public  Public  Public  Public  Public  Public     \nLevel of competition: international long  M  M  M  M  M  C  M  P     \ndistance \nLevel of competition: mobile  C  C  \u2014  M  P  C  M  P     \nLevel of competition: Internet service  \u2014  C  \u2014  P  C  C  C  C     \nprovider \nGovernment prioritization of ICT (scale of  \u2014  4.4 \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  5.6 \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  4.9\n1\u20137) \nICT Sector Performance                     \nAccess                     \nTelephone main lines (per 1,000 people)  4.0 8.0 23.0 51.00 32.0  45.0 11.0 17.0 37.0 39.0\nInternational voice traffic (minutes per  2.0 5.0 \u2014 41.00 2.0  3.0 2.0 6.0 5.0 4.0\nperson)a \nMobile subscribers (per 1,000 people)  2.0 63.0 0.0 59.00 4.0  82.0 0.0 9.0 77.0 79.0\nPopulation covered by mobile telephony  40.0 80.0 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014  \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n(%) \nInternet users (per 1,000 people)  1.0 3.0 4.0 39.00 5.0  55.0 2.0 4.0 44.0 49.0\nPersonal computers (per 1,000 people)  2.0 12.0 8.0 20.00 5.0  16.0 3.0 4.0 11.0 16.0\nHouseholds with television (%)  18.0 23.0 \u2014 58.00 30.0  32.0 3.0 \u2014 15.0 32.0\n \n ", " \nLow- South \nincome  Asia \n  Bangladesh  Bhutan  India  Nepal  Group  Region \nCategory  2000  2005  2000  2005  2000  2005  2000  2005  2005  2005 \nQuality   \nTelephone faults (per 100 main lines per  \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 54.0 165.5  126.0 100.2 68.0 \u2014 88.1\nyear) \nBroadband subscribers (per 1,000 people)  0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0  1.2 0.0 0.0 0.9 1.0\nInternational Internet bandwidth (bits per  0 0 2 16 1  18 0 2 15 18\nperson) \n   \nAffordability                     \nPrice basket for fixed line ($ per month,  10.7 6.9 4.9 5.1 6.0  3.3 2.6 3.1 8.7 5.1\nresidential) \nPrice basket for mobile ($ per month,  \u2014 2.5 \u2014 3.9 \u2014  2.4 \u2014 2.0 9.6 2.4\n2006) \nPrice basket for Internet ($ per month)  \u2014 24.0 \u2014 14.9 \u2014  6.8 \u2014 8.1 30.1 8.1\nPrice of call to United States ($ per  4.14 2.02 1.19 0.66 3.36  1.19 5.28 2.04 1.99 2.02\n3 minutes) \n   \nInstitutional Efficiency and   \nSustainability \nTotal telecommunications revenue (% of  0.8 1.5 1.2 2.0 1.5  1.9 1.3 1.2 0.7 2.0\nGDP) \nTotal telephone subscribers per employee  48 \u2014 41 74 85  \u2014 60 110 141 125\nTotal telecommunications investment (%  25.1 15.4 26.2 44.5 49.3  \u2014 26.7 26.7 30.9 15.4\nof revenue) \n   \nICT Applications   \nICT expenditure (% of GDP)  2.0 2.4 \u2014 \u2014 3.6  5.8 \u2014 \u2014 5.9 5.7\nE-government readiness index (scale of  \u2014 0.18 \u2014 0.29 \u2014  0.40 \u2014 0.30 0.24 0.29\n0\u20131) \nSecure Internet servers (per 1 million  0.0 0.0 \u2014 \u2014 0.1  0.7 \u2014 0.6 0.5 0.6   A\npeople, 2006)  p\np\nSchools connected to the internet (%)  \u2014. \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014  \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 e\nn\nd\n  ix\n\u2014 = data not available, C = competition, GDP = gross domestic product, GNI = gross national income, ICT = information and communication technology, M =   2\namN Oootnueot:g p oFoiinlgygu,  rMaenDsd Gi nin  =ict aoMlmicilislne gan.rn eiu fmor  Dyeeavreslo optmheern tth Gano athl,o Ps e= s ppaerctiiafile cdo. mpetition, PC = personal computers.  3        \n3\nSources: Economic and social context: UNDP and World Bank; ICT sector structure: ITU, WEF; ICT sector performance: Global Insight/WITSA, ITU, Netcraft, \nUNDESA, UNPAN, and World Bank.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal. \nAs part of the South Asia region, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal are countries organized under the \nSouth  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC)  with  different  levels  of  socioeconomic \ndevelopment. While geography could be a factor, their varied features are basically attributed to the size of \ntheir lands, population, and types of industries. Agriculture is the backbone of their economy, but India is \nveering to trade at a moderate pace. Poverty incidence remains high: Bangladesh has the highest, at \n49.8%, while Bhutan has 25.3% and Nepal, 30.9%. In India, people living below the poverty line compose \n26.1% of the total population but the proportion is declining, though slowly, as poverty remains widespread \nin the country. \nThe main causes of poverty differ from country to country, but the common factors are observed to be as \nfollows:  (i)  low  literacy  rates,  (ii)  high  population  growth,  (iii)  periodic  natural  disasters,  (iv)  lack  of \nemployment and economic opportunities, and (v) lack of access to public information as well as poor \ngovernment schemes and programs for the poor.  \nThe transport and communications sector in the four SASEC countries has been consistently growing over \nthe last 5 years (2001\u20132005), with Bhutan and India achieving double-digit growth rates in 2004 and 2005 \nthat averaged 14% and 11%, respectively. At constant prices, the share of the sector in the gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) of these countries is modest: 9% for Bangladesh, 10% for Bhutan, and 8% for Nepal. India \nmay be considered an exception, as its transport and communications sector accounts for 25% of GDP. \nThe year-to-year expansion of this sector has contributed to poverty reduction in the four countries. \nWith information and communication technology (ICT) becoming important to communications, the four \nnational  governments  have  emphasized  their  need  in  various  social  services  like  education,  health, \nagriculture, tourism, and trade. ICT will hasten the delivery of information to people, particularly in remote \nareas. As the Project is designed for intercountry connectivity between Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and \nNepal, more information will be accessible to the people. Cheap data transfer, research and development, \nand retooling of skills will be facilitated. Overall, the Project will open up more entrepreneurial, economic, \nand educational opportunities which are essential to poverty reduction in the four countries.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis:         Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nThe Project will bring about tangible economic growth and social benefits to the people in the four \ncountries.  The  common  causes  of  poverty  having  been  identified,  the  information  highway  will  be \ninstrumental in providing these people with educational information or access to innovative technology, \nespecially in agriculture, trade, and education.   \nPreliminary discussions with the people in Bangladesh and Nepal indicate that information related to \nagriculture and health will have a direct impact on their quality of life. The information is also important in \nresolving petty health cases through local-language interactive programs with international and domestic \ndoctors providing consultancy through community e-centers (CECs). In addition, the Project will be an \nimportant tool for gaining access to distance learning. India is an ideal partner under the Project, being the \nmost developed among the four countries. It has great experience in research and development training \n(RDT) systems and in the operation of village e-kiosks; this experience can be transferred to the three \nother countries. \n ", "Appendix 10  55\n \n \nC.

The consultations were aimed at \nacquiring a better understanding of the socioeconomic conditions of the people and gauging their views on \nproject development. \nGroup  discussions  among  women  and  the  communities  were  held  to  capture  social  and  economic \nstandards and also to assess the impact that the Project will have on their lives. These discussions and \nconsultations confirmed the need for this Project and drew a positive response of the communities and \ndifferent stakeholders, particularly those in the rural areas. The participants acknowledged the fact that lack \nof appropriate and timely information has affected their exposure to development and their progress. \nParticipation and ownership among the communities has to be encouraged for the sustainability of this \nproject.

Introduction \n1.  This summary initial environmental examination is based on the initial environmental \nexamination  of  the  proposed  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC) \nInformation  Highway  Project.  The  initial  environmental  examination  was  prepared  for  the \ninvestment project, which will (i) establish robust data interchange capacity between all four \nSASEC member countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal) with reduced costs and an \nincrease in reliability and competition, providing efficient access with redundancy to submarine \ncables for Nepal and Bhutan, and also reduce dependency on satellite links, enhance local \npeering,  and  reduce  latency;  (ii)  develop  village  networks  for  SASEC  regional  village \ncommunities to enable rural information and communication technology (ICT) development; and \n(iii) develop ICT training and research centers as part of the piggybacked technical assistance \n(TA). \n2.  The Project is in category C, according to the Environmental Assessment Guidelines \n(2003) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  \n3.  The environmental assessment was carried out between July and August 2007, on the \nbasis of secondary data and field visits. The initial environmental examination report conformed \nto the relevant laws and regulations of the governments of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and \nNepal, and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Requirements \n(2003).  \nB.  Description of the Project \n1.  Project Components and Locations \n4.  The SASEC regional network (SASECRN) proposed under TA 6358-REG will comprise \nfour network access gateways (co-location facilities), one in each country, linked to a border \ntownship  within  the  country  for  connectivity  to  other  countries.  The  border-connectivity \ntownships are effectively strategic cable landing points in the SASEC countries. In-country and \ncross-border links are the carrier links for the SASECRN.  \n5.  The SASECRN is aimed at expanding ICT facilities in rural areas and setting up village \nnetworks and community electronic centers (CECs). At the village level, the CECs become \nconnection points for interaction with the SASECRN. Also, CECs can operate as hubs for other \nCECs in the local area, thus enlarging the network coverage.  \n6.  A regional ICT training and research center will be set up in each SASEC country.  \n2.  Proposed Project Activities: Country-Specific \n7.  The SASECRN will maximize the use of existing infrastructure throughout each country. \nThe  project  activities  in  each  country  will  be  planned  so  as  to  establish  in-country  and \ncross-border links using the existing or upgraded fiber-optic cable network or a new network \ndeveloped  along  existing  power  transmission  lines.  Preference  is  given  to  overhead \nenvironment (optical power ground wire [OPGW]), which is safe from flooding, land subsidence, \nand vandalism. Co-location sites with existing requisite facilities like air-conditioning, backup \npower, space, and building security will also be selected. The border-connectivity townships will \nhave access to existing telecommunication and power transmission infrastructure, and can be \n ", "58  Appendix 11 \nreached through good roads. \nC.  Description of the Environment \n8.  The project area is spread all over the country in Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. India \nhas minimal interface with the environment since most of the required infrastructure is available \nfor the Project. The project activities in the four countries have environmental interface primarily \nwith respect to topographical, soil, and biological/valuable ecological component (VEC). \n9.  The  Project  requires  the  identification  of  co-location  facilities,  in-country  and  cross-\nborder links, and village network locations. The project design is based on the use of existing \ninfrastructure in each country. The co-location sites (network access gateways), one in each \ncountry, will be identified on the basis of availability of requisite space, facilities, and connectivity \nto in-country links. The in-country and cross-border links will have the requisite connectivity \nbetween  the  access  gateway  and  border-connectivity  townships,  right-of-way  (ROW),  and \naccess to the links. The border-connectivity townships will be those where connectivity to India\u2019s \nborder-connectivity  township  already  exists  or  can  be  easily  established  without  causing \nsignificant environmental impact. CECs will be identified with the availability of space and the \nrequisite facilities in mind. The project components and activities will therefore have very limited \nenvironmental interface. For this reason, the Project is classified as category C. An alternative \nanalysis  is  usually  carried  out  to  enable  the  project  proponent  to  adopt  environmentally \nacceptable options. But since the Project has limited environmental interface, and project design \nhas adopted the best feasible options, no alternative analysis was carried out.  \nD.  Anticipated Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures \n10.  The  project  impact  is  categorized  into  two  phases:  (i)  impact  during  design  and \ndevelopment, and (ii) impact during operation. The impact on identified VECs in each country is \ndescribed here, along with the mitigation measures required at different phases of the Project.  \n11.  The potential impact of the Project is directly linked to the likely interface of project \nactivities with the environment, as detailed above in the Description of the Project section. The \nproposed activities in the four countries are not likely to have any significant impact on air \nquality,  noise  levels,  and  water  resources.  The  impact  is  likely  to  be  confined  to  loss  of \nvegetation and trees, and soil contamination. On the other hand, the Project will facilitate the \nflow of updated information about better agricultural practices and employment opportunities, \nwhich will catalyze the overall socioeconomic development of the area. The identified potential \nimpact due to the proposed SASEC Information Highway Project is summarized in the following \nsections.  \n1.  Nepal \na.  Design and Development  \n12.  The environmental impact was assessed on the basis of the proposed design of the \nnetwork access gateways (co-location facilities), in-country link access, and border connectivity. \nSince most of the above facilities already have the requisite infrastructure, the required ROW, \nand  access  to  the  site,  no  direct  significant  impact  is  anticipated  from  the  proposed \ndevelopment. The development of CECs may have associated impact if these are set up on \nnew sites and in remote areas. All the five CEC locations already selected under this TA 6358 \nare  well  connected  and  are  proposed  to  be  set  up  in  existing  buildings.  The  wireless \nconnectivity poles, which are proposed to be set up in consideration of line of sight, may involve \n ", "Appendix 11  59\nsite-clearing activity in small areas as well as creation of access to the proposed pole locations. \nThese activities may have direct impact in terms of cutting of trees and compaction of soil (from \nvehicular movement), though the impact will be smaller in magnitude.  \n13.  To avoid any environmental impact due to CECs and wireless connectivity development, \nefforts will be made to select the pole locations such that no loss of trees is involved. Wherever \ntree cutting is unavoidable, provision will be made for compensatory afforestation (25 trees \nplanted for every tree cut, according to the practice in Nepal). Nepal has several protected \nareas1 (eight national parks, three conservation areas, three wildlife reserves). Efforts are to be \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nmade to avoid routing any fiber-optic link or setting up wireless connectivity pole for CEC \ndevelopment in the protected areas. The CECs or co-location sites should not be located in \nflood-prone areas. Nepal is in an earthquake-prone area. This fact should be considered in the \nstructural design of the CECs or co-location site building.   \nb.  Operation \n14.  The operational activity of the SASECRN (in-country network and cross-border links) \nmay require some maintenance activity. However, because of the availability of access and \nunlikely generation of any waste, no environmental impact is anticipated from these networks. \nThe co-location site may generate e-waste and used uninterruptible power supply batteries, \nthough in very small quantities and over a long period of time. The uncontrolled disposal of \nthese wastes can have a harmful impact on the environment (like soil contamination). If power \nbackup is also provided through a diesel generating set, there may be noise and air pollution. \nSimilarly, the operation of the CECs may generate office consumable waste and e-waste. Since \nCECs  are  located  in  remote  areas  where  sanitation  facilities  may  not  be  adequate,  the \nuncontrolled discharge of domestic sewage may create sanitation problems and unhygienic \nconditions.  \n15.  To mitigate the likely environmental impact, the recycling of e-waste and used UPS \nbatteries through the supplier of these items is proposed. The network access gateways and \nCECs are to be equipped with requisite firefighting facilities. A septic tank for treating domestic \nsewage at the CECs is also to be provided. If backup power is provided through a diesel \ngenerating set, then provision will be made to ensure adequate stack height with muffler and \nacoustic enclosure to prevent air and noise pollution.  \n2.  Bhutan \na.  Design and Development  \n16.  The impact identified for the network access gateways (co-location facilities), in-country \nlink access, border connectivity, and CECs is the same as that assessed for Nepal since the \nactivities involved are similar except for the laying of alternate fiber-optic links along the Bhutan \nPower Transmission route. The Bhutan Power Transmission link already exists and has the \nrequisite ROW and access to the tower sites. Different techniques may be adopted for laying \nthe OPGW link. However, all the techniques involve, primarily, manual work. As such, they will \nnot cause any significant environmental impact. Clearing the constrained access may cause \nsome loss of vegetation.  \n                                                 \n1 Department of Forest Research and Survey. 1999.

To avoid any environmental impact due to CECs and wireless connectivity development, \nefforts are to be made to select the pole locations such that no loss of trees is involved. \nWherever tree cutting is unavoidable, provision will be made for compensatory afforestation \n(preferably two trees planted for every tree cut). Bhutan has several protected areas2 (four \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nnational parks, three sanctuaries). Efforts are to be made to avoid routing any fiber-optic or \nwireless connectivity (pole fixation) for CEC development in protected areas. No protected \nareas are located close to the border-connectivity town or the western part of Bhutan.  \nb.  Operation  \n18.  The  impact  identified  and  mitigation  measures  suggested  are  the  same  as  those \nindicated for Nepal.  \n3.  Bangladesh \na.  Design and Development  \n19.  The impact identified for the network access gateways (co-location facilities) and in-\ncountry link access are the same as those identified for Nepal. The cross-border links between \nPanchargarh and Phulbari are yet to be developed. The fiber-optic link is proposed to be laid \nwithin the ROW of the existing highway. This activity may lead to loss of tree cover, soil \ncompaction or erosion, and siltation of water bodies.  The construction of the CEC building may \ncreate localized air and noise pollution during construction. \n20.  The mitigation measures proposed for Bangladesh will be the same as those for Nepal. \nAdditionally, precaution has to be taken when aligning the cross-border links to minimize loss of \nvegetation or trees, and to make sure that no construction waste finds its way to water bodies. \nWater should be sprayed on loose material to prevent dust generation during the construction of \nthe building. An external covering curtain is to be used. Construction wastes should be disposed \nof in low-lying areas as filling material. Personal protective equipment should be provided to \nconstruction workers. CECs should not be located in flood-prone areas. Septic tanks for treating \ndomestic sewage should be provided. \nb.  Operation  \n21.  The impact identified and mitigation measures suggested are the same as those for \nNepal.  \n4.  India \n22.  Design, Development, and Operation. The impact identified will be limited in the case of \nthe provision of links between Panchgarg and Phulbari. The mitigation measures with respect to \nthe laying of the links will be same as those indicated for Bangladesh above. The construction of \nthe CEC building may create localized air and noise pollution during construction. The impact \nidentified for the construction of the regional research and training center building will be the \nsame as that for similar construction in Bangladesh. The mitigation measures will also be the \nsame.  \n                                                 \n2 Department of Forest, Ministry of Agriculture, Government of Bhutan.  \n ", "Appendix 11  61\nE.  Environmental Management Plan \n1.  Key Mitigation and Monitoring Actions \n23.  The environmental management plan (EMP) is aimed at ensuring that the adverse \nimpact associated with the Project is properly mitigated to an acceptable level through the most \ntechnically and economically feasible option, if not prevented outright. The EMP will also ensure \nthat the positive impact is sustained and enhanced. The EMP consists of a set of mitigation, \nmonitoring, and institutional measures to be taken in a time-bound manner during the design, \nconstruction, and operation stages of the Project. The EMP also includes the actions needed for \nthe  implementation  of  these  measures.  The  EMP  has  been  developed,  but  no  detailed \nenvironmental monitoring plan has been prepared at this stage because the residual impact is \nassumed to be insignificant. The monitoring proposed is to be limited to ensuring compliance \nwith EMP commitments.  \na.  Implementation Period for Mitigation Measures \n24.  The mitigation measures to be implemented will depend on the nature of the impact \nassociated with the various project activities. The implementation period will coincide with the \nfinal project implementation schedule.  \nb.  Contingency Response Plan \n25.  The Project may have one primary environmental emergency\u2014fire at access gateways, \nCECs, and border-connectivity townships\u2014plus pollution and waste discharge. The requisite \nfire protection infrastructure should be provided at these locations. A communication system for \nexclusively this purpose should also be established with fire departments. \nc.  Authorities and Implementation Responsibility \n26.  The authorities and responsibilities for the implementation of the EMP should reside with \nthe country executing agencies (EAs). All policy decisions, including the incorporation of the \nEMP requirements, will be the responsibility of the EAs, which will ensure, through responsible \ndepartments, that the environmental mitigation measures are implemented effectively. For this \npurpose, the EAs will designate officials to coordinate activities related to EMP implementation. \nThose officials may hire external consultants for any additional environmental assessment.   \n2.  Institutional Capacity to Implement and Sustain Mitigation and Monitoring \n27.  The  SASEC  countries  do  not  have  environment  departments  or  officials.  For  the \neffective  implementation  of  the  EMP,  at  least  one  officer  will  be  designated  to  coordinate \nenvironmental activities. This official will be trained to manage environmental aspects and \nundertake  environmental  assessment  for  the  development  of  new  CECs  as  well  as  the \ndevelopment and upgrading of in-country and cross-border links.  \nF.  Public Consultation \n28.  Government and public perceptions of the Project were elicited in informal and ad hoc \npublic consultations from 31 July to 3 August 2007 in Bhutan and Nepal, which were attended \nby  about  15  persons.  The  discussion  focused  mainly  on  the  development  of  CECs,  their \nfacilities, and the setting up of wireless networks, which may require limited site clearing. The \noutcome of the public consultations was very positive and the villagers were supportive of the \n ", "62  Appendix 11 \nProject. The consultations indicated that environmental awareness among the public may be \nenhanced with the help of e-centers.  \n29.  Formal  consultations  and  meetings  were  held  with  government  officials  from  the \nenvironmental, forest, and biodiversity departments in the four countries. The officials were \napprised of the project components and the likely regulatory interfaces. From the discussions, it \nwas learned that no legislative clearance may be required if existing infrastructure is to be used. \nHowever, for newer developments or site clearance, prior approval must be obtained under \napplicable environmental laws. The applicable requirements have been assessed and have \nalready been incorporated into the EMP.   \n30.  E-waste is not yet a priority concern in any of the countries. No legislation governing \ne-waste is in place. At any rate, e-waste from the Project is likely to be very small in quantity \nand generated over a long span of time. Recycling or reuse of e-waste is considered to be the \nbest management option. \nG.  Conclusions and Recommendation \n31.  The proposed project components will cause insignificant adverse environmental impact. \nEnvironmental impact is likely to be caused by the development of CECs and cross-border links \nbetween Bangladesh and India. Some impact is also likely to be caused during the operation of \nnetwork access gateways, border township facilities, and CECs. The impact is associated with \nthe disposal of office and e-waste, which is recyclable, and domestic sewage, which can be fully \ntreated.  The  implementation  of  prescribed  mitigation  measures  will  minimize  the  predicted \nimpact during project design and development as well as operation. \n32.  The  development  of  CECs,  the  setting  up  of  wireless  connectivity  poles,  and  the \ndevelopment of cross-border links between Bangladesh and India may require the cutting of \ntrees, the development of access, or the acquisition and clearing of additional land. If so, the \nprovisions  of  the  following  country-specific  environmental  laws  with  respect  to  obtaining \npermission for the felling of trees, the diversion of forestland, and environment protection are to \nbe followed:  \n(i)  Bhutan: Forests and Nature Conservation Act of Bhutan (1995), Rules (2006), \nand Environment Assessment Act (2000)/Rules (2002).  \n(ii)  Nepal: Environment Protection Act (1997)/Rules (1997) and National Park and \nWild Life Conservation Act (1973)/Rules (1974) (amended 1985). \n(iii)  Bangladesh:  Environment  Conservation  Act  (1995),  The  Forest  Act  (1927) \n(amended 2000). \n(iv)  India:  Environment  (Protection)  Act,  1986  (amended  2006)  and  Forests \nConservation Act. 1980 (amended 1988). \n33.  The environmental assessment was carried out at the project preparatory stage. The \nalignment for connectivity between Bangladesh and India is yet to be firmed up, and so is the \nadditional  CECs  or  wireless  connectivity  routing.  These  activities  and  any  change  in  the \nactivities defined under Section II above may require the preparation of additional environmental \nassessment, which must be submitted to ADB for approval. The EMP also needs to be revised \naccordingly. The necessary environmental clearances in the various countries must also be \nobtained before the start of the activity. \n \n ", "Appendix 12  63\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The proposed Project comprises SASEC regional network (SASECRN), which is to \nestablish robust data interchange capacity among the four SASEC member countries, and \nSASEC village network (SASECVN). SASECRN will replace microwave facilities, providing \nefficient access, with redundancy, to submarine cables for Bhutan and Nepal. It will lower \ninternet connecting costs and increase service reliability and competition, thereby promoting an \nefficient  use  of  network  services  (e.g.,  reducing  latency  and  enhancing  local  peering). \nSASECVN  is  to  expand  ICT-accessibility  and  ICT-enabled  service 1 in  remote  rural  areas \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nthrough the establishment of networks serving village communities in the countries. SASECVN \nhas been integrated into the Project to spread the benefits of SASECRN over a wider cross-\nsection of rural poor communities in the countries. The integrated approach will ensure to \nimprove the rural communities\u2019 accessibility to information and economic opportunities, and \nthereby maximize the Project\u2019s benefits.  \n \n2.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  2  years.  The  economic  analysis  covers  the \nfollowing 15 years of full operation. Economic evaluation was undertaken using 2007 prices. \nThe residual values of SASECRN and SASECVN were assumed to be 10% of their acquisition \ncost. The operation and maintenance costs for optical fiber were assessed at 2% of its annual \ninstallation cost, and operation and maintenance costs for computer equipment at 3% for the \nfirst three years then increasing by 100 basis points each for three years as the equipment ages. \nAll cost elements were valued at border prices, using a world price numeraire, with all taxes and \nduties excluded. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 was applied to non-tradable items and \nlabors. \n \nB.  Project Benefits \n \n1.  SASEC-Regional Network \n \n3.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project was estimated by comparing \nthe project case with a base case involving the continued use of the satellite. The installation of \nthe regional network will enable to connect the cable landing stations (CLS)2 in Bangladesh and \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nIndia to an access gateway, and then distribute internet capacity to Nepal and Bhutan via \nterrestrial links. \n \n4.  The economic benefits include: (i) savings in the cost connecting the internet service as \na result of SASECRN (accrued to Nepal and Bhutan), and (ii) incremental revenues which will \nbe paid by Nepal and Bhutan for the connection with CLS (accrued to India and Bangladesh). \nOther economic indirect benefits over time include increased incomes and economic activities \nresulting from improved access to information and markets. But, these are, hardly quantifiable, \nnot included. \n \n5.  Without the Project, Nepal and Bhutan, which are currently not connected with any CLS, \nhave to depend on satellite to access internet, in particular very small aperture terminals (VSAT). \nVSAT are twice expensive in general than terrestrial links through CLS. At present, a per-\nmegabyte per-month cost for VSAT is about $1,500. At present, the maximum capacity of \n                                                 \n1 ICT-enabled services include voice, chatting, video conference, education, health, and governance. \n2 It refers to the location where a submarine or other underwater cable makes landfall \n ", "64  Appendix 12 \ninternet access from VSAT allocated to Nepal and Bhutan is 200 megabytes and 40 megabytes, \nrespectively. \n \n6.  With the Project, Nepal and Bhutan will have a better option: instead of relying on \nexpensive satellite to access internet, they will attain bigger internet access capacity from CLS, \nwith the negotiated payment of operation fees to India and Bangladesh. The internet access \ncapacity that Nepal and Bhutan can purchase will be at minimum about three times bigger, \namounting to a total of 775 megabytes per month: 620 megabytes and 155 megabytes for \nNepal and Bhutan, respectively. \n \n7.  With the implementation of SASECRN, the costs that Nepal and Bhutan need to pay to \nconnect CLS through Bangladesh or India consist of land costs of internet capacity, in-country \nhaulage cost to the access gateway, and cross-border haulage to the access gateway. Details \nare as follow: \n \n(i)  Landed cost of internet capacity. India has two CLS and Bangladesh one and \nthe comparable cost is about $500 per month per megabyte regardless of the \nlanding.  \n \n(ii)  In-country haulage cost to the access gateway. India\u2019s cost for in-country \nhaulage is based on prevailing prices offered by three carriers: RailTel, PGCI, \nand BSNL. The cost is a regulated price and is based on distance, however, all \ncarriers can discount this cost to suit the market. In case of Bangladesh, no \nmarket price is available. It is assumed that the price, once set in the market, will \nbe in the level that may be comparable to India. \n \n(iii)  Cross-border haulage to the access gateway \u2013 Both Nepal and Bhutan will \nneed to haul the internet capacity to their respective Access Gateways. The cost \nused for this analysis was confirmed by the individual in-country carriers through \nthe consultation process. \n \n8.  Table A12.1 shows the comparable cost for internet capacity. Incremental revenues \nincurred to India and Bangladesh as a result of the Project was computed by summing total \nrevenues collecting from Nepal and Bhutan for their access to CLS. The increased capacity for \nBhutan and Nepal was assumed to be absorbed for a period of 5 years after completion of the \nSASECRN. \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 12  65\nTable A12.1: Comparable Cost for Internet Capacity \nItem  Rail Tel  PGCI  BSNL \nInternational internet cost   $ 500.00   $ 500.00    $ 500.00 \nIn-country internet haulage cost   $ 149.69   $ 104.61    $ 146.13 \nIn-country haulage costs \n   Bhutan terrestrial network   $ 73.03   $ 73.03    $ 73.03 \n   Nepal terrestrial network   $ 55.35   $ 55.35    $ 55.35 \nPer megabyte per month cost for  $ 722.72 $ 677.64 $ 719.16\nBhutan \nPer megabyte per month cost for Nepal  $705.04 $ 659.96 $701.48\nVSAT cost per megabyte per month  \ncurrently paid by Bhutan and Nepal: \n$1,500 \n \nPotential per megabyte per month cost  $ 777.28 $ 822.36 $ 780.84\nsavings for Bhutan  \nPotential per megabyte per month cost  $ 794.96 $ 840.04 $ 798.96\nsavings for Nepal  \n \nCurrent capacity (megabytes per  40 40 40\nmonth) of Bhutan through VSAT \nCurrent capacity (megabytes per  200 200 200\nmonth) of Nepal through VSAT \n \nCost saving per month for Bhutan  $ 31,091.20 $32,894.40 $ 31,233.60\nCost saving per month for Nepal  $158,992.00 $168,008.00 $159,792.00\nBSNL = bharat sanchar nigam ltd., PGCI = power grid corporation of India, VSAT = very small \naperture terminals, \nSource: Consultant\u2019s report. \n2.  SASEC Village Network  \n \n9.  Agriculture  Productivity  Increase.  Research  suggests  that  increasing  agricultural \nproductivity  benefits  the  poor  and  landless  through  increased  employment  opportunities. \nConsidering the vast majority of poor people live in rural areas and derive their livelihoods \ndirectly or indirectly from agriculture, support for farming is a high priority for rural development. \nICT can deliver useful information/data to farmers in the form of crop care, animal husbandry, \nfertilizer and feedstock inputs, drought mitigation, pest control, irrigation, weather forecasting, \nseed sourcing and market demand and prices. Again India has shown the way forward in the \ndelivery of economic benefits through ICT deployment in agriculture. An illustration is the use of \na network of tele-centers to coordinate the planting of tomatoes in order to achieve a constant \nsupply to the markets at a more regulated and regular price. Previously the farmers unknowingly \nharvested  their  produce  at  the  same  time  creating  an  oversupply  at  one  given  time  thus \nreducing price and conversely when there was a high demand, the produce was not available. \n \n10.  It  is  through  this  illustration  that  ICT  agricultural  enabled  applications  can  deliver \nsignificant economic benefit and the timely delivery of seasonal weather information will improve \nthe yield of certain crops, particularly rice. Current crop production of rice yields approximately \n20 quintals per acre at an average price of around $ 30 per quintal. The average crop yield is \nabout one per annum for a farmer with little forecasting information available. Given the correct \nweather information a farmer can triple his yield over one year by implementing preventive \n ", "66  Appendix 12 \ndrought measures, re-directing water supplies and preventive care measures for the farm.  As \nper the aforementioned illustration, this is achieved through the network delivering timely and \naccurate  information  to  the  farmers.  The  project  will  deliver  connectivity  to  110  rural \ncommunities where rice production is predominant. The mean acreage per community has been \nassessed at 5 acres and the additional yield per annum is assumed to be one fold of the current \nyields being experienced as an average throughout the member countries. This agricultural \nproductivity improvement is considered in the EIRR calculation.  \n \n11.  CeCs Employment Creation. There are 3 areas of employment opportunity that arises \nfrom the implementation of the Project, namely (i) unemployed people can use the network to \ndiscover job opportunities; (ii) they can become employed in new jobs that are created through \nthe deployment of ICTs; and (iii) they are up-skilled via specific education programs that support \nthe SASEC regional network and CEC deployment. Based on the India experience, the new job \ncreation delivered from the opening of telecenters is about 2 new jobs per centre. The up-\nskilling of employed people is about the same per telecenter location once delivery either from \ndistance learning programs or the use of appropriate training institutes. For this analysis the \nnew job creation has been assessed at the lowest possible earning capacity and being a mean \nacross the member countries of $ 50 per month and an up-skilled worker (being employed on \nthe lowest possible earning capacity) incremental change being an additional $ 30 per month. \nThis improvement is considered in the EIRR calculation.  \n \nC.  EIRR and Sensitivity Analysis \n \n12.  The  EIRR  of  the  Project  was  estimated  at  34.3%.  The  economic  cost  and  benefit \nstreams are in Table A12.2. The sensitivity of the EIRR was tested for the cases (i) when no \nindirect benefits are included; (ii) when the project benefits are reduced by 20%; (ii) when the \nproject cost increases by 20%; and (iv) when case (ii) and case (iii) are combined.
