A  summary  of  the  environmental  impact  assessment  was \ncirculated  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Board  along  with  the \nenvironmental  management  plan  on  2  August  2006,  and  uploaded  onto \nthe ADB website on 3 August 2006. \n \n\n \nProject Description  The Project is a key urban infrastructure initiative of the Nanjing municipal \ngovernment  (NMG).  It  is  classified  as  a  targeted  intervention  because  it \ncontributes to achieving Millennium Development Goal 7, target 10, which \ncalls for halving, by 2015, the proportion of people without access to safe \ndrinking water and improved sanitation. The Project will help Nanjing, the \ncapital  city  of  Jiangsu  Province,  in  (i)  reducing  water  pollution;  (ii) \nprotecting  water  resources;  (iii)  reducing  economic  losses and  disruption \nto  livelihoods  from  frequent  localized  flooding;  (iv)  promoting  sustainable \neconomic  development;  (v)  improving  the  environment,  living  conditions, \nand public health standards; (vi) developing an integrated wastewater and \nsludge management system; and (vii) improving service efficiency through \nincreased competition and private sector participation.  \n \nThe Project includes 10 major activities grouped into six components: (i) \nInner  Qinhuai  River  sewerage  and  water  replenishment,  (ii)  City  East \nwastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and sewerage system, (iii) North He \nXi  District  sewerage,  river  improvement,  and  water  replenishment,  (iv) \nstormwater  drainage,  (v)  sludge  treatment  and  disposal  component,  and \n(vi) institutional development. All components of the Project contribute to \nsignificantly  improving  water  quality  of  the  Qinhuai  River,  which  empties \ninto the Yangtze River. The Project supports the Government\u2019s 11th Five-\nYear Plan, which includes goals of improving living conditions and health \nin cities and promoting their sustainable economic development. \n \nThe  Project  represents  a  comprehensive  approach  including  close \ncooperation  with  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  to  support  NMG\u2019s  11th \nFive-Year  Plan,  which  includes  expansion  of  the  city\u2019s  water  and \nwastewater  treatment  capacity.  NMG  is  planning  to  issue  a  water  bond, \none  of  the  first  in  the  PRC.  In  support,  ADB  is  implementing  a  technical \nassistance  (TA)  for  Nanjing  Water  Utility  Long-Term  Capital  Finance  in \nCommercial  Markets.  It  is  also  processing  the  Nanjing  Water  Utility \nDevelopment  Project, which  will  provide  a  partial  credit  guarantee  for  up \nto 50% of a bond issue by Nanjing Public Utilities Company, a subsidiary \nof Nanjing Construction Investment Company Limited (NCIC). NCIC is the \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRationale \n\nImplementing Agency (IA) for the wastewater treatment component under \nthe  proposed  Project.  Significant  synergies  have  been  derived  from  the \npublic-private approach to improving Nanjing\u2019s urban environment. Policy \ndialogue and promotion of wastewater tariff reforms, rigorous assessment \nof  safeguard  issues,  and  capacity-building  measures  to  be  undertaken \nthrough  the  proposed  Project  will  support  the  Nanjing  Water  Utility \nDevelopment  Project.  The \ntwo  projects  are  autonomous  and  not \ninterdependent.  The  public-private  sector  approach  to  the  wastewater \ntreatment  sector  could be  replicated  elsewhere  in  the  PRC,  and  in  other \ndeveloping member countries.  \n \nNanjing  comprises  11  districts  and  two  counties  and  is  strategically \nlocated at the confluence of the Qinhuai and Changjiang rivers or Yangtze \nRiver basin (YRB), in eastern PRC. Nanjing municipality has a population \nof  6.4  million,  and  an  urban  center  population  of  4.5  million.  Rapid \neconomic growth in Nanjing over the past 20 years has placed increased \npressure on the environment and city infrastructure. The Qinhuai River is \n110 kilometers (km) long and flows through the urban districts of Nanjing \nbefore  joining  the  YRB.  Water  quality  in  the  lower  34  km  of  the  Qinhuai \nRiver  has  deteriorated  significantly  in  the  past  10  years  mainly  due  to \nwastewater discharge from the city; it currently fails to achieve class V of \nthe PRC water quality standards.  \n \nThe lack of sufficient wastewater collection and treatment facilities and the \nincreasingly  severe  problems  related  to  water  pollution  and  urban \ndrainage  have  resulted  in  serious  water  quality  problems  in  the  Qinhuai \nRiver. This has resulted in significant deterioration of water quality in the \nNanjing  section  of  the  YRB.  NMG  is  implementing  the  city\u2019s  strategic \nwastewater  master  plan  to  meet  national  environmental  targets  and \nachieve  a  wastewater  treatment  rate  of  85%  by  2010.  The  proposed \nProject  is  an  integrated  part  of  the  basin-wide  Yangtze  water  resources \nmanagement  initiative,  the  Nanjing  city  urban  development  plan,  the \nNanjing  municipal  wastewater  master  plan,  and  the  Nanjing  stormwater \ndrainage master plan. The Project will provide the 10% additional capacity \ncritical  to  achieving  the  city\u2019s  target  for  2010  of  treating  85%  of  the \nwastewater generated compared with the current rate of 75%.  \n \nThe high intensity of rainfall in Nanjing places the urban drainage system \nunder  stress;  sewers  overflow  and  become  major  sources  of  water \npollution.  Flooding  in  urban  areas  is  often  serious  because  of  the \ninadequately  maintained  drainage  network  and  pumping  stations  with \ninsufficient capacity. Nanjing does not have a consistent sludge treatment \nand  disposal  scheme.  Historically,  the  Qinhuai  River\u2019s  tributaries  were \ninterconnected  with  sufficient  flow  capacity,  but  siltation  has  greatly \nreduced flows from these waterways. At some locations flow is completely \nblocked,  aggravating  flooding  and  water  pollution.  Augmentation  of  river \nflow,  and  improved  flood  control  and  water  quality  are  urgently  needed \nthrough (i) river dredging, (ii) river bank stabilization and erosion control, \n(iii)  river  water  diversion  and  replenishment,  and  (iv)  restoration  of  the \ndegraded urban wetland area. By significantly improving the water quality \nin  the  Qinhuai  River  from  the  current  class  V  to  class  IV  by  2011,  the \n\n\f \n\nvii\n\nProject  will  complement  the  Wuhan  Wastewater  Management  Project, \nWuhan  Wastewater  and  Stormwater  Management  Project,  and  Suzhou \nCreek  Rehabilitation  Project,  which  all  contribute  to  reducing  pollution  in \nthe  YRB.  Since  the  drinking  water  intakes  of  Nanjing  and  other  major \ncities  downstream  are  from  the  Yangtze  River,  the  Project  will  also \ncontribute to protecting the drinking water source.  \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  urban  environment,  public \nhealth,  and  quality  of  life  of  urban  residents  and  businesses  in  Nanjing \nCity.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  is  improved  management  of  surface \nwater resources in Nanjing.  \n \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $236.1 million, including \ntaxes and duties. \n \n\n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nNanjing Municipal Government \nCofinancing: China Development Bank \n \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n100.0 \n81.2 \n54.9 \n236.1 \n\n \nPercent \n42 \n35 \n23 \n100 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nA  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will  be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)\u2013based \nlending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period \nof 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-\nbased  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and \nsuch other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nThe ADB loan will finance 42% of the project cost. NMG will finance 58% \nthrough  a  combination  of  wastewater  tariffs  ($20  million),  NMG  budget \nsources, and a domestic loan from the China Development Bank. \n \nThe  PRC  Government  will  relend  the  loan  proceeds  to  the  Jiangsu \nprovincial  government,  which  will  onlend  the  loan  proceeds  to  NMG,  the \nExecuting Agency, on the same principle terms and conditions as those of \nthe ADB loan, including the interest rate, tenor, and grace period. Part of \nthe  loan  proceeds  will  be  onlent  to  NCIC,  the  IA  for  the  City  East  river \nimprovement, wastewater treatment, and sewerage activities on the same \nterms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. The balance of the loan \nwill  be  applied  directly,  on  behalf  of  NMG,  by  Nanjing  Drainage \nManagement  Department  (NDMD),  the  IA  for  the  stormwater  activities, \nand  Nanjing  Municipal  Engineering  Construction  Department  (NMECD), \nthe  IA  for  Inner  Qinhuai  River  sewerage  and  water  replenishment,  North \nHe Xi District sewerage, river improvement and water replenishment, and \nthe  sludge  treatment  activities.

A fully staffed Nanjing project management \noffice, established for the Project, will act as the secretariat of the project \nleading group, and coordinate and monitor implementation activities of the \nthree IAs.  \n \n\n \nADB-financed  equipment,  materials  and  goods,  works,  and  services  will \nbe procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006), as \namended  from  time  to  time.  Procurement  will  be  coursed  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding,  national  competitive  bidding,  or \nshopping  procedures  as  determined  by  the  particular  circumstances  of \neach  contract  package. \nIn  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines,  foreign  contractors  may  participate  in  bidding  for  national \ncompetitive bidding contracts. \n \nAbout  31  person-months  of  international  consulting  and  100  person-\nmonths  of  national  consulting,  to  be  funded  under  the  Project,  will  be \nrequired  to  support  the  project  management  office  and  IAs  in  project \nimplementation and capacity building. Consulting services will be provided \nin  the  following  specific  areas:  (i)  development  of  a  sludge  management \nstrategy for Nanjing, (ii) investigation and control of inflow and infiltration \ninto  the  wastewater  collection  network,  (iii)  construction  supervision  and \nfinancial  management,  and  (v)  operation  and \nquality  control,  (iv) \nmaintenance \ninternational  consultants  will  also \nprovide  training  and  capacity  building  in  wastewater  management  and \ntreatment  planning,  water  quality  management,  financial  management, \nand  environmental  monitoring  and  management.  Consultant  recruitment \nwill  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2006),  as \namended from time to time.  \n \nThe  Project  will  benefit  about  2.7  million  urban  residents  of  Nanjing, \nwhose  living  conditions  and  public  health  standards  will  improve  as  a \nresult  of  (i)  reduced  pollution  of  Nanjing\u2019s  surface  water,  (ii)  protection \nfrom  flooding  and  elimination  of  hazards  associated  with  poor  drainage, \nand  (iii)  reduction  in  the  incidence  of  waterborne  infectious  diseases  to \nbelow the 2005/06 level of 43 per 1,000 people. The Project will improve \nthe  management  of  surface  water  resources  in  Nanjing  by  (i)  achieving \n\nimprovements.  The \n\n \nConsulting \nServices \n\n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n\f \n\nix\n\ntreatment  of  85%  of  wastewater  generated  by  2010  and  significantly \nreducing  annual  pollution  loads  in  the  Qinhuai  River  and  thereby  in  the \nYRB; (ii) significantly reducing flooding in urban areas; (iii) increasing the \nefficiency  and  management  capacity  of  the  IAs;  and  (iv)  improving  cost \nrecovery  through  a  better  tariff  structure,  with  gradual  increases  to \nachieve full cost recovery. The water quality improvements in the Qinhuai \nRiver and subsequently in the Nanjing section of the YRB  will contribute \nto  integrated  water  resource  management  and  pollution  control,  basin \nmanagement,  and  transboundary  pollution  prevention  and  control.  The \nstormwater  management  component  will  improve  flood  control  in  urban \nareas by (i) improving the drainage-sewerage network; and (ii) separating \nstormwater and wastewater flows into different systems, and rehabilitating \ndefective pipes. This will minimize waterborne disease; accidents; injuries \nand loss of life; and damage to property, agriculture, and infrastructure. \n \nThe  Project  will  create  at  least  450  full-time  permanent  jobs  with  NCIC, \nNDMD, and NMECD for the operation of the facilities; and 6,000 person-\nyears  of  work  during  the  5  years  of  construction.  More  than  40%  of  the \nconstruction  jobs  are  expected  to  be  filled  by  the  poor  and  vulnerable, \nincluding  the  unemployed,  rural  migrants,  and  women.  Public  health \nbenefits  will  accrue  through  an  estimated  reduction  in  medical  costs \nincurred  as  a  result  of  decreasing  waterborne  diseases,  amounting  to \napproximately CNY142 per person per year. The financing of wastewater \ntreatment infrastructure directly from wastewater tariff increases will have \na demonstration impact on wastewater tariff reform in both the PRC and \nelsewhere  in  Asia.  The  Project  is  technically  sound,  affordable  to \nbeneficiaries, and financially and economically viable.  \n \nPotential  institutional,  financial,  and  policy  risks  related  to  the  Project \ninclude  failure  of  NMG  to  (i)  implement  institutional  strengthening  for \neffective project management, (ii) increase water and wastewater tariffs to \nmeet  cost-recovery  targets,  and  (iii)  meet  the  equity  requirements  to \nimplement  the  Project.  These  risks  have  been  mitigated  by  (i)  obtaining \nassurances  from  the  Jiangsu  provincial  government  and  NMG  on  the \nfinancial  and  managerial  autonomy  of \ninstitutional \nstrengthening of the IAs; (ii) periodic water tariff reviews and adjustments \nfollowing the national guidelines; and (iii) provision of counterpart funding. \nADB  review  missions  will  monitor  compliance  with  the  financial  and \noperational covenants to ensure the IAs are financially sustainable. \n \nThe Project does not have any unusual technical risks. The components \nwill  use  standard  technology  that  conforms  to  international  standards. \nSpecific  construction  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  the  use  of  experienced \nconsultants to prepare designs and monitor project implementation.  \n\nIAs,  and \n\nthe \n\n \n\nRisks \nand Assumptions \n\n \n\n\fo\n121  00\u2019E\n\no\n110  00\u2019E\n\no\n120  00\u2019E\n\nJILIN\n\nINNER  MONGOLIA\n\nTieling\n\nShenyang\n\nLIAONING\n\nJingzhou\n\nDandong\n\nJining\n\nZhangjiakou\n\nHohhot\n\nShanhaiguan\n\nYingkou\n\no\n40  00\u2019N\n\no\n40  00\u2019N\n\nYinchuan\n\nLiulin\n\nSHAANXI\n\nBEIJING\n\nTianjin\n\nTangshan\nTIANJIN\n\nBohai\nSea\n\nDalian\n\nTaiyuan\n\nHEBEI\nShijiazhuang\n\nYantai\n\nShuyang\nSHANXI\n\nXinxian\n\nJinan\n\nSHANDONG\n\nQingdao\n\nYellow  Sea  \n\nLianyungang\n\nWeinan\n\nLuoyang Zhangzhou\n\nXuzhou\n\nJIANGSU\n\nBaoji\n\nXi'an\n\nSanmenxia\n\nHENAN\n\nNanchang\n\no\n30  00\u2019N\n\nHUBEI\n\nWuhan\n\nChongqing\nCHONGQING\no\n110  00\u2019E\n\nHUNAN\n\nJiujiang\n\nNanchang\n\nZHEJIANG\n\no\n120  00\u2019E\n\nHefei\n\nNanjing\n\nANHUI\nAnqing\n\nHangzhou\n\nJingdezhen\n\nShanghai\n\nSHANGHAI\no\n30  00\u2019N\n\nNingbo\n\nNANJING QINHUAI\nRIVER ENVIRONMENTAL\nIMPROVEMENT PROJECT\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\no\n32  00\u2019N\n\no\n118  00\u2019E\n\nS H A N D O N G\n\nFeng Xian\n\nPei Xian\n\nHENAN\n\no\n34  00\u2019N\n\nChia Wang\n\nXuzhou\n\nXinyi\n\nPei Xian\n\nGanyu\n\nLianyungang\n\nGuanyun\n\nShuyang\n\nSuqian\n\nSiyang\n\nQingjiang\n\nHuaiyin\n\nY e l l o w     S e a\n\nLianyungang\n\nXiangshui\n\nBinhai\n\nFuning\n\nSheyang\n\no\n34  00\u2019N\n\nNINGXIA\n\nA N H U I\n\nSihong\n\nHuai\u2019an\n\nJianhu\n\nLongse\n\nYancheng\n\nHongze Lake \n\nBaoying\n\nDafeng\n\nXuyi\n\nXinghua\n\nDongtai\n\nGaoyu Lake\n\nGaoyou\n\nJ I A N G S U\n\nTai Xian\n\nHai\u2019an\n\nLuhe\n\nYangzhou\n\nRugoo\n\nRudong\n\nTaizhou\n\nJiangdu\n\nZhenjiang\n\nJiangpu\n\nNANJING\n\nDaiyang\n\nJiangning\n\nJurong\n\nPROJECT AREA\n\nJintan\n\nA N H U I\n\nLishui\n\nGaochun\n\nNantong\n\nNantong\n\nJiangyin\n\nZhangjiagang\n\nHainen\n\nY\n\na\n\nn\n\ng\n\nJingjiang\n\ntz\neRiver\n\nChangzhou\n\nWuxi\n\nQidong\n\nChangsu\n\nTaicang\n\nKunshan\n\nSuzhou\n\nYangtze River\n\nSHANGHAI\n\nLiyang\n\nYixing\n\nTai Lake\n\nWujiang\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\no\n32  00\u2019N\n\nN\n\nKilometers\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nNational Road\n\nOther Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n0\n6\n-\n3\n2\n0\n2\na\n \nH\nR\n\no\n118  00\u2019E\n\nZ H E J I A N G\n\no\n121  00\u2019E\n\nM\na\np\n \n1\n\n\fNANJING QINHUAI RIVER\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\nIV.\n\nStormwater Drainage Component\n\nIII.\n\nIII.\n\nHe Xi District Sewerage, River\nImprovement, and Water Replenishing\nComponent\nSewerage Subcomponent\n\nHe Xi District Sewerage, River\nImprovement, and Water Replenishing\nComponent\nRiver Improvement, and Water\nReplenishing Subcomponent\n\nV.\n\nSludge Treatment and Disposal\nComponent\nJiang Xin Zhou Wastewater Treatment Plant\nSludge Treatment Facility \n\nII.\n\nCity East Wastewater Treatment\nPlant and Sewerage Component\nCity East River Improvement\nSubcomponent\n\nNew Qinhuai   R.\n\nRiver\n\ne\n\nz\n\nt\n\ng\n\nn\n\nY a\n\nI.\n\nInner Qinhuai River Sewerage and\nWater Replenishing Component\nInner Qinhuai River Sewerage\nSubcomponent\n\nI.\n\nII.\n\nInner Qinhuai River Sewerage and\nWater Replenishing Component\nInner Qinhuai River Water Replenishing\nSubcomponent\n\nCity East Wastewater Treatment\nPlant and Sewerage Component\nCity East Wastewater Treatment Plant\nSubcomponent\n\nWetland Park\n\nYUHUATAI\nAREA\n\nJIANGNING\nAREA\n\nII.\n\nCity East Wastewater Treatment\nPlant and Sewerage Component\nCity East Sewerage Subcomponent\n\n0\n6\n-\n3\n2\n0\n2\nb\n \nH\nR\n\nV.\n\nSludge Treatment and Disposal\nComponent\nMunicipal Sludge Disposal Facility \n\nM\na\np\n \n2\n\nII.\n\nCity East Wastewater Treatment\nPlant and Sewerage Component\nCity East River Improvement\nSubcomponent\n\nQ\n\ni\n\nn\n\nh\n\nu\n\na\n\ni\n\n \n\nR\n\ni\n\nv\n\ne\n\nr\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Nanjing Qinhuai River Environmental Improvement \nProject.  In  line  with  its  long-term  goals  for  the  urban  sector  of  improving  living  conditions, \nminimizing  flooding  incidents,  protecting  water  resources,  and  enhancing  wastewater  treatment \ncoverage,  the  PRC  Government  asked  for  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  in \nimplementing wastewater, stormwater, and sludge management, and river improvement projects \nin  Nanjing.  The  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  water  policy1 and  will  help  the  PRC  achieve \nMillennium  Development  Goal  7,  target  10,  which  calls  for  halving,  by  2015,  the  proportion  of \npeople without access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation. This report is based on the \nloan  Appraisal  Mission  and  discussions  with  the  central  and  local  governments,  relevant \nagencies, and community organizations. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nAnnual  economic  growth  in  the  PRC,  which  averaged  9%  over  the  last  20  years,  is \nprojected to average 7% over the next 5 years. The urban population has grown from about 190 \nmillion in 1980 to about 543 million in 2004, about 42% of the total population, and is expected to \nincrease  to  700  million  or  50%  by  2030.  The  Government\u2019s  Agenda  for  Economic  Reform  and \nSocial Development in the New Century2 aims to accelerate urbanization and the development of \nlarge,  medium,  and  small  cities  and  small  towns.  This  urbanization  process  will  continue  to \nincrease the demand for all urban services. In particular, it will place a strain on the physical and \nfinancial capacity of most cities to provide adequate urban infrastructure such as wastewater and \nsludge  management,  and  stormwater  facilities.  Without  significant  infrastructure  investment,  the \nquality  of  life  for  urban  residents  and  the  urban  environment  will  deteriorate,  and  economic \ndevelopment will be inefficient. \n \n3. \nThe  PRC\u2019s  urban  areas  face  environmental  threats  from  pollution  of  rivers,  lakes,  and \nunderground  aquifers  from  untreated  water.  In  2004,  about  48.2  billion  cubic  meters  (m3)  of \nwastewater were generated: about 54% from municipal sources and 46% from industrial sources. \nCurrently, about 90% of industrial wastewater is treated before discharge to a municipal sewer. \nMunicipal wastewater is a major contributor to pollution of the PRC\u2019s rivers and lakes. As of 2004, \nonly  about  45.2%  (34%  in  1999)  of  urban  wastewater  was  treated;  the  rest  was  discharged \nuntreated to rivers and lakes. About 41.8% of the water in the seven major river basins3 does not \nmeet the class III4 national water quality standard. Surface water sources serving municipal water \nsupply systems are polluted to levels unacceptable under water quality standards. To address the \npollution  of  lakes  and  rivers,  the  following  actions  are  needed:  (i)  strengthen  laws  and \nenforcement,  regulations,  and  institutions  to  address  transjurisdictional  pollution;  (ii)  adopt  river \nbasin  management  approaches  for  water  resource  management;  (iii)  reduce  nonpoint  source \npollution;  (iv)  continue  investment  in  municipal  wastewater  treatment  plants  (WWTP),  sludge \nmanagement,  and  stormwater  drainage  systems  to  mitigate  the  polluting  effects  of  rapidly \nincreasing  urbanization;  (v)  diversify  financing  sources  for  environmental  investments;  and  (vi) \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2001. Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n2   The Government\u2019s long-term vision for development was set out during the 16th Party Congress in November 2000 \n\nand reiterated during the 10th National People\u2019s Congress in March 2003.  \n\n3   Changjiang (Yangtze River), Haihe, Huaihe, Huanghe Liaohe, Songhuajiang, and Zhujiang.  \n4  The  PRC  water  quality  standards  have  five  classes  of  quality  covering  about  40  pollution  parameters.  Class  I  is \npristine, while class V is suitable only for industrial use. Class III is the minimum water quality required for municipal \nwater supply. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ncontinue  with  institutional  and  financial  reforms  to  facilitate  balanced  economic  growth  and \nenvironmental  sustainability.  Significant  investments  are  needed  nationally  to  solve  water \nshortage  problems,  supply  clean  drinking  water,  expand  wastewater  treatment  capacity,  and \nreduce flooding.  \n \nRecognizing  that  adequate  environmental  protection  and  pollution  controls  are  essential \n4. \nfor  sustainable  economic  growth,  the  Government  incorporated  environmental  protection  as  a \nnational priority in its development strategy. In addition to enacting environmental protection laws \nand  implementing  regulations  that  emphasize  preventive  measures,  the  polluter  pays  principle, \nand decentralized environmental management, the Government has also undertaken numerous \nprograms  including  those  for  wastewater  management. 5  Industries  were  ordered  to  treat \nwastewater to national wastewater discharge standards by the end of 2000; municipalities have \nbeen  required  under  successive  5-year  plans  to  address  wastewater  collection,  treatment  and \ndisposal; and pollution control plans have been developed and partially implemented for the key \nriver  basins.  Government  policies  require  that  urban  environmental  pollution  and  ecological \ndamage  be  controlled  by  2010;  and  recent  state  guidelines  require  that  major  cities,  such  as \nprovincial capitals, have wastewater treatment rates of at least 80% by 2010 (Nanjing\u2019s target is \n85%).6 The State Environmental Protection Administration requires that all new WWTPs provide \nat least secondary wastewater treatment. The treatment level required is also dependent on the \nwater quality class of the receiving water. \n \n5. \nThe  Government  has  accorded  priority  in  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  to \naddressing  wastewater  treatment  issues  through  policy  reform,  increased  investment,  and \nimproved urban infrastructure management. The Government\u2019s strategy focuses on (i) protecting \ndrinking water sources by controlling industrial and other pollution in urban areas; (ii) introducing \nwater  efficient  technologies  and  operations;  and  (iii)  using  appropriate  pricing  mechanisms  to \nencourage  conservation  and  generate  necessary  funds  for  operation,  maintenance,  and \ninvestment. The Government\u2019s ongoing economic and enterprise reform programs require that all \nwastewater projects be financially sustainable and capable of cost recovery. The sector analysis \nis given in Appendix 2. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n \n\n6. \nTraditional urban wastewater management practice in the PRC was based on the use of \nseptic tanks. Rapidly increasing urbanization makes such an approach inadequate. Over the past \ndecade a fundamental shift has been to an integrated approach to urban water management and \nuse of centralized municipal wastewater treatment. Although much improvement has been made, \nthe  current  status  of  wastewater  management  still  provides  numerous  opportunities  to  reduce \nwater  pollution,  protect  water  resources,  and  improve  the  living  conditions  and  public  health  of \nurban and suburban residents. Key problems and opportunities in Nanjing include (i) worsening \nsurface  water  quality,  (ii)  inadequate  wastewater  treatment  capacity,  (iii)  lack  of  a  sludge \ntreatment  facility  and  disposal  site,  (iv)  inadequate  stormwater  discharge  capacity  resulting  in \nfrequent urban flooding, (v) high river siltation contributing to formation of organic substances that \npollute  rivers,  and  (vi)  the  need  for  ongoing  financial  and  institutional  reforms  to  make  urban \nservices sustainable. \n \n\n                                                 \n5  The PRC Law on Prevention and Control of Water Pollution was first adopted in 1984 and amended in 1996. The law \nwas enacted to prevent and control water pollution, protect and improve the environment, safeguard human health, \nand ensure effective utilization of water resources.  \n\n6  The national guidelines for construction of municipal wastewater treatment facilities require that all major cities have \na  wastewater  treatment  rate  of  at  least  80%  by  2010.  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  State \nEnvironmental Protection Administration, Ministry of Construction. 2005.  \n\n\f \n\n7. \nNanjing, the capital of Jiangsu Province, is a rapidly developing city with a population of \n6.4 million, of which 4.5 million is urban. Nanjing City comprises 11 districts and two counties that \nstraddle  the  Yangtze  River.  It  is  located  in  the  lower  reaches  of  the  Yangtze  River,  about  270 \nkilometers  (km)  to  the  northwest  of  Shanghai.  Nanjing  is  the  PRC  pilot  city  for  the  ADB  and \nUnited  Nations-HABITAT  jointly  sponsored  Water  for  Asian  Cities  program.7 Program  initiatives \npiloted  with  success  in  Nanjing  include  (i)  capacity  building  and  institutional  strengthening  to \nimprove  service  efficiency,  and  (ii)  water  education  and  awareness  creation  that  could  be \nreplicable  in  other  PRC  cities.  While  the  design  of  the  proposed  Project  complements  the \nobjectives  and  initiatives  of  the  Water  for  Asian  Cities  program,  the  initiatives  will  not  be \ninterdependent.  \n\n8. \nWater Quality in the Yangtze River Basin. The Yangtze River basin (YRB) is the largest \nriver  basin  in  the  PRC.  The  Changjiang  Water  Resources  Commission,  which  reports  to  the \nMinistry of Water Resources, has overall responsibility for managing water resources within the \nYRB.  The  commission  has  developed  a  basin  management  plan  that  provides  a  framework  for \nmanaging  water  resources  within  the  YRB.  The  plan  cites  the  deteriorating  water  quality  of \nYangtze River, and sets out a number of general pollution control targets with specific targets to \nbe developed by individual provinces and cities.  \n \n9. \nProject  Rationale.  Of  the  seven  major  rivers  in  the  PRC,  YRB  receives  the  highest \nvolume  of  total  wastewater  as  it  has  several  major  cities  along  its  riverbanks.  Effects  are  felt \nthroughout  the  downstream  reaches  and  in  the  East  China  Sea.  Despite  the  abundant  water \nresources, rapid economic growth and continuing urbanization over the last 20 years in Nanjing \nhave resulted in inadequate urban infrastructure, and placed pressure on overloaded facilities.  \n \n10. \nThe  Qinhuai  River,  referred  to  as  the  mother  river  of  Nanjing,  is  110  km  long  and  flows \nthrough the urban districts of Nanjing before joining the YRB. Water quality in the lower 34 km of \nthe  Qinhuai  River  has  deteriorated  significantly  in  the  past  10  years  mainly  due  to  wastewater \ndischarge from the city, and currently fails to achieve class V of the PRC water quality standards. \nIn  2004,  the  city  generated    2.46  million  m3/day  of  wastewater,  including  1.29  million  m3/day  of \nindustrial wastewater. The lack of sufficient wastewater collection and treatment facilities, and the \nincreasingly  severe  problems  related  to  water  pollution  and  urban  drainage  have  resulted  in \nserious water quality problems in the Qinhuai River. This has resulted in significant deterioration \nof  water  quality  in  the Nanjing  section  of  the YRB.  Accordingly,  NMG  is  implementing  the  city\u2019s \nstrategic  wastewater  master  plan  to  meet  national  environmental  targets  and  achieve  a \nwastewater treatment rate of 85% by 2010.  \n \n11. \nThe  proposed  Project  is  an  integrated  part  of  the  Yangtze  Basin  water  resources \nmanagement  initiative  being  implemented  by  the  Changjiang  Water  Resources  Commission, \nNanjing  City  urban  development  plan,  Nanjing  municipal  wastewater  master  plan,  and  Nanjing \nstormwater drainage master plan. Accordingly, the Project is consistent with the thrusts of ADB\u2019s \nwater  policy  and  Urban  Sector  Strategy.8 The  Project  will  provide  the  10%  additional  capacity \ncritical  to  achieving  the  city\u2019s  target  treating  85%  of  wastewater  generated  by  2010,  compared \nwith  the  current  rate  of  75%.  The  high  intensity  of  rainfall  in  Nanjing  places  the  urban  drainage \nsystem under stress. Sewers overflow and become major sources of water pollution, and flooding \nin  urban  areas  is  often  serious  because  of  the  inadequately  maintained  drainage  network  and \ninadequate  capacity  of  pumping  stations.  Nanjing  does  not  presently  have  a  consistent  sludge \ntreatment and disposal scheme. Consequently, a sludge treatment and disposal facility is urgently \n\n                                                 \n7  The  program  was  launched  at  the  Third  World  Water  Forum  on  18  March  2003,  when  a  memorandum  of \n\nunderstanding was signed between ADB and United Nations-Habitat.   \n\n8   ADB. 1999. Urban Sector Strategy. Manila. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nneeded to eliminate the potential of secondary pollution to the environment becoming even more \nserious.  Historically,  the  Qinhuai  River\u2019s  tributaries  were  interconnected  with  sufficient  flow \ncapacity;  but  siltation  has  greatly  reduced  flows  from  these  waterways.  At  some  locations  the \nflows are completely blocked, aggravating flooding and water pollution. River flow augmentation, \nflood control, and improved water quality are urgently needed through (i) river dredging, (ii) river \nbank  stabilization  and  erosion  control,  (iii)  river  water  diversion  and  replenishment,  and  (iv) \nrestoration of the degraded urban wetland area. By significantly improving the water quality in the \nQinhuai River from the current class V to class IV by 2011, the Project will complement the two \nongoing  Wuhan  projects,9 and  the  completed  Suzhou  Creek  Rehabilitation  Project,10 which  all \ncontribute to reducing pollution in the YRB. Since the drinking water intakes of Nanjing and other \nmajor downstream cities are from the Yangtze River, the Project also contributes to protection of \nthe vital drinking water source.  \n \nPolicy  Dialogue.  The  Project  supports  and  strengthens  ADB  policy  dialogue  and \n12. \ninitiatives  with  NMG  in  several  key  areas  including  (i)  cost  recovery  and  tariff  reform,  (ii) \nwastewater  management,  (iii)  water  conservation,  (iv)  corporate  governance  and  enterprise \nreform,  (v)  safe  and  reliable  arrangements  for  sludge  disposal,  (vi)  transboundary  pollution \nprevention  and  control,  (vii)  stormwater  management  arrangements,  and  (viii)  private  sector \nparticipation.  ADB  has  supported  the  water  tariff  reform  process  through  two  water  tariff  study \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  projects11 with  the  Ministry  of  Construction  under  which  the  market-\noriented  National  Guidelines  on  Water  Tariffs  were  developed,  promulgated,  and  implemented. \nThe  water  tariff  TAs  (i)  strengthened  the  financial  sustainability  of  municipal  water  supply \ncompanies; (ii) piloted implementation of the national guidelines in the selected case study cities \nof  Chengdu,  Fuzhou,  and  Zhangjiakou;  and  (iii)  recommended  financial  regulations  for  water \nsupply  companies  and  designed  nationwide  training  programs.  The  guidelines  are  being \nimplemented  nationally.  Further,  the  ADB  wastewater  tariff  study  TAs 12  developed  and \nrecommended national guidelines for wastewater tariffs, including tariff calculation methodologies \nthat  allow  for  full  cost  recovery  taking  into  consideration  affordability  and  social  constraints. \nNanjing Price Bureau performed a cost audit of the current and projected water, wastewater, and \nwater  resource  expenses;  and  held  public  hearing  meetings  on  28  August  2006  to  obtain \nendorsement for wastewater tariff increases from the current CNY1.05 per m3, to CNY1.40 per m3 \nby  December  2006,  and  CNY1.60  per  m3  by  2010.  This  indicates  Nanjing\u2019s  progressiveness  in \nadopting tariff reforms. The policy dialogue is in Appendix 3. \n \n13. \nExternal  Assistance.  Since  1993,  ADB  has  provided  15  loans  (Appendix  4)  totaling \napproximately $1.5 billion for urban wastewater management and water supply projects. ADB has \nalso  provided  about  $30  million  for  42  TA  studies  to  prepare  these  projects;  and  to  review  and \nstudy  key  issues  in  water  resources,  urban  water  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  and  pollution \ncontrol.  To  help  NMG  develop  and  implement  its  strategic  wastewater  master  plan,  external \nassistance to date has been provided by ADB, World Bank, and the governments of Finland and \nPoland.  ADB,  World  Bank,  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  and  several  bilateral \ndevelopment  partners  have  provided  financial  and  TA  to  the  PRC  Government  in  the  urban \nenvironmental  protection  and  management  subsector.

ADB\u2019s water supply loan projects in the PRC have generally been implemented \nwell. 13  The  lessons  identified  from  ADB\u2019s  post-evaluation  experience  in  water  supply  and \nsanitation  highlight  the  importance  of  integrating  both  supply  and  demand  concerns  into  project \ndesign.  Encouraging  broad  reforms,  such  as  commercial  management,  and  introducing \ncompetition  will  promote  efficient  and  responsive  delivery  of  water  supply  and  wastewater \nservices.  Appropriate  pricing  policies  for  water  and  sanitation  services  are  also  required.  Other \nlessons include the need to (i) review technical designs thoroughly; (ii) consider local conditions \nand constraints; (iii) support financial reform, particularly in establishing autonomous wastewater \nentities  and  tariff  increases  to  ensure  sustainability;  (iv)  strengthen  institutions,  particularly  by \ngiving  them  managerial  autonomy;  (v)  educate  the  public  in  environmental  improvement;  (vi) \nconsult  the  public  and  involve  the  community;  (vii)  address  resettlement  issues  early;  and  (viii) \nsupport  public-private  partnerships  in  water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment.  A  performance \nportfolio  review  of  the  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  waste  management  sector,  recently \ncompleted  by  the  PRC,  identified  successes  and  deficiencies,  and  lessons  from  portfolio \nperformance.14 Among the major issues identified were (i) delays in the start-up of projects and in \nprocurement,  (ii)  weak  institutional  arrangements  for  project  implementation  and  sustainable \noperations,  and  (iii)  a  low  proportion  of  civil  works  financing  resulting  in  loan  savings  and \ncancellation  of  surplus  loan  amounts.  These  issues  were  reviewed  in  detail  during  project \nprocessing  and  the  relevant  lessons  were  incorporated  in  the  project  design.  Lessons  from  the \nSuzhou Creek Rehabilitation Project include the need to (i) carefully design and establish project \nimplementation  arrangements  to  allow  effective  coordination  with  related  agencies,  (ii)  assess \ncapacity  to  implement  resettlement  activities,  (iii)  exercise  caution  in  estimating  water  supply \nsales and forecasts, and (iv) increase flexibility in the percentage of ADB financing for civil works \nto  prevent  potential  loan  cancellations.  These  lessons  have  been  incorporated  in  the  design  of \nthe proposed Project.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n15. \nThe impact of the Project is to improve the urban environment, public health, and quality \nof life of urban residents and businesses in Nanjing City.

Final  Report. \n\nManila.  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nreplenishment,  (iv)  stormwater  drainage,  (v)  sludge  treatment  and  disposal  component,  and  (vi) \ninstitutional  development.  All  the  components  will  contribute  to  significantly  improving  water \nquality in the Qinhuai River from the current class V and below, to at least class IV by 2011; and \nreducing pollution in the YRB. A detailed description of project components is in Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n \n17. \nInner  Qinhuai  River  Sewerage  and  Water  Replenishment.  This  component  will  (i) \nupgrade  the  Da  Zhong  Qiao  pumping  station  and  construct  9.6  km  of  sewer  interceptors  in  the \ncentral  and  southern  areas  of  the  Inner  Qinhuai  River;  and  (ii)  conduct  river  dredging, \nembankment  works,  and  river  water  diversion  and  replenishment  to  improve  the  inner  Qinhuai \nRiver  and  its  tributaries.  In  addition  to  improving  wastewater  interception,  this  component  will \naugment the river flow, improve water quality through flushing, and remove silt through dredging, \nthereby increasing the flood storage capacity of the Qinhuai River and its tributaries.   \n  \n18. \nCity East Wastewater Treatment Plant and Sewerage System. This component will (i) \nconstruct 23.2 km of sewer pipelines in the south and north districts of the Qinhuai River; (ii) add \nadditional  treatment  capacity  of  100,000  m3/day  to  the  existing  WWTP  including  a  sludge \ndewatering  facility,  tertiary  filtration  and  ultraviolet  disinfection,  and  outlet  pumping  station \nequipment; (iii) improve the Upper Qinhuai River (18 km), a tributary of Qinhuai River, from Xi Bei \nvillage  to  the  Yunliang  River  by  strengthening  the  embankment  foundation  and  water  proofing, \ndredging,  and  providing  water  and  soil  conservation;  (iv)  improve  the  South  River  (9.8  km),  a \ntributary  of  the  Qinhuai  River,  by  strengthening  and  waterproofing  the  embankment  foundation, \nand dredging; and (iv) restore the ecology of 1.5 km of the embankment for the Yunliang River, \nand  construct  an  ecological  wetland  park  (33  ha)  at  the  confluence  of  the  Yunliang  and  Outer \nQinhuai rivers. This component will help to achieve Nanjing\u2019s wastewater treatment rate target of \n85% by 2010. Further, it will improve the flushing, water quality, and flood storage capacity of the \nQinhuai River and its tributaries. The wetland park subcomponent will restore a derelict site into a \nlowland wetland that was functional some 30 years ago. The wetland park (i) is part of Nanjing \nCity\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Plan  targets  for  green  space;  (ii)  reduces  the  adverse  impacts  of  existing \nland  use  and  would  contribute  to  improvement  of  water  quality,  flood  storage,  and  habitat \nconservation;  and  (iii)  provides  recreational  and  educational  opportunities  to  demonstrate \nemerging conservation technologies.   \n \n19. \nNorth He Xi District Sewerage, River Improvement, and Water Replenishment. This \ncomponent  will  (i) construct  28.7 km  of  sewer  pipelines  in the  northern  area  of  North  He  Xi;  (ii) \nimprove the Long Jiang River and Qing Jiang North Aqueduct by dredging and constructing 450 \nmeters  (m)  of  box  culvert;  (iii)  improve  the  water  balance  in  the  Long  Jiang  area  by  (a) \nconstructing  diversion  pipelines  and  two  new  gates  on  Zhong  Bao  River,  and  (b)  upgrading \ngravity culverts for the Xiao Dou Men and Li Wei pumping stations; and (iv) replenish the central \nand south regions of North He Xi District by constructing a new South River pumping station with \nultimate  capacity  of  5  m3  per  second.  This  component  will  help  achieve  Nanjing\u2019s  wastewater \ntreatment rate target of 85% by 2010 and improve the flushing, water quality, and flood storage \ncapacity of the Qinhuai River and its tributaries. For the above three components, as a result of \nincreasing  the  wastewater  treatment  and  collection  capacity,  adequate  flushing  and  water \nexchange,  strengthening  the  river  embankment  foundations,  improving  the  river,  and  providing \nbenefits of flood protection, significant improvement of water quality and ecological landscape will \nbe achieved. \n \nStormwater  Drainage  System. This component will construct 29 storm drain outlets and \n20. \n25 km of drainage pipelines, in the districts of Bai Xia, Gulou, Qinhuai, Xia Guan, and Xuanwu; \nthus  contributing  to  Nanjing\u2019s  stormwater  master  plan.  The  stormwater  component  will  enhance \nthe  performance  of  the  drainage  system  in  flooded  areas,  reduce  overflows  from  the  combined \n\n\fSpecial Features \n\nsewer  network  and  polluted  runoff  into  rivers,  and  significantly  improve  flood  control  in  several \nurban areas of Nanjing.  \n \n21. \nSludge Treatment and Disposal. This component will provide treatment and disposal of \nsewage  sludge  and  municipal  sludge  from  river  dredging  and  maintenance  of  the  pipeline \nnetwork. It will construct the (i) Jiang Xin Zhou WWTP sludge treatment facility with a capacity of \n80 tons/day (dry solid), and (ii) Mount Feng Huang sludge disposal facility with a capacity of 840 \nm3/day  and  the  leachate  collection  and  treatment  system.  Without  this  component,  secondary \npollution to the environment would become very serious.  \n \n22. \nInstitutional  Development.  This  component  will  (i)  carry  out  a  sludge  management \nstudy; (ii) provide training to strengthen organizational structure and staff resources to implement, \noperate,  and  maintain  the  project  components;  (iii)  strengthen  management  practices  in  human \nresources, finance, and corporate planning; and (iv) provide training programs for managers and \nstaff  responsible  for  service  delivery  to  ensure  efficient  implementation  and  sustainability  of \nproject  benefits.  The  Project  will  strengthen  institutional  capacity  to  facilitate  the  adoption  of  an \nintegrated approach to water resource management including pollution and flood control.  \n \nC. \n \nPublic-Private  Participation.  The  Project  takes  a  comprehensive  approach  including \n23. \nclose cooperation with ADB\u2019s private sector operations to support NMG\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan for \nexpansion  of  the  city\u2019s  water  and  wastewater  treatment  capacity.  NMG  is  planning  to  issue  a \nwater  bond,  one  of  the  first  in  the  PRC.  In  support,  ADB  is  implementing  an  advisory  TA  for \nNanjing  Water  Utility  Long-Term  Capital  Finance  in  Commercial  Markets,  and  processing  the \nNanjing Water Utility Development Project, which will provide a partial credit guarantee15 for up to \n50%  of  a  bond  issue  by  Nanjing  Public  Utilities  Company  (NPUC), 16 a  subsidiary  of  Nanjing \nConstruction Investment Company (NCIC) (the IA for the wastewater treatment component under \nthe  proposed  Project).  The  advisory  TA  supported  NCIC  and  NPUC  by  (i)  building  capacity, \nincluding  management  structuring,  and  developing  corporate  governance  best  practices;  (ii) \ndeveloping accounting and auditing practice in line with best international practices; (iii) preparing \nthe bond application; and (iv) providing a shadow bond rating and issuer rating exercise. NPUC \nplans  to  use  the  proceeds  from  the  bond  issue  for  capital  expenditure  requirements  for  seven \nnew water and wastewater treatment projects in Nanjing. The structure, mechanics, and details of \nADB\u2019s  partial  credit  guarantee  will  be  determined  during  the  due  diligence  expected  to  be \ncompleted  in  November  2006,  to  be  followed  by  the  Credit  Committee  meeting  scheduled  for \nDecember 2006. The proposed partial credit guarantee is expected to be submitted to the ADB \nBoard for consideration within the first quarter of 2007. \n \n24. \nto \ncomprehensively improving the urban environment in Nanjing. The successful policy dialogue on \nwastewater \nissues  and  compliance \nrequirements,  and  capacity-building  measures  undertaken  by  the  proposed  Project  will  support \nthe  Nanjing  Water  Utility  Development  Project.  NMG  has  confirmed  the  counterpart  financing \nsources for the Project. However, NMG during implementation would have the option to replace \nsome of the committed counterpart funds for the Project with funds generated from the potential \nbond  issue.  The  Nanjing  Water  Utility  Development  Project  and  the  proposed  Project  are \nautonomous but mutually supportive. The public-private approach in Nanjing could be replicated \n\nSignificant  synergies  have  been  derived \n\nthorough  examination  of  safeguard \n\nthe  public-private  approach \n\ntariff  reforms, \n\nfrom \n\n                                                 \n15  The concept paper for the project was approved by Management on 9 October 2006. \n16  Currently, the application for bond issuance is pending with the National Development and Reform Commission.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nin  the  upcoming  Jilin  Urban  Infrastructure  Project17 in  Jilin  Province  and  elsewhere  in  the  PRC. \nThe  bond  issue  represents  a  new  avenue  of  financing,  facilitated  through  the  bond  guarantee \nprovided by the private sector, ensuring that the water utilities sector in the PRC will have access \nto  finance  the  significant  demand  in  water  and  wastewater  treatment  infrastructure  investment \nneeds. \n \n25. \nTariff  Reform.  NMG  has  committed  to  generate  funds  to  finance  the  wastewater \ncomponents  of  the  Project  from  wastewater  tariff  increases  estimated  at  $20  million.  This  is  a \nmajor  reform  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Water  Policy  (2001).  NMG  held  public  hearing  meetings  on  28 \nAugust 2006 to obtain endorsement for wastewater tariff increases, from the current CNY1.05 per \nm3, to CNY1.40 per m3 by December 2006, and CNY1.60 per m3 by 2010. These significant tariff \nreforms contribute to sustainability of the Project and to private sector participation initiatives.   \n \nEnvironmental  Aspects.  The  Project  includes  (i)  training  in  the  operation  and \n26. \nmaintenance  (O&M)  of  wastewater  and  stormwater  facilities  to  ensure  effective  operation;  (ii) \nmonitoring  of  future  performance  of  O&M  of  the  wastewater  and  stormwater  facilities  using  a \nnumber of indicators outlined in the design and  monitoring framework;  (iii) demonstration of the \npotential  economic  benefits  of  an  integrated  and  strategic  long-term  approach  to  planning  of \nwastewater,  sludge  treatment,  and  stormwater  infrastructure  facilities; and  (iv)  assistance in  the \ndevelopment  of  Qinhuai  River  water  quality  modeling  including  ambient  water  monitoring  to \nprotect  water  resources,  promote  sustainable  economic  development,  and  improve  the  living \nconditions and public health of urban residents.  \n \n27. \nGovernance  and  Anticorruption.  The  additional  governance  and  anticorruption \nmeasures,  including  the  requirement  to  enhance  and  develop  the  project  website  to  contain \ninformation  on  project  audited  financial  statements,  the  status  of  procurement  and  contract \nawards,  tariff  increases,  and  a  schedule  for  public  hearings,  will  contribute  to  the  principle  of \ntransparency,  accountability,  and  zero-tolerance  for  corruption.  There  are  also  obligations  to \nconduct  performance  audits,  and  various  forms  of  public  disclosure,  public  hearing,  and \nrequirements to give reasons for administrative decisions. \n\n \n28. \nPro-Poor Features. NMG has agreed that prior to implementing any tariff increases, it will \nreview and conduct research to determine the number of poor people likely to be affected by the \nwastewater tariff increases, and prepare a plan or scheme including price subsidies and lifeline \ntariffs to contribute to cushioning the impact of tariff increases on the poor. NMG will issue this as \na decree.  \n \n29. \nOptimum  Design.  Through  rigorous  least-cost  analysis  and  engineering  consulting,  the \ntechnical  design  of  the  Project  was  optimized.  Consequently,  the  resettlement  impact  of  the \nProject was reduced by 30%, resulting in a reduction of the resettlement cost. \n \n30. \nEmployment,  Labor,  and  Health.  The Project reflects assurances that the Government \nwill  ensure  that  (i)  equal  employment  opportunities  be  provided  for  men  and  women,  (ii) \ninformation be given to employees on sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/Aids, (iii) awareness \nis increased on the health impacts of wastewater, and (iv) child labor be prohibited.   \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n17  The TA (ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Jilin Urban Infrastructure Project. \nManila) is ongoing. The Government has expressed interest for a public-private participation approach based on the \nNanjing experience. \n\n\fProject Investment Plan \n\nD. \n \n31. \nThe project investment is estimated at $236.1 million, including taxes and duties.

The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period \nof 5 years, an interest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate  (LIBOR)\u2013based  lending  facility  for  US  dollar  loans,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per \nannum,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The \nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-\nbased  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that \nthese choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication \nor advice from ADB.  \n \n33. \nThe ADB loan will finance 42% of the project cost. NMG will finance the contingencies \nand  interest  during  construction.  Local  costs  will  be  financed  from  wastewater  treatment  fees, \n(estimated  at  $20  million),  urban  construction  fees,  and  domestic  loans  from  PRC  banks.  NMG \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nhas  issued  a  commitment  letter  confirming  the  counterpart  funds  including  the  equity  injection. \nFurther, the China Development Bank provided a commitment letter for the domestic bank loan \ncofinancing. The financing plan for the Project is summarized in Table 2.  \n\n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n \n\nSource \nA. Asian Development Bank \nB. Nanjing Municipal Government \nC.

NMG will onlend a portion of the loan proceeds to NCIC, which will implement the \nCity East river improvement, wastewater treatment, and sewerage component. NMG will onlend \nthe  balance  of  the  loan  proceeds  to  Nanjing  Drainage  Management  Department  (NDMD)  and \nNanjing  Municipal  Engineering  Construction  Department  (NMECD),  which  will  implement  the \nsludge  management,  stormwater  management,  and  river  replenishment  components.  NMG  will \nassume full financial responsibility for all the non-revenue-generating components. All onlending \nwill  be  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  the  ADB  loan.  The  end-borrower  for  the  revenue-\ngenerating  components  and  NMG  for  the  non-revenue-generating  components  will  assume  the \nforeign  exchange  and  interest  rate  variation  risks  of  the  ADB  loan.  The  flow  of  funds  and \nonlending arrangements are in Appendix 6.  \n \nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nProject Management \n\n1. \n \n\n35. \nNMG will be the Executing Agency. A project leading group has been established, headed \nby the vice mayor of NMG and comprising representatives from Nanjing Municipal Construction \nCommission,  Municipal  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  Planning  Bureau,  Finance \nBureau,  Environmental  Protection  Bureau,  Public  Utilities  Bureau,  and  Urban  Construction \nInvestment  Holding  (Group)  Co  Ltd.  The  group  will  provide  overall  policy  guidance,  facilitate \ninteragency coordination, and resolve any institutional problems affecting project implementation. \nA  fully  staffed  Nanjing  project  management  office  (PMO)  has  been  established  for  the  Project. \nThe PMO will also be the secretariat of the project leading group. The three IAs are  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nNCIC  for  the  City  East  WWTP  and  sewerage  component  which  includes  sewer \npipelines, wastewater treatment plant, and river improvement;  \nNDMD for the stormwater drainage component and  \nNMECD \nInner  Qinhuai  River  sewerage  and  water  replenishment \ncomponent;  North  He  Xi  District  sewerage,  river  improvement,  and  water \nreplenishment component; and sludge treatment and disposal component.  \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\n \n36. \nOn  completion  of  the  Project,  NCIC  will  be  responsible  for  O&M  of  the  City  East  river \nimprovement  works  and  wastewater  treatment  plant.  The  Municipal  Facilities  Management \nDepartment (Municipal Public Utilities Bureau) will be responsible for O&M of all other facilities.  \n \n37. \nThe  financial,  technical,  and  institutional  capacity  of  the  three  IAs  was  assessed.  NCIC \nhas received capacity-building support from the ADB private sector TA. NDMD and NMECD will \nneed some training in relevant ADB procedures during project implementation. NCIC will directly \n\n\fmanage  construction,  NDMD  and  NMECD  will  outsource  this  activity  to  an  experienced  and \nqualified construction management company. Once the stormwater facilities are built, NDMD will \npass  them  on  to  the  district  water  bureau  for  O&M.  The  IAs  will  retain  the  services  of  design \ninstitutes  and  specialist  procurement  agencies  to  help  with  implementation.  With  the  help  of \ninternational  consultants,  the  Nanjing  PMO  and  the  IAs  will  develop  expertise  in  (i)  efficient \noperation  of  the  wastewater,  stormwater,  and  sludge  management  facilities;  and  (ii)  functional \nareas  of  administration,  finance,  accounting,  and  business  planning.  The  institutional  and \ncapacity-building  measures  are  detailed  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C. NCIC\u2019s  internal  controls \nand  accounting  and  auditing  procedures  were  reviewed  through  a  financial  management \nassessment  (Appendix  7).  This  assessment  confirms  the  adequacy  of  NCIC\u2019s  financial \nmanagement  practices  for  both  the  construction  and  operational  phase  of  the  Project.  But \ndiscussions  concerning  the  financial  management  of  stormwater  and  sludge  management \nservices indicate a need for improvement. On the basis of assessment of the IAs\u2019 financial and \nmanagerial capabilities, the Project is deemed sustainable as indicated in Appendix 8. The IAs\u2019 \ntechnical  and  institutional  capacities  were  assessed  and  found  to  be  adequate  for  project \nimplementation.  \n \n\nImplementation Period \n\n2. \n \n\n38. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years,  from  2007  to  2011  (Appendix  9).  This \nschedule is considered realistic  as  the  project  implementation  structure  is  already  in  place,  and \npreparatory works are under way. ADB\u2019s successful experience with similar projects in the PRC \nand  NMG,  and  the  IAs\u2019  in-depth  knowledge  and  experience  in  stormwater  and  wastewater \nindicate that this schedule is achievable. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n39. \nEquipment, materials and goods, civil works, and services financed under the loan will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended from time \nto time). Equipment, materials, goods, and services will follow ADB procedures for international \ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB)  for  packages  each  with  a  value  greater  than  $1  million.  Equipment, \nmaterials,  and  goods  with  estimated  contract  value  of  $100,000  or  less  will  be  procured  using \nshopping procedures. Civil works contracts costing more than $10 million will be procured using \nICB. Civil works contracts valued at the equivalent of $10 million or less can be procured using \nnational  competitive  bidding  procedures  in  accordance  with  the  PRC\u2019s  Tendering  and  Bidding \nLaw (1999), subject to clarifications to the law that have been agreed with ADB for the purposes \nof ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines.18 The selection and engagement of contractors will be subject \nto ADB approval.19 The procurement plan is in Appendix 10. Major equipment will be purchased \nthrough ICB procedures and financed by the ADB  loan. The internationally tendered equipment \npackages  will  include  the  necessary  technical  support  for  ensuring  proper  installation,  testing, \ncommissioning,  and  training  of  operations  staff  as  part  of  the  related  contracts.  In  accordance \nwith  ADB  requirements,  foreign  contractors  may  participate  in  bidding  for  national  competitive \nbidding contracts.  \n \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB.  1997.

Schedule  4  of  the  Loan \nAgreement. \n\n19  ADB  will  require  the  PMO  to  use  ADB-approved  standard  bidding  documents  (to  be  developed  as  necessary)  to \nensure high quality  and consistency of the documents; this  will facilitate  ADB review. A draft project administration \nmemorandum to this effect has been prepared and was discussed at loan appraisal. \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n4. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n40. \nADB  approved  the  Government\u2019s  request  for  advance  contracting,  which  includes \nrecruitment  of  consultants,  and  procurement  of  goods  and  civil  works;  and  the  request  for \nretroactive financing of eligible expenditures up to $20 million (equivalent to 20% of the ADB loan), \nincurred  prior  to  loan  effectiveness  but  not  earlier  than  a  maximum  of  12  months  before  the \nsigning  of  the  loan.20 Advance  contracting  will  include  (i)  tendering  and  bid  evaluation  for  civil \nworks contract packages; (ii) preparation of tender documents for the procurement of materials, \nplant,  equipment,  and  vehicles;  (iii)  award  of  contracts;  and  (iv)  recruitment  of  consultants.  The \nissuance of invitations to bid under advance procurement action will be subject to ADB approval. \nAll  advance  procurement  actions  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines or Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time).  \nNMG  has  requested  retroactive  financing  for  civil  works  and  equipment  for  part  of  the  Inner \nQinhuai  River  water  replenishment  component,  City  East  river  improvement  component,  and \nNorth He Xi water replenishment and river improvement component. The Government has been \nadvised that approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to \nfinance the Project. Contracts proposed for retroactive financing will be undertaken in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines.  \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n41. \nProvision has been made for 31 person-months of international and 100 person-months of \nnational consulting services to be funded under the Project to support the Nanjing PMO and IAs \nin project implementation and capacity building. A consulting firm will be recruited in accordance \nwith  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method \nand  requesting  full  technical  proposals.  The  scope  and  extent  of  consulting  services  takes \naccount  of the  consulting  support  incorporated  into  the  Nanjing  Water Utility  Long-Term  Capital \nFinance  in  Commercial  Markets  TA  for  strengthening  NCIC  and  the  United  Nations-Habitat \ncapacity-building  measures  under  the  Water  for  Asian  Cities  program.  Consulting  services  are \nrequired  for  (i)  developing  a  sludge  management  strategy  for  Nanjing;  (ii)  investigating  and \ncontrolling  inflow  and  infiltration  into  the  wastewater  collection  network;  (iii)  supervising \nconstruction,  quality  control,  and  related  monitoring  of  progress  during  project  implementation; \n(iv) monitoring resettlement; (v) improving stormwater and sewerage management; (vi) improving \nflood protection systems; (vii) helping with private sector participation initiatives; (viii) supporting \nfinancial  management;  and  (ix)  improving  O&M.  Capacity  building  for  the  IAs  will  be  achieved \nthrough  consultant  inputs,  hands-on  training,  and  domestic  and  international  training  financed \nfrom the loan. The outline terms of reference for the consulting services and indicative budget is \nin Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n42. \nTo facilitate funds flow and project implementation, Jiangsu Provincial Finance Bureau will \nestablish an imprest account once the loan becomes effective, in accordance with the provisions \nof ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook as amended from time to time. Disbursements from the \nimprest  account  must  be  supported  by  an  appropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related \ndocumentation. The documentation will demonstrate that the goods or services (i) were produced \nin  and  procured  from  ADB  member  countries,  and  (ii)  are  eligible  for  ADB  financing.  The  initial \namount  to  be  deposited  in  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  6  months  of  estimated \n\n                                                 \n20  The  advance  action  for  the  procurement  and  recruitment  of  consultants,  and  the  uploading  of  the  general \nprocurement  notice  on  the  ADB  website,  will  facilitate  the  start  of  the  advance  action  process.  ADB  Management \napproved advanced contracting and retroactive financing on 26 September 2006.  \n\n\fexpenditures  for  the  Project  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  The  statement  of \nexpenditure  procedure  may  be  used  for  reimbursement  or  liquidation  of  eligible  expenditures. \nIndividual payments under the statement of expenditure procedure should not exceed $200,000.21 \nDirect payment procedures will be used for large contracts. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n43. \nThe  PMO  will  prepare  semiannual  progress  reports  indicating  progress  made,  problems \nencountered  during  the  period  under  review,  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the  problems, \nproposed  program  of  activities,  and  progress  expected  in  the  next  half  year.  The  IAs  will  keep \nrecords  to  identify  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  and  follow  accounting \nprinciples and practices prescribed by the PRC\u2019s Accounting Law. The law requires enterprises to \nprepare financial statements and generally follow internationally accepted accounting standards. \nThe  IAs  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  records.  The  financial  statements  of  the \nproject  accounts  and  the  annual  corporate  financial  statements  for  the  IAs  will  be  subject  to \nexternal  audit  by  the  NMG  Audit  Bureau,  Jiangsu  Provincial  Audit  Bureau,  and  State  Audit \nAdministration. The audits will be carried out in accordance with regulations for auditing approved \nby the State Council and will meet ADB requirements. A separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of \nthe imprest account and statement of expenditure will be part of the audit reports. The IAs\u2019 annual \naudited financial statements and audited project accounts will be submitted to ADB no later than \n6  months  after  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year  for  the  entire  implementation  period. 22  The  PRC \nGovernment, JPG, and NMG were informed of ADB\u2019s policy requiring the submission of audited \nfinancial statements on time. JPG, NMG, and the IAs will submit reports and information to ADB \nconcerning  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds,  project  implementation,  and  IA  performance.  These \nreports will include (i) semiannual progress reports on project implementation; (ii) annual reports; \nand (iii) a project completion report, not later than 12 months after the completion of the project \nfacilities.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\n \n44. \nThe  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  indicators  include  (i)  service  levels, \n(ii) treated wastewater quality and other measures of operational performance, (iii) percentage of \nwastewater collected and treated, (iv) composite incidence of infectious waterborne diseases, (v) \nuser  satisfaction  with  the  urban  environment,  and  (vi)  relevant  economic  and  health  data  to \nmonitor project impact. The relevance and practicability of data collection for the indicators was \nconfirmed with the PMO.  \n \n45. \nAt  the  start  of  project  implementation,  the  PMO  and  IAs,  with  the  assistance  of \nconsultants,  will  develop  comprehensive  PPMS  procedures  to  systematically  generate  data  on \nthe  inputs  and  outputs  of  the  project  components;  and  the  socioeconomic,  health,  and \nenvironmental  indicators  to  be  used  to  measure  project  impact.  A  set  of  indicators  for  the \nmonitoring of the future performance of the WWTPs will be designed by the loan implementation \nconsultants  before  the  start  of  operations.  The  PMO  and  IAs  will  refine  the  PPMS,  confirm \nachievable  targets,  finalize  monitoring  and  recording  arrangements,  and  establish  systems  and \nprocedures  no  later  than  6  months  after  project  inception.  Under  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework,  baseline  and  progress data  will  be  reported  at  the  requisite  time  intervals,  including \nsemiannual  reporting  provided  for  in  the  environmental  management  plan.  The  PMO  will  be \nresponsible for analyzing and consolidating the data through its management information system. \n                                                 \n21 The  limits  for  the  imprest  account  and  the  statement  of  expenditure  are  in  accordance  with  the  recent  review  of \n\nADB\u2019s PRC portfolio and were set to improve efficiency in loan disbursement. \n\n22 The IAs now have three tiers of audit including (i) internal audit, (ii) municipal government audit, and (iii) provincial \n\nand state government audit. \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nThe  PPMS  will  be  designed  to  permit  adequate  flexibility  to  adopt  remedial  action  regarding \nproject design, schedules, activities, and development impact. The PMO, with the assistance of \nthe consultants, will monitor and assess activities, and provide semiannual reports to ADB on the \nphysical implementation and financial aspects of the Project to ensure that its impact is monitored \nand reported in line with ADB requirements. \n \n\n9. \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption Measures \n\n \n46. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998), as amended to date was explained to and discussed \nwith  NMG  and  the  IAs,  including  the  recent  harmonized  definitions  of  corrupt  and  fraudulent \npractices.23 ADB\u2019s approval of the Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan was also \nindicated  and  discussed.  The  Project  includes  anticorruption  and  governance  assurances  in \nsupport  of  the  principles  of  transparency,  participation,  accountability,  zero-tolerance  for \ncorruption  (para.  28  of  the  RRP),  and  requirement  for  performance  audit.  As  part  of  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to \ninvestigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations, the loan and project agreements, and \nthe bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection \nwith  the  Project  will  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the \nrecords  and  accounts  of  NMG  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service \nproviders  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  For  the  Project,  NMG  will  undertake  the  following \nanticorruption actions: (i) involve full-time officials from Nanjing Discipline Investigation Bureau in \nbidding  and  construction;  (ii)  introduce  a  dual-signing  system,  in  which  the  civil  works  contract \nwinner also signs an anticorruption contract with the employer; and (iii) periodically inspect fund \nwithdrawals and settlements by the contractor.   \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n47. \nIn  addition  to  joint  project  reviews  carried  out  at  least  once  a  year,  ADB,  the  JPG,  and \nNMG  will  undertake  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  one  to  2  years  after  the  start  of  project \nimplementation.  The  review  will  include  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope,  implementation \narrangements, resettlement, achievement of scheduled targets, and progress on the agenda for \npolicy  reform  and  capacity  building  measures.  Feedback  from  the  PPMS  activities  will  be \nanalyzed.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \nBy 2010, the Project will benefit about 2.7 million urban residents in Nanjing whose living \n48. \nconditions and public health standards will improve as a result of (i) reduced pollution in Nanjing\u2019s \nsurface water following the improvement of wastewater collection and the wastewater treatment \nrate,  better  sludge  management,  and  renewal  of  degraded  urban  wetland;  (ii)  protection  from \nflooding  and  elimination  of  hazards  associated  with  inadequate  stormwater  drainage;  and  (iii) \nreduction of the incidence of waterborne infectious diseases below the 2005/06 level of 43 cases \nper 1,000 people. By 2010, the Project will improve the management of surface water resources \nin Nanjing by (i) achieving the goal of 85% wastewater treatment rate in Nanjing; (ii) reducing the \nannual pollution load in the Qinhuai River by 5,000 tons biochemical oxygen demand, 9,000 tons \nchemical  oxygen  demand,  6,800  tons  suspended  solids,  950  tons  ammonia  nitrogen,  and  110 \n\n                                                 \n23 ADB. 2006. Anticorruption Policy: Harmonized Definitions of Corrupt and Fraudulent Practices. Manila. \n\n\ftons  total  phosphorus;  (iii)  significantly  reducing  flooding  in  urban  areas;  (iv)  increasing  the \nefficiency and management capacity of the IAs; and (v) improving cost recovery through a better \ntariff structure, with gradual increases to achieve cost recovery.  \n \n49. \nTo  achieve  national  wastewater  treatment  targets,  NMG  will  build  a  new  WWTP.  Upon \nproject  completion,  100,000  m3/day  treatment  capacity  will  be  added,  and  the  four  WWTPs  will \nprovide  a  total  of  1,145,000  m3/day  secondary  treatment  to  the  received  wastewater  to  reach \nlocal standards of an 85% wastewater treatment rate by 2010. The Project will help increase the \nwastewater  treatment  rate  in  the  main  city  of  Nanjing  from  75%  to  85%  by  2010.  Associated \nsewer  networks  and  pumping  stations  will  be  built  to  accommodate  the  growth  in  wastewater \nflows to year 2015 in the project areas. The significant water quality improvements in the Qinhuai \nRiver  and  in  turn  in  the  Nanjing  section  of  the  YRB  will  contribute  to  integrated  water  resource \nmanagement  and  pollution  control,  basin  management,  and  transboundary  pollution  prevention \nand control.  \n \n50. \nThe  stormwater  management  component  will  add  27  km  to  the  1,153  km  of  storm  drain \nand  combined  system.  To  enhance  flood  control  in  the  urban  areas  of  Nanjing,  this  component \nwill improve the drainage-sewerage network by separating stormwater and wastewater flows into \ndifferent systems and rehabilitating defective pipes. Waterborne diseases; accidents; injuries and \nloss of life; and damage to property, agriculture, and infrastructure will be minimized. \n \nB. \n \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement  \n\n \n51. \nLand acquisition and resettlement will involve people affected by (i) permanent acquisition \nof land for the wetland park, sludge disposal facility, and pumping stations; (ii) temporary use of \nland  for  rehabilitating  river  banks  and  installing  trunk  sewer  pipelines;  and  (iii)  demolition  of \nhouses  or  buildings.  The  resettlement  requirements  have  been  carefully  considered  and \nincorporated  into  the  project  design.  Through  the  optimum  engineering  project  design,  the \nresettlement  impacts  were  minimized.  As  a  result,  only  one  of  the  components  will  have \nsignificant land acquisition and resettlement impacts.  \n \n52. \nIn  total,  the  Project  will  require  (i)  the  permanent  acquisition  of  63.5  hectares  (ha),  of \nwhich 33.5 ha is rural collective land; (ii) the temporary acquisition of 97.6 ha, of which 12 ha is \nclassified  as  rural  collective  land;  and  (iii)  the  demolition  of  50,899  square  meters  (m2)  of \nresidential  housing  and  48,895  m2  of  enterprises  and  shops.  Accordingly,  803  people  will  be \naffected, of which 339 will be affected by permanent land acquisition, and 455 residents and 272 \nstaff of enterprises and shops will be affected by house/building demolition. No indigenous people \nor  ethnic  minorities  will  be  adversely  affected  by  any  of  the  project  components.  The  cost \nestimate for land acquisition and resettlement is $50.45 million, equivalent to CNY409.09 million, \nincluding  contingencies,  taxes,  and  fees  for  resettlement  administration.  All  the  land  acquisition \nand resettlement costs will be included in the project cost. \n \nIndividual  resettlement  plans  were  prepared  for  the  five  components  in  accordance  with \n53. \nPRC  Land  Administration  Law  (1998),  State  Council  Decision  to  Deepen  Reform  and  Strictly \nEnforce  Land  Administration  (2004),  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and \nassociated operational procedures. The resettlement plans provide a socioeconomic profile of the \npeople  affected  and  scope  of  impacts;  and  address  issues  related  to  their  entitlements  for \ncompensation,  legal  framework,  public  consultations,  grievance  procedures,  rehabilitation \nmeasures,  budget,  and  implementation  milestones.  The  summary  resettlement  plan  is  in \nAppendix 11. NMG and the IAs have implemented ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2005), \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nwhich  requires  full  disclosure  for  the  resettlement  activities  by  (i)  distributing  copies  of  the \nresettlement information booklet to affected households and village offices on 1 September 2006, \n(ii) posting the draft resettlement plans in village offices or resident committees on 1 September \n2006,  and  (iii)  posting  English  versions  of  the  draft  resettlement  plans  on  the  ADB  website \nfollowing their endorsement by NMG and Environment and Social Safeguard Division (RSES) on \n26 September 2006.24 The final RPs were uploaded onto the ADB website on 13 November 2006. \n \n\n54. \nAll those affected will be compensated and resettled in a timely and adequate manner in \naccordance with the resettlement plans so that they will be at least as well off as they would have \nbeen  without  the  Project.  To  ensure  that  they  have  been  adequately  compensated  and \nrehabilitated,  the  PMO  and  IAs  will  (i)  keep  ADB  informed  of  resettlement  plan  implementation \nthrough semiannual progress reports until resettlement is complete, and (ii) prepare resettlement \ncompletion reports and submit them to ADB.  \n \n\n2. \n\nResettlement Monitoring \n\n \nADB  requires  internal  and  external  monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  land  acquisition \n55. \nand  resettlement  for  the  Project.  The  PMO  and  IAs  will  recruit  an  independent  agency  for \nsemiannual  monitoring  and  annual  evaluation  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  until  2  years \nafter the completion of land acquisition and resettlement. An international social specialist under \nconsulting  services  will  help  the  PMO  and  IAs  to  facilitate  internal  monitoring  and  evaluation  of \nresettlement,  and  prepare  the  progress  reports.  The  monitors  will  conduct  site  visits,  review \nresettlement  progress,  implement  policy  and  income  restoration  for  those  affected,  support  the \ntraining programs, and make recommendations to resolve any issues. Monitoring and evaluation \nreports will be prepared and simultaneously submitted to ADB, PMO, and IAs. These reports will \nbe uploaded onto the ADB website. In addition to the electronic copies, the monitors will provide \nhard copies of the report (both in English and Chinese). ADB requires three English copies and \ntwo Chinese copies.  \n \n\n3. \n\nPoverty Reduction \n\n \n56. \nA  poverty  and  social  analysis  was  undertaken  in  line  with  ADB  guidelines  to  collect \ndetailed  social  information  to  inform  project  design;  and  identify  poverty  reduction  and  social \ndevelopment  objectives,  outcomes,  and  indicators.  In  addition  to  the  socioeconomic  survey, \npublic  consultations  were  conducted  with  different  groups  of  stakeholders  including  consumer \ngroups,  business  communities,  government  agencies,  people  affected  by  the  Project,  and  civil \nsociety organizations. A participatory approach was adopted for project design and will continue \nduring  project  implementation.  The poverty  and  social  analysis  identified  vulnerable  groups  and \nopportunities  for  pro-poor  interventions;  and  recommended  social  action  measures,  and \nparticipation  and  mitigation  plans  to  achieve  positive  social  benefits.  The  summary  poverty \nreduction and social development strategy is in Appendix 12.  \n \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  achieving  Millennium  Development  Goal  7  and  target  1025 \n57. \nthrough improved quality of life for approximately 2.7 million people by reducing the incidence of \nwaterborne  diseases  and  flood  risk  in  urban  Nanjing,  and  providing  employment  opportunities \n\n                                                 \n24  RPs were prepared for all five components. Based on subsequent review by RSES, it was decided that only three \ncomponents  required  RPs,  since  two  components  had  no  impacts  on  people.  The  three  components  with \nresettlement  impacts  included  the  (i)  Inner  Qinhuai  River  Sewerage  and  Water  Replenishment,  (ii)  City  East \nWastewater  Treatment  Plant,  and  (iii)  Sludge  Treatment.  These  will  be  monitored  for  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \n\n25  This  calls  for  halving,  by  2015,  the  proportion  of  people  without  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and  improved \n\nsanitation.  \n\n\fFinancial Aspects \n\nduring construction and operation of project facilities, with anticipated flow on effects to economic \ndevelopment.  The  poor,26 who  comprise  5%  of  total  population,  will  disproportionately  benefit \nfrom  the  Project  through  reductions  in  medical  costs  incurred  as  a  result  of  contracting \nwaterborne  diseases  valued  at  approximately  CNY142  per  person  per  year.  Health  benefits  are \nexpected  to  be  felt  disproportionately  by  women,  who  are  more  vulnerable  to  waterborne \ndiseases  due  to  higher  contact  with  water  from  household  responsibilities  (especially  cooking \nand washing), and are mainly responsible for care of the young and old when they are sick. A \nhealth impact analysis is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nThe  Project  will  create  a  minimum  of  6,000  full-time  jobs  during  the  5  years  of \n58. \nconstruction. The poor and women will fill about 50% of these jobs. Those temporarily employed \nin  construction  will  benefit  from  additional  training  and  experience  that  will  provide  them  with \nopportunities in future planned infrastructure projects. The associated wages for workers translate \nto  CNY543  million  of  project  costs  that  will  return  to  the  local  economy.  Project  operations  will \ncreate  450  full-time  permanent  jobs  directly  and  another  710  jobs  through  multiplier  effects, \ncorresponding  to  approximately  CNY42  million  in  wages  per  year.  The  Project  will  provide \nemployment opportunities to the floating population of migrant workers by assisting them to apply \nfor temporary residence registration. In addition, the Project will require that all IAs comply  with \nnational and local labor laws and regulations for wages, and occupational and health safety. \n \nC. \n \n59. \nThe financial evaluation of the Project was undertaken in real terms using constant 2006 \nprices.  The  project  cost  estimates  and  financial  projections  in  nominal  terms  were  converted  to \nreal  terms  by  adjusting  for  the  projected  effects  of  foreign  and  domestic  inflation  and  currency \nfluctuation. Incremental benefits and costs were derived by evaluating the financial position of the \nIAs  under  the  with-  and  without-  project  scenarios.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the \nProject  was  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis  of  6.20%,  which  compares  favorably  with  the \nweighted average cost of capital in real terms of 2.79%. The financial analysis and projections are \nin Appendix 13.  \n \n60. \nThe sensitivity analysis includes an examination of the risk that project costs will increase \nby 10%, or that revenues are delayed by 1 year; the resulting financial internal rates of return are \n4.60%  and  5.95%,  respectively.  A  verification  of  the  local  financing  plan  reveals  that  the  equity \ncontributions from NMG are less than 1.5% of its annual revenue, indicating minimal risk. NMG \nhas the financial resources to guarantee the loan repayments, and has provided assurances that \nit  accepts  this  risk.  An  affordability  analysis,  based  on  proposed  tariffs  and  household  income \ndata  from  the  social  survey,  has  been  undertaken.  Tariffs  under  the  Project  are  considered \naffordable if the combined average water and wastewater charges are less than 5% of household \nincome.  The  estimated  tariffs  on  this  basis  are  affordable  to  the  average  household  (2.5%  of \nincome),  and  also  affordable  to  the  poorest  10%  of  households  (less  than  3.5%).  NMG  has  a \npolicy measure to decrease the impact of tariff increases on poor families through the Minimum \nLiving Standard Scheme.27 In addition, the Project includes pro-poor assurances that will protect \nthe  poor  from  wastewater  tariff  increases.  The  revenue-generating  IA,  NCIC,  has  agreed  to \nminimum levels of financial performance, and these will be included as loan covenants covering \ncapital  structure  (debt  to  equity  ratio),  debt  service  coverage  ratio,  and  liquidity  ratio.  Financial \nprojections estimate the tariffs required for an appropriate level of financial performance. Periodic \ntariff reviews will be required to overcome the risk of poor financial performance or of unexpected \nchanges in tariff income. The Project is considered both financially viable and sustainable.  \n \n                                                 \n26  The poverty line in Nanjing (urban) is CNY260 per capita per month. \n27  The households eligible for the Minimum Living Standard Scheme  are cushioned from the increases  in  the cost of \nessential  public  services  via  a  subsidy.  In  2004,  eligible  families  received  CNY5  per  month  for  1  year  to  reflect \nincreased water tariffs, and in 2005 received CNY70 as cushion for another increase in water tariffs.  \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nEconomic Aspects \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\ntwice  during  preparation  of \n\nD. \n \n61. \nThe  Project  is  an  integral  part  of  the  ongoing  provincial,  municipal,  and  river  basin \nenvironmental programs, contributing significantly to pollution control in the Qinhuai River and in \nturn  to  the  environmental  protection  of  the  YRB.  Public  perceptions  and  preferences  were  also \nevaluated  using  household  and  business  surveys.  The  analysis  demonstrate  that,  when \ncompared  with  a  range  of  other  public  services,  wastewater  management,  waterborne  disease \nprevention,  river  cleaning,  and  flood  damage  control  improvements  rank  highest  in  priority.  A \nquantitative  economic  analysis  also  demonstrates  the  value  of  the  Project.  The  economic \nanalysis  was  conducted  for  25  years  including  project  construction,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Project benefits and costs were estimated on a \nwith-  and  without-  project  basis.  Costs  were  divided  into  tradable  and  nontradable  costs,  and \nbenefits  were  adjusted  to  account  for  nonincremental  and  incremental  benefits.  Incremental \neconomic  benefits  were  valued  on  the  basis  of  willingness  to  pay;  and  in  the  case  of  flood \nprevention,  the  damages  avoided.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  components \nranges  from  15.1%  to  28.2%,  and  for  the  whole  Project  21.6%,  which  exceeds  the  economic \nopportunity cost of capital, assumed at 12%. The economic analysis is in Appendix 14.  \n \nE. \n \nExtensive  public  consultations  involving  meetings  with  stakeholders,  focus  group \n62. \ndiscussions,  and  surveys  were  undertaken \nthe  domestic \nenvironmental  impact  assessments  (EIAs).  The  EIA  summarizes  the  environmental  impacts, \nmitigation  measures,  and  monitoring  plans.  The  environmental  management  plan  (EMP), \nprepared as part of the EIA, will guide environmental mitigation and monitoring under the Project. \nThe summary EIA was circulated to the ADB Board and posted on the ADB website on 3 August \n2006. The Project will improve the urban environment and surface water quality in Nanjing and in \nthe YRB. A major positive impact and environmental benefit is pollutant reduction (para. 48 of the \nRRP).  The  project  preparatory  TA  consultants,  based  on  detailed  assessment,  proposed \ninnovative  value-added  engineering  solutions  (Supplementary  Appendix  F),  which  have  been \ndiscussed  with  the  design  institutes  for  consideration  and  incorporation  into  the  feasibility  study \nreports. \n \n63. \nThe  stormwater  component  will  bring  the  stormwater  network  up-to-date  to  provide \nadequate  capacity  for  flood  control.  The  river  improvement  and  replenishment  component,  by \nimproving  the  flushing  capacity  of  the  watercourses,  will  improve  the  water  quality  and  flood \nstorage  capacity  in  these  rivers.  The  sludge  management  component  will  provide  proper \ntreatment and disposal for sewage sludge from five WWTPs, dredged materials from the rivers, \nand sludge from maintenance of the pipeline network. This will prevent secondary pollution of the \nNanjing  environment.  The  wetland  park  subcomponent  will  remove  a  degraded  urban  site  from \nthe  city,  and  restore  it  into  a  wetland  park  with  functions  for  outdoor  recreation,  water  quality \npolishing,  flood  storage,  wildlife  habitats,  and  conservation  education.  All  these  will  bring \nsecondary public health and socioeconomic benefits to Nanjing and its citizens. Improvements of \nthe water quality and the riverbanks will improve the living conditions of people along these rivers, \nbeautify  the  culturally  important  Qinhuai  River,  and  promote  tourism  and  property  development \nthat  will  bring  employment  and  other  socioeconomic  benefits.  The  Project  will  have  an \noverwhelming  positive  environmental  impact,  and  any  environmental  risks  during  construction \nand  the  life  of  the  Project  will  be  mitigated  by  implementing  the  measures  identified  by  the  EIA \nand the environmental management plan.  \n \nF. \n \n64. \nPotential  institutional,  financial,  and  policy  risks  related  to  the  Project  include  failure  of \nNMG  to  (i)  implement  institutional  strengthening  for  effective  project  management,  (ii)  increase \nwater and wastewater tariffs to meet cost-recovery targets, and (iii) meet the equity requirements \n\nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\n\fto implement the Project. These risks have been mitigated by (i) obtaining assurances from JPG \nand NMG on the financial and managerial autonomy of the IAs, and institutional strengthening of \nthe IAs; (ii) periodic water tariff reviews and adjustments following the national guidelines; and (iii) \nassurances from JPG and NMG that guarantee provision of counterpart funding for construction \nand O&M of the non-revenue generating project components. ADB review missions will monitor \ncompliance  with  the  financial  and  operational  covenants  to  ensure  the  IAs  are  financially \nsustainable. The Project does not have any unusual technical risks. The stormwater, wastewater, \nand sludge management subcomponents under the Project use conventional engineering design \nand  treatment  processes  that  are  robust  and  have  proven  records  of  reliable  performance.  The \nequipment  packages  to  be  procured  through  ICB  will  include  technical  support  for  installing, \ntesting,  and  commissioning  mechanical  and  electrical  plant  as  recommended  by \nthe \nmanufacturer.  Given  the  performance  of  ADB\u2019s  PRC  portfolio,  cost  overruns  and  major \nimplementation delays are not expected. Further, other risks including corruption and impact on \nthe  affordability  of  the  very  poor  from  rapid  wastewater  tariff  increases  are  mitigated  through \nappropriate assurances. Regarding affordability, subsidies provided by NMG under its Minimum \nLiving Standard Scheme for the poor will also be a significant mitigating factor.   \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances, 28  the  Government  and  NMG  have  given  the \n\n65. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nNMG will ensure that the wastewater fees charged are set at a level that ensures \nfull cost recovery of  O&M, depreciation and financial costs including debt service \nobligations, and a reasonable profit margin for wastewater treatment.  \n \nNMG  will  ensure  that  prior  to  the  implementation  of  any  tariff  increases,  Nanjing \nMunicipal  Price  Bureau  will  (a)  review  and  conduct  research  to  determine  the \nnumber  of  poor  people,  including  those  living  at  or  below  the  poverty  line,  who \nwould  be  affected  by  such  tariff  increase,  and  the  impact  of  such  wastewater \nadjustments on the poor; (b) prepare a plan or scheme to be provided to ADB for \nreview,  which  may  include  price  subsidies  or  other  measures  such  as  lifeline \ntariffs,  to  ensure  that  the  livelihood  or  standard  of  living  of  the  people  affected \nallows  them  to  be  at  least  as  well-off  as  before  the  tariff  increase;  (c)  issue  a \ndecree before such tariff increase takes effect to ensure that all those affected are \nprovided  such  subsidy  or  measures;  and  (d)  monitor  the  effectiveness  of  the \nsubsidy or other measures.  \n\nIn  furtherance  of  the  principles  of  transparency,  participation,  accountability,  and \nzero-tolerance  for  corruption,  NMG  will  establish  a  project  website  to  provide  the \npublic  with  information  on  the  Project    including  (a)  a  summary  of  the  audited \nfinancial statements of the Project, (b) tracking of procurement contract awards, (c) \nany  proposed  tariff  increases  and  associated  scheduled  public  hearings,  (d) \nrelevant  laws  and  regulations,  and  (e)  any  information  relating  to  pro-poor \nsubsidies  or  lifeline  tariffs.  NMG  will  periodically  make  such  information  available \non radio and in newspapers.  \n\nthat  qualified  and \n\nNMG  shall  ensure \nindependent  auditors  shall  conduct \nperformance/\u2018\u2019value for money\u2019\u2019 audits during project implementation to determine \nthe  degree  to  which  Project  funds  have  been  effectively  and  efficiently  utilized  to \nimplement  the  Project, and  achieve  its  objectives,  outcomes  and  its  performance \nindicators. Such performance audits may be conducted together with the financial \n\n                                                 \n28  The full list of assurances is included in the Loan Agreement and

Surface and groundwater sources \nfor urban water supply are frequently polluted to unacceptable levels. An important strategy in \nthe  Government\u2019s  plan  to  control  and  reduce  pollution  is  to  focus  on  river  basin  activities, \nespecially  in  the  management  of  surface  water  quality.  Currently  Nanjing  City  has  treatment \nworks  capacity  in  excess  of  60%  of  the  municipal  wastewater  (domestic  and  industrial) \ngenerated.  The  proportion  of  domestic  wastewater  is  set  to  increase  marginally  as  a  result  of \nincreasing urbanization, reduced urban density, and improved efficiency in water use on the part \nof PRC industries. Government policy now requires that cost-recovery tariffs be adopted for the \nprovision  of  wastewater  treatment.  In  contrast,  flood  control  and  stormwater  drainage  is \nconsidered a non-revenue-generating activity, to be financed from local government revenues.  \n \nA. \n \nThis sector analysis is conducted in a river basin context. The water policy1 of the Asian \n2. \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  calls  for  ADB  to  support  integrated  water  resource  management;  in \nthis  context,  coordinated  river  basin  activities  to  manage  surface  water  quality.  A  sector \nperspective for the Project must relate to basin plans to manage surface water quality, evaluate \nplan implementation, and assess progress in managing water quality. Nanjing is located in the \nlower reaches of the Yangtze River basin (YRB), the largest river basin in the PRC covering a \nlarge part of the country. The Yangtze River is about 6,380 kilometers (km) long with a drainage \nbasin of 1.2 million square kilometers (km2). The main trunk of the Yangtze flows in an easterly \ndirection and eventually enters the East China Sea at Shanghai.  \n \n3. \nThe YRB Commission, which the central Government established to manage YRB water \nresources,  prepared  the  Yangtze  River  Water  Resources  Protection  Plan  (2002),  which \nprovides  a  broad  framework  for  managing  YRB  water  resources.  In  April  2005,  the  YRB \nCommission sponsored the First Yangtze Forum in Wuhan. The forum issued a formal Yangtze \nDeclaration  on  Protection  and  Development,  which  calls  \u201c\u2026for  active  participation  of  all \nstakeholders in collaborative efforts to concurrently protect and develop the Yangtze River and \nensure a healthy Yangtze for our future generations.\u201d The declaration highlights the importance \nof integrated river basin management.  \n \nB. \n \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  update  (CSPU) 2 for  the  PRC  aims  to  promote \n4. \ncontinued  economic  growth  in  the  country  as  a  primary  means  of  reducing  poverty.  It \nrecognizes,  however,  that  the  PRC\u2019s  economic  growth  has  come  at  the  cost  of  serious \nenvironmental  degradation,  particularly  increased  water  and  air  pollution.  Environmental \ndegradation threatens the prospect of sustaining the economic growth. Improving environmental \nprotection  is  therefore  a  main  strategic  issue  and  one  of  the  main  thematic  priorities  of  the \nCSPU. A complementary objective and a main focus of the CSPU is promoting the provision of \nadequate  urban  infrastructure  to  improve  the  livelihood  of  the  rapidly  increasing  urban \npopulation.  The  Project  is  fully  consistent  with  the  CSPU,  which  calls  for  market-oriented \nreforms  and  attention  to  urban  environmental  problems.  The  market-oriented  reforms  include \nthe principle of cost recovery through user charges, which is an important feature of the Project.  \n\nCountry Strategy and Program \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2001.

This  planning \ndocument  contains  medium-term  targets  to  improve  the  quality  of  water  bodies  in  and  around \nNanjing  City  given  national  legislation,  guidelines  on  water  quality,  and  the  situation  within \nNanjing.  After  extensive  consultations  with  all  key  stakeholders,  the  Nanjing  municipal \ngovernment  (NMG)  approved  the  planning  document  in  early  2005;  it  has  become  the  official \nguide for the planning and design of environmental improvement projects in Nanjing. In addition, \ntwo other documents provide supplementary targets: Flood Control Planning for Qinhuai River \nBasin, and Jiangsu Province Surface Water (Environment) Beneficial Use Classification. \n \n6. \nsummarized as follows: \n \n\nThe planning targets for major water bodies, flood control, and wastewater treatment are \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nwater quality of major rivers and lakes in Jiangsu: from worse than class V to class \nV in 2007, and improved to class IV in 2010; \nflood frequency of major tributaries of the Qinhuai River reduced to 1 in 100 years; \nlocal flooding frequency: from less than 1 in 1 year to 1 in 2 years; and    \nwastewater treatment rate increased to 85% for major cities like Nanjing. \n\nNanjing Municipality and Qinhuai River Basin Flood Control Planning \n\n \nD. \n \n7. \nIn  terms  of  river  drainage,  the  Outer  Qinhuai  River  is  a  right-bank  tributary  of  the \nYangtze River, originating at Lishui and Jurong conurbations. It is known as the Outer Qinhuai \nRiver because it lies outside the ancient city wall surrounding Nanjing City. The Outer Qinhuai \nRiver  flows  toward  the  Nanjing  urban  area  via  Dongshan  town  of  Jiangning  District.  Its  total \nlength is 110 km and the catchment area is 2,631 km2. Niushoushan, South, Xiangshui, Youyi, \nYunliang, and Yuntaishan rivers join it on its path to the confluence of the Yangtze River at San \nCha gate. Much of the city sits below the 100-year flood level of the Yangtze River predicted as \n10.63 meters above datum and is therefore subject to flooding during the rainy season (April to \nSeptember).   \n \n8. \nThe lower 34 km of the river lies within Nanjing\u2019s main urban districts. Water quality in \nthe  lower  Qinhuai  River  has  deteriorated  significantly  in  the  past  15  years  mainly  due  to \nwastewater  discharge  from  the  city,  and  currently  fails  to  achieve  class  V  of  the  PRC  water \nquality standards. All seven rivers and three lakes in the Nanjing built-up area are polluted. The \nmunicipality is served by a mixture of wastewater, stormwater, and combined sewer networks. \nDue  to  lack  of  sufficient  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  facilities,  increasingly  severe \nproblems  related  to  water  pollution  and  urban  drainage  have  resulted  in  serious  water  quality \nproblems  in  the  Qinhuai  River  within  Nanjing.  When  the  wastewater  interception  and \nwastewater  treatment  facilities  under  this  Project  are  complete,  Qinhuai  River  water  quality  is \nexpected to be improved from below class V to class IV in line with the planning targets. \n \nThe  main  problems  with  Nanjing\u2019s  stormwater  drainage  system  are  (i)  continuing \n9. \nurbanization  and  new  developments  in  the  limited  open  space  remaining  within  already \ncongested  areas,  (ii)  inadequate  network  coverage,  (iii)  old  infrastructure  with  inadequate \ndesign  standards,  (iv)  limitations  of  the  combined  drainage  systems  leading  to  wastewater \noverflows  during  storm  and  flood  events,  and  (v)  inadequate  maintenance  of  the  drainage \nnetwork.  The  Project  addresses  these  issues  by  providing  storm-drain  network  extensions \ndesigned to new standards, and achieving better separation of the storm and sewage networks.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\nNanjing Municipality: Wastewater \n\nE. \n \n10. \nThe key references for the master planning of wastewater infrastructure in Nanjing are (i) \nNanjing  City  Water  Environment  Improvement  Works  Construction  Planning  (para.  5)  (2004) \nand Nanjing City Trunk Sewers Planning (2005). These two wastewater master plans define the \nwastewater  catchment  boundaries,  the  strategic  locations  of  wastewater  treatment  works, \ndesign assumptions, layout, and sizes of major sewers for Nanjing City. \n \nIn 2004, industrial sources were responsible for 52% of the 2.46 million cubic meters per \n11. \nday  (m3/day)  of  wastewater  produced  by  greater  Nanjing.  Nanjing  Main  City  generated  about \n1.34 million m3/day of wastewater, including 0.17 million m3/day of industrial wastewater. Within \nNanjing  Main  City,  the  four  existing  wastewater  treatment  plants  (WWTPs)  have  capacity  to \ntreat  about  70%  of  the  domestic  wastewater.  NMG  is  currently  implementing  its  wastewater \nmaster  plan  and  will  install  additional  WWTPs  to  raise  the  wastewater  treatment  rate  to  the \nrequired 85% target by 2010 as required by the state guidelines. The wastewater master plan \nincludes phased and well-coordinated construction of WWTPs and sewer networks using local \nfunds  and  assistance  from  ADB  and  other  sources.  To  ensure  that  the  WWTPs\u2019  expanded \ncapacity  is  fully  utilized,  sewers  leading  to  the  WWTPs  must  be  constructed  and  in  service \nbefore 2010.  \n \nThe  wastewater  interception  works,  additional  sewerage  network,  and  additional \n12. \ntreatment  capacity  to  be  provided  under  the  Project  will  reduce  the  pollution  load  discharged \ninto the Qinhuai tributaries, and this in turn reduces pollution in the Qinhuai River itself as well \nas the Yangtze River, thus contributing to achievement of river quality targets. \n \nF. \n \n13. \nNanjing  municipality  has  a  well-constructed  set  of  policies,  targets,  and  plans  for  the \nwastewater  and  drainage  sector.  These  instruments  are  themselves  compatible  with  national \npolicies  and  regulations.  The  relevant  Nanjing  sector  plans  are  compatible  with  the  overall \ndevelopment plan for the city and with the YRB water resources protection plan. The Project is \npart of the ongoing implementation of existing sector plans. \n\nConclusions  \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nPOLICY DIALOGUE \n\nOverall Policy Framework  \n\nCost Recovery and Tariff Reform \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nDiscussions  with  the  Nanjing  project  management  office  (PMO)  and  relevant  municipal \nagencies, and reference to specific national policy documents of the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC), reveal government policies in support of the Project and the establishment of institutional \narrangements for project sustainability. These policies include (i) corporatization, instead of direct \ngovernment  provision,  of  public  services;  (ii)  Government\u2019s  role  as  enabler  and  regulator  of \nservices; (iii) separation between government and enterprise management; (iv) financing of utility \nservices  from  user  charges,  with  tariffs  set  in  accordance  with  full  cost-recovery  principles;  (v) \njoint  billing  of  water  and  wastewater  charges  under  the  \u201cone  bill,  two  items\u201d  system; \n(vi) encouragement  of  appropriate  competition  and  private  sector  participation  for  investment  in \ninfrastructure  construction  and  operation  and  maintenance;  (vii)  adoption  of  the  polluter  pays \nprinciple; and (viii) promotion of social stability through poverty reduction and equal opportunities. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  economic  and  enterprise  reform \nprograms  that  require  all  wastewater  management  projects  to  be  financially  sustainable  and \ncapable  of  cost  recovery.  Drainage  companies  are  required  to  improve  their  cost-recovery \ncapability.  Appropriate  mechanisms  for  tariff  setting  are  a  critical  factor  in  attracting  the  needed \ninvestment  in  the  sector,  ending  drainage  companies\u2019  reliance  on  government  subsidies,  and \nproviding incentives to users to conserve water resources. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is \nactively encouraging this transition in its policy dialogue and lending operations. \n \n3. \nADB has funded two water tariff studies and one wastewater tariff study in support of the \nGovernment\u2019s initiatives. The National Guidelines on Water Tariffs, prepared during the first water \ntariff  study,1 were  promulgated  by  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  and  the \nMinistry of Construction in September 1998. Major features in the guidelines that reflect specific \ntechnical assistance (TA) recommendations include (i) selecting a tariff structure based on local \nconditions  and  priorities;  (ii)  adopting  full  cost  recovery  as  the  main  objective  in  setting  and \napproving tariffs; (iii) using public hearings to disseminate tariff increase plans to the public and \nobtain  their feedback;  (iv)  adopting a  simplified process for tariff  regulation,  requiring  evaluation \nand approval by the municipal government, and supported by provincial and national review and \nmonitoring; and (v) introducing lifeline tariffs for the poor. The guidelines improved the long-term \nfinancial  viability  of  water  supply  companies  and  provided  for  operation  and  maintenance  and \nservice expansion to help increase private sector participation in the water and wastewater sector. \nNMG confirmed implementation of the guidelines. ADB\u2019s wastewater tariff study TA,2 carried out \nbetween  2002  and  2003,  contributed  to  wastewater  tariff  reform.  Circular  1,192  of  September \n1999, amending the policy guidance on wastewater tariff setting, requires wastewater tariffs to be \nbased on the principle of cost recovery but allows local governments flexibility in deciding when to \nimplement the circular. NMG has been increasing water and wastewater tariffs in keeping with the \nstate  policy.  Stormwater  and  sludge  management,  and  river  improvement  are,  however,  viewed \nas a non-revenue-generating activity in the PRC.  \n \n4.  \nThe  project  financial  analysis  assumes  that  the  wastewater  tariffs  are  based  on  the \nprinciple  of  full  cost  recovery.  Wastewater  tariffs  levied  in  the  main  urban  area  of  Nanjing \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1997.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n31 \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\n(currently CNY1.05 per cubic meter [m3]) are already higher than those in other cities in the PRC. \nAfter conducting a cost audit of the current and projected water, wastewater, and water resource \nexpenses,  Nanjing  Price  Bureau  proposes  to  increase  the  average  wastewater  tariff  in  Nanjing \nfrom the current CNY1.05/m3, to CNY1.40/m3 by 2006, and CNY1.60/m3 by 2010, exceeding the \nestimated full cost-recovery requirements of CNY1.57/m3 in 2010. These water and wastewater \ntariff  increases,  initiated  through  extensive  consultation  by  the  Nanjing  Price  Bureau,  are  highly \nencouraging and will contribute significantly to financial sustainability of the water and wastewater \ncompanies.  In  Nanjing,  the  local  water  supply  company  collects  water  and  wastewater  tariffs \nthrough  the  \u201cone  bill,  two  items\u201d  approach,  which  has  been  shown  in  other  countries  to  be  the \nmost effective way of collecting wastewater charges. Improved public awareness of the benefits \nof  effective  wastewater  drainage  and  treatment  can  make  them  much  more  willing  to  pay \nwastewater  charges.  Socioeconomic  surveys  done  during  the  project  preparatory  TA  indicate  a \nsignificantly high public willingness to pay, which is a very positive indicator of public support for \nthe proposed project investments.  \n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe  Project  will  demonstrate  ADB\u2019s  comprehensive  approach  to  addressing  wastewater \ninfrastructure  needs,  through  its  public  and  private  sector  operations.  Implementation  of  the \nPrivate Sector Operations Department advisory TA3 in Nanjing, and the subsequent processing of \nthe Nanjing Water Utility Development Project (NWUDP) is proceeding in parallel with the Nanjing \nQinhuai River Environmental Improvement Project. The proposed assistance for the NWUDP is a \npartial credit guarantee for up to 50% of a CNY2 billion bond issue (with a duration of up to 15 \nyears)  by  Nanjing  Public  Utilities  Company,  a  subsidiary  of  Nanjing  Construction  Investment \nCompany, which is the implementing agency for the wastewater treatment component under the \nproposed  Project.  While  the  NWUDP  and  the  proposed  Project  are  autonomous  and  not \ndependent  on  each  other,  significant  synergies  have  been  derived  from  the  public-private \napproach  to  addressing  water  pollution  and  improving  the  urban  environment  in  Nanjing.  The \nsuccessful policy dialogue on wastewater tariff reforms and the rigorous safeguards assessment \nfor  compliance  undertaken  through  the  proposed  Project  will  support  the  NWUDP.  Further,  the \nprocessing and approval of the proposed Project will act as a catalyst for the NWUDP and further \nprivate  sector  initiatives.  If  the  NWUDP  is  successful,  it  will  through  the  guarantee  of  the  bond \nissue ensure that the water utilities in the PRC have access to private sector funds to finance the \nenormous demand for water and wastewater infrastructure expenditures. The bond issue will also \npromote international standards of accounting, corporate governance, and public disclosure. The \nestimated timetable for the NWUDP is (i) due diligence in November 2006, (ii) Credit Committee \nmeeting in December 2006, and (iii) Board consideration in the first quarter of 2007. \n \nD. \n \nThe  Yangtze  River  basin  (YRB)  is  the  largest  river  basin  in  the  PRC.  The  Changjiang \n6. \nWater Resources Commission, with overall responsibility for managing water resources within the \nYRB,  has  developed  a  basin  management  plan  with  a  framework  for  managing  YRB  water \nresources. The plan cites the deteriorating water quality of the Yangtze River. Though the river is \noften seen as having high assimilative capacity, the cumulative effect of the numerous point and \nnonpoint discharges is deteriorating its water quality. Effects are felt throughout the downstream \nreaches and the East China Sea. The plan sets out several general pollution control targets with \nspecific targets to be developed by individual provinces and cities.  \n\nWater Quality in the Yangtze and Qinhuai River Basins \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB.  2005.

The \nofficial  water  quality  target  for  the  lower  Qinhuai  River  is  class  V,  but  currently  the  river  fails  to \nachieve that target by a significant margin. When the Project is completed, the river water quality \nwill  be  improved  to  class  IV.  City  East  WWTP  expansion  alone  will  reduce  chemical  oxygen \ndemand  discharge  by  more  than  90,000  tons  per  year  once  fully  operational.  This  component \ntogether with others within this Project and being undertaken separately by NMG will contribute \nsignificantly  to  pollution  control  in  the  YRB.  In  addition,  the  ADB-funded  Wuhan  Wastewater \nManagement Project (2003) and Wuhan Wastewater and Stormwater Management Project (June \n2006)  will  contribute  to  pollution  control  in  the  YRB;  as  does  the  successfully  completed  ADB-\nsupported Suzhou Creek Rehabilitation Project.  \n \nE. \n \nTo build the necessary capacity for sound environmental management and strengthen the \n8. \nlegal  framework,  ADB  helped  train  staff  of  the  Environment  Protection  Commission,  and  is \nassisting  in  drafting  and  revising  some  of  the  PRC\u2019s  environmental  laws.4 ADB  is  helping  to \npromote a more effective legal and regulatory framework for environmental protection in light of \nthe  PRC\u2019s  transition  to  a  market  economy  and  its  adherence  to  international  environmental \nprotection agreements. ADB helped to upgrade the knowledge and skills of provincial legislative \ndrafters  in  the  review,  amendment,  and  formulation  of  local  legislation  related  to  the  protection \nand  conservation  of  the  environment  and  natural  resources. 5  In  addition,  ADB  provided \nassistance  in  environmental  management  by  improving  the  institutional  capacity  of  the  State \nEnvironment  Protection  Administration,  and  the  local  and  provincial  environmental  protection \nbureaus to strengthen environmental standards and enforce environmental laws and policies.6 \n \n9. \nThe Jiangsu Provincial Government and NMG have acknowledged their responsibilities to \nensure  that  commitments  given  in  the  environmental  impact  assessment  documentation  are \nadhered  to  during  project  implementation.  This  responsibility  will  be  discharged  by  the \nimplementing  agencies  in  conjunction  with  relevant  NMG  departments  and  a  specific  staff \nmember  will  be  designated  to  undertake  a  monitoring  and  coordination  role.  Establishment  of \nappropriate  monitoring  procedures  will  be  included  in  the  implementation  consulting  services \ncontract. \n \nF. \n \n10. \nPolicy  dialogue  on  wastewater  management  focuses  on  integrated  management  of \nindustrial  and  domestic  wastewater  including  on-site  treatment  and  public  sewer  connections. \nADB  has  supported  the  Government's  policies  for  wastewater  management  by  providing  a \nnumber of related environmental loans that include wastewater treatment components in Beijing, \nChaohu,  Chengde,  Fuzhou,  Hefei,  Qingdao,  Shanghai,  Tangshan,  Tianjin,  Wuhan,  Changchun \nand  along  the  Hai  River  system.  The  importance  of  wastewater  treatment  was  also  addressed \nunder  the  Urban  Environmental  Improvement  Planning  Study 7  that  strengthened  institutions \nresponsible  for  environmental  improvement  in  a  number  of  cities,  and  identified  future \ninfrastructure requirements.

These ADB projects and related initiatives provide a solid \nbasis for ongoing policy dialogue in wastewater management.  \n \n11. \nDiscussions were held with NMG on the need to identify overall investment plans for the \nsector  that  will  be  in  line  with  Nanjing\u2019s  urban  development  and  wastewater  master  plans.  The \nincremental  wastewater  treatment  capacity  that will  be  added  will  exceed  the  incremental  water \nsupply in the project area.  \n \nNMG  has  almost  completed  its  major  investment  in  the  lower  reaches  of  the  Outer \n12. \nQinhuai River and provided both flood protection and riverine parkland. In conjunction with this is \na stated policy to improve the urban environment within the Inner Qinhuai River system through \nwater replenishment and dredging in accordance with the short-term construction plan for Nanjing \nCity main town water environment improvement. \n \nG. \n \n13. \nThe Project includes works to improve the upper reaches of the Qinhuai River (Yunliang \nconfluence to Xibei village) to bring the existing embankments in line with national standards and \nprovide  flood  protection  levels  as  set  out  in  Flood  Control  Planning  for  Qinhuai  River  Basin. \nSimilar work is proposed for the South River to bring its service level in line with the city standard \nof flood protection for rivers of 1/100 year flood return event. \n\nFlood and Stormwater Drainage Management: \n\n \n\n14. \nThe  existing  stormwater  drainage  pipelines  for Nanjing  City  (inclusive  of  the  pipelines  of \nthe  combined  system)  total  1,153.4  km.  Since  reconstruction  has  not  been  carried  out  in  the \nwhole zone, some built-up areas cannot meet the flood protection standard, and the pipe network \nis  not  yet  complete.  Some  regions  have  below  standard  infrastructure,  undersized  pipes,  and \ninadequate  outlet  arrangements.  Some  urban  areas  still  have  the  combined  system  of  sewage \nand  rainwater.  In  many  areas  rainwater  is  drained  through  open  channels;  overflows  result  in \nserious river pollution. Therefore, reconstructing the stormwater drainage pipelines, upgrading the \nsystem standard, and thereby preventing further flooding problems are required. \n \nOne of the prime objectives of the Project is to improve stormwater drainage management \n15. \nin  urban  areas  of  Nanjing  and  to  alleviate  localized  urban  flooding  due  to  the  high  intensity  of \nrainfall  during  the  short  rainy  season  of  June  to  August.  NMG  has  prepared  and  approved  a \nwastewater master plan and water environmental improvement plans that provide a strategy for \nseparating  wastewater  and  stormwater  drainage.  The  proposed  stormwater  drainage  pipeline \nworks  accords  with  the  overall  objectives  of  the  water  environment  improvement  determined  in \nthe  short-term  construction  plan  for  Nanjing  City  main  town  water  environment  improvement. \nCompletion of separation systems will help reduce the health risks created by urban flooding and \nalso protect the WWTPs from hydraulic overload. \n \nH. \n \nNMG\u2019s  urban  greening  policy  seeks  to  ensure  a  prescribed  proportion  of  the  developed \n16. \nurban  area  is  urban  parkland  or  areas  under  some  form  of  plant  cultivation.  This  was \ndemonstrated  by  previous  projects,  which  established  a  riverine  park  along  12.5  km  of  the \nQinhuai River corridor through Nanjing City. Under the proposed Project, a 33 hectare (ha) park \n(Yunliang River park) at the confluence of the Yunliang and Outer Qinhuai rivers is proposed with \ndesign themes for recreation and conservation education. This park will meet the urgent need to \n\nUrban Parkland Development Strategy \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nSludge Management Strategy \n\nCorporate Governance and Enterprise Reform \n\nincrease  green  space  in  Nanjing  City.  By  reducing  impermeable  areas,  stormwater  runoff  is \nreduced as well. \n \nI. \n \nPolicy  dialogue  on  sludge  management  focuses  on  integrated  management  of  sludge \n17. \ngenerated  from  water  treatment  plants,  wastewater  treatment  plants  (WWTP),  and  municipal \nsludge  comprising  river  dredging  and  cleansing  of  drainage  pipelines.  NMG  recognizes  that \nprovision of increased water supply leads to an increase in the volume of wastewater generated \nand consequently an increase in sludge produced from both water treatment plants and WWTPs. \nProvision  of  adequate  sludge  handling,  treatment,  and  disposal  facilities  is  essential  to  public \nhealth.  This  must  be  taken  in  phases  because  of  high  costs  involved.  The  success  of  sludge \nmanagement policy will impact the sector objective of secondary pollution reduction and also the \ncost-effectiveness of sludge management and operation. An overall sludge management strategy \nincluding an action plan will be prepared as part of the Project.  \n \nJ. \n \n18. \nADB\u2019s  urban  infrastructure  projects  are  aimed  to  address  various  aspects  of  corporate \ngovernance reform: (i) structuring the utility companies along commercial lines, (ii) assisting these \nutilities to prepare business plans, (iii) strengthening the operation of the boards of directors for \nthe  companies,  and  (iv)  implementing  external  and  internal  audit  arrangements.  This  supports \nState  Circular  1,192  (1999),  jointly  issued  by  the  National  Development  Reform  Commission, \nMinistry  of  Construction,  and  State  Environment  Protection  Administration,  which  identified  the \nestablishment of enterprise companies as the preferred institutional model for urban infrastructure \nservices.  \n \n19. \nImproved  corporate  governance  and  enterprise  reforms  under  this  Project  also  support \nthe  implementation  of  (i)  tariff  reforms  for  improved  cost  recovery  through  improved  budgeting \nand  improved  financial  management;  (ii)  appropriate  use  of  private  sector  participation  such  as \naccess  to  capital  markets  to  finance  wastewater  infrastructure  as  being  investigated  under  the \nNanjing  Water  Utility  Long-term  Capital  Finance  in  Commercial  Markets  TA  (footnote  2);  (iii) \nstrengthened  environmental  management  for  compliance  with  environmental  laws  and  policies; \nand  (iv)  more  integrated  wastewater  management  to  focus  on  accountability  and  allocation  of \nresources, and improvements in service standards. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \n \nNo. \nA.

NDMD  has  considerable  expertise  in  drainage  engineering, \nmaintenance of drainage networks including puming stations, and water and effluents testing. \n \n16. \nOperational  Management  Capacity.  Currently,  NDMD\u2019s  Network  Management  Unit \nmaintains  193  km  of  sewers  (of  1,100  km  in  Nanjing),  495  km  of  combined  storm  drains  (of \n1,700  km  in  Nanjing),  and  28  km  of  intercepting  channels.  Its  experience  is  adequate  to \nmaintain the additional stormwater network.  \n \n17. \nFinancial  Management  Capacity. Overall, the financial management arrangements of \nNDMD  are  satisfactory  and  can  be  relied  on  to  support  effective  project  management.  Key \nfeatures  of  the  current  arrangements  are  (i)  use  of  an  accrual  basis  of  accounting  and \nadherence  to  relevant  national  accounting  standards,  (ii)  use  of  appropriate  internal  controls, \n(iii)   adequately  trained  and  qualified  staff,  (iv)  use  of  computerized  accounting  records,  and \n(v) use of internal auditors reporting to the NDMD director general. Current audit arrangements, \nincluding internal audit and external government audit, meet ADB\u2019s audit requirements. NDMD \nstaff will be trained in ADB loan processing policies and procedures. \n \nCapacity-Building  Support.  The  capacity-building  initiatives  for  NDMD  under  the \n18. \nProject  will  focus  on  (i)  training  in  relevant  ADB  project  funding  procedures;  and  (ii)  review  of \norganizational structure, and operations and maintenance to identify ways to improve efficiency. \n \nFuture  Financial  Performance. NDMD is a non-revenue-generating legal entity and a \n19. \ngovernment  department  within  Nanjing  Municipal  Public  Utilities  Bureau.  NMG  provides  the \nfunds  for  constructing  approved  projects.  The  service  is  funded  from  the  local  government \nbudget.  Annual  operation  and  maintenance  costs  for  the  Project  are  much  less  than  1%  of \ngovernment revenues. Funding has therefore been generally adequate and should continue to \nbe adequate to assure sustainable benefits from project improvements.  \n \nD. \n \n20. \nThe assessment of sustainability covers both the construction and operational phases of \nthe  Project  and  considers  financial  and  managerial  capabilities.  In  light  of  the  resources  and \nexperience of the IAs and the arrangements planned for project construction and operation, the \nProject is considered likely to be sustainable. Certain deficiencies and risks have been identified \nand  mitigation  measures  for  these  are  in  place  or  are  proposed  in  the  form  of  project \nassurances  and  provisions  for  capacity  building.  The  tariff  reforms  undertaken  by  NMG, \nincluding  the  generation  of  project  construction  funds  ($20.0  million)  directly  from  wastewater \ntariffs,  will  contribute  significantly  to  project  sustainability.  Further,  the  tariff  reforms  (para.  7) \ndemonstrate that NMG is highly progressive in adopting tariff reforms. \n \n\nConclusion  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE \n \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n2011 \n\n1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ni\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n9\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4\n5\n\n \n\nComponents \n  \nInner Qinhuai River Sewerage and Water Replenishment Component \n\nA.

The  individual  resettlement  plans  of  five \nsubprojects  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  Land \nAdministration  Law  and  involuntary  resettlement  policy1 of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB). \nThe  resettlement  plans  provide  a  socioeconomic  profile  of  the  people  affected  and  scope  of \nimpacts,  and  address  issues  related  to  entitlements:  compensation,  legal  framework,  public \nconsultations,  grievance  procedures,  rehabilitation  measures,  budget,  and \nimplementation \nmilestones.  Resettlement  planning  and  implementation  is  designed  to  ensure  that  all  those \naffected will be better-off or at least not worse-off as a result of the Project. \n \nA. \n \nImpacts  related  to  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  include  people  affected  by  (i) \n2. \npermanent acquisition of land for the wetland park, sludge disposal facility, and pumping stations; \n(ii)  temporary  use  of  land  for  the  rehabilitation  of  river  banks  and  installation  of  trunk  sewer \npipelines,  and  (iii)  demolition  of  houses  or  buildings.  The  resettlement  requirements  have  been \ncarefully  considered  and  incorporated  into  project  design.  Through  the  optimum  engineering \nproject  design,  the  resettlement  impacts  were  significantly  reduced.  As  a  result,  only  one \ncomponent will have significant land acquisition and resettlement impacts. \n \nIn  total,  the  Project  will  require  (i)  permanent  acquisition  of  63.5  hectares  (ha)  of  land,  of \n3. \nwhich  33.5  ha  is  rural  collective  land;  (ii)  temporary  acquisition  of  97.6  ha,  of  which  12  ha  is \nclassified  as  rural  collective  land;  and  (iii)  demolition  of  50,899  square  meters  (m2)  of  residential \nhousing and 48,895 m2 of enterprises and shops. Accordingly, 803 people will be affected, of which \n339 will be affected by permanent land acquisition, and 455 residents and 272 staff of enterprises \nand  shops  affected  by  house/building  demolition.  In  addition,  some  public  infrastructures  and \nfacilities will be affected, including roads, culverts, fiber cables, electric poles, and transformers. No \nindigenous  people  or  ethnic  minorities  will  be  adversely  affected  by  the  Project.  The  project \nimpacts of the five components are summarized in Table A11.1.  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nAs  well  as  complying  with  the  laws  and  regulations  of  the  PRC  and  ADB\u2019s  involuntary \nresettlement policy, the resettlement plans are based on the provisions of the Land Administrative \nLaw  of  the  PRC  (1999),  and  the  State  Council  Decision  to  Deepen  Reform  and  Strictly  Enforce \nLand Administration (2004). In addition, the following associated laws and regulations are applied \nto resettlement under the Project: (i) Jiangsu Provincial Land Administration Regulation (2001), (ii) \nNanjing  Municipal  Land  Acquisition  and  House  Demolition  Administration  Regulation  (2004),  and \n(iii) Nanjing Municipal Land Expropriated Farmers\u2019 Basic Living Security Regulation (2004). \n \n\nPolicy and Legal Framework \n\nItem \nA.

The \nresettlement  principles  established  for  the  Project  are  (i)  land  acquisition  and  involuntary \nresettlement should be avoided or minimized where feasible by developing and comparing a series \nof design alternatives; (ii) compensation and entitlements provided are based on market value or \nreplacement  value  and  must  be  adequate  to  allow  those  affected  to  at  least  maintain  their  pre-\nproject standard of living with the prospect of improvement; (iii) land temporarily occupied should \nbe adequately compensated for and periods of disruption are to be kept to a minimum; (iv) farmers \nlosing  working  opportunities  on  the  land  have  their  registration  changed  to  take  advantage  of \nregistration  as  urban  residents;  (v)  a  preferential  policy  will  be  provided  to  vulnerable  groups  in \nsuch  things  as  compensation,  housing  assignment,  transfer,  and  employment;  (vi)  all  those \naffected will be adequately informed about eligibility, compensation rates and standards, livelihood \nand income restoration plans, and project timing; and (vii) close monitoring and timely actions will \nbe carried out to identify and resolve any problems. \n \n6. \nSeventy  percent  of  the  land  compensation  fee  and  entire  resettlement  subsidy  will  be \ndisbursed directly to the personal account of those affected to join a special pension system (Land \nExpropriated Farmers\u2019 Basic Living Security), which was established for land loss farmers with the \nsubsidy from the Nanjing municipal government. The remaining 30% of land compensation will be \nmanaged  by  the  village  committee  for  pubic  purposes.  For  residential  houses,  enterprises,  and \ncommercial shops, compensation will be paid to owners directly. The payment will be made in cash \naccording to the replaced value of the property. Households that have to relocate will also receive \na  special  subsidy  for  purchasing  a  new  apartment,  and  a  transfer  and  transportation  allowance. \nCompensation  for  standing  crops,  auxiliaries,  and  other  assets  will  be  paid  directly  to  affected \nfarmers. All infrastructure, facilities, and other assets will be compensated at replacement rates to \nallow full reconstruction by the owners. \n \nC. \n \n7. \nThe  resettlement  strategy  encompasses  the  restoration  of  livelihood  and  income.  People \nlosing housing in rural areas have two resettlement options: receive cash compensation or apply \nfor  economical  affordable  housing  provided  by  the  NMG.  The  new  apartment  housing  will  have \nbetter  infrastructure,  e.g.,  water,  sewer,  road,  sanitary  facilities,  school,  and  supermarkets.  The \nrespective  IAs  and  local  governments  will  provide  necessary  assistance  for  relocation  during \nresettlement and implementation.  \n \n\nResettlement and Rehabilitation  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11       53 \n\nResettlement Cost and Fund Management  \n\n8. \nThe  economic  rehabilitation  measures  include  (i)  provision  of  employment  opportunities \nduring the project construction and operation phases; (ii) arrangements for those affected to benefit \nfrom  Land  Expropriated  Farmers\u2019  Basic  Living  Security,  and  the  individuals  can  choose  the \nstandard payment of basic living security; (iii) provision of skill training and employment information; \n(iv) provision of monthly living subsidy for affected farmers who are unemployed for a fixed time; (v) \nprovision  of  microcredit  loans  for  business,  subsidy  for  social  insurance,  and  other  preferential \nemployment  policies;  (vi)  provision  of  the  information  of  the  vacant  workshop  or  shop  sites  for \naffected enterprises or shops. \n \nTo  ensure  maximum  protection  of  vulnerable  households  during  the  land  acquisition  and \n9. \nresettlement  process,  the  following  special  provisions  are  made.  First,  vulnerable  groups  will  be \ngiven  priority  for  employment  opportunities  with  the  Project.  Second,  incorporation  of  the  needs \nand  interests  of  vulnerable  groups  in  resettlement  planning  and  implementation  will  be  ensured \nthrough focused consultation and participation programs. Third, vulnerable groups living below the \nmunicipal  poverty  line  can  benefit  from  the  minimum  standard  of  living  system  for  rural  residents \nand get some allowance each month.  \n \nD. \n \n10. \nThe cost estimate for land acquisition and resettlement is CNY409.09 million, equivalent to \n$50.45  million,  including  contingencies,  taxes,  and  fees  for  resettlement  administration.  This  cost \nwill  be  included  in  the  total  project  cost.  According  to  the  compensation  policies  and  standards \ndefined  in  the  resettlement  plan,  the  payment  and  use  of  resettlement  funds  will  be  carried  out \nunder the supervision of internal monitors with regular review by the external monitoring agency.  \n \nE. \n \n11.  People affected were notified about the key elements of the resettlement plans prior to ADB \nloan appraisal. On various occasions during meetings, interviews, focus group discussions, public \nconsultation  workshops,  and  community  consultation  meetings,  local  representatives  have \nparticipated in  the  planning,  and  concerns  have  been  integrated  into  the  resettlement  plans.  The \nresettlement  information  booklets  or  the  draft  resettlement  plans  were  disseminated  to  affected \nhouseholds  and  village  offices  on  1  September  2006.  The  information  booklet  contains  the \nresettlement scope, project schedule, compensation rates for land and other assets, relocation and \neconomic  rehabilitation  strategies,  and  grievance  redress  mechanisms.  The  draft  resettlement \nplans were uploaded onto the ADB website on 26 September 2006.2 The final resettlement plans \nwere  uploaded  onto  the  ADB  website  on  13  November  2006.  The  respective  project  IAs  will \nestablish project resettlement units for supervising implementation, continuing public consultation, \nmonitoring progress, and responding to grievances. \n \nF. \n \n12.  The Nanjing project management office will coordinate the overall planning, implementation, \ninternal  monitoring  and  evaluation,  financing,  and  reporting  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement. \nEach IA will have concerned full-time staff responsible for land acquisition and resettlement. They \nwill work closely with relevant municipal and district land administration bureaus, house demolition \n\nInformation Disclosure, Participation, and Grievance \n\nInstitutional Responsibilities  \n\n                                                 \n2   Resettlement  plans  (RP)  were  prepared  for  all  five  components.  Based  on  subsequent  review  by  Environment  and \nSocial  Safeguard  Division  (RSES),  it  was  decided  that  only  three  components  required  RPs,  since  two  components \nhad  no  impacts  on  people.  The  three  components  with  resettlement  impacts  included  the  (i)  Inner  Qinhuai  River \nSewerage and Water Replenishment, (ii) City East Wastewater Treatment Plant, and (iii) Sludge Treatment. These will \nbe monitored for compliance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\noffices,  and  village/street  officials;  and  will  be  responsible  for  delivering  entitlements,  distributing \neconomical affordable housing, and implementing the economic measures for those affected.  \n \nG. \n \n13.  The  Nanjing  municipal  government  and  the  IAs  will  take  full  responsibility  for  the  internal \nmonitoring  to  ensure  that  the  Project  complies  with  requirements  described  in  the  resettlement \nplans. The project management office and IAs will engage an independent agency for semiannual \nmonitoring  and  annual  evaluation  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  until  2  years  after  the \ncompletion  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  External  monitoring  reports  will  be  submitted \ndirectly to both the project management office and ADB.   \n \nH. \n \n14.  Resettlement implementation will be scheduled to precede subproject construction. Given the \nasynchronous  schedule  for  different  components,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  will \ncommence  from  December  2006  to  August  2008.  Construction  will  not  take  place  before  those \naffected are fully compensated. Detailed measurement surveys will be conducted in each village, \nneighborhood, and enterprise; and the compensation contacts will be negotiated and signed with \nvillage committees, households, and enterprises. \n \n\nResettlement Implementation \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12       55 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \n \nThe  Nanjing Qinhuai River Environmental Improvement Project has potential to benefit 2.9 million inhabitants through \nimprovements  to  the  disposal  of  wastewater  and  flushing  of  the  canal  system.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction  through  increased  quality  of  life  by  reducing  the  incidence  of  waterborne  disease  and  flood  risk  in  urban \nNanjing,  and  providing  employment  opportunities  during  construction  and  operation  of  the  project  facilities,  with \nanticipated effects on economic development. \n \nThe  Project  will  assist  with  the  country\u2019s  progress  in  meeting  Millennium  Development  Goal  (MDG)  7,  target  10  to \nhalve  by  2015  the  proportion  of  people  without  access  to  basic  sanitation  by  increasing  coverage  of  the  Nanjing \nwastewater  system  to  serve  an  additional  2.7  million  people  by  2010.  It  will  contribute  to  estimated  reductions  in \nmedical costs incurred as a result of contracting waterborne disease in Nanjing amounting to approximately CNY142 \nper person, or CNY824 million total. Health  benefits are  expected to be felt disproportionately by  women since they \nare  more  vulnerable  to  waterborne  diseases  due  to  greater  contact  with  water  from  household  responsibilities \n(especially cooking and washing), and are most responsible for care of the young and old when they are sick. \n \nThe Project will create approximately 60,000 person-years of work or an average of about 30,000 full-time equivalent \njobs during construction. Follow-on multiplier effects are expected to create an additional 78,000 full-time jobs. Three \nquarters of the construction jobs are assumed to be unskilled and are likely to be filled by the currently unemployed. \nSince  unemployment  is  a  cause  of  poverty  in  the  project  area,  the  poor  will  benefit  disproportionately  from  this  job \ncreation.  Those  temporarily  employed  in  construction  will  benefit  from  additional  training  and  experience  that  will \nprovide them with opportunities in future planned infrastructure projects. The associated wages for workers translate \nto  CNY543  million  of  project  costs  that  will  return  to  the  local  economy.  Project  operations  will  create  450  full-time \npermanent jobs directly and another 710 jobs through multiplier effects, corresponding to approximately CNY42 million \nin wages per year. \n\n \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                            Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nA  poverty  and  social  analysis  was  undertaken  in  line  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  guidelines  to  collect \ndetailed social information necessary to inform project design, and identify poverty reduction and social development \nobjectives,  outcomes,  and  indicators.  The  analysis  identifies  vulnerable  groups  and  opportunities  for  pro-poor \ninterventions;  and  recommends  social  action  measures,  participation,  and  mitigation  plans  to  achieve  positive  social \nbenefits. \n\n \n\nNanjing  City  has  a  population  of  6.24  million  people  or  1.912  million  households.  Approximately  5%  of  households \nlive  in  poverty.  The  poverty  line  in  Nanjing  (urban)  is  CNY260  per  capita  per  month.  The  project  socioeconomic \nanalysis  identified  that  Nanjing\u2019s  poor,  defined  as  those  living  at  or  only  just  above  the  poverty  line  are  100%  Han \nChinese and have an average age of 47.  Most are retired (22.6%), casual laborers (17%), own their own business \n(16%), or unemployed (15%). They are most likely to live in a family of two people, in Bai Xia or Gulou districts in an \napartment  (most  likely  ground  floor  or  above  the  7th  floor)  of  one  or  two  rooms,  with  a  living  area  of  24.5  square \nmeters per person. Fifty-two percent of the poor own their dwelling. One third of the poor are either illiterate or have \nonly a primary education. Twenty-one percent of the poor have one child, and a further 6% have two children. Almost \nhalf  (47%)  of  the  poor  are  unmarried/widowed  or  live  without  a  partner  (61%  female,  39%  male\u2014the  difference \nattributable to many more female senior citizens). Of these poor single adult households, 48% of households headed \nby  women  are  in  the  25\u201360  year  age  group  (prime  working  and  most  likely  married  age  group),  and  42%  of \nhouseholds  headed  by  men  are  in  the  same  age  group.  Twenty-three  percent  of  poor  single  adult  families  are \nsupporting a child (78% female, 22% male). \n \nThe average poor household uses 7.8 tons of water per month based on their last water bill, 5 tons per month less \nthan the average Nanjing household. Seventy-one percent of the poor pay the tap water company for their water and \nwastewater,  2%  pay  a  factory,  2%  pay  a  neighbor,  and  7%  do  not  pay  at  all.  Ninety-one  percent  of  the  poor  are \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nconnected  to  the  public  sewer  for  disposal  of  wastewater,  a  further  4%  discharge  to  an  open  drain,  and  5%  to  a \nseptic  tank.  The  poor  are  disproportionately  affected  by  wastewater  system  constraints.  Forty-one  percent  of  the \npoor reported a major problem with wastewater overflows in their neighborhood (compared with 26% for the nonpoor), \nand  34%  reported  a  major  problem  with  bad  smells  from  the  wastewater  system  (compared  with  27%  for  the \nnonpoor). The poor are also more likely to suffer from problems associated with stormwater drainage (42% compared \nwith 29% for the nonpoor) and surface flooding occurring two or more times a year (49% compared with 17% for the \nnonpoor).  Despite  this  however,  the  poor  and  nonpoor  have  no  significant  differences  with  regard  to  incidence  of \ndisease  linked  with  a  poor  sanitary  environment  and  others.  Apart  from  the  elderly,  the  other  two  groups \noverrepresented among the poor are those with relatively low education and the unemployed. Both these groups will \nbenefit from employment opportunities generated by the Project, where approximately two thirds of jobs are low- or \nunskilled. \n \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nThe poverty and social assessment utilized a number of participation processes to solicit the input of a cross section \nof stakeholders. In addition to the socioeconomic survey of 655 households, a range of community meetings were held \nwith  both  women  and  men  in  different  parts  of  the  city  to  discuss,  in  an  open-ended  manner,  topics  related  to  the \nProject  but  not  specifically  covered  in  the  socioeconomic  survey.  A  number  of  key  informant  interviews  were  held \nwith  various  bureaus,  nongovernment  organizations,  women\u2019s \nin \ncomplementary areas, etc. to inform project design. Formulation of resettlement plans used separate socioeconomic \nsurveys, community meetings, opinion surveys, and impact studies from April to June 2006, involving more than 500 \npeople.  \n\nfederation,  past  and  ongoing  projects \n\n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\nTargeted analysis reveals that public awareness of the Project is high and generally very positive. Development of \nthe environmental management plan and environmental impact assessment involved two rounds of public consultations \nin late May and early June 2006, shortly after beginning environmental impact assessment preparation. The purpose \nwas to introduce the Project  and the relevant components and subcomponents to a range  of stakeholders, and to \nsolicit  their  views  on  the  Project  and  its  potential  environmental  implications,  so  that  the  environmental  impact \nassessment could take these into account. Most stakeholders already had good knowledge of the Project due to the \npreparation work undertaken by design institutes and the project management office (PMO). Both the resettlement \nplan and environmental management plan set out detailed ongoing public participation plans. Public participation is \nalso planned for project monitoring and evaluation. \n\n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \n An  assurance  is  included  that  men  and  women  will  have  equal  employment  opportunity  in  the  operation  and \nmaintenance of infrastructure. Men stand to benefit more than women from the unskilled construction jobs that will be \ncreated through the Project, due to the requirement for physically demanding labor. However women\u2019s participation \nin  the  skilled  operation  and  maintenance  work  will  be  encouraged  as  a  number  of  women  are  already  working  in \nthese  sectors  and  an  equal  number  of  male  and  female  graduates  have  technical  qualifications.  Consultation  with \nwomen will be required for the resettlement plans. The socioeconomic analysis shows that women are equally likely \nto be living in poverty as men, however are slightly overrepresented among the elderly poor, who are more likely to be \nfemale than male, and assumed to be a product of longer female life expectancy. Women in focus groups noted that \nthe  improvement  to  riverside  areas  would  benefit  them  disproportionately,  providing  safe,  clean,  well-lit  areas  for \nthem to walk and meet friends. Older women in recently improved areas reported much use of improved urban areas \nin their neighborhoods for exercise and recreation.  \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fE.

This increase is affordable even to the \npoorest income group. The poor will spend about 1.6% of \nhousehold income for proposed 50% increase in the cost \nof water and wastewater. This is within the international \nthreshold of 3%. Furthermore, the minimum living \nstandard guarantee is adjusted frequently to reflect the \nincrease of basic needs of the poor such as electricity, \nwater, health, education, and transport services.  \n\n \nThe dominant ethnic group in Nanjing is Han, comprising \n98.5% of the population. The remaining 1.5% consists of \n50 other ethnic groups, the main one being Hui followed \nby Man then Zhuang (533). Ethnic minorities in Nanjing \nare not characterized by any marked difference in income \nor occupational group from the Han majority. As such, no \nethnic minority development plan will be required for this \nProject. \n \n\nNanjing has a large floating population (temporary rural-\nto-urban migrants) that may be considered a vulnerable \ngroup under this Project, although they stand to gain from \nemployment opportunities, being concentrated in the \nunskilled job sectors. The source of their vulnerability, \napart from a generally lower education, comes from the \nlack of benefits (housing, social, medical) associated with \nresidence registration. The PMO will ensure contractors \nappraise and guide workers on the application procedure \nfor temporary residence registration to ensure the \nsafeguards of all members of the floating population \nemployed in project construction, operation, and \nmaintenance. \n \n\n \nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\n \n1. \nThe  financial  analysis  of  the  Project  involves  benefit-cost  analysis  and  computation  of \nthe  Project\u2019s  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR).  The  FIRR  was  computed  only  for  project \ncomponents  that  are  revenue  generating.

By May 2006, financial management assessment \nquestionnaires  provided  to  the  three  IAs  were  complete.  The  project  team  met  with  the  IAs\u2019 \naccounting  divisions  to  review  the  responses,  and  found  that  the  IAs  have  experience \nimplementing projects of a similar size to the proposed Project and their financial management \nis capable of properly handling the Project. \n \n3. \nFinancial  Performance  Assessment. The financial performance assessment is based \non  an  analysis  of  standard  financial  performance  ratios.  Nanjing  Municipal  Engineering \nConstruction  Department  (NMECD)  and  Nanjing  Municipal  Drainage  Department  (NDMD)  are \nlegal  entities  within  Nanjing  Municipal  Public  Utilities  Bureau,  which  is  a  part  of  the  Nanjing \nmunicipal  government.  The  financial  performance  assessment  for  Nanjing  Construction \nInvestment  Company  (NCIC)  is  based  on  the  financial  ratios  calculated  from  the  company\u2019s \n2003, 2004, and 2005 audited financial statements.   \n \n4. \nThe financial performance assessment of NCIC is based on annual pro-forma financial \nstatements  encompassing  20  years,  commencing  with  the  commissioning  of  the  project \ncomponents  (Supplementary  Appendix  G).  NCIC  is  expected  to  achieve  the  covenanted \nfinancial and capital structure ratios once project operation commences.   \n \nFinancial  Assessment  of  Project  Subcomponents. The FIRR calculations of the six \n5. \nrevenue-generating  subcomponents  are  based  on  constant  2006  prices  using  incremental \nannual cash flows over 20 years of operations following commissioning of the civil works. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13       59 \n\nWeighted  Average  Cost  of  Capital.  The  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  is \n6. \ncalculated in real terms for all project components based on nominal interest rates, income tax \nrate of 33%, and international and domestic rates of inflation (Table A13.2). \n  \n\nTable A13.2: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n\nTotal \n\nNMG Funds \n\nADB \nLoan \n100.0 \n42 \n5.65 \n33 \n3.79 \n1.90 \n1.85 \n0.78 \n\nFinancing Component \nDomestic \nBank Loan \n54.9 \n23 \n6.39 \n33 \n4.28 \n2.90 \n1.21 \n0.31 \n\n \n \nItem \nA.

The  FIRR  is  calculated  for  each  project \nsubcomponent  and  ranges  from  5.13%  to  8.11%.  The  after-tax  FIRR  for  the  overall  Project  is \nestimated  to  be  6.20%  for  the  base  case  scenario.  These  results  compare  favorably  with  the \nWACC of 2.79%. \n \n8. \nsensitivity analysis, in addition to the base case: \n \n\nSensitivity  Analysis.  The  project  team  tested  the  following  four  scenarios  in  the \n\n236.1 \n100 \n \n \n \n \n \n2.79 \n\n81.2 \n35 \n8.00 \n0 \n8.00 \n2.90 \n4.96 \n1.70 \n\nFinancial \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nproject investment cost increases by 10%, \nproject operating costs increase by 10%, \ncurrency exchange rate increases by 10%, and \nconstruction delayed by 1 year for wastewater projects. \n\n \n9.  \nConclusion.  The  sensitivity  analysis  shows  robust  results.  Even  if  the  worse  case \nsituations occur, the FIRR exceeds the real WACC. Therefore, the Project is financially viable \nand sustainable. Nanjing municipal government is highly progressive on tariff reforms and has \ncommitted  to  raise  CNY162  million  ($20.0  million)  directly  from  wastewater  tariff  increases  for \nthe Project. Nanjing Price Bureau successfully held public hearing meetings on 28 August 2006 \nto discuss and seek public support for the proposed wastewater tariff increase from the current \nlevel  of  CNY1.05/m3  to  CNY1.40/m3  by  December  2006  and  CNY1.60/m3  by  2010,  exceeding \nthe estimated full cost-recovery requirement of CNY1.57/m3 in 2010. The water and wastewater \ntariff reforms in Nanjing will contribute significantly to the financial sustainability of the Project. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n\nThis  economic  analysis  of \n\n1. \nthe  proposed  Nanjing  Qinhuai  River  Environmental \nImprovement  Project  covers  project  justification,  general  parameters  for  economic  analysis, \nbenefits  and  costs,  least-cost  analysis,  and  calculations  of  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return \n(EIRR).  The  EIRR  is  calculated  for  each  of  the  Project\u2019s  10  activities  or  subcomponents  (Table \nA14.1) and the Project as a whole.  \n \n\nTable A14.1.

Public  perceptions  and  preferences  were  evaluated  using  a \nhousehold  survey.  The  results  demonstrate  that  the  public  gives  high  priority  to  wastewater \nmanagement,  waterborne  disease  prevention,  river  cleaning,  and  flood-damage  control.  The \nProject will benefit more than 2.7 million urban residents of Nanjing whose living conditions and \npublic  health  standards  will  be  improved.  In  addition,  another  0.7  million  unregistered  floating \npeople (temporary rural-to-urban migrants) will benefit from the Project. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14         61 \n\nCosts \n\nBenefits \n\nGeneral Parameters \n\nB.  \n \n3. \nThe economic analysis was conducted by comparing situations with- and without-Project. \nThe study period covers 25 years including 5 years of construction from 2007 to 2011. Economic \nbenefits and costs are denominated in domestic price numeraire and expressed in constant 2006 \nprices.  Tradable  components  are  converted  to  economic  prices  using  a  shadow  exchange  rate \nfactor  of  1.013,  and  nontraded  components  are  valued  at  domestic  market  prices.  A  shadow \nwage rate factor of 0.67 was applied to the wage of unskilled labor to account for unemployment \nand underemployment.  \n \nC.  \n \nProject  costs  include  capital  investment  costs  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs. \n4. \nCosts were allocated to tradable, nontradable, skilled, and unskilled labor. Appropriate conversion \nfactors, e.g., shadow exchange rate and shadow wage rate, were applied accordingly. Transfer \npayments,  including  taxes  and  interests,  are  excluded  from  the  economic  costs,  while  physical \ncontingencies are included.  \n \nD.  \n \nFloods affect, on average, about 7% of the population in the project area each year. The \n5. \nfour subcomponents with a flood-reduction impact (I.2+3+4; II.3+4+5; III.2+3; IV.1) will have direct \nbenefits for 100,000 households, equivalent to about 281,000 people. According to the household \naurvey, as the Project is expected to reduce the probability of flooding in the project area by 90%, \nthe value of annual flood losses avoided would be CNY523 per household likely to experience a \nflood loss. The total benefits to the 100,000 households would thus be around CNY52.3 million. \nSuch  benefits,  however,  only  account  for  direct  losses  of  the  households  without  considering \ndirect losses and indirect losses to other sectors in the economy. To address this issue, an area-\nbased  total  flood  damage  estimate  was  used  to  make  the  benefit  forecast.  According  to  the \nDartmouth College flood database, which is based on the historical data in the project province \nfrom 1989 to 2005, a typical flood in the project area causes total damage of $91,042 per square \nkilometer  (km2),  which  includes  direct,  indirect,  and  induced  economic  losses  to  households, \ncommerce,  industry,  and  agriculture.  Applying  such  an  area-based  estimate  to  the  Project  is  a \nconservative estimate because it is an average over a combined urban and rural area, and actual \nlosses of agricultural production in rural areas are lower than losses experienced by commerce \nand industry in urban areas on a per km2 basis. The Project is expected to reduce flood damage \nby 90% in a total area of about 311.05 km2.  \n \n6.   Wastewater management subcomponents (II.2; V.1) include a new wastewater treatment \nfacility with a capacity of 100,000 cubic meters (m3) per day (i.e., 36.5 million m3 per year) at the \nCity East site, and a new sludge treatment facility with a capacity of 50,000 tons at the Jiang Xin \nZhou  site,  which  currently  has  a  wastewater  treatment  capacity  of  233.6  million  m3  per  year. \nAccording to the household survey, which was based on the previous projects\u2019 successful survey \nmethodology and questionnaire design, an average household in the project area is willing to pay \nCNY0.164 per ton of water consumed for the increased wastewater treatment capacity. A recent \nstudy  sponsored  by  the  United  Nations  indicates  that  the  unit  cost  for  small-  to  medium-sized \nindustrial  plants  to  treat  industrial  wastewater  is  CNY1.46  per  m3.  Given  that  the  Project  will \nincrease the city\u2019s wastewater treatment ratio from 75% to 85%, the industrial willingness to pay \n(WTP) for the Project is assumed to be 10% of the unit cost of industrial wastewater treatment, \ni.e.,  CNY0.146  per  m3.  Water  consumption  data  were  collected  from  the  Public  Utility  Bureau. \nGiven  the  competing  forces  of  the  increased  population  (including  rural  in-migrants)  that  will \n\n \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nincrease  the  water  demand  versus  the  increased  water  tariff  that  may  lower  the  demand,  the \nfuture water consumption was forecast by assuming a minor annual growth rate of 0.5%.   \n \n7.  \nThe lack of proper sewers and stagnant waters in clogged drains, canals, and moats are \nbelieved to be a major cause of waterborne disease. Six subcomponents (I.1, I.2+3+4; II.1; III.1; \nIII.2+3;  V.2)  will  have  a  health  cost-reduction  benefit:  (i)  Inner  Qinhuai  River  sewer  interceptors \nwith a capacity of processing 149 million m3 of wastewater per year, (ii) Inner Qinhuai River water \nreplenishment,  (iii)  City  East  23  km  of  new  sewers,  (iv)  North  He  Xi  District  28.7  km  of  new \nsewers, (v) Hexi District river improvement and (vi) sludge disposal facility at Mount Fenghuang. \nThe health cost reductions will directly benefit 19.9% of the households living in the project area, \nwhich has a total of 112,000 beneficiary households (about 314,720 people). The economic value \nof the annual health cost savings (40% reduction in annual costs) is expected to be CNY400 per \nhousehold.  Thus,  the  total  benefits  to  the  112,000  beneficiary  households  will  be  CNY44.8 \nmillion.  If  the  WTP  is  used,  health  benefits  should  be  removed  from  the  benefits  part  to  avoid \ndouble counting, unless the WTP does not cover positive externality effects of the health benefits. \nTo be conservative, this analysis did not include health benefits because the WTP was used in all \nthe components whenever it is applicable.  \n \n8. \nIn  addition,  the  Project  is  likely  to  improve  tourism  and  increase  property  values  in  the \nproject area. Also, the public-private partnership used in this Project will provide a practical model \nfor  future  urban  infrastructure  financing  and  have  the  potential  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  the \npublic  capital  market.  To  avoid  double  counting  and  be  conservative  in  the  analysis,  these \npotential  benefits  were  not  included  in  the  benefit-cost  analysis.  Also,  the  benefits  from  the \nProject\u2019s economic multiplier effects were not considered as they are difficult to quantify.  \n \nE. \n \n9. \nThe direct beneficiaries include the estimated 87,000 registered residents living below the \nofficial poverty line and many of the approximately 700,000 nonregistered migrants in search of \nwork  in  the  city.  The  urban  poor  will  derive  disproportionately  greater  benefits  from  the  Project \nsince they generally live in poorly served neighborhoods; while project costs are relatively heavier \non enterprises and the better-off households given government\u2019s progressive taxation, user fees, \nand poverty reduction policies.  \n \nF.  \n \nThe  least-cost  analysis  of  alternative  technologies  and  materials  to  be  used  in \n10.  \nsubcomponents  was  based  on  the  incremental  economic  costs  over  the  alternatives\u2019  economic \nlives.  A  discount  rate  of  12%  was  used  to  calculate  the  present  value  of  economic  costs  and \naverage incremental economic costs. The present value of economic cost approach was adopted \nfor  the  sewerage  network  subproject  and  river  improvement  subproject  where  a  measurable \noutput  is  not  available.  The  average  incremental  economic  cost  approach  was  used  for \ncomponents  with  a  measurable  output,  such  as  the  City  East  wastewater  treatment  plant \n(WWTP).  All  costs  and  outputs  are  estimated  by  comparing  situations  with  and  without  the \nProject.  \n \n\nDistribution of Project Costs and Benefits \n\nLeast-Cost Analysis \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nFor the sewerage network, using high density polyethylene pipes was found to be \ncost-effective compared to using reinforced concrete (RC) pipes.  \nFor the WWTP, using the anaerobic anoxic oxidation (A2O) process was found to \nbe less costly than using the Orbal oxidation process.   \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14         63 \n\n(iii) \n\nFor the river improvement components, using lump stone for lining of river banks \nwas found to be less costly than using reinforced concrete.  \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\n \nG.  \n \n11.  \nThe expected EIRR of the four subcomponents with flood-reduction benefits (Table A14.2) \nranges from 15.1% for the North He Xi District river improvement subcomponent, to 28.2% for the \nCity East Upper Qinhuai River improvement subcomponent. The EIRR of the six subcomponents \nwith  health  cost-reduction  benefits  ranges  from  15.1%  for  the  City  East  new  sewer  pipelines \nsubcomponent  to  16.5%  for  the  Inner  Qinhuai  sewer  interceptors subcomponent  (Table  A14.3). \nThe  EIRR  of  the  two  subcomponents  with  wastewater  and  sludge  treatment  are  16.3%  for  the \nnew  City  East  100,000  m3  per  day  WWTP  and  16.7%  for  the  Jiang  Xin  Zhou  sludge  treatment \nplant (Table A14.4). The EIRR for the whole Project, including all 10 subcomponents or activities, \nis 21.6%; the Project\u2019s economic net present value discounted at 12% is CNY855.6 million. The \nsensitivity  analysis  shows  that  increasing  capital  investment  costs  by  15%,  or  increasing \noperation and maintenance costs by 20%, or delaying total benefits by 1 year will not result in an \nEIRR lower than the cutoff rate of 12%. Thus, the results of the economic analysis are robust and \nthe Project is economically viable.   \n\n \nTable A14. 2.
