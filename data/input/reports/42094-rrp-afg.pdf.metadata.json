Each  project  will  have  individual  safeguard \ndocuments. Tranche 1 was subject to standard environmental due \ndiligence  and  classified  as  category  B.  Initial  environmental \nexaminations  of  tranche  1  projects  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendixes H, I, J, and K. \n   \nSector Program  The Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS), launched \nDescription   by the Government in April 2008, is the country\u2019s strategic platform \n  for development during 2008\u20132020. Its aim is to promote growth, \ngenerate  wealth,  and  reduce  poverty  and  vulnerability.  ANDS \ncovers  all  key  sectors  and  subsectors,  and  embraces  several \nthemes.  One  of  the  main  sectors  is  energy.  ANDS  establishes \nquantitative and qualitative (physical and nonphysical) targets, and \ncovers generation, transmission, and distribution. Within the sector, \nANDS covers investments in new and existing assets, including \ntheir  management,  maintenance,  and  repair.  The  underlying \nobjective  is  to  provide  reliable  and  cost-effective  electricity  to \nindustry and people. The proposed MFF finances a medium-term \nslice of a broader Investment Program. It is also consistent with \nADB\u2019s strategy for the country articulated in the Country Strategy \nand  Program  Update  (CSPU)  2006-2008,  and  the  Country \nPartnership Strategy (CPS) 2009-2013 currently under preparation \nwhich will be considered early in 2009. The CPS calls on ADB to \nprovide financing and advice for infrastructure (roads and railways), \npower and energy, and irrigation. The Government also wants ADB \nto set aside money every year for private sector development and \ntransactions. The ADB strategy responds to what the Government \nneeds, and focuses in areas where ADB has skills, knowledge and \ninformation, as well as a reasonable record of success. The CPS \nsupports  work  on  institutional  effectiveness,  particularly  those  in \ncharge of priority sectors. These interventions include (i) training for \nbetter planning and project management; (ii) gender mainstreaming; \n(iii)  financial  management,  anticorruption  policy  measures,  and \nfiduciary oversight; (iv) private sector development; (v) safeguard \nmanagement; and (vi) regional cooperation. The CPS also calls on ", "ii   \nADB to approach financing more programmatically, and proposes in \nparticular the use of the MFF. \n \nThe  development  of  the  Investment  Program  is  based  on \nassessments  of  technical,  operational,  commercial,  legal, \nfinancial,  and  other  matters.  These  led  to  the  creation  of  a \nproblem  tree  analysis  (Appendix  2),  which  in  turn  led  to  the \nprojected  outcome  shown  in  the  design  and  monitoring \nframeworks (DMF) for the Investment Program as a whole and \ntranche 1. The DMFs are in Appendix 1. \n \nThe proposed MFF has two important features. First, it finances new \nassets.  Second,  the  Government  will  use  the  Afghanistan \nReconstruction Trust Fund to cofinance community services in areas \nwhere power and energy facilities are planned and are being built. \nThis benefits Government, people, contractors, and consultants. It \nwill also enhance awareness of the villagers on the localized benefits \nof the Program, thereby lowering security risks.  \n   \nMFF Modality  The MFF is proposed as the modality to extend ADB financing to \nthe  Investment  Program.  The  following  seven  points  clearly \ndemonstrates the justification of using the MFF modality:  \n \n(i)  It provides flexibility to the authorities and ADB. Within the \nproposed maximum financing of $570 million, ADB and the \nGovernment  can  modify  the  amount  and  timing  of \ncontributions under each tranche. \n(ii)  Financing is aligned with project-readiness filters. \n(iii)  The  MFF  allows  ADB  to  enter  into  a  medium-term \npartnership,  thereby  creating  a  stable  financing  plan.  It \nalso mixes physical investments with advisory services. \n(iv)  Individual contract packages are significant in size (albeit \nsmaller  than  with  stand-alone  projects)  and  limited  in \nnumber. This invalidates the use of a sector loan approach \nor stand-alone project modalities as alternatives.  \n(v)  A program loan would help improve policies but not capital \ninvestments,  which  are  a  binding  constraint.  An  MFF \nallows ADB, the Government, and other parties to shift \ntime and resources away from repetitive processing tasks \ninto implementation work.  \n(vi)  Subsequent tranches are reasonably well defined, including \nthe nature, characteristics, location, and investment plan. \n(vii)  All the conditions precedent for the use of an MFF are in \nplace: a strategic framework, a policy framework (with the \noperating  principles  and  undertakings),  an  investment \nprogram, and a tentative financing plan.  \n   \nRationale  The energy sector faces tremendous physical and nonphysical \nchallenges, including limited supplies (low generation capacity), \nmounting  transmission  and  distribution  system  gaps,  rising \ntechnical losses, poor rural energy and electrification coverage, ", "  iii\nand inadequate gas and hydropower resources units. The sector \nalso faces legal and regulatory shortcomings, as well as gaps in \nfinancial and management operations [especially of the executing \nagency,  Afghanistan  Electricity  Corporation  (DABS)],  poor \nfinancial  management,  high  commercial  losses,  and  ineffective \nand inefficient planning and project execution. \n \nThe Government has requested ADB financial assistance over 5\u2013\n6 years. This assistance is to be channeled through the MFF, \nwhich will be converted into tranches linked to the readiness of \nindividual projects. This approach is also followed for the other \nstrategic sectors under the CPS: transport and irrigation. \n   \nInvestment Program  An investment program has been prepared for the sector. The \nphysical  and  nonphysical  outputs  will  lead  to  a  more  reliable \npower  system.  Physical  outputs  include  (i)  rehabilitation, \naugmentation, and expansion of the North East Power System \n(NEPS); (ii) development of distribution systems for load centers \nsupplied from NEPS; (iii) increased domestic generation capacity \nthrough new off-grid greenfield small and mini hydropower plants; \nand (iv) rehabilitation of gas fields. Off-grid rural electrification is \nbased on renewable hydropower. \n \nNonphysical outputs include (i) training for better system operation \nand maintenance; (ii) better planning, project management, and \nsystems, including the introduction of a management information \nsystem;  (iii)  metering,  billing,  and  collection  of  tariffs;  and  (iv) \nthematic coverage, including gender mainstreaming and private \nsector  development.  The  Investment  Program  will  set  up \nmechanisms of teams for monitoring and evaluation, reporting, \nand measuring results. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Investment Program will lead to a more reliable and cost-\neffective power supply for industry and people, leading to faster \nand  sustainable  economic  development.  The  outcome  will  be \nmore reliable generation, transmission, and distribution networks, \nand financial sustainability of DABS.  \n   \nFinancing Plan   Long-term  investments  are  estimated  at  $4  billion.  In  the \nimmediate term (2008\u20132012), the priority investments are about \n$2.3 billion. Of this, the Government asked ADB to finance up to \n$570 million. \n \nPriority Investment Financing Plan \nAmount \nInvestment Program  ($ million)  % \nAsian Development Bank  570  24.4 \nOther Sources  1,762  75.6 \n   Total    2,332  100.0 \nSources:  Asian  Development  Bank  and  Afghanistan  Electricity  Corporation \nestimates. \n ", "iv   \nADB will provide MFF of up to the equivalent to $570 million from \nthe Asian Development Fund (ADF). The Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction (JFPR) will cofinance some off-grid activities equivalent \nto $12 million. The rest of the financing plan will be distributed \namong  other  development  partners,  including  the  World  Bank, \nIslamic  Development  Bank,  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency,  European  Union,  and  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational Development.

All proceeds, \nTerms  except those to be used by the Ministry of Mines (MOM), will be \nonlent to DABS with a 32-year tenor including an 8-year grace \nperiod, at 1% a year interest during the grace period and 1.5% a \nyear  thereafter.  This  creates  a  revolving  pool  of  funds  to  help \nfinance other activities in the sector. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2017 \n   \nEstimated Investment  31 December 2016 \nProgram Completion Date \n   \nExecuting Agencies  DABS will be the Executing Agency (EA) for all projects except for \nthe Sheberghan Gas Fields Rehabilitation Project for which  MOM \nwill be the EA. \n   \nImplementation  A program management office (PMO) will be established in DABS \nArrangements  to manage project execution. It will also perform due diligence on \nnew  transactions  (to  be  financed  under  subsequent  tranches). \nMOM will second staff to the PMO to help with the implementation ", "  v\nof  the  Sheberghan  Gas  Fields  Rehabilitation  Project.  This \napproach will eliminate the duplication of work by the EAs. \n \nThe  EAs  have  limited  capacity.  A  team  of  advisors  will  be \nrecruited  to  work  in  the  PMO  to  provide  project  management \nexpertise and training. To ensure EA ownership, and to realize all \noperations  efficiently,  the  PMO  will  be  structured  into  teams, \nheaded by a director with experience in project management. The \ndirector will report to the chief executive officer in DABS and a \nminister of MOM. ADB will have direct access to the PMO for \nbusiness  matters  and  to  MOM  and  DABS  for  policy  matters. \nTranche 1 has earmarked $3 million to cover the costs of the \nPMO. \n \nAn implementation plan has been prepared together with a facility \nadministration manual. These provide a list of key tasks and a \nforecast  for  contract  awards  and  disbursements.  The \nimplementation  plan  defines  reporting  requirements  and \ndeadlines. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of works and goods to be financed under the MFF \nwill  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). International \ncompetitive bidding will be used for supply contracts estimated to \ncost more than $500,000 and for works of more than $2 million. \nNational competitive bidding will be used for goods and works \nvalued  at  more  than  $100,000  and  below  the  thresholds  for \ninternational competitive bidding. Shopping will be used for goods \nand works equal to or below $100,000. \n \nLimited international bidding may be needed for the Sheberghan \nGas  Fields  Rehabilitation  Project.  While  this  is  not  an  ideal \nprocurement approach, attracting competent contractors for this \ntype  of  project  has  been  difficult  in  the  past.  Project \nimplementation has been delayed for several years.  \n \nFor  each  ADF-financed  project,  advance  contracting  for  the \nprocurement of equipment, civil works, consulting services, and \nother  expenditures  will  be  permitted,  subject  to  these  being \neligible  according  to  agreed  upon  procedures,  and  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nRetroactive  financing  is  proposed  under  individual  tranches  for \nexpenditures  incurred  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the \ncorresponding financing agreement, with a ceiling of up to 20% of \nthe tranche amount. The Government, MOM, and DABS have been \ninformed  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive \nfinancing does not commit ADB to financing any of the proposed \nprojects. \n   \n ", "vi   \nConsulting Services  The PMO will require consulting services. Firms and individuals \n(national and international) will be engaged to provide advisory \nservices in the following areas: (i) project management; (ii) due \ndiligence work (technical, commercial, financial, legal, safeguards, \ngender, governance, etc.) for subsequent tranches; (iii) detailed \ndesign engineering, procurement, and supervision; (iv) safeguard \nmanagement  and  gender  mainstreaming;  (v)  evaluation, \nmonitoring, auditing, reporting, and measuring results; and (vi) \ntraining  and  policy  advice.  Consultants  will  be  selected  and \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants using the quality-based selection method.  \n \nSingle-source selection may be used to recruit a consultant to \nhelp with the Sheberghan Gas Fields Rehabilitation Project. The \nleast-cost  selection  method  will  be  used  to  recruit  external \nauditors and external agencies to monitor the implementation of \nsafeguards.  Individual  consultants  may  be  recruited  for  other \nassignments, in accordance with ADB procedures for recruitment \nof individual consultants.  \n   \nInvestment Program  The  Investment  Program  will  benefit  people  and  businesses. \nBenefits and  Benefits  are  derived  from  the  provision  of  less-expensive  and \nBeneficiaries  more reliable electricity to a greater number of people for most of \nthe year. Energy will improve welfare and accelerate economic \ngrowth. The Investment Program will also have gender-related \nbenefits,  particularly  as  household  tasks  become  less  labor \nintensive and job opportunities grow. Household will benefit by \nreducing the use of expensive diesel-generated electricity. The \nInvestment Program will have minimal impact on the environment. \nIn addition to initiating environmental due diligence the Investment \nProgram will take a broader view on climate change, particularly in \nthe  context  of  energy  conservation,  clean  energy,  renewable \nenergy, and system efficiency. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  key  assumptions  for  success  of  the  Investment  Program \ninclude (i) timely implementation of projects, (ii) more effective \ninstitutions,  (iii)  a  commitment  to  reforms  and  the  policy \nframework, (iv) stable regulation arrangements and tariff regime, \nand (v) improvement in security. \n \nOne  of  the  main  risks  to  the  Investment  Program  is  that  the \nrestructuring  of  DABS  could  be  delayed  or  not  be  completed. \nOther risks include insufficient power imports from neighboring \ncountries and inadequate project management.  \n \nThe modernization of DABS is on course, although the process \nwill  require  a  major  political  commitment  and  working  capital \nfinancing in the short term. Considerable technical assistance is \nbeing assigned to this task from ADB and other agencies such as \nthe  World  Bank.  Electricity  supplies  from  Uzbekistan  are  not \nformally  confirmed,  although  both  parties  have  been  talking ", "  vii\nrecently.  Supplies  from  Tajikistan  are  scheduled  to  come  on \nstream in 2010, but will only be available between May to August. \nElectricity supplies from Turkmenistan have not been formalized, \nand the gas project to supply Pakistan and India is only on the \ndrawing board. The Central Asia-South Asia Regional Electricity \nMarket  Project  is  in  the  planning  stage.  This  suggests  that  a \ndomestic  supply  is  needed  to  achieve  energy  security.  Kabul \nreceives only 2\u20133 hours of electricity a day.  \n \nProject management has been a problem in the past. Capacity is \nlacking, and the systems and procedures are inefficient and slow. \nThe establishment of the PMO breaks with past practice, taking a \nholistic view of the management of project tasks and themes.  \n \nSecurity is likely to remain the most difficult problem in the short to \nmedium term. This will make it difficult to attract investors and \ncontractors,  and  to  implement  projects.  The  MFF  establishes \ncommunity-based,  small-scale  investments  and  contingency \nfinance to pay for security. This will not address the core cause of \nthe problem, but it might reduce the risk to contractors. \n \n \n ", "64o  00'E 72o  00'E 72 o 00'E\nTAJIKISTAN\nUZBEKISTAN\nBADAKHSHAN\nTURKMENISTAN JOWZJAN KUNDUZTAKHAR AFGHANISTAN\nBALKH\n36 o 00'N BAGHLAN 36 o 00'N ENERGY SECTOR DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT PROGRAM\nFARYAB SAMANGANPANJSHIR\nSAR-E-PUL NURISTAN\nI R A N BADGHIS BAMYANPARWKAANPISALAGHMAKNONAR\nHERAT AFGGHHOAWNRISTAN WAKRADBALUKOLGARKANBAUNLGARHAR\nDAIKONDI PAKTIA\nGHAZNI KHOST N\nORUZGAN\n32 o 00'N FARAH ZABOL PAKTIKA PAKISTAN 32 o 00'N TAJIKISTAN\nNIMRUZ KANDAHAR\n0 30 60 90 120\nHELMAND\nUZBEKISTAN Kilometers\n64o  00'E 72o  00'E\n66 o 00'E\nBADAKHSHAN\nTURKMENISTAN\nKeleft Faizabad\nJOWZJAN Hairatan KUNDUZ Baharak Small Hydropower Plant\nTAKHAR and Mini-Grid (Tranche 1)\nBalkh NEPS Distribution Network\nAndkhoi Kunduz (Tranche 1) Lower Kokcha Hydropower\nSheberghan Mazar-e-Sharif Kholm Kunduz (TTaralnocqheasn 3 and 4) Eshkashem\nSheberghan Gas Fields NEPS 220 kV Transmission Line\nRehabilitation (Tranche 1) Kunduz--Taloqan (Tranche1)\n36 o 00'N BALKH Baghlan NEPS Distribution Network 36 o 00'N\nSar-e-Pul Samangan Baghlan (Tranche 1)\nPul-e-Khumri Project Province for Japan Fund for\nSAMANGAN Poverty Reduction--Financed\nMaimana BAGHLAN Component (Tranche 1)\nGas Field Rehabilitation - MFF Project\nFARYAB Doshi PANJSHIR NURISTAN\nNational Capital\nSAR-E-PUL NEPS 220 kV Transmission Line\nPul-e-Khumri--Chimtala (Kabul) Kamdish Provincial Capital\nReplication (Tranche 2) City/Town\nBADGHIS BAMYAN Charikar Mahmood-e-Raqi KONAR Hydropower Plant - MFF Project \nPARWAN KAPISA LAGHMAN Asadabad Distribution Network Rehabilitation - MFF Project\nBamyan Mehtar Lam 220 kV Substation - MFF Project\n220 kV Transmission Line - Existing\nChaghcharan NEPS 220 kV ChimRtaelap l(iKcaatbiounl)  (STurbanstcahteio 3n) KABUL 220 kV Transmission Line - MFF Project\nKABUL\nMaidanshahr Jalalabad 110 kV Transmission Line - Existing\n34 o 00'N WARDAK NANGARHAR River 34 o 00'N\nPul-e-Alam Torkham\nGHOR Khadir SoutheNrnE PESxt e2n20s ikoVn  T(Trraannscmhiesss i2o nan Ldin 3e) LOGAR Provincial Boundary\nInternational Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\nPAKTIA\nDAIKONDI\nGHAZNI PAKISTAN MFF = Multitranche Financing Facility\n08-4 Ghazni Gardez KHOST NPrEoPjeSc t=s  Nunodrtehr  Etraasntc Pheosw e2r,  3S,y asntedm 4 are indicative.\n4\n15 H 66 o 00'E Khost 72 o 00'E\nR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  proposed  (i) \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF), and (ii) administration of a grant from the Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction (JFPR), both to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Energy Sector \nDevelopment  Investment  Program  (the  Investment  Program).  The  design  and  monitoring \nframeworks (DMFs) are in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  Devastated by decades of conflict, Afghanistan has one of the lowest electrification \nratios and energy consumption rates in the world. An estimated 9% of the population has \naccess to intermittent public power, and per capita electricity consumption is as low as 21 \nkilowatt-hours (kWh) per year. Cities such as Kabul, the capital, get electricity only 2\u20133 hours a \nday. The shortage of electricity affects people in urban and rural areas alike. It is a binding \nconstraint on development.  \n \n3.  The Government wants to reverse the situation and has given top priority to the energy \nsector  in  its  midterm  development  program.  This  is  reflected  in  the  Afghanistan  National \nDevelopment  Strategy  (ANDS),1 which  was  approved  in  April  2008  and  submitted  to  the \ninternational community in Paris in mid-2008. The ANDS calls for investments in infrastructure \nin general, but particularly for energy security. Achieving energy security will require expanding \nand  improving  transmission  and  distribution  networks,  and  increasing  domestic  generation \ncapacity by using a mix of hydro and thermal power resources. This will not be straightforward, \nbecause (i) the power system is underdeveloped and the existing facilities are in a state of \ndisrepair (some facilities are well beyond their economic life), (ii) the private sector is too small \nand uninterested in backing such large investments, and (iii) foreign investors are deterred by \nthe deteriorating security situation. This places the responsibility mainly on a weak public sector. \nGenerating more power domestically will take time. An interim measure is to import electricity \nfrom neighboring countries. Both the importation of electricity and the development of domestic \ncapacity  will  require  the  expansion  and  improvement  of  the  transmission  and  distribution \nsystems.  \n \n4.  A flagship investment is already in place: the new 220-kilovolt (kV) North East Power \nSystem (NEPS) that connects Kabul, Pul-e-Khumri, Mazar-e-Sharif, Kunduz, and other load \ncenters of northern and eastern Afghanistan. This investment is vital for power imports from \nTajikistan and Uzbekistan (and later from Turkmenistan). The most important parts of the NEPS \nare being completed. A transmission line in Uzbekistan to connect to NEPS, scheduled to come \non stream in May 2009, will initially enable 150 MW of power to be supplied to Kabul and other \ncenters around NEPS.  \n \n5.  Afghanistan Electricity Corporation (DABS), established in March 2008, will be the major \nplayer in the industry. The former Afghanistan Electricity Organization (DABM), a department of \nthe Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW), is being transformed into a new company, DABS, with \nits own statutes, a business strategy and mandate, and an independent management team. \nDABS is a vertically integrated national power utility that will own and operate generation, \n                                                 \n1 Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. 2008. Afghanistan National Development Strategy. Kabul. ", "2     \ntransmission,  distribution  facilities,  and  the  load  dispatch.2 Given  the  market  conditions  in \nAfghanistan, the probability of the company remaining vertically integrated is high. Since nearly \n80% of energy consumption in Afghanistan is in the form of electricity, this transformation\u2014and \nlater the introduction of better operating practices at DABS\u2014represents an essential first step \ntoward improving the organization of the sector. The outcome must reduce, and eventually \neliminate, a binding constraint to economic growth in Afghanistan by producing, transmitting, \nand distributing more electricity for more hours each day to more people and businesses in a \ncost-effective and efficient manner. However, even after the transformation of DABS into a \ncompany, the tasks ahead are difficult due to the complex issues that need to be resolved. \n \n6.  The main challenges are to put in place a professional and experienced management \nteam, enough working capital and development financing, tighter governance systems, and a \nsound tariff regime to support operations. DABS will need to spin off some of its activities inherited \nfrom DABM, refocus its strategy and business plan on priority areas, and develop partnerships with \nlocal and international entities. Energy security will be a function of how well DABS addresses \nthose issues. DABS will need enormous support over the short to medium term.  \n \n7.  The country has natural gas, coal, and hydropower potential. Gas and coal resources \nhave been identified mostly in central and northern Afghanistan. However, the lack of long-term \nfunding to rehabilitate dilapidated infrastructure, or to investigate and develop reserves, limits \ntheir viability. Exploration of indigenous resources and development of hydropower potential will \nstrengthen domestic generation and improve energy security. In the meantime, the country will \nhave to rely on imported power and fuels. The recent international price increases for both were \nhuge shocks for an already shaky economy and emphasized the importance of energy security.  \n \n8.  The Investment Program is driven by the country\u2019s strategic directions for the sector and \nby a policy framework calling for greater operational and institutional efficiency, cost recovery, \ncompetition, transparency, and good governance. The strategy is clear. The policy framework \nneeds some refinements, especially regarding the tariff regime, aspects of the legal framework, \ndivestment, and the energy mix. This work will require major assistance. These shortcomings \nmust not stop the development of strategic investments. The investment plan includes short-, \nmedium-, and long-term investments, and blends physical with nonphysical interventions. As \nsuch, the timing of the ADB assistance makes sense.  \n \nB.   Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Challenges \n9.  The energy sector faces tremendous challenges which can be found in the detailed \nproblem tree analysis, which is in Appendix 2.  \n \na.  Physical Challenges \n10.  Low Generation Capacity. The total generation capacity in Afghanistan is only 625 \nmegawatts (MW). Actual load is assessed to be much less (about 400 MW), including 167 MW \nof imported power. Hydropower accounts for 40% of the total capacity. However, because of \ndroughts  and  reduced  river  flows,  the  country  has  resorted  to  more  expensive  and \n                                                 \n2 The Afghanistan Electricity Organization (DABM), a department of the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW), \ncurrently owns and operates the electricity assets of the country. Transfer of assets from DABM to Afghanistan \nElectricity Corporation (DABS) is expected to be completed by March 2009. ", "      3\nenvironmentally-less-friendly  options,  including  diesel  and  oil-fired  generation.  To  replace \nexpensive  diesel  and  oil  power,  the  two-pronged  strategic  plan  was  adopted:  importing \nelectricity from neighboring countries and developing domestic generation capacity. Afghanistan \nhas an estimated 23,000 MW of potential hydropower resources, as well as gas and coal \nreserves.  Major  impediments  to  tapping  such  resources  include  the  limited  financial  and \nbusiness capacity of the private sector, and the limited interest of the international investors. \nTherefore, the public sector will need to take initiative to implement such investments. The role \nof international financing is crucial in this regard.  \n \n11.  Underdeveloped and Inefficient Transmission System. The transmission system is \nunderdeveloped; only major load centers are serviced. NEPS was intended to fix this problem. \nSince 2003, the aid community has committed $1 billion for such investments. While significant \nprogress was made, DABS is short on capacity and cash to maintain NEPS. An outside service \nprovider will be needed to handle project management and maintenance, as well as training of \nDABS staff to do the job. The system also needs to be expanded in the southern and western \nparts of the country where coverage is limited.  \n \n12.  Underdeveloped and Poorly Managed Distribution System. The Government and \nthe development community has funded major rehabilitation and expansion works directed at \nthe distribution networks linked to NEPS, but much of the work remains to be done. The \ndistribution networks in areas outside NEPS need to be expanded and rehabilitated. Many \nfacilities were destroyed during the conflict; others have exhausted their economic life. This \nleads to system inefficiencies, including high technical losses and poor customer service in \nterms of coverage, quality, and consistency.  \n \n13.  High Losses. Total losses including technical losses are estimated at 30% of generated \nelectricity. A 10% loss is probably acceptable under the conditions in Afghanistan, but the \nbalance translates into $30 million a year in financial losses.3 This is too high for a country with \nfinancial problems and limited electricity coverage. Unless the situation is addressed, it will put \nDABS\u2019s financial sustainability at risk. It will undermine its ability to service consumers and \nmake future investments. The alternative is rising subsidies and a deteriorating fiscal situation. \nThe budget is already stressed because of declining tax revenues.  \n \n14.  Limited Rural Energy and Geographical Electrification Coverage. Many parts of the \ncountry do not have any electricity service coverage. Where there is coverage, the systems are \npoorly maintained. The multi aid agency-funded National Solidarity Program (NSP), managed \nby  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Rehabilitation  and  Development,  is  a  flagship  initiative  on  rural \nelectrification. The NSP supports electrification schemes with installed capacity typically below \n25 kilowatts (kW). Although this fills only a small part of the energy gap in these areas, it is a \ngood  initiative.  Larger  schemes  are  planned,  but  most  have  not  come  on  stream.  The \nRenewable Energy and Rural Electrification Subcommittee was established under the Inter-\nMinisterial Commission for Energy (ICE) in September 2008 to address this issue. ADB is \nproviding technical assistance. Service coverage in rural areas is important because that is \nwhere the bulk of the population lives.  \n \n15.  Untapped Natural Gas Reserves. Afghanistan has natural gas resources, but the physical \ninfrastructure supporting their development has been destroyed or is dilapidated. The Government \nis considering rehabilitating domestic gas wells, which would improve the gas supply to consumers, \n                                                 \n3  Based on 20% of a total of 1,162.3 gigawatt-hours of power in 2005, or 232.5 megawatt-hours at $0.12 per kWh. \nSource: Ministry of Energy and Water. Forthcoming. MEW Power Sector Strategy. Kabul. \n ", "4     \nand provide potential fuel for development of new generation capacity to supply NEPS. The \nMinistry  of  Mines  (MOM)  has  sought  external  assistance  to  rehabilitate  gas  fields  for  the \ndevelopment of gas-fired power plants. However, MOM has had limited success, largely because it \nhas been difficult to find interested investors and contractors. Plans are under way to develop a \nnumber of fields. In the longer run, gas is an interesting alternative in the energy mix.  \n \n16.  Untapped Coal Reserves. The production rates for the coal industry are very low owing to \nyears of neglect. Until the end of 2006, the development of coal resources was restricted primarily \nto two state-owned enterprises, with oversight by MOM. Some lease arrangements with private \noperators have been put in place since then. In May 2007, the Government also established the \nCoal Commission, which is responsible primarily for looking into industrial demand and instruments \nwith coal as a fuel source. However, no programmatic assistance has been provided to the coal \nsector. This area needs attention, albeit through investments using clean coal technology.  \n \nb.   Nonphysical Challenges  \n17.  Weak Legal and Regulatory Framework. Many institutions are engaged in different \nparts  of  the  energy  sector,  which  has  made  coordination  difficult.  Legal  and  regulatory \nframeworks  are  in  place.  However,  the  institutions  behind  them  are  weak  and  at  times \ndisconnected from DABS, the company producing, transporting, and distributing electricity. This \nhas resulted in a weak energy industry that is technically deficient in planning and design. The \nbusiness environment is also unsound. The tariff regime is unpredictable, making cost recovery \nproblematic. To resolve these issues, a multisector regulatory body was established early in \n2008, with a mandate to improve policy coordination and information. DABS needs assistance \non systems and procedures operations, as well as project management.  \n \n18.  Corporatization of DABS and Commercialization of the Energy Sector.  In 2008, the \nCabinet  approved  the  reorganization  of  DABM  into  a  Government-owned  company  (DABS) \nmandated to operate under the Commercial Code and other laws applicable to private entities. The \nGovernment backed this with a divestment strategy, due to begin in 2009, for the liquidation, \nrestructuring, commercialization, and sale of energy assets under state control. The corporatization \nof DABM into DABS is a positive step, but more work is needed to see that it succeeds. High levels \nof assistance are necessary.  \n \n19.  Bad Financial Performance of DABS. The Government doubled electricity tariffs in \n2006.4 This  has  to  a  certain  extent  defrayed  diesel  costs  and  will  help  DABS  financially. \nHowever, the tariff regime was inadequate to start with, and DABS is expected to carry a heavy \nfinancial burden in the short to medium term. Capital injections and further increases in real \ntariffs will be required to ensure cost recovery.5 DABS also needs to become more effective, cut \ncosts, improve billing and tariff collection, and urgently reduce huge technical and commercial \nlosses compared to DABM\u2019s past performance. \n  \n20.  Commercial Losses and Low Collection Rate. Commercial losses in the system are \ncaused mainly by theft, and unbilled energy while collection rates are low. It is estimated that \nonly 60% of billings are collected. These problems translate to a financial loss of approximately \n$45 million a year. If this is combined with total losses of $30 million per year (para. 13), the \nfinancial sustainability of DABS is in doubt. In addition to investments in the system, better \nbusiness and management practices are needed.  \n                                                 \n4 From an average of $0.0416/kWh to $0.0830/kWh \n5 ADB estimates that the final average tariff to consumers after 2009 will be $0.12\u2013$0.14 per kWh.  ", "      5\n \n21.  Lack of Qualified Staff. Low salaries and the loss of experts during the conflict have left \nthe  industry  without  enough  experienced  professionals  with  the  right  operational,  financial \nmanagement, and technical skills. Current salaries of engineers at DABM are less than 10% of \nmarket rates in the country, which inhibits DABS in hiring and retaining staff. High staff turnover \nmakes capacity development a challenge. The situation is unlikely to change in the short to \nmedium term, which implies a higher-than-average level of support during the implementation of \nprojects and for longer periods than would otherwise be the case.  \n \n22.  Tighter Aid Agency Coordination. The energy sector is currently overseen by an array \nof ministries, agencies and government organizations. This resulted in inefficient allocation of \nforeign assistance leading to gaps and overlaps in the development of the sector. ICE was, \ntherefore, established to function as a centralized coordination body.6 Chaired by the Minister of \nEconomy, the ICE includes MEW, MOM, and the Ministry of Finance as core members. The ICE \naims to help the Government design and monitor energy development strategies based on \ncommercial  principles.  It  oversees  energy  sector  policy  and  infrastructure  investment \nprogramming, and coordinates the work of development partners. \n \n2.  Energy Sector Strategy \n23.  The Afghanistan energy sector strategy is a by-product of ANDS and was formulated \nbased  on  assessments  done  in  recent  years.  The  strategy  highlights  key  problems  and \nopportunities, and recognizes the challenges ahead. It proposes a vision for the future and actions \nto  deliver  larger  and  more  reliable  supplies,  better  and  larger  transmission  and  distribution \nnetworks, and more efficient institutions, by developing new legal and regulatory frameworks, and \nadditional finance. The strategy outlines quantitative and qualitative targets and focuses on four \nareas: (i) development of new operations and running of existing ones efficiently, (ii) improvements \nin governance, (iii) expansion of rural electrification and development of renewable energy, and (iv) \ndevelopment of effective institutions. The energy sector strategy is summarized in Appendix 3. \n \n3.  Targets \n24.  The objective of the strategy is to get close to, or surpass, the following benchmarks \nprojected under the Afghanistan Compact7 by 2010: (i) electricity to reach at least 65% of \nhouseholds  in  major  urban  areas,  (ii)  electricity  to  reach  at  least  90%  of  non-residential \nestablishments in major urban areas, (iii) at least 25% of rural households to have access to \nelectricity, and (iv) at least 75% cost recovery from national power grid.  \n \n4.  Energy Sector Investment Program \n25.  The Government produced a development master plan in 2004, which is outdated and \nhas been revised. A new energy sector investment program has been developed, which has \nidentified projects; several projects have been assigned to different development partners. This \nwork has been managed through the ICE. The current Investment Program will cost more than \n$4 billion up to 2015 while the shorter-term Investment Program will cost approximately $2.3 \nbillion. ADB has been asked to finance a slice of the Investment Program. The financing plan \nremains tentative, although aid agencies such as the World Bank are committed to specific \ntransactions. ADB will take a programmatic approach to financing by using an MFF.   \n                                                 \n6 ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to Afghanistan for Support to the Inter-Ministerial Commission for Energy. Manila. \n7 The London Conference on Afghanistan. 2006. The Afghanistan Compact. London. \n ", "6     \n5.  External Assistance  \n26.  The  NEPS  has  been  the  focus  of  external  assistance  in  the  energy  sector.  Major \ndevelopment partners include ADB, India, German development cooperation through KfW, United \nStates Agency for International Development (USAID), and World Bank (Appendix 4). An account \nof past performance is not possible as few projects have been evaluated. This also applies to ADB. \nThrough development agencies\u2019 discussions prevalent in the ICE meetings and joint portfolio \nreviews by different aid agencies which have commenced in the past, it has been clarified that the \nportfolios have several common characteristics in strategy and lessons learned (paras. 27\u201331).  \n \n6.  ADB Operations and Sector Strategy  \n27.  The Country Strategy and Program Update (CSPU) 2006-2008 for Afghanistan places \nenergy sector development as one of its top priorities. Transport, which accounts for the bulk of \nthe current portfolio, will remain a priority ADB operations governed by the CSPU under which \nADB provided financial and advisory assistance to transport, energy, and agriculture.8 The \nrehabilitation of power infrastructure, particularly transmission and distribution lines, and the \nestablishment of a national power transmission grid were priorities in the energy sector. The \nADB program also focused on facilitation of power trading and interconnection with neighboring \ncountries.  Similarly,  ADB  has  supported  the  development  of  hydropower  and  natural  gas \nthrough technical assistance. \n \n28.  The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Afghanistan (2009-2013), which will be \nconsidered  early  in  2009,  makes  energy  the  top  priority.  The  new  strategy  for  the  sector \nrepresents a  continuation  of  the format.  The  objective  remains  broadly  the  same,  but  the \nbusiness model is different. Investments and institutions are supported in a more programmatic \nfashion through the combination of physical and nonphysical investments. The new strategy \nattaches  special  importance  to  themes,  particularly  gender  and  development  for  gender \nmainstreaming, capacity, governance, and private sector development. The strategy is also \naligned with a regional cooperation and integration plan. ADB has three flagship projects in this \narea, one approved and two in development. The ADB strategy is in line with the ANDS and is \nsupported by the Government.  \n \n7.  Lessons  \n29.  ADB has several ongoing projects. None has yet been evaluated independently by the \nOperations Evaluation Department. Nevertheless, based on internal portfolio reviews and project \nperformance reports prepared by country and sector teams, several lessons can be highlighted: \n \n(i)  Most projects have been prone to cost overruns and are far behind schedule. This \nis  a  function  of  bad  security  and  rising  investment  costs  (because  of  higher \ninternational materials and equipment prices, and a rising security cost premium). \nHowever, some projects would have benefited from better planning and design, as \nwell as more realistic cost estimates.  \n \n(ii)  Most transactions failed to attract the interest of top contractors, largely because of \nthe security situation. This has led to higher-than-expected bid prices, resulting in \nfinancing gaps. However, more and better marketing of the business opportunities \nmight have helped. \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008): Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Manila. ", "      7\n \n(iii)  The use of design-build approaches has merits, but when only one contractor is \nbidding it also has risks. This has led to changes in project scope, sometimes with \ndubious  justification.  The  Government  often  responded  positively  to  change \nrequests, leading to financial commitments that it was not able to always meet. This \nwas also prevalent in transport projects. The inability to make good on commitments \nhas put contracts at risk, and ADB has often been asked to come to the rescue.  \n \n(iv)  ADF  is  the  only  means  ADB  has  to  do  business  in  Afghanistan.  The  current \nallocation arrangements, which require funds to be pledged to projects within a given \nfiscal  year,  may  have  contributed  to  two  problems:  (a)  larger-than-needed \ntransactions, and (b) the delinking of financing plans from project readiness. This has \nresulted in cost overruns and ultimately the restructuring of projects and financings. \nThe ADF allocation system does not need to be changed because of this; the \nreliance on stand-alone projects does. Specifically, a programmatic approach for all \npriority activities under the CPS might be a better way to deal with this problem.  \n \n(v)  The approval of investment projects without proper power purchase agreements \n(PPAs)  up  front  is  a  bad  practice.  This  is  the  situation  with  the  power \ninterconnection with Uzbekistan. Although the situation is being managed, the \nmain  lesson  is  not  to  start  regional  projects  without  formal  commercial \nagreements in place.  \n \n30.  Another lesson is that projects must have better and more detailed implementation \nplans, as well as project implementation manuals up front. As the institutional capacity in the \ncountry is weak, local teams cannot be expected to start things from scratch. This leads to \nstartup delays. In addition, sound organizational arrangements are lacking at the level of the \nexecuting agencies (EAs). A more holistic project management approach ought to replace the \nstandard project management unit concept. The standard approach works for some projects, \nbut the institutional memory disappears once these are completed. The combination of project \nmanagement with the execution of institutional reforms linked to the sector and the projects \nmakes more sense. This is especially important in financing channeled through MFFs. With \nregard to ADB oversight, recent experience has shown that the resident mission in Kabul and \nthe teams at headquarters need to work more closely together from the outset. The concept of \n\u201cdelegated\u201d and \u201cnon-delegated\u201d projects does not work well if this disconnects technical and \nadministrative  tasks,  responsibilities,  and  accountabilities.  A  joint  venture  approach  might \novercome this problem.  \n \n31.  The capacity of the resident mission has also been a problem. The office has dedicated \nprofessionals, but it needs more experienced project management expertise, and more efficient \nsystems and procedures, including project administration oversight and reporting. The skills mix \ndeficiency is being corrected through the redeployment of new experts to the field, and through \nnew leadership. A detailed action plan to correct other weaknesses has been defined and will \nbe implemented in full shortly.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n32.  The expected impact of the Investment Program will be a larger and more cost-effective \npower supply to all customers, resulting in sustainable economic development. The outcome of \n ", "8     \nthe Investment Program will be (i) reliable generation, transmission, and distribution networks; \n(ii)  financial  sustainability  of  DABS;  and  (iii)  better  power  sector  regulation  and  overall \ninstitutional effectiveness.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n1.  General \n33.  The Investment Program will create a more reliable power system. This will be a function \nof  (i)  the  rehabilitation,  augmentation,  and  expansion  of  the  NEPS;  (ii)  development  of \ndistribution systems at load centers supplied from the NEPS; and (iii) more domestic generation \ncapacity through on- and off-grid small and mini greenfield hydropower plants, and rehabilitation \nof gas fields. Off-grid rural electrification programs will rely on the development of renewable \nhydropower, providing rural population access to electricity. \n \n34.  Other outputs of the Investment Program will include (i) better system operation and \nmaintenance; and (ii) enhanced planning and project management, including the introduction of \nmanagement information system (MIS) and better metering, billing, and collection of tariffs. \nDABS will be a target for assistance. A PMO will be established to undertake (i) technical work \n(design and supervision); (ii) provide legal services (contracts and bidding processes); (iii) \nsafeguard management and gender mainstreaming; (iv) finance and administration (to tighten \nup on systems, procedures, funding, audits, controls, records, and cash management); (v) \nreporting, evaluations, and results measurement; and (vi) technical assistance to train staff on \nproject management, planning, policy refinements, and investment program development. The \nPMO will also have due diligence experts to prepare the next generation of priority investments. \nThe  office  will  also  have  a  communications  function.  The  intention  is  to  work  on  broad \ninstitutional matters, while addressing day-to-day operational and project execution.  \n \n2.  Program Outputs \n35.  Tranche 1. Physical outputs will include (i) rehabilitating distribution systems in the northern \ncities of Kunduz and Baghlan, (ii) constructing a new 220 kV transmission line from Kunduz to \nTaloqan, (iii) small and mini hydropower plants in Badakhshan and Bamyan Provinces, and (iv) \nrehabilitating gas fields in Sheberghan. Nonphysical outputs will include (i) the establishment and \noptimal functioning of the PMO, (ii) development of a management information system to efficiently \nmanage the Program, and (iii) capacity building and training for effective management, operation \nand  maintenance  of  NEPS,  as  well  as  project  management  (procurement,  contract  awards, \nsupervision, and design work), due diligence for new projects, safeguard management, gender \nmainstreaming work for all tranches, finance and administration controls, and basic training. All \nadvisory packages will be supported by consulting services mandates. Details of physical and \nnonphysical outputs of the Tranche 1 Project are in Appendix 5. \n \n36.  Subsequent  Tranches.  Subsequent  tranches  will  build  on  the  results  of  tranche  1. \nIndicative  physical  outputs  will  include  rehabilitating  and  constructing  of  transmission  lines, \ndistribution systems, and new hydropower generation. The three additional tranches will expand \nNEPS to the south of Kabul where connection to the national grid is badly needed. Nonphysical \noutputs will include (i) development of a metering program in load centers covered by NEPS, (ii) \nintroduction and upgrading of DABS\u2019s billing system, (iii) development of an action plan to improve \ntariff collection, and (iv) institutional strengthening and capacity building of DABS with the objective \nof enabling the company to operate on a commercial basis. Descriptions of indicative projects to be \nfinanced under subsequent tranches are in Appendix 6. ", "      9\n \nC.  Multitranche Financing Facility Modality \n \n37.  The  MFF  is  proposed  as  the  modality  to  extend  ADB  financing  to  the  Investment \nProgram. The following seven points clearly demonstrates the justification of using the MFF \nmodality: \n \n(i)  The  modality  provides  flexibility  to  ADB  and  the  Government.  Within  the \nproposed maximum financing of $570 million, ADB and the Government can \nmodify the amount and timing of ADB contributions under each tranche. This is \nimportant  in  case  the  Government  can  raise  additional  financing  from  other \nsources (such as the private sector or other aid agencies), or if the Government \nneeds more time to finalize specific project packages. The other key element is \nthat the financing to be provided by ADB can be closely linked to the availability \nof  resources  within  ADB,  and  to  full  compliance  with  warranties  and \nrepresentations made under the framework financing agreement (FFA). \n \n(ii)  Financing under the MFF can be aligned to specific technical, safeguard, legal, \nand other project-readiness filters. The authorities can make loan conversions \nunder the MFF as and when projects are ready for execution. This approach \nfacilitates  advance  actions,  including  documentation  preparation,  and  the \nestablishment  of  relevant  administrative  arrangements.  The  MFF  also  allows \nADB, the Government, and its partners to link more closely financing to changes \nin the cost of projects bundled under each tranche. This avoids cost overruns. \n \n(iii)  The  MFF  allows  ADB  to  enter  into  a  medium-term  partnership  with  the \nGovernment and DABS, establishing stability and credibility at the level of the \nfinancing  plan.  The  MFF  mixes  physical  investments  with  advisory  services. \nAdvisory  services  include  financing  to  advance  work  on  capacity  and  policy \nactions, which can be precursors to making physical investments. \n \n(iv)  The  individual  contract  packages  are  smaller  than  stand-alone  operations, \nalthough they are still substantial, and limited in number. This invalidates a sector \nloan approach and stand-alone project modalities as alternatives. However, the \nstate  of  energy  facilities  is  poor,  impairing  energy  security  and  economic \nperformance. The efficiency gains would not be the same if any of these other \nmodalities were used. The MFF will also lower costs, although this is not the \nmain by-product. \n \n(v)  A program loan would help improve policies but not capital investments, which \nare  a  binding  constraint.  By  channeling  funding  through  an  MFF,  ADB,  the \nGovernment, and other parties can shift time and resources away from repetitive \nprocessing tasks into implementation work.  \n \n(vi)  Subsequent  tranches  are  reasonably  well  defined,  including  the  nature, \ncharacteristics, location, and investment plan. \n \n(vii)  All the conditions precedent for the use of an MFF are in place: strategy or road \nmap, policy framework, investment program, and financing plan. The modality \nalso moves the analytical work up front, leaving resources and multiple entry \npoints for ADB and its partners to focus on execution, capacity, and reforms. \n ", "10    \nADB and its partners have agreed upon decision-making criteria and filters for \nthe provision of financing, including specific warranties and representations and \ncovenants leading to suspension and cancellation of financing. \n \n38.  The status of MFF preconditions is as follows: \n \n(i)  Strategy. The strategic framework or road map is sound. The main components \nare provided with the expected results. \n \n(ii)  Policy framework. The policy framework is less solid than the strategy and will \nneed refinements. However, the main building blocks are in place. DABS and \nMOM need to ensure that the main principles are adhered to: cost recovery; \nrecurrent  expenditure  financing;  best  practice  approaches  on  safeguards, \ngovernance, financial management, procurement, and anticorruption measures; \nfurther  sector  restructuring;  introduction  of  a  firmer  tariff  regime;  and  better \nproject management and agency accountability. \n \n(iii)  Investment  Program.  The  Government  has  prepared  a  medium-  term \ninvestment  program  calling  for  investments  of  about  $4  billion.  Short-term \ninvestment priorities will cost about $2.3 billion. Both short and medium-term \ninvestment program are shown in Table 1. \n \n(iv)  Financing plan. The overall program of investments still lacks a firm financing plan, \nalthough the short-term package has firmer plans. ADB is one of the financiers, \ntogether with Japan (through JFPR), USAID, KfW, the European Union, India, Iran, \nIslamic  Development  Bank,  and  World  Bank.  If  financing  is  not  secured,  the \nInvestment Program will still continue but at a slower pace. The national budget and \nthe private sector are not serious financing options.  \n \nD.  Energy Sector Investment Program \n \n39.  Investment requirements in the energy sector for the medium term total about $4 billion. \nOf this, some $2.3 billion are the more pressing investments (Table 1). The Government has \nasked ADB to take a slice of this smaller program and to support it over 4\u20135 years through an \nMFF. The amount proposed is $570 million (Table 2). A set of investments have been prepared. \nThese are to be done in four tranches, with the first totaling $164 million (Table 3). Details of the \ncost estimates of this MFF and tranche 1 components are in Appendix 7.  \n \nTable 1: Medium-Term and Priority Energy Sector Investment Program \n($ million) \nMedium  Priority \n Item  Term  Investments\nInstitutional  97  93 \nGeneration  1,993  756 \nTransmission  1,386  960 \nDistribution  717  523 \nTotal  4,195  2,332 \nSource: Afghanistan Electricity Corporation estimates.

Financing Plan and Conditions \n40.  The Government has asked ADB to finance up to the equivalent of $570 million to help \nfinance the Investment Program. Tranche 1 will involve JFPR cofinancing of $12 million.  \n \n41.  ADB financing will be provided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, in accordance with \nrelevant ADB policies9 subject to modification that may be included under individual financing \nagreements. The implementation period will be 8 years. The Investment Program will consist of \nindividual tranches, which terms may vary. The MFF will finance civil works, equipment and \ngoods, consulting services, and recurrent costs. All proceeds, except those to be utilized by \nMOM, will be relent to DABS with a tenor of 32 years, including an 8-year grace period, and \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2005.

This is \nintended to bring financial discipline to the DABS and create a revolving pool of funds for use in \nthe energy sector, such as system expansion, rural electrification, and targeted tariff subsidies \nto the poor and vulnerable. Specific methodology shall be agreed during the implementation of \nthe Investment Program within two years after grant effectiveness of tranche 1. \n \n42.  The Government will submit a periodic financing request (PFR) for each tranche, which \nwill be reviewed by ADB in accordance with the FFA. If approved, financing will come from the \nMFF. The Government has submitted the first PFR, requesting $164 million to help finance tranche \n1 project. The terms and conditions for subsequent tranches will be subject to (i) the availability of \nADB Special Funds resources; (ii) Afghanistan\u2019s access to such resources pursuant to ADB\u2019s \nGraduation Policy and the requirement of the ADF donors; and (iii) the availability of ADB Special \nFunds resources to Afghanistan pursuant to then-applicable policies concerning allocation of, and \neligibility for, such funds. Adherence to undertakings made in the FFA and individual tranche \nfinancing agreement covenants will be conditions for financing approval.  \n \n43.  The  last  date  for  any  disbursements  under  any  tranche  will  be  by  30  June  2017. \nAfghanistan is expected to submit the last PFR no later than 31 December 2012. The period of \navailability of tranches will lapse 12 months from the date of Board approval of the MFF.  \n \n44.  In addition, the JFPR will provide $12 million in financing for off-grid, rural electrification \nprojects. Basic data of the JFPR is presented in Appendix 8. JFPR report is in Supplementary \nAppendix L. The financing plan for tranche 1 is in Table 4.  \n \nTable 4: Financing Plan for Tranche 1 and JFPR \nAmount \nTranche 1  ($ million)  % \nAsian Development Bank  164  93.3 \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction  12  0.7 \n   Tranche 1 Total  176  100.0 \nJFPR = Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. \nNote: The table excludes taxes and duties payable by the Government. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Afghanistan Electricity Corporation estimates. \n \n2.  Asian Development Fund IX Grant  \n45.  The Board approved the policy paper on the revised framework for ADF grants on 26 \nSeptember 2007.10 This policy provides that, for countries eligible for grant assistance, the \npercentage of financing on a grant basis in such country will be based on its debt-distress \nclassification. As Afghanistan is classified as a country with a high risk of debt distress, it is \neligible to receive 100% grant financing in tranche 1. \n \n3.  Filters for Financing Tranches \n46.  Financing  may  be  made  available  from  ADB,  provided  the  Investment  Program \ncontinues to be implemented in accordance with the general understandings and expectations \non which the MFF is based, as contained in the FFA. Progress towards achieving the expected \noutcome and outputs set out in the DMF for the energy sector and the Investment Program will \nbe part of the decision-making criteria (and filters) for continuing ADB support. Furthermore, \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2007. Revising the Framework for Asian Development Funds Grants. Manila. ", "      13\ncompliance with the policy framework, safeguard requirements, social development policies, \nand all other undertakings contained in the FFA will also determine ADB\u2019s decision to continue \nfinancing of individual tranches. \n \n47.  If a decision has to be made during the early stages of implementation of tranche 1, \nwhen results most likely would not been achieved yet, ADB\u2019s decision to process additional \nfinancing  tranches  would  be  made  based  on  the  level  of  commitment  and  efforts  of  the \nGovernment and EAs to achieve the outcome set forth in the DMF. Nonphysical tasks agreed \nupon that have a direct effect on the outputs expected from the Investment Program (e.g., \nassumptions and mitigation of risks in the DMF pertaining to the Government and the EAs, such \nas tariff and security issues) will be primary factors in ADB decisions. \n. \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Management of the Investment Program \n48.  DABS will be responsible for the overall implementation of the Investment Program, \nexcept for the Sheberghan Gas Fields Rehabilitation Project, for which MOM will be the EA. A \nPMO will be established in DABS to manage the implementation of all projects. This will include \ndue diligence for new transactions under the Investment Program. Staff will be seconded from \nMOM to the PMO to help implement the Sheberghan Gas Fields Rehabilitation Project. \n \n49.  Given  the  limited  capacity  and  resources  of  the  EAs,  significant  assistance  will  be \nrequired to implement the Investment Program in a timely manner. The PMO will be supported \nby  a  core  team  of  advisers  recruited  from  the  domestic  and  international  markets.  These \nadvisers will help execute projects, handle themes, and provide training. The PMO will be \nmanaged by a director with experience in project management. The PMO will be divided into \nteams, each with a leader and experts to provide specific support. The PMO will also have a \nbudget  line  to  engage  the  services  of  long-  and  short-term  experts.  Details  of  the  PMO \nmandates are in Appendix 9. The teams are as follows: \n \n(i)  Director (front office). The person in charge of the PMO will be engaged for at \nleast 5 years and will be given a mandate to run the PMO daily operations \nwithout Government interference. The director will report to the chief executive of \nDABS. The director will have track record and project management expertise.  \n \n  (ii)  Technical. An expert in energy and power engineering will lead this team, which \nwill also include experts on transmission and distribution, hydropower, and gas \nsector operations. Its mandate will be to deal with all operational or technical \nmatters during implementation, handle design work on subsequent tranches, and \nsupervise contracts. The team will provide inputs on the procurement documents \nand help pre-qualify and qualify bidders as well as evaluate bids in conjunction \nwith other teams (including the legal team). \n \n  (iii)  Legal. This team will provide legal oversight, including on the preparation of \nprocurement documents, bidding management, prequalification and qualification \nof contractors and/or investors, bid awards, preparation of contract documents, \ncontract  variations,  and  reporting  to  ADB  on  FFA  undertakings  and  loan \ncovenants.  The  legal  team  will  provide  checks  and  balances,  and  introduce \nquality control and fiduciary oversight. \n \n ", "14    \n  (iv)  Finance and administration. This will be one of the most important functions \nfrom the point of view of funds management, fiduciary oversight, record keeping, \naudits, and reporting. The team will be managed by a person with a track record \nin  financial  management.  All  withdrawal  applications,  bank  accounts,  and \npayment  instructions  will  be  channeled  through  this  team.  ADB  will  provide \ntraining  on  financing  management,  anticorruption  works,  controller  functions, \nrecord keeping and reporting. \n \n(v)  Safeguard and gender mainstreaming. This team will review all new project \ndesigns, assist in the processing, check on the implementation work, and report \non  the  compliance  of  ADB  safeguard  policies  and  procedures.  Given  the \nimportance  of  gender  mainstreaming,  the  team  will  engage  the  services  of \nexperts on the subject. ADB will have direct access to this team for the purposes \nof monitoring performance on these Tranches. \n \n  (vi)  Due diligence. The PMO will engage experts to help prepare of new projects \nunder the Investment Program. This team will be involved with technical, legal, \nfinancial,  commercial,  economic,  social,  safeguard,  governance,  and  other \nmatters. ADB will provide guidance and support regarding criteria, and rules and \nprocedures. \n \n  (vii)  Results measurement. The PMO will outsource the measurement of results to a \nlocal institute. The methodology for this work is being worked out. ADB will work \ndirectly with the institute to ensure that the approach is consistent with others \nadopted for energy projects. \n \n  (viii)  Communications.  The  PMO  will  engage  the  services  of  a  team  to  provide \nregular communications support. The work will include developing a strategy and \naction plan. ADB will provide guidance and support with respect to outcomes and \noutputs. The idea is to communicate actions being taken, as well as successes. \n \n  (ix)  Capacity building. One of the most important components of the PMO work is \nthe establishment of an advisory team to help DABS, MOM, and other institutions \ninvolved in the sector to do their jobs better. Training will include sector planning \nand  project  management,  financial  management,  policy  works,  and  DABS \nrestructuring (including commercial and operational assistance). The team will \nwork with a pool of Afghan nationals, at least two in each critical task, who will be \nseconded from both DABS and MOM. The idea is to have enough critical mass \nto handle work on accounts of high staff turnover during the operation of the \nPMO.  \n  \n2.  Implementation Period \n50.  The Investment Program is scheduled for execution over 8 years, including procurement \nand construction activities. All priority investments and institutional support will be completed by \n31 December 2016 at the latest. The MFF utilization period is until 30 June 2017. The physical \nimplementation  of  tranche  1  will  be  completed  by  31  December  2013.  An  implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n ", "      15\n3.  Implementation Plan and Project Readiness \n51.  Implementation Plan. A detailed implementation plan for tranche 1 (Appendix 11), backed \nby a facility administration manual (Supplementary Appendix M) has been prepared. These plans \nwill be given to the PMO as a reference to kick-start implementation. A management information \nsystem (MIS) will be set up to record and report information for management decisions. ADB \nprogram supervision teams will use the same MIS. The implementation plan has contract awards \nand disbursement projections. The subsequent tranche projects are also identified, including their \nnature, characteristics, and locations.  \n \n52.  Project Readiness. Preliminary designs or feasibility studies have been prepared for all \ntranche 1 projects, except for the JFPR cofinanced mini hydropower plants in Badakhshan and \nBamyan  provinces.  The  identification,  selection,  planning,  and  design  of  potential  mini \nhydropower sites under JFPR will be carried out in the first half of 2009. This will require \ntechnical assistance to be financed by JFPR. Subsequent tranche projects have been identified, \nbut the final due diligence on them will be conducted under tranche 1. The Investment Program \nis precise in terms of the location and nature of projects. The investment plan has also been \nworked out, but further due diligence is needed. In particular, safeguard compliance requires \nspecial studies for each of the projects and safeguard plans. These will be done as part of the \ndue diligence process.  \n \n53.  For all tranche 1 projects, due diligence has been performed to assess their technical, \neconomical, and financial viability. The concurrence of the Government and EAs were obtained \nfor all tranche 1 projects. The Government also agreed with the tentative list of subsequent \ntranche projects. All tranche 1 projects involving physical investment have been classified as \ncategory B in terms of environmental impact, and initial environmental examination (IEE) reports \nhave been prepared. Land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) plans have been prepared for \nprojects that involve such issues. An environmental assessment and review framework (EARF) \nand  a  LAR  framework  have  been  prepared  for  the  JFPR,  because  project  details  will  be \navailable only during implementation in 2009.  \n \n4.  Procurement \n54.  Procurement of works and goods to be financed under the MFF will be undertaken in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nInternational competitive bidding will generally be used for supply contracts estimated to cost more \nthan $500,000 and for works that cost more than $2 million. National competitive bidding (NCB) \nwill be used for goods and works above $100,000 and below their international competitive \nbidding thresholds. Shopping will be used for goods and works equal to or below $100,000. \n \n55.  In tranche 1, limited international bidding (LIB) is envisaged to procure a contractor for \nthe Sheberghan Gas Fields Rehabilitation Project. Bidding for this project failed on several \noccasions since 2004 to the present because of no interest expressed by third parties.11 USAID \nhas encountered the same problem in seeking bidders for more or less identical works in a field \nadjacent to Sheberghan. After several failed bid attempts, USAID finally issued a contract to a \nfirm in August 2008\u2014roughly 2 years after initiating the bid. One scenario for Sheberghan is to \nwork with the same USAID-funded contractor, which will require LIB. This approach is not \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nIslamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project. \nManila. \n ", "16    \nenvisaged for subsequent tranche projects, although it cannot be ruled out. LIB will only be \nused in exceptional circumstances, always backed by proper due diligence and following due \nprocess with respect to ADB procurement rules.  \n \n56.  While the procurement plan for the Investment Program as a whole is still tentative, the \nplan for tranche 1 is firm (Appendix 12). It will be updated every 6\u201312 months, covering the next \n18  months  of  procurement  activities.  Section  3  of  the  procurement  plan  summarizes  the \nmodifications or clarifications to the Government's procedures that are needed to carry out NCB \nunder ADB financing. The PMO will work on this aspect through its technical and legal teams.  \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n57.  Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The quality-based selection method \nwill  generally  be  used  to  attract  interest  from  qualified  firms,  which  tend  to  avoid  cost \ncompetition  in  a  volatile  environment.  ADB  has  had  experiences  in  Afghanistan  with \nsubstandard consultants being recruited through the quality- and cost-based selection method. \nThis resulted in poor quality work, delays, and cost overruns. Controlling progress, quality, cost, \nand safety of construction works in Afghanistan is widely recognized as a difficult task. The \nperformance of the consultant affected significantly the quality of the output. The quality of \nconsulting services is a success factor. \n \n58.  For tranche 1, single-source selection is proposed for the recruitment of implementation \nconsultants during the Sheberghan Gas Fields Rehabilitation Project for the reasons as those \njustifying LIB. Individual consultants may also need to be recruited for specific assignments \nunder the PMO mandate, in accordance with ADB\u2019s procedures for recruitment of individual \nconsultants. The least-cost selection method will be used to recruit external auditors and \nexperts to monitor the implementation of safeguard plans. The procurement plan with tentative \nconsulting services for the Investment Program and for tranche 1 is in Appendix 12. The terms \nof reference of consultants under tranche 1 are summarized in Appendix 13. \n \n6.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n59.  Advance contracting and retroactive financing are proposed for certain activities under \neach tranche. The Government was informed that for expenditures incurred before tranche \neffectiveness  to  be  eligible  for  retroactive  financing,  procurement,  consultant  recruitment \nprocedures, and other expenses must fully comply with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. When the tranche becomes effective, up to maximum of \n20% of proceeds may be used to retroactively finance eligible expenditures incurred during the \nperiod  not  exceeding  12  months  before  signing  of  the  relevant  financing  agreement.  The \nGovernment  may opt for advance contracting  without  retroactive financing. In that case,  the \nprocurement procedures completed under advance contracting do not conclude with the award of \ncontract until after the tranche becomes effective. The Government and the EAs have been \ninformed that approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to \nfinance any of the proposed projects. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n60.  Loan disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  disbursement  guidelines.  Direct  payment \nprocedures will generally be used for large civil works and consultancy services contracts, as ", "      17\nwell as turnkey contracts. Commitment procedures may be used for large turnkey contracts, and \nsupply and delivery contracts. \n \n61.  EAs will independently establish their respective imprest accounts at a bank acceptable \nto ADB, with initial advances equivalent to the estimated eligible project expenditures for the \nnext  6  months  or  $100,000,  whichever  is  lower.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established, \nmanaged, and liquidated in accordance with the Loan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed \narrangements agreed to by the Government and ADB. Statement of expenditure procedures will \nbe used to reimburse eligible expenditures, or to liquidate and replenish the imprest account for \nany individual payment less than $50,000. The flow of fund is shown in Appendix 14. \n \n8.  Anticorruption Policy  \n62.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  the  EAs.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to projects under \nthe Investment Program. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy are included in the grant regulations and the bidding documents for the Investment \nProgram. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Investment Program \nshall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of the EAs, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey  relate  to  the  Investment  Program.  In  case  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive \npractices are found under any activities within the tranches, ADB will automatically cancel the \nMFF and the concerned tranches. This position has been made clear to the Government.  \n \n9.  Financial Accounting and Auditing \n63.  The EAs will independently (i) maintain separate accounts for each of their projects \nunder the Investment Program; (ii) have such accounts audited annually, in accordance with \nappropriate  auditing  standards  applied  by  independent  auditors  whose  qualifications  and \nexperience are acceptable to ADB; (iii) furnish certified copies of such audited project accounts, \naudited financial statements, and the auditors\u2019 opinion (including the opinions on the use of the \ntranche proceeds) and compliance with the financial covenants of the tranche agreement; and \n(iv) provide such other information concerning the audit requested. The independent auditors \nwill be engaged and financed by the Government or the EAs. \n \n10.  Project Performance and Monitoring \n64.  The PMO will establish a project performance monitoring team. This will set up base case \nvariables for the Investment Program (in line with the DMF and problem tree analysis), collect data \nfor performance monitoring, process it and submit it to the PMO director and ADB. The key \nindicators and assumptions are in the DMF. Some of these may need to be changed or modified \nover time, and new ones added. The variables deal with impact, outcomes, and outputs. The ADB \ntransaction  and implementation teams  will prepare  periodic reports on overall progress. This \ninformation will be shared with the Board. A Board information paper will also be submitted \nannually as part of the MFF operations. Further, the Board will be informed on all PFRs, including \ninformation on safeguard assessments and plans. Any major mishap at the level of the Investment \nProgram or individual tranches (with respect to ADB policies and procedures, or with undertakings \nand covenants under the FFA and the tranche agreements) will be reported to the Board. These \nwill also trigger the suspension or cancellation of the MFF and its tranches.  \n \n ", "18    \n11.  Project Review \n65.  ADB  will  field  an  inception  mission  within  2  months  after  signing  of  the  financing \nagreement  for  tranche  1.  The  mission  will  refine  the  implementation  plan  and  facility \nadministration manual. The Government will cause the EAs, though the PMO director, to submit \nto ADB quarterly progress reports within 2 weeks of the end of that quarter, and semiannual \nperformance and monitoring reports. ADB will review quarterly and semiannually reports during \nits program annual reviews. Regular reviews will be carried out after tranche effectiveness. A \nmidterm review will be undertaken within 4 years after signing of the FFA. It will focus on the \nengineering,  institutional  effectiveness,  results,  environmental  and  social  safeguards, \ncompliance with loan covenants, and compliance with the undertakings set out in the FFA. The \nreview will allow for any necessary corrections. The EAs will submit a project completion report \nwithin 3 months of the completion of each project. \n \n66.  ADB  staff  in  headquarters  and  Afghanistan  Resident  Mission  will  monitor  the \nimplementation of the Investment Program on a joint venture basis and as a team. Additional \nstaff is being deployed to Kabul to work on each of the priority sector Investment Programs: \nenergy, transport, and irrigation. The team will review the Investment Program regularly. An \nannual report on the Investment Program will be produced. This will cover issues related to \neach  of  the  components  and  will  report  on  inputs  and  outputs,  and  will  start  generating \ninformation for outcome and impact indicators in the DMF. All compliance matters will be \ncovered under the review, including warranties and representations, covenants, and adherence \nto ADB policies and procedures. Any changes to the tranches will be captured through these \nreports. These tranches have tentative investment and financing plans, which will be updated \nand included in the annual MFF report or on other reports due under the review process. The \nproject performance report will be updated every month and reported to the front office of the \nCentral  and  West  Asia  Department.  The  front  office  will  call  for  corrective  actions  as \nappropriate.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n67.  The intention of the MFF is that the investments will benefit people and businesses, \nthereby contributing to economic growth and prosperity. Energy security is a huge problem in \nAfghanistan. The main benefits accruing from the investment are tangible; others are not. Some \nare physical; others are institutional in nature. Some will be more immediate, while others will be \nlong term. Benefits under subsequent tranches will be reported under each PFR and reported \nannually in the summary MFF report. \n \nA.  Financial and Economic Benefits \n \n68.  Financial.  A  financial  analysis  for  the  tranche  1  project  has  been  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects (2005). All financial \ncosts and benefits have been expressed in 2008 prices. Cost streams used to determine the \nfinancial internal rate of return\u2014capital investment, operations and maintenance, insurance \ncosts, and taxes\u2014reflect the costs of delivering the estimated benefits. The current tariffs with \nan assumed escalation factor were used to estimate the revenue, while incremental operation \nand maintenance costs were charged for each year. \n \n69.  The financial internal rate of return of 13.5% compares favorably with the estimated \nweighted average cost of capital of 1.20%, indicating financial viability for the project. Financial \nviability was gauged by comparing incremental costs and benefits of \u201cwith project\u201d and \u201cwithout ", "      19\nproject\u201d scenarios. The incremental benefits arise through the increased evacuation of power. \nNon-quantifiable financial benefits, such as the quality of power supply, were not included in the \nfinancial evaluation. A summary of the financial analysis is in Appendix 15.  \n \n70.  Economic. The proposed investments are least-cost. They are part of Afghanistan\u2019s \nintegrated generation and transmission expansion. The economic analysis was based on a \n\u201ctime-slice\u201d approach to the transmission and distribution system development plan. Economic \nperformance was evaluated by comparing \u201cwith project\u201d and \u201cwithout project\u201d scenarios. As \nindividual projects are not stand-alone, they would not yield all their benefits if considered in \nisolation. The Investment Program will ease chronic supply shortages and help demand for \nelectric power. The main benefits stem from (i) removing bottlenecks to efficient supply of \nelectricity to meet the growing energy needs; (ii) improving efficiency, reliability, and emergency \nsecurity; (iii) evacuating power from neighboring countries\u2019 and new plants; and (iv) reducing \nresidential and commercial losses. The economic internal rate of return tranche 1 project is \n21.4%,  (based  on  the  incremental  cost\u2013benefit  streams  associated  with  the  Investment \nProgram). A summary of the economic analysis is in Appendix 16.  \n \nB.  Social and Poverty Impacts \n \n71.  Social and poverty assessments have been carried out. For several projects, samples \nof up to 21 districts in four regions were taken. These surveys established that, although the \nmain use of electricity is for household lighting, people are willing to invest in other appliances, \nand improve living conditions and livelihoods. The Investment Program covers rural and non-\nrural areas, and benefits poor people, especially those in remote rural areas not connected to \nthe grid. The Investment Program will also make a major difference to people in cities. The \nPMO will refine the final poverty and social analysis for each tranche, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nHandbook  on  Poverty  and  Social  Analysis.12 The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social \nstrategy is in Appendix 17. External monitors to be engaged by the EAs will closely monitor the \nimplementation of this strategy. \n \nC.  Social Safeguards \n \n72.  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  The  Investment  Program  is  divided  into  four \ntranches, each involving different types of projects and contract modalities. LAR requirements for \nprojects under tranches 2\u20134 cannot be confirmed at this stage, but available information suggests \nthat the impacts will be similar to those in tranche 1. A LAR framework was prepared in detail for \ntranche 1 investments, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and \nOperations Manual F2 on Involuntary Resettlement. LAR plans for the projects under subsequent \ntranches will be finalized once additional due diligence, and in relevant cases design work, is \ncompleted. The LAR framework is summarized in Appendix 18. \n  \n73.  Tranche 1 projects has been categorized as Category B. Three projects in tranche 1 that \nmay involve low-intensity LAR are (i) NEPS 220 kV Transmission Line: Kunduz\u2013Taloqan; (ii) \nBaharak Small Hydropower Plant and Mini-Grid; and (iii) Development of Small Hydropower \nPlants in Badakhshan and Bamyan Provinces (cofinanced by JFPR). LAR plans for projects \nunder (i) and (ii) have been prepared in accordance with the Involuntary Resettlement Policy \nand the Operations Manual, and were guided by the handbook on involuntary settlement for the \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2001. Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis. Manila. This has been superseded by (i) ADB. 2007. \nHandbook on Social Analysis, A Working Document. Manila; and (ii) ADB. 2006. Poverty Handbook: Analysis and \nProcesses to Support ADB Operations, A Working Document. Manila.  \n ", "20    \nfirst and second projects. Since the specific sites (up to four) for the project under (iii) are to be \nidentified during implementation, LAR plans will be prepared for subprojects involving LAR, \napproved by ADB, and implemented before civil works contractors are mobilized in accordance \nwith the LAR framework. Other projects in tranche 1 with physical investments do not involve \nLAR: (i) NEPS Distribution Network \u2013 Kunduz; (ii) NEPS Distribution Network \u2013 Baghlan; and \n(iii) Sheberghan Gas Fields Rehabilitation.  \n \n74.  LAR  for  subsequent  tranche  projects  will  be  categorized  through  the  involuntary \nresettlement categorization form. LAR plans will be prepared in accordance with the Involuntary \nResettlement Policy and the Operations Manual, and guided by the involuntary resettlement \nhandbook for projects categorized as Category A and B, and will be attached to the PFR. \n \n75.  The PMO and contractors will update LAR plans for projects with turnkey contracts \nduring  the  detailed  design  stage.  For  projects  adopting  the  conventional  design-bid-build \nmodality, the implementation consultants will update them during the preconstruction phase. For \nturnkey projects, the contractor will not be able to start construction until the LAR plan is fully \nimplemented. For design-bid-build projects, a civil works contractor will not be mobilized until \nthe LAR plan is fully implemented. The PMO will monitor the LAR plans and report to ADB. An \nexternal monitor will be responsible for issuing a no-objection certificate for the start of civil \nworks. The external monitor will also prepare safeguard compliance reports twice a year. \n \n76.  Indigenous Peoples. The tranche 1 project has been classified as Category C. Most \nfuture tranche projects are expected to be the same in terms of indigenous peoples impact. The \nproject areas are inhabited by different ethnic groups. The socioeconomic features and level of \nvulnerability of these people do not fit the traits on which the ADB\u2019s definition of indigenous \npeople is based. Indigenous peoples impact of subsequent tranche projects will be categorized \nthrough the indigenous peoples impact categorization form. Indigenous peoples development \nplan and indigenous peoples development frameworks will be prepared in accordance with \nADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) for the projects categorized as Category A. Specific \naction  favorable  to  indigenous  people  will  be  included  in  the  PFR  for  tranche  projects \ncategorized  as  Category  B.  Related  plans  such  as  the  gender  plan  or  the  community \nparticipation plan will be attached to the PFR.  \n \n77.  Labor Standards. DABS and MOM will ensure that all contractors (i) comply with all \napplicable labor laws; (ii) comply with ADB\u2019s Core Labor Standards;13 (iii) use their best efforts \nto employ women and local people negatively affected by, or living in the vicinity of, the \nprojects; (iv) disseminate information at worksites on the risks of sexually transmitted diseases \nand HIV/AIDS for those employed during construction; (v) are required not to differentiate \nbetween men\u2019s and women\u2019s wages or benefits for work of equal value; and (vi) abstain from \nusing child labor. Contractors will ensure that the safety of workers will be in accordance with \nbest international practices. The PMO will be responsible for monitoring and reporting labor \npractices to the Government and ADB.  \n \nD.  Environmental Impact \n \n78.  The majority of projects under the Investment Program are expected to be classified as \ncategory  B.  However,  some  projects  could  be  classified  differently.  If  that  occurs,  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental policies and procedures will apply. Tranches 2\u20134 projects require further due \ndiligence. The current project list is fairly firm, but some changes could take place over the \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2006. Core Labor Standards Handbook. Manila. ", "      21\nInvestment Program period. Tranche 1 project has been subjected to detailed due diligence, \nand has been classified as Category B in terms of environmental impact. Tranche 1 projects \ninvolving physical investment are: (i) NEPS 220 kV Transmission Line: Kunduz\u2013Taloqan; (ii) \nNEPS Distribution Network: Kunduz; (iii) NEPS Distribution Network: Baghlan; (iv) Baharak \nSmall  Hydropower  Plant  and  Mini-Grid;  (v)  Development  of  Mini  Hydropower  Plants  in \nBadakhshan and Bamyan Provinces (cofinanced by JFPR); and (vi) Sheberghan Gas Fields \nRehabilitation. IEE reports for all projects except for the JFPR-cofinanced project have been \nprepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). Because the final sites (up to \nfour) for the JFPR cofinance projects are to be formalized, IEEs will be prepared and approved \nby ADB in accordance with the EARF for these projects before the mobilization of civil works \ncontractors.  \n \n79.  The contractors will update IEEs for projects with turnkey contracts during detailed design \nstage. For the projects adopting design-bid-build modality, the PMO will update them during the \npreconstruction phase. For turnkey projects, the contractor will not be able to start construction until \nthe IEE is approved by ADB. For design-bid-build projects, civil works contractors will not be \nmobilized until the IEE is approved by ADB. The implementation consultants are responsible for \nmonitoring the implementation of the environmental monitoring and management plan attached to \nthe IEEs, and to report to the PMO. An external monitor will be engaged to perform environmental \naudits twice a year and prepare safeguard compliance reports. \n \n80.  Environmental impacts under all subsequent tranche projects will be categorized through \nthe environmental categorization form and supported by rapid environmental assessments. \nEnvironmental impact examination reports will be prepared in accordance with the Environment \nPolicy for projects categorized as Category A and B (sensitive). In accordance with the same \npolicy,  IEE  reports  will  be  prepared  for  projects  categorized  as  Category  B.  These \nenvironmental safeguard documents will be attached to the PFR. \n \nE.  Risks and Assumptions \n \n81.  Assumptions. The Investment Program is based on the following key assumptions: (i) \nsuccessful  and  timely  implementation  of  energy  sector  projects;  (ii)  institutional  capacity, \nincluding efficiency improvements in DABS; and (iii) continued strengthening of sector reforms, \nbetter regulation, institutional change, and a sound tariff regime. The transaction team has taken \ninto account the experiences of earlier projects. The implementation arrangements put in place \nmitigate many of the issues prevalent in the current portfolio. The establishment of the PMO \n(properly managed and funded, independent and with a clear mandate) assumes a tightening of \nproject performance and quality at entry for new investments under all tranches.  \n \n82.  Risks. The key risks to the Investment Program include (i) delayed restructuring of \nDABS operations, (ii) insufficient power imports from neighboring countries, (iii) reversal of the \npolicy directions, (iv) inadequate project management, and (v) continued security risk. \n \n83.  The  restructuring  of  DABS  is  on  course,  although  the  process  will  need  continued \npolitical  commitment  and  expertise,  and  working  capital  financing  in  the  short  term. \nConsiderable technical assistance is being assigned to this task, including from ADB and other \nagencies  such  as  the  World  Bank.  The  development  of  alternative  power  interconnection \ninfrastructure is being supported by an ongoing ADB loan, while the conclusion of a PPA is \nbeing facilitated. \n84.  Electricity supplies from Uzbekistan are not confirmed, although considerable progress was \nmade on this in 2008. Supplies from Tajikistan will come on stream in about 18 months, but only \n ", "22    \nbetween May and August. Electricity supplies from Turkmenistan are not yet formalized, and the \ngas project (to supply Pakistan and India) is only on the drawing board. The Central Asia-South \nAsia Regional Electricity Market Project is still in the planning stage and will take time before \nsupplies reach Afghanistan. As such, Afghanistan urgently needs to have its own energy strategy \nand investments. Kabul receives only 2\u20133 hours of electricity a day. \n \n85.  The reversal of policy directions is unlikely but always possible. Afghanistan needs to \ndevelop energy supplies urgently. Only by following best practices, including a constructive \npolicy framework, will Afghanistan be able to attract international financing. The policy needs \nrefinements, but it is unlikely to be reversed. The MFF includes this as a condition. \n \n86.  Project management has been a problem. Capacity is lacking, and the systems and \nprocedures are inefficient and slow. The establishment of the PMO is an attempt to break with \npast practices, taking a holistic view of the management of project tasks, themes, and reporting. \nSecurity is likely to remain the most difficult problem in the short to medium term. The situation \nseems to be deteriorating  and this will make it difficult to attract investors and contractors, and \nto implement projects. The MFF calls for the establishment of community-based, small-scale \ninvestments and contingency finance to deliver basic services in program areas. This will not \naddress the core cause of the problem, but it might reduce the risk to program contractors.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Undertakings \n \n87.  The Government and the EAs have agreed to the following specific undertakings, in \naddition to the standard undertakings agreed to in the FFA, which will be incorporated in the \nlegal documents.  \n \n88.  Policy  Dialogue.  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  about  its  policies  and \nprojects related to the energy sector that will materially affect the financial viability of each \nproject under the Investment Program, and in particular the power generation and transmission \npolicies, laws, and regulations. \n \n89.  Restructuring. A separate business unit other than DABS (TransCo) will own and \noperate high-voltage (110kV and above) power transmission assets and related switchyards \nand substations by January 2013. A regulatory performance-based contract for TransCo will be \ndeveloped and approved by MEW within 3 years. \n \n90.  Tariff. The tariff formulated for TransCo will be adequate to cover its operating costs, \nmaintenance, depreciation, and financing cost, and to allow an acceptable return on the equity \nof DABS. Afghanistan will ensure that such tariff is effective by January 2013. The Government \nwill ensure that DABS and TransCo have adequate legal powers and enforcement mechanisms \nto effectively collect service fees and penalize defaulters in order to improve the collection \nefficiency, deter non-payment and ensure sustainability of DABS and TransCo\u2019s operations. \n \n91.  Interconnection. Prior to interconnection of the project assets financed under the MFF \nwith the Central Asian Power System (CAPS), TransCo will have adopted GOST14 13109-97 (grid \ncode) as such is applicable to operation and maintenance of high-voltage power transmission \nassets within CAPS. No interconnection with power producers that involves cross-border power \n                                                 \n14 GOST = gosudarstvennyy standart (state standard). ", "      23\ntransmission will occur until after a long-term PPA on terms and conditions commercially viable for \nDABS is signed by respective parties. \n \n92.  Project Selection Criteria. All projects to be financed under the MFF are selected in \naccordance with the agreed criteria set out in the FFA, which adhere to the relevant requirements of \nthe power transmission investment plan and other applicable guidelines for project implementation. \nDABS will monitor the implementation to ensure their successful and timely completion. \n \n93.  Capacity Development. The Government will ensure that key managerial positions on \nprojects financed under the MFF are competitively selected and remunerated, free and clear of any \nrestrictions applicable to Afghanistan\u2019s public servants. \n \n94.  Auditing  and  Accounting.  The  EAs  will  ensure  that  separate  project  accounts  and \nrecords are maintained in a timely manner to adequately identify the use of tranche proceeds in \nsuch a manner and details as may be specified in each financing agreement for relevant tranches. \nAudited financial reports of MFF-financed activities will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of  the \nend of each fiscal year. \n \n95.  Financial Governance. The EAs will ensure that its internal controls are in accordance \nwith  the  National  Accounting  Standards  and  an  independent  and  autonomous  internal  audit \ndepartment will be set up in DABS. DABS financial statements shall be audited annually in \naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards by an external auditor acceptable to \nADB. \n \n96.  Environment. The EAs will ensure that (i) the projects are designed, constructed, and \noperated in accordance with national and local environmental procedures and guidelines and \nwith ADB\u2019s Environment Policy; (ii) the projects are designed, constructed, and operated in \naccordance with the EMPs as reflected in the IEEs and EAR framework; (iii) the environmental \nmanagement and monitoring plan will be incorporated in bidding documents and civil work \ncontracts and implemented; and (iv) environmental performance reports will be submitted to \nADB twice annually during the construction period, including progress made on the mitigation \nmeasures, monitoring data, problems encountered, enforcement plan, and any violations. \n \n97.  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  The  EAs  will  ensure  that  the  design, \nimplementation and operation of the Investment Program are carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), applicable law and government regulations \nin Afghanistan, and the agreed LAR Framework. In the preparation and implementation of \nprojects or projects to be financed under the MFF the EAs ensure that (i) all land and rights-\nof-way required are made available in a timely manner; (ii) traditional (non-turnkey) civil \nworks contractors are mobilized only at the condition that LAR plan approved by ADB is \ndisclosed to the affected people (AP) and implemented; (iii) for all projects, independently \nfrom contract type, civil works will start only after ADB provides no objection and the relevant \nLAR plans are prepared, approved by ADB, disclosed to the APs and implemented; (iv) \ncontractors\u2019 activities are in compliance with requirements of the LAR plans; and (v) an \nindependent monitor acceptable to ADB is engaged to carry out monitoring and evaluation \nand report to ADB based on the requirements of the LAR plans. \n \n98.  Execution of Civil Works Contracts. The EAs will ensure that, subsequent to award of \ncivil works contract under any project, no section or part thereof under the civil works contract will \nbe handed over to the contractor unless the applicable provisions of the LAR framework and  \nplans, including the timely delivery of compensation to APs, indigenous peoples development \n ", "24    \nframework  and  indigenous  peoples  development  plans,  and  the  EARF  and  environmental \nmanagement and monitoring plans have been complied with. Any changes to the location, route, \nalignment, or environment impacts on account of detailed designs of related projects will be subject \nto prior approval by ADB or related agency in accordance with the project selection criteria and \nprocedures specified in the FFA. Prior to the commencement of civil works, an accredited demining \nagency must have certified that the relevant construction site(s) has been cleared. \n \n99.  Social Impacts. \n \n(i)  Gender. The EAs will follow the principles of the ADB\u2019s policy on gender and \ndevelopment  during  the  implementation  of  each  project,  including  taking  all \nnecessary actions to encourage women living in the project area to participate in \nplanning  and  implementing  project  activities.  The  EAs  will  monitor  the  project \neffects on women through, where relevant, gender-disaggregated data collected \npursuant  to  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  referred  to  in  the  project \nperformance monitoring system. \n \n(ii)  Sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS. With assistance of relevant local \nauthorities, the EAs will cause contractors to distribute information on the risks of \nsexually transmitted diseases to those employed during the implementation of \neach project. \n \n(iii)  Women  and  child  labor. The EAs will ensure that (i) there is no differential \npayment between men and women for work of equal value, and (ii) civil works \ncontractors do not employ child labor in construction and maintenance activities in \naccordance with applicable laws and regulations and international conventions. \n \n100.  Security. The Government will ensure that its armed forces and police provide in project \nareas protection required for uninterrupted implementation of each project financed under the \nMFF. In addition, it is required that service and works providers in each project submit security \nplans and budgets that would ensure uninterrupted implementation of their respective project \nactivities, and include them as part of the contracts and contract price.  \n \n101.  Corporate Governance. The Government will ensure that no person serving on the \nboard of DABS, TransCo, an electricity distribution company, or a power generation company is \nconcurrently a board member of any other entity. \n \nB.  Conditions for Tranche Effectiveness \n \n1.  Conditions for the First Tranche \n102.  A  subsidiary  loan  agreement  between  the  Government  and  DABS  is  in  form  and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, has been duly executed and become effective. \n \n2.  Conditions for the Subsequent Tranches \n103.  Tariff.  DABS has submitted petitions for tariff revisions, as required, to maintain their \nfinancial viability. Following a tariff determination by MEW or the regulation authority in place, the \nGovernment will notify such tariff determination in a prompt manner through the official gazette. \nThe Government will ensure that the tariffs determined allow for adequately cover their operating \ncosts, maintenance, depreciation, and financing, and allow an acceptable return on equity.

Overview \n \n1.  The  Afghan  energy  strategy  contains  an  implicit  prioritization  of  energy  subsector \nactivities. Electricity is prioritized over other sectors. The strategy is based on a four-prong \napproach: \n \n(i)  Greater efficiency from existing operations. It is easier, faster, and cheaper to \ngain a megawatt of power from increasing efficiency than from building a new \ngeneration plant. Moreover, addressing end-use efficiency now reduces overall \ncosts. For every $5 the Government spends in providing compact florescent light \nbulbs, it saves $51 and 49 watts. \n(ii)  Improvement in sector governance and coordination, and the promotion of \npublic\u2013private partnerships. The success of the energy sector will depend on \nenergy utilities operating independently and mobilizing private sector investment. \nA multisector regulator would be a good start. The aim is to pursue outsourcing,  \npreparing an enabling legal, policy, and regulatory base for business, and the \ncommercialization of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). In addition, coordination \namong the entities and aid agencies must be strengthened. To accomplish this, \ncapacity must be improved. \n(iii)  Rural  energy.  Most  rural  areas  lack  electricity.  This  affects  most  of  the \npopulation. \n(iv)  Investments  in  new  capacity. Progress in creating new supplies has been \ninsufficient. The Government wants to increase production from various sources, \nincluding hydro, gas, and coal. New supplies must be rationalized, and efforts \nmust be focused on a few large projects, such as the North East Power System \n(NEPS). \n \n2.  In addition to addressing immediate and short-term needs, the country also needs to \nconsider longer-term issues. Because Afghanistan is building its energy infrastructure from the \nground up, it can learn from the lessons in other countries. It can prioritize energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy. While the national grid is important in transporting power from cheaper \nmarkets, decentralized power will prove more beneficial in the long run. By locating power \ngeneration closer to users, losses can be significantly reduced.  \n \nB.  Actions Under the Strategy \n \n1.  Increased Efficiency from Existing Operation. \n \n3.  A  key  objective  of  the  strategy  is  to  add  850,000  residential  and  nonresidential \nconnections by 2010. This will increase access from 27% to 65% of total population in urban \nareas and from 6% to almost 25% nationally. By 2015, the goal is to increase urban access to \n90% and overall national access to 33%. This work will require the rehabilitation of the system, \nincluding substations and transformers, and distribution networks. \n \n4.  Existing  generation  facilities,  including  hydropower  and  thermal  plants,  require \nimmediate reconstruction. Small diesel generating sets need to be purchased to supplement he \npower supply in selected urban areas, and micro hydro and other energy resources need to be \ndeveloped in rural areas. Through these combined efforts, the supply of electricity throughout \nthe country should increase by 66%. ", "Appendix 3  37\n \n5.  Technical Operations. The electricity system is technically deficient. Investments are \nneeded  in  the  dispatch  system,  the  controls,  reactive  power,  and  technical  codes  need \nimprovement. \n \n6.  Energy Efficiency. The use of efficient lighting, installation of motion detectors, the use \nof better light bulbs, and greater public awareness are some areas for efficiency improvements.  \n \n7.  Regional Energy. In the short term, maximizing the use and performance of existing \nassets includes increasing the domestic load to support cross-border power deals. This will \nimprove energy security while working on domestic supplies. \n \n2.  Sector Governance, Coordination, and Public\u2013Private Partnerships \n \na.  Governance \n \n8.  Commercialization. One of the most important activities is to transform SOEs into \ncorporate  entities  operating  under  commercial  principles  independent  from  the  overseeing \nministries, while changing the ministries\u2019 mandate from operating utilities into regulators and \nfacilitators. \n \n9.  Afghanistan Electricity Organization (DABM) is undergoing such a transformation. An \naudit of DABM assets, liabilities, and employees has been conducted. Liquidation of DABM is \nexpected to be completed by March 2009. On 17 March 2008, the Cabinet approved the articles \nof incorporation for Afghanistan Electricity Corporation (DABS), which will convert it into a \nGovernment-owned commercial company that will operate under the Commercial Code. Viable \nassets and technically qualified employees of DABM will be transferred to DABS by the end of \n2008.  \n \n10.  The  strategy  to  commercialize  power  operations  includes  the  following:  (i)  a  new \norganization at DABS, including a board of directors and senior management group comprising \na chief executive and financial, operational, and commercial officers; (ii) consolidation of the 19 \ncorporate offices into eight \u201dhubs,\u201d which will be converted into profit centers; (iii) installation of \nmetering, billing, and collection systems; management information systems; and accounting and \nprocurement systems; (iv) regularized internal and independent external audit functions; and (v) \nestablishment of new departments including legal, customer service, and loss reduction. \n \n11.  Divestments.  The  Government  has  designed  a  divestment  strategy  calling  for  the \nliquidation, restructuring, corporatization, and/or privatization of other energy assets under state \ncontrol. This process will start in 2009. \n \n12.  The Water and Power Engineering Authority and the Power Construction Unit have been \napproached by private investors. Bringing the Power Construction Unit operations under DABS \nis being considered. \n \n13.  Northern  and  Sabzak  coal  enterprises  have  been  leased  through  management \ncontracts. A review is under way to determine how these and other hydrocarbon assets may be \noperated better in the future. \n \n14.  Governance. The complexity of the institutional framework contributes to difficulties in \ndeveloping an effective strategy for the sector, and implementing and monitoring rehabilitation \n ", "38   Appendix 3 \nworks and reforms. Functions within ministries need to be combined and streamlined, with the \ngoal of reducing the Government\u2019s direct involvement in the sector.  \n \n15.  Financial Discipline. Market-based operations are new to Afghan energy managers. As \npart of the strategy, the Government will seek support from its development partners to improve \nfinancial management. This requires designing and preparing an integrated annual energy \nbudget based on Government support that is in line with the strategic priorities. In addition, new \nprotocols for budget management and oversight need to be put in place in the Ministry of \nFinance and the energy ministries.1 The Government will build near-term capacity in accounting, \nproject finance, audit, and fiscal performance.  \n \n16.  Legal and Regulatory Frameworks. The legal and regulatory frameworks are weak \nand need strengthening. Despite the approval of the Minerals Law in 2005, the legal foundation \nis  inadequate  to  support  legitimate  private  investment,  protect  consumers,  and  ensure \ntransparent spending. The Government needs support in this area. Some regulatory work is \nunder  way,  but  progress  has  been  slow  and  uncoordinated.  This  matter  requires  a  more \nsystematic approach to longer-term sector reform. \n \n17.  Capacity. Capacity development initially should focus on four areas: \n \n(i)  Technical.  Antiquated  systems  require  modernization.  Greater  capacity  is \nneeded to operate new high-voltage transmission lines, and to explore oil and \ngas fields. Renewable and coal technologies that ensure safe, clean operations \nare required. Health and safety have received little attention, and enforcement \nand inspection are weak. \n(ii)  Commercial. Institutions need to be made more commercially oriented, and to \nintroduce cost-recovery actions at the level of the institutions. \n(iii)  Legal  and  regulatory. The courts, local energy enterprises, and the energy \nministries,  Ministry  of  Justice  and  Ministry  of  Finance  need  training  on \ncommercial matters. \n \nb.  Coordination \n \n18.  Coordination is lacking at two levels: (i) within the Government, and (ii) between the \nGovernment and the development partners. The strategy calls for improvements in both areas. \n \n19.  Consolidation of Government Energy Functions. Energy functions are spread across \nfive ministries, with inputs from three other ministries as well as various national programs. This \nmakes coordinating energy strategy difficult. A strategic move would be to establish one Ministry \nof Energy. \n \n20.  Coordination  between  the  Government  and  Development  Partners.  The  Inter-\nMinisterial Commission for Energy (ICE) was established in 2006 as the coordinating and \npolicy-making body for energy activities. Chaired by the Ministry of Economy, ICE includes the \nministries of Energy and Water, Finance, and Mines as core members. ICE was designed to \nhelp  the  Government  understand  and  monitor  energy  development  based  on  commercial \nprinciples. It oversees energy sector policy and infrastructure investments, and coordinates with \ndevelopment partners. ICE brings together a wide array of interests from the Government and \n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Energy and Water, Ministry of Mines, Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, Ministry of Commerce and \nIndustries, Ministry of Urban Planning, and Ministry of Agriculture.

It also assists the Government with agreements \nwith the private sector. \n \nc.  Privatization \n \n21.  Private  Sector  in  the  Afghan  Energy  Sector.  The  Government  has  paid  limited \nattention to the role of private investment. While the commercialization of the state power \ncompany (DABM) has started, the restructuring does not include the 66 DABM operations within \nthe 19 regional DABM offices. \n \n22.  Independent Power Production. While there is ample evidence of small diesel and \nhydropower  generation  throughout  the  country,  large  viable  independent  or  private  power \nprojects have not been restructured. The Government has not explored build-own-operate, \nbuild- operate-transfer, or other traditional power sector models. \n \n23.  Outsourcing. Outsourcing of power sector functions to the private sector has been \nslow. Services including operations and maintenance, spare parts supply, fuel procurement, \nbilling and accounting, and technical management could be contracted out. \n \n24.  Concessions.  In  the  absence  of  the  final  hydrocarbons  law  and  regulations,  the \nGovernment  supports  contracting  through  concessions.  Mobilizing  these  types  of  contracts \nthrough transparent tender processes will be emphasized more in the coming years. This \napproach is needed to deal with oil, natural gas, and coal resources. \n \n3.  Rural Energy \n \n25.  Rural energy development is an integral part of the strategy. The approach is to develop \noff-grid and on-grid generation capacity, and to link this to consumers through new investments \nin transmission. \n \n4.  Investment in New Capacity  \n \n26.  Generation.  The  domestic  generation  agenda  included  developing  hydropower  and \nthermal power, including gas and coal. \n \n27.  Transmission. The country needs at least three new high-voltage power transmission \nlines to evacuate imported power and to encourage domestic production. Many parts of the \ncountry lack coverage. \n \n28.  Distribution. The priority is to improve the system in Kabul. This includes technical \nrehabilitation of existing power lines, development of loss-reduction programs, installation of \ntechnically sound meters, meter reading protocols, and better billing and collection.  \n \n29.  Expansion and Synchronization of the Grid. Isolated grids need to become integrated \ninto the national grid. With the importation of more power supplies, the synchronization of the \nAfghan grid with its northern neighbors\u2019 grids is vital. This will require investments. \n \n30.  Small-Scale Power. About 80% of the Afghan people live in rural and remote locations. \nThe  National  Solidarity  Program  (NSP),  led  by  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Rehabilitation  and \n ", "40   Appendix 3 \nDevelopment (MRRD), is supporting more use of micro hydropower, solar, and wind energy, \nwhere possible. The Government is committed to commercializing these activities. \n \n31.  Assessments on New Energy Sources and Uses. Since 2003, several project-based \nfeasibility studies have been conducted. These need to be updated.  \n \n5.  Implementation  \n \n32.

Tranche 2 Projects \n \n1.  North East Power System (NEPS) 220 kV Transmission Line Replication: Pul-e-\nKhumri\u2013Chimtala ($80 million). The project is a 200-kilometer, double-circuit transmission line \nfrom Pul-e-Khumri to Chimtala (Kabul). The NEPS system already has a transmission line along \nthis corridor. However, as Afghanistan Electricity Corporation (DABS) is planning to import \nelectricity from Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and expand the NEPS system to south of Kabul, \ncapacity constraints along this corridor will become a bottleneck. Therefore, before any physical \nexpansion of NEPS to the south of Kabul, the capacity of this section needs to be augmented. \n \n2.  DABS Institutional Capacity Development ($10 million). This project will assist DABS \nprimarily with capacity building for their management information system, a metering program, \nintroduction or upgrading of the billing system, and implementing efficiencies in their collection \nsystem. \n \n3.  Project Management and Due Diligence\u2014Consulting Services ($5 million). The \nproject  will  support  the  project  management  office  in  conducting  a  feasibility  study  on \nhydropower and irrigation schemes in the Lower Kokcha River.  \n \n4.  NEPS 220 kV Transmission Line: Southern Extension Phase I ($55 million). The \nGovernment has asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to consider the development of \ninfrastructure south of Kabul. Subject to stable security south of Kabul, ADB has agreed in \nprinciple to consider financing the construction of the transmission line from Kabul to Gardez. In \nphase I, development between Kabul and Pul-e-Alam is envisaged. \n \nB.  Tranche 3 Projects \n \n5.  NEPS  220  kV  Chimtala  160  MVA  Substation  Replication  ($35  million).  The \nsubstation at Chimtala (Kabul) needs to expand from the current 320 MVA. An additional 160 \nMVA is sufficient to remove bottlenecks from the system over the medium term. \n \n6.  Lower Kokcha River Hydropower Plant Phase I ($44 million). The development of \nthe Lower Kokcha River hydropower plant has been identified for tranches 3 and 4. Financing \nwill be contingent on meeting ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. \n \n7.  NEPS 220 kV Transmission Line: Southern Extension Phase II ($21 million). In \nphase II, development between Pul-e-Alam and Gardez is envisaged. \n \nC.  Tranche 4 Project \n \n8.  Lower Kokcha River Hydropower Plant Phase II ($156 million).

Introduction \n1.  The financial analysis of the proposed projects under tranche 1 has been carried out in \naccordance with the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects1 of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). All financial costs and benefits have been expressed at constant 2008 prices. Cost \nstreams used to determine the financial internal rate of return (FIRR)\u2014capital investment, and \noperations and maintenance\u2014reflect the cost of delivering the estimated benefits. The assumed \ntariffs are based on existing tariffs used for the respective projects. \n \nB.  Methodology and Major Assumptions \n2.  The Investment Program involves several projects. Apart from the Baharak Hydro Power \nPlant project, all of the project\u2019s financial benefits are calculated based on the assumption that \nthe country\u2019s 220-kilovolt (kV) transmission line system will be in operation and transmitting \npower by the time the projects are completed.  \n \n3.  Financial viability was examined by comparing the incremental costs and benefits of \n\u201cwith  investment\u201d  and  \u201cwithout  investment\u201d  scenarios.  The  incremental  benefits  arise  from \nincreases  in  power  transmitted  through  the  transmission  and  distribution  system  because \nphysical constrains have been removed as a result of the investment. Installing additional \ntransmission  and  distribution  infrastructure  removes  the  bottlenecks  that  prevent  available \ngeneration and import capacity from being transmitted. Incremental operating and maintenance \ncosts have been computed as a percentage of the investment. It is assumed that the investment \nwill have a 30-year economic life; residual value has not been factored in. \n \n4.  Tariffs are not set by a central agency on a regional basis. Tariffs used in this analysis \nare based on the existing tariffs used in the region of the project, and have been adjusted to a \nlevel of self sustainability of the project. The demand function for the adjusted tariffs has been \ncomputed using past studies on demand for electricity in Afghanistan, primarily from technical \nassistance.2  \n \n5.  For the operations and maintenance project, which does not generate revenue, no \nbenefits were included and an FIRR analysis was not undertaken. Costs from the projects were \nincluded in the analysis of the overall financial viability of Tranche 1. Detailed information on the \nmethodology and assumptions is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \nC.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital and Financial Internal Rate of Return \n6.  To  compute  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC),  it  is  assumed  that  the \nfinancing  sources  would  consist  of  Afghanistan  Electricity  Corporation  (DABS)  equity \ncontribution financed through retained earnings. Based on Afghanistan\u2019s long-term depository \ninterest  rate,  the  cost  of  DABS\u2019s  equity  is  calculated  at  7%  in  nominal  costs.  The  other \nassumptions  are  a  domestic  inflation  rate  of  8%  and  tax  rate  of  3%.  The  WACC  for  the \ninvestment program during 2009\u20132012 is 0.92% (Table A15.1). \n \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005 Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.

Rationale \n \n1.   Government  is  the  main  investor  in  electricity  transmission  throughout  the  world. \nInvestment in power transmission involves large amounts of capital, little maintenance cost, and a \nreturn over a long period. Government or an independent regulator regulates this sector because \nof its natural monopolistic characteristics\u2014high fixed costs make it unprofitable for a second firm to \nenter and compete. \n \n 2.   All the components are part of the least-cost expansion program developed under the \npower system master plan. The plan considers supply alternatives to areas without grid supply and \nwith large-scale isolated diesel generation. The Investment Program is the least-cost option for \ndeveloping transmission and distribution network in the selected cities. Incrementally, the Project \nprogram  will  greatly  reduce  the  reliance  on  inefficient  and  high-cost  village,  household,  and \nenterprise self-generation at unit costs in the range $0.15\u2013$0.55 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). The \nestimated average incremental cost of grid-connected electricity is $0.079 per kWh. \n \nB.   Economic Cost of Project Components \n \n3.   To convert financial project cost into economic cost, turnover and income taxes were \ndeducted, and connection costs were added. Annual operation and maintenance (O&M) and \nadministration costs were calculated in economic prices (with financial prices adjusted using the \nstandard conversion factor). No price contingencies were included in the base capital cost, but the \neconomic  capital  costs  include  physical  contingencies.  Costs  were  separated  into  foreign \nexchange and local costs. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 was used. The cost of supply was \nvalued based on the long-run marginal cost for generation and transmission as calculated in the \npower sector master plan. \n \n 4.   As  in  the  financial  analysis,  30  years  was  used  for  the  project  economic  analysis. \nInvestment is assumed to take place during 2010\u20132013, and projects benefits are assumed to be \nrealized thereafter. Beyond 2025, further investment will be required to meet incremental demand \ngrowth. \n \n5.  With regards to the O&M component, Afghanistan Electricity Corporation (DABS), the \nstate-owned enterprise responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity in \nAfghanistan,  operates  the  110-kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  system.  However,  DABS  lacks  the \ntechnical and managerial capacity, as well as the experience, to operate and maintain the more \ncomplex 220 kV transmission system, and to coordinate the operations with systems dispatched. A \nnumber of options were considered. Contracting out O&M of the transmission system with a \ncapacity  building  program  was  identified  as  the  preferred  option,  because  it  enables  the \ntransmission system to become operational immediately after construction is completed. It also \nfacilitates the transfer of technical and managerial expertise. Further, it provides a structured \ntraining program (both classroom and hands-on training) to develop the capacity of DABS staff to \noperate  the  transmission  system  after  the  management  contract  has  expired.  A  detailed \nexplanation of the economic analysis of the O&M is in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \nC.  Quantification of Benefits \n \n6.  The main benefits are derived from (i) the eventual connection to northern neighboring \ncountries for the long-term reliable electricity; (ii) the connection of new customers to electricity; (iii) \n ", "    Appendix 16  73\nimproved availability and reliability; and (iv) the use of non-diesel sources to generate electricity, \nand  loss  reduction.  The  incremental  and  non-incremental  benefits  were  selected  separately. \nIncremental benefits were calculated using customers\u2019 willingness to pay. Non-incremental benefits \nwere not captured in the calculation, as resource cost savings for individual components could not \nbe reliably estimate.  \n  \n7.  Most households in the project area do not have access to grid electricity. However, village-\nsponsored systems and privately operated generators based on diesel or gas-powered generation \nsets provide limited amounts of electricity. Thus, even in the absence of grid supply, the residential, \nGovernment, and other sectors consume some electricity, although the price paid is substantially \nhigher than for the grid-connected customers. \n   \n1.  Domestic Consumers \n \n8.  For the economic analysis, adjustments were made to incremental electricity sales to \nexclude  non-incremental  energy  consumption,  i.e.,  existing  energy  consumption  that  will  be \ncaptured by Afghanistan Electricity Organization (DABM) as the network is rehabilitated. Based on \nthe findings of the socioeconomic survey, the domestic average non-incremental demand was \nestimated at 9.3 kWh per month per household. For other consumer groups, it was assumed that \nsuppressed demand is met from other electrical and nonelectrical sources. \n \n9.  The economic benefits of extending the grid supply to unserved areas are estimated based \non the cost of alternative energy sources used for existing consumption levels, as well as on the \nwillingness to pay for induced consumption if a reliable grid supply were available. An analysis of \nthe socioeconomic survey showed that that the non-incremental consumption of electricity or its \nequivalent in other forms of energy is approximately $5.80 per household per month, whether grid-\nconnected or not. Many households with access to electricity are supplied by village-operated gas- \nor  diesel-powered  generation  sets  for  an  average  of  about  5  hours  per  day.  The  average \nexpenditure per household from this source is $5.12 per month for consumption of 9.3 kWh, \nequivalent to $0.55 per kWh. \n \n10.  Households in project areas connected to the grid pay a tariff of $0.02\u2013$0.05 per kWh. \nThey spend on average $5.86 per month for electricity, consuming 107\u2013281 kWh per household \nper month. Thus, incremental consumption of electricity within the project areas in the domestic \nsector is 98.5\u2013280 kWh per month per household (total average consumption with the project less \nnon-incremental consumption). Therefore, non-incremental consumption of electricity is valued at \nthe resource cost of $0.55 per kWh. \n \n11.  Incremental consumption of electricity, valued assuming a linear demand function (i.e., that \n50% of the difference between the current tariff and the cost of the alternative represents consumer \nsurplus), is estimated at $0.03 per kWh). A semi-log demand function, which would theoretically \nlower the value of the incremental consumption, was not used, because the price change would \nnot be significant after rounding to one decimal place in US dollars. \n \n12.  The analysis ignored any benefit from supply reliability improvements because the level of \nindustrialization is very low in Afghanistan and, consequently, the difference between the value of \nlost load and tariff  will  be  low.  An average incremental cost  of future electricity supply  was \nestimated as part of the power system master plan to be about $0.09 per kWh for the integrated \ncentral grid. Most customers in the current and expanded network will be connected at the low-\nvoltage level. At current tariffs, supply costs are typically under-recovered, and an economic \nsubsidy to domestic consumers will be realized as the system expands. \n ", "74   Appendix 16 \n2.  Operation and Maintenance \n \n13.  Minor benefits to the O&M component have been identified. However, for the purposes of \ncalculating the EIRR, it is believed that the net economic benefits of the O&M component are the \nforegone benefits of the other projects without implementation of the component. In other words, \nwithout the O&M component, DABS would not be able to operate the 220 kV system leading to the \ntransmission line remaining idle or producing unreliable and low-quality service. Therefore, the \ncomponent contributes to the project as an \u201call or nothing\u201d benefit\u2014benefits of the other projects \nwould be gained with the inclusion of the O&M component, but none would be gained without it. As \nsuch, only the costs of the O&M component have been included in the EIRR analysis without \nincluding any specific benefit coming from the O&M component directly. \n \n3.  Gas Fields Rehabilitation \n \n14.  An  additional  benefit  for  the  Sheberghan  Gas  Fields  Rehabilitation  Project\u2014gas \npurchases by DABS for a future gas-fired power plant\u2014has been factored in. The economic \nbenefit of rehabilitating the gas facilities are revenues from the sale of incremental fuel to DABS. \nProduction is assumed to start in 2015 with 2.8 million gigajoules (GJ) per year sold, increasing \nto more than 10.0 million GJ in 2030. The gas tariff is conservatively set at $6 per GJ throughout \nthe model life. \n \nD.  Economic Model and Evaluation \n \n15.  To test the economic viability of each of the components, the economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) was calculated based on the incremental cost and benefit streams associated with \neach  project.  The  economic  analysis  evaluated  the  economic  performance  of  the  proposed \ncomponents by comparing the \u201cwith project\u201d and \u201cwithout project\u201d scenarios, i.e., the economic \nvalue of the incremental and non-incremental supply of electricity that the components will provide \ncompared with the existing patterns of energy use in non-electrified areas. \n \n16.  Economic returns are acceptable for most projects. This stems from the capacity of the grid \nextensions to bring urban-quality power at the urban tariff to rural villages that would otherwise face \nhigh costs for low-quality service. The Baharak hydro power project is 0.5 percentage points below \nthe 12% benchmark because of its large loan (about $30 million) for a relatively small generation \noutput (2 megawatts) and a small initial service population (35,000). The project is considered \nimportant  because  the  service  population  is  isolated.  However,  the  facility  will  allow  poor \nhouseholds on average to consume more than 10 times the electricity that they had access to with \na similar household budget without the project. The Sheberghan Gas Fields Rehabilitation Project \nproduces a relatively high EIRR because all of the purchases will be used to supply a planned gas-\nfired power plant that will supply the national grid with electricity. \n ", "    Appendix 16  75\n \nTable A16.1: Summary of Economic Internal Rate of Return for Project Components \nEIRR \nProject  (%) \n1.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008)a support programs for power transmission and distribution. \nBecause  of  the  prolonged  conflict,  creating  livelihood  opportunities  and  stabilizing  economic  life  have  been \ncontinuing challenges. The country faces a tremendous challenge in increasing and maintaining a stable supply of \nenergy. Although the primary focus has been on lighting and heating, a longer-term approach is required if \nelectricity is to contribute to sustained economic growth and support poverty reduction efforts. \n \nMore than 80% of the population lives in rural and remote areas, where off-grid energy supply is supported through \nthe National Solidarity Project (NSP). The Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction component will provide support to this \nsector, while the transmission and distribution component will support urban and/or town supply.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1. Key Issues  \nThe continuing state of conflict in Afghanistan has resulted in deteriorating systems for energy transmission and \ndistribution nationally. The rural poor particularly have no access to a reliable supply of energy. \n \nSupporting better efficiency of the sector and improving access are expected to ensure a reliable supply to multiple \nusers.  Providing  a  stable  supply  of  energy  through  support  for  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  energy \ninfrastructure, including institutional development, will help to stimulate the local economy and improve household \nsupply.  \n \nProjects under the Investment Program will focus on rehabilitation and expansion of existing facilities, including off-\ngrid rural electrification beyond the main population centers. Additionally, uninterrupted, 24-hour supply is expected \nfor eastern and northeastern Afghanistan, as well as district centers not yet connected to the grid. \n \nFor the commercial and industrial sectors, which currently use generators or fuelwood, a stable electricity supply is \nconsidered a key stimulus for rehabilitating now-defunct industry and establishing new ones, such as oil refineries, \nsugar mills, and rice mills. Small-scale businesses are likely to expand when connected to the grid.  \n \nThe population in the beneficiary areas is growing, and the standard of living of most households is improving. As \nsuch, a healthy demand for electricity can be expected. Over time, the Investment Program is expected to \ncontribute to greater productivity in the industrial and small-scale commercial sectors.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nThe project is expected to directly benefit about 92,000 households, or 1.2 million poor people. The average daily \nper capita income was estimated at $0.39 per day.   \n \nThe population benefiting from the project is urban- or town-based and rural. The primary occupation is farming, followed \nby government employment. Household\u2019s have multiple sources of income, either through the household head or other \nwage-earning family members.  \n \nA stable electricity supply was considered a second priority to clean, potable water by the households surveyed for \nthe social assessment. Electricity was perceived to be a strong contributor to better learning opportunities for \nchildren, generally better livelihoods, and wider access to regular water supply. Fewer health problems resulting \nfrom the substitution of kerosene with electricity was perceived to be an important benefit. The study found a strong \nwillingness to pay, but the agency responsible for payment collections was weak. Of the 1,161 households \nsurveyed, 81.6% responded that the current supply was inadequate for their household needs and 62% were willing \nto pay for a grid connection. The poorest households expended a higher share of their income on energy, with \nkerosene being the most common form. Grid-supplied electricity was found to be the cheapest form of electricity \nused by poor households.  \n ", "    Appendix 17  77\n \nRegular  supply  and  access  is  also  expected  to  provide  support  to  the  Disarmament,  Demobilization  and \nReintegration Program. Ex-combatants who surrender their weapons are retrained and provided with start-up costs \nand supported in forming a business. In addition, the presence of the United Nations, bilateral and nongovernment \norganization programs that also assist in community development initiatives, returning refugees and internally \ndisplaced persons; reintegration and support to women\u2019s participation in civil and economic activities will all benefit \nfrom  improved  supply  and  efficiency.  In  small  towns,  small  businesses,  such  as  shops,  restaurants,  agro-\nprocessing, and home-based businesses, are likely to gain the most.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Community consultation meetings were held with the local governments, heads of regional security, and \ncommunity  representatives  of  Kunduz,  Khanabad,  and  Takhar  cities.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \ndiscussed with the local government officials the scope of the projects and ADB\u2019s commitment to the Government, \nand all of them gave their commitment to fully support the project once started. All communities welcomed the \nproposed projects. The only concerns raised were the length of time to complete construction. The ADB informed \nthe communities about the processes involved, from design to construction, and the link to imported power from \nneighboring countries. The head of Ministry of Energy and Water in Kunduz also requested assistance with the \ndisposal of old transformers. The Mission established that the line route from Kunduz to Taloqan has been changed \nfrom its previous alignment, which requires a re-estimation of costs. Security issues were discussed, and the region \nis assessed as low risk. \n2.

Introduction \n1.  Background \n1.  Afghanistan is requesting financial assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto implement the Energy Sector  Enhancement Investment Program. Afghanistan Electricity \nCorporation (DABS) will be the Executing Agency (EA). Finance will be provided through a \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) comprising discrete projects to be implemented sequentially \nover 5 years, indicatively under three tranches. The Investment Program includes physical and \nnonphysical  projects.  Projects  in  tranche  1  with  physical  investments  that  may  entail  land \nacquisition and resettlement (LAR) include (i) a transmission line from Kunduz to Taloqan, and \n(ii)  the  Baharak  Hydropower  development.  Similar  types  of  projects  are  envisaged  for  the \nsubsequent tranches. \n2.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plans  \n2.  DABS prepared this LAR framework1 to guide the preparation of LAR plans or short LAR \nplans2 for  projects  under  the  Investment  Program  in  a  fashion  fitting  the  requirements  of \nAfghanistan  law  and  ADB's  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  This  LAR  framework \noutlines provisions, procedures, and institutional requirements for preparing and implementing \nLAR plans in projects that require LAR. The program management office (PMO) of DABS, assisted \nby  experts  engaged  through  the  management  and  implementation  consultants,  will  be \nresponsible for conducting the social assessment and preparation of LAR plans as per this LAR \nframework. \n \n3.  LAR- Related Project Implementation Conditions \n3.  The initiation of the work for each tranche will be conditioned on the preparation of an \ninitial impact assessment identifying likelihood/ and nature of LAR impacts, as well as the LAR \nplanning capacity needed for the tranche and projects. Based on this initial assessment, the LAR \nframework may have to be modified to address LAR issues specific to the tranche and projects. \nOnce a project design is finished, a due diligence scoping plan subdividing project sections or lots \nbetween those with and without LAR will be a condition for initiating any civil work in sections \nwhere LAR is not needed. Finally, the preparation and implementation of a LAR plan acceptable \nto ADB will be a condition to initiate civil works in sections or lots where LAR is required. The draft \nLAR plans based on detailed designs and on completion of the detailed measurement survey \n(DMS).  A full census and inventory of losses will be disclosed in Dari to the affected persons and \naffected families and submitted to ADB for review and approval before the beginning of civil \nworks.  Compensation  and  other  assistance  will  be  paid  to  the  affected  persons  before \nconstruction begins. \n                                                 \n1  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) as well as national policy instruments, and laws, \nparticularly the provisions under Law on Land Acquisition in the Constitution of Afghanistan. The compensation \npolicy framework and entitlements for this project are formulated with reference to the salient sections of the Law \non Land Acquisition and the ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. \n2  Resettlement is considered significant if 200 or more people experience major impacts (defined as impacts \ninvolving physical displacement and/or or a loss greater than 10% of their income-generating assets. In case of a \nproject with significant impacts, a full LAR plans will be prepared. If impacts are not significant, short LAR plans will \nbe instead required. A short LAR plan covers the same issues as that of a full LAR plan, as relevant, but in less \ndetail. \n \n ", "80   Appendix 18 \n \nB.  Review of Afghanistan Policy and ADB Requirement \n4.  While policies and laws of Afghanistan pertaining to LAR are presented in the LAR \nframework, Table A18.1 provides a comparison between ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy \nand Afghanistan\u2019s Land Acquisition Law (LAL). \n \nTable A18.1: Comparison of ADB\u2019s Resettlement Policy and LAL of Afghanistan \nADB Policy  Land Acquisition Law   Remarks or /Resolution \nAffected families should be fully  National legislation does not provide for  National  legislation  does  not  provide  for \ninformed and consulted in  public consultation.  public  consultation.

Resettlement Principles for the Program \n5.  Based on this analysis of national provisions and ADB policy (Table A18.1), the broad \nresettlement principles for this Investment Program will be the following: \n(i)  Affected person impacts must be avoided or minimized as much as possible. \n(ii)  If impacts are unavoidable, the affected persons will be identified and assisted in \nimproving or regaining their standard of living. \n(iii)  Information  on  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  a  LAR  plan  will  be \ndisclosed to all affected persons, and people\u2019s participation will be ensured in \nplanning and implementation. All LAR plans for the projects with resettlement \nimpacts will be disclosed to the affected persons. \n(iv)  Land will be acquired for the project in accordance with the LAL of Afghanistan \nand ADB policy. The LAL specifies adequate compensation for the properties to \nbe acquired. Additional support would be extended for meeting the replacement \nvalue of the property. Affected persons who do not own land or other properties, \n ", "    Appendix 18  81\nbut have economic interests or lose their livelihoods, will be assisted according to \nthe broad principles described in this document. \n(v)  Before taking possession of the acquired lands and properties, compensation \nand resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R) assistance will be paid in accordance \nwith the provision described in the respective resettlement plans. \n(vi)  An  entitlement  matrix  for  different  categories  of  affected  persons  has  been \nprepared  and  provisions  will  be  kept  in  the  budget  for  those  who  were  not \npresent at the time of census survey. However, people moving into the project \narea after the cutoff date will not be entitled to any assistance. In case of land \nacquisition, the date of notification for acquisition will be treated as the cutoff \ndate. For non-titleholders, such as squatters and encroachers, the date of the \nproject census survey or a similar designated date declared by the executing \nagency will be considered the cutoff date. \n(vii)  Appropriate grievance redress mechanisms will be established at the district level \nto ensure speedy resolution of disputes. \n(viii)  All activities related to resettlement planning, implementation, and monitoring \nwould ensure the involvement of women and other vulnerable groups. \n(ix)  Consultations with affected persons will continue during the implementation of \nthe LAR and rehabilitation.  \n \n6.  All  affected  families  and  affected  persons  will  be  entitled  to  a  combination  of \ncompensation and resettlement assistance, reflecting the type of asset lost, magnitude of loss, \ngeneral  impact  on  the  affected  person\u2019s  livelihood,  and  degree  of  the  affected  person\u2019s \nsocioeconomic vulnerability. The affected persons will be entitled to five types of compensation \nor assistance: (i) compensation for loss of land and crops or trees at replacement value; (ii) \ncompensation  for  residential  or  commercial  structures  and  other  immovable  assets  at \nreplacement value; (iii) assistance in lieu of the loss of business or wage income; (iv) assistance \nfor shifting; and (v) rebuilding and/or restoration of community resources or facilities. \n \nD.  Compensation Eligibility and Entitlements \n7.  This LAR framework and resettlement procedural guidelines will apply to all projects \nunder the Investment Program. This will ensure that all persons affected by the acquisition of \nland and other fixed assets, by change in the use of land, and by the restrictions imposed by \nproject activities on land use, will get appropriate compensation and rehabilitation assistance.  \n \n1.  Eligibility \n8.  Affected persons entitled to compensation, or at least rehabilitation provisions under the \nProject, are \n(i)  all persons losing land with or without title, formal land-use rights, or traditional \nland-use rights; \n(ii)  tenants whether registered or not; \n(iii)  owners of buildings, crops, plants, or other objects attached to the land; and \n(iv)  persons losing business, income, and salaries. \n \n9.  Compensation eligibility will be limited by a cutoff date to be set at the end of the impacts \nassessment  and  affected  family/affected  person  census  carried  out  immediately  after  the \nconclusion of the detailed design. All affected families or affected persons who settle in affected \nareas after this date, and who cannot prove that they are displaced users of affected plots, will \nnot be eligible for compensation. DABS will inform local communities regarding the cutoff date \n ", "82   Appendix 18 \nthrough their local offices and through the relevant local government agencies. However, they \nwill be given sufficient advance notice to vacate premises or dismantle affected structures \nbefore project implementation. Their dismantled structures will not be confiscated and they will \nnot pay fines or sanctions.  \n \n2.  Entitlements \n10.  Entitlement  provisions  for  affected  persons  losing  land,  houses,  and  income  and \nrehabilitation subsidies will include provisions for permanent and temporary land losses, house \nand buildings losses, crops and trees losses, a relocation subsidy, and a business losses \nallowance based on tax declarations and/or lump sums. These entitlements are detailed as \nfollows: \n(i)  Permanent loss of agricultural land will be compensated at replacement cost based \non market rates. DABS will pay costs for documentary stamps and registration. \nAffected persons losing more than 10% of their land will be considered severely \naffected and will receive an additional 1 year crop compensation quota or alternate \nland based on availability and in consultation with the local councils. \n(ii)  Temporary land impacts will be compensated for crop losses only.  \n(iii)  Permanent  loss  of  residential  or  commercial  land  will  be  compensated  at \nreplacement cost based on market rates. DABS will pay transaction costs for titling \n(documentary  stamps,  registration  costs,  etc).  Valuation  will  not  discount  for \ndepreciation. \n(iv)  Loss of communal land or property will be compensated with replacement land or \nproperty in the same village. \n(v)  Buildings or structures losses will be compensated in cash at replacement cost free \nof deductions on account of depreciation and transaction costs. A lump sum shifting \nallowance  based  on  the  current  years  prices  will  be  paid  for  each  affected \nhousehold. \n(vi)  Crop losses will be compensated at market rate for the value of 1 year of production \nplus additional cash assistance at the current year\u2019s prices to purchase seeds and \nrestore future crop activities. \n(vii)  Fruit-bearing trees will be compensated at the value of 1 harvest times the number \nof years needed to re-grow a tree at the same productive level of the tree lost. Non-\nfruit-bearing trees will be compensated at the cost of reproducing a tree to the \ngrowth level at which it was cut. Timber trees will be compensated at the commercial \nvalue of the wood times its volume. No deductions will be applied to the value of the \nwood left to the affected family.  \n(viii)  Loss of business will be compensated with a lump sum, one-time allowance for 1 \nyear income for permanent loss and 6 months income for temporary loss. \n(ix)  Agricultural land tenants, sharecroppers, and workers will be compensated in cash \nequal to 1 full year of income from the lost land. Agricultural workers whose contracts \nwill be interrupted will receive an indemnity equivalent to 3 months of income. \n(x)  Loss of community property will be compensated at full replacement value. \n(xi)  Vulnerable households will receive an additional 20% of the total compensation. \n(xii)  If a household\u2019s land is found to be not viable after acquisition, the PMO will help \naffected  persons  prepare  a  deed  of  sale,  which  will  submitted  to  the  district \ngovernment to issue a qabala (title). This will be coordinated by the PMO, and the \ntitle will be transferred to the project. \n \n ", "    Appendix 18  83\n11.  Land replacement values will be assessed based on a survey of land sales in project areas \nover the past 3 years and of government rates (if any) as per local revenue papers. If data on land \nmarket rates are unavailable, affected persons and competent authorities will negotiate land values \nand compensation for other assets. Table A18.2 summarizes these entitlements.  \n \nTable A18.2: Entitlement Matrix \nAsset   Specification  Affected People  Compensation Entitlements \n  All land losses    Land for land compensation with plots of equal value and \n  independent  Farmer or  productivity to the plots lost; or cash compensation for \n  from impact  titleholder  affected land at replacement cost based on market valuea \n  severity  plus a 15% compulsory land acquisition surcharge and free \n  of taxes, registration, and transfer costs \nPermanent  Tenanor  Renewal of lease in other plots of equal value/productivity of \nimpact on  leaseholder  plots lost, or cash equivalent to market value of gross yield \narable Land  (registered or  of affected land for the remaining lease years (up to 3 years) \nnot) \nSharecroppers  Cash compensation equal to the market value of the lost \n(registered or  harvest share once (temporary impact) or twice (permanent \nnot)  impact)  \nAgricultural  Cash indemnity corresponding to their salary (including \nworkers losing  portions in kind) for the remaining part of the agricultural \ntheir contract  year \nSquatters  Rehabilitation allowance equal to market value of one gross \nharvest (in addition to crop compensation) for land use loss.  \nAdditional  Farmer  or  Severe impact allowance equal to the market value of gross \nprovisions for  titleholder  harvest of the affected land for 1 year (including winter and \nsevere impacts  Leaseholder  summer crop and additional to standard crop compensation) \n(more than  Sharecroppers  Severe impact allowance equal to the market value of share \n10% of land  (registered or  of harvest lost (additional to standard crop compensation) \nloss)  not) \n    Squatters  Severe impact allowance equal to the market value of gross \nharvest of the affected land for 1 year (including winter and \nsummer crop and additional to standard crop compensation) \nResidential/    Titleholder  Land for land compensation through the provision of plots \nand  comparable in value/location to plot lost; or cash \ncommercial  compensation for affected land at full replacement cost free \nland  of taxes, registration, and transfer costs \nRenter  or  1\u20133 months allowance \nleaseholder \nSquatters  Accommodation in a government resettlement area or a self-\nrelocation allowance \nHouses and/    All relevant  Cash at replacement rates for affected structure free of \nstructures  affected persons  salvageable materials, depreciation, and transaction costs. \n(including   \nsquatters)  In case of partial impacts, full cash assistance to restore \nremaining structure \nCrops  Crops affected  All affected  Crop compensation in cash at full market rate for one \npersons  harvest (either winter or summer) by default for impacts \n(including  caused by tower bases and perimeters, stringing, and \nsquatters)  access \n \nAn assistance grant equivalent based on the current year\u2019s \nprices for the purchase of agricultural inputs for the next \nseason \n \nAll other crop losses compensated at market rates based on \nactual losses \nTrees  Trees affected  All affected  Fruit-bearing trees: the value of one harvest times the \npersons  number of years needed to re-grow a tree at the same \n(including  productive level of the tree lost  \n ", "84   Appendix 18 \nAsset   Specification  Affected People  Compensation Entitlements \nsquatters) \nNon-fruit-bearing trees: the cost of reproducing a tree to the \nlevel of growth at which it was cut \n(Trees compensation will be free of deduction for the value of \nthe wood left to the affected family.) \nBusiness  Temporary or  All affected  Business owner: (i) cash compensation equal to 1 year \nemployment  permanent  persons  income, if loss is permanent; (ii) cash compensation for the \nloss of  (including  period of business interruption, if loss is temporary \nbusiness or  squatters)   \nemployment  Worker/employees: Indemnity for lost wages for the period of \nbusiness interruption up to 3 months  \nRelocation  Transport or  All persons  Provision of a transition support, covering, allowance for \ntransitional  affected by  transport or livelihood expenses based on actual time taken, \nlivelihood costs  relocation  extent of impact and distance to new relocation sites \nCommunity      Rehabilitation or substitution of the affected structures or \nassets  utilities (e.g., mosques, footbridges, roads, schools, health \ncenters) \nVulnerable    Affected person  An additional 20% of total compensation/assistance and support \naffected  below poverty line  from locally available social welfare agencies \nperson    \nEmployment priority in project-related jobs \na  For the detailed definition of the methodology to evaluate land replacement cost/market value see below. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nE.  Institutional Arrangements \n12.  The resettlement and rehabilitation program described in this LAR framework involves \ndistinct processes, dynamics, and different agencies. DABS as the EA for the planning and \nimplementation of the resettlement and rehabilitation program, which also involves the provincial \nand district governments. The PMO, with the support of the management consultant and the \nimplementation  consultant,  will  coordinate  all  activities  related  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation. All activities will be coordinated with the relevant local government agencies \nand community in which the projects will be implemented. \n \n1.  Afghanistan Electricity Corporation (DABS) \n13.  Several agencies in Afghanistan are involved in matters related to land administration, \nand land rights. However, they are currently not in a position to fully exercise their mandates \nbecause of capacity issues and weak institutional structures. To overcome this weakness, \nDABS  has  overall  responsibility  for  the  Investment  Program,  including  preparation, \nimplementation, and financing of all LAR tasks and cross-agency coordination. An environment \nand social unit (ESU) will be established within the PMO exclusively for this purpose and will be \nsupported by management consultants. The ESU will be responsible internally for monitoring \nLAR plan preparation and implementation (including surveys, asset valuation, and community \nconsultation),  LAR-related  cross-agency  and  interdepartmental  coordination,  and  LAR  plan \napproval. Land acquisition will involve the following: \n \n(i)  An ESU will be established in the PMO to handle all LAR. \n(ii)  International and national resettlement specialists will be provided through the \nmanagement consultants. They will assist in LAR planning and implementation, \ninternal monitoring and evaluation, and training on impact assessment and ADB \nresettlement policy requirements. \n ", "    Appendix 18  85\n(iii)  Local nongovernment organizations (NGOs) may be engaged to provide on-site \nLAR  plan  preparation  assistance  for  surveys,  information  gathering,  and \nconsultations with affected persons. \n(iv)  Implementation consultants for the projects will include one international and one \nnational  social  development  and  resettlement  specialist  to  conduct  periodic \nmonitoring and evaluation and third-party validation of implementation of project-\nspecific LAR plan activities, and to liaise with the contractor to ensure smooth \nimplementation of related social development and resettlement requirements.  \n(v)  As necessary the PMO will coordinate with the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation \nand Livestock, Cadastre Survey Department, local governorates, NGOs and the \ncommunity shuras, and locally elected councils. \n \n2.  Other Agencies and Institutions \n14.  ADB will provide clearance for both category \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 LAR plans.  \n \nTable A18.3: Agencies Responsible for Implementation of Resettlement Plan \nNo.  Activity  Agency Responsible \n1  Setting up of an ESU in the PMO  DABS \n2  Hiring of resettlement specialist for ESU  PMO \n3  Hiring of implementing NGO  ESU of PMO \n4  Preparing and updating the LAR plan, including verification  ESU of PMO, local government, implementing NGO, \nsurvey, identification of affected persons, fixing of replacement  and competent authority \ncost, fixing of assistance, and disclosure of LAR plan. \n5  Review and approval of LAR plan  ESU of PMO and ADB \n6  Compensation award and payment of compensation   ESU  of  PMO,  local  administration,  and  competent \nauthority  \n7  Taking over the possession of acquired land and houses  ESU of PMO and concerned departments \n8  Handing over acquired land to contractors for construction  ESU of PMO \n9  Issuance of NOC   EMA  \n10  Restoration of temporarily acquired land to its original state,  Contractors subject to monitoring by implementation \nincluding restoration of private or common property resources  consultant, EMA, and ESU of PMO \n11  Income restoration activities, particularly for vulnerable groups   Implementing NGO  \n11  Internal monitoring  ESU of PMO  \n12  External monitoring  EMA \nDABS = Afghanistan Electricity Corporation, EMA = external monitoring agency, ESU = environment and social unit, \nLAR = land acquisition and resettlement, NOC = no-objection certificate, PMO = program management office.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nF.  Public Consultation and Documents Disclosure \n15.  All  stakeholders,  including  the  affected  persons  and  local  administration,  provincial, \ndistrict,  and  village  officials,  will  be  informed  and  consulted  about  a  project.  Further,  their \ncooperation will be solicited while conducting the inventory of affected assets and the census of \naffected persons. The affected persons will be consulted and their views on the project layout \nand design, as well as their preferences on compensation and/or other resettlement assistance, \nwill  be  recorded  and  given  due  consideration  in  project  planning.  Information  about  the \nentitlement provisions and compensation packages will be shared with the affected persons and \ntheir comments and suggestions will be incorporated in the LAR plan. LAR plans will detail \nprocesses and mechanisms to ensure the affected person\u2019s involvement. The plans also will \ninclude  an  appendix  with  a  list  of  the  consultation  meetings  held  with  date,  number  of \nparticipants, and minutes of matters discussed. \n \n ", "86   Appendix 18 \n16.  The LAR framework in the local language (Dari) will be disclosed to the affected persons \nat the PMO; the same will be done for the LAR plans after the endorsement by EA. The LAR \nframework and LAR plan in English will be posted on ADB\u2019s website after its endorsement by \nthe EA. Each LAR plan will be made available in Dari. A LAR information leaflet with LAR \ninformation,  including  measurement  of  losses,  detailed  asset  valuations,  entitlements  and \nspecial provisions, grievance procedures, timing of payments and displacement schedule, will \nbe made available in Dari and distributed to affected persons. The LAR framework and LAR \nplans disclosure will be a condition to proceed to project appraisal. \n \nG.  Grievance Redress Mechanism \n17.  An adequate grievance redress mechanism for affected persons will be established \nbased on a three-stage procedure for redress of grievances and complaints. \n \n18.  The ESU will design a pro forma letter to be used by the affected persons for filing \ncomplaints. Literate local leaders will be identified for each project to assist the affected persons \nin filling out the form, and to assist them at every stage of the complaints process. Moreover, the \nimplementing NGO will help the affected persons in preparing the grievance note and sending it \nto the concerned authority.  \n \nH.  Resettlement Budget \n19.  The EA will prepare detailed budgets for each LAR plan. The budget will be included in \nthe overall cost estimates for projects. The budget will detail (i) costs for land acquisition, \nhouses, crops, relocation, and income restoration; (ii) source of funding; (iii) arrangements for \napproval; (iv) flow of funds; and (v) a 15% contingency. The EA will provide all funds for land \nacquisition. All land acquisition, compensation, relocation, and rehabilitation of income and \nlivelihood will be considered an integral component of project costs. The EA will keep advance \nprovisional budget in its annual plan for LAR costs. \nI.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n20.  LAR tasks under the Investment Program will be subjected to internal and external \nmonitoring. Internal monitoring will be conducted by the ESU of the PMO, assisted by the \nimplementation consultant. External monitoring will be assigned to an agency recruited by the \nPMO. ADB will prepare the terms of reference for the external monitoring agency (EMA) before \nLAR plan implementation begins.  \n \n1.  Internal Monitoring \n21.  The PMO, through the ESU, will routinely carry out internal monitoring, and the results \nwill be communicated to ADB through the quarterly project implementation reports. Indicators \nrelated to the process, immediate outputs, and results will be used for internal monitoring. This \ninformation will be collected directly from the field and reported monthly to the PMO to assess \nthe  progress  and  results  of  LAR  plan  implementation,  and  to  adjust  the  work  program  if \nnecessary. The monthly reports will be consolidated every quarter in the standard supervision \nreports and submitted to ADB. The following will be monitoring benchmarks: (i) information \ncampaign and consultation with affected persons, (ii) status of land acquisition and payments on \nland compensation, (iii) compensation for affected structures and other assets, (iv) relocation of \naffected persons, (v) payments for loss of income, (vi) selection and distribution of replacement \nland, and (vii) income-restoration activities. \n ", "    Appendix 18  87\n \n2.  External Monitoring \n22.  External monitoring will be carried out twice a year, and the results will be communicated \nto the PMO and ADB through semiannual reports. The EMA will be recruited annually on an \nintermittent basis up to 1 year after the project works are completed. The EMA will also be \nresponsible for (i) issuing a no-objection certification to proceed with work in sections of lots of \nthe project where there is no land acquisition; and (ii) for sections or lots where LAR is required, \ncompleting an audit confirming that all compensation and related resettlement assistance in \ncash or kind has been delivered to the affected households before issuing no-objection to \nproceed.  A  copy  of  the  no-objection  certificate  will  be  submitted  to  the  PMO  (ESU), \nimplementation consultant, and ADB simultaneously.  \n \n23.  The EMA will also assess the status of vulnerable groups affected by the project, such \nas households headed by women, disabled and/or elderly and poor families. The indicators \ndeveloped  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  project  will  be  based  on  the  following:  (i) \nsocioeconomic conditions of the affected persons after resettlement; (ii) communications and \nreactions from affected persons on, among other things, entitlements, compensation, options, \nalternative developments, and relocation timetables; (iii) changes in housing and income levels; \n(iv)  rehabilitation  of  squatters;  (v)  valuation  of  property;  (vi)  grievance  procedures;  (vii) \ndisbursement  of  compensation;  and  (viii)  level  of  satisfaction  of  affected  persons  after \nresettlement. \n \n24.  For each project, the EMA will carry out an evaluation of the LAR plan about 1 year after \nits implementation. The main reason for this study is to find out whether the plan objectives \nwere attained. The socioeconomic survey baseline will be used to compare pre- and post-\nproject conditions. The EMA will recommend supplemental assistance for the affected persons if \nthe study shows that the objectives of the LAR plan have not been attained. \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20081107162902+08'00'", "Creator": "Adobe Acrobat 8.1 Combine Files", "Keywords": "Proposed Multitranhce Financing Facility and Administration of Grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for the Energy Sector Development Investment Program", "Producer": "Adobe Acrobat 8.1", "ModDate": "D:20081202160057+08'00'", "Title": "rrp: afg 42094, afg, afghanistan, multitranhce financing facility, financing facility administration,  afghanistan energy development projects, energy sector development programs"}}
